on Albert Barracks Wall, reflects a moment in the colonial history of TƒÅmaki Makaurau.</p><h2>Transcript</h2><p style="opacity: 0.9; font-size: 0.8em">Transcripts may be automatically generated and may not be 100% accurate.</p><p>the park was found at Old Coral Hall um<br>by members of the construction team<br>which has been working on on the<br>renovation and uh restoration of of a<br>historic campus<br>Building and so uh the park was found uh<br>in what is essentially a storage area at<br>the back of the hall um which makes<br>sense um as that's a a storage area<br>closest to to the Barrack walls where it<br>was um first attached uh so the good<br>thing uh is that the the university has<br>guidelines um for what should happen<br>with uh a material artifact that's<br>discovered in a renovation like this<br>given that old Coral Hall is a historic<br>building on campus uh and those<br>guidelines stipulates that uh any uh<br>objects or Discovery would be um offered<br>to the Orland W Museum and that's<br>because the museum holds the collections<br>the different archaeological<br>collections that have been uh discovered<br>relating to the Albert Barracks over um<br>over the years so the inscription of the<br>plaque reads to commemorate the union<br>and comraderie of Pia and malis during<br>the Great European War this tablets was<br>fixed by the Oakland civic league<br>September<br>1915 on the remnant of the baric wall<br>built by friendly Maris in<br>1848 after the burning of<br>CA so the plaque was removed from the<br>bar walls uh in<br>1983 um and this was be after a whole<br>series of debates that had taken place<br>on campus around the representation of<br>Marty and the the and racist<br>presentations of Marty history and<br>culture and we we'd seen um episodes of<br>of debate and contested um activism on<br>campus in the Years leading up to that<br>that year 1983 so for example in 1979 we<br>had famously the the Haka party incident<br>when um paria engineering students had<br>been challenged for their um<br>misappropriation of of the Haka by htoa<br>and Marty activist group so we it's a<br>it's a particularly kind of tense time<br>on campus so what we know is that the<br>park was on the attached to the Albert<br>Barracks wall the Albert Barracks wall<br>had been under the custodians ship of<br>the um New Zealand historic places as<br>well as um with the University of<br>Oakland on which the the wall is<br>situated there obviously was a<br>discussion between um New Zealand<br>historic places uh and the University of<br>Orland about the removal of the park I<br>think reflecting that sensitivity or the<br>desire to to be sensitive to um Marty<br>wishes in in the 1980s there was also a<br>desire to preserve this this historic um<br>Memorial<br>I can imagine that if I was removing a a<br>heavy Stone plaque I think the I'd want<br>to take it to the nearest storage area<br>um and that happens to be that um<br>storage space at the back of of old<br>Coral Hall what we don't know is is is<br>um well what we know is that it was it<br>was put in that that storage area um it<br>had been intended to be gifted to the<br>Orland Museum so we don't have any<br>records of the museum uh accepting the<br>plaque it may not the curators may not<br>have wanted it if it had been damaged<br>and graffitied um they might not have<br>appreciated its importance as a as a<br>artifact of of protest history for<br>example as we might see it today the<br>significance of the park is really in<br>its presentation of of shared Park and<br>Mali histories and it does that by<br>invoking at the beginning of the<br>inscription uh its intention to as we<br>can read to commemorate uh the the Union<br>uh and the camaraderie camarad<br>camaraderie has been slightly de um cut<br>off there um but we know from the<br>newspaper accounts of the time that<br>that's what the word was camaraderie of<br>Pia and Mii and so in the first place<br>that's referencing the joint service of<br>Mari and pakia during the first world<br>war and it's significantly um it was<br>fixed to the wall by the Oakland civic<br>league in September 195 de so this makes<br>it one of the first war memorials um to<br>the first world war the first world war<br>is referred to here as as the great<br>European War because of course it was an<br>ongoing conflict in<br>1915 and there were different names<br>given to this evolving conflict so<br>what's then interesting is that the<br>plaque invokes that joint military<br>service in the first world war and the<br>Great War this great European War<br>through a reference to an earlier shared<br>and contested history uh and it refers<br>to the the burning of<br>CAA um the burning of quara was a a<br>crucial moment um in in our Colonial<br>and with with their um with their<br>followers attacked CAA a very important<br>settlement in the Bay of islands their<br>intention is to cut down for the fourth<br>time the British flag staff as an act of<br>protest as an act of resistance to to<br>the what they perceived as the the<br>failure of the colonial government to<br>uphold to titis whitey the Treaty of<br>white hangi and it's a moment that<br>ultimately Sparks the Northern war in<br>1845 and that's the First full military<br>conflict between Mary and<br>paria in response to that burning of<br>cordara the attack on cordara um<br>refugees European refugees fleeing from<br>the town arrive in oaklands and they<br>bring with them news of the outbreak of<br>of of war in response to that orland is<br>fearful for of an attack from northern<br>Mar on ockland itself which then of<br>course we have to think about is a very<br>new fledgling Colonial settlement it's<br>the colonial Capital but it's very small<br>and tenuous foothold of of European<br>settlement in Tamaki Makoto and there's<br>a lot of fear that that Northern Marty<br>will will do to Oakland what what has<br>happened to Corda in the in the events<br>of of the Northern<br>war so in response to that attack um the<br>first um beginnings of what becomes the<br>Albert Barracks um is a which is the the<br>largest British military installation<br>so the expression friendly mares which<br>we can see has been uh partly removed by<br>the protesters in<br>1983 um very much reflects the ways that<br>the New Zealand wars were interpreted<br>and presented in 1915 so they reflect a<br>particular kind of idiom or expression<br>of of colonial history um told very much<br>from a British perspective and it's<br>quite a common phrase that we see um<br>being attached to different memorials<br>different War memorials uh relating to<br>uh the New Zealand wars in the early<br>20th century so interestingly just up<br>the road here from the University of<br>walkand uh the Simon streets um New<br>Zealand Wars Memorial that was um<br>unveiled um in the early 1920s also has<br>this language of friendly Maris<br>um of course we could think about how<br>it's a phrase that suggests a certain<br>perspective um and<br>one that kind of as a prefix if we're<br>going to attach friendly as a prefix um<br>it suggests the kind of opposite as well<br>the antithesis of that being Rebel or or<br>perhaps hostile Marty um who are being<br>excluded here from this so it's a sort<br>of a British telling of of the New<br>Zealand Wars um and obviously one that<br>became increasingly contested um in the<br>1980s as new zealanders Maria and Pia<br>were looking for more complex stories of<br>the New Zealand Wars that didn't that<br>would share different perspectives<br>particularly those Marty who resisted<br>colonial governments so as a a history<br>lecturer and a curator at at the of the<br>New Zealand Wars um at Oakland Walmore<br>Museum uh this discovery and or<br>rediscovery of this park is is really<br>exciting um I constantly remind my<br>students that the past matters and that<br>it's our role as historians to act as um<br>interpreters and translators and uh<br>negotiators of the past and how it<br>shapes our our present to help um<br>understand that and to interogate<br>that I think the pl's an interesting<br>find and that uh it gives us a little<br>bit of a window into that time and how<br>time previous to that especially around<br>the time of the construction of the wall<br>uh were viewed by by some in the city<br>here<br>um the mildy that we're engaged to to to<br>help build this<br>War uh were needed cuz there weren't<br>enough people in the city at the time to<br>to build it it was a response to an<br>attack in<br>k um the builders were paid and they<br>ended up producing a pretty outstanding<br>wall if you like um some of them were<br>likely my naat ancestors but I don't<br>know um because on the sign they just<br>consigned to the status of friendly mild<br>I think perhaps the intentions of the<br>Oakland civic league at the time and<br>getting the plaque done uh were<br>good uh but it leaves far too many<br>questions around who the people were and<br>what the purpose of of having that CL<br>here uh was as well so it gives us an<br>opportunity this F gives us an<br>opportunity to look back and ask some of<br>those questions um get a sense of the<br>feel of the time I don't think uh the<br>label of friendly mildy um as befitting<br>at all uh for those that existed in in<br>Tamaki at TH in those moments and so<br>this is a good opportunity to revisit<br>those<br>conversations</p></main><footer style="margin-top: 2rem; background: #0001; padding:
