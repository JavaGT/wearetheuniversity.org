alumni award for<br>2023 it's a shame you can't be with us<br>to celebrate in person but I know you're<br>off doing exciting things elsewhere in<br>the world so where are you right now and<br>what are you doing um yeah right now I'm<br>here in Southern California where I live<br>um and just a little south of La North<br>of San Diego um<br>we um happen to live in a like a<br>fantastic location here but um one<br>that's you know pretty proximate to the<br>things I'm involved with including<br>plenty where our first um and the<br>world's largest vertical Farm is<br>operational in the city the famous city<br>of Compton um in Central LA so that's<br>where I am so tell us more about plenty<br>you said a vertical Farm what is<br>that um so it's really a new way of<br>doing indoor agriculture as we you know<br>get hit with greater challenges and I<br>know Alo New Zealand's had that share of<br>weather challenges in the last couple of<br>years seems really as we look around the<br>world the weather is getting less<br>predictable and farming which is you<br>know Enterprise taken and undertaken<br>globally in every country we all need to<br>ear need to eat and Farmers have played<br>that role of providing food into our<br>communities you know for many many<br>Millennia growing Outdoors well as we<br>think about how we deal with climate<br>impact we deal also with how do we get<br>food that is often<br>seasonal made it available all year<br>round how do we do it with no<br>pesticides um with less water use with<br>less land use um these are all things<br>that you know we're using technology the<br>solve for at plenty and um today<br>apologies for the promo behind me um but<br>today we you know we sell leafy greens<br>to Major retailers like Walmart and all<br>foods here in the United States um so<br>yeah we're a technology company<br>developing new Solutions producing fresh<br>fruit vegetables plants and like highly<br>controlled indoor settings highly<br>automated using LEDs rather than the sun<br>um not using soil um so really a pretty<br>different way of tackling Agriculture<br>and food production and sort of to make<br>the point you know the first person to<br>actually touch the food is the consumer<br>so literally the entire process is<br>automated through robotics you know from<br>seed all the way through the Harvest so<br>not the way I'd probably thought about<br>agriculture when um we were rattling<br>around the par garden and to on here um<br>it's pretty different from there so<br>you've mentioned already this is a far<br>cry from growing up on the par at home<br>and working in the US is certainly a<br>long way from home where you grew up in<br>Alo in New Zealand so nor where are you<br>from Adama where did you uh grow up and<br>and what was that light with youro and<br>Har yeah uh well um you know I I grew up<br>in here on the V but Faro include man<br>paraka on the tanaki side of Faro and<br>then Teri in the fth and my family is<br>pretty connected to um all of the zoi<br>but I grew up you know in in here<br>originally um Went to went to school at<br>Hamilton boys where I was you know head<br>boy there and had um like great<br>education and then found myself um and<br>looking at universities to go to um<br>being really attracted to Victoria<br>partly because actually I was born in<br>fat my father mother lived there for a<br>number of years before we went back home<br>and um and so yeah got a got a deep<br>connection to Wellington it's my other<br>home I was honest about it so yeah I<br>wish I was there with wish I was there<br>hanging out with you tonight that's for<br>sure so let's let's let's move to that<br>time that P live your life where you<br>were where you you tuned up to the heing<br>aaka Victoria University of Wellington<br>as a brigh eyed first year student what<br>what were you do doing at the University<br>in those days um and maybe share a few<br>memorable moments with us oh well there<br>were quite a few of those like I I I<br>think you know when um you you know you<br>move into your first um you know leaving<br>home experience and going into you know<br>education our education firstly let's<br>just be honest I think the first year is<br>a bit of a blue because it's you know<br>frankly all about having you know maybe<br>fun more than it is about getting good<br>grades but sort of eventually figured<br>out that actually you had to balance the<br>funder grades ratio in favor of getting<br>better grades um and I studied both<br>Commerce uh and and law which um yeah<br>was as I look back at it I probably<br>think I should have followed my instinct<br>to go and do more science as well too<br>because I've ended up actually spending<br>a lot of my career in science and<br>Innovation focused disciplines but look<br>you know Victoria was a fantastic<br>Community to join at the time you know<br>um we also I think saw like a first<br>flush of madii students coming into the<br>university which you know you know<br>yourself has has been like an<br>evolutionary Journey at the University<br>but one that you know I look back now<br>and and there were just some amazing um<br>students coming through the programs<br>there and people that have many cases<br>become lifelong friends for me as well<br>too so you know as far as memorable<br>moments I also just have to say um you<br>know look back at the caliber of<br>educate Educators that we had and have<br>in the University system and I'm you<br>know again just very humbled to receive<br>this sort of award but also to look back<br>and um and just recognize the the High<br>Caliber of Educators who really<br>profoundly changed my life whether it<br>was uh Joe Williams um tuning me up in<br>legal in legals um or whether it was<br>actually have to say um special shout<br>out to on the little side to John Preble<br>I would never have imagined you could<br>make tax law sound interesting and even<br>when I say it it sounds kind of stupid<br>but actually you know um this was sort<br>of About the Passion that people had for<br>their subjects and I think on the Comm<br>colist side you know um professors like<br>John brocklesby um John Davies D<br>Gilbertson and and many others you know<br>had a a big effect particularly in<br>interesting me in the area of<br>Entrepreneurship which um I think as I<br>came out of the University system you<br>know I think I realized at some point I<br>wanted to be an entrepreneur and um star<br>and build businesses which is really<br>what I've spent most of the last 30<br>years doing so I think you know Vic<br>takes a lot of credit for putting me on<br>that<br>track cway cway you've since gone on to<br>uh spend really an entire career pushing<br>boundaries and creating change as an<br>entrepreneur as a leader and uh as a<br>mentor for others so what advice do you<br>have now uh for people who want to make<br>change in the world and and maybe sort<br>of follow and your<br>footsteps yeah it's it's a great<br>question like I think you know the the<br>journey for me has been a really diverse<br>one and one where personally I haven't<br>tried to plan next iterations of my<br>career like down to like f levels of<br>detail I've sort of found areas that I<br>found personally<br>interesting not only you know from the<br>standpoint of being in business and<br>doing well but wanting to have an<br>opportunity to do something and pack<br>one of the exciting things I guess about<br>being an you know the NFL of venture<br>capital in the United States um Silicon<br>Valley founding a venture room building<br>what building multiple funds now<br>building companies is that um you're<br>invariably surrounded by amazing<br>talent and um quite often you know<br>you're the at least I found for me<br>anyway you know far from being the<br>smartest person in the room so you know<br>there are a lot of people that you're<br>able to absorb and lean from with shared<br>values like finding people that you<br>connect with<br>intellectually um emotionally at a<br>values level super super important and<br>then the other thing for me has always<br>been the desire to have a connection<br>with and the ability to take what I'm<br>working on and and find an expression<br>and value for it back at home so again I<br>think it's you know so humbling but also<br>means a lot to get the<br>recognition from Victoria but also just<br>a remind of how important um it is to<br>you know to share what I've learned back<br>with um particularly back with Mari<br>entrepreneurs and also with um you know<br>the many amazing leaders we have leading<br>in so many disciplines um you know New<br>Zealand alter mates not withstanding<br>what seems to be a a difficult political<br>moment going on right now boy the um the<br>progress by Mar leadership and at home<br>has been credible and it's it's great to<br>be even a small part of it<br>and fabulous I'm looking forward to<br>hearing more about the the results the<br>outcomes of all of this uh development<br>and<br>support um leaves me with just a couple<br>of couple of questions to finish off ARA<br>what's next for ARA cookie Tha I I I'm<br>getting a sense that you don't rest on<br>your laurels that there's always more to<br>do so where are you looking to next uh<br>well the you know we've got a big job in<br>front of us with plenty we you know um<br>have about 500 people or so in the<br>company<br>now but are looking to take the business<br>um Nationwide here in the US but also<br>Global so that's going to be a big Focus<br>for me for the next few years T portii<br>obviously but um importantly you know<br>I've got a young family as well too so<br>you know um that's a that's a major for<br>me luckily we we live in like a place<br>that's got 300 days a year of sunshine<br>so getting outside and enjoying life is<br>um is not a big challenge I mean longer<br>term I'd really like to um spend more<br>time in um mentoring coaching uh growing<br>the nonprofit I just mentioned um and<br>and spending more time at home so I've<br>been away nearly well over 20 years now<br>and uh still think of Al's home so this<br>is my other home and love it here my<br>family loves it here but I do plan to<br>spend more time at home in Al so see you<br>for that flat night soon I hope God we<br>you're always welcome here we'd love to<br>have a visit from you um final<br>Reflections now what does winning the<br>this distinguished alumni award mean for<br>you uh well it's a surprise to be quite<br>honest because I feel like I've been<br>been gone so long that it's it's nice to<br>be um Remembered in a way I think maybe<br>more importantly than the award for me<br>personally it was really exciting to um<br>to talk to Nick and to John and others<br>in your leadership there um at a<br>challenging time for the University but<br>really having a vision for being what's<br>part of the next evolution<br>and frankly vision for creating deeper<br>ties between the community and education<br>I personally got the benefit from that<br>but I think you know um frankly the<br>future of a country like New Zealand any<br>country really rests in nurturing the<br>talent um that we have and and I think<br>you know it's an exciting time of<br>opportunity for New Zealand and for<br>loock the University so as much as it's<br>humbling to receive the award I actually<br>like to push back um the praise the<br>other way and say you know I think the<br>university is set for a fantastic next<br>Evolution and I'm just honored and proud<br>to be part of the Alum and uh here to<br>support any way I can the growth of the<br>universi a benefit to the community and<br>particularly to the m community<br>so Al I'm sure we'll take you up on<br>that well thank you again adma for your<br>impressive Mahi and for sharing your<br>thoughts and experiences with us today<br>um congratulations again on being a<br>2023</p></main><footer style="margin-top: 2rem; background: #0001; padding: 2rem; text-align: center;"><p>We Are The
