with<br>you know your life before University um<br>tell us a little bit about you know how<br>you grew up and and what your family<br>life was<br>like um I grew up in Cambridge in the Y<br>cutle um my parents came out here in the<br>1950s and my father was from India my<br>mom from Ireland they met in the UK they<br>came out here and um made this first<br>generation New Zealander family and we<br>moved around a bit any way we mostly I<br>grew up in Cambridge um I was interested<br>to your point earlier about your parents<br>wanting you to go to university and I<br>was always expected to go to university<br>that was just my privilege and my<br>upbringing and it didn't really matter<br>so much what I did my parents raised us<br>all to be really confident in ourselves<br>and to think that we could do whatever<br>we wanted um one of my sisters pointed<br>out to me recently that actually that<br>was a bit of a parental trick cuz we<br>they didn't really want us to do<br>anything we wanted but they wanted us us<br>to do something that they valued um but<br>by the time we worked that out we had<br>all done that yeah yeah so I headed off<br>to University actually I went to otaga<br>University for my undergraduate degree<br>when I was however old 17 or 18 um I<br>wasn't a very good student I was<br>diligent but not very clever I didn't<br>get a very good degree and I came up<br>here to Wellington and got a job any job<br>at that point the point was to get a job<br>and I got a job in the public service um<br>in the ministry of Consumer Affairs you<br>didn't need to be a lawyer to do this<br>job but boy did it light my public<br>service fire wow cuz what I was doing<br>was answering the phone to people who<br>had consumer um troubles and I did some<br>I think amazing work with people who it<br>was my first real exposure to people who<br>the way they were brought up and the<br>Privileges that they had or didn't have<br>meant that they were so disadvantaged in<br>the marketplace terrible car deals<br>terrible High purchase deals just really<br>hard lives um that I was part of helping<br>fix that or change that just on one<br>transaction at a time but then I thought<br>I need to go back to University one of<br>my sisters who's an academic um thought<br>that I needed to go back to University<br>probably more than I did and so I came<br>here to um to hering aaka or Vic of<br>course as we have always called it um<br>and my workplace let me take time out to<br>go and study and I did a master's degree<br>and to my surprise actually to<br>everybody's surprise I got a cracking<br>good master's degree and I think the<br>reason was Victoria taught me how to<br>think and made it really made me realize<br>that I could be confident in the<br>thoughts that I had I didn't just had to<br>have to regurgitate what I'd been taught<br>by somebody else actually that course in<br>those days you did Master's course over<br>three different sort of discipline or<br>Pro uh<br>subjects actually what I thought<br>mattered and my brief experience of<br>working meant that the study that I did<br>then was able to do things like study<br>Consumer Credit contracts a little bit<br>boring perhaps but being able to do a<br>bit of academic work about exposing this<br>part of the market that I had seen that<br>was just so unfair to people who took<br>out these punishing credit contracts<br>because they needed to get credit but<br>what they were paying was just appalling<br>for what they were getting so a bit of<br>academic exposure to some of the things<br>that I was seeing it was a great<br>combination of things yeah and do you<br>think was there something different<br>about Victoria to you earlier study or<br>was it the stage of life you're at that<br>that Lit that fire I think it must have<br>been the combination um I think doing a<br>master's degree you are a bit more free<br>to think and to set your own path about<br>what you want to say um but this but the<br>lecturers and the Tes who I had then<br>some of who are still here heing a like<br>Bill Aken<br>um uh oh anyway briefly his name's gone<br>out of my mind um people who just<br>encouraged me and gave me this confid<br>confidence to say what I thought uh it<br>was just a really really opened up my<br>idea that I had something to contribute<br>yeah and in terms of Public Service<br>public service is is part of your DNA<br>really isn't it and and interesting to<br>hear that it started in that first job<br>yeah and that's where I realized<br>that was a slight it's not really a<br>secret cuz I'm well I'm about to tell<br>everyone but I've said it before I<br>didn't really want to be a lawyer you<br>know I went to univiversity and did a<br>law degree because I couldn't do methal<br>science and I was expected to go to<br>university so there I was um but it was<br>in the public I just want to point out<br>that you're the s in general just in<br>case you and I'd like to be clear that I<br>have now got a law degree yeah I did get<br>one and I got too but<br>um but that combination of realizing<br>that you could use your law degree not<br>to do all the sort of I knew what<br>lawyers did because I watched a lot of<br>television when I was a kid so I didn't<br>want to be that sort of lawyer um but<br>going to realize ing that I could use my<br>law degree to make a difference to<br>people not just oneon-one although that<br>is how I started then I got a job on a<br>policy unit at consumer affairs and you<br>could work on law reform and you could<br>work for John Allen's already said the<br>rule of law so that's I can say it too<br>you know you could work for something<br>bigger than yourself or from my own<br>biased view of lawyers somebody else's<br>bottom line and a firm you could do<br>something different that's what I<br>realized I could combine those things<br>that was very exciting yeah yeah and as<br>the I mean it was great to get a round<br>of applause for you being the first<br>female solicitor general of New Zealand<br>and you know I think a lot of people<br>would be surprised that it took so long<br>but that puts you in a unique position<br>of of leadership I mean what are some of<br>the challenges that you've faced on your<br>journey in the public service to this<br>very important role for all of us in ALA<br>New Zealand um as a<br>woman yes I've been asked that question<br>before and in fact I would say that what<br>I have experienced along the way in the<br>public service is people who wanted to<br>help me be the best me um my first I<br>would now say he was my first Mentor I<br>wouldn't have known that at the time but<br>was one of my bosses Peter Murray who<br>could see in me that there was more than<br>what I was doing and he really pushed me<br>and encouraged me along the path so in<br>fact rather than being held back I've<br>been lucky enough to find people who can<br>see something else that I perhaps<br>couldn't see and push me along the path<br>um and that has led me to realize that<br>my strength if that's not going too far<br>is actually to De working with people I<br>mean that is the way I deliver the work<br>that I do is always with and through<br>other<br>people I'm not so stupid to think that I<br>know the answers just because I've got<br>this job in fact the more I know the<br>more I realize that I know nothing um<br>and you really need to work with people<br>and to understand people and their<br>perspectives in order to be influential<br>and what advice would you give give to<br>someone wanting to follow a similar path<br>in the public service or someone you<br>know like yourself not quite knowing<br>where they want where they want to go<br>the um there was a study done a few<br>years ago now the Mackenzie Institute<br>did the study about what makes<br>successful women Thrive and they found<br>three things and I read the study or I<br>probably read a review of the<br>study after I had done some of these<br>things but the the first and most<br>important thing was to do something that<br>you love and I know that's a real<br>privilege that I've been able to to do<br>that but I have been able to take jobs<br>that I thought were interesting I didn't<br>have a particular plan I didn't think in<br>this and by this time will be the<br>solister General in fact nothing was<br>further from my mind I did jobs that I<br>thought be interesting and engaging<br>always in the public<br>service and I ended up at the Crown Law<br>Office um so do something that you love<br>the other two things were shut down the<br>voice inside your head that tells you<br>negative things about yourself easier<br>said than done sometimes but um and the<br>third one was um find out what gives you<br>energy and try and pursue that so that's<br>the advice that I would give if it's<br>possible and I know it's a privileged<br>comment to make but if you have that<br>those choices do what you love yeah I<br>think it would be a terrible thing to<br>think I want to go over this I'll do<br>this thing that I don't really love to<br>get there I think that would be very<br>hard if that's wouldn't be as inspiring<br>for me or as uh energizing for me than<br>just going going around doing the things<br>I love and getting there yeah and and<br>picking up on the comment about shutting<br>down those internal voices in your head<br>that um hold you back I guess I I did<br>read that you've spoken before that you<br>yourself um were often confronted by an<br>internal narrative that that you weren't<br>good enough is is that right yes and<br>it's even listening to Mark um this<br>evening you know you end up with this<br>well I do and I'm sure others do this<br>internal narrative that says that that's<br>not true or that's not not right I mean<br>right from when I was a kid I'm queer<br>I've always known that never fitted the<br>right mold I still don't fit the right<br>mold and sometimes it gets me the trick<br>to the answer to that I think is to<br>speak about it actually because when you<br>say to somebody oh I think I'm stupid or<br>don't fit in or you know whatever it is<br>that worries you actually when you get<br>reflected back to you somebody who you<br>value their views when they reflect back<br>to you what they can see in you you can<br>start to believe in it<br>yeah<br>and I think I think that's a good place<br>to leave it and and um thank you for<br>spending some time in my living room<br>it's the first time I've had the<br>here that was awesome that was awesome<br>congratulations</p></main><footer style="margin-top: 2rem; background: #0001; padding: 2rem; text-align: center;"><p>We Are The
