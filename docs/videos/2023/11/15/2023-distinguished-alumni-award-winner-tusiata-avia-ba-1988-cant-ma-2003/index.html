little<br>bit about your early years sure um so<br>father who you you know is hanging about<br>here with us so watch it yeah I'm<br>um he was one of the very first waves of<br>Pacific migration so came here in<br>1952 um and very quickly to Christ<br>Church so he was one of seven first um<br>Salmons and I see the daughter of one of<br>so um yeah he was one of the<br>founding kind<br>of um Pacific all Salmons in Christ<br>Church wow um and so proud to be his<br>daughter and I know that he will be so<br>proud of me you know his passed um and<br>so with my mom uh she's 90 and she is<br>back<br>um in Christ Church so yeah born in<br>Christ Church um never liked it<br>there um but you know like I was born in<br>1966 so I grew up during um Dawn raids<br>when I was a kid<br>um<br>um what what was that springb tour yeah<br>that was big you know when I was a a<br>teenager<br>it was a really crap time to be a brown<br>girl there was nothing cool about being<br>a brown girl in Christ Church like<br>believe me just nothing<br>so and by a cruel twist of fate I'm<br>living there<br>again in my childhood home in<br>adoi yeah it's very<br>weird because I was desperate to escape<br>you know and<br>was Victoria University part of that<br>escape uh a very very<br>long like I think I was away<br>for I was away from New Zealand well I<br>was away from Christ Church for 20 years<br>or maybe more um and away from New<br>Zealand for 10<br>and<br>um yeah Victoria was when I finally<br>decided oh I can be a<br>writer because to be honest I didn't<br>think that brown girls like<br>me were allowed to be writers you know<br>wow<br>um and it took me a long time it took me<br>till my<br>30s to be disabused of that notion and<br>that was like coming here at the very<br>end of the '90s and you know cuz he'd be<br>this huge explosion in the Pacific arts<br>and my cousin Victor<br>Roger um who was a great<br>playright um introduced me to all these<br>marvelous people filmmakers and<br>directors and actors and um writers and<br>I thought oh my God you know saw people<br>like me and I thought I could do this<br>too um and went away back overseas and<br>thought about it for a while and then<br>came back<br>and um the IM AML was nearly my Landing<br>place first I went to F and then um I<br>IML but it made it was massive for me<br>yeah what it was massive you know what<br>how did that light your<br>fire yeah it it um just to get in in the<br>first place was a really big deal I<br>didn't get in um the first time round<br>cuz I wrote something that was probably<br>quite crap when I look back and think<br>about it<br>um<br>but um I met one of my dearest friends<br>there hinana Baker who of course is a um<br>amazing poet and is also now the<br>Godmother of my<br>daughter um and Bill man H who was my<br>teacher um he was very kind to me and at<br>the time I was thinking why why you know<br>cuz I after the the course had finished<br>he kind of opened some doors for me to<br>um do some really awesome things go to<br>Russia and on a tour with like all these<br>really flash poets including himself in<br>Europe I'm like why are you doing this<br>for me you know but I figure after all<br>this time he must have kind of realized<br>I'd be quite good at<br>this so I think he was right yeah yeah I<br>mean this work that you're quite good at<br>um there's another way of describing<br>that it's um incredibly edgy it<br>challenges historical and cultural<br>narratives you know through ART um you<br>push the<br>boundaries um you've had supporters like<br>Bill manhire but you've also had critics<br>as well yeah yeah<br>mhm yeah how have you dealt with that<br>that your work is so challenging well<br>you know it's it's the critics have been<br>now right like I haven't really had any<br>critics until<br>now um and you know some of you may not<br>know all the that went down<br>with um act and what's that guy's name<br>Sean planket and those guys um I'm Petty<br>go so you're all good yeah um sort of<br>sort of like new Plymouth and Christ<br>Church New Plymouth virion nice<br>so I mean that that was really crazy<br>yeah it to yeah that was really crazy<br>um to you know it it was a poem it had<br>been it was in my book for 3 years<br>before they discovered this Dreadful<br>thing and decided what they call me uh<br>racist um hatefield<br>racist that's me I was thinking of<br>calling my book that hatefield<br>racist yeah um you still can oh I've<br>already published the new one right<br>yeah I'll let you say that do you want<br>to say that no you go you tell them the<br>no you say it it's your book no I want<br>to see a white man say it<br>okay<br>yeah yeah that's why I called it that<br>Patty yeah I've got it here I'm just not<br>sure if I cuz I I knew that it would be<br>you that would say it in front of<br>everyone for the first time<br>it's<br>big go on<br> he did well he did well yeah you<br>want me to big fat Brown BR I'll say it<br>with confidence yeah yeah once you say<br>it once it's easy I know yeah I know<br>everyone will be saying it soon yeah<br>yeah I want everyone to say it and tell<br>tell us about that while we're talking<br>um well the whole first section is my<br>response to David Seymour and the like<br>and all of<br>that um insane stuff because of course<br>David seamour he doesn't care about<br>poetry or me or even if I'm a hatefield<br>racist or not um but you know it was<br>just a Time and the run up to the<br>election<br>um I can't remember what we were talking<br>about yeah you yeah we're just talking<br>about big fat Brown Brown yeah so<br>the whole the whole um<br>first uh section is that um an answer to<br>all of that stuff because you know there<br>were I don't know um<br>300 um complaints to race relations<br>Commission<br>um a whole bunch of whole flood<br>of hate male and a death R so I was<br>telling the pro Vice Chancellor today<br>about about that she was saying so how<br>did you deal with all of that um and I<br>was saying well I just really just shut<br>myself off didn't read<br>anything um but yeah death threat will<br>get you especially when it comes from a<br>white supremacist who lives in your own<br>City you know so I don't know like<br>maybe it's maybe I should kind of take<br>it as a medal to be able to cause that<br>kind of ruckus with a<br>exactly and your poetry and this was<br>going to be the white man's way of<br>asking this question your poetry<br>obviously explores what it's like to be<br>a Pacific woman in New Zealand that was<br>my way of saying can you talk about big<br>fat Brown but<br>you that particular out of the bag<br>as they say so well like all the<br>out of the bag yeah yeah and but how<br>important has that been to communicate<br>that experience through through your<br>work of being a specific woman in well I<br>mean ultimately it's important for me<br>because I'm the only person I write for<br>you know um I never think about my<br>audience I just write for myself I don't<br>think<br>about um what might<br>work for I don't know the market the<br>reader um because<br>that's no I don't I don't think about<br>that when I'm writing and if I ever do<br>you know I just push that out of the way<br>I've kind of trained myself to do that<br>now I just write for myself you know and<br>if people like it then that's<br>awesome um and I'm always a bit<br>surprised<br>um but yeah that's what I do yeah and<br>doing the Masters um you talked about a<br>little bit earlier but you know doing<br>that Master's course how how did that<br>accelerate what you're doing or how did<br>that help you find the creative force<br>that that that you<br>became well I got that kind of beginning<br>at<br>f<br>um but I<br>think um doing that<br>course um<br>at at v um really let<br>me go into poetry you know and realize<br>okay this is this is my<br>place um and you know Bill kind of left<br>us to kind of figure things out on our<br>own a lot um which was good you know um<br>and by the end of um the Masters I had<br>an early version of wild dogs under my<br>skirt<br>um yeah so it was a really<br>great holding place and by holding I<br>mean holding place um and that you know<br>that that was being in the company of<br>other of other<br>writers<br>um yeah I think back on it with great<br>kind of fondness and I wonder if I could<br>do it again<br>yeah yeah and what advice would you have<br>for anyone um like yourself trying to um<br>Creator I mean we're all creators right<br>like<br>everybody is a Creator in some way or<br>another like we human beings are<br>creative and I think<br>if I think if you're drawn towards<br>poetry in any way at all you should just<br>do it and<br>find ways to support yourself around it<br>you know cuz it's a<br>really um<br>individual and quite lonely thing to do<br>you know it's not like being a band or<br>you know um being to play with lots of<br>other people it's very solo and I'm not<br>a very solo<br>person um so I find it quite lonely I<br>find I find R and quite lonely but I<br>think for people who feel like that's<br>what somewhere deep inside you to do<br>that I wanted to be a writer from when I<br>was 10 but I didn't find the permission<br>to do that until I was in my 30s from<br>seeing those other<br>people and I think you know often it's<br>that permission feeling that permission<br>that feeling like you're allowed to do<br>it um I don't know if any of you<br>struggle with<br>that um but<br>yeah it's finding that and if you can't<br>find it in yourself and surrounding<br>yourself with people that will help you<br>find that and then to writing for<br>yourself right what you care about you<br>know um I can't imagine not doing that I<br>think when I get to the end of my life I<br>often think about this cuz I'm poor I'm<br>really poor it's really<br>stupid don't own a house don't own a car<br>anyway I'm not trying to like make you<br>start up a what are those those things<br>called go fund me thing or anything but<br>if you want<br>to<br>um what was I saying if if on my<br>deathbed I can look back and go yes I<br>did what I<br>came to this planet to<br>do then my life would have been worth<br>it and that's kind of what I feel like<br>I'm doing I think you are yeah Rand of<br>pools plays it's<br>Gra</p></main><footer style="margin-top: 2rem; background: #0001; padding: 2rem; text-align:
