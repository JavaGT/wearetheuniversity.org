accurate.</p><p>thanks for joining me Wy um Wendy if we<br>could start like with everyone else your<br>early days I understand you're from from<br>Northland what was what was early life<br>and and Faro life like for you um I'm<br>actually<br>toii so my family came here in 1971 when<br>I was a tiny little<br>baby and<br>from<br>England and so I grew up in an immigrant<br>is interesting because Foo and Fara is<br>so important here to everybody within<br>this culture and we were a very small<br>family my entire family is here both of<br>there and so we were this tiny little<br>family surrounded by people with very<br>big families so we I didn't have aunties<br>and cousins and whatnot and that's a<br>double-edged sword because I could see<br>everybody else had these huge families<br>but I did not however not having aunties<br>you can get away with quite a lot more<br>um and the other thing was that we we<br>ended up doing a lot of things for<br>ourselves as a family so very early on<br>it was instilled in me that if you want<br>something done you do it yourself you<br>learn how to do it and you go out and<br>you do it so so I kind of grew up with<br>that philosophy and we moved around a<br>lot we didn't have very much money and<br>our family washed up into ta<br>too um basically seeking the warmth they<br>were from Yorkshire and we came to a<br>South Pacific island and they got a bit<br>of a shock when it wasn't what they<br>thought it was going to<br>be so they moved further and further<br>north and eventually settled in<br>dargaville um<br>where they convinced me to go to<br>University I was always an opinionated<br>kid which people translated as a brainy<br>kid um and so they said you should go to<br>university so I did I had no idea what I<br>wanted to do and I flunked out of w in<br>1989 which ironically was the first year<br>they started charging fees to go to<br>university um and so I went back to<br>dargaville and lived as a Bogan for a<br>while and it's good that's good life<br>experience it it was it was definitely<br>an exper erience<br>um I got to see a lot of the the impacts<br>of drug<br>policy uh for example the the economy at<br>the time basically ran on cannabis cash<br>and I was there in the 90s when that was<br>gradually changing over to<br>methamphetamine so I saw the impact of<br>the enforcement of cannabis law on what<br>was actually happening to people and I<br>thought well that's not right um and it<br>took me a while to get get it together<br>because you know Bogan<br>um but eventually I ended up in<br>Wellington um with an understanding of<br>Drug law and a desire to do something<br>about it and at about the same<br>time the bzp party pills got<br>banned and at that time I kind of went<br>oh I can see what's going to happen here<br>they're all going to end up in the<br>illicit market and people are going to<br>buying them and taking them thinking<br>they're taking something else and I<br>learned about drug cheing at that time<br>and I was like well this is a brilliant<br>idea why are we not doing this but I was<br>nobody and I didn't think that anybody<br>would listen to me having opinions at<br>them from my position so I thought I'd<br>better get an education properly and I<br>finally worked out what I wanted to do<br>which was go to university so that's<br>kind of how I ended up here yeah so you<br>ended up obviously you'd graduated from<br>the University of<br>Bogan um and then<br>you what you felt that you needed to a<br>university degree to be taken seriously<br>or to add to your manner or to um<br>help yeah I could see that people with<br>University degrees were the people that<br>were getting listened to and I knew that<br>nobody would listen to me I was I spent<br>15 years working in Sharon gangs and<br>that was kind of you know why why should<br>anybody listen to me about drug policy<br>so I thought I'd go and learn some more<br>about it um<br>so yeah I studied part-time one paper<br>per trimester from 2008 to<br>2013 um to do a double major in<br>criminology and social policy um I<br>worked full-time I was raising my son it<br>was an interesting time it was a lot of<br>work um it's a it's a remarkable<br>that yeah it um at the time it was just<br>what I was doing it's like I wanted to<br>do this thing and so here was the things<br>I had to do to achieve it and so I did<br>that um but University what it actually<br>did for me I think I think the cudos of<br>having a degree has definitely helped<br>but what I got from<br>University was<br>first I had developed a much better<br>understanding of the<br>injustices associated with Drug law the<br>way they are applied around the world<br>but particularly here in altero what<br>they do to people I learned a lot about<br>that I learned about how to build a<br>social movement um and I learned about<br>the the complicity of governments in the<br>perpetuation of these injustices so<br>there was a whole lot of stuff I I<br>learned but probably the most important<br>thing I learned was imposed On Me by<br>some of my professors are here um I hope<br>they're not offended but those<br>ridiculously low word<br>counts<br>so so I would sit down to write my<br>essays and I would write 8,000 words and<br>I would have to cut it down to 2,000 and<br>as a result I was got good at making<br>concise clear arguments wow and that's<br>probably one of the best things I<br>learned at<br>University<br>and you know you've started through your<br>Mahi National<br>conversations about something that<br>people didn't really want a national<br>conversation about okay um that to my<br>mind takes exceptional leadership<br>qualities um do you have any advice for<br>other people who want to start a<br>national conversation about things that<br>people don't want started because CU<br>that's what you've<br>done wow that's really a good question<br>um part of it is all of the people who<br>have sort of coalesced around know your<br>stuff have have been attracted to this<br>idea and part of that was because it's a<br>no-brainer it was very very obvious that<br>this was going to prevent people they<br>cared about from dying and this this<br>came into my awareness the first time I<br>spoke about what I was doing in public<br>um I was pretty sure I was going to get<br>arrested this was at a festival on stage<br>in front of about 400 people and instead<br>afterwards I was approached by all of<br>the middle-aged moms in the crowd coming<br>up to me and going how do we get our<br>teenagers to do this and so if if I had<br>to give advice it would be get the<br>middle-aged moms on<br>board I'm not joking there's a whole lot<br>of stuff about being a middle-aged mom<br>you care about your kids you care about<br>your parents<br>most people<br>underestimate women of my age and but<br>we're on committees we're at the rugby<br>team we talk to people we listen to<br>people and if you really want to get<br>your message out those are the people<br>opinion and you know we you know<br>speaking about that and we I spoke about<br>it in the citation as well you know<br>you've probably never thought about this<br>but how many lives do you think you have<br>saved by checking dangerous drugs is<br>there any way of even adding that up you<br>can't measure it unfortunately because<br>that's one of the things I learned at<br>University what's good evidence and<br>there is no good evidence there because<br>how can you prove that something would<br>have happened if you didn't intervene so<br>we actually built all our evidence<br>around knowing that we couldn't prove<br>that we were saving lives however if the<br>response that we got from the uone scare<br>in 2021 which was hundreds of people<br>messaging us going thank you for putting<br>that message out I didn't take the stuff<br>because of that is anything to go by<br>then it it's a lot of<br>people yeah Round of Applause for that<br>as well<br>yeah and onto the broader picture of of<br>Drug law reform which is something I'm<br>interested in as well you know<br>um it's back to front in a lot of ways<br>in tun of the harm you know alcohol is<br>is legal and does the most harm and<br>Other Drugs like MDMA are very low but<br>they're highly<br>illegal the national conversation<br>required to change that is that<br>something that you can see happening in<br>Alo New Zealand or is that too hard if I<br>get my way it'll happen and it will<br>happen soon um we we actually have<br>started this ball rolling already you<br>know your stuff has been doing a series<br>on the misuse of drugs act you should<br>read it it's interesting in<br>um and today we published an article in<br>which we described the misuse of drugs<br>act as a legislative dumpster fire that<br>needs to be yeeted into the sun um<br>thanks<br>R this this is the attitude we're taking<br>it is wrong it doesn't work and it needs<br>to go it needs to be replaced with<br>legislation that is based around<br>well-being that is based in evidence<br>and that it is ministered administered<br>by a Ministry that is not the ministry<br>of Justice because at the moment what<br>they're doing is Injustice and so yeah<br>I'm I'm on a mission and I'm going to<br>fix<br>that and what advice do you have for<br>other people who are um mature is one<br>word or who are maybe thinking later in<br>life to go to university for the first<br>time or for the second time but<br>particularly in your case for the first<br>time you know what sort of words would<br>you have about what Victoria university<br>did did for you for someone thinking<br>like<br>that I would say it's definitely worth<br>doing because when you study later in<br>life you know what you want you know<br>what you want to learn you know what you<br>want to achieve and being the annoying<br>adult student that makes all the kids<br>roll their eyes and go oh God hurry<br>again is actually you're getting what<br>you want out of doing that and who cares<br>what they<br>think you know it is weird walking into<br>a classroom when everybody's younger<br>than your kid um and and acting like you<br>belong there because there is a certain<br>amount of hey why am I here I'm too old<br>for this but actually the the the tutors<br>and the lecturers really appreciate<br>someone who actually asks questions and<br>if you you get what you want by doing<br>that so yeah my my advice to anyone<br>considering to go studying at all<br>yeah well that seems like a good place<br>to leave this interview thank you very<br>that</p></main><footer style="margin-top: 2rem; background: #0001;
