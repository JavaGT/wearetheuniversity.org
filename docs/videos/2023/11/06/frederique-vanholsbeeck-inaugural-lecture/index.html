John hosking I'm de of<br>science here at wi up tomato University<br>of Oakland it's my very great pleasure<br>to welcome you to theal lecture of<br>Professor frer<br>Ben Fred is from Belgium she started as<br>an architecture student but switched to<br>physics when she realized that she was<br>more interested in space and astronomy<br>than design in<br>houses while space that's the upward<br>space motivated her initially her work<br>moved biological modeling of lungs and<br>this shift was clearly successful that<br>she won the Belgian physical Society<br>prize the best Master's thesis in<br>experimental<br>physics from there Fred moved into the<br>world of optical telecommunications and<br>nonlinear optics for her PhD also in<br>Belgium but she returned to biological<br>applications when she was appointed to<br>elip here in Oakland in<br>biophotonics she's built a highly<br>successful biophotonics uh research<br>group focusing on areas such as<br>bacterial monitoring and food safety and<br>collaborates broadly in<br>cross-disciplinary teams with colleagues<br>in ABI engineering<br>eiu and anatomy and Medical Imaging for<br>those of you outside the university uh<br>ignore the acronyms they mean they have<br>meaning within the place just<br>suffice to say she collaborates with a<br>lot of people in different<br>disciplines along the way she picked up<br>the 2020 nzas P Tinsley award for<br>outstanding fundamental or applied<br>research in the physical natural social<br>sciences published by a scientist within<br>15 years of their<br>PHD carrying on the good work Fred's<br>ability to collaborate broadly and build<br>teams also led her to appointment as<br>director of the dod wall Center the<br>national Center of research Excellence<br>focused on Phonics and its<br>applications she's a highly successful<br>grant winner and I note that her salary<br>is currently 95% supported by external<br>grants despite that Fred's a committed<br>educator receiving a Dean's award for<br>sustained teaching Excellence she took<br>the lead in developing a medical physics<br>and a imaging technology pathway and her<br>mentoring of students has been<br>recognized by being highly commended for<br>the Miram<br>excellence and science mentoring award<br>from the association of women and<br>science Fred's other passion however is<br>equity she helped lead the physics<br>department through the cl's bronze and<br>then later silver Awards Rec recognizing<br>the Department's commitment to equity<br>and spent three years as associate<br>associate equity and inclusion uh I'd<br>note that was particularly through the<br>the very difficult Co years so it was a<br>very important role during that period<br>Fred's still not convinced she knows<br>what a real physicist is was going to<br>attempt to answer that question in her<br>yours thank you for the really really<br>really nice introduction um yeah no I<br>need to leave up to head so what's a<br>real physicist that's my title probably<br>because I don't look like<br>one<br>so so I come from Belgium like John said<br>and while I grew up in Brussels and<br>that's where I was educated I really<br>spent a lot of my time in oton which is<br>in the Sou part of uh Belgium and I had<br>a lot of fun with my cousins that's<br>where my grandparents used to live so<br>that's really where I really enjoy<br>spending time as a kid so I do have a<br>river because we have rivers in Belgium<br>we don't have mons in Belgium<br>so that's why my PPA is missing a<br>Montaine sorry and I I don't want really<br>to claim oaka which is where I live at<br>the moment so I've always been really<br>good at matths and physics<br>but somehow I wanted to be an architect<br>because I really was inspired by godi<br>and orta orta is a Belgian architect<br>godi is Spanish and um here is me with<br>godi and here is my sister with orta<br>so I can Define myself as a field<br>architect but okay as a<br>physicist and I think it's part of why<br>did I decide to go for architect first<br>where I couldn't draw a bow basically<br>and I let's go and ask the expert about<br>what's a real physicist and maybe we<br>want we might wonder why I didn't start<br>by doing physics when I get out of high<br>school being good at math and physics so<br>as the expert according to my students<br>and my<br>kids Wikipedia Google and Chad GPT so<br>Wikipedia uh it starts quite well<br>because the physicist is scientist who<br>specialize in in the field of<br>picture well do but then it goes on I<br>think the definition is quite good<br>people review Wikipedia all the time so<br>we can TR like if we can use Wikipedia<br>we can actually trust it a b and some of<br>my colleagues might be interested about<br>what's the undergraduate curriculum the<br>standard curriculum in physics you need<br>a lot of maths to do physics but also to<br>do a doctoral degree in physics you can<br>do that in a very very broad range of<br>fields including biological physics and<br>chemical physics that's another note to<br>some of my colleagues and I really like<br>someone someone must have decided to<br>counterbalance the<br>pictures I'm just saying but it's<br>cool so Wikipedia<br>Google so that's what a physicist look<br>like according to<br>Google<br>well there is a guy who is not<br>white but don't worry he lives in the<br>US actually his uncle is a very famous<br>physicist who actually was the first so<br>his uncle is raan and he was the first<br>Asian to get a Nobel Prize in 1930 but<br>obviously Google decid to get the guy<br>who ended up living in the US second<br>line another guy of color lives in the<br>US oh a<br>woman<br>Maria you know that the stats till 2018<br>to get a Nobel Prize in physics was you<br>had to have a first name Maria or Mari<br>and be born in Poland so 2018 Donna<br>Strickland break a statistical<br>anomaly she was the first woman to not<br>be called Maria or Mari and got a Nobel<br>Prize in more than 100<br>yes she was also the only third one but<br>anyway<br>so Google is highly bias everyone ended<br>up living in the US and that's because I<br>asked the question physicist in English<br>right<br>so from from Japan but ended up in in in<br>the US I didn't know her from<br>China she doesn't even have a dates but<br>she's from the<br>US like the the only one who didn't end<br>up in the US in that list is liis mner<br>and you could write a Le like there are<br>probably many books about her you could<br>write a lecture she was not even allowed<br>to be an academic at the University in<br>Pria because Pria wouldn't allow woman<br>to be physicist and Max plant who<br>collaborate evily with her was quite<br>happy with the situation but happy to<br>make<br>exception I leave it<br>there then I decide to ask Google in<br>French to see if I could get a different<br>bunch of people they definitely the same<br>color they're a bit more European and we<br>finally have Mari C the other Mari born<br>in Poland so yeah so Google I didn't go<br>onto the links but just the pictures<br>were quite telling so I asked Chad GPT<br>what's a g a<br>physicist and<br>actually and I it's only the second time<br>I use CH GPT<br>but not too bad especially the last uh<br>paragraph it's important to know that<br>physicists come from diverse backgrounds<br>and may have varying interests within<br>the field of physics the term will<br>physicist is somewhat informal and<br>doesn't have a strict definition<br>ultimately anyone who is dedicated to<br>the study of and practice of physics can<br>be considered a real physicist if they<br>meet the qualification and actively<br>contribute to the field in some<br>capacity<br>there are some bets in that definition<br>that I would agree for and the good news<br>is that chpt is a big statistic engine<br>so that means that it's actually<br>evolving and so that's the question is<br>like is jbt about the reflection of a<br>changing time or is better at knowing<br>what I care about than<br>Google it's all about algorithm right I<br>mean John will probably agree with me so<br>what's really physicist if you look at<br>the definition from the expert a degree<br>in physics research in various area in<br>in depth Lage of theory good and mats my<br>do experiment to proof Theory<br>communicates the results publish results<br>and disseminate and is curious and<br>creative so you don't need to be a white<br>guy living in the US to be a physicist<br>that's the first Ru and I have no<br>disrespect for Albert Einstein he is a<br>really good physicist but he's not the<br>only<br>one so I think that's brings us to the<br>importance of role model right is that<br>we need to have role model so that we<br>can identify to the people and we can<br>believe that we can become physicists so<br>I always want to bring my grandmother<br>she was super strong she was really<br>dedicated to her success our kids and<br>then us our grandkids she didn't really<br>go to school but she definitely was<br>there to make sure um we succeed my mom<br>as well who managed to be here tonight<br>she<br>did she she actually uh participate in<br>an election one year H uh you can guess<br>which<br>party it's not any of the one we won<br>last weekend just to be clear and case<br>you had any doubt about where I get that<br>from<br>and and I think also I want to to<br>acknowledge two Role Models I had during<br>my um education in physics I had<br>Christian V aqu vilair and uh Christian<br>velt and I think you can tell from her<br>eyes that you don't mess with<br>her and she she like both of them had<br>been head of department and I think<br>that's that was probably really<br>important for me uh sticking to physics<br>and then uh ended up doing a PhD and so<br>this is slide directly from my PhD<br>defense I'm a big fan of comics because<br>that's a big thing in Belgium and so I<br>use gestone with a very very clumsy guy<br>uh all the way through my PhD defense we<br>have a public defense in Belgium after<br>the private one and it's so much fun to<br>be able to do like today to share with<br>your family uh and friends and so uh<br>that's one of the slide to explain what<br>my PhD was about so my PhD was about<br>telecommunication trying to get one<br>message to the other side using a heron<br>amplification so this guy the uncle of<br>the other guy the one who actually lived<br>in India till the end of his life and<br>also uh was an amazing<br>scientist uh for his so I did my PhD at<br>the University of Brussels in<br>collaboration with Alcatel before they<br>get they went bust because of the<br>telecon bubble that was my PhD the<br>Telecom bubble that's another an story<br>was the University of franch con as well<br>uh and I was part of a sort of research<br>center of excellence the photo networks<br>but the Belgian version so that's my PhD<br>thesis and I said we have a Public<br>Defense so we I obvious obviously had a<br>PhD supervisor and one of the treat for<br>your public defense is that your<br>supervisor get to make a presentation<br>about you as a person so I st one of his<br>slide from so that's my PG supervisor<br>Philip holey and he was also a really<br>good supervisor and he used gesto as<br>well to describe me and that's the like<br>it's in French because I didn't change<br>anything and he was wondering if he<br>could compare the sense of order of<br>Gaston with mine and that was a picture<br>of my desk back<br>then anyone who has been in my<br>office it hasn't changed so yeah I think<br>that um<br>yeah anyway my post do after my PhD uh I<br>did follow someone halfway around the<br>world uh trying to make the best of it<br>right so that's he got a permanent<br>position and uh so when I was talking<br>about role model I also need to mention<br>Champion so uh John Harvey was there I<br>think he really wanted to get Stefan to<br>be there<br>so he got me a job at least like first a<br>post do then a threeyear position and uh<br>the rest is history but he got me a job<br>also got me into some research with the<br>up<br>Thro it did get me a job using I think<br>the argument that they needed to hire a<br>woman in physics and also to maybe go<br>towards the biology because that was a<br>good way to attract more women but it<br>work thank you so thank you<br>John this is not a Critic at all so<br>anyway John at the time was supervising<br>din Tha didn't look like that 20 years<br>ago that's a recent picture with Bruce M<br>and it was about using an all fiber<br>system to measure fluoresence in the<br>heart to measure C cardiac action<br>potential so that was uh clearly biology<br>thanks to that I got my first Mars and<br>fun it's a fast start at the time it was<br>only two years and only 7K 70k a year a<br>bit less than now but it was good it was<br>also fun to look to think about how to<br>do research and kids at the same time I<br>basically<br>submitted yeah they look a bit different<br>now so basically I submitted the mar<br>when the one with the green was I was<br>pregnant with him when I submitted the<br>final proposal so I had an extremely<br>long fast start way because I could get<br>keep asking for variation which is good<br>like the maren has been really<br>supportive I could ask for variation all<br>the time uh the one thing that I<br>discover is that in New Zealand there<br>were a bit behind in term of women's<br>right especially working women's rights<br>so the charter was in the<br>1980s asking for chare in the<br>1980s there were uh<br>and um you know stuff like abortions<br>contraception that's the<br>1980s it was a bit of a shock there was<br>no real parental life parental um uh<br>like paid parental leave in New Zealand<br>when like it's still not a whe pit par<br>Le sorry but anyway luckily shortly<br>after the the birth of my first child K<br>arrived she's not here tonight but I<br>want to thank her because was good to<br>have a second woman in the<br>department and luckily uh Vivien has<br>always been in mat so and and she's been<br>working tremendously like a lot to uh<br>help women in the physical science and<br>organizing woman's Retreat and so on and<br>for those of you who were at her<br>inaugural she did mention the time<br>thingy about them so it was good to have<br>those women around and especially to be<br>the only woman anymore that's the end of<br>my feminist R for<br>now I will talk about<br>science so basically I started by mainly<br>doing so I had to switch gear uh that<br>was the deal you get the position but<br>you need to do b photonics or B physics<br>so I decide to go to B photonics since I<br>was an expert in at least nonlinear<br>Optics so I started with two PG students<br>who are here um and at the back no saram<br>at the front just this picture is<br>completely Hong in term of health and<br>safety but at the time we just did it<br>ourself in the lab so anyway nobody was<br>home and Norman was the third one who<br>came just after and he's here where is<br>he where are you<br>Norman<br>Norman came all the way from the US so<br>thank you uh yeah he was my third ever<br>phg student um and so nowman we started<br>collaboration with SP nson with ABI the<br>Oakland B engineering Institute I'm<br>still working with Paul and with uh Andy<br>I started working with Simon Swift yeah<br>I don't know if I took the hair color<br>from him or not doesn't matter uh and<br>and I think that's how the B fenics<br>group started right is that with with<br>those collaboration with external<br>collaborator people who were oh actually<br>Paul is a physicist I think Simon is not<br>a physicist he's a microbiologist so<br>that's how we started the Bing groups<br>and the way we work with uh in in the<br>the B photonic groups is really we image<br>what people want so we tell our system<br>to what they need and we try to use<br>multimodal and Innovative approach<br>that's a a good sentence to put in a<br>grant by the way to get money so we use<br>Optical current tomography microscopy<br>spectroscopy fluoresence and<br>microfluidics and ters and I will try to<br>give you an overview of what we're doing<br>with those technique and so basically<br>the motto is how can we extract<br>meaningful information from the light<br>after it had interacted with the sample<br>that's really the the the the one core<br>of our research and so that's the kind<br>of uh system we study okay so it's quite<br>varied from artwork to food knees ear<br>bacteria and even uh<br>yogurts and that's when I start talking<br>about someone else research so pretty<br>much all the slides from no one it's are<br>not mines but I have stolen them with<br>permission I hope they all in the home<br>anyway so so uh food safety that's one<br>of the the the big Topic in our group or<br>was at at least to start with so um and<br>I have been working and I forgot to put<br>Jess in this slide so apologize<br>apologies I think you are in the room I<br>saw you<br>sorry um so we we worked on uh food<br>safety and basically is how can we<br>detect uh bacteria or microorgan<br>organism on food because that's what<br>make them go bad and unfit for uh eating<br>right so the whole thing was<br>about rapid non-invasive detection uh<br>method for bacteria in um in in food and<br>it's important to point out here that so<br>I never mentioned it I came to New<br>Zealand 2003 got my first Mar in<br>2006 it lasted a bit more than two years<br>thanks to my kids so by 2010 I had no<br>more money and it was really hard<br>because when you get no money for<br>funding it's really hard to be a<br>scientist in New Zealand there is no<br>background research money so basically<br>you kind of manage the way you you can<br>get through I did get a little bit of<br>research money from uh Paul Nelson that<br>I mentioned before but 2014 that's when<br>I got rich and that was the start so the<br>dot War Center was funded I got my MBA<br>research money for the food safety uh<br>thing two millions<br>yes 2015 a year later I got another<br>Marsden and 2016 I was part of the food<br>uh safety uh science and research center<br>and and that's the the the problem when<br>you are scientist is that it's not just<br>your talent it's a lot of chance and the<br>chance of being funded so it's 10%<br>Talent 50% chance and then 40% hard work<br>to get that money and and without the<br>money especially in experimental uh<br>physics it's really hard so<br>anyway we got the money on the motor<br>that we were going to do food test food<br>safety testing a lot faster the current<br>situ situation being that if you want to<br>make sure that the meat is safe you do a<br>swab you put that swab so swab you just<br>put a cotton<br>swab on the meat you put it in in pepton<br>water you send it to a lab a guy or a<br>woman uh look at a plate and see uh how<br>many bacteria have gone and it takes<br>actually two days and so what we we sold<br>was that we could try to make it 15<br>minutes using<br>fluoresence turns out we didn't manage<br>that but we did discover a lot of really<br>interesting science about bacteria and I<br>discover a lot about bacteria they never<br>de like where is someone yeah someone<br>has been trying to explain the bacteria<br>for 15 years now still not getting<br>that's okay anyway so fluoresence you<br>need dyes okay and so we use S and acing<br>orange which is what Simons Simon calls<br>the first generation D so basically what<br>they do is that they go through the<br>membrane of the bacteria and stick to<br>the DNA that's why they call a nucle<br>acid based D and they glow when they<br>stick to DNA so you can tell they have<br>been attached to DNA so you get a signal<br>and then you have a second generation<br>which is for example propidium iodite or<br>pi and those that di doesn't get into<br>the bacteria very easily it needs the<br>membrane to be broken and so but it's<br>much better at sticking to DNA than cyon<br>and so it kind of kicks out cyon to<br>stick to the DNA and so you get a pi<br>signal and so that's when you can tell<br>that your bacteria is dead or alive and<br>so that's that was the the basics of our<br>research using a bunch of dye look at<br>bacteria concentration viability and<br>spaces okay yeah and so basically this<br>curve the red curve is the live curve<br>and when the bacteria is dead and Pi get<br>gets in this is the blue curve and so<br>and you can get anything in between when<br>your population is half death half death<br>half<br>alive and uh we call the adjust the D<br>ratio and that's a research that was<br>really uh led by one of the my P<br>students U Rachel or Fang who and kushla<br>was really deeply involved and so she<br>calibrated all the experiment she had a<br>lot of amazing um ideas and she did a<br>really great job in her um PhD and I CAU<br>up this year with her she's doing super<br>well now in the Netherlands where she's<br>working um uh for a a spin out so she<br>did some of the calibration and then<br>journy also worked on the calibration<br>and looking at uh antibiotic efficiency<br>so so what we did is that we looked at<br>uh food safety then realized that it's<br>really important to know if a bacteria<br>is alive or dead and then we realize<br>that it's actually quite important to<br>know if an antibiotics is efficient and<br>so that's why we started looking at uh<br>antibiotic efficiency and so what we we<br>we looked at is that if you<br>to measure the fluoresence of your<br>bacteria at the start you see that the<br>treated one so the one that have that<br>are subjected to antibiotics or here is<br>a propenal and the one that are<br>untreated so they are normal you have<br>the same concentration of bacteria and<br>if you look an hour later you can see<br>that the one war that you try to kill<br>you have a big reduction of signal so<br>you can tell very quickly because that<br>result comes in 15 minutes you can do<br>very quick you can tell very quickly<br>that an antibiotic is efficient which is<br>really good when you have a patient and<br>you want in the hospital and you want to<br>treat it treat them very quickly okay so<br>you take a swap you test the antibiotics<br>and hour later you can tell yes this is<br>the antibiotic because because the plate<br>count will take two<br>days um so that works well with is aenl<br>because makes the membrane porous so Pi<br>gets into the cell it works really well<br>as well and that's that was the work<br>that Julia Robert Robertson let it works<br>really well with ellin which is a litic<br>OT antibiotic so it's an antibiotic that<br>kills the bacteria by breaking it apart<br>so it breaks the membrane so Pi works<br>well doesn't work really well when uh<br>Canin is used which is another type of<br>antibiotics who doesn't bring the<br>membrane just stops the bacteria from<br>reproducing and so that's where we have<br>a problem between the physicist and the<br>microbiologist is that they don't have a<br>definition for death of a bacteria<br>because they say oh membrane is is<br>intact it's alive and but it's not so<br>anyway so and the<br>dye the Dy they use doesn't tell you the<br>the real through because the plate can<br>tell you something different and and so<br>that's when um the s becomes fun and<br>that's when uh Craig started his spe is<br>supervised by Kisha mainly and what he's<br>looking for that's one aspect of his PhD<br>is what what's the signal of death in<br>the bacteria that we can use to attach a<br>Dy to it so that we would have a good<br>dye to look at a bacteria Val viability<br>and so that's what he's looking at he's<br>been um doing some some experiment with<br>bacteria killing them with heat killing<br>them with antibiotics and then it does<br>proteomics and um I for I just forgot<br>the second name anyway is's looking for<br>the genes and the<br>protein at when the bacteria are dead to<br>look if there is a wheel signal of death<br>that we could use to uh to tag that with<br>uh a dye and so that's a work that he<br>does in collaboration with another of of<br>his supervisor Karina<br>taskova so bacteria mon<br>monitoring uh and and we still looking<br>at can we monitor bacteria and it's in<br>solution it doesn't work so what we have<br>been looking at is doing flow citometry<br>on a chip so lab Labon chip is something<br>that you may have heard before so<br>basically what we try to do or what<br>we're doing is we put the<br>bacteria into a microfluidic so that we<br>can really just measure a small focal<br>point and measure the bacteria<br>concentration and tell if the swab is<br>safe or unsafe if you can eat the food<br>or not and also because it's a swap it's<br>quite uh dirty and so you need to<br>actually do some designs to clean the<br>the swaps from the debris and only have<br>the back here and measure we just uh<br>that in your in your swabs so Sam has<br>been working uh on developing a system<br>to measure uh bacteria in swabs with the<br>microfluidic with a pump uh so that it<br>can uh look at the limit of detection<br>and detect a very small amount of<br>bacteria turns out that we cannot go<br>below a, uh bacteria per male and a<br>thousand bacteria per male you you don't<br>want to eat that so we need to go a lot<br>below that so that's when I say it<br>didn't really work at least the way we<br>thought it would it would work and and I<br>think that's what people need to<br>understand about science is that we have<br>good ideas we discover a lot of cool<br>things along the way but not always what<br>we plan to and um it still uh does do uh<br>good signs and so that's when another<br>aspect of uh Craig PhD was about Optical<br>tweezes and that was to complement the<br>microfic system so Optical tweezers it's<br>another Nobel Prize in physics two guys<br>one guy sorry anyway uh Optical tweezers<br>if you shine a really really intense<br>Beam at a bacteria you can or a particle<br>you will just trap it that's what an<br>optical Tre s and that's what uh uh<br>Craig has been working on so he's been<br>building that system uh it was first a<br>summer project from Leon and so here you<br>see those are Beats they're a lot more<br>fluorescent than bacteria and you can<br>see that you can trap them and then if<br>you move them that's where the Trap is<br>you see that uh it stays where they are<br>and so you can basically uh trap<br>bacteria and that's one of the thing we<br>were trying to do so the collaboration<br>between Sam and and Craig is to combine<br>the flow Cy the the flow cytometer and<br>the optical trap to whenever we get one<br>bacteria trap it measure it and so it's<br>there long enough so that we can measure<br>it and that's working process now I will<br>switch gear completely no more<br>demography most of you have who are<br>wearing glasses have hat and OC taken of<br>your eyes it's the analog the optical<br>analog of ultrasound so ultrasound sound<br>very long wavelength it goes very deep<br>into your body but doesn't have a very<br>good<br>resolution Ultra OC Optics it's much<br>shorter in wavelength okay so it doesn't<br>go as deep in your body so the<br>difference in scale is like an entire<br>human body<br>that's ultrasound that's the back of<br>your retina that's as deep as you can<br>get with o c but the resolution is much<br>better and that's the kind of system you<br>see in Optometrist so the resolution the<br>depth resolution is between 10 three and<br>10 microns and the Imaging depth is<br>about 2<br>mmers and um that's a dedication to<br>Norman that's the first decent image we<br>ever get from Norman that the system we<br>built but yeah I think it's cool and<br>that shows you what we can get with OC<br>so no Norman is actually the the first<br>one we built a decent system in my lab I<br>would say we still use oh until last<br>year we still used it so it's go it's<br>just retti now 10 years later and and<br>then Bastian um to took over and so one<br>of the thing we focus on with OC is on<br>what we call non-communicable disease<br>why is because those are the disease<br>that it's really hard to tell when<br>people get them because they're not uh<br>we just gone through a pandemic so we<br>all know what a Comm communicable<br>disease<br>is like earring loss and ostearthritis<br>we don't know why people get it but they<br>do get it and and those come sometimes<br>can be silent right so one day you wake<br>up and you cannot hear same with the is<br>by the time it's painful your knees are<br>probably in a very bad<br>shape and uh a lot of people end up with<br>either hearing loss or osteoarthritis<br>and the basically the only way to to do<br>something about it is to detect as early<br>as as as possible and and so that's one<br>of the thing we're working on is how can<br>we understand if there is a signal for<br>the onset of those<br>disease<br>so one of the uh project I'm currently<br>working on is Imaging the Hong window<br>and that's a project led by auna who is<br>here as well<br>somewhere yeah there she's the head<br>flowers<br>uh and so the she she she she's amazing<br>to work with because she does all the<br>planning and everything you just need to<br>show up to meetings and with a few image<br>and she's happy so that's that's what we<br>do so basically the idea is to look at<br>the the Run window membrane to<br>understand or earring loss can appear<br>she can tell you much better about like<br>she can tell you about it much better<br>than me and uh so that work is with uh<br>so vanika was our MSC student last year<br>Aruna is really leading the diagnostic<br>part Peter who cannot be H KN is also a<br>really nice colleague and obviously<br>kushla is always there so it's a good<br>way to show you the difference between<br>the different systems we have in our lab<br>so o you can use different wavelengths<br>to do OC and the different wavelengths<br>will give you different information so<br>the central wavelengths will give you<br>how deep you can go and the resolution<br>and here you have the difference between<br>two system one is Center at 800 and you<br>see that you have a really good<br>definition of the membrane but but you<br>see nothing beyond the membrane this<br>system the 1300 system you it's not as<br>good but you go a lot deeper and so so<br>that's how you need to adapt the system<br>to what you want to see and so recently<br>that Norman that was one of the last<br>image with your<br>system and so we we started building a<br>new uh psoc system and Marco was also so<br>here tonight is our Le expert don't see<br>him I saw him before anyway and so we we<br>built uh we they built a new system and<br>that one is really the one who uh looked<br>after the the Imaging process and so now<br>that's the kind of image we can get of<br>the r window membrane so that's a fly<br>through uh it's a volume scan of what<br>you can get through the r window<br>membranes and so we can see some good<br>Det details and I'm sure Aruna will do<br>something good with it that's all I can<br>tell about this system but we have some<br>ideas that's really uh the start of of a<br>project here and we we we can um and<br>because we just like nice video it just<br>looks cool right so that that's a WR<br>window membrane rotating on itself and<br>that's a fightful because we can do<br>image processing oh yeah that one can do<br>and so the other big project that's<br>going on at the moment is about uh<br>articular<br>cartilage we all have them in our knees<br>this is the bone this is the cartilage<br>and what's really amazing for us<br>physicists in cartilage that there is a<br>lot of collagen and collagen is an<br>amazing molecule for a physicist because<br>it acts like a polarizer and it's really<br>well aligned in uh in in in cartilage so<br>it's very vertical<br>the the big problem that physiologist<br>and people looking uh researching<br>cartilage have is that doesn't have a<br>lot of blood supply it doesn't have a<br>lot of nerves and that's why pain comes<br>very late basically when the cartilage<br>has disappeared so that's what LT<br>cartilage look like as it gets Degen<br>degenerated it become to swell it soften<br>and then at some point it disappears and<br>that's when it's painful and that's when<br>it's often too late and so there's a lot<br>of techniques at the at the moment to<br>look after osteoarthritis xrays<br>ultrasound MRI<br>microscopy uh and they all have<br>different scale and that's what you can<br>see here right so basically if you look<br>at this scale here you have the<br>invasivity so how much you have to break<br>apart like to to go into the sample to<br>see it and the resolution so you have<br>arthoscopy MRI ultrasound not very good<br>resolution but noninvasive if you go to<br>the invasive part you lose in resolution<br>and so that's why OC is not too bad<br>because it's not as invasive as<br>microscopy you don't have to take a bet<br>out uh but it has a good resolution and<br>as I said before as physicist that's the<br>way we see collagen um so we see that as<br>a wave plate for the non-physicists<br>today a wave plate is just a p<br>that look at the light and delay one<br>polarization compared to the other okay<br>so you send polarized light and you see<br>if one part is compared to the<br>other when it exits so you have the two<br>in PH here and the outter phas as they<br>get out and so what you can do is image<br>your cartilage from the top and from the<br>side look at the intensity image<br>intensity image in OC image structure no<br>difference<br>but if you look at the polarization<br>image you see a big difference and when<br>you see that bending pattern means<br>barrance means your system is optically<br>active so there is something going on<br>with the fiber<br>alignment and so that's really what<br>we're looking at with the the the<br>cartilage and so when we started working<br>on that with Matthew was another really<br>brilliant students that I shared with<br>ashin was here as well<br>where is he oh yeah and I did work with<br>you as well on on on on on cartilage<br>yeah so that's what we were uh looking<br>at uh and look at cartilage at different<br>stage IM Imaging uh look at the impact<br>of uh<br>the examine the impact response so this<br>that's what they call traumatic AR<br>arthritis so basically you can like from<br>what I understand you can get athritis<br>because you're getting old or because<br>you are too<br>you anyway so we were looking for<br>metrics can we get something out of<br>those OC image can we get a model and<br>understand our cartilage respond to load<br>and I think one of the favorite sentence<br>of ashin if I'm not wrong is and<br>understanding the M multiscale<br>cartilage did I Paras you well so anyway<br>one of the thing we did was image some<br>cartilage from um horses so basically we<br>do horses and coow because you we want<br>to have traumatic osteitis and old age<br>osteitis so the horses are the athletes<br>the cows are the old people<br>and so what you see here is some of the<br>image intensity bar<br>refringence so the the the the PS1 and<br>so what's really important is that if<br>you see that the surface is uh damaged<br>you don't need OC for that right so what<br>we were looking more at is really the<br>one that did look healthy from the<br>surface point of view but then the psoc<br>or the bar frency tells us that<br>something is wrong because we start to<br>see that bending pattern and so that was<br>a way for us for example to help to<br>decide which one you want to which<br>sample you want to look into more<br>details and so we had the thing that<br>visually it look healthy but the psoct<br>tells you that deep down there is<br>something wrong and it could be an<br>interesting sample so that's what a<br>healthy sample look like with<br>diic uh<br>so everything is the same size all the<br>way through you you have the articular<br>cartilage you have the bone and then you<br>have the transitional Zone and<br>everything looks healthy and there is no<br>barrance as soon as you have some defect<br>here so the surface is cool but what you<br>see here is that there is some defect in<br>the bone and clearly the bar refringent<br>image shows you something special and<br>clear and and then if you do the DIC<br>that takes a lot more time to get a DIC<br>image than no C image so that's why you<br>don't do that as often as you would do a<br>no C image um you you can see that<br>there's a lot going on you get a lot<br>more information from the DIC image and<br>that's why you might want to to do an<br>image this is one of the favorite image<br>from ashmin I think because that's a<br>very rare lesion a bon Mar lesion so<br>that's basically when there's some<br>defect uh that go goes into the<br>transition zone it can tell you<br>everything about it ask him but you can<br>see it on on the intensity image very<br>well so you can detect it on um the OC<br>image and the and the barrance image and<br>and same here um you like this one you<br>don't need OC but you can tell that<br>there is a lot of V fren going on here<br>it's a lot of bending patterns and so<br>but what's important is that you can<br>take a of image and do machine learning<br>AI everybody is talking about it except<br>that AI needs so much images that uh<br>it's not realistic because they're all<br>so different so what's really important<br>in what we do is that you really want to<br>do what we call parametric analysis so<br>what we do is that we transform the<br>image in a bunch of uh parameters and<br>that's what we do uh machine learning on<br>so we don't need thousand images anymore<br>to build a proper model so what we look<br>at is the<br>attenuation the surface irregularity and<br>the bar refringent so that a<br>polarization signal and and then we can<br>do some machine learning and clearly<br>distinguish between healthy sample and<br>unhealthy sample and then we can tell<br>ashin this is the one you want to look<br>at<br>right I will be tell off next week<br>that's<br>okay but so anyway so we've been working<br>with uh Matt has led a lot of the work<br>and uh we we started to understand<br>better what OC can tell you about<br>cartilage but at the end of the day what<br>ashin really want to know because that's<br>what cartilage are they are shock<br>absorbers right so what you want to know<br>is what's going on when they use a shock<br>absorber what's going on when you<br>compress the the cartilage and so that's<br>why uh Matt at the end of his PhD built<br>that system where he had a compression<br>head on his his OC and so he was<br>measuring OC he was taking OC image on<br>cartilage as you compress it and<br>measuring the<br>barrance okay so that's the intensity<br>image the barrance image and that's a<br>projection from the top and so you see<br>here that you have a really good uh<br>barrent image and so that's what happen<br>when you have a healthy cartilage and<br>that's what happen when you have a<br>degenerated<br>cartilage and I think you don't need to<br>be a physicist I hope to see the<br>difference between the really<br>symmetrical design you get with the<br>healthy one and the kind of fractal uh<br>design you get with the generate de<br>generated one okay and that's really<br>what happened here is that if you look<br>at the difference between the beginning<br>and the end of the compression phase at<br>the barrent signal you get a wey kind of<br>symmetrical pattern for the healthy one<br>and something um more complicated for<br>the degenerated one and<br>so again um we did some it did some<br>machine learning on this and and and was<br>able to classify uh just by looking at<br>uh the surface regularity the barrance<br>and the<br>attenuation and what uh we ashin is<br>really interested in is that Chon<br>pattern so basically the collagen is<br>stetch right when it's salty and when<br>you compress it goes uh like a Chevon<br>and so what's really important is to<br>look at the Chevon discon continuity and<br>when you have the gener cre cartilage<br>that's straight from one of his paper<br>you you get another pattern and so<br>that's our barrance image and that's why<br>we really wanted to have Dynamic uh<br>Imaging and so we applied uh so ashin<br>kushla Su me and two colleagues from ad<br>we apply for funding to the Maron and we<br>got it about developing an Imaging<br>platform um that do us mechanic<br>spectroscopy and uh<br>o that's what it looks like on<br>paper<br>uh and so the idea is to really have the<br>barrance and the spectroscopy and that's<br>the people working on it and that's the<br>first result as of two weeks ago or last<br>week so Danielle just started this PD he<br>did the DI image uh and Darwin got the<br>optical access so that's a novelty now<br>is that we can actually tell which way<br>the collagen is oriented with think and<br>what's really important is that we do<br>see that line here which is the line you<br>see here which is when the Chon disconn<br>continuity um happens so and but that<br>system also uh open new opportunities<br>because basically what uh we can what<br>Darwin has managed to do with that<br>system system is to look at the fiber<br>orientation and so potentially we can<br>tell the orientation of fibers like in<br>uh the brain here so that's something<br>that we are going to<br>explore I quickly go through a couple<br>more project we'll take two minutes<br>don't worry I will not go over time so<br>using parametrical Imaging we have been<br>looking at meat quality that AB is here<br>as well and people from AO uh so we we<br>can tell meat people which meat is more<br>expensive or they can sell for a better<br>price that's how you get money in New<br>Zealand<br>right so we we can do a regression of<br>the on the the the meat uh the fat<br>distribution in in meat and um that's<br>yeah that's how you get money in New<br>Zealand the last quick thing is about<br>designing Pro uh system to look at the<br>brain uh that's uh with Juliet she had<br>an amazing idea about uh setting up uh a<br>a lab to of multiscale Imaging uh for<br>the brain so uh and to look at autistic<br>syndrome and spinal cord injuries so we<br>ended up building a two Photon<br>microscope and a mesoscope so that's<br>what the two Photon microscope work look<br>like it was actually an ID started by<br>Norman a long time ago but then we<br>recycle it uh we worked uh with an Neil<br>on finding the right lasers to do two<br>Photon microscopy so two Photon<br>microscopy means you get deeper into the<br>brain so you can see uh other stuff that<br>you would see with a normal microscope<br>and also the system here that we have<br>can hotate so the the the the the mice<br>and the Rats can be alive and and doing<br>stuff and you can rotate the microscope<br>around the head and uh and then you can<br>image that part of the brain so we do<br>see someone our own it's still work in<br>progress for the the the microscope but<br>the mesoscope which is mesoscope means<br>the best of both world you try to have a<br>a field of view as big as possible while<br>having the best resolution uh possible<br>so like in physics the it's really hard<br>to get the best of ver world so the M<br>the miscope is an attempt of getting big<br>field of view and high<br>resolution and so that's what we did<br>with uh this system we build a system<br>that has two field of view and two<br>different uh<br>resolution and uh that's the kind of<br>image so the the comparison between the<br>two field of view uh on the same slide<br>from like a slide from a brain so that's<br>ex Vio but then<br>um uh there were some image taken in<br>Vivo so that's like a still like that's<br>in mous that's in hats and that's what<br>you see so you can see which part of the<br>brain lits and then Juliet can tell you<br>everything about<br>it<br>anyway I'm a real physicist I don't know<br>but I know for sure that we shouldn't<br>stereotype because it kills creativity<br>and uh creativity I I think success is<br>10% um talent but a lot of chance you<br>need to to meet the right people at the<br>right time and a lot of our artwork and<br>it's not just your work it's the work of<br>a lot of people especially when you do<br>experimental uh physics uh yeah it's<br>really important to choose decent<br>collaborators there is a rule to beer in<br>a dog do you know that<br>one only work with people that you can<br>have a beer with and that you would<br>happily give your dog for a<br>weekend not your kids don't worry<br>guys just your dog if you have one and<br>and I think it's important that we<br>encourage Ro model and Champion either<br>being one or just acknowledge the one<br>and Empower people to be and I really I<br>think I have standard for diversity and<br>Equity I did work a lot for the<br>Department I was lucky that uh Richard<br>um put me in charge I was lucky or it<br>was just more work for me don't know uh<br>in charge of the equity committee that<br>became a proper um it was an equity<br>working group it became a proper<br>committee right Dion yeah another person<br>I should have put on the slide and and<br>Jen after that also like has always been<br>an advocate so so I think the department<br>of physics is very different from what<br>it was 20 years ago when I was the only<br>woman<br>um but Peter has always been on Al Li as<br>well he here um so uh I have all the<br>work I like I might not have mentioned<br>Everyone by name tonight and I want to<br>apologize but uh I have uh many<br>physicists and scientists who have<br>worked with me over the the years that's<br>a bunch of picture from my group we like<br>to celebrate success and stuff so we<br>often go out or we do writing Retreat<br>and so on I also want to thank some of<br>my colleagues who are from overseas and<br>who have been standing for<br>um uh science Integrity diversity and<br>inclusion<br>um so and I apologize if I uh have<br>forgotten<br>anyone sorry and obviously my family<br>some of them are here tonight and U my<br>sister here with our family as<br>well and that's it for<br>me thank you Fred that was great do we<br>experiment I think we started by looking<br>at bar refrance and see what we see and<br>then we start building the project the<br>the mechanic the dynamic aspect of it<br>came later but yeah talking with<br>EXC<br>cell I personally I'm personally not<br>looking at cancer at the moment there<br>are people looking at cancer using<br>OC especi like uh so there are people<br>looking at<br>cancer because you can do elastography<br>with OC so you can compress a a a body<br>part and see how it react and measure<br>the stiffness which is what we want to<br>do with cartilage right and if you do<br>that on a tumor tumors are stiffer than<br>uh normal um organs so there are people<br>doing elastography on cancer and that's<br>so there is the one of the person we<br>work with in ad delate has developed a<br>needle Pole<br>to look at the brain brain tumors and so<br>to help surgeon delineate tumors in<br>surgery by looking at the the tumor<br>during during the surgery rather than<br>doing a biopsy that's wonderful thank<br>question thank you for the I'm<br>interested in knowing whether one of the<br>patients<br>C<br>yes I mean yeah but if you want to kill<br>bacteria you would use UV light because<br>that's a lot more<br>efficient uh<br>like we so I didn't say that but we use<br>infrared light so you kind of cook them<br>rather than breaking them apart but uh<br>so that's part of the the thing that um<br>you need to be careful about is the<br>energy level you use yes but to kill<br>bacteria uvite would be a lot more<br>efficient last last<br>question no no no that's that also we we<br>take that from buter like abat so that<br>at the moment we don't need um<br>ethics be before doing that on on on<br>Sample for which we need etics yeah no<br>we we are long way away from live Ming<br>that's like a 15 years plan I will be<br> by<br>then I'm RAR next to you<br>uh the life of a Dean is one of the<br>Curious pleasure it's uh taken pleasure<br>in the the Fantastic people work in the<br>faculty and uh Fred is one of those<br>people she does fantastic work and<br>explains it really well so why don't you<br>join with me and thanking Fred for the<br>do<br>and keep an eye out for the next in Aug<br>lecture I'm not quite sure when the next<br>one is Charlotte is November 21st<br>November the 21st and who's<br>that sorry oh Carrie loms right so do<br>come along listen to that one and thank<br>you again for thank<br>you thank<br>you<br>than</p></main><footer style="margin-top: 2rem; background: #0001; padding: 2rem; text-align: center;"><p>We Are The University</p><ul style="list-style-type: none;
