But much how later? This may sound like a mad science experiment, but it is one that we are all taking part in, with potentially devasting consequences for the planet. Carbon dioxide levels in our atmosphere are at their highest since at least three million years ago and rising at an unprecedented rate. Sea level rise resulting from the collapse of Antarctica’s marine-based ice sheets remain the largest uncertainty in assessments of future sea level rise risk. Despite the uniquely rapid nature of this current climate change experiment, Earth has experienced shifts in atmospheric carbon dioxide in the past, creating natural experiments to investigate how the Earth’s climate and ice sheets have responded. <br><br>In this lecture, Professor McKay examines the geological evidence for how Antarctica’s ice sheet has responded to a shift in greenhouse gases through geological time. He will explore how this hard-won data has fundamentally altered our understanding of how quickly and extensive ice sheet melt could occur in the future.</p><h2>Transcript</h2><p style="opacity: 0.9;

community and in<br>particular the friends and family here<br>to support one of our newest professors<br>Robert McKay my name is briany James I'm<br>the new Provost here at Tanga and it's<br>my very great pleasure to be able to<br>introduce Professor McKay director of<br>the Antarctic Research Center and<br>professor of<br>geology an inaugural lecture is a Fant<br>fantastic event where someone who has<br>likely given hundreds of lectures in<br>their career gets to give their first<br>public lecture as a professor the<br>highest academic rank you can achieve so<br>it's an opportunity for the whole<br>university community and I mean the word<br>community in the broadest sense to come<br>together and celebrate Robert's<br>achievements and also an opportunity for<br>Robert to share his story and Link it<br>back to his friends family colleagues<br>and students who have part of the<br>journey along the<br>way Professor McKay is a distinguished<br>expert in Antarctic research with his<br>years of research experience experience<br>focusing on geological and climate<br>change effects on the Antarctic ice<br>sheet Robert studied right here at<br>tianga Walker for his bachelor's and<br>Masters of Science in geology he then<br>completed a PhD in geology and worked as<br>a ma as a research fellow here before<br>taking up the role of lecturer in 2012<br>the journey from lecturer to Professor<br>in 11 years is frankly meteoric and<br>reflects an international reputation for<br>research Excellence this is reinforced<br>by the Trove of accolades and awards he<br>has received over the span of his career<br>including the prime minister's mcdermut<br>emerging scientist prize the prime<br>minister's science prize and the<br>American geophysical Union asahiko Tyra<br>scientific ocean drill research prize<br>that is a lot of<br>Swag he is not a desk researcher more of<br>an action man at least an ican um and as<br>the leader of the international ocean<br>Discovery program which is one of the<br>largest International research<br>collaborations in earth science he<br>sailed in 2010 to wils land in a remote<br>bit of East Antarctica and in 2018<br>amongst other trips he led the $18<br>million us iodp EXP expedition to the<br>Ross sea in anartica to capture past ice<br>sheet and ocean<br>interactions our university community<br>benefits greatly from Professor McKay's<br>knowledge and expertise he is obviously<br>in great demand and highly sought after<br>and he's been invited to speak and<br>present at numerous events across aloa<br>and the world so this evening I'm<br>thrilled to have the opportunity to hear<br>from him and in tonight's lecture<br>Professor m will present the geological<br>evidence for how Antarctica's ice sheet<br>has responded to a shift in greenhouse<br>gases through geological time he will<br>explore how this hard one data has<br>fundamentally altered our understanding<br>of how quickly and extensively ice sheet<br>melting could occur in the future please<br>McKay<br>otoo<br>Oto well thank you Bry that's um it's a<br>lot to live up to there um yeah it's a<br>little bit hard to sort of hear all that<br>sort of said about yourself um first of<br>all thank you all for tuning out on<br>Halloween as you can see I've dressed<br>for the occasion um just like to<br>apologize to my two children for missing<br>out on trick or treating tonight so we<br>can make sure we play them with lots of<br>sweets after after the talk um thank you<br>all to to friends and colleagues that<br>have turned out as well tonight um again<br>I know that it's um hard for some of you<br>to listen to me talking for over almost<br>an hour um yes so the title my talk is<br>how to melt an ice sheet and this is a<br>little bit of an opposite world to what<br>I normally live in which is why do we<br>even have ice sheets in the first place<br>so a lot of my research is actually<br>quite academic Focus just looking at the<br>history of those ey sheets over millions<br>and millions of years and as this sort<br>of emerging threat of climate change<br>which has now become emerged we've<br>actually realized there's quite a bit of<br>relevance to these past climate<br>histories um and the the challenge that<br>we have is trying to still out some of<br>those really long-term processes that<br>occur over geological time scales and<br>thinking about what are the implications<br>over decades to centuries and they're<br>not always so easy to distill so I'm<br>going to focus most of this talk on this<br>question how do we actually melt the eye<br>sheet so it's a a small part of some of<br>the overall Suite of um research that<br>myself and my students and my colleagues<br>do in the<br>a now come from a a pedigree if you want<br>to call it that or a fuera within the<br>arc around the specialization that we've<br>we've found a global nich for which is<br>the geological history of that I sheet<br>through geological drilling so I've put<br>here my two sort of key mentors and I<br>haven't showing all my mentors because I<br>couldn't fill up the whole screen<br>there's a huge suweet of people<br>internationally and nationally that are<br>contributed to the research I'm going to<br>show but here we have Peter Barrett the<br>inaugural director of ton the Antarctic<br>Research Center Peter will be here<br>tonight he's just running a little bit<br>late and for those that know<br>Peter that is true to form him so he is<br>um he will be here from all accounts so<br>um yeah it's great that he he still<br>keeps us active and on our toes um so<br>Peter really revolutionized this field<br>he was in the same year became director<br>of the Antarctic Research Center in 1972<br>he also sailed on that ship there the<br>glomar Challenger built by Howard Hughes<br>and was the predecessor of the<br>international ocean Discovery program<br>the DC drilling program and on that<br>expedition was the first one down to<br>Antarctica that discovered the Antiquity<br>of the ice sheets went back tens of<br>millions of years rather than the few<br>thousands of years they had thought<br>previously and so he spent much of his<br>his career chasing the Holy Grail of<br>when did those ey Sheets first develop<br>and why and there's things like changing<br>carbon dioxide in the atmosphere as one<br>component but there's also those<br>tectonic plate tectonic motions that<br>have fundamentally changed the way heat<br>is distributed around the<br>planet so that led him on a journey to<br>develop these new platforms where we<br>drill through floating ice and so in<br>some cases it's sea ice which is only a<br>few meters thick a lot of technological<br>challenges there and so within that<br>group we also had Alex Pine who was<br>developing Drilling Technologies to<br>really do something that globally no one<br>else was<br>doing and that culminated in the andal<br>project which was when I came into my<br>PhD project in the mid<br>2000s and that was under the guidance of<br>here he is<br>here just talking you up um so that was<br>under the guidance of Professor Tim n<br>you're taken over the mantle from from<br>Peter both as director of the Antarctic<br>Research Center but also this technology<br>to draw through in this case a floating<br>ice shelf which was a huge challenge in<br>its own right and then you I became<br>director four years ago and just prior<br>to that sort of L my own drilling<br>expedition to Antarctica along with a<br>lot of other help from International<br>colleagues so that's a bit of my journey<br>here um a lot of the work I do is also<br>we'll go back is understanding that that<br>connection of the ice sheet to the<br>oceans and the global climate so we<br>think of Antarctica at the bottom of the<br>world but that's not the way I think of<br>it I think of it at the center of the<br>world and if you look at it from this<br>perspective you can see why it's<br>connecting all the large ocean basins on<br>the planet and the ocean basins are how<br>heat is distributed globally around the<br>world so if Antarctica expands it can<br>potentially restrict that exchange<br>between those ocean basins if it<br>contracts we can have better exchange<br>between those ocean basins and so what<br>happens here is that's regulating heat<br>transfer between the two<br>hemispheres if you think of that in the<br>New Zealand context look at us there on<br>the side of the Pacific the biggest<br>ocean Basin you can imagine that<br>interplay of Antarctica Contracting<br>potentially more of a tropical influence<br>on New Zealand so those are some of<br>those connections and a lot of guidance<br>there from Professor lonardo who was in<br>the office next to me for many years<br>understanding those connections but I'm<br>not going to go down that pathway I'm<br>going to look at the obvious connection<br>that we think of in New Zealand with<br>Antarctica which is it melts it rises<br>sea level and so I put in there for<br>scale the size of the Moon and you can<br>see it's a similar sort of scale to<br>Antarctica that's how big Antarctica is<br>and it's 4 km thick in I sheet in places<br>so if that was all to melt it's 58 M of<br>sea level<br>rise so our challenge is going how much<br>of that is vulnerable to Rapid collapse<br>and Retreat going forward in the future<br>now there's no way all that's going to<br>melt with climate change so don't panic<br>um we think it's the orders of meters<br>maybe so where did this journey really<br>begin I saw Matt Patterson come in<br>before there is um and this is sort of a<br>changing world as well this was 1998 as<br>a master student um three students we<br>had a couple of weeks of Peter Barrett<br>and and a Dutch researcher up in the<br>mountains a professor but three students<br>never been to the isop for dumped up in<br>the mountains left the camp and explore<br>and map it was fantastic um it was a<br>real journey of Discovery both<br>personally as well as scientifically<br>um and it's something that you know<br>everyone that's been down there as a<br>student sort of takes this as one of the<br>sort of changing points in their lives<br>we hear that time and time again from<br>our alumni so it's always been a sort of<br>a trying to um you know pass carry this<br>forward put this pay this forward take<br>students down with us we're still taking<br>students down with us every year and a<br>lot of the work I'm going to show is<br>actually been led by students within our<br>group so I really want to emphasize that<br>we give leadership roles to students and<br>they<br>flourish<br>now the reason I started that Journey<br>there was because I also wanted to say<br>what do we know about the Antarctic ice<br>sheet at this point in time in 1998 and<br>there was this very divisive argument<br>it's called the serus group debate I'm<br>not going to mention the serus group<br>anymore but it went from this idea that<br>there was one po of researchers have<br>said that ice sheet has been stable<br>hasn't changed for 14 million years the<br>dry valleys have been dried it hasn't<br>rained it's a polar desert there's been<br>no melt and there was another group of<br>researchers that had a different line of<br>evidence that said said actually we<br>think there's been collapse of what we<br>call the Marine based sectors of all of<br>Antarctica and by Marine base this is<br>where the ice sheet is sitting on the<br>Earth's surface below sea level the<br>important aspect there is it's connected<br>it's touching the ocean and we all know<br>if we put an ice cube in a glass of<br>water it's going to melt a lot quicker<br>than it will if you just leave sit it<br>leaving on a bench so the ocean carries<br>a lot of heat and heat is what melts an<br>ice<br>sheet so this was a very divisive<br>argument we actually Peter was my master<br>supervisor we actually were leaning<br>towards that stable side at that point<br>we thought the evidence was Stronger we<br>thought the dynamic argument was a<br>little bit flawed in some of its<br>arguments and we still you know maybe<br>they were right for the wrong reason so<br>that's something we were always kept in<br>the back of our minds so we're parked<br>that but that's where we were over 20<br>years<br>ago so let's get to the key question how<br>do you actually melt an i sheet let's go<br>mad scientist now and for Greenland it's<br>actually relatively straightforward<br>relatively you turn up CO2 you turn up<br>the way that the Earth is absorbing heat<br>in the atmosphere and you're melting it<br>from the top down so we can measure<br>surface Mel in Greenland we can actually<br>see it there's a river on the surface of<br>that ice sheet and that water percolates<br>down to the base of that ice sheet and<br>it creates a slippery bed so that ice<br>sheet starts to slide faster it's kind<br>of like putting oil on a fry pad it<br>moves around so it slides faster into<br>the ocean and it melts because it slides<br>it's also like deflating of balloon the<br>ice sheet sinks and so it goes into a<br>warmer air mass and so you get this um<br>positive sort of feedback loop where the<br>ice sheet continually melts and so we<br>can actually measure that we think the<br>Melt going forward in Greenland's going<br>to be pretty linear through<br>time so that's projected that's built in<br>pretty nicely into ipcc the<br>intergovernmental panel on climate<br>changes assessments on future climate<br>change the Antarctica is a little bit<br>different so here we have Rising CO2 in<br>over 20 years it's increased by about 50<br>Parts a million and this is the mass<br>balance of the ice sheet in Antarctica<br>so mass balance is whether or not it's<br>gaining more mass through snowfall<br>versus what's being melted on Ice<br>shelves and carving of<br>icebergs so I was sitting relatively<br>stable in the early part of the the<br>century but then you can see it's<br>rapidly<br>accelerating and you can see the areas<br>here where it's going red to Yellow<br>that's where the ice sheets<br>melting so there's a couple of<br>observations you can do here you can go<br>where is it melting and it's not it's<br>melting in the areas where there's none<br>of these fringing gray zones and these<br>are what we call the ice shelves these<br>are the floating component of the ice<br>sheet so it's melting where those ey<br>shelves are not there and I'll talk<br>about why that's important in the next<br>slide now where there's no ice shelves<br>and it's sitting on the Sea on the Earth<br>surface below sea level it's those are<br>the areas where it's melting so even in<br>here this is the the weak under belly<br>with the Doomsday glacia region of West<br>Antarctica that that's been in the<br>meteor a lot but there's also areas in<br>East Antarctica where it's melting so<br>losing mass the Aurora sub glacial Basin<br>and wils land sub glacial<br>Basin so this is West Antarctica mostly<br>below sea level and if that was to melt<br>it's about 3 m of sea Lev rise if all of<br>the Marine based ice in Antarctica was<br>to melt it's 19 M of sea Lev<br>rise that was that argument about a<br>dynamic ice sheet that all 19 M of that<br>go as recently as 3 million years ago<br>geologist stream of the years who quite<br>recent<br>um now I put CO2 in there and you go<br>okay there's a linear Rel almost a a<br>quasi linear relationship there between<br>CO2 and that I sheet acceleration we<br>don't think that's the case there's a<br>bit of a lag here the CO2 is warming the<br>atmosphere that gets into the ocean and<br>the oceans are carrying heat to the ice<br>sheet but there's a bit of a time delay<br>so there's a lot of built-in warming<br>that we're worried about we could turn<br>off CO2 and still that heat is going to<br>be going up next to that I<br>sheet<br>so let's talk about that that's looks<br>catastrophic when you put those big red<br>valleys in there there's not a lot of<br>sea level RIS in there at the moment<br>it's relatively small amount of retreat<br>but this is the last and I shelf breakup<br>in the early 2000s and what happened<br>here was this is quite a northern part<br>of the Antarctic Peninsula region and it<br>got above zero in summer so there was a<br>surface melt water on the ice shelf and<br>what that did was it filled up crevasses<br>in that ice shelf and water is denser<br>than ice so it's sinks and it pushes<br>those crevasses apart and this ey shelf<br>exploded like a set of dominoes over the<br>space of a few<br>weeks now this is a poster child for<br>climate change a lot of you have<br>probably seen this but what this did it<br>didn't raise sea level on its own right<br>that eye shelf is<br>floating but the glassiers on land are<br>sliding into that ocean that ice shelf<br>as they come into the ocean the ice<br>starts to spread and as it spreads into<br>these embayments it hits the walls of<br>the embayments and it latches onto it<br>and it holds on so it creates this<br>buttressing effect it sits there and<br>holds back the glassiers from sliding<br>into the ocean behind it if you remove<br>that buttress that ey shelf those<br>glassiers speed up and in this case they<br>speed up by an order of magnitude so a<br>10-fold<br>increase so that's one way we can<br>melt the other one is two I want you to<br>remember for this talk I shelf<br>buttressing the second one is this thing<br>called<br>mizy it's an acronym we use it's become<br>common in our world it means Marine ice<br>sheet inability and this is a very<br>specific process<br>whereby these ice sheets are not just<br>sitting below sea level but the B that<br>glacia gets deeper and deeper as it goes<br>in land several kilometers below sea<br>level as you go<br>Inland now they're currently sitting on<br>on highs on the sea Flor so these little<br>ridges we get a little bit of warming<br>and we trigger Retreat off that Ridge<br>what happens is you expose more and more<br>of that ice to the ocean more and more<br>of that to that<br>heat so it's not been offset by<br>increased snowfall you're getting more<br>melting you're getting more melting at<br>that ice front not being offset by<br>accumulation and it gets deeper and<br>deeper so it becomes run away and it<br>accelerates and it runs away so much you<br>can even turn off that heat Supply and<br>it will keep<br>going so it's quite simple physics there<br>um that's our big concern have we<br>triggered that Retreat already some<br>people have argued we've already<br>triggered it in that doomsday glacia<br>region I showed earlier that big red<br>spot<br>still debatable but some people argue<br>that so where do I come in where do we<br>come in with Drilling and so this is<br>where I came in with the Andre project<br>so quite a few years off between there<br>and the Masters<br>project and we decided to drill under<br>that I shelf well I didn't Tim n did and<br>Ross pal Peter Barrett gave me a phone<br>call when I was living in London said<br>you want to come and drill under an ice<br>I said sure that sounds like fun um and<br>it was it was a remark project this was<br>a world first no one had ever done this<br>before can't believe how lucky I was<br>looking back on this it seemed take it<br>for granted at the time and Alex Pine<br>here has been a St wart for this you can<br>see him here looking particularly happy<br>as always um along with the the crew<br>from Websters drilling who have been<br>long-term partners for us at um in the<br>Antarctic Center and they developed this<br>method where they could drill through a<br>nice shelf they would drill through<br>using hot water drill hole they would<br>just drill blast the ice away they<br>weren't capturing that lower piped to<br>the Sea floor and collect 1.3 km of<br>sediment from the sea FL and almost a km<br>of water depth and almost 90 M of ice<br>shelf now some technical challenges that<br>I shelf is Flowing remember how I said<br>it's flowing it's g at half a meter per<br>day so you get a Big Bend in your drill<br>pipe and you're trying to bring up 6 met<br>bits of core at a time you only get a<br>couple of months to do that um so it's a<br>huge achievement looks simple in paper<br>again that was a massive project and<br>just point out Ross power the other<br>co-chief again Victoria University<br>graduate who's gone on to do amazing<br>things globally so we export our<br>knowledge globally as<br>well so what did I do for the<br>PHD was a sedimentologist and sediments<br>document what type of environment<br>they've been laid down with and on a<br>continental sha in Antarctica it's quite<br>simple not as simple as this but there's<br>some details Devils on the details but<br>under a big ey sheet if there's a bigger<br>ey sheet than present they override that<br>drill site it's going to be carrying<br>gravel sand and M it's like a bulldozer<br>just picks everything up puts it at the<br>drill site now in its current situation<br>there's very weak currents under that ey<br>shelf and so it's carrying muds and<br>suspension it just gently deposits the<br>stra of mud and every now and then<br>there'll be a pebble in that floating<br>ice and it'll drop out an impact into<br>the sea Flor that's called ice after<br>debris now when we have no I shelf we<br>end up with these yellow deposits and<br>these are things called dioses This is<br>plankton that's living in the ocean<br>surface it dieses it settles to the seaf<br>Flor and it shells are preserved these<br>are celicious shells<br>photosynthesizing a really important<br>part of the global biological system and<br>carbon<br>cycle so as a setlist I get the colors<br>the the coloring pencils out and I draw<br>colors of what the core looks like to<br>simplify it down and each of these<br>colors I'm going to say as a<br>depositional environment where we have a<br>big ey shelf big IE<br>sheet an ey shelf over the site so we're<br>Drilling in this region of the Ross ey<br>shelf<br>here and then when we have these yellow<br>deposits we can affer there's a collapse<br>of that ice sheet behind it<br>and this is because of that butting<br>effect of the ey shelf so at the same<br>time we draw andril ice sheep modelers<br>are starting to develop this<br>understanding of the physics of when it<br>goes from an ey shed on land where it's<br>sort of tumbling down off land in a<br>vertical way versus spreading ey shell<br>that was quite a complex problem for<br>them to solve and they showed that yes<br>you lose that ey shelf you do indeed<br>lose that but effect and that Marine<br>base ice behind it so that's how<br>we expand our results out to a<br>continental scale it's not<br>perfect but it's the best we can do at<br>the moment I'll show some ways that we<br>can attest that further now look at this<br>ice stream model there's not much<br>happening in East<br>Antarctica keep that in the back of your<br>heads um I'm going to segue a little<br>little bit into what we did in 2018 with<br>the IP Expedition that I co-lead with<br>Lara Des santis here from Italy and one<br>of the great things about working<br>internationally is you on these<br>International projects is you're working<br>with people from diverse cultures and<br>age groups as well so there's students<br>there from all around the world as well<br>as professors professors and so here we<br>spent a lot of time trying to work out<br>how to drill in the outer R SE usually<br>there's R SE ice but then there was a<br>catastrophic drop in sea ice year we<br>went down so we paid half a million us<br>for an icebreaker to support us into<br>that that that region we didn't need it<br>because the CIS had gone due to climate<br>change so one positive for me for<br>climate change but that's pretty<br>selfish um but what we're trying to do<br>here was not look at the physical<br>footprint of ice sheets but we're trying<br>to understand what the triggers were for<br>triggering that collapse that initial<br>Retreat of the outer Continental shells<br>of Antarctica the shallow water 500 to<br>1,000 met water depth before you're<br>going to 4 km on the<br>offshore and so these arrows these are<br>the along sight currents in Antarctica<br>and these are wind driven the winds<br>around Antarctica pushed the water<br>around that circular continent it's like<br>a giant<br>centrifuge so centrifuge push waterers<br>North and that's replaced by water<br>that's upwelling from dep and this water<br>at depth is actually a couple degrees<br>warmer than the surface waters that's<br>what we thinkink is triggering that<br>initial Retreat and then these other<br>feedbacks the ey shelf butene Marine ice<br>and stability kick in and take over so<br>here we're just trying to understand<br>that response could we see triggers for<br>that initial Retreat as well as you<br>changing amount of ice on the<br>Continental shells you may be changing<br>how much Antarctic bottom water is<br>forming this is the dense salty water at<br>the bottom of the ocean that stores a<br>lot of heat and it stores a lot of<br>carbon dioxide so again there might be<br>natural cycles once we start to a tread<br>I sheet that could change that whole<br>natural carbon<br>cycle so we drill to test this up to 4<br>km water depth on these ships and you<br>can see it's a big string of<br>spaghetti we lower that down 20 M at a<br>time on these huge drill strips we get<br>to the sea floor and this here firing a<br>piston core so this is a huge um pipe<br>that's 830 M long here it's got a card<br>cone drill B on it and we fired a peston<br>four down it so what we've done here is<br>we got a tube of metal it's Hollow we<br>fired pressure down of drilling fluid<br>it's popped a couple of pressure release<br>pins and fires that 9 and 1/2 M into the<br>sediment we then take this big heavy<br>duty drill bit and drill over that 9 and<br>1/2 M hole pull the core up to the<br>surface lower another core down fire<br>another one 9 and 1/2 M draw down over<br>the top of that and we do that<br>repeatedly until we get several hundred<br>met below SE<br>floor and we recover dropa lots of it<br>after 5 kmers on some of these<br>Expeditions and so we have a drill ship<br>full of scientists about 30 to 40 of us<br>on there we get the CES to the surface<br>we cut them in half we described them so<br>you can see muds here with gravel and um<br>here's Molly Patterson a former student<br>Mara um we have penologist Dave Harwood<br>the person that came up with the<br>original Dynamic Retreat of the ey sheet<br>hypothesis real time age models we're<br>understanding what age those sediments<br>are within a few hours of them coming to<br>the core surface we have instruments to<br>measure the magnetic field of that of<br>the the cause when they're put down so<br>that gives us an idea of age models as<br>well so we can tell exactly what time<br>period we were in and that really guides<br>where we're going to drill the next site<br>pretty<br>much and so this is what we're trying to<br>do we're trying to go back in time tens<br>of millions of years potentially into<br>climates where CO2 has been higher than<br>present and where temperature has been<br>higher than<br>present and so we can choose little<br>snapshots we can choose our sort of<br>natural climate experiments to see how<br>did the Earth system<br>respond and so 50 million years ago we<br>had carbon dioxide over a th000 parts of<br>million and this is from global global<br>records in the depostion so these are<br>records I haven't produced it's a<br>summary in the ipcc assessment report in<br>2023<br>22 and you can see it's a th parts of<br>million in this and higher 50 million<br>years ago and this is called the aene<br>time period so we're going to look a<br>little bit of that now the ASM was very<br>different we still had Guana land was<br>still breaking up um we still we we we<br>had seaways through the Mediterranean<br>and the like so it was a very different<br>tectonic setting and we actually<br>probably had no I sheets on the planet<br>to begin with so we we got a different<br>starting condition so it's not a perfect<br>analog for the<br>future we can go into 400 to 450 part<br>per million worlds 20 million years ago<br>and as recently as 3 million years ago<br>that was the last time we think we went<br>over 400 parts per million CO2 we're<br>currently at about<br>420 and then for the last million years<br>we've been sitting below 200 0 parts of<br>million we fluctuating the natural I<br>Cycles from 180 to 280 parts of million<br>so we look at that now the context here<br>is when we go into the ipcc future<br>scenarios this is changing the time<br>scales from millions and thousands of<br>years to hundreds of years and so by<br>various emission scenarios depending on<br>which pathway we choose to take and I'm<br>just going to say the numbers 2.6 is a<br>number where basically we're meeting the<br>Paris climate agreement we're limiting<br>global warming to below 2° preferably<br>1.5° above<br>pre-industrial 4.5 is exceeding the<br>Paris climate Target about<br>3° so with this scenario we we get Co2<br>up over 400 Parts 450 parts per million<br>and then we bring it back down so it's<br>called an overshoot scenario this one we<br>stabilize it at 500 and this is the 8.5<br>now some people call this business as<br>usual it's actually the continuing<br>emissions unabated um I don't think<br>we're going to be able to do that to be<br>honest I don't think there's enough<br>fossil fuels to actually do that and I<br>think we will adapt but it gives you<br>that end member so don't panic when you<br>see 8.5 but it does say if we don't<br>change our Behavior or there are natural<br>feedbacks in the climate system we don't<br>expect we should still be considering<br>it and we can run models out you can<br>show models are getting similar<br>temperatures to what we see in the air<br>scene in these<br>scenarios but do remember that some<br>parts of their system take Millennia to<br>catch up to that that climate warming so<br>you probably can't melt all the East<br>antarctic ice sheet in 100 years even<br>though the temperatures are the<br>same<br>so at the end of the last ice age these<br>are some of the climate experiments so<br>20,000 years ago we had a big Ice Age<br>CO2 was 180 parts per million and then<br>it Rose to<br>280 so here we had big isak in the<br>northern hemisphere So Below 280 we grow<br>big ice in the noral hemisphere and sea<br>levels we're 120 M 130 M below present<br>and over 12 to 13,000 years they Rose by<br>120 and 130,000 years uh meters so that<br>gives you a meter per Century of sea<br>level rise is a standard rate of retreat<br>for a glacia to delate even with only<br>100 parts of million CO2 rise and we've<br>done 50 parts of million just in the<br>last 20 years 25 years so it's quite<br>dramatic but that's an<br>average the most accelerated Retreats<br>were 4 m per Sentry we had little pulses<br>where it just went crazy and so we<br>haven't dealt with those levels of<br>change right we started to get to<br>civilizations we developed Agri culture<br>because we can predict our<br>weather right so we've been very stable<br>relatively we've had some warm periods<br>but um nowhere near as dramatic as a 4<br>to 6 Dee global<br>warming so did Antarctica contribute to<br>that massive pulse of meltwater pulse 1A<br>14,000 years ago and this is a model<br>from Nick goge it's not my work but he<br>was forcing the size sheet model with<br>ocean temperatures offshore from other<br>paleo climate records drill core data<br>that was collected globally and he<br>showed there was a big pulse 14,000<br>years ago and the same time he published<br>that that a researcher in Germany had an<br>ice R debris record offshore of the<br>South Atlantic showing pulses and Ms of<br>icebergs occurring at that same time so<br>these ice sheet was purging itself of<br>icebergs and mass so he showed yes there<br>was a contribution to that meltwater<br>pulse so I was in the office next to<br>Nick and I said great model Nick it<br>really is it's fantastic contribution<br>but your eyes sheet seems to be going<br>too quickly once once you've triggered<br>that Retreat it runs away what I think<br>is too quick because we had drilled here<br>done a short settlement core preparing<br>for drilling my master student s s<br>Mass had some datable material in that<br>core and showed that the grounding line<br>these money deposits very close to that<br>ice sheet margin retreated Ross Island 8<br>and a half thousand years ago so it was<br>coming past in as model here 10 to<br>11,000 years ago so it was going too<br>quick so I said are your physics wrong<br>he said probably not the physics of the<br>I sheet but he had had some feedback<br>that he had had hadn't considered using<br>the right value for the the viscosity of<br>the Earth's mantle and that sounds weird<br>to go how on Earth does this liquid<br>layer beneath the earth's crust affect I<br>sheet<br>Dynamics and this is important because<br>East Antarctica is a big old ketonic<br>continent it's gried from Australia it's<br>basically Australia to the South it's a<br>rifted apart from Australia whereas here<br>this is actually a big volcanic Rift<br>system so it's a break up a Gana and<br>it's been going active over 100 or over<br>100 million years and so under this more<br>thinner continental crust and active<br>rifting processes the mantle has a lower<br>viscosity it means it's more<br>fluid and so because you got the solid<br>crust on top of a fluid in a in a mantle<br>the ice sheet loads up and it pushes<br>down on the earth crust it sits down and<br>cats this depression this is that<br>overdeepened aspect of of West<br>Antarctica now if that mantal viscosity<br>is lower it's more fluid it pushes the<br>Earth up quicker and so what this is<br>doing is it's creating less of that<br>Marine I sheet effect right so as that I<br>sheet is retreating the slope is not as<br>steep so it's not exposing as much of<br>that ocean to the I sheet so he ran it<br>with a different value so most of the<br>ice loss was in West Antarctica let's<br>use that value and we managed to match<br>the two data sets quite nicely so we can<br>still explain all that geological data<br>but it calibrated his I sheet model so<br>we know that I sheet not models not<br>responding too quickly going forward in<br>the<br>future so that's one example of using<br>now I said it's been quite stable over<br>the last 8,000 years one of the other<br>cores we looked at was offshore of this<br>part of East Antarctica this is a<br>remarkable core it was 180 M long but it<br>only measured 12,000 years at time which<br>is quite a unique record in Antarctica<br>each of these are summer and winter<br>layers so we could look at the changing<br>biological productivity offshore of<br>Antarctica at seasonal time scales for<br>the last 12,000 years and what we<br>noticed was there was a very strong<br>response to to Sea ice concentrations<br>biological productivity to elino<br>processes so we could actually see the<br>response of that but there was also a<br>baseline shift in sea ice production<br>about 4 and a half thousand years ago so<br>we went into this warm period but then<br>it suddenly got cold so the warming<br>triggered a cold<br>period and we realized a lot of our<br>signals we actually had a meltwater<br>proxy we could see looking at isotopes<br>of hydrogen which is a component of<br>water we can see what was fresh water<br>and sea water and we can see these<br>pulses of fresh water coming out up<br>until 4 and half th000 years ago and<br>then it<br>stopped just when the sea ice kept in so<br>melt water wasn't causing the sea ice<br>increase what it was doing<br>was we had an ice Cliff we had a big ice<br>what we call the ice off carving line<br>and grounding line we're pretty close<br>together and then as it deglaciated we<br>had this huge amount of melt water input<br>but it didn't create a huge sea rise<br>water and then we had a base of a nice<br>shelf floating on the ocean that was the<br>size of France and so what's happening<br>is the water's going under here we get a<br>little bit of melt at the grounding line<br>but then it refreezes back on all that<br>heat from that water has been exhausted<br>and then it gets super cold it goes to<br>-2° C and comes back out super cold and<br>it develop the sea ice<br>factory so this is another aspect that's<br>really missing in ice sheet models today<br>is that what we call Ocean ice<br>interactions how do the ice sheets talk<br>to the ocean and are there feedbacks in<br>there that could either amplify would<br>dampen future climate change so here we<br>think this Retreat actually caused a<br>cooling is why we had a warm period in<br>the mid hallene and then it went<br>cold so<br>counterintuitive now you go is this<br>going to save us in the future and<br>possibly if the rates Retreat are slow<br>enough but if we lose that ey shelf this<br>cooling feedback turns off and it gets<br>enhanced even further the warming so<br>this is possibly the biggest uncertainty<br>in I models and a whole Community are<br>working on trying to figure this one out<br>including people in our<br>group<br>the pling time period this was really<br>really where um a lot of my focus was on<br>early on in my<br>career plin is a time period of<br>geological Epoch 5.3 to 2.6 million<br>years ago and is the last time CO2 was<br>at 400 parts per millions in the<br>atmosphere and that resulted in a 2 to<br>three global warming 2 to 3 degree<br>global<br>warming so we're going to use that same<br>sent mapping technique now we're just<br>going to go to those colors that's why I<br>showed the colors earlier<br>I just want you to look at green here oh<br>sorry yellow um color blind sorry um so<br>the yellow is a retreat event and we<br>have natural I Cycles we know what<br>caused those those are changes in the<br>Earth's orbit um regulates how much<br>energy the poles receive so that's<br>that's been one interest but we're<br>already interested in what was the last<br>time that IIT collapsed what was the<br>physical evidence for that and so we're<br>at this place where there's the Blue Dot<br>and we see loss of the right side shelf<br>and collapse of the Marine green Bas ey<br>sheet behind it whenever we see these<br>yellow deposits that I'm going to draw<br>on our drill column so we call this a<br>stratagraph log and this is the only one<br>I'll show um this is 150 to 500 M below<br>the sea Flor in the Ros sea we H the<br>deeper down you go the further back and<br>time ago that the siment stack up on top<br>of one another and you can see lots of<br>those yellow intervals we had lots of<br>iceh collapse<br>events now because they were planked and<br>they got shelves we can actually look at<br>what types of shelves they were and<br>where they live today in the<br>and some of these shells lived north of<br>the Polar front where there's no summer<br>sea<br>ice that told us there temperatures 3 to<br>4° warmer in the Ross sea that time that<br>ice sheet collapse so Andel gave us not<br>only ice sheet collapse events it gave<br>us also the temperature threshold for<br>it we also use we pioneered the use of<br>lipids these are the remains of uh<br>single cell organisms that live in the<br>ocean and you can take compounds out of<br>them you can measure them on Mass<br>spectrometers and you<br>can um see the relative abundance of<br>certain compounds and make a direct<br>correlation to temperature for that so<br>that's really cutting edge it was still<br>big uncertainties at the time but we're<br>starting to resolve them and Bella<br>Duncan did a PhD on on trying to resolve<br>some of those um so these are the the<br>organic remains that don't have hard<br>shell preservation so combined these<br>diatoms and molecular fossils showed us<br>even in some of the later events the<br>waters were only 1 to 2 de warmer to<br>trigger that retreat<br>now that doesn't have to be a uniform<br>warming that can just be pushing more<br>heat up from a change in ocean currents<br>so that's one of our concerns it's not<br>necessarily going to be just a uniform<br>top down<br>warming so Andrew also West Antarctica<br>that was 3 m of sea level R out of that<br>um I said there's 19 M total of marine<br>based ice and so in 2010 for my postto I<br>went down with this great group of<br>people many of whom I still work with<br>very closely and we had to travel some<br>pretty rough material that was a rough<br>cruise that was 20 M waves at times um<br>some of the worst storms that that ship<br>had been through um but we were offshore<br>of the wils sub glacial Basin which is<br>one of the largest ones and this is the<br>area been proposed to De glaciate in<br>those early studies in '98 and we're<br>here so here we are so we can't do the<br>same thing as Andre we're on a drill<br>ship so we can't go under the ey sheet<br>and see if there was presence or absence<br>we had to do something<br>different and so we can do two things we<br>can look at these Pebbles and muds and<br>these Pebbles have been in the deep<br>ocean it's mostly mud you go away from<br>the ice sheets it's always mud<br>fossil here we got muds with big gravel<br>and this is icebergs passing out the<br>site dumping out material as they melt<br>and so we can see when we see these am<br>Mars of icebergs breaking out when we<br>have a catastrophic collapse of that ice<br>sheet so we can see pulses of them<br>they're very regular throughout the<br>score so my PhD student Molly Patterson<br>worked on that and then a colleague from<br>London was looking<br>at where the mud was coming from and so<br>the glassiers are most erosive at their<br>margin that's where they erod the most<br>material they erod Rock they grinded<br>into mud you can see it pulsing out of<br>the front of this glacia so where that<br>ice sheet margin is you can be able to<br>tell where the where the sediments come<br>from you should be able to tell where<br>that margin<br>was so<br>Tina all here we go so here's the<br>removing that ice sheet that's the<br>Bedrock under anarctica right so it's<br>Marine based in the sector of Works land<br>and Tina vanderford and I put her her<br>name up here cuz she's going to be the<br>2023 St Le lecturer in a month's time<br>she's also going to be the co-chief of<br>our space 2 sea drilling that we'll be<br>doing this year our new drilling project<br>and she came up with this novel method<br>to look at the mud while Molly was<br>looking at these ice raed debris events<br>in her her PhD and she's also going to<br>be a co-chief on that project so again<br>passing the mantle to the Next<br>Generation and so what we noticed was<br>there was these are Ms of icebergs and<br>then the mud Source changed it went from<br>Granite source which are the coastal<br>areas of the Bedrock under that ice she<br>to a Ferrar doite which is a dollar<br>right is a different type of plutonic<br>Rock so a volcanic rock that's you know<br>formed under rather an erupting it's<br>formed within the Earth so we could see<br>huge amounts of icebergs and then a<br>shift to this source of these Ferrar<br>dollarit so that meant we had an ice<br>sheet<br>margin that was well and truly in Land<br>by about 100<br>km so combined with andrel and wiand we<br>fundamentally changed the view of what<br>that IET looked like we really verified<br>that it was a dynamic IET it did melt um<br>3 million years ago in fact from that um<br>Providence work the the Ferrar dollar<br>right work as recently as 400,000 years<br>ago when it was actually less than a 2<br>degree warming and that's quite<br>concerning we didn't quite know how much<br>sea level right we could tell where it<br>was but it didn't really give us<br>magnitude of change so we enter into woi<br>Basin see Gary Wilson here did his PhD<br>in the woi Basin um we contined it on<br>Molly Patterson said I want to go back<br>and see if I can see these events so she<br>did a bit of reconnaissance work Julet<br>Seth and Masters and then Georgia Grant<br>did a PhD on a drilling project there<br>publish his P for in nature showing at<br>the same time we're seeing these<br>collapse events in Antarctica we had no<br>Northern Hemisphere I sheets to wor<br>about here then we had 20 to 30 m sea<br>level changes so that was loss of all<br>Greenland now I said that may have<br>collapsed 400,000 years ago this is what<br>we're doing this year with the S 2C<br>project this is a lighter weight drill<br>rig Darcy mandino in the room is<br>frantically trying to get the equipment<br>down to Antarctica um really novel<br>technology Richard Levy he will be given<br>as a noral next year um will be the<br>co-chief on that with Tina in the first<br>season so no doubt he will report back<br>on that next year so keep an eye on that<br>um that's our next next great adventure<br>trying to see if the heart of West<br>Antarctica went in a par in a in a less<br>than 2 degree warming<br>world so how does this relate to ice<br>sheets and well this is the um what I<br>she models do they looked at this data<br>and said we can't recreate that this is<br>what we get when we force our ice sheet<br>models under extreme scenarios of the<br>pling we can't get rid of that ice sheet<br>in WS land and so Rob dto a modeler in<br>America added new physics into his ice<br>sheet he they did this thing called the<br>Mickey right that's what Nick go likes<br>to call it because he wonders if they're<br>taking the Mickey with it because it's a<br>bit controversial but he's saying that I<br>can't actually can't sustain a cliff<br>greater than 200 meters it collapses<br>under its own weight and we see this in<br>Greenland the big controversy is does<br>that scale up to a<br>continent I'm kind of inclined to<br>believe that this is a possibility in<br>ipcc where as well they said 2 meters of<br>global sea rise by 2100 cannot be ruled<br>out if these processes kick in that's in<br>the ipcc that's these dotted lines and<br>it says low confidence not low<br>confidence because we think it's a low<br>probability it's low confidence in those<br>proc in our understanding of those<br>processes we need to learn more about<br>those<br>processes now next say you can do this<br>even without adding new physics you can<br>just change the way that heat is<br>transferred into that eye sheet so he's<br>doing it gives you a slightly lower rate<br>of retreat but it still gets us above<br>what the ipcc give us our range of of<br>less than a meter of c r by the end of<br>the<br>century so let's get a little bit more<br>academic let's look at a time period<br>when we've lost all our marine based ice<br>and we go to loss of of terrestrial ice<br>potentially and so with our Drilling in<br>2018 we we went to look at the mying<br>climate Optimum this is the warmest<br>climate since we've ice sheets on the<br>planet and it was a time period where we<br>saw a very rapid jump in CO2 from 280<br>parts a million which is the president<br>of glacial PRI to the pre-industrial the<br>Industrial Revolution to 800 Parts in<br>them very rapidly we think that was<br>probably driven by volcanic massive<br>volcanic eruption event in America it<br>was a 5 degree global warming and quite<br>sustained and a 60 M<br>cise so one argument was the sea level<br>record came out from an American group<br>very similar to what we did in wongi Bas<br>and he said it was a 60 M sea level<br>change across that event so loss of all<br>ice in Antarctica with 800 Parts within<br>CO2 now models can't do that they can't<br>melt an ice Sheed at 840 parts from<br>milon we drilled out here and we said<br>well there's no ice R the debris there<br>doesn't appear to be any icebergs in<br>this region so no glasses at the<br>coastline at the very least we had uh<br>diom so again we could get temperature<br>we had those lipids we could look at the<br>shells and actually measure what the<br>bottom water was it was 3 to 8°<br>temperatures in the bottom Waters of<br>Antarctica rather than minus<br>2 um and those shells also told us it<br>was actually much yellower water for<br>some reason so the glasses hadn't eroded<br>West Antarctica as deep as it is today<br>so it didn't have Marine I sh stability<br>back then it was actually Inland mostly<br>above above land was<br>mountains so this allows us this solves<br>a little bit of a problem for us we<br>go well we're drilling we're drilling up<br>in the the mountains as well um freeze<br>Hills work here that Bella Duncan and<br>and Richard Levy have worked Don Chris<br>Krauss was a master student working on<br>some of the stuff as well um they saw<br>there were presence of glasses in the<br>mountains so there were some ice around<br>and so the ice sheet models showed us at<br>8:40 it looks like that about 20 M of<br>ice left on the<br>continent and B's work showed<br>temperature and CO2 seemed to be in sync<br>throughout 55 million years of H history<br>they were in syn in the Ros sea<br>temperature went up down when CO2 went<br>down but ice volume didn't ice swum<br>seemed to be bigger when it was 280<br>parts million than it was today and the<br>reason is West Antarctica was all<br>mountainous it was a terrestrial West<br>Antarctica so glassier a road below sea<br>level over millions of years so went<br>from you know kilometer above above sea<br>level in places to several kilometers<br>below sea level and the conal shelves is<br>only a couple hundred meters water depth<br>as well so that meant you could get a<br>big terrestrial ice sheet growing in a<br>relatively warm climate and dipping its<br>toes in the water it wasn't susceptible<br>to Marine ice sheet<br>collapse so the work we did in um the<br>wils land uh sorry the IDP expedition<br>was we could map again using those same<br>provent sediment mapping techniques but<br>during the glacial period to show we had<br>a big erosion Source coming out of West<br>and to through the time period and we<br>had I sheets that were 80 M sea level<br>equivalent in what was a pre-industrial<br>climate so that gave us some confidence<br>that actually ice sheets do respond to<br>CO2 very strongly it just had a<br>different geological context to explain<br>that ice volume difference it also gave<br>us the confidence that ice sheet models<br>were behaving properly we were quite<br>concerned that they weren't melting all<br>that ice right cuz they say well<br>actually they've been un under sensitive<br>to climate change that would be a bad<br>thing they seem to be behaving well in<br>those warm<br>climates so last one really quickly the<br>airene time period 50 million years ago<br>this is getting really academic now a<br>thousand parts of million hopefully<br>we'll never get to that if we do we<br>definitely are doing a mad science<br>experiment now this was less of an<br>interest to me but I was on board the<br>ship when it happened the pale the<br>paleontologist person look at pollen<br>grains there used to be vegetational<br>Antarctica he looked down the microscope<br>and just went there's bowab trees in<br>this record there's palm trees it's 21°<br>in summer in this<br>area Bella and Richard Levy worked on<br>these things called glacial ER radics<br>these are big boulders that been plucked<br>up from the seaf floor and brought to<br>the surface by glaciers in recent ice<br>ages but it's picking up sediment 50<br>million years old doing our job our<br>drilling job for us so she mapped those<br>in her her PhD and her post showing<br>again these similar temperatures now the<br>reason this is important we think it's<br>lost all the ice that point so 1,000<br>parts of million we do lose the<br>ice but climate models need to get up<br>well over 2,000 to even 4,000 parts of<br>million to get those temperatures so one<br>of the big debates you'll hear is what<br>do clouds do do they actually cool<br>climate do they reflect more light back<br>into space because they're big white and<br>fluffy or is it water vapor which is a<br>more potent greenhouse gas and we think<br>water vapor seems to be a more dominant<br>control and amplifying that climate<br>warming yeah there are the palm trees so<br>that's warmer than Wellington right not<br>a good thing so what does this mean for<br>future C rise well I think the most<br>obvious one is that 400 Partland does<br>appear to be a long-term threshold for<br>Marine base I sheet loss the question is<br>how quickly do we get to that Marine<br>base loss can we starve it off for as<br>long as possible and what I would argue<br>is we need to prevent the loss of ey<br>shelves that's the fundamental thing if<br>we lose that Ross I shelf these<br>processes these fast acting processes<br>could kick in so the more we can slow<br>the rates of retreat the more some of<br>those natural processes like that<br>rebound of the earth following that Ice<br>Age removal that's a very slow process<br>over hundreds of thousands of years if<br>we melt that ice it quickly it's not<br>quick enough that response to to slow<br>down the rates of Retreats but over a<br>thousand years it will be so the more we<br>can do that the more we can help reduce<br>that Marine I sheet and<br>stability and the key to do that is<br>reducing emissions as much as possible<br>even if we exceed the Paris climate<br>Target so I'm not going to talk about<br>what this means for New Zealand because<br>that would be stealing Richard Levy's<br>Thunder and Richard is he's not here<br>tonight cuz he's having a bit of a<br>holiday before he goes down to<br>Antarctica for a few months um he leads<br>the New Zealand sea Rise program with<br>Tim n which was understanding how these<br>projections of sea rise are superimposed<br>on the variable uplift and subsidence of<br>New Zealand Juda tonic processes so the<br>vertical land movement and there's this<br>great mapping tool online on the New<br>Zealand seise um website that shows a 2<br>KET grid of what might be happening<br>anywhere around that<br>continent around our our country sorry<br>so so he'll talk about that in detail as<br>specifics about what this means for us<br>in the<br>future now the other half of my role is<br>managing this group of people director<br>um they make my job pretty easy because<br>they have a whole bunch of leaders in<br>that group exceptional bunch of<br>researchers a good mix of international<br>people that have come in as well as<br>growing our own early career research is<br>something that um I certainly got the<br>emphasis the importance of that from<br>Peter and<br>Tim so thank you there I just want to<br>thank some of our national colleagues in<br>particular GNA science who have been a<br>huge um collabor at with us over many<br>years developing these drilling projects<br>with us in sync my Australian colleagues<br>who who are work with closely on iadp<br>and our International colleagues we<br>can't do this as a single nation we work<br>intensively with America Korea Japan um<br>Italy and the like and again of course<br>also antartic New Zealand for allowing<br>us to get down to the ice and and being<br>great at facilitating all this<br>Logistics and finally just thank you my<br>family they can see they're hiding their<br>heads there um you know a long time away<br>from home obviously not just for<br>drilling but Al also organizing these<br>International projects see my kids are<br>not too happy about this um I think they<br>got every right not to be happy about<br>what we're potentially leaving them to<br>be honest um but we do I want to finish<br>on a positive note and I intentionally<br>put up this controversial model just to<br>annoy Nick goge who has already walked<br>off and discussed had to catch a train<br>to to wire up her um this is from our<br>American colleagues this is that extreme<br>scenario putting those extra physics in<br>and this is that low confidence this is<br>the worst case scenario and I put on<br>what we call RCP 4.5 this is exceeding<br>Paris 3° warming globally you can see<br>how much I sheet we're losing there if<br>we meet Paris keep it below 2° the the<br>2.6 scenario at the top we save that ey<br>shelf even in this worst case scenario<br>model we save that ey shelf so that's a<br>positive from this worst case scenario<br>model so to meet Paris we essentially<br>have to half emissions by 2030 and<br>time's ticking so um we have to keep<br>that pressure up to make sure that we<br>are meeting our obligations to do that<br>so thank you very much and thank you<br>attention<br>of Teno tenot<br>Teno my name is Peter Barrett I grew up<br>on a wo Farm in the<br>1940s discovered caving around white<br>Tomo in the 50s and then went to<br>Antarctica in the early 60s and I'm now<br>84 and a professor of geology and<br>ameritus professor and so you'll not be<br>surprised when I say tonight that I'm<br>very proud of my last PhD student<br>Professor Rob mcar<br>literally I have to share this Pride<br>with Tim n who is currently in<br>Europe um so it's really a an honor and<br>a privilege to propose a vote of thanks<br>to Professor<br>Rob for such a thought-provoking and I'd<br>say challenging lecture but um with<br>some moderately good news at the end<br>perhaps but I'm sorry I have to<br>acknowledge um Professor Bry<br>Jones also Maryland Street honorable<br>Maryland Street and Rob's wife Joe and<br>family and it's also great to see so<br>many colleagues<br>of friends of robs but also the wider<br>Wellington community<br>here so Rob's talk um has really I think<br>neatly summarized one of the two<br>existential threat of our<br>time the others being the nuclear threat<br>now as high as ever but in this issue of<br>avoiding future climate<br>catastrophe Rob's made it<br>simple it stop emitting greenhouse gases<br>and especially CO2 because of its<br>Millennial<br>Lifetime and so the core of his talk as<br>we've seen is how we can use a mix of<br>past record<br>courts from both uh ice and strata and<br>to constrain these uh models that<br>improve future ice and climate<br>predictions now keeping up with the<br>science is a remarkable achievement it's<br>25 years Rob since you were a young<br>Master student U I have to confess I<br>haven't kept up but you have so thank<br>you but it does remind me that uh you<br>started out in Antarctica by when we<br>walked 20 kilometers to the edge of<br>the Polar Plateau to put in a<br>frisbee uh to uh it had a serious<br>purpose it was to collect Dions that<br>were blowing out of the Polar plateau<br>and it had something to do with that<br>serious<br>debate but that also reminds me that<br>um earlier that season I was part of a<br>drug team off the Antarctic Coast Cape<br>Roberts project where we were looking at<br>climate between 20 and 30 million years<br>ago and um at that<br>time a knowledge of past temperature<br>modeling was nothing like it is<br>today in<br>fact I was able to fairly represent it<br>by a graph I drew up on the wall of the<br>Camp's dining<br>area with um it was actually for a<br>visiting minister<br>I think he's probably here today Salon<br>Upton uh temperature falling about 10°<br>over the last 50 million years But<br>Rising 2 degrees over the next 100 years<br>if we did nothing about it we knew that<br>then<br>admittedly not the way we know it<br>now but both data and<br>modeling have expanded astronomically in<br>their sophistication over the last 25<br>years as we've seen through through the<br>efforts uh a lot of it led uh by<br>Victoria but uh the Global Science<br>community and so we can now be much more<br>certain about the future and we can also<br>see that we haven't done enough about<br>it now Rob and his group the anti<br>Research Center are really world leaders<br>in evidencebased records of research and<br>climate and the results and<br>consequences I think are being very<br>clearly<br>communicated as we've seen this evening<br>so this work has to<br>continue so that the world knows what<br>it's facing in the next few<br>years but most of all it seems to me<br>that we also need comparable rigor and<br>transparency in our economic systems to<br>make informed decisions about providing<br>for a reduction in greenhouse gas<br>emissions and adapting<br>now we have to leave that to others<br>geologists can't do everything but I'd<br>like for a moment to return to Rob's<br>other qualities as a teacher and a<br>mentor I've had the privilege of<br>attending his fourth year classes in<br>recent years on Paleo<br>climate he sets both old and new but<br>always challenging papers for students<br>to<br>read but he begins by teaching them how<br>to read and is always patient and<br>supportive in fact he's a<br>master in balancing rigor and<br>Humanity so thanks Rob for this<br>opportunity to talk a little bit about<br>you and to thank you for a truly<br>motivational lecture and to invite you<br>the audience to join with Rob and me in<br>the hunter common room next door for<br>Refreshments but I must first ask you<br>all to show our gratitude to Professor<br>chck</p></main><footer style="margin-top: 2rem; background: #0001; padding: 2rem; text-align: center;"><p>We Are The University</p><ul style="list-style-type: none; padding: 0; margin:
