all uh made the<br>effort to come out so joining us to talk<br>through what the next government might<br>bring over the next three years uh and<br>what the Coalition negotiations uh and<br>other negotiations might look like uh to<br>my left of course we've introduced Liam<br>on the far left uh and N J and they're<br>both going to uh introduce uh themselves<br>and then we're going to jump into the<br>discussion I'll pass to you first great<br>hi Bron thank you so much for coming out<br>on this uh typ iCal Wellington day my<br>name is Jana tib sheni I'm uh the<br>Herald's Wellington business editor so<br>I'm a a journalist I'm based at the<br>Press Gallery across the road in at<br>Parliament um my job is perhaps a little<br>bit different some of the political<br>journalist because I'm in the in the<br>business team so sit in the business<br>team but I'm based at Parliament which<br>is I think is a really interesting place<br>to be I can report on um Economic Policy<br>uh Reserve Bank policy that sort of<br>thing things that affect the economy um<br>from Parliament uh prior to joining The<br>Herald I've only been there for a year<br>and a half I was at interest.co.nz which<br>is sort of a slightly more specialist<br>Finance publication um and I've also<br>done a bit of time at News Talk ZB and<br>what's now known as news Hub Nation so<br>that's just a bit about bit about me uh<br>my name's Liam here I'm a I've been<br>writing about politics um for various<br>Publications since about<br>2013 um I've I've written for for most<br>of them for Stuff um for news room for<br>the spin-off had along s with them the<br>guardian all the same ones that I think<br>you've cycle through Morgan but at the<br>at the moment I don't I don't have a<br>regular writing spot um I have my own<br>newsletter but I do quite a bit of<br>broadcast for you know radio and and<br>television so Q&amp;A um new subnation every<br>now and then um in new ZB and rnz um<br>noon that sort of thing so my<br>perspective is that I am National Party<br>member and I've always it's always been<br>my Niche to write about the national<br>party and the national party's<br>perspective on things um and so I'm very<br>much an opinion journalist well not even<br>a journalist I'm an opinion<br>writer sure thanks so I should also say<br>um that everyone on stage is an alumni<br>alumnus of Victoria University of<br>Wellington as well I just had to get<br>that shout out in there um just to make<br>sure that they pay my wages next week so<br>that is um that is out of the way now I<br>wanted to start with you Liam David<br>Seymour has released the white smoke<br>from the conclave indicating that a deal<br>with the National Party might be<br>imminent I'm wondering what you think<br>that deal might<br>include um it's definitely going to<br>include like a sort of made up um role<br>for um being minister of you know<br>regulatory reform or red cut tape<br>cutting um that sort of gimmick that<br>we've actually seen quite a bit of in<br>the past which probably won't amount to<br>too much but apart from that it is a bit<br>of a it is a bit of a black box so just<br>before uh we came on I called up um some<br>of my mates who National Party MPS now<br>bear in mind they not at the top table a<br>lot of them they're at the kids table<br>and um it's it's still quite uncertain<br>uh because um there's a missing element<br>too right which is that there's not too<br>much that can be promised while the<br>third party hasn't made a deal yet and I<br>think those negotiations are going very<br>very slowly at the moment um there was<br>this kind of hope that it would be a<br>tripartite negotiation or agreement and<br>that hasn't come to fruition at all and<br>so things are going very very slow in<br>terms of um uh you know emails being<br>exchanged and they have to be checked<br>with the other side the just possibly<br>the worst way to possibly negotiate it<br>um so not a lot of news on portfolios<br>yet um because we it's not known what<br>portfolios can be allocated but it was<br>always going to be the case that this<br>was a deal that was going to be this<br>side of it was going to be relatively<br>quick to wrap up um you know I don't<br>know what Seymour um has been promised<br>yet um but really it's quite meaningless<br>until we know what Winston's going to<br>agree<br>to I do think we've seen noises from<br>David Seymour that he is pushing for a<br>referendum on the Treaty of wangi but<br>then on the other side of course you<br>have Chris Luton indicating that that<br>would be I think his words were<br>unhelpful and divisive you think that<br>that as a negotiating tactic by seamour<br>or is he genuinely seeking to have a<br>referendum on the treaty what do you<br>think uh my own read on David Seymour<br>has always been that um as much as I<br>don't agree with a lot of what David<br>Seymour thinks and believes he's he's<br>actually not that much of a cynical<br>politician um you know he he believes in<br>the stuff that he pushes um to the<br>extent that that sometimes um<br>contradictory or contains internal<br>contradictions it's just because he's a<br>human and humans have those<br>contradictions so I believe that I don't<br>it's an easy one for him to give up in<br>the negotiation and I do predict that<br>nothing's going to happen on that front<br>uh because obviously the you know the<br>the juice won't be worth the squeeze of<br>it the social chaos that will follow uh<br>but I wouldn't see it as a cynical<br>negotiating point for him to drop I<br>don't I think he is quite sincere in his<br>belief in that being a good thing to<br>have but it's just a very easy one for<br>him to give<br>up J as a member of the the gallery or<br>someone embedded in the gallery what are<br>your thoughts on the position of New<br>Zealand first in these negotiations do<br>you have a view is there a view emerging<br>um amongst yourself or amongst your<br>colleagues<br>about what policy gains Winston Peters<br>might be pushing or indeed the things<br>which he may drop uh from his<br>negotiations as well um well from a a<br>journalist perspective Winston Peters is<br>going to make my life uh interesting and<br>difficult<br>might help us sell some newspapers it<br>was actually interesting that um<br>recently he he went on um the platform<br>um that Sean planket uh sort of more<br>alternative media Outlet uh to talk<br>straight to the public that way sort of<br>Sid stepping mainstream media Sid<br>stepping um you know General Normal<br>conventions of of having press<br>conferences and standups so I think<br>he'll keep playing that up you know keep<br>playing up uh the the the mainstream<br>media as the enemy and uh you know we're<br>not perfect at all we can so much room<br>for for improvement but I find that uh<br>you know bit dangerous and uh you know<br>that's going to make our lives difficult<br>um in terms of the policy gains I wonder<br>whether they might push for an associate<br>Finance position um both Seymour and<br>Peters uh also um Foreign Affairs that's<br>the one that Winston Peters has had<br>before and you know conversations I've<br>had is is actually he did that job well<br>uh in fact liked working with Winston<br>Peters he he could uh you know was<br>professional good to work with so that<br>could be something Regional development<br>is the other one that they might need to<br>give to New Zealand first um something<br>you know I don't think they're going to<br>get a provincial growth fund again three<br>billion I can't see that happening but<br>they'll have to get<br>something and the other one was the co<br>inquiry so there's already a CO inquiry<br>underway I'm not sure if there's a way<br>of sort of broadening the REM of that or<br>doing something to satisfy the uh sort<br>of disenfranchise vote that voted for<br>New Zealand first um I think it's the<br>number three Casey Costello not Tracy<br>Winston kept calling her Tracy on the<br>radio a couple of days ago it was a bit<br>awkward um and I think she was quite a a<br>key person in in that movement so<br>they'll have to do something on that Co<br>front as well can I just say I I think<br>that tax is a a genuine sticking point<br>in these negotiations um in particular I<br>think the bright line tax it's going to<br>be really interesting to see where where<br>that lands because you have new Zeal<br>first you know quite strongly so New<br>Zealand F Manifesto this year actually<br>had had a lot of stuff that was very<br>you'd actually kind of think it was<br>National party stuff you know had a lot<br>of Christopher luxim kind of luxim isms<br>in it um things like you know we need to<br>be more like you know Singapore and<br>Ireland that kind of stuff that you<br>might think Christopher luxon might say<br>but there was they're quite strong in<br>the man Manifesto and uh and on the<br>about the bright line tax right so at<br>the moment the bright line tax has<br>extended out to 10 years at want it<br>scrap all together and the National<br>Party want to back to two and what I can<br>tell you is that amongst property uh<br>people people who are engaged in the<br>real estate uh sector as I am as a as a<br>jobbing lawyer the bright line tax is<br>actually quite a big thing right and so<br>the bright line tax is something that<br>that people have been uh will be very<br>disappointed with if National doesn't at<br>least get it back to two years um not<br>huge SPS of the population but parts of<br>the population that are po International<br>so I I'm really looking to see<br>interested to see how that shakes out<br>whether or not the compromise is it<br>comes back from 10 to five or if they<br>could do something more creative with it<br>like move it to a rebuttable presumption<br>of Taxation something that's more boring<br>and Technical but I think that that kind<br>of issue is going to be a sticking point<br>because New Zealand first remains quite<br>populist on tax and the national party<br>has made some big promises to its<br>supporters about delivering uh tax Cuts<br>or tax relief I think it's some a<br>sticking point as well as the proposed<br>foreign buyers tax which national is<br>proposing to uh help fund their tax cuts<br>for Middle income earners uh what do you<br>think Winston Peters or New Zealand<br>first position on the foreign buyers tax<br>might be I mean if we if we all say the<br>word foreign loud enough shivel will go<br>up wion Peter spine across the road what<br>do you think is is going to to happen to<br>it and I'll question do you both I think<br>it's it's another one of those examples<br>that it's an easy one to give up in the<br>negotiation right because the revenue to<br>be raised from it um you know let's be<br>honest you know it's it's not likely to<br>be as much as was<br>advertised uh and um the unpopularity of<br>relaxing the foreign buyers band is a<br>liability that you just don't need<br>personally I'm I think that the foreign<br>buyers ban was a step in the wrong<br>direction but you got to pick your<br>battles right if that's an easy<br>concession for National make to New<br>Zealand first I think they'll make it<br>yeah and I mean while newal New Zealand<br>first is uh you know opposed to to<br>foreign buyers at least you are taxing<br>them so it makes it a bit more palatable<br>you say come and foreign buyers but we<br>are actually taxing you um and they need<br>to generate that Revenue so that's a<br>really fundamental part of Nationals<br>plan the other fundamental part actually<br>on the tax side which has not received<br>much attention is uh depreciation<br>deductibility so if you're a commercial<br>or um industrial building owner they<br>National was saying you you can no<br>longer deduct depreciation as an<br>expense it's not it's not a vote winner<br>very uh sort of technical thing but<br>that's expected to generate an extra<br>half a billion dollars of Revenue a year<br>like that is really really significant<br>and actually labor has is campaigning or<br>or campaigned on on making the same<br>change so when Co came along they<br>changed those deductibility rules um to<br>give businesses a bit of of a break but<br>it was seen to be permanent now both<br>National and labor easy Revenue grab<br>make the commercial property owners uh<br>pay a bit more tax 500 million a year<br>that's quite a bit it'll be interesting<br>to see though how that bodess with New<br>Zealand first which is sort of pro you<br>know manufacturing and um has talked<br>about like a lot about improving<br>productivity and and supporting<br>businesses that way so that might be<br>another sticking point it's actually<br>very annoying um that such a political<br>football because it moves backwards and<br>forwards and backwards and forwards in<br>terms of the tax treatment of those<br>assets like it's just you know it be<br>good if we could have some consensus and<br>then that just stays the case of how we<br>tax those uh tax those expenses or<br>depreciation but yeah I mean I think<br>that um the country needs the revenue<br>right I think that we're more likely to<br>see that reform than not yeah and I mean<br>just in terms of the flip flopping<br>around with the taxes it is really<br>disruptive and and you know we have seen<br>that with<br>even um the bright line test National<br>when National was in government<br>introduced it at two years then labor<br>pushed it out to five years then to 10<br>years but five years for new builds now<br>National wants to bring it back to two<br>years I mean it's an absolute like if<br>you're just your average person and<br>you're navigating this it's really<br>complex and then you add the interest<br>deductibility rule into it as well it's<br>if you're a landlord you um under labor<br>can't write off interest as an expense<br>you know it's<br>just I think National and you know the<br>new government is is going to have to be<br>cognizant of yes they might not agree<br>with um you know everything that the the<br>former government did but what's worse<br>is it actually worse to just confuse<br>everyone line the pockets of accountants<br>and make it really hard for your average<br>person um and I think that's a question<br>they're going to need to really think<br>about it's not bad for property lawyers<br>either you know and so you know you bu<br>buy a sell residential property and<br>you've got a three different forms to<br>work out B on when the property was<br>purchased or when the contract was<br>signed and you know and all that what<br>what would be great um and I don't see<br>it coming anytime soon though is for a<br>cord between National and Labor uh as to<br>settling down tax laws and Bing them in<br>and saying right we don't we all don't<br>have what we want we all things we don't<br>like but this for the sake of<br>consistency you know let's have some<br>consensus you know yeah yeah I mean I<br>would personally vote for a consensus on<br>higher taxes and a broader tax base but<br>I<br>Wonder to switch the focus of the<br>discussion on to the opposition now<br>where you think the tax debate will go<br>over the next three years because chippy<br>looks um Chris Hipkins looks entrenched<br>uh for the next year at least but of<br>course he could not argue for a higher<br>uh a broader tax Bas and higher tax<br>rates uh so where do you think that<br>contest or lack of consensus between the<br>left and right is going over the next<br>year to three years<br>well firstly I just want to say I think<br>that this whole issue of taxes is so<br>fraught and um as a journalist often<br>reflect on myself and the way I report<br>tax issues because I find it um<br>disappointing actually that so what the<br>former government introduced in terms of<br>the bright line test at 10 years and the<br>interest deductibility the government<br>was too scared to put a capital gains<br>tax in place but the combination of the<br>bright line test and interest<br>deductibility is actually more<br>heavy-handed on investors and that<br>captures a whole lot of you know average<br>Mom and Dad type investors with one<br>other property um so the bright line<br>test your tax the capital gain is taxed<br>at your income tax rate so it could be<br>up to 39% if there was a capital gains<br>tax you could have put it at 20% much<br>more simple fewer Loop Poes interest<br>deductibility is really actually<br>hampering um investors cash flow now<br>that might that might be a good thing<br>but if we were so scared of upsetting<br>the investors I don't know why on Earth<br>we have this complex web of um interest<br>ability bright line you know exemptions<br>is it the main home isn't it blah blah<br>blah nice smooth capital gains tax could<br>have been much easier so yeah so what's<br>my point sorry that's a bit of a ranch<br>personal view Pro capital gain um but<br>yeah it would be nice if we could just<br>have a sensible head about it and um and<br>not such a kind of um you know there<br>wasn't much faner about interest<br>deductibility because I mean no one<br>understands it the words interest<br>deductibility don't sell newspapers but<br>capital gains tax does um I think just<br>on your point I think the labor last<br>time labor had the capital gains tax I<br>think the rate was 177% wasn't it 15 or<br>17% something like that which is more<br>consistent with how they tax unearned<br>income overseas but to get away from the<br>um actual policy towards the politics um<br>like it just it depends right like so do<br>we do we know did Chris hkin survive the<br>confidence vote this morning do we have<br>an answer yet have we got that puffer<br>white smoke yet I don't know<br>because I think you know to the extent<br>that there was disent within the within<br>the now opposition labor party it was<br>over that issue right that idea that<br>actually either labor missed the<br>opportunity to be bold uh when it was<br>popular or it's unpopular because it<br>wasn't bold enough but in any any event<br>sort of there was sort of this sort of<br>sense of disgruntlement about not taking<br>the opportunity to to actually have a<br>more radical um what I would call a<br>radical uh sort of tax reform um really<br>clear who the leader of that faction is<br>really we can say that that's David<br>Parker right so whether or not he is um<br>himself going to be the um the<br>Challenger to Hipkins or whether or not<br>he's just going to be the The Godfather<br>and there's someone else who is a young<br>buck who's going to step into those<br>shoes that is actually I think uh a<br>genuine inflection point for where we go<br>in the next three years it's really hard<br>for Chris Hopkins to have held the line<br>to have made the captain's call um to<br>have sort of retained a the status quo<br>to then sell himself as the Agent of<br>Change in terms of Taxation in this<br>country and so um certainly I think in<br>the short term if hipkin survives it's<br>going to be a much more targeted sort of<br>opposition that focuses on uh Nationals<br>failures rather than presenting an<br>alternative Vision because Chris Hipkins<br>is just in that mold of the pragmatic uh<br>kind of Trevor malard type politician<br>who's really good at criticizing um that<br>isn't really the type to articulate in<br>cell vision and that's just that just<br>comes down to differences of style and<br>and also I think I'm I'm unconvinced<br>that if labor did come out with uh sort<br>of that wealth tax proposal that Parker<br>was Keen for I'm I'm unconvinced that<br>would have uh improve their result<br>because you know like at the moment<br>property owners are I know it's easy to<br>beat up on property owners but they're<br>taking it quite tough especially you<br>know young people with mortgage rates as<br>high as they are um we already have the<br>these property taxes I just even if you<br>you think it might be the right idea I<br>don't think if they came out with some<br>wealth tax<br>package they would have uh secured a<br>better election result I think that the<br>election result hinged on greater things<br>like in terms of delivery in terms of<br>people being sick of Co ockland is being<br>upset by the lockdowns all these other<br>issues I don't think it was a a wealth<br>tax thing yeah and and I know this is a<br>point of contention but Morgan will<br>probably um correct me here but um you<br>know we did have parties that were<br>promising a wealth tax you know they got<br>between them about you know 15 or 16%<br>whereas you know all the other parties<br>that made up the vast majority of the<br>vote were against it or campaigned<br>against having one now actually politics<br>isn't that simple and if the labor party<br>was in favor of wealth tax you know<br>maybe that would have had more<br>favorability uh but you know like I have<br>to really endorse what Jana said which<br>is that this was an election based on<br>forces and Trends and how people were<br>feeling not on their opinions on<br>abstract possibilities that what their<br>real life was like<br>now side of my authority Matthew Hoon<br>who who argued that he thought Chuy's<br>decision Captain's cour to rule out a<br>wealth tax uh was what led to or<br>precipitated Labor's decline obviously<br>the greens went up and I think the very<br>next poll that was taken but as you say<br>it's interesting to note that the greens<br>went up at Labor's expense but labor<br>would not take votes that Nationals<br>expense or uh the other parties expense<br>uh as well so I do want to pick up on<br>those broader forces I think this is um<br>something that most people would agree<br>on because you all know it very well in<br>your daily lives uh inflation and the<br>cost of living uh and the B that that's<br>taken out of people's budgets or indeed<br>making people's lives uh more difficult<br>so I wonder what you think though about<br>uh the national party and even New<br>Zealand First's uh approach to this and<br>Jana I wanted to ask about uh their<br>approach to The Reserve Bank National is<br>making noises about reforming uh their<br>mandate and New Zealand first uh is<br>making noises about reforming their<br>mandate as well but maybe in a bit of a<br>contradictory uh manner to the National<br>party we do think uh the reform of The<br>Reserve Bank might land after these<br>negotiations yeah so um currently The<br>Reserve Bank is tasked with its monetary<br>policy committee has to Target inflation<br>keep that between 1 and 3% and have<br>maximum sustainable employment right so<br>there's no number put on that but those<br>are the two Targets and they have equal<br>waiting National has said let's get rid<br>of the employment Target which is you<br>know relatively new but also uh a lot of<br>other central banks around the world<br>have that they say get rid of that<br>Target just make them focus on inflation<br>that's the way to bring inflation down<br>what national won't say is are they<br>implying the reserve banks should be<br>hiking interest rates more aggressively<br>um to get on top of inflation there's<br>still a question Mark around that<br>Seymour is act is also Keen to get rid<br>of employment make them just focus on<br>inflation um and then actually Winston<br>Peters a few years ago was Keen to<br>broaden what the Reserve Bank Target to<br>look at not just inflation but GDP and<br>um a bunch of other measures because he<br>thought it was myopic to just use<br>interest rates to Target inflation so um<br>interestingly I don't think New Zealand<br>first has really talked much about the<br>Reserve Bank and its targets ahead of<br>the selection so I think that they will<br>be able to ditch the employment Target<br>just make the Reserve Bank focus on<br>inflation as per what um act and<br>National are are campaigning on will<br>that make a difference to inflation no I<br>don't think it will because um The<br>Reserve Bank has hiked interest rates<br>aggressively it takes time for those<br>interest rate effects uh you know<br>interest rate hikes to take effect you<br>know you only really feel it when you go<br>to refix your mortgage or when you find<br>coton on to the fact that you're not<br>earning much interest in your savings<br>account and you should pop your money in<br>a term deposit because the rates are<br>quite good<br>um I think and so I think the jury still<br>out I don't know if it'll make a big<br>difference in the current environment<br>perhaps in other parts of the economic<br>cycle it might make a difference some<br>people say like Arthur Grimes who um<br>invented inflation targeting from New<br>Zealand he is very Pro just inflation<br>Target um and he reckons if they only<br>had an inflation Target they wouldn't<br>cut interest rates by as much done all<br>the money printing all of that when Co<br>came along to boost employment so um<br>anyway that I think that's where that's<br>it I mean I agree with you that it's a<br>bit of a fake controversy in some ways I<br>mean you probably know well you do know<br>more about this than I do but you know<br>you've got this like Philips curve idea<br>where you know inflation and employment<br>are enemies you know and that you you<br>increase unemployment and that gets<br>inflation down and vice versa and it's<br>sort of been busted for a long time you<br>know that over the longer term you can<br>have low inflation and high employment<br>they're not really they don't need to be<br>at odds with with each other um and you<br>know you think okay if the Mandate was<br>different would the Reserve Bank have<br>acted differently Pro probably not but<br>you know when you're in opposition and<br>um inflation is high you need something<br>to beat up on and the reserve banks an<br>an easy one particularly because it<br>can't really fight back because it's um<br>not part of the political um arm of<br>government you know it's meant to be<br>independent so um you know it's it's<br>it's easy to beat up on the Reserve Bank<br>and The Reserve Bank does a lot of<br>things that probably deserve you know<br>call in for a lot of criticism but<br>fundamentally I don't really see a lot<br>of change and and that's been something<br>that's been interesting to watch as well<br>is Nicola Willis as Nationals Finance<br>spokesperson um she has you know<br>attacked Adan or the governor of The<br>Reserve Bank quite a bit during select<br>committees she's been really sort of<br>aggressive and she's gotten right in<br>there um I think she's been really<br>effective in in her role um you know as<br>an opposition spokesperson and Adrian or<br>being uh the sort of personnal of the<br>years has sometimes bit back and there's<br>been a bit of drama in select committee<br>which has been entertaining but um and<br>so some people have said well what's<br>going to happen well would would<br>National and act try to get rid of<br>Adrian or uh I I doubt that would happen<br>um you can't just get rid of someone<br>like the governor of The Reserve Bank<br>unless uh you know according to the law<br>he's not fulfilled his duties and done<br>all these things which which is you<br>can't I don't think you can really argue<br>that so I think that everyone will just<br>get on with it they'll be professionals<br>there'll be a bit of you know like a<br>little bit of head head bashing but I I<br>think they'll Adrian was not going<br>anywhere in my humble and there was it<br>was head bashing between adri or and the<br>current government from time to time too<br>right so it's just a new interesting<br>development and government Reserve Bank<br>relations yeah and I and it was<br>interesting last Friday Adrian or did a<br>speech on um climate change and National<br>and act keep having a go at The Reserve<br>Bank for focusing on climate change<br>because they say well the Reserve Bank<br>should just focus on inflation and then<br>the Reserve Bank says well actually<br>climate change is kind of a big deal and<br>it does affect inflation and it affects<br>affects Financial stability like if<br>there's a big flood and all of our<br>houses get damaged then what happens to<br>the bank that actually technically owns<br>the houses<br>um so they argue that but I just think<br>the fact that Adrian did the speech on<br>climate change on Friday just as the new<br>government came in even though it's<br>exactly what the new government is<br>saying stop doing that is like well I'm<br>doing it anyway um and I might be<br>reading it into it too much but he also<br>mentioned the employment before he<br>mentioned inflation when he talked about<br>the targets so I think to me that's<br>that's potentially a sign of the Reserve<br>Bank saying no we're doing our thing and<br>and we're not going to be um you know<br>we're not going to buckle over for the<br>for the new government's ideological<br>views because this is a a Wellington<br>audience uh and I do recognize many<br>faces uh here uh from the public I do<br>want to ask a question about whether the<br>incoming government is going to<br>encounter uh maybe the words a recal<br>trint public service so we saw uh in the<br>last term of government ministers uh<br>former ministers like Stuart Nash um<br>quoting the ruselt quote about the man<br>in the arena as if he was some great<br>Insurgent battleing against uh the<br>public service and the people trying to<br>thr his agenda now do you think that was<br>a a proper representation of what is<br>happening uh in Wellington or do you<br>think that it's overblowing the current<br>government will get its uh will get its<br>agenda through the public service very<br>easily commissioned advice will be very<br>easy uh or do you think that there are a<br>roadblocks sitting there well what don't<br>you go first you live Welling I don't<br>know okay I'll be I'll be brave and I'll<br>confront the audience of public servants<br>um my National Party views um no look we<br>we we don't have that kind of like you<br>know public sector reform is an<br>important thing for the national party<br>it's also I think an important challenge<br>for the country on the whole and it's<br>not about making the public sector weak<br>or you know that's actually one of the<br>problems we have is that the public<br>sector you know and you talk to public<br>servants and they will often agree with<br>us is that it can't get the job done it<br>can't it's it's got itself there too<br>many roadblocks and doing the job that<br>the public sector wants to do right<br>and so it's not necessarily about<br>shrinking it to the point where you can<br>you know drown it in the bathtub it's<br>about actually empowering you need to<br>have a strong public sector right now um<br>we also don't have a corrupt public<br>sector right so you know um we're really<br>blessed in that country that we have a<br>professional public sector that is<br>actually um you know transparent and you<br>know holds the ethos of public sector<br>neutrality as much as those of us on the<br>right might like to joke about it the<br>the biggest problem is simply the<br>problem that you always have when you<br>try to reform any organization which is<br>that it's really hard to do to battle<br>inertia there are things that you don't<br>you you don't understand that are going<br>to be problems you know you eliminate a<br>job and you don't understand that<br>actually that person was doing something<br>really important and even though the<br>overall numbers have to come down a<br>little bit or have to become a bit<br>leaner you're going to have a whole lot<br>of problems along the way so I think<br>that it is public sector reform is<br>important and it is going to be<br>difficult and there are going to be a<br>lot of failures and troubles but it's<br>not because of<br>any serious entrence or refusal to<br>comply in the part of the public sector<br>our public sector is far too<br>professional for that as just said it's<br>really really hard to reform a built<br>existing organic organization or sort of<br>system and I think labor found that too<br>right often times you the labor labor<br>ministers often but their heads about<br>the inability to reform things and get<br>things changing but it's not because the<br>public sector were corrupt or um<br>resisting in any any sort of overt or<br>coordinated way it's just that it's<br>actually really really hard to change an<br>organization you know universities go<br>through it workplaces go through it<br>public sector is no<br>different yeah and just to add to that I<br>mean the former government uh wanted to<br>reform a range of things so if you're<br>proposing major reforms or or whole new<br>policies like the income insurance that<br>was Grant Robertson's pet U project uh<br>if you're doing a lot of change you know<br>that uh creates jobs and then if you get<br>rid of it those jobs go where do those<br>people go just it kind of gets a bit<br>messy but for the incoming government it<br>wants to get rid of a whole lot of<br>things repeal things you know three<br>Waters we don't want this we don't want<br>that but then it's still there's still a<br>problem like how do you fix those issues<br>those issues are still there and<br>somebody still needs to be employed to<br>fix those problems yeah not only that<br>but the other thing um which I've always<br>try to I always complain about to my<br>friends in the National Party is that<br>like a big thing if you talk about the<br>effectiveness of the public sector a big<br>thing that limits the ability of the<br>public sector to be um effective is the<br>quality of legislation right which is<br>actually passed by um the political part<br>of the government not by the public<br>sector so in my<br>day-to-day job as a as a lawyer you know<br>like I struggle with legislation like<br>the anti-money laundering laws sometimes<br>you know and that has to be implemented<br>and enforced and overseen by the<br>department of internal affairs and so<br>they've got a whole lot of people that<br>they have to employ to figure things out<br>and all that but that comes down to the<br>to vague legislation that's passed um<br>half measures like you know the bright<br>line tests and things like that you know<br>things that aren't really done in a<br>comprehensive and clean way that falls<br>on bureaucrats to try to implement and<br>if it's the more vague it is that the<br>more bureaucrats you need so you know a<br>lot of it falls on the national party or<br>any government to actually clean up<br>their act<br>too in a couple minutes I'll uh invite<br>questions from the audience in Zoom but<br>just before that I want you to answer<br>this really quickly if you can can Chris<br>Lux in handle Winston Peters and David<br>Seymour yeah I think he might prefer to<br>East might be L of a challenge you work<br>his way up to to it uh look I listen I<br>was I was quite um optimistic at first<br>and I've become less optimistic over<br>time I think the failure that the fact<br>that they weren't able to get into like<br>a good tripartite three-way negotiation<br>and we sort of by all reports back to<br>exchanging emails and things like that<br>uh is um is is quite a bad sign um look<br>in some ways I sort of think okay if<br>he's got Winston and Seymour to play off<br>against each other then you know that<br>actually gives them a bit of an<br>organizational Advantage but the fact is<br>that they're going to need both to pass<br>any legislation is is actually probably<br>going to make you know reduce any of<br>that Advantage back to nothing um you<br>know talking to um you know from spot<br>what you might think I'm friends with a<br>few um current and former labor party<br>cabinet ministers uh talking to them in<br>private about what it's like to have<br>Winston around the cabinet table the<br>idea is look you just have to be really<br>different to them you've got to show<br>them the due respect um and the problem<br>is that I don't think David Seymour is<br>really like is kind of really like that<br>you know like he himself is very<br>outspoken he considers himself to be<br>very principled I think he will struggle<br>um in that environment too so that's why<br>I think the happiest at chrisop lux's<br>ever going to be was election<br>night but on the other hand and this is<br>where I think the fact that he's not<br>like you know people talk about Chris<br>Lux like he's a like he's a businessman<br>you know but it's not like Chris luxon<br>invented in New Zealand in his garage<br>you know having max out his credit cards<br>you know like it's a a majority<br>government owned Corporation it's huge<br>right you've got to manage stakeholders<br>you don't have the control it's not your<br>Empire that you have the control over so<br>this is one of those things where I<br>think that actually being a CEO of an<br>existing company we've come in and<br>you've had to manage those personalities<br>and know that you don't have the full<br>sovereignty or control might give them a<br>bit of an edge that other um contenders<br>for prime minister from the National<br>Party actually don't have yeah but on<br>that as a you know if you are a CEO<br>which I have experience and then I just<br>don't think you get people challenging<br>you that much because you are the boss<br>your engagements with well the media at<br>least a very staged you know you have<br>your sit down interview for 10 minutes<br>and they and it's not it's you know if<br>you interview a CEO uh in terms of like<br>company results or something it's a CEO<br>and they've got the army of comms people<br>there they're all brief they have their<br>talking points and they have their<br>polite business journalists asking<br>questions for 10 minutes and off they go<br>you don't have um you know the media<br>yelling at you you're on stage and<br>you've got got got joural yelling<br>questions at you or Winston Peter's<br>being potentially rude to you I don't<br>know how that how that will go um so I<br>think it might be challenging for for<br>him I think Lux and Peters will be will<br>be fine together um I think it's the<br>peters's seem more Dynamic I'm more<br>worried about you you make a really good<br>point though and um with LX and you not<br>only being a CEO type but also being so<br>new to politics to begin with remember<br>he's he's three and a half years in you<br>can really tell he's got that<br>sort of manner about them which a lot of<br>National Party sort of MPS have when<br>they first come in which is they're<br>really good in that sort of uh I guess<br>you could call it like a captive<br>audience like a chamber of commerce<br>business breakfast where you know<br>there's there's true difference you know<br>there aren't going to be a whole lot of<br>followup questions and the followup<br>questions that you do get you can sort<br>of bat away whereas you know you know<br>what the the animals are like over there<br>like they're just they're never going to<br>let go of anything and all of a sudden<br>you find yourself you know sort of<br>flustered or without answers and I think<br>that we did see that lux struggled with<br>that a little bit in the campaign that<br>change from being you know the king to<br>actually having to be the servant in<br>some ways yeah I think he actually he<br>has improved a lot so initially<br>Christopher luxon made quite a few GS<br>you know he'd say the wrong thing and we<br>wouldn't understand the policy properly<br>and then Nicola Willis would have to<br>swoop up behind him and mop it all up<br>but recently I think he's been better<br>but the challenge for him will still be<br>in those um in a in a situation with<br>media where he can't get away and divert<br>the the question I don't know if anyone<br>saw that uh Jack tame interview yeah I<br>thought that was I think Jack T's done a<br>great job actually um in the campaign<br>has had some really hard-hitting<br>interviews but that was challenging for<br>for Chris Lux and he couldn't say our<br>next question from someone else please<br>and what if it's for what it's worth an<br>Insight that I have heard is that um<br>luxon can be very uh direct and blunt<br>when he needs to be um and that you know<br>for example in the National Party list<br>ranking when he he basically got his way<br>and you know it didn't quite work out<br>because of the electorates but he got<br>his way in having a much more gender<br>balanced list anyway and you know that<br>was really him stamping his mark on it<br>and you know coming into the list<br>ranking committee which is meant to be<br>Democratic but saying right no it's<br>going to be this way um and I think if<br>he can do that with Seymour and he can<br>bring Seymour into line a little bit and<br>manage that relationship I think the<br>Peters luxon thing I think luxon's got<br>Peters kind of figured out and in the<br>last couple weeks after the election<br>you've seen that he hasn't made any<br>moves s Winston he's you know been sort<br>of you know careful and cautious and<br>hasn't been too presumptuous um so I<br>think that's going to be the key if it's<br>going to work on the on the basis of the<br>Seymour element I think everything else<br>will fall into place yeah yeah I think<br>all the best politicians have a switch I<br>would like to thank you on behalf of<br>Victoria University of Wellington and<br>our external events for coming out here<br>on uh this relatively rainy day uh We've<br>appreciated your company uh now we do<br>have to clear the room relatively<br>quickly so I'll farewell you and hope<br>there</p></main><footer
