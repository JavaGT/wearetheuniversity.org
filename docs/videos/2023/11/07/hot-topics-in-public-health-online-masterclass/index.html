that it's um midday so<br>let's make a start uh welcome everybody<br>to the Sy augural class in public health<br>hosted by the University of aago in um<br>in Al um let us start with a and please<br>it so thank you all very much for<br>joining us today we've got three<br>marvelous speakers who you can see here<br>on the uh on the screen uh Professor Sue<br>Kringle and DRS John Kerr and Helen fit<br>um uh one of the uh one from each of our<br>campuses in Wellington Christ Church and<br>denen um so they're all doing<br>outstanding research in diverse areas of<br>Public Health and today we organized<br>this masterclass to uh uh to inspire you<br>really to um uh inspire you to think<br>about public health to think about uh<br>working studying and and doing research<br>in this area but also to uh update those<br>of you already working in the field<br>about some of the key issues that are<br>before us at the moment um we're really<br>delighted to have uh over 100 in fact<br>168 at last count people join us today<br>and so um what why that's really<br>wonderful on the one hand it does mean<br>that the chances that we'll be able able<br>to answer your particular question are<br>pretty um slim however we would really<br>welcome you to comment in the chat uh<br>and um the um uh speakers will give you<br>their email addresses if there are<br>particular issues that you need to um<br>follow up with them um and I'll try if I<br>can to capture some of the key themes in<br>questions to the key speakers as we<br>go so um we're here to one and I'd just<br>like then to introduce our first Speaker<br>who is Professor Su Kringle uh she's a<br>leading Marty Health researcher in the<br>naho Research Unit uh in ad needen<br>campus and her research focuses on<br>inequities and Health Services uh and<br>today she's going to talk to us about<br>tior pahu Kahu uh which is the m Mari<br>lung the lung screening program and um<br>speak on her reflections of work in this<br>area so thanks very much soe the floor<br>I'll just get my presentation up um and<br>so I'm really pleased to be talking to<br>youday about tahukah which is a program<br>of lung cancer screening<br>uh research that I'm doing in<br>partnership with um some people from<br>across the country actually but it's<br>particularly with uh people who are<br>working in what<br>wereat and um Oakland dhbs and now the<br>northern<br>region so why do we need lung cancer<br>screening uh well lung cancer is the<br>leading cause of death for Mary women uh<br>it's the second leading cause of death<br>for Mighty Men and for non-m Mighty um<br>um males and females um it's the leading<br>cause of cancer deaths for both Mary and<br>non-mi and the Mari mortality rate for<br>men and women is over three times that<br>of<br>non-mi unsurprisingly the incidents rate<br>um is also higher for Marty and it's<br>over three times that of the non-m peers<br>for both males and<br>females lung cancer is the second<br>largest contributor to the life<br>expectancy Gap so the difference in life<br>expectancy for Mii and non-mi<br>non-pacific peoples and for men lung<br>cancer contributes about 08 of a year<br>and into um 08 of a year into the 7.2<br>year difference and for women it<br>contributes 1.1 year of a 6.7 year Gap<br>so it's a substantial contributor<br>cardiovascular disease is the um the<br>first the largest contributor to that<br>Gap 5e survival from lung cancer is less<br>than<br>20% um and which means that you know of<br>all the people diagnosed with lung<br>cancer less than 20% of them survive 5<br>years and Mari 5year survival is lower<br>than non-mi non-pacific people's 5year<br>survival there are Regional differences<br>in 5year survival as well uh and the<br>region with the lowest 5e survival<br>for Mari and for um Pacific and for<br>European or non non-pacific people um is<br>the central um<br>District um and for Mar that 5year<br>survival is um about<br>8% so big problem it's a big problem uh<br>and um and of course we need to do<br>everything from Tobacco Control um to<br>identifying people with symptoms of lung<br>cancer early and getting them diagnosed<br>and treated um to improving the<br>inequities in lung cancer diagnosis and<br>treatment that we know exist uh but also<br>we need to look at doing lung cancer<br>screening and lung cancer screening<br>identifies people before they get<br>symptoms of lung cancer uh and then um<br>so that they can be diagnosed early and<br>um treat at a time when or a stage when<br>treatment cure as<br>possible it's um a two-stage process so<br>first of all we want to identify<br>asymptomatic people who are at high risk<br>of lung cancer and they're current in<br>New Zealand in our context that's<br>largely people who are current or<br>ex-smokers and we don't screen everyone<br>who's ever smoked because the balance of<br>harms and<br>benefits means that we don't want to<br>screen people who are at low risk of<br>lung cancer uh so we have a way of<br>identifying people who are at high risk<br>and we do this thing called a risk<br>assessment to do that we use a risk<br>assessment model called the plco<br>M22 uh which is um a a risk prediction<br>tool that we use people who meet the<br>risk threshold are invited to undergo<br>shared decision making so that they can<br>decide of having a CT scan is the right<br>thing for them and then if they choose<br>to they go on to have a lowd dose CT<br>scan<br>um if people have a negative scr scan<br>scan then if we had a national program<br>then they would go on to get another<br>scan at a suitable at the suitable or<br>the interval chosen by the national<br>program likely I think to be two<br>years um if people have a positive scan<br>and what that means is that we see<br>either um a a mass or a lesion on the CT<br>scan that looks very suspicious for lung<br>cancer<br>or we seen that lung<br>nodules then they will go on to either<br>have immediate investigation if it's a<br>very suspicious lesion or what we<br>consider a high-risk nodule and we have<br>a way of um um uh um categorizing the<br>nodules from uh very low through to high<br>risk um and so if someone has a<br>suspicious mass or a high-risk nodule<br>they get immediate<br>investigation um and if someone has a<br>moderate risk nodule they have a sex a<br>repeat city scan in 3 months and a mild<br>risk nodule they have a repeat CT scan<br>in 12 months time and then of course if<br>people are diagnosed with lung cancer<br>they go on to have um the the treatments<br>in the health<br>system um multiple International Studies<br>have shown that um using lowd do CT<br>scans um is<br>uh uh is very effective at reducing lung<br>cancer mortality and that's between 20<br>to 26% reduction in lung cancer<br>mortality and it can up it be up to 39%<br>in women so the two major trials that<br>have been done have been done in the US<br>the<br>nlst uh saw a 20% reduction in mortality<br>and in Nelson which was done in<br>Netherlands and Belgium there was a 26%<br>reduction in in<br>mortality and the the we achieve that<br>reduction because we shift the stage at<br>diagnosis so at the moment the majority<br>of people who are diagnosed with lung<br>cancer are diagnosed at a late stage<br>stage three or stage four stage four is<br>when lung cancer has spread throughout<br>your body um and it's too late for cure<br>at that point with screening then the<br>vast majority of people and in<br>Manchester it was like 75% and that's<br>similar to um the other programs um but<br>75% of people are diagnosed at stage one<br>stage one is when the cancer is<br>extremely small and is fully contained<br>in the lung and um cure is um uh is<br>possible so our work um our focus of our<br>program is to make sure that when lung<br>cancer screening is int introduced as a<br>national program in Alor it will be<br>Equitable none of other National Lung uh<br>National cancer screening programs are<br>Equitable at the moment if we do not<br>have lung cancer screening introduced in<br>an equitable manner we will make make<br>those existing terrible mortality<br>inequities worse and we do not want that<br>to happen so we're designing we're doing<br>a variety of research where we want to<br>design lung cancer screening so that it<br>Mar uh we do this through a number of<br>mechanisms so we've got quite um we've<br>got a strong um structure for the<br>program we've got um you know myself I'm<br>leading the program we've got a project<br>steering committee and all but three of<br>the people on this project steering<br>committee are Marty they consist of<br>Public Health Physicians respiratory<br>Physicians Health Service managers um<br>academics Public Health Physicians<br>community and Community representatives<br>and an oncologist<br>uh we've got a technical Advisory Group<br>uh where some members are Marty and that<br>consists of respiratory Physicians<br>Radiologists oncologists and um genetic<br>uh and biomarker<br>expertise uh as you would expect all the<br>people that you need for a lung cancer<br>screening program um our Primary Care<br>Advisory Group as primary care and um we<br>have a taharah which is a consumer of<br>Advisory Group and I'll talk a little<br>bit more about that in a minute uh of<br>course we've got some International<br>collaborations in Australia the UK and<br>Canada and academic linkes here in<br>Alo we've got a diverse study team so I<br>think five of our five or six of our<br>team members are Marty um and the other<br>study team members are absolutely 100%<br>committed to Howard a mar and to equity<br>safe um so we're a program of research<br>we started in 2018 and we um repeated we<br>did a coste Effectiveness analysis and<br>demonstrated that um uh lung cancer<br>screening was likely to be highly coste<br>effective um in New Zealand especially<br>for Marty women but actually for Mighty<br>and U males and for non-m Mighty males<br>and<br>females uh we did some focus groups and<br>Survey work with Marty who would be<br>eligible for lung cancer screening and<br>their Faro um to explore their thoughts<br>about lung cancer screening what would<br>be barriers and um facilitators of<br>participation in lung cancer screening<br>what they thought about the use of<br>biomarkers whole range of<br>things um and as part of that we<br>established<br>tah um and there so when we did our<br>focus groups people were amazingly<br>supportive of it once they real once<br>they understood what lung cancer<br>screening was and some people wanted to<br>continue to support our work and we<br>established our um f Community or fno<br>Advisory Group and they're still with us<br>to the stay they have a really important<br>role they help us identify our research<br>questions they um give us feedback on<br>design of what we're doing and are<br>really important in um helping us<br>develop all our um study materials our<br>promotional materials videos those kinds<br>of things uh and they're you know um an<br>extremely important part of our<br>work we've currently got three studies<br>going and I'm going to talk just about<br>the invitation study today so in our um<br>survey work we said how would you like<br>to be um invited to lung cancer<br>screening and a third of people said by<br>a GP a third said by a central Hub like<br>breast screening or bow screening and a<br>third didn't really care they just kind<br>of wanted an invite and so we're test<br>ing GP versus a central Hub invitation<br>process to see if one one is more<br>effective than the other our hypothesis<br>is that Primary Care based screening<br>will be more effective than a central<br>Hub uh we're aiming to conduct 512 CT<br>scans it's funded by the Global Alliance<br>for chronic disease and the health<br>research Council of New Zealand for<br>which we are very grateful and we're<br>also collecting information about um the<br>acceptability of study processes the<br>feasibility of collecting biomarkers<br>blood for<br>biomarkers um and also all of that kind<br>of information you need to set up a<br>national screening program like What<br>proportion of people you think are<br>eligible are actually eligible What<br>proportion agree to go ahead and get a<br>scan how many positive scans do you have<br>how many cases of cancer do you diagnose<br>all of those types of information that<br>you need for a national screening<br>program<br>setup our current status as of the 13th<br>of OCT October um and I've just got<br>three more slides I think um so we've<br>recruited all our practices we have<br>identified just over 1900 potentially<br>eligible people of those 19% declined to<br>participate 21% were<br>uncontable and 20 12% were excluded<br>because they didn't meet the criteria so<br>we were left with 954<br>participants of those who had been um n<br>94% um had completed the risk assessment<br>the other um 6% were still in that<br>process and 53% of those people met the<br>risk<br>threshold um of the 477<br>people um who underw who were eligible<br>uh for a CT scan 93% went through shared<br>decision- making and agreed to have a<br>scan so we're very very happy with that<br>um of the 43 433 scans that had been<br>done 64% had no significant<br>nodules<br>9% um had a suspicious mass or a very<br>highrisk nodle and went straight to<br>investigation 10% were uh scheduled for<br>a 3mon CT scan repeat and 23% were<br>scheduled for a 12mon CT scan repeat as<br>of the 31st of October we had diagnosed<br>nine people people with lung<br>cancer um I'm going to skip this slide<br>and just go to the lessons so kind of<br>lessons for me uh we often hear about<br>Marty reluctance to participate in um<br>research but my experience is that if<br>the research topic of something that is<br>of high priority then Marty will<br>participate absolutely will participate<br>Mighty participation at all levels of<br>the program is really important and<br>particularly um to and our Faro<br>Community<br>umu um and um the importance of a dhb or<br>F and um university partnership um you<br>know it's just so um it's just it's such<br>a great project and that's in part<br>because great team and it's really<br>important for academics to be working<br>with the sector um so that we can get on<br>and move quickly to<br>implementation um and um we already have<br>a national planning process for lung<br>cancer screening underway it's probably<br>kind of like a three to five year time<br>frame once we get the planning done and<br>the budget bid done and treasury to<br>agree to fund lung cancer screening cure<br>that y Su thank you so much for that<br>wonderful presentation and for the<br>incredible mahy that you and your team<br>are doing um there are some really<br>exciting opportunities um going to uh<br>emerge in in our um the next few years<br>in our lifetimes uh in this area of<br>cancer screening and prevention I don't<br>have any questions at the moment in the<br>in the chat so um if anybody does have<br>some for Sue I'm not sure whether you're<br>able to stay until one Sue yes she is so<br>if people do have questions for Sue or<br>comments um please pop them in the chat<br>um so<br>moving on then I'd just like to<br>introduce John ker who is a um a a<br>researcher here in Wellington in the<br>Wellington office and he uh is um a<br>senior research fellow uh in and science<br>lead in the public health communication<br>Center and he's going to talk to us<br>today about misinformation in public<br>John you're a CO everyone um yes my name<br>is John K and I'm based uh in the<br>Department of Public Health at the<br>University ofo Wellington and I work as<br>part of an organization called the<br>public health communication Center um<br>and today I've been asked to talk about<br>about misinformation in public health um<br>which is an area of research interest<br>for me but given the short amount of<br>time I'm just going to try and cover a<br>few key points so we're GNA skim we're<br>going to skim across the surface a<br>little bit but I I do hope there's a<br>chance for questions at the end um so to<br>start with I just as a an overview<br>really hold<br>on here we go what I'm going to talk<br>about today is a little bit about how we<br>talk about and Define um misinformation<br>and then some of the negative impacts we<br>see from from Mis misinformation in<br>public health and then briefly talk<br>about some of the potential Solutions uh<br>and some work that's going on in New<br>Zealand so uh you may feel like you're<br>hearing more about misinformation than<br>you used to and if you are then you're<br>right uh so we've seen an increasing<br>Trend in this is just the number of news<br>articles in New Zealand that mention the<br>word<br>misinformation um and you can probably<br>spot a peak there that the the the<br>number of Articles really peaked around<br>the end of 2021 and the start of 2022<br>which coincides with the co 19 vaccine<br>rollout and uh protests around the<br>vaccine mandates so right away you can<br>see that this idea of misinformation is<br>really linked with public health<br>interventions but there's a challenging<br>question here which is what we really<br>talking about when we talk about<br>misinformation um and I always like to<br>highlight this sentence from a recent<br>review which to me is a real<br>understatement so it's it's very easy to<br>say misinformation is false information<br>but that doesn't quite cut it as a<br>definition there's more difficulty<br>around it than that um this here is a<br>very commonly used definition it's not<br>the only one but I'll give you a moment<br>it<br>the a form of this definition is what's<br>used by the New Zealand government and<br>you can see there's a distinction here<br>between what they term misinformation<br>and disinformation based on the intent<br>of the person sharing it and that can be<br>useful sometimes but at other times it's<br>very difficult to actually know what<br>someone was thinking when they created<br>or shared some information and so it's<br>one of the challenges just one of the<br>challenges around defining what it is<br>we're talking about for the rest of the<br>talk I'm just going to use the word<br>misinformation as as a general term but<br>I wanted to raise awareness around the<br>the differing definitions and even<br>amongst experts who study this there is<br>a lot of argument around how we Define<br>these<br>terms um it's very easy to try and say<br>well misinformation is false information<br>but I'll I'll use a couple of examples<br>to illustrate why that can be tricky um<br>on the left here this story from David<br>Ike a well-known conspiracy theorist um<br>this is something that's pretty clearly<br>false it just doesn't stand up to<br>scrutiny there's no solid evidence to<br>back it up we can point at that and say<br>that's misinformation we know that's not<br>true where it gets harder is around news<br>stories or social media posts that share<br>information that is actually technically<br>true but can be misleading and I've I've<br>highlighted this example here which<br>talks about um the number of coid deaths<br>in the US and that the majority of<br>vaccinated people now if you didn't<br>think about that headline very much you<br>would actually come to a possibly<br>conclusion that that the vaccine puts<br>you at greater risk of death and that's<br>not the case um it's it's more to do<br>with the number of vaccinated people in<br>the population and also who's getting<br>vaccinated so older people who are at<br>generally more risk of dying from coid<br>even if vaccinated than younger people<br>if most older people are vaccinated then<br>um you might expect to start seeing so<br>it's the the number of deaths of<br>vaccinated people increasing it's a<br>difficult one to explain but my point is<br>that that this story is technically 100%<br>true but can be quite misleading it's<br>emitted certain information and it's<br>framed in a way to to cast a negative<br>light on the vaccine and that's why it<br>gets challenging uh when you're trying<br>to say well this is true and that's<br>false there are things that can also be<br>misleading and that's just one example<br>of the challenges I've I've highlighted<br>here in these circles a number of other<br>different considerations that people<br>have tried to uh use when defining<br>misinformation just as example to show<br>the sort of nebulous Cloud that we're<br>trying to talk about um and what I would<br>say is that in a lot of cases um this<br>isn't so important it is important when<br>you're trying to make a law or create<br>regulations you actually do need hard<br>and fast rules but my general advice is<br>to think about misinformation more as<br>Landing somewhere on a spectrum for most<br>purposes um I think that's a better way<br>to think about it particularly in public<br>health um where there can be misleading<br>information that sits in this middle<br>space so as a useful way rather than<br>trying to fit everything into boxes we<br>can think about it more as a<br>spectrum um so there's a question of you<br>know how bad is it in New Zealand<br>unfortunately no one is tracking all the<br>misinformation uh available in AOA but<br>we can look at surveys to get an idea of<br>how many people feel like they're being<br>exposed to misinformation so this was a<br>study uh a report from netsafe earlier<br>this year and they found that basically<br>everybody feels like they're seeing<br>seeing misinformation so 91% of new<br>zealanders said they'd seen<br>misinformation in the last month and<br>about half feel like they're seeing it<br>daily now there's a challenge here in<br>how misinformation is defined and what<br>people infer is misinformation but it<br>does highlight that people are kind of<br>aware that it's in the immediate diet<br>and if and it's at high<br>levels uh another point is that people<br>are quite worried about misinformation<br>so 82% are concerned about it this is<br>another survey that's slightly older but<br>it had had a great question in it here<br>which was do you think that<br>misinformation is influencing people's<br>views about public health and nine out<br>of 10 new zealanders said yes and again<br>that underscores the idea that<br>misinformation is a real challenge for<br>public health that it's something<br>relevant to Public<br>Health I'm just going to talk briefly<br>about why um we should be worried about<br>um misinformation and some of the<br>examples of the negative impacts it can<br>have and I'm going to talk about this at<br>a range of different levels um starting<br>with just at at the individual level so<br>about individual health choices and<br>people given bad information can make<br>bad choices about their own health this<br>example here is of someone who drank a a<br>bleach based solution as a intended cure<br>for Co 19 uh it didn't work and it made<br>them quite unwell uh but this person<br>didn't spontaneously decide to do this<br>they had received some information and<br>on the basis of that information they<br>had made a choice about what to do about<br>their health and it was not a good<br>choice<br>people also make choices about their own<br>health that can also affect others um<br>and I've highlighted perhaps the most<br>obvious example uh or issue that comes<br>up with misinformation which is the co<br>19 vaccine so we know from randomized<br>controlled experiments that people who<br>read typical misinformation around the<br>vaccine uh are less likely to to say<br>they're going to get vaccinated so we<br>know it has an impact on people's<br>intentions uh and that can lead to them<br>making uh choices that leave them more<br>exposed to the virus but it also means<br>that they may be uh more likely to<br>transmit the virus to others so we hear<br>a lot of discussion around ideas like<br>herd immunity and the idea that when<br>you're vaccinated you're less likely to<br>pass on the virus to someone else as<br>well so this example where someone's<br>individual choices are starting to<br>impact those around them misinformation<br>can also impact people who make choices<br>on behalf of others so at a sort of<br>policy level you might see<br>misinformation and impacting public<br>health and just to show you that it's<br>not all about Co 19 I've used an example<br>from um about 10 years ago where<br>Hamilton City Council voted to remove<br>fluoride from their water so fluide is<br>added to the water as a public health<br>intervention it reduces the incidence of<br>dental decay um but in this case<br>Hamilton City Council held a number of<br>public hearings they listened to a lot<br>of different people um and it turns out<br>they listen to a lot of people who were<br>sharing false and and unreliable<br>information and that played a role in<br>their choice to vote to remove fluide<br>from the water um and reflecting on that<br>one of the public health professionals<br>in the area had this to say they they<br>really pointed out misinformation as<br>playing a key role in that<br>decision-making<br>process and then if we sort of scale<br>this up to to sort of a national level<br>we can think about misinformation having<br>aact an impact on how we function as a<br>society right so it can drive wedges<br>between people um it can and and indeed<br>some foreign powers deliberately try to<br>stoke that div division with<br>misinformation and it leads to things<br>like a lack of trust in the medical<br>system a lack of trust in the government<br>which all undermine sort of the basic<br>Bedrock of what we would need for a<br>solid Public Health um structure in New<br>Zealand so that's um a few just examples<br>of the kinds of negative impact that can<br>happen at different scales um so I'm<br>going to take a quick breef here and<br>just recap what I've covered so we know<br>that it's very difficult to Define<br>misinformation but we can think about it<br>broadly as false or mis misleading<br>information and it's useful to think<br>about it more as a spectrum in many<br>cases we know that people feel like<br>they're seeing lots of it in New Zealand<br>and we know that they're worried about<br>it and we know that it can have a range<br>of negative impacts both for the<br>individual but also wider<br>Society so now I'm going to talk a<br>little bit about some of the proposed<br>Solutions um it's a complex area so I'm<br>just going to touch on a few key ideas<br>um but to start off with you can sort of<br>lump these or at least I've decided to<br>lump these into two categories one<br>that's more focused on people and<br>improving people's resilience to<br>misinformation and another that's<br>focused more on the sources of<br>misinformation so so online platforms<br>and and ways that we might limit how<br>much misinformation is provided for on<br>those so starting with the first set we<br>we see things like fact checking um this<br>stuff uh the the whole truth series is a<br>fact checking series run by stuff I<br>think it's very good um and it's it's<br>it's very useful to have that but it's<br>not sufficient in itself um fact cheing<br>takes time uh and not everybody who<br>reads the fact check sort of report or<br>article um not everyone who's seen the<br>original misinformation is going to see<br>the fact check so it's very difficult to<br>scale up um we've also seen people in<br>New Zealand calling for more education<br>in schools so um making media literacy<br>or digital literacy part of the<br>curriculum and they'll often point to<br>Finland as an example of a country<br>that's done this really well so um there<br>there is pressure to to sort of focus on<br>the education space when addressing this<br>information but that does mean that<br>you're just limiting it to young people<br>and there are a whole lot of people<br>who've already been through school who<br>are also being expose to misinformation<br>so there are a number of initiatives<br>that try to tr upskill people or or<br>provide<br>resources that can give people more<br>resilience to misinformation they get<br>better at spotting it they're less<br>likely to fall for certain claims and<br>I've highlighted an example here from my<br>colleagues in the UK which was a series<br>of games that are sort of designed to to<br>teach you some of the Hallmarks of<br>misinformation and I particularly like<br>these ones because one they've been<br>empirically tested but two they actually<br>they're very scalable they're things<br>that you can get out to hundreds of<br>thousands if not millions of people and<br>hopefully have some impact on the other<br>side of the coin there is things that we<br>should be doing on the platform side so<br>I'm talking largely about social media<br>platforms here um where a lot of the<br>focus has been so you know there is a<br>list I've shown here of different ways<br>that these platforms can try to limit<br>the impact of misinformation from from<br>outright removing it or Banning people<br>to changes in how their systems promote<br>different kinds of information and to<br>some extent all the major platforms have<br>been doing um at least some of these but<br>it varies and it's entirely on a sort of<br>voluntary basis at least in New Zealand<br>um however there's work currently<br>underway that is trying to develop a<br>framework for regulating online content<br>it's early days at the moment so the<br>department of internal affairs here in<br>New Zealand has held a consultation on<br>the first steps towards developing a<br>regulatory framework they've um listened<br>to a lot of people they're due to report<br>back in December so next month and<br>should hear more about um at least the<br>information that's coming from that<br>process and ideally what the next steps<br>are in sort of coming up with ways to<br>regulate online<br>platforms there's also a group that's<br>been convened by the department of prime<br>minister and cabinet which draws<br>together a number of experts and people<br>from Civil Society to work together to<br>try and chart a course um of how New<br>Zealand's going to respond to miss and<br>disinformation and I imagine they'll be<br>looking through a lot of the things I've<br>just briefly covered in this talk and<br>they are also due to report back in<br>December so it's a case of watch this<br>space um in terms of finding out what<br>the next steps are for New Zealand in<br>this<br>process there's just one other thing I'd<br>like to add um which I haven't really<br>talked about which is not misinformation<br>but the idea of putting good information<br>out there and having what we'd call a a<br>healthy information landscape and that's<br>where my work at the public health<br>communication Center comes in uh we<br>among other things run websites where<br>Public Health researchers and<br>practitioners write commentary and<br>Analysis on um breaking news government<br>policy and a range of other issues with<br>a focus on making it more accessible to<br>the public and policy makers and and<br>trying to make clear some of the key<br>points um so I've highlighted a few<br>examples here uh if you're interested go<br>and have a look at our website phc.org<br>NZ um and if you want to stay up to date<br>you can hit the Big Orange subscribe<br>Buton at the top that's my plug for the<br>the public health communication Center<br>I'm almost out of time so I'm going to<br>stop there and just say um thank you for<br>your attention and<br>time John thanks very much again for<br>extremely elucidating um uh commentary<br>from you uh there are lots of Applause<br>coming through and thumbs up and uh I<br>see that uh there's a few questions in<br>the the uh Q&amp;A and Sue has been very<br>kindly replying to ones related to her<br>so maybe John you might like to have a<br>quick look and see if there's something<br>there that you could respond to directly<br>um I'd like now to move on to um uh<br>welcoming um Helen Fitz who is a public<br>health lecturer at our Christ Church<br>campus and she is a researcher and<br>transport and I should say and also<br>sustainable transport and today she's<br>going to talk about the EV at the top of<br>the cliff thanks very much<br>Helen thank you John can I just ask you<br>to stop your screen sharing so that I<br>you Yoto in<br>1895 Joseph marins wrote a poem<br>describing the debate that a population<br>was having about whether to build a<br>fence at the top of a cliff to stop<br>people falling off or whether to provide<br>an ambulance at the bottom the ambulance<br>W out largely because some of the uh the<br>characters in the poem argued that<br>falling off a cliff doesn't actually do<br>anybody any harm it's the stopping at<br>the bottom which is problematic and<br>therefore it's at the bottom that we<br>need to intervene now this story has<br>become something of a parable of Public<br>Health and many of us would argue that<br>actually preventing harms before they<br>happen is easier it's cheaper it's more<br>effective and it's undeniably less<br>unpleasant than preventing harm after<br>it's taken place today what I want to do<br>is talk about some of the harms that are<br>that come about through our current and<br>future Transport Systems and I want to<br>do that because if we're thinking about<br>building some of those metaphorical<br>fences to prevent harm before it happens<br>we need to understand what harm it is<br>that we're actually trying to pre um to<br>prevent so I want to start with harms<br>from current transport<br>and particularly when we're talking<br>about Cliffs and fences then perhaps the<br>most obvious thing that Springs to mind<br>is the road toll now I'm very happy to<br>report that the occupants of this car<br>did both survive but we probably all are<br>aware of fact that in New Zealand<br>between three and 400 people die every<br>year on New Zealand roads that I think<br>is as I say fairly welln but perhaps<br>less<br>welln is that we actually also have<br>impacts from local Air Pollution which<br>have a higher toll than those from<br>collisions and<br>accidents in 2016 motor vehicle<br>emissions um and other pollutants<br>resulted in nine in over 9,000<br>hospitalizations and over 2,000 deaths<br>our current Transport Systems of course<br>also contribute to climate change which<br>in turn uh contributes to impacts on<br>human health through things like like<br>volatile weather um sea level rise and<br>population<br>displacement the way we get around can<br>also contribute to congestion which in<br>turn has it increases the impacts that<br>we feel from uh pollution um and it also<br>has its own impacts in terms of things<br>like stress and congestion even has<br>measurable impacts on things like Family<br>Violence traffic also can lead to<br>community Severance so roads bisect or<br>cut through human and animal communities<br>with implications there for safety and<br>for Community<br>cohesion and the paving that we use to<br>surface our roads and our car Parks can<br>increase uh flooding risks and can also<br>uh contribute to biodiversity loss and<br>takes up valuable land which we might<br>use for other useful social purposes<br>were it not for that<br>use then we come to sedentary LIF St now<br>this picture is from uh Wally the movie<br>um and in Wally the uh the people get<br>around in robot driven chairs um<br>everywhere they go having long since<br>lost the ability to stand to walk or to<br>run now Wally isn't based on rigorous<br>academic evidence um and the real world<br>is a whole lot more complicated than<br>this having people with all sorts of<br>different physical abilities but it<br>Remains the case that uh not getting<br>enough exercise in our life can have ser<br>serious health consequences and often<br>the way that we get around is a<br>contributor to how much exercise we do<br>or don't<br>get inaccessibility and social exclusion<br>can also have uh serious health<br>consequences it's often the case that<br>when um a large number of the people in<br>a population use a particular way of<br>getting around when certain people are<br>unable to use that way of getting around<br>for whatever reason they can find it<br>difficult to access important amenities<br>like uh healthc care facilities<br>workplaces shops and social venues and<br>when people are unable to access uh<br>those amenities it can lead to social<br>exclusion or to people not being able to<br>participate in society in the way that<br>others might and in some research that<br>colleagues and I have done with uh<br>residents in social housing provision<br>seven out of 10 of our participants told<br>us that transport difficulties or costs<br>meant that at least occasionally they<br>couldn't visit a doctor they couldn't go<br>grocery shopping and they couldn't meet<br>friends or relatives and each of these<br>things has serious health consequences<br>associated with it social uh exclusion<br>on its own has been described as having<br>similar health effects as smoking so<br>people who are experiencing even just<br>that social uh exclusion aspect um can<br>be facing serious health consequences<br>and finally in our catalog here of<br>impacts of uh transport we have urban<br>sprawl now our the size and shape of our<br>urban areas is inherently linked to the<br>way that we get around so when most<br>people walk we locate our amenities in<br>dense compact walkable Urban centers<br>when people get around primarily using<br>public transport we start to locate a<br>amuni is more in Corridor type patterns<br>and when people get around using<br>personal vehicles we're more likely to<br>locate our amenities in more distributed<br>patterns and that can help generate<br>urban sprawl and urban sprawl itself is<br>often considered to be a bad thing<br>because it exacerbates all of the things<br>that we've talked about so far but it<br>also makes it much more uh difficult and<br>more expensive to provide things for the<br>population so things like uh three<br>Waters provision<br>and collection of rubbish become<br>difficult when urban areas<br>expand so what we can see here is that<br>transport and health impacts are<br>intricately connected in many different<br>ways and this has been a very quick<br>overview of some of these but I want to<br>start thinking now about where that<br>leads us to uh in future and I want to<br>start doing that by looking at some of<br>the changes that we can expect to see in<br>future transport I want to do that<br>because when we look at the world around<br>us like this it can often seem that many<br>of these problems are<br>intractable uh things are the way they<br>are and it's remarkably difficult to<br>change them but if we look at transport<br>history and learn the lessons of<br>Transport history we can see that things<br>can change very very quickly indeed so<br>for example if you were a child in the<br>early<br>1800s it's uh it's quite likely that if<br>you wanted to go to a neighboring town<br>Village you would have been walking or<br>using some kind of horsepower to<br>transport to get there but by the end of<br>your lifetime it's entirely plausible<br>that you would have traveled by steam<br>train by Electric Train by electric car<br>by combustion petrol or diesel car and<br>also by bicycle so in the space of a<br>single human lifetime we saw our<br>transport system undergo remarkable<br>change now this was quite an unusual<br>period in our transport history history<br>but that said things are changing all<br>the time and if we take a proactive uh<br>approach to what our future transport<br>looks like then there's good potential<br>that we might be able to mitigate some<br>of the uh the less good effects of our<br>Transport Systems while also benefiting<br>from the positive ones so if we come<br>back then to our future transport what<br>does future transport have in store for<br>us well let's start with electric<br>vehicles electric vehicles are already<br>making up um in an increasing size of<br>our vehicle Fleet and they're often<br>argued to be good primarily from uh the<br>point of view of climate change and cl<br>climate change is absolutely very<br>important but when we consider electric<br>vehicles we also have to consider the<br>other impacts that they might have less<br>well known than climate change I think<br>is perhaps the potential that electric<br>vehicles have to change our road Road<br>top now electric vehicles feel different<br>to drive compared to combustion driven<br>Vehicles they're smoother they're<br>quieter and they uh they often have much<br>better acceleration much higher<br>acceleration and as a consequence of<br>feeling better feeling different people<br>drive electric vehicles<br>differently in some research that I did<br>with electric vehicle owners most of the<br>people I talked to told me that when<br>they drive an EV they usually drive it<br>more conservatively than combustion<br>driven car and part of the reason for<br>that is that driving aggressively<br>depletes the battery more quickly but<br>many of my participants also told me<br>that they do like to take advantage of<br>the special characteristics of an EV one<br>of my participants told me sometimes I<br>drive it like I stole it just because I<br>can and another one said on occasion the<br>urge to Bogen overrides better judgment<br>now we don't know yet what the<br>implications of a more General shift to<br>electric vehicles uh is going to be but<br>as we consider how to address our road<br>toll in future the changing changes in<br>driver Behavior are certainly something<br>that we should be paying attention<br>to it's also worth noting that in terms<br>of pollution electric vehicles might<br>have less of a benefit than we may<br>expect while a shift to EV certainly<br>eliminates tailpipe emissions much of<br>the particular matter solution that<br>comes from uh vehicle transport actually<br>comes from non-exhaust emissions so it<br>comes from break tire and roadwar so if<br>we're going to shift to EVs and we're<br>concerned about those Lo those<br>implications of local transport we need<br>to consider how to reduce and mitigate<br>those emissions of particulate matter<br>and that might include driving less and<br>including more vegetation in our urban<br>areas we also know that when uh people<br>shift to EVS they often start to drive<br>more there are a number of reasons for<br>that that I don't have time to go into<br>but if we drive more then we have<br>implications for things like congestion<br>for Community Severance for Paving and<br>if we shift to driving instead of for<br>example walking to the dairy to buy milk<br>then also for those sedentary<br>Lifestyles if we move to ebikes though<br>ebikes have many of the advantages of<br>electric cars that make them so popular<br>including that they're fun they're a<br>cheap way of getting around and they<br>come without environmental guilt so if<br>we look at ebikes if we shift from<br>driving cars to riding ebikes we<br>potentially reduce some of those<br>pollution and congestion issues and we<br>increase the exercise that helps to<br>prevent some of those uh diseases of<br>inactivity we also potentially locate um<br>immunities in easily eable distance thus<br>minimizing our contribution to urban<br>sprawl and reducing those implications<br>on infrastructure<br>costs I want to talk very quickly about<br>driverless cars before I finish now<br>driverless cars are on their way and<br>they are widely expected to contribute<br>to urban sprawl if we don't do anything<br>proactive to prevent that so that's<br>something we need to think about before<br>they really get here but I want to<br>mostly focus on incl inaccess ability<br>and social inclusion and we often see<br>claims that driverless cars will help<br>people particularly with disabilities<br>and older people to get around in the<br>way that everybody else does and so<br>we'll improve Equity of Transport but I<br>think it's important to note that that<br>claim is based on a couple of somewhat<br>tenuous assumptions the first assumption<br>is that everyone will be able to access<br>driverless cars if everyone's to be able<br>to access driverless cars we will need<br>uh the access and booking systems for<br>those to be based on inclusive<br>principles and I think if we ask many<br>people with disabilities whether that's<br>something we can safely assume will<br>happen automatically they might tell us<br>it's safe it's not safe to make that<br>assumption the other assumption that is<br>made is that technology will be<br>affordable for those who need it most<br>now we know that at the moment some<br>people struggle to afford getting the<br>bus driverless cars are not going to be<br>cheaper than buses unless we<br>intentionally make them so which brings<br>us back to the point of this<br>presentation which is about where a<br>public health approach to transport can<br>be useful and I think where a public<br>health approach to transport can be<br>really useful is in two areas first it<br>can help us to understand the health<br>impacts of transport and hopefully today<br>I've given a bit of an overview of what<br>those are for current and potentially<br>for future transport and then a public<br>health approach can help us to plan for<br>Healthy Future future Transport Systems<br>now I know this has been a super quick<br>overview and we've only just scratched<br>the surface here today but I know that<br>Louise is about to talk about other ways<br>to engage with us in more depth and<br>colleagues and I would be delighted to<br>hear from anybody who wants to explore<br>that intersection between health and<br>transport in more detail for now though<br>I want to finish by saying I'm quite<br>often asked how transport is part of<br>Public Health and why I'm particularly<br>interested in transport technology but I<br>thought I'd let Joseph marins answer<br>that question for me with the words of<br>one of his protagonists from his 1895<br>poem come neighbors and friends let us<br>rally if the cliff we will fence we<br>might almost dispense with the ambulance<br>down in the<br>valley thank you and back to you<br>Louise uh K thank you very much Helen<br>nice to have some poetry uh today um<br>would you all join with me in thanking<br>very much Sue uh John and Helen for<br>their marvelous presentations this<br>morning and this this afternoon in<br>fact<br>um we've had a few questions in the Q&amp;A<br>and um people have been answering them<br>so again if uh John Helen and Sue would<br>just go and check um it would be good to<br>have you answer those questions if<br>possible and iner was going to just put<br>up some last closing slides for us um<br>today uh if you've enjoyed or been<br>inspired by uh what these three<br>wonderful people have been telling you<br>today uh and would' be interested in<br>doing some further study in public<br>health we've got a range of postgraduate<br>opportunities both uh in Christ Church<br>and Wellington as well as in our home<br>campus in denen there's a choice of 19<br>papers and you can tailor uh those to<br>your interest and start at a number of<br>stages throughout the year uh we also<br>are very keen to talk to people about<br>the possibility of doing phds and uh<br>have uh quite a few between us all uh<br>across the<br>Motu uh and then also if um a longer<br>piece of study is not for you you might<br>want to join us at our next summer<br>school uh in 2024 in February here in<br>person in Wellington some also uh out of<br>Oakland um and a number on line as well<br>we've got 18 short courses this year so<br>one or two days um by and large uh<br>courses for you to upskill in um some of<br>the current issues in that are very<br>topical and the new information that's<br>available and also um uh to do some of<br>those sort of fundamental things like<br>introduction to ha Mari for example<br>which are critical for all of us in our<br>Mah and<br>Al so again um I would um like just to<br>close with a cut here but before I do so<br>um could I um ask you all to join with<br>me once more and thanking everybody uh<br>our three speakers for um their<br>today we're early but it's uh lunchtime<br>and maybe you can all go and have a<br>quick stroll or see some sunshine but<br>not in Wellington I<br>suspect uh I'll just close with K so if<br>me K everybody keep well thank you very<br>us</p></main><footer style="margin-top: 2rem; background: #0001; padding: 2rem; text-align: center;"><p>We Are The University</p><ul style="list-style-type: none; padding:
