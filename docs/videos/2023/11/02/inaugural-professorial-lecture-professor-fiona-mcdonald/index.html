the<br>University of itago and it gives me<br>great pleasure that my final<br>introduction for an IPL tonight is in<br>honor of Professor Fiona McDonald<br>someone who I have known for a very long<br>time on behalf of the University I would<br>like to begin my comments this evening<br>by welcoming some special people in<br>Fiona's life who are here with us this<br>evening her husband<br>Graham yep here their children Matthew<br>Daniel and<br>Laura her parents Gordon and<br>Elaine and her sister Claire and<br>Claire's partner Simon and children<br>George Ally and Lily and her friends<br>Helen Lori and Fran and her<br>parents-in-law Ry and Marilyn are<br>joining us on the live stream now it's<br>absolutely fantastic that all of you<br>could be here this evening the presence<br>of so many special people in Fiona's<br>life is a very clear signal of the<br>importance of tonight's<br>event as I look around I'd also like to<br>acknowledge um professional and academic<br>staff and students from the University<br>of itago and members of The Wider denan<br>Community as well as our Chancellor Dr<br>reyen Somerville um who have all come to<br>share in this celebration on behalf of<br>the University nomai hadami<br>welcome now these ipls are a time of<br>great celebration for us here at the<br>University of itago and I'm delighted to<br>see so many people who are here to mark<br>this incredible uh landmark in Fiona's<br>amazing<br>career now as you will have heard me say<br>many times over the last decade getting<br>here is never<br>easy a candidate for a professorship<br>must demonstrate Excellence across all<br>aspects of their portfolio teaching<br>research and service they must not only<br>meet atago's exacting standards but<br>their work is also scrutinized by<br>internationally recognized experts in<br>their area of<br>research now as you will learn tonight<br>Professor McDonald has an international<br>reputation as a first class<br>researcher her research has all the<br>Hallmarks of a well-respected<br>scientist she's published in top<br>International journals in her field her<br>work is highly cited and over the years<br>she has earned significant external<br>funding in a highly competitive research<br>environment she has also made a<br>substantial contribution to the training<br>of research<br>students as you will also learn this<br>evening Professor McDonald is a<br>passionate and gifted<br>teacher she excels not only in<br>traditional lecturing in a classroom but<br>she has also been heavily involved in<br>curriculum development she's played a<br>significant role in the revision of our<br>very very large um first year health<br>science program and as the chair of that<br>committee I have found it an absolute<br>pleasure to work with her her care and<br>her compassion for our students is<br>palpable and her calm University<br>centered approach to decision-making has<br>been<br>outstanding now throughout her career<br>Professor McDonald's service to her<br>discipline to her department and to the<br>university has been numerous substantial<br>and<br>valuable but last but not least um Fiona<br>is an extremely collegial member of our<br>academic community<br>she is never afraid to speak her mind<br>but she always does so in a careful and<br>considered way when Fiona has something<br>to say it pays to listen we're extremely<br>lucky to call her one of our own so<br>Fiona on behalf of the University of<br>itago it gives me great pleasure I'm G<br>to try desperately not to make you cry<br>by crying um to congratulate you on your<br>very very very well-earned professorship<br>um I feel personally proud that you were<br>one of the very first senior lecturers<br>that I mentored when I was the head of<br>the psychology department I really look<br>forward to your lecture this evening and<br>I'm now going to call on the slightly<br>Highland to tell us just a little bit<br>more about Fiona's path to Professor<br>ten<br>thank you Professor hay tenot tenot<br>tenot K welcome greetings greetings<br>greetings to you all um as um Professor<br>hay just said uh my role is to introduce<br>um uh Fiona's inaugural professorial<br>lecture and I want to spend a few<br>minutes reiterating and expanding on<br>some of the um points raised already so<br>it is my great pleasure and privilege uh<br>to introduce Fiona and also to add my<br>congratulations to this well-deserved<br>promotion so Fiona is a graduate of this<br>University she graduated with a BC first<br>class BC honors in<br>Biochemistry uh during which she won the<br>Edson<br>prize um in 1989 and and she went there<br>from there directly to a dill uh uh<br>training at Oxford which uh she<br>completed in<br>1993 uh having uh won a commonwealth PhD<br>scholarship from here Anderson Hughes<br>College um uh o College um uh Mary Lun<br>scholarship from Oxford itself she<br>completed her PhD in in perfect timing 3<br>years 1996 and went from there to the<br>Howard use Medical Institute for a<br>postdoctoral fellowship in Iowa United<br>States from that she was immediately<br>recruited uh to a Lector ship at<br>Victoria University of Wellington uh<br>where she excelled and was promoted to<br>senior lecture in 2001 that same year<br>she was head hunted here to otago to the<br>Department of<br>physiology um and uh um sorry the year<br>2001 when she was promoted to senior<br>Lector she was head hunted here and<br>um again performed exceedingly well was<br>promoted to associate professor in 2009<br>now with promotion to Prof Professor um<br>we we you know as as has been said<br>already we know that that reflects<br>excellence in uh performance but also<br>the step up to leadership leadership<br>that's sustained over an extended career<br>uh uh beside continued excellence and<br>performance so it's a major<br>achievement so just looking at that a<br>little bit in terms of service<br>leadership at the University f owner is<br>served uh as Deputy head of Department<br>looking after teaching um side of things<br>from 2013 to 2017 and I know personal<br>experience that um that Deputy role in a<br>department the size of<br>physiologies uh is the equivalent of a<br>of a headship a huge responsibility<br>which she undertook with calmness and uh<br>Effectiveness and led the department in<br>that aspect uh exceedingly well over<br>there that time um she's moved from<br>there to the headship full headship of<br>the department since<br>2018 in teaching side of leadership at<br>the same time as she was head of<br>Department she was the chair of the<br>papers committee um for the uh hubs 191<br>and 192 papers over the period of the<br>recent major revisions to those papers<br>considerable input and impact on<br>teaching to the single largest classes<br>the the largest classes here at otago<br>very important course in the context of<br>otago teaching and learning<br>experience she's been the chief course<br>adviser in the department of physiology<br>over the same time period since even<br>longer since<br>2014 and prior to that back in history<br>she was the course convenor for biology<br>115 which those of you have been around<br>long enough will remember was the<br>predecessor for hubs involved um very<br>large course uh looking after managing<br>staff effectively a department uh in in<br>many respects so a longstanding<br>tradition of excellence in leadership<br>and teaching at the University uh and<br>many more you know I could go on and on<br>with the roles and responsibilities that<br>Fiona has taken on and always done<br>exceptionally well over the years been<br>mentioned teaching performance Fiona you<br>know outstanding teacher uh in the<br>department she was a recipent of the<br>biomedical Sciences distinguished<br>academic teacher award in<br>2017 reflecting that and at the<br>interface of teaching and research uh as<br>again mentioned she's mentored more than<br>40 post-graduate students in her time uh<br>as an academic including five Masters<br>and and 14 PhD students and all of them<br>uh complete an excellent time and with<br>with wonderful outcomes for those<br>students terms of research outputs and<br>recognition um 2005 she won the New<br>Zealand Association of scientists<br>research medal uh 2011 was awarded a<br>full bright scholarship and she's funded<br>her her work with a succession of Grants<br>and engaged in highly fruitful National<br>and international<br>collaborations as a result of all that<br>she's uh um published uh as senior or<br>first author on multiple peer-reviewed<br>papers in high impact scientific<br>journals including cell journal of<br>clinical inves tigation proceedings of<br>National Academy of Sciences American<br>Journal of physiology Journal of<br>biological chemistry a wide range of<br>journals reflecting the breadth uh of<br>her research interests and um and<br>outputs also been invited or or<br>submitted and had accepted for<br>publication many major reviews in her<br>field including in the American Journal<br>of physiology there have multiple<br>sections in that journal so she's<br>included reviews in circulation<br>physiology<br>in cell physiology and renal physiology<br>and also in the journal heart failure<br>reviews and of course review journals<br>review articles very widely uh cited and<br>important um benchmarks in the in the<br>field interestingly and it's already<br>been mentioned um active in teaching and<br>learning related research and is<br>published also in the educational<br>literature so the research directions if<br>I can summarize for you I don't want to<br>take up too much of her talk but but<br>Fiona's research focused on the control<br>of blood pressure by the kidney and salt<br>or sodium in other words uh in the blood<br>can have an important impact on blood<br>pressure Fiona's work addresses this at<br>the cellular and molecular levels in<br>particular she'll be talking I think<br>quite a lot probably today about a<br>particular um component of cell<br>membranes in the kidney the epithelial<br>sodium Channel which is a critical<br>mediator of sodium effects in the kidney<br>and her work I'm sure I'm going to leave<br>her to describe how her work relates to<br>the function of this channel uh and how<br>important it is for regulating normal<br>blood pressure she's also contributed in<br>that line to work on covering how<br>mutations in that channel contribute to<br>specific clinical condition uh where<br>very high blood pressure occurs called<br>little syndrome and reflecting that<br>channel proteins almost never have a<br>single function in the body<br>um more recently her work has expanded<br>to into how changes in that sodium<br>Channel activity can affect breast<br>cancer cell<br>proliferation and migration and these<br>are important potential targets I think<br>for anti-cancer therapy into the future<br>so in her talk this evening Fiona I<br>think will share uh with us aspects of<br>her career Journey key research results<br>as well as perhaps I hope doving into<br>Reflections on teaching and learning<br>once again it's my pleasure and<br>privilege to introduce Professor<br>McDonald to you to deliver her inaugural<br>professorial lecture Dan K<br>for OT<br>to<br>Tom<br>sorry kak to nor Ro a Gordon ra elain<br>ten thank you Professor Hayne and<br>Professor Highland for your very kind<br>and generous<br>introductions um<br>and I'm really um privileged to be able<br>to share with you my my journey to being<br>able to deliver this um<br>IPL along the way I'll mention just a<br>few of the people who have been<br>important in in my<br>journey friends family students and<br>research staff collaborators colleagues<br>and mentors they're all part of of My<br>Success and um I guess I'll start by<br>saying that my Story begins in Roxboro<br>you've probably passed through it going<br>to Alexandra or wer or Queenstown it's<br>the home of Jimmy's pies I work there<br>for several<br>Summers I grew up on the east side of<br>the<br>river so this is a picture from the<br>1970s and my parents ran um a sheep farm<br>here in an<br>orchard and it was a a lovely a lovely<br>way to grow up grow up there um<br>um with some you know it was her Farm<br>was in the family for a few Generations<br>um<br>so yeah hence the architecture and I<br>grew up with my parents and two sisters<br>uh CLA and Lauren and we traveled uh<br>down this road uh to the end to catch<br>the school bus and we attended roxby<br>area school here's a photo from me in<br>uh this area is not part of our family<br>anymore if you go past and go up<br>keniston Road this is now large scale<br>cherries so I left Rox for actually<br>pretty young I was about 12 and a half<br>and I moved to ult py den Eden where I<br>came to high school I was a border at uh<br>Tolan and went to St<br>Hilda's this as you can imagine was a<br>pretty formative experience leaving home<br>having to become independent um making<br>decisions for myself but on reflection<br>you know there's a couple of other<br>things that I really felt set me up<br>quite well and that was gaining<br>excellent study<br>skills so we had supervised compulsory<br>prep for 2 hours a night on weekdays and<br>that uh carried on right through the 5<br>years of high school and so I developed<br>really excellent study skills which yeah<br>put me in good stead for for later um<br>later<br>study um I also uh realized how much<br>knowledge there was out there and loved<br>learning about so many diverse topics<br>you might be surprised to know that I<br>failed my first science test in form<br>three and I was probably more interested<br>in um history and and English for the<br>first few years of high school but I<br>took biology and chemistry right through<br>um to form seven and I had a wonderful<br>chemistry teacher Mrs GES and I did fall<br>in love with chemistry at at that time I<br>did consider going to Teachers College<br>at the end of high school to become a<br>primary school teacher but in the end I<br>um somewhere um decided that University<br>was the place for me even though I was<br>first in my family to attend University<br>so I didn't really know what to expect<br>however I enrolled in a BC majoring in<br>chemistry so along with my chemistry<br>papers I was taking um<br>biology and math and computer science<br>papers and as part of one of those<br>biology papers there was a biochemistry<br>component it didn't have its own subject<br>at FY like it does now and that really<br>hooked me because it was chemical<br>reactions that were related to how cells<br>worked and how our bodies worked so I<br>ended up um completing a major in both<br>um chemistry and biochemistry and when<br>it came to my fourth year I had to<br>decide which department to do my honors<br>degree in what I'd really<br>uh found that I I loved thinking and<br>working um with proteins so our proteins<br>are kind of uh the structural components<br>that our genes code for very important<br>for how our cells function and I was<br>interested in how those proteins sort of<br>moved around the cell that were sent to<br>the right location and how they were<br>regulated so for my honors project I was<br>matched with uh Mari griger shown here<br>and he had a lab at that time shared<br>with Warren Tate shown here and um the<br>were the joining lab was Clive tropman<br>um and there was a wonderful really<br>supportive group of students and staff<br>uh in that lab area and yeah it was a<br>great introduction to um to research<br>muray had an interest in how uh during<br>lactation the iron levels of the milk<br>remained High Enough to feed um the pups<br>and my project was looking at a protein<br>called fertin which was AO is a storage<br>protein for for<br>iron it turned out that it wasn't<br>probably wasn't the most important<br>factor for maintaining iron levels but<br>certainly my work contributed to<br>Murray's ongoing work and it looked like<br>the protein transferin um which uh<br>circulates in the blood carrying iron it<br>seemed to be really important for again<br>for the milk to have enough iron for the<br>pups<br>um so I graduated in<br>1989 and here's a picture of me in the<br>biem department um just before heading<br>down to the town<br>hall now between my third and fourth<br>years of study I had the a wonderful<br>opportunity to go to Cambra over the<br>summer and do a summer research project<br>at um a&amp;u I worked in Dr McKenzie's lab<br>purifying proteins from HS for ongoing<br>analysis now I only had this opportunity<br>because my chemistry friend<br>Jenny uh would go walk through the<br>archway and she saw a notice there that<br>said apply for these summer research<br>scholarships she was kind enough to<br>share that with me and we both applied<br>and we both accepted to go to Cur and we<br>joined this amazing group of Summer<br>Scholars um from Australia and New<br>Zealand there were 60 or 70 of us we<br>were all over living in the same college<br>and then doing research projects around<br>the university and that's me in the<br>circle and I think that was a really<br>pivotal moment because uh the<br>conversations between all these uh<br>different students including uh my good<br>friend Eve who was who I met there they<br>were all discussing doing their phds in<br>the UK or the US and I sort of hadn't<br>thought about what I'd do after my<br>degree and um that really put in my mind<br>that oh you know I could actually do an<br>OE by going overseas to to do a<br>PhD so during my honors year um my<br>supervisor Mari grigor was really um<br>encouraging and I applied for several<br>scholarships and as um Dr Highland<br>mentioned I was offered a commonwealth<br>scholarship in the UK at the University<br>of Oxford um which I took up in mck's<br>1989 I joined the lab of Dr John Heath<br>shown here and he was a relatively new<br>new lecturer at that time but he had<br>gathered around um him an amazing group<br>of um developmental biologists people<br>who understood how to make Mouse um<br>transgenic models and people working on<br>signaling Pathways again it was a Wonder<br>wonderful environment very supportive<br>environment to to do my<br>PhD um John asked me to study a protein<br>called fiberblast growth factor 4 very<br>very little was known about it but it<br>did seem to be important during<br>development and there was a new<br>technology that was yeah really very new<br>and that was making mice that had a<br>single Gene deleted quite a long process<br>but um he had all the tools and we had<br>the support so I started trying to make<br>this knockout Mouse model um so that we<br>could find out what fgf4 did during<br>development well um I was very uh work<br>very hard I made multiple targeting<br>constructs and was able to delete the<br>gene in cells and culture but<br>unfortunately we didn't get to the mouse<br>to make the the mouse model um however I<br>did lots of other work on fgfs and fgf<br>receptors and was able to submit my<br>thesis in the middle of uh<br>1992<br>um and I like many um<br>students perseverance is a skill that<br>you learn when you're doing uh your pH D<br>I did a lot of screening a lot of<br>growing cells and a lot of negative<br>results and I think that does set us up<br>well we have the the negative results<br>but we also have those Shining Moments<br>where um we get the the result that we<br>um we're looking<br>for um I was also of course able to<br>experience the unique environment that<br>is Oxford um living in a college um that<br>was St Hughes rowing<br>for um for my college and another real<br>uh looking back key event was the<br>lifelong friends that I made there and<br>so this includes um Julie Helen<br>Katherine this is not from the 1980s<br>this is where we actually had a reunion<br>um a few years ago the first time we'd<br>been together since we were um studying<br>in Oxford and it was Helen who was the<br>one who taught me how to make all these<br>uh transgenic Mouse models and as a<br>little bit of a payback I was able to<br>provide some reagents to her and it was<br>her work who showed that fgf4 was really<br>important for Lum development during um<br>embryonic<br>development so I I uh finished my thesis<br>I<br>graduated and again end of a degree had<br>to think about what to do<br>next well I decided that I wasn't quite<br>ready to come home and that while I love<br>development of ology I wanted to do<br>something that was a bit more um had a<br>personal<br>connection so we have cystic fibrosis<br>running in our family and my little<br>sister died with CF when she was<br>11 so I thought this might be a great<br>time to look to work in a cystic<br>fibrosis lab and fortunately I'd been<br>asked to present my work at a Cold<br>Spring Harbor conference in the US so I<br>um traveled there and visited a few Labs<br>including<br>the lab of Mike Walsh at the University<br>of Iowa and this um he is a giant in the<br>cystic fibrosis field he showed that the<br>the protein that is mutated in cystic<br>fibrosis is a chloride Channel and that<br>actually the major mutation causes the<br>protein to be mrack it's not taken to<br>the to its correct location in the cell<br>so it was a really<br>um I was really looking forward um to<br>working with Mike and fortunately he did<br>offer me a position um however I ended<br>up not working exactly in the CF field<br>but this is where I started working on<br>the epithelial sodium Channel or<br>ench so I moved to Iowa in in March 1993<br>so I went from barmy Central at tago to<br>the Midwest here's Iowa well known for<br>its cornfields um to I don't know a<br>couple of feet of snow and Mike um I<br>mean he picked me up from the airport<br>that was um pretty cool he took me out<br>for breakfast and he put a paper in<br>front of me on the<br>table and this paper had been published<br>in nature about 3 weeks beforehand and<br>it described the cloning of an<br>epithelial sodium Channel and it was a<br>channel that was known to be present<br>particularly in the kidney and no one<br>had been able to clone the genan um for<br>this protein and it was actually<br>herculan task by Cecilia Kessa and ber<br>Bernard rosier's<br>lab and this um this protein was<br>predicted to be really important for<br>controlling body fluids and to have<br>relevance for cystic fibrosis and also<br>for blood pressure<br>regulation so Mike asked me to clone the<br>human equivalent of this Gene because<br>kessa's Gene was from rats and so um<br>that was my first task but before I<br>describe that work I'm going to to give<br>you a short lesson in kidney<br>physiology all right so you've all got<br>two kidneys and they have a very<br>important role in filtering the blood<br>they take your waste products and those<br>waste products move to the bladder so<br>they can be expelled and the urine<br>whereas other components are recycled<br>back into the blood now in each of your<br>kidneys you have about a million<br>nephrons and these are small tubes and I<br>have a just a a demonstra ation of what<br>a nephrine might look like so it's a<br>tube this clear thing here and it's<br>closely connected with blood vessels and<br>there's a filter but like a serve or a<br>colander at the top here where small<br>chemicals can move from the blood into<br>this tube and it points along the way<br>some of those chemicals like sodium or<br>water or glucose can be brought back<br>into the blood and what comes out of the<br>end is the<br>urine so if you opened up this tube and<br>put it flat<br>it would look something like this so<br>around the tube are epithelial<br>cells and then this is the uh components<br>of the blood moving down the tube and<br>eventually forming the urine well small<br>chemicals like sodium and water and<br>glucose they can actually be rescued so<br>here's a sodium molecule moving through<br>that epithelial cell and back into the<br>blood but some of the sodium will<br>inevitably be lost lost in the urine<br>water can do the same thing and it can<br>be recycled into the<br>blood so that means that the body can<br>collect back what it can't afford to to<br>lose so sodium water glucose and a lot<br>of other ions and chemicals but waste<br>products can be um expelled in the urine<br>so how does this relate to blood<br>pressure<br>well um sorry<br>here if you increase the amount of<br>sodium that's moving into the blood then<br>will be pulled Along by osmosis and this<br>will increase the volume of blood in<br>your blood vessels and that will<br>increase your blood pressure because<br>your heart has to work harder to pump<br>all of that blood around your body now<br>high blood pressure is a risk factor for<br>heart attacks kidney<br>disease um stroke and other<br>cardiovascular complications normally a<br>body has keeps their blood pressure at a<br>normal range but your kidney has an<br>important role in controlling um blood<br>pressure through through this sodium um<br>reabsorption pathway of course your<br>heart blood vessels and brain and other<br>important so these epithelial cells<br>these are facing the external<br>environment so they only pick certain<br>chemicals that can be brought back into<br>the body they have to be very careful<br>about what comes back in so there's a<br>gate here that allows this only the<br>sodium to come back into the cell and<br>that gate is this epithelial sodium<br>Channel which allows sodium to move move<br>um into a cell and then that sodium can<br>move out into the blood via a different<br>mechanism so the epithelial sodium<br>Channel enac we now know is actually<br>made up of three subunits alpha beta and<br>gamma and together they transport sodium<br>into a cell and the prediction was when<br>uh this channel was originally cloned<br>that if there was too much enac sitting<br>in those epithelial cells you get too<br>much sodium moving into the body and<br>that might cause high blood pressure or<br>if there was too little then all the<br>sodium was being lost in the urine and<br>that would probably cause low blood<br>pressure however in um 1993 we didn't we<br>didn't know a lot of these mechanisms<br>and remember I said that my first task<br>as a postto I had to clone the human<br>gene for this um epithelial sodium<br>Channel now the human genome wasn't<br>published so I had to use traditional<br>cloning me methods fortunately the uh<br>Rat DNA sequence for a gene is normally<br>relatively similar about normally about<br>80% similar to human gene sequences so I<br>used part of that rat enac Gene and I<br>screened a human kidney DNA library and<br>I I pulled out the gene for human Alpha<br>enac we had to test whether it really<br>was the the human version of the gene uh<br>we found it was expressed where it would<br>expect it to be we found it in kidney<br>colon and Lung and then working with my<br>good friend and colleague Pete Snider he<br>carried out some sodium transport<br>measurements and we used a very well<br>known uh system of using um eggs from<br>zenopus um frogs and we could also use a<br>specific drug aide that was known to<br>inhibit this channel in Vivo in the<br>kidney so this is a a current Trace over<br>time and you can see that this line<br>represents sodium moving through a<br>channel and when a millerite is added<br>the the current is decreased down to<br>Baseline levels and that's reversible<br>and that gave us great confidence that<br>we cloned the human version of this<br>epithelial sodium Channel and we're able<br>to publish that well as I said there's<br>actually two more subunits and um<br>canessa at Al had published in 1994 that<br>there were two more subunits so we went<br>right we better clone the human versions<br>and my colleague and friend Maggie price<br>did one and I did the other and we were<br>able to show that um we could put all<br>those subunits together and give a<br>sodium Channel current that looked<br>pretty much like what had been measured<br>in Vivo so um a large aized sensitive<br>current was<br>generated this was uh you know it was a<br>very exciting time there are a lot of<br>people jumping on the enac<br>bandwagon things were happening quickly<br>people were looking at how the channel<br>was control<br>and whether it was implicated in high or<br>low blood pressure conditions in<br>humans and that came pretty quick the<br>first paper to show that ench was um you<br>know this is really a pivotal paper<br>because it showed that mutations in ench<br>could cause little syndrome which is an<br>inherited form of high blood<br>pressure<br>um and the mutation was specifically<br>found in the beta subunit um it has a<br>tail and and when the little mutation<br>was present that chopped off the last 75<br>amino acids and that paper was um<br>published from Rick lifton's lab in 1994<br>but there was no mechanism so we quickly<br>made some mutants and because um we<br>predicted that uh there would be<br>increased sodium transport through eneg<br>and that's exactly what we found so this<br>is again it's a bit um blurry um but<br>this is current measurements from the<br>wild typ enic Channel set at one and<br>when we made the exact Litt mutation in<br>the beta subunit um and put it together<br>with the other normal subunits we saw a<br>massive increase in current nearly<br>twofold and uh that can explain or go<br>partway to explain why um this mutation<br>in enac caused um the high blood<br>pressure but I will come back to that on<br>the opposite side of things if um Mike<br>Welsh was very keen to make some mouse<br>models because he wanted to know what<br>would happen when we deleted the enac<br>genes<br>and um we I actually had to I tried to<br>make another knockout Mouse fortunately<br>the technology had moved on quite a lot<br>and we were successful making that model<br>and it actually recapitulated the<br>symptoms of a human uh disorder known as<br>pseudo hypo ooster onism um or PHA um<br>which is an inherited form of low blood<br>pressure where your levels are low in<br>the blood and you're wasting all that<br>sodium into the urine and that had quite<br>model<br>okay<br>um so as I said you know we were doing a<br>lot of different work in Mike's lab it<br>was a a great to be<br>there and I had thought I'd carry on a<br>little longer but um my mom sticked it<br>she sent me a clipping from the<br>ODT lecturer in sell developmental<br>biology wanted in at Victoria University<br>in Wellington I sent off my CV didn't<br>really think much more about it but then<br>one day in the lab there was a phone<br>call and it was John<br>Miller um from Vic and he' called up to<br>interview me no<br>preparation um I don't remember many of<br>the questions except one where he said<br>aren't all those molecular techniques<br>really<br>expensive and I said well you know if I<br>was appointed I'd um just apply for<br>external grant funding to to pay for it<br>very naive um and that would you know<br>that would cover the<br>costs well hung up didn't think much<br>more about it but then a couple of days<br>later John called up again and offered<br>me the lecturer<br>position and it's quite different to the<br>um well and I had to decide you know I'd<br>had nearly three years as a postto I<br>could have gone on and learned a lot<br>more in Mike's lab but I also weighed up<br>that finding a lecturer position in New<br>Zealand in my field was going to be hard<br>and I also thought back to my commitment<br>when I'd to taken up the Commonwealth<br>scholarship that I was committing to<br>come back to New Zealand at some point<br>and so I said yes and in 1996 I moved<br>back to Wellington and joined the school<br>of biological sciences now there's a<br>couple of Reflections from that time<br>remember it's a new lecturer position<br>and the first is around curriculum<br>development well it turned out that the<br>cell and development mental biology<br>Focus was new for the school and it also<br>turned out that I had to develop a whole<br>new third-year paper to start in July I<br>arrived in March 24 lectures six labs<br>but it got it done it was great with<br>John's help and also um one of my other<br>mentors there Bill Jordan pulled pulled<br>that off students really enjoyed it not<br>then next John and I had to develop a<br>whole new second year salad and<br>developmental biology paper that um<br>rolled out the next semester another six<br>labs and 24 lectures for each of us um<br>however um it was perhaps that's what<br>set me off on the curriculum development<br>but it was a lot of fun and um again we<br>got good evaluations of that<br>course okay but I also of course had to<br>launch my independent research program<br>and I decided to focus on identifying<br>proteins that bind to enac thinking that<br>they would be Regulators of enac and<br>potentially blood blood pressure again<br>mentored by John and Bill Jordan I was<br>fortunate to be awarded an HRC project<br>funding also fortunate to hire a<br>research assistant Tracy far and started<br>a productive collaboration with sha lot<br>who was um at Messa University at that<br>time and um with Tracy's help we worked<br>on an unknown protein that I'd found in<br>Iowa to interact with enac it turned out<br>to be a protein called nid4 and actually<br>others in the field had also found that<br>this nid4 protein bound to Enoch so we<br>showed that this um nid4 protein bound<br>to each of the subunits and also very<br>importantly when we studied sodium<br>transport with current measurements um<br>we could measure plenty of current when<br>we just expressed enac alone but when we<br>added in the Ned four suddenly current<br>decreased so that told us that ned4 was<br>somehow inhibiting sodium transport and<br>one of our goals was to find out the<br>mechanism for<br>that however<br>um there was a physiological School<br>society meeting at Victoria and I met<br>Tony mcnight who is the a past h of<br>physiology and he invited me to<br>interview for a position here in<br>physiology at atago I think my friend<br>keth Dickinson has something to do with<br>that as well anyway I interviewed and an<br>offer was made and this it was a really<br>appealing um move because while I um<br>was pretty competent in doing a lot of<br>biochemical and molecular techniques I<br>did need some bit more help with the<br>function and there were several great<br>epithelial physiologists in the<br>department not only Tony but also Grant<br>B Kirk Hamilton um and John leader and<br>so this was a a good move for me so I<br>moved down to denen actually it's 20<br>April and I continued looking at control<br>Pathways for ench um and and I'll just<br>results first of all I'm I was able to<br>recruit a um an excellent PhD student<br>Dominick weth and he carried on looking<br>at this ned4 protein that we'd found<br>interacting with enac and as I said<br>others in the field were publishing in<br>this area as well and it turned out that<br>Ned 4 is an enzyme and it can catalyze<br>the attachment of a protein called<br>ubiqutin onto<br>enck and Dominic had the job or we came<br>up with this project where we would just<br>look at the membrane population of enac<br>and we and he showed that nid4 could<br>bind that um surface population of enac<br>tag the subunits with ubiquit in and<br>that would cause their internalization<br>into the cell so they couldn't transport<br>the sodium<br>anymore and from there the channel could<br>could be sent to Cellular compartments<br>and eventually<br>degraded and so that meant that you<br>could lower the amount of sodium coming<br>into the cells and this in in the kidney<br>pressure this also has relevance going<br>back to the little syndrome story I told<br>you how in little syndrome the mutation<br>removed the last uh few amino acids from<br>the beta<br>subunit and it turns out that this is<br>the exact area that the ned4 protein<br>binds<br>to so we think that n the lack of N4<br>binding has a really important um well<br>it's helped us understand the phenotype<br>of little syndrome and I'll show that<br>complicated cell model again but<br>essentially this ned4 protein uh cannot<br>bind to enac when there's a little<br>mutation so that means that the channel<br>can't be internalized from the membrane<br>and it can't oh I've got some crosses it<br>can't be sent for destruction so that<br>all those channels stay at the cell<br>surface and they're all moving sodium<br>into the cell and all that sodium moves<br>into the blood and that increases blood<br>pressure um which is the causing little<br>little<br>syndrome um in a second parallel um set<br>of projects I again was fortunate to<br>recruit post this postto wolfum bazio<br>and he was a fabulous mole<br>biologist and he said about doing<br>something called a used to hybrid screen<br>which is essentially where you really<br>don't have a hypothesis of what is<br>interacting with enac it's a wide open<br>screen and we actually chose to use um a<br>fourth uh human enac subunit the Delta<br>subunit that can substitute for Alpha<br>because no one had really looked at this<br>protein and wolfgar pulled out a protein<br>which at that time was known as m one<br>one and there was a single published<br>paper on this protein and it was about<br>bidlington Terrier dogs when they had a<br>mutation in this m one protein they<br>started to store copper in their liver<br>and that caused copper toxicosis and<br>death so clearly this protein was pretty<br>important but it didn't really relate to<br>to our sodium Channel but we did show<br>that m one could bind to the channel and<br>also um change the level of sodium being<br>transported through the channel<br>to complicate matters it turned out that<br>muan had brothers and<br>sisters it was a protein family and that<br>was described by isra buin um that there<br>were nine other members they had to be<br>called something different so the name<br>proteins now in<br>2011 um I started to think it might be<br>quite good to take some research and<br>study leave so I actually approached is<br>retin and asked asked if I could come<br>and work in his lab so that we could<br>learn more about the comdes because I'd<br>had various students working on the<br>different comes they all seemed to<br>interact with enac they all altered<br>sodium transport through the channel but<br>we still didn't really know what they<br>did so isra um said<br>yes and um in 2012 our family moved to<br>Texas where I worked with Ezra at UT<br>Southwestern Medical Center so um went<br>down very different climate in and<br>Dallas um and really enjoyed our time in<br>the Lone Star<br>State this was supported by a Fullbright<br>senior scholar award and also the<br>University of<br>aago seems I realized there was a theme<br>developing when I put this talk together<br>I was working on another knockout Mouse<br>at this time on a comd protein and um<br>isra had just developed this model and<br>it needed someone to characterize it so<br>that was me um again there was a<br>fabulous group of scientists to work<br>with lots of support and I was I did<br>work at the bench pretty much for the<br>whole year and I found that this the<br>comedy knockout was an embryonic<br>lethal and that so that meant that Comm<br>d10 was so important that um embryos<br>couldn't get through the full<br>term and I I think yeah I worked out<br>that it was needed around late<br>gastrulation that was a pivotal time but<br>I also found using cell um culture<br>experiments that the comedy 10 was also<br>needed for proteins to move to the<br>correct place in their cell um which was<br>a clue for actually what the now the<br>mechanism we now know that the comedies<br>work<br>through so that was uh<br>2012 uh when I returned in uh<br>2013 um I was really fortunate to hire<br>fabulous ARF Tanya Chong and also<br>recruit a PhD student um also fabulous<br>Adam<br>Weir and we set out to build on the work<br>that I'd been um doing in in Texas um<br>and with the collaboration of of with<br>isra and we now know that these comedy<br>proteins their role seems to be to<br>rescue ench from destruction so I'm<br>going to show you another cellular<br>model because I can actually fill in<br>another part of this pathway so I showed<br>you that Ned 4 was a negative regulator<br>of enac and it could drive enac coming<br>in from the membrane into the cell and<br>be degraded well this pathway can be<br>bypassed because these little ubiquit<br>and tags can be clipped off and that<br>leaves enac available to be<br>rescued and it does that by we think by<br>binding these comd proteins and they in<br>turn bined to a recycling complex such<br>as Reta and that means that this whole<br>sodium channel can move back to the cell<br>surface and do its job again bring the<br>sodium in um and help to be regulating<br>blood<br>pressure so a lot of our work has<br>supported this concept that this surface<br>population or membrane population of<br>enac has to be exquisitly controlled or<br>else if you have too much you get high<br>blood pressure too little you get low<br>blood pressure<br>under normal conditions we uh think that<br>this nid4 protein keeps relatively low<br>levels of enac at the at the membrane<br>but that can be inhibited if more<br>channels are needed or this recycling<br>pathway can also be increased so you've<br>enex so I'll give you a little break<br>from<br>enck and just mention a little bit about<br>um our Research into teaching and<br>learning<br>so as teachers we all want to uh give<br>our students um a great experience but<br>we also want them to gain a deep<br>understanding of the field that they're<br>studying so that they can go on to<br>develop new knowledge solve problems and<br>develop their own critical analysis<br>skills so I had the opportunity uh when<br>we were developing the human body<br>systems papers back in 2006 2007 to<br>study the effect of curriculum changes<br>and the time of study on student<br>approaches to learning now you might not<br>have looked at this thought about this<br>before but maybe um think about for<br>yourself how you go about learning do<br>you take a surface approach we just<br>memorize everything don't really think<br>about what it means and you know put<br>that down on<br>paper or do you take a deeper approach<br>to learning which we would prefer where<br>you're seeking meaning in that<br>information and um relating ideas and<br>getting excited about what it means for<br>for for The Wider<br>picture there's also in the literature<br>and defined a strategic appro approach<br>which where students will change their<br>approach to learning depending on<br>external pressures like is this<br>assignment due or do I need to do these<br>other<br>things so when the hubs papers were<br>developed I uh ended up being the<br>convenor of hubs 192 and John Reynolds<br>was the convenor of hubs 191 and we were<br>really fortunate to collaborate with<br>Rachel spren Smith and Carol Bond and<br>others from<br>HC and we looked to see whether the that<br>new curriculum we were developing could<br>um promote a deep approach to learning<br>in our<br>students and so we followed this cohort<br>of students not only through 2007 but<br>also into 2009 and we had those students<br>fill out a a reputable reputable survey<br>which gave us some Clues about their<br>approaches to learning and even within a<br>single year we saw that the extent of<br>deep learning increased as did the<br>Strategic Learning and their surface<br>learning approaches um seem to be less<br>and I guess gratifying um at the end of<br>their studies these third-year students<br>were using deep approaches to learning<br>to a great extent as well as their<br>Strategic Learning but they were still<br>doing um surface learning as well with<br>our to memorize some material so that<br>resulted in a in a couple of public<br>Publications and that was a a nice um<br>parallel pathway um into re and<br>researching into that those learning<br>approaches but I'm going to uh finish up<br>now with a our our newest research area<br>which is Professor Highland indicated is<br>looking at enac and breast cancer so<br>you've got m epithelia in in breasts and<br>enac not surprisingly is expressed there<br>now it was on the advice of a visiting<br>scientist from ukq um Greg Monte who<br>works on iron channels and cancer and he<br>suggested that we should look at<br>enac and he pointed us to a database of<br>uh women and an international database<br>which collects information about women<br>with breast cancer and it looks at which<br>are expressed in the level of of that<br>gene expression and just from<br>interrogating that database we could see<br>that um those women with breast cancer<br>who had a poor prognosis had very low<br>enac levels and in the opposite scenario<br>high levels of enex seem to correlate<br>with good<br>prognosis so uh we uh have a team now in<br>physiology some shown here and um<br>fantastic collaborators in pathology and<br>um Adam we're spearheaded this project<br>and we cobbled together money from<br>various different funding agencies and<br>started looking to see whether enac<br>really could have a role on breast<br>cancer and we use cell culture models so<br>I've talked to you about ench it's an<br>epithelial sodium channel it's found in<br>epithelial cells and epithelial cells<br>have a very distinct um not only<br>function but um shape and structure<br>they are very tightly bound to each<br>other they're facing the external<br>environment so they have to control<br>What's um coming into the body and they<br>sit on a dense fibrous mat that they're<br>they're joined tightly to they're also<br>polarized which means that proteins like<br>ench are only found on one membrane or<br>the other ench always faces the external<br>environment but other proteins different<br>proteins are down here now in cancer um<br>epithelial cells can change their<br>morphology to um a state that's referred<br>to as a mesenchimal cell so they can<br>lose their connections with their<br>neighbors and with that underlying<br>Matrix and they can also take on<br>different properties such as a high rate<br>of cell division which is a Hallmark of<br>cancer whereas epithelial cells tend to<br>have a a pretty low rate of of cell<br>division so we ask the question well<br>what would happen if we Chang the levels<br>of<br>enck<br>uh sorry one more Arrow um it turns out<br>that this process is reversible and it's<br>referred to as epithelial mimal<br>plasticity or um transition so um it is<br>possible for cells to go one way and um<br>but also to move back from a Meen kimal<br>to a more epithelial uh state so we set<br>up the experiment where we increase the<br>numbers of enac channels in the mean<br>kimal breast cancer cell so we add added<br>more enac and that seemed to push them<br>back into this epithelial more<br>epithelial State probably more correctly<br>to say that they became less mean kimal<br>and they had a lower rate of cell<br>division and I'll just show you one<br>result from from this where um Adam<br>carried out a a cell proliferation essay<br>and these cells with very little ench uh<br>divided very quickly whereas when we uh<br>put in extra enac either the alpha<br>subunit alone or all three subunits we<br>got a significant lowering in the cell<br>division rate so this gave us um some<br>confidence that um enac might be playing<br>a role in breast cancer and we've just<br>recently had our first paper accepted on<br>this work and we now we hope to carry on<br>and as um Professor Highland said you<br>know potentially looking at enac is a a<br>possible um target for for therapeutic<br>intervention<br>all right so that's it for your enac<br>education I have one more slide and<br>that's my acknowledgement slide which<br>yes it's big uh probably doesn't cover<br>everyone who has helped me in this<br>journey but I you know it's your<br>students who drive a lot of this work<br>and there's a lot of students listed<br>here uh they've all contributed<br>enormously to my own um success and I<br>thank them as well as uh many research<br>uh staff who have had in the lab my<br>colleagues and<br>collaborators and people along the way<br>who have<br>helped I'd also like to uh thank my<br>wonderful family I was allowed to put<br>this picture in so this is my husband<br>Graham and real particular thanks to him<br>he shouldered a lot of the child care<br>over um many years and our fabulous<br>children Daniel Laura and Matthew um<br>this is us walking the able test<br>um in January then I I found a paper a<br>picture from the 1980s I think so a<br>younger um version of my parents and my<br>sister clar and and sister<br>Lauren and my nana who yeah would have<br>loved to be here<br>today and I'll also shout out to people<br>online I know um Gram's parents are<br>listening as well finally thank you to<br>all of you for being here and thank you<br>for listening to my<br>story C Professor<br>McDonald thank you for a uh wonderful<br>presentation Koto um my name is Pete<br>Jones and I'm the deputy hod research<br>for the Department of physiology so most<br>of you will know that usually it falls<br>to the hod to give these uh formal<br>thanks but tonight that privilege uh<br>yeah Falls to me I think it was felt<br>that it would probably be a little bit<br>disingenuous if Yona stood here and<br>thanked herself for the uh excellent<br>lecture but I think most people would<br>agree uh and not have complaints about<br>that a personal thanks as well because<br>last night when I told my son uh Rowan I<br>was going to be late he said what was I<br>going to do so I said I was here and I<br>was thanking someone for a uh a good<br>lecture and he so he said well what<br>happens if it isn't a good lecture do<br>you still have to say thank you and I<br>hadn't really crossed my mind but uh I<br>well probably and then you got that look<br>of well um that makes you a liar so<br>thank you for not making me uh a liar<br>tonight<br>um it's also great coming to these<br>because you get to hear the story of<br>people as they progress through their<br>careers not just what they working on<br>now and it was great to see Fiona as the<br>the small girl growing up in rural uh<br>atago I hadn't realized I hadn't caught<br>none but after hearing you see say iron<br>multiple times I now could have<br>recognized the rolling R which I can't<br>do but then also how you progressed to<br>where you are<br>today for those 400 level students out<br>there you might have noticed that Fiona<br>had a publication from her honors degree<br>um those in physiology that is now an<br>expectation um but seriously that's<br>that's an extraordinary achievement and<br>it shows uh just uh where Fiona's<br>research was even at that early age it<br>was also really nice to hear when<br>Fiona's passion for iron channels came<br>about and as another IR Channel a ficado<br>it's great to see someone's excitement<br>and passion for working on this research<br>search um the only comment would be<br>you've almost made enac sound as<br>exciting as calcium channels<br>almost but beyond the science itself and<br>those really fundamental discoveries<br>that Fiona made in understanding enac it<br>was great to see her work in teaching<br>and that came across in the delivery of<br>the lecture as well covering really<br>complex material to in a way that a<br>general audience can understand I think<br>that's also shown by the number of<br>students that were on your last slide<br>how many you've mentored over the years<br>never mind the thousands of students<br>which have come through<br>physiology and lastly I just want to<br>touch on the final kind of aspect of a<br>professor or a well-rounded professor<br>and that's the service of the University<br>Fiona Service as an hld has been<br>exceptional and it's been really great<br>working with her under her it's made<br>life for a lot of us very easy and I<br>think Fiona's also had to work through<br>some of the largest changes and<br>challenges the department has probably<br>experienced in the last several decades<br>most notably with Co 19 last year and I<br>don't think without her leadership the<br>department would be quite where it is<br>now so all that leaves me to do is to<br>ask you to join me in formally thanking<br>Professor McDonald again and to present<br>her with a small token to remember the<br>occasion<br>congratulations<br>Kora<br>ten uh my name is Paul Brunton and I'm<br>the PVC for Health Sciences here at the<br>University<br>ofo I have two duties tonight the first<br>duty is to thank you our audience for<br>coming uh to Fiona's lecture uh these<br>are really special events and they're<br>made very special by the people who take<br>the time to come and join us to<br>celebrate the success of a newly<br>appointed Professor lastly my final Duey<br>is to invite you to join us for some<br>light Refreshments over in the staff<br>Club so thank you once again and before<br>you go I think we should give Fiona<br>applause</p></main><footer
