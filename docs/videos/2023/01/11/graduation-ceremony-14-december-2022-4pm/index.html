front of<br>you a proud almana to give a graduation<br>address in addition to this honor I'm a<br>proud mother of one of The Graduate<br>my journey from the time I graduated<br>with a medical degree in 1993. it's a<br>long time till now<br>it's not what I had expected I had fully<br>expected that I would be my career would<br>be a clinician and hopefully in plastic<br>surgery but in December 1996 I traveled<br>to New Zealand uh from Nepal to meet my<br>husband<br>umet poon who is here with me today who<br>was studying for his PhD at Lincoln<br>University<br>rather than immediately uh pursuing for<br>the clinical experience I was encouraged<br>by my friends to consider studying<br>Public Health as it offered a versatile<br>qualification<br>one of those friends<br>of all those years among was we see<br>Professor Dr David modak uh he was he<br>and his wife Dr Lindley encouraged me to<br>go for this um<br>degree having made the decision and with<br>the strong support of my husband I<br>returned home to Nepal having completed<br>a masters in public health from<br>understanding this further study is<br>public in public health led me led to an<br>unanticipated change in my career plans<br>that I've never regretted what it gave<br>me was Knowledge and Skills that I could<br>combine with my previous clinical<br>experience and apply to a career that<br>I'm very proud of<br>in the 18 years that I've followed my<br>work has focused on maternal and child<br>health<br>this work has been driven by the central<br>conviction that everyone especially<br>mothers and babies should have access to<br>Quality Health Care when they need it<br>sadly for Millions around the world that<br>is not the reality<br>including where I come well have been<br>based in my own country of Nepal and<br>more recently in Sierra Leone<br>in Nepal I was able to play a key role<br>in establishing over 450 birthing<br>centers in the health facilities of the<br>most remotest 15 districts of the<br>country prior to this the pregnant<br>mothers or woman had to walk for hours<br>and days<br>uh to reach the district hospitals for<br>delivery establishing this help post as<br>birthing centers at strategic locations<br>and bringing the service close to them<br>increased access to Quality Health<br>Services<br>this in this intervention significantly<br>significantly increased the<br>institutional delivery from 30 to 60<br>percent and increased and ANC and PNC<br>utilization of Child Health Care Family<br>Planning services and<br>directly or indirectly helped in<br>decreasing the maternal newborn and<br>child mortality in the country<br>similarly in Sierra Leone I was able to<br>support establish<br>16 special care baby units<br>in the tertiary Regional and District<br>hospitals<br>the special care baby units admits about<br>9 000 very sick and small babies with a<br>survival rate of about 82 percent<br>and they also have stories like saving<br>about 900 grams babies and these babies<br>are thriving these days<br>the special care baby unit program has<br>become a flagship program for the<br>government of Sierra Leone and I'm very<br>proud of that<br>in my work<br>uh like it has given me a lot of<br>opportunities to visit the remotest<br>parts of the of Nepal and Sierra Leone<br>to interact with the community members<br>and understand it understand and discuss<br>on the health challenges<br>it has also given me the opportunity to<br>influence National policies that made<br>real difference for their family and
