career<br>um<br>as much as they can prepare or plot it<br>to be in a position where you are now in<br>your careers maybe i start with tanya<br>this time<br>um thank you um<br>i was just reflecting actually on my son<br>saying to me at one point that he wanted<br>to do awards like like i do um<br>but and then i thought about where i<br>started and it was really in some very<br>you know very you know fruit picking<br>type<br>bottle washing kind of role so um<br>you know you don't<br>you don't have to start in something<br>really<br>amazing you just i think<br>find what you're good at<br>um<br>find what you enjoy<br>and what you can earn some money from<br>and you kind of put those things<br>together and find the intersect um and<br>start you know start with with you with<br>what's good for you and you develop your<br>career along those lines um<br>if you can stick to<br>your values and the things that mean are<br>meaningful to you and find a career<br>around that<br>um and and develop up<br>and<br>and governance is also<br>multi-layered so you can start<br>governance really at any age i think<br>there are all kinds of organizations<br>that want people on their boards you can<br>perhaps indicate an interest at a local<br>school<br>and see if you can contribute to be of<br>assistance to a board of trustees you<br>know this there's there are charities<br>that that want help um so<br>you can start really<br>anywhere at any time i believe um but<br>you know in life just find your passion<br>do that and<br>staircase your way from wherever you are<br>to wherever you want to be<br>no<br>thank you for that um teresa your<br>thoughts<br>i couldn't agree more with what tania<br>said<br>i don't think it matters what you do at<br>25 it certainly doesn't matter what you<br>do at 15<br>because what you'll be doing when you're<br>our age doesn't exist at the moment so<br>it is about finding that intersection of<br>what you are good at<br>what you like doing and what the world<br>will pay you for and don't worry if it<br>takes a while for that all to come<br>through and if you're completely lost<br>and you have no idea what that is<br>think about what you like doing when you<br>were seven<br>because chances are what you like doing<br>when you were seven before the world<br>said girls don't do that maori kids<br>don't do that new zealanders don't do<br>that<br>can't do that that is the antithesis of<br>what actually<br>ignites your spirit and soul so<br>um and it's fine to experiment you're<br>going to have more than one career in<br>your working life so i think we're<br>headed for<br>among people my age we talk about living<br>our portfolio life like doing a main<br>thing having a side hustle what i see<br>young people doing is side hustle and<br>side hustle and side hustle job on the<br>side like it's just going to be<br>completely different i think the whole<br>framing up of a career is going to be<br>completely different<br>no no thank you for that um<br>and i definitely fits in the mold of<br>where my children are seeing themselves<br>um it's that they are doing multiple<br>things and multiple tasks and they're<br>all about their passion everything's<br>about what they're passionate about<br>um liz your thoughts on um what you<br>would suggest to somebody who's a lot<br>younger<br>in terms of a career in governance<br>well i would encourage um a 15 year old<br>to to travel to um read listen talk with<br>a variety of people about as many<br>different topics as you can<br>listen to different opinions and<br>outlooks on life cultures backgrounds<br>and build your understanding of the<br>different cultures and how people around<br>the world<br>live their life<br>uh<br>you know it's just so important to um<br>you know just have a facile mind and an<br>understanding of different cultures so<br>and the earlier you can do that the<br>better and the other message i'd say is<br>that um<br>and it's been talked about over the last<br>hour is build and maintain your good<br>connections with people you admire and<br>can learn from<br>you know acknowledge that social media<br>is a time waster that has its place but<br>real connections real people matter<br>people only post on social media what<br>they want you to see and that may have<br>no resemblance with reality so you know<br>work with people talk with people learn<br>from people<br>learn from different cultures open your<br>mind up and the opportunities will come<br>your way<br>thank you for that liz<br>miriam your thoughts<br>look i'm not sure i can add a lot to<br>what's already been said um i guess<br>maybe not so much for the 15 year old<br>maybe it's the 25 year old but i've<br>already alluded to is once you've found<br>your passion been a bit of planning<br>taking risks seizing opportunities and<br>networking although i prefer to call it<br>um making connections but the second one<br>and i think this is really important<br>that teresa touched on is i think it is<br>so important to be authentic to be<br>yourself and i guess i do speak<br>um<br>from<br>experience because for a long time i was<br>the only woman and client meeting was a<br>courtroom a ball table and so being<br>authentic was also about being a woman<br>so i developed a reputation for wearing<br>these incredibly bright suits whether<br>they were bright pink or yellow or<br>whatever i do a scarf these days and it<br>was partly because i did not want to be<br>like the men<br>and i have to say it still surprises me<br>a bit when you go to wellington and you<br>see all the women in dark suits and i<br>think why do you want to look to make a<br>male counterpart<br>and then the third thing is something i<br>do pass on to women in these workshops<br>i'll do and i think they are valid even<br>for the 15 year old and they came from<br>the book by the susan jeffers that some<br>may have read but that really is that<br>feel the fear and do it anyway we all<br>get fearful we just have to go out and<br>do it and then secondly when it does get<br>a bit much or a bit scary whether you're<br>15 25<br>or 55<br>one of the things that she said in her<br>book that always resonates with me is<br>angels can fly because they take<br>themselves lightly<br>i think that's quite nice we all need to<br>lighten up at times particularly in<br>cobra times and dare to say it i've<br>mentioned that word<br>thank you so much for that miriam and<br>finally um patakafia<br>kia ora that was beautiful miriam um<br>always be open to opportunities um<br>also learn<br>any lessons because life will be up it<br>will have its ups and downs<br>um the other thing i would say too is<br>remember who you are and that um it<br>speaks to identity and whakapapa<br>and the last point is that you are<br>enough<br>and i think sometimes we forget about<br>that um<br>is particularly when you're younger i<br>think of my daughters and my nephews and<br>nieces when i'm having conversations<br>no that's wonderful thank you and i<br>think uh another one i'd heard miriam<br>talk about um<br>at a previous time that we had met was<br>take others with you and actually hold<br>them up and allow them to also shine i<br>think it's an absolute critical one as<br>as leaders and it's something that you<br>can do from any age is to take others<br>with you and allow them to shine<br>um</p></main><footer style="margin-top: 2rem; background: #0001; padding: 2rem; text-align:
