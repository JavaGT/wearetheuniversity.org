this<br>environment we're in now<br>and how do we prepare<br>liz can i start with you<br>thank you heather and good afternoon<br>look as a director we are expected to<br>predict the future<br>uh but we don't know what it's going to<br>be like in 15 years time you know it's<br>always hard but what i can tell you is<br>um<br>what we are thinking about when we think<br>about the future<br>i mean<br>we think just what's happened um yeah a<br>global pandemic or a biological event<br>these are all certain extreme<br>circumstances that we have to think<br>about and we have to have discussions<br>about<br>but the other<br>items that we're thinking about is<br>information technology and how will it<br>affect business models and consumer<br>behavior that will bring opportunity for<br>example we think of esport the same<br>sports code that have played online with<br>computer sports players that have<br>coaches train<br>play just as they um<br>as they do in real sport uh with<br>audience watching online or that come to<br>us<br>specially designed sports arena to see<br>esport athletes and actions sitting on a<br>screen<br>and of course if you think of the us the<br>lakers esport they um it brings a<br>different target audience and<br>more revenue than just marketing new<br>merchandisers but on the other side<br>there's risks cyber warfare will just<br>get worse<br>uh the other thing we think about is you<br>know the future of politics are our<br>political systems able to govern in a<br>digital economy<br>uh what will the effects of ships and<br>demographics and global demographic<br>power<br>be<br>you know today we we see that social<br>inclusion it seems to be an unfulfilled<br>promise and so social cohesion is<br>weakening<br>so some citizens are disenchanted and<br>political systems you know<br>they will have trouble adapting and<br>responding to these new demands so and<br>then that brings us on to say well<br>what's our role and purpose of business<br>and society<br>so we think about these things we have<br>the discussion and you know that that<br>will influence what where we are in 15<br>years time<br>oh that's wonderful thank you for that<br>um liz teresa you've come from a variety<br>of backgrounds as well as the corporate<br>world and now with startup so what are<br>your thoughts on where we'll look like<br>in 15 years<br>thanks heather and good evening everyone<br>paul martier<br>look the one thing that won't change is<br>business will continue to be about the<br>intersection of people and money<br>but both of those two things as they<br>apply to governance might well change<br>first of all the people front<br>and we're past the point now where<br>diversity and inclusion isn't nice to do<br>in the real mahi's done<br>it's now core it's a core leadership<br>skill now it'll be even more core in 15<br>years time<br>and so governance the governors if you<br>like are going to be more diverse it's<br>going to be a better gender balance<br>there's going to be a better ethnicity<br>balance reflecting the natural<br>population of r2ro new zealand or<br>definitely heading in that direction<br>but it might be a more fundamental shift<br>than that a more fundamental shift and<br>part enabled by bringing more voices to<br>the table but also by the passion and<br>the focus of the younger generation<br>traditionally money has been seen as a<br>transaction you pay something with money<br>and you get something in return but<br>increasingly i think you know currency<br>currency current energy money is energy<br>and it works best in a circular way<br>actually<br>thinking of the economy as a circular<br>thing and the current esg imperative<br>is only going to increase the focus on<br>all organizations<br>whether they're in the public sector to<br>take an inter-generational focus which<br>is something that indigenous wisdom has<br>been you know known forever<br>and to actually think about<br>particularity<br>right now we think of sustainability as<br>being products that do no harm<br>that's not going to cut it<br>there are already two or three<br>hugely leading entrepreneurial companies<br>in new zealand emma um lewisham<br>cosmetics and<br>skin care and better packaging which are<br>making products out of pollution<br>so they're not just doing a do no harm<br>they're actually going to make the moana<br>the funeral better than how they found<br>it<br>we're going to see more and more of that<br>the circular nature of all being in<br>relationship to each other<br>people but also other sentiment sentient<br>beings and the environment is going to<br>be a profound shift in the next 15 years<br>that sounds absolutely exciting actually<br>well i think as<br>liz already eluded it does feel like<br>crystal ball gazing because it's really<br>hard to predict what's going to happen<br>particularly given how uncertain<br>everything is now and in the future<br>let me focus more just on the governance<br>rather than the business aspect and look<br>i share teresa's view i think what we<br>can expect is there'll be more diversity<br>and it's not just in gender ethnicity<br>it's going to be diversity and thought<br>and skill sets<br>i think the median age of boards will be<br>younger and they need to be i think we<br>need younger people on boards and i<br>think the older lawyers accountants<br>chief executives<br>will be uh leicester ruger in 15 years<br>time and tech skills is probably going<br>to be<br>essential and then i think there'll be a<br>lot more focus on social license one of<br>the things that i've been really struck<br>by and some of the government review<br>work i do is the growing lack of trust<br>in institutions and business so i think<br>there will be more focus on social<br>license um sustainability tia maori<br>um<br>so<br>it is going to be a different world how<br>different is hard to say i think what's<br>perhaps more important is how do we<br>prepare and i guess i think it's about<br>continuing to be curious um to grow our<br>skill sets<br>and to actually be really resilient<br>agile able to adapt quickly<br>thank you for that um<br>and i suppose we're getting a bit of a<br>uh<br>thank you for the question and i i guess<br>i'm going to echo a lot of what others<br>have already said but i<br>i expect that we are continuing our<br>trend to become a more aware<br>more mature ethically treaty-based<br>nation<br>and expanding our knowledge and that<br>that<br>involves our relationships and our<br>partnerships and our<br>tolerance and understanding<br>and broadens our<br>our outlooks and our<br>horizons we still<br>will need to keep well abreast of the<br>fast pace of technology and trends<br>while also<br>being well grounded in the fundamentals<br>around our environment and the<br>sustainability of our of our world<br>so i expect to see more diverse but<br>integrated approaches to governance<br>continuing to develop when i say<br>integrated approaches i mean<br>the coalescing of social and<br>environmental and cultural and business<br>priorities<br>rather than them being you know<br>separate or<br>or one dominating the other i think<br>we'll come up with a much more<br>integrated approach<br>we'll still of course have our<br>increasing focus on compliance and<br>safety and regulations and so it will<br>continue to be a serious<br>maybe an even more<br>serious business being a governor in 15<br>years time<br>but but i think if we're thinking about<br>15 years ahead we have to look at the<br>youth of today and what they're dealing<br>with and so they will be influenced by<br>this pandemic they will be influenced by<br>climate change<br>and they will<br>they will use those inspirations to<br>transform our world into entertainment<br>to transform business so<br>um i mean i think it's really good we're<br>heading in good directions and i i i<br>look forward to that that'll be a time<br>when i'm<br>sunsetting out of it but there'll be<br>some really<br>you want to thank you for that<br>and finally patakafia<br>i mean a lot has already been said so<br>i'm trying to think of uh something<br>different so what i did do however was i<br>posed this question of my um<br>21 22 year old who's in her final year<br>of law at waikato university<br>and is really starting out on her career<br>um<br>and a couple of things she did say to me<br>slightly different to what's been shared<br>so far she talked a lot about values<br>she talked a lot about um obviously<br>people but because also<br>the<br>the her discussion also lent on<br>mental well-being and the well-being of<br>her generation now and how much more<br>that has come and become more visible<br>and um she certainly wasn't didn't see<br>herself necessarily going into a<br>governance role in the future but she<br>did say to me mum i don't think i want<br>to be doing or<br>or doing what you do in the way that you<br>do it and i do believe that me and my<br>peers are wanting to do things<br>differently so as tanya touched on that<br>kind of license<br>climate change is really important to<br>them and so i think you will start<br>seeing a lot more of that coming through<br>and into the leadership roles i think as<br>leaders we should be embracing that<br>diversity we need to embrace it now and<br>i know all of us on this<br>live stream do don't do that and we<br>talked about it<br>but i think we need to obviously be much<br>more deliberate about it too and bring<br>forward<br>and identify those leaders of the future<br>um because now is the time<br>to<br>support them and start to shape<br>how they will be when they step into<br>some of the roles that we all have<br>currently so<br>nothing more to add except to say it's<br>wonderful to be on this panel with<br>with you all</p></main><footer style="margin-top: 2rem; background: #0001; padding: 2rem;
