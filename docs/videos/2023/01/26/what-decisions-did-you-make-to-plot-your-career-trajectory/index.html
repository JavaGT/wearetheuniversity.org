trajectory<br>to get to where you've got to in your<br>well that's actually two different<br>questions<br>so um i decided when i was doing a<br>management degree at the at waikato that<br>i wanted to be a ceo of a large company<br>in new zealand<br>and i<br>just basically held that<br>i held that intention very tightly<br>i really saw myself in that role<br>and then i took i found your officers as<br>they came up i didn't plot it out you<br>can't plot it out you can't know when<br>your boss is going to decide they want<br>to do something else and the opportunity<br>might come up in my case i crashed my<br>car once<br>and that the guy who helped me that led<br>to me getting my next job you know life<br>is way more random than we'd like to<br>think<br>a career only looks like a now when you<br>look back when you're in it it feels<br>like a verb just we're careering around<br>so it's true that i was intentional<br>about becoming a ceo but i didn't really<br>plot it out any more than that i refused<br>to be blocked so if i felt<br>in my day there was more overt sexes and<br>there mirrors now if i felt blocked i<br>never thought i'd be the only woman to<br>deal with it i've moved to an<br>organization that i felt<br>had more perspective and felt newer and<br>fresher so i did that<br>but once i became a ceo i'd and then<br>beyond that i didn't plan i'm not a good<br>example of how you go from being an<br>executive director<br>um i became an entrepreneur first<br>actually and uh<br>director in a not-for-profit the spca<br>became chair of that<br>and so i became a board director<br>sort of later in a way and as only as<br>part of a portfolio for me it's<br>i don't want to do that full-time i've<br>never wanted to do that but i like<br>i've always been very curious i like<br>having fingers in many pies so<br>i just finished cheering a large<br>australian board for 12 years and it's<br>fascinating to get outside new zealand<br>too and then think about how that<br>reflects back on new zealand and you<br>know to be part of the wider world so<br>i'm not the best person to ask about<br>that but in general i think that<br>you should network you should avail<br>yourself of all the opportunities<br>um through whatever organization um you<br>know global woman for example institute<br>of directors<br>you should<br>accept that it can take time<br>uh and<br>it ever it's all learning i definitely<br>think when you're young it doesn't<br>matter what you do<br>you learn and then you'll be able to use<br>that later<br>uh so i'm not the i'm probably not the<br>best person to ask this question but i<br>think it's important to start out with<br>an intention about something that really<br>you you love to do it's important to<br>because that authenticity really shines<br>through<br>no<br>i completely agree with that<br>authenticity and actually<br>following following something that you<br>are passionate about and that you've got<br>a real drive and curiosity and<br>miriam<br>your um your thoughts on your career<br>trajectory<br>well i'm probably not a very good<br>candidate for this question i<br>like therese<br>i did virtually no planning<br>i only went to auckland law school<br>because in fact it was a wonderful<br>waikato history professor who at the end<br>of a history degree said to me what are<br>you going to do i said i have no idea<br>she said i think you'd be good at law so<br>i went to law school<br>i stumbled into corporate governance<br>because i was on an electricity review<br>panel the ministry of commerce was<br>supporting it they were looking for<br>candidates for a new start-up company<br>chrome fibre to roll out ultrafars<br>broadband they wanted a woman they<br>wanted a lawyer i killed two birds with<br>one stone<br>and other roles followed and because<br>review works an important part of my<br>career did i plan that no somebody<br>approached me to do a review<br>and one led to another<br>i guess it's partly because i did so<br>little planning for my career that one<br>of the things i'm really passionate<br>about is helping young women in<br>particular and planning their careers<br>and i run a workshop for young women<br>exactly on that so i guess<br>i use my own example<br>as to how i didn't plan my career to<br>really get them to think about planning<br>so<br>you know my three mantras with them<br>really are plan you know what is your<br>vision where do you want to be in five<br>years where do you want to be in 10<br>years how are you going to get there who<br>will help you therese is absolutely<br>right networking i've learned is not<br>those dreadful cocktail functions i used<br>to go to at russell mcveigh and hated<br>them but it's actually going out<br>networking having coffees with people<br>but i also say divert deviate from the<br>plan when you need to because there's no<br>right or wrong path so i echo teresa's<br>thoughts<br>that too much planning can actually be<br>counterproductive<br>and then the one that i really emphasize<br>that i learned was yet you've got to<br>take risk i learned that if you don't<br>take risks you don't get opportunities<br>so as scary as it might be<br>it is really important to take on roles<br>to take opportunities when they come and<br>i was at least good at doing that<br>and learn that it is good to be in that<br>space that i call you don't know what<br>you don't know it's scary but it's<br>actually the best space to be<br>so<br>i've learned from my experience to try<br>and pass on it is really good to do some<br>planning</p></main><footer style="margin-top: 2rem; background: #0001; padding: 2rem; text-align: center;"><p>We Are The University</p><ul style="list-style-type: none; padding: 0;
