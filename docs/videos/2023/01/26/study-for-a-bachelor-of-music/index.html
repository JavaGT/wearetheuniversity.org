Is the best part  <br>and especially this type of music, <br>you've got to listen to each other.<br>So you really get to know the tutors very  <br>well. They've all had amazing careers <br>and learnt so much from their time overseas.<br>The lecturers don't treat you like students, <br>they treat you as equal. It's quite amazing  <br>how inclusive it is. I'm studying Bachelor of <br>Laws and a Bachelor of Arts majoring in music.  <br>I don't know how I would be able to, like, <br>really indulge in the whole world of music  <br>if I wasn't living in a very creative city <br>like this. Like you're meeting the people  <br>at applying the music you love is a lot of <br>opportunity just through the tutors to get<br>gig work getting that networking system,  <br>learning how to develop yourself <br>as a professional musician.<br>I want to be looking at film composition because <br>I love storytelling through my music. I feel that  <br>I'm the creator of my own future and all <br>I need is the right support and mentorship  <br>around me to be able to do that. If you have <br>that and you have the drive and the passion,  <br>it can take you a lot of places. One day I <br>will stand on the world stage with the best.</p></main><footer style="margin-top: 2rem; background: #0001; padding: 2rem; text-align: center;"><p>We Are The University</p><ul style="list-style-type: none; padding: 0; margin: 0;"><li><a href="/">Home</a></li><li><a href="/about">About</a></li><li><a href="/contact">Contact</a></li></ul></footer></body></html>
