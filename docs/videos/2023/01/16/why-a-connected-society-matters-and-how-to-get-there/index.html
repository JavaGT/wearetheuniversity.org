why I connected<br>Society matters and how to get there<br>so let's think about first of all how we<br>Define connected Society<br>and for the purposes of this discussion<br>I'll offer a definition of a community<br>where we all have strong social<br>relationships we're friends family and<br>communities support each other<br>especially at vulnerable points<br>and I think that gives us the lead-in to<br>why this matters and why we need a<br>connected Society for two reasons really<br>social connections are a fundamental<br>psychological need that we all share we<br>all need to feel part of a group close<br>to others<br>but also we need people on a practical<br>level<br>um I think the the recent pandemic<br>showed us what happens when people don't<br>have others to rely on other people to<br>do the grocery shopping or just check in<br>and lend a helping hand<br>so what we'll be discussing today is how<br>a connected Society applies to youth as<br>well as older people<br>what helps and hinders in the<br>technological space<br>and how various cultures understand<br>connected society and what it means to<br>them as well as a whole lot of other<br>things<br>but to kick us off let's talk about what<br>does a connected Society look like to<br>you and your in your world or in your<br>role<br>so Craig get me throughout to you first<br>good afternoon everyone so yeah I I<br>better think about this and I think um I<br>think first of all what we need is<br>um<br>we need people to be able to be<br>vulnerable before you can be connected<br>so in in any in any organization in<br>order to be connected you need to be<br>able to communicate well you need to be<br>able to trust each other but I think you<br>need to be able to have that sense of<br>vulnerability so that people do that in<br>a good way and and that helps build that<br>connection side of things I think the<br>other thing is you need knowledge about<br>people or your organization so and the<br>more understanding you have of how<br>others work<br>um whether for me that's my students my<br>staff or my parents<br>um the more knowledge I have about those<br>people uh the better we can communicate<br>effectively<br>thanks Craig Holly how do you see it<br>uh and thank you for the opportunity to<br>be here<br>um yeah I work in the community and<br>social service sector and Community<br>connectivity is<br>um you know it's our bread and butter<br>it's um what we want to see in order to<br>build robust<br>um thriving communities<br>and I think from our perspective<br>um what really underpins opportunities<br>to grow connectivity is um trust you<br>know it's it's having an openness and a<br>curiosity about others<br>um it's about understanding that your<br>connections I think to other people go<br>beyond friends and family and it's<br>understanding how we're connected to<br>um people we work alongside people we we<br>drive<br>um you know to work the people who are<br>around us who are also driving at the<br>same time it's the people we bump into<br>in shops you know it's understanding<br>that we are far more<br>interrelated with all the people around<br>us and we actually have<br>um both in in obligation<br>um to some degree to those sort of those<br>other people<br>um yeah but also it's an opportunity<br>it's an opportunity to grow ourselves<br>yeah<br>thanks Holly I'm particularly interested<br>in that idea which maybe we'll explore a<br>bit later about how we how both sides<br>benefit and grow from from connections<br>that we make Carol how does it how does<br>a connected Society<br>frame up to you and your world<br>well um as a social scientist and I<br>specialize in social and political<br>gerontology I while I<br>um uh connect with the points that have<br>been made<br>um I do feel we've got to start at a<br>beginning place where we see<br>participatory democracy as as a<br>foundational point of everybody having a<br>view shaft and shaping our world<br>um so I want to take that kind of focus<br>um today given our uncertainty in post<br>covert and learning from research that I<br>did with Elders at that time in France<br>and Europe they call it solidarity and<br>and an iot Row in New Zealand the<br>treasury uh well-being living standards<br>framework refers to social cohesion<br>amongst another range of factors<br>um and and I propose within that view<br>really I just want to give heads up at<br>this point<br>um a repositioning of Elders in our<br>society<br>and a real strength to the<br>Carol really interesting let's come back<br>to that that intergenerational point as<br>well but Charlene talk to us about what<br>um I've really liked what I'm hearing so<br>far in um a connected Society for me I<br>think of um of tribes and subsets of<br>tribes so um you know in my Pacifica<br>spaces that I that I um am involved in<br>as a Pacifica person and<br>um and through Pacifica communities you<br>know you've got your subsets so your<br>whanau's your first and then you've got<br>your church groups and then you know for<br>me um teams and sporting groups are<br>really important and um Holly your idea<br>of the interrelated interconnectedness<br>really resonates in in those spaces too<br>and I kind of pull it a step back and<br>think of about people knowing themselves<br>and their own identity and their<br>whakapapa first and foremost so that<br>they can better contribute and be a<br>positive member of those<br>um communities and of those tribes so to<br>speak all those sub-tribes and subsets<br>of communities so<br>I'll pause there because I could go on<br>Charlene I'm really interested in this<br>idea that we need to ground ourselves in<br>our own belonging our own whakapapa<br>before we reach out to others<br>uh which I think is really interesting<br>let me come back to you and Craig who've<br>both had a lot of experience working<br>with young people in rangatahi<br>what do you think how do you think youth<br>today create relationships that give<br>them the confidence to be both givers<br>and takers in in a connected Society<br>Craig<br>yeah awesome thank you<br>um and I think some really good points<br>and some different uh views here which<br>is fantastic so<br>um for me uh being uh Deputy Headmaster<br>at a school and a boarding school<br>um the key thing that we kind of work on<br>is is the relationship so you know often<br>people talk about that being the<br>absolute key but um for me<br>kind of picked that back two points<br>further and just come back to the the<br>thing that I think that gives people<br>confidence and and people<br>um and this isn't person in particular<br>that I'm trying to focus on rather than<br>so much the technology because I think<br>that the person should always come first<br>and the technology part second<br>is um the trust then so the trust that<br>you create with your your students your<br>Arcana your families<br>um that helps to build the relationships<br>um and then I think the one thing we try<br>to work on really<br>um you know in a big way here is again<br>that sense of vulnerability so the<br>sharing of stories about where you've<br>come what you've experienced so that the<br>people in front of you know who you are<br>Charlene how has that<br>um how does that resonate with your own<br>experience of working with young people<br>in secondary schools but also uh from<br>Ahmadi and Pacifica point of view<br>does that do young people in those<br>cultures how are they similar and<br>different I<br>absolutely agree with um people first<br>because we need our Toyota to come in to<br>a space where they feel safe you know<br>that's first and foremost for me if they<br>don't feel safe then no learning is<br>going to happen and<br>um and that for that for that young<br>person it could be in a certain some<br>some classes they feel safe and they<br>feel welcomed we we need our youth<br>feeling<br>um like they belong to that space and<br>they're valued in that space and so the<br>challenge for educators as to how do we<br>how do we um create that safe<br>environment how do we ensure that<br>there's connection or umatanga what does<br>that look like in in a classroom so<br>that's really vital um<br>and whilst you know we know our kids<br>spend a lot of time at school so we<br>really need they need to see role models<br>they need to see it happening um from<br>their kayak or from the the leaders the<br>tumawaki from their um from other<br>students as well so they need to see um<br>what you know being a good a good<br>Community member looks like and and<br>schools have their own culture and they<br>have their own way of being and so these<br>are kind of like the unwritten rules of<br>schools if you like and and kids learn<br>that so they there's so much learning<br>that happens at school obviously there's<br>a lot of really important<br>um academic learning but then there's<br>all these other lessons and life lessons<br>that are learned in in the school space<br>don't answer that I just felt like you<br>know have that off but absolutely safe<br>being feeling safe in its sense of<br>um belonging and being valued as first<br>and foremost<br>yeah thanks Charlene I'm really<br>interested in this idea of a safe space<br>and I'm wondering how that idea<br>um<br>transfers intergenerationally so Carol<br>if we think about older people what does<br>a safe space mean for them so that they<br>can feel they belong in society<br>um I've I've had a lot of experience in<br>the policy frame with Urban Development<br>and<br>it just goes on and on planning for an<br>um aging Society the impact of<br>population aging means that we need to<br>have strong communities there's just no<br>doubt about that and there's been those<br>phrases like Aging in place and I've<br>added to that Aging in place in<br>community please<br>um because we've got<br>um a growing culture in New Zealand<br>where it's accepted to separate Elders<br>out into radical reservations and that's<br>gotten that's the alienation that isn't<br>tried you know it is a tribe at all it's<br>creating another tribe alien from<br>everybody else and it misses our<br>opportunity for wisdom and sharing and<br>caring and all those things that<br>strengthen communities by the gifts of<br>everybody<br>so um I'm really interested today in<br>making those social connections through<br>what is called now in an urban<br>environment uh setting hyper local<br>communities<br>there's been a lot of talk about<br>15-minute amenity connection and often<br>quoted as<br>um it's called the 15-minute Melbourne<br>model<br>and it means that everybody connects us<br>so it's very sustainability<br>um focused uh planning frame where<br>people can access their own<br>amenities<br>by whichever mode not necessarily a car<br>but it can be by bus and whatever modal<br>modal opportunities but it also enables<br>that people connection so that we're<br>actually building people care and<br>sharing and communities and so should<br>like children Elders should be able to<br>feel safe in that environment because<br>people do know them and do care<br>so the connection we've made into<br>generation is is very real<br>thanks Carol and<br>I certainly understand that the kind of<br>happy cities concept which I think the<br>the 15 minute is is based on<br>um I'm wondering how we see because<br>sadly not all of our communities are<br>like that<br>um many times Elders are segregated off<br>if you like and uh the car is the<br>primary means of Transport which means<br>we're all further away from each other<br>how do you think the younger people<br>so so take teenagers can connect with<br>older people and in those kind of<br>societies so Holly and your work in<br>communities have you seen ways where the<br>connection between young people and<br>older people can happen and some of the<br>wisdom that Carol talks about can be<br>transferred to some of the needs of<br>young people that Craig and Charlene<br>have spoken about<br>I mean there are quite formal Social<br>Service organizations that facilitate<br>um that where you know even through age<br>concern but through<br>um grandparents supporting grandparents<br>like they're they're<br>um Big Brother Big Sister programs like<br>there are a lot of formal programs that<br>that work to facilitate<br>um some of those relationships between<br>older people and younger people and<br>there's also<br>um programs with younger people going<br>into some of those um we'll call them<br>facilities you know<br>um like you know uh where where older<br>people are living<br>so that happens but I think um what we<br>need to be concerned about is how we<br>organically facilitate those<br>relationships in a day-to-day level and<br>I get concerned sometimes when I look at<br>um the development that we're seeing in<br>communities like the ones that I've<br>often lived in um they've been lower<br>income communities<br>um I was in beta for example for about<br>10 years I used to run the community<br>house there what's wonderful about that<br>Community is there are a lot of<br>intergenerational families so those<br>connections still really exist across<br>the community that's fantastic but what<br>we're seeing is a lot of infill housing<br>going and I'm sure Carol you'll have um<br>a lot more knowledge about this than me<br>but what concerns me with the infill is<br>it's um it's driven by development often<br>rather than a community perspective<br>about how we ensure there are still<br>bumping spaces in communities and places<br>um don't become disconnected if you look<br>at<br>um and I suppose people who know<br>Hamilton might understand this the BT<br>kind of Jones Crescent area<br>um it is full of in full housing there<br>are two arterial roots on either side of<br>it um there's no way to kind of easily<br>cross<br>um<br>yeah and and that's what concerns me<br>when we're looking at Urban Development<br>to make sure we retain um Community<br>connectivity to make sure we retain<br>opportunities for people to meet each<br>other to congregate to you know um to be<br>a part of a community we need to protect<br>those spaces and we need to think about<br>that when we are developing or<br>redeveloping areas and I think this<br>opportunity in the in that that point<br>that you're making to<br>um to be regenerative in our communities<br>and I'm in love with the whole idea of<br>neighborhoods creating parklets yeah you<br>know if we just as an idea if the<br>council costaken by trees easily if they<br>gave five trees to a little neighborhood<br>and people got together and said where<br>whereabouts could we plant five trees<br>and they would do things together either<br>create bonds greenness greedy patch fall<br>in love with your own place you know so<br>many<br>um outcomes can come from Little actions<br>but the bumping spaces that you<br>mentioned Holly I think are really vital<br>and that's why the whole notion of<br>hyperlocal communities where people<br>actually do go for their very Basics to<br>to a local space means the enhancement<br>of those public spaces within that that<br>zone means that people<br>um connect both<br>um deliberately and and spontaneously<br>which creates fun<br>yes<br>yeah that's really interesting looking<br>at it a more positive<br>um<br>viewpoint on the current<br>housing price crisis for example do we<br>all know housing is very expensive<br>harder for people to get into their<br>first homes do you think though that a<br>positive benefit for that might be that<br>we'll see more intergenerational living<br>where different Generations live<br>together and what do you think that will<br>do to<br>the idea is good and many families have<br>been able to contain and maintain that<br>um and Minnie Maori and Pacifica<br>families struggle to keep that alive<br>but we've got to have and hopefully win<br>the RMA changes are all start to get<br>embedded<br>um we'll have more flexibility so that<br>people can expand existing homes and<br>rebuild them so that collections of<br>people whoever they are and whatever<br>ages<br>um can live together and have shared<br>property in a much easier way than than<br>we currently have where we've got a<br>culture that says we have to fit into<br>the rules of little boxes<br>but you know with an aging Society<br>um we just can't possibly care for all<br>those who are going to have needs for<br>support<br>um with few more older people than young<br>people it all just doesn't add up so<br>we've got to do better at caring for<br>each other and that means the structural<br>aspect of communities need for change<br>right<br>so Craig and Charlene I know you've both<br>worked in secondary schools which have<br>boarding facilities and I wonder if you<br>have a view about what a connected<br>society means in that space and what<br>lessons young people learn from boarding<br>and how they take those back uh and and<br>into the rest of their lives for both<br>positively and and perhaps not so<br>positively<br>Craig<br>Charlene if you go first maybe because<br>the drilling is just going on above me<br>not a problem<br>uh<br>I'll stick to the positive<br>um<br>a positive overview because I I know<br>that the girls because um you know<br>obviously we<br>our our<br>um our hostile girls are distributed<br>quite evenly throughout so there's<br>usually like two or three and and like a<br>year nine class for instance so that um<br>so there's that little Bond there that's<br>always nice for them but I know that<br>especially for the year nines it's very<br>um it's quite scary for them at first<br>and<br>and they're huge lessons though because<br>you know by a month then you wouldn't<br>even know that<br>you know that they had all these massive<br>challenges because it's a huge challenge<br>one um sometimes I'm moving to a big<br>city and two they've moving from a<br>really tiny school sometimes to a huge<br>you know Hamilton girls high school 1700<br>girls here so there is a lot of change<br>for a young person to be processing and<br>working through so um I just take it<br>back to kids are so resilient you know a<br>lot of kids are really resilient and<br>Affairs at support there I know that<br>there are um it's very structured and<br>there are a lot of rules and there needs<br>to be to keep those kids safe and so<br>they know what's what really and who I<br>need to go to for XYZ so those rules and<br>boundaries are kept there for their<br>safety and so that they can thrive in<br>that space<br>um and so I'll just stick to the year<br>nines because other newbies that come in<br>and<br>and in class you can see that there are<br>bonds and the ones who um who get<br>through that first few weeks couple<br>weeks that's something you're usually<br>the hardest they really Thrive and<br>they're really embedded deep in the<br>school culture the boarding culture the<br>school culture they're often involved<br>with extracurricular activities as well<br>when I think for young people that's<br>really important<br>um whatever that may be whether it be<br>sport music<br>um drama you know what it whatever their<br>Jammers that's really important but I I<br>do say I see a hostile girls Thrive<br>um thrive in that space their resilience<br>they have this resilience about them<br>they problem solve so all these soft<br>skills where I'd like to call them life<br>skills actually seem to develop quite<br>quickly for some of them<br>and then there's the you know and and<br>for some kids it's just not it's<br>it's not the gem so it doesn't for all<br>kids and it's a little bit like that for<br>schools you know you need to ensure you<br>are you choosing your selecting<br>um the right skill for your child when<br>you are in that phase of of and they<br>have big decisions to make moving you<br>know from primary to intermediate if<br>there's a change and then from<br>intermediate into um high school because<br>it is a lot of time and a lot of years<br>and those schools so those are really<br>important decisions<br>thanks Charlene<br>Craig awesome yeah it's stopped<br>um now I have to agree with what<br>Charlene said here I think just probably<br>a couple of points that I'd add is I<br>think boarding definitely builds<br>resilience but it also builds patience<br>with people<br>um and I think again I refer back to the<br>real so we do try to limit our times<br>technology use around certain things so<br>that that real connection can happen<br>um and I think the more that that real<br>connection happens the stronger the<br>bonds<br>um you know and the more Pride you have<br>in particular with us where we've got<br>this there's various boarding houses<br>that are the students are aligned to and<br>um you know they're their pride then<br>Carries On Through To uh you know the<br>start of this year I was invited to a<br>wedding where the wedding had four<br>groomsmen and the four groomsmen were<br>all from the same boarding house which<br>is pretty bizarre<br>um fortunately the bli the bride was not<br>from St Paul's<br>um which was a good thing<br>um but go back to what Charlene was<br>talking about there<br>um you know that that building of<br>resilience Etc but again a lot of that<br>is done in the in the flesh it's done<br>the face to face<br>um yeah you have to um in there in the<br>good times when they're in the bad times<br>the tough times and um yeah I think um<br>that resilience and patience is key<br>thanks Craig and Charlene I'm I'm<br>interested then to to move on to this<br>idea of Technology because technology<br>gets a bad rap in terms of it's often<br>talked about uh that it doesn't really<br>connect us that it disconnects us and<br>certainly uh that's sometimes the case<br>but I wonder what's the case for<br>technology in terms of aiding a<br>connected Society<br>do you have a view on that Holly<br>yeah I I do<br>um I actually think you know we see<br>people in our communities who experience<br>social phobia people who are um some<br>people who are newer typical who who<br>actually find<br>um these ways of communicating<br>um easier than connecting initially face<br>to face so in terms of potentially<br>establishing relationships it can be a<br>Gateway that wasn't really open<br>um prior to the sort of breadth and<br>spread of Technology the way that we<br>have it now and the types of platforms<br>we have now you know being able to<br>interact with people like this across<br>the screen<br>um you know it's a fantastic opportunity<br>to stay connected um my my brother lives<br>in Hong Kong for example<br>um you know if this was 30 years ago we<br>probably wouldn't have spoken for I<br>don't know how long whereas we can<br>maintain relationships in such a unique<br>way now I know grandparents who connect<br>with their grandkids or all over the<br>world so being able to leverage and<br>maximize the use of technology I think<br>is fantastic we provide services as an<br>organization Community<br>across the whole region and this is<br>given in some ways more of an equity of<br>connectivity across the region we answer<br>Hamilton Centric we can actually be be<br>far more connected with alfano out in<br>tomaranui or port waikato and places<br>like that so I absolutely see technology<br>is<br>um is a part of<br>um as a part of the it has a place I<br>suppose in connectivity<br>um and and maintaining um relationships<br>and for some people facilitating those<br>relationships it can be a little bit<br>more<br>um comfortable for some so I think it<br>absolutely has a place I don't think<br>there's I mean from my perspective I'm a<br>social person and so for me there's<br>nothing quite like sitting face to face<br>with a person<br>um like in the real is as you say Craig<br>um but for others absolutely this is<br>this is a gateway that wasn't open<br>previously and I think that's certainly<br>something to be celebrated<br>right totally I I love that point about<br>um delivering more equity and connection<br>it can be an equalizer how do you see it<br>Carol in a in a policy thing I guess in<br>the age space yes well in the age space<br>people tend to kind of put two two<br>um positions on it but I like Holly's<br>point about<br>um that she's made about<br>um the potential to connect and and to<br>be able to do it easily and it's<br>Equitable and all of those things and it<br>is quite Equitable for elders to stay in<br>touch with with family and friends and<br>um there's there's a a lot of stuff in<br>terms of equity in regard to Elders<br>being alienated because they don't have<br>the skills that's a diminishing area and<br>we all need to take care of those who<br>haven't had the opportunity to gain the<br>skills or have the update dated<br>equipment often people don't know that<br>they need to update stuff<br>and<br>um and learn bits you know it's a<br>constant learning process and that's one<br>of the things that I think is is<br>wonderful so I'm a lifelong learning fan<br>and<br>um and so I just love the whole area of<br>technology and it's<br>um<br>um great potential for betterment in the<br>world I know there's the sad side but I<br>want to hold on to the fact that human<br>human beings will do the good and that<br>the good aspects of that bring us all<br>together on the planet for the great<br>important so<br>um I'm a great follower of the world<br>economic forums Innovation various<br>platforms<br>um and future thinking and and so I do<br>see a lot of opportunity<br>um and especially for learning you know<br>I would think it was a hard day if I<br>hadn't learned something I think it was<br>a sad day if I learned something and so<br>we can all encourage people to have that<br>Joy that can come from<br>um connecting in not just with with the<br>with the people that have closed and<br>friends with but with a wider world and<br>so that that idea of Technology<br>facilitating connection almost near and<br>far I think's a very powerful one often<br>when we talk about technology we narrow<br>it down to social media and and that<br>certainly had a bad rap Charlene from<br>your perspective with young people<br>what's what's good and not so good about<br>the use of social media<br>hmm well we've heard about<br>um what's great about technology and it<br>has transformed the way we communicate<br>in terms of social media for young<br>people<br>um some young people actually are<br>responsible and they use it how it's<br>designed to use to to to connect and<br>um and to and some of them make their<br>own communities online or with whatever<br>interests or whatever passion so I see<br>it used really well unfortunately there<br>are um you know I in particularly with<br>our younger<br>uh our I'm thinking Secondary School our<br>Juniors for instance who haven't had<br>good role models who don't understand<br>the etiquette of<br>um of social you know being on Facebook<br>of of any social networking<br>and and abuse that have you have used it<br>in ways that um<br>that are detrimental when and can be<br>seen as bullying and harassing so um I<br>suppose that's a negative side and and<br>it's usually just a small percentage and<br>again it's about educating and ensuring<br>that there's role modeling um and I know<br>Craig's going to talk about<br>um uh the phones at um St Paul's girls<br>high a few years ago they um removed<br>phones for year nines and ten so just to<br>Juniors so what we found is that it was<br>the<br>if there were issues with<br>um<br>macios of Technology it was often our<br>Juniors and so<br>um we thought we would try it out this<br>about three years ago so um year nines<br>and tens it's still in place now we're<br>not allowed to have phones that they<br>shouldn't have been seen heard or used<br>um whilst at school and so that that's<br>actually had some really positive<br>outcomes<br>is that how you see it Craig that that<br>at some ages and stages we're better to<br>remove the Temptation at least for a<br>portion of the day and encourage and<br>educate children to use social media for<br>all the good that it has<br>yeah 100 and agree with what Holly<br>talked about earlier with the the<br>differences you know like you look like<br>a neurotypical type type child and it's<br>brilliant for for the Airmen to get gain<br>confidence I think I rewind back to the<br>uh the blue Nokia and the yellow one<br>touch easy<br>and the fact that when I<br>um first was exposed to that I only had<br>20 ticks per month<br>um I couldn't send a photo<br>I only had 10 minutes to call and I<br>treasured that<br>um you know it's like the old film<br>camera I I really treasured the photos<br>when I was at University and I I took<br>those because I couldn't just click away<br>and so I think that probably links into<br>a bit of what the possible problem or<br>the elephant is and it's the it's the<br>instant nature that technology or the<br>the phone in particular is created<br>um on average I think the number is<br>about 42 hours per week that a teenager<br>of about the age of 15 will spend on any<br>device<br>um I didn't have a laptop at school and<br>I didn't have a phone and it's all<br>um year 13 or Sim form and so what did I<br>do with that other 42 hours<br>um I connected face to face<br>um I couldn't connect as much with my my<br>family that lives overseas and those<br>sorts of things but what I did do is I<br>wrote letters and um and I sent<br>postcards and I sent photos so I think<br>it's it's different I think it's got its<br>massive bonuses for me it's just how do<br>we stop the person that sends me the<br>email or the text and I don't reply<br>within 12 hours and then I get a very<br>grumpy one back<br>um yeah I think then that also links to<br>the social media sides of things when<br>people see stuff that is the perfect<br>world and they want to be that and they<br>compare themselves that's probably the<br>the negative side but then the positive<br>side it's a brilliant communication tool<br>keeps parents informed aunties uncles<br>nephews grandmas grandpas they can all<br>see things it's it's fantastic<br>um how do we limit<br>um we can do it in a school context it<br>would be brilliant to see groups like<br>spark and Vodafone maybe do that for our<br>our youth while they're while their<br>brain's still developing and they they<br>find it hard they can't make that<br>decision<br>um you know even us as young adults<br>struggle with that so<br>yeah<br>all middle age people sometimes struggle<br>with that too 100 yeah yeah<br>I must say I'm quite pleased I never had<br>um access to social media as a teenager<br>because there's certainly you know the<br>life out on display and there are<br>probably some things that people will<br>regret posting many years down the track<br>and it's one of the challenges isn't it<br>for for young people in terms of well<br>for any of us I suppose when we've got<br>access to these sort of things now that<br>leave that digital footprint<br>um fodder for the anthropologists in 100<br>years time<br>Craig it makes me oh sorry oh go go<br>Carol thank you I'd like to comment that<br>you know another positive point of<br>Technology<br>um and it's part of connection and part<br>of communication and that's<br>um the immense role that technology is<br>already playing in healthcare<br>and Telecare and um and so on but but<br>um it's just accelerated globally since<br>covert and and it's amazing field that's<br>going to be very helpful<br>um in the future that<br>um it will transform people's lives<br>really<br>Carol I agree um my son I just did a we<br>did a phone consult for him he was at<br>homesick and so that was this I thought<br>it was a phone consult with the doctor<br>and then I popped down and got the um<br>got his medicine yeah um Craig what I<br>was going to mention is you know you<br>talking about letter writing I just<br>thought when was the last time I<br>actually sat down to write a letter and<br>I used to write them all the time and<br>then as an the educator in me thinks<br>about you know um the current state of<br>our literacy and numeracy across the<br>country and so has technology had an<br>impact on<br>um you know on our on our levels of of<br>literacy numeracy so you just I don't<br>know the answer to it no one does or we<br>wouldn't be in this position we are but<br>definitely um food for thought<br>thanks Charlie I want to talk about just<br>follow on the the conversation about<br>social media and Technology to to go<br>into one of the big enemies I guess of a<br>connected society and that's loneliness<br>which sometimes people talk about the<br>epidemic of loneliness<br>and on the one hand technology connects<br>us so it should help with loneliness but<br>I'm interested in your views about<br>whether<br>the kind of pseudo connection sometimes<br>that technology offers we've got lots of<br>friends on Facebook we get instant likes<br>back but does that uh does that actually<br>make us more lonely if we haven't got<br>those real life connections to this to<br>the extent that we we perhaps want to<br>have I would suggest that um we do that<br>in the real world to some extent as well<br>you know people can have relationships<br>with others that are not necessarily<br>deep or maybe they're not sharing their<br>true selves and you know I think that<br>this is it's quite normal<br>um<br>and I don't think it's it's um the<br>result of technology technology might<br>facilitate more of it<br>um I do think that for our young people<br>counting likes and things like that has<br>but certainly become a bigger thing and<br>that is I I think that can be quite<br>anxiety producing for young people and<br>that that is problematic but in terms of<br>um whether or not our relationships are<br>less real as a result of Technology I'm<br>not sure that's the case I think that<br>that can happen in any type of setting<br>and that probably has more to do with<br>um even going back to what Craig said<br>right at that beginning you know the<br>ability to be vulnerable which is what<br>enables us to form you know really<br>meaningful relationships and you can do<br>that face to face and you can do that<br>online<br>yeah interesting interesting thanks<br>Holly<br>Carol<br>um I don't know<br>I think it's a vexing question that each<br>of us has to take responsibility for<br>you know how we how we make our own<br>world meaningful<br>so we often hear that older people are<br>particularly perhaps suffer from<br>loneliness in a feeling they'll just<br>have to separate out social isolation is<br>different to loneliness and and not<br>confuse those two to start with because<br>you can be in a crowd and I guess every<br>one of us have felt lonely in a crowd<br>could suddenly We're alone and and wow<br>there's all those people right kind of<br>big railway station in Frankfurt or<br>wherever you know because all of the<br>others are different to us<br>um and<br>um<br>and so loneliness is a felt thing and<br>that's why I said well<br>it's a self-responsibility thing but we<br>can make our communities and our<br>connections meaningful in our human<br>endeavor by honoring people in lots of<br>different ways<br>so that they do feel part of the whole<br>and that's where I come back to the role<br>of Elders in our society and that they<br>they shouldn't be alone in times of of<br>the vulnerability of life and they<br>should be loved to birds and we're so<br>lucky in New Zealand from my point of<br>view that talmari says well Elders are a<br>tonga and um and we do love them and<br>they have a place and we value their<br>wisdom you know uh the culture of of<br>bringing the past forward for tomorrow<br>um is is very very special and wonderful<br>and I I just dream the day when New<br>Zealand really understands that<br>foreign<br>how do you see loneliness for for<br>younger people do you think it's<br>uh<br>it's always been an issue and it's no<br>better or worse than it ever has ever<br>been<br>or do you think it's different<br>yeah I think it's complicated now<br>because you've had two two and a bit<br>years of covert and and what you've also<br>had there is you've had the and for a<br>boarding student a particularly you've<br>had the student that's um thrived<br>that there might be an early child has<br>gone back as a year 11 student has just<br>been in his or her room and<br>um and then they just have to deal stuff<br>with stuff when they need to deal with<br>it and they can choose when they're on<br>or when they're off and so I think that<br>does create loneliness at times<br>um in the fact that I don't want to deal<br>with it at the moment so I'll just<br>disconnect completely<br>um which can actually be a good thing in<br>a way but it's hard when you then come<br>back again talk about it in the Real<br>World the Flesh<br>um so I do think covert has has made<br>that tougher<br>um and then again probably just refer<br>back to that social media and there's<br>plenty of you know research and whatnot<br>around this around the perfect person or<br>the perfect ideal or you know you're<br>always striving to be better<br>stronger fitter whatever it might be<br>because of that comparison<br>um how do we get around that you you<br>just we just need to educate better<br>earlier and<br>um and get people to understand again<br>um be who you are and be proud of who<br>you are and where you're from and the<br>more we can educate that side of things<br>I think I think the better and you know<br>the exciting part there is around you<br>know the changes in education with<br>matalanga Maori and uh Etc that is<br>coming in is I think really going to<br>help ground people and and actually look<br>at who you are and be proud of that and<br>then you actually get away from the<br>lowliness side of things I feel<br>so Charlene we're right back to I think<br>what you said at the beginning of<br>knowing yourself and where you belong as<br>as a basis for reaching out to others in<br>the in the University context uh as<br>Craig mentioned it's been a challenging<br>couple of years with University students<br>also doing things by distance what do<br>you think that's done for the feelings<br>of loneliness<br>uh in that in that sector some students<br>really enjoy the the um<br>the online environment some like the<br>hybrid model<br>um yeah so so you can see there are pros<br>and cons<br>um for many of them I know personally<br>as an educator I personally enjoy the<br>the face-to-face<br>um model but we in this hybrid State<br>it's really important that we are able<br>to<br>um to move in both spaces and I'm seeing<br>that more with the flexibility even at<br>the University<br>um flexibility and working from home and<br>and cut and coming in<br>so um yeah things have definitely<br>changed I think it's important that we<br>take the learnings from<br>the pandemic and we keep those really<br>good things you know so that's the<br>Silver Lining really we keep those<br>really good things from learning and<br>what we know about learning and for um<br>individuals for students you know some<br>of them have worked out actually I<br>really like um being at home being able<br>to engage when I need to having my um<br>a quiet space where I can just write so<br>it's really worked for some students but<br>not for others and it's it's knowing<br>what works for you what your strengths<br>are and what you need and you know when<br>we talk about whakapapa again it's that<br>identity and and knowing yourself you'll<br> a papa and having that a real<br>strong<br>um<br>real strong identity knowing your place<br>in the world and then knowing what your<br>responsibilities are in that place<br>yeah so just interestingly picking up on<br>that idea of both knowing yourself and<br>what you need but also your<br>responsibilities to other people if we<br>look at something you mentioned Charlene<br>which is that many of us now in a in a<br>job sense<br>do a combination of working in the<br>office and working from home and this<br>has been the subject of heated debate<br>and lots of workplaces and if the<br>foundation of a connected Society is<br>strong social relationships there's been<br>some very strong views pro and con as to<br>what that right balance is so I'll be<br>really interested in all of your ideas<br>on on how we think about that starting<br>maybe with you Holly yeah well I I lead<br>a team<br>um and I have loved the opportunity to<br>work from home which is where I am at<br>the moment<br>um because I get to be with my dogs as<br>well and I you know I just love that but<br>um not everyone on my team loves that<br>and that's really important to recognize<br>is that we all kind of need something<br>different and people have different home<br>environments and that means they might<br>want to be out of their home or they<br>might prefer to be in it<br>um you know and I do a lot of other<br>things outside of the home I planned or<br>netball you know I get involved in<br>politics I am involved in dog circles so<br>there's a lot going on<br>um but that's not the same for everybody<br>so I think in terms of this hybrid model<br>I think that that's a fantastic way to<br>work personally I think most of my team<br>would agree but what we've found as a<br>result of that is um that in our office<br>where we used to have 10 or 14 people we<br>now might have two you know um and there<br>might be a different Tour on different<br>days but it means your work environment<br>suddenly isn't a place of connectivity<br>that it was before it's not a place<br>where you suddenly<br>um a meeting with people and and<br>sparking off ideas from each other or<br>sharing what's happened on a weekend or<br>whatever so we're actually looking now<br>at going well maybe the environment that<br>we're working in isn't really fit for<br>purpose anymore and maybe what we need<br>to do is start connecting with other<br>community organizations in a similar<br>position and look to HUB so that we<br>perhaps have more people on any one day<br>in a shared space so that's able to<br>satisfy<br>um people sort of need to connect on<br>that face-to-face level but with the<br>flexibility of still working from home<br>um and I think that's probably going to<br>be a little bit of the way of the future<br>certainly for organizations like us<br>thanks Holly Carol do you have a<br>perspective on this<br>no I don't<br>and so I love my own space I love my<br>home space I love going out and meeting<br>people I could control local government<br>people that I meet with on policy plans<br>and stuff to meet me over coffee<br>um yeah<br>um I think they enjoy having that space<br>as well<br>um<br>I don't know about we're walking dogs in<br>work time Holly I think that's<br>um<br>sure that's good thought full time and<br>um and it's usually on a lunch break<br>very productive let's say it's very<br>productive<br>um yeah and it's it's I think it's<br>lovely however that the workplace is<br>more flexible and it's more humanized<br>and more understanding<br>um you know I observe the difference<br>from<br>um when I was kind of locked up to work<br>in an office that um<br>uh lunch breaks was strict people<br>attended work even when they were sick<br>um you didn't get hearing to leave<br>fathers didn't own children from the<br>workplace to the home<br>um yeah so the world has become<br>um<br>um I'd say more connected and more<br>humanized despite technology and despite<br>all our crises I I think if we hold on<br>to the fact that we human beings that<br>need to grow and love each other then<br>the outcome has to be good really<br>thanks Carol<br>well I think we might do a final round<br>of our of our of our closing question<br>just to make sure we give everyone time<br>to say anything that they haven't<br>managed to say in the question so far<br>so the question is if there was one<br>thing you would like people to start<br>doing today to help create a connected<br>Society what would it be<br>Craig<br>um stop looking at your phone when<br>you're having a conversation with<br>someone else<br>yeah<br>if you've got the the time volunteer in<br>your community<br>wow thank you Charlene I didn't get the<br>chance to talk about teams Jennifer so I<br>was like so that's where that stems from<br>you know whether it be coaching managing<br>being the taxi driver or the Cook or<br>whatever it is<br>um if you can volunteer and give back<br>and like for me you know rugby is and<br>actually not just rugby but other sports<br>has given me so much and so giving back<br>to being really important<br>thanks Charlene<br>that role of sporting teams and other<br>clubs is something we haven't had time<br>to explore but it must be a huge part of<br>creating connections I think in<br>particularly connections through the<br>different age groups<br>Ollie<br>um Charlene kind of stole mine because<br>I'm 100 behind you on that but but the<br>other thing I think I would love to see<br>people do a little more is get to know<br>their neighbors quite literally and in<br>their neighborhood knock on doors say hi<br>to Neighbors when you get to walk your<br>dogs say hi to people you pass just you<br>know if you see someone out gardening<br>across the road walk over say hi<br>introduce yourself I I just think you<br>know with<br>um a lot of us have lost a lot of those<br>relationships and and often working<br>full-time meant that we didn't have the<br>same kind of time to invest in them<br>um but our neighborhoods are that sort<br>of that first layer directly around us<br>and when we have a crises like covert<br>it's really important to to be able to<br>support those people around you so I<br>would suggest that if you could just do<br>one thing in the next month it would be<br>go around and get to know who the people<br>are just living in your immediate area<br>thanks Holly I I love one of the things<br>there were many things I didn't love<br>about the pandemic years but one of the<br>things I did love is during the first<br>lockdown when people put teddy bears in<br>their windows so that people moving past<br>could see them and it became such a<br>great thing not just for children but it<br>meant that even though we couldn't<br>really see see each other so much or<br>spend time together there was a<br>connection it kind of bonded the<br>humanness of of us all together which I<br>think was wonderful<br>Carol yes we had an example in the<br>streets near where I live<br>um because I became more disciplined<br>about going for a walk at a certain time<br>um and um many of my neighbors would<br>bring their chairs out and their wine<br>glass at four o'clock and and you know<br>um connecting in ways that they don't do<br>in an everyday way and so that links<br>back with my hyper local communities uh<br>I I'd like to see more people as I said<br>at the beginning participating in our<br>Democratic processes and starting to<br>reshape their communities themselves and<br>and having the resources flow to the<br>things that they really want to to have<br>and need to make their communities safe<br>places<br>action<br>yeah I had a conversation with one of my<br>young adult children about one of my<br>young adults voted in the local<br>community local government elections and<br>the other didn't<br>and we had a very heated conversation as<br>a family about<br>um you can't complain about things if<br>you don't take part in the Democratic<br>process and his answer was yes but my<br>vote doesn't count because I'm just one<br>and and his brother's answer back was<br>well if we all said that none of us<br>would participate so I think there<br>certainly is something to be said for<br>taking Agency for what's around you yes<br>foreign<br>a connected Society is something I think<br>we all know that we all instinctively<br>need we all instinctively want I don't<br>think I've met a person yet who doesn't<br>want to belong to one<br>we all have different ideas about how to<br>create it and that probably is the magic<br>that comes from the strengths of those<br>different views and I'm<br>would like to close our conversation<br>today with something Craig said right at<br>the beginning which is<br>the willingness to be vulnerable about<br>what we each need and want is the<br>foundation for<br>the ability to communicate and make<br>connections so I think as you put it<br>Holly you're not<br>um you're not lonely in a crowd that<br>that that that you do have that<br>willingness to connect and reach out and<br>therefore<br>um connect with other people<br>so thank you all for participating and<br>we'll close it off there and hand it<br>all right</p></main><footer
