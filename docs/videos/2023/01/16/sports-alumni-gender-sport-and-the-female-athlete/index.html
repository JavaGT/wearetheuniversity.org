academics where our<br>panelists share their experiences and<br>knowledge about this fast-paced and<br>changing industry<br>now my name is jamie fitzgerald i'm a<br>proud alumni of the university of<br>waikato and it's a real privilege to be<br>here this evening uh the title of<br>today's discussion gender sport and the<br>female athlete now i suspect even in its<br>title we all can appreciate its<br>scope complexity<br>and uh and perhaps even a bit of<br>controversy so i'm thrilled to be here<br>to learn from our panelists and for a<br>few reasons<br>now i've got two daughters starting out<br>on their own sporting journeys<br>i'm on the management board of an all<br>girls secondary school in wellington<br>and again i think maybe even this links<br>to our chat today on language systems<br>and structure uh i'm a volunteer coach<br>and committee member of multiple sports<br>teams uh and above all though i love<br>sport uh and i'm inspired by people just<br>wanting to be the best<br>their best selves<br>on and off the field so as a parent<br>sporter a supporter and influencer of<br>how sport is organized and experienced<br>by people<br>i want to know what i should be thinking<br>or doing to help people achieve their<br>goals in sport and recreation<br>whatever those goals might be so we're<br>going to make the discussion tonight<br>really stimulating i can't wait to learn<br>from our panelists but also practical<br>and i suspect all of us here feel the<br>same way now there's no introduction<br>required for our panelists due to partly<br>i guess the time we have together but<br>also their bios are available on the<br>website<br>so i'm really keen that we get straight<br>into it and so amy i'd love it if we<br>could kick off with you if that's okay<br>um so tell us what do you see as the<br>biggest challenges<br>in relation to gender and sport facing<br>participants in aotearoa and new zealand<br>thanks jamie um obviously there are a<br>number of challenges um but when i was<br>reflecting on this question i was<br>thinking about you know what's most<br>salient to me and apart from things like<br>inequitable access to resources or<br>access to opportunities<br>i think one of the things we need to<br>remember is that when we talk about<br>gender we aren't just talking about<br>gender so you know women and girls<br>aren't just women and girls there are<br>other axes of identity that intersect<br>which mean that sexuality ethnicity race<br>ability age culture religion all of<br>those things layer into someone's<br>experience and the more of those aspects<br>of identity that you have that position<br>you i guess<br>in a minority group the more complex the<br>barriers are to your experiences and<br>sometimes the more difficult it is to<br>access opportunities that meet your<br>needs so i think it's really important<br>to understand that you know we can't<br>just isolate gender as as one barrier or<br>one um<br>one thing that makes it difficult to<br>access and participate we need to think<br>bigger<br>and the other thing that i really wanted<br>to highlight was that we need to take a<br>multi-pronged approach to addressing<br>barriers for women and girls in sport<br>and physical activity so we need to work<br>from the bottom up and the top down and<br>when i think about the bottom up i think<br>about working at the level of the<br>community<br>working with co-design influencing<br>actual delivery and what that looks like<br>for female participants but at the same<br>time working at the top down so<br>challenging and changing the<br>context of participation so what are the<br>images and the messages or narratives<br>that women and girls are seeing<br>and how do we<br>change those so that the messages about<br>who should participate what they should<br>do are actually reflective of what women<br>and girls want to do and make them feel<br>like they belong or<br>that they're capable of doing things<br>that maybe society tells them that<br>they're not<br>gee i think if we were to unpick all of<br>that we'd um you know 36 hours later we<br>may not have even covered everything uh<br>this is going to be exciting we've got<br>there's a lot of us here um i mean you<br>talk about inequity and you talk about<br>labels uh<br>mariah how about we come to you so<br>gender sport you know the female athlete<br>you know there's a lot of<br>effort being put into this space um but<br>what are you seeing in terms of uh<br>what's going on to the gender identity<br>and eligibility to participate then<br>yeah um i guess i can really just speak<br>to what's happening um<br>you know in athletics so um if we start<br>from the very top with world athletics<br>um<br>we've got two two policies uh<br>around gender and um eligibility<br>regulations so<br>um<br>the first is around uh eligibility<br>regulations for transgender athletes i<br>guess just the overarching rules um<br>processes and all of that<br>we've actually got a second policy now<br>um that was just uh<br>developed actually in 2019<br>and it's the uh the eligibility<br>conditions for female transgender<br>athletes<br>specifically in relation to<br>athletes with differences of sex<br>development so the intersex athletes<br>so as amy was saying before around<br>you know there's so many ways people may<br>identify themselves and this this policy<br>was brought in um<br>after the rio olympics actually<br>uh when we were kind of seeing a<br>different um<br>you know different differences in some<br>female athletes so this um yeah this<br>policy kind of addresses that but it's<br>actually only um interestingly applies<br>to athletes that compete<br>in the events track races between 400<br>meters and the mile<br>so there's a certain uh criteria that<br>these uh female athletes must meet<br>um<br>yeah in order to be eligible to compete<br>i know it's a massive massive topic that<br>we could yeah<br>so<br>yeah so that's interesting so you've<br>talked about the structure of of which<br>events uh it's it's applied to uh we've<br>also talked about structure i'm just<br>curious so you know i come from a rowing<br>background and the events the sports the<br>the races it's you know you're either<br>in a male competing event you're either<br>in a female event<br>and yet there are other sports<br>like<br>like my grandparents who play bowls and<br>it's all the same team you know it's<br>just you go out and you just do your<br>thing right now across the panel we've<br>got loads of research that's been<br>completed holly le you know what are you<br>seeing in this space what what what can<br>we learn you know in terms of the<br>structures is it being forced upon us or<br>can we do something about it i think in<br>a way it's coming like amy said from the<br>top down and the bottom up we've you<br>know just seen the ioc um their new<br>guidelines around transgender<br>participation in sport at the olympic<br>level but they're very very clear that<br>these you know prioritizing human rights<br>here participation in sport is a human<br>right that everyone should have access<br>to that message should trickle all the<br>way down to grassroots and i know sports<br>sport new zealand's working on a big um<br>policy document around this as well<br>because because really you know what is<br>sport for and when we start getting into<br>the nitty-gritty of it we've got<br>athletes who are training to be the very<br>best but also<br>if we're saying there's no room for you<br>here um<br>that's a pretty s that's a pretty<br>horrific message to be sending to to<br>young people and often young people who<br>might be struggling with gender<br>identification and<br>and you know sport and almost<br>you know what we need to see here is a<br>bit of reflecting society with society<br>we're trying to move not from binary<br>understandings of male female actually<br>recognizing the fluidity and<br>multiplicities of gender and but sport<br>you know it has a long long history of<br>being created by men and for men<br>and being um it reinforces binaries<br>means but here we'll participate over<br>here and actually sport reinforces those<br>binaries and so we are seeing a lot of<br>tensions in that area but we're seeing<br>some good leadership too<br>and um you know<br>definitely it's a topic that is very<br>controversial and we've always got to<br>remember that our words um have impact<br>and um<br>yeah i think i think we need to always<br>be working towards more inclusive uh and<br>supportive spaces for all<br>well<br>you talked about various campaigns that<br>are happening around to try and address<br>this and and i'm going to maybe ask you<br>a little bit more about this in a moment<br>with feedback from the other panelists<br>around some of those campaigns and and<br>there's one um i read about called it's<br>my move you might be able to mention<br>talk about that<br>but you talk about the labels and i'm<br>keen to to hear from you about media now<br>a bit of a shout out to one of my former<br>lecturers uh at the waco management<br>school he he i remember this phrase from<br>an and he talked about the media about<br>it either being a pest we debated<br>whether it was a passive mirror or an<br>active shaper of how we see things<br>and so i want to ask you holly about<br>this<br>so<br>how has it affected how we<br>we see things or through the media is it<br>um<br>yeah tell me tell me about tell me about<br>that are they are they enforcing<br>reinforcing some of these labels or is<br>that just society<br>yeah well you know if we we have there's<br>been a lot of research on media coverage<br>of women in sport and historically we've<br>seen the media you know marginalizing<br>trivializing sexualizing women in sport<br>um<br>though you know over the last decade<br>we've seen important changes there we're<br>seeing more coverage of women in sport<br>we've seen a big 10 million dollar<br>investment from uh new zealand sport<br>from the government big part of that was<br>about changing those visibilities<br>changing those narratives that amy um<br>talked about before<br>if you can't see it you can't beat it<br>right and so we've seen sky they've had<br>a big new campaign um<br>that's been very much focused on more<br>coverage of women in sport and so we've<br>sort of seen a shift there um<br>i think it was last year<br>women's sport in new zealand accounted<br>for about 15 percent of the coverage<br>of of all sport in new zealand we're<br>we're seeing a bit you know we're seeing<br>audiences and fans building around<br>women's sport with whether it's the<br>cricket whether it's the rugby whether<br>it's the olympics um so we're seeing<br>changes there but still nothing like 50<br>50. we're so far away from that but it's<br>also interesting to think about um<br>you know not just kind of those tv kind<br>of newspapers but also thinking about<br>the social media landscape where we're<br>seeing more and more sports women using<br>social media to tell their own stories<br>to document their own kind of journeys<br>and building audiences around their<br>sport around their own careers but that<br>also comes with risks we see a lot of<br>abuse happening in that space a lot of<br>sexism<br>um and with our research with hyphen<br>sport new zealand has shown that<br>actually you know social media is really<br>impacting our sports women's uh body<br>image issues as well so it's a it's a<br>double-edged sword in terms of those<br>disabilities but we are seeing a lot of<br>um investment in that area and a lot of<br>good work happening like the locker room<br>for example telling stories about women<br>and sport in new zealand everyday women<br>girls and women as well and we're seeing<br>you know sports organizations like sport<br>waikaka for example doing a really good<br>job around that as well so there is<br>progress happening<br>yeah no that's thank you i'm going to<br>ask you later on perhaps some of uh some<br>of that research that you've done but<br>also some practical things of who how<br>might the rest of us be able to um<br>change or or what might we be able to do<br>to try and address that so you know how<br>about amanda what do you take from all<br>of this so far you know uh from a from a<br>para athlete or from<br>the olympic um<br>from the olympic paralympic committee<br>point of view tell me what you think<br>about this chat so far what stands out<br>for you i was just thinking about that<br>like you know from the work that i'm<br>doing is about highly impaired athletes<br>and and just basically how opportunities<br>for highly impaired athletes are<br>listening as time goes on so you know at<br>the last olympics there might have been<br>four events that were available for an<br>s2 swimmer but in the next olympics<br>there's only one and then and so like<br>what holly was speaking about that whole<br>idea around the visibility of disability<br>so the kind of the super bodies are the<br>bodies that are celebrated and again<br>there's way more emphasis on the males<br>of and and you know that there's a<br>gender division as well and so you know<br>the the work that i've been trying to<br>focus on is you know highly impaired<br>athletes<br>nobody knows what it takes to get us<br>into the pool and to the court onto the<br>pitch so it's just that kind of idea<br>about doing research<br>educating like um i presented um for the<br>ipc<br>in brussels around some of the research<br>that i've done and what was great is<br>that<br>swimming world swimming and ipc swimming<br>reached out to just to talk to me about<br>what it what it takes to get highly<br>impaired athletes you know greater<br>inclusion how to lift the participation<br>and so that's that's the sort of high<br>level work that i'm doing but you know<br>just around everyday stuff it's in new<br>zealand you've got you know 24 of the<br>population identifies disabled and and<br>you've got something like 11<br>of children are disabled and then so the<br>big push with sport new zealand is about<br>is about play and that idea of physical<br>literacy and then try to create pathways<br>and so<br>and then part of that is is the<br>organizations that are delivering<br>disability sport in new zealand are the<br>halbergs and the paraffins but we're<br>quite limited we're we're dotted around<br>the country but what i'm sort of wanting<br>people to realize if they reach out to<br>those organizations if they've got an<br>idea and they're somewhere isolated and<br>they think you know what we want to<br>provide some accessible opportunities of<br>sport how about just reach out to your<br>nearest parafed or your nearest helberg<br>and go hey what am i going to do to make<br>tennis work for disabled participation<br>what are going to do to make<br>this work and then we can be resources<br>we don't actually need to be in your<br>location but we are absolutely open and<br>happy to share the knowledge so that's<br>going to raise participation at that<br>lower level which hopefully then feeds<br>in to competitive sport you know and<br>starts to raise the profile normalize<br>our our our being in those spaces<br>because having kind of disabled bodies<br>and able-bodied spaces it challenges<br>people and there's all that unconscious<br>bias so you know it's complex and again<br>i can chat all night for you too<br>yeah i mean so so let's get to some<br>practical things then with that you've<br>talked about how events are set up or<br>physical spaces<br>so<br>talk to us as<br>listening<br>and on the panel will be uh<br>administrators of sport event organizers<br>you know and so on<br>so what else should we be thinking of<br>what could we be doing to address some<br>of these things you've just touched on<br>give us give us some few practical<br>things or what's on your mind well stuck<br>i mean straight up if if all um sport if<br>anyone involved in sport had a massive<br>chunk sport and rec degrees include a<br>disability component that would be<br>fantastic<br>if if all will organize those<br>organizations mandated that all coaches<br>and<br>and anyone engaging with the public has<br>some disability awareness and then maybe<br>parafeds and hellberg we could come up<br>with some some resources that would just<br>just help to like broaden that knowledge<br>to what to<br>make people aware of those unconscious<br>biases have them sort of question<br>themselves before they you know and then<br>they can start to think about well is<br>this venue even going to work if we've<br>got a disabled component we want to put<br>a<br>disabled element into this or an element<br>of access into this can we hold it in<br>this space will it work if someone in a<br>wheelchair rocks up here you know so<br>there's just some really i think that we<br>could just start to educate i think that<br>would really start to bring change and<br>raise awareness but in terms of putting<br>on an event just just again reach out to<br>those paraffins and those halberds and<br>people with lived experience because<br>honestly because we know how great it<br>feels to be involved and to be included<br>we're absolutely<br>generally very willing to share our<br>knowledge and try and help because it if<br>it gets other people to play we just<br>want to keep the love you know because<br>it feels so good to be active<br>so there's so there's the challenge to<br>us all listening uh folks around just<br>having to reach out we've got plenty of<br>people there wanting to uh support<br>provide and making it easier for us but<br>we need to to reach out<br>you talk about uh<br>inclusion er<br>felicity let me just come to you how do<br>we create from your point of view uh<br>some of these spaces where<br>people<br>you know don't feel judged for their<br>performance you know from a from on the<br>sporting<br>field point of view<br>yeah i guess it's um<br>looking at things at all levels um and<br>obviously in all different environments<br>it is going to be different from sort of<br>your age group teams your school teams<br>all the way up to high performance<br>obviously<br>as you become more high performance or<br>into that elite level of sport<br>it is<br>a lot of your team selections and<br>whatnot are purely judged on performance<br>um which is obviously where it gets a<br>bit tricky um to manage but i guess it's<br>coming at it from a whole holistic<br>approach and actually looking at the<br>whole human and um<br>that they've got things going on outside<br>of sport as well um<br>so say for example if you are a<br>professional athlete um<br>and you're not performing you're not<br>just thinking that oh i'm gonna lose my<br>contract i'm gonna<br>potentially not have an income in a few<br>months if um if i don't start performing<br>um they have got something to fall back<br>on in the long run<br>um<br>and yeah i guess the management of the<br>athlete themselves them knowing that<br>they are supported<br>in more ways than just the sport as well<br>yeah let's let's kind of dig into this a<br>little bit further so if we remind<br>ourselves around the topic uh gender<br>sport and the female athlete<br>you know i'd love to hear your point of<br>view on this felicity if we in the<br>previous uh episode of this uh series<br>you know there was shane mccloud and<br>wayne smith they referenced this book<br>belonging and culture within sport<br>and so i'm just interested from your<br>perspective of is there actually a<br>fundamental difference in sporting<br>culture<br>uh in new zealand between<br>genders male female just from your point<br>of view how do you feel about this<br>yeah i think the females enjoy making it<br>a really fun um<br>aspect to it especially um and<br>generally supporting each other um and<br>being genuine about it um<br>rather than they kind of say that<br>obviously men can<br>quite often have a a bit of a fist fight<br>in a sense and then they get over it<br>pretty quickly but um<br>females generally generally<br>sort of drag it on a little bit longer<br>or um<br>yeah it goes between two people back and<br>forth and<br>doesn't get resolved overly quickly um<br>so that's an element of obviously<br>managing a a female environment as well<br>as<br>having those open and honest<br>conversations but<br>making sure that they are genuine um and<br>there is the support network from<br>your coaches to management to the sport<br>psychologists to manage um athletes<br>mental health um<br>it it's it's similar obviously everyone<br>at the end of the day is human so yeah<br>um<br>what do you what do you think about this<br>mariah from an athletics point of view<br>you know the that call it the brand of<br>different genders the brand of the male<br>athletics athlete the brand of the<br>female athletics athlete<br>you know is it different<br>challenges<br>you know we'd love to hear from you what<br>you think and then maybe uh amy and<br>holly what what research are you<br>learning so maybe you know mariah you<br>first<br>yeah uh i'm really not sure around in<br>terms of like the cultural differences<br>between sports um<br>to be honest i think that um well my<br>experience as an athlete um<br>i think i've been really fortunate like<br>athletics is actually a really inclusive<br>sport<br>um<br>in terms of genders and and parent<br>athletics as well you know para athletes<br>compete all of our competitions as well<br>they're integrated into competitions<br>um but in terms of um you know<br>opportunities um<br>facilities uniforms funding it's all<br>pretty equal for for men and women and<br>athletics which is amazing if anything<br>um<br>if there's a an inequality or a<br>difference that i've noticed actually<br>more recently it might just be in prize<br>money<br>um when when there's been more prize<br>money on offer for men<br>um so that's been that's been raised<br>yeah the issue has been raised to meet<br>organizers<br>but yeah no i'm really fortunate<br>actually that my experience has been um<br>has been really positive in that space<br>yeah<br>so we know that there are we know that<br>it's possible<br>for there to be great things<br>things happening amy holly who wants to<br>you know chime in here with what your<br>thoughts are yeah i'm happy to speak to<br>this one if i speak from a um i guess<br>what the participant wants perspective<br>we're seeing significant differences in<br>i guess the needs and motivations<br>between gender when it comes to<br>participation in sport and physical<br>activity so we often see things like<br>social connection and social interaction<br>really high up on what<br>women and girls want to experience out<br>of their physical activity participation<br>whether that's through sport or active<br>recreation<br>um we're seeing things like um you know<br>um competition really high up on on<br>men's agendas for why they want to be<br>involved where that ranks quite a lot<br>lower in terms of women and i'm speaking<br>at the participation level obviously not<br>the high performance one but we are<br>seeing significant gender differences in<br>some of the aspects that<br>different genders want to experience out<br>of their participation so<br>social connection would be one of the<br>biggest ones that we're seeing in terms<br>of ranking really highly for women and<br>girls<br>also things like you know weight<br>management and fitness you know<br>we're told as women that we should watch<br>our weight and that's obviously been<br>internalized by some women in terms of<br>their motivations for for being active<br>but we are seeing feeling and looking<br>good as part of women and girls<br>motivations and that's not just about<br>weight it's about you know the physical<br>effects um of being active<br>for women and girls in terms of how they<br>feel about themselves and their<br>development and their mood and things<br>like that as well where we don't often<br>see<br>some of those things ranking as highly<br>for for men and boys so when we think<br>about culture and environment it's<br>really important that we understand<br>what different genders want to<br>experience out of their participation<br>and we actually deliver to that because<br>if we don't we're going to lose you know<br>women and girls specifically when we<br>have actually done a lot of work often<br>to engage them<br>yeah<br>holly<br>yeah i think it's really interesting um<br>when we start making comparisons between<br>men and women because particularly in<br>the elite sport environment<br>we've got to be really careful of not<br>sort of essentializing gender<br>differences as if men all men are the<br>same and all women are the same because<br>we know there's so much diversity within<br>a category of women um<br>there's you know to me lots of different<br>personality types lots of different<br>motivational styles and and lots of<br>different things that work for them and<br>things that don't work for them and just<br>as there are men and we look at the<br>international research on<br>on coaching environments and what works<br>for the men and women in sport<br>you know even uh the way we ask<br>questions um is often quite based on<br>these gendered assumptions and we've<br>just finished some big research here in<br>new zealand with um with elite male and<br>female coaches who've adopted really<br>proactive approaches to working with<br>their sports women<br>around health issues and even when<br>they're being really really proactive<br>and supporting their athletes and not<br>just performance but also you know<br>holistic view of health and well-being<br>even when this language are these really<br>essentialist gendered ideas around what<br>you know and they're still using this<br>language of girls you know a really<br>paternalistic language so we've got so<br>much to unpack here and i even think amy<br>about the some of the surveys that go<br>around and<br>and women saying you know they're not<br>quite as motivated by competition but is<br>that perhaps because the way sports<br>competitions have been framed has always<br>been through you know sport<br>the systems have been created by men for<br>men and maybe those versions of<br>competition don't work for many many<br>girls and women but it's not to say that<br>women might actually thrive an<br>environment<br>that<br>has been created by and for them and i<br>think that's the issues we're seeing you<br>know just yesterday<br>a major investigation by rugby new<br>zealand and to our blackburn's culture<br>there and it exposed you know<br>intersecting variables of racism and<br>sexism and really<br>problematic issues going on the highest<br>level and this is one of 11 sports in<br>our country that have had these<br>investigations going on<br>and<br>and what we're seeing here is sporting<br>systems not working for many of our<br>elite sports women because these systems<br>were created by men for men and as we've<br>seen women's thought become increasingly<br>professionalized where we had women once<br>organizing sport running sport often on<br>volunteer hours doing it for the love of<br>it now we've got men in those roles and<br>they bring with them particular ideas of<br>what sport is and what it should be and<br>how to run it<br>and what we're seeing is women's voices<br>not being heard women don't feel safe to<br>express their concerns and their<br>vulnerabilities many of them are<br>stepping away walking away from<br>hypocrite sport meaning some of them are<br>brave enough to speak out and share<br>their stories but we've really got a<br>system here that's that's not supporting<br>the health and well-being of our elite<br>sports women and i think part of that is<br>because of the structures and<br>organization of sport and we've got lots<br>of initiatives trying to change that<br>trying to get more women into leadership<br>roles but still we're sitting around<br>board meetings and and who's there<br>predominantly men we might have a few<br>a few women and seats there but still<br>it's it's men's versions and visions of<br>sport that continue to control<br>um what we're seeing and that's<br>you know<br>it's uh we've got a long way to go<br>yeah i mean you mentioned that there are<br>uh events uh designed for<br>women that are working um<br>created<br>to<br>uh designed that from the pers their<br>perspective it is fulfilling um what<br>they're looking uh to achieve uh i am<br>keen to hear though you mentioned<br>earlier the support that you are<br>providing<br>coaches managers uh<br>listening like we like we talked about<br>and heard from amanda around things that<br>we can do<br>we have coaches administrators managers<br>listening to the panel uh and i<br>mentioned earlier that i'm i'm kind of<br>one of those help us out what are some<br>things we could do when it comes to<br>those structures<br>what what can we do that incorporates<br>greater diversity of<br>perspectives<br>to make our thought better<br>uh yeah i think you know there's lots of<br>layers to that but it can certainly<br>start with the self and start unpacking<br>some of our own sort of gendered<br>assumptions around um<br>you know<br>watching participating or watching we're<br>supporting women's sport<br>um you know do we watch as much in the<br>home do you watch as much woman sport as<br>you watch men's sport if not what is<br>that message telling to your children<br>about your values<br>um in in sport or how do we talk about<br>what language do we use to talk about<br>women and girls in sport how do we<br>comment on bodies how do we comment on<br>achievements um you know our kids are<br>picking all of this up and this is going<br>to transfer into the next generation so<br>really we do need to unpack our own kind<br>of um<br>our biases that have been deeply<br>embodied you know in us from from a<br>young age through our sporting systems<br>that have been<br>um you know quite masculine often um and<br>male sort of perspectives so we can<br>start by really sitting with some of our<br>own tensions you know we come back to<br>the issue of transgender in sport that<br>can be a very um<br>uncomfortable topic for a lot of people<br>and a lot of the way the media framed<br>the laurel hubbard um situation with the<br>olympics last year it was very<br>polarizing so people had to take a<br>perspective on it they had to sit in one<br>side of the argument and i'd say you<br>know i recommend to sit in the tension<br>sit with those uncomfortable moments<br>don't feel like you have to take an<br>opinion on it just try to unpack what's<br>going on for you there and um and try<br>and educate yourself and and always<br>you know trying to create space for and<br>listening to the voices of the woman<br>around you whose experience<br>is um is really valuable yeah<br>well um you know for amanda felicity<br>mariah you know we've just we've just<br>heard holly talk about<br>um<br>you know athletes and the pressure on<br>them and their<br>their identity and and uh outside of<br>their sport or or<br>you know what they're involved in all of<br>those additional pressures<br>so from your point of view<br>how do<br>females or<br>uh those with you know whatever your<br>agenda<br>the role of you as a role model is just<br>does this bring on just additional<br>pressure<br>that<br>well from a performance point of view on<br>the field doesn't help but off the field<br>it from<br>well-being just it erodes it you know of<br>the three of you who<br>what are you seeing you know what can we<br>i guess as holly said um<br>just watching as much sport as we can on<br>the tv at home of women's sport um i was<br>lucky enough<br>last weekend to go weekend before last<br>to go to the women's world cup final<br>here in christchurch<br>and<br>to be honest the crowd that was there<br>just blew me away how many people were<br>out and about watching<br>and it was a phenomenal game of cricket<br>um so just watching those spectacles and<br>if you've got young girls taking them<br>down<br>to watch women's sport<br>i don't think i knew that the white<br>ferns even existed till i was about 11<br>years old<br>so yeah getting that exposure out there<br>for those those younger players coming<br>through um it's been awesome from my<br>perspective to see how much<br>woman sport has evolved over sort of my<br>career the last 10 15 years<br>um and it's only going to get better<br>over the next next however long so<br>yeah i agree oh mariah<br>yeah with the visibility kind of piece<br>as well and i think well hopefully<br>hollywood know more about this that um<br>female athletes are getting more<br>exposure but<br>not only in as<br>as an athlete but um you know like<br>female coaches as well um need more<br>attention um<br>we<br>noticed as a sport there are um there<br>are few fewer female coaches um<br>especially in the<br>kind of performance or pre-high<br>performance um space so as an nso we're<br>um<br>we're trying to come up with initiatives<br>to to upskill and support our female<br>coaches to try and develop them because<br>you know if you can't see um you can't<br>see them it's hard to be you know<br>motivated by that we want we want some<br>female<br>leaders and role models out there for<br>our young athletes to show that you can<br>like there is a pathway you can do this<br>um also even on committees as well you<br>know um<br>typically committees athletic club<br>committees have been dominated by males<br>so um<br>yeah encouraging parents to get involved<br>on your club committees and volunteer in<br>those um president uh secretary treasury<br>roles<br>actually uh does a lot of um does a lot<br>of good for our young athletes and up<br>and coming<br>yeah<br>you you mentioned earlier mariah the<br>examples of what's happening<br>uh overseas in terms of policy um<br>with with gender er even albeit with<br>just a couple of different events have<br>you heard how though any any athletes uh<br>impacted by that um how have they coped<br>you know what's been what's been their<br>reaction whether they've been included<br>in events or not in events<br>you know what's what's happening for<br>those athletes off uh off the track<br>yeah i can only speak of a couple<br>international examples so um i think<br>caster siminya was probably our most<br>prolific athlete<br>so she was affected um so she moved up<br>and distanced the 5 000 metres and<br>unfortunately didn't qualify<br>um for south africa and we had another<br>couple of athletes who actually stepped<br>down in distance to the 200 metres um<br>and one of one of those athletes uh won<br>the silver medal for namibia which was<br>an amazing achievement so um so yeah i<br>think<br>um<br>yeah they're doing the best they can um<br>i'm not sure of any new zealand examples<br>but yeah those are international rules<br>um<br>new zealand athletes new zealand has a<br>different policy or yeah that world<br>athletics applies to national and<br>international competitions<br>um<br>yeah they're doing the best i think that<br>they could that they can they can be<br>doing yeah<br>yeah<br>how about you amanda i mean we<br>we all know sophie pascoe uh what are<br>the pressures<br>you know from the female perspective<br>from a power athlete perspective<br>that<br>just<br>you know<br>would would be incredibly daunting for a<br>from sophie's perspective<br>yeah i just but<br>she's been doing this this is her this<br>is her life she's been focused and that<br>that is all she is like that is<br>her gift to the gift to new zealand<br>really um but what you know what some of<br>the stuff that's been difficult it's<br>only two years ago that that actually um<br>paralympic athletes get paid the same as<br>able-bodied<br>athletes so you're like you're telling<br>me so we have more barriers<br>and more<br>um difficulty accessing everything and<br>yet we don't get paid as much<br>uh as a gold winning olympian as as our<br>able-bodied counterparts and you just so<br>stuff like that is<br>is that the things that i find difficult<br>around disability and just sort of even<br>bouncing back to what holly was speaking<br>about is um you know the fact that you<br>don't have female coaches or so many<br>female coaches and and so in the<br>disability world<br>most of our coaches are able body<br>coaches and it's not to say that what<br>they bring to the party isn't fabulous<br>but i imagine if you could actually<br>support and grow disabled athletes<br>who then come on to be coaches what gift<br>they would pass on to the young athletes<br>that they're working with that lived<br>experience that you can't know from just<br>watching<br>so you know um yeah that's<br>yeah um<br>yeah what do you think amy<br>you know the female coaches how<br>welcoming it is for them is there any<br>trends here what can we do<br>i think we're definitely seeing less<br>female coaches particularly in that high<br>performance environment we've been<br>looking at that um it's put waikato in<br>terms of<br>pretty high performance and then<br>obviously high performance as well and<br>and then even in that that community<br>sports space we're seeing fundamentally<br>a lack of coaches because of the way<br>that sport kind of progresses from<br>facilitation<br>at the young age with kids and just<br>facilitating play to that hyper<br>competitive model which often kicks in<br>at secondary school and women will<br>probably probably be the first people to<br>say i can't do that i don't have the<br>ability i don't have the technical and<br>tactical skills to coach a team<br>so how do we support them to<br>feel confident in that space and how do<br>we also shift particularly at the<br>participation level sport to not be only<br>about performance and be about<br>participation and how do we facilitate<br>opportunities particularly for children<br>to just be able to play and move and<br>then by doing that we're probably<br>actually creating opportunities for<br>people and and potentially women to feel<br>confident in that space and to step into<br>it and and not worry so much about<br>having to be the best coach but having<br>to be the best<br>role model or best facilitator of a<br>positive experience for a young person<br>and i think that's fundamentally<br>something that we need to remember we<br>need to be delivering to<br>what people want out of physical<br>activity not what we think that they<br>want and if we do that if we use the<br>voices of the participant regardless of<br>gender um<br>regardless of ability just the people<br>that we're working with if we understand<br>what they want to experience and we can<br>deliver to that we're going to have far<br>more success in terms of growing<br>participation at the physical<br>participation level like a player but<br>also coaching you know people will feel<br>confident to step into that space<br>because they know that all they have to<br>do is<br>is help people move in a way that makes<br>them feel good rather than getting<br>trophies or you know winning titles i<br>think that's something that we really<br>need to remember if we're going to grow<br>participation in sport<br>yeah<br>are you are you touching on there<br>uh some of what the campaign uh this is<br>me<br>is about so tell i'm interested to learn<br>more about this as well as other things<br>happening around the country but let's<br>start with with you amy on this so<br>this is me campaign tell us what it is<br>uh and briefly you know some of the<br>things it's done<br>yeah so this is me was something that's<br>bought waikato developed in in 2017 so<br>it was developed before any government<br>focus on women and girls it was pretty<br>early in the piece where we recognized<br>that that women and girls face uh<br>varied and complex participation<br>barriers and that they weren't having<br>positive experiences in sport and<br>physical activity so we recognized the<br>need to change and we recognized a need<br>to work at that top down in bottom up<br>level so we developed um probably more<br>of an initiative than a campaign<br>around supporting encouraging and<br>celebrating women and girls<br>participating in physical activity<br>however that needs to look for them so<br>it was about more than just sport<br>research at that point was telling us<br>that women and girls weren't<br>particularly interested in the current<br>sporting model that was operating and<br>they were shying away from it probably<br>more interested in active recreation<br>because sport wasn't meeting their needs<br>so we recognized that we needed to<br>to help them engage in in physical<br>activity via active recreation if that's<br>what they wanted to do but but to change<br>the model of sport because we recognized<br>that they probably did want to<br>participate in in the broader sense of<br>sport just not how it looked currently<br>so we developed an initiative that works<br>at the level of the community into<br>schools and also into the regional<br>sports sector to help providers of sport<br>and physical activity understand what<br>they needed to do to better uh encourage<br>women and girls to participate and to<br>retain their participation<br>so it's about looking at the needs and<br>wants of women and girls so things like<br>you know that prioritization of social<br>connection competition still being<br>important but you know competition in<br>the way that women and girls want to<br>experience it<br>and tailoring offerings to meet their<br>needs so we've worked with northern<br>districts cricket to<br>create a new brand of cricket which is<br>more like backyard cricket no fast<br>bowlers no long days in the field<br>um<br>it just stripping cricket back to the<br>essence of what it was we saw women<br>wanting to give it a go<br>but the current model of cricket was<br>really intimidating for them and they<br>didn't feel like there was an entry<br>point um you know a woman in her 30s<br>didn't feel like she could take up<br>cricket because of of the product that<br>it looked like at the time so we worked<br>with northern districts to say hey how<br>could cricket look different and we've<br>had over a thousand women and girls<br>participate in the new brand of cricket<br>that we've um instigated with them and<br>that's been in our own region in the<br>waikato but also in northland and the<br>bay of plenty as well so<br>you know that's one example another<br>example has been<br>tackling period poverty in the king<br>country where young women were<br>wanting to be physically active but<br>didn't have the resource or knowledge to<br>to manage their bodies while they were<br>menstruating so we recognized that this<br>was a significant barrier and we<br>partnered with the national organization<br>our to give them sustainable period<br>resources so that they could<br>you know participate still during that<br>time of their life so<br>those are a couple of examples of the<br>bottom-up approach and then top-down we<br>recognize that we can't be encouraging<br>women and girls in our own context to be<br>active and telling them that it's great<br>for them and it's okay<br>if the messages that are exposed to in<br>the national context whether that's<br>social media or mainstream media are<br>telling them that sport and physical<br>activity aren't for them or that they<br>don't belong<br>so we've used social media to<br>encourage women and girls to celebrate<br>the ways that they get active and kind<br>of i guess fill that gap that we see<br>between the high performance athlete<br>female athlete which is um you know<br>great that they're experiencing more<br>coverage and we see them more regularly<br>but then we've also got on instagram for<br>example the fitness model that we see<br>which is giving people messages about<br>what it means to be active and what your<br>body should look like if and when you<br>are active<br>what we don't often see is the real<br>woman or girl being physically active<br>you know what for example i look like<br>when i'm physically active that's<br>sometimes missing from the story so we<br>recognized as that as a gap and saw a<br>real need to actually start telling that<br>story you know the everyday woman being<br>active looks and feels like this and<br>they have these struggles and they<br>overcome them in these ways and<br>by doing that we've seen i guess<br>confidence grow from women and girls<br>that they can actually do this and it<br>can meet their needs and we've seen<br>changes in delivery in our region to<br>make sure that what's on offer is<br>actually meeting the needs of females<br>yeah<br>yeah thank you thanks very much for that<br>amy um and what i love is also that<br>you're able to help us celebrate where<br>it's working well<br>uh in some of those initiatives and and<br>with northern districts and so on um<br>it it can't be the only thing that's<br>happening around the country though<br>there we know that there must be other<br>initiatives campaigns pockets um where<br>good stuff is is happening holly you<br>talked about some of these things uh<br>earlier as well<br>uh and i understand<br>uh that that you've been supporting or<br>involved in in summers as well<br>so is it it's my move can you just<br>briefly just give me a bit of an<br>overview of that as well holly<br>yeah it's my move obviously um i think<br>it took a bit of inspiration from the<br>sport white kind of model actually but<br>we've seen that other initiatives like<br>it around the world but i do think it's<br>um it's been long overdue the research<br>has been saying this for decades<br>actually that girls and women are<br>you know moving away from competitive<br>organized sport picking up<br>you know recreational physical<br>activities um<br>lots of push and pull factors you know<br>away from organized competitive sport<br>for for women and girls as well um<br>but the it's my move campaign is is very<br>much targeted at the teenage girl um<br>because we know the drop-off rate is<br>really significant there with body image<br>issues we've got you know a whole lot<br>going on in that time in a young woman's<br>life um<br>you know schooling social group changes<br>um different types of social pressures<br>um<br>and so<br>yeah the whole the whole campaign is<br>really about you know increasing the<br>visibilities of of young girls who move<br>in a whole lot of different ways whether<br>it's you know tick-tock dance videos and<br>in their rooms with their mates or if<br>it's skateboarding in the you know down<br>the street or<br>walking the dog in the park actually<br>celebrates all types of movement for the<br>purposes of joy and pleasure and social<br>connection<br>so it's quite an important campaign and<br>um yeah i really like i really like what<br>it's doing actually<br>um<br>okay yeah thank you well there's a<br>there's a a message and lesson for us<br>all listening as well that there are two<br>uh we just heard from two<br>uh wonderful initiatives campaigns that<br>we should uh after this<br>panel uh jump online and and have a look<br>at uh<br>jamie i'd just say you know what's cool<br>what's great to see is the investment<br>that campaign has been significant<br>having a significant investment in time<br>and resourcing and now those messages<br>which are research informed um are going<br>out widely and they're going it has two<br>directions it's going to young girls<br>themselves and all the media and all the<br>products are designed for<br>meeting you know young girls<br>needs and then also at<br>you know parents and and those who are<br>pro but providers of sports so it has<br>shares two different<br>audiences which isn't really important<br>um but it's the investment it's the<br>backing it's the funding and supporting<br>women's sport and then we can say yeah<br>yeah women's thought you know getting<br>more money but actually<br>how many decades of undervaluing and<br>under investment have we had we've got a<br>long way to go of investing in women's<br>sport before we can even look at<br>catching up<br>yeah<br>well there was there was uh i think a<br>business uh academic that once said uh<br>the best time to plant a tree was 20<br>years ago the next best time is today uh<br>so um but you know amy um yeah amy and<br>holly thank you very much you know for<br>those and for all of us listening<br>definitely we need to jump online and<br>gain some inspiration and there are<br>tools and and other bits and pieces um<br>online that i've seen that we can we can<br>take<br>i mean we have covered a lot<br>what i'd love to do is to ensure that by<br>the time this<br>webinar is over<br>that everyone listening has had the<br>opportunity to take away some practical<br>tips or thoughts<br>insights that they can apply to whatever<br>their involvement is in your recreation<br>sport and i mentioned that i'm involved<br>in the administration the coaching and<br>so on i'm really keen to hear from<br>all of you before we wrap up on are<br>there any simple things that we can do<br>which haven't been uh covered so far<br>today so uh without putting you all on<br>the spot uh who should we jump to first<br>amanda you've got a nice big smile on<br>so<br>what are the takeaways from this<br>i<br>i think i just have to reiterate like we<br>we're a difficult population to reach<br>because<br>we represent like i said 24 of the<br>population but we're splattered out all<br>over the place and<br>getting disabled people to engage in<br>sport is really difficult because<br>most of the time the opportunity is just<br>unavailable and people are they just<br>no one reaches out and says hey look<br>we've got this tournament on but there's<br>a there's an accessible component to it<br>if you're interested because everyone<br>doesn't think that they should or could<br>or they don't know how so i think the<br>key thing for for all around new zealand<br>for all you they're gonna gonna be<br>putting on events and stuff is just<br>reach out<br>like i said to the helbergs and to the<br>paraffins look online find out who the<br>nearest disability provider is even just<br>ask questions around you know how do you<br>do sport and someone will put you on to<br>someone and just start to ask questions<br>about how to what can you do some simple<br>things that actually make this space<br>work for more than just abled bodies<br>because you know i mean gender is one<br>thing but disabilities and is a whole<br>other kettle of fish you know and and<br>even within that disability space you<br>know women are<br>represented down the line it's mostly<br>men that play so i just think i think<br>that's a really important message i just<br>want want people to be brave and and<br>reach out because they won't be turned<br>away and people are always willing to<br>share their knowledge if it means<br>greater inclusion<br>yeah<br>i know that this the theme for our<br>discussion today is is gender and the<br>female athlete but before we move on i<br>am just curious um to hear from you i<br>understand that from a central<br>government point of view uh the ministry<br>will be changing from a disability like<br>in terms of ministry of<br>disability<br>will there be a flow-on effect do you<br>think into how it influences sport<br>do you think<br>have you heard any rumors anything oh i<br>haven't it's just so new and there's<br>still a lot of talk around even the fact<br>that the person who's in charge of that<br>is able-bodied and you're not like i<br>don't i it's all just<br>it's all just kind of too high level but<br>at the moment the work that that even<br>like sport waikato and all the<br>researchers are doing and sport new<br>zealand like the fact that it's about<br>play it's about getting physical<br>literacy and about getting kids to<br>understand their bodies and getting and<br>getting organizations to just open up<br>the play aspect to kids with<br>disabilities it just it gives them<br>confidence so they're going to move on<br>they're going to be able to move through<br>life and and not and feel like in charge<br>of their bodies just like women like the<br>women that you've spoken about amy it's<br>that same thing with with being disabled<br>is owning who you are and knowing that<br>there are opportunities for you to use<br>your body in really active and fun ways<br>so i think that that's the key part of<br>this conversation it's just changing<br>perceptions of what bodies should look<br>like in sport and we all should be able<br>to do that such this is a human right<br>you know and it's so much fun we can't<br>all make we can't miss out<br>no we don't want to miss out well<br>speaking of missing out let's let's go<br>from<br>an athlete perspective um a couple of<br>things that you wish that could happen<br>uh or or a couple of practical things<br>that that the rest of us could think of<br>so mariah felicity mariah let's go let's<br>go to you<br>you know what are a couple of things<br>that you wish could happen or a piece of<br>advice for the rest of us<br>oh yeah i guess with my athletics new<br>zealand head on<br>if you're in<br>a deliverer a sport delivery you know<br>you're an nso rso rst<br>provide opportunities for female<br>females to um get involved and<br>upskilled you know provide female<br>leadership or<br>coach developer courses or officiating<br>courses for females and if you're a you<br>know if you're a parent or a volunteer<br>or just keen to to get into coaching or<br>something make the most of those<br>opportunities<br>um<br>because they are really cool<br>environments you'll learn so much and<br>have so much fun um i've been on a<br>couple of courses where they're um or<br>networking events with others other<br>females<br>in my field and it's awesome it's<br>awesome to have that support around you<br>so um yeah make the most of those and if<br>you're a deliverer um be proactive and<br>put them on because because they're<br>wanted um yeah<br>thanks thanks mariah felicity<br>what else yeah i guess<br>from both a player and a coach<br>perspective um<br>i personally found it really rewarding<br>um going back and giving back to<br>those secondary school and primary age<br>girls student students and actually<br>being a bit of a role model for them and<br>showing them that there is a pathway<br>and i would encourage a lot of athletes<br>to go to go back and and<br>and yeah encourage that next generation<br>coming through um and it's really cool<br>to see that there is a lot of that going<br>on out there<br>at the moment with<br>international athletes going into<br>schools and um inspiring um the next<br>bunch of girls and<br>um<br>yeah from a coach perspective just um if<br>those um regional bodies can keep<br>providing<br>up-skilling opportunities to females to<br>get them involved as coaches as managers<br>and<br>yeah simply as those<br>role model<br>people to<br>to the girls and your teams and getting<br>as many females involved as possible<br>really but really supporting them on<br>whatever path they're in<br>yeah helping athletes be the best they<br>can be whatever their<br>goals are you know i really like that<br>amy any any final thoughts from you<br>yeah look i think this is really<br>important i um<br>i think one of the things to remember is<br>that involving women and girls in<br>physical activity and in sport and<br>whatever the offering is is is one of<br>the single best ways we can grow what<br>we're doing that's 50 of the population<br>so for me it's kind of a no-brainer that<br>if you're wanting to grow your<br>participation base or<br>even your revenue in terms of your<br>memberships if you're actually offering<br>something that's meeting the needs of<br>the 50 of the population who probably it<br>isn't currently then you're doing pretty<br>well<br>it's also important to remember that you<br>need to deliver to or coach the person<br>you need to understand what they want<br>and deliver to that and not make<br>assumptions around thinking that you<br>know what people want so<br>collecting the voice of your participant<br>understanding from them what it is they<br>want to experience or that they need to<br>experience to feel that they belong to<br>feel included to feel valued is really<br>important<br>and often that can change quite often<br>you know you have to keep asking for<br>that feedback if we keep doing what<br>we've always done we're always going to<br>get what we've always got which is<br>pretty inequitable system and it's<br>literally the definition of insanity to<br>keep going the way that we're going so<br>we do need to change and we do need to<br>not be afraid to do things differently<br>just because things have always been<br>done the way that they've been done<br>doesn't mean they have to continue to be<br>that way so we need to remember that<br>experience is made up of a range of<br>different things it's not only the<br>spaces and places that people get<br>involved but it's it's the people it's<br>how you welcome people how you make them<br>feel it's around the convenience and<br>timings of things it's around the<br>requirements that you have of people to<br>participate if all of those things<br>aren't working for the participant and<br>if we're thinking about women and girls<br>there are a whole range of different<br>ways that some of those things might not<br>work then we're not going to get<br>participation and we're not going to be<br>offering something that meets needs so<br>it's a complex challenge but there are a<br>range of things that we should and could<br>do<br>to make sure that people can access the<br>opportunities that they definitely want<br>to do research says that there's<br>appetite to participate so what we have<br>is not a demand problem it's a supply<br>problem<br>yeah and you've already shared with us<br>this evening uh<br>examples where it is possible and that<br>it can be and it can be done<br>uh<br>finally holly<br>yeah i think um you know i'm a<br>researcher and an educator so i would um<br>encourage people whether they're parents<br>or providers or coaches or managers<br>they're an amazing there are amazing<br>resources out there um created for you<br>to educate yourself um and i'm going to<br>give you two examples that i've been<br>lucky enough to be involved in over the<br>last few years<br>one of those is a sport new zealand<br>report<br>that was led by dr nita ahmed amy martha<br>was on it with myself and justin<br>richards it's titled building cultural<br>inclusion and active recreation in sport<br>insights from muslim women so we hear<br>from in this report lots of different<br>muslim women across the country<br>about their experiences um and<br>recreational and and high level sport<br>and<br>um lots of learnings from providers as<br>well and i think there's some<br>some good tips in there in terms of<br>reflections and things that we can do<br>better in the sector because we are an<br>increasingly multicultural society and<br>you know the needs of uh maori or<br>pacifica or asian or muslim girls and<br>women that are intersecting with gender<br>as well as culture and sometimes<br>religion as well as class and ethnicity<br>you know all these things we need to<br>like amy mentioned earlier<br>it's complicated<br>so there are resources out there it's<br>written for um the general public so you<br>know hopefully something like that is<br>useful<br>um another resource um this is more at<br>the elite level um<br>is uh high performance sport new zealand<br>i'm part of the whisper group which is<br>healthy women and sport performance<br>advantage and we've been working<br>together it's led by dr bruce hamilton<br>who's the medical lead for high point<br>sport<br>we also have a lot of other sports<br>doctors and sports scientists and<br>psychologists and nutritionists and i'm<br>the only sociologist on there but on the<br>whisper website which is on iphone sport<br>new zealand website um there's a lot of<br>educational resources that we put a lot<br>of time into creating short videos and<br>documents that are very much for coaches<br>and for parents and for athletes and so<br>those resources are all up there whether<br>it's around you know healthy nutrition<br>or dealing with social media and body<br>image or how to build a healthy<br>environment for your young sports women<br>there's resources out there and and we<br>can all educate ourselves um<br>uh just by you know little things like<br>reading and listening and and and<br>watching<br>um it's fantastic that you were able to<br>refer to the<br>the resources uh those of us listening<br>may have been trying to scribble or<br>remember<br>a couple of those things<br>the high performance sport one people<br>will know where to go to<br>building cultural inclusion that you<br>mentioned can you just very quickly say<br>where people can find that if they were<br>wanting to track it down yeah that's on<br>this uh<br>sport new zealand website<br>so it's just a near resources section<br>there titled building cultural inclusion<br>and active recreation and sport<br>and<br>the pdfs in there and there are a bunch<br>of different um stories that came<br>alongside that working with the locker<br>room etc about you know muslim girls and<br>women in sport<br>so um there's lots of great resources<br>available<br>no that's fantastic thank you very much<br>uh well uh folks out there<br>our time has unfortunately come to an<br>end we<br>we started our discussion uh admitting<br>that the topic was incredibly broad<br>complex uh we've had a crack at it<br>though uh some of the things i've been<br>scribbling notes down uh we've sort of<br>talked about<br>the fundamental operating model of sport<br>and recreation uh covering things from<br>structure to<br>uh pathways uh looking at delivering<br>sport or recreation um absolutely to the<br>person from their perspective amy's<br>covered off so much<br>we've heard real examples from the<br>perspective of students from coaches<br>felicity mariah thank you very much uh<br>the additional thoughts from you amanda<br>thank you very much and and obviously<br>the research that all of you have really<br>been involved in um but holly you've<br>you've discussed this<br>promotion uh the pathways of of athletes<br>uh and also<br>uh those of us who are involved in the<br>administration i think you've um you've<br>put a bit of pressure on us but everyone<br>listening i suspect already has a sense<br>of urgency to want to do something<br>uh so<br>my name's jamie i have been absolutely<br>uh<br>sort of overwhelmed with your experience<br>our wonderful panelists amanda felicity<br>uh holly mariah amy thank you very much<br>for your contribution<br>uh for all of you out there this will be<br>recorded and available uh to you uh the<br>at your fingertips series uh this isn't<br>the only one so make sure you track down<br>some of the others i've enjoyed watching<br>some of the previous ones uh what i<br>might just do is finish with a very<br>short uh kadakia<br>but we wish you all the very best in<br>your own pursuits and
