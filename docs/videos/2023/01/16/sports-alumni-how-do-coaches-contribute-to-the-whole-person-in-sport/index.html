accurate.</p><p>hmm<br>so<br>so<br>so<br>right<br>good<br>welcome to this university of waikato<br>run<br>around the role coaches play in<br>developing the whole person<br>we've got a really esteemed panel ready<br>to contribute to<br>their views on the role<br>coaches play and<br>developing the whole person and i argue<br>we've got them here because they come<br>from a really humanistic perspective<br>that's not solely about winning at all<br>costs<br>before we get started i'd like to<br>acknowledge that takahutu maxwell who<br>was supposed to be with us tonight has<br>been unable to join the panel but i just<br>want to note that we will loop him back<br>into our conversation later in the year<br>anyhow um we're not going to kick off<br>with a round of introductions we haven't<br>got time for that but i take it but most<br>of you would have either know these<br>people or read about their profiles and<br>other places<br>so we're going to kick straight to them<br>and i'm going to um get them all to<br>answer the question about<br>what do you see your the role as the of<br>the coach um<br>is what is the role of coach when<br>they're working with a team an<br>individual or group and i'm going to<br>throw straight to you um amy jane<br>actually to kick us off<br>yeah counter tattoo um thanks kirsten<br>um i think uh for me primarily it's<br>bringing out the strengths of the<br>individual and then collectively as the<br>group on a very simple<br>um basis<br>people generally want to feel like<br>there's something to contribute<br>they want to understand what their role<br>is within a a group into in their place<br>and<br>i think when they have that then they<br>know how they can contribute in the best<br>way possible<br>in a team sense it's obviously bringing<br>everyone together<br>getting them working in the same<br>direction<br>um and i think uh what i found at the<br>high performance level particularly is<br>sometimes that's that's the hard thing<br>as to is to get them all working<br>together because you've got a group of<br>really driven competitive people um and<br>then and sometimes their roles change<br>once they hit that high performance<br>environment so finding what their<br>strengths are acknowledging what their<br>strengths are identifying those and and<br>knowing how to contribute contribute<br>those best to the team um is important<br>and i think the last thing for me is<br>that regardless of level or ability of<br>where you're performing at um generally<br>you want there to be more positive<br>experiences than not<br>yeah thanks that um<br>flying through shane and then wayne and<br>then sean<br>i would have liked to have started i<br>think um no i agree with all of that and<br>and how i see um coaching uh for me is<br>it's<br>it's it changes um and uh changes in a<br>couple of ways it changes as your<br>athlete starts to grow so i think that<br>often you bring an athlete into a<br>program<br>and how you are as a coach differs from<br>when they exit a program and i think<br>that you know that guide through their<br>career is really important and for you<br>to be able to be a good guide you need<br>to understand definitely incredibly well<br>and so a lot of the things that you do<br>with your alignment of getting your mom<br>working the same line<br>comes down to understanding that person<br>that stands in front of you um<br>you know and so i think you know that's<br>why<br>good coaching and coaching teams is is<br>incredibly rewarding because of that<br>dynamics<br>and those uh different needs<br>yeah for me um shane i love that saying<br>of um exit better than when they came in<br>because i've always been clear that<br>that's been my role as a coach<br>i understood pretty early as a player<br>that people will rise to a challenge of<br>the sea challenge<br>they won't necessarily rise to my<br>challenge or any other coaches or any<br>other person's challenge<br>so that's always been a secret for me as<br>is working on that empowerment on<br>players having a voice<br>you know i once heard<br>muhammad ali<br>speak at harvard and he got up on stage<br>and he said me we then went and sat down<br>the shortest poem in history<br>but to me that sums up a lot of<br>what teams are about<br>you know the me part for me and the in<br>the all blacks um<br>when i was a player you're expected<br>every day to get up and try and be the<br>best in the world and that was<br>responsibility that you had on you<br>for myself i knew i wasn't going to be a<br>great player<br>pretty early on<br>but i had this desire to be in great<br>teams and i knew that i could be a cog<br>in that team and<br>and do everything i could to help that<br>team perform and that was the us part or<br>the wee part of<br>of that for me so i use that a lot in my<br>coaching and i talk about that<br>um<br>and you know anyone can follow the hob<br>habits for the best in the world you<br>don't have to be a greater the game or<br>the best in the world to do that they're<br>free<br>um so<br>having that as a skill or an attribute<br>cool well um yeah i think most of it's<br>sort of already been summed up but um<br>from my perspective as as sort of from<br>an athlete's perspective<br>the best sort of<br>coaches or the ones that have<br>helped me the most are the ones that can<br>really read people and read teams<br>and i come from a rowing background<br>where getting sort of team alignment is<br>one of the most important things um<br>that you could that you would ever need<br>in a in a men's eight which is the crew<br>that i wrote in and so that's where the<br>role of the coach comes in for me is<br>that they are the facilitator the<br>motivator the leader and the person that<br>aligns all the efforts and so<br>yeah a lot of things go into it but um<br>mainly it's it's around building um a<br>team that is has the chemistry to to do<br>well and everyone within that team<br>believes in themselves believes in their<br>own ability and in the team's ability<br>what interests me about the comments<br>that you've all made is that<br>not many of you have talked about the<br>technical or the tactical and often as<br>coaches<br>we see coaches focus on technical skills<br>tactical skills for winning games so one<br>i'm really interested to know about um<br>aside from that or where you place<br>technical and tactical alongside other<br>knowledge skills or attributes you<br>really think we should be developing<br>what are the priorities<br>um yeah it's a good question<br>i've been coaching since 1986 and<br>so in my experience sustained success<br>has come from an emotional place<br>more than<br>um<br>the technical or tactical space and when<br>you talk to coaches about that about<br>working on identity<br>um creating a vision driven values-based<br>culture<br>they like the idea<br>preseason but are too busy normally<br>teaching the<br>skills and the tactics to put the other<br>stuff in place because i think it should<br>be around the other way<br>um you know not feeling that you belong<br>to a team<br>is an inhibitor to success so it doesn't<br>matter how good a coach you are you're<br>not going to get success unless<br>um those people have you know what owen<br>eastwood calls it sense of belonging in<br>that sense of us<br>um so creating a<br>an identity<br>um<br>knowing you know<br>who you are where you've come from your<br>whakapapa papa the team how you<br>honor them<br>how you<br>how you leave a legacy is really<br>important<br>and also<br>how you can be unique as a team um you<br>know you can see behind me<br>an old photo that's um caberco steelers<br>in japan 94 years old team that<br>i've been involved with for a few years<br>um<br>that's<br>it's created a sense of legacy for us<br>in the all blacks we don't use the<br>normal language of<br>rugby for example um so when i was coach<br>of defence<br>i don't like the word defence to me it's<br>a negative word so<br>i really liked uh watching williapiata<br>in his interview after he got his as um<br>vc<br>and i showed that to the players where<br>he talked about he just<br>did what he did for his mates basically<br>and we felt that was a better term for<br>defense so we called defense widowman<br>and the all blacks so you don't have to<br>follow the head you um you can create<br>something really special and<br>um<br>i think that's way more important you<br>know that the technical stuff comes in<br>of course but um having that sense of<br>belonging it's huge and you're only<br>stewards of the whatever jersey you're<br>in for a short time and when you hand it<br>on<br>you need to try and hand it on in a<br>better state than when you got it<br>so i guess one of the challenges for any<br>coach though is<br>there's always performance expectations<br>and some of you whether we're working in<br>a school team with rangatahi or we're<br>working in high performance sometimes<br>your job's on the line and there's the<br>expectation around performance outcomes<br>so<br>amy jean and uh shane you've both been<br>working across both those all sorts of<br>those environments how do you balance<br>the desire for performance outcomes<br>alongside the development of the whole<br>person um like wayne's been talking<br>there you go shane<br>look it's it's one of those funny things<br>in life that if you focus on the right<br>things you get both you know um<br>and as wayne was saying<br>the<br>setting up a nice platform at the<br>beginning of year and uh working out<br>look what what does success look like<br>for us<br>and um they'll obviously be the winning<br>of the tournament things like that but a<br>lot of athletes will come up with a you<br>know i really want to enjoy it i want to<br>participate i want to play a lot of the<br>games and and so on now<br>i think that a lot of the kpis of of<br>coaches and those type of<br>arenas needs to be aligned with what you<br>actually want to achieve you want<br>athletes to have um<br>a lifelong love of the game and and<br>learn the skills that are going to<br>better equip them even if they move out<br>of the game you know and success is not<br>winning tournaments it's does that<br>player go on and and play the next<br>season and then<br>go on and do greater things with all the<br>skills i've learned so so i think you<br>know investing early and creating that<br>culture um that<br>um that togetherness and that<br>setting uh<br>you know setting<br>goals collectively<br>allows you to start to move into the<br>technical stuff that that aligns with<br>that and very quickly you find that you<br>you get a lot of momentum and um your<br>teams become successful for two reasons<br>one is because uh fantastic teams and<br>and great people working together and<br>the second is as you the byproduct of<br>that is you get good results<br>not the other way around you you know if<br>you work too much on the technical and<br>tactical<br>and neglect the other you you've got a<br>limitation but collectively you can you<br>can achieve fantastic things<br>yeah i totally agree shane and um<br>and it goes back to what wayne's already<br>talked about as well and i think for me<br>um a couple of things which have already<br>been said but you know clarity about<br>where you want to where the team wants<br>to go where the athletes want to go i<br>think um you know if you all know where<br>you're heading and you all agree to that<br>you've all bought into that that journey<br>um then<br>there's no surprises the expectations<br>are clear and you can then define what<br>sort of behaviours and and what sort of<br>um i guess the values that surround that<br>team that are going to help you get<br>there and by establishing those early<br>everybody sort of finds their role and<br>how they contribute<br>and<br>um and what they bring<br>on and on on and off the field or the<br>court or the playing arena so i think<br>yeah so they're setting those um and<br>sometimes it comes from the legacy<br>sometimes it does come you know when<br>you've got a well-established team<br>sometimes those<br>those values are really entrenched and<br>they're really clear and the leadership<br>group will continue to drive those year<br>after year um but in each year or at<br>each season or each campaign you may<br>have slightly different<br>vision or or outcome that you want to<br>achieve and that again can be set by the<br>players<br>but yeah i think if there's clarity<br>around where you're going and how you're<br>going to get there then agree um sounds<br>a bit cliche but the results will look<br>after themselves they'll be what they<br>they'll be what they are and um and<br>inevitably they will be successful<br>yeah so we talk about success<br>and interesting ways and shane you just<br>talked about success about success<br>beyond sport and in life beyond sport<br>but we also experience success in<br>winning medals or winning tournaments or<br>whatever so<br>where have you seen um<br>sean maybe you can think about your<br>experience with the rowers more recently<br>and won in gold at olympics and<br>how did a people-centered kind of<br>approach contribute to that or was it<br>just that you threat yourself<br>yeah no it was um i suppose i have a bit<br>of a interesting perspective on this one<br>because um i've certainly been involved<br>in programs within rowing which have<br>been very<br>person-centered and focused which is uh<br>what we saw in tokyo and i've also been<br>on the other end of that which is very<br>performance centered um<br>and i can attribute those to two coaches<br>in particular so tony o'connor who<br>coached us at uh the tokyo olympics<br>where we won gold um he was much more of<br>a person-centered<br>approach and then in my earlier days<br>where<br>we got a decent amount of success i was<br>coached by a guy named ian wright who<br>was it was more of the the old school<br>hard ass that um was more about<br>performance over everything else and um<br>the interesting thing was is that i<br>i believed in both of those performances<br>are both of those sort of models of of<br>the way he coached and uh the way both<br>of the coaches coached and um<br>the thing that they did both coaches is<br>they built a culture around the way they<br>were doing<br>the way that we were doing our work and<br>the way we were going about it uh<br>but the key difference for me is that<br>the the person-centered approach which<br>worked for us really well um took a lot<br>of time to build um and to build a coach<br>to build a culture um<br>that person-centered approach that<br>worked in tokyo is far more sustainable<br>long-term um<br>than the pure performance-centered<br>approach and so<br>what i mean by that is that i think that<br>there's<br>more<br>scope for athletes to burn out earlier<br>when it's purely performance focused and<br>from there whether you i think tony put<br>it in a really good in a really good way<br>he wanted to build really good athletes<br>but he also wanted to build really good<br>people um and so that was his sort of um<br>that's what he wanted to leave behind in<br>the sport is really accomplished people<br>as well as athletes uh where if you go<br>too far down the performance line you<br>might end up as a really accomplished<br>athlete but then but then what are you<br>beyond that you might burn out when<br>you're mid 20 and mid 20s and things<br>always look back and wonder whether you<br>could have kept on going if there was a<br>little bit more balance in the program<br>and so<br>yeah i think that there's um<br>sort of a balance in general that needs<br>to be um<br>sort of established between person<br>focused and the performance focus<br>because coming from an elite sport<br>background<br>at the end of the day is for us about<br>winning about winning medals<br>so why not i'm interested to see then<br>how you see<br>yourself uh how you'd how you would<br>think about being successful how do you<br>measure your success as a coach then is<br>it about the um middle of winning the<br>tournament or is it about the<br>development of the person<br>how what success<br>yeah um i've probably got a different<br>way of looking at success<br>than others you know don't get me wrong<br>winning is important and when you're a<br>crusaders coach or all blacks coach or a<br>chiefs coach or whatever<br>you're in high performance sport and so<br>your accomplishment<br>really counts<br>however<br>one of the ways i mean like your<br>trophies<br>sit in the garage and they tarnish over<br>time but how are your relationships do<br>they tarnish<br>how are you going with the with the<br>people that you coached<br>years after you've you've coached them<br>you know i think that's one of the<br>measures i like to use<br>um as a high performance coach you're<br>always on that<br>there's always that<br>narrow margin between<br>been honest with the player and been<br>seen as a<br>bully and and<br>you know some of the conversations<br>you have with players can be life<br>changing for them<br>um<br>but you have to create that i think<br>you've got to create that relationship<br>with them that they they know that you<br>truly care that you you love them they<br>come and start your place you have a<br>meal you place whenever they want<br>and then you can i think you can<br>have that honesty and sometimes it's<br>brutal honesty and it's it's not taking<br>that well at the time but i think if<br>you've spent time creating a<br>relationship you'll um<br>over time you'll you'll get a good<br>result<br>yeah so and i'm just going to mix things<br>up for you a lot sorry um so it raises<br>an interesting question about what sort<br>of behaviours then are acceptable of<br>coaches and what aren't<br>um so sean you might take it from an<br>athlete perspective what's acceptable<br>and what wouldn't you expect<br>but excellent<br>others are equally chipping<br>yeah i mean that's a pretty that's a<br>pretty broad question uh but<br>yeah i think there's definitely been a<br>shift in focus on on<br>the well-being of the athlete um and so<br>wayne's already sort of mentioned it um<br>as sort of<br>the relationship the coach builds with<br>the athlete needs to trick that fine<br>line between being um you're being a<br>friend to the athlete but you're also<br>being<br>the task master where you're setting the<br>standard you're you're you have to tell<br>the truth and so that's something that<br>um i expect um and i believe is fully<br>acceptable for a coach is to be fully<br>transparent<br>to athletes and obviously delivering<br>information and whatever's the truth and<br>a very um<br>careful way because again they've got to<br>read the person and some people take on<br>information or take on criticism in<br>different ways but<br>at the end of the day i think full<br>transparency with um<br>no favorites<br>in a team is is a really fair way<br>of doing things um<br>and<br>yeah<br>particularly from high performance sport<br>perspective<br>that all has to be achieved while not<br>compromising the<br>person's well-being<br>i think um that's a key point sean<br>actually around<br>um<br>the the athlete and and<br>who they are where they're at and their<br>i guess their playing career their level<br>of maturity the support systems got<br>around them the relationship you have<br>with them because as mine said for some<br>you've got a really strong relationship<br>built over a number of years and and<br>probably the level of<br>honest conversation can be a lot deeper<br>um as opposed to a player that you you<br>don't quite have that built with um so<br>yeah i think<br>it does come back to knowing your<br>players and<br>definitely have not got that right all<br>the time but um you know it i'd rather<br>than saying there's a there's a line<br>that<br>works for everybody i think the line<br>does shift although the conversations do<br>shift depending on the athlete<br>yeah i mean that sums it up really well<br>and it comes down to the trust you build<br>between coach and athlete and and that's<br>the good telling of a good relationship<br>is that they can speak to you in a way<br>that really resonates um<br>and so like for me personally i'll be<br>the first to admit that i was always one<br>that needed the<br>the pat on the back being told that i'm<br>doing a good job the positive<br>reassurance where other athletes would<br>need they respond better to<br>uh harder critiques and um it's yeah<br>it's different for everyone and that's<br>something that obviously the coach has<br>to work out<br>i um if i could just come in there i<br>started my um coaching career in italy<br>as a player coach so i went over there<br>not knowing the language um went to a<br>little town<br>that didn't there's no one in the town<br>who spoke english so<br>it sort of um stared me in a unique<br>way or a week unique methodology at the<br>time for rugby coaching and so there<br>were a couple of things that<br>characterized that first thing was i<br>started asking questions of the players<br>because i wanted to know what they knew<br>about the game<br>and<br>at the same time i wanted to start<br>learning the language so um<br>it worked in two areas and what i found<br>was that by asking what questions i'd<br>get a descriptive answer and then i then<br>i um<br>i really knew that the players had a bit<br>more self-awareness than if i was just<br>telling them what to do and it was going<br>to one year out the other<br>so that was one thing the second thing<br>was i was<br>exposed to a<br>more global<br>methodology of coaching so a more<br>game-based<br>um learning program than that i've been<br>through in new zealand and what i found<br>with that is um<br>that whilst there are you know some<br>people don't like the game based or game<br>sense stuff because there's always a lot<br>of mistakes in it but i found that if<br>you're introducing new ideas and you're<br>making it more difficult constantly<br>then the mistakes are actually catalyst<br>for learning and so there are a couple<br>of things that really work well for me<br>in italy um when i came back here um<br>people thought i was<br>wacky<br>um didn't fit the mold of a<br>of a<br>high performance rugby coach certainly<br>in the late 80s<br>um my reinforcement now would be um<br>seeing a lot of those methods as as a<br>norm today<br>so that's probably measure for me more<br>shane i don't want you to feel like<br>you're missing out on an opportunity to<br>respond<br>but i feel like you're frozen<br>thank you okay we we're gonna leave<br>shane for a minute um i guess all those<br>things then that we've talked about as<br>you as coaches um i'd be interested to<br>hear amy jane um what's the most<br>challenging what's some of the<br>challenges for you and your role as a<br>coach<br>um i think for me the biggest challenge<br>no matter what team i was coaching was<br>just balancing coaching with family life<br>um<br>i don't know i don't know if it's<br>different from males and females but<br>i've<br>i probably a lot of my coaching was done<br>as a mum<br>and so<br>coaching is one of those things you put<br>your whole heart soul and energy into<br>and to have um enough left i guess for<br>your family which was important to me um<br>was a constant juggling act and<br>um<br>yeah i mean you adopt this whole other<br>other family when you become a coach<br>and you need to make every one of those<br>people feel important and special and<br>that you care and then you go home and<br>you i guess your most important family<br>still needs that as well and if you have<br>a bad day at the office or a bad day at<br>work um trying not to bring that home<br>and into the family life i think was was<br>probably one of the biggest um<br>challenges and just so grateful that my<br>family was very supportive and<br>understood all those things but i think<br>just<br>personally that was always something<br>that i grappled with<br>and and i think the demands on coaches<br>have got higher and higher as well so<br>that makes it even more challenging to<br>balance right<br>um<br>one from you<br>yeah um when i started coaching i<br>thought it was easy it was um rugby was<br>amateur<br>often you're the sole coach or you might<br>have an assistant coach helping you<br>i was lucky i<br>i<br>involved in the canterbury program<br>um gilberto nokia was a great motor<br>mindless was back in like<br>1887 88 89 and uh he and i coached<br>together<br>he provided a mental skills program back<br>there<br>but the challenge for me has<br>has always been<br>uh<br>nerves i think i've always put pressure<br>on myself when i was a player and a<br>coach when you're in front of the team<br>um<br>it's got to be the best you've ever been<br>in front of the team and when you train<br>it's got to be the best training ever<br>and i'm just driven to it's my makeup<br>i'm driven to be like that so um<br>i've often struggled with being the<br>little kid from pataru<br>being in a<br>in a um<br>in a famous famous team within world<br>rugby<br>um<br>never saw myself like that and so yeah<br>that's probably my biggest challenge<br>and one of your biggest strengths as<br>well because your humility stands you in<br>good stead and you should acknowledge<br>that at the same time and i think we<br>appreciate that um welcome back shane um<br>love the technology that works for us<br>all the time um i think<br>with that the whole challenges is um<br>shane you work in the unique environment<br>of belgium and in a different context<br>and i know why and you've done that<br>overseas but<br>how does a person send an approach like<br>you take a humanistic approach fit in<br>the international olympic level sort of<br>competition<br>if it fitted really well like you've got<br>a it's a little bit like wayne's story a<br>bit like a little new zealander in a<br>country um such as belgium where they<br>have two languages and quite a distinct<br>culture between those two languages and<br>and being a kiwi sitting in uh there you<br>get to see<br>some of the<br>opportunities that present itself that<br>um that they're blinded to you know and<br>we often talk about diversity and and um<br>and the use of uh different experiences<br>and so on and we had that within one<br>little country and um because i was<br>no good at speaking french and no good<br>at speaking flemish we were able to um<br>you know highlight those<br>as being incredible strengths you know<br>they have the ability to speak in the<br>language of the person that's standing<br>in front of them and that's a great<br>and they also have the same connection<br>or um same affinity that that i have<br>with new zealand and australia you know<br>it's kind of that that belgium and<br>holland as australia and new zealand the<br>bigger country and<br>and so all those type of connections are<br>not necessarily hockey connections but<br>the things that bring people closer<br>together<br>and so what i found was that it was a<br>team that was searching for um<br>more of a voice themselves and<br>the coaching that they had had in the<br>past had been very directive<br>and so they knew how to play the game<br>incredibly well a bit like what sean was<br>saying you know you can squeeze that<br>orange but it was um<br>what we were<br>uh trying to do with that particular<br>group was grow an orange orchard you<br>know and and and produce a lot of<br>players that<br>that would come through the program and<br>and now there's sustained success<br>because it's it's a bit of a conveyor<br>belt and they have an expectation that<br>when they come into the program<br>that they start to contribute and they<br>learn how to contribute it's it's not a<br>given that an athlete knows<br>how to um<br>to take themselves to places they've<br>never been and that's again that's about<br>what the coaches is trying to assist<br>them to do but at some point in time<br>they they get it they know<br>uh how they get in their performance<br>state they know all the things about<br>nutrition and things like that and at<br>that point in time<br>the the role of the coaches is as one of<br>your biggest supporters and your biggest<br>fans you know we we get<br>to watch from the greatest seats in the<br>in the whole stadium um right by the<br>field and love watching these type of<br>things so you know it's a it's a give<br>and take type of thing but<br>um the coaches<br>also are big winners and if they do a<br>good job<br>yeah and what about from you sean you've<br>already kind of talked about it on the<br>pause<br>i can hear you now<br>can you hear me now yeah okay<br>sorry about that um<br>yeah i um<br>it's an interesting one from from my<br>perspective um because obviously we see<br>we spend a lot of time as well as here<br>in new zealand training and trying to<br>build um<br>build what we're doing so we can can<br>compete overseas and the where sort of<br>person-centred approach comes in is that<br>it's built while we're in new zealand um<br>and it's we're trying to build<br>confidence in our individual sort of<br>ability and our team ability and a lot<br>of that is sort of led by the coach the<br>coach has sort of a objective view of<br>how things are going and how individuals<br>are going and often as new zealanders i<br>think we're traditionally quite hard on<br>ourselves and always think that<br>we're not good enough or a little bit of<br>that for me it was the imposter syndrome<br>of<br>what is what is it going to look like<br>when we get overseas and we actually<br>race um<br>internationally and then the thing i<br>noticed that was sort of different um<br>going over with the person-centered<br>approach is that we were pretty much<br>only worrying about what was within our<br>control while we were competing<br>while in previous years it was always<br>worried about competition it was always<br>worried about who we were coming up<br>against um<br>how strong these other countries were<br>how strong the individuals were what we<br>had seen on social media and then when<br>we brought it all back to sort of the<br>person-centered approach it became<br>really simple as to what we were doing<br>we had a<br>set plan each person had their set role<br>their set job to do<br>and that's all we focused on within the<br>team and um<br>yeah it was quite liberating in a lot of<br>ways that you end up just simplifying<br>down what you got to do and for us it<br>was all we had to do was was go fast in<br>the way we knew how<br>um and it was sort of yeah one way that<br>we could relate it back to how we sort<br>of<br>approached it from that um<br>from well tony's coaching perspective<br>and the team culture we built um<br>but yeah it came back to sort of making<br>it really simple and and person-centered<br>and team-centered other than being<br>distracted by<br>the many different things you can be<br>distracted by when you're overseas<br>racing at an elite level<br>yeah so we can talk about it in that<br>high performance elite international<br>level and um<br>what that looks like when you take a<br>person-centered approach and i go back<br>to your comment about growing the orange<br>orchard uh shane and<br>i'm really worried that we're trying to<br>squeeze the oranges before they've even<br>formed buds here in new zealand we have<br>a uh sports system around youth and<br>rangatahi that um you know sport new<br>zealand are really trying to address<br>through balance is better and we've got<br>this policy landscape that's changing<br>yet we still often see<br>uh coaches of rangatahi of youth<br>thrashing young people too early in my<br>view so<br>amy jane wayne and i'm sure shane you<br>tip into this as well what can we be<br>doing differently in that space so that<br>we<br>have more coaches working with rangatahi<br>that are focused on them as people<br>not as future all blacks future black<br>stars future silver ferns future<br>parkour champions<br>i love this topic<br>i love it like two minutes<br>um<br>at the heart of it it's what what do the<br>kids want what are the what do what are<br>their arangata what our tamariki want<br>from sport and really taking the time to<br>find that out and i think<br>we're moving in that direction trying to<br>trying to capture that voice and and<br>find out what they want i think there's<br>some really key players i think it is a<br>system<br>change um issue um key players um people<br>who organize youth sport<br>what do our competition structures look<br>like<br>how are they catering for the needs of<br>rangatahi tamariki<br>schools<br>what are our schools doing to ensure<br>that it's a person-centred approach and<br>that it is a growing the orchard<br>approach as opposed to squeezing the<br>orange<br>um i don't think a lot of our successful<br>school programs in terms of those that<br>win national titles and i don't think<br>there is that is a sustainable model for<br>those individual athletes um and and<br>what they potentially go on to do or not<br>do because of burnout or overloading<br>um i think coaches have a role to play<br>again you know that's why we're here but<br>um<br>if you just listen to this over and over<br>again this this this whole uh<br>presentation you'll hear the same words<br>you know participant centered player<br>centered<br>um<br>and i think the other thing for me is as<br>parents<br>and just allowing their children to<br>enjoy sport um for what it is not for<br>what it could be or where it could take<br>them and um the big lesson for me as a<br>parent i'll put my hand up and say i had<br>all the wrong conversations in the car<br>on the way home after matches<br>um<br>but i think<br>you know when when they're young there's<br>all these things these variables to<br>their performance<br>growth hormones<br>social distractions school and study<br>family life all these things that can<br>change the way they play from one week<br>to the other<br>so i think<br>expecting<br>that<br>rangatahi will go out there and try new<br>things feel good about doing<br>things<br>necessarily doing things right all the<br>time which sometimes we put those i mean<br>i look back at i look at what i did as<br>part of the magic<br>high performance environment and what's<br>happening in schools and some of these<br>um<br>are training harder more often<br>without the the managed risk breaks<br>without the um<br>you know the time between training<br>sessions that they're truly overloaded<br>even compared to high performance sports<br>so yeah it's a big system change um but<br>really has to be on development as<br>opposed to outcome<br>that's my spell<br>no<br>part of the two minute left because i<br>think um one of one of the things with<br>that is<br>um adaptation you know there's no<br>opportunity for a young athlete to<br>mentally and physically adapt it's like<br>the season starts and it is so<br>so full so quickly and you have an<br>athlete getting to the end of it and<br>thinking<br>i made it thank goodness it's over i can<br>do something else<br>and what we want is we want an athlete<br>that starts the season and is a much<br>better athlete at the end of the season<br>and much better person<br>uh but<br>wants to start the next season you know<br>because they want to see themselves<br>improving<br>and and for me that's one of the the<br>fundamental things that's that's not<br>operating at the moment<br>with a lot of the athletes it's a common<br>common concern as we go around the<br>country<br>i could just come in there i was um<br>director of coaching for canterbury<br>from 88 through to about 92 and uh let's<br>look after junior rugby on hagley park<br>any given saturday and you can imagine<br>that it was a massive park massive<br>number of fields<br>for rugby first thing i did was get<br>these sandwich boards made up with codes<br>of behaviour on them<br>but they weren't for the players for the<br>parents<br>and you know you learn pretty quickly<br>that um<br>winning isn't really important for the<br>kids or it certainly doesn't guarantee<br>satisfaction<br>and kids<br>you know i learned i learned to play my<br>game my sport<br>um doing black backyard rugby down there<br>down the street<br>no coaches<br>played bull rush<br>played different games and we learned<br>off each other<br>and then when i got into<br>a more organized team<br>you basically had parents and gum boots<br>running around telling you what to do so<br>i think the coaching movement's really<br>important in this area that um<br>new zealand rugby i think led the field<br>and coach education for for a large<br>number of years probably through the 70s<br>80s 90s people like laurie o'reilly who<br>ran courses<br>we had rdos in every<br>every small area every every province<br>had rdos who then had<br>a network of staff coaches that got<br>around schools<br>with teachers worked with west junior<br>coaches with kitchen um levels<br>courses run virtually every weekend<br>it was massive in that in that period<br>and we developed our young coaches on i<br>don't know if that<br>is how it is today<br>or whether we've taken our eye off the<br>board there but<br>certainly it's an area where we need<br>um<br>a lot of<br>a lot of money a lot of development put<br>into<br>and this is just a cooler it's not on<br>the list anybody but it does um<br>make me think about the profession<br>change to professionalism and sport and<br>the filtering down of adult forms of<br>sport into young people so you know it<br>concerns me that there's a rugby for<br>tots program and a not netball for tops<br>program where we can specialise in our<br>early childhood centre can take kids to<br>a rugby tournament it might be flags but<br>they're at a rugby tournament at that<br>level so that that drift down of<br>professionalism the<br>parents who are paying<br>um for<br>um individual coaching for their<br>eight-year-old so that they can make<br>that elite team by the time they're ten<br>how do we how do we arrest the system<br>what do we do what do we do differently<br>i think i can pick up on what wayne said<br>about his childhood and just playing<br>just playing<br>you know i think that's that's missing<br>allowing um<br>tamariki time to just play not in<br>anything structured not in anything<br>organized not any anything that requires<br>a timetable um and and you know that<br>means like at a certain age you're<br>obviously going to take part in the<br>competition but<br>the kids that love sport will still i<br>know there's lots to compete with you<br>know<br>esports and online distractions but<br>the ones that love it will still go out<br>and kick a ball around or throw a ball<br>around or or make up a game with their<br>mates in the street i think i think<br>cool so i should get us back on track<br>but um<br>i guess the thing about that is you have<br>all adopted or experienced in your case<br>shown a very uh uh player centred<br>athlete-centred people-centred approach<br>so if you were to be working with a<br>group of coaches or an individual coach<br>that you wanted to shift further down<br>that part into that part of the world or<br>that view of the world what would be one<br>thing you would you've tried and you've<br>used and you think would help get them<br>there<br>what would be a tip or an idea that they<br>could draw on or something they could<br>try with their team next week and the<br>weeks to come that might start moving<br>them there what would be your biggest<br>thing you'd change<br>yeah um<br>we've sort of i think we've sort of<br>touched on it um already but<br>i believe that you get more out of the<br>individual uh when you understand the<br>individual and you understand what<br>motivates them and i think wayne touched<br>on this is that uh i think some<br>give it more placing more weight on the<br>fact that there is some real importance<br>in learning the heritage and learning<br>the legacy learning the the reason why<br>we're doing this um<br>and so i think<br>the one message i would give to coaches<br>or<br>the one thing that i think that could<br>develop coaches is that um<br>yeah you you do think about those beyond<br>just the technical things that need to<br>happen for a team to be successful you<br>think about the big picture you think<br>about the culture you think about the<br>way the team works together and um we<br>have this really interesting thing at<br>new zealand um<br>it's called the pathway coaching um<br>system which is is relatively new for<br>royal new zealand um i think there's a<br>perception that<br>for to be sort of successful at the<br>elite level you have to just work hard<br>and and although that's very true it<br>does start somewhere else we're thinking<br>about why we're working hard and what's<br>the purpose of this and and we're trying<br>to develop the people first and so<br>the pathway system for coaches um allows<br>him to come into row new zealand and<br>actually sit with the other elite<br>coaches and sit with the teams and just<br>see how they're doing it and um<br>and i think that's a really important<br>thing in terms of um developing coaches<br>around the country is that they get some<br>exposure to how<br>uh the top like the national level teams<br>are<br>coaching how they're how they're<br>operating um and our coach<br>tony would even just every week he'd<br>bring out a new coach in the coach boat<br>um just so he they could get some<br>perspective on on the way we operate<br>that the words that we use and how it's<br>it's from the outside it's not just hard<br>work there's a lot it's focused on the<br>person um<br>yeah it's quite interesting because then<br>it was there's a lot of feedback given<br>from the other coaches that have come in<br>um<br>and so it was a really good useful tool<br>for tony as well because he got<br>perspectives from sort of both sides and<br>so<br>yeah i think that um i'm not sure if<br>that's really answered the question but<br>that that's something that i sort of<br>found was really valuable um as is<br>giving a little bit of perspective on on<br>the way we do things um and letting that<br>trickle down so it so we're not getting<br>athlete burn out at those younger stages<br>because<br>that's prevalent and rowing as well<br>where high school programs are almost as<br>hard as elite programs which is<br>insane<br>it's an interesting question i think<br>because some of the best coaches i've<br>ever seen in my life are junior coaches<br>you know there's a guy johnny bunyo and<br>traviso in italy who i went to schools<br>with<br>and he was he was extraordinary coach<br>and i just learned so much of him about<br>how not just how to deal with kids but<br>i think<br>as i said before that<br>the parents are really important for our<br>for our junior sport<br>and perhaps they need to be at the<br>courses<br>um you know and you know if you could<br>talk to parents and uh buying a pie for<br>for<br>their kid because he went up<br>over and beyond for the<br>for the team that week whether it was<br>turning up early to training or picking<br>up all the balls after training or<br>making more tackles than anyone else or<br>whatever it is rather than get a buy for<br>winning or scoring the most tries<br>yeah<br>but touching them i think is going to be<br>amy jane and shane do you want to chip<br>i think it's been covered off pretty<br>well actually yeah<br>i guess i would pick up on a couple of<br>points that were made earlier too that<br>you know i think you made the point<br>about um<br>good questioning<br>parent education<br>values all those things come into play<br>but um picking up on your point sean<br>if we want to take those things we<br>actually have to plan our coaching<br>we can't just rock up you know five<br>minutes before and throw a ball out or<br>um i hate that we're only talking about<br>ball sports really apart from you sean<br>but there are a whole range of other<br>sports out there so how do we plan in<br>ways that grow<br>a wider range of skill sets as opposed<br>to just come along and do drills every<br>time so planning i think would be key to<br>do it for me there too<br>yes<br>sorry i would say um that a lot of the<br>our um<br>our coaches<br>actually wouldn't identify as coaches<br>particularly in youth sport you know the<br>people who put their hands up because<br>nobody else will do it or because<br>they've got a child playing or they just<br>they love sport and so i i think<br>sometimes it's<br>it's redefining what a coach looks like<br>and um<br>and that it doesn't have to be somebody<br>who's played themselves or knows a lot<br>about the actual sport but really<br>encouraging those people to come forward<br>who are good at relationships and<br>enjoy working with<br>working within a sport regardless of<br>their experiences and<br>yeah giving people the confidence to put<br>their hand up to do those roles so how<br>do we develop and grow those people<br>because they are we have a shortage of<br>volunteers we know that there's real<br>issues around volunteerism so how do we<br>support and develop coaches at all<br>levels you know i think the high<br>performance people get<br>cracking great support they've got you<br>know<br>lots of time and lots of money put onto<br>them but the people that work with<br>tamariki and rangatahi often are left<br>hanging<br>what do we do that doesn't consume more<br>of their time but can support them go<br>wayne<br>i'll provide more opportunities for them<br>to to learn<br>opportunities um<br>you know we often in rugby we often talk<br>about um how do we get the community to<br>come to us how do we get more support to<br>the community it's the wrong question<br>what can we do for a community what can<br>rugby do for community you know and so i<br>think we've got to do more<br>do more for them um<br>assist them educate them<br>make sure that they're enjoying the<br>experience and and that they're that<br>and also celebrate them you know like<br>it's um<br>it's one of those tasks that you give<br>and give and give and it's nice when<br>someone uh gives some recognition back i<br>think that that that's you know<br>it's a little bit missed sometimes in in<br>coaching you know it's um it is a<br>it's a bit of a calling and if you do it<br>well then you have such a big impact and<br>i think we don't always celebrate the<br>fact that<br>that a coach um<br>has that manner you know and um it's<br>important<br>one thing one thing i was going to say<br>question sorry about<br>questioning is a really good way<br>to get people into coaching because<br>often<br>um<br>parents or whoever going into coaching<br>their kids team<br>are don't have a lot of knowledge about<br>the sport and they're scared to get into<br>it because they don't really know<br>what to coach or how to coach so getting<br>them to ask questions of the kids can be<br>a really important way to<br>to get them into it because they don't<br>actually need to know the answer but<br>um learning how to question is just as<br>important and i found early on that if<br>you ask someone why they did something<br>they get a bit embarrassed and they<br>think you're having a crack at them or<br>they feel they're going to justify<br>themselves so trying to get little<br>descriptive answers from from kids you<br>know so what did you see there you know<br>when you made that pass you know what<br>would you do next time if a fat player<br>came in<br>you know and<br>i think it's a really good way to<br>to get get people involved in the sport<br>i think part of the challenge of that is<br>that um<br>often we see<br>like people who volunteer in that<br>space with tamariki when their children<br>are in that<br>at that level but to progress there's<br>the sense that you have to progress like<br>i can't just stick coaching with<br>that might be my passion that might be<br>my strength but if i want to progress<br>i've got to go up the levels at the same<br>time to go up the levels actually i need<br>to be a high performance athlete don't i<br>don't i have to have competed for new<br>zealand to coach in a in a new zealand<br>program is that not the mandate and so<br>i'm kind of confused where do we find<br>our coaches and how do we support them<br>in those different ways<br>or is that just being<br>actually a bit of a danger like um it's<br>a bit like teaching you know you get<br>some fantastic teaching and then you you<br>um you move them through the system and<br>they become a<br>principal and they're not such a good<br>principal because they've they<br>haven't not in this case but they<br>haven't necessarily demonstrated those<br>skills<br>if you celebrate the um the coaches that<br>are working in the areas that are<br>producing<br>uh fantastic programs really enjoyable<br>programs keep them in there resource<br>them well celebrate them and keep them<br>doing what they're doing you know um<br>it's a very slick few that will go all<br>the way and become a high performance<br>coach you know and um and often we just<br>don't protect enough those ones that are<br>very good at the age groups and and<br>celebrate what they're doing because<br>it's so important<br>there's always a history of the history<br>and rugby there'll be a history and<br>rowing<br>of coaches that coach in<br>age group categories that produce these<br>players from little places that that<br>constantly come through and become world<br>champions you know keep them here<br>they're doing fantastic but um celebrate<br>them and resource them really well<br>yeah i have a bit of a funny story<br>around that is that's what tony was he<br>was one of those coaches that was just<br>producing athletes out of christ college<br>over and over again and we got to the<br>point where<br>we just sniped him because we wanted him<br>um<br>so i'm not sure if it was the right<br>thing to do he's actually gone back to<br>christ college after going and winning a<br>gold in tokyo but so that's a good story<br>on his part<br>but um that's what we saw as he was<br>producing good athletes over and over<br>again<br>and so we sort them out as a new zealand<br>team and<br>on the other end of that you talk<br>kirsten about um how a lot of athletes<br>that or a lot of coaches have been<br>athletes in the past and we have a<br>really interesting example of somebody<br>who wasn't<br>certainly not at the elite level and<br>that's james cote within the new zealand<br>rowing team and he coached um the<br>woman's double to<br>to silva at the olympics and his<br>background it<br>can was wasn't high performance growing<br>it was um he came from a more analytical<br>point of view and he's a fantastic coach<br>that brought a different perspective<br>that wasn't just um from an athlete<br>perspective<br>so i guess that lends itself to a<br>broader question for me is that<br>um you know we have a sports system that<br>has run in particular ways<br>for a very long time and you know gets<br>reproduced by a whole range of people in<br>power who are benefiting from that<br>um<br>these flaws in our sports system<br>uh because we see huge amounts of drop<br>out for young people for people who<br>leave university and go into the<br>workforce or become parents and families<br>we don't have volunteers<br>so what would be one thing you might<br>change in the sports system in aotearoa<br>new zealand if we wanted to do more<br>development of the whole person what<br>would be a change you'd make i'm going<br>to start with you wayne and then open it<br>up for others<br>provide funding i think for um those<br>people who are<br>dropping out of the volunteer jobs<br>you know you look at some<br>i look at rugby clubs for example<br>and uh<br>people haven't got time to do stuff for<br>nothing anymore<br>you know there are busy lives going on<br>and so i think funding's funding is a<br>really key thing<br>um and then<br>a network of um<br>of education<br>you know um making sure that there are<br>there's a strong ability in every area<br>to um<br>to create coaches and and to<br>give coach education<br>i think shane talked about country areas<br>before<br>that's where most you know if you look<br>at the stats mostly all blacks through<br>history they've come from rural areas<br>and uh<br>they've done that because they play<br>multiple sports<br>they often fill in in adult teams so<br>they're learning decision making<br>um<br>you know and they<br>are more likely to be outside playing<br>with a ball than um<br>than playing playstation inside so<br>there's a lot of<br>a lot of<br>possibilities i think getting into the<br>getting into those rural areas and<br>making sure that<br>education is spread<br>through there<br>so then get picked up and then get<br>picked up by christ college yeah the<br>people who've got the money and the<br>we'll just leave those comments aside<br>probably<br>i think it's um<br>there's a little bit of a redefining<br>about when and where sport happens<br>we traditionally said sport happens at<br>the weekend um<br>you know have to have so many trainings<br>during the week and<br>um<br>yeah maybe it's an opportunity i think<br>covert has presented lots of<br>opportunities actually to reflect and<br>review on on how we deliver sport and<br>and and<br>what opportu you know what competitions<br>run when<br>um and how they run and<br>yeah maybe it's a time to just just<br>rethink you know for sports to think<br>about maybe having midweek um<br>competitions um to free up the weekend<br>for family time or if i think about<br>rangatahi allow them to have the<br>weekends to have a have a job or or<br>socialize whatever that looks like but<br>yeah i guess it's<br>identifying what those barriers are to<br>to the volunteers taking place and<br>seeing if we can work a system that<br>allows that buys more time from<br>somewhere<br>or allows them to<br>get involved and commit to something<br>i don't know what they're complaining<br>with shortening seasons because once<br>upon a time you could play um i could<br>play softball and i could play hockey<br>when i was a youth<br>but nowadays you can't because they roll<br>together so much and and so where do i<br>get to have that multi-sport experience<br>what does that look like so there's a<br>whole range of those things shane you<br>come at probably a bit differently to<br>having your experiences both here and<br>new zealand as a young person not that<br>you're not young any longer and then<br>moving to belgium you know what are some<br>things we might change here or learn<br>from noting that our context is<br>different yeah it is a very complex<br>system here in new zealand so the<br>simplicity of belgium is quite charming<br>in a way so<br>what happens is often a<br>young family or a family with youngsters<br>will join a a club whether it's a<br>hockey club or a tennis club and often<br>they're linked and<br>it's an event to go there so you um<br>you know the whole family goes you spend<br>the day there it's not a drive-in<br>drop-off<br>speed back out it's it's actually<br>it's building a bit of that culture and<br>around belonging to something and and so<br>on and<br>some of the things that we've spoken<br>about are really evident there so um you<br>my boy plays uh hockey there and um and<br>he's seven so he arrives and they arrive<br>half an hour early<br>they play there's a field that's just<br>set up for them to play there's four or<br>five games going on no empiring no<br>coaching all the new skills coming out<br>and on display then they play a little<br>game after the game they go on as a as a<br>team and um<br>and they have a little meal together you<br>know and it's just a simple pasta and<br>stuff like that and they hang around and<br>they hang around for an hour or so<br>and the parents are also hanging around<br>in belgium it's 10 30 in the morning on<br>a sunday so of course you have a beer<br>and and you mix and mingle with other<br>parents but it's a really nice<br>feeling and it's a feeling of belonging<br>and it covers off a lot of those<br>cultural things um but they can also<br>track their players really well you know<br>so they're not playing for<br>four or five different teams their week<br>is is<br>regulated and each week is slightly<br>different so that they're getting<br>different experiences their schooling<br>stops on wednesday<br>at 12 in the morning and then in the<br>afternoon they have cultural law or a<br>sport experience and so they go to the<br>club and then again they do their<br>homework at the club<br>and they have a training session and<br>then there's you know a movie night or<br>something so it<br>it's it's different it's different and<br>it's simple you know and i think we can<br>learn a few lessons with that um because<br>i think that the system is very<br>complicated in new zealand and<br>every athlete has a number of masters<br>that it's not none of them by themselves<br>are<br>causing any harm but there's so many of<br>them that they layer on top of each<br>other<br>so i'm just conscious we've got three<br>minutes which is going to give you 30<br>seconds each to answer this last<br>question so what would be the biggest<br>challenge facing our coaching industry<br>industry i'm using that broadly and i'll<br>tell new zealand that we need to be<br>aware of and we should pack up next time<br>we come together to have a chat<br>amy jane you kick off then we'll roll<br>through okay i'm going to<br>give the female perspective and say we<br>need to promote and support more female<br>yep for me<br>mental health it's<br>way more<br>overt<br>and talked about today than in the past<br>so building more grit and resilience<br>within your coaching program<br>for your players i think is is important<br>if you want any material martin seligman<br>penn state university's book called<br>flourish<br>is um is really good on strategies to<br>simple strategies such as showing<br>gratitude<br>having laughter<br>engagement relationships all those<br>things social capital within your team<br>there's some really good information in<br>that book<br>sean<br>yeah i agree with what what's been said<br>um and yeah i think mental health uh has<br>become a key focus and it's an important<br>focus of<br>sport and the way that coaches do their<br>job um and so addressing that and<br>performing a framework to sort of handle<br>when those issues arise and then also<br>accessibility um<br>so making sure that sport is accessible<br>to everyone in all age groups<br>consistently<br>shane<br>yeah um mine would be<br>added to that would be um recognizing<br>that new generations are coming through<br>with new needs you know and um and<br>catering for those needs the best we can<br>covers off some of those things that<br>have been been listed here so yeah i<br>think that there's an understanding as<br>well<br>i recognize it's a shame i feel like we<br>could sit here for the night and have a<br>chat would be much better if we were at<br>a dinner table having a a lot of kai to<br>go with us um i really appreciate the<br>contribution you've all made i'm sure<br>we'll be able to come back together and<br>uh<br>chat about this um in the future you<br>continue to lead well and coach well and<br>grow coaches and<br>contribute to our sporting community<br>really broadly so thank you for your<br>ongoing work and your contribution<br>uh<br>so<br>i'm<br>so<br>you</p></main><footer style="margin-top: 2rem; background: #0001; padding: 2rem;
