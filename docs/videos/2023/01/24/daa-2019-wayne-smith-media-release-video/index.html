Bede's College down<br>in Christchurch but in those days you<br>know the game was immature in those days<br>and you know you're trained at night for<br>the club you're trained at night for<br>Canterbury the all-black tools were long<br>and we didn't get paid when we were away<br>on tour they were quite difficult times<br>and so I went into commercial job rather<br>than teaching and in the late 80s I'd<br>been in SLA and I I started in a little<br>bit more teaching at st. Bede's<br>as a part-time part-time job I remember<br>Gary Lennon who was director offered me<br>a job there and I was choosing between a<br>coaching job or innocent beads I<br>remember him saying to me there's no<br>future agreed coaching but now I didn't<br>really plan anything when I was a<br>youngster I've basically followed the<br>creative way but I was pretty immature<br>when I started here I was only 17 and I<br>didn't know what I was going to do but<br>coaching is about communication and<br>teachings about communication and so the<br>two things seemed to sink in and<br>definitely helped my career what do you<br>remember about studying here so my first<br>year I was in the Student Village in<br>those days he had a standard tertiary<br>bursary so everyone who went to<br>university got $24 a week and it cost<br>$24 a week to stay at the student<br>village including your meals which was<br>handy most of milk and the holidays and<br>pick up high and that over Christmas and<br>Sunday had a student loan when I came<br>here so that first year really sticks<br>out and the student village it was<br>pretty social as you can imagine and I<br>came because uh because rugby was just a<br>sport like it wasn't professional I had<br>dreams in the game clearly but I want to<br>get my degree done and I wouldn't be<br>that the best academically come through<br>I guess it worked at the university but<br>I wanted to get my degree done and so<br>you know played rugby at the same time<br>and I and I was I was pretty keen on<br>making sure I trained like like<br>provincial player would train but I<br>wasn't a provincial player I was my<br>dream was to play for purgatory<br>basically Pretoria seniors but I had<br>always had this feeling that you don't<br>have to be a greater the game to do well<br>in the game and and you don't have to be<br>the best in the world to follow the<br>habits for the best in the world and I<br>always had the thinking that I should<br>just follow the habits that these great<br>players follow and see how see how far<br>it gets when so I saw I balanced the two<br>things so first year was pretty<br>outstanding made a lot of people sick<br>and after that I went flattened ended up<br>in a flat and gray Street you know<br>there's a there's a hollow that there's<br>a yep dippin the light in the road and<br>the rugby field down the bottom yes so<br>we fled it just up the top up these<br>stairs and that rugby field shaped a lot<br>of my kicking and my skill work so I was<br>down there every day had a flatmate cook<br>Trevor Matheson who's incidentally<br>ambassador to Indonesia was invested to<br>Italy and Greece Spain yes I you know<br>this might be fair together played footy<br>together and very skeptical in this race<br>ground because he's a good racing man<br>truth but he's to come down to the<br>ground and and retrieved the ball for me<br>from what<br>Oh kind soul yeah I don't remember those<br>days living there was the fog we don't<br>get the fog today like no no but it was<br>just you're always the mist and fog in<br>this professional era would you still<br>recommend that players do get some kind<br>of tertiary education or do you think<br>it's not necessary now no I think the<br>key thing is that they have that players<br>have a career in mind and I think trades<br>every bit as important is there's a<br>tissue education so I just encourage us<br>to do what you know what interests them<br>and what they're capable of doing and<br>also today lock in my day because the<br>game is amateur as I said you know you<br>essentially went to university and you<br>finished a degree as quickly as you<br>could and then you got into the<br>workforce today for a player who's in an<br>academy or on a on motor development<br>program with was a super rugby team or<br>in a super rugby squad<br>they've already got a you know career in<br>mind for a few years of professional<br>rugby player I get the opportunity to<br>reduce the number of papers they do in a<br>year so they can get their balance for<br>both careers and you know they've got a<br>longer period that they can do the<br>degrees in but I think it's really<br>important that they have something not<br>only for the future but for the present<br>because I think having certainly for me<br>having rugby helped my study help help<br>my my academic career but also having<br>study help my rugby because I enjoyed it<br>a lot more and you know I couldn't wait<br>to get back out on the field out of the<br>classroom and onto the field so they<br>helped you study you know you I'm not<br>somebody can be stuck in a room all day<br>reading books and studying I need<br>needed something physical you know to<br>break that up and rugby was it for me<br>so it's yeah I think I'm fishing the app<br>allowed me to concentrate better when I<br>did study on you know it short periods<br>of study and then on get some rugby<br>training or run or wave a game or<br>whatever so I think the two things were<br>complementary and you were believer in<br>lifelong learning yeah yeah I'm a real<br>believer that a growth mindset is really<br>important and what I mean by that people<br>who don't just rely on their talent and<br>who are prepared to keep learning who<br>aren't scared to make mistakes you don't<br>need to be perfect<br>generally the other people that they<br>have a career of getting better and<br>trying to improve themselves and I think<br>the other people that succeed and<br>whatever they do whether at sport or or<br>or career probably both fixed mindsets<br>and we all know people who have that as<br>as a belief that you've got natural<br>talent that you don't have to work to<br>improve that and in fact you don't want<br>to try something harder because you<br>might fail and then that would show you<br>that your talents not so not so large so<br>don't try something difficult just go<br>what's easy and be really good at it and<br>I don't think in my view in my<br>experience in sport in particular they<br>when you came back to the All Blacks<br>enjoying Graham Henry you know everyone<br>talks about how you sort of work to<br>change the whole culture of the team so<br>what what did you call upon you know how<br>did you take control how did you lead<br>that there are interesting times so I've<br>been involved since 98 with your back so<br>even while I was coaching Crusaders I<br>was helping John half for a couple of<br>years with the All Blacks is for like a<br>technical advisor I was the first coach<br>I think possibly in the world I'm not<br>too sure but it it used computerized<br>analysis program which I've worked on<br>with a guy could George Cyril oculars of<br>professor of biochemistry but had had a<br>real interest in utilization in sport<br>and so he and I and it was help from<br>people I grow more E and a and Bremen<br>Ratcliffe from Hawke's Bay we helped<br>create this program so I was using it<br>with Crusaders and then and then with<br>the All Blacks in 99 so I'd had that<br>involvement it became all black coach<br>2000 2001 had a pretty sad ending to<br>that it's been well-documented and then<br>went on return of 2004 to me that the<br>there were issues around and they were<br>issues I think that came through<br>professionalism we're all of sudden<br>players getting paid<br>having another career wasn't quite so<br>important and there's almost like a<br>mentality and some players we had a we<br>had what I thought was now or what we<br>all thought was pretty outdated<br>leadership model where there was a<br>captain and then everyone else sort of<br>them behind the captain and there was<br>opportunity to - life - to leave it up<br>to the captain and the coaches to make<br>the decisions and lead the way so we<br>were by the end of 2004 became apparent<br>that we were going to make some changes<br>because the environment was not the best<br>the leadership model wasn't really<br>working and we took a brave decision -<br>to change a a methodology coaching and<br>be the culture of the team and a big<br>part of that so so there's Graham Henry<br>Stevenson guild and okay<br>Daren shamed and Veejay like the great<br>BJ Lahore and we went up to Wellington<br>for a couple of days locked ourselves in<br>a room at the Enzo you and came up with<br>about a nine point plan of how we were<br>gonna change the game that included a<br>leadership group leadership training for<br>the players but also for ourselves so<br>he's used a top educationist in in in<br>Cole Pearn - to take us over over months<br>really and teaching us how to be leaders<br>we had a we still had a captain and in a<br>vice captain but it's the leaders that<br>we wanted to be making on-field<br>decisions we made our trainings way more<br>specific to the game we brought in a<br>mental skills program that was this in<br>the classroom and more on the field so<br>we were determined to take it onto the<br>field so it head so it was applicable<br>during the game Brian a hawk coined a<br>phrase bit of people make you know<br>rubrics<br>so we decided to start selecting your<br>character as much as talent said so<br>there all these initiatives that came in<br>place and at the time you know there was<br>a fair bit of criticism from the media<br>around what we were doing and there are<br>a lot of things that we didn't know what<br>we were doing but you're kind of stuck<br>to your game right and I guess you<br>called upon some of your university<br>experience your psychology your<br>philosophy at that point I'd called all<br>that experience years ago so yeah<br>rollick I did a geography degree but<br>part of a part of me wanting subjects<br>that fitted in with the degree and also<br>fiddling with my rugby training was that<br>I did psychology and sociology not for<br>any means other than getting my degree<br>but of course through time they had a<br>real effect on me and the first one was<br>in 1982 I was sort of up and down as a<br>player you know I have a good game in<br>Liverpool game and I'd very little<br>consistency so I turned to sports<br>psychology as a key to become more<br>consistent so that included imagery a<br>pregame routine all sorts of things that<br>I was using I met Gilbert an accurate<br>Hillman high school he was a picture<br>there and he was studying psychology and<br>he was captain of New Zealand volleyball<br>team at the time so he was helping me<br>with some ideas so it really made a big<br>difference were like we created it took<br>out the spikes and maybe slightly more<br>consistent just enough to be okay and<br>then we're not started coaching I became<br>player coach of Kenna Ruby<br>1988 with John Phillips and then I<br>became head coach in 89 and onwards and<br>from 89 Jordan icon has been a constant<br>here in my coaching teams so even in<br>1989 with Steve Hansen as they're kept<br>in we were doing 20 minutes sports site<br>sessions before we ran out to train<br>other boys all had a had an exercise<br>book the front of the book we made notes<br>from Gilbert sessions middle of the book<br>we had a lot of section where we went<br>through how we would deal with what ifs<br>in the game and pride of the game and<br>what if the bus broke down and what if<br>the seven little game would we're down<br>by five points all that sort of stuff in<br>the back of the book we had a glossary<br>of terms now this is 1989 you can<br>imagine I think most rugby people<br>thought I was made I was going to say it<br>was turning a whole kind of philosophy<br>on its head wasn't it you know it's it<br>was becoming a thinking man's game as<br>opposed to a can of a just a that was<br>idea any idea he's still gonna be<br>physical but my attitude was like the<br>game wasn't professional so I'm not like<br>a really it didn't hinge on a day in him<br>John what does he was the coach and I<br>just thought rather than follow the head<br>I wanted to do something that was<br>different in something that I felt in my<br>day as a player they're all black<br>coaches for example were men managers<br>and they they led the players to coach<br>they gave a lot of responsibility to<br>leaders within the team to take the next<br>one take Broadway and whilst right<br>whilst coaching was developing through<br>the 80s and 90s I still like that idea<br>of people rise into their own challenges<br>you know players won't necessarily rise<br>to my challenge or any coach's challenge<br>but they will rise to their own<br>challenges so I suppose at that time I<br>was trying to work out ways of how do we<br>do that how do we integrate the players<br>into our coaching how do we involve them<br>to accept that they are<br>the team culture and they own what the<br>legacy of the team's going to be and so<br>we just tried things<br>do you still or do you enjoy watching<br>rugby now or do you sit there and get<br>all analytical I wouldn't do it like<br>that kind of no funny enough I don't get<br>that analytical if I'm going to analyze<br>a game I have to go back and and watch<br>it in detail and it cuz I have to do<br>that that's my own team you broke a<br>Steelers in Japan and also the odd time<br>catches all in and say kid over look at<br>this we have a look at that<br>but essentially on the stones every<br>every other thing like rugby is is my<br>life I've got a free said I'll go watch<br>hoteth we play in a local game in<br>Cambridge the odd time we'll go down and<br>watch potato replay you know I just love<br>the game and I can watch it like<br>everybody else at home I prefer to at<br>this point up a few to watch a test<br>match on TV at home with a beer in my<br>hand rather than amongst the crowd I<br>don't know why that is but that's how I<br>am at the moment and I just really<br>really enjoy the game really enjoy not<br>having to sit there and analyze it what<br>about your boys are they rugby players<br>or what what part did they follow so<br>both my boys that I could be much<br>Nicolas I've got twin boys who are 37 36<br>alright or aged more one Nicholas is an<br>assistant professor at a university in<br>China and here's a we've got a grandson<br>over the year so he studied oh he did a<br>has his doctorate and the<br>Europeanisation of the Russian States<br>it's actually published a couple of<br>books he's doing really well and Joshua<br>another son he started University late<br>and he's just stand back at all of us<br>masters at Kennedy University and<br>history they both run love rugby<br>didn't really play and it mixes played a<br>bit they play when they were kids<br>but they enjoy all sports and joy<br>American sports but hugely passionate<br>about rugby and good advisors to me over<br>the years how bit there's a famous story<br>in the family where people will probably<br>remember one of my first tests in charge<br>there's all that coach was 2000 and the<br>game that's called the game of the<br>century and suddenly where we had a<br>hundred nine thousand against Australia<br>it was a world record crowd we were up<br>24 nil after seven minutes and I stand<br>to think it was all that touching is not<br>not that hard but anyway um by halftime<br>it was twenty four all and my son was<br>staying with a friend of ours in<br>Christchurch Joshua and twenty four all<br>he he got up and he was disgusted and<br>went upstairs and was heard muttering<br>that man's got to go talking about me<br>so a pretty passionate about the go and<br>you're still coaching and now it's Japan<br>but a little side trips to Italy so<br>obviously you're still enjoying the job<br>I'm semi-retired we but we love what I'm<br>doing in Japan Trish and I we we love<br>going over here it's like it's a great<br>society it's really honest society with<br>Cobell Casillas get recovery steel there<br>are really old club 92 years old got a<br>huge history showed a lot of resilience<br>during the earthquakes in 95 we've got a<br>real legacy booming real legacy in the<br>club I've got some really good players e<br>Daniel Carter's one in Indy Ellis Tom<br>Franklin Richard Buckland heading back<br>and they're all all really good rugby<br>people who helping develop their culture<br>at the club and helping the Japanese<br>boys with the game so I feel really<br>privileged to be involved with him and<br>and be at the club and looking forward<br>to the World Cup in Japan yeah I'll be<br>over there already for pre-season with<br>my club and I've got a group of people<br>coming over for the semi-final final so<br>attrition I'll be looking after them I<br>think it'll be sensational but we are<br>really even for a club rugby we'll get<br>good crowds<br>mm-hm so we'll get between twelve<br>thousand sixteen thousand for a for a<br>cup game at home the final last year<br>against Suntory was up at their home<br>ground and Tokyo constrictive stadium<br>one thing holds 25,000 that was a<br>sellout Dave Dylan who's my head coach<br>you know I went to the University final<br>the week after our top league final and<br>that was a sellout 25,000 at the same<br>ground so there's there's an interest in<br>rugby it's it's not the number one sport<br>clearly but there was an interest there<br>and I think for the World Cup there will<br>be a huge amount of interest humid huge<br>amount of following I think Japanese<br>people will get behind it<br>great meanwhile welcome back to work at<br>oh and congratulations on being a just<br>thing but sure let's go<br>I'll break in the sweet thing and I've<br>got to go to our exam all right<br>brought another no exams with this paper<br>you're quiet thank you<br>you</p></main><footer style="margin-top: 2rem; background: #0001; padding: 2rem; text-align: center;"><p>We Are The
