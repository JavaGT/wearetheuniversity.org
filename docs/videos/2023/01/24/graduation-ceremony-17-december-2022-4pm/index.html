soloist<br>in the public concert series of the<br>School of Performing Arts and in City<br>concerts<br>accompanying Emma today is Terence<br>Dennis Blair professor of Music at the<br>University who's long been regarded as<br>one of the country's most noted<br>musicians<br>he has notably given around 50 concerts<br>across the world with Dane Kitty to<br>kanawa<br>it's with great pleasure that I invite<br>foreign<br>everyone<br>oh<br>foreign<br>foreign<br>foreign<br>more<br>even<br>the ice cream man free ice creams<br>he shouted a more<br>foreign<br>instead of shouting no and yes<br>foreign<br>again<br>but as I passed to the church house door<br>instead of seeing<br>amen<br>long life<br>thank you both for that wonderful<br>performance<br>our graduation speaker this afternoon<br>really needs no introduction<br>our university has been highly visible<br>in its impressive contribution to New<br>Zealand's efforts to contain covid-19<br>and that response strategy has been<br>predominantly led by Dr Ashley<br>Bloomfield who was until recently the<br>director general of Health<br>he trained in medicine and Public Health<br>at the University of Auckland and his<br>primary area of interest is the<br>prevention and control of<br>non-communicable diseases<br>Dr Bloomfield has held several<br>leadership positions in the New Zealand<br>Health System including chief executive<br>at Hutt Valley District Health Board<br>from 2015 to 2018.<br>during 2011 he worked at the World<br>Health Organization in Geneva<br>early in the pandemic Dr Bloomfield<br>became a household name with his<br>appearances on the 1pm media updates<br>during the first 2020 lockdown<br>his calm and reassuring manner was<br>critical at a time of great uncertainty<br>and as the country looked for<br>reassurance<br>a highly popular public servant His<br>Image has graced t-shirts and tote bags<br>and his humor Sean through on many<br>occasions<br>at the end of July he stepped down from<br>his very demanding role and we are<br>delighted that he accepted the vice<br>please join me in welcoming Dr<br>Koto katoa this is not a covid-19<br>announcement<br>will all be relieved about that<br>first of all tinakoi Professor Broughton<br>and thank you for your meeting to us all<br>here this afternoon Chancellor<br>pro-chancellor Vice Chancellor you wish<br>at the mayor<br>members of the University Council<br>academic and professional staff<br>parents families and whanau and friends<br>and most importantly graduates<br>well it's a great pleasure to be here<br>today as part of the ceremony it's just<br>over 30 years since my own graduation in<br>Medicine of course I'm at the wrong<br>University today but never mind it's a<br>great relief I'm sure for all of us and<br>indeed it's a huge achievement that we<br>are all able to gather here today<br>despite what has happened through the<br>covid-19 pandemic<br>first my sincere congratulations to all<br>the graduating students this is a<br>fantastic occasion and we are all here<br>to honor you your hard work and your<br>success<br>Savor the moment it's a huge and<br>important milestone in your life's<br>journey<br>your parents your family your friends<br>will be rightly proud of you and I know<br>you will be grateful for the support<br>they have provided you and I want to<br>take this opportunity to thank them on<br>your behalf<br>now there are a few things that I feel<br>will serve you well as you set out on<br>the next step of your life Journey<br>well first and most importantly<br>know where you are going<br>that's not the same as knowing exactly<br>what your destination is for my part I<br>didn't even know there was a role of<br>director general of Health when I<br>graduated from medicine but you should<br>be clear about what is guiding you<br>I'm talking here about your values your<br>moral compass<br>now many of you will already have a set<br>of values that consciously or<br>subconsciously guide you<br>for my part the ones that have served me<br>well through my life through my career<br>and particularly through the challenges<br>of the covid-19 pandemic our courage<br>Integrity which is simply doing what you<br>say you're going to do<br>humility<br>and kindness<br>now in my mind kindness is something of<br>a meta value and it's a central tenet of<br>all the world's major religions it's<br>simply thinking of and doing things for<br>other people<br>without any expectation of reciprocity<br>early in the pandemic during our first<br>lockdown we saw the enormous power of<br>kindness if people act in each other's<br>interests you may recall the prime<br>minister's call to Collective action<br>stay home save lives be kind<br>we ended up as a result of that not just<br>bending the epidemiological curve but<br>and don't forget<br>the kindness extends to being kind to<br>yourself as well as others<br>a big lesson for me during the pandemic<br>was that resilient people are not those<br>that just keep going although they do<br>have enormous capacity to do so<br>instead resilient people are the ones<br>that know their boundaries really well<br>resilience is about knowing your<br>boundaries physical mental and emotional<br>and taking active steps to remain within<br>those boundaries<br>now second<br>put plenty of effort into developing and<br>nurturing strong and enduring<br>relationships in your work and non-work<br>life<br>I received great advice early in my<br>career that in every interaction I had<br>with someone<br>I should put 80 of my effort into<br>developing and nurturing the<br>relationship and the other 20 into<br>following up on the issue that we were<br>there for<br>there's an old adage in leadership<br>people won't necessarily remember what<br>you said or did they will remember how<br>you made them feel<br>and how they feel about you will<br>determine their willingness to work with<br>you to achieve shared goals<br>of course how people feel about you is<br>determined by how you behave<br>we judge ourselves by our intentions<br>others judge us about by our behaviors<br>and in my experience<br>the most important behavior for making<br>people feel good is simply just being<br>positive<br>so smile a lot bring energy and genuine<br>interest to your interactions with<br>others make a point of metaphorically<br>patting someone on the back every day<br>and third<br>enjoy your work<br>this is important our work is a key part<br>of our identity and our life's meaning<br>and purpose<br>now here's a quote from Shakespeare's<br>The Tempest act 3 scene one<br>so this is Ferdinand talking about<br>Miranda who he has fallen in love with<br>this is Shakespeare after all and he<br>Muses as he simply carries a log I quote<br>this my main task<br>would be as easy would be as heavy to me<br>as odious but the mistress which I serve<br>quickens what's dead and makes my labors<br>pleasures<br>or in a similar vein the Nobel prize<br>winning winning Bengali polymath<br>rabindranath tagore wrote<br>I slipped and I dreamed that life was<br>Joy<br>I awoke and I saw that life was service<br>I worked and behold service was Joy<br>and finally<br>a reminder that humans singularly have<br>the ability to both imagine a better<br>future and make it happen<br>every so often we do to open ourselves<br>to the big picture to ensure We are<br>continuing to dream of that better<br>future remember Martin Luther King<br>didn't say I have an idea or I have some<br>new scientific evidence<br>he said<br>I have a dream<br>so in summary<br>be kind be positive enjoy your work and<br>keep dreaming and living your dream<br>rather than searching for the meaning of<br>life ask yourself this question<br>what meaning am I going to give my life<br>it's in your hands<br>thank you again for the privilege of<br>being here congratulations once again<br>thank you very much Dr Bloomfield for<br>speaking to us today<br>thank you again for the extraordinary<br>job you did in the pandemic response and<br>your commitment to ensuring the health<br>of new zealanders<br>we wish you all the best in the next<br>chapter of your life and career<br>and I ask the audience to join me again<br>in thanking you<br>on behalf of the University Council<br>thank you again for celebrating with us<br>today for those who have traveled long<br>distances and to those closer to home<br>highway to ATU hoki to my safe travels<br>and stay well<br>I'd also like to thank the vice<br>Chancellor

will now<br>be sung the words are printed inside the<br>back cover of your graduation booklet<br>at the conclusion of the anthem please<br>remain standing as the academic<br>procession retires
