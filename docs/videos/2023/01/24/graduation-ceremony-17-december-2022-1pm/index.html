pro-vice Chancellor I've attended<br>almost every graduation over the last<br>six years<br>more than 60.<br>I've also attended many more in my 26<br>years at otago<br>and it always serves to fakahihimi<br>inspire me as I watch graduates cross<br>the stage to become graduates<br>be it a become an LLB<br>The Joy your whanau and your teachers<br>share is palpable<br>for it symbolizes both an end<br>now in keeping with the graduation<br>address hey Tima tatanga one starting<br>point is<br>our short Snappy life lessons<br>on my first day<br>as a year nine third former I walked<br>into the Hall of my new<br>High School<br>only it did not resemble a school hall<br>that looked like a pool hall<br>there were six pool tables surrounded by<br>enormous men<br>resplendent with Majestic eagle tattoos<br>on their forearms and sporting<br>impressive facial hair<br>all were dressed in the school uniform<br>a DJ on the stage equally attired played<br>JJ kales cocaine<br>how cool I thought<br>I quickly found out that these muscle<br>men<br>were repeating fifth form level one ncea<br>now I was very good at Paul<br>but I learned that day<br>it was sometimes bitter to lose than<br>incur an even greater loss<br>music was my singular focus at High<br>School<br>and I was a member of several bands<br>the go cats<br>boiled owls<br>their gun have sod<br>Carlton Heston<br>and the Skeptics<br>now none of us could play our<br>instruments nor read music but we never<br>saw this as an obstacle<br>as teens squashed into our Ford F-100 V8<br>ambulance van we toured the motto<br>highlights included supporting Nick Cave<br>and the birthday party in Palmerston<br>North<br>low lights included being paid to stop<br>playing in Timaru<br>lest the Republican and the band be<br>beaten up by drunken sailors<br>a mid light a neologism I've created an<br>honor for this graduation<br>was the band being arrested for being<br>underage at the Captain Cook while<br>sitting up on a chilly Saturday<br>afternoon<br>on that fateful day<br>the Dunedin constabulary strodden and<br>arrested my fellow band members who were<br>hauling the PA across the floor<br>I was on the stage<br>ergov I was not arrested<br>uh go lesson number two<br>it pays to be in the right place at the<br>I left high school and became a display<br>artist a stage manager for a<br>professional Live Theater Company<br>and then a small business advisor whilst<br>the music business is one very very<br>tough gig<br>so after a lot of soul searching<br>and traveling the world for a year I<br>enrolled at taheringawaka Victoria<br>and it just kind of snowballed from<br>in the words of LinkedIn founder Reed<br>Hoffman<br>no matter how brilliant your mind or<br>strategy is<br>if you're playing a solo game<br>now over the years<br>there has never been a single person on<br>this stage describe how they<br>discovered this<br>invented that or bought everything<br>it has always been<br>about the Mahia te Mahi called tahitanga<br>our graduation speakers have always<br>celebrated the tangata who made their<br>dreams and accomplishments possible<br>and they've described their key to<br>success in business and in life<br>adaptability<br>in every successful team<br>you will find a willingness to adapt in<br>response to the ever-present new<br>challenges and opportunities<br>of course<br>if you graduated today with a Commerce<br>degree<br>you'll know that adaptability sits at<br>the three lessons<br>tahi it is sometimes better to lose than<br>incur an even greater loss<br>I think this is about humility<br>it is our pride that stands in our way<br>when we should stop and re-evaluate<br>instead of keeping on going<br>whether it is a personal relationship<br>or a business deal<br>knowing when to stop<br>and take inventory requires humility<br>and humility is simple<br>it is the recognition and acceptance of<br>the truth<br>Rua<br>it pays to be in the right place at the<br>Say Yes To Life<br>say yes to people places and<br>opportunities<br>to paraphrase Mark Twain<br>the world is a book and where you are is<br>butter page<br>being in right places at right times and<br>being on the right page<br>is saying yes to life<br>screens and rooms are not a substitute<br>for order<br>life<br>a condiment perhaps but never a<br>substitute<br>no matter how brilliant your mind or<br>strategy is<br>if you're playing a solo game you'll<br>always lose out to a team<br>the world needs you<br>climate change War pandemics social<br>injustice Ed infinitum<br>now you have learned at otago that it is<br>possible to start from a point of<br>failure<br>assess and strategize the work with<br>those around you adapt<br>and keep going in pursuit of being a<br>change for good<br>for<br>wherever you go into business<br>government<br>or into the community to work you must<br>finally<br>serving the university as pro-vice<br>Chancellor Commerce and Dean of otago<br>Business School has been an
