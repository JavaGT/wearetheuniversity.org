join me in<br>welcoming associate professor faculty to<br>deliver the graduation address today<br>foreign<br>greetings<br>Chancellor<br>Vice Chancellor<br>your worship<br>colleagues<br>families<br>friends and graduates<br>graduates<br>today is your special day<br>your graduation marks are collective<br>acknowledgment of the successful<br>completion of your study program<br>for those of you graduating with<br>postgraduate qualifications<br>this may be a familiar experience<br>for the majority<br>this will be your first graduation<br>Savor the moment reflect on what today<br>means and be grateful for the gift of<br>family and friends<br>be proud of your achievement<br>be proud of still because you are the<br>first graduation cohort to have<br>successfully studied<br>during and through the covid-19 pandemic<br>your experience is so unique<br>the researchers like myself have even<br>referred to you as the covered<br>generation<br>your graduation today demonstrates<br>perseverance resilience and Hope<br>I wish to pay special acknowledgment to<br>First in family graduates<br>Maori<br>Pacific<br>and other indigenous graduates<br>graduates from immigrant and Refugee<br>backgrounds<br>graduates from rural<br>gender diverse backgrounds and<br>international graduates<br>your choice to attend University is bold<br>and brave and your success admirable<br>because universities are sites of<br>privilege<br>where the curriculum is very eurocentric<br>and Market driven and a place that is<br>still inaccessible to many<br>in choosing to study at otago you have<br>helped us<br>shape the university we wish for<br>ourselves<br>one that represents our diverse<br>communities<br>and our ongoing work to Center the<br>values of manafinoa who have embraced us<br>on this land<br>I identify with many of you here today<br>I was the first in my extended family to<br>attend University<br>in fact accidentally<br>because my Curious teacher had applied<br>on my behalf<br>in Fiji and the Pacific universities are<br>very recent introductions<br>I went to University from Oberlin<br>small island in Fiji<br>my most likely other option<br>was worked in a local tuna Cannery which<br>paid one Fijian dollar an hour at that<br>time<br>I remember vividly the day my father and<br>I left the island for Suva fiji's<br>capital<br>to enroll at the University of the South<br>Pacific<br>we had never set foot on a University<br>campus<br>we were in awe of the place<br>at University I was often anxious<br>because the language of instruction was<br>English<br>I thought in Fijian my first language<br>and I often languished Because by the<br>time I formed thoughts and questions<br>conversations would have moved on<br>however I enjoyed learning and<br>persevered<br>University was my happy place<br>and sociology my major made many things<br>make sense<br>for example<br>it affirmed that I could have 16<br>grandparents<br>after my year 8 social science teacher<br>told me<br>that one only had four<br>it was ironic that a western oriented<br>discipline validated my indigenous<br>Fijian social world<br>since then I have appreciated that<br>knowledge systems can coexist<br>my newfound University knowledge and<br>Life Experiences<br>alerted me to the impact of<br>westernization in Fiji<br>I noticed growing inequality<br>hardship and shifting cultural values<br>that led to many youths take up a street<br>existence<br>I could have easily been one of them so<br>I tried to understand these developments<br>via a PhD at the University of<br>Queensland in Australia<br>the title of my thesis was in the system<br>but out of place<br>understanding Street frequenting young<br>people in Suva Fiji<br>I have subsequently dedicated my<br>academic career to ensuring that people<br>particularly the marginalized experience<br>a sense of belonging<br>I found settling and transitioning into<br>a new country as an international<br>student both exciting and challenging<br>study was enjoyable<br>but it took me a while to settle into<br>ordinary life<br>for example<br>I spent an hour finishing my bowl of<br>spaghetti bolognese<br>or a little longer to decipher the<br>nuances of Intercultural communication<br>in situations where Australians were<br>constantly nodding<br>in conversations<br>I used to wonder what the point of<br>conversations were because in Fiji when<br>one spoke the other listened<br>tolerance and understanding helped me<br>cope<br>and I'm sure many of you would have had<br>similar enriching experiences at otago<br>graduation marks the successful<br>successful attainment of your respective<br>qualifications<br>many view this process as linear<br>but you all know it is not<br>University learning also has unintended<br>consequences<br>it can be fun and enjoyable<br>and many Fall In and Out of Love at<br>University<br>experience Independent Living<br>and occasionally engage in this Coffee<br>Culture<br>at the same time<br>some would have experienced learning<br>difficulties Financial personal and<br>mental health challenges to the point of<br>contemplating living University<br>perhaps some left<br>returned and are graduating here today<br>the late Fijian historian Professor<br>Bridge Lal<br>a very close Mentor was formed of saying<br>that education is a great leveler of<br>hierarchy<br>I would add that education engages both<br>the huts and the mind in creative ways<br>to address and understand the challenges<br>of life<br>we often hear that the world is becoming<br>a better place however Injustice<br>inequality<br>violence and the lack of<br>self-determination persists<br>out there on New Zealand is not immune<br>from this reality<br>even race relations according to author<br>John black in the book becoming pakeha<br>is perhaps at its worst because Maori<br>and pakeha don't talk to each other<br>as graduates<br>you head into this world including one<br>that is complex<br>fast and full of noise<br>as you navigate post-university life<br>my message is that you do not take your<br>education for granted<br>the covid-19 pandemic demonstrated that<br>while scientists helped us to understand<br>the virus<br>it was those with a background in the<br>Arts and Humanities that kept us<br>connected and hopeful<br>so use your degree to discern and make<br>informed choices<br>use it to trouble<br>and question what is perceived as normal<br>and the implications of this for our<br>society<br>specifically<br>you can do this by<br>disrupting knowledge systems and<br>practices that reinforce privilege and<br>discrimination<br>to be effective in this quest learn to<br>understand the historical and cultural<br>can be loved<br>but it can also be subtle<br>learn to listen<br>without being silent about our<br>Collective values<br>disrupting does not have to be divisive<br>build trust and understanding by<br>reaching out across tribes<br>you are the most networked generation<br>and can easily do this<br>the late Moana Jackson often encouraged<br>us to talk to and with each other<br>and in Fijian we call this vitalanoa<br>and to reflect on the idea of being home<br>on this land in order to address our<br>issues<br>those who know me<br>know that I disrupt gently<br>with while engaging with systems and<br>practices I wish to influence<br>one could argue<br>it has been effective given that I'm<br>what I'm suggesting can be challenging<br>because it often means troubling the<br>status quo<br>in addition new environments can be<br>isolating<br>if they are unfamiliar and exclusive<br>however the possibility that things can<br>be different gives one a sense of hope<br>and I wanted to demonstrate this to you<br>today<br>in the 11 years I've worked at the<br>University of otago<br>I have never attended a graduation<br>ceremony<br>in my capacity as a member of staff<br>I've said in the audience<br>cheering students and friends on<br>but never in an official capacity<br>it is also the first time<br>I am wearing the doctoral regalia<br>my reasons are personal<br>to some degree<br>it is Defiance<br>but a big part of it is the sociological<br>sense of troubling tradition and having<br>a metaphorical conversation with my<br>academic home<br>today I decided to cast those feelings<br>aside<br>open myself to new possibilities<br>and join you all in the celebration of<br>life<br>growth and success<br>I feel very humbled<br>and very very honored<br>to be sharing this occasion with you all<br>in closing<br>you will venture out to create your<br>place in the world<br>but I with my colleagues will remain at<br>otago<br>you live with
