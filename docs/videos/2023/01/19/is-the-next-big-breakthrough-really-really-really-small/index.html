Nanomaterials are impossibly tiny—one nanometre is a billionth of a metre, or about 50,000 to 100,000 times smaller than the width of a human hair. Associate Professor Plank is fascinated with the practical applications of nanotechnology that are potentially life-saving. Her research focuses on creating incredibly fast, accurate, and sensitive sensors.<br><br>Explore world-leading research at www.wgtn.ac.nz/wellington</p><h2>Transcript</h2><p style="opacity: 0.9; font-size: 0.8em">Transcripts may be automatically generated and may not be 100% accurate.</p><p>sometimes you're having problems <br>in the lab trying to get things  <br>to work well and you realise that <br>there's no guidebook for how to  <br>do this because your team is the one <br>who's doing this for the first time.<br>A nanometer, it's incredibly <br>little, it's a billionth of a meter<br>If you've got a one nanometer sized ball or  <br>particle and then you compare that <br>to the size of say, a cricket ball.<br>That's the same kind of jump <br>in length scale as considering  <br>that cricket ball to the size of planet Earth.<br>What I'm quite motivated about <br>right now is that interface of  <br>nanomaterials and biomaterials <br>to make things that are useful.<br>There's a big worldwide need <br>for high fidelity sensors<br>really accurate, very sensitive, very selective.<br>So you want your receptor to respond <br>to only one thing or a group of things,  <br>but you want to know what it's responding to.<br>And this can be really useful for <br>say applications in food safety,  <br>biosecurity, health care, where we're <br>able to kind of do non-invasive tests  <br>very cheaply and easily in your <br>GP office or something like that.<br>So all of these things sort of <br>combine to be really motivating.<br>The point of working on the nanoscale <br>is that you get new properties<br>for example increase sensitivity or the electronic  <br>properties might change in a way so <br>that when you have a biomaterial on  <br>our conductor you're getting a special kind <br>of interaction that allows us to see things.<br>So it's really that exploitation of new <br>properties that you don't get at different scales.<br>Often we'll have multiple questions <br>that might lead in the same way<br>so can we make this device, <br>can we understand this protein.<br>There is usually a target, and you're going <br>there, but along the way something might  <br>push you off course, and you see something <br>you think "oh wow, that's exciting!"<br>Often the scientific discoveries, the <br>meandering path of adventure and misadventures.<br>I think it's the same as any <br>creative endeavor, you know<br>we're generating knowledge, we're <br>doing things for the first time,  <br>it's not going to be easy or <br>necessarily straightforward.<br>And to be honest I still find it really amazing  <br>now even after you know 20 years <br>of being aware of these materials<br>When we take our atomic force microscopy <br>images or the electron microscope,  <br>when you see things that you <br>shouldn't really be able to see right<br>like they're below what our <br>eyes can see by quite a margin<br>It's really exciting when <br>you do see it all together.<br>It can be sometimes multiple data <br>sets that come together and give  <br>you that moment where you really <br>feel like you understand something.</p></main><footer style="margin-top: 2rem; background: #0001; padding: 2rem; text-align: center;"><p>We Are The University</p><ul style="list-style-type: none; padding: 0; margin: 0;"><li><a href="/">Home</a></li><li><a href="/about">About</a></li><li><a href="/contact">Contact</a></li></ul></footer></body></html>
