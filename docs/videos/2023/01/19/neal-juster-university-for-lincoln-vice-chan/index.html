clearly<br>is uh I did my first inaugural lecture<br>in 1996.<br>and I thought the easy thing to do would<br>be to just dig that inaugural lecture<br>out<br>and just use it this evening the trouble<br>is it's on three and a half inch<br>floppies and I couldn't find a machine<br>that could read them also inaugural<br>electors usually talk about research uh<br>because it's usually it's usually a mark<br>of someone being elevated to the rank of<br>Professor and that's usually based on<br>the fact they've done some great<br>research in their life and they usually<br>talk about their research the last time<br>I really did any real research was<br>probably 20 years ago and the stuff that<br>was researched then is not researched<br>now so what I thought I would do is try<br>and take it to a very rapid history of<br>the development of universities in<br>particularly England although we'll<br>reference some of the UK<br>and sort of my role in their development<br>if that sounds rather Grand but how how<br>I have gone through the system as the<br>system has developed and the lessons<br>I've learned<br>and then why I am very proud and humbled<br>to be the guardian of the University of<br>Lincoln uh for the next well I don't<br>know how long to keep me before they<br>kick me out but I've been here a year so<br>that's not too bad uh and the the the<br>talk is titled the university for<br>Lincoln because it is a is as we'll see<br>towards the end of the lecture is what I<br>believe this University is here for and<br>then as it says there the how I got here<br>and the why I think I'm the appropriate<br>person to be leading the University<br>for this next few years of of our<br>history to be the guardian<br>so I'm going to talk a little bit about<br>myself if you come here from a sort of<br>rag to riches story and how the the poor<br>boy did good it's disappointing I<br>recognized myself I've I've come from a<br>very privileged position position which<br>I will talk a little bit about I'm<br>clearly white I'm clearly male uh I've I<br>recognize that that has given me some<br>advantages in life that many others<br>don't have and I was born to a pretty<br>middle class family so uh bearing that<br>in mind we'll we'll rush through uh say<br>the history of of English universities<br>and how how things have developed as<br>I've been part of that system and what<br>I've learned that I think I've brought<br>to this role today is vice Chancellor<br>here<br>so<br>a bit of History uh many of you in the<br>room are from Lincoln or know Lincoln<br>very well uh in in 1068 a Newcastle<br>appeared on the top of the hill in<br>doesn't want to talk to me<br>oh in 1072 Lincoln Cathedral got was<br>started to build and then in 1088 the<br>University of Bologna was formed in<br>Italy<br>and the University of Bologna is thought<br>to be or is accepted to be the oldest<br>continuously operating University in the<br>Western World so nearly a thousand years<br>old<br>but what is a university and here I've<br>put a definition up it's a basically<br>Institute of higher education usually<br>comprising of blah blah blah<br>and having the authority to confer<br>degrees<br>that doesn't so tell you very much it's<br>like looking up what is a shop and it<br>tells you in the dictionary it's a<br>building or part of a building where<br>goods or services are sold but that<br>doesn't really tell you the difference<br>between what marks and Spencer's is from<br>Little from the the shops the top of the<br>vailgate they are all shops but they're<br>all very different<br>and the same is true for universities<br>but in England and Wales you cannot be a<br>university unless you have been approved<br>by the privy Council now many of you may<br>know what the privy council is or many<br>of you may not have known what the privy<br>council is and privy council is until a<br>couple of weeks ago when King Charles<br>III was proclaimed and that was done by<br>the privy Council things have to get up<br>to there before you can call yourself a<br>university<br>but there although I'm talking about<br>English universities and Western<br>universities it's clear that university<br>did university did sort of exist in some<br>form rather particularly in Africa and<br>Asia before bologna was formed they just<br>haven't they didn't survive in<br>continuous form and of course there were<br>seats of Higher Learning or at least<br>aspects of Higher Learning in ancient<br>times as well<br>but Western universities have evolved<br>from medieval uh Cathedral schools and<br>in fact there was a medieval Cathedral<br>School in Lincoln<br>where they educated monks and Clerks but<br>the the transition from that to being a<br>university really was uh characterized<br>by a few of these things and some of<br>these things maybe characterize us today<br>so they accepted Scholars from overseas<br>so they started the international<br>student to demand<br>they were self-governing corporations<br>and when they're formed of men<br>they received their Charters from<br>someone of higher authority a pope a<br>they were not allowed to teach atheism<br>atheism or heresy<br>students are Masters elected their own<br>uh boss I the vice Chancellor I don't<br>think that's a good idea but there we go<br>uh<br>but they had to charge fees the Masters<br>had to charge fees to to the students to<br>finance uh themselves and because of<br>that they were subject to market demand<br>so if they weren't providing the service<br>that was needed people would up and go<br>somewhere else and go to another<br>University<br>so the first University that thought to<br>or is known to have existed in the UK<br>and in England was of course the<br>University of Oxford that was founded<br>around about 1096 no one's really sure<br>and the interesting thing is that the<br>charter for the University of Oxford was<br>actually awarded after the Royal Charter<br>for the University of Cambridge<br>but the University of Cambridge was<br>founded in in 1209<br>and that was because some of the<br>scholars in Oxford had fallen out with<br>the townspeople in fact they've been uh<br>a woman who had been something that<br>happened and the townsfolk got rather<br>upset about it and in fact they actually<br>hung three of the scholars and some of<br>the scholars thought that wasn't a great<br>idea and they would like to go somewhere<br>else so they dispersed some went to<br>reading some went to Paris some went uh<br>went to Cambridge and in fact eventually<br>there was enough of a critical mass in<br>Cambridge for the University of<br>Oxford really did uh grow quite<br>significantly uh in the in the 1200s uh<br>sorry<br>uh when uh students were banned from<br>going to Paris where Paris was also seen<br>as a good suit of learning<br>so there were no more new universities<br>in England until the 1800s<br>so why was that well one reason in fact<br>they tried to set up a university in<br>Stanford<br>in about 12 it's only about 13 33<br>but Oxford and Cambridge were so upset<br>about that they would devalue the value<br>of their degrees that they petitioned uh<br>to King Edward III to stop the<br>university being formed and Edward the<br>third Jason you can't have a university<br>there and in fact they passed into law<br>that there could be no other<br>universities in England for well it<br>wasn't it wasn't overturned until the<br>1800s<br>meanwhile there were universities being<br>formed in Scotland so Saint Andrews in<br>1410 Glasgow in 1451 Aberdeen 1495<br>Edinburgh 1583 Marshall College in 1593<br>and Marshall College actually merged<br>with Aberdeen University in 1860. so<br>there there is England with two<br>universities in Scotland with five<br>so these universities really are still<br>going along the up up until uh the 1800s<br>they are still on the same lines of uh<br>monks and clerics being educated by men<br>but it became clear that uh<br>this thing isn't working wonderfully<br>well uh that that the the education has<br>been provided wasn't wonderfully well<br>accepted and in fact uh Spencer Walpole<br>writing in the late 19th century said<br>that few medical men few Scholars<br>solicitors few persons intended for<br>Commerce or trade ever dreamed of<br>passing through a University career<br>and he quoted from that a a sentence<br>that was actually from the Oxford<br>University's own commission's report on<br>the reform of Oxford University that<br>said the education imparted Oxford was<br>not such as the conduce to the<br>environment of in life of many persons<br>except those intended for the ministry<br>so there's that's where we are in<br>England somewhere in the mid middle<br>1800s<br>meanwhile back in Europe other things<br>are happening so the Renaissance has<br>happened and universities start to begin<br>to teach culture Civility and public<br>affairs a couple of centuries later the<br>Age of Enlightenment happens and the<br>university actually start to move from<br>regurgitation of knowledge to the<br>encouragement of productive thinking<br>but one of the really big changes came<br>with William Van Von<br>Humboldt who he visited students being<br>part of the learning itself<br>now although his name has is is referred<br>to a lot in the universe in fact they've<br>renamed University in Germany after him<br>he was only actually imposed as a<br>minister in Germany for one year and he<br>managed to effect quite a lot of reform<br>and what this is a quote from him he<br>says just as primary instruction makes a<br>teacher possible so he renders himself<br>dispensable through schooling at the<br>secondary level the university teacher<br>is thus no longer a teacher and the<br>student is no longer a pupil instead the<br>student conducts research on his own<br>behalf and Professor supervises his<br>research and supports him in it quite<br>gendered language there but they were<br>all men of these universities so they<br>and this this was a change from the uh<br>basic regurgitation of the knowledge<br>that was happening in in these sort of<br>medieval universities and finally<br>the UK starts to England starts to catch<br>up and In 1832 the University of Durham<br>is founded really along the same lines<br>as Austin Cambridge is still a religious<br>organization<br>but then something happens in around<br>1813 the history is rather rather vague<br>but certainly the University of London<br>was formed in 1836 but it was formed<br>from two colleges the University College<br>of London that formed around 1826 and<br>King's College London in 1829<br>now University College London really<br>caused a storm because they allowed<br>people to enter the university that were<br>not of Anglican origin they didn't have<br>to have any faith and they could have<br>other faiths and this was seen as a<br>really bad thing at the time it was<br>completely against the model that was<br>going on uh within within England and<br>actually to sort of<br>just calm down some of the activity that<br>was going on people being upset about<br>this new University<br>they bought King's College uh into light<br>into the University of London as well<br>and the King's College was actually more<br>a religious organization<br>uh and in fact there was a quote from<br>the time when when UCL was formed is the<br>storms of opposition which raged around<br>it threatened to crush the very spark of<br>vital energy which remained so Kings was<br>was brought in to sort of create a<br>balance in the system<br>so here we are with universities and now<br>I'm not going to go through every single<br>University that's that was formed in<br>Lincoln would be glad to know I hope I<br>don't want to bore you that much so now<br>start to group them so coming into into<br>the early 20th century the the red brick<br>universes were formed that were founded<br>to really teach real world schools to<br>their students and this was mainly<br>around engineering and and the big<br>cities you know Bristol uh Birmingham<br>Liverpool Leeds Sheffield<br>Etc uh<br>formed these universities<br>and they're called red brick<br>universities because if you've ever been<br>to any of these universities that most<br>of them their Regional Buildings are<br>basically made of red brick<br>but then there was a second wave<br>really really after the first World War<br>uh trying to uh<br>again expand uh education because the<br>government was concerned to see more<br>school leavers attend University<br>and these this set of universities<br>reading and Nottingham Etc really<br>evolved from colleges that were already<br>preparing University for Universe<br>degrees under university of London<br>conditions so the university understand<br>the exams but these organizations uh<br>actually taught the students and then<br>they said it's based on external exams<br>so there we are in uh<br>1950s and then in the late 1950s the<br>University's grants committee which used<br>to be the committee was a forerunner of<br>the higher education funding Council<br>which is a forerunner of ofs and other<br>institutions in between created some<br>brand new universities and I've listened<br>to them here two have got asterisks of<br>against them because they weren't<br>actually created a Benicio Newcastle was<br>actually the Newcastle Campus of the<br>Durham University so that became a<br>university and cool University came out<br>of a college in in Staffordshire where<br>they'd already managed to get themselves<br>degree awarding Powers but they weren't<br>called University but these universities<br>were set up and importantly so up until<br>now if you went to University you paid<br>for your education<br>and around about the late 1950s there<br>was an introduction of grants for<br>tuition fees<br>so students could attend University<br>without having to pay to be there<br>one of the other changes that happened<br>when UCL was was founded in particular<br>the red brick universities up until that<br>time all University of the universe were<br>basically residential so you went to the<br>university and you you lived in the<br>college<br>to do your studies whereas UCL started<br>to allow people in where you didn't<br>actually have to be in Residence as you<br>were being taught<br>so then then there is a momentous<br>occasion<br>which is so momentous it won't go onto<br>it I was born<br>in 1961.<br>now at this time then there were 16<br>universities in in England<br>probably graduating 25<br>000 students every year so I was born to<br>Peter and joy that you could think you<br>probably guess who Peter isn't who joins<br>in that photograph<br>uh both left school uh early my father<br>left school at 14 because they couldn't<br>afford to to pay for him to go to school<br>and his father had passed away and he<br>needs to go to work<br>he went to a school called rutlish uh in<br>in South London some of you may have<br>heard of about this because one of his<br>claim to fame is John Major went there a<br>few years after my dad<br>and my mother left school at 16 and went<br>into nursing until she married<br>and it was only when my father passed<br>away<br>so those who have gone through the<br>process of losing your parents and<br>having to clear out the house that<br>they've lived in for many years as you<br>come across an awful lot of things<br>and it was only at that point<br>that I recognized uh the talent of my<br>father had so become a probation officer<br>he was pretty good at it<br>for a very personable very social person<br>and very caring person but his reports<br>from Ratliff schools that I that were in<br>a box that I found were absolutely<br>outstanding<br>so he probably could have gone on to<br>University and done great things had he<br>had the opportunity and it wasn't until<br>the early sorry the early 2000s when he<br>passed away that I knew that and<br>recognized just how much uh how much<br>he'd given me but how much he could have<br>had had he lived in a different time my<br>mother I don't think was quite so<br>academic but she was definitely someone<br>who kept the family together and really<br>for most of my life was a house what I<br>think was called a housewife at the time<br>but was working part-time to ensure her<br>children and there were three of us<br>actually<br>did well in life and in fact I was the<br>oldest of the three<br>so having got by the way when it goes to<br>light blue we're talking about me when<br>it stays white we're talking about the<br>university system isn't that clever<br>so<br>63 then there's the Robin's report and<br>uh he recommends and this committee<br>recommends there should be an immediate<br>expansion of universities and the<br>universe is listed there were basically<br>all technical colleges or colleges of<br>advanced technology<br>so most of them have got quite good<br>reputations in engineering and<br>but what the uh what what the report<br>also said was that places at University<br>should be available to those who are<br>qualified by ability and attainment so<br>the system should expand to allow those<br>that would have the ability the ability<br>to do well at University to get there<br>and another recommendation was made was<br>that they were formed the national uh<br>the Council of national academic Awards<br>which basically allowed colleges Fe<br>colleges and and became polytechnics to<br>award degrees under the auspices of a<br>national body rather than having to rely<br>on their local University or university<br>further away to accredit the degree that<br>they had<br>so that also expanded a degree provision<br>in places that were not called<br>he also started to say some other or the<br>report also said smart thing so this is<br>Maybe<br>the first government intervention into<br>what universities should be doing<br>so these four things here that<br>University we should be teaching<br>skills<br>we should be teaching the promotions the<br>general promotion power to the mind so<br>as not to produce Specialists but rather<br>cultivated men and women and I'm sure we<br>still do that<br>they need to maintain the balance<br>between research and teaching because<br>with you cannot separate the advancement<br>of learning from the truth<br>and need to transmit a common culture<br>and common standards of citizenship so<br>it wasn't just about learning an<br>academic subject University should also<br>so obviously this is the first in my<br>view this is the first time when<br>government starts to tell universities a<br>little bit about how they should be<br>teaching<br>right back to me uh so I go to a a small<br>Primary School a country called modern<br>procure single entry primary school and<br>then I went on to a school called<br>Emmanuel near Clapham Junction<br>Wandsworth one of the claims to fames<br>for uh Emmanuel scores in fact uh that's<br>where Tim berners-lee went those of you<br>know the man who invented or started the<br>internet but he apparently left the<br>school in 73 just as I arrived so I<br>guess I never met him I certainly don't<br>remember ever meeting him<br>uh why do I put this up because these<br>schools were not the natural choices<br>from where I lived my parents made an<br>effort to get me into these schools and<br>11 plus the time the primary school was<br>well known for getting quite a lot of<br>its its levers past 11 plus and then uh<br>Emmanuel School happens to be a uh a<br>selective Grant maintained all boys<br>school<br>but that hasn't affected me so that's<br>all right<br>foreign<br>so<br>one of the things about Emmanuel school<br>being a sort of all boys sort of grammar<br>school is every year someone from the<br>armed forces would come along and<br>have a talk and I always wanted to fly<br>helicopters<br>so this this I don't know what he was<br>probably a lieutenant command from the<br>Royal Navy turns up and I say I want to<br>fly helicopters and he said oh no you<br>don't do that you'll be you'll be<br>finished by the time you're 35 what you<br>want to do is engineering you're doing<br>math physics and chemistry you'd be a<br>fantastic engineer so I bought that<br>which is actually quite lucky because it<br>turns out I'm colorblind so I couldn't<br>eventually flown helicopters anyway so I<br>ended up uh becoming an engineering<br>officer under training in the Royal Navy<br>so I've spent the first year at<br>Dartmouth and on ships and then they<br>sponsored me to go to university which<br>happened to be as Andrew said the<br>University of Leeds where I did<br>mechanical engineering BSC and then PhD<br>and<br>then comes the interesting bit is like<br>many PhD students I and I was a well fun<br>well firstly I did better in my<br>undergraduate degree than I thought I<br>was going to do Heaven's how I performed<br>at school I wasn't the worst person in<br>the class but I wasn't I wasn't the<br>highest ranked person in the class<br>I ended up getting a first class degree<br>but also I was doing a five-year project<br>in Computing computer Aid design and<br>this is the time when you it took sort<br>of 10 minutes to refresh a computer<br>screen when you type something in uh<br>whilst I was there the department<br>upgraded the Mainframe computer from<br>four megabytes to eight megabytes core<br>memory and it cost an arm and a leg and<br>everyone was really excited about it so<br>that's that's the sort of thing I was<br>working on and I really enjoyed my<br>family a project my tutor said uh how<br>about you do a PhD with me and we can<br>fund you and I said but I'm in the Navy<br>and I've I've committed to this and I'm<br>gonna have to pay my way out and he said<br>don't worry about that we'll find a way<br>to fund you so I was actually quite a<br>well-funded undergraduate both because I<br>had a grant and because I had a bit of a<br>salary I was in a pretty well funded PhD<br>student so I've not really suffered any<br>hardships that some students I know<br>suffer today<br>uh but then I get to uh Hey 87 when I<br>should have finished my PhD after three<br>years and in those days if you finished<br>a PhD in three years you probably<br>weren't doing a proper job and if it<br>took you eight years you're probably<br>about right uh but I get to three years<br>my funding runs out and there happens to<br>be a a bit of a uh<br>teaching requirement in the department<br>and would I've been prepared to do it<br>well I need the money so yes I'll have a<br>go that so I started teaching a bit of<br>design<br>uh and then I thought I'd better be a<br>bit nice and just stay on a little while<br>so they made me a lecturer and as you<br>can see from that graphic I stayed on<br>rather longer than just the year I<br>thought I would to be polite uh but a<br>couple of things happened uh at that<br>point I I guess uh<br>first of all one of my two T's went and<br>got a job in one of the big four<br>Consulting companies and a salary that<br>was more than I was on<br>so I thought well blow that so I applied<br>for the job as well and was offered it<br>uh uh but the trouble was I was nearly<br>30 at this time and there were all these<br>21 year olds who have gone to this<br>consulting company I thought I'm not<br>sure I can keep up with them on a night<br>out uh although I could have given it a<br>go but also to other things happened uh<br>one was I I applied for and got a Esso<br>scholarship at the time essay were very<br>concerned that there weren't enough<br>Engineers being graduate staying on to<br>educate the Next Generation so they paid<br>a quite a handsome salary or a stipend<br>to go on top of your salary and also I<br>got a double increment from the<br>University so I actually ended up on a<br>relatively much better salary than I had<br>before<br>the other thing is the job that I had<br>was what was known as a new blood<br>leadership<br>so uh as you saw from this expansion of<br>of uh<br>universities in the UK there was this<br>big expansion in the 60s and they're not<br>very much happened after that and quite<br>a lot of the staff who joined the<br>universities in the 60s and 70s were<br>reaching retirement age and there hadn't<br>been anybody else coming up so the<br>government actually put something called<br>a new blood leadership post and where<br>you could apply to government and the<br>university would get these these uh<br>lectures and I got one of those in in<br>manufacturing and Design<br>which was which was pretty helpful uh to<br>me in fact the day<br>you should probably if if you'll<br>probably will pass this point now but<br>but never go from being a student in a<br>department to being a lecturer in that<br>department and then you understand the<br>dark arts of an exam board<br>uh and and wonder how how you end up<br>with the grades that you've got but<br>there we go uh<br>the other thing that that uh uh I should<br>say probably is that in my time at the<br>University I I did a lot of sport and<br>Rowing and uh uh I met my my wife in the<br>Rowan Club as well uh submitted my PhD<br>on the 1st of September 1988 and got<br>married uh 15 days later so<br>probably done that the right way around<br>so<br>what were the lessons I'd got from being<br>in the education system to date<br>uh and I think I've sort of indicated<br>this in what I've been saying is is that<br>supportive and interested parents uh can<br>make a real big difference uh to your<br>life<br>good and engaging teachers make a big<br>difference it was a teacher in pure math<br>that got me into understanding what the<br>university might be and that I might be<br>okay doing engineering at that<br>University<br>students want to do more than a degree<br>they want a good social and life outside<br>of the classroom and most importantly if<br>you have education it opens up more<br>choices for you these are these aren't<br>remarkable things for you to know but at<br>the time they were things that I was<br>learning as I was going through the<br>system<br>so as I said I stayed<br>in uh uh in the department and the<br>design office<br>this isn't a picture of it look<br>something like that there are 80<br>big drawing boards in a big room on the<br>top floor well-lit floor but it looked<br>like that by the time I'd left the<br>University of Leeds it looked something<br>like that I.E the drawing boards had all<br>disappeared and computers had taken<br>place<br>now<br>one of the things about this is the<br>people who were teaching design<br>were were probably the age I am now the<br>drawings that they did in design were<br>absolutely their works of art fantastic<br>you could tell who had done which<br>drawing by looking at the piece of paper<br>you then introduced into a cad system<br>where everything looks exactly the same<br>and they're not happy<br>they've taken away a skill from them<br>even though the school really is to<br>communicate a design they were unhappy<br>so actually getting from these I was<br>given the challenge of going from the<br>picture on the left to the picture on<br>the other thing I was given was that<br>when I teach one of the first year<br>classes in Statics which is one of the<br>big mechanics one of the big things you<br>have to do in engineering having been in<br>that same classroom about seven years<br>earlier uh I so I spent a year being<br>just one chapter ahead of the students<br>which seemed to have worked but nobody<br>taught me how to teach<br>I did try I did talk to a few people<br>about trying new methods I remember<br>being in a lecturer with the old<br>overhead projector on it and the the the<br>the the pen written slides and people<br>have been written the year before<br>they've been written before the lecture<br>and of course one smart guy says should<br>that not be a minor sign in that<br>equation so not to me this is when I was<br>a student should that not be a minor<br>sign sir and he said yeah good point<br>someone pointed it out last year as well<br>ah so I tried to I tried to teach a bit<br>differently from that but I wasn't<br>really given any instruction on how to<br>so so the research I was doing was<br>something called constructive solid<br>modeling which was<br>producing three it's only a 2d on here<br>but basically producing a computer<br>representation of a 3D object and it's<br>called constructive solid modeling<br>because you've got two shapes like this<br>there are three things you can do with<br>it<br>you can intersect them you can add them<br>you can subtract one from the other of<br>course you can do this subtract the<br>other way so there's four four things<br>you can do there and that if if you do<br>this enough times with enough shapes you<br>can end up with very complex products<br>and the question you're asking the<br>computer is it is this point in space<br>actually a solid or open air<br>it's a very simple question to ask but<br>in these days it was a very difficult<br>question to answer in a way that was<br>robust and you always got the right<br>answer but once you can answer that<br>question you can do all sorts of things<br>like Drive Machine Tools work out<br>volumes workout density and then even<br>move on to things like a finer element<br>so one thing that also happened whilst I<br>was doing research was was the Advent of<br>uh additive manufacturing rapid<br>prototyping and the very first machines<br>in stereotography cost somewhere in in<br>the region of 250 000 pounds and now you<br>can buy a thing that lays out plastic<br>like this one here for a couple of<br>hundred quid and you can attest to your<br>computer if you want<br>so you can so you have machines that<br>could produce 3D objects really quite<br>quickly and quite complex objects that<br>one there's not<br>but you've also got<br>things like this where you've got uh<br>x-ray machines or CT scanners that can<br>also produce solids<br>and we did some research although the<br>paper wasn't it wasn't peer-reviewed and<br>published where a medical physicist a<br>surgeon an engineer computer science<br>worked on this problem and the surgeon<br>had a very extensive reconstruction to<br>do on a hip<br>and we we took the we took this isn't<br>the scan we took the scan we made the<br>hip he then put it onto a bench he sawed<br>it up we put screws in and then he went<br>to the patient and did the real thing<br>and he reckons that the time spent in<br>the operating theater was about five<br>hours less than had he not had the<br>practice beforehand<br>and that five hours is extremely<br>expensive to operate so we did all this<br>for free but if if it paid for it a<br>commercial waste it wouldn't have been<br>that much money compared to five hours<br>in the operating theater<br>but what you couldn't do is divert the<br>budget from the money saved from the<br>five hours the operating theater to do<br>this sort of stuff and I think that's<br>still a problem in many systems is you<br>can't move the budget around to get a<br>more efficient system<br>another learning point so what did I<br>learn from my time at least firstly<br>we're trying to do the uh the introduce<br>new computer design system into the<br>department is that change is not an easy<br>process<br>then quite a few things about research<br>research can have a real impact and in<br>my view the research that has the most<br>impact is multi-disciplinary you have to<br>bring people from different backgrounds<br>together and do it as in the example of<br>the hip reconstructive surgery it wasn't<br>done by an engineer it wasn't done by a<br>surgeon wasn't done by a medical<br>physicist it was done by a group of<br>people working together to solve the<br>problem<br>research can generate valuable IP the<br>solid modeling system I talked about was<br>actually commercialized uh was actually<br>used for a few years bought some income<br>into the department met the professor my<br>actually was my supervisor in my PhD uh<br>did quite a bit of money out of it but<br>absolutely the the change from the<br>drawing boards to the cad system was<br>actually part funded by the IP office<br>off of that research<br>but the other the big loading point for<br>me is that research the best researchers<br>are absolutely driven it is their life<br>they will work every hour they've got<br>they will seek every Avenue to get the<br>funding to do the research that really<br>but what also happens is that good<br>departments<br>aren't necessarily don't necessarily<br>have good leadership so when I was at<br>Leeds it was the very in 1986 was it 80s<br>yeah I think it was 80<br>86 was uh was the first implementation<br>of what has become the research<br>excellent framework and Leeds did really<br>really well they were amongst the best<br>uh mechanical engineering schools in the<br>country in terms of their research<br>they've got the top rating I remember<br>bath and Imperial being up there as well<br>but but Leeds were very good but from<br>the inside it looked great from the<br>outside but from the inside I didn't<br>think it was a particularly well run it<br>didn't give a particularly good student<br>experience it did things it wasted<br>resources didn't make good planning<br>decisions<br>what I also discovered is I was never<br>going to be that great researcher I<br>wasn't driven enough<br>by the research for me to be great<br>but what I did think I was good at and<br>maybe that goes back to my my short time<br>in the Navy was that I could contribute<br>to management or leadership<br>so there I was in a in a a department<br>that had I think eight professors<br>the chance of me getting Professor was<br>in that school was probably minimal I<br>thought I could do better at management<br>and this job came up at strathclyde uh<br>University as I had a school and I<br>applied for that and for some reason<br>they gave me the job well we'll return<br>to that in a second<br>let's go back to universities in 1990<br>the further and Higher Education Act<br>allowed polytechnics to become<br>universities<br>and in 1992 32 new universities were<br>formed in<br>England<br>in 1997 the Deering report was published<br>the official title Nash Committee of<br>inquiry into higher education it made 93<br>recommendations don't worry I'm not<br>going to go through all of them just 92<br>of them<br>uh<br>one recommendation was that so up<br>between the early 60s till now<br>you got you've got a grant to go to<br>university Deering said we must change<br>the way in which universities are funded<br>we must move from Grants to some tuition<br>fees where the cost is shared between<br>the individual and the state<br>and then going back to my point about my<br>attempts of trying to teach Statics as a<br>young lecturer is also propose that that<br>teaching staff should have some amount<br>of training and of course this is follow<br>through through to higher education<br>academies Etc and the fact that most<br>universities now won't accept too on the<br>teaching staff unless they go through<br>they said that credit earned at one<br>institution should be able to be<br>transferred to another and that does<br>exist but I don't think that's taken off<br>in the way that Deering envisaged uh<br>very few students start at one<br>University and go to another although<br>some do very few do<br>and also thought that there should be an<br>expansion of sub degree programs in<br>school so things in universities didn't<br>actually lead to a bachelor's degree<br>that would give you things like diplomas<br>uh and they felt there was a market<br>demand for it I'm not sure that<br>universities have seen that demand or<br>have actually structured themselves<br>greatly to follow that recommendation<br>although we hear of course I think<br>they're doing things like<br>apprenticeships now but for up until<br>recent years that didn't happen<br>and then post 2000 big expansion<br>university colleges and other higher<br>education assessments became<br>universities uh in 2004 you couldn't be<br>a university unless you're also doing<br>doctorates they dropped that<br>recommendation<br>you needed also to have 4 000 FTE on<br>your books 3 000 of which should be on<br>degree courses in 2012 they dropped that<br>to a thousand with 750. in 2015 the<br>numbers change from a minimum of 55 on<br>degree courses and after that they've<br>made it easier for private providers to<br>enter the market<br>so now there are 106 English<br>universities so when I was born there<br>were six 16 17 now there's 106.<br>there are actually nine universities in<br>Wales two in Northern Ireland and 15 in<br>Scotland so overall there's 132 in the<br>UK<br>so<br>returning to me I applied for this job<br>at strathclyde was head of Department<br>desired manufacturer Engineering<br>Management great title<br>and it was it was called the divisions<br>of design manufacture and Engineering<br>Management<br>and boy were they properly named they<br>were divisions<br>so much so that the professor of weather<br>divisions refused to speak to the<br>professor who charged our division<br>unless there was a lawyer in the room<br>they didn't tell me this interview but<br>when I turned up I was the second<br>youngest member of academic staff<br>doesn't necessarily say that I was<br>particularly young at the time maybe<br>says more about the age of the others<br>uh within my first six months I'd had to<br>deal with someone who was transitioning<br>gender<br>someone who had been accused of sexual<br>violence on a departmental night out and<br>someone who had been caught with<br>basically with their hand in the tool<br>take making orders on the University<br>purchasing system and having stuff<br>delivered to their health<br>that was in my first three months<br>uh I inherited a manufacturing course in<br>the manufacturing division that had 110<br>students entry and three years later<br>there were none<br>so<br>quite quite a bit of loading going on<br>quite quickly for me though then I<br>became dean of engineering and that was<br>a strange post because the dean was<br>basically elected<br>by all the faculty in the in the well it<br>was all the academic staff in the<br>faculty of engineering and usually it<br>went to someone who was from one of the<br>two big department of electrical and<br>mechanical because they had the voter<br>booth<br>was actually quite a small school but<br>for some I wrote a really rubbish<br>looking back I can't find that but I<br>remember the time I wrote a really<br>rubbish sort of uh Manifesto why they<br>should elect me but I did get elected<br>and then uh four years later the<br>stratified this trained Senate system<br>where uh the there was the prince the<br>principal and then the deputy principal<br>was called the pro was called the vice<br>vice principle and underneath them was<br>the pro vice principal so Senate elected<br>someone to become the pro vice principal<br>and after two years they automatically<br>came the vice principal and then two<br>years after that they didn't have a job<br>so there's me<br>uh 2006-2007 as the pro vice principal<br>at Straz Clyde I've learned a few more<br>things<br>dean of engineering is one of the<br>largest engineering schools in in the UK<br>not the largest one of the biggest ones<br>again it was full of siled units trying<br>to get the Departments to talk to each<br>other was quite difficult<br>having the<br>you may or may not know for design<br>manufacturing Engineering Management<br>would have gone should have gone into a<br>ref return or the re return whatever's<br>called that point under mechanical<br>engineering but they wouldn't have us<br>because we weren't good enough and we<br>weren't the right sort of people so we<br>had to be submitted as a subunit and<br>they were probably right because I think<br>they got a four and we got a 3B as the<br>scales were then but actually that was<br>an improvement for quite a big<br>Improvement for us<br>but those battles were really quite<br>intense<br>so there's me being dean of engineering<br>become Pro vice principal got a<br>three-year Horizon and I will be back to<br>becoming a professor and I wouldn't even<br>be head of school I'd be back to<br>becoming a professor in uh the<br>department as I've told you before I<br>wasn't driven by research I was being<br>paid a reasonable salary at this point<br>compared to the general professors in<br>the in the school so I would have been a<br>a I could have taught for them but it<br>would have been a burden on their in<br>their pay<br>with our payline so I was looking for<br>something else to do and what came up<br>was was a post as vice principal at the<br>University of Glasgow and Australian<br>resources which I applied for because<br>someone from Stratford had gone there as<br>a secretary of the university and<br>suggested I should apply we'll come back<br>again we'll come back to that in a<br>minute<br>so what lessons did I learned at<br>strathclyde firstly They Don't Really<br>teach you management and Leadership on<br>courses you only get it by being amongst<br>everything and understanding that things<br>don't always go to plan<br>that student demand and employer demand<br>aren't always in sync as in<br>manufacturing<br>leaders should be appointed not a letter<br>although I although I was elected twice<br>to post<br>as I was Dean of engineering I tried to<br>stop elections to head to school because<br>I didn't feel that the elected post was<br>actually doing good for the schools and<br>we've had this continual debate about<br>whether a heads of school should be<br>permanent should they should be<br>rotational but electing them I think is<br>a pretty poor way of coming up with<br>people who can actually make decisions<br>and leave places in the right right<br>situation and even universities need a<br>strategy<br>you need to know where you're going and<br>at this point in the cycle in in the<br>1990s early 2000s University were<br>writing strategies for the funding<br>Council the funding Council would accept<br>them and they go into a draw so say all<br>the wonderful things but no one took any<br>round out this time we're back to Brown<br>the brown review of 2010 independent<br>review of higher education funding and<br>student finance to give it its full<br>title it recommended another sweeping<br>reform of Finance including the removal<br>of the cap of the fees but interestingly<br>it also found that potentially students<br>need better information on teaching<br>experience that they can expect on their<br>different courses and that<br>recommendation can can be traced the<br>fact that the the turf the teaching<br>excellent framework started in 2018 so<br>it took about eight years but I think<br>that's the recommendation that got us<br>there so again more more management or<br>more uh regulation of universities more<br>Performance Management of universities<br>how are you doing on Research was in 86<br>how are you doing in teaching uh this<br>year so over my lifetime then and this<br>is this is from the House of Commons<br>Library we've gone from 16 to 109<br>universities and from approximately 25<br>000 graduates a year to over 350<br>000 graduates a year a huge expansion<br>and a huge number of changes going on in<br>the system<br>so I then go to Glasgow University from<br>strathclyde as the vice principal for<br>strategy and resources I kept that title<br>really until I left although for the<br>last five years I was or more I was<br>Deputy Vice Chancellor there was only<br>one Deputy Vice Chancellor was a 50 the<br>number two of the University<br>over that time<br>I've led the consultation and<br>publication of three University<br>strategies I'm not going to go into all<br>of these uh any of them really they all<br>of them talk about improving processes<br>and systems as you would do all talk<br>about fantastic teaching and excellent<br>research but the first one Glasgow 2020<br>at global vision was was absolutely<br>aimed at growing glasgow's uh<br>International reputation and I would say<br>looking back from from now to then that<br>actually worked the second one was more<br>about developing the people and the<br>estate and again I would say looking<br>back that has worked<br>and then the one that was written just<br>before and I wrote it and got it<br>published as before I left uh was World<br>Changers together which is concentrating<br>more on the University's Civic mission<br>now clearly what you can learn from all<br>those three strategies is you can't have<br>a good strategy without a tower on the<br>cover<br>so there's an awful lot I did in those<br>time and I haven't got time to go<br>through it but there's a couple of<br>things I think are worth sharing<br>firstly is the second strategy was all<br>about developing the estate and we we<br>inherited or we bought back the<br>hospitals next to University uh which is<br>this area here so that area is the old<br>hospital site as it was in 2016.<br>that is the artist's impression of what<br>the University was going to do with that<br>site and that's about a one billion<br>development with all the maintenance<br>going on the rest of the University over<br>so a big big that is the site in uh 2019<br>so the first building with the new<br>teaching building is already on the top<br>middle left here with the sort of crane<br>thing coming out the top the the<br>concrete bit in the middle bottom is the<br>new multi-disciplinary research Hub now<br>called the advanced Research Center that<br>was 29 and this is a picture that I<br>managed to get from a couple of weeks<br>ago he says from a different perspective<br>if it would load<br>uh so you've got the the middle of the<br>screen there is the big multiplication<br>research building that was opened uh<br>earlier this year to the left is the new<br>business school to the right is a new<br>Institute for health and well-being<br>they're the first three buildings on<br>that site of new Public Square New<br>access into the site new new big<br>entrances to University from one the<br>south side of the University<br>so I was involved in planning what was<br>going to go there quite happy with what<br>they're doing very jealous being here<br>oh right Glasgow I was going on in<br>Glasgow what's the shipbuild of the<br>world in the early 1900s it built more<br>than 20 of the world's shipping<br>today<br>there are three shipyards two of which<br>are building uh military ships mainly<br>for the Royal Navy but for others as<br>well and one Fergusons you may have<br>heard of building two ferries that are<br>currently five years late and double the<br>budget so Glasgow was a shipbuilding<br>sent to the world here is<br>Glasgow as it was actually the 1950 late<br>1950s it was still building about 12 13<br>of the world shipping and those blobs<br>are big engineering companies on the<br>Clyde<br>this is what the client looks like today<br>the white shape is where the university<br>is<br>and you can see all along the Clyde both<br>sides those derelict land so it's gone<br>from a thriving ship industry to a a<br>city that's had its heart ripped out of<br>it<br>and here's an interesting map it's the<br>areas of deprivation in Glasgow blue is<br>great<br>Red's not quite so good you can see<br>around where the university is it's<br>pretty blue you can see the South Side<br>River in govern is pretty red<br>so you've got go for the most advantage<br>of the least Advantage people in society<br>in about two miles and in that two miles<br>life expectancy drops by about 20 years<br>for males<br>literally across the river<br>so this this is governed it's it's been<br>been reversed on on the left-hand side<br>you've got the new Riverside Museum on<br>the right top right you've got that<br>thing that looks like it like a a star<br>is a Queen Elizabeth University Hospital<br>uh<br>and the plan was to to uh still is to<br>develop that site to provide more<br>opportunities for the local residents to<br>bring in more housing and to put a new<br>bridging that connects north and south<br>of the river at that point<br>the people are governed<br>were involved in trying to determine<br>what went on here they were told when<br>the kofta went in uh before 2016 that's<br>why the university could take the<br>offloaders because the new Hospital's<br>been built is that there would be job<br>opportunities for them when we went to<br>consult them as to how we could help<br>they said don't know why you're here<br>we've got all these promises before<br>we're told there'd be great jobs in the<br>hospital and all that's happened is it's<br>made it easier to go and visit our<br>relatives in hospital there's been no<br>economic advantage to having the<br>hospital actually on our side<br>but as a university working with the NHS<br>the council and others and the Scottish<br>government the long-term vision and in<br>consultation with uh with with the city<br>was actually to regenerate this part and<br>the bridge on the left there Walter Rowe<br>is just being built and some some of the<br>activity just below the hospital is just<br>being built so it's actually starting to<br>happen and I hope we'll see some<br>economic regeneration of that part of<br>the city<br>so what the lessons I've learned<br>what did I learn from Glasgow that you<br>need to have strategies that<br>differentiate if you do they'll need a<br>success and I would I would argue that<br>the things that Glasgow did lead to<br>success but only there's no point just<br>writing you have to concentrate on<br>implementation you've got to implement<br>it properly<br>and a phrase I'm not sure whether the<br>original phrase is culturally strategy<br>for breakfast or for lunch uh it doesn't<br>really matter it gets eaten is if if you<br>put a strategy in place that the<br>organization doesn't like they have all<br>sorts of ways to stop it happening so<br>you have to consult before the strategy<br>is written<br>and then the importance of place<br>universities should<br>be Civic anchors in their cities<br>particularly universities like Glasgow<br>and as we're coming to come on to in the<br>last few minutes is particularly also in<br>Lincoln<br>universities can make places the sort of<br>estate at the moments that have gone on<br>in Glasgow and those development here in<br>Lincoln actually shapes a city a city<br>becomes very different because you put<br>new buildings and new public roaming<br>universities can be and should be<br>engines for economic regeneration and<br>inclusive growth<br>strong delivery requires Partnerships<br>across the city but those Partnerships<br>take a long time to develop you can't<br>just phone someone up one day and say<br>hey let's do this and they'll say yes<br>you should have to spend time and effort<br>building those relationships<br>so that was me post Glasgow as Andrew<br>said I arrived here last year<br>uh let's go back to what is University<br>we've had the ref into in in 1986<br>telling us how good our research is<br>we've had the TAF in in<br>2018 telling us how good our teaching<br>should be and we're just in the middle<br>of having an implementation of the large<br>exchange framework the kef where they've<br>gone through two pilot rounds the first<br>one in 21 one this year uh they're<br>telling us how good our knowledge<br>exchange should be<br>what<br>we haven't been told to do is our Civic<br>engagement we're not measured by how<br>well we engage civically<br>how important are we to place how<br>important are we to leveling up and how<br>important are we<br>just just to the the city and the region<br>that we're in<br>leveling up is a multi this terminology<br>is almost certainly going to disappear<br>from the political language but the<br>intent won't be<br>we've moved from a place and I recognize<br>early on in this this talk I was<br>privileged I had a lot of opportunities<br>to where I can go from and it used to be<br>that who you were born to<br>has a big impact it still does has a big<br>impact of where you can get to but it's<br>also recognized where you were born has<br>a big impact now on what you can do<br>because the reason around you doesn't<br>give the opportunities approach the same<br>as not a region just down the road<br>but that's all about the housing the<br>health the education the employment<br>crime transport digital connectivity if<br>you don't get all of those things right<br>you can't provide the opportunities for<br>the citizens and we can't do that alone<br>we can only do it in Partnership and I<br>think that's what Lincoln's got and<br>that's what attracted me to the Post<br>being here in Lincoln is because we also<br>have that desire to help<br>he was in the current terminology to<br>level up we want to give people<br>opportunities<br>so you've seen this so the same as the<br>Glasgow picture this is what this site<br>looked like in the probably the late 60s<br>this is what it looks like roughly now<br>you know that Lincolnshire UK's second<br>biggest County hardly any motor with no<br>Motorway hardly any dual carriageway 1.1<br>million population most of it living in<br>rural areas compared to the rest of<br>England<br>no University before<br>and here's some pictures of deprivation<br>Etc of Lincolnshire the one on the left<br>is uh multiple deprivation green uh is<br>uh is a more Advantage dark reddish<br>least advantage and you can see the<br>cluster of that disadvantage on the<br>coastal fringes the other one is life<br>expectancy and you can see there's a<br>pretty good correlation between the like<br>the amount of time you have you have<br>expected to live compared to the social<br>deprivation that you're experiencing<br>which is not a surprise<br>and then here's another interesting one<br>on the left is people that haven't got a<br>qualification uh above nvq1 and again a<br>lot of cluster on the coast where people<br>have not got any qualifications and the<br>other one is people have got<br>qualifications above mvq5 and again the<br>light of the color is better so again<br>the darkness is along the coast in the<br>south of the county<br>so these are these are Big variations<br>within the within the county<br>also in but in Lincolnshire we've got<br>some advantages the the uh Grace<br>Lincolnshire uh local Enterprise<br>partnership has identified what they<br>think of the game changers the things<br>that we should work on to make the<br>university better sort of make the<br>county better on the right hand side is<br>a list of some of the Clusters that we<br>have here from research<br>so we may not be funded to help level up<br>and improve the community but we can our<br>teaching and research and knowledge<br>exchange can be aligned so that we are<br>we're also not just about teaching and<br>learning but also about sustainability<br>and these un sustainability goals we can<br>map our activity onto these and we are<br>helping all these the things we do and<br>the research we do are helping all these<br>girls so this is another way at viewing<br>a university rather than just how good<br>is it at teaching how good is it a<br>research how good it is about addressing<br>the sustainability goals that are<br>so all of this has led to a strategy<br>that was published uh<br>in July 2020-27 strategy it has these<br>three themes we will collaborate<br>with each other with our Civic partners<br>and with our Global friends<br>we will challenge our students we'll<br>challenge each other and in particular<br>we will challenge the status quo and we<br>will transform individuals we will<br>transform communities and we will<br>transform the region we've written that<br>as a strategy that is what we are aiming<br>to do and we will do that through our<br>impactful and relevant research teaching<br>and knowledge exchange so we're not<br>devoting money to do things that are<br>different we are just making sure that<br>what we do is aimed at helping the<br>region not everything we do is aimed at<br>helping the region but we are where we<br>can trying to make a difference<br>so the challenges ahead<br>government expectation of universities<br>are changing we see in the present time<br>culture wars freedom of speech<br>challenging us that we're teaching well<br>as a sect we're teaching too many<br>courses with low quality our students<br>we're not creating the economic growth<br>although it's a bit unclear whether at<br>the moment where the government sees<br>universes in terms of economic growth<br>last week universities weren't mentioned<br>this week we have been so who knows who<br>knows where that's going to go<br>and to me the biggest threat is and even<br>though the shape of universities have<br>changed over the years<br>we have still been autonomous<br>institutions we have been in we have<br>different funding regimes but we have<br>been allowed to make our own choices<br>some universities across the world don't<br>have any choice of what they do they are<br>told by the government what to do we may<br>think we're over regulated and over<br>performance managed but we have a lot of<br>choice<br>and I'm worried that that is greatly<br>going to be eroded<br>so find the slide in conclusion<br>universities have always relied upon the<br>state for some sort of sponsorship some<br>sort of patronage some direction of what<br>they should be doing so things have<br>although people would like to hark back<br>to the gold native University I'm not<br>sure when that Golden Age ever was<br>because because as things have changed<br>they've been advantage and disadvantages<br>to all of those changes<br>what universities do<br>and how they do it is in a constant<br>state of change okay maybe for 500 years<br>when Austin comes into two games in town<br>there wasn't much change going on but<br>since then<br>there's been a lot of change okay<br>measure our research measuring for our<br>teaching measuring for knowledge<br>exchange but what about our impact of<br>the place that we are in<br>and our future I think relies on us<br>deciding what we want to be<br>and what we want to do<br>within the regulations within the<br>current policies and of course within<br>the funding regimes at the time but<br>I think we have decided what we want to<br>do and what we want to be we've<br>articulated it in our strategy that was<br>published in July and we will transform<br>lives and communities through our<br>impactful relevant research teaching and<br>knowledge exchange and I think I've just<br>about<br>most of overtime but I don't allow to</p></main><footer style="margin-top: 2rem; background: #0001; padding: 2rem; text-align: center;"><p>We Are The
