chief<br>executive director of One Lindsay how<br>are you today great thank you thanks for<br>having me so Lindsay my first question<br>for you today is what did you study at<br>University and what was your first<br>working role<br>so I studied a bachelor of applied<br>sciences my first working role actually<br>was a lecturer at a university and I<br>lectured writing and switching so<br>networking and firewalls and lots of<br>engineering stuff yeah<br>now I understand you worked in Seattle<br>at Microsoft so how has working for<br>large corporations overseas enhance your<br>skill set yeah so um it's funny I've<br>always worked for multinationals so I<br>spend 10 years at IBM and 13 years at<br>Microsoft and<br>um I love the complexity and scale of<br>large corporates but also it gives you<br>the opportunity to move around and do<br>lots of different roles and learn and<br>grow and so I think<br>um from the U.S perspective one of the<br>key things I learned there was scale I<br>mean you work in the business so I<br>looked after Azure for the US market a<br>44 billion dollar business 6 000 people<br>across the country and you have to<br>continually land with Clarity your<br>strategy your message where you're going<br>and your objectives and<br>um it's so much easier to do it here in<br>New Zealand whereas in in the US it's<br>just like you know yeah<br>following on from your overseas<br>experience<br>what advice can you give graduates in<br>respect to staying domestically or vying<br>for international positions oh yeah<br>parents everywhere will hate me<br>um I think we should all go and travel<br>overseas and work I mean I you know I've<br>grew up in South Africa I worked in the<br>UK I've worked in the US I've worked<br>here so nothing beats International<br>experience it just gives you a different<br>perspective of everything and<br>um you know the<br>people in the UK and the US they love<br>new zealanders so one they love our<br>accents two we have the ability to<br>really look more broadly than at a<br>single role we're able to multitask you<br>know it's a stretch out and do a lot<br>more than traditional roles in the US<br>have enabled us to do and so we're a lot<br>more moldable and adaptable because when<br>you work in a role in New Zealand it's<br>not just one thing you have to do you<br>have to do five or six things whereas in<br>the US because they're so big you just<br>have a job that does one thing so when<br>as kiwis come in they see us as being<br>able to be flexible and adaptable and do<br>lots of different things and so I think<br>they love having us I think it gives us<br>great Global Experience that we can then<br>bring back home and I'm<br>and I just think the world's your oyster<br>you know where can you go next what's<br>your next opportunity yeah for sure so<br>as Chief Enterprise director of one what<br>does your role involve<br>so if you think about uh the<br>Telecommunications business that we have<br>you have B2B so your business customers<br>and you have your consumer customers so<br>I'll look after all of our B2B customers<br>so 30 handsets 30 phones and above so<br>think all large government agency<br>banking corporates so they sit within my<br>portfolio and I look after the ICT<br>products the sales the service the care<br>and the management of all of the<br>services we provide to them yeah and my<br>last question<br>I understand you have two daughters and<br>I can imagine your role as Chief<br>Enterprise director would require a lot<br>of your time how do you manage your<br>work-life balance<br>it's a good question and people often<br>ask me how do I get the balance with all<br>the work and then making sure I spend<br>time with my family and I think the key<br>thing to remember is that the company<br>will continue to give you work and until<br>you say I've got enough leg<br>um because there's always an endless<br>amount of supply of work and I think the<br>important thing is to have the<br>relationship with your manager where<br>you're able to say here are the 20<br>things I've got how do I prioritize<br>which things are more important to you<br>than other things and be really clear on<br>the time frames that you need to deliver<br>those those outcomes all those<br>requirements by and then I think the<br>other important thing is to know when to<br>turn off so when to focus on your family<br>and your friends versus when to just<br>continue working I don't know if you saw<br>it that recent Bill Gates that he did<br>yeah and he talks about how he used to<br>sit and look at people's cars in the car<br>parks and you know like register who was<br>leaving early and not working weekends<br>and he regrets the time he didn't take<br>off right so<br>um you know I'm the one that uses all of<br>my holiday I'm always using all of my<br>holiday and these people at work who<br>work for me they've got like all this<br>vacation time and they haven't used it<br>it's not healthy use your vacation time<br>go online on the beach recharge your<br>brain spend time with your family and<br>then come back into work<br>yeah well thank you so much for coming<br>along today Lindsay I appreciate all<br>your feedback and we wish you all the<br>best and safe travels back home thank<br>you very much thanks for having me</p></main><footer style="margin-top: 2rem; background: #0001; padding: 2rem; text-align: center;"><p>We Are The University</p><ul style="list-style-type: none; padding: 0; margin: 0;"><li><a
