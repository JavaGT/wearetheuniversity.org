information for you to make a<br>good decision today<br>so<br>um thank you for coming tonight it's<br>actually only two weeks since our big<br>tertiary open day so we actually filled<br>the room so um on tertiary open day but<br>this is a sort of catch-up one as well<br>for people overseas but it's also for<br>people who didn't manage to get to the<br>tertiary open day or people already<br>doing their degree so has anyone already<br>doing their degree hands up<br>or anyone still at school<br>yep and someone who's employed and<br>thinking about a new beginning anyone<br>so tonight we're going to talk about why<br>we think teaching is a good journey for<br>you to be on<br>um why we think you should do that at<br>otago we're going to talk about our<br>programs and we're going to give you<br>information about how to apply it's<br>quite a full-on process and then other<br>options that you can do we're not just<br>all about teaching at the College of<br>Education<br>um thank you to the parents that came<br>tonight I warn you now I have recruited<br>a parent in the past<br>um to be a teacher so you might already<br>be Peak teachers perhaps but um it has<br>been known it will might happen so our<br>students in the last couple of years<br>have ranged in age from 19 to 63. so<br>it's we really welcome so many different<br>ages in stages so and there'll be an<br>opportunity to ask questions as well so<br>if you're online if you want to ask a<br>question there'll be an opportunity<br>we'll answer them at the end so you can<br>send messages to um the otago education<br>Facebook page just send a message and<br>we've got someone collecting those as we<br>go and we'll ask questions too<br>um you might be a little bit shy about<br>this a little bit fukama about this you<br>have to answer the ask the question on a<br>microphone because the international<br>audience or the online audience can hear<br>as well it's okay it'll be fine<br>just you can bout out to Shania Twain if<br>you like at the same time<br>so we believe that teaching is not just<br>a job<br>or work that you do we believe that it's<br>not even just a career we believe it is<br>about transformative change so it is<br>about transformation so we are that<br>passionate about teaching so yes it is a<br>job and a career and things like that<br>but it's about motivating and empowering<br>happy and healthy Learners to make<br>informed decisions and actions at an<br>individual Community I'd add a national<br>and Global level so each of us are<br>individuals that are operating within<br>our communities and we might have<br>several communities we operate within<br>we're operating with in our wider town<br>or city our hapu our ewe and we're<br>operating in the National sphere but<br>we're also Global Citizens and we<br>believe that good teaching can make a<br>difference through that change in the<br>classroom<br>and so<br>we believe in um we believe that many<br>people become a teacher because of<br>um because they want to make a<br>difference and so we've actually taken<br>the opportunity to think about some<br>Maori values and<br>Gilda this is my cue and I'm hoping I<br>so just welcome to the um people who are<br>um<br>my role is a little bit similarma<br>associate D Marty in case you might not<br>have noticed from my introduction and<br>then I am from<br>otako this particular area and actually<br>live out that way too way out at<br>Harrington point so driving in today I<br>get to see those beautiful views that<br>Naomi had on her picture at the front<br>too so um why am I here because becoming<br>a teacher means that we have to<br>understand or undertake<br>or waitangi and understand how that<br>applies in an educational practice<br>because we have a treaty in this country<br>and how does that look what does that<br>look like in terms of Partnerships and<br>relationships in our schools in early<br>childhood centers and so when we become<br>a teacher we need to think about some of<br>these values that you can see listed on<br>the side of the PowerPoint here so<br>kaitiakitaka that is using kaitahu<br>dialect or naitahu dialect which is the<br>real Maori dialect for this particular<br>region as you may have heard of kaitiaki<br>Tanga which is the other way so we<br>switch out the K and the NG so<br>kaitiakitunga means that we become<br>carers we become Guardians and or<br>stewardship of the areas that we are<br>working on so if you come to our takuda<br>AKO taitoka which is Dunedin College of<br>Education you will be learning about<br>this specific area and when you learn<br>about this particular area we're showing<br>you that you need to apply the same<br>sorts of criteria or the same sorts of<br>activities that you will do here<br>anywhere that you teach so if you are<br>from China for example then you will<br>learn about the context or the places<br>where you are teaching in your own home<br>places everywhere has indigenous peoples<br>so it's understanding the indigenous<br>context of where you work so there's<br>some beautiful other ones there I want<br>to go really fast on those<br>um Aqua is like for teaching and<br>learning we learn off our students we<br>aren't just the people standing up the<br>top being directive but our students<br>teach us so many things so sometimes<br>they may be teaching you in the class as<br>well really important for nakataka that<br>we're going to look after our teachers<br>that we work with our colleagues our<br>students our whanau members our runaka<br>our hapu our ewe community members we're<br>going to teach them like we would the<br>best we would do for our own whanau<br>members<br>socio-emotional well-being<br>so nowadays with the world the way it is<br>how do we take care of ourselves how do<br>we build up resilience and resistance<br>but also stay strong and in order to<br>support the people that we are working<br>with tobututaka is we're going to learn<br>to listen we're going to as a reciprocal<br>relationships we're going to listen and<br>learn<br>alongside whoever we are working with<br>that we're going to be looking at the<br>local area which I've mentioned each of<br>those values interconnect<br>and so teachers learn those kinds of<br>values in any teacher education space<br>from now on and if you don't understand<br>or know those particular values before<br>you arrive don't worry we're going to<br>work with you on those and teach you<br>those kinds of things when you're here<br>that's part of the course and that's<br>Rachel<br>awesome so<br>for those people who are online<br>from Pacific Islands um uh I should<br>start with the love lava given Samoan<br>what else have I missed one I probably<br>there are more because it's more<br>specific regions but that's a good start<br>but also<br>um one of the things we do focuses on is<br>is that even though we have a bicultural<br>partnership with Maori we have a really<br>special Affinity with Pacific peoples<br>and<br>you'll notice on the on the right hand<br>side of the slide I thought I was being<br>a bit clever there and there's a Carver<br>bowls so we believe that if we all learn<br>whether whether or not you've got<br>specific students in your class that<br>some of the Pacific Islands values of um<br>so collectivism and um that idea of the<br>shared journey and relationships is some<br>very similar values to what Rachel<br>talked about in Te awamori and so those<br>are really special in addition to that<br>there could be also so some of these<br>values and promoting that in your<br>community in your classroom and your<br>world is really important it's why<br>people get into teaching we've actually<br>asked some of our our students generally<br>also the other reasons they get into<br>teaching and so this is a actually this<br>is actually a product of a statistical<br>analysis and so the bigger the word the<br>um the bigger the um<br>the number of times people said it so<br>make a difference people become teachers<br>because they want to make a difference<br>you'll notice a job satisfaction you<br>also notice in the news every day this<br>talking about<br>um today especially in the I think it<br>was in North Island today there was<br>rolling strikes and I'm not going to be<br>afraid to mention those around teachers<br>wanting more pay despite that<br>um teachers love the jobs and have good<br>job satisfaction in general because<br>they've got passion and you'll notice<br>that one coming through it's a vocation<br>as well as a career as well as a job to<br>do so it's all about changing our worlds<br>and you can see I can't quite see I<br>might be getting a little old Rachel<br>yeah I know it's up there so you can see<br>some of the other reasons what people<br>um people write down about why they want<br>to become teachers we are passionate so<br>we've got some speakers tonight that are<br>going to tell you about why they wanted<br>to become teachers and and to hopefully<br>share that passion so not only do we<br>think you should become a teacher we<br>think you should become a teacher with<br>us at the University of otago tikura<br>so um that we are the oldest<br>um initial teacher education provider in<br>New Zealand and we were established in<br>1876 so<br>um that doesn't mean we are stayed or<br>old-fashioned we are actually quite<br>jiggy with it I think you'll find<br>um in fact we are one of the top 100<br>providers in the world<br>so we are very proud of what we do here<br>and we're very well known across New<br>Zealand and actually possibly in other<br>places as well for being a good good<br>provider of initial teacher education<br>and one of the reasons that we think<br>we're so good<br>is because we offer such good support to<br>our students and that is that<br>Rachel was talking about the sense of<br>community created through this course is<br>exceptional I smile when I read these<br>quotes because they're from um this is<br>us sitting around one day and asking a<br>group of students and when I see these<br>names I smile because I've shared many<br>hugs with these people not because they<br>said these things but because we<br>actually build a relationship with them<br>um so so it's um we were given so many<br>chiliruses we were given so many chances<br>to build relationships with each other<br>the lecturers and students<br>um it's a mix of theory and practice in<br>terms of your learning in the classroom<br>then you go learning in our classes and<br>and then you go out to schools and early<br>childhood centers and apply it into the<br>class and also we support your growth<br>and some of the students that are going<br>to talk tonight may not know this we<br>help you write CVS we help you with your<br>cover letters we really<br>um<br>we help you belong to the community of<br>teachers because you are our colleagues<br>already so we really do support you all<br>the way through the employment<br>statistics remain very high from our<br>programs<br>um<br>Rachel would you like to talk a bit<br>about this<br>as you can see from the photos that's<br>why I stayed up here<br>um so there is one person who's not here<br>anymore but you see the rest of those<br>people in the photos in fact one person<br>sitting right down in front of me here<br>Michael<br>Fina Marty and Pacifica and so when you<br>talked about monarchitucker and looking<br>after our students and becoming<br>colleagues we really mean that so we<br>part is bringing people together so it's<br>Paul Maori and Pacifica students who<br>come in and you can grab a copper cup of<br>coffee you can have<br>um a study time in there it's warm and<br>it's inviting these places to meet each<br>other greet and some of our students got<br>together and have a today Omari session<br>on a Monday to practice what they have<br>been learning in their classes it's our<br>master's group uh where to sessions<br>actually our staff join in on a<br>Wednesday morning Staffing students and<br>we practice songs that we need to sing<br>for other occasions so if I say at the<br>moment just today we were having another<br>meeting and we found out about an<br>important person to ask called Bubba<br>Thompson who is from the invercargill<br>region who passed away so we learn and<br>this can happen in our teaching careers<br>they're very important people our final<br>members can pass so we're you know we're<br>gearing ourselves and getting our<br>ourselves really to be part of our<br>communities and support people in more<br>than just one way in the classroom so<br>yeah study skills and support really<br>important so we have the Maori Center<br>docomato Dakar which is part of the<br>University what can which can help out<br>our students as well and these lovely<br>people who are called caiaphina which<br>means they will help and support you as<br>you go through and we have little<br>activities and get togethers shared Kai<br>as we go through<br>this is the picture wasn't it there we<br>go thank you I knew it was coming up so<br>that's why I talked about it so there's<br>the picture of the room and there's us<br>if you can't see identify people in<br>there but we're in the room and we have<br>a speaker at the beginning of the year<br>where we introduce all those services<br>that I just briefly talked about now uh<br>and yeah so you get looked after that's<br>why we have those values at the start<br>okay<br>I think it's just a picture this is us<br>about um we go on so everyone has an<br>opportunity to go on an overnight stay<br>at various Mirage around<br>um oh yep go yep so we've got otako<br>for those of you know the region and<br>then if you're from further south in in<br>invercargill area the um there's several<br>Mirai down that way as well which people<br>have the opportunity to stay there if<br>they're at other campus which you'll<br>find out about very soon too and I just<br>suddenly realized is anyone here from<br>invercargo I forgot to ask that no in<br>the Vegas hello<br>um what about Central otago yeah<br>no no Queenstown<br>Westport<br>reefton no okay go up<br>yeah no I'm good thank you good all good<br>okay so and the other thing The Wider<br>university offers is support specific<br>support for international students<br>um so there's a really good supportive<br>place on campus to go and get that<br>really special support for people who<br>are operating outside their home country<br>so we're now going to talk there's two<br>main qualifications that you can do to<br>become a teacher and I'm not going to<br>talk about them much because I'm going<br>to see what comes out and then we can<br>add in bits at the end so there's The<br>Bachelor of teaching which is a<br>three-year undergraduate degree I that<br>is a wonderful way to start your<br>teaching career a lot and it means it's<br>a real point of difference because a lot<br>of universities now only offer a<br>one-year option after a degree but this<br>one is a degree in teaching it's three<br>years 120 days in the classroom or the<br>Early Childhood Center before you get<br>your qualification it is an excellent<br>option whether you've got a degree or<br>not actually I'd consider it but<br>actually it's for most people who may<br>not have a degree they'll start with a<br>three-year undergraduate program and<br>that's offered in Dunedin and<br>invercargill at our invercargo campus<br>and then the other option is go away and<br>do a degree or you might already have a<br>degree or you might have some experience<br>that that might be a a diploma or<br>something like that then do come and<br>talk to us about that because there are<br>some alternatives on very specialized<br>cases options for if you don't have that<br>level seven qualifications so do get<br>hold of us so the master of teaching and<br>learning for most people they've got a<br>level seven bachelor degree some even<br>have phds and come and do this so we've<br>had several phds come through and<br>master's degrees and things like that<br>but it's a postgraduate initial teacher<br>in qualification you're getting a master<br>degree in one year which again is quite<br>unusual generally it's 18 months or two<br>years for a master's degree but there's<br>no such thing as a free lunch it starts<br>and Ben's nodding yeah that's right so<br>it starts mid-January and finishes in<br>mid December so it's the same as a sort<br>of school year but most university<br>courses go from like end of February to<br>October so people get a woo it's sort of<br>like taking the two summer schools and<br>it's six compulsory papers uh worth 30<br>points each so we all know a being 30<br>times six is 180 and so then you get 80<br>Days of that school year out in schools<br>or early childhood centers so it's<br>really<br>um<br>um I'll talk a little bit about<br>secondary for a moment because Ben<br>hasn't done this yet because he's going<br>to talk for secondary for example in<br>secondary we have a principles day where<br>over 50 principles come from all around<br>the country and are recruiting so it's a<br>really um and I had a principal come<br>from Hamilton a couple of years ago at<br>author tuna high school and she said I<br>need 19 teachers I said well mate we've<br>only got 60 in the program so you can<br>have a third of them if you like so<br>that's a sort of employment<br>opportunities there it depends a little<br>bit on subjects and things like that but<br>there really are excellent employment<br>opportunities so that's them and you can<br>do that in early childhood I'll actually<br>give this a little bit more so you can<br>do the master of teaching and learning<br>and secondary<br>primary and early childhood and then the<br>Bachelor of teaching you can do in early<br>childhood and primary there's also two<br>another option of the primary bicultural<br>program that is a three-year Bachelor of<br>teaching that runs out of invercargill<br>we'll talk a little bit more about that<br>later<br>so<br>you knowing what sector you want to go<br>to now makes a difference so when you do<br>your application if you state what<br>sector you want to do that will mean<br>your application is not held up in any<br>way so I suggest before you apply you<br>know what sector you're applying for or<br>give us a ring and talk us through that<br>if you gave us a ring and talked us<br>through that the thing we would suggest<br>you to do is to just ring up a local<br>Early Childhood Center a school could uh<br>whatever you want primary or secondary<br>early childhood and actually say can I<br>come and spend a day in your school if<br>you're not really sure particularly for<br>those people who might already be in<br>school they say there is no way I want<br>to be a secondary school teacher honey<br>there is no way and but you need to<br>probably go and see another school<br>because you think you know what<br>Secondary School teaching is all about<br>um and and don't assume primary teaching<br>primary teaching might have changed<br>quite a lot in the five years since you<br>were there so so do spend that time to<br>choose that sector really carefully and<br>and with real good conscience so we're<br>going to talk I'm going to hand enough<br>talking from me we're going to talk<br>about early childhood education<br>and we are going to start with the<br>lovely Jessica Kiora Jessica so<br>Jessica's here from she's studying The<br>Bachelor of teaching in early childhood<br>now would you prefer<br>you go for it<br>do you want to stand here because um not<br>cursing aspersions on anything but can<br>um<br>so I basically came straight from<br>invercargill<br>um to Dunedin fresh out of high school<br>in 2021 to study a bachelor of early<br>childhood education<br>um so yeah I'm currently in my third<br>year<br>so I guess I always kind of wanted to do<br>ECE my mum's a primary school teacher<br>has been since I was about three I still<br>remember going into children's<br>invercargill still remember going into<br>Teachers College with her a few times<br>um but yeah that kind of influenced me<br>and then as I got up in the school<br>system I had my own sugars with it and I<br>was like this is not what I want for<br>teaching and so I decided that I wanted<br>to make a difference like what's already<br>kind of been discussed earlier<br>um is that I wanted to make a difference<br>have my voice heard a little bit I'm<br>really passionate about early childhood<br>and I intend to go a long way with it<br>um<br>but yeah well so kind of what stood out<br>to me was the um play-based it's a<br>play-based curriculum so although many<br>people will say like oh you're just<br>babysitters that's not at all what we<br>are we do just as much teaching as<br>primary school and secondary school I<br>would argue maybe even more<br>um we do have to do like nephew changes<br>and stuff like that but that's not<br>that's not really what it's about it's<br>about<br>um so this year especially we've been<br>learning about how um<br>we're teaching so much science and maths<br>and stuff like even in the sandpit<br>making sand castles that's measuring<br>that's maths so yeah that's kind of why<br>I was passionate about it and why I kind<br>of joined and also the editago uni I<br>came here and was really introverted<br>really shy<br>um I had had one one day experience of<br>Early Childhood teaching from high<br>school a careers Department got me to go<br>into a center for a day that was it I<br>just kind of had a feeling that I wanted<br>to early childhood and<br>um<br>so yeah and then I'm so much more<br>confident now I go into my placement say<br>hi to all the children say hi to all the<br>whanau<br>um have really strong relationships and<br>stuff and I guess a big part of that has<br>been our lecturers so very supportive<br>like Michael he teaches us a lot this<br>year<br>um and he's my visiting lecture as well<br>so they always they're always here to<br>support us and I think like all of my<br>class and the other years could agree<br>with that<br>um I won't tell you how much I've spent<br>how much time I spent complaining in the<br>offices about assignments<br>um and also so we've learned so much<br>about culture as well I'm parkiha so I<br>didn't really I was kind of of that<br>generation I didn't really learn a lot<br>about<br>um<br>about Charles Maori and Tito waitangi<br>and that sort of how important it is<br>really at primary school I know the year<br>after me I think it started to become<br>more a thing<br>um yeah I learned nothing about it no<br>today I'm Maori obviously learned how to<br>say like kyode and stuff but that's<br>about it<br>um I have learned so much since then<br>um I've learned yeah all about keeping<br>how important Mana is in keeping the<br>white or high for tomodiki and stuff<br>like that<br>and yeah and we even got to as was<br>mentioned before<br>um we got to go to the Mirai this year<br>um just a few months ago actually for<br>the other night and it was incredible it<br>was amazing<br>um in such an eye-opening experience I<br>think and so you'll have that to look<br>forward to hopefully<br>and Amy's not here at the moment but<br>she's<br>um she's taught us a lot and even me<br>like I said before I'm Parky Harbor I've<br>learned about my own culture as well and<br>having that sort of identity like my<br>ancestors I'm I've learned to be proud<br>of them as well they came over from<br>Ireland and they didn't know what they<br>were doing uh<br>but yeah so I've learned not to be too<br>guilty and be proud of it and embrace<br>Tom Maori so that's kind of I say that's<br>like one of the most important aspects<br>of Early Childhood course in Dunedin but<br>um<br>so as Jessica said I'm one of the<br>teaching team for the Early Childhood<br>Program there's a small group of four or<br>five of us and uh yeah we we think the<br>Early Childhood has got something to<br>offer both for uh children and for the<br>students<br>in particular I think for Jessica if<br>you'd seen her in the first year and<br>asked her to come up here and talk like<br>this she would have been running a mile<br>very quickly but you know she's done a<br>wonderful job to overcome some of those<br>nerves and share with you some of the<br>things that she's found important<br>uh and uh yeah that's that's the thing<br>about<br>um finding your place in the world and<br>what you're doing when you're with<br>children under five uh is seeing them<br>work out their place in the world the<br>joy of it of course is that you can do<br>that in the sand pit or this morning as<br>I was reading lots of books as I was<br>visiting another student but the you<br>know the children see a spare adult<br>around the place and say oh that's cool<br>I'll get them to<br>play with us so I I quite enjoy visiting<br>because Early Childhood I think is the<br>place to be<br>um and if you're uh wondering<br>um as was suggested before to go and<br>visit a place and they're all quite<br>different and it makes it<br>um tricky because you go to one and<br>realize you go to another and they've<br>changed again<br>um but to have that feel now some people<br>um they they walk into Early Childhood<br>settings and they just see chaos<br>there's not enough structure to the day<br>and they are what are these children are<br>all about and where's the learning<br>happening and that's part of what this<br>course does is to<br>um highlight where the learning is<br>happening within the play so it's not<br>just all playing or it's just it says<br>it's not about babysitting but there's<br>learning happening important learning so<br>yeah check those uh opportunities you<br>might get uh to find out what's<br>happening talk with others if you know<br>people who are currently out in settings<br>to see what they think so yes if you do<br>like the chaos you do like the under<br>fives a bit of noise but lots of singing<br>um yeah come and ask more questions<br>we're always happy to to chat I'll stop<br>down<br>um got let others have a go maybe some<br>folk from primary would like to yeah<br>Kilda and just to be clear that you can<br>learn early childhood education both<br>here in Dunedin and invercargill and<br>um it's a pretty I don't know if you've<br>been listening to the media lately but<br>the government is now going to provide<br>more funding for people over two rather<br>than just people over three so there's a<br>real shortage of Early Childhood<br>teachers so please consider it and help<br>the nation so<br>um<br>now we have primary education and we'll<br>ask<br>um<br>I was just gonna say I have pre-written<br>my speech I will try to uh go buy it but<br>sometimes that may not happen<br>um<br>so cute my name is nalia and I am my<br>third year at College I am 20 years old<br>and I'm currently on placement at<br>McKendree Bay School which is epic I<br>love it down there and so I was born in<br>Dunedin to my parents and one of which<br>who was a teacher so people have always<br>asked me my entire life did this inspire<br>you didn't it put you off and yes and no<br>I discovered more that I wanted to do<br>teaching through my love of dance so<br>I've been a dancer my whole life and I<br>began to teach children dance and I kind<br>of realized<br>that sparked this interest in me that I<br>actually wanted to pursue teaching<br>because I had no idea what I wanted to<br>do until year 13. so that was a big<br>moment for me realizing what I wanted to<br>do and I mean I did go into my mum's<br>Class A Lot in year 13 and year 12 which<br>did help me to realize it's what I<br>wanted to do so I just wanted to explain<br>to you why you should be a teacher why<br>Primary in a little bit of waitango and<br>I'll try to be as quick as I can so you<br>why you should become a teacher so as a<br>teacher and currently for me it's the<br>connections with students uh that see me<br>or any other teacher as a person of<br>importance so they come in every morning<br>and you're having these conversations<br>and like building those relationships<br>which are honestly Unforgettable and it<br>really opens your eyes to how awesome<br>they are and that they are actually<br>really trying their best and that no<br>matter what's going on in their life<br>they're coming in they're like talking<br>to you and they're like seeing you as<br>this role model and it's actually really<br>inspiring to sit there knowing that<br>they're looking at you as like this<br>person that is like<br>I'm gonna look up to you and everything<br>you say I'm gonna try and you know abide<br>by that doesn't always happen but they<br>do try and I think as well it's just<br>having an impact on their life like you<br>watch them grow especially in third year<br>with being at one school all year and it<br>just makes it all seem worth it like<br>just being there every day<br>so and having that impact on them that<br>part to success and it just really makes<br>being a teacher worth it like I just<br>love it and<br>I couldn't see myself doing anything<br>else like it's just I cannot explain to<br>you it's just it comes naturally to<br>people when it's come as like a really<br>natural thing to me and so being a<br>teacher is just so awesome and<br>seeing these kids and inspiring them is<br>just so awesome so why primary teaching<br>so I wrote down here about it's<br>incredibly rewarding and fulfilling for<br>us and the students I mean so at that<br>age at this age I think yeah ages one to<br>eight well you use one to eight they're<br>so enthusiastic anything that I start to<br>teach them currently they're like yes<br>we're doing it we want to do it we're<br>going to learn they ask questions<br>they're exploring ideas like I currently<br>have year six students and they are so<br>curious they want to get on the<br>Chromebooks and start researching and<br>finding out about things they don't kind<br>of just<br>sit there and stare at me blankly<br>wondering what I'm talking about because<br>they are at this age where they're just<br>so amazing and get into it and like even<br>today when I was just giving them<br>challenges for Matt they were so into it<br>and it makes me so happy that seeing<br>what I have planned for them<br>is something that they love so I feel<br>like at this age they just can get into<br>it and they're awesome and they just<br>have this space of being almost safe to<br>them like coming to school knowing that<br>I'm there for them in this age like I<br>cannot explain how awesome it is<br>teaching<br>um primary school students and then I<br>just wrote on here about why otago so if<br>you ever live in Dunedin or the Dunedin<br>area or anywhere close it makes sense to<br>come here and as well like the staff who<br>have been teaching us for the last three<br>years are so amazing so supportive like<br>I don't think I would have been here<br>without half of all of the staff<br>actually like they're just amazing so<br>that's definitely like a huge bonus to<br>coming here and it means that for me<br>personally I've been able to stand<br>Dunedin with my family but also make<br>friends and meet new people who aren't<br>from Dunedin while finishing my degree<br>in the place that I love so I mean<br>there's just so many positives and I<br>think I could talk about it forever so<br>I'm going to stop now and Hannah over<br>Chandra because I could speak forever so<br>I'm going to stop<br>thanks<br>you can just hear the patient can't you<br>and so from um someone that's literally<br>in the beginning of their career to<br>someone that's been teaching for 26<br>years I still feel just as passionate<br>about it and welcome and it really is<br>the most rewarding job ever my name is<br>Andrea Robertson I'm the primary program<br>coordinator and I get to teach students<br>like um nalia music dance literacy and<br>lots of other things so one thing I love<br>about primary is you get to bring your<br>passions your areas of interest if<br>Sports your thing if music's your thing<br>if science is your thing we get to share<br>that every day with the students in our<br>class and we get to teach a little bit<br>of everything which is pretty awesome<br>as nalia said we in primary we're year<br>one to eight and ages five to thirteen<br>you can't it's a you know nice broad<br>place to come into so I've taught<br>middles or actually seniors middles and<br>juniors I really love that middle age<br>group in our primary program we've got<br>about 300 students and we know every<br>single one of them by name so it's from<br>for myself I love the fact that we've<br>got a big group of students but we do<br>get to know them well we work with them<br>in first second and third year<br>and the bth program over that time you<br>get five different placements so you're<br>out in schools for two placements in<br>first year two placements in second year<br>and then in third year you're out in the<br>same school for the whole year and I<br>think Naomi mentioned earlier it's 120<br>days so yes you're in a college learning<br>and doing the theory you're doing<br>education papers curriculum professional<br>studies but you're out in schools for<br>120 days as well which is always the<br>Highlight I think of of your time at<br>College it really is I mean it's been<br>mentioned about that chance to make a<br>difference but it is<br>an amazing career to get into and as<br>mentioned we our job isn't over until<br>you're in a job at the end and so we<br>help all of our students with CV writing<br>applying for jobs practicing for<br>interviews and from our third years last<br>year every single one of them is our<br>teaching that wanted to be out teaching<br>so we have a great<br>um you know turnover of people doing<br>their study here and then heading out<br>I'm now going to hand over is that<br>correcting onto this one<br>ah<br>um so part of our um primary program is<br>the fact that our students can study<br>catechetical studies and Katie's going<br>to talk about<br>that kyota Koto called Katie Montgomery<br>tohoku ikawa and I am the coordinator<br>here at the College of Education for<br>catechetical studies and what that is is<br>some additional study that students who<br>are part of the Bachelor of teaching and<br>primary can take on alongside their<br>degree and it is to prepare them to<br>teach in Catholic or other integrated<br>schools so it gives helps them develop<br>the knowledge skills and attitudes and<br>also learning how to teach religious<br>education as well and a part of this<br>involves<br>some mentoring through me and working<br>along so me over the three years lots of<br>practical workshops and also the option<br>to take on one to two theology papers as<br>well to enhance your understandings to<br>be able to teach religious education<br>each year we have around 10 to 15<br>students that join in a part of the<br>program and they work together as a<br>really close group and they love the<br>relationships they build as a group but<br>also they get to build it along with the<br>first years second years and third Years<br>meet together lots and additional to<br>that too students get to have at least<br>one placement in a Catholic school where<br>they get to practice their school skills<br>and learn about on-site lots of the<br>things I've been learning in regards to<br>prayer special character and teaching<br>religious education and another thing I<br>want to share too is the Dunedin<br>Catholic Diocese have set up<br>scholarships for people that I want to<br>join in catechetical studies and these<br>are six thousand dollars so the email is<br>up here cat studies at<br>otago.ac.nz if you're interested in<br>learning more please contact me for more<br>information and if you're interested in<br>finding out more about the scholarships<br>and the criteria for them please contact<br>either see me after this I've got<br>information with me but please contact<br>this email and I can send out some<br>coach<br>it's my privilege always to work in the<br>Masters program it really is a<br>remarkable program where people come to<br>us with an undergrad degree and that<br>degree can be anything at all<br>which brings the cohort and makes them<br>very interesting so our students are<br>slightly older often very very committed<br>which is quite an important quality and<br>they're just finishing right now<br>tomorrow actually their very first big<br>block in a school so they've been in a<br>school since February on a number of<br>Wednesdays and then for six weeks you'll<br>be knowing this as secondary students<br>sitting here and it's just such a<br>privilege to be part of that journey I<br>really can't say it enough and they sort<br>of start some of them not from Ground<br>Zero because they've been teacher aides<br>and they've done all sorts of other<br>things but some of them yes they arrive<br>in a school and it's just quite a new<br>environment that they're having to<br>navigate find their way around and I<br>just am so proud of them I'm just<br>amazing I work at the valley with them<br>and Northeast Valley Primary and I<br>cannot believe how they're flourished<br>and grown in the last six weeks and just<br>from their planning their relationships<br>with students and fan know has just been<br>amazing and then the great excitement I<br>sat with a few of them this afternoon<br>and they did their professional<br>conversations which is this amazing<br>assessment a very authentic form of<br>assessment that we use with them where<br>they present their evidence of how<br>they've met the learning outcomes for<br>the paper and it's just such a<br>celebration and what really excited me<br>today was that they were talking about<br>how they'd shifted students learning and<br>that is just what teaching is all about<br>and they did it with such real Grace and<br>knowledge of you know in science how<br>they taught a whole lot of things about<br>how sound works with six-year-olds and I<br>actually saw their summative assessment<br>for the unit and it was just such a<br>celebration so I cannot recommend the<br>Masters enough if you are somebody who's<br>committed you've looked in a school<br>you've been back and you've sat in a<br>staff room and you thought right this is<br>for me and I really do promise you an<br>amazing journey it is really a full-on<br>ride from very very early in January<br>Rachel's naughting at me right through<br>to mid-December so it's a long year but<br>there are some breaks as well that's<br>very important to know they've got two<br>weeks off soon for the school holidays<br>and then they'll come back and<br>um I work with Helen and we'll place<br>them in a second school yes and they<br>they'll tell us which age group they'd<br>like to do and so they leave us having<br>had 80 Days in schools and they<br>generally all win jobs Dunedin can be<br>tricky I'll be honest about that but I<br>think people do know that in Dunedin so<br>we've got a large group that Helen<br>trevathan and I are tracking in a<br>research project who went to Auckland a<br>number of our students do go to the<br>north island and one really successful<br>jobs I think there's quite a cohort up<br>of the Masters graduates now and I'm<br>sure secondaries the same<br>so it's just an amazing journey and if<br>you are somebody who's got a degree and<br>has thought about this for a long time<br>now's your moment so and that you'll<br>Kia Ora so thanks Jane<br>um we've talked about the programs that<br>we offer up here in Dunedin but we also<br>have a really special program that we<br>offer only in invercargill um to pukai<br>which is our primary bulkultural teacher<br>education program it is the only one in<br>New Zealand I think we're very proud of<br>what we offer here I'm looking at Rachel<br>as I go to make that claim we'll just<br>say that that's the way it goes but<br>we're really proud we have an amazing<br>educator Parker Ormond who is one of the<br>key teachers in the tepoke program so if<br>you've got an interest into our Maori<br>and potentially going into full<br>immersion settings or bilingual settings<br>this particular three-year degree could<br>be right up your alley so if you're<br>wanting to find out more we've got more<br>information<br>so<br>a little summarize here so you can do<br>early childhood as a b teaching Bachelor<br>of teaching for three years and you can<br>do that in invercargill or Dunedin or<br>you can do early childhood as a master's<br>degree one year in Dunedin or you can do<br>primary teaching as a three-year<br>in Dunedin or you can do primary<br>teaching as a three-year invercargill<br>or and you can do primary teaching with<br>an add-on extra study and catholical<br>studies let's pause for a minute can you<br>say catholicitical let's have a go Kathy<br>call Catholic chemical so you can add on<br>Catholic chemical studies<br>how's that on your CV or you can add on<br>you can go to invercargill and do<br>primary bicultural teaching<br>oh my gosh or<br>you can do<br>go off under a degree and do primary<br>Masters<br>wow that's quite good and didn't Jane<br>sell that well<br>or<br>or secondary is very simple you can only<br>do it one way and you can only do it in<br>Dunedin<br>you can do it in other places around New<br>Zealand of course but I'd suggest New<br>Zealand dunedin's a fairly good place to<br>do it and you can only do it after a<br>degree as a masters of teaching and<br>learning one year so um the<br>um I'm going to let Ben talk now who is<br>fresh from school today still in the<br>school clothes and he has been teaching<br>at my old school and then I'll pick up<br>what is missed out and have a chat about<br>secondary two because Ian mcgilchrist is<br>not here so over to you Ben you'll need<br>a microphone<br>and you're such a quiet person that<br>perhaps you need to be very careful<br>about holding it close to you he has<br>done speech and drama for years this led<br>he'll be fine oh geez don't give me too<br>much of a sell<br>um okay oh yeah no yeah you do you<br>so I guess for the Masters course<br>probably on the questions of people one<br>of the questions that people would have<br>if you're going to the stage<br>is where's the moment that you make the<br>decision that you want to go into your<br>masters of teaching and for me<br>personally I was sitting a exam end of<br>the year and I thought I'm not<br>passionate about this<br>I finished out my degree<br>and I decided to Weber to work I worked<br>with Early Childhood I worked at a<br>boarding house with secondary kids I got<br>to experience a variety of kids at a<br>variety of different stages<br>and for the Masters course I couldn't<br>recommend that enough if you can get<br>into schools definitely do give<br>yourselves the best opportunity to make<br>the best decision<br>and pack a master's course<br>now the Masters course<br>I I've preached it for the whole year<br>I've preached it in my classroom<br>your cohorts of community your<br>classroom's a community<br>and in my cohort being the Masters<br>course you have such an array of<br>different people and I feel very<br>grateful for<br>the five months now that we've been<br>together<br>that there have actually been some<br>outstanding people that I could safely<br>say I'd hope would be lifelong friends<br>also looking at the course<br>you have 80 Days in the classroom<br>and I think this is probably one of the<br>questions that I would have had going<br>into it<br>how the heck do you go in front of a<br>classroom<br>especially secondary they'll probably<br>know more than me about something<br>they'll undermine you about something<br>I look at it you get into a classroom<br>and I believe that the kids can tell<br>when you go up in front<br>that<br>as a teacher you kind of command a bit<br>of a presence and it's not just you<br>standing there it's your staff standing<br>there with you it's the rest of your<br>cohort standing with you and it's the<br>schools that you're with are standing<br>with you<br>so when I look at the secondary course<br>so far<br>and I think back to that moment where I<br>set an exam and I thought this isn't for<br>me<br>and I think about that decision of doing<br>a certificate of proficiency before<br>going into my Master's course<br>I think it was actually one of the<br>better choices I did make<br>and if you're having an ring<br>take the dive<br>if you're passionate about education if<br>you're passionate about people<br>I couldn't think of a better profession<br>to be in<br>quite loud enough as it is but given now<br>we've got so another way given that Ian<br>McGill Chris is not here<br>um my background is secondary so just to<br>tell you a little bit about me and my<br>decisions around it I um didn't start<br>with teaching I started in the smelter<br>and invercargill<br>um on the end of a broom<br>um for for quite some time and slowly I<br>moved up to working a machine in the in<br>the smelter and so teaching is actually<br>my second career and I simply chose<br>chose teaching because it suited my<br>husband couldn't get a job in<br>invercargill and I had to have a job so<br>I went teaching without a particular<br>if I don't know if I would have done<br>very well in an interview because I<br>didn't go and they go I've been<br>passionate about teaching all my life it<br>was like yeah I really need a job in<br>this area but I went teaching and I<br>didn't look back it was great fun<br>um on the end of a broom was fun too<br>let's be honest but teaching was great<br>and I never looked back so I've taught<br>in a variety of places I've taught<br>overseas at an international school so<br>there's lots of opportunities for things<br>like that I was in the sultanate of Oman<br>for four years unfortunately during the<br>Arab of spring but that's another story<br>I'll tell you next year so there was all<br>sorts of reasons why teaching was really<br>really good for me at the time and so<br>secondary teaching it's I've mostly<br>taught year 11 to 13 for those people<br>that are overseas that sort of 15 to 18<br>year olds I'm a mathematics teacher you<br>can probably tell there's a we've sort<br>of got that look I think<br>um don't you think nah anyway and so I<br>taught mathematics in a variety of<br>secondary this goes all around the<br>country and the world and I am like<br>being<br>ghost secondary it's great but actually<br>it's not a competition go education it's<br>just a fantastic option for a career<br>um<br>I don't think I'll add much more at that<br>stage I will talk a little bit about<br>we'll have lots of time for questions in<br>a little while<br>if you are interested in secondary you<br>actually and you're still in your degree<br>or nearing the end of the degree or you<br>did a degree years ago and planning your<br>degree or planning what subject you're<br>going to do is really important so Ben<br>you do from memory English History and<br>there's only 72 of them sometimes I get<br>them confused so so<br>um so Ben doesn't a a combination of<br>English History and social studies you<br>might do a combination of you might just<br>be pure mathematics and not do anything<br>else because that's a full program so<br>it's quite complex if you're interested<br>in secondary there's a really important<br>um<br>uh thing about how to design your degree<br>around your subjects at the back of this<br>if you're online it's on the College of<br>Education website and that's really<br>important to um to do a little bit more<br>planning it's a bit more complex we've<br>only got one option for studying<br>secondary but we can make it complex too<br>um so let's get on to applying you the<br>application dates are actually quite<br>early if you want to do a master of<br>teaching and learning they're actually<br>due by the end of July<br>if you want to do a bachelor of teaching<br>that's the three-year one they're due at<br>the end of August so there's an app if<br>you go online to the College of<br>Education website or just Google<br>teaching otago you'll get the apply Now<br>button that's the bit you click all<br>right<br>um<br>some people this is going to be recorded<br>I think in some yes this isn't being<br>recorded So some people might be<br>watching this and it's after July the<br>31st or August the 31st don't despair we<br>do accept late applications<br>so under certain conditions so don't<br>despair if you're listening to this late<br>we actually accept them all the way<br>through for another couple of months so<br>that's absolutely fine make contact with<br>us and ask us if you're not sure<br>you need for The Bachelor of teaching<br>University entrance so that's your basic<br>qualification when you leave school and<br>or if you're doing the M Teach as I said<br>before a level seven bachelor degree or<br>approved equivalent you need a<br>disposition to teach and I think the<br>student speakers today<br>have really shown you that they have a<br>disposition to teach and what I mean by<br>that is<br>um<br>you know Ben talked about a classroom<br>presence<br>um I will say though that not everyone's<br>an extrovert when you're a teacher<br>students really enjoy teachers who are<br>more measured more quiet just like there<br>are all sorts of students there are all<br>sorts of teachers so when we talk about<br>a disposition to teach we're evidencing<br>that through your involvement in your<br>community cultural sporting we're going<br>to give you an interview we ask for two<br>referee reports so if you're already a<br>year 13 student that might be<br>someone at your school the the dean of<br>your your year level or it might be an<br>employer if you haven't been at school<br>for a number of years it could be an<br>employer or things like that be very<br>careful and don't say my referee is a<br>very close family friend<br>okay that's a really common thing and if<br>you've already written that don't worry<br>we'll ask you if we want more but a very<br>close family friend we need someone who<br>might be<br>um you know someone else in the<br>community that you're in<br>um that can really<br>um justify and give evidence of why they<br>think you should be a teacher so if it's<br>a close family friend<br>um that's not quite such a strong<br>referee so choosing really good referees<br>are important um and we'll tell you if<br>we say look we need another one<br>um I remember once getting I'm the<br>sister's husband or you know the<br>husband's sister or something would be<br>the husband's sister I suppose not the<br>sisters could be okay<br>um so what happens then is you you apply<br>and then we do a round of interviews we<br>actually don't do them probably it's<br>more August September that we do the<br>interviews<br>um and and some even through to October<br>so don't despair it's that's just how<br>long the process takes but then after<br>that we can um either say you're you're<br>welcome to accept and you've been<br>offered a place or there may be um if if<br>you're deemed eligible for the program<br>and you're accepted at interview so the<br>interview takes about 20 minutes between<br>20 minutes and half an hour and you're<br>generally interviewed with one of our<br>staff plus someone from the community it<br>could be a principal Deputy principal<br>Early Childhood Center manager so<br>someone from the community as well<br>um<br>it's not<br>super formal<br>on the other hand please don't wear<br>jeans with holes in them even if they're<br>the coolest holes that have cost more<br>than the denim that would have been with<br>if there was no holes like they could be<br>the coolest denim in the world but<br>wearing holy jeans<br>is a No-No so your dressing professional<br>okay teacher tip 101 you shouldn't be<br>able to see it up it down or through it<br>there's an old old up it down or through<br>it's a dress professional don't come<br>with your hoodie up and things like that<br>so you are presenting yourself and<br>you're honoring yourself your whanau<br>your you know you are there representing<br>you and your your whanau so try and<br>think about what you'd wear in a<br>professional situation<br>um you don't have to be super flesh we<br>know that students don't earn heaps and<br>heaps but just present yourself tidy<br>um that's that's really important but of<br>course it's far that's a superficial<br>thing in a way it's all about<br>um who you are<br>um talking about<br>um it might be that you have had some so<br>look for opportunities to talk about<br>have you ever coached a sports team have<br>you done some volunteer work and so<br>you've got a bit of time between now and<br>the interview<br>um to to think about opportunities so<br>you could for example ring up the local<br>primary school or high school and say<br>I'd like to be involved in the school<br>show or can I help to coach a netball<br>team can I do some tutoring can I help<br>at a local play center there's all sorts<br>of ways you can get involved in the<br>community and we'll be wanting to hear<br>about those things surf life saving<br>gymnastics coaching helping out at Mid<br>eye for you know all sorts of things<br>we're really interested in doing it<br>there's a whole lot of um<br>I was going to say hopes you have to<br>jumps you have to jump in hoops you have<br>to jump through you have to jump through<br>hoops yes we have to attest that you're<br>a suitable children's worker in New<br>Zealand and that is um around the law<br>um so<br>um we need to do police vetting things<br>like that if you have a reason you're<br>worried about police vetting it doesn't<br>necessarily mean that it's a no-go it<br>means it comes to a panel and we we<br>agree that you can continue so it's um<br>it's a process that you need to do<br>we need to get your referees to a test<br>that we believe that you are suitable to<br>look after children there's all sorts of<br>things like that but it's it you'll move<br>through it at any time you're so welcome<br>to email us and the email is on there to<br>say hey I'm a little bit worried I<br>haven't heard we really encourage you to<br>email us to keep us going and make sure<br>I so do plus ID checks there's a couple<br>of more things around firstly<br>um there's an ID check that you need to<br>do at various times during it as part of<br>the police check and things like that so<br>you need to think about<br>um even when you come for your interview<br>um and you know 99 of the time we'll<br>interview everyone who applies so if<br>you're eligible<br>um so<br>um if you can bring along your passport<br>or a<br>um an ID with your address on it and<br>it'll tell you what you need to bring<br>and I think bring it early as you can<br>that's really important but it will it<br>will tell you at the right stage but the<br>interview is not a bad idea to actually<br>get go to the ask a Target desk and ask<br>them can you look at my interview can<br>you look at my ID now and maybe make a<br>note of it<br>um and the other thing I want to say is<br>at interview<br>and I'm saying this very carefully we<br>are very proud of otago one of the<br>reasons we are<br>amazing is that we graduate numerate and<br>literate graduates so we want teachers<br>who are in our classrooms our kayako who<br>are literate and numerate and that means<br>we assist you at entry<br>now that sounds scary we're giving you a<br>math test when we interview you I know<br>that sounds a bit scary but actually<br>it's reasonable<br>um<br>uh it's probably around a year<br>nine-ish level of mathematics and we<br>talk about we screen you in terms of<br>So reading comprehension and short essay<br>um and so we we take into account that<br>you know English might not be your first<br>language things like that so there's<br>different things you need to do for for<br>that criteria<br>um so this is not this is a screening<br>thing<br>more than an assessment if you like so<br>it's it's uh you're welcome to contact<br>us if you want some more information but<br>there's some information on the website<br>as well so um just to make you aware of<br>that anything else about the application<br>process<br>Ben really can't stress it enough I had<br>a delayed application<br>I think in our interview you complain<br>about miles of the University I didn't<br>complain about the bowels of the<br>yeah so being I remember this actually I<br>interviewed Ben<br>it's my fault he's here no so I<br>interviewed Ben and his application<br>there was a delay and he had sent an<br>email going hey and so we had to<br>um there's the College of Education and<br>then there's a whole admissions process<br>so I went into the rest of the<br>university in the head of the University<br>rather than the bowels they and I<br>managed to find out what had happened to<br>his application so don't hesitate to<br>send an email at any stage if you're<br>worried<br>good idea<br>okay so a couple of other things we're<br>looking for learning capability solid<br>academic results we don't need you to be<br>all a plus students it's about<br>um it could be that you didn't might not<br>have done well earlier and you've shown<br>growth or it could be that so we talk<br>about things like that for the M<br>teaching certainly we're looking for<br>normally a b average but again if you<br>haven't quite got a B average but you<br>absolutely blow us out of the water at<br>the interview you know there are contact<br>us<br>um don't don't give up because we have<br>there are ways around things that's or<br>or approved equivalent we're really<br>interested if if you had don't know a<br>lot about the titiriti or waitangi I<br>suggest that you find out a little bit<br>about that<br>and how it applies to schools or early<br>childhood settings in New Zealand we are<br>so incredibly privileged to have a<br>bicultural nation and this is something<br>that we have talked about a lot tonight<br>and that's because it is an absolute<br>gift it is it is such a privilege to be<br>in this nation so we want to make sure<br>we uphold that and because member we're<br>a transformative space<br>um an understanding of what teaching<br>involves so if you come along I am my<br>mum was a teacher yeah yeah good<br>holidays eh<br>so that's so find out a little bit about<br>what teaching looks like for example did<br>you know that teachers Plan before every<br>lesson they don't just turn up and go<br>we're doing fractions today you can't<br>spell fraction without action let's go<br>so we actually so that was funny that<br>was a math joke guys come on can't you<br>tell so you actually you smarter but<br>Chris he's smart of it so you actually<br>have to plan before you teach so we<br>teach you how to plan and all sorts of<br>things like that so there's all sorts of<br>things there that you've read through<br>now that I think are really important<br>there are scholarships<br>so there are scholarships now karahipi<br>so um<br>there are teach NZ scholarships if<br>you're a career changer so anyone who's<br>here that wants to change career or if<br>you've come with your daughter or son<br>and you're thinking about teaching<br>yourself after this talk you can change<br>a career and there are scholarships<br>around that uh for tirio Maori if you're<br>teaching interested in that there's<br>scholarships around there there's Early<br>Childhood scholarships and secondary<br>there's Coupe scholarships for Maori in<br>Pacifica High Achievers High Achievers<br>that's a very broad depends on the<br>definition success a so that's quite a<br>broad definition there so check we don't<br>administer those scholarships ourselves<br>so the teach NZ scholarship website's<br>really good for that and there's other<br>scholarships around<br>otago as well so so those are some<br>scholarships most close on August the<br>15th and it could be that you've applied<br>for the scholarship and not heard back<br>from us yet okay to pie do it anyway<br>that's all good and it'll all come out<br>in the wash<br>um<br>just before we go into questions if you<br>want to study education so you might not<br>be interested in teaching at all you<br>might come to this and go oh I'm not so<br>sure there's really good careers by<br>studying education so you might just<br>want to study an education paper as part<br>of your degree you might want to study<br>an education paper as part of a ba you<br>can major in it as part of a Bachelor of<br>Arts or you might just want to do two or<br>three papers it goes really well with<br>law it goes really well with science<br>things like that so you can always just<br>study in education as part of your<br>degree you don't have to have studied<br>education if you're interested in doing<br>a master of teaching and learning so<br>it's just an option there for just<br>thinking about doing education papers<br>rather than teaching<br>and for those parents out there<br>be that you just come and do one paper<br>with us or an education<br>there's now an opportunity to ask<br>questions if you're on a live stream you<br>can send a message to that Facebook<br>group but are there any questions from<br>or anything that the student speakers<br>can think of that we haven't covered or<br>things that you were surprised about<br>questions<br>the slides<br>um are available I'm not sure how<br>the slides are available<br>yes<br>and we will put it on our Facebook page<br>how they are available when I find out<br>I've Got a Feeling last time I even we I<br>even made it to YouTube last year<br>yeah so good question are the slides<br>available as a question yes they are I<br>don't know how we'll put it on our<br>yeah you can email me but even better<br>I'll put it on the Facebook so that we<br>can we can do that good question any<br>this is called awkward wait time<br>teachers learn how to do it it's like<br>this<br>getting the rooms getting the room and<br>then when you're a teacher you slowly<br>walk around you slowly walk around and<br>you notice that someone's got their<br>laptop open are they on trade me hmm<br>ah yeah<br>a little bit online shopping<br>you learn all of those things about<br>physical prisons okay cake that pie<br>we'll leave it there and what we'll do<br>is we'll end with oh are there any um<br>questions that have come through<br>no that's fine or Caterpie so what we're<br>going to do is we're going to end with<br>um a so there's some contact details and<br>I can leave that up on the screen<br>afterwards<br>um<br>because we started with one a nice book<br>ended another photo of my beautiful<br>blueskin Bay and then we'll be up the<br>front for you to ask individual<br>questions because I know that some of<br>you might want to have a little bit more<br>Courier with people talking with people<br>about it and if people online want to<br>ask individual questions we'll answer<br>them in the next day or so because we're<br>probably all going home for a cup of tea<br>and a lie down after this<br>okay so it took me too and we'll do the<br>everyone thank you for coming out on<br>this dark and stormy no it's not warm<br>and balmy night of Dunedin it's winter<br>time it's 16 degrees and so welcome to<br>come down and ask us questions introduce<br>yourselves have a chat to the staff Kia</p></main><footer style="margin-top: 2rem; background: #0001; padding: 2rem;
