back to turangi which is south<br>of Topo I grew up in South Auckland and<br>I moved to waikato for University and I<br>loved it so much I haven't left since<br>so thank you for providing a little bit<br>about my background<br>um so yeah I'm a lecturer I teach<br>forensic psychology and crime science at<br>the University but today I'm here to<br>talk to you about responding to Family<br>Violence I'd like to provide a little<br>bit of a background and an overview of<br>what things look like at the moment talk<br>about you know how well the things we do<br>now are working and then think a little<br>bit about what we should be doing next<br>okay<br>here we go okay so I probably don't need<br>to convince you that Family Violence is<br>an important problem in aotearo and New<br>Zealand I think you're probably here<br>because you already think that am I<br>right<br>yeah and you would be right so Family<br>Violence is an important issue it's<br>something that many of us will have<br>experienced or know someone who has<br>experienced or at least heard of but<br>when we think about Family Violence<br>we're not often thinking about the<br>entire picture of the problem and what I<br>mean is when we talk about Family<br>Violence we're often thinking of<br>domestic abuse or intimate partner<br>relationships and harm that happens<br>within that context and that is<br>absolutely important and it's crucial<br>that we do a better job of under<br>understanding and responding to that<br>problem<br>but another part of the problem is of<br>course tamariki our children who are in<br>those situations<br>but also children themselves can be<br>aggressors of Family Violence<br>young people can harm their parents<br>people can harm grandparents and we also<br>see harm happening between siblings<br>and importantly when we see one type of<br>Family Violence more often than not<br>there's also other types of Family<br>Violence going on and taken together<br>what these things mean is that really<br>it's a much more complex problem than<br>how it's often represented studied<br>understood and importantly responded to<br>the other thing about Family Violence is<br>that when we use the word violence we're<br>thinking about physical harm aren't we<br>we're thinking about something like this<br>image here where there's a person<br>assaulting the other person that's what<br>comes to mind and again that's important<br>but Family Violence is also the chronic<br>or even not chronic just that emotional<br>or psychological harm that happens that<br>can really accumulate over time and<br>often when you speak to people who've<br>experienced Family Violence it's it's<br>these forms of harm that have the<br>greatest and often most long lasting<br>impact<br>can also include behaviors like threats<br>or intimidating behaviors as well as<br>damaging someone else's property or<br>harming their pits or other ways<br>controlling them through financial means<br>or other means<br>so I hope that what I've gotten across<br>to you is that the picture is much more<br>Broad and complicated<br>um harmful and you know difficult than<br>how it's often portrayed<br>so often people will ask well you know<br>how big is this problem we like to look<br>at statistics and I'm going to share<br>some with you just because it's nice to<br>set the scene but I think they'll also<br>illustrate some of those things that<br>I've just talked to you about in terms<br>of how difficult it is to understand<br>this problem<br>so a recent survey in 2019 of woman in<br>aotearoa found that<br>29.1 percent of women reported<br>experiencing physical intimate partner<br>violence in their lifetime so that's<br>around a third of women in this survey<br>said yes I've experienced this physical<br>form of intimate partner violence<br>33.2 percent of women of reported<br>experiencing two or more acts of<br>psychological abuse so that's things<br>like emotional abuse or name-calling and<br>these things don't necessarily overlap<br>so the proportion of women experiencing<br>this is quite quite considerable<br>furthermore<br>13.4 of women reported experiencing two<br>or more acts of controlling Behavior so<br>this is a bit different to psychological<br>abuse because controlling behavior is<br>more to do with exerting power or<br>limiting someone's Freedom so that might<br>be like you know controlling their<br>access to finances or not paying your<br>fair share or showing up at their work<br>or making it difficult to get work not<br>allowing them to see friends and family<br>those kinds of behaviors so it's not<br>psychological abuse necessarily although<br>they overlap it's more restricting that<br>person's freedom and of course this is<br>incredibly harmful and something that we<br>want to be responding to<br>but what this also illustrates is<br>depending on what type of harm you're<br>looking at you get really different<br>estimates of how much is occurring in<br>our communities<br>okay what about tamariki<br>so a recent report released by uh some<br>researchers from Auckland found that<br>almost a quarter of children in New<br>Zealand had been reported for child noun<br>treatment that they looked at<br>uh with the think about nine percent<br>being substantiated<br>3.1 percent of children experience<br>placements out of the home so being<br>taken into care<br>and if you look just at our Maori<br>tamariki that proportion that had<br>reportedly experienced child male<br>treatment was 42.2 percent<br>of the people that they studied so you<br>can see it's quite a large problem but<br>again we have the splintering where<br>we're looking at parts of the problem<br>separately we're looking at what are the<br>experiences of women and relationships<br>what are the experiences of children<br>but I think I don't need to convince you<br>that families don't exist of just<br>children or just women or just one<br>person families are entire units so it<br>is important that we're looking at the<br>whole unit<br>and the statistics we have at the moment<br>don't really allow us to do that or<br>don't allow us to do that very well so<br>it's quite hard to understand how these<br>overlap and from the perspective of a<br>practitioner thinking about how to keep<br>families safe I think that's really<br>important because I think it limits the<br>ability of the studies we're doing to<br>really inform the practices they use<br>because they're not necessarily<br>capturing that really complex picture<br>so if I try to find some statistics that<br>take that view<br>um they're not so detailed uh but I can<br>tell you that New Zealand Police<br>recorded 175<br>573 family hum investigations in the<br>year to June 2022 so family harm<br>investigations are what they record when<br>there's any type of incident reported<br>where the purported aggressor and victim<br>had any kind of family relationship<br>importantly people have to actually<br>report this for it to be recorded but it<br>doesn't necessarily need to contain what<br>we would call a crime so this is kind of<br>you know something like an argument over<br>a phone charger could qualify right up<br>through to really really serious harm<br>occurring so this hopefully gives us<br>more of an understanding of the picture<br>and I can tell you also that our<br>Frontline police are spending more than<br>40 percent of their time responding to<br>Family Violence so there are massive<br>massive quantity of events<br>there were also 67 000 reports of<br>concern made to order tamariki in the<br>year to September 2022 and those are<br>about 50 000 different children so you<br>can see there's a lot going on<br>the next one might shock you<br>I've just told you about the numbers and<br>the volume but 77 of offenses by family<br>members were not reported to police in<br>the last New Zealand crime and victims<br>survey<br>so if we look at the official statistics<br>which paint this picture of huge volume<br>and then we look at the victim surveys<br>which ask people you know okay what's<br>actually happened to you did you report<br>it or not<br>and three quarters of it's not being<br>reported and we still have this massive<br>volume we can see that this is a really<br>sizable problem it's a complex problem<br>it's also a sizable problem and what<br>we're doing at the moment isn't actually<br>reaching everyone in the community<br>so last one<br>with all of that said with this massive<br>volume we also know that between 2009<br>and 2015 there were 194 Family Violence<br>related deaths in aotearoa around half<br>of those due to intimate partner<br>violence but around half when<br>so massive massive volume<br>and yet<br>there's this small group of homicides<br>that we desperately want to prevent<br>right<br>so if you think in the shoes of a Family<br>Violence practitioner what a task<br>we have all these people experiencing<br>all of this harm we know that some<br>people are dying how on Earth do we<br>protect them better so that little<br>preload that's my motivation that's what<br>that's the context we're working in and<br>that's what we want to do a better job<br>of how do we find that 194 and intervene<br>so I like to use this image because this<br>is what the task feels like to me<br>how do we predict these things human<br>beings are inherently unpredictable<br>um and while it feels weird to with<br>these cases to just speculate speculate<br>about the future in that way<br>we kind of have to because when you have<br>such a volume of cases and limited<br>resources you have to try and allocate<br>those as best you can you have to try<br>and identify the people at most need and<br>you have to try and keep them safe right<br>but it does feel a little bit like<br>crystal ball gazing and that kind of<br>what that kind of is what it was before<br>researchers got involved and tried to<br>help and make it work a bit better<br>so thinking in the shoes of a Family<br>Violence practitioner<br>you've got you've got your case you're<br>thinking okay<br>I have these family members they have<br>these characteristics these things are<br>risky how do I combine that information<br>to make an educated guess<br>about how safe they are in the future<br>and what they might need in order to be<br>safe in the future<br>so we use this practice called risk<br>assessment and that's basically what it<br>is is researchers will find a collection<br>of factors that are associated with some<br>outcome in the future some criminal<br>outcomes so in the case of Family<br>Violence we might be interested in<br>predicting something like an offense<br>within a specified time frame so we<br>might want to know okay in the next two<br>years will this person be arrested for<br>an offense or uh I prefer will there be<br>another call for police service within a<br>certain amount of time which is the<br>lower threshold and it can include those<br>non-physical forms of harm whatever that<br>whatever the outcome is that you choose<br>you try and find which which pieces of<br>information are associated with that<br>outcome if we measure it so if we<br>measure this thing at time one will that<br>improve our ability to know the<br>likelihood of this other thing at time<br>too that's essentially<br>um the goal<br>and those uh factors are put into an<br>instrument so it will be it'll look like<br>a shopping list be like are these things<br>present and they'll be combined in some<br>way so it might be a sum of the items<br>they might have different weightings<br>according to how important they are so<br>in some instruments um things like<br>non-fatal strangulation have a much<br>higher weighting because they're thought<br>of as indicators of imminent lethality<br>and so if that thing is present they<br>Place more weighting on it compared with<br>something else<br>so each instrument has its own way of<br>combining things and then what comes out<br>often is a risk level low medium and<br>high that practitioners then used to<br>guide how they respond to that case<br>so low risk cases might receive a phone<br>call office for support maybe<br>encouragement to keep reporting in the<br>future say<br>moderate risk cases might receive maybe<br>a final support worker or you know<br>different things depending on what their<br>needs are<br>and the high risk cases receive really<br>intense support because those are the<br>situations where the onus for safety<br>moves from the people involved to<br>organizations for keeping those people<br>safe so that's a really small proportion<br>of cases what we end up with often is a<br>big lot of people in medium and very<br>small number of people in high and<br>we'll talk about that later<br>so<br>turning now to my research I've given<br>you a lot of background I've talked<br>about the problem and I've talked about<br>the idea of risk assessment<br>and I I guess I just want to note that<br>the solution to all of this<br>there's a lot of criticisms of risk<br>assessment many of which I agree with<br>but in the absence of a silver bullet<br>it's something to try and improve our<br>decision making<br>that's why we want to be critical of it<br>and think about how we could do it<br>better<br>so in my research that's what I've done<br>I've looked at how we're assessing risk<br>and thought about those opportunities so<br>I want to talk to you now about two<br>examples of studies where I did that<br>the first study was where I looked at<br>risk assessment that New Zealand Police<br>were doing for Family Violence cases so<br>the New Zealand Police have two<br>different risk assessment instruments<br>that they use for people experiencing<br>Family Violence<br>the first one is called the static<br>assessment of Family Violence recidivism<br>or safer is what I'm going to refer to<br>it as<br>and that's an instrument that is<br>basically measures the criminal history<br>of the person who's been identified as<br>the aggressor in a given case<br>so it looks at that person and goes okay<br>you know how many of these things have<br>you had in the past so it might be to do<br>with previous prison sentences or<br>offenses you know number of Family<br>Violence offenses things like that and<br>based on those those characteristics it<br>automatically generates a score low<br>medium or high that that police uh have<br>on it for an app when they attend at the<br>scene so they know what that that safer<br>score is<br>on the other hand the the Dira as I call<br>it the dynamic risk assessment<br>is something that police complete at the<br>scene so that's not completed from<br>archival you know data they have on file<br>that's completed in the Moment by asking<br>questions of the victim when they're<br>actually at the scene responding so<br>um<br>the number of questions depends on the<br>situation so in every case there will be<br>10 questions<br>if it involves intimate Partners there<br>will be a further two questions and if<br>children are involved there will be a<br>further four questions so it could have<br>anywhere between 10 and 16 questions<br>and these questions relate to the<br>current circumstances of the family so<br>it might be things like is the aggressor<br>experiencing any you know mental health<br>problems is there something currently<br>distressing there more things like that<br>I will also ask uh things to do with<br>yeah other stresses and whether they're<br>breaching conditions things like that so<br>things that have been identified as risk<br>factors<br>so that assessment is dynamic in that<br>it's trying to capture that current<br>circumstance so we've got one that's<br>about the history and one that's trying<br>to get at the now<br>and I was really interested to know um<br>how well this Dynamic one was working<br>because it was brand new<br>uh we've got pretty good evidence about<br>looking at criminal history it does well<br>to a point and then obviously there's<br>other things involved current<br>circumstances add so much so in this<br>study I was really interested to<br>establish the predictive validity of<br>this Dynamic assessment because it had<br>never been looked at before<br>including not before it was rolled out<br>so to answer this question we collected<br>police reports for<br>um about 2 000 episodes events reported<br>in waikato and Canterbury in November<br>and December 2018 and once we had<br>reports that were complete like had no<br>missing information that list left us<br>with about 1800.<br>what we did next was collect those two<br>different risk levels the low medium<br>high for both the safer and the direr<br>then we collected reports for episodes<br>that were reported over the next three<br>days three months and six months and the<br>reason we did that is because if<br>something's Dynamic it should be really<br>good at predicting in the short term and<br>they use it to inform a three-day safety<br>plan so we wanted to know was it useful<br>for that but also moving further out was<br>it useful for kind of medium term which<br>is where we're really trying to<br>intervene with people<br>and I looked at another report to police<br>not another offense<br>because uh<br>I think it's about<br>two-thirds of Family Violence incidents<br>reported to police<br>are not recorded as offenses<br>so if you have a hundred percent of<br>what's reported<br>30 percent will involve an offense and<br>10 percent will actually result in an<br>arrest so if you're only interested in<br>arrest or conviction you are missing a<br>massive amount of what's reported which<br>we know is again only 23 of what happens<br>so let's try and get as much as we can<br>right the best thing would be to call<br>everyone and ask them but I did not have<br>money to do that so<br>so instead I reported what was reported<br>over that time<br>and finally we looked at the<br>relationship between those initial risk<br>assessments and what happened next<br>what did we find<br>let's skip off that slide so basically<br>starting off with the safer<br>the safer did uh<br>a pretty good job at predicting<br>recurrence it did a really good job of<br>telling us who wasn't going to have<br>another event so when we looked at the<br>low risk category most of them did not<br>have a recurrence reported to police<br>that's great news<br>however when we looked at the moderate<br>and the high risk category again a lot<br>of people did not have a recurrence<br>reported to police<br>so what what that's telling us is that<br>it's a very risk-averse it's screening<br>in a lot of people that it might not<br>need to but personally I actually think<br>that's okay if it's just a first<br>triaging step if it's doing a good job<br>of telling us who's probably not going<br>to be unsafe that's okay we can move<br>forward if we have an assessment that<br>helps us better identify the people who<br>are at risk<br>and that's what I hoped that the Dira<br>would do but unfortunately the dynamic<br>questions was only marginally better<br>than chance at predicting what would<br>happen next<br>so yeah that's interesting right you<br>would think it would be better<br>um there could be some opportunity to<br>improve this tool<br>it showed the same pattern as the safer<br>where the low risk people tended to be<br>low risk but then medium and High<br>um<br>I should say this about 40 of people<br>were high on the safer like that's all<br>that's a lot of people for high risk so<br>you can see it's very risk-averse<br>screening people in rather than out<br>um but with the Dira um you know has<br>lots of questions for ipv has lots of<br>questions for when children are present<br>so four ipv cases it was better for<br>chart better than chance but four cases<br>that were not intimate partner violence<br>which remember is about a third of the<br>sample it wasn't better than chance so<br>it's doing a really poor job for these<br>other family relationships which<br>represent a big part of the problem as<br>well<br>and also both instruments performed more<br>poorly when the aggressor was a woman<br>when the aggressor was Maori and for<br>those non-intimate partner relationships<br>so they're doing a good job with uh<br>pakiha nin who are harming their<br>Partners which matches up with that idea<br>of Family Violence and isn't capturing<br>that kind of more intricate picture that<br>I talked about before<br>so I think that's really interesting and<br>I think it's really clear what we can do<br>next to improve this instrument<br>um basically collecting more data and<br>thinking about how it matches um<br>people in aotearoa<br>the dynamic instrument I know already<br>that in response to these findings New<br>Zealand Police have been working on<br>improving that so that's really really<br>great and shows the benefits of doing<br>this type of research finding you know<br>these things are working these bits<br>aren't and here's where to go next I<br>think that's valuable<br>so I mentioned before that after New<br>Zealand police respond to an event there<br>might be some further responses down the<br>line<br>and that's what I was interested in next<br>I was interested in the decision making<br>of the practitioners who respond to<br>people experiencing Family Violence<br>after that initial police response<br>because we do put a lot of focus on what<br>police are doing and I would argue that<br>a lot of they work to be done in this<br>space isn't necessarily work for police<br>so in waikato and Canterbury this is<br>really dark<br>um<br>in waikato and Canterbury uh<br>every case of Family Violence that's<br>reported to police is passed off to the<br>integrated safety response for further<br>risk assessment triaging and case<br>management so regardless of what risk<br>level you get on the dire and the safer<br>you get passed on that's actually very<br>unique internationally in places like<br>the UK you only go to these multi-agency<br>responses if you're already high risk so<br>it's a very small proportion of people<br>that get this extra support and in in<br>New Zealand at the moment everyone's<br>being referred on so again massive<br>volume but I think it's a great<br>opportunity to potentially catch people<br>who we might have missed earlier<br>so what happens at the integrated safety<br>response is you have a team of<br>Representatives so this includes people<br>from police atapotama Corrections<br>Ministry for Children<br>Health ewe ACC other ngos are<br>represented there and they meet every<br>day virtually sometimes twice a day to<br>discuss cases that have recently been<br>reported to police so ideally this<br>meeting would happen within three days<br>of the event itself<br>what they do is they read through the<br>police report of you know the<br>description of the event and they also<br>before that meeting will go into their<br>own organization's database and look up<br>the people involved and see oh well this<br>person actually has several uh incidents<br>of falling down the stairs recently<br>maybe I should share that information<br>might know that this person has a care<br>history or they have children in care<br>for example or things like that so what<br>that means is they can come to the table<br>they can share information only<br>information that is relevant not just<br>everything that they have on file only<br>things that are relevant to keeping them<br>safe<br>and that hopefully enables them to<br>perform a more complete<br>risk assessment right so police do what<br>they do on the scene and they do their<br>best on the scene and the idea is that<br>this is an opportunity for organizations<br>to fill in the gaps in that next step<br>so what they do currently is the<br>representatives around this table they<br>go through the report they share their<br>information and then they kind of shout<br>out into the room what they think are<br>the risk factors present in this case<br>and there's someone in the room who<br>writes the stump<br>and then they collaboratively agree<br>don't ask me how<br>on a risk category flow moderate or high<br>what do they think the risk is for this<br>whanau so I said before that the safer<br>about 40 get high risk for the isr1 it<br>can be around six percent maybe to ten<br>so it's really small proportion at a<br>high risk quite a lot are low risk and<br>quite a lot again are medium risk so<br>I mean it it's always arguable on<br>whether we're getting that right I<br>actually think personally that having<br>five categories would be better than<br>three I think three is far too simple<br>um and there's lots of research to<br>support that<br>but<br>it's also all to do with the resourcing<br>that's available and the support that<br>high-risk cases require and receive is<br>so so intensive that that could also<br>play into the proportion that are<br>allocated as high<br>just food for thought<br>so to investigate the predictive<br>validity of these assessments we again<br>had the same sample but it's a half a<br>sample because I had to spend a year of<br>my life hand coding all those risk<br>factors that they shouted out in the<br>room because they weren't systematically<br>recorded and they would you know they<br>would write things in different ways and<br>and all of just as we as we do so I<br>spent a very long time hand coding all<br>of these so that we could analyze them<br>because as well as knowing how well the<br>overall assessments and categories were<br>doing we wanted to know if these were<br>even risk factors were these things that<br>they were thinking of as risky were they<br>actually associated with what happened<br>next<br>so the first step was recording all of<br>that coding all the risk factors and<br>then again collecting reports about what<br>happened next and this time because I<br>was interested in a medium-term response<br>I just took a six-month time frame<br>instead of that really short time frame<br>and I looked at whether or not there was<br>another report so recurrence and whether<br>or not there was any physical violence<br>so two different measures and I did that<br>because the integrated safety response<br>is interested in will it happen again so<br>that's their level of concern but also<br>how much harm is going to happen and<br>that's really hard to quantify but I use<br>physical violence kind of as an<br>indicator for that<br>and again finally I analyze the<br>predictive validity<br>what did I find<br>wow another uh telling image I found<br>that uh fewer than half of those factors<br>that they were recording and using to<br>inform their judgments were risk factors<br>so a lot of things that they were<br>considering were things that might well<br>be concerning but weren't risk factors<br>in the you know traditional very strict<br>definition of it they weren't associated<br>with what happened next they could well<br>be useful for informing how to reach<br>whanau or engage with them which is also<br>important and I looked at it in a<br>different city that I'm not going to<br>talk about but<br>if this is about risk assessment fewer<br>than half of the factors were actually<br>risk factors and I think that that is<br>important<br>regarding the predictive validity I have<br>that same image from before so this<br>instrument fell somewhere between<br>police's safer that did pretty good and<br>the dire out that not so good so this<br>was somewhere in between there and you<br>know what I was pleasantly surprised<br>because when I saw how unstructured<br>these assessments were and that they<br>weren't combining them in a systematic<br>way they were kind of just consensus<br>agreeing I was a little bit concerned<br>that<br>you know we don't know how this is going<br>to go right but actually not not too bad<br>which is great it shows that there is<br>there are merits clearly to professional<br>judgment also they are doing these<br>assistants knowing what the direct and<br>safer were too so maybe those played<br>into it<br>but again just like the instruments I<br>discussed before<br>they performed more poorly for<br>non-intimate partner cases which are a<br>considerable proportion of what's<br>Happening<br>more poorly for women and also more<br>poorly for Maori so clearly there is a<br>lot of work to be done in this space<br>so I talked a lot and a lot about risk<br>assessment<br>and<br>the thing is we can criticize these<br>instruments for only predicting so much<br>or being this good or whatever<br>but human behavior is inherently<br>difficult to predict right our lives<br>change so rapidly we do have some degree<br>of Free Will and so I believe in many of<br>my colleagues believe that there's a<br>ceiling to how much we could predict<br>anyway right<br>so if these are doing a good job of<br>improving our decision making or helping<br>us making better decisions I don't think<br>perfect is actually realistic we need to<br>think about user friendly one of the<br>problems in my first study was we know<br>that the dire is quite tedious to fill<br>out so many police who are very busy<br>just don't do it<br>so actually can we think about how to<br>guide decision making in ways that are<br>used and helpful and have good<br>productive validity I think that those<br>are also important goals<br>another thing that is just so important<br>to mention is I've talked about<br>interventions right that's the point of<br>the integrated safety response even<br>police arriving that's an intervention<br>but it's not recorded well so in this<br>study in these studies I've said to you<br>oh well it did this well at predicting<br>but if the thing that you're trying to<br>predict is also the thing you're<br>actively trying to prevent then not<br>predicting it that well could well mean<br>you've done your job<br>it could well mean you've predicted uh<br>prevented it yeah predicted it and then<br>prevented it so that's actually also a<br>potentially good outcome<br>so that's something I'm trying to work<br>on next is improving the way that we<br>record what we're doing with families<br>after so that we can account for that<br>when we're looking at whether our<br>decision making is any good<br>because especially with the high risk<br>cases right like I said it does well at<br>screening out the low risk not so good<br>at telling what's going to happen with<br>high risk but I know that we're doing<br>more to intervene with high-risk cases<br>so if we've got lots of high-risk cases<br>who don't have things happen in the<br>future that's good news right but I<br>really want to know if that's if that's<br>actually what's happening or if I'm just<br>being optimistic so clearly there's more<br>but going back to the slide that I<br>showed you before with all the numbers<br>massive volume of reports massive<br>massive volume<br>and it's only 23 of what's Happening<br>so everything I've talked to you about<br>about today is in the context of what<br>we're doing with about a quarter of<br>people experiencing<br>what's going on right<br>so people like me can send their offices<br>and Whittle away on optimizing the way<br>we make our decisions but if we aren't<br>getting better at preventing this harm<br>from occurring in the first place then<br>we're actually not going to affect the<br>problem that much right<br>so of course we want to do better at<br>responding we want to be more inclusive<br>we want to do better for our Maori<br>whanau for our aggressor to a woman for<br>our people who are experiencing<br>non-intimate partner and the people who<br>are experiencing this in general right<br>we want to be doing better<br>but also I think a big part of that is<br>getting back down to these root causes<br>so these things that we're identifying<br>and as risk factors and and measuring we<br>should be trying to reduce those in our<br>communities before we get these things<br>that are reported or not reported<br>so hopefully we can do some more work in<br>that space as well<br>and I know that the government have<br>recently embarked on a new strategy for<br>family and sexual violence called<br>and these are just the themes that came<br>out of their most recent Hui about that<br>strategy so this is this is interesting<br>pulling these things together because we<br>know a lot of sexual violence obviously<br>it's part of Family Violence and they<br>overlap to a great degree<br>and many of the challenges and things<br>that need to happen in these spaces are<br>very similar<br>but the reason I included this this<br>slide is because it pretty closely<br>mirrors the conclusions and the papers<br>that I've been writing about what we<br>need to do in the space<br>so many of the things to do with<br>addressing inequities leadership from<br>communities and really involving them<br>and a shared pathway forward that's<br>actually married in all aspects of the<br>space right so<br>I'm going to keep going on trying to<br>improve responses but I'm also hopefully<br>going to be part of work thinking about<br>preventing in in the first place<br>so that's everything from me<br>thanks for having me if you have<br>questions and these are QR codes for the<br>two studies that I just shared with you<br>ladies and gentlemen Simpson let's have<br>a round of applause before we before we<br>April thank you you're very articulate<br>and clearly very passionate and it's<br>fantastic to have you with us<br>ladies and gentlemen any questions from<br>the floor for April<br>yes sir can you stand please and project<br>your voice would be great we want to use<br>this you should we can throw that or be<br>careful<br>follow me back<br>yeah<br>hey we're going to tell us the<br>dedication system you've used is that<br>model anywhere else are you working yeah<br>so I just use New Zealand polices<br>database so<br>New Zealand yes<br>yes<br>uh so I recorded just everything that<br>was reported to police so they just uh I<br>had I had access to theirs and this is<br>something that we do in other countries<br>looking at what's reported and it really<br>just relies on<br>the trust and good relationship that we<br>have with them so they do it in lots of<br>countries uh and this type of research<br>has been done in many countries what was<br>unique about my work is that often this<br>this work is done with people in prison<br>and it's done just looking at offenses<br>say so you'll have an assessment and<br>then you'll look to someone go to prison<br>in a year or two years<br>what was unique in this sense was we<br>were looking at what's reported we were<br>getting at a bigger proportion of what's<br>going on so<br>it's been done everywhere but the<br>difference is trying to look at a lower<br>threshold of harm not just what's ending<br>up in the correctional system what I'm<br>interested in this Benchmark<br>where did we rank on the world scene in<br>terms<br>yeah tonight to the 1960s when this<br>absolutely really<br>provocative things that the New Zealand<br>Society for sure to rugby for example<br>yes yes yeah so I would like to<br>Benchmark it so we know where we are<br>otherwise<br>um yeah I hear you so the question is<br>where are we in terms of the problem or<br>in terms of the assessment instruments<br>is is that what you're asking<br>like how well the instruments are doing<br>I'm not like okay it's not a good<br>example for me yeah Finland and<br>Switzerland or the Scandinavian group<br>per se as I am yeah<br>situation than we do yeah<br>uh maybe not uh so yes I hear you um so<br>the these instruments are<br>bespoke based on instruments in the US<br>in Canada in the UK in Europe<br>this one in Spain it's Global so there<br>are some really well-known ones in fact<br>we used to use one called the odara<br>which was used in Canada we use that<br>here for many years and then we found<br>that it wasn't quite meeting the<br>standards that New Zealand Police had<br>and So based on that they decided to<br>develop their own new one so that's why<br>we have these ones so it is bespoke<br>based on our context but it's using the<br>the method this this way of pulling<br>together information and and using that<br>to guide decisions is very well<br>established on the international stage<br>New Zealand Police are regarded quite<br>highly in the space for the efforts<br>especially the idea of using one for<br>criminal history and one to get at<br>what's happening now because a lot of<br>people just rely on criminal history<br>which misses a big part of the the<br>picture so did that answer the question<br>yes<br>so we'll give somebody else an<br>opportunity is that okay you can speak<br>to April after anybody else an<br>opportunity to ask a question yes please<br>ma'am<br>um<br>foreign<br>yes I will I'll do my best to work<br>through those uh so the first question<br>was about the extent to which things<br>have been implemented uh so the first<br>study I talked about the one on the left<br>um New Zealand Police were really<br>receptive to I presented it multiple<br>times to different parts of police and<br>they after my study was published they<br>commissioned a further review into their<br>Dynamic assessment instrument which<br>backed up what I said I looked at more<br>data and different outcomes and found<br>much the same picture and now they're<br>working on how to improve that<br>instrument part of that might be<br>changing what questions they're asking<br>it might be reducing the number of<br>questions they're asking<br>so lots of work being done in that space<br>I also have relationships with the<br>integrated safety response which was the<br>second paper I talked about and in that<br>space uh I'm actually meeting with them<br>soon actually to talk with them more<br>they're it's really um<br>quite unique internationally the the<br>relationships that we have at tipuna<br>hamaru the institute for security and<br>crime science with organizations in the<br>community in that they are part of the<br>research they hear the findings and they<br>can use that moving forward so we don't<br>just extract their data and publish over<br>here and never speak with them again<br>they are involved in feedback too and<br>I'm doing a new study with them now also<br>which is looking at their perspectives<br>of the challenges in Service delivery<br>like what you mentioned before so<br>obviously we always want to implement<br>more but I think as far as research goes<br>this is this has been going quite well<br>um the second question you had was about<br>Mental Health<br>um<br>I think that<br>it is part of the problem and in my<br>opinion part of the problem is that<br>it's so difficult to get Mental Health<br>Services that you do have to call police<br>because who else is on call 24 7<br>and ambulances don't come<br>so<br>we end up with a lot of people uh<br>receiving responses from police that<br>perhaps might be better served by other<br>services<br>um so yes I think you're correct I don't<br>think that we can use mental health<br>issues to explain Family Violence<br>because I think that it happens for many<br>reasons and many people are not mentally<br>ill and many people are mentally ill and<br>it's nothing to do with the Family<br>Violence but I do think we have a<br>problem whereby access to Mental Health<br>Services is really lacking so the<br>problems might overlap but I do think<br>they're different problems that are both<br>really important and need to be better<br>served<br>thank you April yes ma'am part of them<br>nowhere else<br>yeah<br>absolutely<br>um<br>of course that's and that's really kind<br>ongoing<br>I I agree with you 100 so I should have<br>addressed that um the integrated safety<br>response is<br>quite unique we have responses like<br>whanganada fungi in Auckland but again<br>they're not well resourced and I don't<br>think there's an excuse for that I don't<br>um we clearly need this everywhere in<br>the country to support our organizations<br>who are responding in this space<br>um and I agree with you about the<br>dynamic questions<br>coming away from this research so when I<br>went into it I thought oh we could just<br>have one assessment that could be used<br>for every family and police could just<br>ask it and that would solve everything<br>that's what I thought and then four<br>years later I believed that we could<br>have an initial assessment that Police<br>use like that static one that's on<br>criminal history and then once we get a<br>bit of grip on what things are actually<br>risk factors for the different contexts<br>that people are experiencing so the<br>overlapping forms of harm the different<br>whanau contexts that could be a<br>specialized assessment that our<br>practitioners are doing to refine our<br>knowledge because I agree with you we<br>know that in that moment people are<br>having you know potentially the worst<br>day of their lives this is maybe not a<br>good time to collect information from<br>those people right like sure we want to<br>do it but I I agree with you that<br>practitioners especially those who have<br>a pre-existing relationship with that<br>person probably have a much better job<br>of evaluating their safety so I think<br>that if we had the funding and the will<br>to support things like ISR and other<br>parts of the country that could be a<br>space to empower a practitioners to<br>actually do those assessments so I agree<br>with you completely<br>is<br>yes and I'm thankful that they're still<br>going but it is a big disparity to have<br>things this unified in some communities<br>and they're not in other communities<br>um I mean hopefully if we can do<br>research showing how effective it is or<br>what what's going well that could add<br>support for that argument of providing<br>it in other communities too I actually<br>recently was involved with a police<br>officer in the Bay of Plenty who was<br>launching a proceeds of crime funding<br>application to hire Family Violence<br>Specialists for this region who would<br>pull those that information together but<br>again that's a big rigmarole to apply<br>for funding for a limited time to hire<br>two or three people so it's um it's one<br>of the largest barriers in the space is<br>funding and that's already coming out of<br>the next study that we're doing<br>thank you April and thank you for that<br>Insight on the ground here in Tauranga<br>for your service ma'am for you and your<br>colleagues here today<br>final question anybody else yes please<br>sir do you understand please thank you<br>foreign<br>which was about where were these models<br>based on and they are based on overseas<br>they're based on overseas research and<br>understandings of what risk factors are<br>of what family violence is of who<br>aggressors are<br>and when the knowledge base we have for<br>responding to this problem is based on<br>studying white men in prison in North<br>America it's not surprising that when we<br>use those ideas to inform how we do<br>things here that it falls short for many<br>people in our community<br>um I think that like I said before some<br>kind of Baseline criminal history thing<br>for that immediate response and then a<br>more tailored response<br>at the next step where we look at risk<br>factors that are relevant for say<br>aggressive to our women aggressive Maori<br>that to me is maybe how we should be<br>moving forward because<br>we all like something unified and neat<br>but when you're basing that off part of<br>the population it's not going to work<br>um we might like it too and the other<br>thing is when we create risk assessment<br>instruments usually we're doing it on<br>data that we have so I looked at data<br>that New Zealand Police held and we know<br>that there are biases in the system as<br>it works at the moment we know that<br>might be hard to pinpoint but we know<br>that they're there so when you create<br>these instruments say you're using 10<br>years worth of data and you're trying<br>really hard to be unbiased you're still<br>creating an instrument based on that<br>you're looking at what happens and what<br>happens next Based On A system that we<br>feel is biased so then we create an<br>instrument which on the surface might<br>look very very objective but the data<br>used to create it still has those biases<br>in it so there's still a lot more work<br>to be done in this space to find<br>different ways of measuring the problem<br>more fairly so that we can create<br>instruments that are measuring the<br>outcomes more fairly because for example<br>if we conceptualize family violences<br>only something that men do against their<br>wives<br>is that not then what Society will<br>report to us is happening<br>and when other things are happening it<br>might be treated differently or doubt is<br>a family manner matter or overlooked or<br>things like that so it's all of these<br>kind of Frameworks that we import from<br>overseas or or from history kind of um<br>then uh shape what it is that we're<br>recording and then what we use to<br>predict the future so these are really<br>difficult problems to untangle but I<br>think just taking a step back and trying<br>to not do everything at once and just do<br>little bits well is the way to better<br>serve everyone in our community<br>thank you ladies and gentlemen a round</p></main><footer
