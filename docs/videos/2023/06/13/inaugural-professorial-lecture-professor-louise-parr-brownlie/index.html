here stand<br>forever but in case there is some doubt<br>about that emergency exits are to the<br>left and the right and please follow a<br>staff member if we do need to evacuate<br>they will help find a good place to be<br>um<br>uh Cura everyone welcome I'll go through<br>quite a number of greetings because<br>we've got a number of people to to<br>Christine Neil will<br>Patricia other uh of our distinguished<br>and of course um of course Louise<br>Louise<br>tinakoto others um<br>we have um a number of special guests<br>I'd like to particularly welcome<br>McCarthy and Jim mitson uh special<br>visitors today uh tinakarua and<br>um<br>we're celebrating in an inaugural<br>professorial lecture which is the<br>Journey of an academic to our Peak<br>academic position here at the University<br>of otago and it's an occasion that is<br>often shared with special guests far now<br>of the of the recipient and so with us<br>here uh Gordon uh Louise's husband your<br>father Barry welcome<br>um sister and brother Amy and Jonathan<br>and in-laws Jackie Stephen Karen and Joe<br>and uh uh cousin Mark that have come uh<br>tenakoto to you all and I understand uh<br>that there are a number of special<br>guests family friends<br>supporters what have we got minty's<br>collaborators and colleagues from both<br>Dunedin and uh the hallway father the<br>Four Winds that are here joining us in<br>person or online so welcome welcome and<br>Thrice welcome and also welcome to those<br>members of the university community and<br>the members of the Dunedin public who<br>have joined us here tonight for the<br>celebration<br>an inaugural professorial lectures are<br>just that and oh by the way um Kawa uh<br>call Richard Blakey takawingawa<br>um<br>I'm uh Richard Blakey I'm a deputy Vice<br>Chancellor for research and Enterprise<br>and uh bring the greetings of the vice<br>chants The Professor David Murdock who<br>unfortunately is not able to join us<br>tonight to<br>join in the celebration of Louise's<br>promotion<br>professorial lectures are a time where<br>we as academic leaders of the University<br>not only can invite others to to hear<br>the story of someone's academic journey<br>to professorship often which<br>incorporates a personal Journey as well<br>but also it's actually a bit of a<br>selfish time it's academic Spa time for<br>us that allows us to just learn<br>something new about one one of our<br>colleagues and understand the depth and<br>breadth of their scholarship<br>promotion to Professor is a a very very<br>significant achievement and we use<br>international benchmarking in order to<br>determine who should be awarded such<br>privilege the criteria are demanding and<br>require significant<br>um<br>performance at the highest International<br>level across teaching research and<br>service the core components of our<br>University academic roles but in<br>particular what we look for is<br>leadership and sustained leadership and<br>um following me uh Professor Matsu Smith<br>the dean of the school of biomedical<br>science will give a more detailed<br>introduction to Professor par brownlee's<br>career and you'll see that not only has<br>her research been at the highest level<br>across a number of disciplines her<br>teaching and commitment to teaching is<br>very very impressive but in particular<br>service and leadership are things that I<br>am very very appreciative of in my roles<br>as a senior leader in the University but<br>also I sit and wonder at how all of<br>these things were achieved through one<br>individual so<br>the order of proceedings is that we'll<br>have a more formal introduction for our<br>speaker Louise will talk there will be a<br>number of<br>thanks and congratulations uh including<br>a vote of thanks after which we'll<br>invite you all to the staff Club to join<br>us in celebration so before Professor<br>Mata Sue Smith comes up to give a more<br>detailed introduction please Louise<br>accept on behalf of the University our<br>most heartfelt and Hearty<br>my name is Lisa Madison Smith and as<br>Professor Blakey said I am the acting<br>dean of the school of biomedical<br>sciences and it truly is an honor and a<br>pleasure and a joy to be introducing uh<br>Louise and her IPL tonight I was<br>formerly the head of Department of<br>anatomy so<br>um<br>I not only got to work with Louise<br>teaching with Louise in in some of the<br>very first teaching that I did here when<br>I got to the University of otago we<br>taught some musculoskeletal<br>sections together but as head of<br>Department I got to be part of the<br>planning process I suppose to to get<br>Louise to this point tonight so it is<br>truly truly a joy to have have watched<br>her progress through the ranks of<br>lecture and Senior lecture and associate<br>professor and so deservedly hear tonight<br>so a bit about Louise we're going to<br>hopefully we will I'm sure be hearing a<br>lot more about Louise uh and her journey<br>so I will try to just keep this short<br>because it will be much more interesting<br>coming directly from her but um<br>we started uh here at the University of<br>otago doing a bachelor of physical<br>education which she obtained in 1992 and<br>then went on to go be a teaching fellow<br>and then Senior teaching fellow in the<br>department of physiology here at the<br>University of otago followed by a master<br>of science in physiology from otago<br>which was awarded in<br>1999.<br>this was followed by her PhD in<br>physiology in 2003 and then she went off<br>and did the classic postdoctoral<br>fellowship and research fellowship at<br>the neurophysiological pharmacology<br>section at the National Institute of<br>neurological disorders and stroke at the<br>National Institute of Health in the U.S<br>she came back to New Zealand very<br>thankfully and worked as a research<br>fellow in the department of physiology<br>and then we stole her in the department<br>of anatomy which she joined as a<br>lecturer in 2010 then was promoted to<br>senior lecture in 2015 associate<br>professor in 2020 and here we are now at<br>this wonderful celebration of your<br>professorship<br>so as you've already heard and as it<br>will be very very clear after tonight's<br>IPO Louise is a national and<br>international leader in biomedical<br>research her research examines the role<br>of the motor Thalamus and controlling<br>movements and explores how the structure<br>is affected in movement disorders and<br>translates her findings to explore<br>potential future treatment options<br>in the middle of about 2018 her lab<br>began to use qualitative techniques also<br>to explore Maori perspectives on<br>neurological Neurosurgical techniques to<br>treat neurological disease and traumatic<br>traumatic brain injury<br>her study was funded by the brnz the<br>brain research<br>in Research Institute of New Zealand<br>and their<br>preliminaries finding findings basically<br>allowed them to continue to obtain<br>research funding to look at how Maori<br>have traditionally maintained brain<br>health and treated brain disorders<br>now currently sadly there are no<br>treatments to prevent Parkinson's<br>disease but Louise's lab is working on<br>really understanding how<br>neuroinflammation underlies Parkinson's<br>disease to test dietary components and<br>drugs that might slow or stop the<br>progression of the disease and I guess<br>we'll be hearing quite a lot about this<br>tonight<br>so her research has been funded through<br>a range of agencies health research<br>Council Marsden fund brnz the core<br>Center of research excellence and the<br>neurological Foundation of New Zealand<br>among others<br>and her leadership and internationally<br>her leadership in Parkinson's disease<br>was was recognized when she was made as<br>Secretary of the council for the<br>international basal ganglia society and<br>of course through the numerous<br>invitations she has internationally to<br>give plenaries and<br>and and research talks on her on her<br>work<br>um but what has been truly amazing to<br>kind of watch happen is that real<br>leadership<br>um<br>and in Science Leadership that uh Louise<br>has really uh moved into over the last<br>five years I suppose<br>um in particular<br>um her her work with the Aging well<br>National Science challenge where she<br>started as deputy director in 2018 and<br>then 2019<br>co-director of Aging well and then from<br>2020 through now she is the the director<br>of the the Aging well National Science<br>challenge she's also the chair of the<br>rawika mangai Maori directors Envision<br>mataranga leaders across the 11 National<br>Science challenges<br>she's also a member of napayote<br>maramatanga the center of research<br>Excellence um<br>that's based up in Auckland<br>she is<br>part of numerous research themes both in<br>terms of of her Parkinson's research and<br>the impact of her research for Maori and<br>in New Zealand more generally<br>um of course she is also been involved<br>with the Ministry of Health and stirring<br>groups implementing implementing healthy<br>aging strategies and with the ministry<br>for the environment mataranga science<br>and insights contributing to to the<br>panel research there<br>in addition to all of this of course<br>she's still supervising numerous<br>students PhD students Master students<br>and honor students<br>and doing an outstanding job teaching in<br>not just the anatomy program but but<br>several other programs across the<br>division<br>a<br>I've been speaking enough and I don't<br>want to go on anymore because it's much<br>more<br>important that we hear the story<br>of this amazing weaving of matarang<br>amauri and and Science<br>and please join me then in welcoming<br>Louise to present her IPL which is so<br>aptly entitled weaving equity in<br>is<br>so my goodness it's a pleasure to be<br>here today and to see so many friends in<br>the audience and students and so many<br>people that have contributed to my<br>journey<br>thank you to the university leaders for<br>that lovely introduction and to my<br>family and friends so many of you have<br>traveled so far in order to be here so I<br>really appreciate that<br>and I appreciate all of you taking a<br>little bit of time out of your day to<br>come and listen to about my research<br>Journey this is a huge moment for me<br>it's actually the first time that any of<br>my family have heard me talk and most of<br>my friends away from the University have<br>ever heard me talk as well so<br>um buckle up we're going on a journey<br>and you're about to find out exactly<br>what I've been doing with my career<br>so the place I'm going to start are cool<br>wayo I'm actually going to start with<br>the past side of the family and Dad's<br>word we come from northern<br>Nottinghamshire and the from Robin Hood<br>country and we've been there for many<br>centuries now the men of Dad's family<br>um have mostly worked down the pit or<br>the coal mines but Dad had a different<br>Journey he became a tool maker and that<br>gave him the opportunity to actually<br>immigrate to New Zealand<br>on my mum's side all of my grandparents<br>were born in aotearo New Zealand<br>throughout the North Island but my<br>grandparents they'd all moved and by the<br>time they my grandparents came along<br>they were all living in tamakimikoru<br>so my whakapaka comes from my maternal<br>yet I have two French names so I'm<br>actually named after one of my mother's<br>favorite aunties Auntie Lou and my<br>middle names I share with my grandma my<br>nana my mother and also my niece Shelby<br>so in my early years I grew up in tool<br>Bay in Tamaki Makoto and it was a life<br>where I was playing with on bikes and<br>homemade trolleys and the cul-de-sac<br>with all the neighborhood kids<br>the whanau always gathered at our<br>grandparents place in Glen Innes for<br>Christmas for birthdays for actually<br>anything<br>and during that time we would be playing<br>board games we would be playing cards<br>and they had a mini golf uh area outside<br>and so we would always have this<br>Gathering of whanau and this really<br>positive energy whenever we were<br>together<br>but as a kid I was mad on Sport and I<br>played netball basketball ran Athletics<br>and cross country but the sport that I<br>loved and I was best at was orienteering<br>and orienteering the reason I loved it<br>is because there was all the problem<br>solving that went along as I was going<br>around the event and I got to go to some<br>really remote places that you don't<br>normally get to see so it was a really<br>privilege to be able to do that<br>now in my late teenage years my life<br>became the circle of training then going<br>and working so that I could then go and<br>travel and go to all these events and<br>compete and I've put a couple of photos<br>up there that are very memorable for me<br>the one at the bottom is the first time<br>the New Zealand team beat Australia and<br>the trans-tasmond competition which is<br>awesome and then the top one<br>um what's memorable about that when I<br>was in Australia for the first time and<br>I was running along in a grassy area and<br>all I heard think of Jurassic Park<br>dinosaurs coming along bang bang bang<br>and what I turned around was<br>um there were these giant red a mob of<br>giant red kangaroos coming along and I<br>couldn't believe it I sort of stopped<br>and just watched them and then kind of<br>went oh come on you're competing and<br>then continued on<br>so it was this love of sport that meant<br>that I came to otago to do a bachelor of<br>physical education but there was no<br>expectation I would because all of my<br>whanau they're mostly tradies so they're<br>really supportive of me doing this but<br>this was an unusual step in alfano<br>but I didn't want to do biology<br>chemistry or physics yet I do all of<br>them now and I remember saying at the<br>end of my final year at school well if I<br>don't get into physics school I'm not<br>going to go at all<br>so somehow applying the knowledge of<br>Science and was just the right thing for<br>me and phys Ed was also a really good<br>choice so at that time it was a closed<br>course with only a hundred places and<br>over 800 people applied and my<br>classmates originally were my friends<br>but because of the events that we did<br>going to camp and going to prax and the<br>teamwork and the trust that you had to<br>have with them they actually became a<br>Dunedin whanau and I ended up flirting<br>with a bunch of them and staying good<br>friends with so many of them throughout<br>my life<br>and about a year after this there were a<br>couple of key events that happened over<br>a six-month period<br>so the first one is I met Gordon and my<br>family got even bigger so thank you<br>brownies<br>over the years our values and priorities<br>have made it so easy for us to be<br>together but our differences have kept<br>it all really interesting so for you<br>good and you're a first generation New<br>Zealander of Scots descent and your work<br>has been in construction and of heavy<br>transport so that means I know way too<br>much about log book regulations and I<br>know that tires on graters are ballasted<br>but that knowledge keeps me grounded<br>into the other jobs that kind people<br>have<br>but over the years you've also learned<br>to navigate having an academic wife and<br>so when you ask questions you ask them<br>very carefully and I'm sure the words<br>that you use before I start you actually<br>give me the questions are<br>I want the short answer not the<br>scientist answer<br>it turns out that that was a really good<br>way of making me become a good science<br>Communicator know your audience and<br>Target your message keep it succinct<br>but I have a word to say to my aging<br>well colleagues so a few years ago I got<br>a secret santa present and I had very<br>clear instructions on how this had to be<br>used<br>so I'm sure Gordon is forever grateful<br>to them for this these series of cups<br>so Gordon thank you for sharing my life<br>and sharing my journey you support me in<br>more ways than you can I can ever<br>explain and it's been a pleasure over<br>the years<br>event that happened around that same<br>time as I became a teaching fellow in<br>physiology and I loved teaching but the<br>for this particular Journey it was the<br>opportunity to have my eyes opened to<br>research and I did a couple of Summer<br>scholarships and then went on to<br>postgraduate study<br>so I had a group of postgraduate friends<br>and colleagues that are lifelong friends<br>and even now when I play a game of uh<br>Settlers of Catan with die and Fran<br>first of all my ears burn because I<br>swear so much but then um it's all the<br>memories of people and places and the<br>things that we did back in those years<br>I did my PhD in physiology as well and I<br>did it with<br>um Brian Hyland and I found my topic<br>When I Was preparing for a scholarship<br>application and I was doing some reading<br>I was like oh Parkinson's disease yeah<br>that's what I might want to do and then<br>I was doing a little bit more reading<br>and there's this bit of the brain called<br>the motor cortex and it's really<br>important because it's the last place<br>where messages on the brain that control<br>movement are processed before they go<br>down the spinal cord out to the muscles<br>and end up creating the movement so you<br>know in Parkinson's disease when you<br>have movement deficits you'd expect that<br>there would be changes there but there<br>wasn't that much known about it and as I<br>was going through and doing that reading<br>I got that real fire in my belly this is<br>what I wanted to do and it's really<br>stepped me forward for the rest of my<br>career<br>so as mentioned previously by Lisa I did<br>have the opportunity to head over to the<br>United States to the National Institutes<br>of Health and Bethesda which is just out<br>of Washington DC and it was a really<br>special time it was a different culture<br>and a situation where the money<br>available for research was much more<br>than what we have in New Zealand very<br>generally so I got the privilege of<br>being instructed well what are you<br>interested in doing as long as you're<br>doing something in Parkinson's disease<br>and in these area movement areas of the<br>brain then that will be fine so what I<br>ended up doing was recording from a<br>number of these different brain<br>structures to understand how activity<br>changed in Parkinson's disease but more<br>importantly I wanted to understand how<br>so before I head in and dive into some<br>some of the research that I've done I<br>want to catch everyone up about<br>Parkinson's disease<br>so Parkinson's is an age-related<br>neurodegenerative disorder where<br>dopamine cells that are deep in the<br>brain so if you think about your eye<br>level right in the middle there those<br>cells die off and as a consequence of<br>that people end up with altered<br>movements<br>there are also Louis bodies that form so<br>Louis bodies are created when a protein<br>called Alpha synuclein accumulate in<br>cells and when that happens the cell<br>function alters and then cells can die<br>off so they do accumulate in dopamine<br>cells but they accumulate in many many<br>other types of cells in the brain and<br>and what happens is when these dopamine<br>cells die off it affects the passage of<br>information through this motor pathway<br>and the the information is going much<br>slower than it really should and that's<br>what underlies the movement deficits<br>so to show you what some of them are<br>with Parkinson's disease what those<br>symptoms are like their movements are<br>much slower so I'm going to show you a<br>video where This Woman's movements on<br>both sides are are affected but the left<br>side is more affected but also have a<br>look at her face she has a very<br>mass-like expression and even blinking<br>and smiling are very very slow as well<br>and you'll also see the the altered<br>yeah<br>foreign<br>with those altered movements life<br>becomes more difficult it's harder to<br>complete everyday tasks so for people<br>living with Parkinson's disease often<br>one of the first things that's<br>recommended to them is that they stay<br>active for as long as possible<br>the next treatment option is that they<br>are offered a drug often it's lever dopa<br>and it is a wonder drug for about eight<br>years and then about 80 percent of<br>people with Parkinson's disease end up<br>with a a side effect called dyskinesias<br>in which there are far too many<br>movements and they can no longer control<br>them<br>so I'm about to show you a video of what<br>dyskinesias look like and during this<br>what you'll see is the dyskinesias<br>initially and then there's another<br>treatment called deep brain stimulation<br>so you'll see the woman clear she then<br>has a hat on and she'll you'll see the<br>effect of her deep brain stimulator<br>when I was diagnosed with Parkinson's in<br>the year 2000s and<br>the dyskinesia<br>oh<br>it's much more recent than that it's<br>been particularly rare the last four or<br>five months<br>one thing that's pretty obvious to me is<br>this coffee cup I was able to drink out<br>of that without spilling it down my<br>front for the first time in a long time<br>and how many days since the up now<br>what's happening with you disconnected<br>now oh it's gone<br>it's just not here anymore it's just<br>amazing it's a miracle-like<br>so it's a miracle it's pretty powerful<br>words<br>but like all treatments deep brain<br>stimulation does have side effects such<br>as depression altered speech and<br>impulsivity<br>so in essence the treatments are helpful<br>but they do need to be improved<br>so I'm going to pick up my research<br>story and dive in a bit deeper from this<br>point and I chose this point because it<br>is the first grant that I applied for as<br>a principal investigator or a lead<br>scientist and I actually got it from the<br>neurological foundation and it ended up<br>being a really important Mark in my<br>career in order to get my faculty job an<br>anatomy so I had this before I applied<br>for my job<br>because I had this I was able to bring a<br>postdoctoral fellow in because I was no<br>longer going to be able to do the<br>adventure so my lab suddenly flourished<br>and I started charging ahead<br>so in this project what I wanted to do<br>was record from cells in the<br>midothalamus so we know that areas of<br>the brain before and after in this<br>pathway affected but we didn't know what<br>happened here and I just wondered if<br>perhaps this might be a really critical<br>site that might be able to offer<br>treatments in the future and they really<br>hadn't explored that<br>so what we do is we use a wrap model of<br>Parkinson's disease and we train our<br>rats to execute a reaching task now we<br>use reaching because the reaching in<br>humans and rats actually activates the<br>same muscles in the same order so it's a<br>really good skilled task for them to do<br>and rants are really dexterous with<br>their pores as well<br>in addition when erratus parkinsonian<br>the changes that occur are very similar<br>to humans too<br>so a little bit of data so what we're<br>doing here is recording from single<br>cells in the brain and we've recorded<br>from on the y-axis on the left hand side<br>just over 80 cells<br>and we're looking at the changes in<br>neural activity<br>over about a one second period and Time<br>Zero is when the rat's pore is just<br>obtaining the food<br>the green color in this graph indicates<br>when we have a resting level of activity<br>the red and yellow in the middle at Time<br>Zero is when there's a significant<br>increase in activity so the wiring rate<br>increases just as the rat is grabbing<br>the food<br>but before that some cells reduce their<br>firing rate and that's really important<br>because in order to execute a movement<br>you have to stop unwanted movement so<br>that's what we think that signal is and<br>then after you've done the movement you<br>need to stop it because if you keep<br>going you won't be doing what you really<br>want to do so after Time Zero you can<br>see there's another great big area of<br>blue which is a decrease in firing rate<br>as well<br>so that's from a control rate<br>in a parkinsonian rat what we found is<br>that increase in activity at Time Zero<br>remained we were surprised by that but<br>interestingly it's the decrease in<br>firing rate before and afterwards that<br>disappeared and these are the messages<br>that are of course going to stop<br>movements The Unwanted movements will<br>stop them at the end and they're<br>impaired and that means the timing of<br>muscle contractions are also impaired<br>so from here I started to ask a lot of<br>questions and when I was a kid my<br>grandfather I think I traumatized him<br>because I asked him so many questions<br>all the time and I um I remember him<br>always talking about that<br>so the questions that came up from this<br>project were is the motor Thalamus could<br>it be a site for brain stimulation can<br>brain stimulation be more selective can<br>we reduce those side effects and are<br>there better patterns of stimulation to<br>recover movements<br>so deep brain stimulation top left we<br>put an electrode into the brain it's<br>fixed and there there's then a wire<br>that's fed underneath the skin to a<br>pacemaker that sits on the chest and<br>that pacemaker is very similar to the<br>pacemaker that people have for their<br>heart<br>at the tip of the electrode on the<br>bottom left hand side there are two<br>points of contact and current spreads<br>between them and all the cells that are<br>around where that current is their cell<br>their activity will change<br>the problem with the side effects is<br>that sometimes cells are sitting in an<br>area outside that have a different<br>function but these long processes of<br>these cells pass and come into the<br>current and that's how we think some of<br>the side effects occur<br>so I've been working to bring a new<br>technique called optogenetic stimulation<br>to altero in New Zealand and I wanted to<br>use this to try and reduce the side<br>effects<br>so what we do here are in fact what a<br>colleague Steph Hughes does we have a<br>viral Vector here and we've all seen<br>viruses and Spike proteins over the last<br>couple of years with covert so what<br>happens is we take the viruses genetic<br>code out and we insert inside the code<br>for a for a protein that's going to<br>enable us to stimulate the brain with<br>light<br>so on the right hand side that big blue<br>structure is a protein that's now<br>sitting in the cell membrane of our<br>target cells and it sits closed but<br>every time we do a flash of blue light<br>that protein opens and then that cell is<br>active and I can control the activity of<br>the cells by putting through any type of<br>so what we did we stimulated with many<br>different types of pattern and the first<br>one at the top there is 130 stimuli per<br>second now that's what they use for<br>electrical deep brain stimulation that<br>is not how the brain works but it does<br>an effective treatment and our brain<br>codes information by having bursts of<br>activity so we wanted to put through<br>quite different patterns so a boost<br>pattern three stimuli close together and<br>a wee bit of pause and it continues on<br>and on the next pattern down is actually<br>real neural activity that we'd<br>previously recorded from the motor<br>Thalamus of a control rat executing a<br>reach and we took that and used that as<br>the timing to then stimulate the brain<br>of our parkinsonian rat and we wondered<br>whether we could recover movement with<br>that<br>so what we have here is a parkinsonian<br>rat and he's meant to be reaching and<br>I'm going to turn the video on a second<br>you will see that he doesn't really do<br>anything he doesn't move away his head<br>Bops up and down his ears do move but<br>his orientated because they'll be where<br>the arrow is a little food pallet there<br>a treat and he wants to reach for it but<br>he's parkinsonian so he doesn't<br>and so parkinsonian rants don't really<br>do anything too interesting but<br>when we applied blue light stimulation<br>in these burst patterns for almost 20<br>minutes so this is the same rat on the<br>same experiment what you can see is that<br>rat is able to reach into that feeding<br>tube and grab the food and eat it and<br>what we're seeing is that there's a<br>significant Improvement in function<br>so at this point<br>um in order to do these experiments uh<br>if you think about someone with dialysis<br>they go into the hospital they get<br>connected up to a machine and then they<br>have to sit there for a few hours and<br>then they walk away they get<br>disconnected and they walk away so our<br>rats are very similar in that regard<br>they come in we connect them up to the<br>blue light stimulator and then we<br>disconnect them to to put them back into<br>their home environment<br>but if this is either going to be a<br>treatment we needed to have a device<br>that could be implanted and we turn it<br>on and it stays on for months and months<br>at a go<br>so I was fortunate enough to meet up<br>with some bio Engineers from Auckland<br>University and they had already started<br>to develop a blue light stimulating<br>device so we came along we did the beta<br>testing and essentially we took it we<br>were planting it we were giving them<br>feedback around oh we need these kind of<br>features for this to be a useful tool<br>for us and oh can you change it so that<br>when we implant it we can fix it in<br>there in better ways<br>so what we did we would turn our<br>stimulator on and we'll turn it on in<br>this case with the data on the right<br>hand side for 10 weeks<br>we have two groups of rats here the blue<br>line is a group of rats that they did<br>have a viral Vector but it didn't have<br>that light activated protein and this is<br>our control in this experiment and what<br>is important about that is that that<br>light actually will heat up the brain a<br>little bit and that heat could have<br>changed function but what you see is<br>that the number of reaches that were<br>happening there there was no change<br>but in our rats that did have this<br>active protein there was a significant<br>increase in performance here for at<br>least the first six uh six weeks and<br>then for some reason that we still don't<br>necessarily understand performance<br>dropped off so we're trying to tease<br>that out and understand what was<br>happening<br>so from here this device has been<br>commercialized so it's now with um 80<br>instruments which is an international<br>company that started here in Dunedin<br>over 30 years ago so anyone can come and<br>buy it now but I was actually standing<br>or sitting and thinking about this for<br>the last few years that we're doing this<br>project and I started thinking about<br>well actually only about 10 people per<br>year out of the over 10 000 people with<br>Parkinson's disease actually get offered<br>deep brain stimulation as a treatment<br>and the reason they're really really<br>selective on who they offer it to<br>because as we age our health becomes<br>much more complex and as that happens<br>then we don't become a candidate for<br>such an invasive technique<br>and so if I stop and think about my own<br>whanau and that the fact that Maori<br>generally have poorer health and we<br>don't live as long then actually it's<br>not going to be a treatment that many<br>people that I know might be getting and<br>so I actually stood back and started<br>thinking about well what should I be<br>doing I can't keep going on with this in<br>equity I left that project on the whole<br>and I started to think about what I<br>might be doing in the future<br>so a couple of other projects that I've<br>been working on so I had the opportunity<br>of working with these wonderful and one<br>of them as I said there on the left hand<br>side and we were looking at Maori<br>perspectives to do with neurological<br>disorders and stroke<br>and so the whanau that of people that<br>had undergone a neurological event were<br>interviewed and they'd asked what was<br>important and what sort of<br>experiences they had<br>and they talked about karakia being<br>important for safety and guidance but<br>also for the transition States between<br>uh the brain the body being tapu to<br>making it not in order for surgery and<br>then transitioning it back<br>the importance of whakapafa knowing of<br>um history United whanau and then<br>reciting that to remain connected and<br>feeling of belonging and also the<br>importance of whanau support that that<br>person who's had that neurological event<br>needs to get well so the whole whanau as<br>well<br>so<br>I wasn't surprised but new technologies<br>can be helpful but they can actually<br>exacerbate iniquities and what we're<br>looking for is accessible treatments<br>that are fit for purpose and we want<br>services that better meet Maori needs<br>and what was coming out in the<br>interviews with a holistic approaches<br>that they were looking for<br>and so I started to think more and more<br>about holistic approaches and I was<br>fortunate that led KIPP joined the lab<br>and she has a background in inflammation<br>and viruses and we started thinking<br>about well what is the role of<br>inflammation in Parkinson's disease and<br>how might we harness that in order to<br>maybe treat Parkinson's differently<br>so on the left hand side we've got<br>positive aging on the left hand side and<br>the Aging experience perhaps with<br>someone with a neurodegenerative disease<br>or a psychiatric disease and generally<br>with neurodegenerative diseases there is<br>the body is in an increased inflammatory<br>State and things like this generally<br>poor sleep<br>the if you can't poor sleep and high fat<br>diets can contribute to someone going<br>into an inflammatory state<br>but there are also opportunities to<br>harness this knowledge so that we reduce<br>the inflammatory state so exercising<br>having a good diet and sleeping well and<br>in particular a ketogenic diet reduces<br>the inflammatory state of the brain<br>and there was a study that came out of<br>waikato where they were getting people<br>living with Parkinson's disease to be on<br>a ketogenic for eight diet for eight<br>weeks and what they found was there was<br>a significant Improvement in their<br>symptoms<br>so we a group of colleagues from here<br>from otago again several of them are in<br>the audience we started talking about<br>well what's happening in the brain what<br>are the changes in the chemicals and<br>instead of having someone do the diet<br>which diets we all know are really tough<br>to stay with all the time but could we<br>take some of that knowledge about those<br>chemical changes and shortchange the<br>process and actually look at new<br>treatments<br>now this is really important because<br>what we've been learning more recently<br>is that the gut and the brain are<br>intimately linked<br>so um in neurological disorders often<br>the gut is really leaky and what that<br>happens is that things are getting into<br>our bloodstream and increasing the<br>immune system response and the<br>inflammatory response and that then<br>means that the brain tends to be very<br>leaky as well and so you have neural<br>inflammation and that's when the<br>dopamine cells are more likely to die so<br>we wanted to look at can we use dietary<br>intervention to reduce symptoms<br>so on the right hand side you can see a<br>set of experience this is actually quite<br>hot off the press late last week what we<br>have at the top is our control animals<br>performing a movement task and our<br>parkinsonian animals we've actually<br>created a new model where not only do<br>the dopamine cells die off but we set up<br>an inflammatory state in the gut to<br>mimic what actually happens in<br>Parkinson's disease<br>but the really interesting thing here is<br>if if we administer a dietary component<br>to them then we could significantly<br>improve the symptoms not a back to our<br>control state but we could definitely<br>make things better so what we want to do<br>now is look at the tissues and see where<br>the dope means like fewer dopamine cells<br>have died off and start to harness this<br>knowledge<br>so at this point I want to thank so many<br>people from my lab for sharing this<br>journey and all the collaborators that<br>have have done projects with me I've<br>only talked about a tiny number of them<br>but there are many many people to thank<br>so I want to change topic a little bit<br>because science is changing how it might<br>be done so that questions are being more<br>driven by communities so that there are<br>real world solutions for what is needed<br>at the ground<br>and National Science challenges started<br>in 2014 and this was an opportunity to<br>do science differently for it to be<br>mission-led what are the big questions<br>that are there that we can address<br>and have impact by changing people's<br>lives by changing Service delivery and<br>so in early 2018 I thought I was going<br>along for a coffee with a Moana Theodore<br>what it turned out as I was having a<br>much deeper conversation about<br>potentially might I be interested in<br>joining eating well and I kind of sat<br>big with my brain going too busy you've<br>got too much on what are you doing but I<br>did have a really good conversation with<br>her and I asked if there was any<br>document that I could read about what<br>they envisaged doing for the next few<br>years<br>so at this time aging well was just<br>putting together their future strategy<br>we're about to go to the ministry in<br>order to get another five years of<br>funding and they gave me a chunk of that<br>document in the middle<br>and I read it and I went oh my goodness<br>I need to get rid of some stuff and I<br>need to be doing this and it was such an<br>important decision in my life<br>so<br>um<br>back in 2016 the reason I said I needed<br>to join this kaupapa back in 2016 dye<br>McCarthy who was the chair at the time<br>and Dave Baxter who was the director had<br>made important strategic decisions<br>they saw a vision of how to do science<br>differently so what they did is they<br>changed the governance group so that<br>half of the members were Maori they<br>established a deputy chair position<br>which will took that position and he's<br>going to be speaking in a moment<br>and they established a deputy director<br>Maori position which Moana initially had<br>and then I stepped into and they also<br>brought korohata into the whanau so he's<br>the komata for aging well and he<br>oversees everything we do and make sure<br>we do it properly<br>so from that future strategy document<br>what I realized was instead of working<br>to the vision martoranga policy how to<br>do things to better meet Marty needs<br>instead of doing it at a compliance<br>level we were charging ahead and we were<br>going to be moving towards 32<br>partnership<br>there were Maori values and principles<br>absolutely embedded in that document and<br>the way they spoke about their role of<br>whanau the role of intergenerational I<br>was hooked but the big thing was that we<br>were going to have Equitable outcomes by<br>having equal funding so at that point we<br>envisaged that 40 of our funding would<br>go to maori-led projects<br>so what happened<br>there was a lot of really strategic good<br>decisions by Diane Dave and a lot of<br>mentoring and in 2020 I came through and<br>it was put into the role of the director<br>and four months later will became the<br>so<br>um now what we have is a situation where<br>we are Maori LED<br>working in threaty Partnership<br>but working in a western framework so<br>that's incredibly unique<br>so what we've achieved<br>for this current five year term half of<br>our funding is going to Mighty LED<br>projects and that means we have growth<br>in Maori researchers and leaders<br>throughout all of our organization we<br>privileged matauranga alongside Western<br>science and we do that by instead of<br>thinking oh the only place to gather<br>knowledge or information is from Journal<br>articles you know around the world for<br>Marty it's going to be perhaps in things<br>like waiter karakia and fakaido or<br>carvings and so the information is<br>with the community that they're working<br>with and then the outputs yes there'll<br>be Publications and MLB reports but<br>there may be things like a hacker or a<br>carving as well<br>what we also do is Empower communities<br>to ask the questions that they want to<br>ask and then we make sure we ask them to<br>work with researchers that they Trust<br>over the last five years we've been<br>consistently aligning our strategies our<br>leadership styles our Communications and<br>our images and last year a massive piece<br>of work that we did so Rebecca our comms<br>advisor korahata and I met with rdk<br>creative and we started talking about<br>the legacy of our website and how we had<br>four main areas of research and as we're<br>doing that we're talking a little bit<br>about aging well and what we do and how<br>we do it so we got for tuhu and core<br>Fifi panels in order to represent our<br>research but in addition tane recognized<br>that there was something a little bit<br>different about us and so he created a<br>fifth one which is called tahitanga all<br>the togetherness and that's the cool<br>firefi that's along the bottom as well<br>so our website looks very different now<br>and the other thing we've done at aging<br>well is we support Collective Maori<br>leadership so just as I was joining the<br>voicamani was established I became a<br>member of that we've put out really<br>important documents about how science<br>should be done in partnership with Maori<br>um and it's been an absolute pleasure to<br>be involved with them so to my aging<br>well whanau thank you so much I've loved<br>being part of that this organization and<br>to my Heroica manai colleagues they are<br>amazing in the manner that they hold<br>when we sit at the table I sit and all<br>of all of them<br>I have one little extra piece of<br>information to share with you so I'm<br>actually one of five children but in<br>order to show you this I have to show<br>two separate photos and that's because<br>my sister Jane passed away when she was<br>only two years old<br>now anyone who's experienced that knows<br>that that rips a hole in people's hearts<br>on the whanau<br>and during those early years my mum and<br>dad patiently explained what had<br>happened when we're asking questions<br>like where where is Jane why can't we<br>play with her<br>and I'm placing on the messages that<br>they shared was how important research<br>is<br>so Jane had a continental heart defect<br>she had underwent two highly<br>experimental profound hypothermic open<br>heart surgeries during her short life at<br>Green Lane Hospital<br>and so our discussions would talk about<br>that and we'd also talk about well winds<br>enough when is it time for the person to<br>rest<br>my parents were amazing<br>that you're absolutely amazing you and<br>Mum as you stepped you were having to<br>deal with your own grief and then we<br>were you were having to step Us Michael<br>Jonathan and I through that as well<br>and of course an experience like that<br>influences who you are and what you do<br>so for me it means that what do you want<br>to do with your life life isn't a<br>rehearsal get on with it and start<br>making a difference<br>but also something that I learned from<br>my mum was that someone experiences she<br>had when Jane was with us is how<br>important the compassion and kindness<br>from others were when you're dealing<br>with four children one of whom is very<br>very ill<br>um and in order to navigate those simple<br>tasks such as just going to the<br>supermarket<br>so<br>um<br>to my siblings Michael Jonathan Amy and<br>Jane we are also very different and and<br>that means we bring really different<br>skills to our whanau and while I live<br>down here you still live up until Bay<br>mostly or very close to it and you get<br>to see each other all the time and what<br>I love about that is that Joseph<br>Williams Shelby and Maddie get to spend<br>that really close relationship like we<br>had with our cousins when we we were<br>kids<br>now mum passed away eight years ago and<br>we all really really miss her<br>but I always sent her with us keeping an<br>eye making sure we do things right<br>but I also see when I see here I see her<br>with a little bit of a twinkle in the<br>eye just encouraging the Mortal to be a<br>little bit mischievous but not too<br>naughty you can't be naughty so um yeah<br>I always feel her with us when we're<br>together<br>so a few more people to thank to my<br>family around them or two and um across<br>the world as well they've shared this<br>journey from those early early days to<br>my God children it's been a pleasure to<br>share your journey as you've been<br>growing up and to some very close<br>friends I really appreciate the fact<br>that these friends some of them get me<br>to share books with me so that I guess<br>skate for the science and start to think<br>about other things and others of you<br>make me use that tiny little inkling on<br>my brain that is creative when we have<br>potluck dinners and I have to come up<br>with Kai that fits a theme like sunshine<br>so thank you it's wonderful to share the<br>journey and um with all of you<br>so to Anatomy<br>it was a pleasure to join anatomy in<br>2010 and I was thinking about when I<br>interviewed I was looking at the<br>department and I realized even then that<br>half the faculty in the department were<br>woman and that was incredibly unusual so<br>I looked up this morning and although<br>half a woman only a third were an at<br>professorial level so I looked up this<br>morning and not only do we still have<br>half of our woman and our faculty but we<br>have more women than men as professors<br>so it's been a pleasure to actually join<br>the department and step through my<br>career with you to brain research New<br>Zealand I really loved the opportunity<br>to be funded by you but more importantly<br>the leadership opportunities that you<br>gave me over the last eight years and to<br>my topotama Maori colleagues we have the<br>best training and we have the best court<br>at all and I really appreciate the<br>support that we give each other<br>we're right at the end so<br>um thank you for hanging in there on<br>hey<br>now<br>foreign<br>hey baby<br>why do I editing<br>me<br>50 50<br>foreign<br>foreign<br>I'm a professor in the department of<br>anatomy where I'm also the head and it's<br>my great pleasure to be able to be one<br>of the people who does a little closer<br>for Louise so I was asked to thank<br>Louise as well as to comment on her<br>lecture<br>um but where to begin<br>um I guess the first thing that I wanted<br>to do really was just to thank you for<br>the lecture of course<br>um and for taking us on a journey<br>through your life<br>um before science<br>um during science and through your<br>scientific career and<br>um although I wasn't the head of the<br>department when you went through of<br>course Louise and I started off in<br>physiology in the very very early 2000s<br>when I was a research fellow and she was<br>a PhD student so I've kind of also been<br>along for the journey as well watching<br>her grow as a scientist but also really<br>watching her leadership<br>journey and I think one of the things<br>that's been really really impressive<br>about it is not just what a fantastic<br>scientist Louise has developed into but<br>also the leadership journey and the<br>leadership Journey that has woven<br>together<br>her whakapapa and how that has has<br>driven the kinds of things that she's<br>been involved with as a leader<br>um and and has actually helped to shape<br>within New Zealand many of the the<br>approaches that we now are starting to<br>um to undertake both at government level<br>and also in um in our everyday<br>departmental University lives and that<br>really is the weaving together of<br>um her pakeha as well as her tangata<br>fenua ancestry<br>and bringing that together in all<br>aspects of her work so that there's<br>co-leadership co-creation of ideas and<br>ways of doing things<br>and I think you could really see that in<br>the way her research transitioned from<br>very Western basic science to<br>recognizing the need for reducing<br>inequities in the way science and and<br>its applications are delivered and to do<br>that with um not just the basic science<br>lens but also the Maori lens in order to<br>bring about<br>not just research in Parkinson's disease<br>but research in movement disorders more<br>broadly which are responsive and<br>appropriate to all communities<br>and um you know giving rise to a much<br>more accessibility in the solutions that<br>are found and I guess I wanted to just<br>finally End by sort of thanking Louise<br>for the role that she has played in a<br>very small way but in the same general<br>way<br>um within the department many of you<br>will be aware that Louise is the Deputy<br>h.o.d Maori in our department so she's<br>bringing what she described to you that<br>she was able to do in her work<br>particularly through the Aging well<br>National Science Challenge and bring<br>that tetariti-led partnership and<br>Leadership and co-creation to the<br>National Science Challenge and is<br>helping instructing supporting me so<br>that in our department we can<br>collectively grow and also beite territ<br>within the University<br>and so<br>um you know just I guess in finishing up<br>what I wanted to say is that it's just<br>the drawing the weaving together of all<br>these aspects of Louise that have made<br>her not just a stellar scientist a<br>stellar Maori scientist but a stellar<br>human being who contributes in multiple<br>ways in our science system and in<br>helping our communities in aotearo New<br>Zealand and I guess I just wanted to end<br>by asking you then all to thank to join<br>me in thanking Louise for the wonderful<br>foreign<br>of this place<br>um I'm I'm from taranaki and I mentioned<br>my ancestors were imprisoned here as the<br>pakakohe prisoners in the parihaka<br>prisoners who laid some of the<br>foundation Stones literally of this<br>institution<br>um<br>but I acknowledge<br>Louise<br>acknowledge what Louise is bringing to<br>this University<br>and Amy I know you're coming up here<br>very shortly I'm just the real Johnny<br>come lately in this one's Journey<br>die<br>what a vision<br>Dave<br>so cool working alongside Louise<br>sometimes I forget that she's actually<br>an expert in some of this stuff and you<br>know orienteering I know that I don't<br>need Google Maps<br>anymore<br>because I get lost all the time<br>and I've learned so much about you<br>personally having worked closely with<br>foreign<br>so the name that I understand is<br>currently being debated<br>here is the embodiment of that of the<br>reciprocity<br>of drawing on knowledge systems<br>Robin Hood that might make this the<br>Sheriff of Nottingham<br>this one doesn't Rob from the rich<br>she works at system<br>for social justice inequity<br>and I'm sure and I know who Manuel and I<br>know here Tarawa and certainly her Maori<br>colleagues in relations are so so proud<br>of her Amy where are you it's time for<br>you to come and speak<br>uh<br>okay this is a lot more nerve-wracking<br>um hello everyone my name is Amy I'm<br>Louise's sister we are like really happy<br>and privileged to be here today to<br>celebrate Louise and her amazing<br>achievement<br>Louise has been a hard worker determined<br>and strong like all her life since she<br>was born<br>dad said Louise was always a leader even<br>when we were children she was always<br>very responsible for the rest of us<br>children and Mum would always say to me<br>that Louise could achieve anything she<br>put in mind to in life<br>Louise was an exceptional student at<br>school by the time I went to school the<br>teachers were never calling me Michael's<br>little sister or Jonathan's little<br>sister it was always very fondly<br>Louise's little sister so it's a bit of<br>a hard act to follow<br>in fact in one of the lockdowns I found<br>Louise's old school reports and really<br>blew me away how amazing she actually<br>was I think one teacher actually said<br>she was the most wonderful student they<br>had ever had<br>it's like wow<br>which is pretty impressive<br>but it wasn't just in school that Louise<br>was a high achiever it was actually in<br>music and sports and orienteering was<br>our favorite thing it brings back all<br>the memories<br>of our weekends when we were kids and<br>doing the orienteering together and<br>supporting Louise when she was in<br>competitions and dad mentioned to me the<br>other day he's always been so very proud<br>of her the way she represented clubs and<br>national teams and he loved supporting<br>her and seeing her through all of those<br>years when she was competing<br>um Louise has always been a very<br>supportive sister she's an amazing role<br>model for her nieces and nephews and as<br>an extended family with our cousin Mark<br>who came down from whangarei today as a<br>surprise as well our whole family we are<br>very very proud of you today but we're<br>proud of you every day as well and<br>I sleep for weeks I've been thinking<br>don't call it Wheezy but<br>sorry<br>she she's always my ways ASA<br>you dedicate your learnings your<br>experience your culture and your<br>knowledge into helping others and you<br>are always looking for ways to advocate<br>for others and we think you're really<br>amazing for that and it would be<br>something that would have made Mum so so<br>proud and we are all very very proud of<br>I'm the acting Deputy Pro Vice<br>Chancellor for Health Sciences and also<br>a former head of the Department of<br>anatomy so it's it's um it's all about<br>Anatomy tonight but it's also all about<br>far now and and I just want to reflect<br>I've actually got the easiest job I'm<br>actually all I meant to do is say hey<br>please come over to the staff Club we've<br>got Kai and drinks but I want to take<br>the opportunity uh just to say what a<br>wonderful joyous IPL this has been<br>um because it's about far now it's about<br>your family and also your academic<br>family celebrating your success Louise<br>and uh it's extraordinary<br>um so I've walked that Journey with you<br>a little<br>um and I just want to say thank you on<br>behalf of the University of otago and<br>the division of Health Sciences for<br>your wonderful science and your<br>wonderful leadership<br>um I want to thank you on behalf of<br>anatomy for what you have given and give<br>to our department<br>and I want to thank you on behalf of our<br>New Zealand for the leadership that you<br>show are weaving to Al Maori with our<br>science system here<br>we are on all on a journey and we are<br>growing and better for knowing and<br>working with you so Cura and thank you<br>so now<br>um just to finish over at the staff club<br>we have Kai and we would be delighted if<br>you could come and just join with us and<br>continue the corridoro and uh and and<br>you know congratulate Louise in person<br>for what is a marvelous achievement and<br>a wonderful IPL<br>and just going for a moment just Off<br>Script um just it's been my huge<br>privilege to lead this and I will<br>conclude because as well as well as<br>a place of first we are also<br>a place
