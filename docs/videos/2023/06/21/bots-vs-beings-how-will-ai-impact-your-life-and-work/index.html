accurate.</p><p>foreign<br>talk this evening my name is bryony<br>James it's my great pleasure to<br>facilitate our conversation and<br>contribute very little more than acting<br>as a sheepdog to our fine panelists<br>talks<br>are an intermittent series of public<br>lectures and discussions that we lay on<br>when an issue gets so topical we feel it<br>would be interesting to have a<br>discussion about it<br>and a university when you get right down<br>to it should be exactly that place where<br>our thoughts and ideas are taken out and<br>brushed off for a good earring<br>to that end this evening we have four<br>amazing panelists who will each bring<br>their own expertise and their own<br>viewpoints towards the topic of<br>artificial intelligence<br>but you the audience are a part of the<br>discussion and this is how you can get<br>involved so allow me to oh there we go<br>so we're going to ex invite audience<br>questions after each of our panelists<br>has spoken briefly<br>um to kick off<br>you can send your questions through this<br>app called slido so all you need to do<br>is use your phone scan that code which<br>we're all used to doing thanks to the<br>pandemic scan that code and you'll be<br>sent off to slido and you'll be able to<br>put your questions in don't worry if you<br>don't catch it now it will pop up<br>throughout the talk and again at the end<br>and you'll be able to jump on and send<br>your questions through<br>it's my<br>challenge today I'm assuming there's<br>going to be quite a few questions<br>because this is a full house which is<br>wonderful to see it's my challenge to to<br>feed those questions to the panelists<br>now these are academics so it's entirely<br>likely that they'll just get into a<br>fight on their own and we won't have<br>anything to do<br>um but I'll I'll see if I can I'll see<br>if I can Wrangle that as well<br>but you're not here to hear from me you<br>are here to hear from them so without<br>further Ado I will pass over to our<br>first Speaker our first speaker is<br>Professor Mike Duke who is the Dr John<br>Gallagher chair in engineering and our<br>dean of engineering here at waikato and<br>I'll just hand over to him thank you<br>brony<br>uh tunakoto greetings everyone<br>um so my area of research is in<br>agricultural robotics so when we're<br>talking about artificial intelligence in<br>the being's Bots versus beings I'm going<br>to talk about the Bots bit<br>and everyone gets a bit worried about it<br>going artificial intelligence I think<br>that's why there's a lot of people here<br>what's going to happen to us what impact<br>is this new technology going to have on<br>our jobs what you know what what what<br>dangers are we going to face in the<br>future for our security<br>so what I'd like to do is just to give<br>us a little bit of a wake-up call that<br>if you went back in time you went to the<br>old factories in the 1930s they were<br>full of people doing mundane boring jobs<br>that none of us would want to do today<br>that's history of course technology has<br>moved on and we no longer worry about<br>that we have robots that are sorry are<br>going to go back a bit<br>technology failure<br>and we'll just let that run<br>uh hopefully that'll work<br>so if we look at so we looked at that<br>technology that's all<br>um history we're now moving on to car<br>technology which that's building cars<br>we've now got robots that are doing it<br>and the robots will do all the jobs of<br>the humans with uh you know there's no<br>humans in that picture at all so where<br>we had thousands now there's none and<br>it's all being done by robots if you<br>look at things like fruit grading which<br>of the classic New Zealand type thing<br>you had to do if you went back in time<br>it was done by people human brains are<br>actually sitting there determining<br>whether or not you should accept or pass<br>or fail a bit of fruit if you went to a<br>New Zealand pack house where you're<br>looking at Apples you're not going to<br>see rows and rows of people looking at<br>Apples deciding whether they're good or<br>bad what you're going to see is machines<br>like this the blue box that you see has<br>got all the conveyor of apples coming<br>through there are you know dozens of<br>pictures taken of each apple it's opened<br>up<br>artificial intelligence combined with<br>algorithms are determining whether or<br>not that apple is good or bad as the<br>Apple goes down the line it is then<br>ticked off into a good apple or right<br>down to it if it's a bad one down to the<br>juicer end that's all being done using a<br>form of narrow artificial intelligence<br>so when you're around in the Hawke's Bay<br>or you're looking at different places<br>where you've got pack houses you're<br>seeing behind those walls this type of<br>technology and it is a narrow form of<br>artificial intelligence that's doing the<br>job that humans used to do that's the<br>first thing yes that's meant a lot of<br>jobs went in that area but they weren't<br>that people wanted to do moving on what<br>if we take all that technology that<br>clever cameras and the computer visions<br>and the artificial intelligence is it<br>possible that we can take these types of<br>robots and put them out into the fields<br>where we actually see them doing things<br>in Orchards and Vineyards and uh this<br>project called the marotech project the<br>one that I'm involved with with our<br>partners does exactly that so we're<br>trying to say can we take all of that<br>technology and combine it to have a<br>machine that when it goes out into say a<br>Vineyard will go to a place and perform<br>a task that a humor would do including<br>the thought processes behind what you're<br>actually doing to it and one of the<br>classic ones is Vine pruning where you<br>have to make a couple of cuts well about<br>five cuts if you get them right you get<br>a really good Vine the next year with<br>lots of good growth if you don't you get<br>it wrong you can Muck it up for a few<br>years so with that I was going to talk<br>through how we can do that with a robot<br>but I had a chat with Archie which is<br>one of the robots we've been working on<br>and um there's Archie and I she said<br>that they'll talk through how they would<br>each year every Vine has five or six<br>critical cuts that affect how great<br>screw it is very important for the<br>vineyard owners to get this right<br>instead of semi-skilled human pruners<br>they want us robots to do it so they get<br>consistently high quality Vines for Less<br>cost this is how I do it first I drive<br>myself to the row of finds to be proven<br>my rooted schedule have been<br>pre-programmed by humans to navigate I<br>use GPS combined with laser Imaging<br>detection and ranging the special marker<br>tells me when I have reached the vine to<br>be pruned I scan the Vine with my<br>computer vision and create a digital<br>model of the file I then use artificial<br>intelligence AI to identify the key<br>features of the vine and their locations<br>humans who were experts in Vine proving<br>I have told my progress the rules for<br>best Brewing the program has combined<br>the AI derived Vine features the best<br>practice rules the output shows me where<br>to prune on the virtual free Divine I<br>then map it to the actual Vine I then go<br>to the physical location and make the<br>cuts just like the experts want every<br>time unlike humans that use their hands<br>to operate primitive tools like<br>signatures I have my own specially<br>designed pruners which is of course much<br>better Micron Vines are as good as the<br>best expert and much better than<br>semi-skilled humans also I will work all<br>day and all night and never complain<br>about my day and conditions sorry humans<br>your days are numbered well<br>well Archie I didn't expect you know<br>obviously Archie started off being quite<br>a nice robot and at the end was like I<br>don't really care about you humans I'm<br>better than you<br>um and that's the sort of thing you can<br>get really worried about well to be<br>honest with you Archie is a robot that<br>doesn't need the what we call narrow<br>artificial intelligence to function<br>properly but unlike the video that I<br>made<br>Archie is not conscious it doesn't have<br>he's not thinking like that at all and<br>it certainly isn't sentient but Archie<br>like robots like Archie will replace<br>jobs in New Zealand just like we saw<br>from the Apple packing or from the from<br>the factories but they'll be different<br>jobs so it is going to have an impact<br>and I'll finish off like I do my<br>lectures discuss<br>well technical glitch at the beginning<br>thank you very much Mike our next<br>speaker is Dr Amanda Williamson now<br>Amanda works for Deloitte as a manager<br>in Ai and data consultancy but she also<br>moonlights here at the University as a<br>senior lecturer in the business school<br>her research is has always been related<br>to artificial intelligence so please<br>welcome Amanda thanks<br>AI is no longer a buzzword we use it<br>every day and we come in contact with it<br>when we unlock our phones with facial<br>recognition when we navigate across a<br>city<br>and even when we look at what we want to<br>watch on Netflix and we see<br>and it's also in industry<br>when we have<br>diagnoses made sometimes AI is behind<br>that and also the medications that are<br>being made are often driven by AI<br>when we apply for jobs our CVS are often<br>being screened by Ai and now when we<br>write code that can be done alongside AI<br>so it's having a huge impact on our<br>lives and I see the change that AI is<br>driving as creating three big Seas of<br>change<br>the firstly is job cats we've talked<br>about that impact that it can have the<br>second is creation of jobs and the third<br>is the collaboration with AI<br>so often when we ask people how do they<br>feel about AI people are generally more<br>optimistic than they are pessimistic on<br>average but when you ask why they are<br>pessimistic the number one reason is the<br>and current studies that are coming out<br>and are quite new do show that there is<br>a bit of reason for concern in that<br>space<br>around 19 of jobs will have over half of<br>their tasks automated through AI<br>this is particularly in copywriting and<br>PR<br>and that's a very scary sight<br>but on the positive side if we learn<br>from the history of Technology it's very<br>clear that jobs are not just lost in<br>isolation we also see a reinstatement<br>effect happen where new jobs come in its<br>place<br>and we have a whole new field of AI<br>related jobs now I work with these<br>people these are the AI Engineers right<br>and even now there are new jobs that you<br>might have not even heard of before<br>have you heard of this role a prompt<br>engineer that is a real job<br>that is advertised in New Zealand at the<br>moment<br>and with this embracing of AI there are<br>huge productivity increases<br>so there was a interesting study that<br>came out last week which taught an AI<br>assistant how to help call center<br>workers and it demonstrated that call<br>center workers who were at the lowest<br>skilled workers were able to increase<br>their productivity by 35 and at the same<br>time they were able to increase the<br>satisfaction of the customers on the<br>other end of the phone and it improved<br>their retention<br>so this is an incredible thing for us<br>all in our jobs is to actually get these<br>benefits of taking away those very<br>mundane roles<br>and when we think about New Zealand and<br>our special place in the world it's a<br>very interesting thing to ponder because<br>current estimates suggest that companies<br>overseas are using AI to augment work<br>one estimate suggests that as much as 50<br>of companies are using AI right now in<br>2023 it's a huge boom that's been driven<br>by generative AI that's what drives<br>things like chat gbt<br>so it poses a question for us what's the<br>cost of not adopting AI<br>particularly because AI has gone through<br>a huge shift<br>it's now not just for the AI Engineers<br>it's now for all of us this year we've<br>seen AI become democratized we can all<br>engage with AI just using our natural<br>language<br>and this means as well that AI is not<br>just about high stakes you know a<br>self-driving car it can also be a form<br>of creative expression<br>so I love this quote AI won't replace<br>jobs people using AI<br>will replace people not using AI I think<br>this whole new movement is a call to<br>arms for all of us<br>because AI is going nowhere it's only<br>going to increase so our job is to stick<br>with that Trend and make sure that we're<br>fluent in Ai and we can use it to<br>amplify our work as well<br>and a final note is that AI is an<br>amplifier<br>both for productivity as we've seen in<br>Creative expression but it can also be<br>Amplified for<br>less positive things as well<br>this is particularly concerning as we<br>look at things like deep fakes where<br>people can<br>emulate the voice and the face of other<br>people and this has the potential for<br>misinformation spreading which is<br>something we should all be worried about<br>as we approach an election<br>but to end on a positive note if we<br>think about the biggest issues of our<br>time that we're facing right now this is<br>pandemics this is climate change<br>AI is likely to be part of our solution<br>to those biggest problems thank you very<br>much<br>thank you Amanda<br>our next speaker is Professor Nick agar<br>now Nick is a philosopher and he wants<br>yes thank you Brian enough of the study<br>optimism so yes yes yes we're all doomed<br>but I would say that anyway tender Koto<br>and this is a fascinating chat so far so<br>I am going to introduce an element of<br>fear<br>um I want you all to be a bit scared I'm<br>a bit scared but can you not be sort of<br>deer in the headlights scared can you be<br>creatively scared because I do think<br>that when I look at chat GPT which is<br>the technology that scares me<br>it's coming to my line of work it's<br>coming to any line of work where you are<br>paid money to think hard and write about<br>it<br>if that's your job and it's lots of<br>people it's my job<br>um well chat GPT right now it's great<br>and rubbish<br>um there are respects in which GPT which<br>is basically this sort of amazing chat<br>bot that by the way<br>we created we created by using the<br>internet and putting our hopes of fears<br>on it and some clever Tech dudes said<br>thank you for saying that people thank<br>you for giving me 570 gigabytes of text<br>that I'm going to train this bot on<br>um thank you so we created it we<br>permitted it we shared which was what we<br>were supposed to do and well should I<br>say we're screwed we're not screwed but<br>we do have to think creatively about<br>what we can become because my way of<br>being employed if you find yourself<br>competing on price with a machine you're<br>in big trouble you may keep your job<br>you're not going to be well paid for it<br>so your job May remain but expect to be<br>poor<br>so why sort of when I look at sort of<br>chat GPT what it's capable of<br>I mean it it conforms I mean what I'm<br>worried about is a pattern that you see<br>in lots of digital Technologies where<br>they basically start<br>sort of as soon as a digital<br>Technologies is okay so so we saw this<br>example in chess<br>instead of the people in the 90s would<br>say well it can be bad players but it<br>can't be the best players whoa digital<br>technologies that get quite good sort of<br>okay which is where chat GPT is now<br>rubbish and respond respects but amazing<br>others can rapidly improve so check back<br>two years later and find out how<br>generative AI is that they'll be<br>predictably much better so that means we<br>need to have a response and we need to<br>have a response that basically is partly<br>interest looks at us<br>so how do humans respond how do you<br>respond when a machine comes and starts<br>doing your job starts competing on price<br>saying I can do what you do slightly<br>worse but much cheaper well look at what<br>you do and find some other way to do it<br>there's loads of aspects of our Humanity<br>that we can double down on and respond<br>so sort of when I look at what I mean<br>how chat GPT has come to my line of work<br>academic philosophy<br>it's<br>it's crap in some respects but<br>astounding in other respects<br>and I predict that it will do that so<br>here's a here's a question I mean<br>um<br>I think a lot of people what do you say<br>when a student submits work and I'm<br>going to rat on my kids they're in<br>Australia right now but they are doing<br>this and but this isn't going out to<br>Australia<br>so their teachers tell them not to use<br>chat gbt and they say thanks teacher of<br>course we wouldn't use chat gbt and then<br>they go and use chat gbt and the<br>teachers say well I've got this check at<br>this AI detector I'll use that and again<br>the kids are smarter than the grown-ups<br>they know how to get around that and<br>they do so their teachers are basically<br>reading a lot of automated bot written<br>text<br>and it's sort of that if you're going to<br>play this game or trying to sort of<br>detect Machine written text<br>um we're going to lose that because they<br>will get better so I tested it out okay<br>with some writing that I think I I<br>should know my writing<br>I asked chat GPT<br>to write on something in the voice of<br>Nicholas agar the philosopher and I<br>asked her to write on something that I<br>had never written on<br>and I thought whoa that's it's not<br>genius but it looks like stuff I would<br>say it's got all of my quirks<br>in fact it's got some good ideas and I<br>think I think that if we're telling the<br>kids if you use chat gbt I'm kind of<br>good as plagiarism well here's my<br>question to you maybe I'll leave with<br>this question<br>so if I use imagine I use one of those<br>ideas written in the voice of Nicholas<br>agar that have my Clumsy forms of<br>expression they look like the stuff I<br>would write<br>um if I plagiarize I mean this all comes<br>from text I'm I'm on the internet I've<br>written stuff that's on the editor if I<br>plagiarize chat gbt plagiarizing me is<br>that plagiarism<br>so I really want to know I actually<br>don't know the answer to that but I<br>don't think it's straightforward because<br>my it comes from me and it repackaged it<br>to me and now I want to use it so I I<br>think we need big ideas and creative<br>ideas about how we can respond but thank<br>you<br>I've scored a watch<br>yeah<br>and our last panelist uh to talk this<br>evening before we open the floor is<br>associate professor titaka Keegan our<br>computer scientist titaka has a lot to<br>say about artificial intelligence<br>particularly in the context of Toreo and<br>um<br>um<br>there's a whole lot of things that I<br>could say about artificial intelligence<br>and how we can use it and how it could<br>affect our jobs<br>but what I'm going to talk about is a<br>couple of examples and a couple of<br>thoughts that I've had<br>artificial intelligence will affect us<br>in a lot of different areas but one of<br>the areas of artificial intelligence<br>that has got a lot of press recently and<br>probably for good reason is as Nick<br>mentioned GPT<br>I gave a talk to a bunch of students<br>Maori students from Marty's School<br>throughout prohono program recently and<br>I was getting them to trade out we had<br>GTP running and I was getting them to<br>try it out and I was getting them to ask<br>some questions like my mum keeps bugging<br>me about doing the dishes what can I say<br>to her<br>and some of the responses that were<br>coming back were through like really<br>good I was thinking geez if I was that<br>boy's mum and he sent those things back<br>to me I may be a little off the dishes<br>so then what I've got to do was to ask<br>at some similar questions<br>in the Maori language<br>and some of the language that was coming<br>back was actually really good not all of<br>these children could speak Maori<br>but this gave them an Avenue to start<br>learning to speak Maori and it was so<br>good it was what I told him scaringly<br>good<br>and it's scaringly good for three main<br>reasons these are the three reasons I<br>can think of for now the first reason is<br>how does it know how does it know to<br>speak to the almadi because I've got a<br>good handle on where all the Maori<br>language databases are throughout New<br>Zealand and I know none of them shared<br>them with this overseas International<br>Company<br>and of course the answer is I took all<br>of its information from public resources<br>in social media<br>right so everything that's ever posted<br>on social media Facebook Twitter Tick<br>Tock<br>um YouTube where this video is going to<br>be posted it can get access to that it<br>pulls it all when it leans from it<br>um so that's a little bit scary in terms<br>of Maori data sovereignty so we've got<br>this movement at the moment Maori data<br>sovereignty where Maori have control of<br>their own data and this is kind of that<br>complete opposite of Maori data<br>sovereignty Maori have no control of<br>their own data so that's a concern<br>for second consumers<br>whether we like it or not at the moment<br>it's free eventually there will be a<br>cost eventually the the makers of GTP<br>will make a lot of money and they'll<br>make a lot of money out of the Maori<br>data that I've got and none of that<br>money will go back to Maori so so that's<br>a concern the other concern is that<br>um<br>GPT works so well<br>uh and the responses are so rapid and<br>it's quite cheap like it's free<br>people are going to use it when I talk<br>to these students half of them were<br>already using it people are going to use<br>it and in terms of a Maori language<br>activists a lot of people are going to<br>use it for today Al Maori and they're<br>going to use it so much that sooner or<br>later our language is going to start to<br>shift<br>and it'll be check GTP that's<br>controlling our language not our<br>traditional holders of the language<br>so that's kind of concerning as well but<br>as Brian you mentioned I'm a computer<br>scientist I kind of like to look in the<br>good in computer science I actually<br>think there's an opportunity for us to<br>take this tool as it is and then<br>repurpose it on some data that we have<br>control of so Maori language data that<br>related data<br>so we could potentially take this tool<br>and have it talking to us from a<br>manipotal<br>dialectic<br>and if we fit it I write information<br>and again<br>we can cut this tools said that it's<br>doing that then we can really start to<br>harness the power of AI for Maori and I<br>think that's possible<br>so uh that's it<br>so we've heard from our four panelists<br>Mike<br>pointed out there's no bad robots it's<br>Amanda we had the three C's Cuts<br>creation and collaboration and when she<br>suggested that there might be prompt<br>Engineers I thought well there's very<br>often quite late Engineers too so it's<br>better if we're on time<br>Nick encouraged us to be creatively<br>scared not deer in the headlights scared<br>uh chat GPT is coming for everybody's<br>jobs now I always said that if I had my<br>time again I would either be a<br>televangelist or a roofer I think chat<br>GPT is probably going to be a<br>televangelist before it's a roofer so<br>when I retrain I'm going to do a trade<br>but those trades won't be safe forever<br>and tataka a fascinating perspective<br>there on where these generative AI tools<br>are getting their data from as Nick said<br>we created chat GPT as tataka said we've<br>also created Chachi PT in threo<br>so we've got to consider all of those<br>aspects of generative AI which is what<br>makes this topic<br>scary engaging fascinating optimistic<br>and scary so we're going to start taking<br>audience questions like they're coming<br>in thick and fast you're going to have<br>to bear with me while I dig some glasses<br>out because you know I'm getting to that<br>age<br>oh gosh there's all sorts ago let's<br>start with a real low ball one then<br>Amanda what is a prompt engineer<br>ah very good question<br>so if you have played around with chat<br>gbt badge or any of the other tools that<br>are available to do<br>questions with using text to get a text<br>output you'll notice that not all<br>outputs are the same the quality of the<br>output depends on how you prompt and<br>there are some good rules around it like<br>break up your question into parts and be<br>very specific get it to improve itself<br>and so you notice that there is a way to<br>do that so that's one side of prompt<br>engineering the other side is actually<br>when you're building a language models<br>so let's say perhaps a new zealand-based<br>language model you can set different<br>features within that language model as<br>well and it doesn't just uh<br>live in the world of text it can also be<br>text to image text to 3D text to any<br>other medium or modality as they say in<br>AI thank you very much so it's not just<br>being on time there you go so this is<br>this is a question that's been upvoted<br>and I can see why I understand all of<br>you so two parts to it the second part<br>I'll come back to because it repeats<br>other questions<br>how will rampant disinformation and<br>individual narratives created by large<br>I'd like to vote Nick on that one Nick<br>you've been upvoted social cohesiveness<br>in the in the face of<br>well anyone who tells you they know does<br>not know so the the most important thing<br>about is that question and it's<br>definitely going to have an effect that<br>if you're asking that question I bet<br>you're looking in the right place don't<br>tell look to for me to reassure you but<br>I mean well how did how did social media<br>affect social cohesiveness<br>uh in Mark Zuckerberg's fantasy world it<br>brought us all closer together<br>not really what happened so yes I mean I<br>think generative AI asked the same<br>Amanda's been remiked and being remakeed<br>would any would anybody else like to<br>jump in there in terms of social<br>cohesiveness yeah I could build on your<br>answer there and say if we look back in<br>history at the big scandals we've had<br>with technology for example the<br>Cambridge analytica Scandal where our<br>preferences were nudged in certain<br>directions<br>due to a technology that we didn't even<br>know existed most of us back then so my<br>concern is that we don't even know how<br>AI will impact social cohesiveness it's<br>very likely to have an impact that we<br>and I would concur with that we don't<br>know what it's going to do in the future<br>it's an unknown<br>so<br>in terms of social cohesiveness I think<br>it's always unfortunate to meet people<br>face to face<br>so I think technology has taken that<br>away and if we can find Opportunities to<br>still meet people face to face be the<br>audience in the room listening to live<br>speakers<br>so just face to face so I think one<br>Avenue as well as what's been said about<br>being having that ability to question<br>what what you're seeing and what you're<br>hearing and what you're believing is to<br>find Avenues to meet face to face I<br>think that's quite important<br>the second part of that question and<br>echoed in another couple of questions<br>actually<br>um<br>is it possible for regulation to stay<br>ahead of the exponential growth in the<br>abilities of these models and indeed<br>just just the Bland question in what<br>ways do you think AI should or indeed<br>no no I don't think it's possible for<br>regulation to stay ahead because we're<br>not sure about impacts as I've been<br>their physical promoter cars then they<br>decided to well let's have speed limits<br>only strive on one side of the road<br>we're not sure what other unpacks so we<br>can't build regulations because we're<br>speculating so really we have to have a<br>few accidents we have to kill a few<br>pedestrians okay this isn't a good thing<br>um but uh I think that once we<br>understand some of the true impacts then<br>we should have the ability to regulate<br>and like for example in terms of AI one<br>of the issues we have with Maori data<br>sovereignty is<br>um finding out where it got its data if<br>we could regulate AI systems to show us<br>where you got your data I think that<br>would put a lot of breaks on things so<br>there are there are Avenues in terms of<br>Regulation but we're not quite sure yet<br>what we need to regulate against<br>that's my thoughts with just with my<br>Deputy Vice Chancellor hat on I would<br>like to point out that the University of<br>waikato does not condone pedestrian<br>accidents just<br>getting ahead of that one okay no so for<br>the for the hardware stuff that you saw<br>there's already a lot of legislation<br>that's coming out to prevent damage from<br>you know physical damage from robotics<br>in particular and but for the digital<br>world which is seemed to be a lot more<br>sort of wild Westy I'm not sure that you<br>can but definitely for the you know for<br>the robotic side of it there's we're<br>already working in that area and there's<br>already a lot of legality around what<br>you can use and what you cannot use and<br>that's just going to carry on to that<br>um yes I mean I think it's hard to<br>regulate a concept like AI that it's<br>definitely possible to regulate a<br>company and that's I think the major<br>threat it's what humans will do with<br>these things they're the ones who are<br>incentivized to create these texts well<br>maybe because they make money out of<br>them and if you think that social media<br>made billions<br>I don't know this is much more<br>transformative are we going to see the<br>world's first trillionaires now I think<br>we have power over that if we choose to<br>or we could just let them get richer<br>my biggest concern when it comes to<br>regulation is<br>the possibility to inhibit innovation in<br>ways that we really need help you know<br>we've got a big climate crisis right now<br>and we need really smart tools to deal<br>with that but on the other hand I think<br>the scariest thing that we do need to<br>regulate against is personal information<br>so right now if you are using tools like<br>chat gbt and you're putting that<br>information into the model it will<br>specifically tell you that that<br>information will be used for the model's<br>training which means that if you work in<br>an organization and you're putting human<br>resource information on any proprietary<br>information into the model it can be<br>sucked in there so I think that what we<br>need in terms of Regulation is to have<br>the ability to be forgotten and to allow<br>these models to forget us when we<br>request it<br>it's a interesting um idea the idea of<br>being forgotten by the internet that's<br>quite appealing I should mentioned<br>there's a whole bunch of 16 17 year olds<br>out there who really wish the internet<br>would forget them<br>um<br>building on onto taka's point there<br>about regulating and understanding where<br>the data has come from it's it's an<br>interesting illustration actually of<br>data sovereignty across the board now<br>how many of you have had the experience<br>where you've had a conversation in the<br>coffee room at work<br>um you're talking about Whitaker's<br>chocolate and it's talking about which<br>is your favorite then you go home that<br>evening and you're watching your cat<br>videos on YouTube and and all the videos<br>are being interspersed with adverts for<br>Whittaker's chocolate well or how did<br>how did it know how did it know that you<br>discussed Whitaker's chocolate that's<br>data sovereignty it's understanding how<br>what you say to people<br>is taken from you and given to somebody<br>else so you lose control of your own<br>data sovereignty and that part I think<br>if we could ask where is the data coming<br>from where did all of that Toreo come<br>from<br>um that's an interesting insight into<br>these generative models<br>so we'll see we'll see what's possible<br>um<br>as you might imagine several questions<br>coming up around jobs and the impact of<br>AI on jobs so so we'll have some of<br>those next<br>um<br>how do we retrain fast enough like how<br>do I become a roofer fast enough and at<br>scale necessary to ensure that we don't<br>end up with widespread social so you<br>said 19 of jobs susceptible to being<br>replaced or already replaced gone 50 of<br>the tasks and 19 of jobs there you go so<br>so these jobs are already going<br>are we are we keeping ahead of it are we<br>creating prompt Engineers promptly<br>enough or do we have to I'm sorry I just<br>got I just can't let that go<br>at<br>um yeah are we keeping ahead of that way<br>well the technology companies we're<br>dealing with and also like if you look<br>at the Apple Growers they're all<br>desperate for people who understand this<br>technology there's a massive shortage so<br>you can go from a relatively low skill<br>uh position to having a high skilled<br>high value position because there just<br>aren't enough people who understand the<br>skills and they're going to go through<br>the industry<br>um very quickly as long as the the<br>skilled people can keep up with it so<br>there is a great opportunity for people<br>not it's not all a threats It's actually<br>this is one of the most exciting times<br>to ever be alive because we have access<br>to information at our fingertips and it<br>is created in a way that we can access<br>and and absorb like we've never imagined<br>before but we have YouTube we have a<br>whole world of information now so I<br>think that there is role to play in the<br>individual to upskill and take a<br>proactive approach I also think there is<br>a role of universities to play to<br>prepare people for this new world but<br>also there's a role for organizations<br>and particularly for executives to<br>understand this big new Brave world that<br>we're entering into and to take on the<br>the job of sitting guard rails and<br>that leads very nicely actually onto a<br>question that somebody's asked here<br>um realignment of our human Workforce in<br>manual labor type activities creates a<br>huge opportunity for the education<br>sector<br>the question here is what is the<br>University of waikato doing to respond<br>and prepare for that opportunity to<br>uplift our community<br>so University lecturers what are you<br>doing<br>I've always been one for you Brian no no<br>well we're we're certainly doing I mean<br>if you look at the degree programs in<br>engineering you know we've expanded<br>we've got software engineering we've got<br>mechatronics we've got artificial<br>intelligence programs we've got an AI<br>Institute I mean we're we're really<br>right in the as you saw from the<br>research that we showed you we're right<br>in the thick of it to create the talent<br>pipeline for the future but you know<br>we're you know it's it's a very slow<br>um pipeline to get going but um it's on<br>the way so we are we're doing what we<br>just just supporting Mike we um we have<br>the AI Institute we actually have a<br>whole bunch of research projects coming<br>in and we don't have the people for them<br>we don't have the students for them in<br>particular Maori students so there's a<br>whole bunch of opportunities that are<br>happening<br>um and it's kind of uh exciting area for<br>computer science so if you're going to<br>choose a degree I think computer science<br>laughs<br>there's a couple of questions that build<br>on that so I'm gonna I'm gonna ask you<br>to reflect more on this because chat GPT<br>in or pardon me any generative AI not<br>just chat GPT any generative AI in the<br>context of Education it's both<br>opportunity and challenge for educators<br>so<br>um do you think that teachers those that<br>do do you think teachers that discourage<br>use of chat GPT because of issues about<br>cheating and Pleasures they should stop<br>discouraging it and lean in and start<br>encouraging it and and if so how long<br>should we wait before we start doing<br>that<br>can I say because I actually my students<br>they say what about chat gbt I said go<br>for gold if you could use it to improve<br>your projects then then do it I think<br>people who are scared of it are not<br>teaching correctly and I think you know<br>you've got to challenge the way you're<br>teaching and that's the way I pray and<br>what we've seen is you know the students<br>who are using it and using their own<br>creativity combining it they're coming<br>out with some great results<br>I mean I I think that's exactly right<br>um and and I think it's a great<br>opportunity but in education but it's<br>sort of like if you notice that chat GPT<br>a bot is doing something will teach the<br>kids to do something a bit different<br>tell them to use it but don't teach them<br>to just do that so in a way there are<br>loads of opportunities I mean kids come<br>to school with imaginations and one<br>thing that we know about jet gbt it has<br>no imagination chat GPT is limited by<br>the text we gave it<br>it cannot imagine beyond that it can<br>sort of extrapolate Beyond it it's never<br>going to ride Jane Austen because she<br>sat down and sort of had a mad crazy<br>idea and wrote a book so if we had if we<br>focused on that of chat gpt's doing<br>something we'll teach the code you teach<br>your students to use it but don't teach<br>them to just do that because well chat<br>gbt is doing it<br>fantastic spoke at the Auckland Writers<br>Festival on this exact topic<br>so<br>so yeah so I I totally agree<br>um I think we should encourage students<br>to use it is is teachers I should I<br>think we should be expecting more or<br>guiding our students to be using it and<br>then looking at you know what does that<br>mean in terms of testing and evaluation<br>um I think their<br>I think there are some fears<br>um and you know some of them are quite<br>grounded fears I remember when<br>um calculators first came out and the<br>mathematician says we shouldn't give<br>people to use calculators because<br>they're cognitive ability to do long<br>arithmetic will be lost<br>um and they were right I mean<br>people can't add or subtract so much<br>anymore because they don't need to<br>because they use a calculator so I think<br>the fear of our cognitive abilities<br>changing are real but people still use<br>calculators I use a calculator myself I<br>don't need to I need to add small<br>numbers I don't need to add big numbers<br>again so so I think it's in a similar<br>way using a generative AI that generates<br>ticks we may lose some of our cognitive<br>abilities to produce their ticks but<br>people are still going to use it anyway<br>our children like half of the children<br>that I saw you know a couple of weeks<br>ago were using it anyway so let's<br>encourage them let's figure out how we<br>can use it<br>in terms of<br>yeah so I I was part of the panel we<br>gave a talk about<br>um could AI write a book a couple of<br>weeks ago the Auckland Writers Festival<br>and was kind of a stupid question could<br>AI write a book because of course it can<br>write a book the real question should be<br>what kind of book came AI write<br>um and you can't there's kind of like<br>it's like how long is a piece of string<br>because the kind of book that AR can<br>write like today is going to be quite<br>different than the kind of book that it<br>can write a year from now or six months<br>from now or even one or two months from<br>now and some of the examples in The<br>Writers Festival people were saying well<br>yeah I tried it out a couple of weeks<br>ago and this is whether it's produced<br>and I felt like saying fade out again<br>now I bet you it's a bit different but<br>that's the speed that this technology<br>can work and yeah I think that we should<br>just need to be aware of it<br>because of those three issues really<br>language shift Maori data sovereignty<br>and then the financing behind it<br>I think it's so important that we do<br>teach it because of three key things as<br>well building on what these great points<br>that have already been said that if<br>we're not taught about the limitations<br>of these tools then we're going to run<br>into real trouble because there are<br>three things that these these uh<br>generative AI tools do the first one is<br>they hallucinate that's a fancy way of<br>saying confidently bullshits you know<br>it's 100 confident but not always<br>correct the second one is it's built on<br>toxic and biased internet data so when<br>you build it on that garbage and garbage<br>out you're going to get biased<br>information and toxic things that you<br>might not even realize is coming out<br>there so if you ask Bing chat for<br>example to create an image of a computer<br>scientist for you it's very likely to<br>create a middle-aged white man you know<br>that's just what it does and then the<br>third issue is copyright and IP issues<br>you might be used using it to create a<br>blog post or an essay or even create a<br>report to use in a corporate setting and<br>that information is not yours often it's<br>going to be someone else's word someone<br>else's ideas so I think those three<br>guard rails need to be taught and<br>there'll be new ones as it evolves but<br>if we're not teaching it people are<br>going to run into problems<br>thank you Amanda that brings us to a<br>question that I'm very pleased somebody<br>asked because if you hadn't I would have<br>done<br>um<br>I'm not scared about GPT for the reasons<br>that have been mentioned here I am<br>scared about that last reason or the<br>second to last reason you mentioned<br>there the bias inherent in the data that<br>exists on the internet<br>is informing how generative AI works<br>you only need to to look at simple data<br>statistics around the the women for<br>example how crash tests done these are<br>all men Crash Test Dummies are men cars<br>are safe for men they're not safe for<br>women that data doesn't exist so how can<br>generative AI be anything other than<br>sexist<br>so for the four of you how do we combat<br>the biased data that is creating this<br>I I have some ideas but I just didn't<br>want to hog the Talking Stick so to<br>speak I think firstly<br>um<br>tools like church EBT have a really nice<br>thing built in which is reinforcement<br>learning and this is your ability to say<br>to the model you've been built on all of<br>this information but<br>I want you to respond in specific ways<br>and you might even have a Constitution<br>which is what other language models use<br>these are the things you're not allowed<br>to say and this is what you are so you<br>can almost have two language models<br>talking to each other before it produces<br>an output for you to make sure it's<br>doing what you want it to do from an<br>ethical perspective and so it's for that<br>reason that if you ask chat GPT how to<br>create a bomb for example it shouldn't<br>give you an answer because it has that<br>kind of constitution built in and I<br>think the second way as well is that you<br>can choose the sample that goes into<br>these models and instead of just going<br>for massive massive data sets you can<br>also increase what you want and decrease<br>what you don't want and thirdly you have<br>a diverse set of people building the<br>models because they might just realize<br>that there is bias in there and stop it<br>before it gets out into the world<br>and I think that goes almost right back<br>to the first question where we said<br>where is it going to go and it was going<br>well we don't really know and I think<br>it's going to go on its own Journey<br>it'll start off as a wild west and then<br>it will start to have constraints<br>um because of the biases that are<br>already in there and yeah I completely<br>agree with Amanda on that one<br>I mean it's it's maybe I can be the<br>pessimist here but um we would expect<br>nothing less if Elon Musk gets control<br>of this which he wants to so right now<br>gbt is quite well behaved because it's<br>got guard rails and when they introduced<br>it they thought gosh we can't have this<br>thing that's spouting too much sexist<br>racist nonsense because otherwise that's<br>bad publicity so they did a really good<br>job of putting guard rails around this<br>Elon Musk wants a competitor a competing<br>generative AI that is not woke<br>and look at what that will do when he<br>releases that that will say any anything<br>any of the rubbish that is on the<br>internet that will amplify that because<br>there's a business model behind that I<br>mean the business model is give the<br>people what they want and what they pay<br>for and it's often that so yeah abolish<br>Elon Musk first<br>um changing Tech a little bit here to<br>something that's slightly less scary<br>Amanda you made mention of the<br>application of generative AI tools to<br>tackling the big Wicked problems like<br>climate change<br>so so maybe all of you could elaborate<br>on how we might use artificial<br>intelligence to tackle something like<br>climate change but as an aside to that<br>somebody else has very sensibly asked<br>the question what is the carbon<br>footprint of AI<br>so<br>I'm actually I'm not sure how AI would<br>Target climate change I think if there<br>was an easy answer we would have it<br>straight out in front of us<br>I'd have to do a bit of chicken I do a<br>bit of research to try and figure that<br>out<br>um<br>and yeah in terms of the carbon<br>footprint I'm not sure what that is too<br>either but um I can't imagine it would<br>be particularly healthy so these These<br>any other thoughts Amanda you you made<br>the comment about climate change how do<br>you see it helping so there has been a<br>huge progress and in fact some of it has<br>come from the AI Institute here at<br>waikato using models to predict how<br>changes are taking place and what<br>proactive measures we can<br>do in that space But I think that<br>requires a whole talk on its own so I'll<br>pause it for now and go to the other<br>question which is what is the climate<br>impact and it's huge these language<br>models to build them it was a huge huge<br>uh it came at a huge cost in terms of<br>climate costs and the Computing that we<br>do does come at a cost as well which is<br>when we're using it but my biggest<br>concern is if we continue to keep<br>building these models that's only going<br>to continue to cause that issue but if<br>we use what we've got it's not so<br>expensive just to use it it's that<br>training that takes months of training<br>with a huge server to build the language<br>models that we're using at present day<br>so there are some estimates that suggest<br>it's like to build something like chat<br>GPT 3.5 it's like taking a flight from<br>New Zealand to Los Angeles back to New<br>Zealand and back to Los Angeles and<br>that's you know the carbon cost of of<br>so there's a there's a few questions<br>here that are sort of related<br>um just just for clarity most people are<br>choosing to submit their questions<br>anonymously so it could just be one of<br>you asking all of these questions I I<br>get a sneaking suspicion that this one<br>might be the same Anonymous<br>um<br>could AI create code to advance AI to<br>create even more advanced AI to the<br>point of AI domination followed a few<br>questions later by in all seriousness<br>what are the chances of a Skynet<br>scenario<br>well I'll I'll start on the skeptic on<br>this one so um I I think this is we have<br>I've mentioned in my little talk there<br>about that that Archie wasn't conscious<br>and it's not sentient we are so far away<br>from that that<br>um I think you know this at the moment<br>you can just put your minds at rest this<br>is fatal isn't it they'll do it next<br>week now I said that and that you don't<br>have to worry about it I'd like to give<br>quick one quick analogy on this why you<br>if you think about flight and you go<br>back to 1903 and the Wright brother did<br>the flight then 1969 we got people on<br>the moon and you go right if we<br>extrapolate we'll be teleporting to Mars<br>by 2023 we're not we have got to a point<br>where you know we have we've maxed out<br>that technology and we're wondering<br>where the next big thing is and I think<br>you're going to get something like this<br>with this technology we're so far from<br>understanding our own intelligence let<br>alone artificial intelligence to make<br>that something that we could act that<br>will be sentient and conscious like<br>Skynet that I think<br>um the evidence just isn't there at the<br>moment what we have it's called<br>data-driven machines that are helping us<br>do uh things that we couldn't do before<br>um and I think that so I'm I'm not<br>worried about Skynet<br>it's not conscious yet<br>Nick<br>maybe wore a little bit a little about<br>Skynet because why not I mean it's a<br>worrying world but I mean if Skylander<br>is going to happen it's not going to be<br>built out of anything like chat GPT<br>which is has no capacity to do any of<br>that that can write your essay for you<br>but I mean in a panel of Schwarzenegger<br>and the two 800s end up and just wrote<br>everyone's essays that wouldn't have<br>been the movie that it was<br>so that's all General yeah generative AI<br>on land language bottles of really good<br>wordsmiths but yes they're they're not<br>going to Nuke you<br>yeah I think the fear of AI sells<br>um yeah and I think that's what's<br>happening a little bit at the moment<br>yeah because people are afraid of it has<br>become a big news topic and we have<br>evenings like this for example but yeah<br>I agree with my I think it's far far<br>away at the moment I think it's really<br>but last year would you have thought it<br>was unrealistic to be having a<br>conversation with chat GPT that much as<br>it's not sentient<br>the sentient<br>I've had way down the conversations with<br>just<br>yeah same<br>um a few last quick questions maybe<br>since we're coming to the end of our<br>time and there's a there's a ton of<br>questions I do apologize I didn't get<br>your question there's so many<br>interesting questions here and we could<br>keep this going all night but I<br>appreciate people have lives<br>um<br>we've all heard you all four mentioned<br>the term guardrails who determines the<br>guard rails who is ultimately the sensor<br>is about<br>having sovereignty over your data and<br>with this the soventry of the starter is<br>with this these overseas companies that<br>are producing these tools which is<br>really need to tune it around<br>you know people who own the data should<br>have control over their data and they're<br>not at the moment<br>so<br>I mean the guard rails that currently<br>exist are really well designed for the<br>purposes of open AI which is to avoid<br>bad publicity and nothing more so yeah<br>Spirit does a really good job of not<br>denying the Holocaust and all of that<br>stuff<br>but<br>um if you want the guardrails that<br>tataka is calling for which are they're<br>completely different things and I don't<br>think open a AI has any interest in<br>producing those they'll have to come<br>yeah that's a hard question because AI<br>is unlike other things that we've<br>experienced and that we've regulated<br>same with data which is it's a global<br>issue if someone makes a model in San<br>Francisco it will impact us here in New<br>Zealand you know just last week Japan<br>said you know what go for your life<br>build what you want in terms of what<br>data you put into your language models<br>there's no copyright<br>um we don't worry about copyright when<br>we build those models<br>so it's a very difficult question I<br>think it's going to require a combined<br>effort and I think having at the<br>population involved to make those<br>decisions a representative population<br>could be a really nice way to start and<br>it would have to be a global effort not<br>a a small effort from Little individual<br>groups and pockets of society<br>yeah I agree<br>so we are coming to the end of our time<br>what I'll do is use one last question<br>here as um as a framing to invite a<br>final comment for each of you now we've<br>heard about AI being scary we've heard<br>that we should be creatively scary<br>somebody asked if they're creatively<br>scary as parents would you encourage<br>your children to be a roofer or a<br>computer scientist but I think that's a<br>bit loaded so we won't go there<br>um<br>with herd optimism and we've heard we<br>don't need to worry about it just yet<br>so I'll ask you each for a final comment<br>but possibly reflecting on what is it<br>that you personally find scary about AI<br>tataka<br>so<br>my passion is Maori language<br>so it's quite scary how quickly this<br>tool has adopted and been able to speak<br>the Maori language so fluently<br>um<br>and then the manner that has has not had<br>control<br>but<br>but like I'm not so much scared it is<br>kind of excited because it's like okay<br>well if that's what I can do with data<br>there it's stolen or misappropriated<br>what can it do with data that is<br>appropriate and it started it's a lot<br>deeper and a lot more eerie specific so<br>it's kind of scary but like really<br>excited about some of the possibilities<br>they can do now that it can change a<br>bunch of Frontiers for Maori language<br>Maori knowledge preparation<br>um<br>propagation throughout you know Maori<br>histories Maori families so<br>scared but like really excited about the<br>future if we can harness It roller<br>coaster scared yeah<br>Nick<br>um yes I mean I think it's uh I mean<br>we're going to be living in a world with<br>these Technologies so there's no<br>avoiding that and they have great<br>aspects but I think basically if we just<br>think creatively about what we are<br>let's avoid just doing what they do and<br>let's do something different because we<br>are so much more than chat GPT<br>except GPT is a brilliant dazzling<br>Wordsmith that never thinks a single<br>thought and we think loads of thoughts<br>and we think of all the wonderful ways<br>we can be human in the future with chat<br>gbt which is our slave I mean you know<br>we can enslave chat GPT it's a machine<br>Commander my biggest concern is that<br>seeing is no longer believing<br>now with deep fakes you cannot trust an<br>image you cannot trust a video you<br>cannot trust audio and you cannot trust<br>what you see on social media as being<br>fact anymore<br>in fact people can very rarely tell the<br>difference between what's generated<br>through Ai and what is created by humans<br>and this has huge propensity for harm<br>and that is what concerns me the most<br>um<br>and I think going back to what you said<br>about um you've had conversations with<br>chat gbt that were conscious the<br>potential is it's sort of similar to<br>this that fake humans that have no<br>intelligence no conscience no sentient<br>that people are sort of Trapped into<br>believing that they're having a<br>relationship with the machine and it's<br>and it's completely fake and it's not<br>real and they're just being they're<br>being duped tricked and I think that is<br>going to happen and I think that's a sad<br>State of Affairs and it goes back to<br>what Nick said about keeping your<br>humanity and making sure that you deal<br>with real people because that<br>unfortunately I think that will happen<br>thank you<br>um I probably should have asked them to<br>end on a more positive note<br>so I won't know end on a more positive<br>note<br>um I I think we're on a cusp of a very<br>very exciting world and you know what<br>gives me most faith and most hope that<br>we are going to go in the right<br>direction in the end is people like our<br>panelists here who are thoughtful<br>intelligent educated individuals who<br>bring their Humanity to these<br>conversations and people like yourselves<br>who come along to listen and engage in<br>that conversation too this this crowd<br>here lets me know that we're going to be<br>okay this isn't artificial intelligence<br>this is the real sort<br>so All That Remains actually I do<br>apologize I should have done this at the<br>start look see I I forgot that and I've<br>got that bit and forgot that bit sorry<br>um and this is where we end so so All<br>That Remains really is for me to thank<br>our panelists Turner pardon me tanakawi<br>uh uh wonderful conversation thoroughly<br>enjoyed your
