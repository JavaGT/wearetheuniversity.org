the Cambridge<br>crew who I got to know when I was on<br>Fellowship there in 2019 and to the<br>Cambridge crew on line two but also<br>those who made the Trek to Caroline who<br>told me what an inaugural lecture was<br>and she hadn't I'm not quite sure what<br>you would have gotten tonight but also<br>to the lovely people at Leos who have<br>been so patient with me with all of my<br>questions and concerns about tonight and<br>for those of you online as Abigail said<br>we do have quite a breadth our son and<br>Jordan all the way to my in-laws on the<br>west coast of America so they're in I<br>don't know how many time zones hopefully<br>they're still awake or waking up I'll<br>try not to put them back to sleep but<br>and a particular shout out to the go to<br>gals and the seasons they know who they<br>are a particular and Skyping in from<br>across the world or zooming in or<br>panopticating in whatever we're using<br>here okay<br>so<br>likely due to my exotic accent wherever<br>I go in Lincoln be it to the shops the<br>restaurant or the optometrist I'm often<br>confronted with the question why are you<br>in Lincoln or what brings you to Lincoln<br>to borrow a lyric from one of my<br>favorite musical artists David Byrne<br>formerly of the Talking Heads my<br>favorite punk band well how did I get<br>here and those are the lyrics<br>I grew up in Ann Arbor Michigan the<br>state that looks like a hand right my<br>father was a professor of anthropology<br>at the University of Michigan and my<br>mother was a politician<br>growing up in an academic household was<br>formative<br>dad used to hold seminars in our lounge<br>and bring home all sorts of fossils so<br>virtually from toddlerhood I was exposed<br>to the life of the back of an academic<br>from a young age I was always interested<br>an interest that was nurtured by visit<br>to my visits to my maternal<br>grandmother's home in Holly New York<br>she was the last of several lines in<br>this small New England Village<br>and her house which was built by my<br>great grandfather in 1876 great great<br>grandfather in 1876. her house was chock<br>full of family heirlooms and they all<br>came with a name and a story from Aunt<br>Dale's rocker to Grandma ludington's<br>chandelier to Sarah glidden's handmade<br>coverlet<br>Connection to the Past was tangible I<br>learned about American history<br>from the stories about my family<br>particularly the women<br>this interest was reinforced by my<br>consumption of a series of young adult<br>biographies on historical women as well<br>as Laura Ingalls Wilder Little House<br>books<br>so I guess I was destined to be a<br>historian<br>but why medieval history<br>when I was nine my father had a post at<br>the World Health Organization in Geneva<br>we took many trips and I distinctly<br>remember my mother commenting on a<br>fresco<br>which she said was from the Renaissance<br>and I should mention that my mother<br>studied art history at basser college<br>with Adolf katzenellenbogan and most of<br>you won't know who that is and that's<br>okay but for the medieval scholars in<br>the room the name will be familiar<br>so I asked my mother well what was the<br>Renaissance and she said well it was the<br>what were those they sounded far more<br>interesting than the Renaissance and so<br>I was hooked<br>my passion for the Middle Ages was fed<br>by my time as an undergraduate at<br>Michigan State University and please<br>note this is not the University of<br>Michigan this is my Rebellion against my<br>rather famous father<br>while at Michigan State I studied with<br>Richard Sullivan a Carolyn journalist<br>who specialized in the Early Middle Ages<br>and Emily tabuto a medievalist who works<br>on 11th century Normandy<br>it was at MSU that I also met Joseph and<br>Issa convitz Joseph taught me modern<br>French history and they had been my Boon<br>companions on many trips around France<br>over the years and they and whose family<br>Hospitality I enjoy whenever I'm in<br>Paris<br>I also met my partner Gordon Thompson<br>whose question who do you like better<br>Rembrandt or Vermeer I still don't have<br>an answer for sometime later<br>we won't say quite how much longer that<br>was<br>I knew I wanted to pursue a masters in<br>early medieval history I wanted to dig<br>I ended up staying for a PhD it was all<br>set to do a thesis on the carolingians<br>when I first read George Dube a noted<br>medieval French historian<br>again I was hooked I started researching<br>aristocratic family life with an eye to<br>testing duby's theory about a wholesale<br>change in aristocratic family structure<br>in the 11th century one that resulted in<br>the marginalization of women and the<br>Precedence given only to the male family<br>members and slight spoiler alert duby<br>as Abigail mentioned one of my first<br>book right well the rest as they say is<br>history<br>I have spent my career investigating<br>aristocratic family life<br>my first book took a pro-thropographical<br>approach meaning that I assembled a<br>portrait of medieval family life from<br>the lives of many different aristocrats<br>the book offered a new vision of Family<br>Life One based on affection support and<br>collaboration and one in which women<br>were vital indeed recognized family<br>members<br>David Crouch a medieval historian and a<br>colleague once told me that his students<br>liked my book because it was I quote<br>warm and Squishy<br>and those of you who know David will<br>appreciate that comment right but I took<br>that as a compliment<br>following that monograph my next project<br>developed for my teaching of<br>undergraduates at Wittenberg University<br>in Ohio<br>this book tells the story of the Central<br>Middle Ages through the lives of members<br>of One aristocratic family the beaujon<br>Seas<br>this was a delightful book to write and<br>for which I also developed a digital<br>Humanities project<br>and I will say one of the highlights of<br>writing this book was I got to spend a<br>day in beaujon SE being shown around by<br>one of the local historians and then<br>vetted at the Town Hall by the mayor<br>with a four-course lunch and appropriate<br>wine accompaniment it was lovely<br>it was in researching this book that I<br>first encountered my current research<br>project Countess irmengard of Brittany<br>who lived from about 1070 to 1147.<br>my academic career has been dedicated to<br>weaving women into the history of<br>Western Europe<br>my lecture tonight will introduce you to<br>irmengard and discuss how one goes about<br>assembling the life of a medieval<br>Countess and restoring her to her<br>rightful place in The Narrative of the<br>medieval past<br>so we'll start with finding Irma guard<br>and here we have a chart sort of like<br>looking for wall finding Waldo is that<br>something over here uh but as you can<br>see you should be able to find urban<br>guard she's right here<br>but as you can see from this impressive<br>diagram and genealogy she was related to<br>some rather important people she was the<br>daughter of one count wife of another<br>count mother to a third and half-sister<br>to a King and great aunt to another king<br>and don't worry I won't quiz you on this<br>later I promise<br>next I'd like to show you an overview of<br>her life and just to see right here's<br>irmengard but you can see her<br>descendants are also rather Royal right<br>her great-granddaughter marries the son<br>of King Henry II uh Khan and Mary's<br>Margaret of Scotland so she's a fairly<br>as I hope you can see from just this<br>brief sketch what a fascinating and<br>complex life she led and this is just<br>the tip of a rather large iceberg<br>Urban guard really is an ideal topic for<br>a biography or perhaps more<br>appropriately a written life yet I'm<br>fairly certain that outside a couple<br>people in the audience who are experts<br>on Medieval women as well as those<br>friends families and colleagues who I've<br>ERM and guarded<br>no one has ever heard of this<br>interesting woman<br>why is that<br>well perhaps she was not well known or<br>well no as these quotes clearly indicate<br>Not only was she known she was well<br>respected by important people of her day<br>and I'm going to ask you to remember the<br>top line of this daughter of folk Glory<br>of Brittany because that's how we're<br>going to frame her life going forward<br>all right but this changes rather<br>dramatically when we get to the modern<br>era as the next two quotes indicate<br>these two sets of quotations are clearly<br>at odds with one another and do not seem<br>to describe the same woman<br>clearly the reputation of Countess<br>sermon guard of Brittany has declined<br>markedly since her own time<br>one might ask given the respect she<br>commanded particularly of members of the<br>clergy who have been often characterized<br>as notoriously misogynistic why has she<br>not been recognized by modern Scholars<br>as influential and an important part of<br>the history of medieval France<br>it is a vexing question and the answer I<br>fear lays more with the attitudes and<br>world view of Scholars rather than Urban<br>guard's own accomplishments<br>regrettably through this tendency of<br>dismissing women<br>and reducing them to passive objects<br>continues as the quote from the<br>distinguished French historian Jacques<br>indicates there<br>but even more recently in 2014 when<br>faced with a choice of including a<br>document that recorded Countess Irma<br>guard's active role as co-ruler of<br>Brittany the editors of a collection of<br>the official acts of the counts of<br>Brittany chose a later copy of the<br>document that erased Irma guard's<br>participation<br>it was a deliberate choice that records<br>the history of medieval Brittany in a<br>deliberate way one that excludes indeed<br>erases women<br>thank you<br>so looking for ermengard<br>as many members of the audience know one<br>can develop wonderful research questions<br>and topics but are they actually<br>feasible<br>are there sufficient sources or the<br>right type of source to investigate a<br>question or subject<br>my fear was that I was going to find the<br>documents that I would need to do<br>justice to irmegaard's life simply<br>weren't Extant<br>but given that I'm giving this talk and<br>I've published several articles on Irma<br>guard and I'm working on a biography<br>clearly there are sufficient sources to<br>put Flesh on the bare bones of the<br>chronological skeleton that I have<br>developed<br>I had to cast The Net widely to assemble<br>the pieces of urban guard's life and my<br>investigations have taken to me to some<br>rather lovely places it has been and<br>will continue to be I hope an adventure<br>so what documents and other sources can<br>I put to use to paint a portrait of our<br>countess<br>one of the challenges of doing medieval<br>women's history is the fact that we have<br>to rely largely on what other people<br>said about them<br>there are very few medieval lay women<br>who wrote sources abbesses poets<br>philosophers and Mystics are something<br>of an exception<br>for a woman of ermengard's time and<br>remember she lived from 1070 to 1147 and<br>her status their personalized voices are<br>scant<br>in Irma guard's case I have only one<br>document so far that is recorded in her<br>voice and it's a copy<br>so I'm relying on documents that weren't<br>penned with the intent of providing<br>information under regards life directly<br>they have to be mined differently for<br>information but also put in concert with<br>other sources to reveal a pattern a fact<br>the backbone of my study is a particular<br>genre of sources called documents of<br>practice<br>these sources record how things were<br>done as opposed to prescriptive sources<br>like laws which indicate how things<br>should be done or imaginary resources<br>like literature that portray the world<br>the way the author wishes it to be<br>the documents of practice that are most<br>plentiful are medieval Charters and here<br>you have an example of a charter one<br>from the archives at onge to give you<br>the idea of the sorts of details these<br>documents can contain and I know I have<br>several fellow charteraholics in here<br>with me uh I won't name names but we all<br>enjoy a good Charter and essentially<br>what a charter was is that it records<br>the transfer of property usually from a<br>member of the laity to the church and<br>here what we have is Countess irmengaard<br>right and her husband Alan and their two<br>young Sons Conan and Jeffrey and they're<br>making a donation to The Abbey of<br>fontevgod<br>unlike Modern Property Transfers these<br>documents can be delightfully chatty<br>indeed loquacious and provide all sorts<br>of nuggets of information<br>in addition to Charters I'm also using<br>letters Chronicles and literature to<br>provide context and color<br>but where you might ask do you find<br>these sources<br>I think my next slide is a giveaway huh<br>the documents that I need to consult are<br>housed in archives in France at the<br>bibliotechnacional and here you have a<br>beautiful slide of the manuscript<br>reading room but also in the arshive<br>departmental that a repositories of<br>local history<br>my first stop in finding Urban guard was<br>that the archive in Ren which has one<br>which ran was one of the two important<br>communal residences during ermengard's<br>time<br>however because she was also born in<br>anju the neighboring County I've also<br>consulted documents there<br>Charters are usually recorded as single<br>sheet documents do you have two examples<br>and they can vary in size from the small<br>which is the one up in the right hand<br>corner is actually pretty pretty small<br>it's about like that<br>and then one below it which is slightly<br>larger and there are obviously<br>challenges to reading these sources<br>because you know they have little two<br>holes in them from our little friends<br>the mice and also things just get broken<br>and chipped away the ribbons down here<br>would have been where a seal would have<br>been attached<br>the charters can vary in size from the<br>very small<br>to the rather large<br>and here we have another example and<br>when you try to read and transcribe<br>these things it can be like a kind of<br>game of Twister where you have to put an<br>elbow one place and an elbow another<br>place and a foot there right to try to<br>pull these documents apart because<br>they're written on parchment animal skin<br>and when they're folded up for decades<br>they're very difficult to disentangle so<br>it could be kind of fun trying to pull<br>them apart and transcribe and translate<br>at the same time<br>but that's part of the fun isn't it<br>but religious houses also copied these<br>single Street Charters into codices that<br>are called cartilaries and I will<br>apologize to my fellow<br>medieval charteraholics I know it's<br>cartoolery but over here but I'm an<br>American and I don't think I can<br>reprogram my brain to say cartoolery so<br>I'm afraid you're going to have to<br>suffer through cartilary for the<br>endurance of the speech<br>usually the construction of a cartilary<br>was in response to a particular event or<br>concern on the part of the religious<br>house<br>but due to the accidents of History I've<br>also spent time at the British Library<br>as the only 12th century cartilary or<br>collection of Charters from Brittany the<br>cartilary of sankhua of comprelet is<br>housed there and you may ask well how<br>did it get there<br>it is an interesting story and thanks to<br>the intervention of another aristocratic<br>woman lady Violet Beaumont<br>remarkably the cartilary of sankwa<br>remained in its Monastery until the<br>French Revolution right around about<br>1790-1791.<br>one of the monks smuggled it out with<br>his personal effects however when the<br>monk fell ill he gave it to a local<br>doctor in return for treatment<br>the doctor's son in turn sold it to a<br>Paris Bookseller where at Mr Stapleton<br>purchased it and brought it back to his<br>home Carlton Towers in Yorkshire<br>at his death his nephew Lord Beaumont<br>inherited his inherited his estate<br>at about the same time since about 1850<br>the director of the biblio technostional<br>was searching for French manuscripts<br>that had left the country<br>he commissioned a Mr Leo Metro to try to<br>see the cartilary in England<br>after much negotiation and seeking the<br>assistance of everyone from the local<br>curat to diplomats to high-flying<br>Aristocrats Monsieur matigo was granted<br>permission to look for the cultural area<br>in Carleton Towers literally to open<br>drawers and rummage through cupboards<br>and I sort of imagined something like<br>you know a house aristocratic country<br>house replete with you know first<br>edition stacked higgledy-piggledy all<br>over you know maybe a nice you know 11th<br>century manuscript stuck under a chair<br>leg to make it you know even it must<br>have been really something<br>and the student Matrix spent eight days<br>searching for the document and was<br>devastated since he was unable to locate<br>the manuscript<br>seeing his distress lady Beaumont was<br>moved to assist in the search but soon<br>tired when she went into the cello to<br>rest she moved about some materials<br>books and magazines and a voila the<br>cartilary of sanqua of comparlay was<br>discovered<br>thank heavens permission was given to<br>make a transcription of the document and<br>realized the importance of the cartilary<br>lady Violet donated it as part of the<br>eggerton collection to the British<br>Library where it remains today and if<br>you want to see it you can actually see<br>it online it's been digitized<br>and just as an aside Lady by that was a<br>rather interesting woman in and of her<br>own right she was vice president of the<br>Red Cross during World War one and it<br>looks like she was a bit of a rebel so I<br>don't know kindred spirit Maybe<br>in addition to written documents objects<br>space and Landscape also yield important<br>information about the life of counter<br>sermon guard<br>as I will discuss in a few minutes<br>this object of an Episcopal staff was<br>crucial to uncovering Irma guard's role<br>in a critical moment in the history of<br>the county of Anjou<br>spaces and the construction of spaces<br>also have been very profitable in<br>understanding Urban guard's life<br>during the course of her life she<br>personally founded two ecclesiastical<br>communities<br>located just a few kilometers north of<br>Ren in Brittany and the Church of the<br>savior in the Crusader states in the<br>Levant<br>each of these monuments was constructed<br>in a particular style to convey a<br>specific affiliation to a religious<br>order<br>hence they are useful in tracing Elite<br>Urban guard's allegiances but also<br>Testament to the considerable Financial<br>wealth she controlled<br>finally understanding the geography and<br>Landscape also provided answers to some<br>questions about the countess's life<br>and here we have a map<br>and I just want to say my husband is my<br>cartographer extraordinaire<br>who has made dozens of maps for me but<br>also many of my friends and for other<br>academic presses and this is you can see<br>what lovely work he does<br>um so if anybody in here needs a map I<br>know a guy<br>so irmengar just a little geography<br>lesson right so here we have France<br>and here we have the area of France that<br>this portion represents Irma spends most<br>of her life pretty much in this area<br>sort of uh in Greater Anjou this is the<br>county of Anjou over here<br>but also then when she marries count Al<br>and she moves to Brittany<br>she's born here in algae<br>and as a young woman traveled up and<br>down the Loire River up to The Abbey of<br>marmotia here just outside a tour she<br>will also spend time at fontevro as I'll<br>mention a little bit but then when she<br>moves from Olga she moves West and into<br>the heartland of Brittany where she<br>spends most of her time here in nant but<br>also up here in Ren and here's son so<br>pis LA forre right there<br>I want you to remember the Loire Valley<br>here because this is very important to<br>Irma guard's life as well it's sort of<br>the geographical locus of her power<br>and charting her life I found that<br>ermigard traveled to Western Brittany<br>only once in the 40 years that she was<br>countess<br>this seems strange given the Commodore<br>family's connection to the Western<br>portions the County however when one<br>looks at a linguistic map some clarity<br>is provided<br>Urban guard was francophone<br>and did not speak brittle a Celtic<br>language that is the language spoken in<br>the western portions of Brittany<br>this I believe circumscribed her area of<br>activity and influence to the eastern<br>part of the county specifically<br>oops I knew I'm gonna do it again I tell<br>you me and Technology man all right so<br>she spends most of her time here in the<br>pageante so that's pretty much where<br>while she's Countess she spends her time<br>so her area of influence is subscribed<br>to the eastern part of the county<br>given that count Allen IV married Irma<br>guard for her connections to alju and<br>Loire Valley her focus on these areas<br>now that I have described the pieces<br>that can be put together to create a<br>narrative that Roman God's life let's<br>now turn to her actual experiences<br>so on her as you can see on this<br>overview of her life the red bits are<br>the events that I'm going to focus on I<br>can't do all of irmengard in the time<br>remaining I can talk fast but I can't<br>talk that fast<br>so to encapsulate this rather rich life<br>I'm going to focus on certain highlights<br>that reflect marbotta Fran's description<br>of her as daughter of folk Glory of<br>Brittany<br>the key moments I've chosen reveal the<br>influence she exercised but also the<br>agency she had in determining the course<br>of her life<br>this was not a woman who was a passive<br>bystander in the events of her life and<br>time rather she was the architect of her<br>own life as much as any medieval person<br>could be and provided the counties of<br>Brittany in all Jew and hence Western<br>France with over 40 years of stable rule<br>by giving ermengard agency I am<br>deliberately pushing back against the<br>historiographical tradition of making<br>aristocratic women passive Bland objects<br>so irmengaard as daughter of folk<br>Urban guard was born in 1070 in all Jew<br>probably in all Jay<br>the capital city of Anjou at the<br>means the Surly or the grumpy<br>there's a great story about him from an<br>11th no excuse me 12th century<br>chronicler that says they had constant<br>bunions so I'm convinced he was grumpy<br>because his feet were sore<br>so her father was countful and her<br>mother was irmengard of beaujansi<br>our ermangard lost her mother when she<br>was about seven<br>and she continued to be raised at her<br>father's court and educated at the Abbey<br>of Laurel cere just across the river<br>from the Commodore Castle right here<br>okay<br>one of the questions I had about young<br>Irma guard was how was she educated<br>about the skills and behaviors she would<br>need to know as a woman of her class<br>her father did remarry shortly after her<br>mother's death but the marriage was<br>dissolved a couple years later when<br>irmengard's stepmother decided to become<br>a nun<br>about a decade later Irma guard excuse<br>me folk would remarry again<br>but for most of irmengaard's Youth she<br>did not have a close female relative to<br>act as a role model<br>at the Abbey of Laurence survey however<br>irmengaard interacted with mature women<br>of the aristocracy who could provide the<br>sort of guidance she would need the nuns<br>observing the abbess in her role as<br>manager of a nunnery and a lord in her<br>own right also provided Irma guard with<br>an Exempla<br>and the abyss of Lauren Surrey during<br>Irma guard's time was a formidable woman<br>who was not afraid to exert her rights<br>including digging up bodies to prove her<br>point<br>additionally memory of urban guard's<br>great-grandmother the founder of<br>laurencere Hildegard of lotharinja and<br>her great aunt were also present in the<br>abbey she would have heard of these<br>women from the nuns but also her own kin<br>as well as the skills necessary to<br>succeed as Countess irmengaard was also<br>educated in the classics and the Bible<br>by the nuns<br>growing up in algae was formative for<br>Irma guard and her connections to the<br>people there people in places in anju<br>profoundly shaped her life<br>while irmengar's relationship to her<br>stepmothers is opaque that with her<br>father is not they were very close a<br>closeness that developed as a result of<br>urban guard being brought up at her<br>father's Court<br>she was his sole Heir for over 10 years<br>and hence trained as his successor<br>folk would continue to consult Irma<br>guard and seek her advice until the very<br>end of his life<br>irmengard also came of age during what<br>Scholars term the 12th century<br>Renaissance<br>in other words the Revival and classical<br>learning<br>indeed an important contributor to this<br>many of the prominent intellectuals and<br>clergies associated with this school<br>passed through the Cathedral School at<br>all Jay just a short distance from the<br>combo Castle<br>the nuns of the wrong survey were part<br>of this intellectual dynamism and<br>corresponded with one of the great Poets<br>of the time bodri de burgoy<br>connected to this cultural Revival was<br>also a movement aimed at reforming the<br>church frequently called the Gregorian<br>reform movement<br>the seed bed for this reform and reform<br>activity sprung from The Abbey of<br>marmoutier located in Lower Valley just<br>a short distance from anje<br>as a young woman Irma guard traveled<br>with her father to this Abbey and was<br>well acquainted with its abbots monks<br>and reformers<br>throughout her life the Countess<br>supported mambutier and the reform<br>movement and helped to cultivate ideas<br>of Reform when she became countless of<br>Brittany<br>this was the environment in which Irma<br>guard was raised<br>the 1090s was a pivotal decade for<br>irmengaard she married in 1093 when she<br>was about 23 and left anju for Brittany<br>her husband count Allen IV of Brittany<br>was probably about 10 years older than<br>she and had been married once before<br>so Urban guard moved from alju to<br>Brittany from all Jay to the Breton<br>during the first three years of marriage<br>first three years of marriage irmegaard<br>had two sons and in 1096 when her<br>husband departed on Crusade she was<br>pregnant with her third child who would<br>be a daughter<br>Urban guard maintained stability in<br>Brittany during the five years Allen was<br>gone quote exercising the laws and<br>Justice of making peace unquote as<br>Abbott Jeffrey avondone would describe<br>count Allen returned from crusade in<br>1101 a changed man<br>it appears he may have contracted a<br>lifelong debilitating condition perhaps<br>malaria<br>the years after his turn return also saw<br>a change in the Commodore couple's<br>marriage by 1104 irmengard had left<br>Brittany and had become a nun at the<br>ABIA fontevro a short distance from OMG<br>what were the countess's motives for<br>leaving her husband and young children<br>into her County<br>like all people Irma guard was a complex<br>individual governed by a variety of<br>factors certainly she was inspired by<br>her dedication to religion<br>and indeed throughout her life she was<br>on something of a spiritual journey<br>she had met Robert of our bristle<br>the founder of fontivrow in all Jay who<br>even his critics recognized was a<br>charismatic figure<br>was inspired by his vision of Reform<br>monasticism where women and men live<br>together engaged in the Lord's work<br>under the authority of an abyss<br>fontervo had only been established for<br>for a couple of years and Irma guard<br>would have found that life there<br>primitive likely living in a shack and<br>with very few Creature Comforts<br>but there were ties That Druid font ties<br>to anju that Drew her to font of row as<br>well and I would argue her move there<br>was part of a political strategy<br>during the years between 1103 and 1106<br>were a time of crisis in the county of<br>Anjou as irmengard's father and her and<br>Irma guard's half-brother Jeffrey were<br>in conflict<br>Jeffrey feared that their father<br>preferred his youngest son Fulk over<br>Jeffrey as his heir<br>in fact Jeffrey was so alienated that he<br>joined with his father's enemies in<br>battle and supported them<br>Urban guards moved to fontivo thus put<br>her closer to the fight and gave her a<br>neutral base of operations close to anje<br>where she could work to resolve the<br>Discord between her father and brother<br>the angevan men count folk IV Jeffrey<br>and young folk her two brothers did come<br>to fontaro when Irma guard was there and<br>shortly after their visit foot IV and<br>Jeffrey were reconciled<br>Urban guard's decision to leave<br>monteverro in 1106 was also informed by<br>the political situation<br>why did Urban guard opt to return to her<br>life as countess<br>the accepted explanation was that she<br>was ordered to do so by the church<br>however there is no evidence that this<br>was the case aside from a oblique<br>reference in a letter to her from Robert<br>of arboristle written 10 years later<br>consideration of the context of<br>irmengard's Life suggests a different<br>interpretation one that is consonant<br>with the agency she exercised the<br>political climate and the important role<br>she played in the political community<br>in 1106 irmengard's half-brother Jeffrey<br>died in battle<br>while tragic in and of itself the news<br>that folked IV her father had been<br>involved in planning his son's murder<br>was even more devastating<br>so maybe he really was surly<br>this implication resulted in a crisis of<br>commodore rule in all Jew thus creating<br>political instability in the county but<br>also upsetting the balance of power in<br>Western France<br>irmengaard was needed to support her<br>father and to try to write the Commodore<br>ship<br>hence she left the convent so that she<br>had time to intervene support and advise<br>irmengard herself decided when she would<br>join fonterville and also when she would<br>leave<br>in 1109 three years later anju would<br>again call to our Countess daughter of<br>folk<br>in April of that year count folk her<br>father was on his deathbed and he knew<br>it<br>in preparation for his death he issued<br>several Charters to atone for his rather<br>serious and frequent misdeeds<br>Irma guard was at his side<br>one of these dying requests records that<br>folk quote especially consulted and<br>asked his daughter Countess of Brittany<br>to be at his side so that she could<br>provide him with the benefit of her<br>skillful and experience counsel unquote<br>the suspicion that folked IV had<br>actively plotted his son's death right<br>Irma guard's half-brother served to<br>undercut his authority in the county<br>complicating matters further was the<br>relationship with his remaining male<br>Heir soon to be Pope V was also<br>extremely difficult and strained<br>as the Elder folk lay on his deathbed<br>there was much tension in the county and<br>anxiety about the peaceful transfer of<br>power<br>Urban guard did more than just provide<br>Good Counsel<br>she was there to ensure the peaceful<br>passing of power from her father to her<br>half-brother<br>it was an encounter with an object the<br>Episcopal staff at the Cathedral of<br>Andre that led me to better understand<br>her role in this important transition<br>to affirm and sacramentalize one of his<br>gifts to the church folkla reshen placed<br>a staff<br>maybe this one or bakulus in the hand of<br>Irma guard who then gave the staff to<br>the canons symbolizing and enacting the<br>transfer of power and property from the<br>count to the church<br>later that same day<br>folk the younger who was not present at<br>his father's death confirmed the<br>donation by placing a key in the hands<br>of the same Canon to whom irmagard had<br>given the staff<br>ermangard signed and witnessed the<br>confirmation<br>these performative gestures were aimed<br>at securing a stable transfer of power<br>and it was through Urban guard literally<br>and physically the power moved from her<br>father to her brother<br>Urban guard's connection to her family<br>and anju were important factors in the<br>decisions she made in charting her life<br>course<br>her skills were critical for the success<br>of the Commodore House of Anjou and<br>indeed the stability of Western France<br>let us now turn to Urban guard's role as<br>marbod described her as the glory of<br>Brittany from her return from phone to<br>Roe in 1106 to 11 12 when it count Allen<br>himself retired to the monastery of<br>radon irmengard and Alan ruled Brittany<br>together<br>after 11 12 onward irmengard Co ruled<br>with their son Conan III<br>events of 1117 are one illustration of<br>why irmengaard was considered the glory<br>of Brittany<br>as we know Urban guard was widely<br>recognized for her political Acumen and<br>good advice<br>indeed Bishop marbod had praised her for<br>her quote powerful eloquence and shrewd<br>counsel unquote<br>the papal legit in France and the papal<br>Leggett is the representative of the<br>Pope in France also knew of her skills<br>and actively recruited her to assist in<br>a serious development in the county of<br>Brittany<br>sometime in 1117 irmengaard's son Conan<br>and a group of his Knights rode onto the<br>lands of the monastery of sanqua of<br>comparlay and did violence to the monks<br>and property<br>the damage was so bad that the monks<br>were quote exiled to the Wilderness for<br>a year unquote<br>the Abbott of sankwa was understandably<br>upset and appealed to the bishop for<br>assistance who in turn elevated it to<br>the attention of the papal Leggett<br>the justification that young Khan had<br>provided was that he'd been told by the<br>Abbot of radon that the property in<br>question belonged to his Abbey to right<br>on<br>so Conan believed he was acting on<br>behalf of radon an expelling sankhwa<br>from the land<br>unfortunately<br>radon's claim was completely spacious<br>and Conan ended up in serious trouble<br>several Church councils were called and<br>the count was threatened with<br>excommunication<br>Conan's recklessness not only had<br>implication for his own reputation but<br>also for creating a state of affairs<br>that could tip toward war in Brittany<br>recognizing the seriousness of the<br>matter the papal Leggett wrote to<br>Countess irmengaard to ask for her<br>assistance in resolving this dispute<br>so here is the one document I have in<br>her voice it is part of the letter that<br>was transcribed in the cartilary of<br>sankwa of comprelet<br>so the paper like it writes to our<br>friend Irma guard and the Countess<br>replied that she would be happy to work<br>to resolve restore peace between the two<br>ecclesiastical communities but she also<br>flipped the tables on the Leggett to ask<br>a favor of him as well<br>would the clergy consider lifting the<br>interdiction on Conan<br>here the Countess takes advantage of the<br>situation to work it so that she's able<br>to extricate her son from a very<br>difficult position<br>and here's a translation excerpts of her<br>response and as you can see right she<br>says you're lofty slave yada yada uh as<br>you place me between the monks so that I<br>might strive to restore peace and<br>Concord which I freely Embrace but<br>however I wonder if maybe you would see<br>your weight clear too right sort of in<br>the vernacular to see if we could<br>resolve the situation with Conan<br>they'll like it agreed to her request<br>and Conan at his mother's guidance began<br>the long process of making restitution<br>for this misdeed<br>this episode demonstrates irmen guard's<br>political intelligence in ameliorating<br>the blow to her son's status negotiating<br>peace between the two monasteries but<br>also how appreciated her skills were by<br>distinguished leaders of the church and<br>secular society<br>it was only in 1127 10 years later that<br>the Fallout from this misadventure was<br>cleared away<br>with Conan's reputation and hold on the<br>county secure Irma guard could now<br>consider other priorities<br>which brings us to another fascinating<br>time around 11 28<br>she became personally acquainted with<br>Saint Bernard of clairvo the dynamic<br>leader of the cistercians now the<br>cistercians are another order of monks<br>that are developing in the 12th century<br>and they're very much sort of dedicated<br>to Apostolic poverty<br>and like Robert of arboristal Bernard<br>was the compelling figure and Irma<br>Gerard became interested in the life of<br>a sister and religious at 11 30 she left<br>Brittany to become a nun at its the<br>Cesarean Convent in La Rey as you can<br>see the excerpts from Conan's donation<br>Charter sort of outlines this episode in<br>Irma guard's life<br>indeed we are told that Saint Bernard<br>himself veiled her the sign of the<br>respect and friendship they enjoyed<br>however irmengaard was not happy with<br>her new life<br>as Bernard's letters to her indicate and<br>regrettably her letters to him didn't<br>survive<br>naturally<br>sometime around 11 31 or 11 32 she left<br>the conference and France to travel to<br>the Holy Land<br>and she would have been about 60 when<br>she undertook this week's long and<br>perilous Journey<br>and I will say Irma guard and I are<br>roughly contemporary roughly<br>contemporary and I could barely<br>contemplate the thought of getting on an<br>airplane and going to Australia I can't<br>imagine sorry Ian uh I can't imagine 16<br>hours on an airplane is my idea of hell<br>um or 31 or however many it is right I<br>don't yeah not much fun but imagine<br>going from France<br>via probably donkey horse camel cart and<br>ship it would probably have taken her<br>several weeks to get to Jerusalem and<br>she does this at she's not old but she<br>may have been used to some of the<br>Creature Comforts of life so I have to<br>admit I think it's a true Testament to<br>her fortitude and strength of character<br>the counter said several reasons for<br>wanting to travel to the birthplace of<br>Christianity<br>pilgrimage was a way that medieval<br>people expressed their faith and Irma<br>guard had several family members who had<br>made the trip<br>having the chance to walk in the<br>footsteps of Jesus but also visit the<br>places<br>resident with the Old and New Testament<br>would have been compelling<br>it's also possible that she made the<br>journey as a way of doing Penance for<br>leaving the secession order<br>but there were also personal reasons her<br>second son Jeffrey had perished in the<br>Holy Land as a combatant<br>so she may have gone there to try to<br>find his grave or see where he had died<br>another ancestor that irmengard might<br>have tried to trace would have been her<br>great-grandmother Hildegard the founder<br>of Laurel Surrey who moved to Jerusalem<br>as a widow and became a nun at Saint<br>Anne's<br>additionally Irma guard's younger<br>brother folk the one who had been count<br>of anju becomes king of Jerusalem after<br>he marries the queen and given the close<br>bond between brother and sister travel<br>there would have also been appealing<br>frustratingly little is recoverable<br>about Irma guard's time in the Holy Land<br>like many pilgrims the Countess<br>undoubtedly visited the important sides<br>of Christianity like the Tomb of the<br>Holy Sepulcher where Christ died was<br>buried Golgotha where Christ died and<br>the River Jordan where he was baptized<br>we do know that Countess Irma guard<br>built a church in Nablus near the site<br>of Jacob's Well called The Holy Savior<br>and someday I'm going to go there and<br>see it but I have a feeling I'm going to<br>have to wait things calm down just a<br>little bit although my son who lives in<br>the Middle East keeps telling me ma you<br>know it's not going to come down just go<br>Um so we shall see<br>and this building project provides a<br>connection with the other Royal women of<br>Jerusalem so her sisters-in-law her<br>sister-in-law the queen and the queen<br>sisters<br>the land on which irmengard's church was<br>built came from Queen melison's dower<br>irmengard's sister-in-law while no<br>direct communication between these two<br>women is extant clearly irmengard would<br>have needed melison's approval to build<br>her church<br>on the queen's tower<br>Queen melison and ermengard also shared<br>the experience of founding religious<br>houses the queen established the nunnery<br>of Bethany so that her sister evetta<br>could become a nun there<br>and the sisters of Bethany served<br>irmengard's church at Saint Xavier which<br>is suggestive of a connection or<br>objects have also been useful in tracing<br>Urban guard's connection and what she<br>was doing in the Holy Land to another<br>member of the Royal Family<br>the martyrology of font of row records<br>that sometime after she became Abba<br>sabathany in 1144 that has sent precious<br>relics to fontevro<br>I believe that that heard about the<br>Abbey and the piety of the nuns whose<br>prayer she was requesting from irmengard<br>our Countess had been a nun at fontevro<br>and had founded Sansa peace as the font<br>of rhodian house<br>may have been impressed by irmen guard's<br>piety as a representative of this<br>convent which resulted her in setting a<br>gift to establish a tie with the nuns<br>there<br>mengard spent three to four years in the<br>she was back in Brittany by 11 34 and to<br>another important moment in her life<br>story<br>one which shows her agency and as the<br>glory of Brittany but also how her life<br>experiences question traditional<br>interpretations of the medieval past<br>upon the upon her return the count just<br>discovered her son Connor III had a dad<br>of cistercian Monastery just south of<br>busai<br>Irma guard's close association with the<br>cistercians likely influenced her son to<br>make this Foundation<br>however Kana did not follow through on<br>his generous bequest when Saint Bernard<br>was on a visit to Brittany he discovered<br>that the monastery had not been built<br>and the monks were living in destitution<br>so he flipped his wig or more<br>appropriately his taunture<br>infuriated he ordered his monks back to<br>the mother house<br>ermangard once again stepped in to<br>rectify matters as Conan stated in the<br>charter recording these events know that<br>I followed through on what I promised<br>from the request and intercession of my<br>contrary to the assumption that Noble<br>women who were nuns first of all did not<br>leave The Cloister after taking baths<br>and secondly that if they did they would<br>be ostracized Urban guard's departure<br>from the life of a sister nun had not<br>adversely affected her relationship with<br>Saint Bernard nor had it adversely<br>impacted her relationship with Robert of<br>our bristle 30 years earlier<br>indeed Bernard had come to Brittany to<br>see Urban guard to ask her to join him<br>on a trip to Aquitaine to help<br>straighten out some serious problems<br>with the church there<br>Urban guard's negotiating skill and<br>political Acuity are again evident for<br>she quote promised that when Bernard had<br>established a house of Jose according to<br>his order in other words a cistercian<br>house she would go with him to Aquitaine<br>the Countess had once again succeeded in<br>snatching Victory from the jaws of<br>defeat the conflicts surrounding the<br>establishment of the monastic house at<br>buzai had serious implications for the<br>Commodore house but through her<br>friendship with Bernard her intercession<br>and the respect she commanded the<br>monastery busai received what it needed<br>to establish a successful community that<br>would grow to over 200 monks and last<br>into the early modern period<br>her son's misstep was corrected the<br>communal relationship with the<br>the last document in which irmengard<br>appears as far as I'm able to determine<br>was a donation made as part of a church<br>council at her house at sansil peace La<br>Jorge between 11 46 and June 1147.<br>appropriately she was recorded as<br>advising her son to make a gift and here<br>we have the signature next to her name<br>on her last document and this is more of<br>the poem that marbottavan wrote to her<br>praising her beauty and her intelligence<br>one of the interesting things about this<br>poem and for those of us who work on the<br>Middle Ages right we don't have<br>portraits of the people we study but<br>there's actually a description of her<br>right flashing eyes and golden hair<br>um so I had this vision of her as this<br>sort of you know beautiful blonde woman<br>with flashing eyes<br>died in June of 1147 at nearly 80 years<br>of age<br>she was buried and buried in the front<br>of the altar of the Abbey of redone next<br>to her husband and her son only lived a<br>few months more<br>to conclude<br>in wrapping up my presentation I hope<br>you've enjoyed learning about irmengard<br>and have an appreciation of the power<br>and influence aristocratic women could<br>command<br>hopefully you also have a sense of how I<br>got here<br>but I realized I still haven't answered<br>the question why Lincoln<br>as you can tell from the discussion of<br>Countess irmengaard the people of the<br>Middle Ages hold a special place in my<br>heart and mind<br>I was attracted to this place to Lincoln<br>because of its medieval history which is<br>such a part of the town<br>living near a cathedral as Abigail<br>mentioned feeds my soul in important<br>ways and there are connections to Urban<br>guard<br>St Mary's Guild Hall was likely built by<br>King King Henry II Herman guard's great<br>nephew<br>yet it wasn't just the place it was the<br>people<br>and the possibility of leading a<br>distinguished group of Scholars<br>dedicated to understanding the past<br>through historical texts spaces<br>artifacts or literature<br>I spent several years as an associate<br>dean of an honors college in Indiana and<br>while the work there was interesting I<br>felt estranged or distant from those who<br>shared the same passion for the past<br>that I have<br>so moving to the UK to the University of<br>Lincoln to a city replete with medieval<br>history brimming with possibility for<br>collaboration with Heritage and with the<br>school full of interesting and dedicated<br>Scholars I traded the corn fields of<br>Indiana for the Delights of living in a<br>historic town that during irmengard's<br>time was the second largest in England<br>thank you<br>foreign</p></main><footer style="margin-top: 2rem; background: #0001; padding: 2rem; text-align: center;"><p>We Are The
