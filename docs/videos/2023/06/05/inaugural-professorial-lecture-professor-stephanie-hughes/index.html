Vice<br>Chancellor both of whom give their<br>apologies I know both David and Helen<br>Nicholson and Helen in particular who<br>was scheduled to be there would dearly<br>have loved to have been here to present<br>I think just with Helen's current<br>injuries I think she's just uh needed to<br>go home so I'm very honored to be able<br>to step in and my role as Deputy Vice<br>Chancellor for research and Enterprise<br>and act as host for tonight's inaugural<br>professorial lecture I'll give a brief<br>and then some welcomes and then I'll<br>I stand here under the umbrella of the<br>people of this place<br>and welcome you here<br>um<br>to the house that stands here may you<br>and to those that have passed we<br>remember you and wish you well in your<br>in your return to dark<br>um<br>um<br>greetings to everyone<br>um and<br>uhurangi professors uh Lisa Matthew<br>Smith Peter diren Patricia priest um<br>to our other members of the academic<br>party and in particular uh to<br>Professor Steph Hughes at tinakwe and<br>we're really looking forward to your<br>inaugural professorial lecture to your<br>far now who are here and online special<br>greetings of your father Peter your<br>sister Delwin and niece Nicole who I<br>believe are here to your<br>brother-in-law Brendan and nephew Reese<br>online and I understand some special<br>families whose research and and<br>scholarship uh you've particularly<br>engaged with are online so I know my<br>uh to<br>welcome so to those other members of<br>Staff of the University of otago<br>professors and and other people that<br>work at otago to visitors from the city<br>of Dunedin South Island New Zealand and<br>the Four Winds where of you may come<br>from in person or online welcome to you<br>all this is a great celebration of an<br>achievement of the highest academic rank<br>within our within our University<br>promotion to the position of Professor<br>so we like to celebrate with our regalia<br>with an opportunity together and hear<br>about the things that have led to that<br>promotion the the outstanding<br>activities the scholarship the teaching<br>the service and in particular the<br>leadership that has been demonstrated<br>professor Matthew Sue Smith will give a<br>more detailed introduction to Steph<br>before she gives her her presentation<br>Peter and Trish sum up before<br>Refreshments but I just want to say in<br>looking at your academic record and your<br>CV I can understand how<br>how it may have been a relatively<br>straightforward decision for the<br>promotion committee to to reach that<br>um when you your applications went<br>through you you have performed exemplary<br>uh service in teaching and research and<br>in particular you're working an area<br>where you are focused on delivery of<br>benefits and real benefits to a<br>community that needs at times quite<br>focused and fundamental research and<br>also it leads to discoveries and<br>developments that will go into your<br>teaching program you have leadership<br>both through the brain health research<br>center at the University and also in the<br>in the genetics teaching program that<br>demonstrate your commitment to service<br>as well so with that I will ask<br>Professor Lisa matasu Smith to come and<br>introduce you but I will also ask the<br>audience to share in my sincere<br>congratulations on behalf of the<br>university for this well-deserved<br>foreign<br>dean of the school of biomedical<br>sciences and it is my honor and my joy<br>to be able to introduce our inaugural<br>proof of professorial lectures that are<br>of Staff in the school of biomedical<br>Sciences so this is this is one of those<br>joyous occasions of of true celebration<br>where we get to I get to sit down and<br>look at you know at the the academic<br>achievements<br>um<br>of of our staff<br>which really makes me incredibly proud<br>to be part of this school and and in the<br>the role of acting Dean but kind of more<br>um<br>more exciting I think is actually<br>hearing the real story of of how these<br>outstanding academics have gotten to the<br>place where they are and you actually<br>really get a feel for the person for the<br>path that they've taken<br>um and I think you know I really wish we<br>had more of our<br>postgraduate students and and younger<br>Scholars to hear these incredible<br>stories about how kind of unpredictable<br>often our careers are and<br>um and how you know taking opportunities<br>and seeing seeing kind of these<br>interesting questions arise and<br>following those Pathways is actually how<br>so many of our staff get to this this<br>point and this point that we're we're<br>celebrating their success so this is<br>truly I think one of those one of those<br>evenings and it has been a joy to have<br>one watched watched this happen over<br>over the last 10 years or so when I<br>first kind of got to know about Steph's<br>research so just a bit a bit of the kind<br>of formal background that that we<br>celebrate and in these events<br>um Steph got her BSC from Victoria<br>University Wellington in 1994 degree in<br>Biochemistry went on and did her first<br>class honors<br>and graduated uh 1995 the next year in<br>genetics and molecular biology so you're<br>already starting to see kind of some<br>breadth and<br>um in the training and approaches that I<br>think have gotten her to where she is<br>today she's at a BH PhD in Biochemistry<br>at Victoria and then went off to do a<br>postdoc<br>in in July 1999 in the Davidson lab in<br>the department of internal medicine at<br>the University of Iowa<br>she was there through till 2002 where<br>she briefly did some lecturing at<br>Victoria University and thankfully<br>um and and followed that with sorry a<br>research fellow position at the<br>department of pharmacology and clinical<br>pharmacology at the University of<br>Auckland so she was there from 2003 to<br>2008 and thankfully in March in 2008 she<br>was lured to the University of otago and<br>took up a role her role as lecturer in<br>the department of biochemistry<br>uh here in in Dunedin was made a senior<br>lecture in 2012 associate professor in<br>2019 and in February 2022 uh was<br>promoted to Professor Embark in the<br>department of biochemistry Steph has<br>been the deputy director of the genetics<br>teaching program from 2017 to 2020 and<br>in 2019 was the deputy director of the<br>brain health research center and became<br>in in February of 2020 the director of<br>the brain health research center<br>so as we've already heard showing<br>outstanding leadership and research and<br>teaching<br>so as we all know or most of us know<br>stuff is a molecular neurobiologist who<br>has focused her career and will be<br>hearing tonight on understanding Batten<br>disease which is a group of cruel<br>childhood brain diseases and it was<br>um you know I first heard Steph about<br>10 years ago now I think talk about her<br>research on baton disease and and have<br>been following<br>um<br>that research and the impact of that<br>research since that time<br>stuff was really one of the early Gene<br>therapists in this country and she<br>established a multi-user gene Vector<br>facility here at otago that was later<br>funded by the brain<br>research New Zealand and that<br>um<br>that facility has not only allowed her<br>to do the incredible work that she's<br>been doing but is also supported many<br>many other researchers in this field in<br>the broader field<br>um<br>she says her greatest achievement has<br>been seeing gene therapy for one form of<br>baton disease moved into clinical trials<br>and this therapy was originally<br>developed in Steph's lab so that is an<br>incredible<br>achievement to take it you know from the<br>bench and and actually moving moving<br>into clinical trials and you know not a<br>lot of of people are able to take to<br>take that step<br>in recent years her group has extended<br>the research into multiple genetic forms<br>of baton disease using human neurons and<br>astrocytes to understand disease<br>processes and Test new Therapeutics<br>she's on several International baton<br>disease scientific advisory boards she<br>is clearly the expert in this field she<br>has received over 70 million and funding<br>from National major national and<br>international agencies including the<br>Royal Society of New Zealand Marsden<br>fund health research Council of New<br>Zealand neurological Foundation of New<br>Zealand cure kids Lottery Health<br>Charlotte and Gwyneth gray foundation<br>and Baton disease support and research<br>Association both<br>she is incredibly<br>um<br>well integrated across<br>departments and within the division of<br>Health Sciences here at the University<br>working with colleagues across the<br>division but also internationally she's<br>publishing her research in the top<br>Neuroscience journals also is an<br>incredible teacher and Mentor certainly<br>one of the the things that that I get to<br>see on on Facebook is is the great<br>celebrations that Steph's lab regularly<br>post about and you see the enthusiasm<br>and the students and the postdocs and<br>the people working in our group it is<br>truly<br>a wonderful group to to watch and watch<br>celebrate<br>which I think we need to do more of<br>um so she's as I say passionate about<br>her teaching she has taken 18 PhD<br>students through to graduation nine<br>Master's students and at least 15 honors<br>and and summer students so really<br>passing on that commitment and joy that<br>she has in teaching<br>she also has a commitment and skill for<br>outreach and engagement and<br>um<br>is involved in in lots of of public<br>lectures and it was in fact in the<br>public lecture series that I first met<br>Steph when we did a women in genetics uh<br>kind of road trip from through genetics<br>otago and I think there were three or<br>four or five of us who who traveled<br>around<br>um and got to talk to school kids in<br>communities about our research and as I<br>say that's when I first heard Steph talk<br>about batten's disease baton disease and<br>I um I didn't know anything about it at<br>the time and to see that<br>you know scientific rigor and the<br>commitment that she's made not only to<br>the research but to the families of<br>children with Batten diseases is<br>you know that that's what being a true<br>scientific researcher and academic<br>um is about and and so it is<br>um truly a joy to be here celebrating<br>your inaugural professorial lecture<br>um we've also um I get to see a lot more<br>of of uh Steph's accomplishments and and<br>other activities every morning we are<br>both fans of Wordle<br>um<br>and I have to make sure now that I don't<br>look at my Twitter feed because Steph<br>gets up a little bit earlier than I do<br>and and she does her Wordle first and<br>she's always posting little clues in her<br>statement so I I can't look at Twitter<br>until I've already done my Wordle<br>because I because otherwise Steph is<br>gonna gonna influence my my world of<br>choice we also share a love of alpacas<br>and and I get to see her um<br>her her life with alpacas and and her<br>other Critters cats and dogs and there's<br>always seems to be another puppy which<br>again brings us great joy<br>um so it's it's our lives overlap in<br>interesting ways and so I was very<br>interested to see the uh trumpet on on<br>your poster for your IPL and I notice<br>it's there because as a former trumpet<br>player or maybe we have another another<br>activity uh<br>um in common there but uh I think really<br>the title of of Steph's IPL tonight<br>really says it all is it it's about the<br>families the families who re the<br>families with batten's disease the<br>families in her research group and and<br>in the department<br>and that is what it's her passion for<br>the family and understanding the<br>development of therapies<br>for treating these these devastating<br>child<br>diseases so please join me in welcoming<br>Professor Stephanie Hughes for her<br>inaugural professorial lecture<br>call Peter rawa KO and takumatua<br>oh Stephanie takoingwa here<br>thank you so much for the kind<br>introduction both Richard and Lisa I'm<br>quite overwhelmed right now but I'll try<br>and calm down enough to begin my my IPL<br>so my IPL is all about family and I<br>think Lisa summed it up quite nicely in<br>terms of what family is to me it's not<br>just my biological family but also my<br>lab family<br>my friends my dog family my animal<br>family<br>and most importantly perhaps the Baton<br>family that's really sustained me<br>through my whole research career<br>so what I'm going to do is go through<br>the various types of family I believe in<br>my biological family I'll start with<br>going through a bit of my history and<br>how we came to Tyrone New Zealand my lab<br>families and our studies of baton<br>disease right from my PhD through to<br>today the role that the batten's<br>families have played in my career and<br>how important they've been<br>my collaborations that have developed<br>mainly through the role of the gene<br>therapy Vector facility that we've<br>developed at otago<br>and then I'll talk a little bit about my<br>so my dad's family originated on the<br>paternal side from Ireland just east of<br>sorry west of<br>Dublin John Hughes was a surveyor who<br>married a teacher Eliza and they<br>immigrated in 1849 and said her in<br>Wellington where John Hughes surveyed<br>the town belt<br>for about 200 pound I believe which<br>seems quite a lot of money maybe you've<br>got that number wrong<br>so he was a surveyor his son TW was also<br>my grandfather Vern was also a surveyor<br>so he sees a little bit of<br>family history going on here<br>on my maternal side or Dad's maternal<br>Napier and she is descended from Scots<br>right on the border of Scotland and<br>Wales sorry Scotland and England and her<br>father was a business owner they had<br>various shops around the North Island<br>so Vern and Evelyn got together and they<br>had three children dad also pictured<br>here and you'd never guess it but he was<br>also a land surveyor<br>so there's a little bit of family<br>history going on here and I broke the<br>mold dad said to me yesterday in fact<br>that you were supposed to be a land<br>okay<br>so when my mum's side<br>Edwin and Annie parsonage came from mold<br>in Wales via Bolton and they settled on<br>the west coast in the coal mines<br>and on the other side of the family<br>George and euphemia came from Scotland<br>as well<br>and their daughter Georgina married my<br>great-grandfather<br>and my grandmother made his passage<br>married Harry in Wellington<br>and they had two children my mum Anne<br>and my uncle Alan<br>so Harry you'll see something hanging on<br>his coach he won the iso which was an<br>award for public servants he was the<br>Secretary of Labor for quite a long time<br>and last century and he also<br>played the trumpet and the euphonium<br>so this is where that little link comes<br>from<br>so he was in charge of the brass bands<br>that went to Europe in the 1950s and<br>when he retired he bought a trumpet to<br>continue playing and I'll come back to<br>so mum and dad met in Wellington dad was<br>from the waikato still is really from<br>waikato he and Mum met in Wellington are<br>married and then one year later<br>that pops me<br>and then three years after that my<br>so we were brought up in broadmeadows<br>which is in the northern suburbs of<br>Wellington but we spent a lot of our<br>holidays on the kapiti coast around<br>raumati to start with and eventually we<br>had a property<br>in waikanae<br>the cavity Coast so we had a lot of fun<br>there had a great childhood we had a<br>caravan to start with and eventually a<br>okay so when I was a kid obviously I was<br>supposed to be a surveyor and we used to<br>go with jazz on the job and this is me<br>here and Darwin on a job up in the wire<br>rapper with jazz I used to quite like<br>being a chainman so I used to wander<br>around holding the staff forum<br>but as you can work out from now I<br>didn't actually quite make it to survey<br>I also had a huge interest in books and<br>I used to put all the books on my<br>bookshelf in Dewy Decimal order and<br>alphabetical order it's a little bit<br>crazy<br>so I did actually spent quite a lot of<br>time in libraries over my early<br>childhood<br>this is my grandfather again and as I<br>said he was a musician so I used to go<br>to his place and the weekends and try<br>and play the trumpet<br>by the time I got to intermediate so I<br>went to Rara intermediate I had the most<br>fantastic teacher Dougal Scott who some<br>of you might know he was at the<br>teacher's college eventually as the dean<br>there and he really inspired my love of<br>Science and moved me away slightly from<br>okay so from railroad intermediate I<br>went to Wellington girls college where<br>my mum had been an old girl and by<br>seventh form I was completely addicted<br>to science and maths I did all three<br>sciences and two maths and dumped the<br>English and all those other subjects so<br>I was pretty much on a on a track for<br>science<br>I then as Lisa as Sid went to Victoria<br>University but what she didn't say<br>forgot it but<br>um<br>back to in a minute was that I was going<br>to major in maths and stats okay okay<br>problem with maths and stats is you have<br>to learn all these formula and all the<br>derivations of all the formula by the<br>time I got to that I couldn't remember<br>how I was supposed to use them so my<br>marks weren't quite as good in that as<br>they were in population biology and<br>genetics so this is Dave Burton who was<br>one of the most fantastic teachers in<br>first year genetics and Peter's nodding<br>is here too you remember him<br>and he really inspired me to change over<br>from maths and stats to biochemistry and<br>genetics<br>go back to this so as I've mentioned<br>already I was into music so all of my<br>lunch times were either spent in<br>okay<br>so unlike today we are all of your<br>lectures are giving your lecturers will<br>give you PowerPoint slides and all the<br>notes I used to scroll everything down<br>at 100 miles an hour and then go home<br>and write them all out again so as you<br>can see I actually hear quite nice<br>writing at that stage today I'm sure my<br>students would say that it's not quite<br>so I did my BSC and then I decided to<br>stay at Vic didn't really want to leave<br>home at that stage it was too cheap and<br>the meals were too good<br>so I started my honors degree with Jeff<br>Rickards another fantastic inspirational<br>scientist who worked on chromosomes<br>mainly implant chromosomes and I wasn't<br>quite that Keen on Plants wanted to keep<br>working in genetics of human cells so he<br>really let me design my own honors<br>project which is<br>pretty much unheard of<br>so what I decided to do was take some<br>human chromosomes some blood cells treat<br>them with a drug that causes cancer and<br>have a look at what happened to those<br>cells and what happens is they form<br>these breaks in the chromosomes and<br>those are signs of what we call fragile<br>sites which are regions of instability<br>in in human chromosomes<br>so that was probably my first experience<br>of being actually able to design<br>experiments by myself come up with<br>hypotheses<br>so that all ended well and I graduated<br>from there this is where baton disease<br>really set in I was looking around for<br>an honor for a PhD project and I<br>stumbled into Bill Jordan's office and<br>he was really interested in<br>animal biology and animal disease he<br>worked on facial eczema<br>I was like well I really like to work<br>with you Bill but I don't really want to<br>work on facial eczema I want to work on<br>human disease<br>and he said well I've just had a PhD<br>student finish who worked on something<br>called Batten disease<br>and he told me all about what baton<br>disease biology was all about and what I<br>could do but he didn't actually tell me<br>anything at all about what band disease<br>itself was what the clinical symptoms<br>were or what the disease was actually<br>about<br>so I remember going home I remember<br>walking up to Mom and saying guess what<br>I'm going to do a PhD on baton disease<br>she was like<br>what's Batten disease and I said it's<br>got something to do with Gene Batten I<br>think she must have had it<br>turns out it was nothing to do with with<br>Gene Batten so then of course I went<br>couldn't google in those days so I went<br>to the library and had a look at what I<br>could find turns out that bat disease is<br>not named after Gene baton at all it was<br>named after a clinician Friedrich Batten<br>who identified two children in<br>1903 that had a infantile dementia so<br>they started losing all their capacity<br>it was actually discovered about 30<br>years earlier than that by a Norwegian<br>clinician but he wrote in Norwegian and<br>no one could find could interpret what<br>he'd said<br>so the disease has been named baton<br>disease ever since<br>so the New Zealand connections started<br>in the 1980s by a vet pathologist Bob<br>Jolly Bob Jolly's from Messi and he<br>identified<br>in the 1980s one sheep form of Veteran<br>disease so a naturally occurring model<br>in sheep where these sheep we're doing<br>some strange sort of behaviors they<br>would pace around they wouldn't flock<br>they wouldn't respond to dogs and<br>something was not quite right<br>so he identified that there was this<br>fluorescent material within neurons<br>within the brain that resembled what you<br>would see in Baton disease<br>his PhD student Dave Palmer who was also<br>a mentor of mine then identified what<br>the protein was that was accumulating in<br>the disease<br>um and from there Bill Jordan who was a<br>proteomics girl studied proteins decided<br>to try and work out why this particular<br>protein called subunit C was<br>accumulating in the disease<br>so I came in in the early mid 1990s and<br>started studying Batten disease I took<br>initially liver cells from the sheep and<br>ran probably 200 of these were<br>represented here are gels so they<br>separate proteins in two Dimensions to<br>try and work out and then compare and<br>contrast between liver from affected<br>animals and control animals<br>so that sent me on a little bit of a<br>wild goose chase it turns out that this<br>protein although it accumulates doesn't<br>really do anything in the disease<br>so that's kind of it's a marker for<br>disease but it doesn't actually tell you<br>a whole lot about what's going on<br>so I finished my first year year and a<br>half or so running all these gels not<br>really getting too far and Bill said to<br>me so what do you want to do next<br>he was a very like Jeff Rickards and he<br>was very open to letting me decide what<br>I wanted to do and I said well this is a<br>brain disease I'm working on liver I<br>want to be working on the brain<br>can't work on whole brains let's go and<br>make urinal cultures so let's take these<br>brains put them into a dish and see if<br>we can look at the disease in that way<br>and he said well<br>don't know much about that but off you<br>go you can go to a course in England<br>which is what I did I spent six weeks in<br>England learning how to grow these cells<br>and that's really become the backbone of<br>so this is probably one of the key<br>results from my PhD study we don't need<br>to worry too much about this cartoon but<br>obviously<br>the guy that did that knew what track I<br>was on<br>so what I did is culture neurons from<br>sheep affected with Batten disease and<br>normal neurons and then I looked for the<br>accumulation of that protein so being at<br>C which I see is said actually doesn't<br>have a lot to do with the disease but it<br>is still a good marker that we have<br>disease processes<br>in 1999 I graduated with my PhD and from<br>there<br>so just like Bill I haven't actually<br>told you what band disease is I just<br>told you what I did with it<br>so I'm going to step back and tell you a<br>little bit about what baton disease is<br>all about<br>it's actually a family of 13 different<br>genetic diseases<br>so patients will have one of 13<br>different or mutations in one of 13<br>different genes which lead to a very<br>similar disease the differences in the<br>presentation the age of onset and what<br>symptoms come in what order<br>so these are all examples of children<br>that have<br>one or other form of baton disease<br>they all<br>and all cases will develop normal<br>Milestones they'll be born apparently<br>healthy and at some point between the<br>ages of six months in January about<br>eight they will start presenting with<br>different symptoms<br>so those symptoms include blindness<br>Motor problems learning difficulties<br>hallucinations<br>seizures and eventually this is all<br>Progressive they get to the point where<br>they can't walk talk swallow or feed<br>so for the lay audience this is a<br>combination of epilepsy Alzheimer's<br>disease Parkinson's disease<br>at this point I normally cry<br>so in terms of the biology of the<br>disease it's also something called a<br>lysosomal storage disease which means<br>that this Protein that's accumulating<br>subunit C accumulates in something<br>called the lysosome<br>these lysosomes are like the recycling<br>centers of your cell<br>and so what normally happens is parts of<br>your cell that have been used up<br>go to the lysosome<br>and they get broken up by molecules<br>called enzymes so that they can be<br>reused in other parts of the cell<br>and Batten disease and other lysosomal<br>storage diseases instead of being broken<br>up they just keep accumulating okay if<br>you get too much material in that<br>lysosome eventually the cell can't<br>handle it especially neurons in the<br>brain and you get the symptoms that<br>so what happens when we get loss of<br>function of one of these genes the 13<br>different genes I mentioned is that<br>neurons go from looking nice and healthy<br>is shown in Green in this top image to<br>being really stunted and beginning to<br>die in the bottom image we don't<br>completely understand the link between<br>these genes the lysosome storage and how<br>these cells die<br>so now look away if you don't want to<br>know what the rest of the story is<br>I'm going to give you a summary okay so<br>a bit of a spoiler alert<br>I started off by telling you about the<br>cell culture models we developed in<br>Wellington I then moved to the US where<br>I learned everything I needed to know<br>about gene therapy<br>from there I came back to New Zealand<br>took the sheep that we'd been working on<br>during my PhD and developed some gene<br>therapy strategies for those sheep<br>and this has now gone to clinical<br>translation<br>so between there and here we've actually<br>now gone back to some of the cell<br>culture work using instead of sheep<br>cells using human cells to model the<br>disease and test a whole range of<br>different Therapies<br>okay so you can wake up again if you've<br>turned off for the spoiler<br>so my postdoc in gene therapy was with<br>Prof bib Davidson at the University of<br>Iowa and this was a big Center of gene<br>therapy at the time in the U.S<br>and she was a relatively new<br>investigator who had some really amazing<br>ideas and some big money which is always<br>useful<br>so gene therapy is basically where you<br>take a gene a piece of genetic material<br>that's potentially therapeutic<br>and you put it into a virus but you take<br>a virus and you disable all the bad<br>parts so you take out all of its DNA<br>and you put in your therapeutic Gene<br>instead and now we've got a happy virus<br>that can do good instead of causing<br>disease<br>so this is basically a vehicle that<br>allows you to transport that therapeutic<br>into tissues really effectively<br>it's very hard to take a piece of<br>genetic material without having the<br>vehicle there and get it into something<br>like the brain<br>so one of the studies that we did while<br>I was in the US was actually to use this<br>gene therapy approach to treat a<br>different lysosomal disease good slice<br>and Drome we had a really nice Mouse<br>model for this disease and what we could<br>actually do is take animals that already<br>showed symptoms<br>add the stream therapy and actually<br>reverse the disease progression and<br>reverse the behavioral deficits and that<br>was pretty incredible in something that<br>doesn't happen in all diseases because<br>once you've lost neurons it's very hard<br>the year I had a surrogate family sort<br>of away from home for the first time I<br>shared a flat with the Martin family and<br>I had many other great friends and<br>colleagues who supported me during that<br>time<br>okay so I'm actually going to skip ahead<br>past Auckland back to otago mainly<br>because when I was in Auckland I wasn't<br>working on Batten disease and that's<br>obviously the theme of my story tonight<br>so in 2008 I was very lucky to get a<br>lecture ship in the biochemistry<br>department and given a room and told I<br>could go and buy an incubator and a hod<br>to start making viruses I was actually<br>told at the time by a future hod that I<br>better do it somewhere away from him<br>because I was using viruses and that was<br>a bad thing<br>okay<br>so we made viruses based on the skills I<br>developed in the US it was done by a<br>team over time Kate Linderman was my<br>first honors student who continued as an<br>Arif for about four years after that<br>point and developed the viruses with me<br>holly then stayed for about 10 years<br>making viruses and in between we've also<br>had Alison and Kirsten working on these<br>viral vectors<br>we in about 2010 decided that it wasn't<br>just a lab thing we were going to expand<br>and support other research groups around<br>otago but also around the country and so<br>we set up the otago viral Vector<br>facility<br>and have supported as shown here over 14<br>million dollars worth of research a lot<br>of that funded through HRC marsden's and<br>the Brain Research New Zealand<br>core<br>so a huge number of collaborations<br>so you probably wigged up by now my real<br>passion is Baton disease and so while I<br>set up this core facility for everyone<br>what I wanted to do was cure baton so we<br>had the Sheep model which I've already<br>talked about<br>it's caused by mutations in a gene<br>called cln5<br>and it like I said these sheep have<br>develop symptoms including not being<br>able to flock in not being able to<br>respond to Sheepdogs and so on and they<br>also go blind<br>so the first thing we needed to do in<br>terms of gene therapy was actually check<br>whether sheep could be transgest or<br>infected with these viruses no one had<br>done it before so we took three<br>different types of viruses that we were<br>making in the lab and we injected them<br>directly into the brain using a bit of<br>sheep Neurosurgery<br>and shown in this image here in brown is<br>all the regions that this virus had got<br>where we can get this therapeutic<br>protein just by injection into this<br>ventricular space in the brain so pretty<br>impressive at least for this particular<br>virus we were using and spreading right<br>through the brain and very important in<br>terms of bad disease where we have<br>Global degeneration<br>we also got down to the spinal cord<br>through this method and right around<br>various regions that are important in<br>the disease<br>so this work has been done with<br>colleagues at Lincoln Day para again who<br>was involved in the subunit C story and<br>Nadia Mitchell who now runs the lab up<br>there as well as cash and Holly who made<br>all the initial viruses that became such<br>so like I said we first tested whether<br>viruses would work we then made these<br>viruses to express<br>cln5 which was the protein that was<br>missing in this form of baton disease so<br>we had three different types of viruses<br>I won't go into detail we injected them<br>into the ventricle of sheep<br>and unlike Mouse studies your ladies do<br>three sheep to get a study they're very<br>expensive to run and you need a lot of<br>so what we found I've already basically<br>spoiled this for you was that we could<br>preserve the brain structure so this is<br>an untreated affected sheep and this is<br>its brain that I'm just highlighting<br>paired to an MRI of a treated animal at<br>the same age and you can see the<br>difference in size so we're preserved<br>the structure of the brain and the<br>volume of the brain<br>we also restored the expression of this<br>protein that was missing in the disease<br>shown here in Black<br>and we could preserve their cognitive<br>function so we can preserve their<br>behavior<br>so this in red is an untreated animal at<br>21 months of age it's got a little GPS<br>tracker on its back so we can monitor<br>where it goes we put it into this 15<br>meter long Maze and we put some sheep at<br>the other end and of course they should<br>go flocking towards their friends<br>this particular animal doesn't quite<br>know where it's going and it just goes<br>round in circles<br>in comparison an animal of the same age<br>that's affected with baton disease but<br>treated with one of these vectors<br>it goes straight to go see it friends<br>this is just multiple animals showing<br>the same trend<br>okay so quite remarkable Improvement in<br>Behavior<br>and what I should say is these animals<br>unlike what I was showing in the U.S<br>were treated before they showed any<br>symptoms<br>Okay so we've been able to manage to<br>prevent symptoms developing<br>but if symptoms have already developed<br>could we actually maintain function<br>so I'll just walk you through this<br>little bit of data this is a rating<br>score we use for Batten disease the<br>ovine bed and disease rating score<br>something equivalent is used in humans<br>and basically the higher the number<br>the more cognitively functional they are<br>okay so there's a wide range of tests we<br>do and showing in blue is the control<br>animals they maintain function right out<br>to 30 months of age<br>untreated affected animals you can see<br>go downhill significantly and by about<br>18 months of age and no longer able to<br>eat or maintain their own health<br>so those are the two extremes if we look<br>at an animal that's been treated with<br>one type of virus<br>the lentivirus here you can see that<br>it's maintained its function when it was<br>injected before onset of symptoms right<br>out to 30 months of age so it's<br>declining a little and most of this<br>decline is because as retinal functions<br>impaired so it's eyesight is impaired<br>and we didn't treat the eye in these<br>studies<br>another type of virus you can see<br>maintaining quite nicely again<br>and if we inject it instead it's seven<br>months of age so this is in the dark<br>gray here you can see<br>we're not matching the untreated animals<br>but they're not as good as your features<br>so we haven't bounced the activity back<br>to normal<br>but they're still preserving function<br>that they had at the time that the virus<br>so this is the work that became a<br>clinical trial there's a lot more<br>studies that have gone on since then but<br>these are the ones we were initially<br>involved in and that's gone through to<br>the first patients in 2023.<br>okay<br>so I want to move on to what we've been<br>doing going back to cell cultures<br>so we wanted to see if we could fiercely<br>make different models of Batten disease<br>I've been talking about Celine five<br>there's 12 others we can work on<br>and we wanted to move from sheep into<br>human cells so the technology has been<br>around for the last maybe eight years or<br>so where we can take cells from humans<br>turn them into stem cells to primitive<br>cells and then generate whatever type of<br>cell from the body we want so neurons<br>heart cells muscle cells anything else<br>we want<br>so this work started when I was on RSL<br>in 2018 I went to Michael Ward's lab in<br>the NIH in the US spent seven weeks<br>being a postdoc again having a ball<br>getting into the lab and mucking things<br>up<br>and finally being able to generate human<br>neurons from these these stem cells so<br>this is an example of the first human<br>neuron that I was able to develop<br>so we bought this technology back to<br>Dunedin and this has been taken on<br>initially by engine oil Lucy and<br>oluwatobi in the lab developing<br>different models of baton disease using<br>these cells<br>so these cells like I said are derived<br>from skin<br>you add four magic factors called<br>yamanaka factors for those of you that<br>know the Nobel prize winning efforts and<br>they develop into these stem cells or<br>induced pluripotent stem cells that we<br>can then turn into different cells so in<br>our lab<br>we generate cortical neurons which are<br>the most important in Baton disease we<br>also generate dopaminergic neurons which<br>adrenal's been studying for Parkinson's<br>Disease<br>we look at astrocytes which are the kind<br>of support cells I know a lot more than<br>support cells in the brain but that's<br>kind of what they're known for<br>and we can also make these mini brains<br>so we can generate these<br>three-dimensional structures that look<br>like early developmental time points and<br>they are quite useful again for looking<br>okay so we took these IPS C cells we<br>differentiate them to neurons and we can<br>model different forms of baton disease<br>this technology relies again on the<br>viruses that we've been able to generate<br>over the last 15 years<br>but the good thing about these cells is<br>now instead of taking an animal model<br>straight away we can take a dish of<br>cells<br>okay so there's 96 wells in here and we<br>can treat with any sort of drug any gene<br>therapy any library of drugs that we<br>want to to see which ones might affect<br>Batten disease<br>to do this we need a readout so we need<br>to be able to see if we add this drug is<br>it going to cause a change in these<br>cells that suggests that we're returning<br>normal function<br>so we use a variety of different methods<br>to do this the one I'm showing here this<br>in red is enzyme activity within the<br>lysosome so these are the the core<br>recycling centers of the brain or the<br>cell that I was talking about we can<br>stain these in red<br>and we can compare those to control<br>cells okay so you can see quite<br>obviously here it's a big big difference<br>in the lysosome or enzyme activity<br>between bat and disease neurons and<br>controls<br>so the aim of this<br>is to look okay we throw all these<br>different drugs onto each well of the<br>cell and C of the plate and see which<br>ones turn Batten disease neurons into<br>more control like neurons<br>this is a long way from a therapeutic<br>application but it gives us that method<br>to be able to screen a lot of different<br>okay so that's kind of where we're going<br>in bulk I've also started becoming<br>really interested in personalized<br>medicine how we can actually treat<br>especially New Zealand patients with<br>better disease<br>and in December last year I was really<br>privileged to go and visit summer a<br>little girl from Cambridge I was up at<br>field days and I went around to see her<br>family and met summer and absolutely<br>fell in love with her she's the most<br>gorgeous little girl<br>um she's such a bright spark an array of<br>sunshine and we decided pretty much<br>straight off that we needed to find a<br>way of treating her disease<br>she has a different form of disease<br>ceiling one form of the disease but what<br>we're planning to do now is taking some<br>of her skin cells developing these ipsc<br>derived neurons and then screening a<br>whole lot of different treatments to see<br>if any of them will work for her<br>specific disease<br>and this work we've got a really great<br>team starting to be assembled with<br>Sierra Emma and adrenal together working<br>to see<br>what sort of therapies we can apply to<br>okay<br>so as I mentioned family is really<br>important baton's families are<br>incredibly important to our research<br>without them we wouldn't know what's<br>important in terms of their their life<br>and what they want us to be able to try<br>and treat<br>so I've had a lot of interactions<br>especially with New Zealand families but<br>also with families overseas at<br>conferences most of our conferences<br>involve both parents and families<br>clinicians and scientists which is<br>family associations are also really<br>important as well as the research<br>associations associated with them and<br>these are all examples of some of the<br>kids that I've met over the last 20<br>years or so<br>who all have various forms of baton<br>disease<br>so collaborations are really important<br>as I mentioned before most of them have<br>been based on our use of viral vectors<br>and gene therapy so I really want to<br>acknowledge although I'm not going to<br>talk about these<br>bits of research work various<br>collaborations so cliff and Warren both<br>been instrumental in work on Alzheimer's<br>gene therapy which is starting to come<br>to some sort of exciting place as well<br>worked with Ruth emsen for many years on<br>motor function actually on a protein I<br>worked on in my postdoc<br>optogenetics so Louise and I set up the<br>optogenetics<br>engine oil and I'm now working on<br>Parkinson's mechanisms and internal<br>spearheading that<br>we've got a really neat collaboration<br>going on and Parkinson's disease again<br>looking at diet and the potential for<br>diet and Parkinson's disease<br>and then in terms of gene therapy and<br>Baton disease I've been working with<br>Jill Weimer in the U.S on various<br>aspects of gene therapy and how to<br>improve the gene therapy strategies that<br>we've got we're all Auditorium<br>Wollongong on stem cells and gene<br>therapy and batons and then Catherine<br>and Peter on various more fundamental<br>biology aspects of proteins involved in<br>so as Richard and Lisa by said I really<br>love Outreach and service and I'm the<br>director of the brain health research<br>center and together with xiaowin and Ali<br>who were both Outreach managers for the<br>bhrc we've done a large number of<br>different events over the last few years<br>a lot of brain Day events where we get<br>children in at the Museum we go off to<br>schools we've run the brain bee for the<br>last couple of years where we get year<br>11 students in to talk about end do<br>quizzes on the brain which eventually<br>they go to<br>International competition<br>and most importantly most significantly<br>I guess in the last couple of years has<br>been the start of a program called<br>positively wired this is a program that<br>Ali instigated along with a large number<br>of others who are listed here where we<br>take into schools the idea that the kids<br>can control their emotions so how can<br>they link what they're thinking with<br>what they're doing and how they can they<br>can modify their emotions I'll just play<br>Maybe<br>I<br>think the children were really positive<br>about what they learned today I think<br>it's really important for children to<br>learn about how the inside of their body<br>works and how they have some control<br>over what their brain thinks they<br>absolutely loved looking at their brain<br>waves I think yeah I I would think that<br>everybody tips the where the headset<br>more and look at that more are they<br>loved doing the tags so they love doing<br>something physical<br>they spend a lot of time thinking that<br>they're passive<br>and their ability to be able to change<br>fixed mindsets and things that they are<br>anxious about so this has just been a<br>really fun way of learning about<br>the insides of their heads and about<br>simple ways that they can reduce that<br>anxiety or things to do when they are<br>I would see this being very very good in<br>those first that first year of high<br>school what was your favorite thing<br>about today<br>um looking at how my brain works on the<br>waves thing uh probably<br>looking at the brain thing on the<br>computer and playing the game and I was<br>probably playing the games and looking<br>yeah so the kids are really intrigued by<br>putting these little EG headsets on and<br>seeing their brain waves and how they<br>change when they're relaxed or when<br>they're stressed if we show them a scary<br>video<br>okay so at least already mentioned how<br>we met a woman in genetics did a nation<br>well almost Nationwide tour<br>um back in probably 2015 or so I think<br>it was<br>um I love giving Community talks and<br>I've given a range of these the most<br>recent ones the lab and I have set off<br>talking about our work in gene therapy<br>and stem cells but with a movie theme<br>and there's a lot of movies that have<br>you were kids one of our major sponsors<br>early on in the Baton gene therapy<br>research did a huge promotion during the<br>Rugby World Cup and there's a song that<br>was associated with that which I'm not<br>going to play because it will be in your<br>and sometimes I even do crazy things<br>this was at fashionomics at qmb where I<br>got up on the cat walk and did some<br>crazy things as a virus woman<br>okay so I'm almost finished my free time<br>Family what I do when I'm not in the lab<br>at work teaching or out in the community<br>is<br>training my dogs this is my first dog<br>Marley who was born in 2002 he passed<br>away a couple of years ago<br>so Marley he really wasn't into agility<br>Flynn and crickets are my two older dogs<br>and then I have a secret gang rumor<br>whisper and Echo who obviously got all<br>their names for for the same reason<br>this little girl Echo was only been with<br>me for four weeks and she's quite cool<br>sometimes we also have Invaders in the<br>house and this is a baby alpaca that had<br>to be hand raised for three months the<br>dogs or she at least thought she was a<br>dog in the end I think<br>okay so I can't forget the funding<br>family is a rare disease researcher<br>predominantly I've been really really<br>amazingly fortunate to get funding for<br>all this research from both small and<br>big organizations neurological<br>foundation and cure kids have been<br>critical to a lot of the starting work<br>that we did with gene therapy and then<br>the bigger funders have come in and<br>my otago lab family I can't thank you<br>all enough it's great to see so many of<br>you here tonight so we've had about 50<br>people through the lab over the last 15<br>years and hopefully I've remembered<br>everyone here not only do we work hard<br>but we have lots of fun as well<br>also wanted to acknowledge past and<br>present hods for all their support John<br>cupfield for hiring me in the first<br>and then finally I just want to thank my<br>biological family mum sadly passed away<br>two years ago she really was my rock my<br>mentor my project manager she used to<br>ring me up every morning and tell me<br>what I needed to do next I'm not quite<br>sure how I cope without that<br>and my sister and her family Delwin<br>Brendan Rhys and Nicole<br>with that thank you very much for<br>listening<br>wow that's a hard act to follow<br>uh<br>uh Co Peter didn't Taco English so my<br>name is Peter DIN and I um have the<br>immense privilege uh to be the head of<br>Department in which uh fantastic uh<br>Professor Stephanie whose Works<br>um so I get to say some thank you things<br>I want to start by thanking you all for<br>coming tonight uh these occasions are<br>really important to us as an academic<br>community and it's really great to see<br>both my academic colleagues who are here<br>looking at me going why is he wearing a<br>shirt with bugs on it but also uh family<br>and friends and and the rest of you and<br>of course those of you online it's<br>Delight that you can join us so so thank<br>you so much these as I say these these<br>occasions really mean a lot to us that's<br>why we get dressed up in the City<br>outfits<br>um but there are as much about you<br>coming to celebrate uh Steph's<br>achievement as they are about us<br>celebrating Steph and I just want to<br>make it clear if I haven't already we<br>are immensely proud of Steph and her<br>achievements uh to take<br>lab-based therapies from a sheep in a<br>field at Lincoln to actual clinical<br>trials uh in in patients that may have a<br>real beneficial effect for those<br>patients is a remarkable thing to do and<br>it's even more remarkable to do that<br>from here right we're a long way from<br>the center of these research things and<br>I think it speaks to a tenacity and a<br>clear-sightedness<br>of somebody to drive that<br>um all the way from New Zealand<br>so<br>I wanted to talk a little bit about that<br>as a thank you uh so sorry<br>it's very difficult to get me to shut up<br>so I'm going to take the opportunity to<br>say some things because one of the<br>things that I think people don't<br>understand about life sciences those of<br>you who are in other scientists is that<br>life sciences are incredibly hard uh<br>our DVC here Works in physics and<br>physics you need a pencil some thought<br>perhaps a picture of the universe<br>but biochemistry and genetics are not<br>like that not like that<br>there<br>I look forward to them it's hard it's<br>not just the development of new ideas<br>and new ways of thinking it's also the<br>fact that on average genetics and<br>biochemistry as Sciences don't work<br>we go in for lab every day and we<br>perform an experiment which is smart and<br>sensible and Brilliant and we go out at<br>the end of the day going well that<br>didn't work<br>and usually it doesn't work because the<br>Moon is in the wrong phase or a<br>physicist walk past your office or<br>something it's not normal and these<br>day-to-day agonies is one step forward<br>83 steps back makes our science really<br>difficult<br>so it is a remarkable achievement when<br>you see somebody who can line all of<br>those<br>continuous failures up to produce<br>massive success it's a remarkable thing<br>to navigate those difficult currents to<br>push against those unfavorable winds to<br>produce a path all the way to actual<br>change for a person and I think that's<br>what we saw tonight in this talk a clear<br>eye demonstration of going all the way<br>through a difficult science<br>another thing I really want to highlight<br>which I think is incredibly important is<br>that life science is is generally<br>problematic for another reason the the<br>problem is that it's very well it's<br>relatively easy for us as scientists to<br>spend our time<br>starting to understand how biology Works<br>starting to understand our problems in<br>biology but doing nothing about them<br>right we're often biology is an<br>observational science and it takes<br>special character to say hey I'm not I'm<br>not here to observe a problem in biology<br>I'm here to intervene I'm here to make a<br>difference<br>that intervening is very very difficult<br>and it can be very controversial<br>but I think if we're going to deal with<br>the Myriad biological problems that we<br>have as a society then we need people<br>like Steph who can with care and with<br>honesty and with with real ability<br>develop things like gene therapy<br>Technologies to develop these<br>genetically modified methods which allow<br>us to actually intervene in these<br>problems that is Brave<br>but it is also vitally important<br>lastly I'd like to say that good science<br>asks lots of questions right in fact I<br>think the best science really good<br>science goes out there and actually asks<br>more questions than ever answers<br>and I think we've seen that tonight I<br>think we've seen those questions and<br>we've seen the way that they've been<br>answered<br>but the real best science and let's face<br>it even in this straightened times in<br>this University and in this increasingly<br>gloomy world<br>the best science is what this University<br>and what universities around the world<br>should be doing and the best science not<br>only asks and answers questions it also<br>delivers for people<br>it is about helping it is about making<br>change<br>Steph's work<br>demonstrates her desire to use her<br>knowledge and her skills to help people<br>and I think that that is an incredibly<br>laudable and important thing an<br>incredibly laudable and important thing<br>for Steph and an incredibly good lesson<br>for the rest of us who work in<br>universities who can use our skills and<br>our abilities to change the world<br>stiff your promotion to Professor surely<br>represents<br>our recognition of your ability to head<br>in the right directions to push against<br>the difficulties and to actually deliver<br>it is an honor today to stand here and<br>thank you for your work in our<br>department it is an honor to be your<br>colleague it is an honor to thank you<br>for your work in science and it is an<br>honor to thank you for tonight's lecture</p></main><footer style="margin-top: 2rem; background: #0001;
