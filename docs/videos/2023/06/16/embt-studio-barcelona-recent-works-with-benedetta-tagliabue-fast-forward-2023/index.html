Throughout the conversation, key research themes such as environmental sustainability, interpretivism, and conjuncturalism will be explored. Spatial, material, and atmospheric examples of landscapes, buildings, and objects at multiple scales and temporalities will be used to illustrate these themes. <br><br>About the speaker:<br>Benedetta, principal of the studio that she co-founded with Eric Miralles in 1994, co-authored several projects in Europe and Asia that were recognized with prestigious awards.

uh from Barcelona good<br>afternoon in Oakland hello everybody<br>so thank you very much for accepting our<br>invitation and be ready to talk to us<br>from there and maybe seven point to join<br>us here in New Zealand and uh yes it's a<br>really great pleasure to have you here<br>and especially because uh you are such a<br>representative of a particular uh same<br>moment of architecture that is uh<br>essentially the moment in which there's<br>a reflection going on and there is a<br>particular capacity to move into the<br>space of architecture as a research so I<br>think that what you have been doing is<br>uh particularly important that can<br>inspire all of us and particularly our<br>practitioners and students here in New<br>Zealand<br>um<br>architecture member of the Urban Design<br>hubris organizer of these lecture series<br>of this semester of the universe of the<br>school architecture planning of the at<br>the University of Auckland these lecture<br>series as in the previous years is made<br>possible by our sponsor who is the New<br>Zealand only manufacturer of largest<br>marketing Gibson plasterboards and<br>drywall systems<br>that doesn't deny that uh regards uh<br>emppd<br>device<br>established by benedicta in 1994 in<br>partnership with the late Eric Mirage<br>together they embarked on a creative<br>Journey that resulted in numerous iconic<br>projects like the new Scottish<br>Parliament living in Edinburgh they put<br>a city Town Hall in the Netherlands the<br>headquarters of gas natural and the<br>rehabilitation of the market<br>neighborhood in Santa Catarina and<br>Barcelona they also designed their own<br>residence in the old city of Barcelona<br>which we might have the chance to have a<br>glimpse into it today Thanksgiving to<br>the fact that benedetta is located there<br>and might show us around pulling the<br>Anthony passion of Eric into that into<br>that into in the year 2000 but it has<br>taken the hand of their practice their<br>sole partner leading the embt from its<br>equity in Barcelona she responded his<br>capacity by establishing of racing in<br>value part of the world including Paris<br>and Shanghai the portfolio of the office<br>is known for its diversity and includes<br>a large-scale educational complexes like<br>the School of Management of<br>Udan University in Shanghai<br>and they have also learned the expertise<br>to the creation of Central Central Urban<br>public spaces which is one of the things<br>that that will touch upon today like the<br>Haven City in hamburger and have left<br>the Denmark on Transportation<br>infrastructure through the design of<br>several Metro stations particularly to<br>in Paris and Naples currently under<br>construction while contributing to the<br>material Improvement of our cities and<br>data shares the knowledge and experience<br>through teaching and engagement in<br>renowned institutions such as Harvard<br>University Columbia University and it's<br>saying Barcelona and hopefully a certain<br>point also in Auckland her lectures are<br>a prestigious architecture forums and<br>universities can reach audiences<br>worldwide and she's honored to serve as<br>juror of esteemed International Awards<br>including including the prestigious<br>although the characteristic of that<br>office and the practice is very<br>articulated and diverse<br>and very difficult to summarize I don't<br>know how to introduce it I would just uh<br>probably I like the one things that<br>strikes me in the in their work and this<br>is something that probably I would<br>summarize as uh attention between uh<br>well retention and protection I would<br>say so embedded ideas values practices<br>and materialities so their architectures<br>are experiments of activation of former<br>constant presence so essentially<br>memories ideas narratives and invention<br>so bringing together if you want the<br>past and the future in the instant in<br>the particular moment of creativity and<br>that's something that of course is very<br>challenging because open sapling<br>determinacy open receptor<br>uncertainty and anxiety in the project<br>but that's what makes this project<br>particularly relevant and that's a<br>something that is mixed between you know<br>being very rigorous and precise and you<br>can see in many under the details of the<br>work that we see today at the same time<br>is a creative investigative Dimension<br>experimental Dimension that looks at the<br>cultural expression techniques and uh as<br>I said there is a form of<br>intensification of that particular<br>instance that particular moment that is<br>transmitted to the words to the<br>experience of the users that usually are<br>engaged into into the production space<br>after it is completed such<br>intensification equilibri is the work of<br>historical monuments and Landscape a new<br>buildings of objects such as the ones<br>that benefit we discussed today<br>including the extraordinary part where<br>she is located now the beautiful Market<br>in Santa Catarina the Spanish Pavilion<br>at the World Expo in Shanghai and other<br>things that we should be surprised<br>showing us something that without<br>good morning thank you so much uh thank<br>you and can you can you listen to me<br>because I just changed it to the yes to<br>the headphones<br>so I know it's difficult to communicate<br>from a distance and I know it's a it's a<br>it's kind of important to let only<br>something pass by and I'm at home uh<br>this is eight in the morning in<br>Barcelona and I know it's the afternoon<br>in Oakland so we we already have a great<br>time distance between us and I think<br>it's a it's very nice to uh make you<br>here with me as much as possible because<br>the communication could be a little cold<br>but the fact that we are communicating<br>is is really the desire to have you as<br>much as possible involved in in the<br>world we we have here so<br>just a second sorry for interrupting you<br>what I forgot to say in introduction is<br>that we have a quick announcement time<br>at the end of this of this presentation<br>so please put your question into the box<br>of<br>thank you so I I we are at home in in my<br>home uh I have Sarah next to to me who<br>helped me in preparing this uh this<br>lecture of today but I thought it would<br>be nice to introduce you to my home<br>because I think the concept of home is<br>very important and long time ago with<br>Rick Morales in the 90s when I came here<br>in Barcelona we were looking for a space<br>to stay and we found a very destroyed<br>space and here we are with this uh space<br>now but when we found it it was it was a<br>storage so I think it's kind of nice to<br>go around and to start from looking a<br>little bit at the home I don't know what<br>you see but uh this is uh this is a home<br>sorry I wish to to show you a little bit<br>and and the space was in abandoned space<br>because it was used as a as a kind of a<br>storage and we said this is fantastic<br>because in the center of Barcelona we<br>can have a sort of Loft and we started<br>to to imagine this old space used as a<br>lot let's say reuse but then the Loft<br>became more more full of remains and we<br>started to work with the beans and with<br>what was existing and with the walls for<br>example and we realized how many people<br>had been living in this house before us<br>so for example I don't know if the<br>internet will work until here but<br>underneath some wallpaper we found all<br>these drawings which were incredible<br>because it was really like you know like<br>Pompeo something was coming out it's not<br>totally precious it's something which<br>has the the beauty of the past and also<br>to tell us that some other people were<br>here before us and also the in the walls<br>we found these arches this is gothic<br>this is really something which is uh<br>from more than 800 years ago so I don't<br>know I mean<br>800 years in the in human civilization<br>in Europe is a kind of not so ancient<br>but it's kind of fantastic to find it<br>very very clearly as it is here for<br>example uh on the wall we found this<br>this Angel no it's very much inside the<br>wall but it's a it's a it's a it's an<br>angel which<br>maybe you can see here I don't know if<br>you can see it's a it's a little<br>sculpture inside the wall and uh and<br>it's a it's really a kind of a remain<br>which is a connecting all the the house<br>with the old city with the inhabitants<br>with the history which is really in in<br>layers here so we can also give a little<br>look to the to the rest of the house uh<br>a little a glimpse not so much because<br>also I have a guest sleeping here<br>but uh and also the the internet maybe<br>but I think this is kind of important to<br>give a little look to the house before<br>starting the slides because here we we<br>worked about we learned about something<br>which is really important to us which is<br>this idea of reuse or kind of accepting<br>uh reality accepting what you find Eric<br>miralia is my late husband and partner<br>he was saying it's like an old dress and<br>and we we put it upside down outside up<br>and and it's a it's becoming ours it's<br>becoming hours but it's it has things<br>that already had there I think this year<br>for example in the piano which was open<br>only a few days ago this uh this idea of<br>margin so this idea of of the the places<br>where architecture is uh is not really<br>thought are very important and reuse is<br>one of them oh this uh this uh kind of<br>saying okay we live inside a place where<br>other people have been living where<br>other hands had been working and we<br>accept it and this is our action into<br>architecture this is important and we<br>have learned it here very much so I'll<br>show you only a little bit more hoping<br>that the internet uh still punches<br>uh here we have a the the libraries the<br>library is like is like a labyrinth with<br>this construction of a library Enrique<br>was very very proud about because it's<br>the most essential<br>bookshelves that you can ever see it's<br>only tubes a lot of people have have<br>copied it but uh but it's so simple that<br>it's really impossible to copy<br>and and then some secret passages<br>and<br>also we have let's say if internet<br>method works we have<br>kind of modernistic rule which is uh<br>which is the only room which from uh<br>from the uh from the destruction of the<br>storage you know this was used as a<br>stone age so this is<br>we already started probably uh moved in<br>a part of the house where there's no<br>connection no connectivity or poor<br>connectivity she will be back soon<br>you're back<br>sorry we missed you for a while you're<br>muted<br>okay so I'm back that that's it this<br>means that tour of the house is finished<br>now we go to the slides<br>so what I wanted to say is that uh that<br>this house is the beginning for our<br>thinking about<br>reuse or living together with uh with<br>other Generations<br>also I think I started in Venice which<br>was very important for this idea of<br>other studying New Generation old<br>generations and and live together with<br>the old Generations so I think now we<br>can go to the slides which are<br>explaining a little more about other<br>projects which came after the uh the<br>this uh this discovery of the house<br>uh we have a problem with<br>with connecting now because maybe we<br>we had this this connection no that's it<br>that's it<br>so I I show you uh our very last uh<br>small project I think we are a a studio<br>an architectural studio in Barcelona and<br>we do different type of projects big<br>ones and small ones and I think the<br>small ones are very useful you know this<br>for example is only a pavilion for the<br>fair in Milan and and this Pavilion is<br>is kind of very fast built they told us<br>in in January and it was finished in in<br>April and and this is a very kind of<br>very good sport I think you know for an<br>architect we design cities in China we<br>designed big big projects which involve<br>the city the neighborhood uh but we love<br>to do also these small things because<br>it's the same concept and I think it's<br>really important to be able to have a<br>kind of a possibility of moving the<br>different scales this is a kind of a<br>tradition in Spain and Italy in Italy uh<br>in the 50s as the The Architects were<br>saying we designed from the city to the<br>spoon<br>so in a way I like this very much I<br>think it's a it's something very<br>entertaining it's very beautiful to have<br>a studio which is able to design a city<br>and have the involvement and what you<br>need in the city but then also small<br>things like for example this Pavilion<br>which is of course it's in the fair it<br>has to give a concept and and the<br>concepts are very near to what you can<br>see for a city for example and in this<br>case it was about<br>what is the uh Mediterranean tradition<br>of construction where you find the<br>sustainability being together with uh<br>nature and and being able to introduce<br>nature into architecture sustainable<br>material like wood other very cultural<br>and sustainable materials like ceramic<br>and also explaining things into a kind<br>of a uh into a kind of<br>like a a little joke let's say you know<br>explaining with uh with happiness uh<br>this uh Ceramics are writing things and<br>what is writing you can read a little<br>bit here is writing feel as if at home<br>and you read here in the benches where<br>people can can uh can can can see it and<br>can rest from the visit of the of the<br>fair you can read this word Casa and I<br>think this is now very Central in our<br>architecture we try all the time to make<br>architecture which makes you feel at<br>home<br>and this is not a little thing this is a<br>this is very much and I think now in<br>architecture we are at the point where<br>we have to ReDiscover a lot of things of<br>our profession and I think this<br>rediscovery goes through the discovery<br>of small things and this is small things<br>which maybe before were kind of<br>invisible and one of the Small Things is<br>the feeling of being at home in a place<br>so in a way it's a fantastic thing to to<br>think I I can design this project which<br>makes people feel as if they are at home<br>and I think this is a great greatest<br>idea we have in mind in this moment what<br>you are looking at now is our studio<br>and the foundation Eric mirales<br>as you know Eric Mirage was a wonderful<br>architect it was very special he was I<br>think he was a genius that's why I<br>married him but he was also a little<br>crazy and that's why I also married him<br>because he was crazy<br>and and luckily he died very young he<br>was 45 only so at the end we decided to<br>create this Foundation which is showing<br>his work<br>uh our work that we are upstairs in the<br>office but also the work of other people<br>who are very young and the desire of<br>making new experiments in architecture<br>new uh ways and and and this is a really<br>what we would like to to the foundation<br>to be about<br>uh I am now showing you what is above<br>the foundation which is our office<br>at our office is also a kind of a reuse<br>in an old uh an old place in Barcelona<br>so<br>we are putting in this old place in<br>Barcelona in something that we created<br>the species that uh that we've done<br>during our career recently uh dealing<br>mainly we would we would is something<br>that we like very much because it's a<br>material which is really alive it's<br>really sustainable so we are<br>investigating more and more on how to<br>introduce wood in whatever we do and uh<br>the main material as you can see in this<br>video is uh is uh is people is alive no<br>is uh the ideas of everybody this uh<br>kind of confusion but also richness<br>which comes from the many Minds many<br>hands uh who are proposing who are doing<br>and who are collaborating in whatever<br>result we have in the office so the the<br>hand work is very is very Central<br>because we believe that in architecture<br>you can express mainly by doing things<br>so let's go a little on<br>this is an image of Rick Morales when we<br>won the Scottish Parliament I thought it<br>was nice to introduce him uh we<br>introduced his foundation and many of<br>the ideas that we are working with now<br>are with uh with his spirit<br>the house you have seen before it's a<br>not very change from time ago and this<br>is a little introduction in spite of<br>everybody I was very attracted by this<br>houses which looks so deteriorated from<br>the outside but with all these fantastic<br>big spaces in the inside I don't know if<br>you can listen to the to the music<br>I found a home where all memories are<br>preserved and beautiful new stories are<br>created<br>foreign<br>this is a publicity and we have done<br>this<br>this uh this video this uh you can find<br>it on Apple TV and it's in the series<br>home so they propose me to talk about<br>this house<br>uh my children one of them said this is<br>terrible you're selling yourself to the<br>Commerce and uh and the other child the<br>the girl she said okay you can do it I<br>will be next to you I don't like it very<br>much but I I never will look at it but I<br>I do it and this document is there so<br>you can look at it if you want and these<br>are images of the house that you have<br>just seen and when was inhabited by Rick<br>Morales and myself and the house is a<br>kind of a good way to start first of all<br>to say how important it is to make<br>architecture which makes you feel like<br>home and also to show a project which<br>was really next to our home which is a<br>market Santa Catarina this was<br>I I mean from my home to this Market is<br>kind of two minutes walking and this was<br>our our Market It Was a Very Old Market<br>Rick showed it to me uh and he was<br>saying this is the place where I was<br>coming to buy with my grandma I had very<br>great reminds of it and it was a very<br>important piece then one day we heard<br>that they wanted to destroy it and and<br>this was really terrible we started to<br>protest the Rick wrote letters to<br>politicians and the politicians said<br>well you know if you have better ideas<br>why don't you give the ideas and we<br>started like this this was very nice<br>Barcelona which was a still very very<br>like a little town which which was very<br>helpful in a way and so we started this<br>conversation with the politicians and we<br>ended up<br>designing the market Santa Catarina and<br>also designing the neighborhood inside<br>and and we always say that we did that<br>because we are very egoistic we wanted a<br>better neighborhood we wanted a better<br>Market we wanted a better place to stay<br>so also this is a like making your<br>neighborhood more home<br>and in this case we have another video<br>and<br>The Voice here when it will appear is<br>very well known I will tell you only at<br>the end who who is the man talking but<br>maybe you will you will<br>uh you will uh yes I have to kiss his<br>age Alba doesn't have a steady job<br>life is just that rambling along<br>aimlessly<br>Santa Catarina is a market with a hidden<br>treasure<br>outside<br>are we have a problem you can only hear<br>some fragments of the sound<br>sorry so it was now possible for you to<br>listen to The Voice just bits and pieces<br>unfortunately<br>it's a Pity because I wanted to make a<br>competition who won who who could guess<br>the voice but the voice was I tell you<br>by Woody Allen<br>that's why I'm very proud that someone<br>decided to make a video with the voice<br>of Woody Allen to explain the market in<br>this very strange way but I I think it's<br>nice though you make some architecture<br>and then people can take them and<br>interpret them and this is also part of<br>making it like a common uh knowledge and<br>and home for everybody so the situation<br>on the Santa Catarina Market was a very<br>difficult<br>Place let's say very condensed very uh<br>very narrow streets here we have the the<br>photographs of the sky around the the<br>neighborhood and when we started to work<br>on the market the idea was to open also<br>the the neighborhood and to make the<br>market become more visible more part of<br>the welcoming towards this neighborhood<br>so we worked a lot with models we work<br>also with politicians explaining a lot<br>of what was happening and one of the<br>strategies of saying we want this Market<br>to be more visible to be the welcoming<br>part was to make it visible for the<br>people for the city that what was<br>happening inside and what was happening<br>inside was beautiful really going inside<br>the market is mixing with the food with<br>the<br>perfumes with the capacities of the<br>people to create<br>different recipes and with the survival<br>of families so I think there is so much<br>around food and food in cities is now<br>becoming a kind of a subject and I think<br>it is so important now it's really<br>becoming very clear that the chain of<br>food is one of the many of the main<br>mechanisms which make the city go go on<br>and we discovered this through the mark<br>Santa Catarina market and it was a very<br>beautiful Discovery so the Santa<br>Catarina Market at the time was a very<br>gray place this is a photograph of the<br>moment when we started the competition<br>it was beautiful inside look at all<br>these colors and all this life but<br>outside was really a kind of a gray<br>deteriorated place so when we started<br>work we had to uh conserve and do<br>respect some of the parts that we<br>thought it was a very Noble like these<br>walls and and also we make the<br>excavation and we found a lot of<br>archeology because display case was a<br>monastery before so there was a lot of<br>ruins of churches but then on the top we<br>had this uh this group positioned which<br>was kind of explaining the beauty of the<br>inside it was kind of welcoming towards<br>a new doorway towards the neighborhood<br>of Santa Catarina and air and light was<br>entering again into the city which was<br>closed until that moment so this was<br>let's say the way of introducing life<br>into the neighborhood and this covering<br>with ceramic with colored ceramic the<br>roof of Santa Catalina was really a way<br>to make the city be more active in this<br>place to give back the life which was<br>not there until the moment<br>so this this was really a kind of a<br>beautiful way to start in the in action<br>in our city but meanwhile we had other<br>projects going on and uh we were for<br>example designing the headquarter for a<br>big company which was going back to the<br>place where of origin the gas company<br>and and we wanted this headquarter not<br>to be an imposing headquarter but to<br>also have this kind of uh home feeling<br>so that even if it's a glass building<br>it's a kind of a broken glass building<br>like a fire you know this uh is the gas<br>company and we thought gas is is a kind<br>of a flame and a flame is bringing this<br>idea of changing continuously so this is<br>a bill building which is kind of a<br>fragmented volume so whenever you look<br>at it it changes it's very different<br>meanwhile we were also designing a park<br>and it's a big Park in in a place which<br>was an industrial part in in Barcelona<br>and now this Industrial Park was<br>transforming into a place with a lot of<br>water<br>connected with the seaside and with the<br>city so that it's the first real<br>connection between the city of Barcelona<br>and uh and this and the Sea and this is<br>going through a series of piazzas which<br>have water which have a permanentation<br>and which are kind of buffers between<br>the city and and the nature which is<br>happening on on the seaside<br>so this was a transformation which was a<br>very strong Urban transformation uh the<br>people were surprised that to the people<br>who use to live here in a very difficult<br>neighborhood called La Nina which is a<br>kind of a<br>the old Bronx of New York this was<br>comparable to La Mina and they were very<br>happy to be able to use these new<br>facilities which we're giving back this<br>kind of relaxed way of life a playful<br>way of life which I think is the first<br>movement towards having a healthy<br>Society because if you find a way to to<br>uh to move easily this is a beautiful<br>way to have a healthy Society<br>so uh after all these experiences we<br>were called also by cities far away we<br>could win in Hamburg maybe you recognize<br>this<br>but the people who designed all the<br>landscape is actually our studio and<br>this was a very very long uh work that<br>we started I think in 2001 it was the<br>first competition that we won after<br>Erik's departure Rick Morales departure<br>and and it is uh it is a kind of a a<br>public space work transforming what was<br>the harbor of Hamburg which was I mean<br>it's one of the biggest in Europe into a<br>place for people so it was a big work<br>because it was really about uh inventing<br>places which can attract people which<br>can again make people feel at home and<br>and this was at the beginning something<br>that people in Germany were denying<br>you're saying oh well you come from<br>Barcelona and you think that here we<br>have a beautiful weather like Barcelona<br>but this is very tough weather you will<br>not attract people so these images are<br>images with a lot of people in the in<br>the public spaces that we have designed<br>and this is really like to me like being<br>very proud you know I'm very proud that<br>we could have this result of making the<br>the people feel at home here so much<br>that they come to relax with with<br>families and friends and and this is a<br>kind of let's say transformation of the<br>harbor and not only making it from boats<br>to people but also making it from uh<br>from a very tough German place to a kind<br>of a more Mediterranean public space so<br>I don't know if they would accept that<br>in Hamburg but I think and more or less<br>is a is a is also something that they<br>desired very much to have a little more<br>of a Mediterranean in their own lands<br>and here in Italy because you do<br>something and then people call you<br>because they say oh wow you did very<br>well there please come and do something<br>here and this is a place in Italy called<br>Rimini Rimini is uh is an historical<br>City Roman and Leon baltistar berti was<br>uh working here and a fantastic and<br>Federico Fellini was born in in raymini<br>so a fantastic place but it is also the<br>worst uh Seaside place of the world<br>let's say it's a massive massive beach<br>with thousands of people and it's so<br>massive that now the city wants to make<br>it more natural so they called us and<br>say please make this Street between the<br>city and the seaside becoming a more<br>natural place so here we transformed<br>let's say this this very very tough uh<br>limit between the seaside which at the<br>end is a natural place and the and the<br>city into an re-naturalized Park so now<br>where there was a very tough Street of<br>of loading and unloading they have a<br>park with uh with a lot of nature with<br>Dunes uh trying to make uh feeling a<br>feeling that it's not a massive Seaside<br>place as you can see you know this these<br>are each one of them is a is a is an<br>umbrella for uh it's a it's a shadow for<br>uh for the Sun and there is thousands of<br>people and then between the hotels which<br>are also very massive and this massive<br>Seaside place there is now this Arc<br>which is recreating a sort of Nature and<br>naturality<br>and this also has a many Urban uh Urban<br>projects is a project which is very much<br>a long time you have to be very patient<br>if you want to be an architect a newborn<br>planner because you see results but with<br>very long time Santa Catarina is still<br>under construction the neighborhood<br>which I didn't show but it's a it's a<br>big change and this started in 95. and<br>uh half and city started in 2001 and<br>we're still working on it and this<br>started in 2018<br>and so it's quite fast and we started<br>the first part of renaturalization of<br>one of the eight kilometers that we have<br>to<br>re-naturalize but I think it it's a<br>spectacular it's a maybe I don't have<br>images of the street before but the<br>change from what was the very hard limit<br>and now this new natural buffer is is<br>really incredible and here on this<br>buffer you have space for bicycles for<br>people walking for people crossing and<br>going from the hotel to the to the beach<br>to the restaurants at sports of course<br>is absolutely important and and you're<br>really in a kind of a natural<br>environment so this is this is a one of<br>the last projects Remini and we of<br>course have also the design of each<br>detail because it's eight kilometers you<br>have to give identity so each one of the<br>of the a different phases have different<br>colors have tiles in different designs<br>has thematics as a slight you see this<br>this is the Thematic of the sea but also<br>there are other themes like Fellini for<br>example or like the Roman time so you<br>can have this little details explaining<br>you where you are and the colors also<br>giving you the difference from one place<br>to the other and this possibility of of<br>sitting and being more relaxed<br>so let's let's go on we have also some<br>beautiful projects in in Utrecht in<br>the the Scottish parliament of course<br>but it's so long we cannot talk about<br>everything I usually put this photograph<br>of the opening of the Scottish<br>Parliament because I know Sean Connery<br>was in the public so this was great<br>emotion to me and the queen of course<br>the the old queen that now is is<br>historic you know and now we go<br>traveling because this is also our life<br>it's a studio which started at home<br>let's say but started little by little<br>to bring this concept of Home in other<br>places in the world and uh the place<br>which I think it was<br>kind of impossible to me but it was<br>really very very attractive because I<br>was there uh in uh when I was 18 long<br>time ago it was China<br>I did a competition in in China in<br>Shanghai in 2007 because I had this idea<br>that I loved China and I wanted to go<br>back and this was the competition for<br>the Spain Pavilion in Expo Shanghai and<br>we propose them to make a pavilion made<br>of wicker handmade and they thought we<br>were crazy but they said okay well let's<br>try and at the end we could we could<br>arrive to to have this Pavilion covered<br>with more than 8<br>000 wicker panels which were conceived<br>in Spain because Spain has a very strong<br>tradition of the Wicker craft but it was<br>then built in China because the language<br>of The Craft of uh wicker is exactly the<br>same everywhere in the world so in a way<br>I also understood that craft and the<br>Hand work is the same everywhere in the<br>world so humanity is United by hand worm<br>and and this we thought it is fantastic<br>no it's a really a way to make you<br>Humanity communicate we were afraid you<br>know we were in<br>2009 2010 when we were preparing this<br>Pavilion the relationship between China<br>and Spain were not so strong and we<br>didn't even know if we would be able to<br>let them understand how to build it but<br>then we realized that the work of hands<br>it was exactly the same here in Spain<br>and there and and this is a very<br>beautiful other way of being always at<br>home proposing something which is<br>handmade proposing the world of of a<br>craft as a kind of a common language for<br>Humanity and it was surprising I was<br>very afraid never in my life I had been<br>designing something like that with the<br>involvement of of the people crafting<br>each one of this uh weaker panels and a<br>building in Wicker so I was really<br>afraid the risk was very high but at the<br>end it had an incredible effect uh<br>everybody kind of loved it and this was<br>a surprising to me and this was the<br>invitation for us to enter other<br>competitions in China and for example we<br>were invited to design a university<br>now I show you very quickly the images<br>of uh that we created for this<br>University it was three Urban Block in a<br>new part of Shanghai and we were<br>proposing at the very beginning to have<br>a lot of public space between these<br>three Urban blogs and and the public<br>space going underneath going inside so<br>the three Urban blocks were kind of<br>dividing themselves creating spaces for<br>everybody at different levels and and<br>this project was accepted we won the<br>competition unexpectedly and now this is<br>under construction it was uh under<br>construction during covet so we had to<br>look at photographs but when you see<br>here this is three Urban blocks<br>connected at the at the higher level but<br>also connected at Street level so that<br>the street is really taking advantage of<br>this new construction of a new<br>University and and also the uh the<br>people using the universities are taking<br>advantage of new public spaces on top of<br>the streets on top of the classes so<br>that this is a university where you can<br>find Space to meet public spaces on<br>inside and outside in private levels in<br>public levels so that the connections is<br>becoming the main part of the program<br>so now I'm we are looking at this uh<br>design being built in in China because<br>we are like fun away we have been forced<br>to be far away and and we are really<br>looking forward to see life entering in<br>this new University<br>and and maybe becoming something special<br>so I I think we have many images here we<br>are now designing also in Shanghai and<br>new Piazza which will be uh ready soon<br>and and this is also a Piazza which is<br>kind of introducing more nature into the<br>center of Shanghai you know we were<br>introducing this uh idea of the Sea of<br>uh of the the movement of water which is<br>not so far away from from the center of<br>Shanghai but which is very uh very<br>invisible and we were introducing also<br>more nature uh it's a place which will<br>be used for a lot of shows but it's<br>inside of a new artificial nature which<br>is really embedding this new<br>construction in in the center of<br>Shanghai so in a way also like feeling<br>at home for us is<br>introducing nature where everybody all<br>the humanity feels uh more comforted by<br>and and making new Centric places<br>becoming<br>re-naturalized becoming more near to<br>Nature<br>so I don't know if I can this is under<br>construction which we still received we<br>have worked a lot on the on the tiles of<br>course and you can see that it's very<br>special this uh pigmentation which is<br>really recreating the movement of the<br>sea the colors of the sea the colors of<br>the sky into a flat pigmentation<br>so um I think now we can maybe go faster<br>and uh I would bring you to<br>to newer projects<br>uh how much time do you think we have a<br>manfredo<br>oh you just go ahead you just go ahead<br>whenever so in theory we were supposed<br>to do the last part the top was supposed<br>to last for an hour but we will be<br>delighted to see a bit more of your work<br>no not very much more I think I would<br>show you very quickly we are doing a<br>fantastic station in a place which in in<br>France near Paris which was a ghetto so<br>I show you these images of 2005 when<br>this place was burned destroyed people<br>hated it and people were destroying<br>their own homes their own cars and and<br>artists like gr was reacting to this<br>saying of course this is a place where<br>people don't have a face nobody's<br>looking at them so he was making<br>gigantic photos of this Anonymous people<br>and he was putting them gigantic in this<br>cities of Paris or in the destroyed<br>buildings in in the place so here we are<br>designing a station and a station which<br>would like to look a little like<br>this Market Colorful full of different<br>voices full of very ethnical work and<br>the station will be like that so we are<br>involved in this uh in this project<br>which is a project uh of creating a<br>station which again make would like to<br>make people feel as if they are at home<br>with colorful plays light around and uh<br>and a kind of happy feeling that is<br>provoked by this new public building<br>also very fast we are going to design a<br>new station in Naples in a place which<br>is very tough you know it's a also we<br>are specialized in difficult places and<br>it's very nice you know to think that we<br>can do something which will make the<br>place uh be more<br>loving be more friendly be more home and<br>and here in this uh downtown very tough<br>downtown which also never was accepted<br>by people we are doing this new subway<br>station which is a very much talking<br>about nature bringing the wood inside<br>the the the glass and and Iron City and<br>make the inside of the station like a<br>cover Plaza which is uh like a forest in<br>a way it will be very soon looking like<br>a a very natural furnace so there is<br>this contrast between the city uh very<br>tough and the new building which will be<br>more lovable more natural a wooden<br>building and also I think it's very nice<br>to to have this look at the cities now<br>whenever you go around you see the<br>culture and here we have this beautiful<br>culture of pompeias and this uh<br>Hellenistic Roman statues which are<br>beautiful and beauty is also still<br>something which is connecting Humanity<br>not only geographically but also<br>historically we look at this stages of<br>more than 2 000 years ago and they are<br>alive so I think this is also kind of an<br>incredible lesson for for us so to<br>finish I think I would like to<br>Maybe<br>maybe we can<br>talk about a project which is uh<br>well we have a beautiful station a<br>beautiful church but I think I showed<br>you the shirt only only like like an<br>inside it's also about reusing pieces<br>about a lot of wood but much more you<br>know the insertion of Art and this is<br>more than feeling at home let's say you<br>know it's uh it's making a Space which<br>make you feel connected with something<br>even even bigger you know something<br>which you can called God of the Saints<br>your relationship with with the more uh<br>mystical part of yourself so I think<br>this was more than designing a home no<br>it was a very very important and it was<br>uh a very special project but we leave<br>the church and maybe we go to the last<br>project I would like to talk you about<br>and this project uh we start<br>historically you know we start<br>historically it's in Barcelona so it<br>it's easy for you to remember but<br>Barcelona is the place where we live and<br>that in the distance is Sagrada Familia<br>this was 1910 so more than 100 years ago<br>this was Countryside and in this<br>Countryside they decided to build a very<br>special Hospital which which is a crazy<br>hospital it doesn't look like a hospital<br>it looks like a castle it's so beautiful<br>but this man here he was very rich you<br>know he was called paujil and nobody<br>remembers came now but we remember him<br>because of this hospital that he<br>financed but he didn't only finance in<br>the hospital he also said I want this<br>hospital to be the most beautiful place<br>because this Hospital is dedicated to<br>poor people and I would like the poor<br>people to enter here and to forget about<br>their illness and to think this is like<br>heaven I feel here more than at home<br>so this is again this simple concept of<br>feeling at home and there is a lady<br>which you see here her name was Maggie<br>Keswick and here is her husband who was<br>Charles Jenks and Maggie Maggie decided<br>uh while she was suffering cancer that<br>hospitals were not places where you can<br>feel at home there were places where you<br>feel Anonymous where you feel<br>um or<br>nobody where you lose your identity and<br>so she started to have a fantastic<br>simple idea to make places near<br>hospitals where you can feel at home and<br>she had many friends like and the<br>dumaino Frankie<br>Hadid<br>Oma pigeon Park<br>and<br>Rogers and they all accepted to give as<br>a present a project for this new homes<br>next to hospitals this is Foster who is<br>also introducing the possibility to<br>cultivate create the meadow while you're<br>there so this is a fantastic simple idea<br>hospitals are in fact in hospitable<br>places are in fact places where you<br>don't feel at home so let's make a<br>little home next to the hospital where<br>people who suffer cancer can go and can<br>feel simply at home they can also cry<br>there they can have a<br>younger lessons or they can have<br>therapies but the main idea is that they<br>feel at home and they can make a cup of<br>tea so we were designing in this<br>Hospital Sao Paulo hospital by Dominic<br>montaner in Barcelona a new center like<br>this one<br>of course the modernistic architecture<br>was our inspiration and it's about<br>making flowers you know the Gaudi<br>Dominic montaner they were simply trying<br>to make a flower architecture no because<br>nature is something that is really<br>connecting us so they were giving this<br>and we were trying to do the same in<br>this little place here you see this is<br>the old hospital this is the new one and<br>this is the little Center which we are<br>designing with design here and it's of<br>course a little house a little home and<br>its garden and this is kind of making<br>you uh forget about the hospital which<br>is here and open towards the garden and<br>towards the modernistic center which is<br>still a very beautiful<br>scenery and not<br>inhospitable Garden<br>so we go quite fast this is under<br>construction<br>and these are pieces of the uh how we<br>reacted to the modernistic construction<br>we were very simple only one color but<br>we were trying to introduce this<br>lightness that it's very typical of the<br>modernistic architecture and the<br>connection with the garden so from the<br>hospital you have this attractive little<br>house which has an Open Door you enter<br>from the door and you enter in a new<br>world with a garden with a Pergola which<br>covers you where your illness is no<br>not individual problem is you can be<br>yourself and you can talk about it with<br>someone else who is Maybe there find<br>your place inside the little house which<br>is dedicated to make you feel at home<br>and uh open the doors towards the garden<br>relax on the furniture<br>or do nothing at all and this is the<br>function of this place<br>to really make you feel at home so now<br>the garden is totally fantastic<br>and we are going every year that tonight<br>I am going there to celebrate and try to<br>to have more fundraising so that many<br>more of these places can be built around<br>here in Catalunya and Spain<br>so thank you very much I think I talked<br>too much but thank you very much to<br>listen and I'm open to questions if you<br>want<br>uh thank you very much to you and uh I'm<br>delightful and delighted by all the<br>presentation in detail of what we have<br>done in uh relatively uh short period of<br>time uh something that probably uh is<br>interesting to see is uh exactly that<br>particular relation between uh the<br>scales so what we see in all your<br>projects is a very incredible continuity<br>that the design in a way covers between<br>uh so the fact that the molecular<br>dimension of the tectonic of in case of<br>the waving or Shanghai or for other<br>other works I'm thinking for instance<br>that project I think or a couple or<br>years back in Venice which was this sort<br>of what is a really feeling at home and<br>that's a really fitting at home because<br>after you walk for an entire day then<br>I always get very tired when I when I go<br>to these big events and so I I try when<br>I can make an intervention to give<br>benches to give cushions to give places<br>I would say it's interesting because at<br>the same time not just a question of<br>scale in terms of uh you know from the<br>the molecular to the models to say but<br>also in terms of time and there's a<br>particular interest in capturing at the<br>same time a shorty days to test<br>particular ideas or particular<br>techniques like the princess debonado<br>also the expo at the same time on to<br>long-standing projects that everyone<br>said for instance or the public spaces<br>uh you know other places that require<br>much longer processes and much more in<br>much more interesting engaging with<br>different you know transitions they call<br>this policies and of course uh<br>difficulties that arise when projects<br>are done so that's a very interesting<br>aspect because when you talk about the<br>question of establishing relation and<br>rationality so to understand how things<br>are particularly incapable of being<br>captured the Indian type of systems is<br>supposed to be transplanted and<br>understanding how these operation cannot<br>can happen like in the case of Shanghai<br>by intercepting possible possible<br>continuity between differences between<br>differences of uh whatever it is a<br>languages differences of expression<br>differences of paradigms that created<br>these things but at the same time uh<br>similarities that we were saying before<br>allow us to really establish immediate<br>connectivity immediate relation<br>immediate<br>regressionality with all elements with<br>particular elements that become<br>essential that the project so that's<br>something that I would like to hear more<br>unfortunately is getting late now but<br>that also has to do with your interest<br>for the smallest kid for instance you<br>are talking about wood and of course in<br>New Zealand is uh the one of the most<br>important export purpose of wood since<br>poverty Colonial time and I think that<br>logs are probably the third item for<br>Expo exporting New Zealand after daily<br>products like milk and probably meat so<br>we are interested in that particular<br>aspect of how not only because of a<br>question of sustainability but also a<br>question of understanding some<br>specificities and capabilities that are<br>associated to materials and to<br>particular practices of you know<br>embedding them in regulation and in<br>materialities that are at the basis of<br>the industry in case of construction and<br>how you're able there will be in another<br>area or discussion about the different<br>for the following a follow-up of these<br>of the presentation on the smaller scale<br>or the details so I know that you engage<br>a lot with wood also in the design of<br>objects like chairs tables objects in in<br>themselves in some cases unique pieces<br>like the church<br>so is there anything you would like to<br>tell us about the business small scale<br>of your uh I can say engagement with<br>materials<br>I I think I always say that I said in<br>this lecture that the small scale is<br>very useful when you do projects of long<br>term which are very kind of you get<br>bored and to to to energize you know and<br>also to experiment and to and to have<br>this kind of tests as you were saying so<br>for example we we like to do uh small<br>things or exhibitions<br>um or Pavilions many times and I think<br>through that we are learning a lot for<br>example this learning with uh with uh<br>the idea of wood as a very sustainable<br>material<br>we probably learned that through small<br>Pavilions that we were doing and and now<br>we are applying more and more in our big<br>buildings like for example the station<br>in Naples or the Santa Catarina market<br>and most of the of the new architecture<br>that we are doing<br>so I think it's it's really very very<br>nice to have this double scale in the<br>office and now we are also kind of uh<br>proposing some pieces of furniture some<br>lamps some little things because I think<br>it's really it's really kind of a<br>complementary and and it's true no that<br>when you have this desire to design a<br>better environment<br>a big scale you also have the same<br>desire from this moment so I think it's<br>nice and natural to accept that and if<br>you want if you say that wood is a such<br>a fantastic product of New Zealand and<br>you know we were we were participating<br>to competitions called hello wood where<br>you create a wood Pavilion and we are<br>now inventing with the wood uh<br>University the wood section in the<br>University the other activities we could<br>invent something and which would be<br>fantastic<br>spectacular thanks a lot I I think we<br>have covered also the questions that we<br>have in the chat uh and uh one of them<br>is about again home uh from a student<br>that refers to the question of the home<br>in the public space What would be<br>interesting to explore as well I'm<br>thinking for instance at the question of<br>the home and the market and again<br>there'll be a knowledge the last year<br>knowledge in which uh the the the the<br>design of a home design of I think in<br>fact if I don't get I'm not mistaken was<br>a social housing uh a building for<br>social housing a anchors in the space of<br>the street bringing that porosity into<br>the public space so and uh yeah I think<br>that we covered that so I think that for<br>now I guess we have uh also we went also<br>overtime and we can leave it there and<br>thanks a lot<br>thank you very much<br>to see you soon once again yeah sorry<br>we've got um two questions can you have<br>a look at the Q a<br>yeah yeah but I was saying that we<br>covered the question in the discussion<br>okay I guess that uh<br>unless there's a meaning there's a last<br>question which is uh about home and the<br>design process that could be one that<br>possibly before leaving it if you have<br>five minutes we might want to address<br>the colleague Barbers here at the<br>University very much interested in uh in<br>a professional practice and uh uh design<br>process and how the design process is<br>developed<br>through uh from conception to delivery<br>well I I think the design process you've<br>seen a little bit at the studio and it's<br>very important I think to see the studio<br>because it's a it's a studio full of<br>young people and uh um I I feel like<br>Mommy in a way less to everybody in a<br>way I I I think I am the same age of the<br>people I see around me so this is a big<br>help but but it's very lovely to have<br>this<br>process of<br>inventing or doing new new projects<br>always through many different uh aspects<br>you know through maybe models that we<br>are doing and maybe we choose some ways<br>of doing which way not to thought at the<br>beginning so this hand production by<br>different people is very useful to<br>arrive to have new ideas you know to<br>have something that you didn't have in<br>mind before for and and then we are<br>trying our best to develop this first<br>ideas in a way where you don't lose the<br>idea and this is something that I<br>learned next to Eric Morales he was<br>always saying that the project is alive<br>so you don't have to let him die and you<br>let the project die if you don't feed it<br>and the feeding is looking after you<br>know so you you never have to let it<br>abandon and say okay this is just<br>developing if you do that then very<br>possible your project or the main ideas<br>of your project will die so you you have<br>to think that you have to feed it all<br>the time and this is what we are trying<br>it's very it's very challenging because<br>for example when you are doing something<br>for China as I was showing you of course<br>it's this project of feeding was going<br>let's say from one hand to another one<br>and we couldn't be on top no kovid also<br>made a big separation and and this is uh<br>okay this is another way of considering<br>that we have to develop architecture<br>maybe with other means but when we can<br>choose we do exactly as in the last<br>project I showed you which was in<br>Barcelona this talida project from the<br>Maggie centers and uh this this was<br>really from the beginning to the end we<br>were there constantly so you can choose<br>everything all the details the furniture<br>uh the colors of the<br>um of what goes between the bricks and<br>and so on and this is very important<br>respect to the to the process and to the<br>result you would like to have<br>I don't know if I answered<br>I think so fantastic so thanks again<br>thanks for your time and I hope we will<br>have the chance in the future to work<br>together again or to have you here maybe<br>in person or if not that on the virtual<br>again thanks a lot and have a good night</p></main><footer style="margin-top: 2rem; background: #0001; padding: 2rem; text-align: center;"><p>We Are
