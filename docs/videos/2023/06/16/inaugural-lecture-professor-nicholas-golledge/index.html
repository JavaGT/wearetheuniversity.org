event<br>tonight<br>um as you know this is the inaugural<br>lecture by Professor Nicholas golich<br>from now onwards I'm going to call him<br>Nick if you don't mind<br>and this is recognition of what Nick has<br>done in Antarctic Research Center for us<br>at teranga Waka University of Wellington<br>my name is essan here I'm currently<br>provide Chancellor for faculties of<br>science health engineering architecture<br>and design Innovation at University it<br>is my great pleasure to welcome you all<br>here<br>um<br>Nick has been a member of our Academy<br>community<br>since 2009 and he joined Antarctic<br>Research Center as a postdoctoral<br>research fellow and his job was to<br>examine and model the Antarctic ice<br>sheet at that time<br>during this time Nick prolific Works<br>made Global societal environmental<br>impact<br>he focused on the future of the<br>Antarctic underclimate change and try to<br>quantify the likely magnitude of ice<br> loss and how this will contribute<br>to our Rising Seas<br>and I don't think I need to stress how<br>important it is for us all now to see<br>how this is going to continue and the<br>important for the environment<br>his findings have contributed directly<br>to reports from<br>intergovernmental panel on climate<br>change<br>the most recent of which Nick was a lead<br>author on the work that sets the<br>framework for environmental decision<br>making by governments around the world<br>informing many mitigations and<br>adaptation measures<br>additionally he has been invited to<br>contribute to a number of international<br>projects including modeling of the<br>Antarctic response<br>closer to home Nick has developed<br>working relationships with policy makers<br>and ministers including the minister for<br>climate change the honorable James Shaw<br>hosting him at the arc and being hosted<br>at Bowden house delivering the latest<br>from the ice sheets directly to the<br>minister himself<br>he has engaged with the minister for the<br>environment The Honorable David Parker<br>and both the current and former<br>parliamentary commissioner for the<br>environment<br>he communicates his findings and<br>disseminates them directly to the public<br>too and is passionate about engaging<br>with media at National and international<br>levels<br>and he equates the public with the<br>information they need to take action in<br>for his prolific portfolio of research<br>Nick has been well deservedly accoladed<br>he has been awarded the Makai Hammer<br>award by the geosciences Society of New<br>Zealand<br>the hill Tinsley medal by the New<br>Zealand Association of scientists<br>and the research Excellence award from<br>the University<br>he was a key member of the team awarded<br>the 2019 Prime Ministers science prize<br>and His science New Zealand national<br>award<br>and most recently the gulbenkian prize<br>for Humanity as part of his work with<br>ipcc<br>on top of all this Nick continues to<br>make and maintain time to allocate to<br>teaching<br>and supervising more than a dozen<br>postgraduate students over the last 14<br>years and currently leading a group of<br>postdoctoral researchers<br>who are trying to follow his footsteps I<br>don't know whether it's difficult or<br>easy and I hope that many of them are in<br>this willingness to engage in developing<br>new talents and skills for the future<br>has been always greatly appreciated by<br>tonight we have the pleasure of hearing<br>and learning from Nick<br>as he discusses in his inaugural lecture<br>how processes of self-organization<br>enable complexity<br>and despite the laws of physics<br>dictating that chaos and not order<br>should increase over time in our natural<br>world the opposite also Rings true<br>to this end he will examine the patterns<br>of behavior that many natural systems<br>share<br>from plate tectonics to ecological<br>biodiversity the global climate to the<br>beating of our hearts as we search for<br>icolas cage it's my great pleasure and<br>honor to introduce you to the audience<br>foreign<br>now mine am I now my heart am I<br>a very warm welcome to you all this<br>evening it's great to see so many people<br>here<br>um and lots of familiar faces lots of<br>unfamiliar faces so it's uh it's a nice<br>a nice mix certainly a real privilege to<br>be here to give this talk<br>um and to share with you uh some of the<br>things that interest me<br>um<br>we're not going to talk about Antarctica<br>a whole lot but there's lots of other<br>things we'll cover<br>it's a particular Delight for me this<br>evening that my family are here<br>um I don't often get to share what I do<br>um with with uh with my family they<br>don't get to see me in a work context<br>very much so it's great that they could<br>be here tonight so if I have one kind of<br>aim for this evening<br>um<br>it's not only to interest you all in<br>what I'm doing but to try and avoid this<br>so it's a humble aim uh 45 minutes to<br>get through this and we'll see where we<br>end up on the other side<br>so my career I've been doing kind of<br>earth science and so on for about 26<br>years<br>and over that time I've probably given<br>quite a lot of talks I haven't counted<br>them but I'm guessing it's probably been<br>a few hundred<br>um<br>and nearly all of those talks have been<br>about mud rocks ice climate something<br>like that<br>but tonight I wanted to talk about<br>something different I wanted to talk<br>about life<br>and we'll get to the climate and<br>possibly the mud<br>now life of course is a concept we're<br>all familiar with<br>um if you're not then something to watch<br>for<br>but it's a really difficult thing to try<br>and Define<br>and if we do try and Define it actually<br>most of the time what we end up doing is<br>just describing it we end up describing<br>um sort of characteristics of life<br>signatures of life<br>it's quite an easy thing to describe but<br>not an easy thing to Define<br>and it gets more difficult if we try and<br>quantify life so if we actually try and<br>put numbers to to what life is it it's<br>quite a tricky thing<br>now I like this because it means we've<br>got lots of latitude to play around with<br>some ideas and it gives us some some<br>scope for thinking about<br>um interesting things<br>but I think for many of us<br>um as as as humans as as mammals one of<br>the most emblematic things when we think<br>about life is to think about the heart a<br>beating heart<br>so I have a video here um it's of a<br>beating heart if you are going to be a<br>little sensitive to that feel free to to<br>look away it's only about 30 seconds<br>long<br>um I'll tell you when it's when it's<br>finished<br>but it's an interesting one<br>so here we have the emblem of life we<br>have a heart beating<br>but this heart isn't where it should be<br>right it's not in our body it's in a<br>plastic box<br>so we have to sort of finish the video<br>there it's basically just more of the<br>same<br>um<br>as you would expect right<br>so I have this this kind of slightly<br>strange Paradox right we have a heart<br>that's beating but it's not in a body<br>so where does the life reside does the<br>life reside in the body does it reside<br>in the heart does it reside maybe in the<br>cells of the heart<br>so we have this sort of this possibility<br>that life can reside in different places<br>and this is a little bit of a sort of<br>contrived um philosophical digression<br>but it's worth exploring this because<br>what I'm getting at here is what I've<br>put here in the in the title that life<br>doesn't really reside in any one place<br>like that the life that we that we<br>describe that we try and sort of measure<br>or try and understand is an emergent<br>product right it's an emergent<br>phenomenon it's something that comes<br>from the totality of all these<br>individual things just um we we could<br>say that certain cells are alive and and<br>that would be true but it's really<br>um the cells working in the heart and<br>the Heart being in the body with all the<br>other parts of us that makes us alive<br>so we can see that the heart is a part<br>of a much bigger system and that's kind<br>of really what I wanted to get at with<br>that example<br>now I said that life was difficult to<br>quantify but we can measure signatures<br>of of life so this graph here<br>um is just showing you the uh basically<br>it's a measure of the electrical current<br>in a cluster of cells in the Sino actual<br>node so this is in the upper right<br>atrium of the heart this basically what<br>what's known as the pacemaker of the<br>heart pacemaker cells<br>now you don't need too much of a<br>background in in heart physiology to<br>sort of bitter sea that this is<br>um quite a distinctive waveform okay so<br>what we're seeing here is one aspect of<br>a heartbeat and it's characterized by<br>hopefully you can see the colored bars<br>in the background we see the green bar<br>there's marking the peak of each of<br>these waves and then we see a period of<br>Rapid drop in this case the gray bar and<br>then the blue shows a period where<br>um the the charge in this case is<br>declining more slowly and then the the<br>ready Brown bar shows when it IT bounces<br>back up and that that sort of pattern<br>repeats over and over again<br>and we can simulate that quite easily<br>with a very simple model okay so we can<br>take a simple equation we can simulate<br>that behavior now what we're not doing<br>is we're not simulating the processes in<br>the heart what we're doing is we're<br>saying can we simulate a waveform this<br>is just purely a mathematical equation<br>that just gives us a waveform<br>now that's important because you know<br>this is a distinctive waveform it's not<br>like the sinusoidal pattern that you<br>would expect from the you know the rise<br>and fall of the the daily tides um or<br>the rise and setting of the sun which<br>would follow a very smooth Peak and<br>decline this is a very asymmetric<br>waveform right so it's a very abrupt<br>rise and then a steep drop a slower drop<br>and then another very abrupt rise it's<br>an asymmetric wave and we'll come back<br>to that throughout this this talk<br>Okay so we've got a model we've got um a<br>simple mathematical approximation of<br>that behavior and that's all we're<br>trying to do just get an approximation<br>of the behavior<br>now that is evolving over several<br>hundred milliseconds but we can take the<br>exact same calculation and we can allow<br>it to evolve over hundreds of thousands<br>of years<br>and we can add noise to the system we<br>can add natural variability to it so we<br>can simulate what would happen in a<br>system that's maybe less well<br>constrained than the heart something<br>that's like the global climate that is<br>affected by many many other things so we<br>can see we've got the same asymmetric<br>waveform here it's evolving over<br>hundreds of thousands of years and if we<br>compare that to something like the ice<br>core records that tell us about global<br>air temperature we can see that it<br>captures the same basic shape it doesn't<br>capture all the variability because it's<br>not intended to it's too simple to do<br>that but it's capturing the same basic<br>shape<br>and we can go a step further because we<br>can actually look at how something like<br>carbon dioxide in the atmosphere has<br>changed over the last 500 million years<br>and again we can apply the same model<br>and drop that on and say that's pretty<br>good correspondence<br>now the point of showing this isn't<br>um to suggest that these different<br>aspects of of the climate behave in<br>exactly the same way as the heart of<br>course there are very different things<br>controlling them all<br>but the point is to say that<br>the heart is a very easy system to to<br>measure and model and we can understand<br>it by putting it in a box and prodding<br>and poking and doing all sorts of things<br>to it we can't do that with the climate<br>system it evolves over a much too<br>greater scale in in space but also in<br>time we can't sit there and measure it<br>and and so on for hundreds of thousands<br>of years<br>so by translating the behavior of<br>something that we can understand very<br>easily onto something that's very hard<br>to understand we can learn something<br>about the Dynamics of that system<br>So to that end we can look at how a<br>heart works and I've sort of called it a<br>leaky bucket here it's not suggesting<br>that the heart is leaking that would be<br>that would be a problem<br>um but it's coming back to the<br>sinoatrial node cells apparently if you<br>take the cells out of the heart those<br>particular cells you can put them in a<br>Petri dish and they'll still generate<br>spontaneously generate this charge<br>but the thing is if all those cells just<br>generated a charge a little pulse of<br>electricity<br>kind of randomly then they wouldn't<br>trigger this this<br>um effective uh pulse of the heart there<br>wouldn't be able to coordinate<br>themselves<br>um to to sort of produce a single pulse<br>of of energy so what happens is that as<br>they generate this charge they build up<br>their their total charge kind of rapidly<br>to start with and then at the rate slows<br>down it's a bit like charging a battery<br>anyone with an electric car will know<br>the the problem of charging very quickly<br>to start with you hit 80 and then all of<br>a sudden it takes forever it's very much<br>the same with these these um these heart<br>cells so they're charging up and then<br>they go through this period where<br>they're they're slowing down<br>now the value in that is that it allows<br>neighboring cells who are maybe on a<br>slightly different schedule it allows<br>them to catch up now bit by bit this<br>allows the whole cluster of tens of<br>thousands of cells to get to the same<br>critical State because what's happening<br>is that once the charge reaches a<br>threshold it's triggered to release that<br>that charge now if one cell releases the<br>charge and the others aren't ready it<br>just Fizzles out it doesn't go anywhere<br>what we need is a sustained reaction<br>kind of like when a nuclear reactor<br>reaches that point of criticality where<br>it propagates a change from from one<br>thing to the next<br>so that's what we're looking for here<br>and that's what the heart does it<br>reaches this critical state by allowing<br>others to catch up<br>and by doing that it entrains the entire<br>body and from that point on those cells<br>are then synchronized and they can<br>produce this coherent pulse SO waiting<br>so I've got another animation here this<br>is um<br>simple system okay so this is um<br>what we call a sand pile model but it's<br>a it's a computer version of a sampire<br>model so imagine you have a traditional<br>hourglass full of sand and you tip it<br>upside down<br>and you watch The Sound Running Out of<br>the middle and it's piling up sand<br>underneath and as that sand pile gets<br>bigger and bigger it then collapses at<br>Avalanches because it gets unstable so<br>that's what we're doing here with this<br>with this um this model<br>and you'll see when I play it um<br>what happens now the thing to bear in<br>mind before I start this thing to bear<br>in mind is that all we're doing in this<br>is we're adding one grain of sand one<br>digital grain of sand to the very<br>Central cell in this grid so the very<br>Central Point and we're doing that over<br>and over again but we're doing it<br>exactly the same time we're doing it one<br>one grain every time step and we run it<br>for ten thousand time steps so it's a<br>now what you see here is that the the<br>the the sand pile is growing quite<br>quickly to start with because we're<br>adding material to the to the central<br>cell and as it builds up to a threshold<br>and we allow it to collapse then it<br>spreads to the neighboring cells and<br>then of course as they build up then<br>they collapse and they spread to the<br>neighboring cells and so over time it<br>very quickly sort of spreads out you can<br>imagine this is kind of like the way<br>that a lichen grows on a rock or<br>something like that<br>now the colors of this are basically<br>showing you the heights of the um that<br>pile of sand grains so as it gets bigger<br>we have a different color from when it's<br>uh when it's when it's much lower<br>now because it's a very geometric and<br>regular model it's producing very pretty<br>shapes to look at but what you're also<br>seeing is these waves of restructuring<br>and what you're hopefully beginning to<br>see now as this system is getting more<br>complicated you're seeing these waves of<br>reorganization sweeping across the<br>domain<br>now as we let this run<br>I won't let it run for too long because<br>it goes on for quite a while<br>um but as we watch this the state of<br>complexity of this system is always<br>increasing all right because we're<br>always adding more material<br>and so that gives the system more<br>possibility it's more opportunities<br>and so the complexity of the system is<br>increasing and the reorganizations that<br>take place are also getting more complex<br>we eventually get to a point where the<br>the reorganizations kind of sweep<br>backwards and forwards across the the<br>whole system<br>but the other thing to notice is that<br>the time between those reorganizations<br>is also increasing<br>so we that was a really good one<br>we see lots of little kind of collapse<br>events but we don't see that many big<br>collapse events<br>and that's quite an interesting<br>interesting things we could talk about<br>Behavior but the physicists won't let us<br>we have to talk about um<br>uh structural Dynamics I think because<br>this isn't Behavior as such<br>let's just let's just let's just stop<br>that<br>now from that simulation from that model<br>all I've done here is I've taken the<br>average of those Heights the things that<br>were shown in the in the colors every<br>cell that had digital sound on it I've<br>taken the height of those cells and have<br>averaged them<br>and that's what this green line shows so<br>on the top panel here we're seeing the<br>whole evolution of that system over ten<br>thousand steps now to start with you can<br>see there's lots of variability in that<br>average because it's building up there's<br>only a few cells to start with so it<br>builds up and then it collapses it<br>builds up collapses lots of variability<br>over a short period of time<br>and that's what gives us panel B<br>underneath a very symmetric or near<br>symmetric oscillation okay so there's<br>very few parts in the system at this<br>point and they build up and then they<br>collapse But as time goes on is that the<br>complexity of the system increases we<br>start getting a more asymmetric waveform<br>and by the end we've got a very<br>asymmetric waveform<br>now this is reminiscent of course what<br>we saw in the climate records what we<br>saw in the heart behavior it doesn't<br>really matter that these waves are going<br>up rather than down it just depends on<br>whether you're looking at the forcing or<br>the response but the the key Point here<br>is that it's asymmetric that's all I<br>want to really sort of get across here<br>now when we think about the way natural<br>systems work<br>um we're not working in a void people<br>have been trying to figure this stuff<br>out for a remarkably long time<br>um one of my favorite people is switch<br>off Capra he's a physicist he's written<br>a lot of books over the years he's quite<br>elderly now<br>um he's written an amazing number of<br>books that all have tremendous insight<br>but in one of them he he sort of tries<br>to break down natural systems and<br>um not just living systems but any<br>system really<br>into these three things he has sort of<br>process form and matter<br>he says as long as you've got those<br>three constituents you can have a system<br>that that works that does something<br>and so he sort of describes these um<br>these different components and he talks<br>about Mata um you've got to have a<br>material in this system that allows<br>energy to flow through it it has to be a<br>dissipative material and that allows the<br>system to evolve to a point that is far<br>from equilibrium so this is something<br>that is maybe distinct from<br>you know if you think of like the guy on<br>a hypothesis of James Lovelock and Lynn<br>margulis in the 1970s and published the<br>year I was born actually<br>um now they were arguing for stability<br>and homeostasis was actually a word that<br>they used<br>but this is a system that's quite<br>different it's actually saying these<br>things are being pushed away from what<br>they want to be they're not trying to<br>find balance they're they're trying to<br>find a state that is<br>um maybe a steady state but it's far<br>from from equilibrium<br>and through doing that this system uses<br>that energy to organize itself in a way<br>that can affect structural change and he<br>refers to this as a a cognitive cycle he<br>talks about this sort of cognitive<br>process cognitive adaptation so it's not<br>the same as Consciousness he's not<br>arguing for for that he's basically<br>saying this is a learning process<br>now I'm sort of yeah a decade or more<br>later and Jeremy England's came along<br>and um<br>came up with a very similar sort of idea<br>but he he didn't really mention Capra at<br>all but the difference with England's<br>work he was coming at it from a<br>nanotechnology perspective<br>um he's now head of AI at glaxosmith<br>client so he's he's um he's a pretty<br>smart cookie<br>but what he did was he he sort of<br>organized this system into into a<br>distinct sort of process so he turned<br>this sort of triangle into a into a into<br>a triangular Circle let's say but the<br>way he imagined it was that all these<br>systems rely on a drive of energy right<br>so you put a drive of energy into a<br>system and then it flows through the<br>system it has to be dissipated<br>and the way that the material and the<br>structure of that system use the energy<br>is basically affected by and goes on to<br>effect the the efficiency of the system<br>as a whole so it's using a drive of<br>energy to change its form and by doing<br>that it aligns itself better with that<br>flow of energy<br>now that all sounds a bit too confusing<br>um I've got one more video<br>um<br>this one I is one of my favorites it's<br>pretty short<br>um<br>but it really captures the essence of<br>what you can do with a simple Drive okay<br>so by drive we mean flow of energy<br>now what you're going to see in this<br>video all being well<br>is a flow of energy that goes from The<br>Ring electrode which is this thing<br>coming down from the the top of the<br>screen sorry that's the source electrode<br>and so that's kind of suspended above<br>this dish and in the petri dish we've<br>got a ring electrode around the around<br>the bottom so it's just a metal ring<br>now those two aren't physically<br>connected of course the electricity<br>that's being pushed into that Source<br>electrode has to jump through the air to<br>and what it does is quite interesting<br>this the power going into this Source<br>electrode increases from zero to thirty<br>thousand volts so they're not messing<br>around<br>and you'll see gradually these ball<br>bearings are now beginning to move<br>they're in some sort of viscous oil they<br>began to move around they're responding<br>to that electromagnetic field<br>essentially in the air<br>now gradually as they move they're<br>affecting they're influencing the uh the<br>electrical field in the air around them<br>so the ball bearings next to them are<br>also influenced by that so gradually bit<br>by bit they actually affect them each<br>other in such a way as they organize<br>themselves into a straight line but then<br>if you watch very closely something kind<br>of cool happens because they don't just<br>sit there<br>Isn't that cool<br>and it doesn't stop it's just it just<br>keeps moving it's it it it finds this<br>beautiful arrangement where it can tap<br>into that flow of energy that flow of<br>electricity but it Carries On Moving<br>it's continually seeking some sort of um<br>Improvement it's looking for other other<br>ways that it can improve its efficiency<br>and the authors of this paper note that<br>it it it develops what they refer to as<br>life-like structural lifelike behavior<br>in fact they do other experiments where<br>they break these these trees into pieces<br>and they actually reform so they talk<br>about this healing process so this to me<br>is a perfect example of having a very<br>very simple system it couldn't get much<br>more simple and yet it develops<br>behaviors that are life-like so it comes<br>back to how we started this this talk<br>thinking about what really is life<br>is life this dual thing is it this<br>binary state of living and not living or<br>is it actually a Continuum where we have<br>something that can go from being<br>non-living to then developing life-like<br>behaviors and then becoming maybe<br>minimally living and then fully living<br>that's an interesting question to ponder<br>um but it it makes you wonder you know<br>if if the world was just full of ball<br>bearings and you had electric Fields all<br>over the place you could probably<br>develop<br>um some very complex interactions just<br>so when we think about life we have to<br>sort of reframe our expectations and<br>think well life and life-like Behavior<br>aren't just about things that we say are<br>biological there can be lifelike<br>behaviors in many different things and<br>trying to find the point at which they<br>become living<br>becomes even harder to to decide than it<br>was when we started<br>but I think there are sort of three<br>components that we can identify that all<br>living systems have so these would be<br>the things that a system might aspire to<br>have if you like and everyone from<br>Darwin to Dawkins has come up with some<br>sort of form of these but<br>essentially we need to have some sort of<br>memory we need to have some way of<br>retaining what's happened before<br>and so in many cases you could say that<br>whatever the shape or structure of a<br>system at the point You observe it that<br>is its memory of what's happened to it<br>before it's encoded in its in its form<br>now as that undergoes changes and is<br>exposed to other influences<br>it needs to have a way to lock in the<br>changes that are advantageous okay so we<br>need to have some irreversibility in the<br>process<br>and once we've done that we then have<br>something that's different from what we<br>started with so we then we have the<br>option that we can assemble it we can<br>combine it with different permutations<br>so we're combining Innovations and so by<br>going through this process where we have<br>these three components we can build a<br>living system<br>and there's something else that I think<br>sits behind all this<br>essentially what's happening in all<br>these things is that we're going from<br>something that was essentially quite<br>passive to start with to something that<br>was much more active okay we've gone<br>from something that's just purely a<br>structure that encodes memory of what<br>happened previously towards something<br>that is now assembling and trying to<br>create something new it's a very active<br>kind of form we're going from something<br>that was simple to something that is<br>much more complex it's lots more moving<br>Parts lots more opportunities for<br>Innovation and the reason I think that<br>that's important is because<br>the key thing for me about life is not<br>so much the things that we measure<br>it's really about the fact that<br>like becoming alive we find agency we<br>have independence from the energy that<br>is driving us<br>okay and that means that we are then<br>separated in some way from the forces<br>that are pushing on us okay so if you're<br>a rock in a river you're just pushed on<br>by the river you go where the river<br>wants you to go<br>but if you're um a system that can store<br>up energy over a period of time and<br>build it up like those heart cells to a<br>point where you can then release it all<br>very quickly you can do a lot more work<br>it's a lot more efficient so it gives<br>so we've already seen the heart we've<br>already seen the global climate what are<br>the systems behave like this well we<br>could look at plate tectonics we know<br>that the early Earth this is based on<br>computer simulations but essentially<br>what's happening is as the as the plate<br>plate tectonic system developed it<br>became a self-organizing system it<br>rotated in ways that followed this sort<br>of Sawtooth pattern<br>we can look at life on Earth we can look<br>at the way that species co-occurrence<br>change through time and again we follow<br>the same Sawtooth pattern so these<br>Sawtooth patterns come up quite a lot<br>and they seem to reflect systems that<br>build up slowly and then change suddenly<br>and that seems to be reflective of this<br>idea of absorbing a drive of energy and<br>then releasing it like quickly<br>now the thing about life we could see<br>that Sawtooth pattern over geological<br>time but if we take a snapshot of life<br>in this case marine life and we look at<br>the way that it's distributed according<br>to its its range of sizes we end up with<br>something like this this is a fairly<br>colorful plot but it's basically showing<br>a straight line<br>now the caution here is that this is on<br>two logarithmic axes rather than<br>arithmetic axes okay so each major<br>division on the horizontal and the<br>vertical scale is 10 times the last one<br>okay<br>now we do this because it it makes it<br>clearer to see these patterns but what<br>we're seeing here is the the number of<br>individuals within a particular class of<br>sizes and you can see that they follow<br>this beautiful distribution across 25<br>orders of magnitude<br>this is what we refer to as scale in<br>variance this is a power law<br>relationship<br>now the interesting thing about that is<br>we see it in lots of other things we see<br>it in the way that earthquakes are<br>organized we see it at the scale of the<br>iron channels in heart cells all right<br>so the the ion channels are what lets<br>calcium sodium potassium ions in and out<br>of the cell membrane<br>we see it in the way that ice sheets<br>flow the way that climate changes and we<br>see it of course in in brain activity<br>that's a well-known<br>for this exhibiting these power law<br>relationships so yeah why is any of this<br>important well all this all these<br>systems that are showing those power<br>laws are organized they've basically<br>developed some sort of hierarchy where<br>there are lots of a very small entity<br>and very few of a very large entity<br>and that suggests that there's some<br>process some invisible hand if you like<br>that's organizing that system to that<br>state<br>why would it do that why why does any of<br>that matter well the point is when you<br>have a system that is organized like<br>that it dissipates energy more<br>efficiently okay so it allows you to<br>transmit information more effectively so<br>this is what's happening in the brain<br>the brain Builds on the Fly it's<br>continually building<br>um these these scaling variant networks<br>between neurons and then they're<br>collapsing through avalanches and<br>rebuilding in another way and it does<br>that so that it can be at the edge of<br>chaos or a close to the edge of chaos as<br>much of the time as possible because<br>that's where Peak information flow<br>occurs<br>and by doing that over and over again we<br>allow ourselves to go through these<br>restructuring Cycles so we're going<br>through this cognitive cycle we're going<br>through a process of learning an<br>adaptation<br>and it doesn't really matter where we<br>look<br>um whether it's in the the neurons in<br>the brain or in the electromagnetic<br>um<br>energy in the cosmos we see the same<br>patterns of organization and it all<br>comes from this<br>self-organization the synchronization of<br>individual elements and it comes from<br>now it's one thing to say oh well<br>everything in the natural world kind of<br>follows these behaviors what about us we<br>sort of<br>perhaps a little arrogantly think that<br>you know as humans we've sort of<br>detached ourselves removed ourselves<br>slightly from the natural Order of<br>Things<br>maybe not so you know the way that we<br>send emails follows what's called bursty<br>Behavior<br>I mean we can all sympathize with that<br>right you know one day you're firing off<br>hundreds of minutes or weeks before you<br>get right around to doing any more but<br>the way we compose music patterns in<br>music are also um correspond to these<br>power law relationships the way that we<br>wage Wars or drive our cars through the<br>city they all seem to follow these<br>patterns and it's not because we are<br>individually trying to conform to a<br>pattern we're looking at this the<br>statistics of the the total population<br>of these things so something is<br>producing these behaviors and this nice<br>paper from barabasi suggests that it's a<br>generic feature of human dynamics<br>something that's a consequence of cueing<br>so you can think again about that<br>waiting concept<br>now these days you can't go anywhere<br>without hearing about large language<br>models and chat GPT so I thought I'd<br>throw in this example because language<br>follows the same thing if you rank the<br>occurrence of words and the number of<br>times that might occur in a document you<br>see a power law relationship and this is<br>exactly how things like chat GPT work<br>they build sentences incrementally<br>saying well what is the most likely word<br>to come after this word let's look at<br>billions of documents and rank the<br>number of rank the words count the<br>number of them and then say well this<br>one is the most likely one to follow<br>but they don't just stop at that they<br>add a bit of Randomness because<br>obviously if you just took the top pick<br>you know your top hit on the Google<br>search it's not necessarily always going<br>to be very interesting you might end up<br>in the same place over and over again it<br>gets a bit formulaic<br>so what chat GPT and other models are<br>doing is that they're adding a random<br>element so they're saying well let's<br>have a look at maybe the third one or<br>the fifth one and we can change that we<br>can change how much Randomness we put in<br>there but the point of showing this is<br>that when we have a system that is well<br>organized like this<br>and we can understand the statistics of<br>the system it allows us this possibility<br>of prediction and I think that's a key<br>thing<br>okay so we're going to extend we're<br>almost almost going to wrap this up but<br>we're going to extend into one other<br>realm of these these organizing systems<br>because the key thing about a lot of<br>these systems again we can see that<br>power law relationship there on the left<br>hand side but this is coming from a<br>network in this case this is a network<br>of artists okay so these are famous<br>artists and their students who have also<br>then gone on to be famous artists or<br>maybe less famous artists and then had<br>more students and and so on so you can<br>see the artists like Rembrandt very big<br>node there big bulb of yellow lots of<br>students of course and many of them went<br>on to be great artists in their own<br>right so we can build networks of almost<br>anything because the internet is a great<br>example we see nodes that have<br>connections to other nodes and those<br>edges those those connections Define the<br>structure of that Network now the<br>interesting thing is that once we sort<br>of appreciate that<br>we can see that actually the the<br>behavior of that Network the behavior of<br>a system relies on the way those nodes<br>and edges are sort of organized and so<br>we can use that we can restructure a<br>network to affect change if we know what<br>we're doing<br>so that last point there the evolution<br>of natural and social systems can be<br>directed by the connections we make so<br>again it comes back to this idea of<br>agency that if we understand the systems<br>and we understand the connections we can<br>change how things can evolve in the<br>future<br>so this is my wrapping up now this is my<br>thesis essentially<br>that through time and growth of a system<br>we have increasing complexity<br>and the value of increasing complexity<br>is that it allows a system to exhibit a<br>decoupled response it allows a system to<br>behave essentially independently of the<br>it relies on waiting because without<br>waiting it's going to struggle to<br>organize<br>and through waiting we get<br>synchronization through synchronization<br>we get a coordinated response and that<br>allows effective change<br>and all that relies on the network<br>architecture it relies on all the things<br>being connected together and changing<br>that Network evolving that Network<br>allows the system to evolve so when we<br>bring all that together and think about<br>this invisible hand that whatever it is<br>this this magic something that sort of<br>ties all these things together<br>we've got to think well we organize<br>ourselves into networks we do it all the<br>time social networks work networks<br>there's all manner of different Networks<br>but we we have the opportunity now to<br>reflect on the way that we build those<br>networks and rather than doing it<br>passively saying well we're just part of<br>a bigger system we can actually do it<br>more consciously and think well am I<br>building the network that is most<br>appropriate for the energy that's um<br>that's flowing through it<br>if we're operating like all living<br>systems in a state that is far from<br>equilibrium what does that mean in terms<br>of our ability to adapt and change can<br>we rapidly change I mean these systems<br>that I've talked about are operating<br>close to that edge of chaos so they're<br>operating at a point where they should<br>be able to switch and change very very<br>quickly<br>now what is it in our human nature that<br>stops US doing that when we know we need<br>to<br>and what we do know from all these<br>systems is that no matter what's<br>happening it's going to happen again<br>these systems go through Cycles<br>repetitive cycles of restructuring and<br>growth but the key thing that I've<br>underlined here is learning we've got to<br>learn from those those repeating Cycles<br>so through all that I would say that<br>the way that these systems evolve us<br>included<br>it is a way that gives us agency it<br>gives us an independence and a mechanism<br>to basically choose our own destiny if<br>you want to see it that way and we can<br>do that because as hopefully intelligent<br>conscious beings we have the ability to<br>predict the future we can look at the<br>way other systems are working we can<br>look at systems maybe like the climate<br>maybe like biodiversity we can see that<br>they are restructuring right now<br>and we can say well is that a good thing<br>we can predict what's going to happen<br>next<br>and the last one their purpose if we can<br>see what's going to happen next it means<br>we have a purpose we have a meaning we<br>have something to do we have to decide<br>consciously is that what we want to<br>happen or do we want maybe to try and<br>so<br>I hope you've enjoyed at least some of<br>that I hope it wasn't too esoteric<br>I do have a lot of thank yous um<br>thank you all for being here and and<br>coming along this evening to listen to<br>this talk<br>um I want to thank Kylie wherever she is<br>for organizing and doing all the the<br>organization here this evening<br>um I'd like to thank issan for<br>um supporting myself in my own promotion<br>application actually two and a half<br>years ago now it's been a bit delayed<br>because of because of covet<br>um but yeah isan's been a big supporter<br>of everything we've done in our group so<br>a huge thank you there<br>great to see so many friends and and<br>colleagues here in IEM I'm not going to<br>name everybody at the Antarctic Research<br>Center but I do want to acknowledge that<br>everyone there has been absolutely<br>tremendous and a huge support in in my<br>work over the 14 years that I've been<br>there it really is like a second family<br>to me and it's it's really humbling for<br>me when I go into work in the morning to<br>be surrounded and continually reminded<br>that I'm surrounded by people who are<br>doing absolutely incredible work<br>um not just in the the sort of science<br>that I'm familiar with but in a lot of<br>the scientific fields that I'm not<br>familiar with but also the professional<br>staff the engineering team they're all<br>doing incredible stuff and you know I'm<br>just constantly in awe and of course we<br>sit in an ecosystem that is also<br>includes other departments in the<br>University other schools other Cris<br>there's a huge number of people involved<br>in in the work that we do and of course<br>we couldn't do any any of it without the<br>funding and Logistics and all the<br>support that we get from other places<br>most of all I have to thank these guys<br>they're going to cringe at me putting<br>this photo up<br>um<br>but really without them none of this<br>would happen they're the ones that that<br>keep things going when the wheels fall<br>off they're the ones that pick me up<br>when I need a bit of a boost and uh<br>they're the reason that it all happens<br>so a huge thank you to them<br>and I hope that at the end of this I<br>haven't disgraced myself<br>it's been a big concern<br>um if you're not familiar with this<br>quote<br>um<br>the father in question was uh<br>a fairly well-known medical doctor<br>and he made a couple of important<br>discoveries<br>but his son<br>actually transformed the way that we<br>understand science so he didn't do too<br>Okay so<br>that's all for me I hope those of you<br>that came for the science I didn't feel<br>like there was too much philosophy in<br>there<br>I hope if you came for the philosophy<br>you didn't feel there was too much<br>science<br>if you just came for the free drinks and<br>you don't have too long to wait because<br>I'll be coming up soon<br>um but no matter what you came for thank<br>you and I hope you've enjoyed it if you<br>if you have enjoyed it and you want to<br>read more<br>there's a book<br>coming out soon in a few months time<br>um so please jump onto your favorite<br>internet book agent and put in a<br>pre-order if you want to<br>feel free to grab me for questions<br>afterwards<br>um it's been a pleasure to talk to you<br>this evening I hope you've enjoyed it<br>thank you very much<br>I'm Rob Makai I'm the director of tipuna<br>patiotia the Antarctic Research Center<br>and it's my honor and privilege to give<br>a voter thanks to Nick for that that<br>talk it was um<br>I've got wonderful here but it was<br>really quite incredible to be honest um<br>it wasn't what I expected I had these<br>notes given to me and I was like he does<br>ice sheet modeling but he does a lot<br>more modeling than that so um<br>yeah just also just emphasize that Nick<br>is a real leader in our group you know<br>he has been fundamental in developing a<br>whole new ecosystem in the type of<br>research that we've done in the<br>Antarctic Research Center so has<br>revolutionized ice sheep modeling and<br>has now developed this National modeling<br>Hub that includes researchers from all<br>over Wellington as well as New Zealand<br>and there's some partnership with gns<br>science and niwa who are important<br>important Partners in the work we do<br>our next week focuses primarily on<br>understanding how the Earth system<br>processes work particularly in the<br>context of climate change so um you know<br>he has really fundamentally<br>revolutionized our understanding of what<br>the Antarctica contributions will be to<br>Future sea level rise and as a globally<br>internationally recognized expert in<br>this um<br>so not just New Zealand but every<br>country around the world that has an<br>exposure to coastline is it's really<br>dependent on some of the fundamental<br>work that he's doing to adapt to Future<br>climate change<br>so tonight Nick threw a couple in and<br>described the ways that different<br>systems work<br>you know both physical and biological<br>and how they all sort of display this<br>really quite similar pattern of um<br>behavior and so how can these easily<br>observable systems teach us about you<br>know quite more complex systems and yeah<br>it was very thought provoking I have a<br>few questions where<br>um so these similarities between natural<br>systems you know going from plate<br>tectonics biodiversity global climate<br>and uh Beating Heart In A Box<br>um you know they really do allow us to<br>understand the networks and systems that<br>we're all part of and how they interact<br>and surprisingly predictable ways<br>you know but I appreciating these roles<br>that these processes play if we can more<br>clearly see the consequences of any<br>disruption to these systems for example<br>the context of climate change and<br>biodiversity<br>so we've only seen a glimpse tonight of<br>what Professor golage's passion for the<br>intersection of science philosophy and<br>the Arts are this interdisciplinary<br>approach is the kind of vision that as a<br>and you know I've got notes here to say<br>I couldn't close without the book but<br>Nick sort of beat me to it so he's he's<br>really obviously interested in people<br>buying it but I think he's he's more<br>interested really in how people relate<br>to these ideas I mean this is you know<br>something that I wasn't expecting to see<br>tonight and I'd probably have to read it<br>three or four times over to really get<br>the level of understanding and thought<br>that Knicks put into that it's a very<br>impressive piece of work<br>so Nick it's my pleasure to recognize<br>you for what was a really fantastic<br>lecture and also just acknowledge your<br>family as well so um you know it's not<br>easy being married to a scientist that<br>gets a little bit obsessed about ideas<br>and particularly around Order and Chaos<br>um<br>and particularly when they're Antarctic<br>scientists and go away for several<br>months a year so just yeah acknowledge<br>you there<br>um so finally last thank you we'll be<br>going out the doors there to have some<br>refreshments in the common room soon but<br>just firstly just one more round of um<br>thanks and Applause for the next talk</p></main><footer style="margin-top: 2rem; background: #0001; padding: 2rem; text-align: center;"><p>We Are The University</p><ul style="list-style-type: none; padding: 0; margin: 0;"><li><a
