all to this special occasion<br>to celebrate James Usher's promotion to<br>Professor<br>um it's always good to take time out of<br>our busy life to listen to our amazing<br>staff and broaden our understanding of<br>the research that goes on across the<br>University<br>and I'd like to welcome colleagues from<br>across the university as well as<br>students and Friends of James but I'd<br>like to give a very special welcome to<br>his family especially his mum Christine<br>father-in-law James Irwin wife Andrea<br>and children Samuel Jack and Alice<br>now as you know James is an immunologist<br>and clinical microbiologist who divides<br>his time between the university and the<br>southern Community labs I suspect that<br>many of us have seen James in the media<br>over the last three years as he's lived<br>as we've all lived through the covert<br>pandemic<br>in response to the covid-19 pandemic he<br>led co-led the establishment of the<br>vaccine Alliance at Terra New Zealand a<br>multi-institutional team of researchers<br>and Industry focused on Building New<br>Zealand's capability and platforms for<br>vaccine development<br>he was a member also of the government's<br>covid-19 task vaccine task force and a<br>member of the covid-19 vaccine technical<br>Advisory Group<br>now in a moment Professor Elizabeth<br>Smith the dean of the school of medical<br>Sciences will provide a formal<br>introduction to Professor Usher but I'd<br>like to provide a few personal comments<br>I first heard about James over 10 years<br>ago when I was Dean of the what's now<br>the school of biomedical Sciences<br>Frank Griffin who is then the head of<br>microbiology and Immunology<br>began telling me about this promising<br>Young Medical<br>microbiologist who was an alumnus of<br>otago<br>over a period of time the conversation<br>moved to Helen we need to attract James<br>back to otago followed by Helen I have a<br>plan can I appoint him<br>um James you have definitely delivered<br>on the promise that Frank described and<br>I'm delighted that you've been promoted<br>to Professor<br>I'd also like to thank Frank for his<br>foresight creative creativity and powers<br>of persuasion<br>so well done James I look forward to<br>learning more about your research and<br>qriket and I'd now like to invite Lisa<br>to formally introduce Professor Usher<br>my name is Lisa Madison Smith and I'm<br>the acting dean of the school of<br>biomedical sciences and so it is my<br>great pleasure to be able to introduce<br>those<br>professors giving their inaugural<br>professorial lectures in the school of<br>biomedical Sciences<br>it is at times like this and and<br>particularly and and some somewhat<br>difficult times that we face that we get<br>to focus on what we're really here about<br>as academics and celebrate the<br>outstanding teaching and research<br>of the staff who have have reached the<br>the level of of professors here at the<br>University so<br>um<br>thank you for uh for giving us this<br>opportunity and so pleased that<br>everybody could be here to celebrate<br>with us tonight so as as we've heard<br>um James uh graduated with his mbchb<br>from the University of otago in 1999 and<br>then in uh in 2010 he graduated with a<br>PhD from<br>my alma mater University of Auckland<br>um and in in that same year became a<br>fellow of the Royal College of<br>Pathologists of australasia<br>as Helen said he took up a lectureship<br>position here at the University in 2013<br>and then in 2016 I was promoted to<br>senior lecturer and then in 2020<br>associate professor and of course most<br>recently as a professor<br>um<br>as we know James's research expertise is<br>in cellular immuno Immunology clinical<br>microbiology and molecular biology with<br>goals of his research to develop novel<br>solutions to combat antimicrobial<br>resistance and understand the role of<br>innate like innate-like T cells and<br>infection in humans<br>so he not only undertakes the uh basic<br>research but also applied research and<br>has<br>has been involved in the development of<br>a number of<br>of valuable immunotherapies and so forth<br>he like many of our academics but truly<br>an impressive<br>research Grant<br>um<br>record he's attracted over 14 and a half<br>million dollars as a principal<br>investigator and another 4 million or so<br>as an associate investigator so truly<br>incredible as we've heard recent funding<br>from MB and the Strategic science<br>investment fund vaccine platform<br>uh but also a number of other recent<br>grants from from MBA around covid grants<br>from the HRC<br>and from the Morris Wilkins Center one<br>of the the cores<br>um a really really impressive<br>background and and obtaining direct<br>research funding<br>but he's also an amazing teacher and<br>contributes to teaching in the<br>microbiology department and Mel's<br>program from everything from the 200<br>level through the 400 level he has<br>supervised<br>over 20 PhD students as primary or<br>co-supervisor<br>similarly 700 or Sorry Seven Masters<br>students and over<br>12 honors students that he supervised<br>the research of<br>in terms of his research outputs James<br>has published over 70 Publications and<br>the top<br>journals in the field but also more<br>broadly in nature microbiology nature<br>Immunology the British medical journal<br>landsat infectious diseases so again<br>truly an outstanding record as as an<br>academic and particularly one that's<br>doing a joint clinical and academic role<br>so his talk tonight<br>um<br>is uh not surprisingly according to his<br>description fits with his long-standing<br>Cricket he's being a long-standing<br>cricket tragic he's an opening batsman<br>with a diverse research interests in the<br>field of infection and Immunity James<br>has combined his career in medicine with<br>lab bench research studying both<br>pathogens and host response to infection<br>antibacterial immunity antibacterial<br>resistance and vaccine development have<br>been the focus of his research and his<br>overall goal is to improve the<br>prevention diagnosis and treatment of<br>infectious diseases<br>so he says like Cricket research and<br>Medicine are team sports and we can<br>certainly see that from his CV and we'll<br>certainly hear tonight James is a team<br>player he's been fortunate to work with<br>many talented researchers and clinicians<br>in several different countries and the<br>importance of of these teens and what<br>they can achieve has brought and been<br>brought into sharp Relief by the recent<br>covid-19 pandemic<br>so please join me in welcoming James to<br>give his inaugural professorial lecture<br>it's a team game a research Journey an<br>foreign<br>ER<br>nor antiporiaho<br>norrera tenakoto tenakoto tenakoto<br>kartua<br>thank you very much for all coming<br>tonight it really is a pleasure to see<br>so many people here and so many people<br>who have contributed uh to my journey<br>especially since I've been here in<br>Dunedin so it uh yeah so thank you for<br>coming and I hope you enjoy the talk as<br>I'll try and play a few shots mostly<br>with a straight bet but there might be a<br>couple of a couple more inventive shots<br>now I have to say when I was talking<br>um a few months ago with a colleague and<br>the topic of an IPL came up I have to<br>admit it wasn't an inaugural<br>professorial lecture that was the first<br>thing that came to mind rather it was<br>the Indian Premier League and I have to<br>say I'm not a huge or haven't<br>traditionally been a huge fan of the<br>Indian Premier League it's all sort of<br>um pajama Cricket it's uh knuckleballs<br>and lap shots and things that never<br>never occurred back in my day<br>um but now I see my son doing it and it<br>is uh yeah I guess I'll get it slightly<br>more interesting in the Indian Premier<br>League but I'm more from the days of<br>Martin Crow playing cover drives Richard<br>Headley charging in and Landing the ball<br>on a 20 cent piece every time and<br>nipping it away and close finishes and<br>um and test cricket<br>so I grew up in Richard Hadley's<br>Hometown so and I remember being on the<br>sidelines of Lancaster Park with a beer<br>cans with stones in them chanting Hadley<br>Hadley as he came in so I was a family<br>of four so uh older son of Ken and<br>Christine Usher and I had a younger<br>brother Christopher who apart from a<br>glorious few years during my early<br>adolescence was bigger than me which<br>always greatly annoyed me<br>but I harbored Great Hopes of of being a<br>cricketer and that was my preferred<br>preferred career and it was looking<br>promising for a while and this is from<br>form two when we're very successful<br>unfortunately that cup wasn't for<br>winning I think we have a second but<br>there are three famous New Zealand<br>Sports people in that photo<br>um and unfortunately I'm not one of them<br>um so as Richard Hadley uh in the middle<br>up the top and then this chap down the<br>end Shane Bond so he was a very fast New<br>Zealand bowler and then uh standing in<br>the the far left of the back rows um<br>actually Ryan Nelson who was one of New<br>Zealand's greatest team of footballers<br>Captain the uh all whites to uh 2010<br>World Cup to the only undefeated team in<br>the 2010 World Cup so disappointingly<br>though my abilities weren't quite at<br>their level so I had to refocus on<br>alternative career options<br>and I really just wanted to be like my<br>father<br>and my father was a was a doctor he was<br>a doctor at Student Health at Canterbury<br>University<br>and his father before him was a was a<br>doctor and a different sense and that<br>he'd uh he basically run Timaru hospital<br>and being a general practitioner back<br>general practitioner back in the early<br>20th century but so I really wanted to<br>follow my father's Father's Footsteps<br>despite him trying desperately to talk<br>me out of it he was he was unsuccessful<br>so um I went off to came down here to<br>University<br>and I was at Knox College in 1994<br>actually with um with Roz Kemp so Roz<br>had the door she was in the room across<br>the hallway from me at um at Knox I've<br>known Roz for a long time<br>and some of my friends kindly put up<br>messages to help encourage me in my<br>journey to um to to get into medical<br>school<br>so I've managed to manage to get in<br>fortunately and a class photo from third<br>year and great to see some members of<br>that class here who are still in uh<br>still in Dunedin so really appreciate<br>your support while I was in Dunedin I<br>started my research journey and I did<br>that through summer studentships and I<br>did both after second year and after<br>third year I was in the department of<br>physiology with Gene Fleming looking at<br>the expression of beta activen and ovine<br>tissue and I also did an elective during<br>my third year with her as well because I<br>enjoyed it so much and I have to say it<br>was helped by the fact that over summer<br>there weren't many people in the lab I<br>was able to have radio sport on and I'd<br>sit there preparing while listening to<br>the dolls that tones of the um of the of<br>the commentators such as Ian Galloway<br>talking about a domestic Cricket it was<br>ABC fabulous couldn't think of a better<br>way to spend the summer<br>I then moved up to up to Christchurch to<br>clinical school and during my training<br>into an elective while other people were<br>doing exciting things such as going to<br>work in Africa or on the Pacific Islands<br>I was slightly disorganized and didn't<br>quite get around to that but I organized<br>an elective with Steve Chambers Steve<br>Chambers is an infectious disease<br>physician working at Christchurch<br>hospital and a fabulous Enthusiast for<br>infectious diseases and teacher of of<br>infectious diseases and microbiology and<br>I did a my first and probably only delve<br>into qualitative research doing a a a<br>survey of maternity care providers<br>attitudes to HIV antenatal screening and<br>I think it is worth pointing out that<br>Steve's also a cricket tragic so if it<br>wasn't for the fact that one R.J Hadley<br>was the same era as Steve Steve would<br>have played qriket would have been a<br>fast bowler in the bowl for Canterbury<br>instead I think he he certainly played<br>for Canterbury a anyway so greatly<br>enjoyed working with Steve<br>but after my time in Christchurch it was<br>time to leave and fly The Coop and I<br>moved up to up to Auckland where I did<br>my house jobs and got registered working<br>at uh at Auckland hospital<br>but I I found myself a little bit<br>disillusioned at that point and I needed<br>some time off and so with my girlfriend<br>at the time now my wife we went to<br>Andrea and I went to the UK for some<br>what I like to describe as career not<br>enhancing time and I worked as a Locum<br>house officer and occasionally<br>specialist registrar which I really<br>wasn't qualified to do in the NHS and we<br>moved around to various places but an<br>important part of the journey was in<br>London near the end of the time we were<br>there at King's College Hospital I was a<br>Locum Sho and oncology and I went along<br>to a multi-disciplinary team meeting in<br>there was a clinical virologist there<br>and I'd never sort of heard of this I<br>hadn't realized that you could have such<br>a thing as a clinical virologist so I<br>went and talked to him afterwards and<br>then went back to the lab and talked to<br>the microbiology registrar and what the<br>job involves and I thought well that<br>sounds rather good because I really<br>wasn't sure what I wanted to do at that<br>time so I do I did what all good<br>Junior doctors do I went and bought a<br>textbook<br>introduction to Modern virology and on<br>our way home we went and stopped on the<br>beach in in Thailand and much to<br>Andrea's annoyance I sat there reading a<br>textbook on the beach in Thailand so I<br>know it's pretty sad but it's true<br>so I came back to Auckland hoping to get<br>on the training program and after six<br>months as a medical registrar I was<br>fortunate enough to be accepted onto the<br>onto the training program and I spent my<br>first year at middlemore hospital or<br>counties Manukau under the tutelage of<br>Selwyn Lang and Susan Taylor<br>um and that was a great experience<br>Sullivan's really one of the fathers of<br>infectious disease and microbiology and<br>New Zealand and it was my job to take<br>him in the morning on our way to the<br>coffee because they'd banned smoking in<br>the lab I had to take him via the golf<br>course under the trees where he couldn't<br>be seen so he could have his pipe on the<br>way to uh on the way to Coffee<br>the next year I went and worked at lab<br>Plus at Auckland hospital with Sally<br>Roberts David Holland Arthur Morris and<br>I'm also Kitty croxson who was really<br>the founder of clinical virology in New<br>Zealand unfortunately I couldn't find a<br>photo of of kitty but she was a real<br>real character and I really enjoyed<br>working for her and also got to work<br>with some great registrar colleagues at<br>the time including Deborah Williamson<br>who's now a professor in Melbourne Steve<br>Ritchie who's working at University of<br>Auckland and Josh Freeman who's up in<br>Christchurch<br>but after I did my part one exams I<br>decided that<br>I wanted something else as well and and<br>I really enjoyed the science aspect of<br>it and always had so I thought that<br>maybe a PhD might be the the way to go<br>and I was fortunate to get an HRC<br>clinical research training Fellowship<br>working with uh with John Taylor who's a<br>virologist in school of biological<br>sciences at the University of Auckland<br>and my curse co-supervisor was Rod<br>Dunbar who's an immunologist<br>and I worked on an recombinant<br>Associated virus as developing it as a<br>vaccine Vector so this involved lots of<br>molecular biology and making viral<br>vectors in the lab purifying them<br>testing them to see how well they<br>infected cells mutating the Caps to see<br>if we could make that better and it was<br>really a lot of fun and really enjoyed<br>my time at the University of and<br>I managed to<br>um<br>I managed to finish in uh three and a<br>half years unfortunately none of these<br>fellowships are either long enough to<br>cover a PhD so I ended up actually wrote<br>quite a lot of my thesis was written on<br>a bus going um well you get a lot of<br>time sitting on a bus in Auckland<br>um going from uh all sent from Auckland<br>University where I was doing a part-time<br>Fellowship to North Shore hospital where<br>I was doing a part-time consultant job<br>to try and meet the bills as it were<br>and then thanks to Rod Dunbar and his<br>suggestion and introduction to people in<br>Oxford where Rod had been<br>I sought to undertake a postdoctoral<br>fellowship a nuffield medical fellowship<br>at the University of Oxford and I was<br>fortunate to<br>work in the laboratory of Professor Paul<br>kleneman and also under supervision of<br>Professor Rodney Phillips now Paul is a<br>um another he's a great athlete he<br>represented the UK at the 1984 Olympics<br>in Los Angeles and fencing and he was<br>right into<br>um and into Road cycling and triathlons<br>and and the like<br>um and I was in the middle of our<br>building uh Peter medavar building for<br>pathogen research which was tucked<br>behind next to zoology on South Parks<br>road but I mean Oxford really was a<br>really exciting fabulous place to to be<br>as a as a young scientist and I got to<br>work with a an amazing bunch of<br>um of default candidates and post-docs<br>and um and research fellows who are<br>passing through Oxford at the time and<br>we had a lot of time spent around the<br>coffee machine discussing science and<br>working out solutions for for problems<br>and it really was a really exciting time<br>to be in Oxford<br>so in Oxford I was working on a recently<br>recognized subset of T cells so I'm<br>going to get into a little bit of<br>Immunology now so these are called mate<br>cells or mucosal Associated invariant T<br>cells so these are are T cells that kind<br>of bridge innate and adaptive immunity<br>so adaptive immunity being the the cells<br>that recognize novel antigens that<br>you've not seen before that get if they<br>recognize their antigen they expand and<br>proliferate and become effector cells<br>and set down memory sort of traditional<br>idea of the immune response and innate<br>cells being those that recognize highly<br>conserved aspects of pathogens respond<br>quickly but you don't really have much<br>in the way of memory formation or at<br>least we thought so at the time<br>um so mate sales kind of sit in between<br>there so unlike classical T cells which<br>recognize a bit of chopped up protein<br>presented on a molecule on an engine<br>presenting cell called MHC the the<br>molecule that's presenting the peptide<br>through their recombined T Cell receptor<br>mate cells which also have a recombined<br>T Cell receptor are recognizing a um a<br>recognizing a non-polymorphic MHC like<br>molecule called mr1 and we didn't know<br>what the antigen was that was bound in<br>mr1 but we didn't think it was a peptide<br>at this time and these cells were<br>present early on we knew they were<br>present early in life and that their<br>reasonable frequency and they all had<br>the same T Cell receptor and we knew<br>they were antibacterial but we didn't<br>know much else about them so I was<br>involved in research firstly looking at<br>what happened to them an HIV infection<br>so we found that they were depleted an<br>HIV infection and we've posited that<br>this was<br>related to the immunodeficiency to uh<br>bacterial bacterial infection in HIV<br>we also managed to define a novel<br>mechanism by which they were activated<br>so they could be activated independently<br>of their T Cell receptor by<br>pro-inflammatory cytokines that might be<br>released during a viral infection or a<br>bacterial infection and I've read<br>several papers on that we defined the<br>ability that they're able to kill<br>infected cells and that bacteria or<br>other bacterial signals helped them to<br>be better activated and during that time<br>a group in Melbourne by Jim McCluskey<br>Jamie Ross John Dale Godfrey made the<br>exciting discovery that actually mr1<br>didn't present peptide it was presenting<br>a bacterial metabolite so it was these<br>cells are recognizing bacterial<br>metabolism and a pre it's a precursor<br>from riboflavin synthesis that binds to<br>ml1s recognized by the T Cell receptor<br>so it was a completely new paradigm and<br>Immunology and it was really exciting to<br>be part of it<br>Oxford was also good for other reasons<br>Oxford has lots of lovely Cricket<br>grounds and I was fortunate to play in a<br>couple of Village cricket games but I<br>was pretty busy so I didn't have too<br>much time especially with a young family<br>and but I did get to play for um the<br>medevar and we combined with stats to<br>play in the Jack the famous Jack Cox<br>cricket series which is a T20<br>interdepartmental competition which I<br>think is something we really need to<br>implement in otago<br>and this had everyone from players who<br>first-class cricketers who are playing<br>for the Oxford the top Oxford team to<br>aging professors who probably used to be<br>good cricketers when they were younger<br>and two memorable characters from that<br>time uh were Peter Beverly so this is uh<br>this is Peter here so Peter um was a<br>Dorian of Immunology here to discovered<br>monoclonal antibodies that were commonly<br>used reagents he discovered that CD4 was<br>the receptor for HIV he was involved in<br>TV vaccine research but all I knew Peter<br>4 was that he used to bowl these really<br>loopy leg Spinners that would come out<br>of the clouds and deceive the batsman<br>they either got caught on the boundary<br>trying to smack him out of the park or<br>they missed it completely and got Bold<br>and the other person there is uh sir<br>Peter Donnelly so Peter Peter was a<br>involved in the Human Genome Project<br>he's a statistician he led the welcome<br>trust genetics uh Center for human<br>genetics and he's also a fine<br>left-handed opening batsman and Peter<br>and I used to open the batting together<br>now I have to I can't really remember to<br>this game I do when I looked it up and<br>found the results I was trying to find<br>stuff on the jet Cox I did remember that<br>I had to come back to me that we had won<br>the plate in our last year but I hadn't<br>realized we'd done it quite so<br>convincingly and Peter and I must have<br>battered bloody well Gavin that we won<br>and um we won in 13 overs without any<br>loss so that memorable memorable times<br>but the most memorable thing from Oxford<br>has to be that we went over there as a<br>family of four and we left um<br>left as a family of five so uh Alice was<br>born over there during our first year<br>there so um really it was an amazing<br>time<br>um as a family and it was really very<br>really very special time<br>but as um as as<br>Helen has alluded to<br>um<br>uh Frank uh Griffin<br>was managed to recruit me back to otago<br>in fact it was um wasn't hard it was an<br>easy choice to come come back here it<br>looked like the perfect job it was<br>half-time academic<br>half-time clinical at Southern Community<br>Laboratories like into 2013 family moved<br>back across the world to um to Dunedin<br>to the Department of microbiology and<br>Immunology and to Southern Community<br>Laboratories<br>okay<br>and I continued my research on on mate<br>cells and I was fortunate to hire Rachel<br>henway who I think I spotted uh before<br>who was an amazing research assistant<br>and laboratory manager who started this<br>work Marion Schneider who was post-doc<br>um Rajesh lamachano who was the first<br>PhD student who I recruited and then<br>subsequently a postdoc he did an amazing<br>amount of work<br>looking at defining the effector<br>functions of meat cells defining their<br>role in disease and pneumonia looking at<br>their function in tissue and comparing<br>liver meat Cells versus blood mate cells<br>and their interactions in the and the<br>immune response and the signals that<br>responsible for for controlling their<br>activation and I'd just like to give a<br>shout out to amazing range of<br>collaborators both in School of Pharmacy<br>sir Andrea Vernell has been a critical<br>collaborator throughout and making the<br>ligand along with Joel Tinder and Sarah<br>de la harp whose son Cormac now plays<br>with Jack plays football so nice to have<br>those links a great clinical<br>collaborators and Ben Brockway John<br>McCall David Murdoch Sandy SLO and then<br>a whole bunch of science<br>collaborators involved as well including<br>Tony Kittles Oshi Morgan<br>Peter Darden Matt Schofield Joe Kerman<br>Matt Lube Hassan and also continued<br>collaborations with Oxford with with<br>with this I was also had met Philip Hill<br>and it was great great to see Philip<br>here I come<br>there he is hi Philip thank you<br>and Philip<br>very kindly involved me in a project<br>that he had underway<br>in Bandung and Indonesia<br>and this was a collaborative project<br>with the Netherlands and with local<br>researchers at the University<br>universitas<br>in Bandung Dr bhakti<br>was the the local lead and this was a<br>study that Philip had helped set up<br>looking at uh<br>a nice immunity to tuberculosis<br>infection so Indonesia is one of the<br>highest one of the high<br>incidents countries for TB in the world<br>they have hundreds of thousands of cases<br>a year tens of thousands of deaths but<br>if you look at if you do case contact<br>tracing of patients who have active TB<br>and you look at their household contacts<br>only some of them the observation have<br>been previously made that only some of<br>them became infected and some did not<br>become infected and Philip set up this<br>really<br>elegant epidemiological study to try and<br>tease out some of the mechanisms of what<br>he called the early clearer phenotype<br>and he was positing that the immune that<br>these people were heavily exposed still<br>became infected but that they they<br>cleared infection before they could<br>establish an Adaptive immune response<br>and so I actually went over to<br>um uh to Bandung to help set up the<br>immunological study worked with um Aisha<br>veril who was PhD student of Phillips at<br>the time and uh and worked with a great<br>team there so that was a really exciting<br>study to be part of and that's an<br>ongoing study as well<br>so I'm also I'm from the center for<br>international health or now the otago<br>global Health Institute I work with a<br>friend and a colleague of uh Phillips<br>John Crump his good friend of mine as<br>well now and<br>John was interested in causes of fever<br>and antimicrobial resistance and was<br>working in Myanmar and a project with<br>the University of Medicine one<br>in Yangon and Yangon General Hospital so<br>it's the University of Medicine one up<br>the top and along with John and David<br>Murdoch traveled over to Myanmar to help<br>with this e asia-funded project but we<br>Define we I've initially with a PhD<br>student of John's from Myanmar and on<br>mayat WE defined that there were high<br>rates of gram negative resistance in the<br>hospital in at the Yangon General<br>Hospital and then in a prospect of fever<br>study we were involved I was involved in<br>the um into my and the bacteremia aspect<br>of that and the antimicrobial resistance<br>we set up through funding from the<br>division we established bioinformatic<br>capability for whole bacterial whole<br>genome sequencing and we use that to<br>Define uh outbreak<br>um and the genetic the relatedness of<br>isolates and the genetic mechanisms of<br>resistance of those isolates<br>in in their prospective study we also<br>then use it along with<br>um<br>who is a another doctor from the<br>University of Medicine one we looked at<br>the causes of type of<br>um<br>uh intric fever typhoid paratyphoid and<br>Yangon and using sequencing we defined<br>that there were two different outbreaks<br>of typhoid and both resistant to<br>fluoroquinolines could Define the<br>mechanism of that and went furthermore<br>we could show that one of those was<br>linked to India suggesting that there<br>was transmission across the border of<br>typhoid fever salmonella typhi from<br>India into into Myanmar<br>uh we also have been using sequencing to<br>investigate outbreaks back in New<br>Zealand so in collaboration with Roland<br>Broadbent uh neonatologist maddening<br>hospital and for the Department of<br>Women and Children's Health we've been<br>we're investigating we investigated a<br>outbreaker multi-resistant<br>staphylococcus capitalists in the<br>neonatal Intensive Care Unit and then<br>with John and<br>um and with Louise Thorne who was a<br>student we did a case we did a case<br>control study to try and investigate<br>mechanisms for the transmission of that<br>isolate within the that strain within<br>the unit and interestingly we found that<br>that was all a clonal outbreak and not<br>only that we identified that this was a<br>clonal outbreak that was across nicu's<br>that was across country borders and it<br>remains uh unclear as to how that<br>organism is transmitting globally around<br>Nicos but our staff would have to be a<br>leading hypothesis was there and there<br>were some hints of that from the case<br>control study but unfortunately we<br>didn't get a definitive answer we've<br>also used whole genome sequencing to<br>investigate the rise in resistant gram<br>negatives causing neuronutrate<br>infections in the otago region so over<br>the last few years we've seen a massive<br>increase in the rates of what we call<br>espl producing E coli so these are<br>multi-drug resistant gram negatives and<br>through sequencing we managed to show<br>that this doesn't look like a clonal<br>outbreak rather we're seeing<br>introduction from multiple introductions<br>in the otago region from elsewhere by<br>someone as yet unrecognized mechanism<br>and then more recently we've been<br>working in Samoa in Fiji so I've been<br>privileged to have two excellent PhD<br>students the co-supervised with Philip<br>and John Lupe and saki salupe's from<br>Samoa saki from Fiji and I mean sucking<br>has set up the most amazing study in<br>Fiji and has coordinated the collection<br>of isolates from multiple hospitals and<br>we've been looking at with Saki and with<br>Lupe we've been looking at carbo pen and<br>resistance and just one story from that<br>is we've identified a large outbreak of<br>carbopenum resistant to Senator back to<br>balmania it's largely centered around<br>the Intensive Care units and from their<br>combined studies with this is a<br>phylogenetic tree these are always scary<br>but basically we've found that the<br>isolates from Samaya from the Samoan<br>hospital and from the Fijian Hospital<br>half the many of the isolates from the<br>hospital and from the Samoan hospital<br>all colonally related and we could find<br>those same isolates and previous<br>isolates from<br>Australia from Brisbane and also within<br>the New Zealand ESR collection<br>suggesting there's an oceania-wide<br>outbreak of carbopin and resistant to<br>Senator back to balmania and both Lupe<br>and Saki have identified scarily high<br>amounts of carbopen and resistance and<br>in high frequency of isolation of<br>Gabapentin resistant organisms which is<br>really quite concerning also similar to<br>I guess the Myanmar story sake is also<br>identified a a clone of<br>carbopenin resistant incentive back to<br>balmania that's closely related to<br>isolates from India and given the<br>medical<br>links between India and Fiji that makes<br>makes sense so we're seeing multiple<br>different outbreaks that we can Define<br>through sequencing and now through<br>Morris Wilkins Center funding we are<br>looking at trying to establish publish<br>real-time pathogen genomics in Fiji and<br>Samara to enable them to do some of this<br>work locally and hopefully sucky will be<br>able to go back and Lupe's really back<br>in Samara and be able to lead some of<br>this<br>okay so I think it's time to change Tech<br>now and um everyone knows that<br>everything changed at the start of 2020<br>so at the start of 2020 I was blissfully<br>unaware I was in Stewart Island and<br>having a lovely holiday beautiful place<br>highly recommend visiting but I came<br>back from holiday in mid-January to<br>reports of a novel coronavirus that was<br>spreading and causing outbreak initially<br>in Wuhan then China and then was<br>detected in other parts around the world<br>including<br>early on Italy and Spain<br>so this sounded really quite concerning<br>and um we could see that the the chances<br>of this coming to New Zealand were<br>pretty high early on in the piece so<br>along with Jenny Grant who's the head of<br>molecular pathology at Southern<br>Community Labs worked with um my<br>colleague Miguel Quinones Mateo and his<br>lab members Blair Lawley and rodery<br>Harford to try and establish a essay to<br>test for SARS coronavirus 2 that could<br>be used for Diagnostic purposes now the<br>problem we had was that we didn't have a<br>virus it wasn't in New Zealand at that<br>stage all we had was the sequence and we<br>had an essay that had been reported<br>overseas that worked so what we did<br>Miguel and his team synthesized<br>synthetic RNA that we could use to<br>establish the essay we then managed to<br>get some DNA from cdna from the vigil<br>lab in Australia after they had an<br>isolate appear in Australia and they'd<br>cultured it over there and we use these<br>to validate and set up our essay and set<br>it up on the on the panther so our go<br>live date was Friday the 13th of March a<br>very inauspicious date to go live with<br>anything and our first case diagnosed in<br>Southern District Health Board was on<br>Friday the 13th of March prior to that<br>we've been sending samples to Canterbury<br>Health Labs so I think that's a case of<br>just in time because everything went<br>berserk after that and suddenly we had<br>huge volumes of specimens and rare<br>things rapidly got out of control<br>um<br>so the other<br>um thing that was very fortunate other<br>than getting the essay up and running on<br>the day uh the day the first case was<br>particular in southern was the fact um<br>that we had facilities<br>um in Dunedin in the department of<br>microbiology where we could grow the<br>virus and we're one of the few places in<br>the country<br>um that was capable of doing this and<br>this was thanks to the efforts of the<br>website Center for infectious diseases<br>led by Kurt and particular Krauss Greg<br>Cook who had got the um the PC3 lab on<br>the roof of the microbiology and<br>Immunology building and they have been<br>commissioned just before I arrived in<br>2013 and rodery Harford was up there<br>trying to culture uh culturing virus<br>from our specimens we managed to get<br>SARS coronavirus 2 out of multiple of<br>those early specimens that has proved to<br>be an extremely valuable resource from a<br>Diagnostics perspective and I'm also<br>from a<br>research and perspective going forward<br>so just showing the importance of having<br>these resources<br>so<br>not long after that in fact a few days<br>after that I had a holiday I really<br>didn't want to go on I had to go to<br>Rotorua and that wasn't because I didn't<br>want to go to Rotorua it was that it<br>the proverbial was hitting the fan and<br>um<br>everything was exploding and we were I<br>spent the whole holiday much to Andrea's<br>dismay in the hotel room on meetings<br>trying to work out how we were going to<br>respond to this this outbreak this is<br>before just a week before lockdown<br>and at that stage we were struggling to<br>get reagents we were struggling to get<br>uh<br>um<br>uh<br>I'm struggling to get reagents starting<br>to get all sorts of materials into the<br>country from a Diagnostics perspective<br>and we were running out of swabs and it<br>was really concerning and on the way<br>back in the airport I phoned<br>one of my senior Immunology colleagues<br>around<br>the country and said we need to have a<br>discussion around vaccines because<br>we're going to need a vaccine for this<br>I'm worried about what's happening with<br>Diagnostics what's going to happen with<br>the supply chain so he organized a<br>meeting and we got all the immunologists<br>around the country together in a zoom<br>meeting and we discussed<br>um what uh what was going to be our<br>approach and look unsurprisingly there<br>was a range of different<br>views in that meeting all perfectly<br>reasonable some of us thought that we<br>should try and<br>develop vaccine locally others thought<br>that that was we should just wait and<br>we're going to get a vaccine<br>internationally and yes I agree at the<br>end of the day that proved to be the an<br>accurate<br>description but we didn't know at that<br>time we thought it might take years to<br>develop we didn't know what our access<br>to it was going to be there'd been<br>vaccine hoarding with the flu pandemic<br>in 2010<br>and then there was also talk about well<br>could we help develop other vaccines<br>from overseas so after that meeting I<br>got a phone call from Graham The Grove<br>from The malligan Institute and he was<br>Keen to to have a go at this and to do<br>to do to do something and see whether we<br>could develop a vaccine and so we wrote<br>a<br>opinion piece we were for the New<br>Zealand medical journal we were<br>advocating that this was at least one<br>thing that we should be putting out uh<br>we should be investing in that uh it did<br>this obviously wasn't going to be the<br>only basket we put our eggs in but this<br>was certainly one aspect from a<br>resilience perspective that we should be<br>doing<br>so we managed to pull together firstly<br>with some<br>mbie funding through the covert<br>Innovation acceleration fund and then<br>ongoing funding from mbie and<br>subsequently largely philanthropic<br>funding the vaccine Alliance out here<br>are in New Zealand and that was a<br>partnership between researchers of<br>maligan otago Wellington we also brought<br>in people from industry including SBS<br>manufacturer AG research ESR Marines we<br>also had overseas Partners we worked<br>with the University of Melbourne as well<br>and we worked to work together to<br>develop a vaccine and we had a massive<br>team of people who were working on this<br>and I have to say as stressful and as<br>frankly as scarred as I am from the<br>covert pandemic this was one of the<br>great upsides and I greatly enjoyed my<br>work with with uh with Vans and with<br>working with this bunch of people<br>so we have managed to develop a vaccine<br>we have we investigated several<br>different options we looked at overseas<br>Partners but at the end of the day the<br>candidate that we've gone with is one<br>that David a comality and Lisa Connor<br>led the development of from Victoria and<br>it takes a bit of that Spike protein<br>from covert takes the receptor bite to<br>mine binding domain we dimerize it to<br>get a bit of antibody response and then<br>we're including the n-terminal domain to<br>get a better T Cell response and we've<br>shown in in vitro experiments and mice<br>that gives better immune response gives<br>better breadth of antibodies it gives<br>better T Cell response and then in<br>challenge studies we've done at the NIH<br>with Harry Halligan's help and then with<br>Canter sabaro and University of<br>Melbourne we've shown that mice<br>vaccinated with our vaccine protects<br>against not only the original SARS<br>coronavirus II but also Delta Beta And<br>even Omicron ba5 and we can even see<br>antibody responses to the original size<br>coronavirus so we're really excited by<br>this and to have this developed in a<br>couple of years is really quite<br>impressive we have a commercial adjuvant<br>partner this is a Vigilant that's<br>already in the clinic being into<br>millions of people including in the US<br>and in America we've done our glp talk<br>studies in New Zealand through invitus<br>we have got a GMP manufacturing<br>organized through SPS and we've we've<br>got our essentially uh pending Med safe<br>approval got our GMP product and we've<br>got our phase one clinical study design<br>that's almost complete with mirin's and<br>we're hoping that we'll be going into<br>the clinic early next year so I think<br>that's a super exciting outcome from<br>from that research<br>um Vance has also taken involved in the<br>car Mata or run the car Mata karora<br>study where we've assessed the response<br>to the to the fisa vaccine in new<br>zealanders and in a cohort that was<br>enriched for Mari Pacifica and elderly<br>new zealanders we've shown that despite<br>no uh<br>virus having circulated in New Zealand<br>the two doses provided sufficient<br>immunity neutralizing antibodies as<br>measured in Nicki Mullins live in<br>Auckland to um<br>uh uh do beta and to Delta and the<br>ancestral but for Omicron you need that<br>third dose so that's an ongoing study<br>and I think has been really helpful the<br>other thing that we've done through the<br>advanced collaboration is we've<br>established mRNA<br>um synthesis capability so uh Gavin<br>painter and Ian Herman's already had an<br>mRNA vaccine program prior to the<br>pandemic and we've also developed a<br>sarskov 2 mRNA vaccine that we've tested<br>pre-clinically and in my lab and Dunedin<br>we've also got a vaccine program<br>currently underway for a a vaccine<br>preventable disease where there's a need<br>in New Zealand with without other<br>options<br>so moving away from bands have been<br>other things<br>involvements through the the pandemic<br>and I think one of the other things that<br>gay has given me uh grain sense of<br>fulfillment has been being able to get<br>out there and talk to communities and<br>um to try and provide education around<br>the covered vaccine so this sort of<br>started through a conversation with<br>Gareth Jones and Simon Walker Andre van<br>Rye Susan grindley and Blair Duncan from<br>uh from church from Dunedin City Baptist<br>church and we put together a pamphlet<br>and had a panel discussion and I have to<br>admit I've been amazed since then to see<br>how far that pamphlet has traveled<br>around the around the country also was<br>asked by Lyndon Drake who's the mariach<br>Deacon<br>from for Auckland in Northland to<br>participate in a covert vaccine panel he<br>knew a friend from Oxford he also done<br>his defil does d Phil in Oxford and it<br>was a great pleasure actually to meet<br>London for the first time in person last<br>uh last Sunday yeah we didn't really<br>preached<br>um also talked to Fed Farmers talk to<br>through the Morris Wilkins Center was<br>involved in talking to Secondary School<br>teachers to biology teachers back over<br>vaccines and also was involved along<br>with Philip and Donna Wilson and Peter<br>McIntyre in a Facebook live event<br>organized by Fiji National University<br>around covert vaccines that had over 20<br>000 people involved so really that was a<br>really satisfying part to to be part of<br>the other thing that was really<br>satisfying to be involved with was I got<br>to be involved with New Zealand cricket<br>so I advised New Zealand Cricket on<br>their covert plans for Club Cricket for<br>domestic Cricket for international<br>cricket and through that I also along<br>with Michael Butchart from public health<br>here he's also a qriket fan got to we<br>both were invited by the ICC to be part<br>of their<br>biosafety advisory committee for the<br>Women's World Cup and that was really a<br>great thing to be to be part of it was a<br>fabulous event and we managed to get<br>through it without any major disruption<br>which in the middle of an Omicron<br>outbreak was outstanding and one of the<br>highlights was being able to go to the<br>final and take my daughter Alice who's a<br>king cricketer to um uh to and at the<br>end into the long room where she got to<br>meet some of her Heroes like Leah to who<br>and Katie Martin and the like<br>so I just wanted to finish off with some<br>reflections<br>and from putting together this talk and<br>and from considering how my career has<br>gone to date and I think the first is as<br>the title said it's a team game I mean I<br>think that if we it's amazing what you<br>can achieve when you bring together<br>people from multiple institutions from<br>multiple disciplines or working together<br>to a common problem I think that's best<br>exemplified by Vans but also extremely<br>well exemplified by the work we've done<br>with otago global Health Institute with<br>Philip and and with uh and and with John<br>and also the the T cell research the<br>meat cell research as well and also I<br>mean a big shout out to the team at<br>Southern Community Labs as well I mean I<br>see gaylene here and Anita and Regan and<br>Juliet Gracie Joe from IPC here as well<br>I mean it's it's the medicine is a team<br>game as well and and I think it's really<br>I think if nothing else covert has<br>taught us that<br>secondly and now I'm starting to um<br>starting to play with a cross bat here<br>and maybe pulling out the occasional<br>ramp shot or scoop shot stop laughing<br>Jack<br>um the um I think<br>we need to be more ambitious as new<br>zealanders so we can do amazing science<br>we can do world-class science and it<br>really annoys me when I hear the why in<br>new zealanders and in the sense of why<br>we're doing this here we can't do this<br>here we can do these things in New<br>Zealand we just need to<br>um we just need the opportunity to do so<br>in the funding to do so so I'd like us<br>to change that around I never want to<br>hear why in New Zealand again I want to<br>hear why not in New Zealand there's got<br>to be a good reason why we're not doing<br>doing things and I think this back this<br>has been my zoom backdrop for the last<br>two years I've inflicted on everyone<br>especially Australians and Indians yep<br>um with the bsac as well I'm going to<br>have to take it off soon guttingly but<br>um but we we can we are we can be world<br>leaders we can be um world champions<br>the other thing is the importance of<br>training opportunities in a career path<br>and look I've I realized looking back<br>over this I've been extremely lucky I've<br>had opportunities with summer student<br>chips I've got to do a training internal<br>active I got<br>good fellowships to do my PhD and to do<br>my postdoc not everyone's so lucky I<br>think we're pretty good at PhD<br>scholarships especially at otago but<br>where we fall down is ongoing support<br>for researchers for early career<br>researchers to mid-career researchers<br>where's the career path for our for our<br>scientists and look it's encouraging to<br>hear in the latest budget that there's<br>going to be more money for fellowships I<br>really hope some of that is making a<br>career path so that our young scientists<br>like these young girls can imagine<br>playing in the IPL for two hundred<br>thousand dollars U.S for eight weeks<br>work<br>um and this comes back I think to<br>funding and I think it is worth<br>acknowledging that<br>we need to be advocating for more<br>funding for research in New Zealand we<br>are underfunded so if we look at oecd<br>average as a national<br>funding as a percentage GDP is well<br>under the oecd average and admittedly a<br>lot of that is because we don't have<br>good industry funding of research but<br>even if we look at Government research<br>that for many years has tracked<br>government-funded research has tracked<br>under the oecd average and while there's<br>been an increase in the last few years<br>the question has to be asked why are we<br>aiming for the average we should be<br>aiming to be a leader in trying to make<br>research and science an important part<br>of of our country and our country's<br>economy and I think it's really telling<br>when you look at where that increase in<br>funding has gone most of it's gone to<br>Industry most of that increase there's<br>been in parallel there's been relatively<br>little increase in the likes of the<br>Mazda and the HRC the Endeavor and most<br>concerningly especially when we start<br>thinking about the situation<br>otago and Victoria find themselves in at<br>the moment<br>what the hell's happened to the pbrf<br>we've seen virtually no increase in the<br>pbrf which is our basic research funding<br>for the University so I think we need to<br>be banging the drums and telling the<br>government that they need to increase<br>funding for science<br>right pulling out the scoop shot here I<br>uh also don't like this increased<br>emphasis emphasis on impact that's<br>coming through I think that impact may<br>not be immediately obvious I think<br>trying to seek us for all these Grant<br>applications wanting the impact to be<br>explicit and to be to be a clear path<br>the clinic for all of these things is<br>like supporting the hundred in in the UK<br>or the IPL I think we need to have more<br>of a blue skies view we need to play a<br>long game and we need to realize that<br>not everything is going to lead to<br>impact straight away and I think the<br>thing that sticks with me that um from<br>about this was talking to Sir Martin<br>Evans who's a noble Laureate and he came<br>when I was a PhD student at the<br>University of Auckland and gave a talk<br>he's the discoverer of embryonic stem<br>cells he had absolutely no thought of<br>the impact when he did when he did that<br>work he was it was purely out of<br>curiosity and yet they're there to<br>spawned a massive field of biotechnic of<br>biological research and is going to lead<br>to new Theory so we don't know where<br>discoveries are going to come from there<br>needs to be an element of serendipity<br>and there needs to be recognized in<br>funding rather than focusing on trying<br>um<br>I think I'm charging down the pitch a<br>bit here now but um research when this<br>is important uh things particularly in<br>the current climate we need to remember<br>that research is a Core Business of this<br>of our University we are<br>um a research University and as it says<br>on the University's New Zealand website<br>New Zealand's eight universities are all<br>research-based institutions research is<br>a major output of academic and research<br>only staff and informs the teaching and<br>learning environment<br>research of national and of<br>International Quality and relevance is<br>expected of modern universities and<br>academic staff University Research is<br>vital to New Zealand it produces new<br>knowledge and disseminates their<br>knowledge and adequate support adequate<br>support for a high level high quality<br>research culture and infrastructure is<br>essential to enable universities to<br>achieve their purpose and Mission<br>so I think we need to be we need to be<br>holding this firm at this time because<br>if we downgrade our research<br>capabilities we are going to be also<br>downgrading our attractiveness to<br>students we're going to be downgrading<br>our International competitiveness and I<br>think we really need to be<br>um<br>uh lobbying Government hard for<br>additional funding to the university<br>sector at this time<br>and following on from that resource<br>researchers are a precious resource I'm<br>almost almost done here so um this is a<br>departmental photo familiar in the year<br>we have amazing people in this<br>department from um from Young through to<br>seasoned Emeritus professors and um I<br>think these these people are the engine<br>room of our science they're the engine<br>room of our University they're the<br>future of our scientific future this is<br>our opportunity to build new<br>um uh change the direction of our<br>economy build new biotech we need to be<br>investing in these people and keeping<br>them keeping them going<br>so there are challenges ahead and<br>they're not just for Ben Stokes and Pat<br>Cummins although I am looking forward to<br>that battle we've got a new pathogens<br>emerging we have antimicrobial<br>resistance we've got climate change<br>we've got and um uh likes of incursions<br>of the likes of mycoplasma bovis we've<br>got the how do we grapple with AI and in<br>all of this a thriving research science<br>academic sector is going to be critical<br>to address these and it's really<br>important that this is the time for<br>investing in science and investing in in<br>in universities not the uh the time to<br>um to make them let them with a<br>so finally I just like to<br>give a huge shout out to everyone I mean<br>I've haven't done much of this work I've<br>looked after it I've kept an eye on<br>people I've been met with them<br>occasionally these are the people who<br>have done the work these are the people<br>I've collaborated with it's an amazing<br>bunch of students and staff amazing<br>bunch of collaborators it's been a a<br>great journey so far and I've really<br>really enjoyed it and hopefully I<br>haven't left anyone's name off but if I<br>have apologies I really have greatly<br>appreciated everyone I've worked with<br>finally I'd just like to say thank you<br>to my family especially to my wife<br>Andrea who has<br>put up with put up with a lot moving<br>across the world we put up with<br>me doing a PhD while having two chill<br>young children has put up with moving<br>across the world twice<br>and it has put up as well with my<br>running off to coach cricket and go to<br>qriket meetings as well as all the<br>academic stuff as well I'm also a huge<br>shout out to my kids I've really<br>um I love you You're great and it's a<br>lot of fun I love standing on the<br>sideline barracking for you or out there<br>coaching you and I look forward to<br>hopefully keeping to oh keeping on doing<br>that for many years to come so I think<br>we've reached the last ball of the Test<br>match and hopefully I've made my ground<br>might be a minute over but thank you<br>very much and thanks again for attending<br>I think it's on yes it is<br>and warm Pacific greetings to you all I<br>thank you James for your inspirational<br>IPL tonight that captured your world<br>leading research and the impact it's had<br>both globally but particularly here in<br>New Zealand and and now our Pacific<br>Neighbors<br>um what are what is absolutely<br>incredible tonight is that all of this<br>that you've seen was done on half an FTE<br>so James only spends 50 percent of his<br>time doing research and it's just for me<br>I'm just blowing away by what you've<br>achieved<br>um<br>I'm just going to use some of your<br>cricuting analogies now because I<br>noticed you had some so I'm going to<br>bring them in too so it was really nice<br>to see you come off the long run up<br>tonight and I and I felt actually you<br>were just getting started so I'd<br>actually like to sit down and let you<br>keep going because I think there were<br>there were many things that you said at<br>the end of that lecture that a lot of<br>people need to hear so so thank you for<br>that<br>um it's really important and I<br>especially<br>um support that comment why not in New<br>Zealand indeed I mean that's something<br>that we need to I I hear that I don't<br>hear that very often so thank you for<br>reminding us<br>um as you've seen tonight James has<br>combined a career in medicine with<br>laboratory bench research with the goal<br>to improve the prevention diagnosis and<br>treatment of infectious disease<br>James was a really critical addition to<br>our department I mean thank you Frank he<br>was the first clinical appointment in an<br>apartment for over 30 years he has given<br>our clinical microbiology teaching and<br>research programs the relevance and<br>clinical impact that it was desperately<br>needing<br>the students at all levels have enjoyed<br>your teaching and hearing your clinical<br>perspective and it's been really it's<br>been critically important in helping us<br>chart the right direction for many of<br>our vectors of these projects in the<br>department<br>um the panoramic the panoramic scope of<br>your work will and your brilliant mind<br>was evident in your talk tonight we've<br>heard a lot about your world leading and<br>pioneering research on mate cells and<br>your contributions to a number of the<br>similar findings on the biology and<br>Roland disease<br>it was great that you were able to bring<br>that research from Oxford establish it<br>here and also grow it here so I hadn't<br>quite appreciated just how far that<br>research had gone in the department and<br>in the University so so wonderful to see<br>that<br>um obviously the the work you do on the<br>international stage on the detection<br>characterization and transmission of<br>antibiotic resistant bacteria is very<br>important and it's great to see that<br>real-time genomics now is a reality both<br>in New Zealand and overseas in Myanmar<br>and our now our Pacific Partners in Fiji<br>so that's fantastic<br>um<br>also tonight it was great to see the<br>Pacific PhD students sake and Lupe<br>you've been massive contributors to our<br>department and I can see now that we're<br>starting to become a bit of a hub more<br>pacific students are coming we've got<br>the culture right it's a good place to<br>do research<br>um your leadership during the covid-19<br>pandemic was inspirational Thank You<br>Usher family for letting him spend so<br>much time and and saving us from this<br>virus I mean<br>development of essays to detect the<br>virus you know all driven by James<br>Hands-On work in the southern Community<br>Laboratories before commercial essays<br>were here<br>I'll never forget the day that James and<br>Janet<br>came out to me in the department and<br>said we need to start wearing masks we<br>need to start physical distancing and I<br>was going on what's going on here what's<br>going on here but actually you were<br>right<br>um Harlan I remember Harlan ringing me<br>up the next day the Saturday morning and<br>basically telling me off and saying that<br>we need to stand down we're scaring<br>everyone in the University but basically<br>uh the Restless history so thank you<br>James that leadership was was inspiring<br>um your co-leadership of the science as<br>science director of the Vans platform we<br>saw tonight that actually now that has<br>produced a vaccine That vaccine now is<br>in phase one clinical trials and what's<br>also really important the 17 million<br>dollars that's come on that line now for<br>an RNA platform all driven by James's<br>leadership of that program so we we owe<br>you a lot James so thank you for for<br>doing that<br>Community work once again I'm not going<br>to say too much you're everywhere you're<br>just a standout I love that you can<br>involve New Zealand Cricket in that<br>that's been very good<br>um<br>so you were a cricket tragic but in<br>actual fact the black caps have done<br>pretty well in recent years so we should<br>be very proud of that so one of the<br>things that I took interest was that<br>that James was an opening batsman so I<br>thought to myself I was actually used to<br>be an opening fast bowler so I used to<br>like buying to guys like you but I<br>wouldn't have wanted to Boulder you<br>I don't know James is pretty modest<br>actually he he's a seriously good<br>cricketer I mean he played with Craig<br>McMillan Dion Nash Shane Bond I mean<br>these are all legends of New Zealand<br>Cricket so anyway what I did was James I<br>looked up to see what are the key<br>qualities of uh opening batsmen and what<br>relationship would that have with your<br>skills as a scientist so so here they<br>are<br>the opening batsman must be able to play<br>defensively and leave as many balls as<br>possible while still being able to score<br>runs when the opportunity arises so I<br>think we've seen that tonight<br>you've done a brilliant job of taking<br>the opportunities that have been given<br>to you in which runs could be scored<br>antibiotic resistance whole genome<br>sequencing real-time genomics covid-19<br>everything that James touched as a<br>winner<br>while avoiding all of those distractions<br>that we're never going anywhere now I I<br>normally I I would be very politically<br>angry to say what that is so tanifa yep<br>good another thing that's really<br>important and adaptable technique<br>although you could have lots of shots<br>knowing your own game is most important<br>we've seen that tonight brilliantly how<br>you adapted your research to be fit for<br>the many challenges facing infectious<br>disease research I didn't realize how<br>much virology you've done early in your<br>career but obviously that came back to<br>be very useful in the covid-19 pandemic<br>the high pace and bounce of the ball<br>must not perturb you<br>you handle this quite magnificently<br>without even being hit in the head with<br>a bouncer as I know a lot of them were<br>throwing through the covid-19 pandemic<br>so well done obviously very skillful at<br>avoiding those bounces<br>opening Basin requires a great deal of<br>skill and patience as well as the<br>ability for Locus Focus for long periods<br>again demonstrated by your long-standing<br>commitment to your main cell research<br>even when funding was very hard to get<br>here in New Zealand the scoreboard kept<br>ticking over with honors and PhD<br>students<br>I want to thank your family for sharing<br>James with us and I hope this evening<br>will be a fitting celebration to<br>recognize what an amazing academic and<br>clinician James is congratulations James<br>and thanks for representing the<br>department University with such<br>distinction looking forward to your next<br>Innings I'm sure it will be a long one<br>thank you very much<br>foreign</p></main><footer
