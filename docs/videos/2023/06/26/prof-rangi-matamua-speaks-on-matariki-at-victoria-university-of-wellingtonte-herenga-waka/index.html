should get us an F at<br>least pretty poor attempt at being power<br>I just want to say to you all thank you<br>so very much for having me along tonight<br>uh I do uh have this kind of page and<br>called living by the stars but tonight<br>it's living by the par and I just really<br>want to thank you for having me along<br>and to talk about matariki I'm not going<br>to take too much of your time I know uh<br>there's a lot going on but I want you to<br>focus if there's one thing I want you to<br>take away from this um little<br>presentation is the name hi I just want<br>you to remember that name name<br>hi here you can see on the the screen<br>here this is a image of Miki Rising<br>about 3 weeks ago so here's Miki the<br>cluster next to Venus just before the<br>sun<br>rises but that is not the time to<br>celebrate the mildy new year that's not<br>the time to celebrate matariki our<br>ancestors knowledge was part of this<br>really detailed<br>connected uh comp Lex division of time<br>and it was uh it had all of these<br>different feeders into this really<br>beautiful way of following an<br>environmentally Leed timekeeping system<br>it includes position of sun it includes<br>visibility of star it includes Luna phas<br>it also includes migration of birds<br>spawning of fish flowering of trees all<br>of this fed into this timekeeping system<br>and the base and heart of that knowledge<br>base is empirical science but because<br>empirical science from a cultural<br>perspective can be quite boring unless<br>you attach it to a narrative they<br>encompassed this whole knowledge system<br>within this cultural narrative so it<br>didn't separate itself out just to be<br>science it became spiritual it became<br>cultural it became ceremonial and it<br>became part of a living and evolving<br>knowledge system that's interconnected<br>to everything else in the world and<br>that's what I want you to focus on<br>tonight and I'm going to start with this<br>name in the beginning Sky father and<br>Earth Mother<br>papatuanuku lay in a close Embrace with<br>their many sons between<br>them for eons they lay within the<br>confinement of an unbreakable Bond or so<br>it seemed but within the shroud of<br>Darkness fested a rebellion that<br>threatened to tear them<br>apart the sons of and papa had gathered<br>in<br>secret<br>hi there was much bickering amongst the<br>brothers but in the end all but one was<br>in<br>agreeance god of the Winds and storms<br>did not approve of the separation and<br>vowed<br>Revenge with the help of his brothers T<br>separated their<br>parents using his powerful legs tan<br>thrust his father up into the heavens<br>causing An Almighty explosion that<br>cosmos de to the anguish of their<br>suffering parents the brothers reveled<br>in their freedom but it was not what<br>they<br>expected it was an expanse of dark and<br>cold emptiness that quickly filled with<br>a great flood of their parents'<br>tears the brothers were miserable and<br>cold in their new found<br>Freedom amidst the rain and from the<br>darkness lightning<br>fleshed a figure of dread emerged it was<br>taid<br>Mar the world fell before taidi and his<br>wind children who were intent on one<br>simple purpose<br>Revenge one by one the brothers were<br>defeated by<br>tat first T then<br>tangaro eventually only a defiant to mat<br>god of war and Humanity<br>remained an epic fight ensued a Clash of<br>Titans<br>two was twisted in the air and slammed<br>back into the ground followed by a<br>lightning belt that two caught and H<br>back at<br>taidi taidi launched a continuous stream<br>of wind and lightning thunder resounded<br>the ground heated and cracked beneath<br>them to heed mightily against haridi his<br>legs locked on the Earth and and slowly<br>but surely he Advanced against his<br>brother<br>tafi quicker than the eye could see and<br>the mind could comprehend two reached<br>out and caught darid MAA with all his<br>strength and might two smashed darid<br>ground taida Was<br>Defeated however t hi Mar vowing to<br>never let his brothers forget had one<br>final Act of<br>defiance ploring out his eyes in anguish<br>and grief he crushed them in his hands<br>and cast the shards into the<br>heavens as if still possessing sight<br>tfid turned his hollow gaze to to ma<br>uttering one final warning know this I<br>will attack you and your children<br>forever I will rain down chaos and<br>destruction I will have my<br>with you and your will never Escape<br>me every time you look to the skies you<br>and<br>remember when you g upon now father my<br>eyes will look down on you and remind<br>you of what you have<br>done I've just probably given the kids<br>nightmares<br>sorry<br>uh so m is<br>ples and uh the story that youve just<br>viewed is the origin of the<br>name m or the eyes of the god M the god<br>of the Winds and weather who disagreed<br>with the separation of his parents tore<br>his eyes out crushed them threw them<br>into the sky they stuck to his father's<br>chest and there they are today and<br>here's uh an image of ples with the nine<br>Greek names with in the<br>cluster there's the<br>name the eyes of<br>the which we truncate because no one<br>doing hurry up it's<br>mik or Miki as a number of places say<br>and then we've just shortened that even<br>further so it sounds nice and it becomes<br>mik we do have this thing going on<br>called little eyes this thing that was<br>actually translated by Elon best this is<br>his translation of what Miki means there<br>no narratives to support this and it is<br>something that we continue to perpetuate<br>today right across the ancient<br>world ples is the earliest and well most<br>well recorded group of stars in the sky<br>there you see a cave painting on the<br>left hand side it is a bull that<br>painting is 20,000 years old and above<br>the shoulder of the bull you see those<br>dots that is said to be the cluster of<br>the<br>plates uh there's a stardus there that's<br>about 4,000 years old that is said to<br>have the Sun the moon and the stars of<br>the<br>plates Subaru in<br>Japan uh the earliest astronomical<br>reference is from China it's a few<br>thousand years old and refers to the<br>blossom Stars what are the<br>pladies in Europe it's freya's hands or<br>freya's chicks that's what the Vikings<br>thought and there Freya with her<br>children being drawn across the sky by<br>two<br>happening but I bet that the engine on<br>uh in Egypt it's connected to um the<br>goddess neth knit who is said to be a<br>goddess of fertility and there you see<br>it is also connected to cows I'm not too<br>sure whether foner has got something to<br>do with the plaes but it is said to be a<br>group of cows in the sky in the Americas<br>particularly in South America it's part<br>of a cosmic snake they see the same sky<br>in the same position as we do down here<br>in the southern hemisphere when that<br>cluster is said to be spread far apart<br>and bright in the sky your cool or your<br>sweet potato will grow well and if it's<br>close together you're going to have a<br>difficult season growing crops it's<br>exactly the way that it's seen<br>here in<br>Australia uh there were seven uh females<br>who ran away from Seven males and got<br>turned into SK stars and are in the<br>sky but the record that we know most of<br>all in the a narrative that is most told<br>told most often is the Greek version you<br>remember that 20,000 year old uh<br>painting in a cave in France with the<br>stars above the shoulder of the bull<br>today the stars of the pladies are in<br>the shoulder of taurus the ball that's<br>how we understand it today uh it's also<br>known as a Seven Sisters even though<br>there's Nine<br>Stars um that's because they are the<br>daughters of the other two stars Atlas<br>and paleon and were put into the sky to<br>be kept away from Zeus was quite a<br>frisky God and wanted all of them his<br>wives and the father said hell no put<br>sky now if you look on this map every<br>single location that this map points to<br>the stars are known as<br>matariki now that is an indication of<br>just how incredibly Magnificent the<br>ancestors of the people who settled this<br>region were at traversing the expansive<br>Ocean on the map right up into the<br>Marshall Islands we're talking about<br>miconia into new calonia Melania into<br>the central Polynesia Tahiti all the way<br>to nearly South America you're in Easter<br>Island I'll it is Miki or a version of<br>matariki and everywhere it means the<br>same thing the eyes of the god or the<br>eyes of the chief until you get to Al<br>and we get this little ice thing going<br>here and there is an image that we quite<br>often see uh portrayed saying this is<br>matariki here you go he's matariki no<br>this is ples cuz it's upside down uh<br>this is how you see it in the northern<br>hemisphere with all of its nine<br>names and this is how we see it here uh<br>and with my ancestors version of nine<br>names of uh the matariki cluster now I<br>have nine names other tribes have seven<br>I'm kidding I'm kidding there are<br>different versions throughout Humanity<br>about the number of stars in this<br>cluster there's versions of six 7 n the<br>prophet Muhammad viewed and named 12<br>with his naked eye and there's some<br>parts of Europe where they even had a<br>story of 15 visible stars in the cluster<br>lots of factors come into play elevation<br>light pollution air pollution how blind<br>you are um whether you live on the Co<br>much better living Inland the star stars<br>are clearer uh further away from the<br>ocean all of these factors come into<br>play all of these stars have a purpose<br>and a and and a meaning to us here and<br>um you know when you look into the sky<br>you're not going to see that okay I'd be<br>very concerned if that's what you<br>see but this is my cultural perspective<br>I understand that these are giant balls<br>of gas pulled together by gravity burn<br>learning light years from the Earth but<br>my culture also lets me understand these<br>as deity as beings as gods and as um my<br>ancestors who have a connection to my<br>everyday life here on Earth and I just<br>want to quickly touch on them all so<br>matariki is in the center there<br>interesting hey mildi we give matariki<br>the name of the cluster and a star in<br>the cluster so we're just trying to be<br>difficult<br>Our Stars have genealogy as well so<br>matariki is the star big star in the<br>middle of the matariki cluster who<br>husband is reua or the great red star in<br>the body of the Scorpius andares and<br>they came together one of his stations<br>is R Mii or Mii medicine that's what he<br>is the god of he married matariki who's<br>connected to well-being she's a Healer<br>so the medicine man married the Healer<br>they have eight children every single<br>one of these children brings a bounty or<br>something to us that we uh use or we're<br>connected to throughout our year and<br>I'll just quickly touch on the children<br>uh the oldest is poor hukaa and every<br>time I put this up lots of people go yay<br>the Christmas<br>tree sign of<br>death okay sorry but uh in this instant<br>it's a sign of death and I'll come back<br>back<br>to tip<br>anuku tipu means to grow anuku in the<br>ground pretty basic is connected to<br>everything that<br>grows in the ground or touching the<br>ground as it grows like any fruits Kum<br>pumpkin anything that's on the ground is<br>connected to<br>tianu her brother T grow in the sky so<br>anything that grows off the ground very<br>fruits but particularly Birds the birds<br>star uh white white means fresh water<br>the star has an association to all of<br>the animals the creatures that Mai would<br>Harvest out of the lakes and the rivers<br>and the<br>streams someone asked me does that<br>include Rotten<br>corn I guess it's a combo of uh White te<br>and uh tip corn TI<br>wa T is an old word for salt wa means<br>salt water this is connected to the<br>oceans way puni why is water Puna means<br>rain urangi urangi is um wind it's<br>connected associated with the wind uh<br>and there is the final star and this is<br>a star I want you to take home Hiwa<br>hi is the star during the season where<br>our ancestors would make their wishes<br>and send their wishes to hewa hewa was<br>visible here in porn I received a photo<br>and uh spoke to someone as they were<br>watching it live uh on Monday Tuesday<br>Tuesday morning when they saw hewa now<br>if that was seen by our ancestors people<br>with wishes in their hearts something<br>that they didn't share with everyone<br>otherwise people would would take your<br>wishes and bribe you or you know and<br>gossip and you have wishes and you would<br>be taken into the gardens where nothing<br>is growing at this time here and they<br>would dig a trench and then you would<br>stand in it and they would cover your<br>feet with soil and the would and he<br>says great he wonderful hewa all knowing<br>sky the sin from the heavens plant my<br>wishes in the soil and make them grow<br>hewa means to be Lush be Lush in the sky<br>come down to earth plant your wishes in<br>the soil and make them<br>grow and there they are now they're not<br>randomly placed in these<br>positions Miki is said to be the k it or<br>the conductor of the cluster right<br>situated in the middle<br>there uh to her left our right you'll<br>see tipu and<br>tipi those are<br>connected male female food from the sky<br>food from the earth ragi is always above<br>Nuku that's just basic mildi rule<br>stard food from the food so you are<br>there is no Tapo or sacredness in that<br>part of the cluster Whitey wa female<br>male these<br>two fresh water salt water why is she<br>above him fresh water always slow flows<br>downhill to salt water never the other<br>way around uh there are food there's no<br>tapu in that part of the cluster right<br>up above you have and Udi male female<br>there's balance rain and wind why are<br>they above everything else cuz rain and<br>wind comes from above everything else<br>that is a complete framework for a mildy<br>world it includes our weather indicators<br>of rain and wind and every part of the<br>environment that we interact with it<br>includes the air Earth fresh water salt<br>water the other two why are they there I<br>have absolutely no<br>idea but I do know that those are the<br>two sacred stars in the cluster one is<br>concerned with carrying out dead across<br>the night sky and the other one is<br>connected to the wishes of the year when<br>I go outside in the correct lunar phase<br>of the correct Luna month which is<br>pretty much this<br>week uh and the last day to really view<br>it properly is tomorrow and if I go<br>outside and I look into the Eastern sky<br>and I watch it rise its appearance will<br>tell me what one my year is going to be<br>like so I saw it this morning I saw that<br>tipu was bright this morning I know know<br>that it's going to be a relatively good<br>year to plant my garden now this is my<br>viewing of it you locational where you<br>are you view it it will be different but<br>how I saw it I saw urangi I know it's<br>not going to be uh that windy this year<br>but they weren't as fast spread as they<br>were last year the Summer's not going to<br>be as long as it was last year it was a<br>long long summer biggest spread I've<br>ever seen it but it was pulsating quite<br>a lot this morning that is a sign for me<br>if I'm reading it<br>that it's going to be an inconsistent<br>season this season and it's not going to<br>be as consistent as it was last<br>season and hea was up so I've asked for<br>the lotto numbers for this<br>weekend so if you get up tomorrow<br>morning or depending on how tonight goes<br>you might just be getting home tomorrow<br>morning uh you're going to see the big<br>yellow ball thing rise that's the<br>Sun and where it rises you'll just above<br>before the sun comes up you'll go into<br>three three stars nowhere else in the<br>night sky will you find three stars that<br>bright that close together Orion's Belt<br>is the name of that group of stars many<br>of you will know it as the pot okay you<br>follow the pot you go left you come to a<br>triangle pyramid kind of group of stars<br>that is thear that's the face of taurus<br>the B and you go just a little bit left<br>again<br>and you're going to bump into matariki<br>so looking East look for those three<br>stars go left and go left and you will<br>come to Miki and you'll be able to read<br>it in the morning now there's a whole<br>lot of science that I really don't want<br>to bore you<br>with well because I've only got a couple<br>of minutes left and uh this is like<br>matariki presentation number 5,000 this<br>week I do want to talk to you about this<br>canoe I want to talk to you about this<br>cluster because we spoke about that star<br>pohutukawa the star that leads the dead<br>across the night sky it leads this canoe<br>at the front of this canoe I heard the<br>during leads this canoe that triangle<br>shape is the sail and at the back you<br>can see tootu or Orion's Belt just above<br>Orion's out there is a star that is<br>tanuku tanuku is the owner of this<br>massive Cosmic net that he drops to the<br>Earth every day this constellation is in<br>the sky for 11 months of the year and as<br>it rises in the evening and the sun goes<br>down tanu drops his net to the Earth and<br>trolls for The Souls of all the people<br>that have died that day and as the sun<br>comes up he hauls the canoe he hauls all<br>the dead up into the heavens takes them<br>out of the net and you can see the<br>feathers hanging off the back of the<br>canoe and there he hangs the soles of<br>the Dead for the year and that's how we<br>see at that constellation and paut Kaa<br>leads it all the way to the month of<br>harua about the month of May June this<br>constellation and pohutukawa sits with<br>the sun taking our dead to the<br>underworld to be prepared we wait for a<br>month tomorrow morning you'll see it<br>right the canoe flat on the Eastern<br>Horizon just before the sun rises we<br>would call out the names of all of the<br>Dead who have died since the last rising<br>of matariki farewell them and that's<br>when tayu takes those Souls cast them<br>into the sky and your spirit becomes a<br>star against the chest of the sky<br>forever I me show you how this<br>works there is a sun to the right<br>sitting right next to matariki this this<br>is in the correct lunar phase of the<br>correct lunar month taking our dead to<br>the underworld to be<br>prepared doesn't happen that<br>quickly but we know that we're in the<br>right phase because we're following the<br>right Luna month the right Luna Phases<br>and it's setting and our dead disappear<br>and we wait for a month tomorrow morning<br>if you look East you're going to see<br>this correct Luna phas correct Luna<br>month the canoe Rises<br>and just as the Sun starts to come up we<br>year this is a period known as you can<br>see the three stars of our Ryan's Belt<br>there on the right hand post you just go<br>above it you'll see the three stars you<br>come left you'll see that little<br>triangle<br>pyramid you come left again there is<br>Miki you go straight up that's not of<br>strobe light that is the moon in the<br>correct Luna phase just below the moon<br>there's two stars that's PD so I know<br>I'm in the correct lunar month the first<br>rays of sunlight start to open the day I<br>know I'm in the correct time to Farewell<br>My Dead that is US calling out the names<br>of the dead of the year that's when we<br>start to<br>celebrate matariki is bookended by two<br>stars po<br>which is about the end of a cycle it is<br>about the end of the new of the past<br>year it is connected to death but not in<br>a Sinister way it's remembering those<br>people who are no longer with us but<br>it's also connected to he the star I<br>want you to<br>remember promise of something new the<br>promise of New Life the promise of new<br>growth and I'm going to really pretty<br>much end on that because<br>um I'm a proud alumni of this<br>institution uh I was very fortunate to<br>have uh the people uh lecture me through<br>this<br>institution uh when I was<br>here uh the cohort that I came through<br>with uh have gone on to do some<br>absolutely amazing things I mean Joe<br>Williams is here Joe was a generation<br>before<br>me just just before<br>me but the people that came through my<br>generation that I remember being at 46<br>celvin parade are the likes of take away<br>Tity the likes of um Mary lanc Court<br>Judge Damen<br>Stone uh the likes of Jon ALU I just<br>up we had some amazing people um at this<br>institution during that time and and and<br>after us as well and there's a part of<br>us that is imbued within the walls of<br>the heading a walker that is part of who<br>we are and will always be part of who we<br>are but everything has its time and I<br>think the buildings from 46 to 48 right<br>up to 50 are part of that process where<br>pohutu Kaa ends and something else<br>begins and I'd like you all to think<br>of and that is what mik is becoming here<br>in Al Miki has moved from being a<br>celebration of a mild event to becoming<br>a national celebration of unity and<br>identity it<br>transcends these ideas of political<br>issues that many of our other<br>celebrations and and and Gathering<br>points have it's connected around three<br>major points remembering those who are<br>no longer with us celebrating the<br>present and planning for the future and<br>its Baseline principles are some of the<br>greatest elements and aspects of<br>humankind that we have<br>Unity environmental uh interaction and<br>utoh heart or love and it's with that<br>that I leave those messages with you and<br>I hope uh this new year this you think<br>of and uh you think about the project<br>that we have that is the promise of a<br>new year a new day a new generation and<br>uh</p></main><footer
