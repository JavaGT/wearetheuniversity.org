With hapū based political decision-making, tikanga principles underpinning political community and leadership, and a focus on relationships, Aotearoa has been governed. The details of this political world have remained familiar amongst Māori, however the teaching of it in schools and universities has been lacking.<br><br>In more recent times, the field of Māori politics, replete with political leaders, movements, and events, is now much more visible and discussed by non-Māori. Yet, a common refrain of people ‘not knowing’ the political history persists and leads to challenges to the exercise of Māori tino rangatiratanga.<br><br>In this inaugural professorial lecture Professor Maria Bargh from Te Kawa a Māui, School of Māori Studies, relates four political stories illustrating the intricacies of Māori political traditions, decision-making and activism. How can knowledge of Māori politics continue to enrich the vision of shared political authority in Aotearoa New Zealand?</p><h2>Transcript</h2><p style="opacity: 0.9; font-size: 0.8em">Transcripts may

welcome you all here tonight<br>to the inaugural lecture for Maria Burge<br>from tea Kara Ahmadi Maria is a<br>professor of politics and Maori studies<br>she has a long history with this<br>University she started here as a<br>lecturer in 2005.<br>and has risen to the exalted rank of<br>Professor and in this University there<br>are many many fine professors and they<br>are promoted to this rank for a lot of<br>different reasons sometimes it's because<br>of their research and the way it is read<br>and transmitted sometimes it is because<br>of the impact of that research and the<br>way that Society Embraces it sometimes<br>it is because they are exceptional and<br>inspiring teachers who bring an energy<br>and Joy To The Next Generation and<br>engagement with their subject matter and<br>sometimes it is because their leadership<br>more widely and how they serve a<br>community of Scholars of students<br>achieving those first three things<br>um what ex what's exceptional about<br>Maria is that she has<br>excelled in all four of those domains<br>and one of the humbling things you do as<br>Vice Chancellor is you you read the<br>achievements of this of Staff in moments<br>like this and it's enormously impressive<br>um and in her research she focuses on<br>two strands political economy and the<br>environment and I think in this current<br>Epoch there is probably not a more<br>relevant time to bring those two things<br>together<br>throughout a career she's fulfilled<br>obligations to councils and how councils<br>have engaged with manafinoa she's<br>examined Maori political participation<br>and engagement again at a time where I<br>think it's perhaps more important than<br>um she has focused on the kind of<br>quintessential and I would argue<br>existential questions about time<br>renewable energy biodiversity and<br>climate change<br>but in terms of the impact beyond that<br>kind of wider research sphere inside the<br>whether it's the Ivory Tower or some<br>other metaphor<br>at the core of all that research has<br>been a really strong sense of community<br>her contributions have had impact on<br>government policy affecting ewe hapu and<br>Community groups and she's often called<br>upon to give expert advice to government<br>agencies and then many other forums most<br>recently she was appointed by the<br>cabinet to the role of the Deputy chair<br>of the independent electoral review<br>she's been recognized by the Royal<br>Society te apparangi te puatangi<br>research Excellence award in 2020 and<br>she got a University Research Excellence<br>award in 2021.<br>but<br>in addition to that research in addition<br>to that impact she's also as I've<br>already said an absolutely outstanding<br>teacher<br>her postgraduate students who often<br>think are the people who really know the<br>value and the passion and the skills<br>that our academics and professors bring<br>have highlighted just what a<br>collaborative Mentor she is and how she<br>builds capability across them<br>she also brings the expertise in the<br>undergraduate into the classroom and<br>again many many people have highlighted<br>how well she is not just liked but also<br>respected and valued as a scholar in<br>this University<br>and then finally she's been a very<br>influential leader she's head of the<br>she's she was an influential head of<br>school and bought a focus on strategic<br>Direction and openness to new initiative<br>she brought a variety of lectures and<br>energy into the school and was key to<br>supporting to treating in matarangamadi<br>in curriculum development<br>um she's recognized the importance of<br>students and academics who are studying<br>Maori alongside their own disciplines<br>and are enriched in that process and in<br>doing so she's been able to equip peers<br>in this University with knowledge of our<br>culture Heritage and language in a wide<br>variety of settings<br>the focus tonight of his inaugural<br>profession professorial lecture this<br>evening is Maori Politics the first<br>politics of atira but teaching of this<br>has been lacking<br>people don't know and I think that has<br>led to challenges for Maori and<br>particularly in relationship to Tina<br>Arena tiratanga tonight Maria relate<br>four political stories<br>illustrating the intricacies of Maori<br>political Traditions decision-making and<br>activism<br>she will examine how knowledge of Maori<br>politics can enrich the version of<br>shared political Authority in atira<br>yeah we're very looking for looking very<br>much looking forward to your lecture<br>congratulations once once again on your<br>Ascension to the professoriate and we're<br>very much looking forward to what you<br>now have to say<br>foreign<br>it's a pleasure to be here with you all<br>this evening to prevent to present my<br>inaugural professorial lecture in this<br>chamber of the University thank you all<br>for coming<br>this evening I'm going to tell you four<br>stories<br>you might think that storytelling seems<br>a long way from politics<br>you may be thinking of Elections and<br>voting or Aristotle democracy and<br>Parliament or Foucault and National<br>Security<br>the stories I'm going to tell are all<br>about politics<br>they're about political Traditions<br>political Theory political Authority<br>decision making and political activism<br>the stories I'm going to tell often get<br>mistaken for family histories personal<br>anecdotes or cultural matters<br>as a consequence they often get left out<br>or overlooked in discussions of the very<br>serious study of politics and<br>book The Truth About stories indigenous<br>novelist Thomas King explains stories<br>he argues that they're all we have and<br>all we are that you can't understand the<br>world without a story<br>that we must be careful with the stories<br>we tell<br>they may be entertainment but they may<br>also be stories of survival<br>either way once he's offered a story<br>King says take it it's yours do with it<br>what you will but don't say in the years<br>to come that you would have lived your<br>life differently if only you'd heard<br>this story you've heard it now<br>so this evening I also intend to tell<br>you stories and paint them vividly<br>so that once heard and seen you will not<br>I'd like to start with a story I know<br>the first Story begins with the taraweta<br>eruption in 1886.<br>this natural disaster shocked the region<br>and the country<br>the eruption 40 kilometers from Rotorua<br>killed 153 people destroyed the<br>world-renowned pink and white Terraces<br>and coveted covered the surrounding<br>lands and cultivations lakes and homes<br>he and others invited the people<br>impacted by the eruption to come and<br>shelter at which is South Southwest of<br>Rotorua<br>whose land at rotuity were covered lands<br>were covered in Ash were gifted land at<br>the north end of our Mountain a place<br>called tilgha<br>this move in generosity strengthened<br>long-standing connections between our<br>hapu<br>maintained their identity and<br>manamotuhaki and when safe returns to<br>their lands<br>they didn't forget their time and those<br>at however and our whanau was later<br>drawn into connections with their fenua<br>and provided shares and land blocks<br>beside Lake rotuity<br>this interaction a display of<br>monarchitunga is one of the core<br>principles of a Maori political world<br>stems from the idea of acknowledging the<br>different forms of Mana that exist and<br>the Dignity of other people and indeed<br>non-human relations<br>in a time of Crisis the eruption the<br>communities supported each other shared<br>resources and this enhanced the Mana and<br>dignity of both parties<br>the monarchy Tanga led to enhanced<br>relationships of mutual benefit between<br>the hapu<br>the crown saw the tadwear eruption as an<br>opportunity to acquire the<br>parikarangi lands from tuhorangi and<br>offered resettlement of impacted people<br>elsewhere in exchange for acquiring the<br>block<br>the proposed resettlement was to land in<br>the Thames District lands originally of<br>our neighboring ewe who which had become<br>Crown lands<br>the natural disaster was an opportunity<br>to accelerate their land acquisition<br>plans and to bypass if possible the Mana<br>The Authority held over the land by hapu<br>in the Years leading up to the eruption<br>disputes had emerged in the area over<br>tolls and levees that tarawahapu had<br>begun charging for tours of their land<br>and access to geothermal pools and<br>natural wonders<br>the Erie could see non-maori making<br>money from photographing and painting<br>these beautiful places and argued that<br>it was only fair that as the non-maori<br>political economy was founded on<br>transactions of money in exchange for<br>goods and services<br>then so too Maori should be paid for<br>providing goods and services<br>non-madi argued that the natural wonders<br>although on Maori land were Universal<br>belong to everyone and therefore should<br>be shared without cost<br>Maori reasoned that the photographs<br>taken of such wonders were not shared<br>but sold and perhaps The Profit needed<br>to be distributed<br>a proclamation placed in the Bay of<br>Plenty times reveals the position of<br>tewair Maori who were close to taraweta<br>the Europeans it says who visit<br>rotomahana who photograph at that place<br>they are to give Juani kahutaka five<br>pounds<br>should they not consent to pay this<br>money they must cease photographing<br>the reason is that they will receive a<br>great deal of money for their<br>photographs when exhibited for sale<br>it's in 1879<br>the numbers of visitors prompted the<br>hapu to formulate regulations which were<br>posted conspicuously for new arrivals<br>from around 1884. the notice reads all<br>persons visiting wishing to see the<br>wonders of this place and all the<br>Curative bars and Waters which consist<br>of different minerals must remember that<br>the visitors have to pay the man in<br>charge<br>it wasn't only tearawa in other areas<br>including the far north rangatura had<br>been collecting Customs dues from<br>visiting ships since at least the early<br>1800s<br>after 1840 the early settler government<br>prohibited jangatira from charging<br>vessels and began living and collecting<br>this charge itself<br>distribution of money at these times<br>within Maori communities tended to still<br>respond to tikanga Maori rules around<br>supporting the collective and were<br>redistributed<br>ironically in the rubble of the hotel at<br>tewairua which was destroyed in the<br>Totowa eruption lay a copy of Adam<br>Smith's book The Wealth of Nations<br>Smith's famous book sets out the core<br>principles of what was to become<br>liberalism the liberal political<br>philosophy it suggests people are<br>selfish and self-maximizing individuals<br>and Nations will become wealthy if they<br>ensure individuals are able to buy and<br>sell an allegedly free markets<br>these Market mechanisms can be used<br>liberals argue to train and civilize<br>people particularly those with what<br>Smith assumed to be less civilized<br>political economies<br>there have always been at least two<br>standards therefore written into<br>liberalism one for those already at what<br>was imagined to be a later stage of<br>human development allegedly more<br>civilized and those imagined to be at an<br>earlier stage of human development those<br>with political economic principles<br>different from the English usually<br>engaged in more reciprocal and<br>relational political economies<br>so this tension between differing<br>standards and political economies was at<br>the heart of the tension in the clashes<br>between Maori and non-maori around tolls<br>and levees at tarawera and other places<br>so that's the story of taraweta take it<br>it's yours do with it what you will make<br>it into a painting put it on a postcard<br>but don't say in the years to come that<br>you would have lived your life<br>differently if only you'd heard this<br>I'd like to tell you a story I know<br>my second story is about a pristine pure<br>ancient Puna<br>which bubbles out of the earth to your<br>Tonga on the slopes facing look North to<br>Lake Rotorua<br>in the old days a tanifa lived in the<br>area<br>in more recent times the stone image of<br>an ancient ancestors Who provided<br>protection for the people in power of<br>on the surrounding Hills<br>in 1954 the Rotorua Borough Council<br>called together the hapu to discuss the<br>council's desire to acquire the spring<br>as they needed water for the growing<br>Township of Rotorua<br>we have a record of the meeting from the<br>Maori land Court<br>in the meeting the council put their<br>case clearly they said they had the<br>power to take the entire spring under<br>the Public Works act but they'd like to<br>take it with some gesture in the form of<br>a small amount of money<br>the hapu members in attendance said they<br>were reasonably happy to share the water<br>with the other people of the town but<br>they did not want a sale of the land in<br>was quoted as saying and his words are<br>translated<br>this is a beautiful spot we don't want<br>to lose this land it has special<br>cultural spiritual and historical<br>significance to us<br>he was voicing the relational connection<br>between people of the land the land and<br>Waters and the manatee Fenway and<br>kaitiakitanga the authority and the<br>obligations of kaitiaki acquired over<br>generations to make decisions about the<br>the end result was that the council<br>proceeded and insisted on the sale and<br>transferred 500 pounds to the Papu who<br>remained opposed to the force taking of<br>the land<br>in the following years further land<br>around the spring was taken under the<br>Public Works Act without compensation<br>until 14 acres was taken by the council<br>the fence was more than two meters tall<br>around the pumping station and sheds<br>access was blocked and the hapu lost<br>physical contact with the spring<br>in the mid-2000s our hapu lands trust<br>tepayaka which still farms and cares for<br>the lands on tahitonga was regularly<br>paying for water and we began<br>investigating why and indeed how when<br>the karamutak and takina spring was on<br>the edge of our remaining lands we knew<br>it had been ours originally but the<br>exact story was lost<br>we discovered the final piece in the<br>puzzle when we obtained and read the<br>minutes of that fateful 1954 meeting<br>at the very end is our cuyan karawa saw<br>that the council was proceeding despite<br>their opposition they managed to extract<br>a concession<br>that they would be able to continue to<br>visit this spring and that they would be<br>able to continue collecting water for<br>the spring from the spring for their<br>adjoining lands<br>none of these promises were conveyed to<br>the title and weren't kept by the<br>council<br>the spring provides 90 percent of the<br>drinking water for the people of Rotorua<br>hapuru negotiations with the council<br>lead in 2021 to the signing of a<br>co-management arrangement<br>the Rotorua Lakes Council agreed to<br>return the land taken and the hapu<br>agreed to continue shearing the water<br>with the people of Rosario<br>the ceremony<br>included tears laughter singing and a<br>tour behind the fence to pay our<br>respects to the punna<br>so that's the story of karamutakina a<br>story of generosity in the face of<br>imbalance a story of rebalancing<br>take it it's yours do with it what you<br>will bottle it damn it let it flow free<br>but don't say in the years to come that<br>you would have lived your life<br>differently if only you'd heard this<br>I'd like to tell you another story I<br>know<br>my third Story begins in 1860 in<br>kohimarama Tamaki Makoto Auckland at one<br>of the most important Ru nanga a<br>decision-making National decision-making<br>was how it was described in Maori the<br>Maori messenger government newspaper in<br>July 1860.<br>for Maori the meeting reflected the<br>long-standing tradition of Ru nanga a<br>high-level decision-making body convened<br>for matters of great significance to the<br>hapu and iwi confederations it is a core<br>mechanism within tikanga Maori for<br>political deliberations<br>specific procedures and formalities were<br>observed at these runanga to moderate<br>discussion and allow for perspectives to<br>be expressed<br>there are different views on what each<br>side was anticipating at kohimarama but<br>many suggest that in this case<br>was an opportunity for a reaffirmation<br>needed to be recognized and respected<br>and that the settler Parliament needed<br>to focus its governing on British<br>settlers Maori anticipated that this<br>between themselves and the crown would<br>be an annual event to negotiate the<br>Nexus between the irangatiratanga and<br>kawanatanga<br>for the crown there were other<br>motivations<br>Governor Thomas Gaul Brown saw it as a<br>chance to reiterate his understanding of<br>the terms of tutility I.E that maori's<br>ceded sovereignty but the British were<br>taking a protective role and he sought<br>acknowledgment from rangatura of the<br>Queen's Sovereign Authority in order to<br>continue acquiring land and controlling<br>lands for settlement<br>he was also Keen to persuade the<br>rangatura in attendance to reject other<br>political movements such as the<br>kingitunga or those in taranaki<br>in the speeches from the rangatura there<br>was an overarching thread of the desire<br>for peace and Justice and respectful<br>balanced partnership<br>that idea is a long-standing one in our<br>history<br>for me the kohimara marunanga has<br>another significance<br>two of my ancestors from different<br>branches of my whakapapa attended<br>Reverend Thomas battle and purulu<br>the thoughts of Thomas battle are well<br>recorded from that time he was a<br>Wesleyan Methodist missionary and<br>several decades of his letters are in<br>the National Library he has an entry in<br>the dictionary of New Zealand biography<br>there are books about him here's a<br>Wikipedia entry and he even published a<br>booklet with his thoughts on the<br>kingitunga in 1860.<br>there's little written record so sadly I<br>don't know what his views are on the<br>politics of tutility were he'd been born<br>in otaki as his father purulu had joined<br>with terrapraha but he lived in his home<br>nasiyawa territory at umuhika Matata<br>only a few years after the kohimara Maru<br>nanga missionary Karl volkner was killed<br>natyawa amongst other iwi were blamed<br>continued his political engagement<br>he put a wrote for 13 years to have our<br>land near umuhika returned from<br>confiscation<br>my great-grandfather was involved in the<br>cortahitanga parliaments<br>several of which were held in Rotorua<br>his name appears in the minutes of the<br>1895 Parliament organizing polling<br>booths<br>parliaments were one of a range of<br>sustained political initiatives as the<br>waitangi tribunal has described them in<br>their report on the taraki iwi of the<br>north but which is also applicable to<br>other regions in ewe<br>these political initiatives sought<br>recognition of tinurangatiratanga an<br>engagement with kawanatanga<br>the tribunal describes the political<br>initiatives in this way<br>there were committees to mediate<br>internal disputes and manage<br>relationships with settlers and the<br>colonial government regular Regional<br>parliaments at waitangi orake and<br>elsewhere<br>terraki Maori sought accommodation with<br>the kingitunga and during the 1890s they<br>took lead roles in the attempts of the<br>quarterhitanga movement to establish a<br>national Maori Parliament and<br>self-government recognized by the crown<br>they sought freedom from the Crown's<br>laws and institutions that unfairly<br>impacted them in pursuit of these<br>objectives they petitioned the colonial<br>Parliament and the queen met with and<br>wrote to ministers and proposed<br>legislation<br>some communities sought to withdraw<br>entirely from engagement with Colonial<br>authorities<br>consistently Maori leaders argued that<br>to make their own laws and manage their<br>own Affairs they sought Arrangements in<br>which Maori and settler institutions<br>could co-exist<br>ultimately the colonial authorities<br>rejected most of their proposals and in<br>particular were unwilling to recognize<br>any significant transfer of authority<br>away from Colonial institutions<br>in 1869 at weimate near waitangi with a<br>mukasi near told Donald McLean then<br>native Minister that Maori throughout<br>the north wanted two national assemblies<br>one for Maori and one for settlers<br>Let each make laws and submit them to<br>each other by this means peace would be<br>maintained in this land Maori and<br>Colonial parliaments operating in<br>Partnership<br>so that's the story of kohimarama of<br>constitutional and political engagement<br>of political leadership and activism<br>story of perseverance in the face of<br>increasing odds take it it's yours do<br>with it what you will write it down make<br>a Wikipedia entry but don't say in the<br>years to come that you would have lived<br>your life differently if only you'd<br>I'd like to tell you a final story I<br>know my final Story begins in 1995 when<br>attended the Hui at hirangi on the<br>shores of Lake taupo to discuss<br>constitutional change<br>the hiranyi Hui followed in the long<br>tradition of Maori constitutional and<br>political conversations was called to<br>discuss a matter which would impact all<br>hapu and iwi confederations<br>so happy to hear who called the Hui and<br>it was partly in response to a proposal<br>by the government to cap at one billion<br>dollars the total amount that could be<br>spent on compensating for breaches of<br>titity<br>thousands of people attended and several<br>resolutions were passed unanimously such<br>was the spirit and unity of those<br>attending<br>my queer had been involved in many<br>discussions about the unjust taking and<br>loss of our hapu land as well as<br>indigenous rights internationally and<br>mykoro spent most of his life<br>researching hapu history and the core<br>aspects of the hapu land claim to the<br>waitangi tribunal a world away from his<br>pakia upbringing and whakapapa<br>My Father Brian badge was here this<br>evening was also rostered into help<br>he'd been part of the early days of the<br>treaty unit at Manitou Maori now to<br>punikokiri the Treaty of waitangi<br>Research Unit Ministry of Justice trying<br>from within government to support Maori<br>having tidity breaches addressed and<br>preferably halted<br>the unit later morphed into the office<br>of treaty settlements and then to<br>taurafati the Maori Crown relations<br>office<br>Brian went on to work for the waitangi<br>tribunal then huia publishes with my<br>mother Robin supporting Maori writers<br>he is now retired so Works full-time in<br>a voluntary capacity for the hapu<br>examining storm water assessments and<br>monitoring the five kilometer perimeter<br>trap line at<br>this sort of work by apakia in support<br>of Maori aspirations now commonly gets<br>described as being a pachia Ally and<br>there are increasing numbers of groups<br>and individuals making educating other<br>tangatati people of titiriti their goal<br>to support respectful and balanced<br>relationships among our communities<br>in many ways the function of Ally though<br>is much less about fulfilling a role and<br>being out in front and much more about<br>being at the side or the silent support<br>having a deep sometimes personal<br>understanding of towel Maori having a<br>relationship with Maori whanau and then<br>therefore also being accountable to that<br>extended whanau<br>Brian has certainly heard the stories<br>many times he's seen them play out in<br>front of him he's had them painted<br>vividly and he lives his life<br>accordingly<br>after the hirangi Hui my brother Kapoor<br>and I were recruited to help with the<br>hapu land claim research we spent the<br>summer in the cold archives working<br>systematically through the inwards and<br>outwards correspondence of the Native<br>Affairs and box files of native land<br>court records we were both completing<br>studies at Victoria University of<br>Wellington<br>I was studying politics and loving it<br>political ideas international relations<br>I was also practicing politics and<br>engaged with one of the important<br>contemporary forms of Maori political<br>identity a kinlike group of other Maori<br>University students in itoida<br>I served on the exec planning with<br>others how to encourage decolonization<br>and Elevate the status of our rights the<br>precinct issues were decolonization and<br>trying to help titity breaches such as<br>the fiscal envelope<br>the sea Lord's deal was a worry it was<br>the first pan Maori treaty settlement<br>and a prime example of mandating<br>processes and decision-making compressed<br>by commercial and Crown political time<br>frames which shortcut and bypassed Maori<br>tikanga-based decisions<br>the multilateral agreement on investment<br>loomed it was an investment deal that<br>would track for future governments into<br>neoliberal policies and practices and<br>prevent Maori having a say<br>we were handily located here in kelburn<br>parade to march to Parliament or to<br>interrupt meetings downtown<br>these mobilizations connected us and<br>were often informed by those in the<br>wideratanga movement and the former<br>attendees of the hirangihui and those<br>planning constitutional change minor<br>Jackson miriana Pittman Annette Sykes<br>Mike Smith and honey how to wear it with<br>some of those discussing the big<br>political questions at that time<br>in my honors year as coordinator of<br>timana akonga the Maori University<br>Students Association I was sent by Tanya<br>Schultz and Martin to Geneva with<br>wairiki Grace Tracy Johnson and mediana<br>Pittman to participate in the people's<br>Global action against free trade and the<br>World Trade Organization<br>there we participated in an indigenous<br>caucus and debated the manifesto of the<br>people's Global action organization<br>from Mexico kuna Ecuador India and<br>Bolivia indigenous participants<br>discussed our common experiences within<br>our lands and internationally<br>Geneva had been a site of Refuge for<br>many indigenous peoples including Maori<br>speaking their truth to power in<br>meetings of the United Nations working<br>group on the draft Declaration on the<br>rights of indigenous peoples the working<br>group was a small area in the vast<br>state-based system where indigenous<br>peoples often marginalized in the very<br>creation of the state and silenced<br>within their states and abscured by the<br>dominant state-based system had a voice<br>Maori had regularly participated and<br>articulated a different version of race<br>relations in aotearoa which challenged<br>the rosie one presented by a New

international relations continued<br>the long tradition of Maori being the<br>first diplomats and trade ambassadors of<br>aotearoa with a history of high-level<br>meetings for peace trade and treaty<br>making often to the Pacific<br>those international relations were and<br>continue to be based in tikanga<br>principles of<br>the history includes Maori international<br>trade and fish in the 1770s exporting<br>potatoes and other crops and Schooners<br>in the 1820s monitoring global commodity<br>prices in the Maori newspapers of the<br>1850s and 1860s jumping forward to the<br>Declaration for the negotiation of the<br>Declaration of the matatua matatua<br>Declaration on the intellectual and<br>cultural property rights of indigenous<br>peoples in 1993<br>IMO use for economic development between<br>ewe and First Nations peoples and ewe<br>delegations agreeing to share knowledge<br>of indigenous tax authorities are a few<br>of the other examples of this<br>international relations<br>within the university however not much<br>of this world was reflected in what I<br>was learning or who I was learning from<br>my studies were in politics and<br>international relations but Maori and<br>Indigenous peoples voices were usually<br>absent from those courses<br>Maori Russo absent from the academic<br>faculty teaching us<br>years later after completing my PhD at<br>the street at the Australian National<br>University and working forward to<br>farewell<br>I returned to teach one semester on<br>contract in the politics Department here<br>the forsha and CBD Act was a live issue<br>and I actively brought it into my small<br>course on contemporary treaty politics<br>a permanent position came up into Kawa<br>Maui I applied and succeeded in joining<br>the team Peter adds into Dippa y Higgins<br>were the heads of school over that time<br>Danny Keenan was teaching a Maori<br>politics course which was soon passed to<br>me to teach and I found a home for the<br>Two Worlds I knew within Maori studies<br>we are able to provide students and<br>colleagues with a reaffirmation of the<br>value of the Maori World Knowledge and<br>experiences<br>the shift to MMP and the success and<br>kaupapa of the Maori party in 2005 were<br>a couple of the Embers which began<br>Sparks of a change of thinking for the<br>politics discipline in Margaret Clark<br>Lydia Weavers and I organized a Maori<br>and Parliament conference in 2009 which<br>encouraged reflection on the changing<br>world and aimed to bring it much more<br>alight with an academic political<br>studies<br>The Embers haven't quite caught a Light<br>Within politics and international<br>relations programs there's still work to<br>do but the New Zealand political studies<br>Association under the leadership of<br>Richard Shaw has begun to recently<br>so that's the story of pakia allies and<br>whanau of international indigenous<br>relations of constitutional traditions<br>and activism<br>a story of advances but also political<br>change<br>take it it's yours do with it what you<br>will turn it into a course publish it in<br>a textbook<br>but don't say in the years to come that<br>you would have lived your life<br>differently if only you'd heard this<br>so this evening I've told four stories<br>but they aren't simply stories<br>they're examples of the political<br>Traditions activism political principles<br>and the shared Authority embedded in<br>this place aotearoa there are examples<br>of the first politics of aotearoa and<br>one of the strands of politics that<br>threads through our lives<br>there are lessons in the stories<br>the first story mentioned the core<br>principles of Maori politics for<br>knowingatanga relationships and the<br>value placed on maintaining those<br>in a time of Crisis manaki Tanga is<br>prioritized and used to strengthen<br>political connections<br>the Second Story told of manna of<br>authority and Mana enhancing behaviors<br>such as generosity and sharing Resources<br>with others<br>the story told us and Injustice can be<br>fixed<br>in a situation of unfairness a rebalance<br>is sought take<br>with trust and open discussion<br>acknowledgment of the Injustice an<br>agreement on what best means the<br>Injustice an agreement on the future<br>course of action peace can be restored<br>to a place to people and to<br>relationships<br>the third story recounted The sustained<br>political initiatives that Maori engage<br>in to have tinoranga tiritanga<br>recognized and respected it highlighted<br>the two strands of politics Maori<br>constitutional traditions and those of<br>the crown<br>the entering of agreements verbal or<br>written are considered and serious<br>political matters<br>the upholding of the agreement goes to<br>the heart of one's manner<br>atikanga Maori framework expects that<br>the parties to an agreement will uphold<br>the values and commitments made<br>if you breach an agreement you diminish<br>the fourth story reminds us of the long<br>tradition of Maori diplomacy in<br>international relations Maori diplomatic<br>traditions and relations are based also<br>on those tikanga principles of<br>respecting manner connecting to others<br>through whakapapa and phenongatanga<br>links decisions about which strategic<br>Arrangements strengthen the security of<br>the nation are affected in<br>the story reminded us of the important<br>role of allies<br>of the special place and particular role<br>they have within a tikanga framework<br>all of the stories also show us the<br>inextricable and important relationship<br>between research teaching and our role<br>in the world we live in<br>the world influences and shapes the<br>University<br>and the university with its students its<br>research its teachers shapes the world<br>the power imbalance Maori experience and<br>the practice of politics is reflected in<br>the teaching and research<br>there has been a marginalization of<br>Maori politics in the teaching and<br>research of politics and international<br>relations but that is changing<br>we all inherit stories and threads of<br>history but some receive more attention<br>than others<br>one of the first steps I suggest on our<br>path to more balanced and respectful<br>Partnerships in politics is to start<br>rebalancing the weight we give to the<br>different threads of our stories and<br>history philosophies and World Views<br>knowing our history is powerful and<br>helps us on the path to reconciliation<br>we need a rebalancing of the emphasis we<br>place on knowing about the Pacquiao<br>political world and tell Maori<br>what do we mean when we talk about<br>balanced and respectful Partnerships<br>what does it look like well funnily<br>enough we can see in tertility the idea<br>of those balanced and respectful<br>Partnerships the idea that our two<br>strands of Law and political<br>institutions and World Views would<br>continue side by side that's the unique<br>Foundation of our democracy<br>universities are a crucial training<br>center for Maori and non-maori policy<br>analysts politicians planners scientists<br>and economists we need to ensure that<br>the threads of Maori politics are<br>available for their learning<br>we need stories in places like this<br>chamber and there are many more stories<br>to tell<br>those teaching public policy government<br>politics and law all need to better<br>prepare students for the interest we see<br>from people about our strands of<br>politics and the momentum from<br>government agencies to better recognize<br>one of the most common comments I hear<br>from non-maori when I talk about aspects<br>of Maori politics<br>is I never knew that I had no idea those<br>things happened to Maori no one ever<br>so now you know a few more stories<br>hopefully painted vividly to remember<br>them in full color<br>and<br>don't say in the years to come that you<br>would have lived your life differently<br>if only you'd heard these stories you've<br>heard them now<br>and there's one final comment I need to<br>make<br>you'll see behind me rows of seedlings<br>I've potted these up either from seed or<br>from our Bush block which is nearest to<br>here<br>I'd like you all to please take a<br>Seedling this evening it's a koha a<br>symbol of reciprocity of the stories and<br>knowledge she had here this evening<br>care for it grow it keep in touch and<br>uh<br>that's<br>foreign<br>and engagement and it's my privilege<br>privilege to thank Professor Maria Bart<br>for her inaugural professorial lecture<br>this evening<br>these events allow professors to<br>demonstrate their craft their insights<br>their expertise knowledge and their<br>scholarship and their disciplinary<br>fields<br>tonight we have been treated to an<br>intellectual hakari a feast<br>and I say that with intent<br>as an analogy<br>there were the main Staples of a lecture<br>it was meaty<br>substantial and mouth-watering<br>but as an inaugural professorial lecture<br>we received multiple dishes and<br>Delicacies that were masterfully laid<br>out by Professor barge and her address<br>this evening<br>this evening Professor barge told us<br>four stories interweaving whakapapa<br>politics<br>and herself<br>she introduced us to a wide range of<br>among many others and how their stories<br>are not just stories or histories but<br>Rich insights into complex political<br>theories<br>now I would Hazard a guess that most of<br>us in this room would have not<br>recognized these names<br>and at best those were some knowledge of<br>New Zealand history<br>would have only recognized Donald McLean<br>Carl volkner Thomas battle and Governor<br>Gore Brown<br>but are we surprised these are the only<br>names you recognize<br>history and more specifically how<br>history has been framed for a long time<br>has largely been used to promote the<br>grand narratives of colonization and<br>rationalize political power<br>so it should come as no surprise that<br>McLean volkner bottle and brown featured<br>in tonight's lecture<br>thankfully however only in Cameo roles<br>because that is all they are tonight<br>just extras who helped us understand the<br>significance of the stories of survival<br>and self-determination of Maria's<br>ancestors of her whakapapa<br>the genealogy is not the only common<br>feature of these narratives Professor<br>barge transported us to different places<br>it is this connectivity to place that is<br>the impetus of political struggle and as<br>Maria has demonstrated tonight how<br>complex Maori political theories<br>and how complex Maori political theories<br>can be<br>connectivity to fenua is more than just<br>legal or political rights and tonight<br>Maria highlighted how tsikano Maori<br>serves the condition and trench and<br>modify human behaviors<br>means Maria reminded us that finwa is<br>not just the word for indigenous peoples<br>or First Peoples but our inextricable<br>lengths that form the basis of our<br>historical political cultural and social<br>norms here in aotearoa but also across<br>the globe<br>scholarship is all about pushing<br>disciplinary Norms being critical<br>reflective and pushing New Frontiers of<br>knowledge we ask this of our professors<br>in these lectures<br>so it comes as no surprise that as a<br>professor of takawa Maui that Maria<br>would just settle there<br>tonight Professor Mariah<br>back into the center and push<br>colonization to the periphery<br>Maria thank you for your illumination of<br>the criticality of understanding<br>politics through the experiences of<br>people in place<br>we acknowledge your scholarly<br>contributions and actions that are<br>firmly positioned alongside those of<br>your ancestors as part of the Continuum<br>of intellectual political and cultural<br>recognition of tangat fenua<br>and while you underscored King's quote<br>take it it's yours do with it what you<br>will but don't say in in the years to<br>come that you would have lived your life<br>differently if only you'd heard the<br>story you've heard it now<br>yes we've heard it now and I suspect<br>that in years to come we actually will<br>think differently as a result<br>of<br>foreign<br>I'd like to ask Dr Mike Ross to return<br>is</p></main><footer style="margin-top: 2rem; background: #0001; padding: 2rem; text-align: center;"><p>We Are The
