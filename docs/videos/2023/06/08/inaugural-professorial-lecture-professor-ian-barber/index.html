occasion to celebrate Ian<br>Barbara's promotion to Professor<br>these lectures are a great opportunity<br>for all of us to take time out to listen<br>to the to our amazing staff and gain an<br>understanding of the research Excellence<br>across our University<br>I'd like to welcome our colleagues<br>students and friends from across the<br>university in The Wider Community those<br>of you who are in the room and those<br>online<br>but I'd like to give a very special<br>representative the deputy kaifakura<br>fakahari<br>Nicola Taylor chairperson of purikanui<br>block Incorporated and Sarah Gallagher<br>fakarahariwa Heritage New Zealand<br>promotion to Professor anatago is not<br>easily achieved and Ian has had to<br>demonstrate sustained excellence and<br>teaching research and service<br>Ian is an archaeologist an<br>anthropologist whose research is who<br>researches human societies and explores<br>how they have adapted to changing<br>physical and social environments<br>in studies and teachers change in the<br>past as well as past as the past and the<br>presence<br>from a critical position that<br>acknowledges multiple and especially<br>indigenous voices<br>his academic projects consider Mari<br>mariora mariore economic settlement and<br>material culture change<br>indigenous Agronomy culture contact in<br>Polynesia and the anthropology of race<br>congratulations Ian we're very fortunate<br>to have you as part of our University<br>whana I'd now like to invite Professor<br>Tim Thomas head of program of archeology<br>to provide a formal introduction to<br>foreign<br>my name is Tim Thomas and I'm the head<br>of the archeology program and it's my<br>pleasure and privilege today to<br>introduce my colleague Professor Ian<br>Baba to you all<br>Ian is a long-standing member of our<br>university community he studied for his<br>ba at otago in 1981<br>before transferring to Auckland and<br>completing our master's thesis and then<br>returning to otago for his PhD which was<br>awarded in 1996.<br>Ian then worked in Wellington as a<br>senior archaeologist at the historic<br>places Trust<br>um a role responsible for administering<br>the management of all of New Zealand's<br>archaeological Heritage and I think I<br>met Ian in 1999 the year he was<br>appointed as a lecturer at otago and I<br>was just starting my PhD at the time<br>back then my hair was a lot longer and I<br>think Ian's was shorter and he was he<br>was the only archaeologist I'd ever met<br>so he looked every bit the Wellington<br>professional when he arrived in otago<br>and<br>this was something that he brought to<br>otago to our program a new focus on<br>archeology as a professional practice<br>and he developed courses that had a<br>strong Heritage management content<br>this area gradually became a central<br>part of the curriculum due to increasing<br>job opportunities for graduates in the<br>Heritage sector and the tiger was<br>fortunate to have Ian's expertise and<br>experience<br>he's known by students past and present<br>as an enthusiastic even ebullient<br>lecturer with a sometimes absurdist<br>sense of humor and a gift for delivering<br>precise and socially relevant course<br>content Ian teaches a critical<br>anthropological approach to the Past not<br>just the Contemporary practice of<br>archeology but also questions about why<br>and how communities value Heritage and<br>its politics<br>these themes have guided his research<br>interests and the archeology of aotearoa<br>but also in the historical anthropology<br>of Mormonism in America and the Pacific<br>which has seen him awarded<br>a Fulbright scholarship at Brigham Young<br>University and visiting positions at<br>Princeton and the University of Utah<br>Ian's Heritage expertise also underlies<br>his Service as a board member of the New<br>Zealand archaeological Association the<br>historic cemeteries conservation trust<br>and his regular advice on Heritage<br>management to local and National<br>governing bodies and a noteworthy<br>example of the latter is his his<br>submissions to Parliament in support of<br>the moriori Claims Settlement bill in<br>2021 now an act which stemmed from his<br>projects and Partnerships on the Chatham<br>Islands<br>a major focus of Ian's work is of course<br>the archeology of Maori Society in as<br>renowned as a meticulous scholar in this<br>area often collaborating with specialist<br>scientists this work can seem quite<br>particularistic studying agricultural<br>practices via soil science<br>or examining radiocarbon dates with<br>Bayesian statistics and when he<br>excavated an archaeological site at<br>protocol which everybody else thought<br>was a fishing camp and found kumara<br>storage pits he confirmed it using<br>microscopic starch grain analysis<br>I see he's brought a more practical<br>demonstration today or conformational<br>proof today<br>but despite those particularistic<br>aspects Ian's writing never loses sight<br>of the bigger picture a recurring theme<br>in his work is the question of how<br>humans manage their resources more<br>broadly<br>this goes back to his PhD when he<br>examined the role of resource scarcity<br>in aotearoa after the extinction of MOA<br>and other fauna where previous<br>archaeologists had approached this from<br>an ecological perspective as a normal<br>almost inevitable consequence of human<br>Activity Ian was and remains interested<br>in the cultural responses to loss almari<br>Society developed customary principles<br>of resource management and environmental<br>regulation often with original ritual or<br>and religious components that is instead<br>of assuming self-interest leading to<br>complete resource exhaustion Ian<br>described evidence of Cooperative<br>practices that encourage sustainability<br>and the relevance of this perspective to<br>our contemporary concerns is hopefully<br>obvious<br>Ian's research epitomizes the idea that<br>we do not go into the past to only study<br>it but to learn from it and plan for our<br>futures it's a vision of an<br>anthropologically informed archeology<br>that engages in public discourse and<br>this is of course reflected in the title<br>of his lecture today archeology and the<br>mataranga science debate and I think we<br>all look forward to hearing your<br>archaeological perspective on this<br>join me in welcoming Ian to the podium<br>for his inaugural professorial lecture<br>Marino<br>foreign<br>thank you Helen and Tim for your very<br>kind and generous words and thank you<br>everyone for coming to this inaugural<br>professorial lecture now anyone who<br>knows me well will probably<br>recognize or or can um<br>conceit that I'm not someone who is all<br>that comfortable with talking about<br>myself I'm very happy to discuss my<br>research I'm delighted to talk about the<br>things that that I have studied and that<br>seem important and relevant I'm less<br>comfortable when it comes to personal<br>history and disclosing things about me<br>and having said that I'm aware that in<br>ipl's it is expected that one does make<br>certain acknowledgments that relate to<br>one's own personal history and there are<br>some that I need to make here just very<br>quickly<br>firstly I want to thank and acknowledge<br>my partner Fiona who's here today who<br>just is extraordinary in terms of her<br>support and involvement with much of the<br>Mahi that I do<br>uh going back to<br>my youth I'd like to acknowledge naive<br>or natikuata<br>natakuya<br>and in particular the hippolyte in<br>elkington whanau who generously<br>Incorporated me within the afano<br>identity and activities as a young<br>person growing up in Nelson through<br>various associations<br>and in particular I'm mindful of and<br>want to acknowledge important komatua<br>and kuya of natikuata natakuya Uncle<br>Uncle John hippolyte all of whom were<br>important influences from the whanau and<br>larger hapu<br>in further work that I have undertaken I<br>guess with that background as motivation<br>I have continued to work closely with<br>the ewe communities I want to<br>acknowledge in particular locally<br>um<br>who have been enormously supportive of<br>my interests in local archeology and a<br>case study of<br>interest to katihuirapa and within the<br>katahiraparohe will be an important part<br>of today's<br>talk Nicola Taylor of The pudakonui<br>Blocking Corporation they had<br>incorporation owns the land on which the<br>principal site that I'm going to talk<br>about today is situated and I'm very<br>grateful for to Nikki for the support<br>that she has given me and I would be<br>remiss not to mention Moriarty since<br>2010 I've had had the privilege of a<br>relationship<br>with<br>trust the legal representative of<br>the Chatham Islands<br>um that relationship is professional and<br>archaeological but it has also become<br>very personal and developed where I've<br>developed deep friendships that are now<br>very meaningful to me and in particular<br>I want to acknowledge Maui Solomon Susan<br>Thorpe and Tomlin knows among others<br>okay so we'll now move into the uh the<br>talk uh I have realized as I have been<br>preparing this talk that I set myself<br>um quite a substantial topic<br>um it seemed like it's one of those<br>seemed like a good idea at the time but<br>as I've continued working on it I've<br>realized that there's all sorts of<br>things one needs to be mindful of and<br>there's been a lot involved with getting<br>this to where I hope it's of some of<br>some consequence actually I'm sorry I'm<br>just going to recall I cannot believe I<br>did this but uh joining us also from um<br>the far north<br>representatives of tevalua and in<br>particular I'd like to acknowledge<br>um<br>this ewe and area will be one of my case<br>studies and just in acknowledgment also<br>of that area I'd like to recognize Ross<br>Gregory waikato's dad who regrettably<br>passed away in<br>in 2018<br>and who's who was a a very important<br>influence on me early in my career and<br>in my Mahi in that area so I'd like to<br>acknowledge uh Ross's memory and uh the<br>interest and involvement of tedarawa in<br>support for the Mahi that I've<br>undertaken in the far north<br>okay so now let's return to the address<br>archeology and the matauranga science<br>debate and I before moving on I better<br>just notice something fairly obvious<br>which one or two people have commented<br>on the image again the the<br>Spades seemed like a good idea at the<br>time but I I am conscious since that<br>with a slightly manic look that that's<br>the kind of image that could potentially<br>scare small children<br>um but anyway being that as a May uh<br>there we have it uh the speed obviously<br>representing archeology is one side of<br>um a uh<br>a relationship<br>okay so in July 2021 a New Zealand<br>Ministry of Education technical report<br>proposed that the school curriculum<br>should provide parity between the<br>teaching of mataranga Maori and other<br>bodies of knowledge this followed<br>growing Maori educator demands to<br>decolonize education and recognize<br>science values within traditional<br>knowledge within mataranga a group of<br>seven Auckland professors wrote to the<br>university excuse me a group of seven<br>University of Auckland professors wrote<br>To The Listener magazine the letter<br>under the heading in defense of science<br>published later in 2021<br>and they<br>basically disagreed with this proposal<br>they characterized it as<br>a proposal<br>that uh<br>represented<br>in effect uh<br>suggested that it would undermine<br>education<br>generally but also and more specifically<br>for Maori and this point was reiterated<br>by one of the letter writers Garth<br>Cooper who is Maori Nati mahanga in fact<br>a renowned Health Care delivery and<br>science educator Maori Healthcare<br>delivery and science educator who after<br>continued from the original letter and<br>that included an investigation by the<br>Royal Society of Garth Cooper and one of<br>the other letter writers gath Cooper<br>resigned from the Royal Society and said<br>real bias stems from The View that Maori<br>can't do things or participate fully in<br>society because they're Maori<br>unfortunately the partial substitution<br>of Mata langa Maori for international<br>format Science Education perhaps<br>unintendedly is implying that now more<br>than 2 000 academics on the other side<br>signed a response to this letter written<br>by Auckland covered researchers Sean<br>hendy and Sushi Wales who you all know<br>of of course<br>this later characterized their<br>colleagues views as ignoring the fact<br>that Colonial colonization racism<br>misogyny and Eugenics have each been<br>championed by scientists wielding a<br>self-declared monopoly on universal<br>knowledge they categorically rejected<br>the uh letter writers assumptions<br>and their core assumption that<br>traditional knowledge should not be<br>taught alongside or in the science class<br>at all the Royal Society of New Zealand<br>which as I've just mentioned also<br>investigated Garth Cooper responded to<br>reject the letters narrow and outmoded<br>definition of Science and as I say uh<br>having just got a little ahead of my uh<br>my bullet points here initiated in an<br>investigation of two of the letter<br>writers one of which was Garth Cooper<br>I think it's fair to say no matter which<br>side of the debate one falls on and I'm<br>not going to uh<br>I'm not going to dissect it in great<br>detail but I think it's it's one of<br>those fault on both sides kind of things<br>and I'm not sure that anyone came out of<br>it looking terribly good<br>um<br>from afar Richard Dawkins<br>UK evolutionary biologist controversial<br>advocate for science over religion and<br>more recently<br>um very strong proponent of<br>controversial views on gender and<br>sexuality wrote to the Royal Society of<br>New Zealand decrying the quote ludicrous<br>move to incorporate Maori ways of<br>knowing into science curricula in New<br>Zealand Dawkins was pretty adamant no<br>indigenous myths from anywhere in the<br>world no matter how poetic or hauntingly<br>beautiful belong in science classes<br>science classes are emphatically not the<br>right place to teach scientific<br>falsehoods alongside true science<br>now in terms of that debate I've made my<br>own contribution and here it is in 2021<br>which was recognized<br>by national including Maori press send<br>to a certain extent internationally<br>and<br>um<br>this reflects the fact this was a few<br>months before the letter writers and<br>this reflects the fact that discussions<br>about science and mataranga were<br>going on in our society for quite some<br>time certainly from the beginning of the<br>so what I'm going to do today is not<br>just to respond to the 2021 letter<br>writers although I guess that's my<br>primary focus in the first instance but<br>to look at the larger issue<br>and to assess what an effect if you'll<br>excuse the philosophical terminology the<br>epistemological question of a scientific<br>value in nature of mataranga<br>and doing so from the perspective of<br>archeology the anthropological science<br>of the material human past<br>now the science theme I'm going to touch<br>on and and Tim alluded to it in his<br>remarks concerns<br>um<br>Agricultural Science specifically the<br>adaptation of tropical Polynesian crops<br>to their southern limits of productivity<br>here in temperate climate<br>a remarkable Agronomy of the pre-modern<br>world<br>now as those of you who have been taught<br>by me will recall whenever I um set an<br>essay question or comment on essay<br>questions I always tell students to make<br>sure that they Define their terminology<br>so I need to walk the talk myself here<br>so let's firstly Define science from the<br>Oxford reference website fairly<br>respectable place<br>suggesting that science encompasses the<br>systematic study of the structure and<br>behavior of the physical and natural<br>ovanga is defined briefly by the online<br>and authoritative Maori dictionary as<br>knowledge wisdom understanding skill<br>traditional knowledge wisdom<br>understanding skill sometimes used in<br>the plural<br>University of Auckland geologist Daniel<br>hikaroa of anati maniapoto who is<br>as well as being a a<br>scientist someone who is very very<br>interested from his own<br>cultural perspective in investigating<br>the science and mataranga defines Mata<br>rangamari as the pursuit and application<br>of knowledge and understanding of Tito<br>the natural world following a systematic<br>methodology including codified knowledge<br>and a suite of techniques empirical in<br>nature for investigating phenomena<br>acquiring new knowledge and updating and<br>integrating previous knowledge<br>now I will just observe in passing that<br>that's not necessarily a definition of<br>matauranga that certainly my komata who<br>who taught me in the 20th century would<br>necessarily have gone to or even be<br>necessarily comfortable with I think<br>it's fair to say that what Daniel<br>hikarua has done here is to Define and<br>perhaps even redefine mataranga so that<br>it is seen to be uh a dynamic body of<br>knowledge that grows and develops in<br>ways that may seem to be your approach<br>science and that perhaps can be seen if<br>I just flick back to our definition of<br>science from Oxford the systematic study<br>of the structure and behavior of the<br>physical and natural world through<br>observation I think it's fair to say<br>that Daniel hikarua is providing A New<br>Perspective a new insight if you like on<br>what mataranga may be considered or<br>could be considered<br>so I'm talking about Agronomy in<br>aotearoa both archeology and the<br>mataranga or mataraka of agronomy<br>the background here is that the first<br>Polynesian Settlers of aotearo amitoa<br>Panama of our archipelago<br>brought six tropical crops from the<br>Central Pacific<br>now these crops included two trees they<br>included good or Hui and three root<br>crops and it's those root crops that<br>will be of my of my primary folk my<br>primary focus today they include firstly<br>the semi-aquatic tarot colocasia<br>escalenta which has edible corms and an<br>edible leaf and it often grows in<br>Wetlands such as shown here in the upper<br>right of the slide in Rarotonga<br>there is dry Asia Pacific yam or oofi<br>diascaria species the<br>the Genesis species grown here was<br>almost certainly diascaria alata which<br>is grown for edible tubers and finally<br>but by no means least there is the Hardy<br>although wet sensitive American sweet<br>potato kumara<br>batatas which has edible tuberous roots<br>the leaves are occasionally eaten too<br>sometimes and it's growing in Mounds<br>interestingly of those crops to are<br>American<br>of course as I just indicated and Hui<br>and that has<br>uh led to considerable speculation over<br>many years about possible contact<br>between Polynesia and the Americas it's<br>a fascinating area but one that<br>unfortunately we don't have any time to<br>visit at all tonight but I'll simply<br>just acknowledge it in power saying that<br>that's kind of an interesting area<br>itself and that the most one of the most<br>important and staple crops of Maori was<br>American rather than Asia Pacific Taro<br>or ufi which we're growing but had a<br>much more restricted range and were more<br>difficult to produce in aotearoa<br>we're basically agriculture<br>involves seasonal production and this<br>stimulated the development of<br>underground storage pits<br>for routes that were kept for both<br>consumption and also as seed crop to be<br>planted out in the following year<br>field evidence of adaptive kumara<br>cultivation<br>includes Earth Stones Earth and stone<br>lines and mounds for borders wind<br>shelters perhaps planting beds<br>soils were also modified extensively as<br>in this profile from the Waimea Plains<br>and Nelson by sand and gravel additions<br>that improved both drainage and thermal<br>qualities all of these techniques or<br>many of these techniques were devoted to<br>and<br>targeted towards improving the warmth of<br>the soil for these tropical crops<br>now while this evidence of kumara<br>cultivation is fairly widespread and in<br>many cases not difficult to identify<br>evidence of Taro in aotearoa has been<br>much more difficult to find or agree on<br>and that's where we're going to turn now<br>this is my Northern example obviously<br>in 1922 surveyor DM Wilson published on<br>what he called Old drains that had<br>become visible on Rich alluvial soils of<br>the so-called kaitaia swamp in the far<br>north at the base of the Opera Peninsula<br>extending from Lake tangonge which you<br>can see there on the in the map to<br>awanui River<br>these old drains were most noticeable in<br>that portion south of Lake tangong<br>Wilson wrote he mapped a section of the<br>old drains at pokepoto where they had<br>been recognized in Land Development 40<br>years earlier by a farming family who<br>Wilson noted had no knowledge of their<br>existence before starting drainage<br>operations<br>the editor of the journal pollen of the<br>Polynesian society in which Wilson<br>published his article surmised that<br>these old drains were cut for the<br>cultivation of Taro in a moist soil if<br>you'll recall as I indicated Taro is a<br>semi-aquatic and grows in<br>damp or wet soils needs to grow in<br>relatively damper wet soils and is well<br>suited to wit proper wet cultivation as<br>well growing in pond fields<br>just as well to note the significance of<br>this archeology in 1921 Wilson also<br>described a very interesting carving<br>which had been discovered during these<br>draining operations reportedly hidden in<br>the canal submerged between the level of<br>the kaitaia swamp for a very<br>considerable period And this is the now<br>famous kaitaia carving that many of you<br>will be well aware of sometimes referred<br>to as tangong itself after the name of<br>the lake it is a highly significant town<br>of tidalua and it may well preserve an<br>early carving style<br>and I think it's<br>quite cool to note here given that we're<br>talking about these Wetland drains that<br>it was found in one of these drains<br>now through the 20th century draining<br>operations continued in the kaitaia<br>region and aerial photographs revealed<br>further its remains of ancient<br>engineered engineered Wetland fields<br>that had been constructed on a large<br>scale covering tens of hectares<br>unfortunately mostly destroyed now in<br>pastoralism<br>now my own field work in the far north<br>has certainly I've visited these places<br>and localities tried to find out as much<br>as I can about them but in terms of<br>excavation field work primarily I've<br>been working to the north of kaitaia on<br>the opening Peninsula on the<br>Northwestern margins of motutangi swamp<br>which until the last couple of decades<br>was the largest intact area<br>of wetland ditches but also is now<br>largely destroyed in 21st century<br>agriculture I will just note in passing<br>whether I should or not but I will say<br>that this<br>experience with these ditches and<br>watching their Destruction has been one<br>of the great disappointments of my<br>professional career I've worked with<br>historic places and have tried to<br>advocate for the protection and<br>preservation of these places<br>unfortunately they've continued to be<br>destroyed and in the most recent<br>iteration basically have been the this<br>last fairly intact area has been<br>destroyed uh for or in the interests of<br>avocado production the heritage of New<br>Zealand<br>act such as it is protects all<br>archaeological sites but that protection<br>is in effect because it is blanket<br>protection only works by becoming an<br>effect regulated destruction it's<br>actually very hard to actually protect<br>or preserve anything old anything<br>Heritage in aotearoa unfortunately and<br>in the case as I say of motutangi I've<br>watched basically is these systems have<br>basically been destroyed for guacamole<br>which has been as I say rather hard to<br>uh to deal with<br>these photographs are taken<br>gosh probably 15 years ago now as I<br>began working in motutungi and you can<br>see uh<br>who is this pointer that you can see the<br>ditch systems here which are capturing<br>water and aquifers and Springs at the<br>base of these Dunes behind 90 Mile Beach<br>so that that water reticulates out over<br>Low Land<br>slopes and here's what the ditches look<br>like an excavation<br>They Carried water across those gentle<br>slopes from Main ditches into reticulate<br>Networks<br>and this is not multutungi this is<br>Rarotonga but this is field work in 2010<br>where I basically went in search of what<br>I was digging up at motutungi to try and<br>find what<br>I might have been dealing with in terms<br>of contemporary practices and these are<br>raised bed fields for thorough in<br>Rarotonga and I think this is the kind<br>of thing that we're looking at in<br>motutangi<br>radiocarbon evidence admittedly from<br>relatively undifferentiated Dutch Phil<br>suggests that the one of the critical<br>networks functioned between the 16th to<br>17th century CE more and better dates<br>are needed and in fact I've actually I'm<br>now working on some materials some short<br>life material that will provide that<br>chronology I'm pleased to say or at<br>least a better improved chronology but<br>even with those earlier dates you can<br>see that we're dealing with pre-modern<br>systems<br>to mentioned micro Botanical remains I<br>began working in the early 2000s with a<br>botanist from the University of Auckland<br>who's now working independently Mark<br>Horrocks and Mark identified<br>starch granules Reserve starch granules<br>which are characteristic of seeds as<br>well as underground storage organs<br>excavated from sediments or excuse me<br>extracted from excavated sediments from<br>one of the primary archaeological sites<br>to see if we could identify the<br>cultogens that had been grown in those<br>soils since then my M.A student Rebecca<br>Benham has done further work and these<br>slides here A and B come from Rebecca's<br>very fine work in a recently submitted<br>EMA thesis<br>these enclosed messes of small granules<br>each less than four microns that 20<br>shouldn't be there that should just say<br>less than four microns so they're really<br>really small characteristic of Taro and<br>in the lower part of the slide a you can<br>see a thorough reference granule<br>um as well as Taro we found evidence of<br>ufi which was very exciting uh Dias<br>Korea alata yam which we believe have<br>been or had been grown in higher drier<br>areas between the ditches<br>um because they're not a yam is not a<br>wetland crop you can see the distinctive<br>starch granules both from my work with<br>Mark on the left and then Rebecca's work<br>confirming the starch granules on the<br>right yam granules are very large there<br>are elongates they're<br>they have an eccentric Center or hilum<br>and uh quite distinctive so there really<br>isn't any doubt that these are Dias<br>Korea<br>but interestingly we also found sweet<br>potato which uh we didn't or at least if<br>I'm away or I should say more accurately<br>uh the genus<br>um which however<br>um given that the only other native in<br>the area grows on the coast and not<br>Inland is most likely to be epamoria<br>patatus and these references these<br>archaeological examples a to e show a<br>distinctive center with a fissure<br>that is characteristic of many granules<br>of sweet potato between 7 and 30 to 40<br>microns along they're also faceted f and<br>g show reference examples<br>now<br>let's return to tone to poke portal<br>and talk about mataranga so<br>um<br>I've given a somewhat emotional tribute<br>and recognition to Ross Gregory and uh<br>and this whakatoki which Ross shared<br>with me many years ago waikato and<br>others have published since in 2016<br>is in the first instance<br>an indication of the<br>encoding of the history of Taro in<br>this traditional form<br>when the wind blows the leaves undulate<br>and ripple<br>now bear in mind that in the 19th<br>century Europeans were not aware of the<br>fact that there had been tarot fields in<br>the tangong area that was something that<br>um<br>people Europeans non-maori started to<br>appreciate with drainage operations but<br>among hapu among whanau of terrar<br>there were and are important<br>mataranga important Traditions important<br>whakatoki such as the<br>katoki that recall<br>and remember in the land and in the<br>landscape the photograph I've shown you<br>obviously is not of from tangonge it's<br>irrigated Taro in Rarotonga but it it<br>may kind of<br>um illustrate perhaps the the effect of<br>the thorough leaves that may undulate<br>and ripple for anyone interested in<br>Terrell let me just note in passing as<br>well that that word which is a northern<br>word for undulation or Ripple is not a<br>word you're going to find in the Maori<br>dictionary waikato tells me that it is a<br>local word probably to the locality and<br>is an example of a number of words that<br>a number of kupu that one Encounters in<br>and across the Motu that represent<br>Regional differentiation so I just want<br>to acknowledge that in terms of that<br>whakatoki<br>so these ditches as I say were not<br>functioning or not knowing generally at<br>the time of 19th century settlement<br>which raises the question what happened<br>to them well according to Wilson one old<br>Maori told Mr Stewart Masters who'd<br>first drained the land that the drains<br>were of Maori origin the natives had<br>numerous ill wears across them this is<br>obviously<br>1920s European scholar language and a<br>big flood came down from the hills and<br>the Weirs blocked up the drains holding<br>the wash they were never cleared and so<br>the system fell into Decay now this is<br>mediated through two different sources<br>from<br>Mr Stuart Masters through to Wilson<br>um so I'm not suggesting that we have<br>here a pristine account but what we do<br>have at least is an account that seems<br>to suggest that flooding may have had<br>something to do with the demise of these<br>systems<br>and this tradition implicates another<br>body of law involving very important<br>Northern tipuna including Kodi and<br>ruacherepeti as well as the iwi and<br>natiawa who were said to be resident in<br>the far north in many accounts and the<br>version I'm going to select<br>to illustrate the kaurira kedepete<br>account comes from Wilson because he<br>collected it from hapu at poki portal<br>but there are a number of other accounts<br>some of which vary in in some details<br>according to Wilson about eight<br>Generations ago kaitaia Chief Rua<br>kurapete lived at kaitaia with his hapu<br>and a chief called Coley live de<br>poquipoto these two quarreled pity<br>dagger drain from the kaitaia river<br>to a fierce stream that runs into Lake<br>tangonge the kaitaia river becomes large<br>in times of flood and diverts into the<br>lake which spreads its banks at pukepoto<br>and in this account<br>this event flooded Cody and his hapu out<br>destroying their plantations<br>Cody then conceived the idea of digging<br>a drain from the kaitaya swamped to the<br>sea but that was unsuccessful and<br>thereafter left pukepoto<br>now<br>at this point in time let's bring in<br>some environmental some contemporary<br>environmental science and in particular<br>the work of Andrew Laurie and other<br>climate scientists who have been looking<br>at what they call the so-called little<br>Ice Age which is a global climate<br>phenomenon that in the northern<br>hemisphere has been<br>identified to about 1350 1400 it may<br>it's Advent in the south is still a<br>subject of some debate but Laurie and<br>others have suggested that we do see<br>evidence of climate cooling down here in<br>the South coincident with the little ice<br>age and note<br>um<br>the interval post 1500 CE to the onset<br>of the 20th century was typified by more<br>frequent cold and wet conditions that is<br>coarsely characterized as the<br>counterpart to the little Ice Age the<br>conditions were likely influenced by<br>more frequent trough in zonal synoptic<br>weather regimes<br>now<br>my suggestion is that this little ice<br>age and in fact increased rainfall May<br>potentially be relevant to these<br>references these traditional mataranga<br>and historical references to Low Land<br>flooding and subsequent relocation<br>they may well reflect an increased<br>rainfall of the later Lia and I think<br>one only has to look at the events of<br>earlier this year in terms of the rain<br>in both the Bay of Plenty and in the<br>Surrey region in the far north to see<br>what rain can do as a result of concept<br>of climate change in the destruction of<br>crops so these are not just matters of<br>historical climate interpretation alone<br>they relate potentially to long-term<br>climate modeling and that might well be<br>critical to understand modern climate<br>change<br>now my second case study as I've<br>indicated is local<br>uh<br>down here in tiwaponamu by 1600 CE the<br>or in the southern variation katimamoy<br>had migrated to te awapanamu to settle<br>among resident waitahoe people and<br>subsequently tahu<br>Southern variant kaita who migrated from<br>the same region to settle most of the<br>waipu novel<br>in the archeology of early settlement in<br>the South murihiku a term which I'm<br>using following a traditional<br>usage which is to consider the larger<br>region of the far south including otago<br>and the area known as Southland as<br>murihiku we see settlements based around<br>large self-sufficient but short-lived<br>Coastal papakaika this is the so-called<br>transient Village model argued by some<br>of our colleagues Anderson and Smith and<br>these Villages are situated as you might<br>expect in River mouths and estuaries<br>rich places where lots of food is<br>available lots of marine and other foods<br>are available<br>with the loss of MOA and diminishment of<br>seal colonies over time shellfish and<br>thin fish became more important<br>economically however<br>also to acknowledge in terms of<br>terrestrial resources<br>the New Zealand cabbage tree quarterly<br>in Australis was encouraged on Forest<br>margins and clearings it was possibly<br>planted it's sweet stems and rhizomes<br>were steamed and consumed for fructose<br>now<br>the question of crops in the South or<br>not is a really intriguing one the<br>Orthodoxy the archaeological Orthodoxy<br>certainly the Orthodoxy<br>um that uh that I was trained on if you<br>like<br>um is that<br>it was not possible to either store uh<br>to grow little to store a little and<br>grow crops south of tomotu just south of<br>banks Peninsula<br>Hardy non-live kumara known as cow which<br>shown here on the right of the slide<br>these this is coal that I've prepared<br>myself<br>that's acknowledged in a number of<br>accounts but<br>live kumara Roots<br>according to the Orthodoxy were not<br>stored or grown further<br>south of banks peninsula<br>now in the early uh<br>part of this Century which makes me<br>sound really old<br>I had the great pleasure of working with<br>my colleague Richard Walter running a<br>field school at purako Nui Inlet with<br>the support of as I say katihuirapa and<br>the purakanui blocking Corporation as we<br>excavated an eroding midden site now the<br>site had been excavated previously and<br>interpreted as a specialist fishing and<br>shell fishing settlement and indeed the<br>midden was dominated by fish Makar<br>Hawker local shellfish<br>and MOA and sealer elements were<br>relatively sparse which was consistent<br>with the 15th century chronology<br>revealed in our radiocarbon work there's<br>an in-situ oven at the base of the<br>midden that we excavated<br>now<br>as well as midden which we expected to<br>find we also found petsorua between in<br>situ midden layers which I have<br>continued working on and have<br>interpreted as storage facilities in the<br>earliest of these are dated very very<br>securely and tightly on short life<br>material excavated below and in the fill<br>of the pit to around the mid 15th<br>century in a Bayesian model to mention<br>to Bayesian modeling I won't um I won't<br>um<br>derail the presentation by talking about<br>radiocarbon modeling in Bayesian stats<br>although Richard Barker is here perhaps<br>I should<br>um no actually Richard Baker is here I<br>shouldn't<br>um uh but sophista note that<br>um uh that we have a very secure<br>chronology for these pits between 1430<br>and 1460 CE<br>now what's really cool is that uh and it<br>took quite a bit of time for me to<br>convince myself of this because it just<br>seems so extraordinary that the<br>dimensions and rectangular form of these<br>covered pits and we know they're covered<br>because as you can see from the<br>archaeological plan here there are post<br>holes around the sides follow the exact<br>template of seasonal Maori ruakumara<br>uh now this interpretation was<br>strengthened by the recovery of<br>archaeological starch granules these<br>were identified at first by my colleague<br>Mark Horrocks and then in the course of<br>a Marsden investigation Monica Trump who<br>I think is here uh did some very fine<br>work as well to continue to look at<br>these sediments and to find indeed<br>starch granules that<br>as at motutangi certainly looked very<br>much like epemoria the genus and you<br>don't get a native of bubble we are down<br>here so if if you're accepting that<br>these granules are open where then there<br>can only be if<br>a sweet potato<br>so finding puts in the exact form of<br>ruakumara finding starch granules that<br>closely resembled the starch granules of<br>ipamawia I suggest is is a pretty pretty<br>provides a pretty compelling argument<br>for what is basically polynesia's<br>southernmost ruakumara the southernmost<br>storage of live kumara and they have to<br>be live cumula rather than coal<br>you you wouldn't dig pits you don't need<br>to dig pits for Carl you dig pits to<br>basically preserve and keep your live<br>kumara roots<br>um actually at this point in time I<br>should probably introduce my little<br>friend here who I've brought since I've<br>brought this kumara plant along I think<br>I was going to talk about that plant a<br>little a little um earlier on uh when I<br>mentioned archaeological orthodoxies<br>against the Orthodoxy that kumara<br>doesn't grow down here that's a cumula<br>plant<br>um so please don't tell them that he's<br>not supposed to be growing here<br>um so growing very successfully uh at um<br>just to illustrate the point really<br>now um we proposed my colleague<br>Tom higham who undertook some pretty<br>flesh Bayesian statistical analysis for<br>our paper we published in 2021 that the<br>introduction of this technology to put a<br>canoe in the earlier 15th century from a<br>warmer aotearoa region may have been<br>stimulated by Local socio-economic<br>Economic impacts of megaphone or loss<br>which is basically a flash way or a<br>rather complex way of saying that once<br>the more and seal were gone people were<br>looking for other ways to basically get<br>their food<br>now we argued further that this<br>archaeological evidence can be related<br>to important Southern mataraka that's<br>the<br>Southern form of mataranga around kumera<br>and the E there is deliberate that's the<br>southern form of kumara kumera is the<br>southern form in murihiku<br>multiple katimame<br>identify an ancestor a tipuna by the<br>name of rongo or in the southern<br>dialects uh<br>and he is associated with a widespread<br>Narrative of kumara Origins so in the<br>Northeast<br>and in other forms in the Southeast Roku<br>itoa<br>in<br>the<br>Southern form uh and actually in many of<br>the northern accounts from Hawaii visits<br>the original people of aotearoa who are<br>kahui or Tui people<br>and those people offer him local plant<br>Foods he declines and instead he<br>rehydrates his dried kumara or Coral<br>from Hawaii offers it to the aotearoa<br>people who are so impressed they send<br>Waka back to Source live Hawaii kumara<br>now in the northern traditions<br>these Waka that go back to Hawaii return<br>very generously provisioned with kumara<br>which they plant out at several<br>locations<br>but in the southern accounts<br>the crop establishment was unimpressive<br>if not unsuccessful for example in one<br>murihiku version return the returning<br>Waka Manuka failed to produce the the<br>kumara from that Waka failed to produce<br>rotting on the ground because according<br>to the account the required karakia was<br>neglected<br>and in a further very widespread<br>Southern account specific to naikahu the<br>Waka uru returned to lose its Kumar<br>cargo overboard and Taro and Hui in some<br>accounts in stormy seas off moiraki<br>North otago before wrecking on the coast<br>of it's now uh the the coast which now<br>takes its traditional name so in<br>Tradition the otago coastline is<br>in 1844 local Maori identified those<br>lost cumada from araiti uru to Walter<br>mantel as globular North otago Beach<br>boulders<br>now here one might identify<br>superficially a clash between science<br>and mathuranga because in geology these<br>Bowlers are spherical<br>septarian concretions within a paleocene<br>mudstone take a deep breath exposed by<br>wave erosion<br>the Maori account<br>um<br>obviously is very different but if that<br>account is seen to reference cultural<br>and environmental history rather than a<br>geology then the spilled crops I suggest<br>inform uniquely if in a novel symbolic<br>way on early Southern attempts to<br>establish kumara against a climatic and<br>Botanical science reality that this is<br>very challenging in the far south<br>now other traditions in the South also<br>suggest that the challenge was overcome<br>in some warm localities at least<br>specifically<br>which of course is such an important<br>place to katihuirapa and I acknowledge<br>that and their manner over that place uh<br>in the hudi hour on the holy hour<br>peninsula of the waikawaiti river mouth<br>named for the ariki tuera but also the<br>place of an earlier katimae parasite<br>account recorded by John White describes<br>a Siege at this ancient power where<br>and as that<br>Sage<br>took place those who were attacking the<br>managed to get access to the par and<br>stole Roku nuiato<br>and to honor his missing Artur the<br>tohunga of the par according to White's<br>account cleared a small space to<br>resemble a cultivation on which Mounds<br>were made like those for a ritual kumara<br>garden and after this real cool returned<br>now there's a really intriguing another<br>intriguing Association I I didn't make<br>this Association of my paper<br>um this is new<br>um between the orokonui valley which is<br>situated very close to purakanui and of<br>course you local folk will know the<br>orokinui Nature Reserve<br>olokunui is the southern form of which<br>describes the 28th 9th of the month in<br>the mave calendar and as Elston best<br>observed this was a specially favored<br>one for planting the kumara doubtless<br>of fast bread Polynesian Fame<br>just another one of a number of<br>connections between kupu places accounts<br>and kumara<br>now<br>a later and more famous Siege recorded<br>at parakeet evolving to wear himself by<br>his relative tawaka in the 18th century<br>uh also has an account of anatua<br>kahukura stolen during the siege that<br>also returns in response to karakiya<br>just like Roku nuiato and interestingly<br>kahukura is associated traditionally<br>with romanuiato and also with kumara as<br>a source from Hawaii as one who brought<br>the kumara from Hawaii and he's also<br>considered a kumara Ottawa and some<br>Northern accounts<br>as a rainbow deity and crosses the<br>rainbow bringing kumara with him to<br>aotearoa<br>in the 1930s naitahu account<br>recorded by Carrington the journalist<br>Carrington<br>authorities told Carrington that to wear<br>his paw was stocked with quote Fern root<br>kumara and potted Bird and Fish against<br>oka's Siege a further or another<br>independent account by Carwin in 1906<br>drawing on local Maori sources also<br>interestingly though these called<br>these stories of old from hurayawa are<br>the only late murihiku kumuda traditions<br>of record<br>so what happened to the ruakumara of<br>purakanui and why<br>for later Southern kumara restricted to<br>a single warm north of cargo locality<br>here I want to suggest again or ask the<br>question at least whether these Southern<br>Cordero and mataraka may also track<br>impacts of cooler temperatures incident<br>potentially or possibly the Ally the<br>little Ice Age may have precipitated<br>production and Supply failures from<br>wherever newly vulnerable 15th to 16th<br>century Southern Horticultural margins<br>may have been<br>the other question to ask is whether<br>adverse Lia weather events impacted bulk<br>kumara root transfer to murihiku by Waka<br>upset May well recall some of those or<br>may recall such an event<br>now whatever the answers to those<br>questions and I don't pretend to have<br>them nor am I pretending I should<br>absolutely<br>um uh say here in fact I should have<br>said it before but I'm not in any way<br>suggesting that I'm an expert in these<br>mataraka the Mana authority of these<br>matalaka belong to iwi not to me to<br>hapufano<br>and I'm simply exploring connections<br>with their consent and support<br>just simply to to continue a<br>conversation and to seek to uh<br>enrich<br>our local archeology<br>so whatever the answers to those<br>questions are having established I hope<br>that I'm not pretending to be the<br>authority on this<br>the reality is that the archaeological<br>discovery of Rua at purakanui is without<br>question associated with a coastline<br>and with kaitahu katimamoy and waitahoe<br>accounts that I haven't really had time<br>to go into and kupu words that recall<br>ancient kumara loss as well as more<br>limited presence in these mataraka in<br>archaeological science are complementary<br>I would suggest and together enrich the<br>past the Hui of these knowledge sets<br>points to the novel of environmental<br>history into the fabric of mataranga and<br>that underscores an argument that<br>mataranga encodes invaluable<br>experiential knowledge that should<br>inform modern scientific understanding<br>in education in aotearoa and it also<br>highlights the potential for indigenous<br>knowledge to contribute to Urgent<br>climate change and sustainability<br>studies a potential underscored by the<br>reality that it is extractive Western<br>ideologies Technologies and science that<br>have now brought the world to the brink<br>of global catastrophe thank you<br>I have the great pleasure is the PVC of<br>the division of humanities to present a<br>vote of thanks to Ian and in doing so I<br>have to confess I'm a mere law professor<br>so rather out of my depth and secondly<br>that I wanted to make a couple of<br>observations that I think<br>stand back from what he's saying<br>that commenting for what he's doing and<br>so the first one I guess springboards<br>off the fact that I stand here as a<br>representative division of humanities<br>when we've heard a fascinating IPL<br>entitled archeology in the mataranga<br>science debate and what does that say<br>about where we stick our archeology in<br>the university is it is it does it<br>belong in the Sciences or is it in fact<br>at home in the humanities and I think<br>Ian's address to us shows beautifully<br>why it is both and why the question<br>isn't a relevant one and that what he's<br>done is does is to take scientific<br>methods and scientific thought to show<br>us how they reveal the way that humans<br>interact with the world around them in<br>the past now and potentially in the<br>future how we understand our world and<br>in so doing shed like on our ancestors<br>and what they knew and thought and what<br>their Lifestyles were like so thank you<br>thank you Ian for doing that and thank<br>you that you have shown us that the<br>questions around where we<br>locate our beings of knowledge is<br>irrelevant and what's far more important<br>is the questions around why and how our<br>research matter and I think you<br>demonstrated tonight why that why your<br>research matters and the second<br>observation I want to make and it it<br>flows from that first one I suppose<br>is that I think Ian's research and his<br>um his life work in a sense demonstrates<br>the life-giving in reconciliating role<br>that I think an academic can have<br>between xiaomori and sial pakiha between<br>matarang Maori in matadanga pakia and at<br>a time in this nation where that<br>connection and that relationship and<br>interaction is so sorely needed<br>the answer to debates about knowledge<br>and validity<br>is simply to get on and do the May and<br>that's what you've done Ian so I want to<br>thank you for that I want to recognize<br>that that's been years in the making and<br>much of that takes time to invest in<br>relationships and to learn about a<br>culture that isn't necessarily your own<br>to embrace uh whakafanongatanga and in<br>real humility and you've done that in<br>spades<br>I want to say thank you to you for doing<br>that and thank you for giving us a<br>glimpse tonight into what that hard Mahi<br>can do for us as a nation and the<br>benefit of that work can do for us I<br>also want to use<br>um this vote of thanks<br>as a little bit of a platform and a<br>platform that I think Ian would<br>appreciate and that is that when I Was<br>preparing for this fight of things I<br>also had earlier in the day come across<br>my inbox<br>um a recent um piece in etangata which<br>is a summarized version of a more<br>extended version and it's the piece by<br>um Tara McAllister called 50 reasons<br>there are no Maori in your science<br>department and I thought um I know Ian<br>will appreciate this because it's<br>effectively the part two or the response<br>to<br>um you know the listener The Listener<br>five gang and she lists a whole bunch of<br>reasons why we struggle in this<br>relationship between Marty and Pacquiao<br>and Science and they're very good<br>reasons and it's sober in reading and<br>it's something that we as citizens of an<br>institution like this need to spend time<br>reflecting on and thinking about but it<br>struck me as I read them that Ian is one<br>of those treasured people in this<br>University who is stepping out on that<br>journey and trying to do it well and<br>with integrity and there were there were<br>three reasons in particular that I want<br>to read out from Tara and I think she<br>has absolutely a point but I want to use<br>it in the reverse here and say here are<br>three reasons<br>that<br>that Ian has has in his work tried so<br>hard to push against and to give voice<br>to tell molding so here they are<br>reasons why there are no Maori in your<br>science department<br>number three turu because your<br>department is full of Dusty dinosaurs<br>who don't believe our tipu in our tip in<br>a new science<br>I think Ian showed us that he absolutely<br>does believe that our team<br>knew science fully well<br>because we don't want to help you<br>superficially gain access to Maori<br>communities and knowledge when your<br>intentions are ambiguous at best<br>do you know who stolen land you're<br>standing on have you read decolonizing<br>methodologies do you understand the<br>stories of our people<br>Ian thank you thank you for taking the<br>time to understand the stories of Maori<br>and to give voice to them<br>and third one<br>it's number nine in her list because our<br>whakapapa in bodies will not be used<br>superficially to tick your vision mat<br>along a box only to have our ideas and<br>bodies swiftly discarded and disregarded<br>when the cash money comes in<br>and Ian's research has gained<br>significant Grant monies and<br>congratulations for that<br>and yes that's not why he does it and it<br>is about what Tara is asking for that we<br>won't superficially use the whakapapa<br>and bodies of our Maori colleagues and<br>friends and family but that we will<br>listen to them and that we will learn to<br>understand what they tell us about<br>science and knowledge so Bravo Ian<br>the university is is making progress on<br>this some would say slowly and I<br>understand that and appreciate that and<br>I thank you Ian that you stepped out and<br>been someone who's who's believed in in<br>that important part of what Academia<br>could do your whole career so Bravo to<br>you I think it's really important in<br>addition to commending Ian for that to<br>commend those Maori communities<br>that have agreed to partner with Ian and<br>so I want to thank those of you who are<br>here from Katie katihuirapa and from um<br>I don't know anyone from tadarawa in<br>person with us but certainly hopefully<br>online and I think Maui is joining us<br>online from um the kuhu representing<br>moriordi thank you so much is someone on<br>behalf of the University leadership I<br>want to say thank you thank for your for<br>your patience with us thank you for<br>partnering with Ian<br>um and and thank you for continuing to<br>believe that research and academic<br>research can make a difference so thank<br>it's I have the great pleasure now to<br>pass over this we<br>gift which was is a small Memento for<br>this occasion thank you and more<br>importantly for your achievement so<br>congratulations<br>thank you<br>thank you<br>and finally to all of you who are here<br>with us in person<br>thank you so much for coming and those<br>of you who are online thank you very<br>much for watching whether it's now or<br>later uh hide in my for those who are<br>here please come with us to have some<br>some food and some hospitality and some<br>whakafunangatanga we are moving over<br>from here to the staff Club we're in the<br>ground floor this time around and can I<br>please encourage you to come I know it's<br>another two or three minutes walk but<br>it's worth it because there's food and<br>and and friendly faces there so thank<br>okay</p></main><footer style="margin-top: 2rem; background: #0001; padding: 2rem; text-align: center;"><p>We Are The University</p><ul style="list-style-type: none;
