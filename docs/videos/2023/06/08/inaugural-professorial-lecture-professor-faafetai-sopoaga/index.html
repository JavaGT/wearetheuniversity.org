belong to my family<br>and my family belongs to me<br>I belong to my Village<br>and my Village belongs to me<br>I belong to my nation<br>and my nation belongs to me<br>that is the very essence of my sense of<br>belonging<br>words of wisdom<br>from His Highness for my head of state<br>of Samoa<br>foreign<br>it is not I that has enabled me to be<br>here today<br>it is not I that is responsible for<br>these achievements<br>it is by the grace of God<br>and the prayers and the aspirations of<br>our ancestors our parents our<br>communities and the support of many that<br>I'm able to stand here today<br>I know I know that those who are no<br>longer with us<br>are here with us today in spirit<br>I carry the Mana of my family of our<br>people of our communities<br>our cultural Traditions have been passed<br>down through the generations through<br>stories so today I will be weaving<br>stories<br>throughout this presentation<br>dare to be wise<br>dare to succeed<br>dare to care<br>specific aspirations in aotearoa<br>dare to be wise<br>the fear of God is the beginning of<br>wisdom<br>I grew up in a small island<br>that I call the pearl of the Pacific<br>Samoa<br>it's the first country to gain<br>independence in the Pacific and the only<br>country that has a treaty of Friendship<br>with New Zealand<br>there was no University there so one had<br>to leave<br>Samoa<br>for further education After High School<br>I was granted a scholarship from the<br>government of Samoa under the New<br>Zealand Aid to come to New Zealand to<br>study medicine with the purpose of<br>returning to serve Samoa<br>it was an exciting time<br>to travel to a new country<br>I knew very little about New Zealand<br>in fact in summer college I was taught<br>more about Asia about China about the<br>travel down spent a year in Timaru girls<br>high before coming down here to do the<br>medical intermediate the equivalent of<br>the Health Sciences first year program<br>today<br>I was 16 and excited<br>I can finally make my own decisions<br>without my parents<br>become my own person and find my place<br>in my first year at University<br>I was struck down by a mystery illness<br>it drained the life out of me<br>following three months of Investigations<br>my rheumatologist said to me Professor<br>Palmer that I had s-l-e<br>systemic lupus erythematosis lupus he<br>said<br>mint wolf<br>I felt scared<br>following a detailed explanation of what<br>it was the treatment and the prognosis<br>my world crumpled around me<br>I had missed many months of class and<br>there was no way in which I could catch<br>up and had to return to Samoa<br>depressed<br>at risk of losing my scholarship<br>my hopes of a bright future was<br>shattered<br>prayers and wavering support and love<br>wrapped around me lifted me up out of a<br>I was given the chance to return to<br>otago and I asked Professor Palmer can I<br>study medicine with lupus and he said<br>yes<br>yes you can but you just have to pace<br>yourself<br>so Pace myself<br>my health has since shaped my career<br>pathway and had to learn to trust God In<br>the Journey<br>I worked in Samoa as a junior doctor and<br>when I returned to New Zealand for<br>postgraduate training I was told then<br>that I had bilateral avascular necrosis<br>which means I had two necrotic hips I<br>had lupus nephritis my kidneys weren't<br>happy and my liver functions were a bit<br>of a concern<br>that if I wanted to live long that I<br>needed to stay in New Zealand and look<br>for ways to give back to Samoa<br>additionally I needed to train in an<br>area that my health can support<br>with encouragement from Emeritus<br>Professor Charlotte Paul my mentor<br>and Sir David's gig I took up training<br>in public health<br>their leadership in the department of<br>preventative and social medicine was<br>outstanding<br>Charlotte I know you're watching happy<br>birthday<br>I miss distinct patients though and<br>later took up training in general<br>practice<br>some 15 years ago<br>I was diagnosed with breast cancer<br>following a mastectomy and intensive<br>treatment I could not continue clinical<br>work other opportunities emerged<br>in 2009 I was appointed as Professor<br>Baxter said as the inaugural associate<br>Dean Pacific and how science says by Pro<br>Vice Chancellor Professor Don roperton<br>who is linking in from Australia<br>one of the excellent PVCs that I have<br>the privilege to work under<br>I started in this role while supporting<br>Samoa's response to the devastating<br>tsunami<br>Samos minister of Health requested our<br>University for assistance to support the<br>development of Samoa's National<br>University Medical School<br>Professor Peter Crampton then dean of<br>the otago medical school led a team in<br>response to this and many others have<br>since helped in this place including my<br>clinicians<br>Professor heighten my rheumatologist<br>Professor Walker my nephrologist even my<br>my oncologist associate professor David<br>Perez have all gone to Samoa and<br>provided support<br>I owe a debt<br>for my medical education to the<br>government of Samoa and I was Keen to do<br>all I could to ensure that I can give<br>faculty of medicine assured me<br>that I was indeed helping Samoa from<br>where I am working now<br>the otago medical school is celebrating<br>150 years in 2025.<br>there were few of us Pacific Islanders<br>in my otago medical class<br>I have very few fond memories<br>of my time in medical training<br>the challenging times are the ones one<br>tends to remember the most<br>in a class presentation two weeks before<br>my final fifth year exam in Christchurch<br>a consultant berated me in front of my<br>I felt embarrassed<br>dumb and overwhelmed<br>I went home and cried for five days I<br>decided then that I was not going to sit<br>my my exams my important exams because I<br>didn't want<br>to be in a profession that didn't care<br>for one another<br>Professor Ellen Clark then dean of<br>Christchurch medical school and head of<br>Campus sent for me and I will always be<br>grateful to him<br>in a fatherly way he said to me go wash<br>prepare to sit your exam then come back<br>and see me<br>I passed my exams then came back to see<br>him he smiled and said<br>some people treat this like a game<br>don't let it bother you<br>there is work out there that only you<br>can do<br>the encounter with that consultant who<br>was so memorable that years later during<br>registrar training we were shown a<br>training video with this consultant<br>I reflected over the years thinking<br>there must be a better way to teach<br>medical students than scaring the lights<br>Maori like Pacific people are<br>disproportionately represented in poor<br>health and education outcomes<br>when I was given the opportunity to<br>teach medical students at otago<br>I wondered<br>I wondered whether I could support the<br>training of excellent health<br>professionals equipped to meet the needs<br>of an increasingly diverse Society in<br>aotearoa<br>and to feel scared and vulnerable within<br>the health system<br>experience loss of dignity and at times<br>misunderstood<br>I have experienced racism and treated as<br>illiterate just because I look different<br>from the majority<br>although English is my second language I<br>am fluent<br>and receive excellent education from New<br>Zealand's oldest and finest University<br>I wondered<br>I wondered whether I could support the<br>development and integration of cultural<br>and clinical competence to improve<br>health outcomes for Pacific peoples in<br>aotearoa<br>a vision was born<br>in 2008 a review of the medical<br>curriculum was conducted<br>I had the year off with chemotherapy and<br>when I returned the curriculum was full<br>and there was really no space to teach<br>ah I thought<br>with unwavering faith and the help of<br>the community we developed the Pacific<br>immersion program an opportunity where<br>medical students in Dunedin learn from<br>our community I would like to<br>acknowledge Dean Dr John Adams who<br>enabled the program to be established<br>it is now a required component of<br>learning for all medical students<br>through this opportunity students learn<br>about the context of for our families<br>the things that can make a real<br>difference for them<br>students feedback suggest the learning<br>for them is Meaningful<br>and I quote<br>Frankly Speaking The Experience made me<br>aware of my privilege and the inherent<br>bias that I perceive the world with<br>I've never slept in a cold state house<br>before<br>I've never been exposed to life on the<br>minimum wage<br>yet my host family was so generous and<br>welcoming and proud to be hosting me<br>they experienced encouraged me to<br>maintain an open mind to be curious and<br>respectful<br>when dealing with people from unfamiliar<br>cultures and backgrounds<br>there is no way my learning could have<br>been so deep and transformational<br>had I heard this in the classroom<br>dare to succeed<br>the definition of success from a<br>student's perspective is broader than<br>just academic success<br>one of my research interest is capacity<br>building of the Pacific Health Workforce<br>in New Zealand<br>Tinto a well-known theorist in higher<br>education proposed one of the very first<br>models for Student Success in 1979 the<br>longitudinal model of institutional<br>departure<br>his model outlined the components<br>important to support students Journey<br>retention and the likelihood of them<br>achieving their goals<br>the model has a specific focus on<br>institutional responsibilities<br>pose that the outcomes of persistence or<br>drop out depending on the student's<br>integration with the institution<br>academic and social systems<br>the greater the degree of integration<br>the more likely the student would<br>progress to degree completion<br>in my doctoral research I examined the<br>relevance of tintus model for Pacific<br>students I examined I interviewed 20<br>students over four times over two years<br>and completed 76 out of the 80 possible<br>interviews<br>the analysis of the data showed that all<br>components of tintos model fitted the<br>context of Pacific students however<br>there were additional components<br>important to Pacific students that were<br>not included in tinto's model<br>and these were culture and identity in<br>areas related to their health and<br>well-being their spiritual social<br>physical and mental well-being<br>spiritual well-being for most students<br>was connected to the church and this<br>support was important for them in the<br>tertiary environment<br>from this work mental well-being emerged<br>as a significant concern for students so<br>in 2019 through an HRC Grant we<br>conducted a prospective cohort study to<br>explore the mental well-being of all<br>students starting at the University of<br>otago<br>of the 188 eligible students 77<br>completed at least one survey<br>results in the first year showed that 55<br>percent met the criteria for poor Mental<br>Health<br>and approximately one-fifth reported<br>moderate to severe psychological<br>distress anxiety and depressive symptoms<br>only one third of this group had sought<br>while our efforts to ensure students<br>succeed academically is important their<br>health and well-being is critical to<br>their overall success<br>what has been our response<br>to growing and supporting the Pacific<br>Workforce at the University of otago<br>where is the evidence that we are making<br>our partnership with the Ministry of<br>Health since 2011 has enabled us to<br>establish the purple program the Pacific<br>opportunities program at otago a<br>wraparound support program for students<br>popo has three meaning in the Samoan<br>language depending on how you pronounce<br>it<br>we'll put a coconut ready for planting<br>symbolic of students starting their new<br>Journey<br>for Paul means to nurture the<br>responsibility of the university to<br>nurture support and guide<br>and popo means to capture the<br>responsibility of students to engage<br>with and utilize all of what the<br>university offers<br>growing<br>the Pacific Health Workforce in aotearoa<br>is important to the University of otago<br>we Aspire in our vision 2040 to be a<br>university of the Pacific<br>I acknowledge this is a difficult time<br>you will know the competent Navigator<br>during Stormy Weather<br>our vision includes growing leaders<br>growing our Pacific Health leaders in<br>aotearoa<br>foreign<br>through targeted investment we have seen<br>an increasing Trend in Pacific students<br>successful in entering our Health<br>Sciences program and health professional<br>programs at otago<br>note the decrease during the time of the<br>pandemic<br>this is a time for investment not<br>disinvestment<br>in 2018 we celebrated the 10 intake the<br>proportional representation of Pacific<br>students enter entering our medical<br>program<br>however there is more to do<br>while we celebrated the largest ever<br>cohort of Pacific doctors 28 graduating<br>from the University of otako last year<br>if we are to reach the 10 proportional<br>representation of Pacific doctors in the<br>New Zealand Workforce in 10 years Time<br>by 2032 at the rate current rate<br>we will still have a shortfall of about<br>dare to care<br>a well-known someone saying<br>the pathway to leadership is through<br>service to serve is a privilege<br>leadership is about serving<br>it's about caring<br>the university workload model has a<br>service component which enables<br>engagement with our Pacific communities<br>in New Zealand and the Pacific region<br>Regional conferences the annual heads of<br>health and biennial Ministers of Health<br>meeting in the Pacific are excellent<br>opportunities<br>to listen<br>and engage with leaders and colleagues<br>in the Pacific region we also support<br>our students to engage in this space<br>we explore what might be helpful then<br>share these with our regional partners<br>additionally we invite our regional<br>Partners to visit us here sharing<br>as mentioned I had the opportunity to<br>serve New Zealand as its Health advisor<br>in Samoa during the covet pandemic<br>I'm grateful to New Zealand for the<br>opportunity to study medicine<br>Additionally the New Zealand health<br>system has kept me alive and functional<br>today<br>I'm grateful to orthopedic surgeons like<br>Mr Chin who has given me two new hips<br>and the only time I'm aware that I have<br>two new hips is when I go through the<br>airport scanner and every time without a<br>Minister alpito the minister of Pacific<br>peoples during the time of the pandemic<br>encourage all of his stuff and anyone<br>who would listen to do anything and<br>everything to encourage our people to be<br>vaccinated<br>he even did a tick tock dance and<br>challenged everyone to do one<br>I've never been on Tick Tock before<br>but I promised him that I will do one<br>so while posted in Samoa for work I<br>pulled in my colleagues from the Samoa<br>Ministry of Health the medical and<br>Nurses Association the medical students<br>my family my mother her caregivers and<br>even the family dog<br>to participate<br>I know you're watching this is a<br>dedication to you<br>to your commitment to our people in<br>aotearoa<br>favor<br>foreign<br>I love
