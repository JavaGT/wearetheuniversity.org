The drug has changed the lives of millions of people worldwide. Ed Gane (FHMS) was a speaker at the inaugural Researchers with global impact event.</p><h2>Transcript</h2><p style="opacity: 0.9; font-size: 0.8em">Transcripts may be automatically generated and may

year of training and<br>gastroenterology here in Auckland<br>a new RNA virus was discovered and the<br>serum of a patient with transfusion<br>acquired non-a non-b hepatitis using a<br>new complementary DNA technology<br>this new virus was named the hepatitis C<br>virus and it was soon shown to be the<br>cause of all non-a non-b hepatitis in<br>injecting drug users<br>the next year I took up a research<br>fellowship at the King's College in<br>London to study this new virus<br>after training in what was in a new PCR<br>technology in Switzerland I tested<br>archived blood from more than a thousand<br>patients who had been transplanted for<br>unknown liver diseases<br>and surprise we found that almost all of<br>this work was published in the New<br>England Journal of Medicine<br>and our results refuted an earlier<br>report in the same Journal which claimed<br>that hepatitis C did not cause severe<br>live disease and did not increase<br>mortality<br>the real impact of this hepatitis C<br>epidemic became clear over the next<br>decade as this was recognized as the<br>leading cause of liver cancer and liver<br>transplant all over the globe including<br>here in the arteroa<br>when I returned to Auckland in the late<br>1990s the only Treatment available for<br>hepatitis C was interferon<br>it was inconvenient<br>three times a week injections it was<br>poorly tolerated and it was ineffective<br>after a year of misery less than 10<br>percent of patients were cured so no one<br>was lining up to be treated with this<br>by 2008 the first oral antiviral agents<br>had been developed that could inhibit<br>hepatitis C in the lab<br>unfortunately when given to patients<br>they rapidly failed because of the rapid<br>emergence of drug resistance<br>the biggest breakthrough for Hepatitis C<br>treatment occurred in 2010<br>when a small biotech company called<br>pharmaceut approached me to conduct a<br>trial with a newly discovered antiviral<br>PSI 7977 which we now know as<br>cephosphere<br>this was the first oral nucleoside<br>polymerase inhibitor it worked again for<br>all Australians of hepatitis C and had a<br>very high barrier to resistance<br>and our electron study I treated 40<br>patients with cephosphovir for 12 weeks<br>and all 40 were cured the first time<br>anyone in the world had been cured<br>without interferon<br>these results caused quite a stir when I<br>presented them at the international<br>liver meeting in San Francisco in 2011.<br>over the next decade sophosphere has<br>been prescribed to more than 10 million<br>people<br>to date almost 15 000 kiwis have been<br>cured with oral drugs<br>in 2016 recognizing the potential of<br>sophosphere<br>all the 194 countries of the world<br>Health assembly agreed to eliminate<br>hepatitis C by 2030. making this the<br>first infectious disease to be<br>eradicated without a vaccine<br>we can look at Egypt to see what can be<br>achieved with government support<br>almost 20 percent of their population<br>were infected<br>and in 2018 the Egyptian government set<br>up a national testing program linked<br>with locally produced generic oral drugs<br>over the next four years more than four<br>million Egyptians were cured and this<br>country is now the first to achieve the<br>who elimination goals<br>the challenge back here in RTL Roa is to<br>find more than 30 000 kiwis who are<br>living with hepatitis C most of whom<br>don't know that they are are infected<br>in July 2021 Minister Vero and I<br>launched the first national hepatitis C<br>action plan for RTR New Zealand<br>this is designed to promote Innovative<br>programs to increase testing and<br>treatment in our communities<br>over the last 18 months more than eleven<br>thousand fingerprint tests have been<br>performed by Maori Health Providers<br>needle exchangers addiction centers and<br>prisons across sumotu<br>to improve Community Access to treatment<br>we're now working with medsafe to allow<br>nurses and pharmacists to treat<br>hepatitis C<br>we are making progress<br>in 2015 more than half of all adults<br>needing liver transplants in this<br>country had hepatitis C<br>last year this was less than 10 percent<br>and with the next decade this will<br>disappear thereby improving access for<br>patients with other liver diseases to<br>have liver transplants<br>so I reflect on the fact that hepatitis<br>C was discovered in 1989<br>we had a universal cure developed within<br>25 years and Global eradication is very<br>likely within 50 years<br>a truly remarkable and unprecedented<br>feat<br>and with this the number of people dying<br>from hepatitis C will decrease from more<br>than a million per year<br>to nil<br>it was therefore entirely appropriate<br>that in 2020 the Nobel Prize for<br>medicine went to Harvey Alter Charlie<br>rice and Mark Halton the three<br>scientists who first identified this<br>virus<br>when we've eradicated hypnotic C our<br>next goal will be finding a cure for</p></main><footer style="margin-top: 2rem; background: #0001; padding: 2rem; text-align: center;"><p>We Are The
