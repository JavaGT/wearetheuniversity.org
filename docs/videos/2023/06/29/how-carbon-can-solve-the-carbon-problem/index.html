in<br>civil environmental engineering and his<br>focuses on green technologies to reduce<br>the carbon footprint in the construction<br>sector and sustainable remediation thank<br>you ajid<br>thank you very much Frank good evening<br>everyone hope you guys are having a good<br>time<br>and thank you for being here and I would<br>like to just briefly acknowledge for the<br>invitation to speak here<br>together<br>so if I just put this slide you already<br>know what I'm going to talk about right<br>climate change global warming climate<br>change global warming everybody's<br>talking about that<br>this is the big challenge that the world<br>but<br>what about if I could have a particular<br>material and that will actually solve<br>this problem<br>with a special type of carbon actually<br>help these carbon problems and I've got<br>here<br>and this circle is not your Everest<br>humble cycle that you would make every<br>time you burn a piece of wood in the<br>back here<br>this particular charcoal has gone<br>through a process which we have known<br>about since ancient times<br>which we turn into today and we call it<br>biochar<br>biosity is basically a charcoal that you<br>can prepare<br>if you hit<br>in the absence of oxygen or under<br>limited amount of oxygen<br>in a process called pyrolysis which is<br>an Hazel technology<br>and in the process of paralyzes what<br>happens<br>the volatiles Escape all the gases are<br>personally driven off and what you get<br>is a solid residue that's called biochar<br>and this particular biasure that I'm<br>holding here<br>this has been prepared from something<br>you wouldn't expect and that's from<br>polter chicken poo<br>now this the carbon that you that I have<br>here in this charcoal<br>is about 60 to 70 percent of pure carbon<br>and that is highly stable<br>evidence suggests that this charcoal if<br>you put it in the onto the soil it will<br>stay there for hundreds and thousands of<br>years<br>foreign<br>this is from the<br>Amazon Amazon river that you can see<br>here so we have known about biochar<br>since last 2500 years Amazonian Indians<br>they used to call it<br>assembly in Portuguese that means black<br>art or dark soils and they know it and<br>now if we take a close look at biochar<br>on the microscope that's what you see<br>it's an image scanning looked on<br>micrograph emails or biochar<br>and his chalk pull-up passes aways all<br>those pores that you see some are big<br>some are small smaller has been<br>extremely smaller<br>all these posts basically retain<br>nutrients and conserve water<br>and micros doesn't simply love it<br>this is the habitat for microbes but<br>again this is not food for microbes<br>so when you have so many poles<br>so many passages open areas rather than<br>more solids you think that it will have<br>high surface area indeed one gram of<br>biosar would have at least 400 square<br>meter surface area<br>which is roughly like a basketball court<br>maybe 28 meters by 15 meters you can<br>basically fold it into a small sugar<br>cube maybe slightly smaller than that<br>isn't that amazing<br>now<br>it turns out this<br>this knowledge is the only carbon<br>negative technology that we have right<br>now<br>it reduces carbon dioxide in the<br>atmosphere by taking<br>carbon neutral process of decomposing<br>organic matter and counts into carbon<br>negative<br>well back to carbon problem<br>I mean of course you know what I'm going<br>to talk about but just simply looking at<br>nearly 40 percent of<br>energy associated with<br>constructions building sectors Comes<br>This Way<br>now to make cement<br>that accounts for nearly 36 percent of<br>the<br>carbon dioxide emissions<br>and in total eight percent of the<br>anthropogenic carbon dioxide emissions<br>now cement is like a glue it basically<br>holds concrete together<br>what do you need sand cement and water<br>and you throw in some Aggregates or<br>gravels<br>and you have your concrete concrete is<br>the most widely<br>used man-made material after<br>water a lot of people they don't realize<br>it what is the most consumed resource<br>so to make cement<br>you have to pay a price for that<br>construction for to do any construction<br>you need concrete<br>okay<br>and eight percent of the global carbon<br>just to give you an analogy of put<br>things into perspective if cement was a<br>country<br>it would be the third largest emitter in<br>the world after China and United States<br>that's how it is so<br>if we have a material produced from<br>waste biomass who should otherwise land<br>up in landfill and create all sorts of<br>emission issues<br>there's a good thing right you have two<br>scenarios here it's a win-win scenarios<br>because you can ease this particular<br>carbon that is present here unique<br>inequalities high surface area it has<br>got also other different qualities and<br>you can use it as a replacement for<br>synthetic cement<br>as well as for sand<br>and you can get similar sort of strength<br>and durability for like conventional<br>concrete that's a win-win scenario for<br>us<br>because what you're doing is you're not<br>only sequestering the carbon back in the<br>concrete but you're also reducing the<br>emissions<br>our research has shown that if you<br>replace<br>concrete with biochar there's a<br>significant reduction in net carbon<br>dioxide emissions 20 percent<br>reduction in net carbon dioxide emission<br>when he<br>replace some of the cement and sand with<br>biochar<br>and that is an excellent<br>now<br>globally if you look at the biosure<br>technology<br>it could actually help us reduce<br>greenhouse gas emissions by nearly 3.4<br>to 6.4 picogram carbon dioxide<br>equivalent<br>that is roughly you know or out of that<br>nearly 49 to 59 is attributed to the<br>carbon dioxide withdrawal from the<br>atmosphere<br>and also our estimation suggests that if<br>we produce biochar this carbon material<br>whatever the biomass you're talking<br>about it depends again different types<br>of biomass will have different types of<br>biops are but globally if you look at<br>this biosaur technology<br>if you produce 375 million tons of biots<br>are simply from agricultural waste that<br>would enable you to sequester nearly 500<br>million tons of carbon dioxide<br>so what's the<br>state of play<br>what's happening<br>the biggest stumbling block right now is<br>that Industries<br>private companies and government bodies<br>their worry of the risk<br>risk associated with<br>technology<br>in life there is no risk nor gain that's<br>my motto to be able to go one step<br>forward you need to be able to come back<br>right<br>you have to take risk<br>so my position is that we risk more by<br>waiting for an ancient technology simple<br>carbon negative technology<br>which is with us<br>so therefore I feel<br>bison is the carbon to solve the carbon<br>problem<br>and we need to get on with the job<br>thank you<br>foreign</p></main><footer style="margin-top: 2rem; background: #0001; padding: 2rem;
