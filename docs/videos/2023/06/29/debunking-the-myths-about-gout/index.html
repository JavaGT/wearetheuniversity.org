It more commonly affects MƒÅori and Pacific men from a surprisingly young age. Professor Nicola Dalbeth says equitable treatment means dispelling the myths.<br>Professor Dalbeth, FHMS, was a speaker at the inaugural Researchers with global impact event.</p><h2>Transcript</h2><p style="opacity: 0.9; font-size: 0.8em">Transcripts may be automatically generated and may not be 100% accurate.</p><p>so next it's a pleasure to introduce<br>Professor Nicola dalbeth who is a<br>specialist rheumatologist<br>holding dual appointments at the factual<br>order to talkatumai and the University<br>of Auckland<br>she leads a research program focusing on<br>the mechanisms impact and treatment of<br>gout<br>although it may be less common than it<br>used to be when Lord Chatham for example<br>was laid up for 18 months whilst he was<br>prime minister for gout leading to<br>severe depression nevertheless it's<br>still a major problem<br>she's been a principal investigator of<br>trials for novel therapeutic agents and<br>treatment strategies in gout and has led<br>International initiatives to Define<br>Central concepts of the disease<br>including nomenclature staging and<br>response to treatment thank you Nicola<br>tour<br>great well thank you Frank that was very<br>nice to have an introduction I hope I<br>can debunk some of the myths that you<br>have just perpetuated in your<br>introduction<br>so let me tell you about gout so gout is<br>by far the most common form of<br>inflammatory arthritis in aotearoa<br>and it's uh prevalence is in fact<br>increasing<br>um so this is what gout looks like on a<br>dual energy CT scan and this is the<br>technology that we use often in our in<br>our studies particularly examining<br>mechanisms of joint damage and gout so<br>gout is caused by high serum urate<br>levels uh which essentially lead to uh<br>formation of monosodium urate crystals<br>color-coded here is green on this dual<br>energy CT and these crystals sit in the<br>joint quite quietly not doing too much<br>and then every now and then they will<br>trigger a severe acute inflammatory<br>response<br>and so essentially this is a very severe<br>arthritis extremely painful the person<br>has great difficulty walking<br>um going to work getting to the bathroom<br>doing most of their activities and we<br>often think of gout as kind of funny but<br>actually when you start to hear the<br>experience of people with gout I think<br>you'll appreciate actually what a<br>distressing and unpleasant condition<br>this actually is and this is just<br>um some a quote here from a patient who<br>who told us their story is part of some<br>qualitative work<br>so much of the work that we've done in<br>our group is trying to understand the<br>mechanisms of really severe joint<br>disease<br>um so uh essentially<br>um very severe erosive gout so causing<br>joint damage and deformity and we've<br>done this with tools such as dual energy<br>CT and also a program of of laboratory<br>research as well and what we've really<br>identified from this is that again we<br>can see these MSU crystals present at<br>the sites of joint damage and if we<br>treat these crystals by lowering the<br>urate level actually we can prevent<br>progression of joint damage<br>we also know now that actually gout has<br>effects Beyond The Joint and this just<br>shows a recent study that we've<br>published really confirming that people<br>who have gout have much higher risk of<br>cardiovascular disease and in fact death<br>from cardiovascular disease as well so<br>the impact of gout which is great<br>actually goes beyond the joints as well<br>so there is quite a simple solution in<br>in practice to gout management and this<br>is a medicine called allopurinol that<br>has been available now for over half a<br>century it costs or 300 milligrams of<br>allopurinol costs about six cents a day<br>it's very cheap<br>um and we know that if we give people<br>the right dose of allopurinol actually<br>the crystals will dissolve the gout<br>attacks will settle and ultimately joint<br>damage will be prevented<br>but unfortunately in aotearoa we were<br>doing really badly at this uh and so if<br>we look at new zealanders overall who<br>have got less than 50 percent actually<br>get regular urate lowering therapy or<br>regular Allopurinol and if we look at<br>those populations that have the highest<br>risk of most severe disease particularly<br>Pacific peoples and Maori actually we<br>see the lowest rates of allopurinol<br>dispensing<br>so actually we're really<br>doing a bad job at this as Healthcare<br>professionals and as a Health Care<br>system and we really need to do much<br>better<br>so why are these rates so low so we've<br>spent quite a lot of time in our<br>research looking at Community beliefs<br>about gout Healthcare professional<br>beliefs about gout and a lot of these<br>beliefs actually go back to these very<br>traditional views of gout and these<br>cartoons that are you know come from<br>from many centuries ago gout as a<br>self-inflicted disease kind of funny<br>people bring it on themselves actually<br>we can just manage it with<br>anti-inflammatory medicines and diet<br>change we also see quite a lack of<br>confidence and understanding and<br>providers and Healthcare Providers about<br>the benefits of urate lowering therapy<br>and there's also major systems barriers<br>to Chronic Care Management and we've<br>seen quite a lot in the in the news in<br>the last few weeks about prescription<br>co-pays and and I would certainly say<br>that the presence of a prescription<br>copay has been a major major barrier to<br>people without getting effective<br>treatment and I think it's really<br>fantastic that we're now seeing that<br>co-pay um coming off for people with<br>girl or for people with General health<br>conditions<br>and a lot of the time it sees pop<br>culture references that are all around<br>us that perpetuate these myths so we see<br>this in newspapers we see this in uh<br>comedies we see this in films and a<br>recent study that we've done actually<br>has shown that just watching a watching<br>in fact this very video Everyone Hates<br>Chris everyone hates the gout a<br>20-minute comedy show about gout<br>actually means that when people watch<br>this they think that actually diet is<br>most important and we don't need to be<br>taking regular medicine so these these<br>views are all around us and actually are<br>impacting on our beliefs about the about<br>the illness as well<br>so a lot of the work that we're now<br>doing is really trying to dispel these<br>myths that we need to dispel this myth<br>that if we fix the diet we're going to<br>just fix the gout it's not all about<br>diet that we need to be looking at<br>changing community and also healthcare<br>provider beliefs about gout thinking<br>about structural barriers and also<br>really trying to destigmatize gout and<br>and really see it as the biological<br>disease<br>mostly actually about how our kidneys<br>and our gut handle uric acid rather than<br>what we're eating or drinking and<br>bringing on ourselves<br>and this is really the focus of what<br>we're doing now so working with Susan<br>Reed from Health interests in New<br>Zealand uh on a big Ministry funded uh<br>rethinking gout program which is really<br>looking at a better primary care of gout<br>this fantastic project led by Malachi<br>ofanoa funded by HSC looking at new<br>Pacific models of gout and also the<br>easylo RCT which is an HRC program Grant<br>which is co-directed by Lisa stamp<br>liantikaru and and me so a collaboration<br>with the University of otago as well<br>and I'll just finish my thinking the<br>funders and the research team and study<br>participants</p></main><footer style="margin-top: 2rem; background: #0001; padding: 2rem; text-align: center;"><p>We Are The University</p><ul style="list-style-type: none; padding: 0;
