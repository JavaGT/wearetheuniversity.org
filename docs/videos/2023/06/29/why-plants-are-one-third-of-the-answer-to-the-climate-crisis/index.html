researching how to grow the crops we need to feed ourselves in a warmer world.<br>Professor Allan, Science, was a speaker at the inaugural Researchers with global impact event.</p><h2>Transcript</h2><p style="opacity: 0.9; font-size: 0.8em">Transcripts may be automatically generated and may not be 100% accurate.</p><p>so we'll start off now with our<br>presentations the first one is by<br>Professor Andrew Allen<br>Professor Allen holds dual roles as<br>professor of plant science at the<br>faculty of Science and as a lead<br>researcher at the crown Research<br>Institute plant and food research<br>he and his then doctoral candidate<br>Richard espley conclusively mapped the<br>gene that decides the red color in<br>apples<br>he's working on a five-year<br>endeavor-funded project the flowering<br>crisis confronting a changing climate<br>threat to New Zealand's tree crops<br>Andrew<br>thank you very much learned colleagues<br>I have a huge challenge kicking this off<br>today and maybe the biggest challenges<br>to convince you that plants are a third<br>of the solution to the climate crisis<br>yours think oh he's a plant biologist he<br>would say that but by the end of this<br>talk some of you will be with me on this<br>Crusade<br>the key thing that not the challenge of<br>my talk the real the real challenge is<br>in the next 20 years we've got another<br>billion people to feed and we've got to<br>feed those people around the world<br>and not increase greenhouse gas<br>emissions so methane and equivalent in<br>carbon dioxide so we've got more mouths<br>to feed and we've got to do it more<br>efficiently<br>to produce a million calories from beef<br>you need about 13 hectares of of land<br>and that's going to make 225 tons of CO2<br>that's a problem<br>to make a million calories from a<br>plant-based crop often less than a<br>hectare it's a third of a hectare for<br>pulses and that will produce only 10<br>tons of CO2 that's mainly from transport<br>so<br>apart from things like and we're going<br>to hear from arjit one of our speakers<br>big engineering projects carbon capture<br>reductions and the use of fossil fuels<br>they're they're the other two thirds of<br>the equation we have to do that<br>but if we plant more crops and and<br>succeed to feed those people and have a<br>more plant-based agricultural system we<br>will reduce CO2 emissions as well<br>that's because plants as a byproduct<br>fixed carbon dioxide and produce sugar<br>that feeds the planet sometimes we feed<br>those plants to animals and that's not a<br>very efficient way of doing things<br>and if you get a new cultivar a new crop<br>you can make lots of money off it and<br>I'll show you a couple of examples of<br>that if our farmers and<br>horticulturalists in New Zealand are<br>making good money they won't have so<br>many cows I'm not anti-cal I just think<br>we've maybe got too many of them okay<br>I'm a meat eater so I'm I'm quite<br>happily hypocritical on that on that<br>equation<br>um I'm addicted to the taste of meat but<br>I want to be provided with alternatives<br>to that and I will happily go towards<br>that and pay good money for that and if<br>they're plant-based Solutions that's<br>so how are we going to respond to this<br>challenge we've got to protect our plant<br>sector that we currently have the the<br>acute weather events that we had over<br>the last summer illustrate that some of<br>our crops are planted in the wrong<br>places and some crops just cannot cope<br>with that amount of water<br>we've got to provide the consumers with<br>new plant-based proteins The Impossible<br>Burger is one example that we see in<br>countdown it tastes really good at<br>tastes of meat I like it it's grown in<br>America because we're not allowed to<br>grow it here<br>we need to rapidly develop new crops<br>things that we can plant that will make<br>make our Farmers good money and replace<br>a lot of the data I'm quoting is from a<br>lovely report from the World Resources<br>Institute uh NGO based out of bargaining<br>they want they advise in this report<br>that we've got to raise productivity any<br>agricultural system that reduces<br>productivity is not a good idea<br>we need to manage demand we need to<br>manage in particular the demand for meat<br>and we've got to Spur technological<br>innovation New Zealand needs to be the<br>most technologically advanced<br>agricultural system not the North Korea<br>of the South Pacific<br>when it comes to things like this these<br>are genetically engineered or Gene<br>edited kiwifruit that I've made in my<br>laboratory in Mount orbit<br>the one on the right in particular has<br>got two rounds of edits that make it<br>flower constantly and so stature is very<br>short because it flowers very early<br>instead of being a big kiwi fruit found<br>fine and we've dropped another in it in<br>there that makes the male kiwi fruit<br>into a hermaphrodite so it<br>self-pollinates<br>that plant on the right is unregulated<br>in Australia the edits that are involved<br>in making that plant are not considered<br>to be genetically modified they're just<br>edits they're just tiny changes in DNA<br>in New Zealand it's heavily regulated<br>and caused causes our public angst and<br>fighting and shouting just recently and<br>the media on on Sunday when Judith<br>Collins announced her science policy for<br>example<br>so we've got this challenge of trying to<br>persuade the public that there's some<br>technological advances that we can use<br>that aren't that um that crazy and<br>they're going to help with with um with<br>growing our plant-based economy<br>another way of growing the plant-based<br>economy is spotting some new crops there<br>are 12 000 species of flowering plant<br>which are edible some of those species<br>uh well 150 of them are planted<br>worldwide in quite large numbers but<br>only 20 species provide 90 of the<br>world's food and that's a real danger<br>imagine if one of those plants because<br>of climate change was to fail then we'd<br>lose a good portion of our calories<br>so the challenge is to domesticate some<br>of those 150 to raise them into that<br>high category or take some of the 12 000<br>that have never been grown domestically<br>and bring them on online and that's<br>really what's not easy but it's really<br>fast these days sequence the plant's<br>genome look at what its fatal floor is<br>often it's yield and put in some Gene<br>units to make to fix that problem and<br>then you've got a new crop<br>challenging socially but not that<br>challenging scientifically<br>and if you get it right then you make a<br>lot of money the gold kiwi fruit<br>cultivate not genetically engineered not<br>Gene edited just naturally bred is<br>making us 1.96 billion dollars a year in<br>Revenue export revenue and planted on a<br>very small piece of land and mainly in<br>the in the in Te puke<br>so you don't need a lot of of land to<br>make good money and you're not going to<br>however so on a straight it's a great<br>time to be a plant biologist been in New<br>Zealand it's still a bit tricky in<br>Australia the better in the in the in<br>the dotted box is unregulated so small<br>edits caused by crispr by Gene editing<br>is unregulated in Australia it's only if<br>there's an extra piece of DNA in the<br>plant that it's considered GMO and it's<br>heavily regulated<br>in New Zealand though just Across The<br>Tasman we only unregulated breeding<br>which is a bit of a bit annoying because<br>I'm telling you that these other methods<br>are a lot faster than breeding and<br>and it's not just the New Zealand<br>Australia comparison the countries in<br>green are places where Gene edits small<br>changes in the DNA of a plant are not<br>regulated and and New Zealand has to<br>compete with those countries and they've<br>got an advantage with the fight against<br>the changing climate these countries can<br>so I hope I've persuaded you a little<br>bit that plants are part of the solution<br>to the climate crisis and I don't think<br>I used up my full five minutes thank you<br>very much</p></main><footer style="margin-top: 2rem; background: #0001; padding: 2rem; text-align: center;"><p>We Are The University</p><ul
