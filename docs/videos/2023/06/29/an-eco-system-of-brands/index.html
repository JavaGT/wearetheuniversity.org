The framework enables businesses to understand how brands co-create value and preserve social licence to operate. Emeritus Professor Broderick, Business, was a speaker at the inaugural Researchers with global impact event.</p><h2>Transcript</h2><p style="opacity: 0.9; font-size: 0.8em">Transcripts may be

I've seen him recognized as<br>a Pioneer in the understanding of<br>branding and customer engagement<br>his research has been cited far beyond<br>the boundaries of business influencing<br>economists psychologists and<br>sociologists<br>his work is about how business not only<br>can protect but also enhance the social<br>license to operate<br>thanks very much rod<br>oh thank you for inviting me<br>um I was always fascinated<br>with the potential of business and as a<br>ten-year-old Schoolboy I set up a cinema<br>but for children in our garage<br>and this is before TV this is 19 to<br>1950s<br>and our house was very close to the<br>local primary school and uh the cinema<br>cinema Oprah operated after school it<br>was a complex activity two friends had<br>eight millimeter projectors I hired<br>films we reconfigured the garage into a<br>cinema there was a charge for entry and<br>we had Suites at half time I learned<br>early on that markets were complex<br>much much later after graduating in<br>economics I'd found myself as an<br>academic in the discipline of marketing<br>and in the 1970s marketing's Focus was<br>on customer needs and wants but as I<br>learned from my childhood business<br>experiences<br>the role of business goes far beyond the<br>setting of supply and demand and so my<br>focus shifted to the complexities of<br>thinking um<br>how to free ourselves from the very<br>dyadic view which was being provided by<br>marketing at that stage and so we needed<br>to unshackle our thinking from this diet<br>and adopt a broader Network perspective<br>and so<br>um in order to develop this network<br>perspective there's a lot going on and<br>especially since the 1990s and there has<br>been digital transformation with<br>emergence of the internet and social<br>media uh each having major impacts and<br>on business practice and in particular<br>perhaps the the broader societal<br>transformation<br>that is taking place since then and we<br>see new ways of organizing business and<br>the need for more agile ways to respond<br>to increasing uncertainty arising from<br>faster changes in culture and society<br>and today business cannot ignore the<br>drive for a sustainable planet and<br>stewardship in the environment<br>and working with collaborators across<br>the globe we've adopted a systemic<br>Network perspective<br>and my research has blossomed with<br>branches and branding engagement and<br>more recently in Market shaping in the<br>circular economy this highly cited<br>research is having both practical and<br>societal relevance but also major Global<br>impact and so to illustrate this I'll<br>focus on branding a dynamic Network<br>perspective reveals that brand is much<br>more than Imogen logo Brands create<br>value through an ever-changing<br>interactive Confluence of perception<br>value emotions and trusts the jobs of of<br>a brand manager and chief Executives is<br>to navigate their way through this<br>and so perhaps just to illustrate this<br>uh I don't I don't think our soccer<br>women's soccer team is going to have as<br>much exposure as this but certainly you<br>know there was a major rise uh in the<br>black ferns from a billy unknown team to<br>uh when they won the World Cup to Heroes<br>and role models for the New Zealand<br>Public and to understand that it's a bit<br>like an iceberg at the tip of is visible<br>and that's the brand image and Logo<br>created by their games in their<br>interviews in the media but below the<br>water line are complex social processes<br>people aren't just<br>fans they've participated in Social<br>processes they are talking about the<br>team watching their games and reading<br>about the team the individual stories<br>and Collective presence co-created new<br>meanings in the market system these<br>social processes feed into the creation<br>of a very strong brand<br>and in our paper emerging emergence of<br>brand meaning social systems we develop<br>a framework to investigate the social<br>and cultural meanings the framework<br>shows how brand meanings evolve at<br>different levels of a brand service<br>ecosystem<br>this the co-creation of brand meanings<br>reflects the thoughts and actions of<br>and so if we think of the framework well<br>it could be this huge amount of<br>confusion but the framework we've<br>developed is we use the service Eco<br>system perspective with three levels<br>micro meso and macro first comes the<br>micro level and that's the individual<br>whether a worker manager or customers<br>brand identity is shaped by individual<br>needs and wants then at the next level<br>is the Meso Level and this is the<br>relations the organizations spilled with<br>suppliers Distributors customers and<br>communities it is at the Meso Level<br>where the organization strategy resides<br>finally the businesses granted social<br>license to function at the macro level<br>how does the business sit in relation to<br>wider Society government and social<br>media and so it's up to the the brand<br>owners the chief Executives and the<br>board to ensure that at each level of<br>the network the brand meanings meet with<br>so just just to conclude like business<br>research is always a co-created activity<br>and I've provided vision and Leadership<br>but as you can see uh there's been<br>wonderful collaboration with uh 50 plus<br>talented co-authors to publish many<br>highly cited articles<br>and the evidence is that the network<br>framework will support businesses to be<br>more resilient agile and most<br>importantly better for society and the<br>planet leading to social license thank<br>you</p></main><footer style="margin-top: 2rem; background: #0001; padding: 2rem; text-align:
