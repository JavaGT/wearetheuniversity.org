an engineer and psychologist researching social connection and companion robots.<br>Professor Broadbent, FHMS, was a speaker at the inaugural Researchers with global impact event.</p><h2>Transcript</h2><p style="opacity: 0.9; font-size: 0.8em">Transcripts may be automatically generated and may not be 100% accurate.</p><p>so our next speaker is Professor<br>Elizabeth Broadbent<br>Elizabeth is an engineer I didn't know<br>that Elizabeth<br>who became fascinated by human<br>psychology<br>she works at the intersection of Health<br>psychology and technology and has a<br>strong interest in the emotional<br>connections we form with robots<br>much of a work is about how we can build<br>emotional intelligence and empathy in<br>robots to help support patients<br>including the design of virtual humans<br>with artificial intelligence<br>thanks Elizabeth<br>Kiara Koto thank you everyone for coming<br>and thank you to the event organizers<br>so today I want to raise the issue of<br>loneliness<br>affects around 50 percent of Americans<br>and here in New Zealand we can't be<br>complacent in the 2021<br>census 44 of people reported feeling<br>lonely in the last four weeks<br>so loneliness refers to um a distressing<br>feeling when people feel like their<br>needs are not being met by the quality<br>social isolation is similar but it's<br>more objective measures of being alone<br>living alone and the number of friends<br>so the bad news is that loneliness is<br>increasing<br>and the office of the U.S Surgeon<br>General recently put out a call to<br>action to try and reduce loneliness you<br>can see it with these graphs here this<br>is the number of hours that are spent<br>During certain things so you can see<br>that social isolation is increasing<br>whereas companionship is reducing and<br>the number of hours that we spend with<br>family friends and other people is also<br>reducing<br>so why is this important so as well as<br>being a distressing experience social<br>isolation and loneliness actually<br>increase the risk of mortality by 26 and<br>29 respectively<br>and this graph is showing us that the<br>odds of premature mortality for social<br>for lacking social isolation is<br>equivalent to smoking 15 cigarettes a<br>day and it's more than alcohol lack of<br>physical activity obesity and air<br>how does social connection or lack of<br>social connection impact our mortality<br>or it's through several Pathways one of<br>which is biological so when we feel<br>lonely we feel unsafe we feel more<br>vulnerable we feel more anxious more<br>depressed and what this can do is it<br>affects inflammation so it results in<br>chronic activation of stress hormones<br>which leads to increased inflammation<br>which then puts us at greater risk of<br>heart disease progression of cancer<br>stroke as well as increased risk of<br>getting an infectious disease<br>another pathway is through<br>um<br>Health behaviors like lack of physical<br>activity lack of sleep<br>Etc<br>so what are the factors that contribute<br>to social isolation so they're a<br>socio-demographic factors we know that<br>older people and people with<br>disabilities are more lonely we know<br>that the way that we build our schools<br>and workplaces can contribute to social<br>connection or not as well as different<br>aspects of our culture<br>but one aspect is technology<br>so<br>there is a rise in the use of Technology<br>as you will all know 93 of Americans<br>have an Internet connected cell phone<br>and 92 percent of new zealanders do<br>so this can have positive effects as<br>well as negative effects so we saw that<br>during the covert pandemic actually<br>having an internet connection increased<br>social connection with other people but<br>we also know that spending too much time<br>on your smartphone can reduce in less<br>time with friends and family and also<br>can result online bullying<br>as well as the spirit of misinformation<br>so the question is how can we design<br>technology to increase social connection<br>and can we build Technologies like we<br>see in the movies like Star Wars where<br>so here at the University of Auckland<br>particularly with the kids robotics<br>research group we've been doing research<br>on robots and one of these is Paro which<br>is a cute companion seal robot that you<br>can pet and cuddle<br>it responds by moving its flippers and<br>its tail and makes cute seal noises so<br>we did a randomized control trial with<br>Paro so showed that it reduced<br>loneliness in a rest home compared to<br>their other activities like playing<br>bingo or going on a bus trip<br>the other robots we've been using in<br>retirement villages to do various<br>Healthcare activities like monitoring<br>COPD monitoring blood pressure providing<br>cognitive stimulation and what we've<br>found in these studies is that even<br>though we weren't targeting<br>companionship people reported making<br>friends with the robots and missing the<br>we've been doing research looking at how<br>we can make robots more social some of<br>the ways we can do that is by making<br>them proactive so they initiate<br>conversations they're responsive they<br>remember what you told them last time<br>and follow up with that they can use<br>psychological techniques to motivate<br>Behavior change display attachment<br>behaviors like play and saying they miss<br>us<br>and we can build good communication<br>skills like eye contact and showing<br>attention<br>so the frequency of our interactions<br>with robots the functions they provide<br>and the quality of those interactions<br>are all important components to see<br>effects on companionship and health<br>outcomes<br>not only robots but also these digital<br>characters it may also be useful for<br>loneliness so we've got replica there<br>which is a commercial app saying I've<br>been missing you so it's it's<br>um<br>for loneliness on the other side we've<br>got a cell machines digital human who<br>have recently Incorporated chat GPT into<br>their technology to make conversations<br>more natural<br>so this is an ongoing research area<br>how can we make<br>technology more personable and increase<br>social connections rather than reducing<br>social connectivity<br>and I'd like to thank my colleagues at<br>the Care Center of Robotics research<br>sewing machines and the school of<br>bioengineering<br>foreign</p></main><footer style="margin-top:
