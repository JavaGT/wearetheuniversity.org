and online we're very glad to<br>have you all here over the next hour we<br>will be discussing several topics<br>related to students University<br>experiences with the ultimate goal of<br>stimulating further discussions among<br>our faculty and staff that will lead to<br>either the enhancement of existing<br>practices or the development of new ones<br>at the end of our panel discussion we<br>will have a brief q a session so for<br>those of you watching online please feel<br>free to submit your questions at any<br>time for those of you in the studio you<br>will be able to participate in that<br>segment as well<br>now on to introductions I'm Patrick<br>muzaku a postgraduate student in the<br>higher education development center and<br>I'll be facilitating this calero I'm<br>sitting next to three brilliant students<br>who will be introducing themselves in<br>just a moment but before they do that we<br>do have a quick panel update image in<br>McAllister was unfortunately unable to<br>join us but we are lucky enough to have<br>Tessa Worthington here in our place uh<br>Tessa would you like to introduce<br>yourself sure everyone my name is Tessa<br>I'm a third year undergraduate student<br>I'm doing a Bachelor of Arts and Science<br>majoring in genetics and psychology and<br>I'm also a past facilitator with student<br>learning development so that's PS just<br>assisted study sessions and we run<br>Vision sessions for a wide range of<br>papers and I'm really passionate about<br>adapting learning to suit a wide variety<br>of Learners and different learning<br>styles and I'm really excited to get<br>some to enter some good conversations<br>today<br>thank you for being here Tessa next we<br>have Annabelle peradovan hi guys so I'm<br>Annabelle I'm the culture and political<br>editor over at critic the student<br>magazine and I'm also a master's student<br>in the department of media film and<br>communication I'm really excited to be<br>here today alongside you guys I think<br>past couple of years in terms of both<br>journalism and in terms of the<br>University experience there's been a lot<br>of upheaval a lot of tumultuous changes<br>so it'll be interesting to see what<br>people think<br>I'm very glad to have you here as well<br>Annabelle finally we have Quentin Jane<br>yeah Kilda I'm Clinton and I'm the<br>president of the otago University<br>Students Association so I graduated in<br>December and did a Bachelor of Arts and<br>Science in politics chemistry and math<br>and then I'm doing a few more papers<br>this year alongside all my work in our<br>USA just filling up some of the gaps in<br>my minor and so most of my study was in<br>the covert years I had one year prior to<br>all of that so I've kind of seen the way<br>that that has shifted learning alongside<br>all the new technologies that have come<br>out it's been as Annabelle said quite an<br>interesting time for education and I'm<br>really excited to talk about it today<br>thank you for joining us well Clinton<br>well let's Dive Right In shall we what<br>better place to start than a nice<br>friendly conversation about the impact<br>of covid-19<br>obviously that was a big transition<br>moving from classrooms to zoom rooms uh<br>if you could all just kind of share some<br>some of your stories and insights you<br>had from that transition both positive<br>and negative when you had to go to<br>online learning so suddenly yeah<br>um I personally found it super<br>challenging I love coming to UNI and<br>coming to class for the social<br>interactions and it's kind of a<br>collective experience as well where you<br>come into class and you're all like<br>working on the same assignment and it's<br>really hard and you can like discuss<br>that together whereas when you're online<br>you're just kind of sitting at home in<br>your bedroom being like Oh wonder where<br>all my friends are<br>um and that I found really hard on just<br>trying to like having to get out of bed<br>and like you just go to your desk rather<br>than like actually go somewhere like I<br>found that accountability the external<br>accountability of having to actually<br>come to class was really valuable for me<br>personally but on the other hand some of<br>the some of the good things that<br>definitely came out<br>um I mean covert was a very rough time<br>and I want to acknowledge that but some<br>good things that did come out was<br>definitely the flexibility that it<br>allowed and I think for myself and for<br>some some of my friends and stuff that<br>I've talked to being able to just do it<br>in your own time and on your own terms<br>can be really valuable because student<br>lives are so complex have lots going on<br>so I think it's definitely pros and cons<br>and also I think a lot everything had to<br>become recorded and I think that has<br>really continued as we've gone on<br>um in this post pandemic<br>um it's continued which has been really<br>great because it um I think we should be<br>giving more opportunities for learning<br>rather than kind of taking them away so<br>having leaving that flexible option I<br>think has been really valuable yeah<br>yeah I think I definitely agree with a<br>lot of the sentiment that Tessa was<br>saying I think that so covered broke out<br>in my third year of undergrad so I was<br>very lucky that I had you know like the<br>first year Hall experience and going<br>into second and third year was very like<br>normal otago social life and then going<br>into third year with the lockdown start<br>happening and I think I agree with the<br>sentiment that it's difficult to<br>recreate what you do in a lecture<br>theater in a desk in a bedroom on a<br>screen so I think especially coming from<br>someone who did the humanities and the<br>humanities are about discussion and<br>debate and arguing and what's right and<br>what's wrong and kind of fleshing out<br>the really big questions that we're<br>asking in society and I think it's so<br>hard to translate that debate into you<br>sitting on your laptop in your room I do<br>really have to commend my lecturers they<br>were really great throughout the whole<br>thing and they handled it in such an<br>impressive way and they were really<br>accommodating in terms of extensions or<br>if you needed to like drop or add a<br>paper but I just think overall it was<br>definitely really challenging to try and<br>recreate life at otago in a bedroom and<br>I also think it was quite difficult<br>going into 2021 and then 2022 and<br>sometimes it would have normal semesters<br>and we would be in classes and in<br>libraries and then we'd go into a<br>different lockdown or we would go into a<br>different alert level and then there<br>were more restrictions and so I think<br>the chopping and changing of it was also<br>very very difficult but I do agree as<br>well that<br>um<br>online learning is a little more<br>accessible for people especially people<br>who like might do part-time and work<br>full-time or might have young families<br>or might need to um catch up or like<br>re-watch things or go over something I<br>think it's really beneficial in that<br>sense and it's made it um more<br>accessible to lots of different people<br>but I think overall it was a very<br>challenging time and I think it's not<br>something you can recreate easily online<br>I think the main thing for me that comes<br>from all of this is I have a real<br>association with like every place has a<br>function so when I went from studying at<br>the library and going to classes every<br>day to going back home to my parents<br>house when we locked down I just could<br>not focus for days at a time and so I I<br>had ended up we had a separate like a<br>spare room which I ended up setting up<br>as a little office space so I could at<br>least associate it for study but then my<br>sisters also decided to join me in there<br>so now there's three people all trying<br>to zoom at once it was just not good on<br>Rural internet that can't handle three<br>people zooming and then they're trying<br>to talk as well quite an experience but<br>I I like the flexibility I think it's<br>really the thing so this year with this<br>job I've watched every single lecture<br>that I had online just so that I can do<br>my nine to five as work<br>and then catch up on my lectures at a<br>convenient time so on the weekends or<br>the afternoons and that has been<br>invaluable I think because otherwise<br>trying to balance this kind of work and<br>continue to study<br>wouldn't really work it would be really<br>disruptive to both those schedules and<br>so being able to break up that time in a<br>way that makes it manageable is probably<br>one of the better things to come out of<br>this because those lectures weren't<br>recorded pre-covered<br>I think also<br>um like I do science majors and<br>like in my microbiology papers we would<br>be trying to do Labs online where in<br>real life we would be like preparing and<br>like dealing with real bacteria and like<br>agar plates and trying to do that online<br>was almost impossible and it really took<br>away from some of those like practical<br>elements of University that I really<br>enjoyed so I found that particularly<br>challenging as well I did chemistry same<br>thing it was like we were just kind of<br>given graphs to analyze which is not as<br>much fun as actually doing the work but<br>also all the data was perfect because<br>you were given it and so you never had<br>to deal with any of the oh I ruined this<br>experiment and did not get what I want<br>or smashed my glassware everywhere and<br>had to start again but kind of like<br>learning experiences that are not<br>assessed but the useful parts of those<br>courses yeah yeah I say I'm very similar<br>to Quentin in that you know I have my<br>work study space and I have my don't<br>think about work in study space and when<br>they too merged it was it was not easy<br>yeah yeah I definitely agree with all<br>that and I also think in terms of<br>student journalism it was very hard to<br>create a magazine every week when there<br>wasn't a lot going on and you're like oh<br>weekly issue guys here's an article on<br>Zoom etiquette like it was very you were<br>really grossing at straws towards the<br>end of itself yeah I mean like I mean<br>backgrounds mute button yeah set up your<br>bed is the perfect study space<br>well and with that um you all kind of<br>lightly touched on in terms of<br>especially unable you touched about like<br>interaction being important and so one<br>of the things with online learning was<br>that online collaboration<br>um you know it sounded like you very<br>much want that in person and it's much<br>harder for you to have those debates<br>via Zoom<br>um if you could all just kind of talk<br>about what that has been like in terms<br>of how you interact with your peers in<br>that online learning space<br>yeah I think<br>um<br>for me I think it does go back to that<br>idea of I think when you study the<br>humanities and particularly because I<br>did Politics as well again it's all<br>about debate and like you're doing this<br>you're sitting in a room with other<br>people and you're being the critic and<br>conscience of society and is this right<br>is this wrong and I also think in covert<br>when the world went through a very big<br>transformational period of political<br>upheaval and social upheaval and covert<br>sort of upended every institution or the<br>structures we took for granted in<br>everyday life I think that was such a<br>time where you needed to have those<br>conversations and those discussions and<br>so I do think it was really difficult to<br>recreate that organic collaboration<br>recreate that idea of um<br>kind of seeking truth and discussion and<br>things like that and I mean yes it can<br>be done online because you can have like<br>break rooms and zoom where you get paid<br>up with someone and you can like you<br>know message them on Facebook if you<br>like doing an assignment together so it<br>is doable but it's just so not the same<br>as what university is built for which is<br>that discussion yeah I think Zoom rooms<br>especially were so they were trying to<br>recreate the same experience but they<br>did not have that effect in terms of<br>like when you're sitting in a lecture<br>theater or in a lab or whatever or a<br>tutorial you're usually sitting with<br>people like who you're friends with who<br>you're comfortable with you feel good<br>sharing your ideas whereas in a zoom<br>room it's just like you kind of paired<br>with like randoms in the class which is<br>exciting in a way because you get to<br>talk to some new people but it's just<br>kind of this awkward experience because<br>you don't really know each other it's<br>not like you've kind of had this like<br>building of like support and like<br>friendship you just kind of like discuss<br>this topic and you're like I don't know<br>this person like this is so quid so I<br>think that was definitely challenging<br>but I think<br>um like Facebook Messenger is like huge<br>for collaborating at Uni and is used a<br>lot and it's something that I use a lot<br>and especially for assignments and just<br>like groups and stuff as well yeah would<br>you guys have the same experiences yeah<br>definitely yeah I've vividly remember<br>like when a lecturer soon we're going<br>into breakout rooms now watching the<br>participants drop off in the call<br>because they're just like nope not doing<br>it and that was them done for that<br>tutorial they just weren't coming back<br>um just because everyone would turn the<br>cameras off too and you'd sit really<br>awkwardly there'd be like a 15 minute<br>window and everyone would just kind of<br>sit and say forward so that was about it<br>you hear tapping on a keyboard where<br>they looked up other things but so the<br>one I found hardest online was math<br>which I think I mean everyone Associates<br>people that do math is quite introverted<br>right but to do well and math you have<br>to do it collaboratively I simply if I'd<br>done it done my minor in math alone I<br>would not have passed and so trying to<br>to do that online it was really<br>difficult because when you're working<br>through the problems you know you might<br>all be able to get different parts but<br>you can't make those connections<br>yourselves and especially doing that<br>without being able to show you're<br>working and like how you got to those<br>stages just try to verbally explain this<br>really convoluted thing you've done was<br>really difficult and I think a lot of<br>people in my classes especially like we<br>did a paper on analysis which was really<br>new to everyone and it was just<br>impossible to explain these really<br>abstract Concepts without being able to<br>put it on paper and show people the way<br>let's see that's a actually a good<br>transition into kind of the Converse of<br>this online collaboration you know with<br>that remote online learning there's also<br>a lot more learning autonomy much more<br>self-guided because like you said many<br>of your lectures are recorded you can't<br>have that back and forth with your<br>instructor with your peers so readily<br>available and so you're more responsible<br>for your own Learning and Development<br>um I mean I can imagine especially for<br>you uh needing to be more of a practical<br>Learner in the lab that must have been<br>particularly interesting yeah and I<br>think my whole uni experience has been<br>during these like quite tumultuous times<br>so I kind of came in from high school<br>everything's like super structure you go<br>to your classes when you go to them when<br>you're told to and then coming here and<br>a lot of my lectures you could like just<br>do them whenever you wanted because I<br>just recorded and I was like I'm not<br>used to that like and I found it<br>challenging because I don't want that I<br>want I like structure I like having a<br>structured life and having to go from<br>everything being really structured to<br>like no structure or was really<br>um hard for me yeah<br>um but I did also at times enjoy the<br>flexibility that came with it yeah<br>yeah I think autonomy and choice are<br>very good to have especially when it<br>comes to your education and when you're<br>doing a degree that like you've chosen<br>to do a certain subject and do certain<br>papers I do think it was difficult<br>though because personally I'm a chronic<br>procrastinator<br>and being online like didn't really help<br>that because I'd be like oh just like<br>watch this later I can catch up on this<br>later and then you know you're like oh I<br>have a test tomorrow and I have about 13<br>lectures to watch<br>um so I think<br>um it depends on the personality<br>um I think it's really good for people<br>who want to make their own schedules but<br>I think for people like me who probably<br>progress it a bit or they get busy kind<br>of doing other things like I might be<br>caught up in something to do with critic<br>or something else I'm working on<br>um it can kind of go on the back burner<br>so I think structure and the idea of<br>like going to class and you have to go<br>this lecture we have to go this office<br>hour is really really good because you<br>know we have to be and and win and you<br>can schedule your day around it but I<br>think in the online context<br>it's sort of a double-edged sort of it's<br>great to make your own schedule and have<br>that autonomy and have that<br>self-direction but it's also kind of<br>like you could fall off the wagon pretty<br>quickly if you're a procrastinator like<br>I am yeah I worked out really quickly I<br>had to go to the zooms when they were<br>actually happening because if I didn't<br>they would get put on the back burner<br>really quickly and one of my papers was<br>like recorded and uploaded rather than<br>on Zoom so I had my Friday afternoon was<br>watching the whole week's lectures in<br>one go because otherwise I would not do<br>them and I'd end up falling further<br>behind which I think that autonomy<br>worked well but it also meant that I<br>kind of never checked out of studying<br>either because I would just always be oh<br>I can go and do this especially when we<br>were locked down at home I'd be like<br>okay I'll go work on this assignment<br>I'll go catch up on this and I burnt<br>myself out a bit more than I probably<br>would have if it had been going to class<br>you know walking to UNI spending my time<br>at Uni studying and then going back home<br>and so it was hard to separate like<br>myself and my social time from<br>from study and I think that was quite<br>taxi yeah I could actually like agree a<br>lot like the lines just become so<br>blurred between like Winner's lifetime<br>winners like existing outside of uni<br>time and we're guilty for doing fun<br>things yeah because you're at the same<br>day yeah I think one thing that helped<br>um or this is actually something that's<br>had been happening this year is to keep<br>people in check we have like a weekly<br>test that is worth one percent<br>um and it just means that you actually<br>have to do the lectures and I think it's<br>been valuable for it's only worth one<br>percent but people are willing to put in<br>a little bit of effort just for that one<br>percent and so they will best stay keep<br>um stay like up to date with the<br>lectures because I think coming off the<br>back of covert and all of the online<br>learning especially for people like me<br>you kind of have to like learn about<br>what a uni was like before all of this<br>like I'm kind of not used to it being so<br>structured in a way<br>um and so trying to like<br>um get into those change there how it<br>actually potentially more should be yeah<br>and I think that's a another good kind<br>of segue in terms of this has been a lot<br>of reflection so far as far as what that<br>two-year process was like<br>but moving forward you know now that<br>we're back I guess normalizing is you<br>know maybe where we can start using<br>again<br>um are you finding that your learning<br>practices and your preferences have<br>changed as a result of that more<br>exclusive online experience are you<br>finding that you miss any parts of it or<br>that you're finding a way to integrate<br>those two let me know the the in person<br>and the virtual<br>I think coming from the perspective of a<br>post-grad I think I<br>definitely have gone back to the<br>pre-covert way of going about University<br>for two reasons I think one<br>just personality wise I wasn't one for<br>online learning like I need the<br>structure I need the times<br>um I need to be sitting in a classroom<br>like doing the work working with others<br>collaborating and I also think when you<br>get to um the post-grade level of<br>Masters and honors and things like that<br>especially in Humanities so much of it<br>is based on seminars so instead of<br>having a lecture where you sit and<br>someone tells you information it's a<br>seminar of there's only like the five or<br>the 10 of you and you mean to sit around<br>and ask those questions and talk about<br>particular topics and analyze things and<br>debate so I think I'm a very big<br>advocate for the traditional kind of<br>pre-covered way of learning because I<br>think it's beneficial in terms of also<br>retaining information it's sort of that<br>logic of how when you teach someone<br>something else you're also going to<br>retain it so I think when you have that<br>active discussion and there's intention<br>and like emotion behind it you're not<br>sitting on a zoom being like God I wish<br>I wasn't doing this right now I think<br>it's 10 times more effective and I think<br>you're really getting your like money<br>and values worth out of your degree in<br>your program I mean yeah I I like the in<br>person but I also started working a lot<br>more kind of in the more recent years I<br>think just you know life gets expensive<br>and I liked not just living on a really<br>tight student budget so I started<br>working a lot more and the flexibility<br>that came with kind of those adaptations<br>we'd got from online learning was<br>invaluable for that because I mean I was<br>working at in restaurants so yeah shifts<br>could be all over the show and so some<br>weeks I'd be able to go to a lecture at<br>that time but some I wouldn't and it<br>meant that I could keep the job because<br>I was able to watch lectures online and<br>catch up which if everything had been<br>back in person and that really<br>structured method I couldn't have worked<br>there and so that was really valuable<br>but at the same time it was a lot harder<br>and then also clashes was the other one<br>that came quite helpful I knew because<br>I'd done a few years online that if I<br>had clashes and papers I could catch and<br>I'd know how to go on online and learn<br>on that system<br>because I'd done it before and I<br>couldn't knew that it worked for me to a<br>point whereas I would have been a lot<br>more reluctant to have taken papers with<br>clashes<br>if I hadn't done that already<br>yeah yeah I relate to that as well like<br>knowing that you can actually manage<br>your collection also from the<br>University's perspective knowing that<br>students can manage clashes as well<br>um yeah I think for me as I was saying<br>before it's definitely been trying to<br>transition into like what uni was like<br>before and really treating it as like a<br>job like yeah go to UNI at these times<br>and I do my uni then rather than just<br>like having so many Blurred Lines like<br>doing how many because I like in the<br>weekend and like that was so<br>um confusing<br>um just to try and like create balance<br>in my life but yeah<br>yeah and you know Clinton you said<br>something pretty interesting about uh<br>life getting expensive<br>that's that's another thing moving away<br>from you know this talk of online and<br>virtual and learning like let's let's<br>kind of move into that topic now<br>the you know global economy and New<br>Zealand's economy and whatever uh just I<br>think every student you know my parents<br>as well in the 70s<br>higher education has always been<br>expensive it's always good to have jobs<br>on the side but it seems like<br>particularly now I have not interacted<br>with a single student in my time here<br>that doesn't have at least one maybe two<br>three four jobs on the side<br>um how are you all finding<br>that kind of demand of wanting to get<br>this higher education the increasing<br>costs of it but then also wanting to<br>support yourself and have a good<br>experience while you're here<br>um what's that been like yeah so at my<br>Peak I had three jobs at once and it was<br>you know some weeks you were like oh I'm<br>Bulldog on full time and trying to do<br>full-time study and you could see that<br>the more work I did my grades dropped<br>like there's just that really clear<br>relationship between the two and so it<br>was quite difficult but at the same time<br>you know you've done a few years living<br>and on that really tight student budget<br>and that wears pretty thin pretty quick<br>when you can see your breath and your<br>flat and everything's going moldy so you<br>start deciding I have to do more than<br>that and it gets it's difficult and it's<br>part of why I decided to take a break<br>from study and go and work at ousa this<br>year was just because I needed some time<br>to earn a bit of money do something a<br>bit different and then come back and<br>study because I think it's just those<br>costs go up<br>yeah I think um I've I just wanted my<br>sixth year of uni now and I have always<br>worked um sort of my first few years I<br>would just do like waitressing<br>Hospitality I think I'm very lucky in<br>the sense of that I really love my work<br>so I get paid to work at critic and I<br>also do<br>um a lot of other kind of contract jobs<br>in the realm of like public relations<br>and marketing and that sort of industry<br>and so I'm very lucky that I work in the<br>industry that I studied to work in which<br>means you know it was worth paying for<br>the degree<br>and I also think that it's great because<br>I do have work from home options and<br>it's things like I'll get off at a<br>contract and as long as I fulfill the<br>hours you know I don't have to like<br>clock into a shift at a supermarket or a<br>um cafe or something I can kind of work<br>around my studies so I think I'm<br>definitely a minority in that sense of<br>that I love what I do and that I'm<br>working in my field and that it's all<br>contract and very flexible but I do<br>think for those first couple of years of<br>uni when I would work in hospitality and<br>it wasn't necessarily missing out on um<br>sort of academic opportunities or my<br>grade slipping it was more so the idea<br>of the social life so I was working<br>while I was in my Residential College<br>and I loved my hall and I made so many<br>friends but you know they were Friday<br>and Saturday nights where my whole floor<br>would go out and do something and go<br>clubbing or whatever and I just couldn't<br>because I had to go and like work at a<br>bar work at a restaurant so I think it<br>is sort of sad to think that you can't<br>have the full tertiary University great<br>College experience without having the<br>downside of working and missing out on<br>aspects of that lifestyle I think that's<br>probably a really challenging thing yeah<br>it really is just like work study social<br>pick too you know<br>yes I think like for me personally I<br>agree with with Annabelle where I I work<br>at past and I love it because I love<br>interacting with young people and<br>helping improve their experiences and I<br>love to teach as well so that's been<br>really valuable but last year I was a<br>dishwasher so I didn't enjoy anywhere<br>near as much<br>um and it's just like that is just the<br>nature of uni that if you want to<br>be able to pay rent pay for power pay<br>for Wi-Fi pay for food and then also<br>just like have a life where you can<br>occasionally go out to dinner with your<br>friends or you can like do your hobbies<br>like I personally am super active and<br>like to go and do heaps of Outdoors kind<br>of stuff and if I want to do that and<br>like enjoy my life then I have to work<br>and well for me it's private it's a<br>privilege because I love what I do lots<br>of people don't um have that experience<br>um and there's definitely huge inequity<br>issues as well in that in gene Community<br>as well like there is plenty of students<br>who don't have to do that I think<br>um and but then there's lots to do as<br>well and that can definitely create<br>um issues within that where lots of<br>students are having to spend times that<br>should be spent in my opinion like<br>relaxing and just enjoying your life<br>working or working when they during the<br>week when most people would be studying<br>um that can definitely have like<br>Downstream effects as well yeah<br>um so I mean Quentin you said it's kind<br>of you know pick two out of the three<br>important things<br>um I'd be interested to know if if you<br>or other people that you've spoken with<br>and maybe Annabelle you've been through<br>your time at the critic you've come<br>across some people who have shared their<br>insights on this<br>have any of you or someone else come up<br>with any sort of innovative cost-saving<br>measures over the past year or two<br>um the more time that I would spend at<br>the library the lower my power bill was<br>so that's quite a helpful one yes that's<br>that's really the big one is the less<br>time I spent it the flat the more money<br>I could save until you spend so far away<br>that you start buying more food up it's<br>kind of like you have to find that<br>balance like you need to live closer to<br>the library so you can yeah exactly so I<br>can duck home but I lived further away<br>to save on rent but it means I end up<br>buying more food out so again I probably<br>didn't balance that right yeah I think<br>it's<br>um<br>I think in my like first year I went<br>flooding it was definitely the stingy<br>like if you were away for two days<br>you're like I'm not paying for power I<br>wasn't there for two days but I think<br>um once I got to kind of like third and<br>fourth year me and a lot of my friends<br>kind of got to what we were like it's<br>gonna be expensive regardless we may as<br>well not be kind of not that you<br>shouldn't worry but we may as well not<br>kind of fret on like getting a certain<br>build down or doing this or doing that<br>and exhausting yourself of just getting<br>through the day for the sake of saving a<br>few dollars which might be very<br>different to other people but I think um<br>a lot of me and my friends kind of came<br>to the conclusion of you may as well<br>just turn on the heater and like have a<br>hot shower and<br>um you know buy the avocados<br>um and just kind of accept that you<br>might need to work an extra hour or two<br>throughout the week but it's sort of<br>better to pay a little bit more and be<br>kind of comfortable if you can do that<br>than to kind of get through just trying<br>to survive I think yeah agreed and it<br>just makes your like if you have a warm<br>house you're like it's easier to study<br>it's easier to just<br>um<br>feel good in your life I think I found<br>like last year definitely pretty stingy<br>and then we all could keep getting sick<br>like maybe we should just turn the<br>heater off and the sun would stop<br>happening so yeah it ends up being quite<br>good for social things because we agree<br>to hate the lounge so then everyone<br>comes into the lounge and we end up<br>talking and doing activities as a flat<br>rather than hiding in your room under<br>blankets so I think that was one good<br>thing and the other one is half press<br>bus fares I live further away to save on<br>rent and now that buses are cheaper<br>life hack yeah yeah have any of you had<br>to make any like difficult economical or<br>spending decisions in over the past two<br>years as a result of that of you know<br>trying to you know pursue your degrees<br>and and be a student here but also enjoy<br>life have you had to make tough choices<br>I think that was the choice to work was<br>the biggest one there was because I<br>didn't work for my first like three<br>years or if I did it was like two hours<br>a week and then last year I ended up<br>getting up to more like 20 hours a week<br>and so that really did cut into your<br>social time your extra study assignments<br>I used to spend two weeks on ended up<br>getting two days and I would notice that<br>oh I'm really pushing the deadline or<br>I'm not quite finishing that answer that<br>I could have finished if I'd given this<br>a bit longer and so those were difficult<br>ones and then I ended up cutting down<br>the work because I was burning myself<br>out but then you go okay maybe I won't<br>heat the house as much like it really<br>was<br>just not enough time in the day to make<br>everything work<br>yeah I think this is a hard one for me<br>to sort of speak on because I am<br>definitely a privileged minority of<br>students um I've been very<br>supported by<br>um like access to scholarships and like<br>family support and things like that so I<br>never really had to properly sit and<br>pick and choose between what I should<br>pay for what I should do but again I<br>think that that's shocking that I know<br>that I'm a minority and that's a very<br>small percentage of the population of<br>University students who do have that<br>privilege and who can do that and I also<br>think that because I kind of had a bit<br>more of a safety net than some other<br>people I was allowed to pursue jobs and<br>work in my field and do what I love so<br>it doesn't ever feel like working which<br>then in turn gives me access to more<br>money so I think it's definitely hard<br>for me to speak on I definitely<br>sympathize with the stories that I hear<br>a Critic of people<br>you know not being able to pay rent<br>sometimes or having to borrow money off<br>their friends and then it's awkward<br>because you're indent to someone else<br>and then you've got like this 80 grand<br>student loan and I think that I'm<br>generally been exposed to a lot of it<br>through who I've interviewed and who<br>I've spoken to and I also think that<br>is it is um<br>differently important and kind of<br>shocking to think that I'm such a small<br>minority in terms of my personal<br>situation<br>yeah yeah I would agree with antibi I've<br>always have been really privileged at<br>University in terms of access to<br>scholarships and that I do<br>um<br>can go home to my family over summer and<br>live there and have their support but<br>that doesn't mean that I'm not like<br>living week to week like I definitely<br>live on my student loan and the small<br>amount of money they make I definitely<br>live on that every single week and if<br>something was to go wrong oh I needed<br>needed a cash influx I just wouldn't<br>have that kind of money and I think that<br>that's most students feel that way yeah<br>and has any of this affected your your<br>schoolwork or your academics your study<br>habits and or your relationships with<br>others at the uh on campus I think<br>Financial stress just makes everything<br>um harder in terms of like what Quinta<br>was saying like you have to work<br>um and that just becomes the norm that<br>you have to do to survive basically and<br>that does make<br>um can make assignments saying<br>assignments and just handing things on<br>in on time definitely harder yeah yeah I<br>think it's definitely<br>um that's sort of a trick you want to<br>think about because I think it also<br>shows the disparity of you know you'll<br>be in a flat of like five or six people<br>and half those people might work and get<br>financial support and be perfectly fine<br>the other half might be struggling and<br>so when it comes time to pay the power<br>bill half the Flat's like oh you know<br>all good like that's normal price and<br>the other flatmates might be more kind<br>of straight for cash and so it sort of<br>seeps into your social life in terms of<br>who has what and who has access to money<br>and who has access to I guess time to do<br>those assignments and do well and so I<br>think that Financial stress is never fun<br>and it's never a good situation to be in<br>and I don't think anyone should have to<br>pick and choose between bills or doing<br>this or doing that<br>um and I think that it's always a shame<br>that that can seep into your social life<br>or your home life in terms of just being<br>a young person because being in your 20s<br>is like it's pretty rough sometimes I'm<br>not gonna lie so I think adding those<br>sort of elements on top can just make it<br>seem so much worse yeah yeah it's those<br>iniquities and time and financial<br>position that are a hard one because you<br>know some of you end up working when you<br>would be socializing or it's what you do<br>as the social activity too because if<br>you are working you might have more<br>money or if you get that financial<br>support your options expand a bit more<br>for the sorts of activities you want to<br>do versus someone who might not be in<br>that same position and then kind of how<br>do you balance that and it's just it's<br>just that stress that interpersonal<br>stuff is<br>it's probably the hardest part of it I<br>think<br>well let's uh move away from this<br>depressing conversation let's move into<br>something a little more exciting let's<br>talk about the integration of AI and<br>learning<br>um I don't know if you've heard there's<br>this new thing called Chachi PT maybe<br>maybe some of you use it or in ethical<br>ways uh let's let's talk about chat and<br>maybe even other AI tools that you're<br>using and then how that's affecting your<br>learning yeah I found it really<br>interesting actually in watching<br>different lecturers and different<br>departments right quite differently has<br>been interesting to watch I think also<br>um from like a digital literacy<br>perspective it's been quite interesting<br>like you can definitely see people who<br>are quite up to date with tick and then<br>people are like what is that<br>um or it gets brought up in the lecture<br>and that's the first time I've ever<br>heard about it but I've had some really<br>interesting experiences with it um one<br>of my lecturers we had to co-write an<br>essay with chat GPT which was a really<br>interesting exercise we had to like<br>pretty much create a prompt and try and<br>get chatubity to write the essay for us<br>and then we could<br>um edit it and so it was like a<br>co-creation which was really interesting<br>um it definitely highlighted how<br>unreliable it can be<br>um and also one of my exams this year<br>one of our questions was to like<br>critique a chat GPT answer for a<br>question based on all the knowledge that<br>we'd learned during the paper and<br>basically show that activity doesn't<br>know everything but I have and I<br>personally use it um just for explaining<br>things and I always like take a bit take<br>it with a bit of grain of salt and kind<br>of compare it to some other places but I<br>have found it as a valuable tool<br>um for my education yeah and those I<br>think it is important to adapt with<br>technology rather than just kind of<br>ignore it and pretend it's not happening<br>and I think the way that my lecturers<br>have tried to integrate it into the<br>courses that I take have been really<br>interesting<br>yeah I'm gonna give a bit of a different<br>option to that<br>um I I'm not a fan of chair gb2 or AI I<br>think<br>um from I guess a journalistic<br>perspective there's a lot of kind of<br>discourse and debate about it because of<br>Journalism and like writing articles is<br>in the pursuit of Truth and pure<br>information why would you use AI or<br>technology that is sort of manufactured<br>on its own and it doesn't come from a<br>place of true investigating or a true<br>kind of Journey to find out what's<br>really going on it's kind of you put it<br>in a computer and then it created<br>something and you're like well that's<br>what that is now<br>um but I also think in terms of<br>especially I guess in the field of<br>communications and media which is what I<br>study there was also a lot of debate in<br>discourse about it I think that<br>I'm very skeptical of technology and the<br>idea of like the tech World in general I<br>I often find it quite concerning how<br>quickly we let it into our lives with<br>kind of our any really critique or<br>debate around it like Ai and jgbt became<br>a thing and everyone's like oh great<br>it's here now we can use this and it's<br>like whoa like why are we kind of so<br>accepting and integrating offer when<br>we've seen how you know Facebook or like<br>any sci-fi movie ever or like just<br>anything in the past like five or ten<br>years you can find an example of how the<br>digital has gone wrong and it's sort of<br>that idea of um<br>you know we think it's this great new<br>invention but with every invention comes<br>a new set of problems right it's like<br>you build an airplane but they need a<br>black box in case something goes wrong<br>so it's sort of the same thing for AI<br>because we've invented this like great<br>thing but it's going to create a whole<br>new set of problems and I can see why<br>some subjects might be more kind of<br>willing to embrace it but I think again<br>in the humanities and media and<br>Communications<br>um we want to be critical of these<br>things that's the purpose of the field<br>and I also find it interesting that I<br>think the ba and Humanities in general<br>are kind of looked down upon in a way I<br>don't agree with that obviously at all<br>but I think that in society it's like oh<br>like you just did a ba like that's easy<br>I think that narrative is very damaging<br>and I thought it was interesting that<br>when AI first came into the university<br>sector the first thing everyone did was<br>sort of attack the humanities essay like<br>oh you can get gbt to just write your<br>essay so again like that's reinforcing<br>The Narrative that like your ba is<br>useless or the humanities are not as<br>important so I'm much more skeptical of<br>the whole thing and I have I could go on<br>but I won't<br>just to Edge that the purpose of my<br>lecturers using it was definitely to<br>highlight its<br>um downfalls basically like the essay<br>exercise that we did it was basically to<br>be like it can't write you a good essay<br>which I found actually in the exam<br>question as well around it it actually<br>doesn't know all the answers and that<br>you've know a far a lot more about it um<br>and I think in terms of having like<br>a day I think it's I would prefer that<br>lecturers are at least talking about it<br>rather than just being like don't use it<br>because they<br>they can't actually control that and<br>they might as well try and learn with<br>students and have conversations and<br>discussions about it rather than just<br>like a blanket don't use it yeah<br>um I think that the current versions of<br>the AI are just not good enough that you<br>need to be too worried about it yet so<br>it's chat GPT is terrible at math right<br>like it is absolutely rubbish so I had<br>some stuff because like you can tie it<br>into everything in here because I was<br>working online because I had to work I<br>was trying to get it to explain some<br>mathematical concepts for me and just<br>like more simple English than every<br>resource that I could find online and<br>the example it was working through was<br>just like blatantly wrong and it was so<br>adamant that it was correct but it said<br>like 2 times 4 was six and it's like no<br>that's just like doesn't work but it was<br>adamant that was the case and so it was<br>just absolutely useless at doing that<br>which kind of to me reinforced like that<br>it's not that useful yet and I did error<br>check some code for me which is helpful<br>I couldn't find little typos that I'd<br>made you plug that in and when it's here<br>and here and so that was quite helpful<br>rather than sitting there doing that for<br>20 minutes myself but beyond kind of<br>those as a tool I don't think it's too<br>problematic yet because the essays are<br>garbage right the the articles that it<br>will write will be garbage because it's<br>working on kind of that what is the best<br>like most probable next word that it's<br>got so it's only going to give the most<br>generic<br>boring response and you can tell that<br>from anything that it does create you<br>read it and you go that's written by AI<br>because all these sentences are really<br>regular lengths really plain English<br>like there's no Pizzazz to anything that<br>it puts out right it's just it's kind of<br>soulless work and and I think that's<br>because it's not created by a person and<br>so I think in a way we're lucky that<br>it's not at that point yet when it gets<br>here because we can now have these<br>debates about you know how can we use it<br>is this something we should be<br>progressing with because I definitely<br>have concerns about what better AI might<br>look like but I think those versions of<br>chat GPT and all the other ones we have<br>at the moment<br>are not good enough<br>that there's too much to be worried<br>about yet<br>yeah I think for me it is just that idea<br>of the slippery slope it's like we can<br>sit here now and say like oh like chat<br>GPT doesn't really work it doesn't<br>really give the answers it should but I<br>think you know technology moves so fast<br>and like I said we're so quick to be<br>like this is a thing now this is part of<br>our everyday lives this is part of our<br>institution let's just adopt it I think<br>it's a slippery slope of that might be<br>fine now because it's like pretty<br>average and it doesn't really work that<br>well but in five years from now or in 10<br>years from now for all we know we might<br>not be able to like make an autonomous<br>decision because the machines are gonna<br>take me to sound like I'm in a Sci-Fi<br>movie but you know like technology will<br>become so rampant it yeah it's just we<br>need to make sure that we don't get too<br>far ahead of ourselves I think is the<br>thing oh yeah don't don't get me wrong I<br>mean like I'm I'm very much on the uh<br>you know very always skeptical about it<br>you know we were talking before the show<br>about other Technologies and I told you<br>I say adamantly away from anything<br>social media related I miss my 90s flip<br>phone<br>um so I'm still very scheduled as well<br>but but it is interesting it is here and<br>we are figuring out what it is it's<br>voice it's identity its uses its pros<br>and cons<br>and universities are going to have to<br>start to come up with policies related<br>to these tools what do you all think<br>those policies at least what we have now<br>should be<br>as far as using these tools<br>I think that I mean as I said I don't<br>think that the tools are phenomenal yet<br>and so we can look at them as tools<br>rather than as<br>like complete you know going to going to<br>take away the humanities essay and<br>instead you could use it as a way of<br>proofing some proving some of your work<br>and checking kind of if you can work<br>with it there's less to be concerned<br>about than if we ban it blankly because<br>then you will have students who will use<br>it anyway and they might have used that<br>you know where do you draw the line kind<br>of with that if you're going to ban it<br>blankly of this is like you know mild<br>academic misconduct because they've used<br>that tool and so I think that you need<br>to embrace that it's there question the<br>ethics of it question how we want to<br>integrate it but accept it as a tool<br>because otherwise people were asking the<br>same questions when calculators came out<br>for mathematics should you be doing<br>these you know doing this by hand or<br>putting it in your calculator and you<br>can use that to speed up how we can<br>learn math how you can use math how you<br>can teach it what you can do in a course<br>and so I think that as long as we're<br>skeptical of it think about the the<br>right uses of it and use it as a tool it<br>has a place yeah I think<br>um<br>my degree I've done some programming<br>with rstudio which is like a statistical<br>software and yeah it's really great for<br>just being like where's the error yes<br>and I think that really has and like<br>bioinformatics which is kind of like<br>biology and statistics combined as a<br>field<br>um is is really valuable and can really<br>accelerate jobs like that and also<br>degrees involved in that purely just<br>because you have to do less work<br>yourself which sounds bad but that's<br>just like you run it in those compilers<br>and it'll be like errors are almost<br>helping yeah um yeah and I think it can<br>be really valuable in in that way and so<br>thus we shouldn't just have blanket ban<br>on it but I think in terms of how<br>Humanities it is scary<br>um and I think the whole point of a<br>degree in general in my opinion is a lot<br>about creating<br>um that critical thinkers and it can<br>kind of take away some of that so it's<br>definitely something that needs to be<br>thought about a lot in terms of like<br>policy making yeah I definitely think<br>there is<br>an emerging field within the humanities<br>called digital Humanities which seeks to<br>deal with this very topic which is great<br>because it proves that Humanities are<br>very useful and oftentimes and also<br>um just because it provides a place for<br>people to sit and think is this ethical<br>how do we go about it and like Quentin<br>was saying for the mathematicians and<br>the scientists which I'm definitely not<br>a mathematician<br>it's good for you know chicken code and<br>checking those quick facts and whatever<br>but I think in terms of keeping the idea<br>of being the critic in the conscience of<br>society and keeping the idea of debate<br>and the ethical idea of truthful<br>journalism and truthful writing I think<br>it's definitely important that we<br>regulate it we put the brakes on and say<br>we don't necessarily need to reject this<br>and throw it in the bin and be done with<br>it but we need to sit and think what are<br>the repercussions of this how quickly<br>can this get away on us and definitely<br>ask those big questions and not be so<br>quick to agree to into our everyday<br>lives<br>that's a lot to think about<br>I do have one final question for you all<br>before we get into our q a session<br>with everything we've talked about today<br>you know these new tools the this hybrid<br>learning of online in person and you<br>know the economic struggles facing many<br>students today<br>what do you see higher education or<br>universities looking like the landscape<br>of them in 10 20 years from now how do<br>you see them being similar or very<br>different<br>I think we'll see a lot more online<br>distance learning and I think that's<br>just because of the way like people are<br>continually wanting to learn more so<br>than they ever did and I think that's<br>part of you know nowadays when you could<br>have got a job you then needed a<br>bachelor's and now you're looking like<br>you need a masters as people have to<br>keep pushing out when they can get to<br>that qualification that'll get them into<br>the workforce they're also going to want<br>to start working and whatnot so that<br>online learning will kind of work in<br>tandem with people who are wanting to<br>upskill alongside so you'll end up doing<br>like the online MBA is becoming a really<br>big thing getting really popular and I<br>think we'll see more of that those kind<br>of professional level degrees<br>becoming a thing as people choose to<br>switch careers as these Technologies<br>emerge that might open up new fields of<br>work so that we can see people weaving<br>between and I think that that's only<br>ever going to work digitally because<br>people can't afford to quit their job<br>for two years and come back and study<br>and then go back into the workforce so I<br>think that and I don't think that's<br>something to be afraid of either I think<br>that looking at new ways that we can<br>make learning more accessible is always<br>a good thing and opening it up to people<br>that might not have ever thought they'd<br>come back and do Masters but I think<br>just making sure that like the education<br>remains as good and still provides<br>people with all the skills not just<br>tooling them for jobs helping them for<br>whatever they might want to get to but<br>doing all the things that a degree needs<br>to do is probably what needs to be<br>focused on as we move into that kind of<br>digital learning space for people that<br>in order for us to kind of move forward<br>and make education really Innovative and<br>and things like that moving into the<br>future I think we can't look at just<br>universities as an institution and just<br>be like oh are they going to go online<br>or are they going to not go online we<br>need to kind of look at everything all<br>at once so it's not just University it's<br>housing and regulations and the cost of<br>rent and flexibility and jobs and wages<br>like it's they're all these like<br>interconnected ideas that will come<br>together and they're all such in intense<br>and so you know I do agree with Quentin<br>that I think online learning is great in<br>terms of accessibility like with our MBA<br>programs people who want to go back and<br>study while continuing to work or their<br>employers might you know subsidize the<br>cost of that to get them more qualified<br>I think those sort of initiatives are<br>great but I really hope that<br>universities do hold on to what they<br>have been historically in those centers<br>and those places for debate and<br>discussion and that the humanities are<br>still you know taken seriously and<br>there's still an incremental part of the<br>education system and the educational<br>institutions and I think that world<br>technology has been you know well and<br>good in terms of accessibility I hope<br>that universities do maintain what they<br>have been historically as those places<br>for that discussion and that debate and<br>I also think that it should highlight<br>why we need you know like I was saying<br>rental controls we just think about how<br>much we're paying for paying people in<br>minimum wage positions and so I think<br>that when we think about the future we<br>don't just think about the university as<br>an isolated institution it's everything<br>all at once<br>yeah I would agree<br>um just like from an actual like<br>educator<br>um perspective I would really like to<br>see<br>um Educators making a really conscious<br>conscious decisions to provide more<br>flexible learning outcomes and being<br>okay with that like as discussed<br>students have complex lives and lots<br>going on and there's a variety of<br>different ways to kind of like a tackle<br>University and I think trying and<br>providing more ways to learn and more<br>varied ways to learn would be really<br>great yeah yeah I think it really is<br>about thinking about it as a business<br>you know if you're a university or<br>institution you're selling a product<br>you're selling degrees and experiences<br>and it's perhaps thinking about maybe we<br>need to think about selling a new<br>product or repackaging it in some way<br>doesn't mean you get rid of the old<br>product no no not a new one as well yeah<br>yeah yeah yeah keep adding on to your<br>inventory yes and I think the the<br>in-person experiences at University are<br>extremely valuable so we should<br>definitely keep those around like don't<br>fully switched online<br>horrible well let's open it up to uh<br>questions from our audience again if<br>you're watching online via Zoom please<br>uh submit those questions and I will<br>read them from my handy device here and<br>if you're in the studio just raise your<br>foreign<br>thank you for that<br>um my questions around engaging with<br>recorded lectures and things like that<br>it seems to me a burden that you've<br>taken on yourselves trying to manage<br>keeping up with that material<br>in your experience what techniques and<br>styles have instructors had that made<br>um one of my lectures this year I've<br>kind of done like a flipped learning<br>approach where we watched the recorded<br>video first before going into class and<br>then we the class is just kind of like a<br>discussion revision of the content and<br>I've really enjoyed that approach lots<br>of people probably haven't enjoyed it as<br>much but she and the recorded lecturers<br>puts like little<br>um<br>kind of like like will ask questions<br>about the content or like maybe puts an<br>McQ in and I found that just like uh<br>nice to stay engaged with it because you<br>kind of like learn something and then<br>you do like a little question about it<br>or it'll be like a discussion point or<br>something and then it'll get brought up<br>in the in the class lecture which has<br>been cool because you're not just<br>sitting there for like an hour just like<br>can't even thrown at you you can like<br>contribute back which I found really<br>cool and also the one percent weekly<br>test that I mentioned are really good<br>because you like have to watch them to<br>be able to do the test which<br>um it's cool yeah and it's like a good<br>way to stay in check yeah yeah I think a<br>lot of students are going to cancel me<br>when I say this but I think making<br>participation part of the grading so I<br>think something that really incentivizes<br>people to go to a class go to a<br>tutorials being like you don't go have<br>fun paying to take another paper because<br>like you fail this one so I think you<br>know a lot of papers that I've done it's<br>like 10 to 15 of the grade is class<br>participation and not just showing up<br>like actually talking and raising your<br>hand and asking a question so I think<br>that could be a really good way to get<br>people involved because I think that's a<br>good incentive to not only have them go<br>regularly but it will probably make life<br>easier and the Long Haul I imagine<br>because the more engaged you are with<br>content or the more you're kind of<br>taking the learning in the more likely<br>students are to I think enjoy the paper<br>and also I think the idea of<br>collaboration and what you're talking<br>about with the kind of weekly one<br>percent test<br>um and like watching the video and then<br>going into the class I think that's also<br>a really good idea because again it is<br>that logic of if you learn something and<br>then have to kind of repeat it or kind<br>of you know teach it to someone else<br>you're probably going to retain it and<br>actually be really into it so I think it<br>all comes down to the idea of<br>um incentivizing and then<br>I don't want to say penalizing but I<br>guess penalizing if it is lacking<br>without reason of course if someone has<br>a reason for not going then that's a<br>different story but I think it's hard<br>because we have just spent like quite a<br>lot of this talking about like flexible<br>approaches to learning and then like<br>make it more accessible and by enforcing<br>class participation in a way you you are<br>like taking away some of that autonomy<br>which is it's a hard part to balance I<br>can't lie I was gonna say yeah I think<br>if you have that participation one it<br>has to be with caveats just in case<br>someone is working and studying<br>separately or something because I don't<br>I would hate to penalize someone if it's<br>their situation as opposed to a choice<br>not to attend I think that hybrid<br>learning is the hardest one to deal with<br>in this space because you know if you go<br>to an in-person one you're a bit more<br>engaged just by the nature of being<br>sitting next to a person and kind of<br>that conversational approach and with an<br>online thing you can tailor it so for me<br>it really is that interactivity so even<br>if it's not like sitting on a zoom and<br>having a come conversation because a lot<br>of people don't like that but a way that<br>there's a little just questions that you<br>might answer based upon things that<br>you've had something that kind of makes<br>you think about the content as you're<br>going rather than just sitting there<br>listening to what's a podcast for 45<br>minutes something that kind of draws you<br>into it a bit more and that's where the<br>kind of hybrid version is difficult<br>because you have to do that kind of<br>something that goes in person and<br>something that suits online I had one<br>lecturer who if you went to his lectures<br>in person he would give you little clues<br>about the exam before the recording went<br>on so that it was incentivized for me to<br>go because you could just kind of get a<br>bit of a better feel for the content<br>um but just yet something that gives you<br>a reason to engage and to not tune out<br>and click on another tab is really I<br>think the the best way to do it<br>uh we do have a question from our Zoom<br>room uh it's from Simon asks if any of<br>you have had any experience of teaching<br>staff adding polls to recordings so<br>that's kind of what I was talking about<br>before where we um the this teaching<br>this uh lecture will like sometimes<br>it'll be like a poll like related to the<br>content or it'll be like a discussion<br>point question where it's like what do<br>you think about this and then we'll go<br>and discuss that in class like in a few<br>days time or it'll be mcqs but<br>um I've also had like polls on Zoom I<br>think you can run polls on them or<br>questions which is because I just I<br>really like appreciate when there's an<br>immediate<br>opportunity to like to supply your<br>knowledge and think about it in a<br>different way rather than just being<br>like memorize all of this you can then<br>go and apply it and that helps retention<br>anyway yeah foreign<br>yeah I think that's sort of a tricky one<br>for me to speak on because when I first<br>when I was in third it was when we first<br>went into covert and so I think the<br>first couple of lockdowns so much of it<br>was like just get through the paper just<br>get through the lockdown I think there<br>was really kind of time to think about<br>like how do I make this you know fun and<br>interactive because everyone's like I<br>just want to get through this lockdown<br>um and then obviously again in post-grad<br>I think that because it's very small<br>groups of people like usually only five<br>or ten in a class and it's you know in<br>person it's kind of all about their<br>discussion and that debate I don't<br>I think I've ever had any experiences<br>with like an interactive or like a poll<br>in a zoom because I think that it's not<br>really a thing anymore so I think it's<br>difficult to for me to speak on that but<br>I can see why it would be a good<br>incentive to get people into zooms to<br>kind of do like fun little things like<br>that yeah so the things that I'm talking<br>about are on a recording on Echo 360 so<br>they're like embedded in the video yeah<br>yeah I've not really had much experience<br>with it at all but I do think it would<br>help just something that kind of gives<br>me a reason to go and engage I know some<br>papers that I have had now do a thing<br>after each lecture is literally one<br>question related to the content that<br>you've covered and it's a separate web<br>page but you still go into it and you<br>have 24 hours after the lecture to do it<br>to try and keep you on top of the<br>lectures and so my flatmate was doing<br>the paper a year later and he found that<br>a really good way to keep on top of them<br>because he was a prolific procrastinator<br>and so the papers that had those he was<br>on top of the lectures the whole time<br>and the papers that didn't started to<br>wow<br>well that just about uh wraps up our<br>time we're just about at the hour mark<br>so we do need to give some<br>acknowledgments I'll begin my sign off<br>by first thanking the three of you for<br>joining us today thank you for being<br>here sharing your insights and providing<br>such simulating conversation you've<br>given us all a lot to think about so<br>thank you I would also like to thank<br>everyone in the audience both online via<br>zoom and those of you who joined us in<br>the studio today and of course we'd like<br>to acknowledge the committee for the<br>advancement of learning and teaching for<br>facilitating this Carrero series as well<br>as the media production team for<br>bringing it all together and putting on<br>such an amazing show so thank you again<br>to everyone involved but that is our<br>time and that is the end of this Carrero<br>be sure
