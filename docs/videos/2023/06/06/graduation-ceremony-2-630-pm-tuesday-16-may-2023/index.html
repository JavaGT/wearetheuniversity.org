Professor Wendy Lerner I'm the<br>Provost of the university and I'm<br>delighted that you could join us to<br>celebrate the achievements of your<br>family member friend or colleague<br>as well as being proud Spectators you<br>are also formal witnesses to these<br>official proceedings<br>a very warm welcome also to whanau and<br>Friends throughout our Terra and across<br>the globe viewing these proceedings via<br>before we begin our formalities however<br>we would like just to take a moment a<br>moment of silence to recognize the<br>tragic events in our city last night so<br>foreign<br>thank you<br>I would now like to introduce you to the<br>chancellor of taharangawaka Victoria<br>University of Wellington<br>this is a role that dates back to the<br>Middle Ages when the first universities<br>were established<br>the chancellor is the chair of the<br>University Council which is the<br>governing body responsible for setting<br>the University's strategic Direction<br>ladies and Gentlemen please welcome the<br>chancellor John Allen<br>my name is John Allen it's great to be<br>here to celebrate this is a celebration<br>this is your celebration if you are<br>graduating this evening it is a<br>celebration of your achievements it is a<br>celebration of the fact that you've<br>managed to face up to all the challenges<br>through your academic career and Triumph<br>in the examinations and other sorts of<br>tests that you've had to go through to<br>be here tonight<br>it's a celebration and recognition of<br>all those people that have supported you<br>on that Journey family friends whanau<br>from wherever they are because without<br>them you simply would not have achieved<br>it's a recognition of the quality of the<br>academics in this institution tearing a<br>walk of Victoria University of<br>Wellington world-class leaders<br>world-class thinkers and world-class<br>teachers supported by a fantastic team<br>of Professionals in to to enable you to<br>succeed and it is a recognition of the<br>importance of universities here in<br>aotearoa New Zealand<br>you know when I was leaving the parade<br>uh today I was asked by someone whether<br>I'd been at the coronation<br>they thought that the robes you see put<br>me in that sort of coronation-esque vibe<br>and you know as we paraded in today with<br>the Fanfare going and all of that there<br>are mysteries about universities that<br>many people find perplexing they see us<br>as being somewhat isolated they see us<br>as being institutions that are on the<br>hill rather than involved in real life<br>they see us as being Dusty academics<br>doing Arcane sorts of disciplines<br>researching stuff that doesn't really<br>matter they see us as talking Latin and<br>we will later they see us<br>so we do so that's true uh at least in<br>that in in that regard<br>they see us largely as not engaging in<br>the real world and you know when I know<br>that that is fundamentally wrong about<br>this University in this place at this<br>time<br>you know that there are major challenges<br>that we have to address you know about<br>the various crises that are confronting<br>our society<br>you know that artificial intelligence<br>and chat gbt and all of those<br>Technologies are threatening the<br>cohesion of society<br>you know that climate is an existential<br>crisis that we are all addressing<br>so there are heaps and heaps of reasons<br>why this celebration is important<br>because it is a statement about human<br>potential it is a statement about<br>institutions that enhance human<br>potential and is a statement about the<br>importance of research the importance of<br>thinking and independent thinking in<br>solving the wicked problems of our time<br>now I need to say to you that this is<br>not the first generation to have some<br>problems because I was thinking about<br>what poem I would use because poetry of<br>course is important to business and<br>legal audiences you'd be wondering when<br>the poems were coming<br>uh because it's only through the art and<br>energy of poems that you would be<br>thinking how do we express the<br>creativity that is law the creativity<br>that is business certainly the<br>creativity that is necessary if we<br>collectively are going to address these<br>poems uh these challenges now<br>well we won't address the poems tonight<br>I could do I could do it socratically I<br>suppose with the front row but but only<br>the lawyers would get that<br>uh a hundred years ago there were also<br>challenges uh we were on the Outback you<br>know the sort of Eve of the outbreak of<br>War II and a poet by the name of Orden I<br>wrote a poem called first September<br>1939.<br>uh and it went something like this like<br>I normally get these things wrong so<br>just go with me and if you know it and I<br>get it wrong just interject uh it's it<br>goes something like this defenseless<br>under the night uh world and stupor lies<br>but everywhere ironic flashes of light<br>break out wherever the just exchange<br>their messages<br>May lie I like them composed of Eros and<br>of Eros that is end of dust beleaguered<br>by the same negation and despair<br>show an affirming Flame<br>now that is an extraordinary poem<br>because what it is saying is that<br>whatever the challenge<br>whatever the challenge it is us as<br>individuals and as communities it is<br>small actions that we can take that are<br>going to transform and address that<br>challenge<br>so you might be sitting in the law<br>faculty and you might be thinking you<br>know you want to be the personal<br>advocate for new Declaration of Human<br>Rights you want magical language like<br>you know all people are created equal in<br>rights and dignity are born equal in<br>rights and dignity fabulous language<br>that transforms and lifts the whole<br>planet<br>but you and I know that the real work in<br>the legal profession the real work of<br>the law is in the ordinary lives of<br>people is it engaging with ordinary<br>people in ordinary places as they tussle<br>with the ordinary challenges of life and<br>so it has been with our legal profession<br>over so many years as thousands of years<br>of accumulated lived experience is<br>expressed in our law as expressed by<br>judges<br>since time seems time in a memorial at<br>least to me it is those small acts that<br>make the difference in business<br>similarly you might be thinking I want<br>to build the next zero and that's a<br>magnificent aspiration<br>but you've got to start somewhere start<br>building something and you know and I<br>know that businesses can create huge<br>contributions to community Through<br>employment through Innovation and<br>through new products and technologies<br>that can address the very Wicked<br>problems that we have addressed that we<br>have talked about this evening<br>so the truth is that to start making the<br>change that is required to deliver a<br>prosperous stable peaceful harmonious<br>engaged cohesive country and world<br>we start here we start with ourselves we<br>start with our teachers and our<br>learnings we start with our cultures we<br>start with our friends and find our own<br>family and that gives us the strength to<br>be able to address these challenges and<br>I want to say to you as graduates of<br>tehringa Waka Victoria University<br>tonight<br>that while there are enormous challenges<br>you have much more capability<br>to address those challenges than any<br>generation before you<br>I want to say to you that I am confident<br>that you can address those challenges in<br>fact you know Odin spoke of a little<br>flickering light may I like them be a<br>little flickering light sort of In The<br>Bleak Gloom of despair<br>well I want to suggest to you that if we<br>all did the flickering light thing we'd<br>have a bloody great Searchlight that'd<br>go beaming I'm not sure I should have<br>said that should I that's being live<br>streamed I'm probably in trouble now<br>with the vice Chancellor nonetheless you<br>know what I mean would have a huge life<br>would have the strength of all of us<br>together the power to transform the<br>world<br>and so what I want to say to you is that<br>with this brain's trust with these<br>amazing academics and with the history<br>that they represent in thousands of<br>years of tradition and learning from<br>different cultures different times with<br>your energy and your enthusiasm and your<br>engagement as a new generation with your<br>own challenges and your own problems and<br>your own ways of addressing those<br>problems the Alchemy and this University<br>comes from those things banging together<br>as that whole tradition and your new<br>energy comes together and in that<br>Alchemy there is transformation so I<br>could tell you what a university is and<br>the lawyers would tell me that I should<br>read the Education and Training act 2020<br>and they'd tell me something about you<br>know it's all about higher level<br>learning and it's all about world-class<br>teaching and research and it's about<br>something called uh critical conscience<br>of society which actually we have a a a<br>recognized expert in uh in this<br>University of coffee drinking uh member<br>of the law faculty who I won't name<br>because it'd be deeply embarrassed but<br>it goes Dean as the first name anyway<br>anyway<br>we're a leader in critical conscience of<br>society but the point I am making to you<br>is this<br>that you can now in fact I'll go to<br>another poem just to make the point more<br>elegantly than I can I'll go to poem by<br>a chat called Glenn Calhoun some of you<br>will know New Zealand poem uh and he<br>wrote a poem called The Art of standing<br>upright<br>which was uh is a marvelous poem about<br>how you can stand properly an old<br>tildower he'd been up with Napoli in the<br>far north he himself is a Pacquiao<br>doctor in Auckland and he said this he<br>said the art of standing upright here<br>that is here in aotearoa New Zealand is<br>the art of standing on two feet one is<br>for holding on<br>the other is for letting go and I love<br>it I just love it and I could see you<br>loved it too and I love it because what<br>it says is you've got to stand up and<br>you've got to stand for something if you<br>want to make a difference it says you've<br>got to Anchor yourself in your culture<br>in all your family and everything that<br>you have learned in your University that<br>gives you the strength in your left leg<br>and then you've got a spring with that<br>left leg into an uncertain future you've<br>got to take risks you've got to take<br>that step<br>and when you do you can transform the<br>world so in that Spirit can I<br>congratulate you can I congratulate all<br>your friends and whanau who are here to<br>support you can I congratulate your<br>teachers who helped you and the<br>Professional Services people who have<br>helped them and can I say to you that we<br>at towering a walker are proud of you<br>and we are expecting great things from<br>you there are challenges you can meet<br>those challenges we can change the world<br>so after that terrific speech I'm going<br>to ask the chancellor to come back and<br>confer an honorary degree<br>yeah<br>as
