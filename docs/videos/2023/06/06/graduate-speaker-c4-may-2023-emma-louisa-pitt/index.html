Chancellor<br>academic staff family friends and most<br>I feel really honored and privileged to<br>be speaking to you on this special day a<br>day that marks the end of a challenging<br>but hopefully worthwhile chapter in our<br>lives<br>for some of you here this is the end of<br>your studying journey and I wish you all<br>the best as you make your way in the<br>world and face exciting New<br>Opportunities<br>and for those of us here who have<br>further years of studying ahead I wish<br>us only good luck for many more years of<br>I would like to recognize all the unique<br>Journeys that we've all been on in the<br>different paths that have led us here<br>some of you moved cities or even<br>countries to study here<br>some of you came here straight out of<br>high school like I did along with all<br>the other aucklanders you're welcome<br>well others came back later in life some<br>of you had to look after children<br>and others had to juggle work and<br>several other commitments some of us<br>here battled with our physical and<br>mental health and others walked<br>alongside friends and family who had<br>these struggles<br>most of us have had to battle the online<br>the online learning and all the other<br>challenges that came with lockdowns such<br>as the extra stress on our family and<br>personal lives I'd like to acknowledge<br>all these different experiences and<br>commend you on your hard work and<br>perseverance throughout your journey<br>however despite all our different<br>Journeys I still think we will always be<br>bound together by those late nights<br>finishing assignments that<br>disappointment when you don't get the<br>grade you want never get sold or that<br>feeling in class when you're very<br>confused but too embarrassed to put up<br>your hand and ask a question because<br>you're certain it's only you who's<br>confused<br>now I don't want to paint two Grim of a<br>picture here so I'd also like to touch<br>on the positive aspects that we all<br>share such as when you find out everyone<br>else in the class is just as confused as<br>you are when you bond with friends about<br>that Mutual confusion and come up with<br>theories about what in the world the<br>lecturer might have meant or getting<br>that Mark on the test you really wanted<br>and I'm sure everyone here knows a<br>relief you get when you hit that submit<br>button on an assignment however<br>temporary this feeling may be when you<br>realize you've missed out an entire<br>section oops<br>whatever experiences we've had I think<br>we can fairly say it's been a journey<br>whether it's going from carefully<br>selecting your outfits as a fresher in<br>first year and actually caring about<br>your appearance at Uni don't deny it to<br>turning up to lectures in third year in<br>sweatpants and a hoodie we've come such<br>a long way<br>we have grown immensely and not just<br>academic capacities but also personal<br>and social capacities we've made<br>lifelong friends being pushed out of our<br>comfort zone learned life skills and<br>hopefully a lot of knowledge and how to<br>juggle multiple commitments so well done<br>now they say it takes a village to raise<br>a child but I've always wondered just<br>how many villages it would take to get<br>that child through University<br>to all the families friends and academic<br>staff here<br>perhaps you can answer this question<br>I'd like to take a moment to acknowledge<br>all the families and whanau here who<br>have tirelessly supported us in various<br>ways from Get Go<br>you've provided the solid foundations<br>for us to even think of taking on this<br>challenge which has seen us persevere to<br>be here today<br>whether it was those free home-cooked<br>meals your encouragement providing a<br>place to stay rent free over summer or<br>gently nudging us to get on with the<br>study we wouldn't be here without you<br>to all the friends in the room who cried<br>with us when we were close to giving up<br>who laughed with us when we were over<br>tired and everything seemed funny<br>and who shared notes with us when other<br>commitments came up thank you<br>to all the boyfriends girlfriends and<br>partners out there you're often<br>neglected in these features but your<br>unconditional support when we were a<br>mess or spent weekends during<br>assignments has not gone unnoticed I'd<br>like to especially mention my partner<br>Nathan for supporting me through this<br>journey<br>and last but certainly not least is the<br>academic staff here<br>your dedication and commitment to our<br>learning is incredible and it is you who<br>make this University such an inspiring<br>place to be<br>the countless times that you stayed<br>behind after class to explain something<br>that you'd already explained multiple<br>times in the lecture well those quick<br>replies to our emails when it's late at<br>night and we're freaking out about an<br>assignment and we forget that you also<br>have a life outside of uni<br>I mean just the effort that you put into<br>making your lectures interesting and<br>engaging I've only been talking for<br>about five minutes here and I'm pretty<br>sure I've already lost a few people in<br>the room<br>so thank you<br>seeing your passion and what you teach<br>is contagious and it has certainly<br>sparked passion in US<br>whatever you do now whether it's<br>continuing study<br>getting your dream job or one that's<br>completely unrelated to your degree<br>because that also happens I hope you use<br>your knowledge in critical thinking<br>skills that we've been taught here so<br>well to make positive change in the<br>world however that might look for you<br>so thank you for listening to me speak I<br>hope you enjoy the rest of your night<br>and celebrations you most certainly<br>deserve it thanks</p></main><footer style="margin-top: 2rem; background: #0001; padding:
