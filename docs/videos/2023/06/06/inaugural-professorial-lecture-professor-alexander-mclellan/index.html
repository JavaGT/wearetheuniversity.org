uh<br>and duty to welcome you here tonight to<br>this inaugural professorial lecture for<br>Alex McMillan<br>I stand under the<br>umbrella of the people of this place<br>to tanu tutanu so the house that stands<br>and to those that have passed<br>um May you go in peace as you go into<br>darkness and I think with Alex's talk<br>tonight about research that leads to<br>advances in<br>um awful diseases such as cancer can we<br>remember those that have been lost<br>before their time to such diseases and<br>recognize the value of the research that<br>we do here and around the world to make<br>sure that that happens as little as<br>possible in the future<br>um<br>um and greetings to everyone are<br>priest PVC Health Sciences I met Sue<br>Smith Dean<br>BMS Professor cook head of Department of<br>microbiology and Immunology uh inakoto<br>and in particular to Professor McClellan<br>tianakwe uh welcome and greetings to<br>this good occasion for you and your<br>whanau and uh<br>tenakoto to for your family and friends<br>Harry uh and Lawrence I think your son<br>and and partner are here and I believe<br>Dave and Jan in-laws are in for<br>attendance as well so welcome to you all<br>I hope you enjoy the evening and to<br>those online uh know my heart of my<br>welcome<br>it's a beautiful evening here in Dunedin<br>if you're from somewhere else you're<br>missing great weather as always it's<br>sunny every day so please come down and<br>visit us finally<br>um uh<br>academic staff and professional staff<br>to those other visitors that we've got<br>from the Dunedin Community from other<br>parts of the South Island from New<br>Zealand and around around the Four Winds<br>it's also my great pleasure to welcome<br>you here tonight my role is to give a<br>brief introduction to what an IPL is and<br>then hand over to Professor Master Sue<br>Smith who will present Alex for his<br>professorial lecture these are very<br>simply a celebration of the academic<br>achievement of our best and brightest<br>staff who have<br>worked hard to achieve the Pinnacle<br>promotion in our in our academic ranks<br>the promotion of to Professor this is<br>not a promotion that everyone gets to in<br>their career and that's fine it's not<br>it's not an expected point but it's a<br>point that requires demonstration of<br>outstanding abilities measured against<br>International standards International<br>referees are used to assess our<br>promotion applications for professor in<br>all aspects of academic life in teaching<br>in research and in service not only<br>performance at a higher standard but<br>leadership is expected you'll hear from<br>Professor Madison Smith more of the<br>detail of Alex's career that has led to<br>that and the leadership is demonstrated<br>but I just want to highlight that Alex<br>you are a very popular and effective<br>supervisor at all level the fact that<br>you take students into your lab as<br>undergraduates as honors students as PG<br>dip my as nphd students talks to your<br>care for that research progression your<br>teaching is outstanding and wide-ranging<br>the fact that you teach into some of our<br>largest first year classes and then up<br>to and including very specialized 400<br>level classes shows and demonstrates<br>your your clear abilities and in looking<br>at your research performance you are<br>extremely successful and I should say a<br>very sought after collaborator and it's<br>collaborative efforts that lead to the<br>advances that I'm sure we'll hear about<br>tonight so on behalf of the University<br>of otago please accept our<br>congratulations for this well deserve<br>promotion a little bit delayed in you<br>giving your IPL I know and as I welcome<br>up Professor Mattis Smith please join me<br>in congratulating you with some Applause<br>thank you very much<br>my name is Lisa Madison Smith and I am<br>the acting dean of the school of<br>biomedical sciences and it is truly my<br>pleasure and honor to be here tonight to<br>finally well I actually get to be here<br>if we did it earlier I wouldn't have<br>been here in this role but uh to finally<br>recognize and acknowledge and celebrate<br>Alex mcclellan's<br>inaugural professorial lecture so a<br>little bit about Alex this is always a<br>bit of fun for me because you get to<br>throughout the lecture here interesting<br>backstories but to actually be able to<br>go through and look you know all in one<br>go at at the impressive<br>research and teaching record of of our<br>staff in the school and it you know Alex<br>is a as a stunning example of that and<br>it makes me extremely proud to be to be<br>kind of<br>at least temporarily leading the school<br>of biomedical Sciences so um Alex<br>received his BSC at Canterbury in 1989<br>and went on to do an MSC at Canterbury<br>which he finished in 1992<br>and then took a few years but you know<br>eventually came to the University of<br>otago and was awarded his PhD in 1998.<br>he then went off to do a postdoc in<br>Germany in the department of Dermatology<br>at the University of Wurzburg in in<br>Germany<br>and then decided to make his way back to<br>New Zealand pleased to say<br>and initially taking up a role as a<br>scientific officer in the hematology and<br>Immunology research group at<br>Christchurch School of Medicine<br>and in<br>2003 we're glad to say that he came here<br>to the University of otago here in<br>Dunedin as a lecturer in 2006 was<br>appointed to senior lecturer<br>2011 to associate professor and in 2019<br>two professors so you're wearing it well<br>and it's really lovely to finally fourth<br>time lucky get to actually have you<br>presenting your inaugural professorial<br>lecture so um as we will hear Alex's<br>General background is in Immunology cell<br>cell biology and diagnostic developments<br>um and um he has been working uh since<br>2021 doing some consultancy work for S<br>uh VB lyrink and new biotechnologies and<br>has five IP declarations made with oil<br>here at the University so recognizing<br>that<br>um<br>that additional side of of his teaching<br>and research he has over 76<br>peer-reviewed Publications to date<br>and a very impressive in very impressive<br>International<br>peer-reviewed journals he's brought in<br>significant research funding from<br>external bodies multiple grants from the<br>HRC<br>from Marsden grants from Lottery health<br>and Cancer Society and most recently<br>he's leading an HRC project Grant of<br>over a million dollars looking at dual<br>safety system to promote car T Cell<br>Activation and migration<br>as we've heard Alex teaches it at all<br>levels<br>um in in the school and across the<br>university and our huge stage one papers<br>and all the way through to 400 level<br>he uh has supervised to completion 13<br>PhD students six msdc students and over<br>20 honors students and and many many<br>more<br>um<br>dip size and and summer students have<br>have worked in his labs<br>he has in the department been an<br>outstanding<br>colleague and taking on service roles as<br>the doctoral convener since<br>2018. he's chaired the teaching<br>committee he's been the overall 400<br>level convener and and recently<br>co-convener as well as the MSC convener<br>these are jobs that take a huge amount<br>of time and commitment and are really<br>incredibly important for supporting our<br>postgraduate students but there are<br>often jobs you have a hard time finding<br>people to take on because they are a<br>pretty intensive<br>role helping our students get through<br>all of the hurdles and so forth that we<br>have to have to jump he's also<br>demonstrated a long-term commitment and<br>Leadership with the animal Ethics<br>Committee again an incredibly important<br>committee for the school<br>and in leadership in teaching and<br>research has driven the purchase of some<br>significant major equipment including<br>the first in Vivo bio imager to assist<br>with cancer studies here at the<br>University of otago<br>so as we'll hear tonight I expect and<br>I'm certainly looking forward to it uh<br>Alex's background generally broadly is<br>in cancer research<br>and when he took up his position here at<br>otago he continued to work in antigen<br>presentation and cancer but then<br>stumbled upon<br>requesting to hear and clarified the<br>role of cancer cells in activating the<br>coagulation Cascade in 2015 he<br>reinvigorated his research Direction<br>into molecular biology to allow transfer<br>of anti-cancer genes into T cells using<br>retroviral and transposon techniques and<br>now produces recombinant proteins<br>including therapeutic antibodies<br>has research on genetic sequences<br>enabled a new platform to improve the<br>ability of mRNA vaccines for T cell<br>receptors and I think we all certainly<br>appreciate the significance of that<br>these days so<br>um sit back it sounds like we are indeed<br>uh in for a bit of a ride to hear about<br>passengers and blood and skin natural<br>and engineered immune cells so join me<br>in welcoming Professor Alex McFarland to<br>his IPL<br>curacoto<br>I'm Alex McClellan I was promoted to<br>Professor in 2019 and as you heard I had<br>three cancellations so I'm very pleased<br>to be here and to see everyone<br>uh<br>I'd like to thank Professor Blakey and<br>Madison Smith for the very warm<br>heartfelt introduction<br>and for organizing helping organize the<br>academic party<br>and I'm sure we heard from Greg and<br>Patricia priest later<br>so the title of the talk is passengers<br>in blood and skin and some of these<br>cells will be important ancient<br>presenting cells that uh<br>involved in the anti-cancer response and<br>also have important roles with combating<br>infection<br>they're called passengers and my talk<br>because they move around the body and it<br>also alludes to the fact that you can<br>take some of the cells out and engineer<br>them and put them back into patients and<br>these are the this is the car T Cell<br>Revolution<br>uh I'd like to start by acknowledging my<br>mother and father so this is Aleister<br>at home in a Physics laboratory in<br>Canterbury<br>he met my mother Pam<br>in about 1947 on a cycling trip when he<br>was finishing his PhD in Edinburgh<br>and they came back to New Zealand and<br>began to raise a smallish family this is<br>them before they started raising the<br>family enjoying<br>um some of the outdoors particularly the<br>West Coast a lovely photo of uh of Pam<br>and Alistair and the Affinity of the<br>West Coast stimulated them to buy a<br>batch in Carter's beach near near<br>Westport where I spent a lot of my time<br>and this is me being incubated at the<br>moment my brother Middle Brother Daniel<br>there and eldest brother John there and<br>those wonderful arm chairs that I<br>remember so well and the many<br>Carly and so forth cooked upon the stove<br>so very happy memories of that batch<br>which sadly was sold but yeah<br>that's how life turns out<br>schooling never great at sport I'm<br>probably better at sport now with the<br>biking than I was back then but this is<br>you know a test of endurance for every<br>school kid is to back then was to do the<br>sack race and that's the case you didn't<br>recognize that's me<br>coming last probably didn't see the<br>point of this activity<br>uh well what I was more interested in<br>this is me<br>um Cape foul and I believe in the west<br>coast one of those one of the wonderful<br>holidays photo probably taken by my<br>father on slide film<br>uh what I was really interested in was<br>the biological world<br>I was lucky enough to have a microscope<br>I think that was released from the<br>University it no longer required it was<br>perfect for observing paramecium and<br>Hydra and rotifers and the battle going<br>on<br>um in this in the pond life if you like<br>so<br>I'd go down with jars to tributaries of<br>the Avon River<br>and collect samples and and spend hours<br>watching those and even my my very<br>sporty friend from next door was quite<br>interested in it and brought it up just<br>the other day<br>and another patient was insects of all<br>kinds and this Richard Sherelle book<br>I've still got it was really stimulated<br>my interest in invertebrates<br>and my father would bring home recycled<br>notebooks these were from students that<br>had dropped out so legs didn't quite<br>make it through the physics program but<br>provided me with one book which I still<br>have so I would note the hatching of<br>butterflies such as red Admirals and in<br>great detail using powers of<br>of observational science only<br>um<br>so what I was a what I wasn't aware of<br>um although I wanted to be a scientist<br>was the the problems of of science it's<br>it's cutthroat<br>uh you need a high tolerance for failure<br>and you might not all get all the data<br>you require and when you do you might<br>have to break it up to get it published<br>into different aspects and then in the<br>end someone someone steals it so if you<br>like dogs you might enjoy the this video<br>where it's a bit of role play about what<br>foreign<br>you see the look of disappointment as<br>sprocket's been scoped clearly the<br>data's been stolen someone else else had<br>been watching and had already had the<br>same idea and had done it far cheap<br>cheaper<br>uh so uh becoming a real scientist<br>um after completing a bachelor degree<br>was enabled by Chris mahanty who took me<br>into his lab for a master's degree<br>Chris had a really special lab he had an<br>autoclave Insider's lab and this was<br>after the<br>um at math back then had had enforced<br>more regulations about bio control and<br>so forth so Chris was an expert and was<br>Harvard Harvard trained<br>in the genetics of of of many types of<br>different bacteria and had many<br>different interests in radiation damage<br>of eukaryotes and so forth he's very<br>interesting man he lives in fact I've<br>been in corresponse with them recently<br>to get the photo and is happily retired<br>over in Sydney<br>uh Chris noted very early on when I was<br>a master student that I was a terrible<br>public speaker I was a bag of nerves<br>and doing what you should do as a<br>supervisor you know strict supervisor<br>you organize a talk for the Royal<br>Society which is more people than are<br>here tonight but it did cure me somewhat<br>but I think the I found the small<br>tutorials more intimidating than larger<br>audiences let's hope that continues but<br>always remember if I get intimidated I<br>always remember Chris<br>uh at the back of the room nodding<br>furiously and enthusiastic<br>way to try and encourage me so thanks<br>for that Chris so that was completed<br>um I think I didn't muck around much<br>before I was looking for a PhD and lying<br>around Chris's office with lots of<br>nature journals and then when you open<br>the nature journal multi-disciplinary<br>and I turned to the Immunology pages and<br>think well that's probably an area I do<br>want to get into and this job just came<br>up out of the blue it was a junior<br>research fellow very poorly paid in<br>those days of course<br>but it was um<br>a position offered by by Derek Hart who<br>was provided some of the first<br>descriptions when he was an Oxford of<br>what causes the transplant reaction and<br>it was known that there were these major<br>histocompatibility molecules but it<br>wasn't really known what cells they were<br>on that were inducing The graft<br>rejection and Derek made an unusual<br>discovery that antibodies against MHC<br>surprisingly prolonged The graft in the<br>recipient so it was a contrary<br>observation and led to the<br>discovery of all type of white blood<br>cell it's called passenger because it<br>comes in with the graph so it's when you<br>when you put a graph into a recipient<br>the white blood cells come into and the<br>dendritic cells are the ones<br>that have these MHC molecules on that<br>stimulate the graft rejection which is a<br>bad thing you need immunosuppressants<br>and you need to try and match the<br>genetics of the MHC as closely as<br>possible<br>so dendritic cells right at the start of<br>the immune response so if you think of<br>vaccines and pathogens coming in this is<br>probably the heaviest science we're<br>going to get into tonight<br>dendritic cells handle all those and we<br>call those particles antigens and those<br>particles of antigen which<br>usually we think of from vaccines or<br>invading pathogens come into the<br>dendritic cell and the dendritic cell<br>will stimulate some arms of the immune<br>response because white blood cells are<br>numerous in the type in their subset<br>types they'll do different jobs in the<br>immune system and of course you get the<br>wonderful output there of antibodies<br>these are called cytotoxic t cells and<br>they will kill virus infected cells so<br>we obviously rely on them if we've got<br>something like covert infection<br>or influenza but they also have a role<br>in killing cancer cells and this occurs<br>naturally during our lifetimes many<br>times over saves these cells save our<br>lives without us even being aware that<br>some of these cells have killed some<br>developing clusters of of cancer cells<br>they'll also kill transplanted cells and<br>all the T cells participate in an<br>inflammatory role against against the<br>transplant so the dendritic cell is a<br>critical cell cell for that and I've<br>tried to represent the factors Laden<br>with different types of MHC it really is<br>one of the richest cells in terms of MHC<br>content<br>uh<br>Derek made those discoveries using using<br>kidneys and but was interested in the<br>dendritic cell that was found throughout<br>throughout the body and I was looking at<br>blood dendritic cells but I also asked<br>Derek I think it was my idea at least<br>could I study the skin dendritic cell<br>and this was not a very well developed<br>technique there were papers available<br>which were very vague usually from<br>France and gave no clue how you would<br>isolate these tissue dendritic cells and<br>there was a frustrating<br>almost a year I think of complete<br>frustration being unable to isolate the<br>dendritic cells we needed for the study<br>but I I I quickly uh after after those<br>frustrations I asked Derek just please<br>get me a skin grafting knife<br>um why would a PhD student want a skin<br>grafting knife it sounds dangerous but<br>it was really to make paper thin<br>preparations of skin so they can be<br>easily digested and that's absolute key<br>for doing that but when you get a large<br>piece of skin from the plastic surgeon<br>it's very difficult to work with so you<br>need something called i i invented it<br>for myself called The Skin roller that's<br>the mark one and the Mark II as I<br>convinced the medical engineers to get<br>one that will actually roll around<br>comfortably so I can get the the silver<br>skin grafting knife which conveniently<br>takes razor blades and you'll need<br>several razor blades for each<br>preparation of skin because Skin's<br>really tough so you'd blunt it but<br>anyway this this appeared to work and<br>out pop these these beautiful dendritic<br>cells I was very very pleased when I<br>started getting the the technique<br>working and this slide was was part of<br>my thesis and it was published in<br>general investigative gate of<br>Dermatology<br>and it shows um a population of<br>dendritic cells and that they love<br>eating stuff they love eating microbes<br>they eat whatever's turning over in the<br>skin in this case some melanocytes have<br>had their day<br>um or they're eating up some pigment<br>granules they just found lying around so<br>you'll find them full of unusual things<br>they're just lying around in the skin<br>and these are probably T cells the<br>dendritic cells talk talk to T cells so<br>that was step one if you like<br>but an important step was being able to<br>isolate skin skin dendritic cells and<br>sufficient numbers to be able to ask<br>at the same time I was looking at tissue<br>labeling techniques and<br>immunohistochemistry was a fairly<br>Advanced technique at the time this was<br>a long time ago now we've got<br>fluorescence but the advantage of<br>immunohistochemistry is you can see the<br>the dyes get into the skin as almost<br>like a dust getting into the textures<br>and you can see quite a lot of structure<br>with those so I use this quite<br>extensively and really uncovered the<br>fact that<br>skin appendages follicles sweat glands<br>have these pockets of what we think are<br>protective dendritic cells which are in<br>red here talking to T cells so they're<br>sitting around the follicles which are<br>the potential weak points the skin where<br>the the nasties could get in here you<br>have pockets of activated dendritic<br>cells I was able to stain them with<br>these newly identified antibodies around<br>the time and see that they were talking<br>talking to T cells it looked like they<br>were talking to the T cells so the skin<br>appendages have these rich populations<br>of dermal DC and T cells and that was a<br>new finding at the time<br>up here in the epidermis<br>not so surprising this is a skin sheet<br>are prepared you can see the dendritic<br>cells in red and there's lots of them<br>they cover quite a large surface area so<br>your skin you probably thought just<br>structural cells is very very enriched<br>in certain types of white blood cells<br>and these are the passenger leukocytes<br>having made some nice preparations of<br>dendritic cells my task given to me by<br>my supervisor was to use all the<br>currently available reagents do a lot of<br>antibodies flooding into Lab at that<br>time from from around the world because<br>we were part of an antibody testing<br>Workshop community<br>and the task was really to learn how<br>dendritic cells switch on T cells<br>and and this is a dendritic cell here<br>talking to multiple T cells quite a<br>promiscuous interaction there lots of T<br>cells get together with one one<br>dendritic cell they exchange information<br>and then the outcome is the T cells get<br>activated go off and divide<br>and do all the wonderful things in the<br>immune system they need to do killing<br>virus cells or cancer cells Etc<br>so this um figure shows that there's a<br>few tentacles that that sort of match<br>between the T cell and the dendritic<br>cell they're like receptor ligands like<br>like Keys fitting into locks and they<br>have to be engaged for this process to<br>work if you're missing one or two of<br>those the immune system stops working so<br>obviously now they're useful for<br>blocking reagents to encourage<br>transplants to stay in bodies or you can<br>enhance some of those<br>mechanisms by by blocking them with some<br>of the therapeutic drugs we've got<br>around now to enhance responses to<br>cancer cells so at the time identifying<br>what these molecules were doing was<br>quite an important task<br>and the<br>PhD was a productive time we we had a<br>lot of blood coming in from the Red<br>Cross and we were able to work from 5 30<br>each night processing the blood the next<br>day we'd have the blood pick it up on<br>the ice and continue on<br>um we worked pretty hard we had we had<br>good post-docs in the lab and I'm really<br>grateful for my time time there and a<br>number of these Publications<br>explain some of those receptor ligand<br>interactions and they also show that<br>some of them aren't there at the start<br>they are induced on the dendritic cell<br>during the interaction with T Cell<br>previously it was thought that those<br>molecules were always on dendritic cells<br>when they lived in your body and then we<br>showed that that wasn't necessarily the<br>case<br>so several of these molecules and their<br>importance were identified in the PHD<br>studies<br>and they some of these molecules are<br>obviously clinically relevant and you<br>can<br>generate a monoclonal against for<br>example cto4 and enhance the immune<br>when I was in the throes of completing a<br>PhD so this was about 1997 I would have<br>handed and I think towards the end of 97<br>I got a talk in Venice which was a big<br>big thing for me I remember being<br>extremely nervous about it like I am<br>tonight<br>the final night I believe it was a final<br>night it was a wonderful dinner at hotel<br>Japan where Death in Venice was filmed<br>is it from Russian back looking a bit<br>Shifty there is he's sitting in the in<br>the lobby<br>um but it was in this hotel at uh after<br>after dinner over a few drinks that I<br>make this wonderful person is<br>who became my postdoctoral supervisor so<br>this is<br>we soon know he was called fondly by<br>everyone he was a dermatologist he'd<br>pioneered isolation of tissue dendritic<br>cells I remember meeting him for the<br>first time thinking I was meeting a rock<br>star he really was a an amazing producer<br>of Journal of experimental medicine<br>papers on the topic of skin dendritic<br>cells so I was very pleased to lend a<br>postdoc with him<br>and we've traveled quite a lot there are<br>a lot of conferences at the time so<br>these This Is Us enjoying enjoying some<br>wine in Austria<br>and another thing about würzburg it's a<br>nice very nice city to live in if you're<br>thinking about<br>um going over there it's good good<br>science good physics good good biology<br>and we spent quite a lot of time there<br>my wife and I were alone for a time and<br>then Harry was born on New Year's Day<br>and uh and that was about the the in the<br>year that we left Wurzburg so we we<br>produced a German baby he's not quite<br>German because he's got New Zealand<br>parents but um<br>it was also productive in that regard<br>so some of the<br>some of the work was really looking at<br>dendritic cells and we described subsets<br>of dendritic cells clarified their<br>function these are just some photographs<br>of different subsets of dendritic cells<br>confusingly they've got seat they've got<br>names like CD4 and cd8 which you might<br>associate with T cells if you knew about<br>immunology and that just goes to show<br>how confusing Immunology is but<br>dendritic cells also have some of these<br>markers on this surface there was a<br>little bit of confusion about their<br>functions and I believe we we clarified<br>some of that with some of the<br>Publications showing that those<br>functions have have different different<br>responses in stimulating T cells and<br>they were not all what people had<br>previously proposed they would be so<br>again a productive time just being able<br>to sit in a lab and not not be too<br>bothered with admin and teaching and all<br>the other things that happen in the<br>University when you grow up but just<br>just again working hard with good<br>support from from icky and and the<br>technical staff<br>so these Publications were really<br>involved with dendritic cell subsets<br>dendritic cell death because dendritic<br>cells have a lifespan they're they're<br>primary cells so they don't last forever<br>and it was looking at new ways that they<br>could they could die<br>so the main findings were the subsets of<br>dendrick cells have different capacity<br>to stimulate different T cells so that<br>was an important finding and the study<br>ruled out some previously proposed<br>mechanisms for for those differences<br>and then finally dendritic cells die<br>they have a limited lifespan when<br>they're dead they can no longer<br>stimulate T cells so the immune system<br>Falls over and that I believe is one of<br>the reasons that vaccination against<br>cancer is is troublesome it doesn't<br>always work and there are other ways to<br>to treat cancer with immunotherapy that<br>might be more more fruitful but<br>certainly pulsing dendritic cells with<br>tumor engine expecting them to give a<br>good T Cell response doesn't always<br>so<br>um after a period as a scientific<br>officer which<br>Lisa medicine Smith alluded to I was<br>lucky enough to land a job as a lecturer<br>in the department of microbiology and<br>Immunology and this is me on the seventh<br>floor lab which now is run by Matlab<br>Hussein<br>and uh this is before it was<br>commissioned obviously because we're not<br>wearing lab coats but there's a young<br>Harry there getting a bird's eye view<br>probably of some tumor cells not Pond<br>life I'd imagine at the time and my wife<br>Lawrence Fernley there this is dating me<br>isn't it<br>a wonderful view in that office<br>uh sadly had to go down to the fourth<br>floor<br>um<br>my parents Pam and Alistair the so a<br>little bit older there very pleased to<br>see us back as was Sputnik the dog now<br>deceased this is a little bit<br>um<br>further down the track because Harry's a<br>little bit older there but that's as in<br>Christchurch<br>photo taken by my wonderful<br>and returning to otago it's always<br>difficult when you come back from a<br>postdoc what do you work on do you just<br>carry the old baggage from your postdoc<br>and being being on that till you you<br>know you can no longer get grant funding<br>or would you try something new so I did<br>a little bit of both this was something<br>new<br>so when you have cells and they're<br>growing in the lab you throw away the<br>culture fluid when you harvest them but<br>that culture fluid's got some really<br>interesting things in it that we started<br>to pay attention to<br>vesicles which are lipid or<br>membrane-bound entities are shared from<br>cells<br>molecules can be proteolytically cleaved<br>off the surface of cells there's<br>interesting stuff in there and for some<br>potential biomarkers<br>so this was looking not at cell culture<br>but looking at in the urine or PE<br>and it was an idea I had when I saw that<br>we could isolate and work with soluble<br>forms of MHC called hladr<br>and it this is a paper just<br>demonstrating its potential biomarker<br>for acute renal transplant rejection<br>it's Shed from the kidneys during the<br>rejection episodes<br>so when the inflammation from the<br>rejection episode<br>is felt by the other cells in that area<br>they release soluble forms of this MHC<br>molecule so that turned out to be quite<br>a good test with good sensitivity and<br>specificity which means you can<br>you can have a sensitive test but not<br>get it wrong too much like detect false<br>alarms if you like from from those sort<br>of tests<br>and we were also<br>at the time working with with cancer and<br>I kept also my love of of dendritic<br>cells so we're plugging away on those at<br>the same time but<br>when you look at a cancer cell this is a<br>shot from Amy Dunn who's a technician in<br>the laboratory<br>you see cells but what you don't see are<br>the things Shed from it and there are<br>tiny vesicles Shed from the surface of<br>of tumor cells there are Vehicles Shed<br>from inside the tumor cell by a process<br>of exocytosis those are those are called<br>exosomes<br>and most people just just Chuck those<br>things away but they are an interesting<br>entity that we sort of stumble Acron<br>upon because we were looking at those<br>vesicles because they've been reported<br>to be<br>represent of the tumor cell surface and<br>enriched in tumor antigens that could be<br>used as a therapeutic vaccine<br>so these are these are tiny vesicles<br>released from the surface and and<br>sometimes released from inside the the<br>endosome which was something popping out<br>by exocytosis there's a number of<br>different subtypes of vesicles which we<br>don't need to know too much about but<br>Remy had a look at the the structure of<br>these<br>and this is a typical sucrose gradient<br>that we use to isolate them we can get<br>them very pure and we thought well we'll<br>use these as a as a vaccine at least and<br>have a play around with them but to our<br>horror as soon as they touch blood there<br>was this massive coagulation response of<br>fibrin and a later thrombin burst was<br>produced so basically you end up with a<br>clot at the bottom of a tube<br>um you're unable to work with them in<br>blood which means they're not going to<br>be a useful vaccine so<br>we um we're not too discouraged because<br>we saw an opportunity here to to Really<br>determine why were these so bad at<br>clotting blood because blood blood<br>clotting is bad it occurs at a higher<br>rate in cancer patients so<br>VTE or pulmonary embolism are some<br>outcomes unfortunate outcomes of having<br>particularly solid cancers<br>and part of that pathology could be<br>related to the fact that these there are<br>these very very Pro coagulant vesicles<br>are produced by by the tumor cells<br>so I asked Remy to have a closer look at<br>that so the Remy was a PhD student at<br>the time then he was a postdoc with me<br>and now he's a postdoc with Bruce<br>Russell doing crypto sporidium<br>so Remy had a look at the vesicles in<br>detail<br>and I I was aware from the literature<br>that there were some reports of various<br>coagulation factors being associated<br>with them but pretty much every study<br>had taken one coagulation factor and<br>said Factor 10 is involved or factor<br>seven is involved and I asked Remy to<br>look at all of them so he gained an<br>exceptional thesis from that but we<br>worked him to the Bone and he did work<br>out the the pathological coagulation<br>occurring at this vesicle surface is<br>naturally due to these exposed lipid<br>residues called phosphatidal serine<br>which encourage coagulation factors to<br>bind<br>but it was really just this uh<br>sniff of tissue factor it's a tiny<br>amount of tissue factor which is a very<br>very powerful coagulant molecule present<br>in your sub endothelium it's normally<br>kept away from the from the blood that<br>was the molecule responsible for this<br>pathological coagulation occurring by<br>the vesicles<br>you could add<br>a large amount of cells to a tube it<br>looked like pea soup and so intact<br>intact cells you wouldn't get the same<br>response from just adding a touch a<br>little sniff of those vesicles so it was<br>like snake venom you might have seen<br>videos of snake venom coagulating blood<br>it really was the same sort of<br>phenomenon of very very rapid and<br>Powerful coagulation response from those<br>vesicles so tumor vesicles are not going<br>to be a good vaccine from solid tumors<br>juice just used without any<br>neutralization of those coagulation<br>factors<br>around about the same time Sarah<br>saunderson uh was working on a PhD she'd<br>finished a bachelor of biomedical<br>science in the lab and published a paper<br>from that work in General Immunology<br>she was looking at the exosomes which<br>are vesicles released from from living<br>cells<br>and looked at the pattern that they<br>Bound in lymph node and spleen and the<br>vesicles in red and she identified an<br>uptake pathway for those vesicles so the<br>vesicles that Remy was working with and<br>Sarah was working with Sarah uncovered<br>what they do when they get into the body<br>they actually captured very efficiently<br>by the reticular endothelium system as<br>we might might call it which is this<br>network of macrophages present in lymph<br>node and spleen and what this shows is<br>that the the vesicles don't last very<br>long in circulation so you should<br>probably be skeptical about reports of<br>vehicles circulating for long periods of<br>time in Long Long covert I certainly am<br>because of this rapid clearance there<br>right down to the limit of detections<br>half-life of two minutes so what are<br>they doing in in Vivo we never quite<br>uncovered that<br>Sarah did a lot of work um on on their<br>function how they are induced and showed<br>a very important finding that<br>exosomes which are vesicles released<br>from living cells<br>are only induced if you stimulate the<br>cells if you stimulate primary cells or<br>if you turn them malignant with a virus<br>like Epstein-Barr virus and I think the<br>world still ignores some of that advice<br>from from those Publications<br>another aspect there was looking at the<br>how the immune system is activated by by<br>so<br>um<br>another aspect that we have been working<br>on for some time is that T cells are<br>white blood cells that can kill cancer<br>cells and and T cells are stimulated<br>usually in in physiologic situations by<br>by dendritic cells<br>and T cells during our lifetime like<br>other cells called natural killer cells<br>will kill off cancer cells so we didn't<br>we wouldn't even know that we had cancer<br>they'll kill off small clusters of<br>cancer cells or individual cancer cells<br>as they arrive arise and persons on<br>immunosuppressants have to particularly<br>kidney transplant<br>recipient receipt have a higher rate of<br>skin cancers so knocking these cells<br>down the cancers are pop up the<br>frequency of cancers pop up quite<br>markedly particularly skin Cancers and<br>and recipients of of grafts that need to<br>be suppressed with immunosuppressants so<br>T cells definitely important but they<br>don't always work<br>Persons get cancer people get cancer and<br>um<br>the T cells obviously haven't haven't<br>done their job<br>so there is a technique that's actually<br>surprisingly been around for 30 years<br>but it's only been in clinical trials<br>for about the last 15 and now there are<br>six FDA approved types of car T Cell<br>Therapy against b-cell malignancies<br>because B cells can also turn bad they<br>can form leukemias and lymphomas and car<br>T cells attack those tumors by a<br>mechanism different to chemotherapy or<br>radiation they utilize the immune system<br>and they can be effective against<br>relapse disease or disease that is<br>unable to be treated by conventional<br>therapy<br>so car T cells are just normal T cells<br>but they've been engineered with a<br>retrovirus to have a single polypeptide<br>or protein expressed and that's the car<br>and the car will bind to surface<br>antigens on the cancer cell<br>it's genetically spliced back here to<br>signaling Machinery so it just it's like<br>a light switch just turning on that T<br>cell that something is wrong<br>there are many of those<br>domains that I studied in my PhD just<br>the cytoplasmic domains have been popped<br>in here to enable T cell signaling so<br>just triggering of this<br>antibody molecule here triggers T-cell<br>activation and and will kill the cancers<br>those those are car T cells and they're<br>very effective against b-cell<br>malignancies<br>we've been interested in taking the car<br>T Cell using it against the more<br>difficult to treat solid tumors<br>and one of the problems with working<br>with car T cells is if you look in the<br>physiologic T Cell expansion what<br>happens all the time in your body is<br>when you get infection T cells will will<br>divide and form these uh these<br>effective cells which are like the<br>weapons of the immune system<br>but with car T cells a bit more<br>complicated there's a few potential<br>roadblocks along the way you have to<br>take the T cells out of the patient grow<br>them up<br>put the car cassette into them using a<br>retrovirus and inject them back into a<br>patient that may not be feeling<br>particularly well and has certainly had<br>some conditioning therapy of<br>chemotherapy so if these cells fall over<br>if they don't divide if they don't<br>persist in the patient the cancer will<br>come back<br>so it's really important to work out<br>ways to encourage the car T cells to<br>persist within the body and that's what<br>we're looking at ways to modify the car<br>T cells to get the best car T Cell<br>product and there's a little bit of room<br>in the car T Cell cassette to put some<br>extra bits and pieces and usually that's<br>one extra Gene which will increase the<br>activity of of the car T cell<br>so helping us in a large way was the<br>arrival of a<br>a student from Iran uh from who'd been<br>working at Tehran stem cell Institute<br>was already skilled in stem cells<br>retrovirus technology molecular biology<br>wow what a PhD student to get in uh it's<br>like they've already done their PHD so<br>Ali contributed a major way to finding<br>out ways to get those car T cells to<br>persist and and not die and stay hang<br>around for long periods of time so they<br>might be able to treat the tumor<br>so in a short period of time it's going<br>to highlight Ali's contribution to our<br>program these are the papers he's his<br>co-authoron he worked on New systems to<br>produce extra genes for the car T cells<br>these promoters which<br>segments of DNA that switch on the<br>transcription of of genes so if you want<br>to produce something in a car to sell<br>this extra protein you need a good<br>promoter<br>so Ellie developed a number of these<br>promoter systems he compared existing<br>promoter systems and uh and had a very<br>very productive time in the lab looking<br>at those aspects<br>and one of one of the aspects<br>um we were looking at with Ali was<br>inducible systems if you want to switch<br>on an extra Gene for a car T Cell<br>probably it's better not to switch it on<br>all the time<br>you might exhaust the cell you might end<br>up with a dangerous situation where the<br>car T Cell itself becomes malignant<br>becomes part of the problem becomes a<br>tumor cell<br>so an idea there is to have the the gene<br>controlled by a promoter that will only<br>respond to drugs<br>or better still can be auto-induced<br>so this is showing a tumor<br>and the these T cells have been switched<br>on a gene and the T cell has been<br>switched on simultaneously by<br>administering a drug but as you can see<br>all of the T cells have been switched on<br>even those outside the tumor environment<br>so a far more attractive system that<br>we're working on are these Auto induced<br>sales their car T cells they only switch<br>on the genes when they're in contact<br>with tumor cell products<br>this means that you don't get other car<br>T cells that are circulating around the<br>body pulling in the spleen for example<br>they don't become activated they don't<br>contribute to inflammation there's a<br>less of a risk of malignancy from from<br>another aspect we've investigated also<br>together with Ali<br>these bi-directional promoters for car T<br>Cell Therapy<br>so promoters will<br>stimulate the transcription of of genes<br>but a lot of the promoters that we're<br>used to studying in molecular biology<br>Labs if you put a gene backwards on the<br>other strand you'll also get reeds<br>so you get very very efficient gene<br>expression from some of those standard<br>Gene promoters that people are using and<br>that's great because you can get two<br>cars produced with just a minimal amount<br>of DNA going into a retrovirus so you<br>still got a workable system for<br>transducing T cells<br>so this is an example of what we're<br>working on and at the moment it's a car<br>that has a double hit for a tumor cell<br>this tumor cell here has lost expression<br>through mutation of one of those<br>important antigens that normally car T<br>cells would be a hundred percent reliant<br>on recognizing it will be a tumor Escape<br>variant it will grow and form a new<br>malignancy and cause relapse<br>so the loss of this is no big issue if<br>you've got a second car that can<br>recognize a second engine and for both<br>of those antigens to be mutated on the<br>tumor cells much less likely events so<br>those promoter systems are really<br>important aspects of our current<br>investigations<br>and some of the papers published by by<br>Ali during his PhD look at the<br>bi-directionality of of those promoters<br>to get a nice little compact system for<br>I promise to talk about engineered<br>immune cells as well as natural cells so<br>this really is an overly engineered cell<br>this is a would make a dendritic cell<br>Green With Envy so this is an artificial<br>engine presenting cell so artificial<br>engine presenting cells become useful<br>when you can put in multiple stimulated<br>molecules those ligands that I was<br>looking at my PhD you can put them in as<br>a single Gene one after the other and<br>Sarah Sorensen's done a wonderful job of<br>making these artificial antigen<br>presenting cells that we've got in the<br>lab and they have<br>a high expression of individual<br>molecules designed to stimulate T cells<br>or natural killer cells and so you can<br>use them for expanding cells before you<br>put them back into a patient so it's a<br>real issue with some cells in particular<br>car in K cells are very very difficult<br>to expand<br>artificial engine presenting cells<br>can be used to expand those cells from<br>from blood and this is an experiment<br>performed by by Lockheed Dobson<br>using those artificial energy presenting<br>cells you get massive<br>expansion of of cells enough to carry<br>out therapy width if you don't get<br>expansion you can't carry out therapy<br>and mostly the car T Cell World operates<br>in production by stopping the production<br>at the time you get enough to treat 70<br>so uh<br>I'd like to thank the lab as it's<br>evolved over the years this is an older<br>photo we're a little bit more depleted<br>in numbers now<br>locky's just been added this morning<br>he's got a PhD scholarship it's<br>wonderful news this morning<br>and uh so it wouldn't have been possible<br>without the contribution of of the lab<br>workers<br>the department and The Wider University<br>provided me with a lot of support and<br>encouragement and within the department<br>over the years the support staff<br>particularly on the third floor which is<br>the what we call a class prep area and<br>the eight floor which is more the admin<br>area have really really helped helped me<br>along and like to thank<br>particularly some of the lab managers<br>and compliance and simply just keeping<br>things going Bruce Todd Alan Clark and<br>now Alan Hughes as technical managers<br>Bruce set me up and then a little bit<br>later Alan Alan kept me going so this is<br>when anything breaks in the lab it's<br>fixed almost immediately or there's<br>something happening to make you feel a<br>little bit better about those next set<br>of experiments you've got to do so<br>thanks to those people<br>and particularly also the other members<br>long-term staff so it's difficult to<br>know who to think thank but I've talked<br>about some people tonight Sarah Sorensen<br>Amy Dunn Ali hossini read Remy mozen<br>Lydia white and Josh Joshua Halpin who's<br>just starting out on the HRC grant that<br>we've got<br>the Immunology team<br>these are people that have been within<br>the microbiology Department contributing<br>to Immunology teaching Immunology<br>research they've helped with curriculum<br>development they've helped me develop my<br>teaching portfolios and they've been<br>important<br>supervisors and advisors for our<br>postgraduate students and many thanks to<br>to the Immunology teaching Team Heads of<br>Department throughout the years you can<br>tell I've been here a long time Sandy<br>Smith hired me Greg Cooke continues to<br>employ me<br>at the stage<br>and my mentor is Chris mahanty for the<br>Masters giving me the little bump I<br>needed for public speaking Derek Hart<br>together with the post-docs Barry Hawk<br>and Gary Stein PhD Eckhart camp and one<br>more point I want to raise a bit icky he<br>drove Lawrence to the hospital in the<br>middle of the night when the taxis<br>couldn't get the hell because it was<br>snowing so put chains on his Mercedes<br>and drove Lawrence to hospital so Harry<br>would would arrive on time and not at<br>home<br>and family incredibly important to me<br>and this is just the the close family<br>Pam and else my parents Harry<br>Lawrence Sputnik now deceased sprocket<br>and bet that the dogs you saw in in the<br>video thank you very much to you for<br>your support over the years<br>and I think that concludes the lecture<br>um thank you Alex for an absolutely<br>amazing IPL<br>must have been hard<br>waiting the three years to deliver this<br>and having all those cancellations but I<br>can tell you right now it was really<br>worth it tonight and and you covered<br>everything that we'd like to see in an<br>IPL<br>I still remember meeting you on the<br>eighth floor back there in 2003 as you<br>contemplated coming to Dunedin and<br>obviously we're extremely grateful that<br>you did come<br>our initial conversations were all<br>one-way traffic I didn't know much about<br>immunology and Alex and I became running<br>buddies and so most of the runs were<br>about Immunology so I had to really um<br>try and brush up on that otherwise that<br>the runs were pretty silent<br>um your talk tonight reminded me again<br>of your enthusiasm for this subject<br>over the years you've also shown me that<br>you're actually a pretty good<br>bacteriologist and obviously training<br>with Chris mahanty who's produced some<br>of the best microbiologists this<br>country's ever seen so<br>um you could have gone down either road<br>so and just really shows your your great<br>interest in science<br>um tonight Alex has really outlined his<br>seminal work in developing microscopic<br>and cytometric techniques for<br>visualizing immune cells and human<br>tissues particularly his favorite cell<br>the gingeric cell and skin and blood<br>um I hadn't realized how amazing your<br>PhD research was I mean the number of<br>Publications that came out of that work<br>is just incredible and really<br>shows to me you know the Endeavor<br>writing Publications I'm absolutely<br>certain that you drove those drafts and<br>and got them through I think that was<br>highlighted again in your postdoctoral<br>work in wurzberger once again huge<br>number of papers uncovering new aspects<br>on the distribution and function of<br>dendritic cells interaction with T cells<br>um just every every post that you've<br>taken you've made it a winner<br>um<br>when you joined the Department in 2003<br>you continued to work on antigen<br>presentation and cancer and and<br>clarified the role of cancer cells and<br>active activating the coagulation<br>Cascade<br>um you've trained a huge number of<br>students you've had some amazing<br>post-docs and probably one of the most<br>pleasing things that's happened since<br>I've known you which is over 20 years<br>was when you said to me in 2015 that you<br>were deciding that you were going to<br>take a different path and and that path<br>was to get into the molecular biology of<br>T cells car T cells and I remember on<br>that bike ride how enthusiastic you were<br>about that and I think you saw tonight<br>as soon as Alex segued into the car T<br>cells the the elevation of the lecture<br>and the enthusiasm went up a notch so so<br>you can imagine then we were no longer<br>Runners then because we were basically<br>broken from that so we became very good<br>biking buddies and quite often people<br>would see us heading off to Signal Hill<br>um and so yeah I remember that bike ride<br>when you were saying I'm going to get<br>into car T cells and I was extremely<br>excited and I've also been very<br>impressed with how quickly<br>um that you've dominated this field in<br>New Zealand and basically now you're<br>getting Global recognition through all<br>the papers that you're pumping out<br>obviously the bike rides are for that<br>became all about car T cells and alley<br>right so<br>um that was fantastic to share that with<br>you as soon as you turned your attention<br>to that field<br>um funding success was instant<br>um back-to-back HRC Explorer grants in<br>2017-19 uh followed quickly by Marsden<br>success and HRC project success so that<br>just shows you sometimes that you know<br>you know I would switch to a different<br>research area can be hugely beneficial I<br>thought it was an amazing opportunity<br>and you took it really well<br>as we saw Alex has produced lots of<br>outstanding PhD students and it's nice<br>to see their work highlighted and<br>celebrated tonight<br>um<br>throughout your talk none of none of<br>this should surprise you if you know<br>Alex really well he has a an incredibly<br>curious mind<br>that never lets them take a break he<br>spends just about every night weekends<br>working on problem solving paper writing<br>grant writing and that and that's not<br>because he has to it's actually because<br>he just loves this right he's just so<br>lucky to have a job and a passion that<br>he really enjoys<br>um he still finds time to do lab work<br>which I think is remarkable and in the<br>20 years I've known you the passion and<br>fire for your topic has never diminished<br>um Alex is no slouch has scopus H index<br>of 32 is pretty amazing in this area so<br>that just shows you the caliber of<br>research that he is not only is it a<br>fantastic researcher I know I'm covering<br>some ground that you cover Lisa but he's<br>also does a fantastic amount of teaching<br>and service and I just want to say a<br>couple of things here because I there's<br>a fewer young academics in the audience<br>and<br>um you know LX service has been<br>sustained and what I mean by sustained<br>is that he's been the MSC convener since<br>2012. he was our 400 level convener for<br>over 10 years he leads the way in the<br>department for course advising of<br>students so if you ever need to know<br>about the Rules of Engagement for<br>University students you have to talk to<br>Alex because he he knows it from a to z<br>um so I think the promotion committee<br>should look more carefully at the word<br>sustained<br>and when making these judgment calls<br>Alex should be their Exemplar right this<br>is really what sustained means long<br>periods of time done to a very high<br>level<br>uh the other important thing about Alex<br>I've only been his hod for three years<br>but he never turns down an opportunity<br>to contribute<br>uh we're very fortunate to have him as<br>an academic in our department and<br>University I enjoy the passion and<br>commitment he brings to every aspect of<br>academic life and he pushes us all to<br>keep our standards high so he's<br>constantly grinding at you to make sure<br>that you don't drop your standards so<br>thank you Alex I mean you really care<br>about what's going on lastly I just want<br>to thank Harry and Lawrence patch and<br>sprocket are not here tonight but it's<br>good to see them featuring so thank you<br>for sharing Alex with us I hope this<br>evening will be fitting A fitting<br>celebration to recognize what an amazing<br>academic Alex is uh congratulations Alex<br>thanks for your friendship thanks for<br>giving me lots of your old bike parts<br>and biking Adventures so long may that<br>continue and all the best for the future<br>there's still a long way to go so thank<br>you very much</p></main><footer style="margin-top: 2rem;
