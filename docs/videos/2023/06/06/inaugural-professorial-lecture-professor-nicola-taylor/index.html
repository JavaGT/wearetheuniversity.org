so um you set off on your journey<br>with good spirits hearing your mother<br>give her inaugural professorial lecture<br>um<br>my welcome to those visitors to the<br>University of otago from here

University of otago as<br>well welcome I bring with me uh<br>greetings from our active Vice<br>Chancellor Professor Helen Nicholson and<br>in fact also from our former progress<br>Chancellor from Humanities uh Tony<br>Valentine who are both disappointed that<br>for<br>technical reasons and administrative<br>reasons that they are not able to be<br>here but look they can join the online<br>audience or watch a year podcast at some<br>other time<br>so an IPL is a celebration of successful<br>promotion to our highest academic status<br>that of professor at the University of<br>otago we take that promotion very<br>seriously and assess against rigorous<br>International standards including the<br>use of international referees all of our<br>promotion candidates<br>to get promoted one must demonstrate not<br>only<br>outstanding performance of at the<br>expectation of internationally Benchmark<br>professors but also significant<br>leadership in areas of teaching research<br>and service<br>and in Nikki look we have those in<br>Spades and we're very very pleased to be<br>able to celebrate that you have we will<br>hear more about your career from um the<br>dean Shelley when she introduces you uh<br>and we'll get a vote of thanks from the<br>PVC and some remark from Anita but<br>um I would say as a physicist we think<br>that we like to make impact from our<br>research and we do but it's nothing like<br>the impact that you and colleagues from<br>the children's issue Center and the<br>faculty of law have made over not just<br>years but decades real commitment<br>to identifying important issues working<br>furiously on them with commitment and<br>making a difference you're the<br>embodiment that universities are places<br>for the creation of new knowledge<br>through research the dissemination<br>through teaching and into practice and<br>policy and we congratulate you and your<br>colleagues for that really important<br>work that you've LED so I will now<br>invite Professor Shelley Griffiths to<br>introduce you but in doing so can you<br>please accept the hearty congratulations<br>on behalf of the university for your<br>most well-deserved promotion thank you<br>foreign<br>I'm currently the dean of the faculty of<br>Law and it's 150th year the oldest law<br>faculty in New Zealand<br>and it's my great pleasure on behalf of<br>the faculty to invite to welcome you to<br>this inaugural professorial lecture of<br>our friend and colleague Nikki Taylor<br>and to introduce her and to work to you<br>Nikki is currently the director of the<br>children's Su Center<br>while this is Nikki's night and we're<br>here to celebrate her achievements<br>and hear of her research Journey<br>and there is nothing more boring than<br>someone who talks about themselves<br>rather than the person whose Knight it<br>is I do want to acknowledge that not<br>only has Nikki been a great friend to me<br>that that I would not actually be here<br>but for Nikki in many ways<br>Nikki and I our friendship began when we<br>were parents of two preschool children<br>and without Nikki telling me that she<br>was working in her professional career<br>and had two small children<br>and was studying for a law degree<br>I probably never would have resumed and<br>completed my law degree we studied<br>together and like people who studied<br>together we gossiped together and talked<br>about other than the law<br>and the Highlight for us in our law<br>degree<br>was the night we went on a nighttime<br>and his two youngish mothers returning<br>to our homes at five o'clock in the<br>morning it was at one point exhausting<br>and at the other rather liberating as we<br>were captured our youth<br>we had hoped we would be in the same<br>patrol car<br>but unfortunately we were separated when<br>we got to the police station<br>Nikki continued with her work in the<br>children's issue Center completed a PhD<br>and I joined the faculty and it has been<br>a personal and professional joy for me<br>at the Children's issues Center joined<br>the faculty in 2018.<br>Nikki was appointed to the Alexander<br>McMillan leading thinker chair and is<br>director of the children's issue Center<br>in 2012.<br>and a couple of years after finding her<br>true home in law she was promoted to<br>Professor from February 2021<br>Nikki is an interdisciplinary scholar a<br>socio-legal scholar<br>combining her training and social work<br>and law to make a difference to the<br>lives of children young persons and<br>their family through both her teaching<br>and your research<br>over her career she's attracted<br>significant amounts of research funding<br>and be the prolific prolablisher of<br>peer-reviewed Articles and chapters<br>and a valued contributor to many<br>International collaborations on<br>children's issues<br>often her work has been about hearing<br>children's voices and decisions that<br>have been made about them<br>so that their autonomy is recognized in<br>a manner that is appropriate to them<br>she has supervised many great<br>postgraduate students<br>and has a reputation as a careful and<br>caring supervisor<br>who enables students who often are<br>actually busy practitioners at the same<br>time to achieve the very best that they<br>are capable of<br>Nikki currently teaches in the law<br>faculty the undergraduate paper and<br>family law<br>there are many lawyers in one way in<br>another<br>either as students<br>including those who've completed in the<br>past diplomas with the children's issue<br>Center<br>and practitioners<br>have benefited from Nikki's scholarship<br>and your passion for the subject<br>he's been actively engaged with a legal<br>profession it was the Family Division of<br>the New Zealand Law Society<br>her work and that the center she leads<br>has been and continues to be significant<br>in law reform<br>and in the practice of family law and<br>social work in this country and indeed<br>internationally<br>throughout a career I know that Nikki<br>has been supported by her husband Mike<br>and your three children Lloyd Alex in<br>Victoria all three are graduates of<br>otago Lloyd and Victoria both in law<br>in the second star of Nikki's IPL poster<br>behind us it's her granddaughter Emilia<br>for these reasons for all of these<br>reasons it's not surprising she's chosen<br>as a topic in the title for her<br>inaugural professorial lecture family<br>law matters<br>which more you think about it there's<br>lots and lots of meaning and I'm sure<br>that's what Nikki is about to explore<br>with us now<br>please welcome Professor Nicola Taylor<br>to deliver her inaugural professori<br>elect<br>warm greetings to you all and thank you<br>for being present here today Professor<br>Blakey Professor Palmer Professor<br>Griffiths<br>former Chancellor Dr royd and Somerville<br>KC Anita Chan KC<br>research cluster members colleagues of<br>mine from The Faculty of law<br>local family law practitioners<br>colleagues friends and students<br>thank you all for coming and a very warm<br>welcome also to those watching online<br>know my Hari my welcome<br>well as Shelley has indicated I was<br>actually promoted to Professor during<br>the covert pandemic and this IPL has<br>been a long time in the coming because<br>of the lockdowns and the alert levels<br>that we all experienced but one of the<br>real Great benefits of that delay has<br>been the opportunity to present this IPL<br>during the 150th year of the law faculty<br>we had a very special celebration just<br>three weeks ago in this very lecture<br>theater to celebrate otago being the<br>oldest Law School here in New Zealand<br>and as I say it's incredibly special to<br>be presenting the first IPL in that<br>150th year and I guess I can also claim<br>as a result of the weekend events in<br>London the first and the reign of King<br>so I want to start with where my<br>research Journey began here at the<br>University of otago back in 1995 a very<br>long time ago now<br>so I was appointed to work with<br>Professor Ann Smith the inaugural<br>director of the children's issue Center<br>and it's lovely to see John her husband<br>and Catherine her daughter here in the<br>audience tonight<br>we<br>we're tasked with developing a brand new<br>interdisciplinary Center<br>on children's issues to do with<br>development rights and well-being for<br>new zealanders no other Center like it<br>in the country and indeed really in much<br>of the southern hemisphere<br>so after a very daunting interview over<br>in the clock tower presided over by the<br>Vice Chancellor at the time Dr Graham<br>Fogelberg and with community and<br>University Representatives I was<br>delighted when Ian rang that afternoon<br>to say guess what you've got the job<br>and this is the opening of the center on<br>the 20th of July at that stage we were<br>based at 117 Albany Street by works and<br>services opposite the Eureka Cafe<br>and as you can see here the center was<br>opened by the governor general at the<br>time Dame Keith tizzard Graham Fogelberg<br>watching on closely<br>Pat Seymour who was chairperson of the<br>children's issue Center trust which had<br>raised a great deal of the money to help<br>fund the center and partnership with the<br>university and of course the wonderful<br>Ann Smith looking on with great delight<br>at the final opening of her dream<br>so we were joined at that time also by<br>Rachel Brinston who I'm pleased to say<br>is also here in the audience<br>so there were three staff we were funded<br>for the first three years by the<br>children's issue Center trust in the<br>University provided the premises and<br>office equipment and computers etc<br>and so the three of us after the<br>excitement of the opening with the<br>governor general had to sit down with<br>basically a blank page and work out what<br>is it we're actually going to do of<br>course we wanted to bring an external<br>research money and grow and sustain the<br>center and we did that fairly quickly<br>but we also had to think about what was<br>that we were really going to focus on<br>and Ian and I decided that we would<br>focus on our respective strengths so Ann<br>was a developmental psychologist expert<br>in early childhood education and the<br>quality thereof<br>and of course I had the family law<br>background so we were a great<br>combination and was a phenomenal mentor<br>and a great inspiration to many of us<br>here in this room tonight<br>so we got underway<br>and took as has already been mentioned<br>tonight very seriously this idea of<br>listening to what children themselves<br>had to say about their own experiences<br>in their daily lives and obviously for<br>me a lot of that has been in relation to<br>family law proceedings which I'll talk<br>more about tonight<br>um this was a visit by the otago<br>University Child Care Center and I've<br>only really included the slide because<br>obviously we weren't talking to Children<br>this young but as Shelley has mentioned<br>um we bonded over our two youngest<br>children Victoria and Timothy and they<br>are both proudly sitting in the pram so<br>they came on that visit and you can see<br>the center we were joined Within by Dr<br>Michael Gaffney who's now currently at<br>the College of Education<br>and took very seriously this idea of<br>thinking about which was novel at the<br>time actually nobody else was really<br>doing this in New Zealand what do<br>children themselves have to say about<br>important matters and issues that happen<br>within their family<br>and these are just some of the books<br>that we did in our very early years so<br>you get the message from the titles you<br>know advocating for children children's<br>voices children as Citizens<br>and we were really capturing at the time<br>the developments that were happening<br>internationally around childhood studies<br>which was at that stage a fairly new<br>discipline<br>and also the ratification by New Zealand<br>in 1993 of the U.N convention on the<br>rights of the child<br>and so we combined our sort of<br>theoretical and rights-based<br>understandings with a fairly sort of<br>unique conceptual framework actually<br>that underpinned our postgraduate<br>teaching within the center but also our<br>research projects because we wanted to<br>honor children and hear what they had to<br>say not what other people said about<br>what children wanted<br>I'd like to acknowledge at this point<br>two other really important people in my<br>research career so firstly Dr Megan<br>gotop who's sitting here beside Rachel<br>I'm deputy director of the center she<br>joined the center in 1996 and obviously<br>we've worked together I hate to count<br>the number of years actually for over<br>two decades anyway very closely and<br>particularly on a lot of the family law<br>work that I'm going to be talking about<br>tonight<br>and I'd secondly just like to<br>acknowledge Jocelyn diedrichs or no one<br>to us all as Josie sister of Royden and<br>family court judge Anna Somerville<br>Josie was our administrator from 2002 to<br>2018 so a very long period she took over<br>from the very capable Rachel<br>um and sadly passed away<br>um last year so we must have very much<br>and are thinking how much we would have<br>loved to have had both here and and here<br>and present in the room tonight had that<br>been possible but Jossie was a very<br>warm-hearted and embracing person that<br>the students just loved and she had a<br>great sense of humor that we all really<br>enjoyed and that Meg and I still<br>reminisce about so Meg thank you hugely<br>to you for the contribution you've made<br>and hopefully you'll recognize a lot of<br>it and what I'm about to talk about<br>tonight<br>so as Shelley also mentioned I'm kind of<br>playing with this word matters tonight<br>looking at it in the sense of a noun and<br>as a verb and I'm going to start the<br>presentation or this next part of the<br>presentation in relation to the family<br>law matters in the sense of the sort of<br>topics and issues that I have worked on<br>I've had to be selective otherwise you'd<br>be here all night but I'm really<br>focusing on these four and I'm going to<br>work through these talking about a<br>little bit about the legal framework<br>that sits behind each area<br>some of the research that we've done and<br>as Richard alluded to the very important<br>policy and practice developments that<br>have come out of much of this research<br>which have really been hugely rewarding<br>in my career<br>so turning firstly to thinking about<br>children's views and participation and<br>family law contexts<br>what our very first study in this regard<br>was on access Arrangements following<br>parental separation<br>it was funded by the then foundation for<br>research science and technology<br>and we had a sample of 107 children and<br>young people from 73 families across I<br>think it was about seven Family Court<br>districts across the country<br>and what we were looking at with the<br>children because remember this was<br>pretty new back in the in the 90s was<br>talking to the children themselves about<br>what contact or as it was called then<br>access they were having with their<br>non-resident parent<br>and how involved I'd been in the<br>decisions that were being made within<br>their family<br>around<br>post-separation contact and Care<br>Arrangements after the appearance had<br>separated<br>so we were Keen to know what sort of<br>involvement had they had and what was<br>their satisfaction with the level of<br>their involvement<br>and this slide here shows our Early<br>Access Arrangements research team so<br>Michael Gaffney the Megan looking like a<br>child<br>um myself looking not much older the<br>lovely Anne a young Mark Hennigan who<br>many of you will recognize and Max gold<br>who was a specialist report writer for<br>the family court so much of the research<br>that I've done has actually been an<br>interdisciplinary teams which has been<br>one of the joys of doing that work<br>and of course what we found was that<br>back in the 90s not many children<br>actually were asked for their views<br>about how they wanted to split their<br>time or share their time with each of<br>the appearance after they'd separated or<br>divorced those who had felt heard were a<br>lot more satisfied with the outcome so<br>you kind of get the drift in terms of<br>what those<br>findings were from that study<br>we also around a similar time were<br>commissioned by the department for<br>courts the pre-runner of the ministry of<br>Justice to look at the role of lawyer<br>for child because it was not uncommon in<br>the 90s that when lawyers were lawyers<br>were appointed by the court to represent<br>Children and Family Court proceedings<br>the lawyer actually never often met with<br>the children and so sometimes the<br>children were completely unaware that<br>they actually had a lawyer representing<br>them<br>so we were asked to go and do some<br>research with children to find out from<br>them what their perspectives were on the<br>lawyers that were appointed to represent<br>them and this is just a couple of the<br>quotes it's two of the ready switched on<br>kids gave us which really epitomized the<br>sort of issues that children tell us<br>frequently in our research you know<br>listening really hard being able to get<br>everything out that sense of trust<br>between a child in a family Justice<br>professional she goes over it all so we<br>know what's going on<br>you know I think Craig's quote is quite<br>um pivotal too lawyer for child opens up<br>a whole new thing for the judge it was<br>dad's views mum's views but you need a<br>third party to bring the judge's eyes<br>around he needs a third party in the<br>middle to be me so a really good<br>understanding of what the role of lawyer<br>for child is and really important to<br>hear what children themselves said about<br>the experience of being represented by a<br>lawyer it wasn't all Rosie but a lot of<br>it was<br>the other area that a few years down the<br>track that I did research on was<br>professor John Caldwell from Canterbury<br>University law school and I interviewed<br>all 53 at the time New Zealand Family<br>Court judges around the country<br>to ascertain their perspectives and<br>experience on meeting with children<br>because it had been really promoted<br>within New Zealand that it was a good<br>idea for judges to be meeting with the<br>with children if children wanted to take<br>up that opportunity it's not so in every<br>country Australia for example very<br>rarely do it but here in New Zealand<br>it's become very common practice<br>and actually enter some of all who I<br>mentioned earlier was a real gun at<br>doing these meetings with children as<br>young as four years of age in the<br>Tauranga Family Court<br>so here's a couple of quotes from judges<br>that I think really helped to show the<br>benefit of children's participation and<br>proceedings if they indeed want to do<br>that putting that personal face the<br>judge gets an understanding of who the<br>child is it's not just words on<br>affidavits and oral evidence in court<br>it's actually understanding who that<br>child is as a person and also that the<br>children actually surprisingly come up<br>with some amazingly as he says cracking<br>phrases of information<br>which the appearance who are in dispute<br>with each other have been completely<br>unable to do so sometimes the judges<br>actually find that the child is the one<br>that puts food away away through the<br>dispute that they're experiencing<br>and Judge 45 says I've really felt it's<br>a benefit<br>and then the other judge if you're able<br>to make decisions that will perhaps<br>change the life direction of a child and<br>have the confidence to do that which of<br>course judges are doing all the time why<br>not have the confidence to communicate<br>with the person whose life you are<br>changing<br>so these sorts of studies that we were<br>doing the axis study lawyer for child<br>judges perspectives on meeting with<br>children and other studies too have<br>actually had a really profound influence<br>on the law policy and practice here<br>within New Zealand but also I'm happy to<br>say internationally<br>and there's really two things that have<br>fallen out of this to summarize it<br>children's desire to have their views<br>ascertained and heard most children do<br>want to have a say they don't want to<br>make the decision so we talk about this<br>as a voice not a choice<br>but the other really Salient issue that<br>I think has come out of our research is<br>the really important role of Family<br>Justice professionals like lawyers for<br>children like judges and facilitating<br>and Scaffolding children's understanding<br>of their family situation<br>and the issues that are in dispute and<br>the potential ways forward from that for<br>them<br>so just some of the highlights of areas<br>where we have had an influence on the<br>law I'm not saying we were the whole<br>influence but we were certainly part of<br>it was the widening of the requirement<br>for children to express their views in<br>section six of the care of children Act<br>modernizing the role of lawyer for child<br>so that lawyers for children must now<br>meet with the child they're appointed to<br>represent unless there's exceptional<br>circumstances and that's reflected in<br>the care of children act in the Family<br>Court sector but also in the practice<br>notes issued by the principal family<br>court judge<br>and then as a result of the work that I<br>did with family court judges directly I<br>was invited by the principal family<br>court judge to write the chapter in The<br>Family Court bench book on how best for<br>judges to be undertaking those meetings<br>with children so it's really great to<br>see that translation from research<br>through to policy and ultimately through<br>to practice<br>in terms of international developments<br>um<br>partly enthused by Professor Nicola<br>piet's paper on comparative law when I<br>was doing my LLB degree here at otago I<br>was really delighted to get my first<br>taste of international comparative<br>research myself in 2009 through children<br>in the law study group that I co-lead<br>which actually had the benefit of<br>resulting in a meeting at Charles<br>University in Prague so that wasn't too<br>bad<br>um so that was really a great<br>um way of getting to start to understand<br>how other countries approach children's<br>views and participation in Happily New<br>Zealand sits pretty much at the<br>Forefront in that area so we're often<br>looked to in relation to our law and our<br>practice here by other countries<br>this International handbook that you can<br>see pictured there covers 17<br>jurisdictions and was written with<br>colleagues from London and the<br>Netherlands and just published a couple<br>of years ago<br>and then more recently I've been happy<br>to be involved in a project with<br>rossfield University in Denmark where<br>I'm an international consultant on their<br>project working with the courts and<br>profession over there<br>to look at how to enhance child<br>involvement in Danish family law<br>proceedings<br>so there's some amazing developments<br>that occur as a result of that<br>stepping slightly outside of the law I<br>just want to mention this ethical<br>research involving children or Eric as<br>we call it for short<br>because this was another child watch<br>International project which Professor<br>Ann Graham from the Center for Children<br>and young people in Australia and I<br>co-lead because we recognized that one<br>of the issues of doing research properly<br>with children<br>was actually understanding the many<br>ethical issues that underpin that so<br>things like consent confidentiality<br>safety those sorts of issues and we<br>recognized there was a gap<br>internationally in terms of guidance for<br>ethical review boards<br>researchers postgraduate students<br>other students undertaking research<br>involving children and we produce this<br>Eric compendium<br>but more importantly the child<br>ethics.com website which is now<br>available happily in seven languages and<br>has thousands of hits per month<br>so another really<br>project that's been really close to my<br>heart in terms of being able to you know<br>Assist people undertaking research with<br>children given that we'd promoted it so<br>heavily at the center to actually have<br>the tools both research and ethically to<br>do that and you know for example this is<br>a document that our own human Ethics<br>Committee here at the University of<br>otago are very good at promoting when<br>applications come to them that involve<br>it's not just Family Justice<br>professionals that we've been working<br>with to try and encourage children's<br>voices in participation happily in the<br>study that we did looking at parenting<br>after separation it was part of a bigger<br>study looking at the effect of the 2014<br>family law reforms that were introduced<br>but it involved as you can see some<br>pretty large numbers of people so we had<br>one one phase which was looking at<br>separated parents with an online survey<br>and then we interviewed 191 of them<br>and we were interested in looking at<br>what the steps were that they took to<br>make or change the apparenting<br>arrangements since those 2014 reforms<br>had come into being because they did<br>change the pathways within the court<br>somewhat significantly as a result of<br>efforts to try and reduce the cost of<br>the course to the country<br>and to put more onus on parents reaching<br>their own resolution through family<br>dispute resolution mediation<br>and I've just got a note there that<br>um you know 67 of those separated<br>parents that we had involved in this<br>study described their relationship with<br>their former partner as poor or very<br>poor so like we're not just talking<br>about amiable happy Cooperative<br>separated parents we're talking about<br>you know families where there's all<br>sorts of conflict dispute hostility and<br>at times violence<br>we also in that study uh did a survey<br>and interviews with a lot of family<br>Justice professionals too but in terms<br>of what I'm going to present here I'm<br>really just talking about the parent<br>data<br>so the 417 separated parents who did the<br>survey and that you know we interviewed<br>a number of them we asked them to tell<br>us what the steps were that they took to<br>resolve those parenting Arrangements<br>post-separation it was a possible 33<br>steps that they could that they could<br>select from<br>and having selected the steps that they<br>used we then asked them to rank the top<br>three steps that were most helpful to<br>them<br>and we were really thrilled surprised I<br>don't know me to see that<br>um the most helpful step that came out<br>of that parent data was talking with<br>children and seeking their thoughts<br>feelings and Views and I've put the blue<br>Highlight there on legal advice in the<br>family court so that those of you in the<br>Family Justice Community can feel<br>somewhat basking in the glory that your<br>advice and supporters also<br>considered helpful by nearly half of the<br>families that were in our study so it's<br>great to think that you know we're not<br>just trying to<br>encourage parents encourage sorry Family<br>Justice professionals like lawyers and<br>judges to be talking with children if<br>that works but also to see those<br>conversations happening with them the<br>families themselves<br>and this was just a lovely quote from<br>one of the mums in the study about<br>wanting to hear what their children's<br>opinions were you know sitting down we<br>talked about what each of us wanted as<br>parents<br>ex-partners<br>and then we sat down as a family and<br>discussed it with the kids and gave them<br>an opportunity to tell us how they felt<br>we put it to them as mum and dad have<br>talked about it and this is what we<br>think would be best but we want to hear<br>what your opinions are so really you<br>know from a research perspective from a<br>human rights perspective I don't think<br>you can ask for a whole lot more<br>um it was a great finding<br>turning to my second matter family law<br>matter relationship property division so<br>this is much more recent work I'm just<br>going to give you a bit of law to start<br>with so<br>um the general rule under the property<br>relationships Act of 1976 is that each<br>partner is entitled to share equally in<br>relationship property regardless of<br>their contribution subject to limited<br>exceptions<br>so if this extraordinary circumstances<br>economic disparity or it's a<br>relationship of short duration then the<br>equal sharing rule may not necessarily<br>apply<br>and furthermore it's possible and if<br>you're in contemplation of a<br>relationship or you're already in a<br>relationship to contract out of that pra<br>equal sharing regime and I'll explain a<br>little further how that works<br>so the law commission has been tasked<br>with reviewing this property<br>relationships act and produced a very<br>substantial report for the Minister of<br>Justice in 2019<br>but was sadly lacking<br>um in the lead-up to that report and any<br>empirical data to help inform the<br>recommendations that they subsequently<br>wanted to make<br>so we were contracted<br>um<br>and funded by the Boren Foundation<br>to undertake two phases of work the<br>first phase of which contributed<br>directly to that 2019 report<br>and that was a large representative<br>sample study using Colmar Brunton<br>actually did it for us looking at public<br>attitudes and values to post-separation<br>relationship property division<br>and then in phase two which we just<br>completed last year we did a survey and<br>interviewed a whole lot of families<br>about how separated couples actually go<br>about dividing their property and<br>resolving any disputes between them<br>so that's the research team we've got<br>now Justice Helen McQueen<br>who was at that time the deputy<br>president of the law commission myself<br>Mark Megan Ian Binney an independent<br>research contractor<br>um<br>and yeah law commission people there so<br>what we found on that survey was that<br>actually there was a very high awareness<br>of the equal sharing law 79 of their<br>representative sample over the age of 18<br>across New Zealand knew about equal<br>sharing<br>74 agreed with it<br>but when we put various scenarios to<br>them they were very quick to depart from<br>that concept of equal sharing in<br>particular circumstances and the two<br>that I've got up there are where a<br>person is coming into a relationship<br>with an already mortgage-free home they<br>didn't believe that it was fear that the<br>other partner at the point of Separation<br>got to equally share in that home<br>and the other scenario of course<br>um is where one part has given up their<br>career to stay at home and care for the<br>couple's children and there was a<br>general feeling that on separation that<br>person needed to be kind of compensated<br>or rewarded<br>for their loss of earnings and the<br>inability to get back into the workforce<br>and the place that they would have been<br>had they not stepped out of it<br>what was also quite alarming I think for<br>Megan and I was that 80 of our sample<br>um talked about experiencing emotional<br>distress anxiety and stress while<br>dividing their property<br>so I think it's really important for<br>Family Justice professionals and perhaps<br>for<br>you know family members Neighbors in the<br>street to understand that when people<br>are going through relationship property<br>division disputes<br>a can be a pretty tough time and<br>lawyers were the first professional that<br>75 percent of our respondents sought out<br>for help advice and information showing<br>again the significance of the legal<br>profession and the family law space here<br>in New Zealand<br>and interestingly when we asked them how<br>they reached agreement over their<br>property division<br>well 48 of them did it just themselves<br>with their former partner 45 negotiated<br>via professionals who were mostly<br>lawyers again<br>in only eight percent end up in the<br>courts<br>71 of those who resolve their property<br>division themselves reported their<br>outcome was fully or partially<br>consistent with the law of equal sharing<br>so again you can see that real influence<br>of understanding what the law provides<br>for in these situations and how people<br>therefore organize their agreements in<br>response to that<br>now Contracting out is another really<br>interesting area because this very<br>strict legal rules around how a couple<br>can contract out of that equal sharing<br>law<br>so any agreement that they reach has to<br>be in writing and signed by both parties<br>they each have to have independent legal<br>advice before they sign<br>the signature of each party has to be<br>witnessed by a lawyer and that lawyer<br>has to certify that before the parties<br>signed the agreement the lawyer<br>explained the effect and implication of<br>the agreement because by departing from<br>equal sharing one party is going to end<br>up with significantly more and the other<br>one will probably end up with<br>significantly less as a result so the<br>law is very careful here to guard<br>against unequal bargaining positions or<br>oppressive agreements and that's why it<br>insists upon this independent legal<br>advice<br>um the agreement can of course be set<br>aside of giving effect to it would cause<br>serious Injustice<br>so we were interested in our research to<br>understand what are people's experience<br>and knowledge of Contracting out of the<br>pra<br>and um perhaps unsurprisingly we found<br>it wasn't common to have a prenuptial<br>agreement as they're often called only<br>seven percent of those in our sample had<br>actually made an agreement that was<br>certified by a lawyer now a lot of other<br>people in the study talked about having<br>an agreement but it was either verbal or<br>if it was written it had not been<br>certified by a lawyer so we think<br>there's a real Gap here that people<br>possibly believe they have a valid<br>Contracting out agreement but because it<br>doesn't meet the requirements of the law<br>if they ever went to enact that or use<br>it in a court case it would be invalid<br>72 percent hadn't even discussed<br>Contracting out with their partner and<br>the 25 percent who had considered it as<br>in that thought about it<br>less than half of them actually went<br>ahead and discussed that Contracting out<br>possibility with their partner and I<br>mean again it's not surprising but the<br>reasons that they gave where well the<br>relationship wasn't that serious<br>we didn't actually have enough property<br>to share so we weren't too bothered<br>about trying to contract out of an equal<br>sharing arrangement<br>and then of course the possible negative<br>impact that raising a Contracting out<br>agreement might have on their<br>relationship and as one person put it it<br>might set an expectation that the<br>relationship will fail so probably not<br>the smartest move in order to enter into<br>a new relationship by trying to get a<br>Contracting out agreement but we think<br>it's important that this issue is given<br>greater consideration and one of the<br>things that we did at the end of last<br>year well it took us actually all year<br>to write these Meg but we wrote six<br>research highlights again funded by the<br>Boron Foundation drawing on that data<br>we'd got from the surveys and from the<br>interviews<br>to try and write in layman's terms using<br>the experience of those people that took<br>part in our study<br>to offer advice and guidance in the form<br>of these six particular topics I've just<br>got the Contracting out one there which<br>is number five which have been widely<br>distributed through the family law<br>section of the Law Society citizens<br>advice Bureau and the like<br>so again it's another illustration of<br>how we're really Keen to make sure that<br>our research you know arrives in the<br>public Arena and can benefit people<br>going through these very challenging<br>experiences<br>right turning to relocation disputes<br>well a relocation dispute arises<br>obviously following parental separation<br>and divorce when one parent is wanting<br>to move away with the children either<br>within New Zealand or indeed<br>internationally and the dispute arises<br>because the other parent objects to that<br>proposed relocation<br>usually because of the significant<br>impact it's going to have on their<br>relationship in contact with the child<br>because the child will now be physically<br>distant from them<br>it's an area of law where there's no<br>rules or presumptions the welfare and<br>best interests of the child is Paramount<br>and that's in section four of the care<br>of children act<br>so basically what happens in this area<br>is that parents and Guardians and those<br>of you that are parents hopefully know<br>this<br>is that on important matters affecting<br>your child like their name their place<br>of residence non-routine medical<br>treatment religion<br>um<br>schooling<br>both parents guardians or all parents<br>Guardians if there's more than two must<br>consult and agree on any changes to<br>their child's place of residence and<br>those other important matters if a<br>parent doesn't engage in that<br>consultation and seeking the agreement<br>of the other parent<br>and they move unilaterally without that<br>person's consent you know if it's within<br>New Zealand the court can order them<br>back<br>order the child back to the original<br>location<br>if they move unilaterally and take the<br>child overseas then it becomes<br>technically a wrongful removal under the<br>hay convention on International child<br>abduction and I'll talk in a minute<br>about how that process works so you know<br>pretty serious stuff that sits at the<br>heart of these cases<br>so we undertook New Zealand's first<br>study on relocation funded by the New<br>Zealand law Foundation myself Mark<br>Hennigan and Megan again were involved<br>in this project we had the strong<br>support of the principal family court<br>judge and the family law section of the<br>New Zealand Law Society who assisted us<br>hugely with recruitment of families into<br>the study<br>and you can see there we had 114 parents<br>um who we interviewed twice over a 12 to<br>18 month period so Megan and I were in<br>rental cars all over New Zealand zooming<br>around meeting with these families and<br>it was well worth going back that second<br>time about a year later because you know<br>they had got to know us by the end we<br>got a lot more data actually on the<br>second visit<br>and Megan for the most part interviewed<br>44 children from 30 of those<br>so what that study did was contributed<br>hugely to the Quest for international<br>consistency there was this really strong<br>desire internationally to have a more<br>consistent approach to relocation<br>disputes because different jurisdictions<br>deal with these cases quite differently<br>and I've just given a couple of examples<br>here so in England and Wales<br>relocations usually I mean mostly these<br>applications are brought by mums were<br>mostly allowed and this was a famous<br>case of pain and pain where<br>Lord Justice Thorpe in the English court<br>of appeals said<br>that the effect on the mother's future<br>psychological and emotional stability<br>was of concern to the court of the<br>application to relocate was refused<br>so the idea was that you allowed the<br>mother to shift with the children<br>particularly if she was the primary<br>parent and the sort of happy mother<br>happy child kind of scenario would play<br>out because Mum would be able to then be<br>the best parent she could be to the<br>children in that new location<br>so many dads in England and Wales didn't<br>in this period even bother bringing<br>applications to the court because they<br>knew that she would be allowed to go<br>with the kids<br>conversely here in New Zealand we've had<br>a much more 50 50 approach<br>um in a much more individualized<br>approach which of course is as<br>consistent with our care of children at<br>requirements but much greater emphasis<br>here on the idea of keeping both parents<br>involved in their children's lives<br>ideally post separation so much more<br>difficult to be able to argue a<br>successful relocation case here because<br>of the impact that that shift would have<br>on the Left Behind parents relationship<br>with their children<br>so we just Struck it lucky in terms of<br>timing with our study<br>um I was invited in 2009 this is Lord<br>Justice Thorpe here with the fancy wig<br>to a a commonwealth and common law<br>jurisdiction conference that he was<br>putting together in Windsor<br>incumbent and Lodge in the Windsor Great<br>Park and presented the New Zealand<br>research evidence<br>and as a result of that presentation I<br>was then tapped on the shoulder and<br>asked to pair up with Professor Marilyn<br>Freeman from London<br>to write a paper reviewing all the<br>research evidence on International<br>family Mobility<br>for the next<br>cross-border family relocation judicial<br>conference that was being held in<br>Washington DC the following year<br>and that was really where my partnership<br>with Maryland which I took a bit more<br>about in a minute started to develop<br>we've done very similar research in<br>terms of relocation and we work now very<br>closely together on abduction matters<br>but it was just a wonderful opportunity<br>to be paired with a person from the<br>Northern Hemisphere to work on an issue<br>of great common interest to us but also<br>to see it play out in their cross<br>jurisdictional<br>judicial arena in both Windsor and in<br>Washington<br>so just turning to my last family law<br>matter International child abduction<br>so here we have a hay convention that<br>governs this area<br>an international treaty it currently has<br>103 Contracting states around the world<br>and New Zealand became a Contracting<br>State back in 1991 so we're a fairly<br>long-standing member of this hay<br>convention and it sits now as part of<br>our care of children Act 2004.<br>a quite different approach is adopted in<br>relation to abduction matters so unlike<br>relocation where it's the welfare and<br>best interest of the child that's<br>important<br>here it's a quite different scenario<br>so basically the convention applies when<br>a child is either wrongfully removed<br>from one country to another or indeed<br>retained in another country perhaps<br>while they're on holiday and not<br>returned back to their<br>state of Habitual residence with where<br>they've been living up to date<br>and that's retention or removal has to<br>be in breach of the other parents rights<br>of custody<br>so if this indeed happens then the Left<br>Behind parent can apply through the<br>essential Authority for the child to be<br>returned to their country of Habitual<br>residence I brought back to where<br>they're living<br>and the whole premise behind us hey<br>convention is that it's the courts in<br>that country<br>who then address the care and contact<br>and Welfare matters and dispute between<br>the parents<br>so it's really<br>focused around summary proceedings the<br>rapid location of the child because<br>sometimes these kids are hidden and can<br>be difficult to find but having found<br>them for the year to be these summary<br>quick proceedings and the Speedy Return<br>of the child back to the other country<br>where the courts can then work out those<br>larger welfare care and contact matters<br>so it's the Forum or the jurisdiction<br>not the child's welfare that's really at<br>play here<br>unless one of the very limited<br>convention exceptions applies and this<br>is where Marilyn and I have been<br>applying our knowledge and expertise in<br>recent years so two of those exceptions<br>to return<br>the first is that the abducted child him<br>or herself objects to being returned<br>back to the country of origin<br>and we had a British Academy Grant in<br>2018<br>to conduct an online International<br>survey of Family Justice professionals<br>to try and get a handle on what<br>different jurisdictions were doing in<br>respect of this particular exception and<br>then we also interviewed a whole range<br>of Family Justice professionals abducted<br>children taking parents and left behind<br>parents<br>the second exception<br>is this one of grave risk and this is<br>becoming really critically important now<br>with our unfortunate growth in domestic<br>violence within family situations<br>post-separation<br>so basically what this exception says is<br>that if there's a grave risk that the<br>child's return back to that state of<br>Habitual residence would expose a child<br>to physical or psychological harm or<br>otherwise place the child in a tolerable<br>situation then that can be a ground for<br>the judge to exercise their discretion<br>and not order the child to be returned<br>it's um a very high standard to reach<br>because of this idea of summary<br>proceedings and quick rapid Return of<br>the child ideally<br>but it's becoming<br>um critical because what's now happening<br>it's a very frequently argued exception<br>because woman in particular are fleeing<br>domestic violence situations in their<br>home country and taking their children<br>with them often returning to their<br>Homeland but possibly to a whole new<br>country to try and secure both fear and<br>their children's safety and protection<br>and so it becomes critical for the<br>convention in these situations<br>to really start considering from a<br>policy perspective whether it's<br>appropriate to have a you know to have a<br>have the focus of this area of law being<br>on Speedy return when that may be posing<br>danger and risk to the child in<br>particular if they are returned back to<br>their Homeland<br>so we've got a current International<br>survey operating online at the moment<br>internationally to try and get an<br>understanding of what family Justice<br>professionals around the world are<br>having to say in relation to the arguing<br>of this exception whether they're<br>noticing any growth in the a number of<br>times it's being argued and the sort of<br>policy considerations that are of<br>concern in their country in relation to<br>it<br>other projects that um involved in<br>um Meg and I are currently analyzing 10<br>years worth of data from our ministry of<br>Justice here in New Zealand one of the<br>big conundrums internationally in this<br>whole area under the hay convention is<br>actually not knowing what happens on<br>return for those children there's very<br>little research evidence in relation to<br>whether or not those anticipated Court<br>proceedings do in fact occur<br>and fortunately for us our Central<br>Authority here in the ministry of<br>Justice in Wellington has been<br>collecting child return data so these<br>are children who have been abducted from<br>New Zealand to another country and have<br>been either ordered to return back to<br>New Zealand or there's been a parental<br>consent agreement reach that they do<br>return<br>and we are in thick in the middle aren't<br>we Meg of analyzing encoding that data<br>and it's really going to be the First<br>Data internationally that is going to<br>give us some perspective on what happens<br>for these children by way of further<br>Court proceedings on their return to<br>their state of Habitual residence<br>uh in October this year I'm going to be<br>in London I've been appointed as<br>repertoire for an experts meeting which<br>is going to be looking at issues to do<br>with Asylum domestic violence and child<br>participation in relation to abduction<br>proceedings<br>and Marilyn and I have got a couple of<br>books coming out<br>um one very shortly actually the first<br>one research handbook on International<br>child abduction<br>and uh next year one looking at this<br>issue of young children and young<br>people's identities an international law<br>and part of that book will include the<br>identity issues in relation to abducted<br>children<br>late last year we launched this website<br>called finding home the name of which<br>was given to it by a group of children<br>and young people that we had working in<br>an Advisory Group with the research team<br>to try and get some information<br>available on the internet for not just<br>for abducted children but also for<br>children generally to get a better<br>understanding about what abduction is<br>what the law says about it you know how<br>the hay convention Works how our<br>domestic statutes work we've used case<br>studies written especially for children<br>and importantly they've got a whole<br>section on it in relation to where they<br>can go for information and support so<br>this is really part of this sort of area<br>of work that I've got a strong interest<br>in around children's own access to<br>Justice and their legal literacy and at<br>the moment the website's only available<br>in English but the French and Spanish<br>translations have just been completed<br>and will be uploaded hopefully in the<br>next couple of weeks so we anticipate<br>hopefully that that the languages will<br>expand because that then makes of course<br>the accessibility to children and many<br>other jurisdictions much more easy<br>and finally the special commissions so<br>every five or six years the permanent<br>Bureau at The Hague<br>coordinate a special Commission on the<br>1980 Hague convention and they bring<br>delegations from each of the Contracting<br>States<br>to the peace Palace and the Hague so<br>this is me back in 2017. I was fortunate<br>enough to be a given Observer status at<br>the 2017 special commission and I've<br>been given the same status again at the<br>eighth special commission that's going<br>to be held in October this year<br>so it's a great opportunity for the<br>Contracting states to look at<br>operational issues so those couple that<br>I mentioned around the child's objection<br>exception and around grave risk will be<br>firmly on the agenda at the 2023<br>commission and from a research<br>perspective it's a great opportunity to<br>be engaging with lawyers judges other<br>ngos and academics who all have a really<br>strong and vested interest in doing<br>better in the international child<br>abduction space<br>so it's a great place to visit if you're<br>ever in The Hague<br>so turning to the last part of my<br>presentation tonight I want to look now<br>at Matters from another perspective why<br>does family law matter<br>and I'm going to start with the 1976<br>report of the royal Commission on the<br>courts which was the body that was<br>tasked back in the 70s with looking at<br>the structure and operation of our court<br>structure here in New Zealand<br>and many of the recommendations related<br>to the need to introduce a family court<br>in New Zealand rather than having the<br>Supreme Court and magistrates court at<br>the time<br>hearing applications in relation to<br>Family Matters<br>now the Royal commission made a couple<br>of remarks which my students will<br>recognize work and family law has an<br>extra Dimension and I'm going to talk<br>more about that in a minute but I think<br>it's really important to realize that<br>you're not just dealing with the law<br>here you're dealing with very human<br>situations and that extra Dimension is<br>something I draw into my students every<br>year and I expect to see in their exam<br>scripts that they are not just telling<br>me the law but they're showing me how<br>they're responding to the clients and<br>the scenarios in a Humane sensitive and<br>caring fashion<br>and the Royal commission also said that<br>family courts have a two-fold function<br>judicial and therapeutic and hopefully<br>what I've shown you tonight with some of<br>my research is how we're trying to<br>balance that at the center and in The<br>Faculty to try and ensure that students<br>are coming out well-rounded and fully<br>equipped practitioners because as you've<br>seen<br>the role of lawyers in society and<br>family law in particular is very much<br>welcomed by family members and embraced<br>by them when they are in dispute with<br>each other<br>so our family court was established here<br>in 1981 directly as a result of these<br>recommendations from that Royal<br>Commission<br>one of the reasons why I think family<br>law really matters is its massive spread<br>of Cradle to the Grave is often talked<br>about now you'll see there on my first<br>couple of lines that I actually argue<br>it's actually before the cradle and it's<br>actually after the grave because family<br>law now applies before birth so if you<br>think about assistive human reproductive<br>Technologies and surrogacy sort of<br>issues and it certainly applies after<br>death because the will that you have<br>left May well be challenged by your<br>loved ones and you're not around to have<br>anything to do about that<br>many of the disputes are between adult<br>adult<br>parents and Guardians over things like<br>entering and leaving relationships over<br>their children and I've given some<br>examples of that with relocation and the<br>contact Arrangements in abduction<br>well the other really important area of<br>family law is State intervention<br>in relation to Family Violence to<br>protecting children to out of home care<br>and of course in the youth Justice space<br>so a massive breadth of issues that the<br>law is grappling to deal with<br>and what's really critical here is I've<br>called it high stakes because these are<br>profoundly personal issues these are<br>about your partners your spouses<br>possibly your former partners or spouses<br>critically significant if they're about<br>your children because you know the most<br>profoundly important people in your life<br>you're suddenly in dispute with your<br>ex-partner over and there needs to be a<br>lot of sensitivity and a responsive<br>legal framework<br>in order to ensure that further damage<br>is not done to that family relationship<br>scenario<br>I think it's also important to recognize<br>that family law and we don't necessarily<br>do this terribly well in many areas but<br>recognizing other family and whanau<br>relationships and I particularly want to<br>mention grandparents because<br>particularly in the out of Home Care<br>space often it's grandparents who are<br>raising their grandchildren<br>um and there's often only limited<br>opportunities for them to be able to<br>have a stake in family law proceedings<br>because of the way our law currently<br>being structured often around fairly<br>nuclear-based family scenarios<br>if you're not in dispute over the<br>important people in your life you're<br>likely to be in dispute over your<br>property<br>and your financial security which as I<br>showed with that pra study you know is<br>incredibly important to people that<br>you've got that sense of Financial<br>Security going forward and that the<br>property that you've built up together<br>is shared equally between you<br>at times two it can be safety and<br>protection<br>high-stakes areas in relation to your<br>own personal vulnerability<br>and indeed safety and at times your life<br>or your children's lives<br>and that sense of autonomy self-esteem<br>and feeling heard that many of us of<br>course want to have in our lives<br>family law also runs the gamut of human<br>emotion<br>so you know we've got everything in<br>family law from great joy and huge<br>excitement<br>through to distress fear and Trauma<br>uncertainty anger at times grief loss<br>and heartbreak bewilderment<br>and pragmatism<br>making a world Contracting out of the<br>pra appointing an enduring power of<br>attorney all very straightforward things<br>that you need to think about and be<br>doing in order to have some security as<br>you age<br>bargaining in the shadow of the law this<br>is a concept that's been around since<br>1979 it's not just unique to family law<br>but it's this idea that people<br>essentially settle matters themselves in<br>a way that takes into account what would<br>happen if the matter indeed went to<br>court<br>and obviously people when they're<br>bargaining in the shadow of the law are<br>very influenced by their own knowledge<br>and understanding of the law and that's<br>why I think our Center has put so much<br>emphasis on helping people to get a<br>better understanding and knowledge of<br>the law that might be pertinent to them<br>in relation to Family Matters<br>and as I showed with my pra research<br>findings<br>there's High awareness for example of<br>the equal sharing law<br>and people divide their property often<br>with just their former partner they're<br>not necessarily going to lawyers in the<br>courts<br>but 71 of them who did do that reported<br>that their property division was fully<br>or partially consistent with the law of<br>equal sharing so clearly the bargaining<br>in the shadow of that pra law and what<br>they would get had they gone to court so<br>I think it's a really important concept<br>to be thinking about in a way of<br>improving people's legal Literacy By<br>improving their understanding of<br>different aspects of the law relating to<br>relationships and to children for<br>example<br>rules and discretion has another really<br>important Area Family Law began heavily<br>influenced by its ecclesiastical and<br>church Beginnings so a lot of very moral<br>thinking about what was right and wrong<br>and family life<br>and huge weight put on the supremacy<br>this is back in the 1800s of fathers<br>rights and respect of their legitimate<br>children up until the age of 21.<br>gradually we began to see that erode as<br>the welfare of the child principal<br>started to take effect so in 1887 was<br>when it first came into our law here in<br>New Zealand and in 1926 it was elevated<br>to become the first in Paramount<br>consideration which is what it remains<br>today<br>however despite that sort of softening<br>of the rules<br>we still had a lot of presumptions<br>operating in family law so I'm just<br>going to use one example Tender Years<br>the idea that children under the age of<br>seven benefited from being in the<br>nurturing loving care of their mother<br>and boys at the age of seven would then<br>transfer to the custody of their father<br>in order to get his masculine influence<br>so even though we had this welfare and<br>best interest of the child the courts<br>were still pretty much operating on this<br>idea of following these sort of<br>rules or principles that had grown up<br>over time<br>but we get to the beginning of the 20th<br>century and we get the start of the<br>discipline of psychology<br>which has enormous influence and still<br>does actually because suddenly this<br>concept of children's attachments became<br>important which parent or how our<br>children attached to each of the<br>appearance<br>and<br>um that really started to give judges a<br>lot more scope in relation to how they<br>might be determining the outcome of<br>disputes between parents and Guardians<br>because they weren't Bound by rules they<br>now had to implement the welfare and<br>best interests of the child they had<br>psychological expert evidence to do that<br>and indeed our section 4 of the care of<br>children act talks about a child in his<br>or her particular circumstances so back<br>to that very individualized approach<br>that I mentioned in relation to<br>relocation but I just want to make the<br>point that rules do remain important in<br>some areas so equal sharing<br>International child objection a rule of<br>return<br>and in the child support area but<br>there's always caveats and exceptions<br>out of that if there's going to be an<br>unjust or an unsafe outcome resulting<br>finally reflecting social change I think<br>family law times we struggle to keep up<br>with the pace of social change<br>but we've certainly moved hugely when<br>you think over the last couple of<br>centuries away from Marriage being the<br>important parental status children's<br>legitimacy it was 1969 when we got rid<br>of illegitimacy from our law<br>and the notion of Father Supreme rights<br>so there's a constant tension with<br>trying to respond to evolving<br>demographic and social trends and I'll<br>just put a couple of examples there<br>um in 2005 we introduced civil unions<br>and in 2013 same-sex marriage so you can<br>see the shift in responsiveness to the<br>different types of relationships that<br>are now occurring in New Zealand<br>challenging circumstances make it very<br>difficult for the court because you know<br>separation violence poverty mental<br>health issues substance are used<br>particularly meth is leading to more<br>frequent and complex engagement and I<br>just want to note here too the<br>importance of the impact of colonization<br>and the iniquities that they have<br>occurred for Maori and the family law<br>space because<br>you know children under the a Maori<br>children under the age of 18 account for<br>25 of our population but thus 68 of the<br>children in out of home state care so<br>we've got a long way to go the oranga<br>tamariki ACT has made great strides in<br>trying to recognize the importance of<br>cultural connectedness and tikanga<br>um but I think other family law statutes<br>would benefit from some close scrutiny<br>in those regards as well and then of<br>course our international law obligations<br>the U.N conventions the hay conventions<br>that we're party to are really important<br>that we're reflecting um in our law<br>so<br>I want to thank my parents<br>Colleen and Forbes Taylor<br>um grew up on a farm at a place called<br>window whistle in the<br>rakaia Gorge a very small country school<br>and they were always incredibly<br>supportive of the importance of<br>education and the in my and my brother's<br>life<br>my husband Mike been mentioned already<br>running here the Queenstown marathon and<br>then just completing with my two<br>children the coast to coast earlier this<br>year been a great support my three<br>children Lloyd Alex and Victoria all<br>proud graduates of this University and<br>Roy and I thought you might like that<br>photo<br>keeping my daughter Victoria with her<br>law degree about five years ago and as<br>Shelly has mentioned my son Lloyd also a<br>law graduate from this faculty<br>my granddaughter the baby that you see<br>we saw on the original IPL photograph<br>her mum Hannah so Amelia was now two<br>years old and a great source of delight<br>in my life<br>I'd also like to thank my research<br>funders Richard alluded to the fact that<br>I have had a lot of Grants over the<br>years and I've always been incredibly<br>grateful particularly to the New Zealand<br>law foundation and the Michael and<br>Suzanne Boren Foundation who have given<br>me or given the center numerous grants<br>I'd also like to particularly note the<br>Alexander McMillan trust because it was<br>their generous donation matched by<br>Government funding that created the<br>leading thinker chair that I'm<br>privileged to occupy and that's managed<br>capably through the otago University<br>Foundation trust and having the freedom<br>to have that income has really benefited<br>my research career hugely and I'm<br>enormously grateful to the Alexander<br>I also wish to pay tribute to the<br>research colleagues and of you know the<br>participants in my studies as you've<br>seen I've done a lot of<br>interdisciplinary and socio-legal<br>research often in teams with with key<br>advisors from the profession<br>and that's been a really great way of<br>getting a much more rounded and balanced<br>view I think of the issues that are at<br>play in family law matters<br>my students<br>phds llms mbhls Mas postgraduate diploma<br>and child-centered practice and<br>postgraduate certificate and children's<br>issues have been a great source of joy<br>to me over many years I think it was<br>Shelley that mentioned that many of them<br>are actually very experienced in senior<br>practitioners in the Family Justice<br>field in New Zealand and if I can<br>encourage any of you more in the<br>audience tonight to come and do a PhD<br>I'd love to talk to you but you know<br>it's a great way that they've been able<br>to take that scholarship back into their<br>practice<br>um and you know really do some great<br>work because I've got such a wealth of<br>experience behind them at the point that<br>they come to us here at the University<br>my family law students 180 of them this<br>year who are a great Delight to teach<br>and I just also want to note Anita Chen<br>KC here Anita has been a great friend of<br>the family law program here at otago not<br>just in my time but in Mark hennigan's<br>time as well and she's actually our<br>guest speaker at Thursday's lecture so<br>thank you Anita for all that you bring<br>to the class as well<br>and then just the Family Justice<br>professionals the oh must be thousands<br>of parents caregivers family and whanau<br>members children and young people that<br>Megan and I have talked to over a couple<br>of decades<br>um honestly our research would not be<br>where it is if it wasn't for the<br>generosity in contributing in answering<br>our deep and meaningful questions when<br>we either do it online or come and see<br>them in the sanctity of their homes<br>I just want to conclude tonight<br>um in the 150th year of the faculty by<br>noting our history and family law here<br>in the faculty<br>prior to the 1960s family law as I<br>understand it was primarily taught in<br>relation to other subjects so it wasn't<br>a standalone paper on its own<br>but from the 1960s and 70s we had people<br>like Alan Holden see Bruce Robertson who<br>many of you will know he was here at the<br>reunion three weeks ago and just a note<br>too that Bruce was the first independent<br>chair of the children's issue Center<br>Advisory board so we've had a very<br>long-standing relationship with the<br>Injustice Bruce Robertson now sir Bruce<br>Robertson and he retains a strong<br>interest in the center as indeed he does<br>in the faculty and then in Muir who<br>sadly passed away a couple of years ago<br>in London<br>and then we hit<br>um that very lengthy nearly 40-year era<br>of Professor Mark kinnegan who I think<br>really put Family Law at otago on the<br>map it's a very popular subject at otago<br>and I'm sure that has a lot to do with<br>Mark's refreshing and enthusiastic<br>approach to All Things family law<br>so I would just like to say how very<br>proud I am to add my name to that list<br>of imminent people<br>and to be the current family law<br>professor at the University of otago<br>so namahnui thank you very much and I'll<br>leave you with us to reflect on thank<br>you<br>um it's normally my great pleasure is is<br>the PVC of the division in which the<br>faculty of law sits to give a vote of<br>thanks and a few comments but I have the<br>great pleasure tonight of passing that<br>over to Anita Chan Casey who's already<br>been introduced so I won't spend a long<br>time I'm introducing her but just to say<br>um to thank you to you Anita for the<br>friend that you out at the faculty and<br>for the great support you are to ask and<br>particularly to Nikki um just to let you<br>know we are a little bit a little behind<br>times just to give you a sense of what's<br>coming she's going to speak for about<br>four or five minutes and then I'm going<br>to get back up present Nikki with a gift<br>and give her a final thanks and then<br>invite all of you to join us for<br>Refreshments at the staff Club so hold<br>on we're almost there and it's well<br>worth it right<br>juice<br>I'm very pleased to have this<br>opportunity to acknowledge on behalf of<br>the family law bar<br>the enormous contribution that Professor<br>Nikki Taylor has made to the development<br>of family law here in aotearoa and also<br>internationally<br>Nikki is so modest that it has taken me<br>until tonight to properly appreciate the<br>breadth and depth of the work that she<br>um it's left me quite envious I'm<br>hearing her lecture tonight's left me<br>quite envious of all of the<br>international travel that she has been<br>I've been very excited about tonight's<br>about Nikki's IPL tonight and took the<br>opportunity to color coordinate my<br>outfit with hers in honor of her address<br>as you heard from Nikki historically<br>family law<br>was driven by the application of rules<br>which we now consider to be crude and<br>archaic<br>at the time this law faculty was<br>established in 1959 family law did not<br>exist as a distinct subject in the law<br>degree<br>divorce at that time would only be<br>granted upon proof of wrongdoing such as<br>desertion<br>habitual drunkenness<br>imprisonment of more than five years for<br>violence against a child of the marriage<br>and non-compliance with an order<br>requiring the restitution of conjugal<br>rights<br>what a long way we've come<br>as Nikki has explained far greater<br>recognition is now given by the law to<br>the special dynamics that exist in<br>family relationships<br>one of the most significant advances in<br>Modern Family Law has been as Nikki has<br>explained the statutory recognition that<br>the welfare and best interests of the<br>child is the first and Paramount<br>consideration<br>the best interests of the child or<br>children's rights have been at the heart<br>of Nikki's work<br>Nikki's contribution to this area of the<br>law is magnified by the fact that not<br>only a sheer first-class legal academic<br>but she is also an internationally<br>recognized researcher on family law<br>issues<br>it is due in no small part to Nikki's<br>work and to the work of the colleagues<br>that she has mentioned that lawmakers<br>and all professionals involved in the<br>dispensation of Family Justice<br>are able to draw upon a rich resource of<br>research on the effects on children of<br>it is because of Nikki's research<br>that we know for instance that children<br>from separated families don't just want<br>to have a voice they want to participate<br>authentically in decisions on matters<br>affecting them<br>more than that there are intrinsic<br>benefits for the children and their<br>families<br>of them participating authentically<br>authentic child participation as Nikki<br>found in her studies requires adults<br>including Family Justice professionals<br>to have the ability<br>to engage effectively with children<br>provide information<br>Aid understanding of the family<br>situation and or their parents dispute<br>scaffold the expression of their views<br>and explain the implications of the<br>decision ultimately made<br>in my own experience as a lawyer acting<br>for children I have found children to be<br>articulate and insightful commentators<br>on their lives<br>almost all of the children I've<br>represented appreciate that having a<br>voice does not is not the same as having<br>as a family law profession we are<br>indebted to Nikki for the work that she<br>has done and continues to do in<br>championing the rights of children in<br>please Nikki please accept our warmest<br>and most enthusiastic congratulations on<br>so let me just find my big goodies<br>um so Nikki Taylor<br>um<br>thank you for the work you're doing<br>thank you for the way in which your work<br>has impact in so

to do and be and you have<br>embodied that so well in your research<br>so Bravo thank you thank you for<br>choosing otago and for staying with us<br>and we hope to benefit from your<br>research for as
