When the COVID-19 pandemic struck, the shift to online teaching and learning accelerated, compelling us to reassess the role of traditional lecture-based education. In this new era, students' motivations for attending classes have shifted, and as educators, we must adapt accordingly. Let's explore how we can navigate this dynamic environment, tailor our teaching methods to fulfil students' learning needs, and foster greater engagement.<br><br>Meet the Panel:

May calcororo<br>do students really need to come to class<br>are the behavior<br>changes in the behaviors of students<br>that we've witnessed in particularly in<br>the last few years<br>really<br>something to be concerned about are they<br>good behaviors are they bad behaviors or<br>don't we really need to be bothered<br>these are the sorts of things we're<br>going to talk about today well at least<br>the panel is so let's get let's get<br>going and I'd like to throw over to the<br>Sylvia Robertson Toko lingua<br>my background is in primary education<br>and so I guess I've always been really<br>focused on student engagement I teach<br>two large Education First Year papers<br>here at the College of Education as well<br>as a mixture of third years and some<br>post-grads by distance<br>looking back when I started teaching was<br>a Blackboard and chalk if someone had<br>said to me you're going to be teaching<br>300 students from your Lounge room on a<br>tiny from a tiny device called a<br>computer<br>I would have been gobsmacked I would<br>have thought this is just pure science<br>fiction but it happened and when it<br>happened something a little bit magical<br>happened as well and so I'm hoping we<br>can share some of those things with you<br>today<br>so I work in the<br>otago business school in the department<br>of marketing throughout my career I've<br>mainly taught large undergraduate<br>classes of several hundred students and<br>a few postgraduate classes of a dozen or<br>so students so I teach marketing I teach<br>consumer Behavior digital marketing and<br>market research<br>I'm also the director of The Bachelor of<br>Entrepreneurship so I think that's<br>pretty much all I got to say and it will<br>perhaps give a slight secret away I<br>think there's nothing to be worried<br>about<br>um<br>Kiara my name is Sheila skeefe I am a<br>professor in the department of human<br>nutrition<br>I have been teaching mostly face to face<br>for a long time at basically all the<br>different levels first year second year<br>third year and postgraduate both in<br>large lecture theaters as well as in<br>Practical or tutorial sessions mostly<br>been face to face but I also have<br>experience with distance learning as<br>well so yeah I think it's interesting<br>it's really worked well I think for some<br>of the students and for myself but it<br>things have changed and I think we do<br>greetings everyone my name is I'm a<br>lecturer at the higher education<br>development center and I'm based at the<br>Wellington Medical School in Wellington<br>and it's good to be here with you having<br>so John<br>you've tempted us with something that<br>might be a little bit controversial you<br>say that there's nothing to be worried<br>about<br>shall I perhaps you could get the ball<br>rolling by sharing a few of your<br>thoughts there sure and I must say this<br>position is not very popular in my own<br>Department I'm definitely in the<br>minority so what we've seen is I'm sure<br>probably the reason why most of our<br>viewer here is even pre-covert we've<br>seen lecture attendance plummet I would<br>say not uncommon to hear from my<br>colleagues I just gave a lecture to a<br>class that has 260 odd students enrolled<br>there were 12 people in the room so this<br>seems like a crisis to a lot of people<br>I take probably a overly functional view<br>although I like to think of it as a<br>student-focused view I say what are we<br>here for what are students here for<br>students here to learn we're here to<br>facilitate that learning<br>and the market has spoken<br>the Pass rates average grades haven't<br>really changed much over that period<br>that the lecture attendance has been<br>falling so that's a kind of a blunt<br>instrument it says nothing about the<br>experience that students and teachers<br>have<br>but I try to think about things at first<br>principles are we achieving our<br>objectives are students learning they're<br>continuing to learn the continuing to<br>pass<br>uh so perhaps physical attendance at<br>lectures isn't necessary we know that<br>technology has changed it has<br>facilitated asynchronous learning and<br>the quality of learning asynchronous but<br>also synchronous and online uh so if you<br>think how good Skype was about 10 or 15<br>years ago to how good zoom is now there<br>are technological changes but also<br>there's socio demographic changes<br>life is a lot tougher for students now<br>than when I was a student for sure<br>the cost of living is increased<br>excuse me there's anxiety about climate<br>change and future employment and so on<br>and I know that<br>one thing I'd like to say is that 10 or<br>15 years ago when we saw a student with<br>the head on the on the bench and the<br>lecture we think oh they've probably<br>been partying or not nowadays it's more<br>likely they've been working a shift<br>stacking restacking shelves in the<br>supermarket or a hospital shift or<br>something like that so I think for for<br>those reasons<br>it's important to be flexible and open<br>and to respond to the change in<br>realities on the both the technological<br>side and both on on The Human Side<br>so yeah I think that summarizes my<br>position<br>not quite nothing to worry about but I<br>don't see the sky has fallen in or<br>anything dramatic has changed although<br>we still of course as professional<br>Educators need to be sure that we do<br>keep responding to the needs of our<br>students<br>I think one of the things that when<br>we're having discussions about students<br>coming to class that we want to think<br>about is this whole concept of as you<br>say using the tools and for what is<br>student engagement and what does it mean<br>and it you know can be quite difficult<br>to to measure that and to assess that<br>and obviously students coming to class<br>is just one component of it of course we<br>also need to cater to the whole<br>diversity of learning styles that<br>students have which is some people<br>really like coming to class and I just<br>did a very informal survey of the<br>students who are coming to to my class<br>of which which is not everybody that's<br>for certain and I asked them just to let<br>me know on a piece of paper informally<br>Anonymous why were they were coming to<br>class and and for them it was a kind of<br>a almost like a strategy for them to<br>sort of stay in contact with material<br>and engage with material they found that<br>lecture is interesting they didn't seem<br>it was like a form of discipline they<br>didn't always<br>um<br>I feel that they would watch the<br>recorded lecture later in the evening so<br>this meant that they could listen listen<br>on and I also see I like to observe is<br>that often particularly because it's a<br>first year paper where they may not know<br>each other well they start to sit<br>together in groups when they start to<br>make connections with each other and<br>kind of form friendships maybe outside<br>of those in the Halls the residents are<br>flat so I guess I see that as a as a<br>good thing yeah I agree with you there<br>Sheila I did some research in 2021 with<br>a first year cohort<br>and the the opinions were pretty mixed<br>there were some students that saw a real<br>need to come to class and they had been<br>frustrated when they couldn't be there<br>in person<br>um so this was this notion of Academic<br>Press where the attitude to learning is<br>kind of informed by a collective push<br>they talked about how going to the<br>library for example motivated them to<br>study simply because everyone else<br>around them appeared to be doing exactly<br>that<br>but then the flip side of that was we<br>started to blend learning a lot more<br>providing students with lecture<br>recordings and so on and while the<br>numbers in class stayed more or less the<br>same I don't think there was a lot of<br>difference to prior to the pandemic<br>students were able to tell us through<br>our research why they were using these<br>lecture recordings<br>they had talked about how wonderful it<br>was to have flexibility<br>they could study at their time in their<br>own particular self-selected space<br>and another thing that was really<br>important to them was pace and that they<br>could slow things down a little and so<br>even although it's a first year<br>undergrad paper we use discussion boards<br>and for those who are too shy to speak<br>up in class although they still have<br>that workshop class experience<br>they feel they can share their opinions<br>and perspectives and and access the<br>perspectives of others through that<br>Medium as well so it's an exciting time<br>there's lots of different things that we<br>can be bringing together<br>to to work with our students<br>you know I certainly agree with that and<br>I think you know both of you have<br>brought up interesting points some<br>students some students value coming to<br>class some don't we can cater to both of<br>those groups I'm a marketing person so<br>we we segment markets right we think<br>that not everyone wants the same thing<br>and so we have offerings to suit<br>different people so there are there's<br>that I suppose learning style or<br>personality style the need for<br>socializing for example I really like<br>that idea of Academic Press I haven't<br>hadn't heard about that before the value<br>of listening to a professional educator<br>um yes but also I think just coming back<br>to the the change in reality of life so<br>there's people who get value from<br>attending physically attending lectures<br>for self-discipline for socialization<br>but there's also I think a large group<br>of students who it's not as if they<br>always attend or always don't attend<br>life gets in the way we know about xero<br>ol contracts and the debt economy and so<br>on so a lot of them may fully intend to<br>come to a lecture but they get offered a<br>shift that they just can't pass up the<br>money because money money is very tight<br>these days<br>um so yeah I'm certainly not denying the<br>value of in-person attendance not at all<br>and and I think um one of the other<br>things I want to come back to is often<br>when engagement is discussed it's<br>equated with in-person lecture<br>attendance uh I I think the<br>um the relevant concept is engaging with<br>the material<br>um whether it's the textbook or readings<br>or a lecture recording or what have you<br>and so long as students are engaging<br>with the material that's that's the<br>relevant thing again I think of my role<br>as an educator is to facilitate the<br>learning process<br>and we have multi-modal and asynchronous<br>options available for students<br>um Ruth would you like to pitch in at<br>this point<br>yeah the nature of my teaching is<br>slightly different from my colleagues so<br>what I do more is help teachers to teach<br>and help Learners learn so quite often<br>I'm working with one-to-ones walking<br>working with small groups and workshops<br>so I was just thinking back over that<br>these pandemic years about some of the<br>the issues that I've seen and the the<br>really rapid and necessary switch to<br>remote and online and asynchronous<br>learning modes has had you know<br>obviously it's a very mixed bag they're<br>a real strong positives in terms of you<br>know flexibility and convenience and<br>autonomy and it works practically and as<br>John is saying for people who have very<br>busy and increasingly complex lives<br>which all of our students do but I also<br>do feel a couple of points of tension<br>which I've been thinking about over the<br>last couple of years and one of them<br>centers around the idea that when we do<br>that switch to remote and autonomous<br>learning we are maybe uncovering some<br>skill gaps and maybe there are some<br>assumptions about the skill sets that<br>our students do and don't possess so to<br>be able to successfully transition from<br>directed and classroom learning to<br>self-directed autonomous and online or<br>remote learning is actually quite a feat<br>and I feel that it's really important<br>that we keep reminding ourselves not all<br>students possess the skills readily<br>particularly our younger students or<br>that transition between the synchronous<br>and real-time<br>immediate experience of the classroom to<br>the self-directed classroom so when we<br>do the shift the self-directed learning<br>there are particular skill sets that I<br>believe are necessary and we're talking<br>here digital literacy<br>information that to see critical<br>literacy and then there's a whole<br>package of other skill sets around<br>self-direction<br>self-management and all of these they<br>and so for me I think the the important<br>role of of us as Educators is not just<br>the development of content but it's also<br>providing intentional opportunities<br>um really explicit<br>guidance and coaching around academic<br>skills and academic literacies<br>development to support this rapid<br>um transition back and forth now between<br>the classroom and the online classroom<br>absolutely agree with that Ruth and they<br>they<br>um I think the the pandemic has really<br>highlighted that for us we can see the<br>the inequity that's out there uh with<br>our first year intake coming in in<br>particular a broad range of experiences<br>at the school level and then from<br>students who started University in 2020<br>hoping to navigate their first year with<br>a mobile phone and a borrowed use of of<br>the computer in the library to students<br>who arrived fully equipped set up ready<br>to go a huge difference and then once<br>you put that technology into the<br>students hands it's still not Equitable<br>because they need time to come up to<br>speed and learn how to use it so this is<br>something that we really need to think<br>of it comes back to that basic idea of<br>knowing your students so that you can<br>yeah this is that's an interesting point<br>something that we haven't discussed<br>really we've had a few discussions in<br>preparing for today and um<br>just thinking of how we set up our<br>papers and organize the content and what<br>we're teaching them we often don't<br>factor in those those kind of learnings<br>although I know the university is making<br>efforts to do that with with the<br>students who are coming first year<br>students but that is a significant<br>Challenge and I think the Challenge from<br>going from often from a universe from a<br>high school setting to a university<br>setting is is very different and one of<br>the things we talked about is you know<br>at the University currently we do 10<br>particularly in our first year papers to<br>have these kind of large lecture<br>theaters<br>where that's the style that we've been<br>teaching that's the way you that's what<br>we're set up for at the moment<br>and as much as I have gotten used to it<br>not everybody is used to that and maybe<br>Ruth can pitch in and tell us about her<br>son's a view of a lecture theater but it<br>is difficult in that situation because<br>just the very nature of it is you are at<br>the front separated it goes up the whole<br>kind of space is is almost counter to<br>creating that fostering that student<br>engagements you have to really work hot<br>you know you want the students to come<br>closer I want them to come closer I<br>prefer the more intimate lecture<br>theaters but then you get something big<br>and they're all at the back and then<br>when you've got less and less students<br>coming it's even more empty so it's just<br>becoming it just becomes quite<br>challenging and to think of how the<br>university can move<br>from a lot of those spaces that we<br>currently have at the University to<br>other kinds of spaces where we can<br>foster better student engagement that<br>that will require require quite a lot of<br>creative thinking I'm wondering Ruth if<br>you want to if you wanted to tell us<br>what<br>um what your son thought about going<br>into a into a lecture theater<br>yes recently my son went to a local<br>University for their open day and he<br>came back just really buzzing really<br>excited his year 13 and he was very<br>excited about all of the different<br>things he'd heard in the scene but then<br>his face fell when he described his<br>experience of going into a for real<br>lecture theater and he was actually<br>really horrified by the experience or<br>that the setup the physical nature of<br>the room the windowless nature of the<br>room the the arrangements of seating how<br>it prohibited you know freedom of<br>movement and comfort and socialization<br>and social learning aspects it had<br>become really important to him and had<br>been a part of his high school<br>experience and I think this really leads<br>to one of the other concerns that I have<br>that we we need to really keep bearing<br>in mind that for certain populations and<br>of students such as Pacific there's a<br>really Central concept that's at the<br>heart of effective learning and teaching<br>and that is relationality and so as<br>we're making these moves to more<br>independent and autonomous as we're<br>increasingly not being physically<br>together in classrooms I feel that it's<br>necessary for us to be even more mindful<br>even more intentional about how we<br>create the opportunities for good and<br>right<br>professional reciprocal<br>relationships that Foster learning for<br>Pacific for indigenous and for many<br>other students in the different forms of<br>learning that we are taking whether they<br>be classroom online that kind of thing<br>so we miss out a lot when we go out of<br>the classrooms we miss out on a lot of<br>things that it's known that Pacific and<br>other indigenous groups pick up on such<br>as non-verbal communication which<br>happens really strongly in restrooms and<br>if you're from an oral oral culture<br>Collective culture it's um ingrained<br>within you to be learning actively not<br>just through what people say but also<br>through the non-verbals that are<br>occurring so when we extract learning<br>from these normal social life situations<br>we still need to be thinking about how<br>are our students picking up on those<br>cues how are they picking up on those<br>signals how are they understanding the<br>social dynamics of this place and<br>importantly how are we making sure that<br>our hybrid and our online and our<br>distance and remote learning experiences<br>are culturally safe and culturally<br>inclusive and are relevant to these<br>groups because all of these things<br>they're key to interest and engagement<br>and then physical signs of Engagement<br>such as behavioral engagement and I.E<br>attendance<br>I'm really glad that you've raised these<br>these issues and I think perhaps at this<br>point it's<br>the time to remind ourselves of<br>something we already know but tend to<br>forget<br>lectures are a logistical compromise<br>they only arose for historical reasons<br>because no one had books<br>and in the Gutenberg took care of that<br>we still only do large lectures for<br>logistical reasons it's just the most<br>efficient way to transmit knowledge<br>facilitate learning and what have you<br>and ideally we would love to I'm in my<br>department for a number of years we've<br>considered doing away with lectures just<br>pre-recording lectures and then putting<br>all our resources into small group<br>teaching into tutorials but then once<br>we've actually worked through the crunch<br>the numbers of<br>how we would resource that it became<br>apparent that there's just no way we<br>could<br>so yeah again just reminding us that<br>what we regard as the sort of bread and<br>butter or Mainstay of University<br>teaching once you start thinking about<br>no I think that sometimes<br>I love to go to a good lecture you love<br>today not all the time maybe not all the<br>time three times a week for 13 weeks is<br>maybe a bit much but sometimes I think<br>lectures can be good I just think that<br>maybe we have an over Reliance on we've<br>had an over-reliance on that mode of<br>learning possibly I think yeah a mix we<br>we now have the options to mix<br>and and I don't mean mixing between<br>papers as in having a distance learning<br>paper or a fully face to face but mixing<br>within papers giving students a bit more<br>Choice a bit more flexibility<br>finding something that's going to push<br>everybody's buttons but Ruth you<br>mentioned before about the importance of<br>relationality and and I absolutely agree<br>no matter what we do we've got to try<br>and bring this back to creating a sense<br>of belonging so that our students feel<br>that they are engaged in a community<br>that actually cares about them we've<br>talked a lot about pastoral care in the<br>last two or three years and most of us<br>would agree I think that especially well<br>with all classes the levels of of<br>pastoral care have increased and I<br>thought well that's that's interesting<br>what do we actually mean by pastoral<br>care and I guess what we really mean by<br>that is that we're building these strong<br>relay relationships with our students<br>we're building relationships with<br>learning so we're helping them in terms<br>of their development whether it be their<br>relationship with learning with<br>themselves or with others or with what<br>we're trying to deliver to them the<br>curriculum and we laughed the other day<br>didn't we we were talking about<br>um<br>how do we see ourselves in this space<br>how what's our role traditionally the<br>university lecture has probably been the<br>sage on the stage but now we're thinking<br>actually there's a shift here and it's<br>it's coming from that consumer Focus the<br>students see themselves as consumers but<br>we now might tend to visualize ourselves<br>more as a as a guide by the side rather<br>than a sage on the stage so it's a shift<br>can I just ask<br>um<br>how does<br>that pastoral care how is it enacted<br>what are the practical things that you<br>do you mentioned earlier Sylvia about<br>Academic Press that almost peer well you<br>know we're all part of this and we when<br>you're remote when you are quite having<br>to be quite independent because you're<br>not part of a physical class in the<br>sense that you can't get to class or<br>or there's a changing situation there<br>and how do you actually make it happen<br>to engage the students or create a<br>situation where the student feel like<br>they're part of something when they are<br>actually physically not part of<br>something I think this is where I come<br>I'd come back to that idea of mixing<br>again<br>for the last three years I've been<br>teaching a small group fully online as<br>part of our educ 101 and 102 papers with<br>students from all over the world<br>including inner Mongolia and Spain and<br>various different places and I think<br>these students felt they belonged to a<br>part of a much bigger cohort because<br>there was a much bigger cohort<br>and they could engage with that cohort<br>through discussion boards they had their<br>own separate classes obviously because<br>of the time differences but but they<br>could still be a part of something that<br>was bigger<br>and so giving giving the students<br>opportunities to connect in a number of<br>different ways rather than just the<br>traditional go to a lecture or sit in a<br>workshop with a group of people that you<br>maybe don't really connect with<br>we've got to try and find some more<br>options to enhance that sense of<br>belonging yeah I agree but very<br>difficult fully fully distance yeah<br>one thing I've noted we've noted is um<br>that there's particularly with<br>first-year students but you know that<br>we're able to connect more with those<br>students through there's Halls of<br>residence or sending them individual<br>emails even the use of text now global<br>text messages to connect them following<br>through so there's seems to be<br>encouragement in some ways to make sure<br>that you can maybe identify students who<br>are at risk and try to offer them more<br>support sessions<br>saying that you know I I think what Ruth<br>said isn't very important the skills of<br>the students themselves to be able to<br>engage in those behaviors is something<br>that perhaps we do need to address<br>because as you say not everybody<br>people people don't I think it seems the<br>systems are not always very clear I<br>think to people there's a lot of systems<br>I mean I have trouble negotiating some<br>of the systems and so I think for some<br>of our students they'd be quite<br>overwhelming to negotiate all those<br>systems and you know when they post<br>something who gets to see it is it<br>everybody that gets to see it or is it<br>just a group you know could it be<br>anonymous I mean it's just there's just<br>a lot of things<br>um happening really and yes we do offer<br>those<br>but you know they work for some some<br>they don't that's right yeah<br>I agree that there needs to be a<br>combination of both what we're doing<br>ourselves as educated Educators and in<br>the environments that we create but yes<br>a lot of the work that I do is what<br>you're describing sure that's the work<br>that you're doing one-on-one with<br>students particularly as I've said are<br>younger but often I'll return to to<br>study students and these are experienced<br>mature professionals who are coming back<br>for postgraduate study uh in what is in<br>an increasingly different and<br>bewildering uh tertiary experience<br>compared to what it was for them when<br>they did their first degree and maybe up<br>to you know 10 15 years ago so these<br>internal qualities and characteristics<br>and resilience as well as player order<br>self-managing thinking skills executive<br>functioning skills self-management and<br>self-regulation self-motivation but<br>these are all things that I'm working<br>with I'm with students on on often a<br>one-to-one basis they're a definite need<br>I believe yes<br>I also think that one of the issues that<br>we need to think about too is that when<br>we're talking about pastoral care is<br>that when you're engaging with students<br>anybody of course it takes time to build<br>a relationship and to some extent the<br>way we again the way we structure things<br>is that you know you take a paper for a<br>semester and then you're on to another<br>paper so you know you do need time<br>because I think for many students you<br>know building trust is part of it and<br>that's why I guess the one-on-one the<br>contact whether that's in a in a zoom<br>sessions a little bit more difficult in<br>that session or face to face can help<br>with that but it does take some time and<br>often we have these half semester these<br>half year papers and then on to the next<br>so that adds another kind of a layer<br>onto onto it and so you do want to have<br>connections I think in places where<br>students can go where there's some<br>continuity I guess is what I'm thinking<br>um<br>where does the responsibility lie for<br>ensuring all of<br>all of these things come together<br>I mean<br>on Whose shoulders or is that a is that<br>a silly question even to ask<br>what what silly but I'm not sure we can<br>say the answer no no no it's just<br>contemplating I I guess it's it's just<br>in your own practice<br>um how do you manage pulling all of<br>those things together and<br>um and thinking I'm working with all the<br>various Dynamics the individual students<br>the group of students yourself your<br>department and all of those things that<br>um all those imperatives as well as the<br>paper itself and all the the things that<br>you know need to happen<br>do you make sense of it all rather a lot<br>of checklists it's a speech<br>um but yeah that's a it's a very<br>difficult question and I think it's it's<br>something that we've we can find in the<br>in the research from overseas that um<br>that's moving students towards a more<br>technology heavy if you like way of of<br>studying actually can be incredibly<br>expensive for universities because<br>there's a real need to provide<br>upskilling to staff which then also<br>requires time for them to upskill<br>and and having absolutely outstanding<br>technology I know we've got a great team<br>out the back there at the moment making<br>sure all this is happening so that that<br>sort of thing is is just really really<br>important if we are going to take this<br>giant ginormous leap in into the future<br>and and I think we we can see that we<br>need to we've got the pressure coming<br>and each year as I've watched the last<br>three years of very different cohort of<br>students coming through and they are<br>coming with some amazing skills and we<br>ignore those at our Peril you know they<br>are now a lot more in engaged in being<br>able to use these different types of<br>Technology they've come through a<br>curriculum that has given them much more<br>agency in their learning and so how do<br>we build on those skills and so that we<br>can make them help them to feel that<br>they really belong yeah<br>mm-hmm<br>yeah there's all I want to come back to<br>something uh Ruth's covet so one of the<br>sort of traps of lecture recordings for<br>example<br>um if they're all available on<br>blackboard and you can do them anything<br>if you can do something anytime you'd<br>never do it right<br>so I think one of the things that yeah<br>Ruth I'm pretty sure was covering that<br>that idea of self-regulation and how do<br>we facilitate that so for example the<br>course that I have sold charge over<br>um<br>by building<br>weekly tests on blackboard and I've<br>always asked my students in fact<br>fortnightly tests sorry and I've always<br>been worried about over assessing my<br>students and I ask them every year I say<br>do we do I give you too much assessment<br>and almost<br>almost all of them say that's great it<br>helps us sort of keep on task so that's<br>a I think a concrete step that you can<br>take each test is only worth like two<br>percent<br>um and that seems to have big benefits<br>for them to keep engaged and in the<br>material engaged in the material<br>um and uh you can definitely see that in<br>the um in the assessment for sure but<br>I'm curious about<br>um so that's I'm a simple-minded sort of<br>a person<br>um but I'm curious about what other<br>things that we could do to um build that<br>self-directed learning those those<br>cognitive and self-regulatory skills<br>um and so I think I'd love to hear from<br>I don't want to put you on the spot but<br>I'd love to hear from both Ruth and<br>yeah<br>the journey towards self-directed<br>learning is an intensely and personal<br>and individual one which is why I take<br>quite a lot from a coaching approach I'm<br>working with particular students and<br>it's very much about<br>um engaging through just coming<br>alongside them in a form of allyship<br>really finding out where they are where<br>they need to be according to the<br>expectations of their course and then<br>systematically just being um a<br>cheerleader and critic and a sounding<br>board and all of these kinds of things<br>but I have the luxury of that and the<br>nature of my role the one-to-one<br>consultations there may be other ways<br>that this can be done in a more<br>collaborative sense but for me it comes<br>down to often helping people to find the<br>balance between internal motivation and<br>external motivation so that<br>self-regulation is tied so closely to<br>motivation and that's one of the things<br>that we work on a lot with students<br>trying to find that inner locus of<br>control and motivation that gets them up<br>in the morning that gets them doing<br>routines in the absence of say for<br>instance the routine of going to class<br>how do you then get yourself up motivate<br>yourself to learn identify your learning<br>goals go about the activities use<br>appropriate strategies to achieve those<br>goals and then self-monitor am I<br>achieving my goals how am I achieving my<br>goals and so there's a whole set of of<br>skills within skills related to<br>self-management and self-direct learning<br>and I think that some students really do<br>benefit from<br>in the direct and explicit development<br>of these<br>I agree with you there very soon I think<br>that's something I struggle with with<br>really large classes how do you actually<br>do that when you can't get alongside<br>each and every student but we but we do<br>have some strategies and I Blackboard<br>has become my friend<br>I every week I put up a little learning<br>guide for these first-year students so<br>they don't have to look at it but if<br>they look at it they can then choose to<br>follow the steps for the week a little<br>check-in as to what what you should be<br>doing and then the other thing that we<br>haven't mentioned today that we've got<br>to put a really strong plug-in for is<br>our wonderful tutors who do an amazing<br>job of working with students directly<br>acting as a sort of a go-between<br>sometimes if you like between the<br>students and and ourselves so that we<br>can be aware of what's happening with<br>individuals and roll out extra support<br>when it's needed so our tutors are I<br>think sometimes an undervalued aspect of<br>our yeah of our of our staff<br>and certainly over the last three years<br>they have really stepped up and provided<br>a lot of a lot of help to students in<br>that way too<br>yeah and even standing back from that<br>even a little further standing back<br>maybe not that's not quite the right<br>thing a lot of the administrative stuff<br>in the position of looking after<br>um uh the back end I guess of uh the<br>work that academics might be doing with<br>students in departments are often also<br>they have their finger on the pulse and<br>um contribute in in many ways to making<br>sure that um those individual students<br>are kept kept in the loop and they're<br>not left behind and we're all pitch in I<br>think people are pitching in all sorts<br>um I don't this is kind of a little bit<br>left field I suppose but listening to<br>you<br>pork<br>um I'm always fascinated by the use of<br>words<br>and in this environment that is rapidly<br>changing we still hold on to words such<br>as lecture class<br>and there are a number of others I can't<br>think of them off their head but often<br>they invoke thoughts of well when I hear<br>the word lecture I immediately think of<br>the traditional lecture with one person<br>many people silence generally all talk<br>from the front but in reality we know<br>that's not the case but we still have<br>these words and there's a tendency to<br>attribute certain meanings to them the<br>word class in the title of today's<br>corridoro class what is a class is it<br>just the cohort of students is it the<br>physical space<br>and when you know we have such a an<br>overlap between the virtual and the<br>physical what does it mean in this in<br>this um new environment I guess<br>any thoughts well I think<br>we were wondering about students coming<br>to class so that can be any any of those<br>that you described it could be the<br>virtual it could be you know a tutorial<br>or a practical session or a lecture but<br>I think even underlying it coming to any<br>of those sessions is actually also<br>because one of the things I think we all<br>agree on in the panel is the importance<br>of having student engagement so<br>regardless of it<br>just the coming is part of the student<br>engagement and I think that is a<br>challenge as well to be honest in any of<br>the spaces<br>um I think what I feel what I value is<br>I would like everybody<br>to come to all of those spaces that we<br>have to be a part of that that would be<br>my ideal<br>I understand there's differences in<br>perspective but I would like to see that<br>would make me feel like there is<br>engagement<br>um yeah and I was also thinking when we<br>were talking about<br>how things shift possibly as we move<br>from<br>first year where we have these kind of<br>traditionally we have had these large<br>lecture theaters but then we might have<br>smaller tutorial groups you know that<br>happen and break the class up just to<br>have a little bit more of that<br>engagement but as students move up the<br>kind of second year classes size tends<br>to get smaller again in third year and<br>then by fourth year we've got even<br>smaller groups but with the changing I<br>feel somewhat with the chain we had a<br>discussion today in my department about<br>this about with the changing with the<br>students particularly with covet and the<br>pandemic that even at at the higher<br>levels at postgraduate the coming to<br>class is still<br>could be problematic regardless that<br>space we've had the same experience in<br>My Little Neck of the Woods for sure<br>right so can I interrupt now please<br>because I think it's probably time for<br>us to take some questions from from our<br>audience whether online or in the room<br>um perhaps people in the room might like<br>a few moments to get their thoughts<br>together but it would be great to hear<br>from you in the meantime we have a<br>question that's come through online<br>um perhaps you've covered a lot of this<br>anyway but let's just bring it together<br>again<br>um Bronwyn from Dunedin on the Dunedin<br>campus asks there are so many ways to<br>engage with students could the panel<br>share some of their particular<br>strategies for engaging actively with<br>students<br>I'm I'm going to have to fess up to say<br>I don't have any particular strategy<br>other than to keep on doing what I've<br>done in the past with small twigs and<br>perhaps that's the root problem right<br>there<br>um uh mainly because I don't see what<br>the problem is in my own little neck of<br>the woods thing things seems to be<br>things seem to be going okay and coming<br>back to your question about what is a<br>class and what electors<br>it seems to me the reason why we're on<br>the stage right now having this<br>conversation is it seems to be the large<br>shift that lecturers are uncomfortable<br>with is plummeting lecture attendance in<br>yes I'll leave it on that so sorry can<br>answer although one through them also<br>don't feel compelled to answer ask a<br>question you can make a statement if you<br>wish<br>so one of the strategies I've always<br>tried to employ which<br>probably seems like a better strategy<br>anyways is I try well it is a strategy<br>that works and I think people think that<br>um yeah maybe it's more effective than<br>it it possibly is is to try to get to<br>know people's names I have felt that to<br>be very useful and and<br>um and to be frank Eve of course I do<br>not know 150 or 300 students names<br>that's that that's some people can do<br>that I know if they're in the past that<br>there have been some lecturers who've<br>been able to do that which I think is<br>phenomenal but even if you know some of<br>the students names there's a connection<br>there with them and I think that kind of<br>creates a kind of sense amongst the<br>other students so that you may not know<br>that oh she knows everybody's name which<br>of course is not true but I just find<br>that really helps and I think I do try<br>to work on that and um yeah that that<br>because people are people and they have<br>a name and you want to know and and so<br>that's one strategy that I have tried to<br>very difficult it was very difficult I<br>look at Kirsten teaching fellow very<br>difficult during covid when people were<br>wearing masks that made it incredibly<br>challenging but usually there's<br>something that can help you with that<br>Ruth do you have do you have any<br>yes it's very similar to Sheila's<br>approach in a one-to-one consultation<br>for instance I've got probably an hour<br>to find out an enormous amount of<br>backstory from people and working with<br>them as individuals and people are<br>people as you said she learned so asking<br>the right kinds of questions showing<br>genuine interest to genuine demonstrated<br>care for people<br>um they usually attempt to respond well<br>it's caring about where they're coming<br>from what's on their mind what are their<br>Ambitions what are they struggling with<br>creating a safe space in which people<br>can feel and key about revealing<br>insecurities and vulnerabilities or lack<br>of skills and then construct quickly and<br>constructively and positively mapping<br>some some steps forward for them that's<br>do we have any questions from<br>studio audience yes this one<br>yeah thank you for all the comments so<br>far panel um I suppose I'm interested<br>clearly there's been a discussion around<br>this idea of moving through and from an<br>old era to a new era and the<br>difficulties uh on the back of that for<br>many students<br>my interest is in what about for you<br>guys you know there's this extra layer<br>now of trying to not just keep up but<br>stay ahead of this given that<br>I could say that you're the architects<br>of what the students are experiencing as<br>you go through these changes so I'll be<br>interested just to hear from each of the<br>panel members about how they're coping<br>and tackling the sort of<br>professional and economic development<br>required to keep up with what's<br>happening in the world<br>good question it's<br>a cure Russell thanks for that um<br>oh everyone's different I find keeping<br>up with the tech not not a problem<br>keeping up with the great ideas of using<br>the tech is something that I really am<br>very interested in which is and in fact<br>is why I'm here right now<br>um and that we know that the world's<br>changing<br>um we and there are lots of bright ideas<br>amongst our colleagues and I think the<br>more that we can interact with<br>colleagues outside of our own little<br>academic silos the better we will be as<br>a as an entire University of learning<br>from each other and I know hcdc tries to<br>facilitate this and succeeds but I think<br>the more we can do the more we can cut<br>it off the better we will be for sure so<br>that's where my focus is at the moment<br>so yeah I absolutely agree with that um<br>I think it's quite hard<br>um to you know we we achieved what we<br>achieved during 2020 when we had to go<br>online so quickly was really quite<br>miraculous you know it shows what we can<br>do yes<br>um when we're under that kind of<br>pressure but we wouldn't want to be<br>under that kind of pressure every day<br>but it is quite difficult to keep up<br>this stay ahead of the game and when I<br>was talking to about before about the<br>cohorts coming through from school<br>who've had very different experiences<br>and how we need to be aware of that and<br>start building and on those strategies<br>that they're coming in with but having<br>good support from it is really important<br>too if we're trying something different<br>and yeah I'm very keen to to learn more<br>and I do think that collaboration<br>between our different little silos would<br>be very helpful in this space more more<br>yeah and if both through Sylvia and<br>Schiller michen Coral students also yes<br>about keeping your finger on that little<br>pulse I I think for myself it is it can<br>be it's a good question<br>um I mean<br>yeah 2020 2020 and 2021 was hard it was<br>a lot for sure I think in our own<br>professional work we have to do that<br>anyways so you know we know that there's<br>been shifts that have been happening so<br>that's happening in our in our<br>workspaces in our research spaces<br>already so we're kind of going with that<br>but I feel like it's it's there's a lot<br>and I I certainly don't feel<br>particularly competent<br>um I'm just kind of just<br>barely holding on sometimes it seems<br>like you know really I mean we can get<br>to grips but there's these programs and<br>these these um there there's a lot there<br>and it just takes a lot of time and we<br>we I think we all I can see people<br>nodding in the audience we don't have<br>the time to kind of invest in these<br>things and there's so many options and<br>there's so much it's kind of it's hard<br>to know which is why you know we would<br>love I would love people say what's the<br>best one or what do you think works well<br>or whatever so that that kind of thing<br>so yes the support from the University<br>and from those who know is really really<br>helpful because there's not always<br>there's just not time to to to to work<br>them all out<br>but we do get a nice little push from<br>our students I think sometimes which is<br>I guess what this whole session's about<br>really<br>um that you know that we feel that<br>pressure from beneath which is wonderful<br>it can lift us<br>um so yeah<br>Ruth do you have any thoughts<br>yes I agree I really have um the the<br>role of conversation uh I've just caught<br>it all with each other talking sharing<br>experiences making sense together of<br>what's happening and how we can chart<br>our way forward and then this Collective<br>work combined with uh internal work<br>which is you know reflective practice<br>and both of these I found a really<br>powerful transformative tools for<br>educators but they require time and so<br>ring fencing time to actually have<br>caught in on to have the sharing of good<br>practice to have this building up of<br>each other<br>um it is probably something we should be<br>we should be deliberately doing going<br>forward<br>great<br>um we have another question online from<br>Anonymous<br>um it's quite a specific thing but leads<br>it links quite nicely to that one do any<br>of you use classroom response systems<br>such as vivox and do you think it is<br>good to a good tool to use if you have<br>used it or the idea of those sorts of<br>Technologies do you think it's<br>I could a good thing to use<br>anybody<br>I considered using it yeah<br>gosh I'm going to sound like a broken<br>whistle I can't it to me it looked like<br>a problem solution and search for a<br>problem<br>I just don't have a in my own little<br>teaching bubble I don't have a need to<br>increase engagement and that sort of<br>interactive way it seems to be working<br>fine at the moment for both myself and<br>for the students so sorry for the boring<br>answer no no<br>I would love to use more of that I think<br>it's great I I and we do do some of<br>those things<br>and within our teaching and I think yeah<br>it can be a very good tool and I think<br>possibly more if you've in a flip<br>situation might be useful to do that but<br>yeah it's just a matter of the time but<br>yeah I I think it's it's yeah has has<br>some real pluses yeah I will say one<br>more thing I am probably because I teach<br>I'm in the marketing world and that's<br>been overtaken by digital tools there's<br>all kinds of tools that have been that<br>were exposed to as teachers both Tech<br>tools and also practices and so on<br>where you can say well we tried it and<br>students liked it we liked it hasn't<br>made any impact on the things that<br>matter on Pass rates on achievement and<br>C Smith and so on<br>I'd like to um<br>stay focused on the I suppose the the<br>student view what are they here to do<br>they want to<br>get through and pass that paper with the<br>maximum maximum amount of enjoyment and<br>minimum amount of pain I suppose<br>and so I'm probably too much on the<br>skepticism so like that until I can see<br>some several emitter analysis of two or<br>two of the positive impact on actual<br>student achievement rather than I really<br>enjoyed this I like to hang back you<br>know the um the word agency was<br>mentioned by you Sylvia and it seems to<br>me that Agency for teachers is also very<br>important to being in a position not<br>only to spend time to reflect on the the<br>use of these specific tools just one<br>component but also to be able to stand<br>back and then ask those questions<br>and then make a decision about<br>which way to go okay<br>um we're getting we're very close to the<br>end now so I think it's probably a good<br>time to wrap up<br>um thank you very much to everybody uh<br>for participating oh we've got one more<br>question have we<br>have we got time for one more question<br>yes there we go yeah yeah okay sorry<br>about that<br>Cura so just thinking about the issue of<br>students not coming to class we're<br>seeing similar patterns of lack of<br>Engagement in other areas so people not<br>going to sporting events people not<br>going to concerts so you know how much<br>of this do you think is actually a<br>societal shift is it really just unique<br>to higher education I don't think it is<br>so<br>um you know I is this just the fact that<br>people can do stuff with the internet<br>from their living room awesome yeah I'm<br>so glad to hear you say that um I don't<br>know if you've heard the news recently<br>young people are drinking alcohol this<br>uh and and binge drinking loose and<br>going to parties this and all that<br>social media and the internet is the um<br>the causal Factor behind that if you<br>believe the researchers and it kind of<br>makes sense so I think I'm really glad<br>to hear you say that okay is to put that<br>in the context of a wider social shifts<br>so thank you very much for bringing that<br>up<br>okay I jumped I jumped the gun before<br>didn't I slightly slightly well does<br>Ruth want to comment on yeah is there<br>just a final comment we've got to we<br>did you want to pitch in there<br>no just to say how valuable um<br>Collective conversations are and just to<br>reinforce what I said before about how<br>um if you know there's been anything<br>raised here that we want to keep on<br>discussing let's keep on discussing it<br>let's make the time for these quarters<br>or they're immensely valuable not just<br>within amongst ourselves but with our<br>students as we have mentioned before<br>listening to each other talking to each<br>other and finding collectively um<br>multiple possible ways forward<br>thing I like to just reiterate that and<br>that's something that we perhaps could<br>do better we do have a wonderful<br>ousa A Student Association which is<br>great and and I can see that there's<br>more kind of interaction happening with<br>ousa but you know again it's just a<br>couple of students so I do think that we<br>we do need to engage more with the<br>students to find out where they're at<br>and thinking and that does again it does<br>take time but I think it will you know<br>focus groups finding out where they're<br>coming I'm not sure that we we could be<br>we could be doing I would like to see<br>more of that and I think that would help<br>to know where they're coming from and<br>what their expectations are when they<br>come here you know what are they<br>expecting you know what is it about<br>coming to you why have they come here<br>even and what is there those kind of<br>things need to be built in now much more<br>so because as you say they were moving<br>to that more consumer shift and they can<br>decide they can decide not to come and<br>that has significant ramifications As We<br>Know<br>what she said times 10.<br>it's just it is it's quite different if<br>things are definitely evolving as we<br>would expect they would things do evolve<br>but yeah yeah and I don't you know to<br>some people consumer is like a dirty<br>word it's commoditizing and<br>commercializing something that really<br>shouldn't be commercialized<br>um why not just say student focused yes<br>we want to be better for our students so<br>we have to know what they want and what<br>their experiences are what their<br>right I think perhaps that is the time<br>to um to wind up now<br>um<br>the um I want to say a big big thank you<br>to our panel for participating in the in<br>the corridor I want to say a big thanks<br>to the studio audience and to those<br>online<br>um we really appreciate your<br>participation<br>we also want to say a massive thanks to<br>the media production team for<br>um looking after us and all the behind<br>the scenes work that goes on that's<br>really hidden it's amazing the amount of<br>work there and finally I'd like to say<br>thank you very much to the committee for<br>the advancement of learning and teaching<br>that's count for sponsoring this<br>corridoro series<br>um just a quick word for the June corido<br>we're going to have a student panel so<br>that should be really cool timing so do<br>look out for the registration<br>advertisement that's coming soon<br>so that's all from us kakitiano see
