and on a day which I think has<br>had quite opened up quite a challenging<br>discussion for the University internally<br>it's an enormous pleasure to welcome not<br>only our University staff but also our<br>external friends<br>distinguished visitors to have a<br>discussion which is of substance is of<br>relevant and I think speaks to the core<br>role of tahirunga Waka as an institution<br>and particularly like to extend warm<br>welcome to a number of the Diplomatic<br>Corps who have come to the university<br>tonight<br>Emeritus Professor Liz Holborn a former<br>Vice Chancellor you certainly might not<br>want to have more than two in a room at<br>a time but we're very pleased that Liz<br>continues to come back<br>uh and also members of council and staff<br>as people will be aware here the sir<br>Howard kippenberger visiting chair in<br>strategic studies honors Major General<br>Sir Howard giffenberger he was in<br>addition to being one of New Zealand's<br>most distinguished soldiers he was also<br>an eminent scholar and a strategist<br>in addition to being president of New<br>Zealand return Services Association he<br>oversaw the production of a significant<br>body of work 23 volumes of New Zealand<br>official War histories<br>and it's in his name that we have the<br>visiting chair in strategic studies and<br>it's in his name that we have this<br>lecture tonight which is again an<br>enormous asset for the University<br>there's nothing else like it across New<br>Zealand across Australia and it has been<br>a venue where we've had some of the very<br>best and most imminent Scholars and<br>international Affairs<br>like many institutions post covered<br>we're now three years past and this is<br>the first time we've had the opportunity<br>to resume it and that makes it an<br>additional pleasure<br>um I'll I'll guess tonight<br>is both imminent and relevant<br>Aleister Ian Johnson is one of the<br>preeminent China Scholars he is the<br>governor James Albert Noe and the Linda<br>Noe Lane professor of China and world<br>affairs at Harvard University he's<br>written on socialization Theory identity<br>and political behavior and strategic<br>culture mostly with a focus on East<br>Asian international relations and again<br>today as we see two of the enormous<br>world powers in both ideological and<br>hopefully not any escalation and<br>conflict beyond that an expert on<br>Chinese China foreign policy there's<br>actually it comes at a time when that<br>conflict is heightening and producing<br>unprecedented attention<br>uh in what we're about to hear<br>Ian's going to explore what's widely<br>regarded is that MO is that relationship<br>and the most important relationship in<br>politics today the interplay between the<br>US and China<br>um<br>and he's also going to look at how these<br>two Powers engage in intense strategic<br>competition what the consequences are<br>for not only the large countries but for<br>small countries such as aotearo and New<br>Zealand I wanted to finish by<br>acknowledging Garfield Western<br>Foundation who are the principal<br>sponsors of the chair the New Zealand<br>Defense Force and Royal New Zealand<br>return Services Association who've also<br>provided support and the Victoria<br>University of Wellington Foundation who<br>managed the fund Professor David Cappy<br>the director of the center of strategic<br>studies and the center for strategic<br>studies staff will be hosting and has<br>continued to host Ian around the country<br>and he will chair the questions and Q a<br>at the end which I'm sure will be even<br>more stimulating than the lecture<br>they're about to hear please join me in<br>welcoming Professor Alistair Ian Johnson<br>well thank you very much for the lovely<br>introduction and I wanted to thank in<br>particular Victoria University<br>and it's Center for strategic studies<br>and the staff involved in the center for<br>strategic studies and for bringing me<br>here Jeanette and Henry and Sue and of<br>course David the director for creating a<br>wonderful opportunity for me to learn<br>about your country to meet your Scholars<br>and officials and students and people<br>foreign<br>so today I want to talk uh about<br>identity race and U.S China relations<br>a quick note before I start that unless<br>otherwise specified when I refer to the<br>United States or Americans or to China<br>and Chinese I'm referring to their top<br>leaders not to the people in general<br>so in mainstream international relations<br>Theory there have been sort of two major<br>models or two major ways of explaining<br>escalating rivalry between great Powers<br>one is that one or both of these states<br>are revisionist states that is they want<br>to fundamentally change the distribution<br>of power and territory and Norms to the<br>advantage of themselves and to the<br>disadvantage of others<br>or the of the Rival one or both of these<br>states therefore engages in coercive<br>Behavior to change this distribution the<br>other resists and the result is an<br>offensive insecurity spiral now one<br>example of course of an insecurity<br>spiral produced by competition between<br>uh between the sort of a revisionist<br>States or aggressive states are the uh<br>colonial wars of the past<br>the other way of explaining uh rivalry<br>is called a security dilemma<br>and here the argument is that states<br>prefer the current distribution of power<br>and territory and Norms in other words<br>they're primarily status quo oriented<br>but they are uncertain that the other is<br>also status quo oriented and uncertainty<br>leads State a for example to arm for<br>prudent and defensive reasons State B is<br>also uncertain about State A's<br>intentions so it interprets State A's<br>defensive actions as potentially<br>threatening so State B responds<br>similarly and you get a defensive spiral<br>of insecurity both would prefer not to<br>get into this rivalry but both worry<br>that the other will take advantage of<br>them<br>now arguably the U.S and China today<br>most decision makers accept the first<br>model uh in in in forms various forms in<br>the United States for example I think<br>decision makers genuine generally<br>believe that China is fundamentally a<br>revisionist state determined to<br>undermine the so-called rules-based<br>order and to eliminate U.S dominance<br>and in China the dominant belief I think<br>amongst decision makers that the United<br>States is fundamentally a hegemonistic<br>state that has consistently threatened<br>the legitimacy of the Communist party<br>and its security and survivability<br>there are fewer people in the United<br>States and in China who use the second<br>model the security dilemma model though<br>I think international relations Scholars<br>generally think it's a good starting<br>point for uh for explaining rivalry<br>I want to propose that both of these<br>models are problematic both of these uh<br>modes of analysis are problematic<br>the first model<br>mischaracterizes key features of the uh<br>of each side's Behavior<br>first I think you can argue contrary to<br>the U.S claim China is not trying to<br>overthrow a U.S dominated rules-based<br>order why because there is no single U.S<br>dominated rules-based order I think you<br>can argue that there are multiple orders<br>in different domains with different<br>norms for example there's a sovereignty<br>limiting order trade order<br>there's a sovereignty diminishing<br>political rights order that focuses on<br>the promotion of civil liberties and<br>individual rights<br>and there is a sovereignty enhancing<br>un-centered order that undergirds the<br>current International<br>Territorial state system among other<br>orders<br>China supports some of these orders it<br>supports very strongly the U.N centered<br>sovereignty-based territoriality order<br>it opposes other orders strongly opposes<br>the political rights order focused on<br>the the uh the spread of uh liberal<br>civil and political liberties<br>and it's moderately supportive<br>moderately opposed to other orders such<br>as the freeish trade order<br>and contrary to beijing's claims after<br>the 1970s the United States has not been<br>out to undermine the Communist Party<br>rule there have been no strategy<br>documents no policy guidance about how<br>to prevent China's rise or to undermine<br>how to undermine the CCP rule recently<br>Declassified documents from the bush II<br>National Security Council confirm this<br>the second model the security dilemma<br>model has problems because it assumes<br>that what generates arms Spirals and<br>insecurity is uncertainty about the<br>other side's intentions<br>but it's clear that the dominant<br>discourses in the United States and in<br>China all are all about certainty not<br>uncertainty in the United States there<br>is no question amongst top decision<br>makers that the rules-based order exists<br>and that China wants to overthrow it<br>and in China there's no question the<br>United States wants to suppress China<br>and undermine the rule of the Communist<br>Party<br>so I hypothesize that the main driver at<br>any enduring U.S China rivalry is not<br>that both are aggressive revisionist<br>States challenging the others vital<br>interests<br>nor is the main driver uncertainty about<br>the other's intentions rather I think or<br>hypothesize that the main driver are<br>incorrect certainly yours incorrect<br>uncertainty about the other's intentions<br>so the critical question is why are both<br>sides so certain yet mostly so wrong<br>about the fundamental intentions of the<br>other side<br>typically the most certain judgments<br>that people make about their own<br>intentions or the intentions of other<br>actors are judgments about identity<br>uh this is a judgments about the traits<br>and characteristics that they have as<br>members of an in-group whether it's a<br>religious in-group or a ideological<br>group or a social group or a an ethnic<br>group or a national group and typically<br>these certain beliefs about self's<br>identity traits stress the group's<br>exceptional virtuousness<br>and also therefore the out groups the<br>others exceptional non-virtuousness<br>so I would hypothesize that incorrect<br>certainty in the U.S China relationship<br>comes largely from judgments about<br>identity<br>how American decision makers understand<br>their traits and characteristics As<br>Americans and how Chinese leaders<br>understand their traits and<br>characteristics as Chinese<br>where are these beliefs about a self's<br>virtuousness and others non-virtuousness<br>come from<br>I think there's three clusters of theory<br>from social psychology so bear with me<br>for a moment as I as I sort of a light<br>on three different clusters of theory<br>from social psych which I think have<br>some bearing on where a certain where<br>one literature is social identity Theory<br>and social identity Theory tells us that<br>people in groups want to maximize their<br>self-esteem as members of a valued<br>in-group groups do this essentially by<br>maximizing the group's sense of its<br>exceptionalism<br>and how do you maximize exceptionalism<br>you minimize perceived differences<br>amongst members of the in-group and you<br>maximize perceived differences between<br>the in-group and the out group The<br>devalued out group<br>so that's one cluster of literature<br>which suggests where uh uh incorrect<br>certainty comes from another literature<br>is about what's known as the<br>introspection illusion<br>introspection illusion shows how<br>self-relies heavily on introspective<br>information namely information about<br>their own thoughts and their own<br>feelings and motives to assess the<br>benign intentions behind their own<br>behavior<br>but it also relies on extrospective<br>information in other words looking at<br>others Behavior conflictual behavior and<br>rather than looking at the introspective<br>information about the other about the<br>others feelings and motives it looks it<br>focuses on the other's Behavior to<br>assess the malign intentions behind<br>others actions<br>so that's one another literature that<br>that is useful and finally there's a<br>literature on dehumanization and<br>infra-humanization<br>uh and the theories behind<br>dehumanization infra-humanization tell<br>us that self's sense of exceptionalism<br>often depends on characterizing other as<br>lacking a complete range of uh complex<br>human traits and cognitions and emotions<br>now this can be done through<br>dehumanization in other words<br>characterizing others in in essentially<br>non-human terms as as animals or making<br>metaphoric with statements about others<br>as animals or as objects<br>or through what's known as<br>infra-humanization which denies the<br>other have as having a full range of<br>characteristics of human characteristics<br>both dehumanization and<br>infra-humanization are associated with<br>more coercive preferences for dealing<br>with out groups<br>so this is Theory uh but there's plenty<br>of survey evidence of experimental<br>evidence historical evidence that the<br>more a group perceives identity<br>difference with other groups the more it<br>is likely to perceive others as threats<br>and therefore to be dealt with<br>coercively<br>so I'll give you a couple of examples of<br>how the U.S and Chinese discourses about<br>each other maximize perceptions of<br>identity difference<br>in the U.S the rules-based order<br>narrative or discourse<br>is not just a description of the<br>International System<br>it also embodies identity claims<br>the claim that there is a single U.S led<br>rules-based order constitutes the United<br>States as a status quo state that has<br>brought peace and prosperity globally to<br>uh since 1945. at the same time the<br>rules-based order constitutes China as a<br>revisionist state<br>and Status Quo states are virtuous they<br>uphold norms and institutions that have<br>kept peace they play by the quote rules<br>of the game<br>revisionist states on the other hand are<br>by definition Challengers to rules<br>they're cheaters they're deceptive<br>they're cunning<br>the only way to deal with cunning<br>deceptive cheaters is hyper vigilance<br>and coercion political or or a military<br>or economic coercion<br>now China has promoted its own uh<br>competing vision of order International<br>order called it's an aspirational order<br>um variously translated as the community<br>of common destiny<br>the community of common Destiny is an<br>inconsistent mix of traditional<br>sovereignty-centric rail politique ideas<br>ideas about economic interdependence<br>Western ideas about comprehensive common<br>and Cooperative security there's nothing<br>particularly new or original to most of<br>the content of this community of common<br>Destiny idea<br>but it does embed an important identity<br>claim<br>Chinese leaders argue that the core of<br>the community of common Destiny are<br>ideas that represent China's inherently<br>peace-loving history and culture<br>summarized by a term that has become<br>increasingly common in China as China<br>having peace genes<br>uh<br>Xi Jinping for example said in in May of<br>2014 the Chinese people's blood does not<br>have the genes for invading others or<br>for seeking Global hegemony<br>now that kind of a statement uh<br>underscores China's benign<br>exceptionalism with peace loving uh<br>nature<br>and it implies or contrasts with U.S<br>malign exceptionalism hegeminism is a uh<br>code word for the United States in<br>Chinese discourse<br>and under Xi Jinping there's been a<br>rapid increase in uh in this<br>essentializing reference to uh the<br>Chinese peace genes this graph simply<br>counts the number of articles that<br>appear in a Chinese Archive of media and<br>academic journals<br>it counts the number of articles that<br>mention the term peace genes and as you<br>can see after Xi Jinping takes over in<br>2013 there's a really steep increase in<br>the references to peace genes again this<br>is a statement about the inherent<br>peacefulness of the Chinese people the<br>cultural uh peacefulness of the Chinese<br>people<br>but like the rules based the US<br>rules-based order the claim of Chinese<br>exceptionalism simply isn't historically<br>true<br>there's plenty of evidence of the use of<br>violence throughout Chinese history to<br>deal with external and internal threats<br>including the use of violence after 1949<br>to deal with internal and external<br>threats so these two two competing<br>visions of order both characterize self<br>as exceptionally benign<br>and characterize other as exceptionally<br>malign<br>and both Visions are very certain about<br>but in addition to the identity<br>difference claims at the heart of the<br>rules-based order and the community of<br>common Destiny uh Concepts there are<br>other claims about identity difference<br>in the U.S China relationship that are<br>potentially more volatile and more<br>destabilizing and these are claims about<br>racialized differences<br>racial stereotypes are by definition<br>certain about self-superiority and<br>others inferiority in other words<br>self-exceptionalism<br>but of course as science has shown these<br>stereotypes about genetic inferiority or<br>about socially inappropriate group<br>traits are scientifically false so<br>racial stereotyping is one of these<br>inaccurate certainties that operates in<br>politics<br>the um we shouldn't be surprised that uh<br>racial stereotyping might matter<br>in the comparative politics field for<br>example in the study of American<br>politics in the United States at least<br>it's standard knowledge that political<br>preferences and behavior are influenced<br>by racial attitudes<br>in international relations the field of<br>international relations post World War<br>II mainstream research generally ignored<br>the issue of racism and racial<br>stereotyping until the last few years<br>but there's Now new research that's<br>coming out on a range of international<br>relations topics that has found that<br>racial perceptions affect policy<br>preferences on questions related to<br>motivations for war<br>um uh obvious example being the second<br>world war and Nazism as a motivation for<br>that conflict there's interesting new<br>research on the design of alliances by<br>hammer and katzestein who argue that<br>based on documents from the 1950s that<br>U.S state Department officials were<br>reluctant to push for complex<br>multilateral Alliance structures in Asia<br>Pacific because they believe that Asians<br>were inferior and not capable of<br>managing complex multilateral<br>relationships unlike the uh the<br>countries in Western Europe and the<br>United States<br>there's new information or a new data<br>that's come out on immigration policy<br>preferences the global distribution of<br>immigration policy preferences that<br>finds<br>that uh countries systematically<br>discriminate against immigration coming<br>from countries that are considered uh uh<br>African black dark<br>this is work by Andrew Rosenberg<br>finally there's work on trade<br>preferences recent work on trade<br>preferences done by mutts Mansfield and<br>Kim<br>which show for example that whites in<br>the United States are less willing to<br>trade with countries that they rate as<br>more black or as dark<br>and that they see relations with these<br>countries in more zero-sum terms<br>so there's no reason to believe that<br>racism and racial resentment doesn't or<br>won't show up in the U.S China rivalry<br>just to be clear this is not this is not<br>an argument that hardliners all<br>hardliners the United States or in China<br>are racists or or work with racial<br>stereotypes<br>but it does recognize that most people<br>who work with racial stereotypes or<br>believe in racial stereotypes tend to be<br>hardliners on foreign policy preferences<br>when it comes to dealing without groups<br>whether they're domestic or<br>International<br>so an important question in the U.S<br>China relationship is how might the<br>racialized stereotypes impact policy<br>making on both sides and what effect<br>might this have on the intensification<br>of the U.S China rivalry<br>so I want to explore how perceptions of<br>identity difference might affect U.S<br>China rivalry by examining which<br>elements of a security dilemma which<br>characteristics of a security dilemma<br>might be especially influenced by<br>perceptions of identity difference<br>now one caveat<br>what follows is what we call in the<br>social sciences a plausibility probe<br>which sounds a bit rude<br>it means it explores the plausibility of<br>an argument before testing the argument<br>against alternative explanations<br>so it's just an effort to see whether<br>there's any plausibility in the kinds of<br>so one of the key characteristics the<br>fundamental characteristic of a security<br>dilemma is interactivity<br>in other words the interactivity in the<br>non-cooperative actions of the two sides<br>each side's non-cooperative behavior is<br>increasingly responding to the other<br>side's non-cooperative Behavior this is<br>a necessary behavioral condition for a<br>security dilemma without interactivity<br>then there is no security dilemma<br>um<br>lots of examples out there of<br>interactivity in the U.S China<br>relationship for example there's the<br>interaction between U.S China military<br>buildup the planning deployment of<br>forces to deal with a possible Taiwan<br>conflict uh the trade War since 2018 uh<br>we clearly demonstrated a tit-for-tat a<br>relationship between the two sides The<br>Diplomatic efforts by each side to<br>undermine the other side's influence in<br>international organizations is also<br>another example of this interactivity<br>and for those who appreciate<br>quantitative data there is a massive<br>data set called the integrated<br>crisis early warning system that<br>basically uses computer algorithms to<br>code on a daily basis cooperative and<br>conflictual statements and actions from<br>one state directed towards another for<br>all states in the International System<br>from the late 1990s on so there's<br>millions and millions of observations of<br>cooperative and non-cooperative daily<br>activities between countries<br>and there's evidence of an increasingly<br>tight interaction between the United<br>States and Chinese signaling with a<br>clear decline in overall levels of<br>Cooperative actions beginning around<br>2016-2017.<br>so there's evidence for interactivity<br>another characteristic of a secure<br>dilemma is that while there is<br>increasing evidence of interactivity<br>there is increasing denial of<br>interactivity between the two sides<br>denying interactivity is another way of<br>saying that the conflict is entirely<br>driven by the other side<br>and here is where the introspection<br>illusion that I refer to has an effect<br>self tends to believe that its behavior<br>is a function of its conscious internal<br>State its benign attitudes<br>self therefore tends to believe that the<br>other side should estimates self's<br>intentions to be benign<br>so if there is conflict it's because<br>other has ignored or or deliberately uh<br>ignored the benign intentions of self<br>therefore self is blameless the<br>escalation in the conflict is due<br>entirely to the obvious malignness of<br>the other side<br>so we see discourses from both sides the<br>United States and China that claim that<br>the other side is inherently the source<br>of instability in the relationship just<br>to give you a couple of examples<br>um in the United States uh the when the<br>term rules-based order first appeared in<br>U.S policy discourse in 2010 if you look<br>at all of the articles in the United<br>States that reference the rules-based<br>order<br>and then look at What proportion of<br>those reference China<br>it's been a pretty constant uh level of<br>uh constant proportion between 70 and 80<br>percent of all the articles that<br>reference rules-based order also<br>reference China the implication being<br>that China is clearly the the source of<br>the problem for the U.S rules-based<br>order that China's challenge is the<br>source of conflict in the U.S China<br>relationship<br>on the Chinese side this simply looks at<br>the frequency of articles in the<br>people's daily which is the Communist<br>Party newspaper<br>the frequency of articles that refer to<br>the term contain China<br>and the frequency of articles that refer<br>to hegeminism which as I mentioned<br>before is a code word for the United<br>States and what you see is basically<br>from uh 2017-2018 uh on there's been a<br>big increase in Chinese media references<br>to American hegeminism and to American<br>efforts to contain China again these are<br>statements about how the conflict the<br>U.S China relationship is solely the<br>function of the United States<br>so these again are examples of of the<br>denial of interactivity uh in in the<br>relationship<br>so that's the second characteristic of a<br>security dilemma third characteristic of<br>a security dilemma is the uh you look<br>for evidence of dehumanization and<br>infra-humanization of the other side<br>now in a rivalry conflict across time<br>provides more information about the<br>other's behavior and its nature this<br>information however is interpreted<br>inaccurately<br>through the prism of dehumanization and<br>infra-humanization<br>basically self increasingly<br>characterizes other as exhibiting<br>certain stereotyped negative traits with<br>allusions to everything from being<br>non-human or non-human traits or images<br>which would be dehumanization but also<br>possibly references to kind of the<br>hyper-competent human characteristics of<br>the other side that makes the threat<br>more effective so that would be for<br>example infra-humanization<br>so for example a couple years ago I was<br>at a conference where I heard<br>a very senior U.S military leader say<br>that the China quote only understands<br>Force so that's in for humanization<br>statement because it is it's it's<br>ignoring or putting aside the<br>possibility that China can also<br>understand Cooperative Outreach for<br>example or cooperative measures<br>immediately after he said the Chinese<br>only understand Force his second in<br>command said yes zebras don't change<br>their stripes that's dehumanization so<br>that's basically saying the reason why<br>the Chinese only respond to force is<br>because they have this this essential<br>characteristic they don't change the<br>stripes they never change the stripes<br>just like zebras don't change their<br>stripes<br>now there are many examples of this<br>phenomenon contemporary U.S China policy<br>discourse I'll give you some examples of<br>infra-humanization one theme is in much<br>of the commentary in the United States<br>is that the Chinese are highly competent<br>but dishonest and cunning so Trump for<br>example blamed the U.S trade deficit on<br>the intelligence and cunning of the<br>Chinese Marco Rubio Center for Marco<br>Rubio from Florida used the hashtag<br>China trickery to talk about the<br>transfer of dual use technology to China<br>uh Senator Marsha Blackburn from<br>Tennessee<br>um<br>tweeted quote China has a 5 000 year<br>history of cheating and stealing some<br>things will never change zebras don't<br>change their stripes<br>um<br>uh what's interesting about that comment<br>is that many of the more hawkish<br>elements in the United States try to<br>make the claim that their their target<br>their adversary is the Communist Party<br>of China it's not the Chinese people<br>that it's the Communist party is the<br>problem the Chinese people the US you<br>know loves wants to have a good<br>relationship with this is clearly not a<br>statement about the Communist Party of<br>China uh it's a statement about five<br>thousand years of of Chinese history<br>so those are examples of<br>um uh infra-humanization<br>uh dehumanization uh another example is<br>the the commander of Southern command<br>General Laura Richardson noted about<br>China the quote we see the tentacles of<br>the PRC in our neighborhood the image of<br>an octopus<br>spreading its tentacles is a pretty<br>common historical meme used to describe<br>a kind of sinister ambitious and<br>manipulative presence<br>uh Bridge Colby who was one of the<br>co-authors of the Trump Administration<br>National defense strategy recently<br>analyzed the Taiwan uh situation by<br>referring to the United States as a man<br>referring to Taiwan as a man and<br>referring to China as a great white<br>shark<br>a common meme also is the dragon as a as<br>a cunning threat<br>and this<br>image is of a kind of bucolic American<br>campus innocent students reading trying<br>to learn get educated but wrapped in the<br>Ivy and the uh the stone columns of this<br>idyllic campus is a Chinese dragon it's<br>unclear whether this is a reference to<br>the theft of stem technology for example<br>or a reference to the penetration of<br>campuses through Confucius institutes<br>but what was interesting about this<br>particular image is that it was issued<br>by the state Department's information<br>arm<br>um<br>now this is not only an American<br>phenomenon uh dehuman dehumanization in<br>for humanization<br>as I noted the implication of Chinese<br>leaders claim the Chinese people are<br>uniquely and inherently peace loving is<br>that Americans are not uniquely or<br>inherently peace loving which is an<br>example of infra-humanization<br>but we also see dehumanization in the<br>prcs anti-American propaganda as well<br>the similar image a familiar image of of<br>uh octopus and tentacles this doesn't<br>look like a a really evil looking<br>octopus although it is supposedly<br>sucking all the resources out of the<br>world<br>um but there are more evil images this<br>is uh the U.S as death bringing domestic<br>violence to the countries around the<br>world posted by the Chinese ambassador<br>to France who if you've been following<br>the recent controversies about the<br>Chinese ambassador to France this seems<br>consistent with many of the things he<br>said<br>um<br>and then another image that comes in the<br>people's basically people's daily<br>Network the official media Outlet of the<br>PRC of the party the characterizes the<br>United States as a devil bringing death<br>and destruction<br>so those are interested dehumanization<br>and infra-humanization are also<br>characteristics of a security uh of a<br>increasingly volatile security dilemma<br>a fourth characteristic is<br>um<br>that we increasingly see a relationship<br>between identity differences in other<br>words beliefs that there are differences<br>between in-group and our group on the<br>one hand and militarize preferences on<br>the other<br>as social identity Theory as I mentioned<br>a moment ago a social identity theory<br>predicts identity differences<br>perceptions of identity in group out<br>group identity differences should be<br>positively correlated with should<br>predict to threat perception and thus<br>should also predict it to coercive<br>preferences for dealing with threats<br>a good example of this social identity<br>Theory prediction actually comes from<br>surveys that I was involved in in China<br>uh in the uh 2000s called The Beijing<br>area study<br>one of the things questions we asked<br>people was uh the Chinese people are<br>respondents was where on a scale<br>anchored by peacefulness and War<br>likeness where would they put Chinese<br>people<br>and overwhelmingly 55 of respondents put<br>Chinese people down at the very peaceful<br>end the most peaceful and the Chinese<br>people are inherently uh peaceful<br>but what's interesting is that people in<br>this column people down here at the most<br>peaceful end of the spectrum were<br>significantly more likely to support<br>increasing military spending and<br>significantly less supportive of trading<br>uh guns for butter<br>and the reason is because people down at<br>this end of the scale were far more<br>likely to put Japanese down at this end<br>of the scale<br>now there was a far more likely to see<br>the Japanese is inherently different<br>from the Chinese in other words they<br>maximize they were basically maximizing<br>the identity difference between Chinese<br>people as inherently Peaceful Japanese<br>people is inherently warlike which meant<br>that they viewed the world as relatively<br>threatening<br>which therefore meant that they were<br>stronger had stronger preferences for<br>more<br>coercive responses to this world such as<br>increasing military spending<br>so this is a great example of how<br>identity difference predicts to a<br>preference for a more military<br>capabilities now we're just beginning to<br>see we're just beginning to find<br>evidence through survey experiments and<br>text analysis<br>an interactive relationship between<br>racially based perceptions of identity<br>difference in the United States and<br>China and preferences for more coercive<br>policies towards each other<br>on the U.S side for example<br>DG Kim and Abner and medicina find that<br>high levels of racial resentment by<br>white Americans directed at Asians or<br>Asian people predicts to a heightened<br>perception of China as a threat in other<br>words the more you believe the more you<br>have Express anti-asia resentment the<br>more likely you are to believe that<br>China is a threat<br>Kim finds that racial resentment also<br>predicts to Greater support for more<br>militarized responses to this threat<br>don't need to worry about the graph but<br>basically all you need to know is that<br>an increase in the y-axis means an<br>increased probability of support for the<br>use of force against China an increase<br>in the x axis is means that you rank<br>higher on the anti-asian resentment<br>scale<br>and as you can see there is a a<br>relationship between the two namely an<br>increase in levels of anti-asian<br>resentment predicts to an increase in<br>the support for the probability of<br>support for the use of force against<br>China<br>uh and uh then Chen and you find that<br>that there's an interactivity between<br>fret perception and racialized views of<br>Chinese in other words the more<br>threatening that whites perceive China<br>to be the more that they rate Chinese<br>people from China as less trustworthy<br>and less moral compared to Chinese<br>Americans or compared to Japanese people<br>these are again based on survey<br>experiments<br>now at the same time uh what we're also<br>beginning to see is more media attention<br>in China to anti-chinese racism in the<br>United States and this this graph just<br>simply shows that um it looks for the<br>the co-appearance of the term United<br>States and racism in Chinese newspapers<br>across time so basically do these terms<br>appear in the same sentence and what you<br>can see is there's pretty much not much<br>discussion in Chinese media about<br>American anti or American racism until<br>21 and 22 and you see this big increase<br>in Chinese media coverage of anti-china<br>um What DJ Kim finds he uses survey<br>experiments in China to show that<br>exposure to this kind of information<br>this increase in coverage of American<br>anti-china or anti-chinese racial<br>resentment that exposure to this<br>information in China in turn increases<br>anti-white resentment<br>which in turn contributes to support for<br>hawkish preferences or hawkish responses<br>to U.S anti-chinese resentment that is<br>there is an increasing interactivity<br>between American and Chinese perceptions<br>of racialized identity difference and<br>this predicts to more coercive<br>preferences among people on both sides<br>so the final uh characteristic of a<br>security dilemma<br>is of an increasingly intense secure<br>dilemma is an increasing policing of the<br>in-group what I mean by policing the<br>in-group<br>basically this means that typically<br>groups believe that when they face<br>increasingly uh dire security threats<br>they tend to police against internal<br>critics who were seen as at a minimum<br>inaccurate or naive and at worst our our<br>tools of the other or agents of the<br>other fifth columnist what have you<br>um there's a brilliant Berkeley<br>Professor uh uh Marika Landau Wells who<br>argues that a particularly powerful way<br>of policing the in-group is to invoke<br>images of contamination as opposed to<br>images of loss like lost economic loss<br>or images of harm you know damage or<br>destruction to your to your country<br>but it's to invoke images of<br>contamination<br>uh and uh the the use of a contamination<br>uh discourse by groups can come in two<br>forms there can be contamination of an<br>in-group's identity<br>from ideological threats Heretics<br>uh Insider threats<br>and there can be also the invocation of<br>biological contamination as evident in<br>the cases of anti-immigrant forces that<br>have claimed particular peoples or<br>vectors for disease<br>the first type of contamination sort of<br>threats to the in-group identity uh<br>threats to its its Unity<br>uh an example of that is that there's<br>been a big jump in the use of the phrase<br>the United States using CCP talking<br>points using Chinese Communist Party<br>talking points as a way of<br>delegitimizing critics of certain<br>aspects of U.S China policy and there's<br>been a jump in the use of that phrase by<br>um in the media and in the think tank<br>and government worlds<br>uh<br>some of this in-group policing can be<br>directed at citizens who happen to be<br>ethnically Chinese<br>uh and and there are three relevant<br>facts here is I'm going to try and tie<br>together<br>first there's some polling that suggests<br>that uh about one-third of Americans<br>believe that Chinese Americans are more<br>loyal to the PRC than they are to the<br>United States<br>second uh there's a large portion of the<br>Republican Party in the United States<br>today that identifies with white<br>nationalist sentiments with the make<br>America great movement that that Trump<br>launched<br>third as uh research by uh Weiner and<br>Zellman show white nationalism is being<br>increasingly mainstreamed in the<br>Republican party members of Congress<br>particularly members of Congress who<br>come from districts that have very<br>proactive uh white nationalist groups<br>so together this means that there is a<br>significant political base for<br>racialized support for Hardline foreign<br>policies and for domestic monitoring of<br>ethnic Chinese populations on Insider<br>threat grounds or on identity<br>contamination grounds<br>now of course<br>the prc's blurring of the distinction<br>between nationality and ethnicity its<br>efforts to use overseas Chinese<br>communities for National purposes<br>Rejuvenation of China for instance<br>reinforces this long-time Trope the<br>Chinese Americans are disloyal<br>um one of the things that we've seen in<br>the last few years is an increase in<br>references in Chinese propaganda and<br>Chinese media Chinese newspapers<br>to um<br>references to the role that's the<br>China's sons and daughters have in<br>China's Rejuvenation so Xi Jinping blurs<br>the distinction between ethnicity and<br>nationality and basically says ethnic<br>Chinese around the world Chinese Sons<br>and Daughters around the world have a<br>responsibility and obligation a role to<br>play in China the Rejuvenation of the<br>People's Republic of China<br>and this puts then citizens of other<br>countries who happen to be ethnically<br>Chinese in a very difficult position<br>so this blurring of the distinction<br>between ethnicity nationality and<br>claiming that ethnicity requires Chinese<br>around the world to help China help with<br>China's Rejuvenation<br>adds to the possibilities of racial<br>resentment inside other countries that<br>have Chinese Chinese populations<br>now these two narratives of identity and<br>biological contamination uh came<br>together during covid<br>in the discourse is used by the white<br>nationalist constituencies the United<br>States by the Trump Maga movement<br>for example uh Senator John cornyn from<br>Texas stated early on in 2020 after the<br>breakout of the covid quote I think<br>China is to blame because of the culture<br>where people eat bats and snakes and<br>dogs and things like that these viruses<br>are transmitted from animal to the<br>people<br>uh what's interesting about that comment<br>is that there's essentially no<br>difference between that<br>and a cartoon uh that a white<br>nationalist cartoonist Ben Garrison<br>who's very popular on right-wing social<br>media a cartoon that he put together<br>that basically creates a connection<br>between covid and the cultural food<br>practices allegedly part of China<br>and it appears that this contamination<br>narrative had an effect on mobilizing<br>racialist political Behavior as well<br>Trump often used racial terms to<br>describe covid he referred to it as a<br>Chinese flu he referred to it as the<br>Kung flu and he used the Kung flu in his<br>election rallies if you go online and<br>look at some of his election rallies<br>where he uses the term Kung flu he<br>teases his audience he says there's lots<br>of different ways you can refer to covid<br>there's covid-19 there's the coronavirus<br>there's the China virus there's the<br>Wuhan virus then he kind of looks around<br>and he said and and then there's also<br>Kung Fu and immediately there's this<br>huge Roar of approval from uh the the<br>the audience clearly he was using this<br>as a whistle to mobilize the population<br>the participants in his in his uh<br>rallies and clearly his participants in<br>the rallies were waiting for that that<br>signal<br>uh there's research more systematic<br>research done by uh tawar Al in a very<br>respectable Outlook output Outlet the<br>National Bureau of economic research<br>that found for example after Trump first<br>tweeted Chinese uh<br>virus in uh in March of uh 2020. there<br>was a spike<br>in anti-asia hashtags on Twitter and<br>then there was also a spike in<br>anti-asian incidents<br>uh and the spikes were significantly<br>higher in Trump supporting counties in<br>the 2016 election than they were in<br>Clinton supporting counties uh in other<br>words this was these were his<br>constituents uh who were being mobilized<br>uh in China we have less systematic data<br>on the relationship uh between or the<br>use of uh racialized uh discourses<br>um and policy uh statements but uh there<br>is some anecdotal evidence that<br>nationalist Hawks also have suggested<br>that the white race generalization for<br>the West is a source of both ideological<br>and biological uh contamination<br>pandemics and they often refer to<br>Chinese people who constitute extreme<br>threats to China's Unity as race Traders<br>hanjian<br>so in conclusion<br>the hypothesis that U.S and China's<br>security dilemma is to a large degree<br>driven by perceptions of identity the<br>difference does not mean that there are<br>no conflicts of interest as leaders have<br>defined interests in the U.S China<br>relationship there are clearly conflicts<br>of interest over definitions of the<br>status quo in Taiwan over the Chinese<br>militarization of the South China Sea<br>over elements of trade policy over<br>China's support for Russia's invasion of<br>Ukraine those differences are real and<br>they exist<br>but what identity difference does is it<br>turns these conflicts of interest in<br>particular issue areas into essential or<br>existential and uh essentializing<br>cross-domain threats<br>every aspect of the relationship becomes<br>a question of relative gains not am I<br>better off compared to the past but<br>rather how can I make the other side<br>worse off than I am<br>this effect of identity difference is<br>even more pronounced when identities are<br>racialized<br>now of course you can have identity<br>rivalries that are not racialized for<br>the most part race-based stereotypes for<br>example weren't embedded in discourses<br>about self and other during the U.S<br>Soviet rivalry though other<br>identity-based stereotypes were<br>certainly prevalent<br>but racialized identity difference is<br>likely to intensify all of these<br>features of a security dilemma because<br>racialized beliefs are hyper certain<br>they're hyper dehumanizing they're hyper<br>militarized and they increasingly Infuse<br>the Republican Party in the United<br>States and they are present in a lot of<br>discourses in the Chinese Communist<br>Party about self and other in<br>international relations<br>and then that optimistic note I will<br>stop<br>foreign</p></main><footer style="margin-top: 2rem; background: #0001; padding: 2rem; text-align: center;"><p>We Are The University</p><ul style="list-style-type: none; padding: 0;
