faculty of Health<br>tawahangatata hawora<br>I'm Professor Wendy Lana I'm the Provost<br>of the university and I'm delighted that<br>you could join us this afternoon to<br>celebrate the achievements of your<br>family member friend or colleague<br>as well as being proud Spectators you<br>are also formal witnesses to these<br>official proceedings<br>a particularly warm welcome to whanau<br>and Friends throughout aotearoa and<br>indeed from across the globe who are<br>viewing these proceedings via our live<br>stream<br>however before we go any further with<br>the formalities as we will all know uh<br>there were tragic events in this city<br>yesterday so I would like you to join<br>with me in just a moment's silence to<br>thank you<br>I would now like to introduce you to the<br>chancellor of tahirangawaka Victoria<br>University of Wellington<br>this is a role that dates back to the<br>Middle Ages when the first universities<br>were established<br>the chancellor is the chair of the<br>University Council which is the<br>governing body responsible for setting<br>the University's strategic Direction<br>ladies and Gentlemen please welcome the<br>chancellor John Allen<br>foreign know my hiring my picky my<br>kitten<br>Toya Mayo Koto Waka Kita Waka<br>tenakoto<br>tenakoto katoa<br>and warm greetings to your wall<br>kildatato Co John Allen tokuinoa and<br>it's my very great pleasure as<br>Chancellor of this University towering a<br>walker Victoria University of Wellington<br>to congratulate our graduates and to<br>launch the celebration<br>and it is a celebration it's a<br>celebration of you and your achievements<br>and all the obstacles that you've faced<br>and overcome to be here today graduating<br>from our University it's a celebration<br>of your friends and family who have<br>supported you in this journey it's a<br>recognition of the academics that have<br>also supported and ignited your<br>imaginations as you've gone through this<br>process an extraordinary uh Talent bank<br>that we have at this at this University<br>and is a statement about the importance<br>of universities in aotearoa and in our<br>world to lead us in thinking<br>independently in challenging received<br>wisdom and in divining new courses and<br>new approaches that are necessary to<br>meet the challenges of our world<br>now I know as we all came in and we had<br>fanfares and we're wearing academic<br>dress it's easy to think that<br>universities are some sort of mysterious<br>cult that are out of touch with the real<br>world it's all a bit peculiar we've even<br>got Latin coming up just to tease you<br>just to excite you even got letting<br>because that's the sort of institution<br>we are we're an institution that stands<br>in three thousand and more years of<br>History<br>of learning from multiple cultures from<br>multiple sources that are now all stored<br>in the memory banks of the people behind<br>me all available to successive<br>generations of students and the magic of<br>the University arrives when we see all<br>of that wisdom that collected knowledge<br>intersect every year with a new<br>generation of students a new generation<br>of students who bring their energy their<br>passion their vision<br>and of course their contemporary issues<br>to the Forefront and it's that Clash of<br>those two well that's not a crash it's a<br>sort of melding of those two streams<br>that drives the magic of a university<br>that enables them a university to<br>innovate to change perceptions and to<br>alter worlds<br>now we know<br>that our world faces many challenges<br>and if we didn't think there was a<br>housing crisis we know as a result of<br>these events that Wendy just spoke about<br>that there is and it's real and it's<br>with us<br>if we didn't think there was a mental<br>health crisis then just walk out of this<br>building<br>and see<br>because there is and it's real and it's<br>present with us<br>if we didn't think there was a wider<br>Health crisis in aotearoa New Zealand<br>then just listen to the stories and I<br>was listening to the modern morning<br>report this morning of people that can't<br>get to see their GP of nurses who are so<br>pressured that they're going to implode<br>under that pressure of people who have<br>elective surgery that are having to live<br>with disability for month after month<br>after month<br>and then we see divisions in our society<br>divisions that are caused by technology<br>by disparity of wealth and opportunity<br>and we have to think about how we<br>address those things<br>and over all of that we've got the<br>existential challenges the existential<br>challenges of climate the exponential<br>challenge of war and again they're not<br>far away as we saw with Cyclone Gabriel<br>with climate as we see day by day<br>playing out in Ukraine<br>so there are challenges of Plenty for<br>our graduates to address<br>you're not the first generation to have<br>to address challenges<br>a hundred years ago uh the Second World<br>War uh was just breaking out well it's<br>not quite that but you know it's near<br>enough to 100 years ago how the second<br>world war was just breaking out just<br>give me a latitude of a decade or two uh<br>and<br>a poet called Alden w h Orden because<br>you'll be wanting poetry about now I was<br>thinking you'd be thinking my God this<br>is too intense let's just have a bit of<br>poetry so here it goes a poem A Part<br>called ordin wrote a poem called first<br>September 1939 and this is just a very<br>short bit of it because it's a very long<br>poem uh this is the last um uh the last<br>of the verses of that poem and he said<br>this defenseless under the night our<br>world and stupid lies yet everywhere<br>ironic flashes of light flash out<br>wherever the just exchanged their<br>messages<br>may I like them composed of Eros end of<br>dust beleaguered by the same negation<br>and despair<br>show an affirming flame now I can see<br>that's engaged to immediately that<br>language uh it's a bit archaic isn't it<br>but the simple thing that Odin was<br>recognizing is that in the face of<br>enormous challenge<br>individual and Community Action matters<br>in the face of enormous challenge what<br>you do what I do what we do as a<br>university makes a difference<br>because universities are not Ivory<br>towels they are part of communities<br>universities are not some Arcane sort of<br>magical place where Dusty academics do<br>unnecessary Research into stuff no one's<br>ever heard of they're places where magic<br>happens that can transform society and<br>the students who graduate from this<br>University tearing a walk of Victoria<br>University of Wellington are<br>particularly lucky because you've chosen<br>a university that is in the capital city<br>of Altera or New Zealand the most<br>Progressive Nation on Earth for uh<br>social policy and so many other things<br>and you've seen politics in action<br>you've rubbed shoulders with politicians<br>you've rubbed shoulders with activists<br>you've rubbed shoulders with thinkers<br>you've rubbed shoulders with innovators<br>so you know that the city is just<br>seething with potential<br>and the challenge to you as it is to<br>each generation is how are you going to<br>respond<br>personally and collectively to address<br>the challenges I have just described<br>we must house our people<br>it's a simple statement but doing it<br>requires rethinks of policy rethinks of<br>architecture rethinks of all kinds of<br>stuff<br>we must lead our people to health<br>and we know they are not in health at<br>the moment we know covert has<br>participated and helped catalyzed a lot<br>of that unhealth that whether unhealth's<br>a word but nonetheless you know what I<br>mean<br>um so so the simple fact is we must lead<br>our people to health and there's a huge<br>Challenge and opportunity for you we<br>must heal the divisions between people<br>and that means we need design of our<br>apparatus and Technologies and other<br>things that enable everyone to<br>participate in the online World everyone<br>to participate in the real world<br>and that's the work that you all do in<br>your respective faculties and the thing<br>that unites that work because at some<br>point you know when you sort of see that<br>these are the various faculties that<br>we're bringing together for a graduation<br>they think what unites them what unites<br>them is that to understand your work and<br>to be successful in your work you need<br>you can't design stuff without people<br>you can't resolve health issues without<br>understanding the whole person and<br>engaging and respecting the whole person<br>and you can't build for future<br>Generations if you're not engaged with<br>and understanding the aspirations of<br>those of those Generations<br>so this is a particularly unique and<br>wonderful group of people we've got here<br>you know the epessimists in this world<br>apparently who don't think it's possible<br>to resolve these crises I'm hoping that<br>on the worldwide Zoom that we've got now<br>we've got billions of people billions of<br>eyeballs watching because what they will<br>see when they watch this is the answer<br>the answer to the problem not just you<br>but Collective generations of Scholars<br>of thinkers of independent actors who<br>are called to make a difference in their<br>communities<br>can I congratulate you<br>can I congratulate the whanau and<br>friends who are with you can I wish all<br>of you every success and I'm going to<br>close with a very short piece of a poem<br>uh by Glenn Calhoun<br>and I chose Glenn in park because it's a<br>great piece but in part because he's a<br>doctor<br>uh he's engaged very extensively with<br>mental health patients in Auckland he's<br>just written a wonderful new book of<br>artery called letters to young people if<br>you haven't read it you should if you're<br>particularly if you're involved in that<br>uh in that medical space but in<br>particular because he went to live with<br>Napoli up in the far north and he<br>engaged with Maori communities up there<br>and he wrote a book of poetry then<br>called The Art of walking upright which<br>some of you will know and the piece that<br>I just wanted to put to you was this he<br>said the art of standing upright that is<br>the art of standing upright here in Old<br>Tyrone New Zealand it's the art of<br>standing on two feet<br>one is for holding on<br>the other is for letting go and you<br>might just think my God what does that<br>mean it means you have to stand for<br>something you as students need to stand<br>up you need to be seen and you need to<br>be standing for something<br>it means you've got to hold on with one<br>leg to the Traditions the cultures the<br>learnings all the things that you've had<br>from the University from school from<br>family and whanau<br>and you've got to be prepared to step<br>into the unknown you've got to be<br>prepared to take risks to do things<br>differently to resolve the challenges<br>that we collectively face<br>I know you can do it because your<br>graduates of our University<br>I know you can do it because I can feel<br>the energy in the room I know you can do<br>it because I know this wonderful group<br>of people that have led you to this<br>point and I know you can do it because<br>you're supported by whanau from here and<br>around the world can I congratulate you<br>the chancellor will now recognize the<br>graduates as listed in the graduation<br>program<br>well all the degree diploma and<br>um that's you all of you<br>it's quite important that it's when you<br>actually formally sort of graduate<br>so so yeah just you know it's worth<br>standing for if you're sitting you don't<br>so I launched okay<br>hi John Allen Chancellor of tehringa<br>Walker Victoria University of Wellington<br>would like to formally recognize the<br>persons whose names are entered into the<br>presentation of graduates the degrees<br>diplomas and certificates they're<br>appearing and confirm that they have<br>been admitted to these degrees diplomas<br>and certificates in this University<br>congratulations to you all as graduates<br>you may now put on your trenches that is<br>we're now going to move on to honoring<br>the graduates listed in your program<br>each graduate will be called to the<br>stage to be congratulated beginning with<br>the award of the degree of doctor of<br>philosophy<br>the vice Chancellor Professor Nick Smith<br>will read the summary and the chancellor<br>foreign<br>as we've just heard from the chancellor<br>with passion with poetry with commentary<br>universities have a fundamental role in<br>enriching knowledge creativity and<br>diverse ways of understanding the world<br>and research is very much one of those<br>key contributions that we can make both<br>in the academic sphere but also<br>certainly to society as well<br>our doctoral graduates achieve<br>academically at the very highest level<br>and the researchers provided insights<br>into some of the major questions that<br>Society faces today<br>it's increasingly difficult in a<br>contemporary world to separate expertise<br>from opinion yet these graduates have<br>spent years<br>learning their craft and doing just that<br>they can help us understand the past the<br>present and possible Futures though<br>independent thinkers and makers who are<br>active and engaged Global Citizens we<br>are very proud of the contributions<br>they've made and we look forward to the<br>way in which they will continue to<br>enrich all our lives and all our futures<br>the short summary that I'll share now<br>gives only a glimpse of impact and<br>innovation of this work<br>however it does show the significant<br>issues the next generation of Scholars<br>Dr sayo's research explores ethical<br>challenges among nurses in Samara<br>providing evidence in relation to<br>nursing ethics and the value of<br>socio-cultural context and perspective<br>and understanding the values of nurses<br>ethical insights and how ethics can be<br>operationalized in nursing practice<br>Chancellor I present ala Valley sayos to<br>the degree of
