evening and welcome to this<br>graduation ceremony for the Wellington<br>faculty of engineering to wahanga ahunui<br>pukaha and the Wellington faculty of<br>science to wahangaputaya<br>I'm Professor Wendy Lana I'm the Provost<br>of the university and I'm delighted that<br>you can join us this evening to<br>celebrate the achievements of your<br>family member friend or colleague<br>as well as being

the very tragic<br>events that happened in our city<br>yesterday<br>I'd now like to introduce you to the<br>chancellor of taharang Waka Victoria<br>University of Wellington<br>this is a role that dates back to the<br>Middle Ages when the first universities<br>were established<br>the chancellor is the chair of the<br>University Council which is the<br>governing body responsible for setting<br>the university strategic Direction<br>ladies and Gentlemen please welcome the<br>foreign<br>foreign warm greetings to you all<br>it is my privilege as Chancellor of our<br>University to welcome you to the<br>Celebration<br>it's a celebration of the achievements<br>of our graduates the work you've done<br>the things you've had to face and get<br>through the resilience that you've shown<br>in the face of covert and all kinds of<br>other challenges the facts that you're<br>here tonight is a remarkable achievement<br>and we are going to celebrate it tonight<br>to your friends and family your whanau<br>who are with you to recognize all of the<br>support that you have provided to your<br>family member as they've progressed<br>through their challenging academic<br>programs we're going to recognize you<br>tonight to this extraordinary brains<br>trust that's sitting behind me the<br>academic community of tehrenga Waka<br>Victoria University of Wellington we are<br>going to recognize them for the<br>leadership for the skill that they've<br>applied in getting the graduates where<br>they are today for the way they've<br>activated your minds challenged you<br>pushed you but got you there in the end<br>as a real quality graduate in the<br>engineering and in the science<br>disciplines someone who can tackle the<br>challenges of the Contemporary World<br>someone who can envisage new Futures in<br>our world and someone who can actually<br>make a difference<br>you know when we progress in and our<br>academic robes when we have fanfares of<br>trumpets and things of that kind people<br>can look at us a little as stance they<br>can think that we're some sort of odd<br>Community that's locked in the past and<br>not really active in the present that we<br>are a group of academics who do Dusty<br>sort of research in Dusty sort of<br>offices and nothing that really engages<br>with the city with the country with<br>people in our community<br>of course nothing could be further from<br>the truth<br>at a time of fake news at a time of<br>cyber security threats that reckon that<br>are threatening businesses all over the<br>place at a time of crises and housing<br>and health<br>in just about every area that you can<br>imagine<br>we need universities because<br>universities are places which are<br>designed for advanced learning<br>universities are places that by law have<br>to produce and provide world-class<br>teaching and world-class research and we<br>do and universities are places that by<br>law are required to be a Critic and<br>conscience of society we've got to speak<br>up we can't stay silent in the face of<br>these challenges the university<br>community has a statutory obligation<br>powered by a superpower called academic<br>freedom which allows people behind me to<br>say things that are unpopular or<br>challenging it allows them to challenge<br>received wisdom it allows them to put<br>forward new ideas<br>and that's what they've been doing with<br>you they've been charging you up they've<br>been preparing you they've been getting<br>you ready for the challenges ahead<br>and you know there are challenges I've<br>just been through some of them you know<br>that as a society we are changing and<br>changing rapidly you know that you're<br>going to have to keep learning because<br>the world is keeping changing<br>I thought about now I'd introduce a poem<br>now people would say to me why on Earth<br>would you put poetry in an engineering<br>and science group<br>but the reason is people misunderstand<br>your disciplines they think you're sort<br>of boring autocratic type of people who<br>do sums and peculiar algorithm equations<br>that can't actually engage in anything<br>imaginative or futuristic or creative<br>and they're wrong they're completely<br>wrong they misunderstand it I know this<br>because Paul Callahan who was one of<br>your science Community collaborated with<br>Bill Manheim who's one of our creative<br>community in a remarkable book called<br>our Angels okay<br>and what it demonstrated was the<br>extraordinary creativity of the<br>scientific and Engineering communities<br>they wrote poems they started talking<br>about poetic Concepts so I'm very<br>comfortable in introducing a poem<br>tonight if you don't like it just<br>interject and tell me and I'll introduce<br>two<br>all right the poem's called fear of<br>change does something like this I never<br>get it quite right it's a New Zealand<br>part<br>um if you or I were woken by the drums<br>of revolution in the street or suppose<br>the door flew open and there stood a<br>young bullfighter with a skin of rough<br>red wine offering us all death sex hope<br>or even an earthquake causing the trees<br>to shake the roofs to rumble calling us<br>all loudly to consider God let us admit<br>with no shame whatever we're not that<br>sort of people we've learned to weigh<br>our words like answers of butter our<br>strength is in anger and monotony<br>therefore Will Survive the singers the<br>dancers the star-crossed lovers will<br>bury them all and spend a long wet<br>weekend arguing with<br>arguing with her the corpses were<br>dressed in red or black<br>now what I reckon you should take from<br>that is simply this what are you going<br>to do when your door flies open what are<br>you going to do when you're presented<br>with change and challenge won't be in<br>the form of a young bullfighter<br>unfortunately with a skin of rough red<br>wine but nonetheless how are you going<br>to respond<br>and I know as a graduate of this<br>University a graduate of this University<br>who has been trained not only in the<br>technical elements of your particular<br>discipline but has been encouraged<br>because you're in a political City in<br>the capital city of Altera and New<br>Zealand you've been rubbing shoulders<br>with policy makers and politicians<br>you've been rubbing shoulders with all<br>kinds of entrepreneurs and others who<br>are building businesses and creating<br>Futures I know that your response when<br>the door flies open to opportunity or<br>challenge or change will be to step<br>right through that door because you are<br>going to with your skills with your<br>passions and with your disciplines not<br>only address the immediate challenges<br>that we're confronting but change the<br>world now you know<br>that there are people<br>who are pessimistic at the moment about<br>the future and you can kind of<br>understand it with climate change<br>existential threat war going on all<br>those sorts of things but I'm hoping<br>that our live stream tonight is being<br>beamed to billions I hope billions of<br>eyeballs are on it are on you because<br>you represent the hope you represent the<br>opportunity you represent the answer to<br>the challenges you can't do it alone I<br>understand that but there are a fair few<br>of you graduating this week so I reckon<br>collectively we've got enough power to<br>be able to make a jolly Dent uh in the<br>challenges that are currently<br>confronting us we're extraordinarily<br>proud of you we know it's been a tough<br>time we know covert has been incredibly<br>tough I'm extraordinarily proud of the<br>people who are sitting behind me they<br>are some of the best brains in the on<br>the planet they're creative they're<br>imaginative and they're technically<br>brilliant and I know because of the<br>alchemy that occurs when thousands of<br>years of knowledge which is what they<br>stand in the tradition of thousands of<br>years of Knowledge from all kinds of<br>communities all over the planet<br>intersects each year with young new<br>thinking uh you know students when we<br>get that the new thinking and all of<br>those strands of knowledge and they come<br>together they meld and they create Magic<br>they create answers<br>so in that spirit<br>of answers of magic and of creativity in<br>your respective disciplines I'm going to<br>I'm going to end with another very short<br>poem that's only an extract from a poem<br>so you'll be pleased about that it's an<br>extract from a poem by a check called<br>Glenn colhoun and he went up here in New<br>Zealand part two uh he went up and lived<br>with Napoli in the far north he's a<br>doctor in Auckland for a long time he<br>wrote a wonderful book of poetry called<br>The Art of standing upright and that was<br>what it was about was the art how you<br>could stand in this place in aotearoa in<br>New Zealand and he said the art of<br>standing upright here is the art of<br>standing on two feet<br>one is for holding on<br>the other is for letting go<br>magic 8. I could see in your faces my<br>God it just really resonated the um<br>but what I think he's saying is this all<br>right so what I did here's a momentary<br>Exposition on it what I think he's<br>saying is this to make a difference in<br>the world you've got to stand up you've<br>got to stand for something and I hope<br>that this university has given you the<br>confidence to be able to stand and stand<br>for something you've got to lock one<br>foot in the Traditions the Heritage the<br>learnings the communities that you come<br>from<br>and you've got to honor them and they<br>will keep you strong but you've got to<br>leap off that one foot onto the other<br>foot to plunge into the future you've<br>got to be prepared to use everything<br>that you've got all that you've learned<br>all the support that's been provided<br>from your families and whanau to create<br>to to confront the future and in that<br>Spirit can I congratulate you<br>it's a fantastic achievement we're<br>delighted to see you here I'm looking<br>forward to shaking as many hands as I<br>possibly can node<br>kotokai tenata<br>the chancellor is now going to recognize<br>the graduates as listed in the<br>graduation program<br>well all the degree diploma certificate<br>graduates please stand up now<br>yep<br>great<br>thank you this is quite an important<br>moment because it's when you actually<br>get officially recognized as having<br>graduated<br>all right so here we go hi John Allen<br>Chancellor of teheringawaka Victoria<br>University of Wellington would like to<br>formally recognize the persons whose<br>names are entered in the presentation of<br>graduates the degrees diplomas and<br>certificates they're appearing and<br>confirm that they have been admitted to<br>these

listed in your program<br>each graduate will be called to the<br>stage to be congratulated beginning with<br>the award of the degrees of doctor of<br>philosophy<br>the vice Chancellor Professor Nick Smith<br>will read the summary<br>and the chancellor will congratulate<br>so as we've just heard from the<br>chancellor with poetry with prose<br>and with a fair degree of passion<br>universities have a fundamental role in<br>enhancing knowledge creativity in the<br>diverse ways of understanding the world<br>and one of those key ways is our<br>research contributions that we make to<br>society<br>it's my great pleasure to introduce our<br>doctoral graduates who have brought<br>their talent and have brought their<br>passion<br>to achieve academically at the very<br>highest level<br>their research has provided insights as<br>we will hear into some of the major<br>questions that Society faces and with<br>that commitment that talent that passion<br>underlies an enormous amount of hard<br>work<br>at an enormous amount of detailed<br>technical uh contribution what we're<br>going to hear today is just a summary of<br>that but it is remarkable all the same<br>it's difficult and increasingly<br>difficult in the Contemporary world to<br>separate expertise and opinion and these<br>graduates have spent several years doing<br>exactly that<br>in doing so they can help us understand<br>the past<br>help us understand the present and I<br>think most significantly and excitingly<br>among our graduates today possible<br>Futures though independent thinkers<br>they're makers who are actively and<br>engaged Global Citizens and we are very<br>very proud of the contributions they<br>have made and will continue to make to<br>society going forward<br>as I've said I'll only give the<br>associations that I will read only give<br>a glimpse of the impact and innovation<br>of their work however they do show the<br>significant issues of the
