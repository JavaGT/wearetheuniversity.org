welcome to this<br>graduation ceremony for the Wellington<br>faculty of humanities and social<br>sciences<br>I'm Professor Wendy Lana I'm the Provost<br>of the university and I'm delighted that<br>you could join us this afternoon to<br>celebrate the achievements of your<br>family member friend or colleague<br>as well as being proud Spectators you<br>are also formal witnesses to these<br>official proceedings<br>a very warm welcome also to whanau and<br>Friends throughout arteroa and indeed<br>across the globe who are viewing these<br>proceedings via our live stream<br>now before we begin the formalities I<br>would like you to join with me in a<br>moment's silence to acknowledge the<br>tragic event that took place in our city<br>thank you<br>I'd now like to introduce you to the<br>chancellor of taharangawaka Victoria<br>University of Wellington<br>this is a role that dates back to the<br>Middle Ages when the first universities<br>were established<br>the chancellor is the chair of the<br>University Council which is the<br>governing body responsible for setting<br>the University's strategic Direction<br>ladies and Gentlemen please welcome the<br>in a manner in a row in our ewe namata<br>Waka uttamotu no<br>and warm greetings to you all<br>it's my great privilege as Chancellor of<br>our University to welcome you to this<br>celebration<br>it's a celebration of our students and<br>their success it's a celebration of your<br>endeavors as students the fact that<br>you've managed through so many different<br>challenges and you're still here you've<br>got through and today we are going to<br>recognize you so expect some singing and<br>some dancing accept some expect some<br>music and some energy because this is a<br>celebration we want you to celebrate and<br>we want to celebrate with you<br>it's also a recognition of the whanau<br>and Friends other family members who<br>have supported you on your journey<br>because we know this can't be done alone<br>we know it takes a village to support a<br>student in fact it probably takes a sort<br>of small town given the challenges that<br>you've had over your period at our<br>University<br>this is a chance also to recognize the<br>extraordinary Talent of our academic and<br>professional staff communities the<br>wisdom that they bring the challenge<br>that they've brought to you the<br>intellectual stimulation they've been<br>prepared and able to put in front of you<br>that have enabled you to complete your<br>studies and celebrate here with us today<br>and it is a reminder<br>about the importance of universities in<br>contemporary Society<br>you know there are some people who would<br>listen to that Fanfare and watch the<br>parade as we all entered wearing our<br>academic Garb and think my gosh this is<br>some sort of mysterious sect that I've<br>stumbled into that has very little<br>relevance with contemporary Society<br>the truth as you and I know is entirely<br>different the truth is that what's<br>Happening Here Is Magic and Alchemy it's<br>bringing together thousands of years of<br>Knowledge from multiple civilizations<br>stored in the brain's trust behind me<br>the academic community that is the heart<br>of this University but each year<br>remarkably those thousands of years of<br>knowledge intersect with a new<br>generation of students a new generation<br>that have their own passions their own<br>enthusiasms their own interests their<br>own ideals their own battles that they<br>need to fight and it is in the melding I<br>was going to say the Collision but it's<br>more a melding of those two strands that<br>the magic of University happens<br>now we know that universities are<br>important in a time of sort of fake news<br>and Ai and algorithm-driven thinking<br>because the purpose of a university is<br>to create people who can think for<br>themselves we know that in a time when<br>all kinds of strange theories can be<br>found on the web about just about any<br>subject on the planet<br>research-based learning research-based<br>decision making analytical capabilities<br>are critical to the future of our planet<br>and of our peoples<br>and we know that in an environment in<br>which we are seeing more and more a<br>polarization less and less cohesion the<br>sort of wisdom that can come from a<br>place like this needs to act as a<br>critical conscience in our society we<br>need to speak up<br>we know there are challenges there are<br>heaps of challenges we know that the<br>housing crisis is real and in this place<br>it is real because we've seen the<br>tragedies of recent days we know that<br>mental health issues are real because we<br>walk the streets of our city we know<br>that pressure on our health system is<br>real because we hear the news day by day<br>by day<br>about what challenges people are<br>confronting in that space we know the<br>existential challenges of climate the<br>existential challenges of War because<br>we've had Cyclone Gabriel in recent time<br>and we see every night stories of war in<br>Europe and in other parts of our world<br>so these are not academic things these<br>are real issues the question is how do<br>you as students how do you as graduates<br>of this University<br>respond to those issues<br>and of course today we are recognizing<br>our humanities faculties we're<br>recognizing faculties that for many<br>people are simply an ornament in the<br>sort of tapestry of a university they<br>think poetry and writing they think art<br>and film are simply ornaments and they<br>are fundamentally mistaken let me say<br>that in my view the humanities are the<br>heart of our University they are the<br>they are the heart of our University<br>because they celebrate lived experience<br>because they help us understand<br>ourselves and others they help us to<br>find joy in living and most importantly<br>because they enable us to tell our<br>stories whether they're historical<br>stories or futurist stories whether<br>they're cultural stories or drawn from<br>your own imagination<br>whether it's research-based Stories the<br>stories of you and the faculties that<br>you represent are fundamentally<br>important to the future of this country<br>that of course makes you very dangerous<br>people<br>you've got an influence that you just<br>don't believe you can write your way<br>into a new this country into a new<br>future you can through your poetry<br>challenge the very foundations of this<br>country and of our world<br>you can in telling the history of this<br>place and of other places correct the<br>misapprehensions that have driven so<br>much Despair and despondency in parts of<br>our community you can sing your way into<br>creating joy and difference you know<br>that Fanfare that we heard Gareth far<br>and Douglas Lilburn both have strong<br>connections uh with this University the<br>truth is we've always been a dangerous<br>place the true the truth is that the<br>sort of debate that we've seen over to<br>Seattle avia's poetry for example<br>misinterpreting what she said oh well<br>accurately interpreting what she said<br>but misunderstanding the purpose of<br>poetry uh challenging as that poetry is<br>they obviously haven't read much of her<br>poetry they haven't obviously read witty<br>Myra's poetry they certainly haven't<br>read uh Alice tipunga somerville's<br>poetry she just wrote won the occupant<br>prize published by cherawati<br>hildingawaka University press of course<br>because we're at the Forefront of the<br>Rebellion uh we're at the Forefront of<br>the fight back we're at the Forefront of<br>recognizing that new stories needs to be<br>told in this place different stories<br>need to be told in this place if we are<br>going to create a contemporary<br>harmonious and forward-thinking Society<br>now of course to tell those difficult<br>stories to do that difficult research to<br>be the critic and conscience of society<br>to speak up and to stand up takes<br>courage<br>and so you have to think about for<br>yourself what does courage look like in<br>this current environment but the images<br>of Courage that we have are often as<br>soldiers and people in war but those are<br>very very limited views it is courageous<br>to dispel incorrect thinking through<br>research and to publish that research it<br>is courageous to dispel incorrect<br>histories and to publish those histories<br>in through tailoring a walker press it<br>is courageous to write poetry which<br>confronts the challenges of our time and<br>provokes us to think differently it is<br>courageous to be thinking in policy<br>terms and social scientific terms about<br>ways in which we can almost dissemble<br>current Society to build it back better<br>to use that language which seems to be a<br>great slogan of the government to build<br>it back better<br>courage is off is ultimately in many<br>cases simply standing up and being who<br>you are being true to yourself being<br>true to the learning that you have and<br>being prepared to express that learning<br>and that is what we would encourage for<br>you and from you that is what we want<br>from you because that is what the spirit<br>of tehringa Walker is that is what this<br>University is and that is how you will<br>make us most proud<br>I want to finish and you'll be pleased<br>I'm going to finish but nonetheless<br>I wasn't sure I've got three books here<br>to finish with I wasn't sure which one<br>I'd use<br>um I think what I'll use I'll I'll use a<br>um<br>Walt Whitman<br>uh quote because I think it's it's<br>terrific many of you will know this<br>those of you that are in the literary<br>sort of spheres so this is a quote from<br>the<br>um the preface that he wrote two Leaves<br>of Grass is great book of poetry uh in<br>the 1856 Edition and this is what he<br>said to people they should do<br>this is what you shall do remember he<br>was writing in 1856 so the language is a<br>love the Earth and Sun and the Animals<br>despise riches give arms to everyone who<br>asks<br>stand up for the stupid and crazy devote<br>your income and labor to others hate<br>tyrants argue not concerning God have<br>patience and Indulgence towards the<br>people<br>re-examine all this is a these are these<br>are excerpts<br>re-examine all you have been told at<br>school or church or in any book<br>dismiss what insults your own soul<br>and your very flesh shall become a great<br>poem<br>can I say to you that the work you are<br>doing the work you have done<br>demonstrates that you have the capacity<br>to drive and influence change<br>never doubt the power of the humanities<br>to confront and shift opinion<br>never doubt your own power standing in<br>your own Traditions with your own<br>insights and knowledge in your own<br>cultures to be prepared to speak truth<br>to power<br>speak truth to power<br>because it is through taking those<br>courageous steps that we can improve and<br>transform this country know that I'd<br>attend our Koto killed my tenatato katoa<br>the chancellor will now
