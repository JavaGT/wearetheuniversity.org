learning and<br>growth are highly important to me and<br>with that comes the importance that is<br>celebrating that learning and growth<br>tonight is a celebration of just that a<br>huge milestone for us and one that we<br>all are to be proud of<br>life is crazy it's unpredictable it's<br>turbulent and it's full of challenges<br>when we started studying in 2020 the<br>covert pandemic began in New Zealand<br>just one month into the first trimester<br>the university experience changed<br>completely for many it was challenging<br>and so many barriers continued to arise<br>jobs were affected incomes our Learning<br>Journey and experience was affected<br>learning to engage with others from our<br>own home to stay motivated to keep<br>working hard whilst maintaining our own<br>well-being and health in such different<br>times<br>and not saying the very people around us<br>here today<br>the health and well-being of the ones we<br>love were affected worried about our<br>elders and those immune compromised<br>stressed about getting it and passing it<br>on to others and dealing it with with<br>ourselves when we were unwell<br>but most importantly our own well-being<br>and health was affected<br>struggling with the new life of being<br>stuck in bubbles feeling isolated and<br>alone and not knowing what was to come<br>or having control over it<br>having to manage all that is affected<br>and the stresses and worries that tag<br>along with it<br>the covert crazy on top of all of the<br>other crazy<br>but wait there's more<br>late nights long days cheap easy dinners<br>for some tiresome walks home others<br>sleepy bus rides down the hill expensive<br>coffee on campus that racks up by the<br>end of the trimester<br>lots of reading lots of quiet nights and<br>lots of weekends spent studying alone<br>all of the crazy that comes with being a<br>student<br>but it's these challenges and barriers<br>that we take on and overcome that<br>support us in growing and I'm sure for<br>many of us what got us here today<br>but that's what we ought to celebrate<br>getting here today<br>it's important to acknowledge and<br>appreciate that we didn't do this alone<br>the support patience and kindness from<br>those around us is what enables us to<br>keep progressing forward<br>takitini<br>a beautiful whakatoki meaning My Success<br>is not mine alone it is the success of<br>the collective<br>to our families friends Partners peers<br>and the academic staff here at Victoria<br>University of Wellington thank you for<br>supporting us<br>I can genuinely say the academic
