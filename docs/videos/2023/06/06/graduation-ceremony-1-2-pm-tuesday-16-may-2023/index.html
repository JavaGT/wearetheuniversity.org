this may<br>well the rest of the audience please<br>foreign<br>foreign<br>God of Nations<br>good afternoon and welcome to this<br>graduation ceremony for the Wellington<br>School of Business and government ariki<br>I'm Professor Wendy Lana I'm the Provost<br>of the university and I'm delighted that<br>you can join us this afternoon to<br>celebrate the achievements of your<br>family member friend or colleague<br>as well as being proud Spectators you<br>are also formal witnesses to these<br>official proceedings<br>a very warm welcome also to whanau and<br>Friends throughout artioroa and across<br>the globe who are viewing these<br>proceedings via Our Lives stream<br>now before we go any further this<br>afternoon I am going to ask you just to<br>take a moment for a pause to recognize<br>the very tragic events in our city last<br>night so if you could just join with me<br>thank you<br>I'd now like to introduce you to the<br>chancellor of tahirangawaka Victoria<br>University of Wellington<br>this is a role that dates back to the<br>Middle Ages when the first universities<br>were established<br>the chancellor is the chair of the<br>University Council which is the<br>governing body responsible for setting<br>the University's strategic Direction<br>ladies and gentlemen the chancellor John<br>Allen<br>thank you for joining the celebration<br>uh it's a recognition of our students<br>and their success their efforts to<br>graduate in their chosen programs it's a<br>celebration of all of you who have<br>supported them in that achievement it's<br>a recognition of our great academic<br>staff and professional staff who have<br>helped and secured their success and it<br>is a statement a public statement about<br>the importance of universities and the<br>value of the work we do<br>now I know as we paraded in and we had<br>the trumpet Fanfare magnificent and we<br>had the all the ceremonial robes being<br>worn as as people wore their academic<br>regalia that you risk thinking this is<br>some archaic sect operating out some<br>peculiar ritual that no longer has any<br>relevance in contemporary aotearoa and<br>you would be fundamentally wrong if that<br>was your assumption because the reality<br>the Alchemy the magic of a university is<br>simply this that the brains trust the<br>people sitting behind me wearing the red<br>academic Gardens<br>they have Stan they stand in a tradition<br>of thousands of years of knowledge of<br>lived experience of multiple cultures<br>multiple Faith strands lots of different<br>understandings of human endeavor<br>they stand in that and thousands of<br>years and then every year a new<br>generation of students joins them with<br>their own agendas their contemporary<br>agendas their issues of the moment that<br>are important to them and it is in the<br>class or the the Confluence of those two<br>Traditions that we get the magic of this<br>place the new thinking the advocacy the<br>activism which can transform and change<br>a world so you might well think that by<br>reading the statutes you can get an<br>understanding of what a university is<br>and of course you'd read the Education<br>and Training act 2020 and of course many<br>of you will have and you'll know that<br>what a university is meant to be as a<br>place of Higher Learning that helps<br>people think for themselves that it is a<br>place of world-class teaching and<br>research and that it is to act as a<br>Critic and conscience of our society and<br>you know all that<br>and you think how does that actually<br>play out in reality<br>well it plays out in reality with you<br>learning how to apply your skills in the<br>real world it plays out in reality not<br>in just brain power but in being able to<br>translate brain power into action<br>and so whether you are graduating in<br>public policy whether you are graduating<br>in any of the other disciplines today<br>you will have learned in this place how<br>to think for yourself but equally<br>importantly how to translate that<br>thinking into real action in our<br>community to make a difference this<br>wonderful poem this is a University<br>graduation so I've allowed a poem or two<br>there's a wonderful poem called fear of<br>change which goes something like this I<br>often get it wrong if you or I were<br>woken by the drums of revolution in the<br>street or suppose the door flew open and<br>there stood a young bullfighter with the<br>skin of rough red wine offering us all<br>death sex hope or even an earthquake<br>causing the roof to shake the trees to<br>Rattle I think goes the other way around<br>actually calling us all loudly to<br>consider God let us admit with no shame<br>whatever we're not that sort of people<br>we've learned to weigh our words like<br>ounces of butter our school skill is for<br>anger and um<br>well angle it's just leave it at anger<br>for a moment our skill is for anger<br>therefore we will survive the singers<br>the dancers the star-crossed lovers will<br>bury them all and spend a long wet<br>weekend arguing whether the corpses were<br>dressed in red or black<br>it's a magnificent poem it's a poem<br>about the challenge of the unexpected<br>it's a poem about risk and the need to<br>take risk it's a poem about stepping<br>through the door when the door is opened<br>it's a poem about the reality of change<br>and in my mind it's a poem for our times<br>our time is because the drums are beaten<br>the drums are beating whether you talk<br>about the housing crisis or the um or<br>the Mental Health crisis whether you<br>talk about climate or you talk about war<br>and geopolitical tension whether you<br>talk about government policy and and the<br>extent to which society is cohesive or<br>not all of those issues are contemporary<br>issues on which the drums are beating<br>and the challenge is this how are you<br>going to respond how are you the<br>graduates this afternoon going to<br>respond to that beating drum<br>and I know people would have thought<br>with this group with this group today<br>with business people with people who are<br>doing public policy all that sort of<br>stuff they're going to be more into<br>weighing their words like ounces of<br>butter they're not going to be the<br>singing dancing type but I know that<br>your tea I'm bringing a walker graduates<br>and I know that beneath most bureaucrats<br>I've ever worked with I know that<br>beneath both most public policy<br>Specialists I've ever worked with there<br>is a seething singer dancer looking to<br>get out<br>and I know that if we just created a<br>public service in which people could<br>take some risks Frankie try some things<br>then we would have we'd make progress<br>That We're Not Making at the moment I<br>know when I look at the business<br>community and see those mission-led<br>businesses like volpara or they're those<br>sorts of businesses you know who are<br>bravely taking on uh breast cancer and<br>looking to completely change the world<br>in relation to the suffering breath<br>breast cancer or cogo that's looking to<br>nudge everybody into a carbon neutral<br>future I know that there's creativity in<br>the business Community it's easy to<br>write off business and say it's all<br>about money that's wrong it's about<br>Mission and it's about risk it's easy to<br>write off the bureaucracy and say it's<br>boring and irrelevant that's wrong every<br>day they are engaging into the political<br>process in real time to make a<br>difference in this country so what I<br>want to say to the graduates tonight or<br>today is simply this you have a chance<br>to make a difference in this city in<br>this country in our world you are ready<br>having graduated from this University to<br>take up that challenge<br>it is important that you do because this<br>country and our world faces challenges<br>that need your energy your imagination<br>your singing and your dancing shoes to<br>enable us all to thrive can I<br>congratulate you can I congratulate<br>those who have supported you can I<br>recognize again all of the academic<br>Community standing in that long<br>tradition who make this University an<br>extraordinary Hot House of imagination<br>new thinking and ideas and can I say to<br>you all go well make a difference make a<br>stand I'm going to end with another poem<br>I wasn't going to but I think I will<br>I can feel the excitement is another<br>poem builds<br>um so so this little poem really talks<br>about the uh opportunity that a<br>university creates and it's poem called<br>uh<br>planting trees goes like this planting<br>trees in early spring we make a place<br>for birds to sing in times to come<br>how do you know<br>they sing there now<br>there is no other guarantee that singing<br>will ever be that's upon by Wendell<br>Berry a uh an American part and it<br>speaks to the reality of a university we<br>plant trees<br>in which birds can sing in new<br>generations the model works it's worked<br>for year after year after year it needs<br>to be funded of course but it went in<br>there just in case there's a politician<br>in the room but it<br>but it works and you are our latest<br>demonstration of it working we're<br>incredibly proud of you we wish you<br>so the chancellor will now recognize the<br>graduates as listed in the graduation<br>program<br>well all the degree diploma and<br>hi John Allen
