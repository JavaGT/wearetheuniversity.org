University Council which is<br>the governing body responsible for<br>setting the University's strategic<br>Direction<br>ladies and gentlemen the chancellor John<br>Allen<br>kiratato kojon Ellen tokuinoa and it's<br>my very great privilege as Chancellor of<br>tehringawaka Victoria University of<br>Wellington to welcome you all to this<br>celebration<br>in welcoming you I recognize king<br>eatahatia and the kingitunga movement<br>and the extraordinary role they have<br>played in both the protection of Tanga<br>and the culture of maoridum and its<br>Resurgence I recognize monofinoa<br>rangatira for their kaitiaki their care<br>of this place and their welcoming to all<br>in this place and I particularly<br>recognize all of you who have come to<br>celebrate<br>this is a celebration and as has already<br>been said it's not matatini but it's<br>going to be damn close<br>uh so so this is a time for singing This<br>is a Time For Crying joyous tears this<br>is a time to recognize our students<br>their work their Endeavor the challenges<br>they have faced persevered and worked<br>through and the Triumph that is<br>represented by them being here today<br>it's an opportunity for us to salute<br>whanau and friends and recognize the<br>support that you have provided to them<br>because we all know that to succeed in<br>this education Endeavor requires a<br>village or given all the challenges of<br>covert probably a small City<br>and I don't doubt that each of our<br>students have looked for support from<br>whanau and friends and have derived<br>great strength from it<br>it's also an opportunity to acknowledge<br>this extraordinary brain's trust behind<br>me our Maori academics and the academic<br>community of tehringa Waka they're an<br>incredible Bunch the knowledge they have<br>is extraordinary it's inherited of<br>course through thousands of years of<br>lived experience of multiple cultures<br>across the globe<br>and they represent that knowledge and<br>they teach that knowledge and they<br>challenge our students and they assist<br>our students to be successful and so I<br>want to recognize them and the<br>remarkable role they play<br>and it's also an opportunity for us to<br>make a statement a public statement<br>about the importance of universities not<br>just here in ponaki but not New Zealand<br>and in our world<br>now I know that many people think that<br>universities are basically just old<br>dusty sort of academics that are sitting<br>in large offices researching stuff that<br>no one's ever heard of<br>but that's not this University<br>this University is a Capital City<br>University this University is a<br>university which brings together deep<br>knowledge and students each year who are<br>at the Forefront of issues contemporary<br>issues relevant to them<br>and the Alchemy in the university is the<br>merging of those strands of inherited<br>wisdom that are represented behind me<br>and the enthusiasms the energy and the<br>Vigor of each new generation of students<br>with their contemporary issues of<br>climate of housing of whatever the<br>issues might be that they are bringing<br>to this place and in colliding or I<br>would say melding because we don't sort<br>of do Collision here but nonetheless and<br>in colliding that is where the magic of<br>Education actually occurs so I want to<br>say to you that in coming to this<br>University<br>a university that is in the middle of<br>the politics of this country a<br>university which is in the middle of the<br>activism of this country a university<br>which is in the middle of the Artistry<br>and culture of this country a university<br>which is in the middle of the knowledge<br>and aspiration and vision and<br>international connection of this country<br>you have made a statement about the sort<br>of person you want to be<br>you know we've got lots of challenges<br>I've already rehearsed some of them and<br>we know that climate change and War are<br>existential challenges as well<br>so we've got lots of challenges<br>and you can choose how to respond to<br>them but I want to say to you that<br>there's a tehringa Walker graduate<br>indifference is not a choice<br>indifference is not the attitude that<br>you have been taught that has been<br>imparted to you from our academic<br>Community I know that because the<br>obligation of a university is to teach<br>you to think for yourself<br>I know indifference has not been taught<br>because the obligation of a university<br>is to teach you to research and analyze<br>and reflect and come to decisions based<br>on evidence<br>I know that indifference has not been<br>taught because we have an obligation<br>here to be critics and conscience of<br>society we take that seriously and we<br>expect our students to be critics and<br>conscience of society as well<br>now you and I know that within the story<br>of maoridum and the challenge of<br>pakiharmari relations there is still an<br>enormous lot of work to be done<br>yes there are green shoots yes we have<br>matariki we have matatini yes we have<br>extraordinarily successful Maori<br>business yes we have graduates like the<br>graduates that appearing before us to<br>graduate today yes we have terreo and it<br>is being spoken more widely and more<br>fluently uh yes we have one hunger that<br>have supported that so there are<br>elements that are<br>prospering and that is to be encouraged<br>and that is exciting and this University<br>is leaning into supporting those<br>endeavors<br>but let's be very clear that there is a<br>lot more to be done<br>and while the settlement processes are<br>desirable and have created money and<br>opportunity therefore for ewe no one<br>would suggest that money alone will<br>restore money<br>to restore money will require political<br>action and political decisions<br>and in that decision making there is<br>going to be an awkward question asked<br>Sydney Moko Mead who as you know was a<br>professor at this University in 1982<br>which is quite a long time ago but I can<br>remember it in 1982 spoke at a lecture<br>in Wellington in the Turnbull lecture<br>series<br>and in that lecture Professor Mead<br>raised this question<br>he said the question for pakiha is the<br>question whether they really do belong<br>in this land<br>and if so<br>what rights<br>they have to justify this<br>he actually put it more elegantly than<br>that because I've missed out a word or<br>two but nonetheless what rights they<br>have to justify us<br>he was raising the elephant that is so<br>often in the room now I'm not going to<br>answer that proposition except to treat<br>you you might say it's going to be part<br>of that answer I'm not going to answer<br>that here but what I am going to say to<br>of Wellington you can expect academics<br>to be researching that you can expect<br>people to be back debating those<br>questions you can expect us to be in the<br>public domain talking about these issues<br>and yes they're controversial and yes<br>they are difficult but that is the<br>purpose of a university and what I want<br>to say to our students is be brave you<br>need to lead into these hard issues<br>whether they'd infect married them or<br>whether they affect society as a whole<br>or the world as a whole you have an<br>obligation with your education to lead<br>those discussions and those debates<br>and we expect you to do it it's not<br>without risk of course it's not easy<br>but you can do it I know you can because<br>of the training you've received and I<br>know you can do it by writing I know you<br>can do it in the law if that's your<br>discipline I know you can do it by<br>telling stories if you're in the English<br>or filmmaking or theater areas I know<br>you can do it through education by<br>making our young people understand our<br>history in a more compelling way I know<br>you can do it whichever discipline you<br>have come from<br>and I want to encourage you to stand and<br>be strong<br>and I'm going to stop which you'll be<br>pleased about with a short poem it's<br>actually quite a long poem but I'm<br>taking a short extract from it it was<br>written by a check called Glenn Calhoun<br>who's a doctor in Auckland and Glenn<br>went up and spent some time with Napoli<br>quite a few years ago and he wrote a<br>wonderful book of poetry called The Art<br>of standing upright what he was talking<br>about is Mari pakiha relations and the<br>Art of standing upright here in aotearoa<br>it was a few years ago and he said this<br>the art of standing up right here is the<br>art of standing on two feet<br>one is for holding on<br>the other is for letting go<br>I can see that really resonated but<br>let me tell you why I think it's<br>important<br>because to our graduates I would say<br>this<br>you need to stand you can stand and you<br>can stand proud<br>in standing you need to with one leg<br>anchor yourself firmly in the heritage<br>of your ewe of your country of the Maori<br>Nation end of Altera you can and you<br>should<br>but you also need to leverage off that<br>leg to Spring Forward into the<br>opportunities of the future<br>to embrace those opportunities and<br>challenges and to ensure<br>that this country and Maori particularly<br>within this country achieve to their<br>future potential which is remarkable<br>and to which we all aspire<br>so with that thought can I congratulate<br>congratulate our graduates can I wish<br>you all every success this is a great<br>thank you<br>a Chancellor will now recognize the<br>graduates as listed in the graduation<br>program<br>therefore will all degrees diplomas and<br>certificate graduates<br>this is an important part of the<br>ceremony because it's when you actually<br>sort of are recognized as a graduate<br>hi John Allen Chancellor of tehringa<br>Walker Victoria University of Wellington<br>would like to formally recognize the<br>persons whose names are entered in the<br>presentation of graduates the degrees<br>diplomas and certificates they're<br>appearing<br>and confirm they have been admitted to<br>these degrees diplomas and certificates<br>in this University<br>congratulations to you all as graduates<br>you may now put on your trenches<br>graduates please be seated<br>we now move on to honoring the graduates<br>listed in the presentation of graduates<br>so each graduate will be called to the<br>front to be congratulated beginning with<br>the award of the degree of doctor of<br>philosophy the vice Chancellor Professor<br>Nick Smith will read the doctoral<br>summary<br>the chancellor will congratulate these<br>graduates as they come forward<br>Dr Ben Walker nazirokawa senior lecturer<br>in management at the Wellington School<br>of Business and government will announce<br>each graduate and their ewe<br>Dr Mike Ross senior lecturer in takawa a<br>Maui will present

and<br>architecture the my program provides<br>advice support and information to Maori<br>Students Association will present taonga<br>as the chancellor has just highlighted<br>there is an enormous potential and<br>contribution and talent and energy and<br>passion in this University<br>as our Deputy Vice Chancellor Maori<br>Higgins and I have discussed at hitting<br>a Waka The Mooring place of Waka<br>if you want to go far<br>you paddle your Walker together if you<br>want to go fast you paddle alone<br>and when the I have the great pleasure<br>today of introducing our doctoral<br>student who has paddled both far and<br>fast<br>are alone and with an enormous array of<br>our community together universities have<br>a fundamental role in enhancing<br>knowledge creativity and diverse ways of<br>understanding the world<br>and research is very much one of those<br>core contributions<br>our doctoral graduates achieve<br>academically at the very highest level<br>and the research has provided insights<br>into some of the major questions that<br>our society faces<br>as our Chancellor said so those<br>questions are increasingly existential<br>but having positive optimistic proactive<br>answers is I think key for all our<br>benefits it's increasingly difficult in<br>a contemporary world to separate<br>expertise from opinion yet these<br>graduates have spent years doing exactly<br>that they can help us understand the<br>past the present and possible Futures<br>they bring independent thinking and<br>makers who are actively engaged AS<br>Global Citizens we are proud of what<br>they've achieved with us we are proud of<br>what they will now do beyond their<br>doctoral studies<br>the short citation that I'm going to<br>share now gives only a glimpse glimpse<br>of the impact and innovation of the work<br>and doesn't do justice to the toil to<br>the dedication to the energy to the<br>effort that has been put underpinning it<br>it does however show significant issues<br>for our next generation of Scholars<br>foreign<br>research provides an explanation for the<br>complex relational spaces that Maori<br>doctoral students grapple with in<br>Academia capturing not only the<br>intellectual and cultural life worlds<br>but also the often silenced stories<br>Chancellor I present Henny rangi Mari<br>finaki Cole to the degree of doctor of<br>philosophy in
