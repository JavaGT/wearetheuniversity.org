Lois<br>foreign<br>there Chancellor<br>Chancellor alone<br>I am Louis lagalunga Hutchings and I am<br>deeply honored to be speaking on behalf<br>of the graduating students here today<br>so obviously to start congratulations<br>after all those hours and lecture<br>theaters doing icebreakers and tutorials<br>and getting 24-hour no question asked<br>extensions we've come to an end of a<br>journey and we've got a fancy slip of<br>paper to prove it<br>so now I guess it's time to sail thank<br>yous thank you to the lecturers course<br>coordinators and Shooters whose tireless<br>work and knowledge is the foundation in<br>which we stand today thank you to view<br>sir and our student leaders for<br>representing and supporting us<br>thank you to our families and our<br>friends for being there every step of<br>the way<br>thank you to the support staff the admin<br>staff and absolutely every single person<br>that does the Unseen works that we can<br>be here<br>thank you to Victoria University of<br>Wellington for being the community in<br>which I have belonged for four years<br>but arguably most importantly thank you<br>to you all the graduates in front of me<br>and every single student that's made up<br>our time here<br>thank you for being the best part about<br>going to University for being there as<br>we learned how to work hard or what the<br>very least how to work hard right before<br>the due date<br>thanks for not bringing up the awkward<br>things we did as freshers and for<br>sometimes doing most of the work and<br>group assignments<br>thank you for being our outspoken<br>tutorial debaters and our Facebook page<br>making class reps<br>thank you for speaking first and zoom<br>breakout rooms because I know none of us<br>really wanted to do that<br>thank you for being our flatmates even<br>if some of you didn't learn how to clean<br>up after yourselves<br>thanks for sharing your ideas especially<br>when they came in the form of notes and<br>thank you for begrudgingly making space<br>on those crowded rainy day buses<br>thank you for being different and<br>bringing all your unique experiences<br>with you thank you for standing up for<br>each other and for standing up for<br>what's right<br>thank you for the laughter and the tears<br>thank you for being there at our highest<br>points and thank you for staying at our<br>lowest<br>I cannot pretend that I know every<br>single person in this room I do not know<br>what you've all been through during your<br>time here<br>but thanks to my own journey through<br>Pacific studies and in the Indigenous<br>way of knowing I do know that knowledge<br>does not have a hierarchy it does not<br>have to be for individuals and it does<br>not have to come with a set of<br>expectations what I know is that our<br>knowledge is not bound to our classrooms<br>to the confines of the libraries the<br>backlights of our laptop screens or even<br>the paper you hold in your hands<br>I know that knowledge is fluid that it<br>is growing and I know it connects us<br>so I am thankful to have learned so much<br>with you and thankful to have learned so<br>much from you<br>it may be a surprise but there are many<br>more thank yous to be made I've barely<br>touched on everything that has added up<br>to form what that paper truly represents<br>it's not just the academic theories or<br>even the friends you've made for life<br>it's also the people you might not ever<br>see again the hardships you've overcome<br>and the seemingly insignificant moments<br>that happen to you every day<br>so with many more thank yous to go I'll<br>leave it for you to finish yourself<br>and once your thank yous are done it's<br>time to look forward to the future what<br>you decide to do with your piece of<br>paper is entirely up to you it's yours<br>to use to grow and ultimately to Define<br>when I look at mine I don't just see my<br>credentials and my Mages and an<br>expectation to be a certain person<br>when I look at mine I see every single<br>person I've met along the way and an<br>opportunity to make them proud<br>so finally congratulations and in more<br>ways than one thank you for having me</p></main><footer style="margin-top: 2rem; background: #0001; padding: 2rem; text-align: center;"><p>We Are The University</p><ul style="list-style-type: none; padding: 0; margin: 0;"><li><a
