you<br>um<br>so first of all um let me say I'm very<br>honored to receive this honorary<br>doctorate not just for myself but also<br>for my family<br>my family has had a long long connection<br>with this University both my sisters<br>went here and both my parents were<br>students here and my first professional<br>employment as distinct from sweeping the<br>streets of Wellington and working on the<br>wharves was here at Victoria as a<br>lecturer in the economics Department<br>so I want to thank three people in<br>particular for making it all happen one<br>is Provost Wendy Lana the second one is<br>Professor girol Kara kaglu and the third<br>one is Ellen Walden Kidd she is the<br>senior advisor in the alumni and<br>engagement team you would not believe<br>how much effort she has put into the<br>logistics of getting me to stand at this<br>point<br>so many thanks I'm tempted now to follow<br>the example of Winston Churchill who was<br>invited to give a speech at Harrow<br>school near London in 1941 at the height<br>of the first of the second world war<br>when the German air force was bombing<br>London to bits he stood up to address<br>the assembled boys of Harrah's school<br>and he said three words he said never<br>give in and sat down that was his speech<br>however rather than sit down right away<br>I want to say something which takes off<br>from a comment that the chancellor made<br>about machine learning AI GPT the tech<br>Revolution that we are now living<br>through which is occurring at<br>exponential or double exponential speed<br>and its implications for University<br>graduates including you<br>the effects are coming at us faster and<br>more disruptively than the effects of<br>the last technological Revolution which<br>was the computer Revolution beginning<br>on on the AI Revolution you will know<br>that Jeffrey Hinton the who is<br>identified as the Godfather of AI<br>recently resigned from Google to<br>dedicate himself to warning about what<br>he calls the existential threat posed by<br>A.I saying and this is a quote I used to<br>think that it namely the existential<br>threat was a long way off but now I<br>think it's serious and it's fairly soon<br>so we know all about these dangers at<br>least in the in a in a general sense and<br>you will know too we know how AI is<br>already affecting education as in exams<br>and essays<br>but I want to talk at some at a short<br>length about potential good news<br>and the good news is that it is at least<br>possible that the AI Revolution might<br>bring some real benefits in the labor<br>market by reducing the present high<br>level of job polarization and income<br>polarization in Western societies<br>including aotearoa New Zealand so let me<br>explain<br>the computer Revolution that started<br>four decades ago in the early 1980s<br>brought economic benefits<br>disproportionately to the university<br>educated Elita professionals knowledge<br>workers like doctors lawyers Engineers<br>Wall Street Executives corporate<br>managers<br>um not forgetting of course University<br>professors we were the ones that<br>benefited disproportionately meanwhile<br>as computers spread many middle skill<br>workers<br>um Abel who had been able to to live a<br>middle-class lifestyle but without a<br>University degree lost their jobs to the<br>computers and were displaced downwards<br>into lower skilled jobs and lower<br>skilled incomes and the result was in a<br>polarization in the labor market a<br>shrinking of the middle class and a big<br>big rise in inequality of income and<br>wealth<br>in artero and New Zealand now the top<br>one percent in the wealth distribution<br>own around 25 of the national wealth<br>which is similar to Australia of course<br>that's relatively low share compared to<br>the top one percent in the United States<br>which is now around about 35 percent if<br>you can believe that<br>people who found themselves left behind<br>on lower and more insecure incomes on<br>zero hours contracts for example tended<br>to become angry depressed fearful<br>resentful ashamed humiliated<br>polling evidence on people's life<br>satisfaction shows a big increase in the<br>share of national populations feeling<br>dissatisfied with their lives just as an<br>example<br>um dissatisfied with their lives in the<br>past two decades in particular the CEO<br>of Gallup polling organization John<br>Clifton has recently published a book<br>with the telling title<br>blind spot the subtitle is the global<br>rise of unhappiness and how leaders<br>missed it how leaders missed the global<br>rise in unhappiness<br>many who saw themselves as Left Behind<br>started to support<br>the politicians who presented themselves<br>as Savior capital S savior figures who<br>railed against Elites even though they<br>were Elite themselves who railed against<br>Elites and promised their supporters<br>they would shut the borders and make the<br>country great again<br>this is at least a large part of the<br>story behind Trump and Boris Johnson and<br>brexit and the intense political<br>polarization and partisanship in most<br>western societies and it's also in large<br>part the story behind the re the rising<br>frequency of Social and Health<br>dysfunctions reported by analysts such<br>as Richard Wilkinson and Kate Pickett in<br>their book the spirit level and by Angus<br>Deaton and Anne case in their book<br>deaths of despair<br>the potential good news is that this<br>current AI tick revolution could bring<br>larger economic benefits to lower<br>skilled people than to the college<br>educated Elite and thereby help to<br>rebuild the middle class there is<br>already some fairly good empirical<br>evidence that lower skilled people can<br>benefit hugely and more than<br>high-skilled University graduates by<br>using GPT to for example summarize<br>literature on a certain topic to write a<br>coherent document to do medical analysis<br>to write legal briefs maybe even fly<br>planes all this without needing a<br>University degree<br>and that in turn may help to reduce the<br>level of income and wealth inequality<br>the degree of political polarization may<br>help to make Democratic institutions<br>work better to reverse what has been<br>called the Democratic recession that's<br>going on especially in the western world<br>but by the same token the expertise of<br>University graduates may be devalued<br>over time and they that is to say you<br>may lose some of your income and work<br>advantages relative to the rest of the<br>population and you may well not like<br>that but remember as you go forward the<br>society may become more harmonious if<br>there is a stronger middle class and<br>less income and job polarization than at<br>present so that's the potential good<br>news however one final point<br>when the engineering difficulties of<br>deploying Quantum Computing Quantum<br>Computing at scale have been solved and<br>they surely will be solved<br>then the harnessing of unlimited<br>processing power<br>from Quantum Computing to more efficient<br>learning algorithms might well cause<br>even more job displacement than we are<br>seeing now both in routine and<br>non-routine jobs<br>and then this combination of quantum<br>Computing and AI May well constitute<br>Jeffrey hinton's existential threat to<br>human civilization and to the biosphere<br>so AI plus Quantum Computing is<br>potential Mega bad news and it poses an<br>acute problem of how we are going to<br>govern this combination of AI and<br>Quantum computing<br>let me end by repeating Churchill's<br>three words speech by way of inspiration<br>never give in<br>and let me end by urging you to read<br>this excellent book by Max Harris<br>called the New Zealand project which<br>follows up some of the themes that the<br>chancellor was a very<br>um eloquently passionately addressing<br>just now thank you</p></main><footer style="margin-top: 2rem; background: #0001; padding: 2rem; text-align: center;"><p>We Are The University</p><ul style="list-style-type:
