faculty and<br>staff distinguished guests family<br>friends and most importantly my fellow<br>graduates we made it<br>I am so blessed and honored to stand<br>before you today and speak on behalf of<br>this graduate cohort and I really want<br>to thank the staff at the Wellington<br>School of Business and government for<br>giving me this opportunity<br>although it was a bit risky asking me to<br>do this when you know my history with<br>extension requests<br>but in all seriousness to our lecturers<br>and our tutors<br>thank you for surrounding us with your<br>knowledge expertise and guidance<br>throughout our time here<br>thank you especially to those academic<br>staff who went above and beyond for us<br>who gave us a passion for learning<br>inspired us made us excited to take our<br>skills into the real world<br>and to all the other staff at the<br>University from Librarians to<br>residential advisors to the admin staff<br>who had to deal with my extension<br>requests and to all those who have made<br>today possible thank you<br>thank you also to all our loved ones who<br>have helped us get here this achievement<br>is a testament to your encouragement and<br>support<br>to our friends thank you for being by<br>our side through it all bringing joy to<br>our everyday distracting us from<br>assignments and making this journey<br>Unforgettable<br>our flatmates who shared in the joys of<br>living in Maori overpriced Flats our<br>partners who have been our cheerleaders<br>and shoulders to cry on and our<br>classmates who have challenged us and<br>inspired us<br>to our families thank you for your<br>unwavering support your patience<br>guidance love and encouragement<br>thank you for being generous with your<br>time and your hugs for making sacrifices<br>and for believing in US<br>and to all those who are here this<br>afternoon we are so happy to have you<br>here to celebrate with us<br>I also just want to take a moment to<br>acknowledge those who can't be here<br>on a personal note I want to dedicate<br>this achievement to my grandfather my<br>papa<br>who passed away suddenly at the end of<br>my first year of University<br>Papa was and always will be my greatest<br>inspiration<br>he taught his grandchildren to not<br>always do our best and be proud of our<br>achievements but to remember how blessed<br>we are<br>he made sure we knew what a privilege it<br>is to receive an education<br>at eight years old he had to leave his<br>family behind in kiribus to travel to by<br>himself to Fiji so he could attend<br>school and learn English<br>and then 13 years later he moved to New<br>Zealand graduating with a bachelor of<br>Commerce from Victoria University in<br>1968.<br>I'm sure every graduate speaker who has<br>stood up here over the last three years<br>has mentioned it but particularly for<br>all of us graduating today covert has<br>affected our University experience<br>immensely<br>whether that's only having three weeks<br>of real University before having to<br>adapt to remote online learning<br>moving back out of Halls not being able<br>to attend classes in person or missing<br>out on quintessential University student<br>experiences<br>we've had to navigate the usual<br>challenges that come with studying at<br>University and living in Wellington<br>alongside a global pandemic<br>we have probably spent more time than<br>any other cohort past or future<br>isolated from our peers and sitting or<br>sleeping through zooms<br>but with adaptation and improvisation<br>from staff and students alike we stuck<br>it out and can be so proud of our<br>resilience<br>often we can create plans to get where<br>we're going we create this idea of what<br>our lives should and will be<br>but you don't plan for a global pandemic<br>or financial hardship<br>to lose a family member struggle with<br>your mental health change your degree<br>get injured or get sick<br>if you told me a couple of years ago<br>that I would spend most of my final year<br>of University and most of the Year<br>following in doctor's waiting rooms<br>hyperbaric chambers stuck in bed and<br>hooked up to heart monitors I would have<br>been devastated<br>but unless my second covert vaccine left<br>me with chronic heart issues so my plan<br>to have a fun-filled third year and then<br>started the job I had lined up got<br>thrown out the window<br>when something like this happens it is<br>so easy to feel like all your hard work<br>has been wasted<br>but I found that this challenge with<br>support of my family and my faith has<br>altered my perspective for the better<br>and taught me to take a step back from<br>when you go through a hard season where<br>there is no plan or you have a plan and<br>it gets thrown out the window<br>I urge you to have courage and reflect<br>inwards<br>find your purpose and strengthen your<br>relationships<br>there are so many people who will be<br>there for you and as life becomes busy<br>work hard for the people you care about<br>not one of us has had an easy ride to<br>get here and a piece of paper we've<br>received today is not only a testament<br>of our commitment to our studies but<br>also to part-time or even full-time<br>employment to extracurriculars to our<br>friends and our families and to our<br>health and well-being<br>the obstacles that we have conquered as<br>individuals and as a cohort to be here<br>today have given us skills and a<br>resilient spirit that will serve us well<br>in whatever we choose to pursue<br>embracing change with Open Hearts and<br>Adorn the bird with feathers so that it<br>may soar<br>the skills knowledge friendships<br>connections and experiences that we have<br>been adorned with during our time to<br>headingawaka are the feathers that will<br>allow us to soar as we embark on the<br>next chapter of Our Lives<br>as we boldly pursue our dreams moving<br>forward with confidence and<br>determination let us continue to learn<br>to grow and adapt<br>to challenge ourselves and to never lose<br>sight of our worth and potential<br>to my fellow Victoria University<br>graduates I congratulate you on this<br>incredible achievement I am so proud to<br>be graduating alongside you all today<br>and I cannot wait to see the impact that<br>we will make in the world thank you</p></main><footer style="margin-top: 2rem; background: #0001; padding: 2rem; text-align: center;"><p>We Are The University</p><ul
