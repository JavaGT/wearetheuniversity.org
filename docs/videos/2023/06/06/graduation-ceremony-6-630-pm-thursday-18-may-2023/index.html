indeed<br>beyond all around the globe who are<br>viewing these proceedings through our<br>before we begin our formalities however<br>I ask that you join me in just a moment<br>silence to acknowledge the very tragic<br>events earlier in the week in this hour<br>City<br>I'd now like to introduce you to the<br>chancellor of taharing of walk of<br>Victoria University of Wellington this<br>is a role that dates back to the Middle<br>Ages when the first universities were<br>established<br>the chancellor is the chair of the<br>University Council which is the<br>governing body responsible for setting<br>the University's strategic Direction<br>ladies and Gentlemen please welcome the<br>chancellor John Allen<br>in a manner in a row in our ewe namata<br>Waka uttamoto kotonou<br>toyamayo Koto Waka ringa Waka<br>tenakoto ten Koto Tena Koto katora<br>talofa lava Maloy Lele<br>bulovanaka and warm greetings to you all<br>it's my privilege as Chancellor of the<br>university to welcome you to this<br>celebration<br>it is a celebration of the achievements<br>of our graduates it's a recognition of<br>their resilience with all the challenges<br>that they have faced the hard work they<br>have undertaken the difficulties they<br>have triumphed over to be here tonight<br>and we're delighted you are here tonight<br>and we want to make this a real party to<br>recognize that resilience and this<br>achievement<br>we want to celebrate with your father<br>friends and family the people who've<br>supported you and enabled you to get<br>this far we want to recognize the<br>brain's trust behind me the academic<br>heart of our University who have<br>provoked you challenged you and enabled<br>you to achieve to your potential which<br>we are celebrating tonight and we want<br>to make a statement tonight about the<br>value of University education and of<br>universities in a city in a country in a<br>world that is increasingly<br>undervaluing them<br>and I don't mean simply they're not<br>investing enough but that is absolutely<br>true but second or more importantly that<br>in a world of fake news and conspiracy<br>theories in a world that has many many<br>many challenges we've just heard housing<br>crisis we know Mental Health crisis we<br>know General Health crisis we know<br>climate crisis we know War we know all<br>of these things and they're not academic<br>they're real and they're in our city and<br>in our country and in our world and we<br>need to address them and it's in times<br>like this times of challenge that<br>universities come into their own and<br>University graduates come into their own<br>why because in a time of conspiracy<br>theory you've been taught to research<br>analyze rise and assess facts in a time<br>of fake news you've been taught to think<br>for yourself<br>at a time in which we're addressing<br>problems of climate you're engaged in a<br>huge Wide International Community of of<br>capabilities that can be Unleashed to<br>address these Wicked problems<br>why because on a time in which we need<br>new stories New Hope New Vigor new<br>energy you and particularly in the<br>humanities and education faculties have<br>the capacity to be able to reignite our<br>storytelling you have the capacity to be<br>reigniting our younger people in their<br>education and you have the capacity to<br>transform this country into a more<br>prosperous a more tolerant a more<br>expressive and a more successful country<br>I do want to recognize that having that<br>power that power of Storytelling which<br>so many of you have been studying<br>whether in film or in theater or in<br>literature or in poetry<br>is a remarkable talent and a remarkable<br>skill but it makes you extraordinarily<br>dangerous people uh Ben oakry who's a<br>Nigerian author wrote in a little sort<br>of book a little while ago some some<br>things about storytelling some lessons<br>on storytelling and he said but where<br>the stories you tell or write<br>slowly quietly below the Sun the Waters<br>of Consciousness while you sleep they<br>are changing the world<br>you have the power to change the world<br>if you can change the story you have the<br>power to change the world if you can<br>redress the and you know the histories<br>of the world that are not accurate you<br>have the power to change the world if<br>you can provoke the populations of the<br>world to engage in issues which are<br>important in a way that they haven't<br>thought about before but that does carry<br>risk with it so to The Poets amongst you<br>can I say poetry is dangerous poetry is<br>marvelous poetry can change the planet<br>and we know the risks that poets take<br>because we've seen our colleague<br>tusciate not colleague but a member of a<br>person who's very closely associated<br>with our University to Seattle<br>and we know the risks that you run when<br>you write poetry about decolonization<br>reassessing the history of the Pacific<br>and of this place you know the reactions<br>that you can achieve as a consequence of<br>that the misunderstandings that can be<br>driven so telling stories is both<br>critically important and also dangerous<br>it requires courage<br>and the sort of Courage that it needs<br>comes from your learning here<br>it requires you to be prepared to stand<br>up and express yourselves based on that<br>ability to think for yourselves and to<br>advocate<br>it requires you to be able to research<br>and connect in community for strength to<br>be able to hold a position when it is<br>not a popular position<br>it requires you to recognize what we<br>call academic freedom or critical<br>conscience of society to have the sort<br>of building blocks of academic<br>excellence in our University<br>that we have an obligation because of<br>our education because of this University<br>education to speak truth to power even<br>when it is uncomfortable<br>now I know when you talk about bravery<br>and courage and all those sorts of<br>things people sort of think about<br>heroics on the wall you know of our<br>armed forces or things like that I know<br>they do but often it is not that you<br>called who many of you will know as an<br>author and a poet and photographer wrote<br>a wonderful essay called resistance uh<br>in his uh his book Black Pages which is<br>a book of essays and he said that in<br>fact most courage nowadays is simply<br>about bearing witness being willing to<br>Bear witness that is to stand up and<br>speak at a time when the world is going<br>to hell now that's what he said I<br>wouldn't have used that language<br>necessarily and probably shouldn't have<br>on live stream<br>but nonetheless<br>what he was saying is it's just we just<br>need to stand we just need to speak we<br>just need to use the skills that we've<br>had from our University we just need to<br>apply what we know to be true<br>and we can transform our communities and<br>our cities and our countries and this<br>world<br>so can I simply say this the humanities<br>are the heart of our University I know<br>some people think they're ornamental I<br>know some think people don't think<br>they're relevant anymore I know some<br>people don't think you can get a job<br>with them they're wrong they're wrong<br>they're wrong they're wrong<br>the humanities matter<br>they matter because they celebrate lived<br>experience they matter because they<br>unders help us understand ourselves and<br>others they matter because they help us<br>find joy in living and most importantly<br>as I've said they matter because they<br>enable us to tell new stories so<br>whatever you have been doing whatever<br>discipline you have been studying<br>I know that you will have the tehringa<br>Waka attitude which is an attitude to<br>party hard<br>to celebrate hard<br>but also a confidence to stand up<br>and be involved because the reality is<br>that indifference in the face of the<br>challenges that we currently are dealing<br>with is not an option<br>indifference is not a tehringa walker<br>attitude you didn't see any difference<br>in naito Era when they were here with<br>the Kappa Haka performance<br>you didn't see a difference what you saw<br>was commitment standing confidence you<br>saw attitude you saw involvement<br>that's what I know you are capable of<br>that's what I know our wonderful<br>academics here have trained you and<br>supported you to be capable of and that<br>is what we need to transform and support<br>necessary change in our society and in<br>our world can I congratulate you on your<br>achievements can I say how fantastic it<br>is that you are now going to be part of<br>that wider community of Scholars that is<br>this University and I'm going to close<br>with a short poem uh by a part called<br>Glenn colhoun it's not a short poem<br>actually it's a quite a long poem but<br>I'm only going to use a few lines of it<br>and Glenn is a doctor and he went up to<br>the Far North with Napoli uh for a while<br>and he wrote a great book of poetry<br>called The Art of standing upright uh<br>the art of standing upright and this<br>poem which is by that name he says this<br>the art of standing upright here that is<br>here in aotearoa New Zealand is the art<br>of standing on two feet<br>one is for holding on<br>and the other is for letting go<br>I thought no no I got the vibe uh the<br>vibe was my God that was wonderful that<br>was almost as electric as the Knight who<br>era presentation that was the sort of<br>vibe I got let me tell you why I think<br>that's so fantastic one because it says<br>if you want to make a difference in this<br>world you've got to stand for something<br>you've got to be prepared to stand up<br>and you've got to be prepared to be seen<br>two it says you've got to Anchor<br>yourself on one leg in the cultures and<br>histories and families that have made<br>you who you are and you never forget<br>that and you never lose that because<br>that is your strength to stand and then<br>you have to have the ability to step off<br>that strength into the risks and<br>challenges of the world<br>you've got to be prepared to confront<br>change confront difference and confront<br>challenge<br>and when you do that anything is<br>possible and with this cohort I believe<br>we have real possibility and potential<br>for positive change in aotearoa New<br>the chancellor will now recognize the<br>graduates as listed in the graduation<br>program<br>well all the degree diploma and<br>certificate graduates please stand up<br>it's quite an important but it's when<br>you actually sort of get formally<br>so if you're able standing is good<br>I John Allen Chancellor of tehering a<br>walk at Victoria University of<br>Wellington would like to formally<br>recognize the persons whose names are<br>entered in the presentation of graduates<br>the degrees diplomas and certificates<br>they're appearing and confirm that they<br>have been admitted to these degrees<br>diplomas and certificates in this<br>University<br>congratulations to you all<br>as graduates you may now put on your<br>trenches<br>foreign<br>we are now going to move on to honoring<br>the graduates listed in your program<br>each graduate will be called to the<br>stage to be congratulated beginning with<br>the award of the degree of doctor of<br>philosophy<br>the vice Chancellor Professor Nick Smith<br>will read the summaries the chancellor<br>so we've just heard the chancellor talk<br>with<br>passion with prose with poetry around<br>the contributions that University makes<br>he's talked about commitment<br>and standing for something<br>and it's my great pleasure to be able to<br>introduce our doctoral candidates who<br>have been doing exactly that for three<br>plus years universities have a<br>fundamental role in enriching knowledge<br>creativity in diverse ways of<br>understanding the world<br>and research is one of those<br>contributions that can make such a<br>fundamental difference to society<br>our doctoral graduates achieve<br>academically at the very highest level<br>and their research as we will see has<br>provided insights into some of the major<br>challenging questions that Society faces<br>it's increasingly difficult in the<br>polarized world that we live in to<br>sometimes separate expertise from<br>opinion and for that reason these<br>graduates have spent several years doing<br>exactly that as a process of learning<br>their craft<br>in doing that they can help us<br>understand the past the present<br>and I think most excitingly the possible<br>Futures though independent thinkers and<br>makers who are active and engage Global<br>Citizens and we're very proud of what<br>they've done while at tahiringo Waka and<br>we're very much looking forward to what<br>they will do in their post-university<br>life the short citations that I will<br>share now give only a glimpse of the<br>work of the toil of the focus of the<br>commitment<br>but also of the impact and innovation of<br>their work but they do however show
