truly an honor to be standing here<br>today amongst a cohort of inspiring<br>talented and diligent individuals<br>I'd like to start by saying<br>congratulations<br>what a huge achievement<br>being here this afternoon whether in<br>person or online is not only a<br>reflection of your hard work<br>but also your perseverance resilience<br>and adaptability<br>it goes without saying these past three<br>years have been extremely difficult<br>and left us with probably the most<br>unique University experience ever<br>I know many of us myself included were<br>just settling into our new University<br>life<br>getting used to the Wellington weather<br>and experiencing the odd Shake<br>when we were told we had just 48 hours<br>to get home<br>I remember the whole floor of my hall of<br>residence<br>who for the last four weeks had been<br>buzzing with excitement<br>fall completely silent as we watch the<br>announcement on our common room TV<br>there were tears hugs and hopes would be<br>back soon<br>since then we've all battled the<br>transition to online learning<br>the social isolation<br>the uncertainty<br>the struggle of finding alternative<br>materials and of course the occasional<br>however I'm sure that each of us have<br>encountered our own obstacles along the<br>way<br>I admire those who have navigated<br>Parenthood while studying<br>those who are essential workers<br>those<br>sorry those who are pursuing high-level<br>sport or creative endeavors<br>those who are caring for family<br>those suffering from illnesses<br>and those studying remotely<br>whether it took you three four five or<br>even 10 years you should all be so proud<br>of yourselves<br>that being said I believe our<br>accomplishments today<br>are also a testament to those to the<br>support of those around us<br>at the end of last year I had my 21st<br>birthday<br>my mum spoke about the village I had had<br>behind me for the last 21 years<br>she said nakeda and I would have never<br>made it if we didn't and had such fun<br>along the way if we didn't have your<br>support and encouragement<br>as much as I hate to admit you're right<br>mum you are<br>so I'd like to take a moment to say<br>thank you to those who have been a part<br>of my Village and yours<br>to the Keystone Trust<br>thank you for believing in me<br>without you studying at Victoria would<br>have remained a distant dream of mine<br>you have provided opportunities<br>knowledge and connections that will last<br>to our family and friends who have<br>become family<br>whether in the audience tonight watching<br>online<br>or watching at 4 30 a.m in Spain hi<br>Linda and Jack<br>thank you<br>I can assure you we do appreciate your<br>patience and understanding when we are<br>so stressed after leaving yet another<br>thank you to our fellow classmates<br>for providing the opportunity to learn<br>and collaborate together<br>and of course for staying so late in the<br>library
