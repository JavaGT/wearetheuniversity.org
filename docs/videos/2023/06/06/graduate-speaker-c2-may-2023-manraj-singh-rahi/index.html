Graduate address<br>it is an honor to be here today<br>and give this address looking out at the<br>crowd it is so wonderful to see so many<br>friendly faces and it reminds me just<br>how lucky I am to be part of such an<br>awesome group of humans<br>starting off this degree I never would<br>have dreamed that our time here would<br>have been marked by pandemics and<br>protest occupations<br>all I knew at the start was that the<br>prospect of five years in this place was<br>utterly daunting<br>now that we are on the other side it<br>could not have gone faster<br>but when it came to writing the speech<br>it turned out to be a harder Endeavor<br>than I imagined<br>you would think that after five years at<br>University surviving contract law bell<br>curves and 8 30 lectures very few things<br>would be insurmountable<br>but how could I possibly say anything of<br>note to a room full of people who have<br>all traversed their own path to this<br>momentous occasion each of you<br>overcoming obstacles of your own<br>but hopefully you'll be pleased to know<br>that I have removed the socratic<br>questions I plan to use to keep you all<br>engaged today<br>and I am reassured by the fact that the<br>last time I spoke in an event that<br>celebrated our cohort's success it<br>certainly ended very well<br>I thought that perhaps I should be<br>future focused and did not take heed of<br>Robert's advice and asked chat GPT to<br>write this speech for me<br>unfortunately the only suggestions it<br>had to make was a generic be proud of<br>your success and a reminder that one day<br>AI will do our jobs for us<br>so instead of doing that armed with<br>neither notes Bank nor Sudoku I did what<br>any self-respecting law student would<br>and I turned to legislation<br>I can tell you that legislation tells<br>you two key things about tertiary<br>education it requires that we should<br>have fostered our skills to be skilled<br>and knowledgeable about population<br>but more importantly being at<br>tahirangawaka should enable us to<br>contribute to the development of<br>cultural and intellectual life in<br>aotearoa<br>so to assess my degree against this<br>rubric it is time to reflect<br>let's see at my time at University<br>whether this held up<br>there is no doubt that this university<br>has filled us with the Knowledge and<br>Skills that was so clearly intended for<br>that goes without question<br>so the first thank you tonight goes to<br>the lecturers sat behind me<br>thank you for dedicating your lives to<br>helping grow a bunch of little kids into<br>real adults<br>while I may not remember every single<br>word you've said to me I will never<br>forget and I think I speak for all of us<br>the experiences that we've had in your<br>classroom the ways that you have<br>challenged us<br>and most importantly we will be further<br>grateful for helping our best interests<br>at heart always<br>but University is also a chance for us<br>to grow personally<br>and that has to come from outside the<br>lecture theater<br>whether it be talking to friends in the<br>corridor or hushed Whispers on the third<br>floor of the library or maybe even<br>catching up with friends at a law<br>student Society event I have found that<br>my time at Victoria has been richest<br>when I am learning from those around me<br>so therefore to my friends<br>whether you were there from day one or<br>we've only recently Met You Know Who You<br>Are<br>your passions your tenacity and your<br>humor have been the greatest support<br>when things got tough<br>this degree and indeed the last five<br>years would have been immeasurably more<br>difficult without it<br>I must also thank some very special<br>people tonight my family<br>those of you who have traveled to be<br>here or those of you who are watching<br>from afar<br>thank you for being my biggest<br>supporters<br>it means so much to have you here today<br>because this achievement is as much mine<br>as it is yours<br>in particular to my parents<br>thank you for the kind hugs the warm<br>they have been everything I needed to be<br>here today<br>without you and your constant wisdom I<br>certainly would have lost my way on this<br>journey<br>but I want to finish by looking back at<br>that other legislative goal our<br>contribution to society<br>now it has become time for each of us to<br>go and reap the rewards of our hard work<br>as we move forward from this day let us<br>remember that the dedication that<br>brought us here<br>but let us also remember the<br>responsibility that comes with our<br>education<br>a degree is a demonstration of<br>commitment perseverance and passion<br>and what comes to mind now is a line<br>from the guru granth sahib<br>Jaco<br>B<br>so when we do things that aren't<br>meritorious we find Our Lives will be<br>lacking<br>but doing virtuous Deeds<br>creates Harmony in the world<br>so I ask that with that determination<br>we go forward<br>so to my fellow graduates I challenge<br>you today to find that strength to use<br>your education not just to succeed<br>but to make a difference in the world<br>use your knowledge to fight for those<br>who are marginalized to give voice to<br>the voiceless and to stand up for what<br>is right especially when it's difficult<br>remember that the privilege of Education<br>comes with a responsibility to use that<br>education for the greater good<br>but to do so most importantly with the<br>utmost humility<br>empathy and compassion<br>congratulations once again I wish you<br>all the best as you embark on this next<br>chapter of your lives and I cannot wait</p></main><footer style="margin-top: 2rem; background: #0001; padding: 2rem; text-align: center;"><p>We Are The
