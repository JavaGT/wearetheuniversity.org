after<br>hittingawaka uh it's my great pleasure<br>to welcome everybody here today it's<br>also my great pleasure to introduce<br>Professor Nick long when you read bios<br>of our academics you see people who are<br>brilliant thinkers and great<br>contributors to technology you see<br>people who are Builders of community and<br>people who have built that community<br>over many generations and you also see<br>people who have taken their ideas and<br>bought them through a reality that<br>transcends the proverbial Ivory Tower<br>and brought them out into a context<br>where they can add enormous value<br>and I think what we're going to see<br>tonight is someone who has done all<br>three of those achievements and is that<br>quintessential modern academic<br>as you will hear and I'm only reading<br>from the CV notes and I'm continuing to<br>live vicariously through those<br>achievements Nick is not only an<br>extraordinary scientist he's a leader of<br>what is described as we walk through one<br>of the jewels and the crown of the<br>University<br>and as I've been promised by Nick<br>himself just a few minutes ago there's<br>going to be a fascinating exploration of<br>the use of of Technology not just<br>terrestrial technology but<br>extraterrestrial technology as we move<br>into space and I think that's both a<br>reality and also a metaphor for Nick's<br>own career and what we're about to hear<br>he's promised me there's going to be<br>really good news at about 6 45 so I'm<br>awaited with baited breath but until<br>then with no further Ado it's my great<br>pleasure to welcome Nick long to give us<br>thank you very much Vice Chancellor for<br>those warm words<br>um just a few quick acknowledgments<br>before I begin I'd like to acknowledge<br>my wife Jane who does a lot of extra<br>work in supporting my career she does<br>the extra work when I have to travel and<br>do those other duties so she's someone<br>who has really sacrificed<br>um<br>uh thanks to all my colleagues at<br>Victoria and at Robinson uh it really is<br>a team effort out there what I'm going<br>to talk about is very much about what<br>our team has done over the years some of<br>it will be my particular take on things<br>in my particular work but<br>um it's it's all been very much a team<br>effort it's been my great privilege to<br>be the director of Robinson Research<br>Institute since 2016 and I work with an<br>absolutely fantastic group of very<br>talented people<br>this is an old photo it's there's now<br>about twice as many as people as uh here<br>it's difficult to get us all together in<br>one place now because we're actually<br>across three sites so getting all about<br>80 of us together as as somewhat<br>difficult we focus back through<br>Industrial Research limited and back to<br>the dsir for those who know that so the<br>team was set up<br>when Bill Robinson was the director of<br>the physics and Engineering laboratory<br>we do Mission orientated research on<br>electromagnetic Technologies and<br>materials Technologies we do way more<br>than I could possibly talk about tonight<br>so I'll concentrate on the<br>superconductivity which is where we have<br>our International reputation<br>um so first of all superconductivity<br>um was discovered in 1911 by cameling<br>Honest a Dutchman<br>and it was truly surprising nobody at<br>all predicted that the resistance of<br>material could drop to zero<br>and cameling honest immediately thought<br>what is this good for so that's a phrase<br>of our PVC esan what's what are you good<br>for what is our research good for<br>gambling honest I realized maybe he<br>could make very strong magnets using<br>this material which could conduct<br>electricity without any resistance<br>unfortunately he had the wrong type of<br>superconductors so it took a long time<br>actually until the right right kind of<br>superconductors were discovered and<br>there weren't useful magnets until about<br>the 1960s<br>um<br>so what was found actually<br>superconductivity is not that rare a lot<br>of the elements on the periodic table<br>are superconductors and a lot more of<br>them are superconductor superconductors<br>under pressure in particular or in<br>particular forms you don't have to<br>memorize any of these slides there's not<br>going to be a test at the end so just<br>enjoy the pictures there's there's one<br>or two equations which I couldn't resist<br>putting in<br>so there are a lot of<br>superconducting materials have been<br>discovered over the years this is a<br>timeline<br>um most importantly for our group the<br>so-called high temperature<br>superconductors were discovered in the<br>1980s about 1987<br>and the team then at dsir made some<br>important discoveries and and a team was<br>formed around that<br>um<br>there are many many of these materials<br>very very few of them are actually<br>useful as wires and this is a<br>characteristic of any technology it's<br>there are many things you can do but<br>actually making them useful in the world<br>is is a different story so we'll talk<br>about it about that during the the talk<br>tonight so out of these materials only<br>about five of them form wires that you<br>could actually buy commercially and the<br>main one I'll talk about tonight one of<br>the high temperature superconductors is<br>the atrium barium copper oxide<br>superconductor which we've been involved<br>in the wire development of that we also<br>were involved in developing the bisco<br>materials you'll see some of these<br>materials are getting closer to room<br>temperature but they're under very high<br>pressure so again they're more of<br>scientific interest not of practical<br>interest<br>um so ybco this is the crystal structure<br>so it's a ceramic material a bit like a<br>coffee cup but it has this crystal<br>structure the superconductivity occurs<br>in the copper oxide planes so the<br>electrons move through those planes in<br>this superconducting state<br>it's not easy to come up with an analogy<br>of super conductivity that's uh you know<br>that's that's easy to explain and is<br>accurate it's a Quantum phenomenon a<br>Quantum phenomenon of many electrons all<br>acting together<br>but nonetheless I'll have a go so for<br>the first time ever here's the an<br>analogy imagine trying to get through a<br>crowded concert and getting through that<br>crowd you keep bumping into things and<br>bumping into things is losing energy<br>it's resistance so that's our normal<br>conduction so is there another way to do<br>the conduction well you can crowd sick<br>uh so it's a Cooperative Behavior<br>everybody else is helping you get<br>through and you're not bumping into<br>anybody and for the Nerds it's two<br>electrons together uh do the crowd<br>surfing<br>um so that's that's super conductivity<br>what that gives you is a material that<br>can conduct without resistance in the DC<br>State and very importantly it can<br>conduct at very very high current<br>densities so that's actually often the<br>most useful property so here we have<br>modeled for us a super inductant cable<br>and in the right hand and in the left<br>are the two copper cables so those<br>copper cables would carry about a<br>thousand amps the superconducting cable<br>depending on the conditions can carry a<br>couple of thousand amps at very low<br>temperatures even more maybe ten<br>thousand amps so you can see the value<br>in that in shrinking the size of such<br>machines<br>now just to cover off one thing you the<br>disadvantage that I'm sure you're all<br>aware of is you have to call the<br>superconductors so people always bring<br>this up isn't it difficult to call<br>superconductors well what you do is you<br>buy a refrigerator<br>um so we buy refrigerators they're more<br>expensive than your ones but they work<br>essentially just the same they have a<br>thermodynamic cycle we attach the the<br>cold end of them to say a coil of the<br>superconductor that we want to cool down<br>and this works fine the suit the<br>refrigerators are very reliable so that<br>is not a uh a problem a fundamental<br>problem in restricting this technology<br>it is something that has to be taken<br>into account<br>um so the materials were discovered and<br>then we did a lot of work developing<br>them into wires we did a lot of work and<br>collaboration with American<br>superconductor in the United States but<br>we've also worked with other wire<br>companies<br>and so today we can buy this wire this<br>is the ybco wire it looks just a bit<br>like a thin copper film that's because<br>it has copper on the outside so the<br>structure of it is actually a complex<br>layered structure and that's because the<br>crystals in the material have to be very<br>well lined up so you have to create<br>buffer layers on which the crystal can<br>grow to a very high accuracy and then on<br>the outside you protect it with layers<br>of silver and copper the superconducting<br>layer itself is only about one to two<br>microns thick so it is very very thin<br>but it carries that incredible current<br>density so a centimeter width of this<br>wire can depending on the circumstances<br>carry 500 amps or more<br>so this wire it's made by a vacuum<br>deposition systems usually a sort of<br>reel-to-reel process so we've worked on<br>some of those processes and<br>so then what we often do is we want to<br>measure<br>the critical current<br>capacity of the wire and to do that we<br>developed what we call our supercurrent<br>measurement system so this was developed<br>particularly by Nick Strickland and<br>Stuart wimbush<br>and we now sell the system actually<br>commercially we've sold a couple of<br>systems and here's the good news we're<br>going to sell three systems this year so<br>the good news is coming early for the<br>vice Chancellor<br>our part of this we make the measurement<br>system and our sister company HDs 110<br>make the magnet the measurement system<br>is worth about four hundred thousand<br>dollars income to us so we're going to<br>do three we have to deliver three by<br>Christmas but that's great that we've<br>got some<br>um so what we do is the sample is put in<br>the magnetic field you pass a current<br>through it and then you rotate the<br>sample so what is of interest is the<br>current capacity is limited it's not<br>infinite in these materials so we need<br>to know where that limit is<br>um and it's limited by the size of the<br>magnetic field<br>the angle that it's rotated to with this<br>crystal structure and the temperature<br>and then we collect a whole lot of data<br>like this<br>and I particularly became interested in<br>this data so what you can see this is a<br>whole range of data at different<br>temperatures but if you just sort of<br>look in the middle you can see there's a<br>peak structure in there<br>so when we started doing this work I was<br>particularly interested in this because<br>I thought people don't really understand<br>these Peak structures and other<br>structures that people had and I didn't<br>believe what they were saying so if<br>you've got a peak what you normally do<br>in physics is fit a bell curve that's<br>what everybody does so this is a toy<br>which illustrates how you get a bell<br>curve in this case the metal balls are<br>being passed through a little grid and<br>they spread out and they form the bell<br>curve<br>um so they're very common bell curves uh<br>and throughout nature<br>um and so if you look at them as X so<br>here's a couple of equations uh you get<br>this what we call a normal distribution<br>um or sometimes called a gaussian<br>distribution<br>um but we were measuring with angle uh<br>so we weren't measuring with with X<br>whatever X might be so you can ask<br>another question you can ask what angle<br>on average did those balls travel<br>through before they they drop down into<br>that distribution and if you ask that<br>question what is that distribution you<br>get this rather strange<br>equation<br>which can be derived with a little bit<br>of mathematics it looks a bit odd so it<br>looks a little bit like a gaussian but<br>as the variance gets large you get these<br>strange shoulder shapes to it and then I<br>took various data and I fitted this and<br>it worked so this was a very nice<br>explanation of the physics of of how<br>this is limited so I was very proud of<br>this and I thought everybody is going to<br>love this in the field and you know I'm<br>going to get a zillion citations<br>actually most people didn't understand<br>it and some people were openly hostile<br>they did not want they did not want<br>they did not want bell curves in their<br>superconductors they wanted something<br>much much fancier and that was not good<br>enough<br>so um and some people of course loved it<br>and uh so those are the ones I I<br>remember<br>um<br>so we then go from wire to coils<br>um so we now now need to sort of start<br>moving towards magnets and so on so we<br>developed a coil winding at The<br>Institute of various types and you can<br>see here what we call Pancake coils<br>solenoid coils the long uh coil the the<br>sort of long cylinder on the left there<br>saddle coils which can be used for<br>things like Motors in this in the center<br>there and I'll just briefly mention in<br>2004 we spun out a company HTS 110 so<br>they since then have been very<br>successful making bespoke magnets for<br>different applications you know very<br>high-end scientific applications<br>throughout the world so they've produced<br>some really unique magnets and done<br>extremely well and we continue to work<br>with them<br>um we also developed uh something I was<br>quite involved in something called Rebel<br>cables so a single wire can carry<br>usually maybe 200 amps depending on the<br>conditions and for large machines you<br>often want to conductor which can carry<br>thousands of amps so if you think of a<br>very large motor or Transformer you want<br>thousands of amps so to take that wire<br>and make it into a cable we had to<br>develop<br>this technology called verbal cables you<br>have to actually make the wire into a<br>serpentine shape and then wind it to<br>sort of weave it together so that was<br>very uh<br>challenging project I luckily hired some<br>very good Engineers I think I hired the<br>two best engineers in New Zealand so<br>Peter Beck made the first machines and<br>Rod Badcock made the the second set of<br>machines to do that<br>and then we go on to constructing<br>magnets and devices so here you can see<br>a set of coils being put together into a<br>magnet which I'll talk about briefly<br>so<br>so the first application of this<br>technology what is it good for and and<br>what are we working towards uh is MRI<br>technology so this was probably the<br>first technology with superconductors<br>were used that made an impact on the<br>public so in the 1960s and 70s they were<br>used for scientific purposes but the<br>public would have first encountered them<br>probably in the late 1980s 1990s with<br>MRI machines so MRI is a technique where<br>the signal comes from actually the water<br>molecules the nuclei of water molecules<br>in your body so it's completely benign<br>you can have as many MRIs as you like<br>there's no effect it can give you very<br>high resolution data on your soft<br>tissues and even on the functioning of<br>those soft tissues so it's a very active<br>area of research where people are<br>continually pushing the boundaries of<br>resolution and what you can diagnose<br>from from MRI<br>so we've made first of all two small<br>portable systems of MRI so this<br>demonstrated that we could use this new<br>superconducting wire with the cryo<br>coolers and we could get good quality<br>images<br>the first system actually was the lower<br>system 1.5 Tesla system was for<br>extremity MRI was the application we had<br>in mind so that's Imaging you know hands<br>or arms feet<br>and then we built a subsequent system<br>which was aimed at what's called<br>pre-clinical so this is Imaging for<br>small animals and so on so they're very<br>successful technically they didn't quite<br>find a market for them<br>so we then went on to another project<br>this is a project we've just completed<br>over the last couple of weeks actually<br>a head-only functional MRI so functional<br>means it can see actual changes in the<br>brain and image those as they're<br>happening and what's unique about it is<br>this idea of the the magnet just comes<br>down over your head only so it's a<br>little bit like a helmet and there's<br>actually a port through which you can<br>see so that means you can read things<br>look at things while you're having an<br>MRI done your arms and legs are also<br>about free so you could possibly play<br>the piano something like that people can<br>then image what's going on so the um you<br>know the research<br>capacity of this machine is is and<br>potential is really quite extraordinary<br>so that took a number of years and this<br>is good news for esan the the magnet is<br>in Minnesota and it's working uh so<br>congratulations to Ben Parkinson and his<br>team uh for getting that over there and<br>and getting it work working so I think<br>the potential of this is is really<br>enormous and possibly even therapy I can<br>imagine actually being able to<br>um you know look at changes in the brain<br>as as you're doing particular therapy<br>even if you want to really let your<br>um now I'd like to talk about fusion and<br>this possibility of putting the sun in a<br>bottle<br>and this is something which is right now<br>driving the whole superconductor<br>industry uh quite strongly and people<br>are constructing these very Space Age<br>looking<br>um tokamax in order to test<br>confinement plasmas at very very high<br>temperatures some of you may know<br>there's the ETA project so this is a<br>long-running international project it's<br>a 20 billion Euro project in the south<br>of France they're also building this<br>superconducting magnets and a<br>superconducting Tokamak their magnets<br>are much bigger than ours as you can see<br>and I don't think we'd risk the finances<br>to try and build one of these<br>um now if you've followed Fusion you may<br>have heard that Fusion is never going to<br>happen so I thought I'd just um sort of<br>address that issue a little bit broadly<br>because it's sort of quick goes to the<br>question of what research do we do and<br>and how do we evaluate whether we should<br>be doing research or not you know how do<br>we select projects so I thought I'd talk<br>about that a little bit you know this<br>question when will we have that<br>technology<br>so the the way I'd like to explain this<br>to the staff at Robinson is we need to<br>think about our technology and that's<br>the new technology that we're creating<br>but it's also the old technologies that<br>have to go with it so for example we<br>need cry callers we need power supplies<br>uh we need vacuum systems so there's<br>always old technology that fits in with<br>the the new technology<br>and then you have to think about the<br>market in the broader sense the value<br>that you're bringing to people you know<br>how are people going to use this why are<br>they going to change their behavior to<br>use technology the way you think they<br>should use technology and that may be<br>very broad it may be something<br>environmental even it doesn't have to be<br>a product but somebody has to change<br>their behavior and support what you're<br>doing in a sustainable way and then you<br>have to implement it so you need the<br>business models you need intellectual<br>property you need the Manufacturing<br>Technologies to do something and and<br>these things have to work together so<br>part of my job as the Director is to<br>think holistically about what we're<br>doing and whether it's feasible what<br>we're working on we can bring these<br>things together develop technology with<br>a view to how it can be implemented I<br>just want to give you one fun example<br>because I think it's humorous I guess<br>the wheel was invented in 4000 BC<br>uh the bag was invented in 3000 BC a<br>useful bag with wheels was only invented<br>in 2080 and this is really true<br>um I was at Vic house<br>in my first year of University I had a<br>bag with wheels that were completely<br>useless wheels of course they broke they<br>buckled I had to haul my bag down to the<br>railway station I remember you'd<br>carry a bag in one arm and get tired and<br>you change the other arm so it was<br>really true what what changed though um<br>if you think about what changed<br>obviously<br>materials have changed there are better<br>Plastics tougher Plastics which can<br>survive as those Wheels they're better<br>and cheaper Manufacturing Technologies<br>which can produce them at scale this<br>better design in here and I think the<br>market has probably changed you know<br>this could be taken up quickly there's a<br>mass Market in transportation and<br>everybody's trundling these things<br>around the airports of the world so what<br>happens in technology is often a bit<br>unpredictable and it changes uh with<br>with all of these factors<br>so there are now Fusion companies that<br>think they're really going to do it<br>they're going to make fusion devices<br>which are smaller more compact higher<br>fields and they can iterate faster and<br>they've got a lot of money so this one<br>in particular out of MIT has raised<br>about two billion dollars to do this<br>um this is their coil so it's much<br>smaller than<br>um those heater coils which were you<br>know this size of more than the size of<br>this room<br>um so uh it's this is about three meters<br>you can see the cryo coolers connected<br>to this<br>um I mentioned this in particular<br>because uh some of Robinson technology<br>is going into this coil we're working to<br>integrate our temperature<br>sensing technology in order to uh<br>monitor the coils and make sure that no<br>part of them is heating up so we've been<br>working with a commonwealth Fusion<br>systems in Boston for about four or five<br>years now on different aspects and they<br>are moving very fast so it's a very<br>exciting partner to be working with for<br>The Institute<br>there are also many other private<br>companies you'd be surprised how many<br>I'm surprised how many there are I've<br>just put one down the list there and<br>watch the space New Zealand so I don't<br>want to steal anyone's Thunder but<br>um something may be announced<br>um<br>I'd like to move uh move on now to<br>talking about electric aircraft and this<br>is a picture you may have seen recently<br>in New Zealand announcing that they are<br>really going to be pushing electric<br>aircraft in order to get to zero carbon<br>um now this uh the aircraft here that<br>you're looking at a a small you know<br>they'll take uh you know half a dozen uh<br>passengers maybe uh or so<br>um and so Battery Technology can work<br>reasonably well at that scale as long as<br>they're short distance as well so a few<br>passengers short distance maybe going to<br>Nelson uh there's not uh batteries can<br>possibly work but as you scale up you<br>have to think differently and what you<br>need is something much more like the<br>Toyota Prius type system so you're going<br>to need a fuel and it's going to have to<br>be carbon neutral or carbon free so it<br>might be hydrogen or ammonia or some<br>other carbon neutral Fuel and then<br>you'll have a motor but like in the<br>Prius the motor actually works more as a<br>generator so you can think you've got to<br>have a generator which will generate<br>electricity you'll have batteries to<br>manage power but you don't want too many<br>batteries and then you want Motors that<br>actually drive and the Prius Drive the<br>wheels and an aircraft Drive the the<br>turbo fans<br>so you end up with something Concepts a<br>bit more like this so these are two<br>concepts being promoted by NASA<br>um so in which you may have a number of<br>um turbo generators distributed uh in<br>the aircraft and then a number of<br>superconducting motor driven fans so you<br>use superconductors in both the<br>generators and in the um Motors to drive<br>the fans and with this technology you<br>can actually have you know that 737 and<br>above class aircraft are becoming<br>Electric<br>so the fundamental reason is that<br>current density so here's a just a<br>comparison of of two Motors these<br>actually ship Motors but a conventional<br>motor at 36 megawatts and a<br>superconducting motor at the same rating<br>so you can cut down well over half the<br>weight by taking out all the iron and<br>copper in a conventional motor and<br>replacing it with those superconductors<br>so even though there is an overhead with<br>the refrigeration it's more than made up<br>for by taking out that iron and weight<br>and the engineers working on this are<br>convinced among themselves that<br>superconducting Motors are the only way<br>um so this is the concept we're working<br>on<br>um so a little bit more to<br>um uh for the technically minded to<br>understand<br>um so a basic alternator you can think<br>of it as a magnet rotating<br>Insider a a stator wire and then you can<br>think of adding a yoke which means just<br>you know some iron which extends where<br>that field is projected and then you can<br>extend that yoke into three dimensions<br>extend it a little bit more<br>and then you can take the very<br>interesting step of actually taking the<br>magnet outside the stator wire so the<br>source of the field becomes on the<br>outside and it can become Static so<br>that's a big Advantage so the inner<br>rotor can now be a piece of iron which<br>can rotate extremely fast and be very<br>stable and our superconductor can be<br>static on the outside<br>um so um rod and his team have been<br>building this motor over the last few<br>years this is what it looks like in<br>actuality so the white wires there you<br>know the the white insulation those are<br>those stator wires<br>um you know on the in which the the<br>rotor is going to rotate and on the<br>right hand side there is the steel rotor<br>which will rotate at many tens of<br>thousands of RPM<br>and here's the team with the magnets uh<br>put together so it's just being tested<br>this week actually I checked in with the<br>team they didn't have any data for me to<br>present but it's it's really a fantastic<br>achievement to get this going<br>um so uh Rod here he look he looks like<br>he's holding a part that's been left<br>over when they've put it together but<br>actually that's the superconducting<br>coil which goes into the the center of<br>the magnet there and on the outside of<br>um one of other Transportation<br>application I'd just like to mention uh<br>this goes back away probably uh 10 years<br>or may have started 10 years ago<br>actually we worked on a traction<br>Transformer so this is a train<br>transformer for the Chinese Railways so<br>this is an excellent application of<br>superconductors for exactly the same<br>reason so trains have large Transformers<br>on them these high-speed trains they're<br>about six point MVA rating and with<br>superconductors you can take out a lot<br>of the volume a lot of the mass you can<br>increase the overall efficiency<br>and so hence actually have more capacity<br>on the train to carry passengers rather<br>than carrying the weight of electrical<br>equipment<br>um so this project has been somewhat<br>stalled on the the Chinese side but we<br>came up with an excellent design for<br>this and uh<br>uh it was yeah we<br>what else can I say we did we did some<br>very good work and developing that that<br>design and hopefully this will um come<br>now I'd like to talk about<br>superconductors in space so because of<br>this quality of superconductors having<br>much higher power density and being<br>lighter weight and less mass than<br>conventional conductors you might think<br>they're very good to put into space and<br>we think so as well or at least it's<br>very much worth exploring what can we do<br>with magnetic fields in space<br>um one thing you might think is arts<br>space is cold so that's even better so<br>you don't need so much cry calling<br>um actually interestingly that's not<br>really true so in low earth orbit for<br>example the average temperature of those<br>satellites is roughly room temperature<br>which when you think about it is not so<br>crazy because they're in the sun half<br>the time and then they go out of the Sun<br>but they're rotating in and out of the<br>sun uh you know every same few hours<br>so they average out to about room<br>temperature and the electronics and so<br>on that goes into them is is generally<br>similar to electronics on Earth also you<br>want to be in the sun because you need<br>some power you want solar panels and you<br>want power to do things<br>so actually so the cryogenics is not you<br>can't take advantage of the cold of deep<br>space at least if you want to do things<br>around the Earth<br>um so you have to model and this is a<br>model here of the solar radiation that<br>you get you also get information<br>infrared radiation and reflected<br>radiation off the Earth so you have to<br>model all of that this is some very nice<br>modeling done by Jamal Olatunji so we<br>just looked first of all at a small<br>satellite and how that would behave so<br>first of all this is with no solar<br>panels or anything it's just<br>the sort of ambient effects and you can<br>see it sort of oscillates you know<br>around<br>um zero maybe roughly as as it rotates<br>um then we added solar panels to this<br>and said okay now we're generating some<br>power we're going to use that power to<br>run our cry caller so we need to can we<br>get enough power to cool our magnet down<br>and make it operational and the good<br>news is yes so you can see the blue line<br>which drifts down says the the coil is<br>cooling down over time in this case it's<br>about 10 hours so it's quite slow<br>um you know so it it isn't easy to cool<br>things down to an operational<br>temperature in space it's something you<br>have to engineer quite carefully<br>but this demonstration showed that it<br>could be done even on a fairly small<br>scale and generally as the scale gets<br>larger it gets a bit easier because<br>you've got more power to play with you<br>can have larger cryo coolers more<br>efficient cry coolers and so on<br>um so there was design success the green<br>area on the um right here shows that we<br>can get down to our operational<br>temperature it is important about where<br>you put radiators so any heat that you<br>generate in the satellite has to be<br>radiated back to space so we don't have<br>water cooling or air cooling the kind of<br>things you take for granted in the<br>laboratory<br>um so what are we going to do with this<br>um so the application uh that we're<br>looking at first is electric Rockets So<br>these aren't rockets that will take off<br>from the earth and get you into space<br>the rockets that produce relatively<br>small amounts of thrust but they're used<br>to move about in space and the great<br>advantage of them is that you can use<br>the energy from the Sun to accelerate<br>ions you know particles and use that to<br>push you along and that's much more<br>efficient than taking up large amounts<br>of chemicals and burning them to um take<br>yourself from place to place so for<br>example if you wanted to go to Mars and<br>come back you have to take an enormous<br>amount of chemicals to first of all get<br>you off the Earth you know push yourself<br>to Mars then of course you've got to<br>stop before you actually crash into Mars<br>you've got to slow yourself down which<br>takes energy you've got to get off Mars<br>again you've got to get back all of that<br>and you've got to slow down when you get<br>to the Earth all of that would take an<br>enormous amount of chemical energy<br>whereas if you can use the energy from<br>the Sun everything becomes a lot easier<br>so that's why people want these electric<br>Rockets so they're called a<br>magnetoplasmic dynamic Thruster is what<br>we've been working on so it looks a bit<br>like this so we have our magnet to help<br>accelerate those ions and so the bigger<br>the magnetic field generally the more<br>we're accelerating those ions and<br>getting more thrust<br>um so people are interested in these<br>because they're very fuel efficient<br>because you're accelerating them and<br>they're good for high Power Systems so<br>this is a magnet that we develop for a<br>test that we did recently this is our<br>test system so you need a very large<br>vacuum chamber in which you can test<br>this thrust that it actually works<br>so a great effort for the team getting<br>this up and running and the test<br>equipment we recently did been<br>collaborating with Nagoya University<br>and I will now show you an electric<br>rocket in operation<br>there we go so that's it sort of being<br>switched on and a big pulse of plasma<br>being created as the as the um uh system<br>is energized<br>um<br>so uh so this was using our magnet so<br>we've made very good progress on this<br>technology<br>um and we're continuing to develop that<br>uh in our laboratory here<br>the next step for proving uh that we can<br>take this into space is to do a magnet<br>mission to the International Space<br>Station<br>so we have signed up with a company<br>called nanorex who work with the NASA to<br>put experiments on the space station and<br>we're going to deliver a magnet to them<br>in 2024 which will be taken by the<br>astronauts up to the space station it'll<br>be mounted on the side of the space<br>station<br>it isn't a full Thruster system because<br>that's a little too complex for us right<br>now but we will have radiation sensors<br>there to look at how the magnetic field<br>affects the radiation environment and<br>we'll also be fully testing the<br>operation of the magnet so how our<br>calling Works how the amount of power we<br>need how long it takes to cool the<br>magnet down and ramping the magnet up<br>and down<br>in in field and so on<br>um so that's a very exciting project<br>um it's probably the most ambitious uh<br>project we've undertaken to date at The<br>Institute<br>um so we're all very excited to get that<br>going uh in 2024.<br>um one other project we're doing uh in<br>space at the moment is a magnetic heat<br>shield project with DLR the German space<br>agency so when you interact with<br>um when a spacecraft is re-entering the<br>atmosphere and it hits the atmosphere it<br>forms an ionized plasma because of the<br>heat of re-entry and with a magnetic<br>fields you can sort of push that plasma<br>away from the aircraft and shield the<br>aircraft somewhat from that heat<br>so we are building a magnet which will<br>be taken to Germany to be used in one of<br>the Test Facilities so they have the<br>Test Facilities where they can produce a<br>plasma flow which simulates that effect<br>of hitting the atmosphere and we'll be<br>testing whether whether or not it works<br>and it actually is a technology worth<br>pursuing<br>um there are many other interesting<br>applications of magnets in space one of<br>the ones where we're keen to push is<br>shielding magnetic shielding<br>um so one of the unsolved problems of<br>going to Mars for example is the solar<br>radiation which can be very dangerous to<br>humans so at the moment there's no real<br>system to shield from that actually on<br>the International Space Station the<br>astronauts actually kind of hide behind<br>the luggage when there's a solar flare<br>and the danger of solar radiation so<br>they basically go to somewhere in the<br>space station where there's the most<br>Mass prop possible between them and the<br>sun in order to protect themselves but<br>once you think about going to the moon<br>and having you know orbital stations on<br>the moon and so on you really need<br>something better than just going and<br>trying to hide somewhere or having a lot<br>of lead shielding or such like so having<br>a magnetic Shield would be a fantastic<br>solution<br>okay so there are many other things I<br>could talk about<br>um but I think I'll draw it to a close<br>there<br>um we're working on some fantastic<br>Technologies uh we've got some fantastic<br>staff who have helped us develop all of<br>these<br>projects and we are really looking<br>forward to seeing these come to fruition<br>see them become real things in the world<br>okay<br>foreign</p></main><footer style="margin-top: 2rem; background: #0001; padding: 2rem;
