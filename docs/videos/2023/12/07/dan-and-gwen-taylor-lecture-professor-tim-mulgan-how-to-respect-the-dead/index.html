Can we balance respect for the dead and the living if we don’t know whether the dead have the same moral status as the living? In a pluralist society, where people have very different views about the fate of the dead, can we truly claim to respect other people’s beliefs if we think that those beliefs are false? In this lecture, Professor Tim Mulgan, University of Auckland, will ask these questions, and explore various possible answers.<br><br>Hosted by the Philosophy programme at University of Otago; recorded Tuesday, 5 September 2023, 5:30pm in Archway 4.</p><h2>Transcript</h2><p style="opacity: 0.9; font-size: 0.8em">Transcripts may be automatically generated and may not be 100% accurate.</p><p>foree<br>for<br>Greg voto everybody uh my name is Zack<br>Weber I'm the head of the philosophy<br>program here at the University of Vago<br>and it's my pleasure to introduce<br>tonight's speaker uh Tim<br>mulgan who is the professor it's I would<br>also just like to say it's really nice<br>to be here we had been having these<br>events regularly for years and then the<br>last time we've had a Taylor lecture I<br>looked was in<br>2019 uh so it's been I think something<br>happened between 2019 and now I can't<br>quite remember what it was so it's it's<br>a true pleasure to be back here with all<br>of you uh and celebrating having the<br>Taylor lecture together uh so Tim buan<br>is a professor of philosophy at the<br>University of ockland he's<br>ALS he is also the professor of moral<br>and political philosophy at the<br>Andrews no one in from St Andre uh right<br>uh so it's great to have Tim here<br>because Tim did his ba honors here at<br>the University of itago and then went on<br>to do a dill at Oxford uh he has taught<br>atago Auckland and St Andrews and he was<br>the T tailor lecturer here in 2011 so<br>welcome back uh so just a few words<br>about Tim as a philosopher<br>um his book the demands of<br>consequentialism from 2001 according to<br>our own departmental website says it met<br>with great<br>acclaim uh because Tim features<br>prominently in our departmental history<br>which if you've never read I I highly<br>recommend uh his next book future people<br>from 2006 was called timely and<br>important of incredibly impressive scope<br>and interest it discusses our<br>obligations to the Future uh and his<br>book ethics for a broken world from<br>called uh subtitled imagining philosophy<br>after catastrophe is a dialogue that is<br>set in a classroom in some kind of<br>post-catastrophe world where the<br>students discuss uh whether ethics as we<br>currently think of it is too wedded to<br>the idea of affluence and whether we<br>should continue to assume that we will<br>be as affluent as we are now and whether<br>ethics should uh be so tied up with that<br>um the Notre Dame philosophical review<br>said of that book that it is an<br>extraordinary book mogan's bold<br>stylistic experiment challenges<br>philosophers who want to contribute to<br>public dialogue about important moral<br>and political issues can we learn to<br>write in ways that effectively Express<br>relevant emotions without diminishing<br>The Logical quality of our arguments and<br>analyses can we make philosophical<br>writing more accessible to General<br>readers or are we content to write for<br>one another while hoping that other<br>people will try to save the world uh I<br>think the writer meant that the answer<br>to these rhetorical questions is that<br>professor mulan's book succeeds at both<br>being a piece of precise philosophy and<br>also speaking to the people uh and<br>that's why he's here tonight uh he also<br>wrote a book called purpose in the<br>universe so his work is in ethics and<br>also philosophy of religion I was just<br>reading a piece that he has on Eon<br>magazine which is a popular platform<br>where he really demonstrates combining<br>academic precision and popularization<br>he's talking about whether the discovery<br>of extr drial life would increase the<br>likelihood of both moral realism and<br>theism if I understood your piece<br>correctly and it seemed to say yes so<br>that was interesting uh so uh we thank<br>Dan and Gwen Taylor who I think Tim is<br>going to say a bit more about um Tim is<br>a philosopher who speaks to the public<br>in a serious academic way and we are<br>tonight have the great pleasure of<br>you<br>uh thanks everyone for coming it's<br>really really very very nice to be back<br>and thanks to to Greg and Zack for your<br>welcome and thanks to Karen for<br>organizing everything it's it's taken a<br>while so this is my<br>2021 Taylor lecture which which i' was a<br>week away from giving and then various<br>things happened in Oakland which which<br>haven't really stopped um so so thanks<br>everyone for coming and thanks to the<br>the department and I also want to start<br>by saying a thank you to whoever it is<br>who booked the room for tonight so I<br>have a very a very longstanding<br>relationship with this building because<br>I watched it being built I grew up in in<br>Queen Street um so this is back when<br>real people lived in in Queen Street and<br>I went to<br>kindergarten um across the river in the<br>kindergarten that's that's still there<br>and and my dad had an office in the<br>burns building so we would walk to work<br>together and we walked past this empty<br>building site and there were various<br>things there was diggers and there was<br>dirt and there were various quite<br>interesting things and then one day<br>we're walking past there's this huge<br>number I it was huge in the sense of<br>size numerically it was quite a small<br>number it was it was one and and dad<br>said oh that's that's the number one and<br>then every day for the rest of the year<br>one of the highlights of my day would be<br>let's go and see if there's if there's a<br>new number and usually there wasn't but<br>every now and then there was and they<br>went from one to two to whatever and<br>then they stopped at what seemed to me<br>to be the appropriate place to stop so<br>on behalf of my four-year-old self I<br>would like to thank you for inviting me<br>to give my lecture within the number<br>four on a much more serious note it's<br>it's a great privilege for me to deliver<br>a lecture in honor of Dan Dan and and<br>Gwen Taylor I have very nice memories of<br>both of them from when I was a child but<br>I have particularly fond memories of<br>Gwen who was a<br>constant<br>warm<br>enthusiastic questioning challenging<br>irreverent presence in the philosophy<br>Department here at otago when I was a<br>student and especially when I was a<br>young academic and when I was starting<br>out on on my teaching career and I<br>particularly remember some of the advice<br>that she gave me about about lecturing<br>and about teaching so on one particular<br>occasion we were having lunch in the<br>staff club and I was doing a 110 first<br>year<br>lecture and Gwen said the best way to<br>prepare for an afternoon lecture is to<br>have a large glass of red wine with<br>lunch so it may or may not actually make<br>the lecture go well but you will<br>certainly feel that it went<br>wonderfully so it's a it's a real<br>privilege it's a treat for me to speak<br>to you tonight and to honor her her<br>memory um though you'll be relieved to<br>hear that on this occasion I will not be<br>following her advice or or her<br>example so so this brings me to<br>my to my topic which is that we we often<br>talk about honoring and respecting the<br>dead so we have occasions like this and<br>people come along and they have some<br>sense of of what's going on but what<br>does all that<br>mean how do we Respect the Dead what<br>interests if any do the dead currently<br>have can we respect both the dead and<br>the living and can we do that can we<br>respect both the dead and the living if<br>we don't know what happens when a person<br>dies so those are the questions that I'm<br>hopefully going to say<br>something about<br>tonight so we clearly do think that it's<br>possible to respect and to disrespect<br>the dead and we often think that that's<br>important we avoid speaking ill of the<br>Dead we carry out a dying person's<br>wishes we honor someone's will we<br>respect someone's corpse we don't<br>desecrate people's Graves we don't treat<br>human remains in a museum as if they<br>were merely inanimate objects and so on<br>respect for the dead underlies<br>controversial debates about postumus<br>organ donation the treatment of human<br>remains the interpretation of Wills and<br>so<br>on different cultures have very<br>different ways to respect the<br>dead so if you met a living person even<br>if you knew nothing specific about them<br>you could still guess that it would not<br>be respectful to burn them bury them eat<br>them embar them leave them to be<br>devoured by vultures or put them on<br>public<br>display but with a dead person any one<br>of those might be just the thing to do<br>some people do burn their dead some<br>people bury them some people eat them<br>some people leave them to be devoured by<br>sacred animals or birds and so on and on<br>and within any given<br>society different people will have very<br>different<br>preferences so to take one eccentric and<br>celebr ated example within philosophy<br>the utilitarian philosopher Jeremy benam<br>left instructions in his will that his<br>body was to be preserved and publicly<br>displayed and present at important<br>events and meetings in the University of<br>London so at this point you might think<br>well respecting the dead is going to be<br>easy if there are so many ways to do<br>it of course it's not that simple one<br>person's respect is another person's<br>defilement an eternity of University<br>committee meetings would not be<br>everybody's idea of a happy afterlife or<br>indeed many<br>people's so here is a<br>non a non-local example thank you to<br>Karen for putting my putting the<br>pictures off the internet onto the onto<br>the screen um so this is from Scot<br>this is a few miles south of kodin in<br>the north of Scotland are the clava<br>stones this is a low circular Stone<br>structure with a narrow entrance that<br>perfectly channels the Rising Sun at the<br>winter<br>solstice so if you're prepared to get up<br>at midday and watch the sun on the M<br>Solstice that's when it is this<br>structure was built 4,000 years ago it<br>was used for a while then it was<br>abandoned for another thousand years<br>then it was used for another while then<br>it was abandoned again no one really<br>knows what it was used for or by<br>whom so suppose we found the remains of<br>one of the people who made use of this<br>structure suppose we want to treat this<br>person with<br>respect what should we do how should we<br>respect this long<br>person and does respect for them depend<br>on what they wanted or on what they<br>believed about the<br>afterlife could we respect a long dead<br>person without taking seriously the<br>possibility that what they believed<br>whatever it was is actually<br>true so at this point you might say well<br>that doesn't arise because I said about<br>a minute ago that we have no idea what<br>these people believed so it doesn't<br>matter whether we should be trying to<br>respect what they believed and that's<br>true in this particular case but<br>consider another<br>example so the Oakland Museum is<br>currently showing an exhibit which is<br>called Egypt in the time of the Pharaohs<br>which is what it is so this<br>exhibition has statues of cats and<br>little scarabs and then it ends with a<br>room containing a mummy so a preserved<br>human<br>corpse along with other items that are<br>taken from quite different ancient<br>Egyptian tombs in different places and<br>different centuries and different<br>Millennia we know a great deal about<br>what this particular person this<br>particular dead person probably believed<br>and we know why these particular funeral<br>arrangements were so important to her<br>when we display statues from one place<br>and earns containing organs from another<br>place and a mummified dead body from<br>somewhere else in a museum in a random<br>combination far away from their original<br>context then we know that we're not<br>doing what the dead person wanted and we<br>also know that if that person's beliefs<br>about the afterlife are correct then<br>we're destroying their prospects of<br>Eternal<br>happiness that doesn't seem to bother us<br>presumably because we take it for<br>granted that that person's beliefs about<br>the afterlife are not<br>correct if displaying a dead body in a<br>museum seems disrespectful and it does<br>seem disrespectful or at least worrying<br>to a lot of people then that's not<br>because we're trying to respect what the<br>believed so one important feature of<br>these two cases the imaginary clava<br>person and the actual dead Egyptian<br>person is that these dead people have no<br>living<br>representatives there no one now who<br>believes the same thing as what they<br>believed when we only need to respect<br>the Dead We naturally set aside what<br>they believed and we fall back on what<br>we ourselves<br>believe but what about cases where we<br>need to respect both the living as well<br>as the dead what should we do<br>then once living people are involved we<br>naturally defer to them we defer to the<br>living rather than the dead and I'll ARG<br>I'm going to argue that this creates<br>various<br>problems a central question in modern<br>political life is how we can live<br>together despite disagreeing about<br>religious metaphysical or spiritual<br>questions one popular answer is liberal<br>neutrality we allow people to decide for<br>themselves to choose their own path to<br>live according to their own beliefs and<br>we try to avoid taking sides in any<br>religious metaphysical or spiritual<br>controversy so this kind of liberal<br>neutrality approach has many critics and<br>many Defenders all I want to do is today<br>is to present a new kind of problem for<br>it liberal neutrality breaks down when<br>we try to respect both the living and<br>the<br>dead so I'm going to focus quite a lot<br>on an actual case that's discussed by<br>The American Scholar of religion Winfred<br>Sullivan in her 2005 book The<br>impossibility of religious freedom so I<br>should say at the advant at the outset<br>that she's not responsible for any of<br>the crazy things that I'm going to do<br>with with her example or her arguments<br>so in this example two sisters had<br>erected statues at their brother's<br>graveside in violation of the rules of a<br>public Cemetery in Baton Rouge<br>Florida the sisters immigrants to<br>Florida from Cuba were traditional that<br>is prev Vatican 2 Roman Catholics and<br>they believed that because he had<br>committed suicide their brother's Soul<br>would inevitably be damned and unless<br>they constantly prayed for him and the<br>statues that they' put up were part of a<br>family tradition that helped them to<br>pray for the soul of their<br>brother so the Florida legal case that<br>salivan discusses concerns the statues<br>not the prayers<br>themselves the cemetery regulations<br>prohibited what they called vertical<br>monuments so things that rose up out of<br>the<br>ground partly because this Disturbed the<br>cemetery's Parkland aesthetic unquote<br>but also because it made it more<br>expensive to<br>Mo and the case turned on whether the<br>cemetery rules significantly impacted on<br>family members religious freedom so as<br>in any actual case there are lots of<br>other things going on in the<br>background salivan AR use that actual US<br>legal practice as it played out in this<br>case which although it claims to respect<br>religious freedom is not neutral because<br>it<br>presupposes a Protestant view of<br>religion that<br>privileges individual conscience and<br>doctrinal Orthodoxy over local community<br>practices so the court got hung up on<br>whether you the religion required the<br>sisters to do exactly what they were<br>doing and they brought in religion<br>experts and various people and salivan<br>says that's not respecting what religion<br>actually means to people who are who are<br>living it what I want to argue is that<br>liberal<br>neutrality presupposes a Protestant view<br>of religion in a quite different way<br>liberal neutrality breaks down because<br>respect for the living requires us to<br>take seriously what living people<br>believe about life after<br>death but but non-protestant views about<br>the<br>afterlife then imply that the dead have<br>continuing interests in this world that<br>may conflict with the interests of the<br>living and that makes us hard it makes<br>it hard for us to respect both the<br>living and the dead<br>so to unpack that we can start by asking<br>why funeral practices matter so much to<br>living people why was it so important<br>for Sullivan's grieving sisters to pray<br>at their brother's<br>grave this was important to them for<br>many different reasons as a family<br>tradition as a religious observance as a<br>community practice as a a link to their<br>Homeland as a connection with their<br>ancestors as a way to remember a loved<br>one as the Fulfillment of a promise to a<br>dead person or a promise to themselves<br>or a promise to<br>God so those are all very good reasons<br>for<br>action and liberal neutrality can in<br>principle accommodate all those kinds of<br>reasons even if actual legal practice<br>doesn't do a great job of accommodating<br>them in any particular<br>case however we would miss something<br>that's crucial about this case and about<br>many other cases if we assume that the<br>kinds of reasons that I've listed are<br>the only reasons that the sisters<br>had their primary motivation was to help<br>their brother they needed to pray not<br>for themselves but because it was in the<br>interests of the dead person<br>himself and in cases like this where a<br>living person believes that They are<br>promoting the continuing interests of a<br>dead<br>person then what I want to suggest is<br>that if we want to respect the living<br>person then we should take seriously the<br>possibility that what they believe is<br>true so we should take seriously the<br>possibility that the dead person does<br>have the particular interest that the<br>living person says they<br>do so that brings us to two harder<br>questions what interests do the dead<br>interests so we could just say to make<br>life easier for ourselves that the dead<br>don't have any interests because they no<br>longer exist<br>and that may be true but it's a reply<br>that clearly violates liberal neutrality<br>because many people believe that the<br>exist so we could instead look for<br>interests that the dead will have<br>whether or not they still exist and we<br>could then agreed on how to respect the<br>dead even though we don't agree about<br>the afterlife<br>that might seem like it's an unlikely<br>thing to pull off but at this point<br>liberal neutrality is supported by<br>recent arguments in the philosophy of<br>death contemporary philosophical<br>discussion of the interests of the Dead<br>often starts by assuming that the dead<br>no longer exist and then debates the<br>intelligibility of postumus<br>harm by which philosophers actually mean<br>post existence<br>harm the philosophical puzzle is that we<br>think the dead do have interests we<br>think that it matters how we treat them<br>but it's not obvious that that even<br>makes<br>sense how can you be harmed by things<br>that happen after you no longer<br>exist suppose you devote your life to a<br>project that collapses after you die<br>and you didn't see this coming while you<br>were alive after death you no longer<br>exist Does the postumus failure of your<br>project still count as a harm to you is<br>it something that makes your life go<br>worse do you still have any interest in<br>what happens here in this<br>world many philosophers want to argue<br>that even even if the dead no longer<br>exist at all we can still harm them and<br>we can still respect or disrespect them<br>and they do still have morally<br>significant<br>interests everyone has an interest in<br>what happens to their physical remains<br>in how their property is distributed in<br>whether or not their descendants Thrive<br>and in how they are<br>remembered and the idea is that everyone<br>has these interests even if death is<br>non-existence these interests are<br>grounded not in any afterlife but they<br>are grounded instead in What mattered to<br>people while they were<br>alive now of course all philosophical<br>arguments are<br>controversial because philosophers are<br>very clever people and they have an<br>interest in keeping everything<br>controversial because otherwise they'd<br>all be out of a<br>job<br>so those arguments are not ones that<br>everyone agrees with but the point is<br>that if these arguments about postumus<br>interests succeed then they support<br>liberal<br>neutrality if the dead can have<br>interests even if they don't exist then<br>we can all agree to respect those<br>interests because the dead have them<br>whether or not they<br>exist and at the this point liberal<br>neutrality gets support from one<br>particular religious tradition Western<br>Protestant<br>Christianity Protestants believe that<br>the dead still exist and that they still<br>have<br>interests but the dead have no ongoing<br>interests in this world and they're no<br>longer affected by what happens here the<br>dead persons postmortal fate is already<br>decided indeed on some extreme double<br>predestination views of the kind that<br>are particularly popular among the<br>cheerful inhabitants of of Scotland on<br>these views each person's postmortem<br>fate was predetermined before God<br>created the<br>universe so it's too late now because<br>it's always been too<br>late protestantism and<br>non-existence agree that the dead are<br>gone that dead people have no continuing<br>post-mortem interests in the world of<br>the<br>living so our only reasons concerning<br>the dead are either reasons to respect<br>the desires that were expressed by the<br>dead person while they were alive or<br>reasons to respect living people's<br>attachment to that dead person<br>so in other words the dead retain only<br>those interests that they would have if<br>they didn't exist anymore at all if we<br>respect those interests then we remain<br>neutral between<br>non-existence and<br>protestantism so liberal neutrality can<br>accommodate a wide range of funeral<br>practices it can accommodate all the<br>Myriad sects of<br>protestantism and it could respect the<br>wishes that dead people expressed while<br>they were alive while leaving living<br>people free to decide how they will<br>dead so it looks like everything's<br>solved and we can go home<br>early unfortunately this being<br>philosophy things are not so<br>simple not everyone agrees that the dead<br>are gone many people believe believe<br>instead that the dead are still with<br>us for instance many people throughout<br>human history have thought that dying<br>Hamilton it's not the same as being<br>alive it's probably worse than being<br>alive you wouldn't choose it for<br>yourself you would pity anyone who<br>suffered it and it's not philosophically<br>very<br>interesting because the Land of the Dead<br>is not very different from the land of<br>the living so when I if I ever give this<br>talk in the north Ireland I'll have<br>to choose a different example I guess<br>possibly so in other<br>words many people believe that death<br>marks a transition from one state or<br>place or mode of existence to another<br>it's a step on a larger<br>journey of of course there's no single<br>positive view people can agree that the<br>dead still exist and that they're still<br>affected by worldly events but disagree<br>about what that<br>involves what is Hamilton actually like<br>how do I get there from here does<br>everyone go to the same place do some<br>people get to go to Tower oner or does<br>some people end up in a better or worse<br>place than others do all the dead people<br>still exist or only a fortunate or<br>unfortunate<br>few salivan Florida sisters for instance<br>believe that the dead go to one of two<br>very different<br>destinations neither of which is much<br>like<br>Hamilton the Egyptian person whose body<br>is in Orland Museum thought that the<br>dead went to other<br>places these views look very different<br>from the idea that everyone goes to the<br>same shadowy hamiltonian<br>afterlife however these otherwise very<br>different views share two Central<br>commitments first that the dead still<br>exist and second that they continue to<br>be affected by and thus they continue to<br>have an interest in what happens in the<br>living from the point of view of liberal<br>neutrality the real question is not<br>whether or not the dead continue to<br>exist it's whether or not the dead are<br>affected by what happens in the world of<br>the living if we want to be truly<br>neutral we have to be neutral between<br>those who think the dead are gone and<br>those who think the dead are still with<br>us because they've just gone somewhere<br>else that's like this protestantism and<br>non-existence agree believe that the<br>dead are gone but other people many<br>others<br>disagree this is a problem because we<br>have two goals we want to respect the<br>interests of the dead but we also want<br>to respect the interests of the<br>living I'm going to argue that these two<br>goals Clash when the beliefs of the<br>living concern the interests of the<br>Dead to see why we must ask how we might<br>Respect the Dead suppose I want to<br>respect some particular dead<br>person I have three main ways of going<br>about this the first is to use a first<br>personal standard I respect the dead<br>person by treating them as I would want<br>to be treated if I were dead if I would<br>want to be buried or cremated or locked<br>in a vault or displayed in a museum then<br>I should do the<br>same this is one important kind of<br>respect and if you know nothing at all<br>about a particular dead person then this<br>might be the best you can<br>do the next kind of standard is a second<br>personal standard I treat the dead<br>person as they would want to be treated<br>I should treat Jeremy bentham's remains<br>as he would<br>want at this point we can ask three<br>different second personal<br>questions first what did did the person<br>want when they were<br>alive second what would they have wanted<br>in some relevant hypothetical<br>situation would they have wanted to be<br>displayed in a museum if they had known<br>what a museum was or if they had modern<br>beliefs about the fate of the Dead would<br>Jeremy want benam have wanted to be<br>preserved if he'd known where<br>universities were<br>going finally you could ask what does<br>the the dead person actually want<br>now as we'll see it's the last question<br>that's really<br>problematic the final option is to is to<br>adopt a third person<br>standard I treat the dead person not as<br>I would want not as they would want but<br>as some second as some third party wants<br>someone such as a loved one a relative a<br>representative one complication is that<br>we use these third person standards for<br>two quite different<br>purposes when we respect the present<br>wishes of the Dead person's nearest and<br>dearest such as spouses or Partners<br>children or parents other relations<br>other group members we're often not<br>really trying to respect the dead person<br>at all<br>instead we want to respect the living we<br>acknowledge living people's loss and<br>their attachment to the dead person in<br>its own right and not merely as an<br>indirect way to respect the person who<br>is<br>dead because when we think about these<br>things we often focus on the hard cases<br>of conflict where living people<br>disagree it's easy to forget that in the<br>vast majority of cases<br>we do defer to the dead person's living<br>relatives we allow living people to bury<br>mourn and commemorate their dead as they<br>that is the living see<br>fit so we want to respect both the<br>living and the dead liberal neutrality<br>tries to combine the two by deferring to<br>living<br>relatives here's a rough analogy for<br>this we mostly leave parents to decide<br>how to raise their<br>children ideally this policy respects<br>both parents' interests and children's<br>interests because parents are best place<br>to know and best motivated to do what's<br>in their own child's best interests in<br>both cases things can go wrong parents<br>don't always do what's best for their<br>children the living don't always do<br>right by the dead but that doesn't mean<br>that the general approach is<br>wrong if the dead are gone then we have<br>four good reasons to defer to living<br>relatives because living interests<br>matter too because living interests<br>Trump dead interests because funeral<br>practices are<br>self-regarding and because living people<br>are experts about the interests of the<br>Dead<br>unfortunately three of these four<br>justification ations collapse if the<br>dead are still with<br>us so let's let's go through<br>them the first argument for difference<br>is that living interests matter<br>too obviously death is not just<br>something that happens to the dead<br>person themselves it also affects those<br>who are left behind we must count the<br>interests of the living alongside the<br>interests of the Dead this argument<br>stood works if the dead are still with<br>us indeed the argument is probably<br>stronger in that case because the<br>interests of the living are more<br>significant if they really are doing<br>things that make the dead person's<br>afterlife go better they're not just<br>doing something that's for themselves<br>they're doing something that's really<br>important for that dead person so we<br>still have a reason to count the<br>interests of the<br>living a second reason we might have is<br>we might defer to the living because<br>their interests Trump the interests of<br>the<br>dead that's a plausible claim to make if<br>the dead are gone and they have few<br>remaining worldly<br>interests but if the dead are still with<br>us then it seems arbitrary to assume<br>that their interests are going to be<br>trumped by ours especially if what's at<br>stake for the dead person is more<br>significant than what is at stake for<br>their living relatives<br>so if you're weighing Eternal suffering<br>against the burden of saying a few<br>prayers then it seems pretty clear which<br>is going to be more important so that<br>second argument doesn't seem to apply so<br>much a third reason for deference to<br>particular living people is the central<br>liberal principle that because each<br>competent adult is the best judge of<br>their own interests people should be<br>free to decide for themselves about<br>self-regarding matters that don't affect<br>anyone else if the dead person is gone<br>then any impact on them is comparatively<br>unimportant the funeral is primarily for<br>the living if there's any conflict it's<br>between the interests of different<br>groups of living<br>people but on the other hand if the dead<br>person's afterlife is affected by what<br>living people people decide then the<br>decision is no longer a self-regarding<br>decision made by the living people<br>deciding how to bury someone is now an<br>other regarding decision that affects<br>someone who's not a party to that<br>decision who cannot easily speak for<br>themselves and who is extremely<br>vulnerable because they're dead so if we<br>believe that the dead are still with us<br>then Prime private self-regarding<br>decisions about funerals are transformed<br>into other regarding matters of public<br>concern which we don't necessarily leave<br>people to decide for<br>themselves the final<br>argument is that we defer to the living<br>because they are experts about what is<br>Dead We respect this particular dead<br>person by deferring to these particular<br>living<br>people and their views about how to<br>respect that dead<br>person so this is the most important<br>argument I think it's the most<br>intuitively compelling argument and it's<br>the one that raises the most interesting<br>philosophical<br>puzzles if the dead are gone then the<br>interests of the dead person depend on<br>what they did did want given what they<br>did believe while they were<br>alive living relatives are quite likely<br>to be the best judges of those<br>interests your live your nearest and<br>dearest are going to be experts on what<br>you would have wanted or on what your<br>tradition or culture or religion regards<br>as respectful so that seems like a good<br>argument in that<br>case on the other hand if the are still<br>with us then the interest of the dead<br>person depend not on what they did want<br>or believe when they were alive but W<br>rather on what they now want given what<br>they now<br>believe given how the afterlife is<br>actually panning out for<br>them living<br>people often change their minds<br>so we want different things at different<br>times so what I<br>wanted when I was four when I first<br>walked past this building may or may not<br>be exactly the same as what I want now<br>in general you respect someone's wishes<br>by giving them what they now want not<br>what they used to want so you don't<br>honor the someone who's 50 by lining up<br>all the things they wanted when they<br>were four<br>necessarily so this fact about changing<br>desires and changing preferences leads<br>to a much discussed puzzle about<br>postumus<br>interests if someone no longer exists<br>then they no longer have any<br>desires so why should we care about the<br>desires that the dead person no longer<br>has when we don't care about the past<br>desires of living<br>people in response to this puzzle<br>Defenders of postumus interests<br>distinguish two ways that someone can<br>lose a desire so they do the standard<br>kind of thing that philosophers say and<br>they say well it depends what you mean<br>by no longer Desiring it so if I<br>continue to exist as a person who<br>desires things but I've abandoned my<br>desire for X then X is no longer in my<br>interests so we should aband we should<br>ignore abandoned<br>desires by contrast if I consistently<br>desired X throughout my life and I no<br>longer Desire X only because I no longer<br>exist at all then X may still be in my<br>interests so the thought is that we<br>should abandon we should ignore<br>abandoned desires but we should not<br>ignore desires that ceased with my death<br>but which I never<br>abandoned so that distinction is<br>supposed to help us to see how pre-death<br>desires can give rise to post-death<br>interests unfortunately this kind of<br>argument for the continuing relevance of<br>pre-death desires only applies if death<br>does end my this worldly<br>Desiring the argument is going to<br>collapse if after my death I continue to<br>exist and I continue to have desires<br>about this world but I just no longer<br>happen to desire the same<br>things so why would you think that death<br>would change your<br>desires one reason is that desires<br>depend on beliefs if your beliefs change<br>your desires will change and if the dead<br>are still with us then death May well<br>change your beliefs about what happens<br>to you after you<br>die if you are now actually in Hamilton<br>then what matters to you is what<br>Hamilton is actually like<br>not what you used to believe about<br>Hamilton when you lived in denan not<br>what other people who remain behind in<br>Denon still believe about<br>Hamilton maybe Hamilton is not as bad as<br>think<br>yeah indeed it or maybe it is indeed but<br>anyway and of<br>course if you you thought you were going<br>to Hamilton but you ended up somewhere<br>quite different then what you now want<br>will depend on what that other place is<br>actually like and all the information in<br>the world about Hamilton isn't going to<br>do you any good and isn't going to make<br>any difference to what you<br>desire so if we seek to respect a dead<br>person's current wishes then we should<br>defer to their loved ones only if those<br>people are<br>experts not just about what the dead<br>person believed about the afterlife<br>while they were alive but about what is<br>actually true about the<br>afterlife but why would we expect any<br>particular dead person's relatives to be<br>experts about<br>that different living people believe<br>very different<br>things about the<br>afterlife<br>presumably most of them are<br>wrong some people might believe that<br>different groups will experience<br>different afterlives depending on which<br>what which on depending on what each<br>group expected while they were alive so<br>everyone gets whatever they were<br>expecting but many other people don't<br>think it's like that at all many people<br>believe that the Dead all meet the same<br>fate or one of the small set of<br>available Fates regardless of what those<br>people actually<br>believed so if what each dead person now<br>wants depends on what is actually<br>true then different dead people who used<br>to want very different things may now<br>want quite similar things the dead<br>atheist the dead Buddhist the dead clava<br>person the dead ancient Egyptian the<br>dead Protestant and the dead Roman<br>Catholic believed very different things<br>when they were all alive if they now<br>believe anything their current beliefs<br>apart so this is the puzzle if we assume<br>that the dead are gone then we fail to<br>respect people who believe that the dead<br>are still with<br>us on the other hand if we take<br>seriously the possibility that the dead<br>asked to with us then we undermine<br>liberal neutrality and its deference to<br>the beliefs and practices of particular<br>living people because it's no longer<br>possible or reasonable to regard living<br>relatives as experts on the interests of<br>particular dead<br>people if we set aside beliefs about the<br>afterlife then we fail to respect living<br>people who believe that the dead are<br>still with us but if we take seriously<br>the idea that the dead are still with us<br>then our desire to respect the dead<br>requires us to sit in judgment on the<br>beliefs of the<br>living so that's the<br>puzzle what might be the<br>solution and I'm I'm quite tempted to<br>say that I've run out of time and I<br>can't give you the solution because I'm<br>not really sure that I have much of a<br>solution but I'm going to see if I can<br>at least say something<br>towards<br>that one way out of the problem would<br>just be to deny that anyone alive today<br>really believes that the dead are still<br>with us many people did believe this in<br>the past many present people continue<br>inherited practices that originally<br>involved such beliefs but surely no<br>modern sophisticated person really<br>believes that there's an<br>afterlife there would be an easy<br>solution but it just seems unlikely to<br>be true it's just an empirical fact<br>about the world that we live in that not<br>everyone is either an atheist or a<br>Protestant or<br>both if we cannot remain neutral then we<br>must pick a view about the<br>afterlife we could pick a controversial<br>view without asking whether or not it's<br>true two obvious options are<br>majoritarian voting and historical<br>agreement so majoritarian privilege the<br>most popular<br>view non-liberal forms of<br>majoritarianism have familiar problems<br>which I won't go into the dead introduce<br>a new<br>difficulty suppose we ask what the<br>majority of people believe about the<br>afterlife<br>which majority do we mean the majority<br>of living people the majority of dead<br>people or the majority of people who've<br>ever lived the dead outnumber the living<br>and the dead are more likely to agree<br>among themselves so the dead majority<br>view will<br>prevail but now are we asking what the<br>majority of dead people did believe when<br>they were alive or are we asking what<br>they do believe now so it seems like we<br>should be asking what they do believe<br>now but that takes us back to figuring<br>out what's actually<br>true the other alternative that avoids<br>the truth is a historical constitutional<br>settlement that would privilege some<br>controversial view not because it's true<br>not because most or indeed any living<br>people believe in it be but because it<br>was agreed in the past when they just<br>did things better consider as examples<br>an established religion or an entrenched<br>Constitution so non-liberal historical<br>constitutional Arrangements also face<br>familiar problems that I won't go into<br>once again they did create a new<br>puzzle past agreements were made by<br>people who are now dead why would we<br>privilege what those dead people thought<br>while they were alive over what they now<br>think but that leads us back to asking<br>whether or not they now exist which<br>leads us back to the problem that we<br>started with so could we Instead try to<br>discover the<br>afterlife some people deny that it's<br>possible to answer questions about the<br>afterlife because it's impossible to<br>discover the truth about any<br>metaphysical or spiritual question so<br>sometimes people use metaphysical and<br>spiritual as synonyms for questions that<br>no one could possibly<br>answer therefore if that's true we don't<br>have a choice we have to set aside the<br>controversial interests of the dead<br>because we have no way to discover what<br>those interests are we cannot discover<br>the truth about the afterlife because it<br>depends on religion just spiritual or<br>metaphysical beliefs rather than factual<br>empirical or scientific<br>beliefs well that's a thing people say<br>but this is another place where people<br>disagree many people believe that it is<br>possible to discover truths about the<br>afterlife using evidence or reason or<br>argument so that's not just something<br>that's believed by atheist materialists<br>who think they can prove that there is<br>no<br>afterlife many people who believe that<br>the dead are still with us also believe<br>that questions about the afterlife can<br>be rationally and publicly<br>evaluated or at least they belong to<br>religions that have long philosophical<br>traditions of publicly arguing about<br>what happens to people after they<br>die so if we simply treat all<br>metaphysical questions as unanswerable<br>and you then use this unanswer ability<br>as an excuse to ignore the interests of<br>the Dead do we genuinely respect what<br>living people believe let alone what all<br>believed I think the only solution and<br>it's perhaps not much of a<br>solution is to accept that we must take<br>everybody's beliefs seriously both<br>living and dead but then to argue that<br>taking a belief<br>seriously doesn't mean pretending that<br>it's true or refusing to ask whether or<br>not it's true we respect someone's<br>belief when we take seriously the<br>possibility that it's true and make a<br>genuine effort to find out whether or<br>not it's true even if we end up<br>concluding that as far as we can tell<br>the person's belief is<br>false so recall the two cases that I<br>started with the imaginary long dead<br>clava person who's been patiently<br>waiting on the overhead for their chance<br>and the actual ancient Egyptian mummy so<br>in these cases we do not defer to what<br>the dead person did believe about the<br>afterlife when they were alive instead<br>we previlege what we believe about the<br>afterlife and that only makes sense if<br>we are confident that our beliefs are<br>more likely to be true than their<br>beliefs we do have enough confidence in<br>our beliefs to impose them on the dead<br>so maybe we should be more honest when<br>we're imposing them on the living or on<br>one<br>that's<br>thanks very much Tim this<br>fascinating uh we have time for<br>questions and answers uh so if you have<br>a question please put up your hand and<br>I'll try to get the microphone to you we<br>also have the pr practice and philosophy<br>that if you would like to add a comment<br>or a question to the thread that is<br>already under discussion you can raise a<br>finger and jump the queue but don't<br>abuse the finger privilege so uh do we<br>have any<br>questions Andrew Rutherford can<br>begin<br>thanks um I always thought uh when<br>you're my lecturer that guy looks so<br>young why should I respect him but you<br>you've uh you've you've improved on that<br>basis but anyway um I I just think that<br>the whole uh um debate is is slightly<br>misguided in the sense that could be<br>refrained um from dead and not dead and<br>afterlife or not afterlife to<br>accessible and not accessible people cuz<br>that's that's what I think it's actually<br>about as opposed to whether people are<br>are dead so to speak or not it's whether<br>they're accessible to us and I think if<br>you there's a lot of um sort of time<br>travel sort of examples you can use for<br>that like if I was to be able to travel<br>in time 300 years and then come back<br>again when I when I got 300 years in the<br>future I wouldn't just suddenly be<br>incredibly upset that all the people I<br>knew were dead that that that wouldn't<br>bother me because they were still<br>accessible to me CU I could just go back<br>in time again and then they'd be there<br>and so I think that's what what we're<br>talking about when we're talking about<br>death is really just talking about<br>accessibility and so if if someone was<br>to be able to be transported to the<br>other end of the universe so even the<br>light from them light waves or uh you<br>know energy couldn't ever reach us<br>within like the next 100,000 years or<br>whatever it would be um then they're<br>effectively dead because they're not<br>accessible to us so I just think that<br>would probably be a better way to<br>think um yeah I mean it's an<br>interesting I mean I think it is an<br>interesting way<br>of of reframing and getting getting at<br>what's what's<br>important right and so you<br>might you might say that what really<br>matters<br>is who's accessible or another way<br>people put the same kind of thought I<br>think is to say that what matters is<br>who's affected by the decisions that<br>that we make and and for a lot of<br>purposes for for different purposes<br>different groups of people are going to<br>be accessible or affected by by a<br>particular decision and<br>so so there might be you know so time<br>travel is a way in which people who you<br>might might have thought were not<br>affected by a decision are affected by<br>it a lot of puzzles in<br>environmental philosophy and<br>intergenerational Justice turn on the<br>many ways in which<br>we we which means sort of older people<br>generally used to think that people in<br>the distant future were people we didn't<br>need to worry about because they were<br>not accessible because they were not<br>affected by the things the things that<br>we do and so we now we now think that<br>that those people are affected by by<br>what we do and in all these in all these<br>cases you've got to start with you've<br>got a factual question about who Who as<br>a matter of fact are the people who are<br>affected<br>by the decision that that you're making<br>so in the time travel case in all the<br>time travel stories there's always a<br>battle<br>between the protagonist who's discovered<br>that time travel is happening and all<br>the dulled people who are stuck in their<br>world of thinking it's it's not real and<br>that's like a disagreement between the<br>people who think the dead are still<br>affected and the people who think the<br>dead are are not still affected and in<br>the future Generations case you have a<br>dispute between people who think that<br>it's all going to be fine in the end or<br>the you know the economy is going to<br>make everything wash out and the future<br>people are going to be fine and they're<br>not going to be affected and people on<br>the other hand who think no those people<br>are going to be affected by what we do<br>so what we think what we thought was<br>self-regarding is no longer<br>self-regarding and in the case of the<br>Dead you have a you have a similar kind<br>of basic disagreement<br>about whether or not a group of people<br>are affected by decisions that we that<br>we make and so in that sense it is it is<br>an instance of a broader kind<br>of set of of debates that that people<br>have I think what's<br>particular what's particularly what's<br>possibly different about this kind of<br>case is that the disagreement about the<br>status of the Dead goes to the heart of<br>one of the things that liberal<br>neutrality has tried to have as a<br>paradigm case of something that you<br>treat as self-regarding and as that you<br>remain neutral about which is religious<br>belief right so we have this idea that<br>it's okay to bring a disagreement about<br>whether or not climate change is real or<br>whether or not time travel is real into<br>the public domain and have it settled<br>and say we can't decide what we're going<br>to do until we decide who's affected<br>until we've decided which of these views<br>is true it's more troubling for models<br>of liberal neutrality to say the thing<br>we're going to decide is the perennial<br>fight between atheists and Protestants<br>and Buddhists and<br>Catholics and the disputes between<br>within all of those because that that<br>was one of the things that a lot of<br>liberals thought we were going to get<br>away with not having<br>to not having to disagree about I<br>suppose<br>yes just hoping my mind doesn't go blank<br>now you've given me the microphone um I<br>just have a question about whether or<br>not you think sort of Western philosophy<br>is the best tool to attack these kind of<br>um questions because they kind of like<br>black and white or they like discussing<br>black and white<br>perspectives and I noticed that you<br>mentioned in the middle that um there<br>was I can't remember exactly what it was<br>but something along the lines of that<br>you know this might be true or this<br>might be true but there are other<br>possible philosophies that are more okay<br>with saying perhaps all of these things<br>are true at the same time so I'm just<br>wondering um if you have any knowledge<br>or interest in those kind of other<br>philosophies that might be able to say<br>yeah that more possibilities of Truth<br>time than okay thank you yeah that's a<br>great question<br>um um so<br>the so the first answer is that<br>I'm I mean what I bring to these<br>questions is is a very particular<br>analytic kind of Western philosophy<br>because<br>um because that's what I have um and<br>that those are those are the tools that<br>that I have for better or worse for<br>which I blame several of the people in<br>this room um and so I but I do think<br>um I do think it is the I mean it's<br>definitely the kind of challenge to<br>which you want as many different tools<br>and as many different perspectives as as<br>possible because not only I mean not<br>only outside of Western philosophy but<br>also inside of West philosophy there are<br>people who want to move move beyond the<br>kind of very<br>simplified model where you say you<br>know either you still exist you know you<br>either definitely completely still exist<br>and you're the same as you were or you<br>no longer exist and so there are lots of<br>models<br>there are models of the self in which<br>you say well the self is made up of lots<br>of different strands or lots of<br>different kinds of connections between<br>different kinds of things and some of<br>those might endure for a certain time<br>and some of them might not endure and<br>some of them might endure in this way<br>and some of them might not endure in<br>that way and so then you have<br>a in some sense a vague or an<br>indeterminate or a partial question<br>about whether the person who was alive<br>still continues to exist after they dead<br>because you could say well they they<br>continue in this sense but not in that<br>sense or in this way and and not in that<br>I'm I'm always a bit worried about the<br>idea of all the different views being<br>true um at the same time or of different<br>or the things that people say where they<br>want to<br>say the different views might be true<br>for different people right um and I<br>think that could I mean there's a sense<br>in which that could be true in that<br>different things might happen to PE very<br>different things might happen to people<br>after they die which might very much<br>depend on what they were expecting or<br>what they believed or what they thought<br>was going to happen to them before they<br>while they were alive right so<br>I'm at least I'm not I don't sort of<br>freak out about about that sort of<br>possibility but but that would still be<br>a sense in which there was a single<br>truth it was just that this this thing<br>has happened to this person and this<br>thing has happened to that person and<br>that thing has happened to that other<br>person I don't know if<br>that's helping<br>to yeah um and partly I mean part of it<br>is that the cases that I'm interested<br>in and this is ly just because these are<br>the cases that tend to give rise to<br>conflict and therefore get disgusted by<br>lawyers and philosophers are ones where<br>there's different things you can do and<br>there's different stories about what the<br>dead P person now needs and it really<br>makes a big difference to them whether<br>you give them one thing or the other and<br>on some views of it that's like the<br>difference between whether what's in the<br>GL you know you've got one glass and<br>it's got water and one of it's got<br>poison and it it really matters which<br>one which one you give the person and<br>and there are PE there are views on<br>which you know what's at stake is going<br>to be is going to be binary in that sort<br>of sense possibly for the person and so<br>I don't want those to be the only views<br>but on the other hand you don't want we<br>don't want to rule those views out by<br>assuming that they're not<br>right we have a few more questions on<br>the que so next uh yes in the Christian<br>world we have Mystics and well some<br>branches have Mystics I'm not sure about<br>but um they the there are accounts of<br>Mystics having conversations with the<br>deceased if the deceased were to change<br>their mind and tell through the mist and<br>tell the mystics would that would we<br>should we take that seriously thank<br>you<br>um so I'm going to apparently going to<br>cop out and and say that's an empirical<br>question um which is what<br>philosophers say when they have no idea<br>with us how you would do something so<br>there are going to be there would be<br>practical<br>about the reli The credibility of the<br>source so if someone say you know<br>someone says oh you know the person<br>appeared to me in a dream and they said<br>that actually they wanted all their<br>money to go to me um or you know<br>whatever it might be but but I do think<br>yeah it is it certainly follows from<br>what I've said and what I think that we<br>ought to not dismiss<br>those kinds of of claims right<br>and and lots of lots of I mean there are<br>lots of cultures and lots of traditions<br>where people<br>do act<br>on messages that are that are believed<br>to have come back from the from the<br>person after they after they're dead and<br>we<br>shouldn't I mean we shouldn't accept<br>that they're all true but we should<br>evaluate them as as claims that are<br>being made that that at least might be<br>might be true and certainly certainly<br>there claims that if you had reason to<br>believe they were true they would be<br>very relevant to what you should do with<br>regard to the person 's remains or their<br>assets or<br>their reputation or or whatever it was<br>so if it was something you know where<br>you if you if you were expending effort<br>in a particular way because you thought<br>that was good for that person and it was<br>helping them out and then they sent a<br>message through saying look that's<br>really you know you don't understand<br>what it's like here this is not this is<br>not helping it's not helping having all<br>these people praying for me it just you<br>know upsets all the other people in<br>Hamilton because no one's praying for<br>them and stop it or or whatever the<br>story might be then that would be<br>relevant information to what we should<br>do if our reason for doing what we're<br>doing is that we think it's in the<br>person's continuing interests right<br>whereas on the other hand if someone<br>said look we're not doing this for the<br>interest of the dead person at all we're<br>just doing this cuz this Comforts us or<br>this is our tradition<br>or you know really upsets the people in<br>the other religion if we do this thing<br>so we do it as loudly as possible and<br>that's why we do it if those are your<br>reasons for doing it then you're not<br>going to be interested in whether it<br>still is in the interest of the dead<br>person but if you're saying we're doing<br>this because it is in the interest of<br>the dead person then you should be open<br>to the idea that there could be<br>information about what was or wasn't in<br>the interest of that dead person and<br>there are as you say there are very very<br>established religious Traditions which<br>do make room for that kind<br>of information and you're certainly not<br>respecting those if you just say well<br>that must be nonsense because it's<br>purporting to come it's purporting to<br>tell us these sorts of things good we<br>have a question up<br>here um thanks for the I I have a<br>question about um I I I realize that<br>what you're doing is you're more<br>interested in reasons than you are in<br>values and this sort of thing but I<br>still I want to push you in the<br>direction of values to ask you um is<br>there are there a set of um measures by<br>which we can kind of plot certain types<br>of legal situations in a better or worse<br>way according to the kinds of um at<br>least implied values that I hear you<br>saying so one thing that I hear you<br>speaking out against is presentism in<br>both senses of the word right as in the<br>kind of metaphysics of presence but also<br>presentism in time and the so could we<br>say so for the purposes of this kind of<br>question could we add then another case<br>which I think is very important in this<br>context which is the recent Ellis case<br>that came um in the in the Supreme Court<br>in New Zealand right where we have a<br>person who's on trial for murder who<br>dies during appeal and is then uh you<br>know the question becomes should the<br>should the should the appeal continue<br>and then this was the the reason that uh<br>uh tikanga was brought in in the<br>decision tikanga was said to be a<br>principle of common law and therefore<br>under the principle of Mana the the the<br>trial had to go on that that is not a<br>presentist uh kind of worldview if you<br>like is that better say than the batan<br>case where it was a completely presst<br>kind of rationale on the part of the<br>Judiciary and are you even comfortable<br>with you know plotting better and worse<br>in this kind of uh<br>argument um<br>thank you so I um as a disclaimer so I<br>don't do<br>law um at at all so I mean I know people<br>who do and I um and I do yeah I think<br>those cases are<br>really are really interesting and I<br>think there's a lot of things going on I<br>mean I do think<br>that in that particular case it's<br>overdetermined I would say um in that<br>there<br>are there are lots of different views<br>that will get you to the result that<br>people have an interest in their<br>reputation after their dead right and<br>so so it's not it's not clear how much<br>you would need to get into the kinds of<br>issues that I'm that I'm talking about<br>because an awful lot of people who have<br>very different views about what happens<br>to you after you die including an awful<br>lot of people who think that when you<br>die you completely cease to exist one of<br>the things they will agree about is that<br>even after you're dead if you've been<br>subject to a miscarriage of of Justice<br>then that should be corrected right and<br>so<br>so it's<br>not it's not clear to me I mean it would<br>you could you could bring in and and<br>they did for various for various reasons<br>bring<br>in particular views about what happens<br>after you die or particular ways of<br>thinking about the rights and and<br>but it's a less interesting case than<br>than some others for for from my<br>perspective because it it doesn't seem<br>to me that the answer you're going to<br>give to the question can you allow the<br>appeal<br>to should you morally speaking allow an<br>appeal to continue after someone's died<br>you're not going to get you're not going<br>to get different answers to that<br>questions from different people who<br>think different things about what<br>happens to you after you die I don't<br>know if<br>that okay we'll take one more question<br>ah right it's not going to be a mean<br>question Tim I've heard that before<br>um I I'm just going to say um is it just<br>it's not just um as were atheists and um<br>I think one should say predestinarian<br>Protestants who think that you're um<br>that um your vital interests if one can<br>describe them as such for dead people<br>can't be affected by what people do<br>there are quite a lot of religious<br>Traditions which basically<br>think once you're dead you may indeed<br>have<br>interests but you're not crucially<br>affected by what happens<br>to happens to the people or what happens<br>to your body um now there of course<br>there are some and there are some that<br>that you have interest but they're<br>temporary so a strict Catholic will<br>think<br>that if somebody died in a state of<br>grace but they had a bad you know excuse<br>me they had a bad<br>life sometimes you can curtail their<br>time in<br>Perry by think you<br>do<br>EXC uh but<br>ultimately they're either saved or<br>they're<br>not and what people do for them will<br>make a difference many other religious<br>Traditions will think karma karma<br>catches up with you and you can't do a<br>lot for the dead person by anything you<br>do so my thought is for quite a<br>lot not just atheism and<br>protestantism<br>um the<br>the the essential Arguments for<br>respecting people's interests are going<br>to go with the ones um uh that are<br>accessible to the Protestant and the uh<br>and the atheist it isn't just those two<br>it's quite a variety of religious<br>Traditions I don't know if that helps<br>with theal argument but it might help a<br>little<br>bit<br>okay thank you yeah now that's helpful I<br>think<br>so<br>um so part of what's going on with the<br>argument I think is there's<br>a there's a kind of argument that that's<br>in the background that's in that's in<br>Winnie Sullivan's work and in other<br>people's work which is a historical<br>explanation of where we've where we've<br>got to and why what's thought of as<br>religious freedom and religious<br>neutrality takes the particular form it<br>does and in that case what does the work<br>is putting atheism and certain kinds of<br>protestantism particularly the kind of<br>protestantism that involves not<br>believing in purgatory putting those on<br>on one side together and<br>putting Roman Catholicism on the other<br>right so historically<br>it's it's thought people will argue<br>that what's thought of as liberalism<br>which is meant to be liberal to<br>everything is liberal to every kind of<br>protestantism because it's an or most<br>kinds of protestantism because it's an<br>alliance between Protestants and various<br>other people<br>against certain kinds of of Catholic<br>view so so historically there might be<br>an explanation of why that particular<br>overlap is the one that that matters I<br>suppose I mean the broader point for my<br>argument<br>is it doesn't matter so<br>much how many people there are on which<br>side as long as there are some people on<br>the other side and one of the things<br>that I one of the other things that I<br>had in<br>my in one of the many many earlier<br>versions of the talk that I<br>have not given and which I won't now<br>give um but which I thought about giving<br>one of the things I didn't talk about is<br>that one of the things that seems to be<br>operating in the in the clava case and<br>in the Egyptian case is that it's a<br>really really long time ago and one of<br>the things we do take for granted or we<br>seem to take for granted is that someone<br>who's been dead a really really really<br>long time doesn't have any interest<br>anymore so you sort of think you know<br>we're getting<br>there and you know it's we're 4,000<br>years too late to do anything right for<br>the person so it might be as you say<br>that the real disagreements are<br>mostly not around what can we do for the<br>ancient Egyptian because you<br>think that's probably you once the tomb<br>was looted that's probably it um you<br>know you can't put them back together<br>very easily um or you know they've<br>either gone to wherever they were going<br>or they haven't and there nothing we can<br>do about it and similarly for the clava<br>people but it's a disagreement between<br>about what you can do in<br>the hours days weeks maybe the first<br>year after the person dies but that can<br>still matter a lot<br>right or or there might be being<br>remembered by people for the first<br>generation or two might matter more on<br>some views than it than it does on<br>others so it might be that the only dead<br>people whose interests we can affect are<br>the relatively recently<br>dead and those are also the people those<br>are also going to be the cases where<br>particular living people are<br>involved right so they are going to be<br>the cases that generate the the problem<br>and generate the the conflict right<br>so so I think yeah it might be not as<br>big a<br>problem or not as wi b a problem as I<br>was perhaps suggesting that you know<br>that everybody's in one of these<br>traditions where they think that the<br>dead have have interests but there still<br>are going to be cases and it's still<br>true that an awful lot of funeral<br>practices<br>if you come in from the outside and you<br>say to people why are you doing that<br>they will give you a story which at face<br>value is a story about how this is<br>helping the person who was who is now<br>dead right and it seems to me the<br>respectful thing to do is to say right<br>okay what would it be like if that was<br>actually true and if this was necessary<br>to help the person even if it's just<br>helping them to get to<br>Hamilton and on that that might be<br>um on behalf of the philosophy program<br>at aago it's my pleasure to welcome<br>everybody who's here to join us and<br>Professor Mullan afterward for uh drinks<br>and nibbles over in the staff club which<br>is just over Yonder uh so thanks to Dan<br>Gwen Taylor for that as well uh but<br>before we go over there and continue the<br>discussion uh thank you very much for a<br>pleas</p></main><footer style="margin-top: 2rem; background: #0001;
