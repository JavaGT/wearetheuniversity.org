on her speech at the UN<br>for those of you who have seen it um I<br>think it's a remarkable speech and for<br>those of you who haven't um I recommend<br>you go and find it on online when you go<br>home it's a great speech and um I was<br>really proud to see you speaking and um<br>I started crying when you broke into<br>song at the end I found that very<br>emotional actually and seeing all the<br>New Zealand contingent stand up and sing<br>t with you so very special and we're<br>very honored to have you here today and<br>thank you very much for agreeing to come<br>um thank you also to the other speakers<br>who are going to speak today for me I<br>also have a connection with this um<br>piece of land uh and a connection with L<br>and clear in particular so um I did my<br>llm up here and um I did my PhD I was<br>had a little study room in keroa so I<br>spent quite a few years under stress and<br>um hiding from L and clear sometimes L<br>was my chief supervisor on my PhD and CA<br>was also on my supervisory panel with<br>Margaret B good making up the um the<br>Trinity and uh yes it was a memorable<br>time and so Al and CLA have been with me<br>I've known them for 20 about 23 years<br>actually so it's actually a coming home<br>for me too copora doesn't stand here<br>anymore but the law school was actually<br>on the site where the par is now and so<br>you're also coming home to your place<br>where you started out as well so yeah I<br>just wanted to say that this is a really<br>special time for me and I'm really<br>grateful that um Naya made time for this<br>in her schedule so how we're going to<br>proceed is um I'm going to hand over we<br>have three speakers from uh tiping The<br>Faculty of law which used to be here and<br>it's now in the fancy building across<br>the road uh so we have uh Lani tuala<br>Warren uh Clea Breen and El gispie so um<br>they're all professors uh in the law<br>school um and I will introduce them one<br>by one and say a few words about them<br>before they speak they've got about five<br>minutes to make a few remarks and maybe<br>end with a question for the minister and<br>then after that um we're going to hear<br>from nay Maha now of course she's here<br>today not in her ministerial capacity<br>but as the labor spokesperson on Foreign<br>Affairs so I just you know make that<br>clear that she's here supporting me in<br>my campaign as a spokesperson on Foreign<br>Affairs today but uh she will then speak<br>for as long as she wishes um and then<br>we'll have some questions to wrap up uh<br>at the end so without further Ado um I<br>would like to introduce our first<br>Speaker today Professor leani tuala<br>Warren who joined the law school in July<br>2020 three I think um and Lani uh has a<br>very distinguished career she is uh<br>still a um a Supreme Court Justice of<br>Samara am I correct about the yes she's<br>not sitting in the Supreme Court right<br>now but she still holds a warrant to sit<br>on the Supreme Court and she was sitting<br>during the Constitutional crisis in 2021<br>when there was a series of cases which<br>um you might be familiar with so I'm<br>going to hand over now to Professor<br>you thank you<br>Maya and Tava warm Pacific greetings to<br>The Honorable Minister nay mahuta and of<br>course members of the audience um I will<br>speak briefly today about our democracy<br>in the Pacific and how I think New<br>Zealand fears in promoting that<br>democracy and it needs to be<br>acknowledged firstly that um political<br>systems of the Pacific Islands were<br>inherited and imported from elsewhere<br>and despite that though Pacific Islands<br>have mostly shown a very strong<br>commitment to the maintenance of their<br>inherited Democratic<br>institutions and generally on the whole<br>Pacific Islands have a good track record<br>uh of holding regular free and um Fair<br>elections for examp example Tonga held<br>its first election under reformed<br>electoral and constitutional<br>Arrangements in November 20110 after<br>public protests for major constitutional<br>change and it should be noted that<br>Democratic institutions are more than<br>the holding of fair elections organizing<br>and speaking freely and expressing<br>oneself Through The Ballot Box elections<br>and parliaments are the cornerstones of<br>democratic systems but the strength of<br>democracy relies on a broader ecosystem<br>encompassing the media Civil Society<br>education system and the inclusion of<br>historically underrepresented uh<br>groups Inseparable from the operation of<br>democracy is the upholding of<br>professionalism and Independence of both<br>the Judiciary and the police Democratic<br>norms and practices have a solid<br>foundation in the Pacific but recent<br>events are reminded is that a proper<br>understanding of the respective roles of<br>the legislature the executive the<br>Judiciary and the police cannot be taken<br>for granted in our region so what are<br>these recent events in 2022 the Papua<br>New guinean general election was plagued<br>by delays issues with the Electoral role<br>and concerning incidents of violence<br>resulting in many fatalities and<br>thousands of displayed citizens<br>transparency International PNG stated<br>that the election continued the trend of<br>deterioration of the quality of<br>elections in<br>PNG now both Fiji and the Solomon<br>Islands have experienced ethnic<br>conflicts um culminating in cools and<br>the forcable removal of democratically<br>elected governments the general election<br>in Fiji in 2022 pitched as a showdown<br>between two former cool leaders ramuka<br>and bnie marama resulted in a hung<br>Parliament with the social liberal<br>Democratic party holding the balance of<br>power and in the aftermath of the<br>election amid messy negotiations to form<br>coalition government there were serious<br>concerns that a peaceful transfer of<br>power would not take place Ruka accused<br>banim marama of sowing fear and Chaos in<br>an attempt to maintain power ultimately<br>an agreement was reached and on<br>Christmas Eve R buer was sworn in as the<br>Prime Minister a significant milestone<br>in fiji's Democratic history now in kbus<br>which withdrew from the Pacific Islands<br>Forum in July<br>2022 the government attempted to deport<br>one of its high court justices David<br>lambor was also the husband of Cub Us's<br>opposition leader in the aftermath four<br>other senior judges were suspended and<br>that left the country without an<br>operational High Court carabus attorney<br>general was appointed acting Chief<br>Justice in October 2022 and the New<br>Zealand Law Society argued that this<br>appointment would challenge the<br>independence of the Judiciary and the<br>Constitution separation of powers that<br>is fundamental to a functioning<br>democracy in Solomon Islands the<br>election originally scheduled to be<br>called by may this year is delayed until<br>2024 with the government claiming it<br>could not for to host both the Pacific<br>games and hold an election in the same<br>year and a member of the opposition and<br>outspoken outspoken critic of the<br>government labeled it an authoritarian<br>move extending terms of government has<br>also been done before in the region<br>notably in samur in the early<br>1990s now which brings me to samur which<br>is long being touted as the B Beacon<br>sorry of democracy and political<br>stability in the Pacific Pacific in 2021<br>s experienced a deadlock in election<br>results with subsequent efforts to<br>delegitimize the court through<br>allegations of judicial bias and<br>undermine the Court's role to interpret<br>the Constitution and adjudicate disputes<br>according to the law while frightening<br>at the time thankfully due to the<br>judicial branch working as it should in<br>a democracy samur got through its<br>troubles and now has a new government it<br>did highlight the most essential feature<br>of democracy is that political parties<br>accept their<br>losses now the Pacific is the region in<br>which New Zealand matters the most<br>wields the most influence and has the<br>most impact and those are words which<br>are used in New Zealand's uh Pacific<br>reset which was launched by the<br>government prime minister jinda adur and<br>which has been described as the most<br>significant shift in policy towards the<br>Pacific Island region in decades the<br>Pacific redress is to address New<br>Zealand's eroding influence and its<br>ability to pursue its interests in the<br>region the Pacific reset is seen as a<br>cultural change for New Zealand a move<br>towards pen Pacific rather than New<br>Zealand specific approach to issues it<br>seeks to advance New Zealand's interest<br>through influencing public diplomacy<br>Target audiences because it believes<br>publics in the Pacific can influence<br>domestic poit politics in the Pacific<br>the values cited by mfat diplomats<br>included democracy human rights equality<br>and especially especially gender<br>equality governance transparency respect<br>for Law and the international rules uh<br>fairness and the notion of environmental<br>guardianship so the focus of the reset<br>is on a two-way engagement a term which<br>encompasses dialogue Partnerships<br>listening and collaboration and other<br>characteristics include more<br>non-governmental actors social media and<br>a greater connection between the<br>domestic and international and I believe<br>that this Pacific reset is a move in the<br>right direction and two focuses of the<br>resear reset are especially significant<br>the first is its focus on connections<br>between domestic New Zealand audiences<br>and audiences in the Pacific as<br>providing another method of promulgating<br>New Zealand values New Zealand's<br>commitment for example to a free press<br>and to democracy are values of the New<br>Zealand Pacific communities and these<br>communities can promote these values to<br>their families and through their<br>connections to people in the Pacific<br>island nations this is significant as<br>around 7% of new zealanders are Pacifica<br>in origin a second focus in is the<br>incorp operation of social media work in<br>the New Zealand Pacific public diplomacy<br>both from its head office and through<br>each diplomatic post which has its own<br>Facebook Instagram and Twitter feeds<br>social media is a powerful tool of<br>Engagement and for information and<br>sharing that information to new and<br>hardto reach audiences and I use Tonga<br>as an example of this in in 2005<br>overseas Tongan financially supported<br>the civil servants strike in Tonga which<br>helped sustain that strike for six weeks<br>through the internet they were able to<br>monitor on a daily basis events in the<br>country and take part in National<br>discourse in short overseas Tongans were<br>directly and significantly involved in<br>National Affairs and it'll be virtually<br>impossible to stop them particularly<br>with the communication Revolution<br>brought about by the internet tonga's<br>leading news portal the matanga online<br>had more than 43 million hits for the<br>year ending 31 May 2006 unencumbered by<br>space restrictions the internet allowed<br>Tongans a great say in National fears<br>than<br>newspapers and perhaps the best way to<br>put into practice public diplomacy is to<br>listen to Pacific voices and connect the<br>listens and insights of these voices<br>heard through engagement to practice and<br>I applaud New Zealand's Pacific reset as<br>we need in the Pacific to continue to<br>invest in building the key institutions<br>of democracy and and the understanding<br>of the need of each to respect the role<br>of the others and in short New Zealand<br>needs to continue to promote Universal<br>Democratic rights in and values sorry in<br>the Pacific and the challenge now as I<br>see it is for New Zealand to remain<br>relevant in the face of a rapidly<br>changing Pacific landscape given the<br>pressure from other countries which may<br>not share the same Democratic Values<br>relevance has to be F felt at the co-ace<br>that is on the ground in those islands<br>and New Zealand I think has to be<br>congratulated for striking the right<br>balance when it comes to its<br>relationship with its closest neighbors<br>and perhaps to end off I was wondering<br>honorable Minister um what your thoughts<br>were on this reset now that it's been<br>years y thank you uh Professor TOA<br>Warren so we are going to move to our<br>second speaker uh so Professor CLA Breen<br>is um a world renowned expert on human<br>rights she holds a PhD from the<br>University of Nottingham and her main<br>fields of research are human rights law<br>public international law international<br>humanitarian law and international human<br>rights law um her PhD was in the area of<br>child rights but since then uh CA has<br>branched out enormously and um is is a<br>really well published and well respected<br>author so without further Ado I will<br>you Ro<br>glair um thank you Myra and Al for<br>organizing this event today and thank<br>thank you Minister for joining us um I<br>would like to talk about the centrality<br>of the promotion and protection of human<br>rights to the maintenance of<br>International Peace and security so in<br>that way combining two of my uh research<br>interests um the importance of human<br>rights in the post World War II order<br>was signaled um in 1945 with the<br>adoption of the UN Charter New Zealand<br>was an active participant then in the<br>drafting process of the charter and the<br>charter opens by setting out some of the<br>aims and purposes of the UN amongst<br>those are the maintenance of<br>International Peace and security and the<br>promotion and encouragement of respect<br>for human rights and fundamental<br>freedoms for all without<br>distinction in 1948 the universal<br>Declaration of Human Rights spelled out<br>what those rights were in so doing it<br>made two further points about the<br>importance of human rights in averting<br>con conflict and War and so the<br>Declaration tells us that human rights<br>must be protected by the rule of law so<br>as to make sure that people don't have<br>to resort to Rebellion against tyranny<br>and<br>oppression it also tells us that freedom<br>justice and peace in the world are<br>founded on recognizing Humanity's<br>inherent dignity and everyone's equal<br>and inalienable rights and again New<br>Zealand through prime minister Peter<br>Fraser played a strong role in the<br>drafting of the Declaration and it's<br>also worth noting that December 10th<br>this year marks the 75th anniversary of<br>the adoption of the<br>Declaration within three years of the<br>adoption of the Declaration three other<br>key treaties were adopted to try to<br>mitigate the impact of War upon Humanity<br>the scourge of War as the UN Charter had<br>described it so these treaties were the<br>genocide convention 1948 the Janika<br>conventions from 1949 and the refugee<br>1951 since the 1960s um a com<br>comprehensive framework of human rights<br>law has developed within the UN ala New<br>Zealand has ratified most of the core<br>treaties with the um exception of the<br>International Convention on the rights<br>of Migrant workers and their families<br>and the convention against enforced<br>disappearances<br>but despite the earlier links between<br>peace and security and human rights and<br>despite the fact that much of the treaty<br>law that has developed references this<br>connection between peace security and<br>human rights the UN body of human rights<br>law that developed in those decades<br>since the 1960s seems to have followed a<br>bit of a different path there has been a<br>strong focus on state sovereignty we see<br>that the actual implementation of Rights<br>and States obligation ations is of is<br>primarily a matter for States themselves<br>States efforts in this regard are<br>assessed by a wide range of monitoring<br>and review<br>mechanisms and this state of affairs<br>reflects one of the major criticisms of<br>the un's human rights regime which is<br>its apparent inability to secure real<br>and significant change what we see is<br>human rights abusers continuing with<br>State sovereignty often acting as a<br>shield to intern National intervention<br>uh or in some cases any real meaningful<br>discussion but in spite of this apparent<br>silo effect human rights have succeeded<br>in making their presence felt beyond the<br>human rights legal framework and the<br>somewhat narrow array of uh regular<br>reporting<br>mechanisms in particular we can see that<br>about 30 years ago the security Council<br>began to formally recognize that grow<br>gross human rights abuses signaled a<br>descent or could signal a descent into<br>Civil War and that Civil War was a<br>threat to International Peace and<br>security not long after that the<br>promotion and protection of Human Rights<br>found its way into Security Council<br>debates resolutions that authorized<br>peace operations that were set up to<br>maintain or restore International Peace<br>and<br>security aloa New Zealand has served on<br>the Security Council on four occasions<br>starting in 1954 and ending most<br>recently in 2016 New Zealand has also<br>contributed to peace operations both<br>regionally and further a field from<br>Korea to Cambodia Iraq former Yugoslavia<br>through to Timor Lee and the Solomon<br>Islands the link between human rights<br>and armed conflict is also established<br>from within the human rights Arena<br>within the UN<br>so the Human Rights Council can<br>investigate alleged human rights abuses<br>within member states and it has has<br>established a number of fact-f finding<br>commissions to investigate human rights<br>violations in various conflict zones uh<br>such as liby Syria and<br>Ukraine but the fact that states can uh<br>engage and gross human rights uh<br>violations or face allegations of that<br>whilst also being a member of the<br>council is one of the biggest criticisms<br>of this<br>body in response to that the observation<br>has been made that no International<br>institution is perfect many have serious<br>flaws but walking away won't fix them<br>principled engagement<br>might and so my question for you<br>honorable minister is when it comes to<br>Human Rights and the intern the<br>maintenance of International Peace and<br>security at a global level what do you<br>think should be out here on New<br>Zealand's priorities within the next few<br>mahot thank you very much CLA uh that<br>was excellent and um our third and final<br>speaker is Professor Al gispie so most<br>of you will know who Al is he's a<br>frequent commentator in the media on<br>Foreign Affairs and basically all things<br>legal I would say Al Al's the author of<br>um 21 books so let that sink in 21 books<br>that's a lot of uh a lot of hours a lot<br>of sweat a lot of maybe tears but El's a<br>um a really well-known uh writer on um<br>uh international law all things<br>international law so I won't um speak<br>any longer I will refer to Al thanks so<br>comments Minister M it's an honor to<br>have you here today um and I also want<br>to acknowledge the work of your father<br>but for what he did not just for the<br>University but for the law school it's<br>rare that you can see a seed grow into<br>something that large across the road um<br>I wonder sometimes when I look back on<br>your tenure as foreign minister if you'd<br>been told in advance what was going to<br>happen whether you would have taken it<br>or whether the portfolio of being<br>minister of racing might have been more<br>appealing certainly there are times<br>because I don't think many people<br>understand the fly will that you are as<br>foreign minister whether you're dealing<br>with defense or trade or human rights<br>for Economic Security it all goes<br>through you but right now I must admit a<br>degree of somewhat disappointment<br>because it's like season one has just<br>finished I don't know what's going to<br>happen in season two and it's about one<br>of those series on Netflix which just<br>like builds you up and there's so much<br>excitement happening and then it's about<br>to stop and we're not sure what's there<br>but when I look at trade I see the way<br>that with your health the evolution of<br>our policy in recent years our<br>completion of the comprehensive<br>Progressive agreement on the<br>trans-pacific partnership the work with<br>the UK the work with the European Union<br>this ability to diversify and to make<br>sure all of our eggs are not in one<br>basket is very commendable but for<br>season two Minister I ask what what what<br>happens with the fragmentation of<br>international law when the sanctions<br>start to expand we've done great work<br>with regards to the Russian sanctions<br>and Iran but how do we could make sure<br>that doesn't EXP and what do we do with<br>the applications of China and Taiwan to<br>the same trade agreement and how do we<br>continue to<br>diversify with what lannie said about<br>the Pacific I fully agree through your<br>stewardship I believe that the Pacific<br>is much more now on the spotlight than<br>it has been for a long time arguably<br>it's too much in the spotlight now<br>because there was a point where it was<br>almost invisible but now there's<br>invitations to Washington there's<br>invitations to Beijing there's money<br>there's debt there's Aid the dance card<br>of the Pacific leaders is full and we<br>watch them so closely to who's dancing<br>with who and who's been sned by<br>who but I say in season two what happens<br>next do do we increase our Aid do we go<br>from 0.23% to<br>0.7 do we work more cooperatively with<br>other countries not in the region about<br>what development looks like and the one<br>area that I fear that gray area between<br>police security and Military was what we<br>see in the Solomons and what we now see<br>in East teore what there will happen I<br>don't know your work with China<br>remarkable I'm being honest here it's<br>fantastic what you've done to actually<br>Embassy to manage us in a way that our<br>trade has continued to grow to avoid a<br>dispute that other countries have got<br>into but on the other hand to let our<br>voice be heard on human rights on<br>Regional Security on undue<br>influence fantastic but my question for<br>season two will our Navy continue to<br>support the Freedom of the Seas<br>initiatives as we have<br>previously what do we do with regional<br>arms control and what do we do with<br>human rights concerns that become so<br>significant that when we push them to<br>the UN and we can't get them through the<br>Human Rights Council what do we do then<br>with so much<br>Faith the balance on defense excellent<br>again we've moved closer to Nato we've<br>renewed relationships with Australia and<br>Japan and to your credit a decision was<br>not made on orus but all the information<br>for the public is now there and so we<br>can have a full and informed debate<br>about what whether we do or do not join<br>and so I think this is a progress people<br>understand the need for defense<br>there's been a maturity in the way that<br>we see our position not just in terms of<br>a regional police officer but also<br>potentially as a military force again<br>things that we didn't want to think<br>about for such a long time but in the<br>next season what do we do with orus<br>where do we set the GDP figure on how<br>much we give to defense and what do we<br>do with Australia because our<br>belligerent friends Australia does tend<br>to get into fight sometimes with other<br>countries I think your best work if I'm<br>honest was the Ukraine<br>I think the way that you've managed to<br>stand up with which was an outrageous<br>breach of the United Nations Charter it<br>was Brave to put New Zealand into a<br>non-neutral position we support them<br>with Finance we support them with the<br>military we support them at the<br>international criminal court and the<br>international court of<br>justice but what's going to happen in<br>season two what happens next what does<br>peace look like I think it's been very<br>easy to support them but what are we<br>willing to compromise on if anything do<br>we compromise on territory do we<br>compromise on war<br>crimes what do we do if the support from<br>our friends Falls away do we continue to<br>support the Ukraine you can watch what's<br>happening overnight with happening in<br>Congress and and the loss of or the<br>contestability of foreign aid for the<br>Ukraine and that of course brings you to<br>the biggest second season of all what<br>happens if Trump gets reelected in<br>November<br>and so we're in this point where I just<br>want to say thank you thank you for your<br>stewardship through a very difficult<br>part of our global history and<br>representing our country so well but my<br>question for you is out of all the<br>foreign policy discussions what keeps<br>night thank you very much l so uh before<br>I hand over to Niah to respond I just<br>want to say that um when El set up the<br>structure for this I think he said each<br>person will get to ask the minister one<br>question just want to<br>say I was writing it down and I think<br>there's at least a dozen questions there<br>so um you know you didn't stick to your<br>own rules but that's okay so I'll let<br>I'll let niia choose which questions she<br>wants to respond to because I don't<br>think there's any way she can respond to<br>all of those questions they're really<br>great questions but I think um we would<br>probably exceed the time limit if we try<br>to answer all of them but I'll let her<br>pick and choose um and yeah I'll hand<br>over to you so I don't waste any more of<br>our precious time thank you very much<br>all<br>um and just a brief acknowledgement of<br>this place and uh what it does to ensure<br>that the uh Minds uh of all our people<br>can be nurtured and inspired uh to<br>pursue and seek knowledge in a way that<br>is for the benef the people which is the<br>top of the University that certainly<br>something that I can connect to given<br>all our years with this place thank you<br>for the opportunity for coming to have a<br>cord it all and we're all out on the<br>campaign Trail hence the the uh sneakers<br>we've got these boots are made for<br>walking and we've just got to get around<br>and do what we can uh when Mara asked me<br>to uh come along and sit and have a bit<br>of a conversation it was with the<br>understanding this that this would be as<br>free flowing and engaging as it possibly<br>could given that the subject matter was<br>Foreign Affairs just by way way of<br>context uh when I came into the uh role<br>as Minister of Foreign Affairs I'd<br>actually thought I'd make the best case<br>possible uh to just sender around being<br>the minister for<br>infrastructure I quickly realized she<br>had other plans and when she said to me<br>N I think that uh you should think about<br>taking on uh foreign affairs to which I<br>had no CH knowledge except an interest<br>in the world I said to her are you sure<br>and she said to be so sure and I said<br>you do know that it would be a very<br>different landscape from the one that<br>I've inherited and she said for that<br>reason but more importantly the Pacific<br>region is so important to New Zealand I<br>think you could probably spend quite a<br>bit of effort building our relationship<br>with the Pacific at a time when it is<br>actually really required um so don't<br>leave it to chance and then there were<br>other conversations but just wanted to<br>give you that context because you are<br>not taught how to be a minister of<br>foreign Affair and I don't care what<br>anyone says people who have come into<br>this portfolio it's uh know that it's an<br>absolute privilege but Steady As She<br>Goes in terms of the ship that we<br>inherit uh it is very much based on a<br>long Legacy of developing uh our<br>independent foreign policy what that<br>means but also a strong diplomatic<br>footprint that keeps the relationships<br>that we have across the globe quite<br>stable and necessarily so that said uh<br>there there were a few things I knew<br>instinctively that I could bring to the<br>portfolio that would be a point of<br>difference and I'll kind of go through<br>this as I answer the questions one the<br>relationship element because if we<br>consider that um foreign policy uh is<br>about some key ingredients like making a<br>cake it's about architecture it's about<br>the international rules based Norms how<br>that reflects itself how we continue to<br>build confidence in those Norms uh it's<br>about also uh ensuring that we continue<br>to be a a as a small country I believe a<br>strong contributor to the International<br>Community and our multilateral effort uh<br>therefore relationships matter so those<br>are some key ingredients that I think I<br>don't know what the academics but that I<br>think those are key ingredients to<br>understand the nature of the task that<br>you've inherited as you uh Steed this<br>kind of a portfolio through and if<br>relationships do matter we have to<br>understand context and place face uh<br>context is that we are a small country<br>that is often looked to by the global<br>community in a way where we are seen to<br>hold a level of Integrity in the way<br>that we uh conduct ourselves within the<br>International<br>Community and we do that because we're a<br>small country we're reliant on the<br>relationships our multilateral kind of<br>stance generally the fact that we have<br>stood and voiced our concerns on really<br>important issues that have have been<br>defined by our region like our nuclear<br>free stance we're the only country that<br>has a ministerial portfolio that is<br>completely designated for a minister of<br>the seron and that in itself sends a<br>signal to the world that we take these<br>issues seriously it's not the service we<br>convey a spirit of belief that nuclear<br>arms in our world is actually not our<br>future and so I feel that that's<br>something really quite important the<br>other element that we have continued um<br>to to highlight and probably more in a<br>contemporary context is climate change<br>as the existential challenge for our<br>region which is only been Amplified uh<br>by Pacific States and we join that voice<br>and we know that that is more and more<br>continuing to shape uh how people<br>perceive New Zealand and uh perhaps our<br>uh ability to lead out in in certain<br>aspects and then as a small country we<br>have been a quick and earlier adopter of<br>a free trade agreements and that's<br>evolved over time uh being the first<br>country to reach a free trade agreement<br>with China for example in 2008 I was<br>minister of Customs at the time and uh<br>was responsible for all the back room<br>functions and getting over to China to<br>figure out how we're going to make it<br>practically work for our export<br>Community but long story short is we<br>embraced free trade in a way that we've<br>continued to evolve Progressive trade<br>agreements that have greater cognizance<br>of environmental benefits greater<br>cognizance of the new economy space um<br>and digital economy Partnerships and the<br>like and greater cognizance that if<br>we're doing free trade in a way that<br>matters for the future then we have to<br>have a greater emphasis on the benefits<br>to small to medium Enterprises and that<br>ecosystem because in many of the<br>countries that we want to have trade<br>agreements with uh women are actually<br>the backbone of the economy so woman and<br>and Enterprise does matter an<br>interesting and helpful fact which might<br>in part answer some of your questions<br>about the trade context in terms of our<br>um export platform 70% of our trade<br>agreements<br>cover the pretty much what what<br>offerings we have across the globe and<br>then there's 30% that we have a um TBC<br>or TBA kind of approach to India India<br>doesn't want a free trade agreement with<br>New Zealand and therefore we have to<br>find other ways to provide and extract<br>value between the relationship and it<br>could be a sector by sector approach<br>with India which they're quite open to<br>and it and our entry point with India<br>May well be by way of Direct businesso<br>business relationships enabled by<br>government so that's a conversation<br>space that we're in now the GCC um we<br>stalled because of relationships in<br>primarily with Saudi Arabia um but that<br>is an area now that is currently under<br>discussion and we are trying to<br>accelerate uh the potential for an<br>opportunity to reach an agreement with<br>the GCC through the United Arab Emirates<br>who are very keen for a bilateral<br>relationship uh with New Zealand<br>probably for Border reasons in actual<br>trade but the point of it is if we can<br>use that as an accelerant to push the<br>GCC arangements ahead uh that's great<br>and then there are smaller uh other<br>bespoke uh types of arrangements<br>my point being that we are as a small<br>nation being very proactive in the trade<br>space we um should be proud of what we<br>have achieved um but importantly we<br>should now use trade as an opportunity<br>to get cut through in the areas where we<br>have many concerns um and human rights<br>is one of them actually and we can<br>figure out how do we have these<br>conversations because for example with<br>the African Union um and a very<br>interesting set of relationships going<br>forward but a really important set of<br>challenges uh when it comes to uh human<br>rights and um you know stable and<br>institutions the um Pacific relationship<br>this is a really important pieces I<br>alluded to that I have focused a lot of<br>effort on um you have to remember that<br>the first problem 15 to 18 months of my<br>tenure we had covid and lockdowns and I<br>it had occurred to me having done a<br>whole heap of Zoom meetings in<br>bilaterals that I could well be the<br>first foreign minister that would never<br>travel and I was starting to get quite<br>nervous about that because people often<br>criticize the amount of effort you put<br>into People to People connections and<br>diplomacy um at that level but what I<br>can say is at a ministerial level when<br>you are meeting with your counterpart<br>part in person you can cut through a lot<br>of Guff um and that's from from our<br>often our um advisors about what are the<br>things that you should say but we are<br>not in tick um tick boox uh diplomacy<br>anymore because the issues are too<br>complex and too challenging we need to<br>get to some pretty direct conversations<br>very quickly and that's why sitting<br>across the table from someone so that<br>they get the measure of you and what<br>matters to you and your country things<br>that you're trying to achieve can often<br>Leap Frog probably a whole heap of<br>paperwork that takes months and months<br>to put together to provide you with<br>advice to get you probably only half a<br>step away so I'm a I I I had to learn<br>how to get to the best diplomatic um<br>mode that I could for New Zealand and<br>actually people are people everywhere<br>they they like straight talking they<br>might not like what you say um but to<br>characterize some some of the most<br>complex relationships uh that we have<br>and and uh they have been commented on<br>if we're uh consistent predictable and<br>respectful and we get all the heart<br>issues out of the way and we say it face<br>to face before we say it out in public<br>often while it's not liked it's<br>understood while it's not liked it's<br>understood and I in our most complex<br>relationships with larger uh partners<br>and and actors that's definitely uh the<br>approach that I've taken um what that<br>means is that uh on issues like human<br>rights we don't have to recoil uh from<br>our view on some of the most challenging<br>um issues in the human rights space and<br>China has been the area where we've<br>highlighted um uh these particular<br>issues at a time when um there there was<br>a very much uh globally there there it<br>was a challenge space to think about<br>China and and how do you manage<br>relationship uh having been as<br>consistent as we have been uh many um of<br>our um traditional partners and those<br>who are strong multilateralist have come<br>and sort out New Zealand's approach um<br>and perhaps without putting too fine a<br>point on it and I don't want to put too<br>fine a point of it but it was when I<br>heard um uh up in the EU V's speech<br>around decoupling uh the the CH for uh<br>the European Union is to drisk not<br>decouple in terms of its relationship<br>with China and what flowed from that<br>from the European States was exactly<br>that kind of approach um so that they<br>could manage this complex relationship<br>with China in a way at Mid where we had<br>got<br>to um I uh coming back to the Pacific<br>China has been a player uh a long-term<br>player uh in the<br>region and<br>sometimes I think we underestimate now<br>the Papa connections across the<br>Pacific that have integrated with uh the<br>Chinese population which is not<br>necessarily the CCP so we have to kind<br>of be a bit sensitive to that but I'm<br>being sensitive to that uh Pacific<br>States are trying to themselves uh<br>figure out how do we manage the<br>Strategic composition uh that<br>competition in our region between China<br>and the us but but also other<br>development Partners who are crowding<br>into the Pacific making the dance card<br>very full to use your term now um and so<br>where we have arrived at is actually if<br>we as members of the Pacific start to<br>voice out that the centrality of the<br>Pacific it rests on strengthening the<br>Pacific island Forum uh which is re that<br>the regional architecture uh rests on uh<br>ensuring that in no uncertain terms<br>climate change is the ex existential<br>threat that we need greater engagement<br>on and there are priorities that fall<br>from that that have been expressed in<br>the 2050 strategy for the Blue Pacific<br>that is a really significant step<br>forward but then there are other things<br>that New Zealand could do to lean into<br>how we support the resilience of the<br>Pacific so the question to me was what<br>do I think about the reset well the<br>reset was a set of aspirations which<br>have identified in your presentation<br>though Lani all the um expectations that<br>that we would have in terms of engaging<br>in this certain in this way so I<br>inherited the reset and said well<br>actually with climate change being the<br>issue we have to move from reset to<br>resilience we have to fund the way in<br>which our domestic resp pardon response<br>underpins how we work with the Pacific<br>so for example um while we had un um<br>natural disaster response underpinned by<br>the Defense Force um activities that we<br>undertook uh in terms of um<br>strengthening democracy and the role of<br>our electoral commission and being<br>independent observers um our development<br>uh Aid which was pretty much Project<br>based um we had to rethink all of that<br>and in rethinking all of that I<br>basically suggested that we needed a h<br>of government approach and we needed to<br>fund the capacity of that approach in<br>order to bring together um a different<br>way of working with the Pacific taking a<br>Pacific partner lead approach uh<br>ensuring that we could um take a more<br>programmatic uh uh approach to funding<br>so that pafic we're starting to lead the<br>conversation around what were its<br>challenges take climate change for<br>example uh the challenge for much of the<br>Pacific is to have the ca technical<br>capability to bring together its<br>objectives in order to guide<br>uh development Partners in the way in<br>which they were funding into this<br>particular space also uh regulatory um<br>mechanisms so we kind of try to help at<br>least in our B bilateral uh relationship<br>fund into that space to be able to<br>provide greater strategic Investments so<br>that it could guide um other activities<br>and I I can come back to that I think<br>it's a good thing to do because what we<br>were experiencing in hearing from the<br>Pacific was that there's a whole heap of<br>funding out but actually for for small<br>Pacific States to access that funding<br>and the level of administrative burden<br>and the um limited technical<br>capability it would be three or five<br>years before you'd even see the light of<br>day on any funding coming into the<br>Pacific so what we've provided is an<br>accelerated uh opportunity to again set<br>strategic priorities but also uh be a<br>lot more more coordinated in the way<br>that funding can come into the Pacific<br>and now partners of the Blue Pacific<br>like France like Korea like Germany uh<br>like uh the<br>US uh have all and others have all now<br>started to um converge and say we need<br>to figure out how we are more strategic<br>in the way that we partner and fund<br>projects significantly infrastructure<br>projects which only had one Thunder<br>which indeed the Pacific in China uh and<br>so this is a positive um migration of<br>effort if you like um in the way that um<br>things are moving towards Pacific their<br>desperations last thing I would say um<br>not not to finish on the Pacific because<br>everything begins and ends there but I I<br>had to ask myself okay if we<br>were working really well in the Pacific<br>across a number of domains<br>strengthening the bureaucracy through<br>our Pacific Folly um strengthening<br>Democratic institutions through our a<br>layered level of interaction<br>strengthening our support in the<br>judicial system through various ways you<br>know how would that uh create um I guess<br>Credence with the Pacific about the<br>value of the New Zealand relationship so<br>I've expressed to mfed officials you<br>know basically Pacific would refer to us<br>as uh trusted patterns of first<br>preference now they might not say those<br>words but if they point to the kinds of<br>ways of working and examples where this<br>is really what we want more of then I<br>think that is a<br>demonstration of the value of the<br>relationship but the value of our effort<br>to do something different in response to<br>the to the Pacific<br>um so much in in what uh our what you<br>were asking me I I don't I don't know<br>all the answers on all the questions<br>you're asking me and if this is part one<br>you know what did I learn I was up in uh<br>Paris uh for the Paris indopacific<br>Summit that two days before Russia<br>invaded the Ukraine and it was the most<br>curious time to be out there because we<br>were at a summit for the<br>Pacific um and the European unions were<br>in and out of the summit and I asked um<br>I asked the minister foreign minister<br>for Germany I said oh you guys are in<br>and out I don't know if we're getting<br>good value out of this particular<br>meeting she goes well everything's all<br>about Ukraine I said no I absolutely<br>give Ben I I appreciate that and I said<br>well what's the thinking what's the<br>mindset and she said well you know<br>obviously we're all of One mind because<br>we'd had the conversation about the<br>infringement of territorial integrity<br>and sovereignty and we couldn't let uh<br>Russia's Invasion um go um um without<br>Swift action and she said well what<br>we're discussing amongst European Union<br>um uh States is uh Swift economic<br>sanctions and that immediately made me<br>think actually New Zealand had we we<br>didn't have a sanctions<br>that and so in the time frame it took<br>for me to get back from Paris to New<br>Zealand having had a number of calls<br>with the uh the Prime Minister and a<br>relevant cabinet<br>colleagues we we we were of a mind that<br>we need to stand up a sanctions act the<br>Russia sanctions act um very quickly so<br>that we could act in unison and in Step<br>uh with uh other um Partners other<br>members of the International Community<br>and we did that would I do it again like<br>that no I've got a lots of<br>learning but no because I understand the<br>importance of you know um these things<br>and and and process but actually the<br>time necessitated it so you don't start<br>from a place of perfection every time<br>was it the right thing to do absolutely<br>it was and have we been seen to take<br>actions across this um trade and<br>economic sanctions travel banss um<br>humanitarian Aid um being able to<br>provide training supporting the ICC um<br>icj kind of avenues it's been all seen<br>in total as a really um uh uh actually<br>it's a valued contribution it's it's not<br>so much as how much as it is about the<br>breadth of support that we're able to<br>offer Ukraine to defend itself so I<br>think we should be feel quite proud of<br>that it's credible and it's it's it's<br>valued the challenge right now in terms<br>of the conversation space with uh Russia<br>and Ukraine given the global impact uh<br>that it's having is the end game that's<br>the conversation space is is there the<br>prospect of the end game so of course<br>countries like New Zealand would use its<br>influence to say in both my meetings in<br>the prime minister's meeting to China<br>anything you can do to use your<br>influence to bring this to an end really<br>does matter uh however uh in order to<br>return to uh to a opportunity where um<br>negotiation can truly take place in cras<br>degree you know and you know returning<br>um uh back to uh territorial borders<br>internationally agreed territorial<br>borders um uh stopping Uh current uh<br>Warfare and aggression uh within the<br>Ukraine and ensuring that the<br>commencement of peaceful negotiations<br>has the agreement with Ukraine is a<br>starting point it's not the end point<br>because everybody you know solinsky's<br>got a peace process China had a peace<br>process I understand from the bricks<br>meeting there was some conversation<br>there about a peace process um so we use<br>our influence to implore um those who<br>have the greatest influence on Russia to<br>use it<br>sadly uh the end game looks very dim um<br>and this then brings into question how<br>long can can the International Community<br>sustain its support for the Ukraine H<br>and it's a Live question and you rightly<br>point out the challeng es with Congress<br>and getting budgets over the line and I<br>understand from the US um there was an<br>idea that there would be a separate<br>budgetary consideration for Ukraine<br>given it quite and couldn't get it<br>through in the 45 day decision was made<br>just recently so you know it's all a<br>challenge it's all a challenging um<br>situation what keeps me up at night<br>warfare's definitely<br>changed um our regional peace and<br>security<br>um previously was predicated on the size<br>of our Defense<br>Force this comes to the 2% um you know<br>2% avatary Target of um of what is<br>considered internationally as a credible<br>um investment in your uh defense<br>capacity I think for New Zealand given<br>our remoteness in the way that we've got<br>to work we've got to think<br>about uh security defense and resilience<br>all as a group and we need to we also<br>need to figure out uh with our Pacific<br>partners and with Australia and those<br>who are looking at our region what what<br>can we do best together what can we best<br>can we do together uh<br>strategically our region is is an<br>important<br>region but we don't have the population<br>um or the of investment in pure defense<br>capability perhaps for for us ourselves<br>to feel um that that is our sole way of<br>guarding our security I'll say it like<br>that I think there are other ways that<br>we can guard our security um so to give<br>you a sense of perhaps the conversations<br>that might continue to mature and um<br>grow over this period of time our<br>Maritime Space is really important for<br>us uh and therefore what we do in our<br>maritime space um becomes quite<br>important that w't H in head to your<br>comment now about in the future as we<br>gain more information would we ever<br>become a part of orcus right now it<br>doesn't serve our needs um there are po<br>two elements to the caucus Arrangements<br>that we still don't have full visibility<br>over but we're seeking out more<br>information what does it mean but what<br>we offer our region is an understanding<br>of our region and warfare is becoming<br>very different it's very much<br>intelligence leads technology it's<br>precise Urban Warfare will become more<br>of a reality than not whereas our<br>traditional Warfare approach has been<br>kind of in the big Open Fields and<br>things like that it'll be very very<br>precise um and those types of things<br>keep me up at night so C cyber and AI<br>actually the impact of cyber and AI on<br>our peace and security because it's it's<br>so it's moving so rapidly I think about<br>this and we went to watch a movie last<br>night the create the<br>Creator the mind boggles with II um but<br>it's that um that keeps me up at night<br>in a not so healthy way the thing that<br>keeps me samean and still optimistic<br>about this job is a common belief in<br>humanity it's a common belief in<br>humanity I think if we were to again<br>have a really open and honest<br>conversation across the table from from<br>uh to to figure out where we build<br>Bridges and ensure that our our<br>diplomatic dialogue remains open at must<br>for New Zealand we can't we don't have<br>the Privileges saying oh we're out of<br>here we have to maintain our diplomatic<br>channels they must always be<br>open fundamental faith in humanity and<br>the fact that we do not want war on a<br>global scale where we have to worry<br>about our existence in<br>livelihood and I just feel the flavor of<br>the of anger and the country um<br>presentations that were provided that<br>was an overwhelming theme of messages<br>coming through from every participant at<br>the UN and it was my privilege to be<br>able to offer our countries um statement<br>because it really Amplified to me um how<br>important the UN is one thing though New<br>Zealand has to hold fast to what we<br>always believed um around the um P5 R of<br>it has there's no it it should have no<br>value anymore if a P5 country can take<br>an action that is so contrary to the UN<br>chapter you know and my understanding is<br>that that is something when<br>Fraser Fraser sign signed up you know<br>that that that that the concept of a P5<br>I'd be happy to be educated on this but<br>my understanding was that at the time<br>the politics of the day was that it was<br>a<br>temporary kind of set of Arrangements<br>but it's certainly been eclipsed we<br>certainly don't need it anymore and and<br>interestingly enough when I attended the<br>security council meeting just in this<br>visit zinsky said if the if the security<br>Council was going to truly represent uh<br>All Nations large and small why would<br>you have a right of veto why would you<br>um and I think he left quite an<br>impression on many of those who were<br>listening um to really think about<br>accelerating reform of the don't accept<br>that it's a huge B that takes so long to<br>reform so I think taking a reformist<br>agenda to the UN will be important and<br>the next Secretary General should she be<br>so manifesting<br>here should should she be um able to uh<br>do that I I I certainly would be one<br>that would welcome her um um her energy<br>around that so I've perhaps not answered<br>nearly enough of the questions but he''s<br>got a flavor of how I'm thinking about<br>things<br>um part two um I would hope um and I<br>would say this labor has not held the<br>Foreign Affairs uh portfolio for a<br>number of years so this was been the<br>first time since F goth um and therefore<br>the muscle memory of international<br>relations and Foreign Affairs policy<br>just at a party<br>level while while it remains ambitious<br>the ability to give effect to a real uh<br>labor kind of um flavor to foreign<br>policy has not really been there so I<br>feel that I've you know made some un<br>raids but there's so much more to do and<br>I feel that our international relations<br>committee um that um have been working<br>hard to ensure that our Manifesto now<br>captures back some muscle memory and and<br>build some muscle memory in this space<br>is very Progressive and I I feel<br>you well uh I think I can say that that<br>was outstanding uh thank you very much I<br>think um well I got more than I<br>bargained for so thank you very much<br>that was a really really interesting<br>address I've got pages of notes to look<br>back on and and reflect on um so thank<br>you thank you very much for sharing with<br>us in such an honest and Frank way and<br>um making so many really important<br>points we don't have a lot of time left<br>with sort of run over by um five minutes<br>maybe we could do one or two questions<br>just one or two sort of quick questions<br>and then we'll have to wrap because the<br>time was supposed to finish at 1:30 and<br>I don't want someone kicking us out of<br>the room Al you know but um yeah we'll<br>yep so<br>good I believe it's really important to<br>indigen how it's possible to do well I I<br>mean part of the um uh value that I<br>bought um alongside building the<br>relationship with the Pacific is trying<br>to ingest a perspective that New<br>Zealand's foreign policy uh could<br>provide an indigenous lens that could<br>help uh address some issues all the<br>world around have been that have been<br>challenging colonization you know we can<br>have a conversation on the African Union<br>around colonization in a way that we're<br>not saying we got it all right and we<br>never should but we have had a journey<br>of trying to reconcile the impact of<br>colonization while building a nation<br>creating some institutions in some ways<br>forward that could look at Truth and<br>Reconciliation um and restoration and<br>cultural revitalization and economic<br>inclusion that could be really useful to<br>other countries so I've kind of very<br>much tried to provide it more of a<br>context and a road map rather than this<br>is how you do it kind of conversation<br>and when I think about you know Chile<br>and the lost um well the biggest<br>challenge year is Truth and<br>Reconciliation but the Lost opportunity<br>of economic participation of indigenous<br>peoples in their economy I think is kind<br>of where again we're in a really unique<br>space to try and offer some ways of<br>doing things there um but i i i<br>acknowledge that every country context<br>is very<br>different so I figured with sore hosting<br>Chum um next year I thought that that<br>without indigenizing it what we could do<br>is figure out if the Pacific had kind of<br>a common approach to expressing how de<br>democracy Works within the Pacific<br>context and strengthening um your<br>institutions to you know Express um<br>Democratic Norms with this Polynesian<br>what will this specific cultural context<br>um that would be a good thing and uh<br>that that in my mind could create<br>another kind of bridge for New Zealand<br>to come in and say and within that<br>context you know this is how indigenous<br>issues work but I you know it's it's<br>it's kind of a bit more organic in my<br>mind and it requires a lot of politics<br>and a lot of talking to kind of get<br>there but that's why I thought it's very<br>very useful for Sam to host Chum next<br>year because when um then P Prince<br>Charles but now King Charles presented<br>in um Rwanda and he gave the opening<br>address he said he accepts that in order<br>for the common wealth to be relevant and<br>I'm slightly paraphrasing in order for<br>the Commonwealth to be relevant it needs<br>to move through some of the most hurtful<br>aspects of its past like<br>slavery and then by extension<br>colonization kind of you know you look<br>across her and say that and I thought<br>for someone who was going to inherit the<br>monarchy to say that about the<br>Commonwealth I thought that was really<br>insightful because he recognizes the<br>Commonwealth is a growing institution<br>it's not diminishing in its membership<br>so therefore he I think gave a signal<br>and almost agency that we need to have<br>these conversations in a positive way so<br>I took a lot of Hope from those comments<br>and that's why I'm really kind of<br>looking forward to the um Pacific hosted<br>um Chum event I think that's going to be<br>quite exciting<br>actually that's great thank you do we<br>have one more question anybody Max my<br>fear is<br>that the greatest invion that is going<br>to come from the very teach and I have<br>known about<br>this7<br>FBI CIA teach M and physics and had a<br>PhD done all the study on woman my<br>science I think we steering the bar or<br>thousands of incredibly rich people<br>buing a shower in a temple coming here<br>localizing putting the families here<br>doing it and going back R businesses and<br>beh the population Fe so we can be<br>overrun from 5 million to 10<br>milon<br>overnight and treaty work princi and all<br>the rest will be swamp with these people<br>coming into semi totalitarian<br>institutions I believe when the pl where<br>year goes in the next five years and the<br>C comes up they're going to hit the<br>button so what's the planning for us to<br>avoid the inundation of the very rich<br>people coming into this<br>country we asking me about um<br>immigration policy and that this<br>is probably one of the challenging um<br>convers most challenging I've have<br>experienced as a member of Parliament<br>since I've gone into politics because<br>there there are big Divergent views<br>around um the role of immigration to to<br>accelerate and enhance your economic um<br>growth or to support um Economic<br>Opportunity elsewhere through La labor<br>migration into New Zealand for a period<br>of time in the light and then there's<br>our Refugee commitment our human you<br>know humanitarian commitments<br>so I I suspect we are going to have very<br>different flavors of conversation than<br>the immigration space that a climate<br>going to be climate<br>informed um and we're not there yet but<br>I feel we are close because these are<br>the kinds of conversations that have<br>been driven from within the Pacific for<br>example when you've got the real<br>Prospect of kittas to Valu you know and<br>sea level rise in displacement being a<br>very real Factor so that might be<br>counterbalance to some of the challenges<br>you're outlining in terms of um uh<br>immigrant immigration uh having a<br>negative impact on our own population so<br>I don't have an answer for you but we<br>are better served when we have that when<br>we have the fullness of a conversation I<br>should I should actually add one of the<br>things I've also done since being a um<br>uh Minister of Foreign Affairs is try to<br>cultivate within the ministry by the way<br>that they behave<br>but also by the way that I engage and<br>bring in my International um ministerial<br>colleagues is more and more foreign<br>policy requires social license and we<br>have to um figure out because we have to<br>explain why are we spending all this<br>money in Ukraine and not domestically<br>why are we uh not why are we um signing<br>up to these International treaties but<br>domestically there's no congruence and<br>things like that so what I've learned<br>and I have to to say this is why this is<br>part one not part two part two will be<br>much better because I've learned along<br>the way but what I've learned is that if<br>you can um bring bring the um the public<br>conversation and the social license into<br>the way and what you're undertaking um<br>uh policy um long term that's probably<br>going to put you in good stead because<br>we cannot have in the Foreign Affairs<br>space policy that looks and feels and<br>sounds good and upholds all our<br>International obligations but we are<br>getting more pressure domestically<br>around the Y so I think that's something<br>to work on for whoever has this role<br>next time<br>around okay on that note uh whoever has<br>this role in the next uh in the next<br>round I think is a really good place to<br>uh to end I personally hope that you<br>have uh this role in the next round and<br>and I think a lot of people in this room<br>feel the same way that we would like you<br>to have the second round as well to<br>finished the work you've started so yep<br>it's that time of the year um so without<br>turning this into an overly political<br>situation don't forget to vote and if<br>and if you make your decision vote early<br>and if you're not decided come talk to<br>me so on that note uh thank you very<br>much uh niia for coming and spending<br>your time with us I'm really grateful uh<br>that's um you know I've said it before<br>but I just want to say it again I know<br>you you added Us in at the end of a<br>really busy travel period and you could<br>be doing uh different things so thank<br>you for choosing us today and sharing<br>okay</p></main><footer style="margin-top: 2rem;
