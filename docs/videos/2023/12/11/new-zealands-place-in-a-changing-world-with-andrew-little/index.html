um good good afternoon everyone it's<br>a pleasure to be on this panel alongside<br>uh my esteemed colleagues my very very<br>short contribution to the discussion<br>today really send us on a report from an<br>independent Advisory Group that the<br>Minister of Foreign Affairs and trade<br>established and that comprised of Colin<br>keing Rosen Nunan DAV cuppy and myself<br>the report was to provide advice on<br>foreign policy tools that were available<br>and could respond to those grave<br>International situations of concern<br>including the advantages and<br>disadvantages of a future role for<br>autonomous sanctions recognizing that<br>sanctions are a tool of Last Resort uh<br>the group considered and advised on the<br>best possible toolkit of foreign policy<br>options and skills that could be<br>employed by artero New Zealand well well<br>Upstream from the point at which<br>sanction regime could be considered the<br>report was intended to be a very much a<br>forward-looking practical set of<br>recommendations about foreign policy<br>tools and how effective the<br>implementation the implementation could<br>be it included references or Reflections<br>drawn from T maldi and acknowledg and<br>acknowledge of course the relevance of<br>tiangi and the for foreign policy of Al<br>New Zealand the report recommend a a<br>proactive preventative approach uh to<br>situations of those very serious human<br>rights abuses um that occur<br>internationally with the development of<br>mediation and other dispute resolution<br>skills for situations of conflict when<br>they arise uh for me it was um<br>beneficial to have the integration of a<br>tar perspective and for use only as a<br>very last resort New carefully<br>constrained legislation establishing<br>generic Provisions for the<br>implementation of sanctions this uh<br>proposed draft legislation should cover<br>both sanctions approved by the UN<br>Security Council as well as other<br>categories of sanctions permissible<br>under international law my short<br>contribution to the the the panel was to<br>explore a TIA orar approach and ass<br>certain tikanga tools and whether these<br>new Tia tools could fit within a<br>proposed conceptual framework um so I<br>thought a couple of ways it could happen<br>first as a preventive preventative<br>approach with the application of<br>Concepts such as fanga to achieve and<br>maintain good relationships GL globally<br>regionally and the whole idea of being a<br>good partner so really leveraging off<br>those Tik concepts of reciprocity and<br>also respect to assist to guide that<br>process this application would seek to<br>strengthen existing situations and or<br>relationships and also underpin new<br>situations and<br>relationships it would also encourage<br>relationship building um and as such was<br>really a proactive approach that could<br>preempt any possible conflicts that may<br>arise uh my second idea um with respect<br>to a Tanga framework was when initial<br>was had escalated then that hutter or<br>that wrongdoing needed to be identified<br>and adanga appointed to initiate the<br>dialogue and this would happen either<br>bilaterally or or<br>multilaterally appropriate redress could<br>be considered to heal um achieve Harmony<br>this could in include perhaps an apology<br>a travel ban arms embargo and or perhaps<br>Financial sanctions<br>so this approach I considered uh was<br>Nimble and flexible enough to fine-tune<br>an appropriate redress collectively that<br>would be agreed to collectively to<br>overcome those previous problems that<br>had been identified with the the<br>unilateral approach application of<br>sanctions and uh this I consider to be a<br>more surgical um application of of<br>sanctions in conclusion uh we we drafted<br>suggested legislation which he actually<br>included in our report so my question<br>for the minister uh was whether this I<br>suppose where the report is going and um<br>where if anywhere the draft legislation<br>may end up y thank you I'd like to<br>introduce Professor Dr Alexander gespi<br>which everybody calls l<br>so the floor is yours L thanks thank you<br>Mara um thank you Minister for coming I<br>just want to begin by acknowledging your<br>work over the last few years because the<br>climate is changing not just the<br>physical climate but the political<br>climate and I just wanted to acknowledge<br>your your stewardship in that for our<br>country um I also wanted to start with<br>noting that there's been three Miracles<br>today the the first one a minister fell<br>out of the sky normally ministers only<br>fall out of the sky when it's field days<br>and and you see them walking around in<br>gum boots which are very UND dirty the<br>this the second Miracle you've got four<br>academics who actually speak with and<br>get to the point within five minutes<br>just quite you<br>your third Miracle is that you've<br>actually managed to fill a room on<br>campus on Friday<br>afternoon but I think you've also made a<br>strategic mistake if I'm honest because<br>we've had a lot of debates right now<br>about orcus and the threat of large<br>black submarines I think had you sold it<br>that we were going to buy some yellow<br>submarines New Zealand Public would be<br>much more open to<br>that there's two serious things I wish<br>to raise the the first one is this is<br>not a time for utopian thinking I think<br>for a long time our foreign policy was<br>focused upon idealistic goals about<br>complete disarmament of the world and<br>the we must always keep this as a<br>further goal in the longer term but<br>right now to my mind the biggest risk is<br>not a war designed rationally but a war<br>that happens accidentally and I think<br>the need for the International Community<br>for confidence building measures is<br>greater than ever and this would break<br>into forart it's about having hot lines<br>Not Just Between the the highest levels<br>of government but also the military it's<br>about making some clear rules which are<br>Universal around war games in terms of<br>scale location and observers it's about<br>the importance of notification of<br>missile tests because at the moment this<br>is a very ad hoc process and and<br>countries can get scared very<br>easily and finally with regards to<br>confidence building measures it's about<br>having better rules for the interactions<br>of our militaries when they shoulder<br>each other into common spaces B in the<br>air or B on the<br>ocean my second suggestion is<br>that at the moment New Zealand's foreign<br>policy is like a winter day in the it<br>can get very foggy and you can't see<br>where you're going whether you're going<br>to go left or whether you're going to go<br>right and you have you have produced you<br>have overseen two fantastic pieces of<br>work and it is clear that one that the<br>threats are changing in our world and<br>that that is obvious and that's good and<br>it's good that we acknowledge it and and<br>two that our military needs an UPG grade<br>that it's not fit for purpose for what<br>may be ahead but what we need what I<br>think we need now is a greater compus<br>point about what would we fight for<br>because this world as the United Nations<br>gridlocks as we see new power blocks<br>emerge as you see the rise of China the<br>anger of Russia the instability of North<br>Korea the unpredictable nature of<br>Pakistan and perhaps most scary of them<br>all the relate will of the American<br>election next year and all of this my my<br>question is now are we aners are we<br>orcus are we NATO are we neutral I know<br>we have a relationship with Australia<br>and that is I think very very important<br>but when I think about Australia I worry<br>that if War breaks out with Taiwan and<br>America goes to war over Taiwan<br>Australia would join America and we have<br>an obligation to defend Australia I<br>don't know where this ends but I do<br>think we need to consider what a greater<br>compass point looks like in<br>this my question to you Minister what<br>threat keeps you awake at<br>you well there's a lot of questions<br>coming for the minister today so I'm<br>really pleased that I don't have to<br>answer them um but I'm going to hand<br>over now to<br>much good afternoon everybody thanks uh<br>Mara I think for inviting me to this<br>forum um no and thank you to um to all<br>the other speakers I think I agree with<br>um Professor GIS I think very succinct<br>presentations um and very helpful and<br>very as du to questions so look I I had<br>a prepared piece to come here with so I<br>won't I've left those notes in my bag um<br>so I will address the questions but I<br>would just start by saying this that um<br>in terms of what the speakers have said<br>I agree entirely the world has<br>changed um I'm old enough to have grown<br>up in the kind of Latter half of the um<br>what we call the old Cold War and the<br>tensions between the us and what was<br>then the<br>USSR um I still vividly remember in my<br>last year at high school which the only<br>year I got any prizes but at the prize<br>giving one of the prizes I well I got<br>the award for something I was allowed to<br>choose what I got and I chose a book<br>which um was Jonathan Shell's book the<br>fate of the<br>youth um the guest speaker and presenter<br>at our prize giving was the then prime<br>minister Robert<br>maldon um who when I went up to get my<br>prize took one look at the cover and<br>sort of parump about why would I be<br>wanting to to read that sort of thing<br>but that was um that was the environment<br>I grew up in that was very in my<br>formative years so um I've always been<br>very conscious<br>of um those<br>uh inter inter Regional or International<br>conflicts that ultimately do bear upon<br>people's ordinary lives um and they do<br>matter um later and you know if I think<br>about the 1990s and the 2000s a period<br>described by a variety of world leaders<br>including our own as a benign strategic<br>environment and I think we all accepted<br>that<br>um uh which is not to say that there<br>weren't Dynamics being Unleashed in<br>around the world that had an impact<br>later on and they certainly did in 2001<br>and they did um later as<br>well um but I don't and I don't think<br>and I don't accept that today can be<br>described as a benign uh strategic<br>environment that we live in the reality<br>as the world has<br>changed I know there's a lot of<br>discussion uh coming up particularly<br>from uh Western countries about China<br>and the rise of China there is a lot of<br>good associated with what has happened<br>to China in the last 40 years it has L<br>lifted literally hundreds of millions of<br>its people out of poverty and that is a<br>good thing um it is a country that is<br>you know technologically competent and<br>competitive and can do a lot and can<br>contribute a lot it's a country that the<br>world world needs to be engaged in and<br>leading on things like climate change<br>and those Universal challenges that we<br>have so it's important that the world is<br>engaging with China on those things um<br>and as we do in as a small liberal<br>democracy at the bottom end of the world<br>we engage with a lot of<br>countries who have features about them<br>that we don't agree with and in some<br>cases we might find<br>abhorent I think New Zealand's<br>reputation on and in the world stage<br>less than uh diplomatic circles as one<br>of being an honest broker we take the<br>world as we as we find it we speak back<br>to the world as we see it um and that<br>gives us a cach a in forums and um uh<br>conferences around the world world that<br>that is probably disproportionate to our<br>size and relevance to the world and<br>that's something we should hold on to<br>um so that's I think who we are and<br>where we stand and the point of Leverage<br>limited as as I think as Ruben<br>acknowledged nevertheless we do have a<br>point of Leverage that is of some<br>value um the other point I would make is<br>that um when we think about the the<br>change in the<br>world although China has um grown<br>significantly in terms of its economic<br>power and its diplomatic power in its<br>place in the<br>world um it also chooses to conduct<br>itself in a way that is<br>antithetical to the conduct of good<br>international<br>relations<br>um we know of what happens within its<br>borders and the um human rights abuses<br>and those things we know that it's not a<br>democratic country and it proudly<br>um it doesn't conceal that it considers<br>it's a very important part of the way it<br>gets to run itself and it's common<br>defense to criticisms of itself is we're<br>a Sovereign Nation let us do what we<br>like and at one level liberal as liberal<br>people growing up in a liberal democracy<br>we respect others but actually<br>non-democratic and in some cases<br>anti-democratic organizations or<br>countries or institutions um are not<br>what we subscribe<br>to one of the things we know that um<br>China does is when it engages with<br>countries and we see this specifically<br>in the Pacific is that it typically does<br>so to the exclusion of established<br>International<br>institutions and so its engagement with<br>the Pacific is in spite of and sometimes<br>antithetical to the Pacific Islands form<br>it doesn't respect that form and it<br>doesn't respect um uh the collective<br>self-determining uh approach of the<br>Pacific island<br>for<br>um and we also know that the way it<br>conducts itself is it<br>engages in a not very transparent way<br>whether it's diaspora wherever it is is<br>and it happens in New Zealand it happens<br>in the islands it happens in other<br>countries of the world too and those are<br>ways of of Behaving that are not<br>consistent with our liberal Democratic<br>Values um and we have to acknowledge<br>that the next point I'd make is um you<br>know what why have why have we released<br>these documents recently why do we find<br>ourselves talking more about these sorts<br>of<br>things from the time I've been a<br>minister and um I've been responsible<br>for the intelligence agencies it has<br>always been my wish and hope and<br>supported<br>by um the first two directors uh of the<br>two organizations I dealt with um to be<br>more open about what those agencies do<br>and the issues they're dealing<br>with that was given further kind of<br>imperess um by the RO Commission of<br>inquiry into um the Moscow Tex and<br>Christ Church<br>where that you know 850 page report uh<br>and I read every page of it and I was I<br>was um interviewed and signed by them<br>they made the point that we actually as<br>a country need to be more open about<br>National Security challenges that we've<br>got that's the mark of uh political<br>maturity and and social and cultural<br>maturity that we can talk about these<br>things and we need to talk about these<br>things and and the government needs to<br>be able to talk about these things um<br>and so that was important and and the<br>the recent review of the legislation<br>covering those<br>agencies uh conducted by S Terrence<br>Arnold former Supreme Court Justice and<br>um maruku mahua uh made the same point<br>and so I'm very pleased that we I think<br>we are getting to a point now where<br>um because I think the government has a<br>responsibility to be more open about<br>National Security issues and challenges<br>and threats and um and we get this we<br>can get this stuff out um there's a<br>point I made in a speech I gave last<br>year which also championing the cause of<br>more<br>openness<br>is one of the strengths we have and it<br>may well be at risk as I think as um as<br>speakers have acknowledged is uh our<br>level of social cohesion so in a<br>country um where we are still the the<br>crown is still reconciling its appalling<br>Behavior to our indigenous<br>peoples um and we have welcomed so many<br>people from other parts of the world and<br>we have you know a significant um array<br>of of other ethnic<br>communities we enjoy a level of social<br>cohesion that many other countries would<br>achieve um but it will require efforts<br>to maintain it I ack knowledge that um<br>but one of the one of our stren one of<br>our best chances of ensuring our<br>national<br>security and um and our sense of<br>National Security is maintaining social<br>cohesion and we only do that when we<br>follow the traditional liberal<br>Democratic value of being open um and<br>transperent about what government does<br>including in the National Security space<br>um so that's kind of what we're getting<br>to um part of National Security is what<br>we do in<br>defense we have defense reviews<br>periodically we've had one recently um<br>and that's kind of we're now moving into<br>another phase on that so that's kind of<br>by way of laying out my kind of<br>Foundations I'll come to the questions<br>that have been<br>posed um so Val you asked about the um<br>autonomous sanctions or approach to<br>sanctions both autonomous and mandated<br>by the UN and um appreciate that um we<br>have and both governments I know uh<br>because when we're in opposition we had<br>the same discussion discussions have<br>struggled with um an autonomous<br>sanctions regime um because as a small<br>country if we have that ability we do<br>run the risk of<br>being um mused by bigger countries you<br>must do this you know in our border<br>interests so we've always been hesitant<br>about it and I think then we were<br>challenged with uh Russia's invasion of<br>Ukraine um and knowing what that<br>represented and the threat that that<br>posed we made the Judgment that actually<br>we do need and the security Council was<br>in capable doing anything because<br>Russia's right a<br>veto um that we had to be part of an<br>international movement to to do<br>something about it uh and<br>so we would never act<br>alone but we would act um if there is<br>sufficient community of interest and<br>consistent with our values and that's<br>what we ended up doing so we passed<br>special<br>legislation in relation to Russia but I<br>think um to answer your question about<br>where are the proposals at I think we<br>are po now um to have uh I think a more<br>robust discussion about the very<br>proposals that you put up and I wouldn't<br>be<br>surprised um if we don't develop a<br>political consensus fairly soon about an<br>autonomous sanctions regime and your<br>work will have been very helpful in that<br>respect so that's that's where I predict<br>that getting to<br>um coming to Ruben's question um just on<br>your analysis Ruben I acknowledge a<br>point about the kind of the US uh<br>security order and the kind of the<br>Chinese Russian security order I would<br>just make the point that I I think<br>things are a little more fluid than just<br>they're not they're not Stark groupings<br>if I look at um the work we are doing we<br>are you know we work with closely with a<br>number of Southeast Asian Nations<br>including India which is you know deeply<br>embedded in the the kind of or closer to<br>the the Russia not the certainly not<br>China but close to the Russia kind of<br>friendship sort of circle um but<br>nevertheless um is nervous about what is<br>happening terms of their representations<br>to us so and we work with you know the<br>um uh Malaysia and other those um<br>Southeast Asian countries because we've<br>longstanding we've had long-standing<br>interests in that that sort of um are<br>and likewise our relationship with China<br>is not onedimensional it's<br>multi-dimensional as you'd expect in the<br>in this um in this modern world but we<br>have to be alert to what are threats in<br>in any relationship that we have but to<br>your point about what you describe as a<br>distinction between kind of the urgency<br>um described in the current situation in<br>those recent documents and our decision<br>making on<br>investments the reality is um when it<br>comes to um defense Investments<br>particularly for the big kit if you call<br>it that way because the next big<br>decisions we have to make will be uh<br>about the Navy and our<br>Naval um equipment is first of all<br>getting even if we were to put in order<br>today we wouldn't expect delivery for<br>another you know three or four years so<br>but we do have some um very serious<br>assessments to make what what makes<br>sense for us to equip ourselves with and<br>to turn to lean's point um we recognize<br>have long recognized both through our<br>engagement with um Pacific Harland forum<br>and the likes of the bo declaration and<br>others the<br>the defining an existential national<br>security threat to our Pacific Arland<br>neighbors is climate change as you've<br>said so we have to think even with in<br>terms of our defense capabilities what<br>should we equip ourselves with to<br>support our Pacific island neighbors<br>because we are and will continue to be<br>called upon to assist we need to be able<br>to to assist them with preventive<br>measures um through the rest of our<br>Foreign Affairs and and aid program but<br>when uh weather events strike when other<br>disasters happen like volcanoes and<br>earthquakes um we are often the first to<br>be called upon and we need to be<br>equipped to<br>respond um so those the big decisions we<br>you know do we do we continue with nine<br>vessels of six different classes or do<br>we kind of rationalize do we need to be<br>bigger um do we need different<br>capability so those are the big<br>questions that we yet to answer that so<br>that's what happens there um I might add<br>as a general overarching theme too as a<br>as a country we<br>um we if it was just left if the only<br>thing we had to worry about was our own<br>territorial defense New Zealand could<br>not defend<br>ourselves um we don't expect our Pacific<br>island neighbors to be able to defend<br>themselves on their own our defense and<br>our national security is inherently tied<br>up in our relationships with others and<br>that's our contributions to others um<br>but also what we might expect of them in<br>return and so those relationships are<br>absolutely um critical and I think it is<br>why not just us but many countries in<br>our region are um openly and<br>uh<br>transparently explore Ing and<br>accentuating<br>relationships um that we all see um will<br>assist us um in the event that the<br>international situation<br>deteriorates and in in the event that um<br>there is conflict of whatever<br>nature um so that's um a range of<br>questions that we have to consider and<br>then um Professor g g to turn to your<br>question sorry Lan did I ask your your<br>principal question was um How concerned<br>am I about these Solomon Islands<br>security picked my my<br>my my concern is<br>um not about the Solomon Solomon Islands<br>as a sovereign state making its decision<br>of course it's going to do that and and<br>we continue to have a relationship with<br>Solomon Islands continues to turn to New<br>Zealand and Australia to assist with<br>their um security measur and they are<br>specifically asked us to contribute to<br>security around the Pacific games so you<br>know we will do that my concern about it<br>is um and with all due respect to the<br>Solomon Islands there is a political<br>culture there which is prone<br>to uh if one perfectly blunt corruption<br>and that is a um political environment<br>in which China is quite happy to engage<br>in and um<br>and I think<br>underpinning some of these new<br>international relationships formalized<br>in agreements um is some unhealthy<br>political conduct that we we wouldn't<br>tolerate in our country so that's that's<br>my concern is that the vulnerability is<br>being exploited and in the long run it's<br>not a healthy long-term<br>relationship to T Professor G's<br>questions um the ultimate questions are<br>I I don't want to say I'm kind of a Zen<br>type of guy but you know sometimes you<br>do just have to block out what you've<br>seen during the day and just in order to<br>get a good night sleep if I go to some<br>of the underpinning questions um you<br>know what would we fight for and the<br>reason the reason we are supporting<br>Ukraine um and it has more limited<br>support than many others when you go to<br>Europe and and I was there in April at<br>one of the um donor conferences there<br>there is no question that for most<br>European countries they regard<br>themselves<br>as on a war footing because they feel<br>very threatened by Russia's conduct for<br>us why did we engage in it because as a<br>small<br>country we we need the international<br>rules-based order to work and to protect<br>uh all countries including us and I know<br>China poses the question but not<br>entirely illegitimately well who order<br>is it because that's the question they<br>POS the answer they they give in reality<br>is we don't respect anything other than<br>our idea of the of order and it's not<br>about what's negotiated at a<br>multilateral level it's what they choose<br>to to interpret as that's their approach<br>to the UN convention on the law of the<br>sea it's the way we choose to interpret<br>so what would we fight for we fight for<br>a um and which was the product of World<br>War<br>II is a set of Institutions and<br>conventions that create order between<br>countries which is the best hope we've<br>got to prevent exploitation and<br>repression which were the big challenges<br>for the world um leading up to end<br>following World War II so that's in my<br>view what we should fight for we are a<br>country that Embraces democracy and um<br>liberal values um and they are under<br>threat they're under including under<br>threat from like-minded countries if<br>we're brutally brutally honest about<br>that um the other question was you are<br>we Anis are we oras are we NATO um we<br>are a combination of things and we<br>explore our International<br>relationships uh with all their<br>dimensions trade diplomatic um people to<br>people all the rest of it um in a way<br>that hopefully is consistent with our<br>values and ultimately gives us the best<br>chance of being able to protect<br>ourselves through those good quality<br>relationships what keeps me awake at<br>night um if I'm brutally honest I would<br>say it is that<br>um we don't allow a good robust<br>discussion to take place in this country<br>about the threats we face and about the<br>actions that we should take um to<br>address those because there's no there<br>won't be a single answer and there will<br>be multiple Dimensions to it um but we<br>do need to confront those issues and<br>comfortable as they may be um and we<br>need to arrive at something that we can<br>all live with so thank you again for all<br>being here this afternoon look forward<br>to our questions and discussion<br>great okay so thank you very much um<br>Andrew little for your um responses to<br>all those questions and I'll have to<br>make a brief confession before we go to<br>the Q&amp;A this is not how I sold it to<br>Andrew um I told him he was I told him<br>he was coming to Hamilton and he'd<br>probably be talking to a bunch of um<br>students um and instead he's got a huge<br>number of curly questions from for very<br>impressive academics so um yeah just a<br>public apology to Andrew and thank you<br>for pivoting so seamlessly into um a<br>very different response so thank you so<br>much for that so now we have about 15<br>minutes for questions um I just have<br>three uh requirements for these can you<br>please um raise your hand if you have a<br>question for anybody on the panel uh<br>could you please say who you are um you<br>can sit down or stand up uh but please<br>say who you are um who your question is<br>for and then what your question is and<br>if I could just politely ask um not for<br>any long opinionated pieces or Diet<br>tribes about um any kind of topic<br>because there's a lot of forums for that<br>you can write in the conversation or any<br>other Forum so please just keep your<br>questions to the point so just say who<br>you are who your question is for and<br>what your question is and priority will<br>be for students um because that was the<br>original pitch Andrew so if you're a<br>student and you've got a question um put<br>your hand up and we'll try to get to as<br>many as possible before 10 one so<br>anybody got a question not to put off<br>the academics because we're very<br>grateful to have you all here some of my<br>former colleagues from taringa thank you<br>so much for coming but does anybody have<br>a<br>question<br>you um leading domestic threat um I<br>would say is foreign interference and<br>foreign influence um I can tell you<br>because I said this to a journalist<br>recently and will be published in a<br>couple of weeks time is that probably<br>50%<br>of uh our intelligence agency's effort<br>goes into dealing with foreign<br>interference and foreign<br>influence um and then I'd say you know<br>secondly and Allied to that is uh<br>disinformation and<br>misinformation and the challenge for<br>that is um knowing where a line is drawn<br>where uh something should be done about<br>it um given New Zealand Bill of Rights<br>Act and our commitment to freedom of<br>speech and freedom of expression um was<br>characterized to me recently is drawing<br>the distinction between um lawful and<br>awful and uh lawful but off and stuff<br>that infringes on others rights that<br>justifies an intervention and and I<br>think uh political establishment is<br>is very good anybody does anybody have a<br>question any students or any academics<br>D<br>small question<br>um yeah thanks for that yeah look we<br>don't we don't have any plans to join<br>any U more kind of formal um<br>arrangements or or alliances we have<br>look we regard ourselves as having one<br>formal Ally and that's Australia um the<br>rest are Partners we have longstanding<br>um um relationships well I I think about<br>the five Power Defense Arrangement which<br>is US Australia UK Malaysia and<br>Singapore that's been a place for over<br>50 years very strong relationships um<br>for and that's a defense relationship we<br>have a more recent one um the friends uh<br>Arrangement which is France Australia<br>New Zealand which was more about<br>humanitarian assistance and disaster<br>relief um but we work closely with<br>France and obviously Australia and the<br>South Pacific and I do remind people<br>sometimes you get questioned about why<br>we belong to this part with that<br>partnership let's not<br>forget uh that since World War II even<br>before World War II uh New Zealand has<br>only been invaded or attacked um by<br>another sovereign state once since then<br>there was in 1985 and it was France when<br>they bombed the Rainbow Warrior that was<br>a state-backed um incursion on our<br>territory and it killed somebody and<br>harmed others<br>so um but we have a very healthy<br>relationship with France<br>today uh so I don't think we will but<br>the reality is um we will uh be part of<br>Partnerships as we are at the moment I<br>think the other thing I'd say is we<br>should you know we<br>should not think that we won't be called<br>on to help or assist um I think one of<br>the classic situations we face is if<br>conflict breaks out in the South China<br>SE we have a huge stake in there because<br>$20 billion of our trade goes through<br>there every year those trade routes are<br>closed down or restricted or limited we<br>have a direct interest in that so if we<br>if we are asked to provide some support<br>or means or some placing duties or what<br>have you um then we almost certainly<br>will have to agree to do so we do at the<br>moment so um we're part of a network of<br>many countries that place the sanctions<br>against North against North Korea we<br>we've done it in the past through um<br>aerial surveillance we almost certainly<br>will again in the future as well so um I<br>think it's important for our again for<br>our longer term National Security<br>interests that we play our part to<br>defend ours our interests and the<br>us<br>yeah I look I think that's that's part<br>of the kind of the ongoing thinking um<br>um but what I would say is what I would<br>say of China is<br>um<br>they they are they are engaged<br>extensively throughout the world because<br>they need to they can't feed their<br>people on their own they need the rest<br>of the world um to assist in there um<br>they they can't uh provide all the<br>technology they need on their own they<br>reli on other parts of the world for<br>that whether it's whether it's RAR Ro<br>minerals whether it's um<br>materials not withstanding their kind of<br>technologically advanced economy they<br>still have L on engagement with the rest<br>of the world I think the other<br>observation that is often made of China<br>is they learn<br>quickly so they want relationships with<br>the world they might wanted on you know<br>terms their terms that we might<br>initially find agreeable but but in the<br>end um they want relationships and when<br>things don't work they will find a way<br>to have<br>relationships and I think what my<br>observation again only is um the the<br>kind of um wolf Warrior mentality that<br>was behind the kind of sweep through the<br>um the Pacific last year trying to get a<br>whole bunch of Pacific island country to<br>sign up to the 10o sort of security plan<br>didn't<br>work won't mean they won't want those<br>relationships in the future but I think<br>they learned very quickly that that's<br>not the way to go about it I think the<br>big challenge for China will be um<br>whether or not they they can participate<br>in even Regional<br>multilateral uh<br>Arrangements um as well as the global<br>ones and that remains The Challenge and<br>potentially Remains the source of<br>conflict if they<br>don't<br>yep that's uh yeah I mean one of the um<br>one of the issues they're facing and as<br>other um militaries are around the world<br>at the moment there a loss of people a<br>loss of skills and talent um and we<br>still got a bit of work to do my first<br>call today was actually at the defense<br>um Recruiting office here just to check<br>out how it's going because they are<br>competing you know young people now have<br>a myri of choices um and uh we've got to<br>make um the the choice to know be part<br>of our nzdf an attractive one not just<br>in remuneration but in in activity and<br>stuff and and the world of um<br>Defense work is changing too so again<br>more technologically<br>oriented um so we uh we you know we've<br>uh taken the first step to significantly<br>increase remuneration particularly in<br>those areas where we were clearly We Off<br>the Mark I'm I'm not sure we've kind of<br>completed that task uh even at this<br>point um but the other is to make sure<br>we're clear about what the what the work<br>opportunities are what the skills are<br>that we can offer um people<br>um I was talking to the the now outgoing<br>defense secretary in the UK Ben Wallace<br>few months ago and he said the uh<br>British defense where their thinking is<br>at now is they don't ever expect to be<br>up to the compliment that they were at<br>you know three years ago four years ago<br>and so the challenge for them now is<br>with the compliment that they think they<br>think they can get to as to ensure that<br>the technology that they adopt means<br>they get to have the same effect that<br>they once did with that number of people<br>so it's there's a bit of a transfer from<br>Human effort to um technology<br>substitution for the same effect and I I<br>suspect will'll be will'll be um<br>too<br>y<br>this<br>yeah um that that is a a really good<br>question and I think that's the the<br>reason for much greater openness about a<br>national security strategy but also the<br>security threats capap that we released<br>um a week or so ago two weeks ago is um<br>is for the same reason so look we we get<br>it out there we talk about it um because<br>I know that there there are people who<br>feel threatened by that um but who are<br>reluctant to to come forward and be open<br>about it so that's I think part of the<br>role of government is to be open about<br>what we see what our what our<br>intelligence is and that's why we're<br>getting that out there um in terms of<br>you know when is enough enough um the<br>reality<br>is um we have we we will manage the<br>multi-dimensional relationship carefully<br>um we do have a significant trade<br>relationship I mean part of the part of<br>the work we've been doing in the last<br>couple three years is talking to um<br>exporters in New<br>Zealand uh about um diversification of<br>the markets they trade into and one of<br>the reasons we put a lot of effort into<br>growing the number of trade agreements<br>we've got is precisely that so those<br>opportunities of the year um some are<br>responsive to that other others<br>aren't um but we will continue to manage<br>that relationship um but when you know<br>when we see an action like you know<br>Russia against Ukraine that offends<br>against not just the values but our<br>strategic interests then you know we've<br>got to inconstant with others you know<br>um take a propriate<br>action I think um I mean one of the one<br>of the kind of conundrums that much of<br>the West is dealing with is you know<br>from the 1970s we all kind of signed up<br>to the one China policy it was a bit of<br>a kind of diplomatic fudge in order to<br>establish relations with China and it is<br>what gets repeated back to us now by<br>Beijing when we think about taiwan's<br>interests but um at at an objective<br>level we would s taiwwan it's a you know<br>it's a free and<br>Democratic country or economy to use the<br>China friendly language and um um it's<br>self-determining and we promote and<br>encourage and respect that and we would<br>want that to continue so um th those are<br>the values we hold but we will make<br>practical and pragmatic decisions of<br>that oh we've got okay I'll go over here<br>so<br>yeah look I think um like trying to will<br>um China will<br>say what it<br>wants an important part of the way we<br>conduct our relationship with China is<br>the engagement we have the person-to<br>person engagement at the political level<br>um the critical thing is you know not to<br>avoid anything being a surprise I think<br>we we work hard at that we can we<br>reasonably would you know I think we can<br>reasonably predict what responses are to<br>various actions there was a response to<br>the documents that we were<br>released um that's their right to react<br>in the way that they did um but it<br>wasn't outside kind of the realm's<br>possibility um you know they are a<br>country that in the last 20 years has<br>increased its spending on its military<br>tenfold um it is it will soon have I<br>think the largest Navy in the world um<br>so look it's it's it's um arranging its<br>hostr to meet its<br>needs um and if we are to use the<br>defense that often affords itself which<br>is we're a Sovereign Nation we'll make<br>decisions for ourselves we would say any<br>criticism from China we're a Sovereign<br>Nation we'll make decisions for<br>ourselves I should had I mean one of the<br>things we a part of the capity question<br>we've got is one of the things we<br>haven't done particularly well is<br>discharge our obligations in the<br>Southern Ocean so we have we've kind of<br>signed up to the rest of the world that<br>we would would um you know police it<br>against illegal unreported and um<br>unlawful fishing we just don't do much<br>of that so one of the capabilities we<br>have to think about amongst everything<br>else is the ability to operate in in the<br>Southern Ocean um to perform that role<br>and and we know adjacent to the Southern<br>Ocean is of course Antarctica and and<br>that is becoming a contested region too<br>so this is this is the reality of C<br>thank you all right Alberto you might<br>end up being the last one it's 112 where<br>you<br>goar yeah I think that's kind of one of<br>those things that<br>um people are struggling to enter the<br>the kind of the thought process to deal<br>with look we have we<br>have we all have to um but I don't I I<br>don't have any thoughts and neither have<br>I had any advice I might had um about<br>change and stance or posture as a result<br>of that I think we can predict that<br>there will be a under a second Trump<br>Administration a further Retreat from<br>International<br>if not International institutions<br>certainly International<br>obligations I think if you look at look<br>in our Indo Pacific region and you see<br>what the likes<br>of um Japan and South Korea and the<br>Philippines and that's some the bigger<br>Nations there and even countries like<br>Vietnam what they're doing um and uh<br>strengthening relationships with others<br>in the region um a lot of that is<br>to take account of the contingency that<br>the US won't be there at the level or in<br>the M or in the form that might have<br>been expected you know let's say 10<br>years<br>ago um the world is<br>preparing um and also hoping but not<br>necessarily for the same<br>things okay we're going to do very last<br>one um Mason over here last question<br>from from Mas<br>all<br>all<br>yes that's a great question um I um I<br>came to politics from the what used to<br>be known as the engineers Union um it's<br>had a number of names since but uh<br>anyway the union that represented folks<br>in the manufacturing and Fabrication<br>sector as well um and the heavy<br>engineering sector and um you you will<br>know that in the 1980s and Margaret<br>wlson will well recall the debates we<br>had when we were purchasing frigs um we<br>had the option of four we chose two<br>some components of the FRS including the<br>superstructure were fabricated in use Ze<br>them as part of an arrangement that we<br>had um but also some of the other uh um<br>technology and um facilities in those<br>frigs were manufactured here in New<br>Zealand think HVAC and some the radio<br>equipment and all the rest of it so um I<br>think one of the challenges for defense<br>procurement is to see what we can do um<br>for the benefit of new New Zealand<br>industry I think probably the lesson<br>we've learned<br>is um we look to trusted Partners so we<br>look to countries with established<br>defense Industries who can provide the<br>equipment that we've got it's<br>interesting I was when I was in Turkey<br>earlier in the year and they um they<br>made a big thing<br>about uh a big presentation to me about<br>the extent of their defense industry<br>what they make what they do and how good<br>it is and I I kind of believe me away I<br>don't realize how big a defense industry<br>that they had we and we Source our<br>defense kit from a variety of countries<br>but it is true we look to the US<br>Australia and the UK um for a lot of it<br>not exclusively but um it is a lot of<br>them because uh as you say um trusted<br>suppliers trusted Industries um but I<br>think there are scope for us through our<br>procurement Arrangements is to look for<br>um some New Zealand input and I know<br>that there's uh between New Zealand and<br>Australia Australia has a much larger in<br>more developed defense industry um some<br>discussion going on at the moment about<br>some partnering between those two<br>countries about um some work that could<br>happen here that probably benefit New<br>Zealand but contribute to our defense<br>material so that that is a question that<br>is um very much alive and future<br>procurement<br>oh no what am I going to do one one more<br>we do one more all right last last one<br>Woodhouse<br>um I'm not sure we're seen as the<br>weakest link um it is true many partners<br>say um like what you doing do a lot more<br>of<br>it um um but equally Ukraine is you know<br>as you will know through the<br>um uh the<br>Ukraine<br>um defense cooperation group heavily<br>relied on uh military technology from<br>other countries a lot of being donated<br>at the moment um they have they have<br>certainly developed some expertise in<br>drone technology which has been<br>incredibly useful for<br>yeah<br>yeah<br>yeah<br>yeah yeah I mean just on that I mean one<br>area where we are ahead of uh Australia<br>and indeed many other countries is in<br>space<br>technology um largely thanks to Rocket<br>lab but actually there are other<br>companies heavily um investing in<br>research and development<br>for uh technology operating you know in<br>the stratosphere and above ionosphere<br>and what have you um so we are well<br>ahead uh in many respects um that will<br>be and I know that in terms of um the<br>defense capability review which is the<br>next phase coming from those documents<br>that's near technology that will be<br>actively explored in terms of future<br>defense capability drawing on our own<br>here I wanted to ask you what our<br>trading special needs have had in regard<br>to the<br>23 yep<br>trading we able to come back with some<br>to that tring while were there yeah um<br>we always learn and those exercises are<br>important we we also have just recently<br>completed an exercise in Fiji we've got<br>Talisman sa we just completed and we've<br>got BMA coming up which is our annual<br>five P defense arrangement exercise um a<br>lot of that is about keeping skills<br>current um one of the problems with Co<br>both the um shut down at the borders but<br>also tying up many of our defense<br>personnel and providing security for our<br>miq facilities as they lost the<br>opportunity for that training they lost<br>the currency so um those training<br>exercises right now are contributing a<br>huge amount and I think what we find um<br>and I've had this from from senior<br>officers from other militaries is um we<br>we command huge respect for the<br>capabilities that we have they might not<br>be as extensive as you know the likes of<br>the US and and Australia but what we do<br>and what we commit ourselves to we are<br>regarded as um uh very well trained and<br>very well skilled and an example that<br>was given to me is<br>and uh somewhat small by comparison but<br>one of the big exercises they had in the<br>Pacific um last<br>year the us only wanted um their vessel<br>their Naval vessels to be refueled by<br>one refueling vessel and that was Alo<br>actually Alo because uh we turned up on<br>time we got the job done it was safe it<br>was trusted and we were out of there<br>make a Caren doing what what they do um<br>it it's not just refueling NAB ships the<br>exercise out of Australia telis saber<br>the feedback I got was the stuff that we<br>were tasked to do and committed to doing<br>we did incredibly well and got good<br>feedback for so um yeah we do well all<br>right on that note I am going to wind us<br>up because we've gone way over time and<br>I just want to um thank you very much<br>again Andrew for coming here I think<br>it's um a really fortunate thing that<br>we've got um this panel of speakers to<br>come to Hamilton on a Friday afternoon<br>and talk so I think we're all really um<br>that</p></main><footer style="margin-top: 2rem; background: #0001; padding: 2rem; text-align: center;"><p>We Are The University</p><ul
