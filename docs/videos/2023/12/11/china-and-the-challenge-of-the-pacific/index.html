acknowledge<br>the organizers of this event the ter<br>Binga faculty of law wero University and<br>the policy Institute of Kings College<br>London for their efforts to bring us<br>together indeed enhanced exchanges among<br>major Pacific island Partners players<br>and stakeholders are conducive to<br>building confidence and common<br>understanding expanding cooperation and<br>tackling common<br>challenges nowadays Pacific iseland<br>countries are working with an increasing<br>number of Partners to make their Pacific<br>voice heard on various<br>platforms as a result they're playing an<br>increasingly important role in<br>addressing climate change achieving<br>sustainable development and maintaining<br>peace and stability in this region and<br>beyond for this and other reasons the<br>Pacific region has received growing<br>interest and attention from the<br>International Community I would like to<br>take this opportunity to share with you<br>the state of China's long-standing<br>relations with the Pacific island<br>countries and our views on relevant<br>Pacific issues also look forward to<br>hearing your perspectives on this let me<br>first briefly touch on the history of<br>China's evolving relations with the<br>Pacific island countries China's<br>friendly interactions with the Pacific<br>island countries have a long history<br>which can be dated back to hundreds of<br>years ago 150 years ago a number of<br>Chinese people crossed the vast ocean to<br>reach the South Pacific Islands they<br>settled down worked hard and mingled<br>with the local community and lived in<br>harmony with them and they forged strong<br>cultural and peopl to- people bonds<br>across the Pacific in fact I've been<br>told during my visits because I'm<br>doubling also as ambassador to the Cook<br>Islands in Nei during my visits to these<br>Island countries have been told a number<br>of times by my Polynesian friends that<br>their ancestors may have come from<br>China our official relationship with the<br>Pacific island country is almost as old<br>as our relationship with Australia and<br>New Zealand starting in the 1970s<br>bringing China's relations with the<br>region onto a fast track in<br>1975 we established diplomatic relations<br>with Fiji and Sora and with papini in<br>1976 with vanatu in<br>1982 with Misha in 1989 just to name a<br>few so far we have established<br>diplomatic relations with 10 Pacific<br>island countries and set up resident<br>embassies in eight of<br>them in the following decades since<br>China's China and the Pacific island<br>countries have deepened relations on all<br>fronts in November 2014 president siin<br>ping paid a state visit to Fiji and held<br>a collective meeting with leaders of<br>pic's having diplomatic relations with<br>us when the two sides agree to establish<br>a strategic partnership featuring mutual<br>respect and common development in<br>November 2018 president C paid a state<br>visit to Pap new guine and had another<br>Collective meeting with leaders of the<br>10<br>pic's when China pic's relations were<br>elevated to a comprehensive strategic<br>Partnership of mutual and common<br>development these two visits helped open<br>a new chapter in all dimensional<br>cooperation between the two sides<br>in recent years China and pic's have<br>also jointly built the China pic's<br>foreign ministers meeting mechanism last<br>year State councelor and foreign<br>minister wangi was invited to visit<br>South Ireland South Pacific iseland<br>countries and chaired the second China<br>Pacific island countries foreign<br>ministers meeting where he announced<br>that China will continue to strength the<br>six cooperation platforms covering<br>emergency supplies climate<br>change poverty reduction disaster<br>prevention Agriculture and application<br>of Junes how technology all tailored to<br>the pic's needs Taking China pic's<br>practical cooperation to new<br>levels let me turn now to the objectives<br>and principles of China's relations with<br>the Pacific island countries to put it<br>simply the fundamental goal of China's<br>relations with the pic's is to achieve<br>common development both China and the<br>Pacific island countries are developing<br>countries in the asia-pacific region and<br>share similar historical experiences of<br>being victims to Invasion and<br>colonization we all give first priority<br>to economic and social development to<br>improve people's lives as the largest<br>developing country China emphas<br>emphasized deeply pic's Colonial past<br>and their aspirations for development<br>and has actively helped pic's within the<br>framework of South South cooperation to<br>address common challenges including<br>climate change poverty reduction and<br>sustainable<br>development while working with Pacific<br>island countries we have followed the<br>principles of sincerity practical<br>results Affinity good faith and pursuing<br>the greater good and share<br>interests the core of which is mutual<br>respect recently when meeting with prime<br>minister sagari of the Solomon Islands<br>president cining presented China's four<br>full respects policy towards Pacific<br>island countries First China fully<br>respects the sovereignty and<br>Independence of Pacific island countries<br>it has a longstanding and consistent<br>position that all countries big or small<br>rich or poor strong or weak are equal<br>China never bullies others or interferes<br>in the internal affairs of other<br>countries we always respect the<br>development paths independent ly chosen<br>by other countries including those by<br>the people of the Pacific iseland<br>countries and support their Sovereign<br>decision to conduct normal cooperation<br>with other<br>countries meanwhile we appreciated<br>deeply that the 10 pic's having<br>diplomatic relations with us always<br>adhere to the one China principle<br>understand and support our core<br>interests and major concerns on the<br>Taiwan question<br>second China fully respects the will of<br>the Pacific island countries we<br>understand the severe challenges they<br>face on addressing climate change<br>promoting development and improving<br>people's lives by planning together<br>working together and benefiting together<br>China seeks to promote pic's<br>infrastructure development and poverty<br>reduction so as to help them break the<br>development bottlenecks and enhance<br>their own development capacity including<br>achieving long-term financial and above<br>all economic viability and<br>sustainability third China fully<br>respects the culture and traditions of<br>Pacific island countries we never<br>consider the culture of any country to<br>be superior to those of others each and<br>every culture is unique and equal and<br>all are part and parcel of the World<br>Civilization Garden you follow the<br>principle of Harmony without unanimity<br>in interacting with Pacific island<br>countries and have drawn on and learned<br>from each other's cultures to flourish<br>and prosper<br>together fourth China fully respects<br>Pacific Islands countries to seek<br>strength through unity and supports them<br>in implementing the 2050 strategy for<br>the Blue Pacific continent in this<br>respect we have taken the initiative to<br>align the belon road Corporation and<br>various China pic corporations<br>mechanisms with the goals and objectives<br>as well as the priority areas of the<br>2050 strategy in order to support pic's<br>to build a peaceful harmonious secure<br>inclusive and prosperous Blue Pacific as<br>outlined in its 2050 strategy with the<br>Pacific<br>approach China is a St supporter of open<br>regionalism LED and owned by the Pacific<br>countries we respect the existing<br>cooperation mechanisms and Arrangements<br>in the region and value the dialogues<br>and exchanges with authori authoritative<br>Regional organizations such as the<br>Pacific Islands Forum our bilateral and<br>multilateral cooperation with Pacific<br>island countries is complimentary and<br>non-exclusive Visa these existing<br>Regional<br>mechanisms in 1989 China became one of<br>the first official dialogue partners of<br>the Forum since 1990 we have sent<br>governments representatives to attend 31<br>consecutive post forum dialogues and has<br>explored and carried out extensive<br>practical operation in the region China<br>has long supported the role and work of<br>the pi PF Secretariat and has<br>proactively provided assistance to the<br>Secretariat within our<br>capacity last year we donated over a<br>million dollars US dollars to the<br>Secretariat this came on top of past<br>donations of similar<br>amounts China also strongly supports the<br>PF leaders meeting and has provided<br>support to Forum<br>chairs in hosting Forum Summits and<br>related meetings including the immediate<br>past chair Fiji and the current chair<br>the Cook Islands we look forward to new<br>progress being made in the cup upcoming<br>Forum leaders meeting and Forum Partners<br>dialogue under the stewardship of the K<br>Islands this year now I would like to<br>highlight some examples of exchanges and<br>cooperation between China and<br>P China always honors our commitment and<br>puts money where where our mouth is more<br>importantly our efforts didn't start<br>yester year we have been doing it for<br>decades the two sides have conducted<br>frequent exchanges at different levels<br>and established multiple bilateral and<br>multilateral dialogue<br>mechanisms now the cooperation between<br>the two sides have expanded to more than<br>20 areas including trade investment<br>ocean Affairs Environmental Protection<br>climate change disaster preparedness<br>response and mitigation poverty<br>alleviation Health Care education<br>tourism culture Sports Etc China is an<br>important economic and trade partner of<br>pic's and the two-way trade has<br>continued to grow according to<br>statistics of the Chinese side from<br>19292 to<br>2021 total trade volume between China<br>and pic's have having diplomatic<br>relations with us registered an average<br>annual increase of 13% and expanded by<br>over 30 times in 30 years we have signed<br>Bel and Road Corporation M us with all<br>the 10 pic's having relations with us we<br>have enhanced economic and Technical<br>cooperation under the framework of South<br>South Corporation including implementing<br>nearly 500 Grant and concessional<br>funding technical assistance in kind<br>donation projects in pic's helping build<br>important infrastructure such as roads<br>Bridges wvs hospitals schools and sports<br>facilities and training about 10,000<br>Professionals in various<br>fields we take pic's special conditions<br>and concerns in relation to climate<br>change very seriously seriously and has<br>been committed to helping them<br>strengthen capacity and resilience since<br>19 since 2019 we have held four South<br>South cooporation training sessions for<br>pic's under the theme of tackling<br>climate change for green and low carbon<br>development and provided multiple<br>batches of<br>supplies in April 2022 the China pic's<br>climate change cooperation Center was<br>officially launched additionally we have<br>a attached great importance to<br>strengthening renewable energy<br>cooperation with pic's the photovoltaic<br>power plant project in Samoa built by a<br>Chinese company in 2010 was China's<br>first such cooperation project in the<br>region meanwhile China has been devoted<br>to promoting the full and effective<br>implementation of the Paris agreement so<br>as to help pic's strengthen climate<br>resilience in recent years we have<br>hosted multiple seminars for pic<br>officials focusing on Environmental<br>Protection and management water<br>pollution treatment and Water Resource<br>protection which aims to help pic's<br>improve Environmental Protection and<br>Marine Resource Management capability<br>and jointly crack down on iuu fishing<br>activities in 2017 we hosted the China<br>small island States ocean related<br>ministerial Roundtable with the theme of<br>blue economy and economical ecological<br>Islands in 2021 the first China pic's<br>Forum on fishery cooperation and<br>development was held in guango China<br>where the guango consensus was reached<br>to deepen relevant cooperation in 2023<br>the China pic Agriculture and Fisheries<br>ministers meeting was held in China all<br>of these are conducive to deepening<br>fishery cooporation between the two<br>sides and help pic's to achieve<br>sustainable<br>development after the outbreak of<br>covid-19 China moved quickly to share<br>information about epic epidemic<br>prevention and control diagnosis and<br>treatments with pic's public health<br>authorities and held more than 10<br>bilateral or multilateral public health<br>expert Meetings online with pic's having<br>diplomatic relations with us moreover in<br>order to render pic's our utmost<br>assistance in fighting the pandemic we<br>set up the China Pacific island<br>countries and<br>covid-19 cooporation fund established<br>the China Pacific island Count's reserve<br>for emergency supplies and provided<br>pic's with hundreds of thousands doses<br>of vaccines and over 10 ton over 100<br>tons of<br>supplies in short the cooperation<br>between China and pic's has proved to be<br>responsive to the needs of the pic's<br>bringing tangible and material benefits<br>to the peoples of the region setting a<br>fine example of winwing cooperation<br>among countries of different regions<br>sizes and<br>systems finally I would like to<br>elaborate a bit on one of the<br>fundamental beliefs underpinning our<br>foreign policy that winwing cooperation<br>is the ultimate solution to challenges<br>facing all of us according to the five<br>principles of peaceful coexistence China<br>has been consistently pursuing and<br>expanding Global Partnerships based on<br>equality openness and cooperation<br>and broadening the convergence of<br>interests with other countries either in<br>the South Pacific or other parts of the<br>world China's relationships never Target<br>any third party conversely nor should<br>they be subjected to interference by any<br>third party China respects the<br>connections that pic's have established<br>with other countries we have no interest<br>in engaging in geopolitical competition<br>with anyone nor do we support us in<br>competition to Define interstate<br>relations because by definition there'll<br>always be winners and<br>losers in a<br>competition in the value system of China<br>the relationship between countries<br>should never be a zero sum game but<br>rather be based on mutual respect<br>equality win-win cooperation openness<br>and inclusiveness so as to better<br>cooperate to address common challenges<br>and Achieve common development<br>China values International and Regional<br>peace and stability and has been working<br>unyieldingly to that end to better<br>respond to pic's wishes and needs we're<br>open to working with all interested<br>parties to take stock of what existing<br>trilateral or even multiart multilateral<br>cooperation has achieved to explore more<br>cooperation of such kind to the benefits<br>of all sides we're against coercing<br>countries into choosing sides against<br>forming exclusive and even divisive<br>military alliances targeting third<br>countries and provoking military<br>confrontation and against efforts at<br>militarization of the Pacific region let<br>alone bring nuclear weapons or nuclear<br>pollution into the Pacific region which<br>will undermine the regional environment<br>for development and threaten Regional<br>peace and<br>stability in recent years with a view to<br>addressing the global deficits in peace<br>development security and governance<br>China has successively put forward the<br>global development initiative the Global<br>Security initiative and the global<br>civilization initiative sharing Chinese<br>approach to solve Global challenges and<br>build a community with a shared future<br>of<br>mankind China is ready to work with all<br>parties inside and outside the Pacific<br>region to advance the implementation of<br>the three major Global initiatives so as<br>to better Safeguard peace and stability<br>and Achieve common development in the<br>Pacific and The Wider world to conclude<br>living in a world undergoing profound<br>and accelerating changes unseen in a<br>century we need to work together in<br>solidarity more than ever before when I<br>want to what I want to emphasize is that<br>no matter how the international<br>landscape changes the purpose of China<br>foreign policy to pursue world peace and<br>promote common development will never<br>change our sincerity and mutual respect<br>towards pic's will never change and our<br>determination to learn from each other<br>and Achieve common development will<br>never change China is always ready to<br>work with pic's and all other interested<br>Partners who genuinely care about pic's<br>development to enhance Mutual political<br>Trust expand practical cooperation and<br>deepen people to- people exchanges so as<br>to build a path of Peace cooperation<br>development and prosperity across the<br>Pacific thank you very much for your<br>patience thank you very much Ambassador<br>for those comments which are properly<br>recorded uh I will now call upon<br>Ambassador Tom udal ambassador of the<br>United States of America to New<br>Zealand thank you so much and let me<br>just say it's a pleasure to be on a<br>panel here with my friends from The<br>Diplomatic Corps the Chinese Ambassador<br>the EU uh Ambassador and also the right<br>honorable Jerry brownley I'd also like<br>to acknowledge the key organizers of<br>this program including Alexander<br>Gillespie sir Oliver Litwin and Sir Jim<br>mlay this month secretary blinkin<br>outlined the US Vision of the future at<br>John Hopkins school of advanced<br>International Studies our vision for the<br>future a world that is open free<br>prosperous and secure that vision is not<br>americaas alone but the enduring<br>aspiration of the people in every nation<br>on every continent a world where<br>individuals are free in their daily<br>lives and can shape their own Futures<br>their communities and their countries a<br>world where every nation can choose its<br>own path and its own Partners a world<br>where Goods ideas and individuals can<br>flow freely and lawfully across land sea<br>sky and cyberspace where technology is<br>used to empower people not to divide<br>surveil and repress them a world where<br>the global economy is defined by Fair<br>competition openness transparency and<br>where Prosperity is not measured only in<br>how much country's economies grow but<br>how many people share in that growth a<br>world that generates a race to the top<br>in labor and environmental standards in<br>health education infrastructure<br>technology security and opportunity a<br>world where international law and the<br>core principles of the UN Charter are<br>upheld and where Universal human rights<br>are respected it is our belief that much<br>of the history of the 21st century will<br>be written in this vitally important<br>region developments in one corner of<br>this vast region can have dramatic<br>effects<br>Elsewhere on a more granular level our<br>goal is to build the collective capacity<br>of likeminded allies partners and<br>friends so as to advance shared<br>priorities and bolster are the<br>rules-based regional order from which we<br>all have benefited and in the Pacific we<br>must ensure that this is a race to the<br>top as in the United States and my home<br>state of New Mexico people throughout<br>this region want to ensure their<br>families are cared for and can fulfill<br>their goals and potential we can only do<br>this by working together to uphold and<br>improve the rule rules-based<br>International System that has been<br>fundamental to Regional security and<br>stability the international rules space<br>system has pulled so many out of poverty<br>and created the Innovative world we live<br>in today but for some people but we know<br>some people have been left behind and we<br>must strive to lift everyone up we must<br>work together to revitalize and improve<br>our Global institutions we're determined<br>to work with any country including those<br>with whom we disagree on important<br>issues so long as they want to deliver<br>for their citizens contribute to solving<br>shared challenges and uphold the<br>international Norms that we build<br>together under secretary yellen's<br>leadership we're making a major push to<br>revitalize and reform the multilateral<br>development Banks we want to ensure they<br>can meet the pressing needs of low and<br>middle inome countries who are facing a<br>perfect storm of challenges the growing<br>impact of climate crisis economic<br>Fallout from Co inflation and crushing<br>debt we are working through the<br>indopacific<br>economic framework to build resilient<br>Supply chains improve trade flows combat<br>corruption and promote clean energy<br>decarbonization and<br>infrastructure but our polic policies<br>and actions are not carried out in a<br>vacuum our leaders are equally committed<br>to engaging and listening to the<br>challenges and solutions of others<br>especially here in the Pacific the<br>Pacific is a dynamic region full of<br>diversity people thoughts and approaches<br>full of solutions and people tackling<br>the most pressing Global daily issues we<br>will continue to open embassies across<br>the region to ensure our leadership in<br>Washington has direct line to these<br>ideas and solutions as part of listening<br>engaging and Consulting with our Pacific<br>friends this month we established<br>diplomatic relations with Cook Islands<br>and Nei and President Biden hosted<br>Pacific island leaders at the second us<br>piff Summit we are also aligning our<br>efforts and strategies to help the<br>Pacific region achieve its specified<br>objectives as outlin Ed in the piff's<br>2050 strategy for the Blue Pacific<br>continent we support Pacific regionalism<br>with a strong Pacific Islands Forum at<br>its Center and through the partners in<br>the Blue Pacific initiative we are<br>working to coordinate Partnerships in<br>the region this initiative has already<br>engendered several lines of effort for<br>example Pacific humanitarian warehousing<br>to preposition human Arian and emergency<br>supplies as agreed by piff ministers at<br>the inaugural Pacific disaster risk<br>reduction ministers meeting held in NY<br>an annual Pacific cyber capacity<br>conference further support to the<br>Pacific climate change center in Samoa<br>support to access climate finance and we<br>look to the future we are committed to<br>engaging a wide range of Partners in<br>including the Pacific region to forge an<br>international consensus that can harness<br>the potential of emerging Technologies<br>like AI while minimizing<br>risk I would also like to take this<br>opportunity to dispel some<br>misinformation we're not trying to<br>contain China we do not seek a new cold<br>war with China we're not asking Partners<br>to choose between ourselves and China<br>and most certainly we do not seek<br>conflict with China when we talk about<br>competition that does not mean conflict<br>when we talk about competition we're<br>talking about putting forth our vision<br>for the future which upholds democratic<br>values and the rules-based International<br>System from a US perspective competition<br>with China wasn't inevitable we tried to<br>be positive with the PRC we embrace them<br>and welcome them into the International<br>System however when any country<br>including China challenges aspects of an<br>internationally established system that<br>has brought stability and economic<br>growth across the globe we will call<br>them out and present our views in a<br>peaceful and transparent manner as such<br>President Biden has been clear about our<br>strategy which remains to invest align<br>and compete<br>we are investing in the foundations of<br>our strength at home aligning with<br>partners and allies on our approach<br>abroad and harnessing two key assets to<br>compete with the PRC to defend our<br>interest and build our vision for the<br>future we believe working with a network<br>of allies and partners allow us to<br>manage our competition with China from a<br>position of strength speaking clearly<br>credibly and with a chorus of friends<br>about our concerns open lines of<br>communications also help reduce risks of<br>miscalculations which our leaders are<br>committed to maintaining we want an<br>international environment that makes it<br>possible for all countries including the<br>United States and China to coexist and<br>cooperate without fear of coer<br>fundamentally the United States and our<br>partners share and represent very<br>different values to that of China we<br>represent the rules-based order that<br>ensures a free and open indopacific it's<br>these values that we will continue to<br>compete on History has shown that free<br>societies working together are a<br>formidable Force as the world faces new<br>challenges we believe the only solution<br>is to deepen cooperation and listen to<br>Partners while at the same time<br>presenting our views of the future in a<br>full and transparent manner thank you<br>very<br>much Ambassador thank you very much for<br>those comments which have been duly<br>recorded and we'll course appear on the<br>website it's now my pleasure to invite<br>Ambassador n Nina obam the European<br>Union ambassador to New Zealand to speak<br>Ambassador OB thank you very<br>much<br>discussion excellencies colleagues<br>discussion it's a pleasure to be here<br>even if this takes place only<br>virtually<br>looking at the question we've all been<br>asked to answer as a non-native speaker<br>of English I was wondering about its<br>intended Direction the challenge of the<br>Pacific should I be outlining the<br>challenge of the Pacific from an EU<br>point of view as the challenge faced by<br>the Pacific or the challenge issued by<br>the Pacific to the European Union and<br>other<br>partners I decided I will try to do both<br>as to the challenge faced by the Pacific<br>it is difficult to address this in<br>singular form starting with the most<br>exential of challenges climate change to<br>biodiversity to resilience to external<br>economic shocks to shifting geopolitical<br>balances and my colleagues have spoken<br>to all of these um issues already if the<br>current increase in attention to the<br>region and the proliferation of high<br>level visits and meetings has<br>demonstrated one thing it is that the<br>Pacific island countries have agency<br>agency that they use that they make use<br>of both in a bilateral and in a regional<br>context I would argue that the challenge<br>issued by the Pacific is that this<br>agency be<br>acknowledged both in words and in action<br>I would also so argue that the EU has<br>acknowledged and valued this Agency for<br>a long time in its partnership with the<br>Pacific region and as a development<br>decades in our development work the EU<br>is led by the priorities of the<br>countries<br>themselves and um uh my my colleague<br>Ambassador Tom Udall has speaking has<br>speaking has been speaking power Yul<br>about the agency and the um objectives<br>in the region and uh both my colleagues<br>so both um uh my colleague the Chinese<br>Ambassador and the US ambassador have<br>spoken about the 2050 strategy for the<br>Blue Pacific continent that we all<br>acknowledge as a guiding document for<br>our partnership and cooperation with uh<br>the Pacific the strategy that was<br>endorsed by Pacific Islands Forum<br>leaders at their meeting in July<br>2022 and<br>um which identifies as priorities<br>Economic Development climate change<br>oceans and environment people technology<br>and connectivity as well as peace and<br>security the European Union's commitment<br>for development assistance for the<br>Pacific region since 2050 and running up<br>to 2027 amounts to more than 2.5 billion<br>New Zealand Dollars it focuses on three<br>key priorities the first being climate<br>action and environmental<br>sustainability the second inclusive and<br>sustainable Economic Development and the<br>third fundamental values human<br>development peace and security and you<br>will recognize in this in our<br>development cooperation priorities the<br>overlap with the 2050 strategy for the<br>Blue Pacific continent as it should<br>be in response to the most faing an<br>existential threat of climate change the<br>European Union has since<br>2019 made the European green deal its<br>Flagship<br>policy it has the objective of making of<br>Europe the first climate neutral<br>continent by<br>2050 and has set ambitious interim<br>targets for<br>2030 but we don't stop at having this<br>level of ambition for the European Union<br>we also acknowledge that we've got a<br>responsibility outside of the eu's<br>borders which is why the EU is the<br>world's largest donor of climate finance<br>and supports developing countries in the<br>development and implementation of<br>national adaptation strategies and plans<br>they held a successful event on climate<br>adaptation and loss and damage in July<br>2022 followed by a climate security<br>event in the Pacific region in early<br>2023 the European Union the European<br>Investment Bank and its member states<br>are also the largest donors to the green<br>climate fund contributing roughly 45% or<br>4.5 billion US dollar dollars to the<br>fund of which um the nine nine Pacific<br>island countries have uh benefited by<br>having project approved for funding<br>under the fund for toal total of more<br>than $600 million this includes grants<br>and co-financing with actions ranging<br>from Urban water supply and waste Mor<br>management to Coastal adaptation in<br>tuvalu to integrated flood Management in<br>Samoa to the Pacific Islands renewable<br>energy investment<br>program projects that have a tangible<br>and direct impact on improving people's<br>lives and on improving resilience to the<br>challenges and threats uh posed by<br>climate change under the European<br>Union's global gateway initiative the<br>flagship Pro projects in the Pacific are<br>a hydroelectric power plant in Fiji and<br>a feasibility study for a port in<br>kiribas this activity on the ground in<br>cooperation with the Pacific island<br>countries has been matched by the<br>European Union Support also in the<br>context of the UN and the UN General<br>assembly a resolution was passed with<br>the strong support of the EU initiated<br>by Vanuatu to secure the request for the<br>international Court of justices advisory<br>opinion on climate<br>change we believe that it is crucial to<br>ascertain what the harm caused by<br>climate change has meant for both<br>current and future Generations as well<br>of as for those countries that by virtue<br>of their geographical circumstances<br>level of development are injured or<br>specially affected by or are<br>particularly vulnerable to the adverse<br>effects of climate<br>change this with the objective and the<br>intention to encourage a maximum level<br>of convergence between the measures<br>governments have outlined in their<br>National Equity termin contributions<br>under the Paris agreement and the actual<br>cuts to greenhouse gas emissions that<br>are<br>required this resolution comes of course<br>also at a pivotal moment in view of the<br>UN framework convention on climate<br>changes 28 Conference of the parties so<br>cop 28 this November with the first<br>Global stock take under the Paris<br>agreement as the main event the EU in<br>the interest also of the Pacific uh<br>Island countries but first of all and<br>and Above All In global interest intends<br>to use this process to encour encourage<br>a progressive inter ration and full<br>implementation of the Paris<br>agreement UN General Assembly week is<br>still ongoing as we speak and the<br>sustainable development goals Summit has<br>put development on top of this year's<br>agenda Pacific countries might be<br>concerned that the eu's resolve on<br>supporting Ukraine in the face of the<br>illegal and unprovoked aggression by<br>Russia could diminish our engagement<br>with partner countries to address their<br>development<br>challenges let me reassure you that<br>these concerns are<br>unfounded throughout the war the EU has<br>not only maintained its development<br>cooperation and humanitarian assistance<br>it has provided additional contributions<br>to improving Global Food Security in the<br>form of humanitarian assistance by<br>helping to get grain out of Ukraine by<br>supporting vulnerable populations and by<br>stepping up our own food<br>production and we know that Pacific<br>island countries are also concerned<br>about the threat to the rules-based<br>international order the illegal Russian<br>invasion of Ukraine poses they have<br>demonstrated this powerfully by showing<br>solidarity with Ukraine in the face of<br>Russian aggression and inv voting to<br>condemn Russian actions in subsequent<br>Anga<br>resolutions as I spoke about how as a<br>development partner the EU has been<br>present in the Pacific for a long<br>time the EU is also intensifying its<br>political relationship with the region<br>in November so in a couple of weeks from<br>now we expect signature of the Samoa<br>agreement which will deepen our<br>political exchanges and which will bring<br>with it a high level visit from Brussels<br>to the region underpinning our uh long<br>lasting uh cooperation with this<br>agreement that for the first time will<br>be signed in the<br>Pacific this comes on top of already<br>existing significant political<br>engagement with the Pacific island<br>countries through regular bilateral<br>political dialogues at senior official<br>level and of course as a dialogue<br>partner of the Pacific Islands Forum the<br>Region's main political<br>organization as well as the first and so<br>far only permanent Observer of the<br>Pacific Community the main Technical and<br>scientific Regional organization of the<br>Pacific much has been said already on<br>the geopolitical situation in The Wider<br>region on this we've set out two years<br>ago a strategy on cooperation in the<br>Indo Pacific the EU strategy on<br>cooperation with the Pacific and the<br>title of this strategy says it very<br>clearly our emphasis<br>is on cooperation and we take an<br>inclusive approach the Pacific does not<br>have to become a theater of increasing<br>geopolitical tension our aim should be<br>to respect the sovereignty and<br>sustainable development needs of all<br>with the EU as a reliable<br>partner the European Union's relations<br>with the indopacific region are based on<br>strong historical cultural and<br>Commercial ties and Decades of<br>significant cooperation and<br>assistance in this context the EU will<br>deepen its engagement and reinforce its<br>role as a reliable partner bringing<br>added value to a long-standing relation<br>with all its Partners in the region this<br>includes like-minded Partners such as<br>the United States Australia Japan Korea<br>but of course also New Zealand it also<br>includes pursuing our multifaceted<br>engagement with China which which we<br>consider as uh an economic<br>competitor a systemic rival and a<br>negotiating partner with closely aligned<br>objectives and area of common interest<br>with whom we can engage bilaterally to<br>promote solutions to Common challenges<br>cooperating on issues of common interest<br>and encouraging China to play its part<br>in a peaceful and thriving indopacific<br>region to conclude<br>the European Union will continue and<br>intensify its presence and engagement in<br>the Pacific building on its work as a<br>trusted development partner and as a<br>partner in political dialogue the<br>challenges faced by the Pacific are<br>Global challenges and require<br>cooperation not confrontation in line<br>with our indopacific strategy we will<br>deepen our engagement with Partners in<br>the indo-pacific to respond to the<br>emerging emerging dynamics that are<br>effec ing Regional stability our<br>approach is designed to foster a<br>rules-based international order a Level<br>Playing Field as well as an open and<br>fair environment for trade and<br>investment tackling climate change and<br>supporting<br>connectivity k thank you very much<br>Ambassador OBM for that contribution<br>which again will be placed on the<br>website um I was to have called High<br>Commissioner toia fur the independent<br>state of samar's High Commissioner to<br>New Zealand as the next speaker but uh<br>unfortunately at the last minute the<br>Simone High commission has had to<br>withdraw from the discussion Ambassador<br>tfar has asked me to convey his<br>apologies to all other participants so I<br>now call upon the honorable Jer brownley<br>MP member of the New Zealand Parliament<br>Affairs well thank you sir Jim can I<br>acknowledge you and your work and uh<br>working alongside W University and<br>others to bring this seminar together I<br>acknowledge my<br>co-contributors uh the ambassadors from<br>China uh United States and uh the EU and<br>uh to all of those who might be going to<br>speak afterwards as<br>well<br>uh the title of today's seminar China<br>and the challenge of the Pacific it's<br>part of a series of seminar project for<br>peaceful competition is I think very<br>timely and of great interest to New<br>Zealand uh New Zealand I might point out<br>is the home of uh the Pacific's largest<br>uh concentrated population of Pacific<br>Islanders or the their diaspora uh in<br>the city of Oakland and we have as a<br>country benefited enormously uh from the<br>uh Workforce that has come to New<br>Zealand from the Pacific Islands and<br>there there is a two-way aspect to that<br>uh that makes our relationship as a<br>country to the many countries uh in our<br>view quite special and I see the<br>challenges for Pacific governments uh is<br>three things economic independence<br>climate change of course and then<br>Quality Social Services you could add<br>many things under each of those uh<br>various titles uh but Pacific island<br>leaders essentially want for their<br>people uh what we all want uh for people<br>who live in free societies Prosperity<br>good health and education Law and Order<br>good housing and full employment<br>relatively simple things uh when<br>considered in the the heady world of of<br>diplomacy underlying the renewed<br>interest in the Pacific uh is part of<br>the reshape of the geopolitical<br>landscape across the world and how we<br>react to this and how it plays out in<br>the Pacific is our<br>challenge the question then becomes how<br>do we capture the current significant<br>interest in the Pacific to strengthen uh<br>responses to challenges faced by Pacific<br>governments the current perceived or<br>speculated tensions or real in some<br>people's minds uh between the US and<br>China for dominance in the Pacific uh<br>serves uh if it serves any purpose then<br>I hope uh it will be to heighten the<br>awareness of how difficult life can be<br>on many of the Pacific<br>island I prefer to see uh what might be<br>called tensions at this point as more of<br>a cultural economic and environmental<br>challenge rather than potential grounds<br>for conflict<br>so not withstanding uh the history of<br>various uh Warfare actions in World War<br>II uh I'm not one who lives in fear of<br>either militarization of the Pacific or<br>potentially devastating consequences<br>from any full-on conflict uh between the<br>US and China that might be played out in<br>the<br>Pacific that doesn't mean we shouldn't<br>be vigilant and aware of the shifts in<br>the world's<br>geopolitics that shift is seen in the<br>decline under the United Nations<br>Authority uh the expansion of the bricks<br>countries uh the failure of the G7 to<br>condemn Russia for its illegal invasion<br>of uh the Ukraine and even in the uh<br>current diplomatic standoff between<br>India<br>China the Pacific is not isolated from<br>these changes uh so it does require an<br>understanding of how the geopolitical<br>shifts and repositioning that will bring<br>could affect the Pacific I note that<br>this conference takes place as s Jim<br>mentioned earlier as Pacific leaders are<br>having a second meeting in Washington<br>with President Biden and the US<br>Administration similar Gatherings have<br>occurred in Beijing and China has<br>facilitated other meetings inside the<br>Pacific these meetings follow the offers<br>uh made two Pacific governments<br>essentially uh by China and then counted<br>by the United States<br>some of the multiple initiatives on<br>offer from China have caused concern<br>from outside the Pacific most<br>particularly policing and other security<br>matters but perhaps the most attractive<br>offer from China is the thousands of<br>educational opportunities it's willing<br>to provide Pacific Nations will find it<br>very hard to decline those while each of<br>the irland Nations has its own strong<br>culture these cultures are significantly<br>augmented<br>by Western democratic values and<br>structures education on a large scale in<br>a different culture May over time change<br>things I've heard it said that after<br>infrastructure Aid projects have been<br>installed in the Pacific they often<br>follow three p phases first it gets<br>built then it breaks down and there's<br>limited repair and finally there<br>abandonment and replacement this is<br>because the skills in many Island<br>countries will the skill base is too<br>small to maintain some Modern<br>infrastructure education from trades and<br>technicians through to Advanced degrees<br>is very attractive to Ireland<br>governments but so too is the retention<br>of those skilled individuals in their<br>home countries provision of Greater<br>educational opportunities and rewards in<br>the home countries is a challenge we<br>should be giving serious<br>thought the rules based system as<br>mentioned uh by the previous speakers<br>has served the Free World very well<br>since the second world war and many<br>other countries now willingly Embrace<br>those Concepts and have joined<br>organizations that give life to those<br>rules the greatest threat to those rules<br>and the rules based system could be the<br>consequence of Russia's illegal invasion<br>of the Ukraine the action alone is clear<br>as a breach of understanding and what's<br>been the norm for recognizing<br>territorial boundaries<br>consequential multiple sanctions and<br>financial isolation brought down by<br>countries opposed to Russia's invasion<br>is having an effect on almost all<br>economies in various ways it's also seen<br>Russia seeking support uh in both arms<br>and money from a number of African<br>countries where stability is fragile and<br>the rule of law limiting however the<br>rules-based system I think is still<br>worth preserving and worth developing<br>further<br>those rules can be of great value to the<br>Pacific they are small economies uh that<br>need to develop away from their current<br>heavy dependence on remittances and<br>foreign aid this is no small challenge<br>it's the rules based system that could<br>offer opportunities for new technologies<br>to enable greater enhancing of Pacific<br>resources for Pacific Nations a good<br>example of this uh is the annual losses<br>from unregulated unreport reported<br>illegal fishing in the Pacific uh a cost<br>seemed to be seem to be CL close to a<br>billion useand dollars a year and that<br>sum is a multiple of many of the<br>Island's current individual debt<br>commitments uh it's Nations if Nations<br>uh who expressed concern about debt debt<br>traps and other Financial in tlements<br>were to assist in the capture of that<br>loss uh then some of the concerns about<br>gness in the Pacific uh might fall to<br>one side debt is always a problem for<br>small countries and it always leads to<br>uh consequences for those countries uh<br>that others may not wish to see happen I<br>make the point uh that recently much has<br>been made of tonga's national debt uh<br>post their Cyclone they needed to access<br>significant Capital uh to rebuild what<br>was a fairly much devastated country and<br>yes they've taken loans from China uh<br>they've done that over a period of years<br>and some of those loans are called for<br>repayment in the next 12<br>months the Quantum of debt from all<br>sources is not in my opinion a huge<br>problem it's a significant proportion of<br>toen GDP around about $200 million us<br>and that is a big challenge for Tonga<br>but considering building any<br>infrastructure in New Zealand generally<br>starts in the billions it would seem a<br>manageable amount the huge amount of Aid<br>money available in the Pacific from the<br>many donor countries maybe in part<br>better deployed in debt relief freeing<br>funding for irland government's other<br>priorities remember that uh<br>infrastructure uh has been the reason<br>for most of the uh debts being incurred<br>and that infrastructure is largely built<br>at the choice of the Pacific island<br>governments because they can see that<br>need so Hand ringing about China filling<br>a vacuum when other sources of funding<br>were not on offer I think is pointless<br>particularly when the money May well be<br>available to compete or be currently<br>held in various countries Aid budgets<br>perhaps it's time for a Pacific<br>Development Bank uh that could assist in<br>this particular way I Appo the concept<br>of peaceful competition as mentioned at<br>the start of the seminar uh can I say<br>the trade with China has with the rest<br>of the world uh reached a level of some<br>$7 trillion an enormous sum it's led to<br>143 countries having China as their<br>major trading partner it means that the<br>interaction with China by so many<br>nations is now critical to the success<br>of their<br>economies one of the questions that has<br>raised about China and the challenge in<br>the Pacific is the issue of trust trust<br>between nations is important trust<br>between those who subscribe to the rules<br>based system is absolutely essential and<br>I think it's too easy to rely on<br>speculation that it's a lack of trust<br>that is causing uh The Angst about China<br>it's worth noting that the $7 trillion<br>two-way trade while facilitated by<br>government to government trade<br>agreements is not directly conducted by<br>governments but by individual Traders<br>both in China and throughout the world<br>that trade is substantially conducted on<br>the basis of trust so there's a very<br>clear People to People level of trust<br>that I think should be recognized in<br>considering any positioning of what the<br>current interests uh that China or the<br>US have in the<br>Pacific looking specifically at the<br>Pacific Islands uh Forum uh sorry could<br>I say looking uh specifically at the<br>Pacific and the Pacific Islands Forum uh<br>uh is it is an organization that was put<br>together so that pacific leaders would<br>have some voice in discussions with<br>their larger uh counterparts Australia<br>and New Zealand it has uh both those<br>countries to the South Micronesia to the<br>north but in the center of the Pacific<br>there are some 10 countries uh that<br>number uh population of only 2.3 million<br>people very very small populations on a<br>number those islands so the economic<br>challenge for them is extremely uh uh<br>acute The Forum is an important body for<br>those smaller voices to be heard for a<br>time I think the importance of the Forum<br>was not well recognized certainly not as<br>well recognized as it should be or was<br>originally intended but if the concept<br>of the Blue Pacific continent is to get<br>legs The Forum needs to be enabled to<br>support uh be supported as the driver of<br>that<br>initiative<br>uh<br>um my notes have just changed a bit here<br>um so can I conclude by saying that<br>competition uh for influence uh and<br>presence in the Pacific is not going to<br>go away the intentions that have been<br>expressed by all of the speakers uh<br>prior to me today uh I think uh<br>very encouraging for what uh may become<br>a better outlook for many of those<br>Pacific nations in the future coring all<br>of that good intention I think is<br>important a regional voice given support<br>for coer for coercive influence from all<br>parties uh who are to who are members of<br>The Forum I think will strengthen its<br>calls for the need of all Pacific<br>Nations to be seen heard and answered so<br>can I conclude by saying that perhaps<br>the question we should be thinking about<br>uh today is not so much China and the<br>challenge of the Pacific as it could be<br>the place of China the US and others in<br>meeting the challenges of the Pacific<br>thank<br>you<br>okay thank you very much uh The<br>Honorable Jerry brownley for that<br>contribution and for injecting some uh<br>further issues into the into the<br>discussion and debate which will be<br>reflected in the way that it's reported<br>uh in due course on the website um<br>before I move to the second<br>session I should say that to ensure that<br>all issues are properly and fairly<br>canvased I will allow any of those<br>participants who have already spoken to<br>reply very briefly to anything said by<br>another participant but not I emphasize<br>to open up any new issues this is only<br>intended as a brief right of<br>reply if any participant wants to<br>exercise that brief right of reply<br>please raise your hand in the zoom<br>purpose in any event that offer will<br>remain open for the remainder of the<br>proceedings I now move to the second<br>session uh where the speaker where where<br>we have four speakers uh starting with<br>Professor Robert Patman director of<br>international studies at the University<br>of AA Professor Patman senot Couture<br>um first of all big thank you to<br>Professor Al Gillespie and Sir Jim mlay<br>putting this session together it's been<br>very stimulating I I'd like to divide my<br>presentation into two some brief<br>comments on the stimulating<br>presentations we've heard but also um I<br>then like to speak about the<br>intersection um between uh New Zealand<br>the indopacific<br>and also um the Putin's illegal invasion<br>of Ukraine because I do think um<br>Although our focus is on the Pacific um<br>these events are connected and I think<br>it's important that we take stock um I<br>like uh J Brown there I was encouraged<br>by the contributions from our<br>ambassadors um the Chinese Ambassador<br>noted uh that the uni China and the<br>United uh China does not see itself<br>engaged in geopolitical competition with<br>the United States or any anyone else he<br>also indicated that he did not think<br>China approached International affairs<br>from a zero sum position um and and and<br>the United States Ambassador also<br>rejected what he called Cold War<br>narratives and quite rightly said that<br>the 21st century is a completely<br>different context um and also put the<br>focus on Peaceful competition the Battle<br>of ideas to influence um the Pacific<br>Islands region and the EU Ambassador I<br>thought made a really important point<br>that uh we have got a level of much<br>greater external engagement now in the<br>Pacific Islands region which must be a<br>good thing uh for the states themselves<br>and uh it's important that their<br>development needs uh are defined by<br>themselves that is they have agency in<br>this process and it seems to me uh that<br>one of the things that flows from some<br>of these presentations is that the<br>Pacific island States um will not<br>necessarily bu we we've have no evidence<br>to suggest that is happening at the<br>moment but should any external power<br>wish to impose some sort of great power<br>uh competition scenario they will not<br>necessarily be interested in the outcome<br>their major concern is clearly U issues<br>such as climate change which represents<br>a very real physical threat to their<br>existence and finally I thought uh Jerry<br>browny made some important points on the<br>New Zealand role in the Pacific we have<br>a large pacifical population as he<br>pointed out and in addition<br>um I think New Zealand May often<br>describes itself as a small state but I<br>think it may also have to think of<br>itself as a bit of a minor power not<br>only does New Zealand share with many of<br>the other speakers a commitment to<br>uphold the rules International rules<br>based system but I think New Zealand can<br>add something quite distinctive here in<br>contributing to the strengthening of the<br>rules-based order and that is something<br>that all New Zealand governments going<br>back to Peter Fraser after the<br>immediately after the second world war<br>has been committed to so I think there's<br>a role there for New Zealand and can<br>bring quite a distinctive contribution<br>on strengthening uh the international<br>rules-based order now let me just talk<br>uh briefly about what I see as the<br>intersection between New Zealand the<br>indopacific<br>and uh Mr Putin's invasion of Ukraine<br>and if you want a quick takeaway I would<br>put it in this way um New Zealand's<br>strategic priority<br>in the indopacific which of course<br>includes the Pacific Islands region is<br>not orcus but helping to defeat uh the<br>Putin invasion of<br>Ukraine uh the Putin's regime's<br>fullscale invasion of Ukraine has had a<br>huge impact on the indopacific region<br>other speakers have were referred to the<br>threat that this Invasion represent to<br>the international rules-based order now<br>these effects have been both economic<br>and diplomatic and who whoever forms the<br>next New Zealand government um after the<br>October the 14th faces the challenge of<br>more clearly I think addressing some of<br>the Strategic consequences that flowed<br>from the Russian invasion of<br>Ukraine orus um which includes uh the<br>United States the UK and Australia seems<br>to be based on the assumption that it<br>will deter or at least counter China's<br>assertive perceived assertiveness in the<br>indopacific region and its Potential<br>Threat uh to the international rules<br>based system but it's unclear whether<br>this Arrangement would necessarily<br>Advance the core national interests of<br>New Zealand while I think government<br>documents have quite uh accurately and<br>rightly uh argued that New Zealand's uh<br>stability security and prosperity<br>depends critically um on an<br>international rules based order on that<br>I don't think there's much dispute in<br>New Zealand it's also plain that China<br>is not the sole or even the most serious<br>threat to that order um the capitals of<br>the indopacific region have been closely<br>monitoring the invasion of Ukraine and<br>given the sensitivity to sovereignty<br>concerns uh Mo many Southeast Southeast<br>Asian uh States in particular supported<br>the UN resolution of 2nd of March 2022<br>condemning Mr Putin's uh so-called<br>special military operation however only<br>Singapore a close us Ally has imposed<br>sanctions on Russia and generally Assan<br>statements on The Invasion have not<br>criticized Moscow directly for Indonesia<br>and many other Southeast Asian States<br>the Russian assault on Ukraine has led<br>to Soaring prices for food and energy<br>and a more more polarized International<br>environment<br>um it should be pointed out that Asian<br>countries are major wheat importers and<br>have been deeply affected by the<br>conflict that's been unfolding uh<br>between Russia and Ukraine meanwhile<br>many states in the indopacific are<br>conscious uh not only of the uh in<br>growing prices of food and fuel but<br>they're also conscious that Regional<br>heavy weights in fact Global<br>heavyweights in the case of china but<br>also Regional heavyweights like India<br>remain important partners of<br>Moscow China has abstained on crucial un<br>resolutions condemning Russian actions<br>in the<br>Ukraine uh repeatedly placing the blame<br>for the conflict on NATO and has<br>massively expanded trade with Russia<br>since the start of the<br>invasion uh military ties between China<br>and Russia continue to deepen the two<br>states have held joint military<br>exercises amongst other things and the<br>PRC has reportedly supplied components<br>to Iran in 20123 for using drones being<br>sold to<br>Russia while the Indian Prime Minister<br>naranda Modi has been more overtly<br>critical than Xi Jinping of Russia's<br>Ukraine Invasion he continues to<br>emphasize close diplomatic and Military<br>ties uh with<br>Russia as another as a third area of<br>concern for indopacific<br>countries in respect to the Russian<br>invasion of<br>Ukraine while many indopacific countries<br>will be aware that the Biden<br>Administration has directed more than 75<br>billion in financial and Military<br>assistance to support Ukraine's fight<br>against Russia NATO has further expanded<br>its membership and there's been a range<br>of comprehensive and Collective<br>sanctions targeting the Russian<br>economy however I think many of these<br>countries May yet still question the<br>staying power behind this American<br>effort when I say American it's not<br>exclusively uh United States effort of<br>course Germany Britain a number of other<br>countries including New Zealand but also<br>Australia and Canada have played a a big<br>part in trying to help Ukraine defend<br>its sovereignty however the question<br>mark about staying power flows from the<br>fact that the Biden Administration has<br>sometimes tried not to provoke Putin's<br>regime in supporting the defense of<br>Ukraine's sovereignty and measuring out<br>the provision of weapons some rather<br>than sort of helping Ukraine to<br>rigorously attempt to win the<br>war also it must be pointed out and this<br>won't be lost in many capitals in the<br>indopacific that many International<br>supporters of<br>Ukraine uh include those that champion a<br>land for peace deal with Mr Putin that<br>the idea that Ukraine should give up<br>some of its territory for some sort of<br>deal with the authoritarian regime in<br>Moscow and of course another factor that<br>is also weighing being weighed in<br>indopacific capitals as well as in other<br>countries is the possibility that a new<br>Republican Administration may come to<br>power in<br>2024 and that might change American<br>policy towards the Ukraine in the<br>circumstances I think it's important<br>that New Zealand remain very cleare eyed<br>about the linkage between its strategic<br>interests in the Indo Pacific region and<br>also the necessity of defeating Putin's<br>expansionism in Ukraine um to date New<br>Zealand has contributed more than 70<br>million in humanitarian military aid but<br>the aid effort to a liberal democracy<br>that gave up its nuclear weapons in 1994<br>for and shares New Zealand's goal of<br>reforming the United Nations security<br>Council looks pretty modest given the<br>scale of the possible Fallout for the<br>indopacific region if Mr Putin gets any<br>sort of victory in Ukraine the best way<br>for New Zealand in my view to contribute<br>uh to strengthening the rules-based<br>order is to significantly increase its<br>military support for president sink's<br>government<br>in<br>keev if Putin if Mr Putin's Army is<br>defeated or forced to withdraw from<br>Ukraine it will be I believe um a step<br>in strengthening the rules-based order<br>um if Mr Putin derives any Victory then<br>I think there will be grave concerns<br>about the viability and the staying<br>power of that International rules-based<br>order and so I I I'll stop there and and<br>thank you very much Professor Patman for<br>for those enlightening comments which um<br>again will be recorded and placed on the<br>website with as part of the proceedings<br>of this virtual conference I now call on<br>Dr Ana poles of the center for defense<br>and security studies at Massi University<br>paulot thank you very much for for<br>having me this evening and and a<br>particular thanks to professor arales<br>and and Sir Jim mlay and and obviously<br>to the other speakers as well it's it's<br>been a fascinating uh time listening to<br>the various uh speeches um presentations<br>given so far and before I start mine<br>I'll just Begin by noting that uh<br>the one of of the the the uh the<br>references to Peaceful uh competition<br>but also uh the reference to C how to<br>capture the current interest and and the<br>focus on on all the various different<br>actors who are re-engaging uh and<br>engaging more deeply in the Pacific uh<br>does actually raise a question uh which<br>the EU Ambassador neatly noted with<br>respect to uh the question itself of<br>this of this Forum uh which was the<br>challenge of the Pacific but what the<br>challenge uh what the challenge issued<br>by the Pacific actually is and I think<br>that that's I'm going to return to that<br>uh shortly because I would argue that<br>that challenge issued by the Pacific<br>also calls for better and improved<br>coordination and cooperation amongst<br>Partners as well and as we've seen here<br>uh this evening for for me in Washington<br>this evening there's a great deal of<br>activity<br>an increase in Tempo taking place so I<br>would like to uh be to begin by saying<br>that the focus of what I would like to<br>uh talk about and the way that I have<br>taken the question of of the challenge<br>to the Pacific is actually the challenge<br>posed by strategic competition and the<br>dynamic relationship between geopolitics<br>and Regional order that has resulted as<br>a consequence of strategic competition<br>which as we know has intensified in the<br>Pacific since 2014 and we are seeing a<br>level of dynamism between external<br>interests and Pacific sovereignty and<br>agency in a way that we haven't really<br>seen since the 1960s the period of<br>decolonization particularly uh but also<br>sort of reemerged in the early<br>2000s now for for many for many uh<br>Pacific<br>leaders uh this this tension and this<br>dilemma between these intersecting in<br>concerns uh are first that uh and I and<br>I quote here that the big powers are<br>doggedly pursuing strategies to widen<br>and extend their reach in inculcating a<br>far-reaching sense of insecurity in the<br>region secondly a deep frustration that<br>the region is being pressured to choose<br>between a China alternative and our<br>traditional Partners at the expense of<br>development imperatives and Pacific<br>calls for climate action and thirdly<br>that pacific approaches to managing<br>strategic competition at both the<br>national and Regional levels are<br>increasingly being tested and in in<br>essence that Pacific States and the<br>region are increasingly being faced with<br>a strategic choice not of their making<br>and that's very much what I'd like to<br>focus on uh now is that that tension<br>between that geopolitical and and and<br>Pacific regionalism it's noteworthy that<br>the Pacific island Forum<br>inaugural security Outlook report which<br>was released earlier this year describes<br>an increasingly contested region with<br>the UN United States and its allies<br>seeking to maintain I quote here the<br>regional dominance they've held since<br>the colonial era and China is seeking to<br>advance its own strategic agenda the<br>Contemporary Pacific Regional order is a<br>Confluence and increasingly contest of<br>three Dynamics Pacific Le narratives and<br>priorities driven by the Blue Pacific<br>narrative the interests and agendas of<br>the of the former and ongoing Colonial<br>powers in the<br>region as well as new development<br>Partners uh too all of whom uh since<br>2017 have developed strategic Frameworks<br>to frame their increasing engagement<br>with China with the Pacific sorry and<br>also China of course uh who is not a new<br>partner in the region uh By Any stret of<br>of the imagination but certainly uh<br>since 2014 has substantially increased<br>its engagement to to which led to in<br>2022 a proposed Chinese Le Al<br>alternative Regional<br>architecture so the first of those three<br>is the Blue Pacific Regional order<br>driven by the Pacific isance Forum<br>articulated in the 2050 strategy for the<br>Blue Pacific continent adopted in 2022<br>and it was advanced in 2017 and<br>emphasizes the agency strategic autonomy<br>and activism of Pacific countries as<br>well as the importance of the Region's<br>own security architecture in the<br>changing Regional order the Blue Pacific<br>Regional order Builds on the success of<br>collective action including the 1985<br>Treaty of ratonga which created the<br>South Pacific nuclear free zone and more<br>recently Collective success in the<br>Spheres of international climate<br>diplomacy and oceans governance and we<br>saw that very recently in New York last<br>week it captures what is known as the<br>new Pacific diplomacy which reflected a<br>fundamental shift around 2009 in the way<br>Pacific States engaged in Regional and<br>International Affairs in part driven by<br>frustration with Western dominance of<br>regional institutions as well as the<br>established Regional order and the<br>desire to exercise their autonomy and<br>influence this content fueled Regional<br>Dynamics including those which drove the<br>fracturing of the Pacific island Forum<br>in<br>2021 the Blue Pacific Regional order is<br>also reflected in the Pacific security<br>agenda Advanced by The Forum 2018 boy<br>Declaration on Regional<br>security and similarly The Narrative<br>also strategically seeks to influence<br>the policies of the Region's Partners a<br>practice strategy among small states by<br>advancing and promoting Regional order<br>narratives such as the Blue Pacific<br>narrative Pacific island countries aim<br>to influence the foreign policy behavior<br>of their Partners in other states by<br>shaping their perceptions and guiding<br>their policy choices and this has<br>largely been successful which brings me<br>to the second Dynamic partner countries<br>have responded as we've heard this<br>evening with enthusiasm to re-engaging<br>with the Pacific to the Blue Pacific<br>narrative particularly embracing the<br>legitimacy it affords their engagement<br>and aligning their development<br>priorities with the 2050 strategy for<br>the Blue Pacific in including some<br>appropriation of the narrative itself<br>and adopting the rhetoric of forum<br>centrality even when the Blue Pacific<br>narrative and forance centrality had<br>been circumvented and<br>undermined within this Dynamic Pacific<br>island for for member countries New<br>Zealand and Australia have sought to not<br>always successfully strategically shape<br>partner engagement in the region as the<br>tempo of partner engagement has<br>increased Wellington and camra<br>particularly have sought to safeg guard<br>and cultivate their own interests<br>including their own centrality and<br>credibility within the regional order<br>through the promotion of the Blue<br>Pacific narrative and forum cality and<br>by leveraging the perceived and assumed<br>influence in the region and this<br>strategy is not without its risks and we<br>see some of those risks playing out in<br>the Providence of the partners in the<br>Blue Pacific initiative launched in<br>2022 the third Dynamic is the<br>alternative Regional order Advanced by<br>China in<br>2022 as we know that prior to the China<br>Pacific Islands countries foreign<br>ministers meeting China proposed the<br>China Pacific Islands common development<br>Vision with the aim of the draft<br>communicate being adopted at the foreign<br>ministers meeting the common development<br>Vision sought to reshape the regional<br>order in the Pacific Islands through the<br>advancement and close alignment of<br>ambitious security and economic<br>initiatives it proposed substantial<br>trade and investment initiatives<br>including a China Pacific islands's free<br>trade area aligned the bton road<br>initiative with the 2050 strategy for<br>the Blue Pacific and proposed numerous<br>security sector initiatives from law<br>enforcement elevating law enforcement<br>cooperation to ministerial levels cyber<br>security smart Customs data networks uh<br>and so forth despite the rejection of<br>the common development Vision by Pacific<br>leaders it reflected Chinese Ambitions<br>to build an alternative Regional<br>architecture in the Pacific these<br>Ambitions have being realized in the<br>context of security cooperation and in<br>humanitarian assistance and disaster<br>relief China's announcement for the<br>first time that it is a direct<br>stakeholder in the security of the<br>Pacific has been followed with security<br>and policing Arrangements most notably<br>with Solomon Islands including the<br>security deal of<br>2022 and also through the building of<br>defense and security attaches networks<br>and security INF<br>structure now of course a number of<br>these initiatives are welcomed by their<br>by China's Pacific Partners uh however<br>the concerns where the concerns lie is<br>that China's alternative security<br>architecture could potentially cut<br>across and undermine the existing<br>peaceful Regional Security Pacific<br>Regional security architecture including<br>existing crisis management mechanisms<br>such as the Pacific island Forum 2000<br>batawa declaration which provided the<br>Mandate for the Australian Leed<br>intervention in Solomon Island in<br>2003 and this is where the concerns for<br>for many of us uh are lie is the tension<br>between that strategic competition uh is<br>that the tension is taking place in in<br>countries on the ground and China's<br>Emergen as a security partner Solomon<br>Islands alongside<br>Australia as who has long has long been<br>the preferred security partner of choice<br>has re revealed the risks of strategic<br>competition intersecting with local<br>security Dynamics<br>and the danger here of course is that is<br>that what the Pacific countries have<br>been calling for for for for a very long<br>time of<br>cooperation if not collaboration but<br>certainly cooperation we certainly need<br>to see that in the space of humanitarian<br>assistance and disaster relief and as<br>China seeks a role as a humanitarian<br>responder and key stakeholder in<br>disaster<br>responses in the Pacific as witness in<br>response to the tongen eruption and<br>tsunami in 22 albe it outside the<br>existing Regional humanitarian<br>architecture and disaster humanitarian<br>assistance and disaster relief<br>architecture more work obviously needs<br>to be done to ensure that we do not have<br>two parallel<br>Hadar architectures in the Pacific<br>Pacific countries have responded to the<br>competing visions of the regional order<br>by consistently stating that they prefer<br>a regional order that is characterized<br>neither by us nor Chinese Hy these are<br>there are certainly contrasting stances<br>between those Pacific members of<br>non-aligned movement and those Pacific<br>countries closely aligned with the<br>United States however as a result of<br>strategic competition in the Pacific a<br>broad consensus has emerged amongst<br>Pacific States it is driven by two<br>demands first as I said before that<br>Partners cooperate rather than compete<br>and secondly that pacific interests and<br>priorities shape and drve the regional<br>security<br>agenda this has led to Pacific States<br>hedging the US allies and partners and<br>China it has also led to Pacific Stakes<br>making strategic choices at times Under<br>Pressure the lesson here is that<br>National interest and Regional dynamism<br>paints a complex picture of Pacific<br>agency which is frequently poorly<br>understood in the last few years a third<br>element of the Pacific consensus has<br>emerged this is one of recognition that<br>strategic competition is directly<br>impacting Regional politics and security<br>and this is specifically stated in the<br>2050 strategy this includes reducing the<br>Strategic economy of Pacific States<br>advanced in the Blue Pacific narrative<br>and growing concerns that despite<br>partner support both rhetorical and<br>material for be for peace and Security<br>in the region competition is leading to<br>militarization suggesting that foreign<br>policy stances such as friends to all<br>and enemies To None are no longer<br>sufficient for managing strategic<br>competition as well as calls to advance<br>a collective security treaty in order to<br>better manage asymmetrical relations and<br>balance external<br>powers to conclude here the current<br>Pacific Regional order is one of<br>increasingly of competition and coercion<br>at a time when the Pacific region is<br>still in the process of state and nation<br>building the ability of the Pacific<br>Pacific to navigate and manage strategic<br>competition in the future is is is murky<br>certainly arguably strengthening<br>existing approaches to collective<br>security by building on existing<br>declarations and extent strategic<br>mechanisms and enshrining collective<br>security principles would benefit the<br>Pacific and strength in<br>regionalism the face of the Pacific<br>Regional order will look very different<br>over the next decade as it evolves the<br>leaders of the post-independence era<br>with strong ties to the Region's<br>traditional Partners will be replaced by<br>the next generation of leaders who may<br>not share those same ties regionalism<br>itself will evolve as non-state actors<br>local norms and informal practices<br>continue to shape the Pacific the role<br>that the Pacific arms Forum will play in<br>the in the evolving Regional order is<br>not is is by no means a given equally<br>importantly as partners seek to increase<br>their engagement with the Pacific and to<br>position themselves as preferred<br>Partners integrated into the regional<br>order greater effort must be taken to<br>ensure that geopolitics does not ex<br>exacerbate local security Dynamics and<br>that engagement is constructive rather<br>than disruptive thank<br>you thank you very much indeed Dr Pauls<br>for that contribution coming as I if I<br>calculate cor correctly quite late at<br>night in Washington DC so thank you for<br>your<br>participation I now call upon Professor<br>Steven rova the director of the McMillan<br>Brown Center for Pacific studies at the<br>University of Canterbury Professor<br>Raza thanks so much uh uh Sim uh i'<br>would like to acknowledge the presence<br>here of the ambassadors of uh the P's<br>Republic of China the United States<br>European union and U um The Honorable uh<br>Jerry Brown Lee and also my colleagues<br>who've spoken earlier uh Robert uh and<br>Anna they've said everything that I<br>wanted to say um so I've been watching<br>been watching and and listening with<br>very very a lot of interest in in in<br>relation to the uh presentations and<br>it's not often that you have the<br>ambassadors of China and the United<br>States together in the same um um<br>session discussing their uh different uh<br>geopolitical uh interest in this part of<br>the world in the Pacific and U uh<br>certainly learn a lot in terms of what's<br>happening in in the minds of the big<br>powers and that's certainly the question<br>which is raised by the Pacific island<br>people themselves in relation to what<br>exactly is happening around us how they<br>thinking about us and what kind of<br>Leverage are they U are they using as a<br>means of winning our loyalty I'll<br>probably U look at things from the point<br>of view of um what the European<br>Ambassador brilliantly referred to as<br>the the Pacific island agency because I<br>think it's very very important to<br>understand where they are they fit into<br>the big power dynamics uh certainly<br>what's happening now is nothing new uh<br>if you look at the the historical<br>development of geopolitics in the<br>Pacific since the end of the Cold War uh<br>I did a presentation the other day was<br>it two days ago um online for conference<br>taking place in in Wellington I couldn't<br>get there because of the U um the fact I<br>was quite busy I tried<br>to categorize the period between now and<br>the uh uh the end of the second world<br>war the beginning of the Cold War into<br>four faces Al together the first was the<br>Cold war contestation between the Soviet<br>Union and the United States of course um<br>uh there was you know a period when the<br>South Pacific nuclear free zone treaty<br>was uh created and signed by the island<br>countries in the Pacific including<br>Australia New Zealand and U was Peri of<br>decolonization as well and nuclear<br>testing in the Pacific and phase two was<br>if you like the post cold war war on<br>terror scenario where the security<br>framing of the Pacific particularly by<br>Australia and the United States uh was<br>geared towards the U uh potential<br>so-called Islamic terrorism in this part<br>of the world and the rise of terms such<br>as a of instability referring to pivic<br>and so forth and Australia's Cooperative<br>intervention uh strategy and then the<br>phase three I talk about the uh<br>emergence of China as a power in this<br>part of the world and of course the west<br>west response and the contestation<br>between the two major blocks<br>uh the belt and Road and the US P to<br>Asia the Pacific under Obama and<br>Australia stup policy and New Zealand is<br>reset and changed to resilience<br>Australia changed from seep up to Vali<br>and the United Kingdom it's uplift<br>policy and Indonesia Elevate uh and a<br>number of Island states in the region<br>the the luk north policy so different<br>kinds of policy framing uh in relation<br>to not just Economic Development also uh<br>in in relation to security and uh and<br>then I mentioned that what<br>we uh what we have now is is the if you<br>like the indopacific<br>phase the shift from the ASAP Pacific to<br>the Indo Pacific the incorporation of<br>India into the picture and so forth so<br>so from the point of view of the Pacific<br>island States they're wondering now<br>What's Happening Here uh there been a<br>lot of shifts in the<br>geopolitical U areas of contestation<br>uh different players with the Indo<br>Pacific for instance there are two<br>aspects two components of it one is the<br>Quant uh consisting of Japan India and<br>the United States uh and Australia uh<br>and then you have the O the occus uh<br>consisting of the United Kingdom<br>Australia and and the US so U so in the<br>last few months last few years the<br>Pacific island leaders have been asking<br>what is there in it form in relation to<br>security uh which is<br>being which is part of The Narrative of<br>selling uh the the Indo pivic Concept in<br>the<br>region so listening to the discussion um<br>is quite interesting not only in terms<br>of the areas of uh of of commonalities<br>in terms of particularly in terms of the<br>uh some of the narratives of security uh<br>I note that in the case of china the<br>notion of equality openness and<br>corporation uh in the case of United<br>States open free prosperous and secure<br>um and the European Union as well open<br>and fair so there a lot of commonalities<br>in terms of some of those the languages<br>coming out I suppose the uh the question<br>which I want to pose here is uh uh what<br>exactly do those terms mean for instance<br>when you talk about U openness<br>all of them use the word openness what<br>exactly does it mean certainly it has a<br>political ideological meaning behind it<br>uh in the case of China in the case of<br>United States um certainly the European<br>Union as well and U uh uh and from the<br>point of view of the Pacific island<br>agency what does it mean in terms of<br>openness uh does it open up the Pacific<br>to any one who passes by uh and imposes<br>its security agenda<br>um or is it based on the idea of um U uh<br>allowing the Pacific uh to be a place of<br>peaceful engagement between in open<br>engagement between the powers I remember<br>in<br>2011 uh 11 2010 2011 uh Mrs Clinton who<br>was Secretary of State then who visited<br>the Pacific as well and um uh<br>um around that period uh talk about the<br>Pacific being big enough for everybody<br>with China and the United States and<br>China responded in kind uh they also<br>mentioned that yes certainly the Pacific<br>is uh um is is a is big enough for<br>everybody now uh when you read the<br>speeches of uh coming out of uh Clinton<br>as well as the from China Min of Foreign<br>Affairs in China it is if the same<br>speech writer was writing uh the two<br>speeches so um um certainly from the<br>point of view of the civan states U uh<br>what does it mean in terms of uh this<br>their sovereignty what does it mean in<br>terms of their security what does it<br>mean in terms of um um their development<br>agenda now often when you talk about the<br>Pacific we talk about uh we assume a<br>generic um entity when in fact it's<br>quite complex not only in terms of the<br>number of States involved The Forum the<br>South Pacific commission um uh which is<br>a bit larger in terms of the number of<br>countries and uh if you include um uh<br>well Hawaii is part of the United States<br>uh if you go beyond uh just the uh the<br>the Civ Forum boundary then it gets<br>bigger and bigger now we can look at<br>observing in terms of three layers one<br>is the island States themselves who have<br>long history of Connections in terms of<br>culture uh in terms of genealogical<br>connections which extends as far as the<br>Maris uh in AO New Zealand and that has<br>been there for thousands of years as the<br>ancestors of the PF island is um uh<br>Traverse the largest ocean in the world<br>and then you have uh the the second<br>layer uh which<br>is uh New Zealand and Australia they're<br>part of the Pacific they're part of the<br>Forum but they also donors they're also<br>uh big economic economically large<br>countries and politically powerful<br>countries engaging in the region so<br>they're part of the Forum at the same<br>time they have strong links with<br>external Powers Australia for instance<br>through OAS uh and through the<br>indopacific<br>um<br>framework and the third layer are the<br>big powers like China in the United<br>States and we're listening to them today<br>which is quite interesting and their<br>perception of the first layer of the P<br>Island countries and of course all these<br>layers are interconnected in different<br>ways geopolitically uh in terms of the<br>security narratives and so forth but uh<br>what I suppose distinguishes the layers<br>uh in the context of what we're<br>discussing today is their actual<br>security interests and secur<br>it um understanding of the world to the<br>firstly<br>the island countries uh their most<br>immediate<br>security consideration is really climate<br>change is really to do with the fact<br>that much of the island is beginning to<br>be inundated um the destruction of the<br>uh of the reefs as a result of uh the<br>warming of the sea and erosion and<br>category five Cyclones and they're<br>facing the U uh all these um issues all<br>the<br>time and U um uh and that's where I<br>think things become uh very very<br>interesting in terms of the gap between<br>if you like the P Island States and the<br>big Powers who have we've heard you know<br>from them<br>today now one of the ways in which the<br>Pacific<br>Island States see themselves as being<br>significant is how uh they perceive uh<br>diplomatic engagement is a way of<br>winning their loyalty winning their<br>support uh for the<br>particular um um geopolitical interests<br>of the big powers and it is indeed one<br>of the ways in which this is done uh the<br>Chinese have been uh giving a for number<br>of years in fact almost every public<br>buildings all around the um um uh the<br>Pacific uh have been donated by by by by<br>by China uh as mentioned earlier by um<br>Mr uh brownly a lot of those<br>have disintegrated as a result of the<br>the rather poor quality of the aid uh<br>given and a lot of money is being<br>spanned trying to um uh repair them on<br>the other hand countries like Australia<br>and New Zealand as well uh give Aid<br>which uh often finds his way back to the<br>donor countries um one of the terms used<br>is<br>um um is boomerang Aid uh because a lot<br>of the money goes into the pockets of<br>the<br>contractors uh if you see the aid into<br>the Pacific in the last say 50 years has<br>been a tremendous increase<br>um uh over time but if you consider the<br>level of poverty has been increasing as<br>well and<br>health conditions have been worsening<br>and esec and also the well-being of the<br>people there's no direct correlation<br>between the amount of Aid which is given<br>and the U the Improvement of people's<br>well-being the number of reasons for<br>that I've given you one one is that a<br>lot of the Aid comes back to the Don<br>countries and that's something which um<br>not only Australian Aid not only New<br>Zealand Aid Chinese Aid as well because<br>a lot of Aid is in the form of flan soft<br>loan which goes back to exim bank and U<br>uh China uses its own Personnel um<br>sometimes locally as well U and a lot of<br>that money goes back to China so um and<br>also because a lot of Aid is wrapped up<br>in geopolitical dressing<br>um and that makes it much more difficult<br>to look through so um so in terms of the<br>developmental aspect of uh relationship<br>between the big powers and the Pacific<br>island<br>States uh the result on the ground is<br>different from what the rhetoric uh<br>within the political space talks about<br>um while the narrative talks about<br>collaboration and development uh what<br>happens on the ground is very<br>different now let me um uh<br>also connect this to the U um<br>2050 uh Blue Pacific<br>strategy now the 2050 Blue Pacific<br>strategy<br>um was put together as a way of<br>affirming the Future Vision of the<br>Pacific uh people in relation to<br>development in relation to uh<br>inclusivity and Equity governance<br>education research technology resilience<br>well-being and partnership these are the<br>if you like the five visions of the<br>2050 document but I think what has<br>happened in the last uh uh couple of<br>years and months is the way in which<br>this document have been used by the big<br>Powers uh both the US and China as a way<br>of uh connecting as well as seeing<br>themselves as part of the implementers<br>funders uh for the future um which is<br>something raises a number of uh issues<br>in in relation to uh the sovereignty of<br>small island States uh in fact they big<br>ocean States not small island States uh<br>the sovereignty and the autonomy in<br>terms of determining the trajectory of<br>the development into the future and I<br>think uh some of the narratives which<br>are coming out<br>of presentation of the two uh<br>ambassadors from China in the United<br>States have to do with the respect for<br>sovereignty I think this where should uh<br>be uh used U so the gap between if you<br>like the geopolitical geost Strategic<br>narrative and application of that on the<br>ground is very very significant<br>application in terms of how it makes<br>sense to the Pacific island<br>States now the the last point I want to<br>uh raise here is to do with working<br>together um I notice that uh um<br>um the Chinese Ambassador and the<br>American ambassador uh talking about<br>potential for working together and I<br>think that's great in relation to uh how<br>can they promote peace in the region by<br>working working together uh competition<br>is good uh but often competition can<br>also lead to contestation and<br>competition economic and political<br>ideological competition can also lead to<br>uh uh contestation which can be negative<br>as well so the implications and the<br>consequences of that competition on the<br>Pacific island States is something that<br>we have to be wored about<br>uh because those<br>consequences um can be U um can lead<br>to um to things which we don't<br>foresee now so the<br>um um I was very interested in the<br>position of the European Union because<br>it appears that the European Union um<br>uh uh presentation by the Ambassador uh<br>positions itself uh in between the two<br>and in fact I noted down in in the note<br>which I was writing while listening is U<br>European Union referee can be a referee<br>between the two in terms of bringing<br>them together in terms of providing uh a<br>a space for for commonality and that's<br>precisely what the Pacific needs in<br>terms of moving forward is not so much<br>competition with cons which consequence<br>whose<br>consequences uh can be destructive but<br>rather cooporation which can be for the<br>benefit of everyone not only the two<br>major Powers but also uh the Pacific<br>island States uh who whose security<br>interests are not so much to do with<br>geopolitics but to do with issues of<br>development issues of poverty of<br>well-being of health of Education these<br>are and of course climate crisis the<br>climate change that we are facing now so<br>those are the issues which they're<br>facing and um U and just competition<br>geopolitic iCal purposes can actually<br>undermine and overshadow and even worsen<br>some of those human security issues uh<br>which are being faced by the Pacific<br>island<br>States uh every day in the uh uh in the<br>U in the way they run the countries so<br>um I will stop there what I've basically<br>tried to do was to pick bits and pieces<br>from the discussion uh because a lot of<br>what I wanted to say earlier have been<br>covered by my two<br>um uh my two uh colleagues uh Robert and<br>Anna so are basically trying to pull<br>together a few pieces from the<br>presentations early presentations and<br>how perhaps we can work together uh in<br>the Pacific uh to move from competition<br>and contestation into peaceful<br>engagement and coexistence thank you so<br>much<br>k um I'm Al gisby I'm also the hamster<br>and the wheel that's been running around<br>for the last year trying to help pull<br>this together but nothing would have<br>been possible without Jim uh Oliver Clen<br>fetu uh the high level dignitaries that<br>have come today to speak to us um my<br>colleagues my academic colleagues I just<br>want to say thank you to all of you to<br>my mind nothing is more important right<br>now than the Quest for Peace and<br>wherever we can advance that it it's<br>critical um I'm going to try to tie<br>together a few themes but as Steven was<br>bemoaning before me that he was trying<br>finding it hard to pick up pieces after<br>both Anna and Robert had spoken<br>following the four ambassadors I'm now<br>after Steven and so the chances for<br>originality are near zero so I'm just<br>going to speak about where I see a few<br>considerations my interest in this area<br>began when I was in Samoa a few years<br>ago and I went for a run one morning and<br>I was um on apia Hara and there was a<br>plark about a Cyclone that arrived in<br>1889 and this Cyclone took out six of<br>seven uh sloops which were kind of like<br>one level warships three were German<br>three were American the British one<br>survived it's rare that a cyclone is a<br>welcome thing in the Pacific but this<br>one particular Cyclone potentially<br>stopped a conflict because both the<br>Americans and the Germans were backing<br>different contenders over constitutional<br>debate of Dynasty in<br>Samoa uh It ultimately didn't end up<br>good for Samoa Samoa got divided between<br>America and Germany in a subsequent deal<br>but it did tell me something that this<br>interest of the external world and<br>geopolitical competition in the Pacific<br>is not new it goes back to the 19th<br>century it's gone in phases the 21st<br>century is different to where we are now<br>the challenges perhaps<br>greater But the irony of all this<br>interest of over hundreds of years of<br>focus in the Pacific is that much of it<br>remains significantly<br>underdeveloped when I see the<br>underdevelopment it's not just the<br>economic situation it's their<br>vulnerability it's their Social<br>Challenges it's a plethora of concerns<br>that we have to address as the<br>International Community there are 46<br>least developed countries in this world<br>and these aren't just poor places these<br>are the poorest of the poor four of the<br>ldcs are in the Pacific two of them SAR<br>and banatu are just above the LDC<br>line and for decades they have been<br>neglected these countries and their<br>quest for sustainable development<br>respect important resources that they<br>need and now the world has changed and<br>it's almost dizzying to try to keep<br>track with how popular some of these<br>these leaders of these countries are<br>it's now a diplomatic dance between<br>Washington and Beijing where the dance<br>card of many leaders is full and their<br>offers being made are significant and<br>they've gone from being near invisible<br>on the international stage to now being<br>almost at the center of it and many<br>people spend our lives trying to work<br>out who's in who's out and trying to<br>dissect the very small parts of words<br>and what they may or may not<br>mean I want to focus on three things of<br>where I see the chance for Success where<br>I have a warning light and where I have<br>a concern where I think the chance of<br>success is greatest for the Pacific is<br>over Aid or assistance or grants that<br>will we effectively give on a basis<br>where it doesn't need to be repaid we're<br>at the point where since 2008 over 50<br>billion<br>57,000 projects have been undertaken in<br>the Pacific the largest grantors uh<br>Australia New Zealand United States<br>China is now also growing quickly in<br>this space and this is good but let's be<br>honest it it could be a lot better uh<br>what Mr brownley said before about the<br>the difficulties in the continuity of<br>Aid is true we've seen these problems<br>not in the Pacific but we saw them in<br>the second half of the 20 20th century<br>in other countries where you would get<br>four water pumps from different<br>providers in the same Village in Africa<br>and it it's just it's not just a waste<br>it's a lost opportunity if we can have<br>coordinated aligned consistent<br>accountable and transparent Aid and it's<br>linked to multilateral goals like the<br>sustainable development goals or the<br>global climate fund we have the chance<br>for Progress it is true that the amount<br>of Aid we have given as a percentage of<br>GDP has declined but there is still a<br>significant amount of cash on the table<br>and if this is coordinated well better<br>than it has been traditionally there is<br>a chance for positive<br>outcomes where I have a neutral view is<br>over the question of debt because one<br>part that we are seeing change is that<br>although Aid and multilateral assistance<br>is the dominant feature in thef<br>increasingly loans are not far<br>behind this creates a risk the debt trap<br>is not a new invention the debt trap of<br>countries goes back over 150 years and<br>if countries get into debt their risk is<br>making not only choices where they are<br>beholden to external parties but also<br>difficult choices that can create<br>challenges in their own types of<br>government I don't think we're at the<br>stage where it's a crisis but I do see<br>clouds on the horizon the World Bank<br>currently identifies six highrisk debt<br>distress countries in the Pacific<br>region this could be turned better the<br>risk could be negated if we focused more<br>on multilateral institutions if we<br>emphasized Aid and grants over loans and<br>if we worked together the vulnerability<br>of countries which are poor and behold<br>to others creates risk for all<br>nations my third area and this is one<br>that Anna talked about is the risk of<br>militarization and this is where I do<br>see warning lights one of the upsides of<br>being in<br>the The Not So visible part of the first<br>cold war is that not much happened in<br>the Pacific and that meant that our<br>quest for Independence our focus on<br>being nuclear free to a degree<br>nonaligned for many countries was<br>possible and this was a a useful<br>Advantage but in recent times we have<br>seen a<br>militarization we see it not just with<br>regards to the obvious places but we've<br>seen it spill over with regards to the<br>issues of security Maritime Security<br>Police security military security the<br>lines start to blur between all of these<br>places we can witness new agreements<br>recent agreements uh with PNG with<br>Vanuatu with Fiji with the Solomon with<br>teamour as well some of them go one way<br>some of them go another but the trend<br>clearly is that there is a<br>militarization which is occurring and<br>this is happening in relatively short<br>space of<br>time the risk if there's a flash point<br>is that when you have a constitutional<br>debate in any Pacific country that two<br>sides support opposing parties this is a<br>risk that we must seek to avoid at all<br>points We should strive continually for<br>regional Solutions we should try to<br>build civil Security in inclusive<br>Cooperative ways the risk of trying to<br>pick one side or the other to the<br>exclusion of<br>Outsiders is an UNP palal<br>suggestion so that's it I'm going to<br>keep it short<br>what I wanted to say one this is part of<br>a long sequence of History this is just<br>the most recent one where the Pacific is<br>at risk of international<br>geopolitics the Deep history in this<br>area is something we should keep in mind<br>two there's positive prospects for<br>cooperation over Aid assistance and<br>grants three with the issue of debt it's<br>neutral but there are clouds on the<br>horizon and four we must strive to avoid<br>the militarization of the region because<br>the risks of that could be<br>catastrophic thank you thank you very<br>much uh Al Gillespie for that<br>contribution which I think wrapped up<br>many of the issues that uh are of<br>concern and were raised as matters of<br>concern it's my task now to<br>um draw the threads of this discussion<br>together to do so in a way that<br>hopefully will be advantageous I'm not I<br>will try not to introduce new<br>matter because we're past that point and<br>indeed it's difficult to determine what<br>new meta might still be to be<br>tabled there is an advantage when you<br>ask eight participants to answer the<br>same question you get eight different<br>answers and that certainly was the<br>experience today and I think we're all<br>the more value was all the more valuable<br>in experience for that reason the<br>Pacific is unquestionable a dynamic<br>region and is becoming more so with the<br>renewed interest the interest in this<br>region is not new but it is being<br>differently played out than it was say<br>in previous centuries both 19th and<br>20th uh the issues that were raised were<br>invariably those of the uh that are<br>frequently heard at the Pacific forum<br>and and at similar uh similar meetings<br>throughout the region and in similar<br>debates and discussions such as this the<br>emphasis on was seemingly all the time<br>on uh<br>competition<br>on avoiding<br>conflict on ensuring that people and uh<br>People to People<br>relationships trade and the like were<br>the emphasis not not<br>conflict not relationships are not just<br>government to government they are also<br>People to People<br>uh competition will not go away that was<br>made very clear in a number of the<br>contributions even those who didn't<br>really want to see competition uh but<br>rather rather wanted to avoid a cold war<br>narrative the relationship must be<br>peaceful the in for example the battle<br>for ideas rather than the experience of<br>of uh conflict on a more significant<br>basis the significance of history is is<br>very important here uh came home to me<br>as I was listening to particularly to<br>Ambassador obam's<br>contribution that all all of the<br>contributors today represented countries<br>or regions from which people immigrated<br>to the Pacific and settled in this<br>region in other words there is a diff a<br>strong and definable relationship<br>between the Pacific and the people who<br>settled it both<br>uh both the original Polynesians the<br>original settlers and those who came<br>after them there is a need for<br>development Partners both within the<br>region Australia and New Zealand beyond<br>the region EU and those who straddle the<br>region the People's Republic of China<br>and the United States of America are the<br>obvious candidates<br>there climate change was mentioned by<br>many<br>participants the significance of the icj<br>advisory opinion on climate change is<br>very important and will continue to be<br>addressed at the security Council and<br>elsewhere as the Pacific island<br>countries discover that they do there<br>are forums that they can adopt and uh<br>methods that they diplomatic methods<br>that they can adopt to ensure that these<br>discussed there were five issues that<br>were raised which were important but<br>were not pursued by every um participant<br>and I think I should just list them<br>rather than rather than address them as<br>as issues the first is the significance<br>of the war on Ukraine uh there were<br>different perspectives on this but<br>unquestionably it does have implications<br>for this region as it does indeed<br>globally secondly there was the need for<br>an alterntive there was the request for<br>an alternative Regional order only<br>mentioned by one or two but clearly a<br>matter of importance for those who<br>raised it thirdly geopolitics must not<br>be allowed to exacerbate Regional<br>tensions and problems that is very clear<br>not always addressed by every<br>participant in the ma in the words that<br>I have just expressed but nonetheless<br>important the significance of boomerang<br>Aid was the fourth issue that<br>I heard as as raised uh it's a nice<br>phrase we've seen it in Africa as well<br>as in the Pacific it's not it's not new<br>but it is a matter that is of concern<br>concern to those who receive Aid only to<br>see it spent in the in the donor<br>country de trap only two participants<br>raised this but it was in fact it is in<br>fact an important issue that the problem<br>and the concern of soft loans turn into<br>hard debt and the need to address that<br>as an issue the may have onlybe two or<br>three in the region that are presently<br>threatened by such debt but it is an<br>important issue and will become<br>increasingly important as the debt level<br>of debt increases and finally there was<br>the threat of militarism and the need to<br>avoid that at all possible this is not a<br>region that is new to militarism saw it<br>in the 19 4145 period and it has it has<br>defined much of the Pacific that<br>followed in the years of the Cold War I<br>could go into great detail on all of the<br>matters that were addressed and<br>discussed but simply say that this has<br>been an extraordinar valuable<br>discussion that those I think those who<br>participated today and and in<br>anticipation of those who will be<br>following up by going to the website I<br>KERO you find Value in our discussions<br>and I call<br>closing to everyone acknowledge those<br>been part of this our proceedings and</p></main><footer style="margin-top: 2rem; background: #0001; padding: 2rem; text-align:
