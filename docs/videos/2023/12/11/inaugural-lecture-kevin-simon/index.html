to welcome you to<br>the inaugural um lecture uh by Dr Kevin<br>Simon um titles uh lessons from Invaders<br>I first met Kevin about 30 years ago<br>this week actually um while he was<br>completing his master's degree at<br>Virginia Tech um at Virginia Tech he<br>also completed his uh PhD and from there<br>we got married and moved to denen where<br>he took a postto at University of atago<br>uh that's the first time we've came to<br>New Zealand um following that he's uh<br>had um academic positions at James<br>Madison University and the University of<br>Maine at<br>Oro um to be honest this is about the<br>first time I've seen a lecture from<br>Kevin in about probably 20 years so I'm<br>quite curious uh to hear what he has to<br>say and see what he's been up to um over<br>the over well<br>20 years or so anyway thank you and I'll<br>p<br>no America Huna Kev<br>TOA no tenot tenot<br>tenoa uh thank you all for coming this<br>evening and thanks for that introduction<br>hopefully um what I talk about will be<br>different from what I talked about 20<br>years ago at my last sem my wife saw um<br>I wasn't entirely sure what I wanted to<br>talk about today but what I thought I'd<br>do is walk through um a series of um<br>Invaders that I've worked with over the<br>course of my career talk a little bit<br>about what I've learned from working<br>with these um but also talk about what<br>I've learned from um the amazing<br>collaborators and people that I've<br>worked with over the course of this time<br>so we'll just go uh straight into<br>it the first Invader that I started<br>working with um This was um when I was<br>at postto were brown<br>trout those of you that fly fish here<br>may know know brown trout they're native<br>to Europe but they've just been<br>distributed uh all around the world uh<br>including here and this sort of chapter<br>is a little bit about my what I call my<br>research Papa so my my lineage and<br>and the notion of lineages in um doing<br>research but also um how you Mentor like<br>a cowboy this journey started with James<br>Ardell Ule um so he brought the first<br>brown trout over from Europe to Tasmania<br>in 1864 so there was a lot of interest<br>in trying to move salmon in particular<br>but also other salmonids from Europe uh<br>into the colonies so that people could<br>fish for them and there were lots of<br>failures but eventually they figured out<br>how to how to manage to do it and so<br>they were first moved uh from Scotland<br>to<br>Tasmania they then were moved from<br>Tasmania to New Zealand in<br>1867 by Andrew men Johnson and they were<br>moved to um these ponds in Canterbury uh<br>in Christ Church by the acclimatization<br>Society there uh they later moved down<br>to aago Charles Clifford was the person<br>responsible for this they moved down<br>around 1868 to 1869 they were hatched<br>and then distributed out and so<br>essentially the colonists brought these<br>things with them to try to recreate the<br>old world and the acclimatization<br>societies um that existed then still<br>exist now you would know them as New<br>Zealand fishing game and so they still<br>they still sort of<br>exist we Flash Forward to 1989 Colin<br>Townson invaded from the UK and took up<br>a position at the University of atago um<br>and Colin was my postto uh adviser and<br>so I moved to New Zealand for my postto<br>and I started to work with these trout<br>um with Colin and when I showed up um<br>off the plane basically Colin said right<br>so you've read the Marsen proposal what<br>do you want to do I like okay well would<br>do this I might change this I might<br>change that and he's like great go for<br>it and he set me loose and I realized<br>later on that that was kind of how all<br>of my advisers were all of my mentors<br>were um over time and to sort of<br>illustrate what this is really like I'm<br>going to use an example so how many of<br>you ride horses anybody how many of you<br>know Mark Todd right so anybody that's<br>an English Rider sorry I'm going to<br>offend you here for a moment but um so<br>this is Sir Mark Todd and a horse called<br>Kil turbid rap CID and so he's doing a<br>Dr pattern here and so if you watch Sir<br>Mark ride<br>this rins are tight legs are on the<br>horse he's really sort of driving this<br>horse through this pattern and it's<br>amazing what he and this horse can do<br>but if you think about how he's working<br>with this horse this is not what Colin<br>was like this is not what any of my<br>advisers were like over time and so this<br>is impressive but you see him he's<br>holding him he's using his hands using<br>his legs really driving this horse okay<br>okay<br>um so this is more this is more like<br>what my mentors were and so this is a<br>horse named swervin and her her cowboy<br>named Jesse<br>Lennox I'm guessing none of you ride<br>cutting horses right and so this is a<br>little bit of a different ball game and<br>so what's going on here is that<br>swervin and his Cowboy need to go into<br>this pack of calves they need to<br>separate out one calf and keep it<br>separate from the others for a period of<br>time and what I want you to do is just<br>watch how Jesse works with this horse<br>right so he's giving him a bit of<br>guidance we're going to find the calf<br>that we want to cut out from the<br>herd right and now we've got them<br>separated and what does Jesse do<br>completely drops the rins he's along for<br>the ride so the horse is on its own<br>doing its thing right this is my mentor<br>these were my mentors right they were<br>Cowboys um if you saw any of them and in<br>fact if I called any of them a cowboy<br>they'd probably be upall um but that's<br>how they mentored me so they gave me a<br>bit of direction and cut me loose and so<br>um I started out studying cave systems<br>as a grad student and and so I did that<br>because uh Horton Hobs was my adviser<br>when I was an undergrad he was a cave<br>biologist took us on a field trip and I<br>thought wow these are cool can I do a<br>research project on cave animals and<br>Horton's like sure go for it turn me<br>loose let me go I went on to grad school<br>did my Master's Degree with art Bika as<br>my<br>Master's adviser and then Fred Benfield<br>here as my PhD adviser and I wanted to<br>work in cave systems and understand how<br>the ecological systems in caves work and<br>they said sure go for it let me do it<br>that picture is my I think second<br>committee meeting those are my<br>supervisors for my PhD and so Fred and<br>art and Jack and Dan and Dave so I<br>hauled them in about an hour and a half<br>crawling into a cave to my field site so<br>we could have a meeting so those of you<br>who who um you know think about your PhD<br>supervisors I don't know how many of<br>them would actually do that with you but<br>um they said sure go for it and they cut<br>me loose and as part of my PhD I also<br>worked with Janine jaabir um she's um<br>was a head of a lab in France uh she did<br>a lot of really cool work in in cave and<br>carst ecosystems and I sent Jenine a<br>letter on paper we didn't have email<br>then so this is the first time in this<br>talk I'm going to date myself wrote her<br>a letter Professor jar you do really<br>cool research can I come send a year<br>with you and she wrote back and<br>said and said away you go and so all<br>these people just sort of cut me loose<br>and and away we away we<br>went um but if we go back to this story<br>with Colin um I showed up and started<br>working on on trout with Colin but I was<br>not the first person to do it I was part<br>of a lineage of people that focused on<br>this fish and built the story about<br>these Invaders over time and so the<br>first person that worked on this was col<br>was called was Todd crra and Todd<br>surveyed streams down on the south<br>island around the atago region down<br>around the Tyrie River Basin and um<br>basically everywhere he sampled fish he<br>found either a stream that had native<br>fish in it or he found a stream that had<br>trout very rarely would you ever find<br>them coexisting and so this was the<br>first demonstration that when these<br>trout show up they tend to displace the<br>native fish and you either see trout or<br>you see natives the places that you see<br>natives oftentimes are left up in<br>tributaries above barriers and so this<br>is a covert going under a road we've got<br>a waterfall that's me Downstream of this<br>you've got trout Upstream you've got<br>native fish where the trout can't get<br>because there's a barrier and so the<br>populations get<br>fragmented the second person that worked<br>on them uh was Alex<br>flecker and Alex was interested in sort<br>of the ecological consequences of this<br>invasion of these these trout and he did<br>some experiments where he manipulated<br>the presence and absence of the Native<br>fish and trout and he looked at the<br>community responses so he looked at<br>invertebrates and algae in these systems<br>and the picture in the middle tells the<br>story essentially if you go to a stream<br>that has Trout the stream's quite green<br>it has a lot of algae in it the reason<br>for that is in part because when trout<br>come into a system they suppress the<br>abundance of invertebrates through<br>predation they reduce the number of<br>grazers and that releases the algae then<br>to grow in those<br>systems same things happens with the<br>native fish but not to the same extent<br>so Colin used to call this a trophic<br>Cascade native fish causing it's called<br>the trophic Trickle and so this is a<br>general Paradigm in in<br>ecology the notion that an organism at<br>one level in a food chain influences not<br>only the thing next to it but also<br>cascading through those systems and so<br>it's sort of a linear chain in which<br>trout come into a system they higher<br>biomass they suppress the abundance of<br>grazing and vertebrates and that allows<br>the algae to to<br>increase there's more to that story<br>though and that's this part of the story<br>came from Angus MacIntosh and during his<br>PhD Angus was interested in these sort<br>of Predator prey interactions and he<br>looked at the behavior of the little<br>animals that graze the algae um in the<br>streams and he found not only do trout<br>suppress their abundance but they also<br>change their behavior and so if you look<br>in a system with Native fish you'll find<br>these little May flaws on the surfaces<br>of rocks grazing those alal films during<br>the day and also during the night if you<br>put trout into a system the mayflies<br>move and hide under the rocks to avoid<br>predation and spend less time on the<br>surface of the Rock grazing those algae<br>down and so now we're looking at changes<br>at the level of an individual where we<br>see behavioral shifts in response to<br>these invadors coming in the next person<br>in this lineage that looked at them was<br>Alex hin and Alex extended this to the<br>ecosystem level and looked at rates of<br>primary production so rates of<br>photosynthesis in systems and how energy<br>moved through higher levels of the food<br>chain and so he found that yes we see<br>higher rates of photosynthesis in<br>streams so more energy being fixed in<br>those streams that have trout where<br>there's more algae he saw differences in<br>how energy is partitioned in moving in<br>amongst higher trophic levels the<br>productivity of the of the animals above<br>it and then I showed up so I was kind of<br>the last in this this lineage that<br>worked on these um these fish with Colin<br>um and I was focusing on how nutrients<br>move in system in response to uh<br>invasion of these these fish and so to<br>do this we looked at two different<br>streams the one on the left uh has trout<br>these are tributaries on the kyber river<br>the one on the right has native fish<br>because there's a waterfall that's<br>prevented the trout from moving moving<br>up into<br>it and so we went into these systems and<br>we added a stable isotope Tracer so we<br>added a particular form of nitrogen to<br>the system that we could track as it<br>moved through the food chains and<br>through the stream system so we used a a<br>nitrogen 15 pumped it into the stream<br>over the course of 35 days and then<br>tracked where that nitrogen moved<br>through the food web within those<br>systems and there were a bunch of people<br>that helped me uh do this along the<br>along the<br>way so ordinarily if we think about<br>biological systems we think about<br>nutrient Cycles so nutrients exist in an<br>inorganic form like nitrate for example<br>it gets taken up by algae or plants<br>moves through food webs and organic<br>forms and then eventually gets<br>mineralized through decomposition and<br>turned back into an inorganic form so<br>nutrients cycle inorganic to organic<br>inorganic to organic and round and round<br>they go in streams those Cycles are<br>placed into Spirals and so when it's in<br>inorganic form like nitrate that<br>nitrogen's moving Downstream in the<br>water column in which it's dissolved<br>until it's taken up and then held in the<br>the organisms on the bottom of the<br>stream and then it's released and<br>spirals Downstream again and so the<br>length of those spirals if any of you<br>played with a slinky when you were a kid<br>pull them out put them back together<br>indicate how tightly that system holds<br>on to nutrients and Cycles them within<br>them and so we measured this with those<br>Isotopes and we found that if if you<br>look at a stream with Native fish your<br>typical nitrate atom is going to go<br>about half a kilometer down stream<br>before it's grabbed onto by the<br>organisms and held eventually<br>mineralized and released for another 500<br>meter jump as it went down if you go to<br>a stream with trout those spirals are<br>only about 50 60 M so they're in order<br>of magnitude shorter and it's because we<br>have much more uptake by those algae<br>hanging onto this and so nutrients are<br>much more tightly cycled within those<br>within those systems and they also<br>change where Nitro ends up partitioning<br>within those entire food webs and so in<br>a trout stream most of the nitrogen is<br>being held in these alal films at the<br>sake of nitrogen that's going into other<br>organisms within the stream and so these<br>Invaders change how nutrients partition<br>within a system what we end up with as a<br>story that talks about the effect of<br>these Invaders within a system and we<br>realize that their effects span every<br>level of ecological organization they<br>change how individuals behave they<br>change how populations are laid out on<br>the landscape they change how<br>communities interact through predation<br>and arbiv within systems and they change<br>how everything from energy to nutrients<br>cycle within systems and this sort of<br>remains one of the the few Invaders that<br>have been studied across all those<br>ecological organ organizations to sort<br>of build this coherent story of what<br>what goes on and again it was done by<br>having a lineage of people that sort of<br>worked on this topic over over<br>time chapter 2<br>so after my PhD or after my postto I<br>moved back to the States and I moved up<br>to the state of Maine which is waying<br>the northeast corner of the United<br>States and I ended up working with<br>another invasive species there and these<br>are these are white<br>perch they're not perch they're actually<br>bass they're native to the coastline the<br>upper Coastline um of the United States<br>all the way up into the very bottom tip<br>of Canada and so you'll find them in<br>catchments all along here native they<br>move back and forth between between the<br>oceans sometimes they stay resident in<br>in lakes and rivers um but they've been<br>moved around a lot and the first<br>movement of them came when the first<br>European Colonists came to the United<br>States so they relied heavily on these<br>things and also stripe bass which are<br>very closely associated with them as a<br>food source and so they started moving<br>these fish around from places where they<br>they were to places where they<br>weren't that continued all the way up<br>through the 50s 60s 7s as people started<br>moving these fish around for sport so<br>they're they're good to eat they're fun<br>to catch and so people started moving<br>them around to systems where they'd like<br>to fish for them so same story as as<br>trout they also started moving because<br>people started building canals and and<br>irrigation connections between lakes and<br>rivers and so for example they made<br>their way into the Great Lakes through<br>the eie canal and systems that were dug<br>to facilitate transport of ships through<br>these systems and so you now find them<br>spread all out across the um across the<br>US they cause a lot of Applied problems<br>so they out compete other fish um in our<br>case we're focusing on their<br>relationship with um water quality and<br>this is a sort of a story of taking a<br>bit of a disaster and applied ecology<br>and making some some lemonade out of uh<br>um The Story by looking at Evolution um<br>but also the notion that when Invaders<br>come into systems they actually are<br>likely to change and the notion that<br>there ecological systems that they're<br>going into aren't linear systems how<br>many of you know this movie okay this is<br>the second time in this lecture that I'm<br>going to date<br>myself On Golden Pond Peter Fonda<br>Katherine<br>heurn they both W Oscars for this so<br>it's excellent movie it's a story about<br>uh an aging couple and every summer they<br>would go to a lake in New England and<br>they would spend their summer on this<br>Lake Peter Fonda is an aging Professor<br>showing the early stages of dementia my<br>students and my son are laughing at me<br>at the moment it's like ah sounds<br>familiar um but it's a story about um<br>him and his wife and his connection to<br>their daughter so Jane Fonda bought the<br>rights to this and and did this movie<br>with her dad she's the the daughter in<br>the story with it she shows up um with<br>the son of her boyfriend um and it ends<br>up that Peter Fonda's character makes a<br>connection with this boy um in part<br>through fishing and they're fishing<br>through a fish called Walter um who is<br>this legendary John fish that um Peter<br>Fonda's character's been trying to to<br>catch<br>okay but this phenomenon was was common<br>for a lot of people in this area and so<br>if you go to New England um there are<br>all kinds of lakes and especially if you<br>go to Maine and so the the person who<br>wrote this uh story spent his Summers on<br>a place called Great Pond uh in Maine<br>and it's part of What's called the<br>Belgrade Lakes of Maine and so people<br>would have their batches on these Lakes<br>they would spend their Summers on the<br>Lakes their deep connections with<br>between the people and these systems<br>these lakes that they're um that they<br>they live on and spend their and spend<br>their Summers<br>on there's also a ton of money involved<br>in these as well and so if you love your<br>children a lot and you want to get rid<br>of them for the summer you send them the<br>summer camp on a pond in Maine in this<br>case Camp takaho which is on Long Pond<br>which is right next to great Great Pond<br>the the original Lake for this story for<br>the Tidy sum of about $166,000 for a<br>couple months right so there's there's a<br>lot of cultural importance for these<br>Lakes but also economic importance um in<br>maintaining these systems okay so you're<br>going to send your kids off to summer<br>camp you're not going to send them to on<br>green polluted Pond right and so if this<br>is your your batch on this Lake you're<br>not happy if the lake looks like this<br>and so It suffers the same problems that<br>we see here development in the<br>catchments lead to nutrients going in<br>these systems and algal blooms uh Within<br>These Within These lakes and so this was<br>happening in the Belgrade lakes and in<br>particular was happening on a place<br>called East Pond which is just North of<br>the On Golden Pond uh place okay and the<br>main Department of Environmental<br>Protection thought okay how can we fix<br>this problem well we're going to do it<br>by biom manipulating the system and<br>we're going to do it by removing white<br>perch from that Lake okay and so they<br>removed 10 tons of fish in 2007 and then<br>they continued that every year through<br>2012 right so they trapped netted they<br>Gil netted the fish they hauled out all<br>of these fish from the lake with the<br>idea that it was going to change the<br>lake from being green to being clear<br>again and so here are the Lakes so East<br>Pond was the lake that was having the<br>algal bloom they established a reference<br>Pond next to it North Pond so Mana<br>called these ponds they're Lakes they're<br>big systems right they're not small<br>they're not small systems right so they<br>set this up they measured water quality<br>and Z planting a bunch of stuff in the<br>lake from 2004 through 200 6 before they<br>started and then they did the<br>manipulation and kept measuring it<br>afterwards<br>okay as soon as they started this the<br>main D the people there published this a<br>main success story here's what we're<br>doing so it was touted as a success from<br>day one which made all the scientists<br>nervous they did this okay and so um<br>it's pretty interesting situation to to<br>be in the reason that they did this was<br>that they thought about that trophic<br>Cascade idea right and so North Pond<br>which is next to it didn't suffer as big<br>of aggo blooms and the<br>rationale was that that Lake had<br>invasive northern pike which are a v<br>voracious pisor they eat other fish if<br>you look at East Pawn the green one had<br>had a lot more white perch they were<br>presumably reduced in the clearer Pond<br>by the pike right which then reduced the<br>grazing pressure on zo Plankton the<br>little Z Plankton would Bloom eat down<br>all the algae and maintain a clear lake<br>so basically what they were trying to do<br>is act like a pike so we go in we reduce<br>the white perch we allow the Z Plankton<br>to thrive and they mow down the the<br>Plankton so here are the results for<br>this and so what I'm showing you is um<br>sucy depth which is a measure of water<br>Clarity so this was was first done by<br>Petro<br>angeloi uh in 1865 it is a highly<br>complex device comprised of a black and<br>white plate you put it over the boat you<br>lower it down so you can't see it it is<br>amazingly close to the 10% light level<br>in a lake and extremely consistent and<br>easy to use so it's a fantastic way to<br>measure Clarity of a lake the amount of<br>algae in a lake over time okay so the<br>data that I'm showing you are that<br>Clarity and so East Pond the one that<br>had the algal blooms is in green and you<br>can see these are late summer excursions<br>where they get big Alo blooms and the<br>water Clarity just declines so you Chuck<br>this thing over and you can measure it<br>maybe a meter or two down in the water<br>and you can't see it anymore okay so<br>quite green okay so measured it for<br>several years now what we're going to do<br>is mow down all the perch and you tell<br>worked<br>no short story short if anything it got<br>worse over time we actually started<br>seeing more excursions of low water<br>quality within that system and so it was<br>not a success story it was in some<br>respect an unmitigated disaster and the<br>reason for this was that we didn't have<br>a linear chain in this system we had a<br>tangled web of organisms interacting<br>when they took out the perch they use<br>Gil Nets and remove the big perch well<br>it turns out that the big perch eat the<br>little perch which actually eat The Zo<br>Plankton they also eat things like<br>yellow perch crappie other animals that<br>feed on these they also eat Al wife<br>which is another fish that is a a mega<br>consumer of Zo Plankton and so when they<br>took them out all we got was more small<br>fish more Alewife fewer Z Plankton and<br>more algae in this system and so this<br>notion of a trophic Cascade a linear<br>chain doesn't apply in the situation<br>it's a much more diffuse kind of system<br>okay so that's the lemonade or that's<br>the lemons um when we looked at these<br>things um we also started looking at<br>them across a bunch of different lakes<br>and so this is work done by Quinton<br>Tucket who was a PhD student at the time<br>and a colleague Mike Kennison who I<br>worked with and Mike was an evolutionary<br>biologist and a fish ecologist<br>um and so Quenton started looking at<br>these fish and we were looking at white<br>perch across systems that kind of range<br>from Clear Water Systems to Green highly<br>utopic highly productive systems<br>right ordinarily when we think about<br>Evolution we think about it as a really<br>slow process so here's a a quote from<br>Darwin we see nothing of these slow<br>changes in progress until the hand of<br>time has marked the long laps of Ages we<br>usually think of evolution as something<br>that happens on the order of centuries<br>to thousands of of years Millennia right<br>ecological processes happen on short<br>time frames yearly decadal type systems<br>but we now know that actually Evolution<br>can happen on much shorter time frames<br>and we kind of thought about this<br>Clinton went out sampled a bunch of<br>lakes and he said man these fish don't<br>look the same in all these lakes and so<br>here's a here's an example so here's<br>Unity Pond and here's Coldstream pond so<br>do those fish look the same or do they<br>look different to you<br>right same species those are both white<br>perch but they look pretty different<br>much deeper body right downward looking<br>eyes and mouth right dramatically<br>looking different fish well it turns out<br>that Unity Pond and Coldstream Pond were<br>both pretty clear back in the late '70s<br>but Unity Pond became polluted nutrient<br>enriched in green over time and so these<br>were fish that were in a system that<br>changed over relatively short periods of<br>time and we start to see what looks like<br>major differences in the uh in these<br>fish so Quinton went in sampled a bunch<br>of lakes across Maine that Spann a<br>gradient of sort of this trophic State<br>um and he when he went in and looked at<br>them it turns out that we can predict<br>the shapes of these fish very well by<br>looking at that simple measure of sui<br>dep so how productive is a lake measured<br>by L Clarity does a very good job of<br>predicting the overall shape of these<br>fish and so Unity Pond and old stream<br>Pond are sort of two ends of this<br>spectrum but we can see that sort of<br>trophic change that that morphological<br>change in these fish across these<br>gradients and so the the the physical<br>traits of these organisms are responding<br>to the the ecological state of the<br>system that they go in we see that in<br>their body shapes we can look at<br>individual features we can look at over<br>overall body shape we also see it in<br>their body chemistry how much nitrogen<br>phosphorus they hold in their bodies how<br>much nitrogen phosphorus they excrete um<br>and release into into systems so it<br>links not into just their physical shape<br>and how they might feed on other<br>organisms but how they cycle things like<br>nutrients for example so ecological<br>processes so that was sort of a a<br>transition in thinking about these<br>Invaders I started off thinking about<br>them as well what's the ecological role<br>of these animals and systems by working<br>with a an evolutionary biologist and a<br>really clever PhD student who made a<br>pretty interesting observation um we<br>started thinking more about these<br>Invaders In terms of um models for<br>evolution and how evolutionary change<br>can um alter these Invaders but also<br>alter what they do in these these<br>ecological systems and so this brings us<br>to sort of the third chapter in this<br>story and this is work that I started<br>doing um after I arrived here in<br>Auckland and we've done a bunch of work<br>um looking at these little fish called<br>mosquito fish gambo aanus this is the<br>Western mosquito<br>fish they're native to sort of the the<br>south central part of the United States<br>but they've been distributed all over<br>the planet now and so you'll find them<br>on every C on every continent with the<br>exception of<br>Antarctica and so we've started using<br>them as sort of models to understand how<br>Evolution plays into um a variety of<br>issues um but they're also kind of a a<br>really fascinating story about um<br>Invaders and so what do colonists<br>Communists and Red Cross have in common<br>I'll answer that question in a moment<br>but this is the native range here in the<br>sort of tan color these are places in<br>the states in which they've been moved<br>and in particularly they've been moved<br>out to California um where I have a<br>colleague that's that's worked there<br>that we've we've done a ton of a ton of<br>work with and so they've been moved<br>within the US they've been moved all<br>over the the planet in a variety of<br>places how many of you know this<br>guy anyone ever heard of Simon<br>Stewart why do people move fish right<br>the colonists moved trout when they came<br>to America or they came to um uh New<br>Zealand and Australia colonists mov fish<br>when they came to the United States they<br>move white perch around right so we have<br>trout and all the trout and salmon that<br>we have here were were moved by the<br>acclimatization societies we have lots<br>of other fish as well so we have things<br>like perch tenens and rud so fish that<br>are more similar to those white perch<br>that I talked<br>about the primary reason that you see<br>these fishes widely distributed as due<br>comes down to this single guy um who it<br>turns out was originally from the UK as<br>a kid he would fish for things like rud<br>and tench and perch which are called<br>coarse fish and they're called coarse<br>fish because the wealthy people would<br>fish for trout the poorer people would<br>fish for things like perch tension rud<br>which have scales they're bony they live<br>in places that aren't so clean and<br>pristine as as trout wood so there's<br>very much a class distinction between<br>these coarse fish and<br>trout and so he moved to New Zealand he<br>was also a communist and so part of the<br>reason that he was moving these fish was<br>a way of sort of class Warfare he felt<br>that people shouldn't only be able to<br>fish for trout the wealthy people but<br>the common people should be able to fish<br>for these fish as well and so he took an<br>old garage over in West Auckland he<br>built fish rearing facility he modified<br>his Ute so that he could take these fish<br>and drive around and spread them he<br>raised these fish and then<br>single-handedly spread them over a large<br>chunk of the north the north island so<br>this single person is responsible for<br>moving most of these fish follow the QR<br>code there's a absolutely fascinating<br>podcast that describes this guy<br>okay mosquito fish weren't one thing<br>that oved though okay and so mosquito<br>fish have a fascinating history with<br>humans they were first discovered back<br>in the late<br>1800s they were thought of as kind of<br>like these marginal little uninteresting<br>guppy likee sort of fish but then it was<br>realized later on that well these things<br>tend to eat mosquitoes and so they have<br>these upturn mouths and they tend to<br>feed on mosquito larv and so their<br>initial interest for a lot of people was<br>primarily as a way of mosquito control<br>and so how do we control things like<br>malaria for example mosquito born<br>disease<br>and so people started coming up with the<br>notion that well maybe we can use<br>biological control to control these<br>mosquitoes by taking these little<br>gambusia and spreading them around and<br>so things like the Rockefeller<br>Foundation the Red Cross were<br>instrumental in taking these fish and<br>distributing to these places on the<br>planet largely for mosquito control so<br>colonists move fish Communists move fish<br>and the Red Cross moves fish people move<br>fish all over the planet for lots of<br>different different reasons and the fish<br>the invasive fish that we see here have<br>come here for all those various<br>reasons it turns out that these fish not<br>only there was a lot of interest in them<br>in terms of mosquito control as we moved<br>into the 1970s people started becoming<br>more interested in sort of the the<br>ecological effects of things like you<br>know things like Rachel Carson's work uh<br>stimulated the the appreciation that<br>maybe moving these fish around is a bad<br>thing and there's recognition that these<br>fish actually had a lot of negative<br>impacts where they moved and so they've<br>been called various names including<br>gambusia the fish Destroyer plague<br>minnos right lots of of sort of terms<br>recognizing that when they invade<br>systems they become very prolific and<br>cause cause lots of problems later on<br>they've become sort of a model in<br>science for looking at a lot of<br>different sorts of processes and it<br>turns out that trophic Cascade stuff<br>that I started talking about initially<br>one of the first demonstrations of<br>trophic Cascades was done with mosquito<br>fish by Stuart hbert in<br>1972 and so he did an experiment in<br>which he put mosquito fish in the system<br>and recognized that trophic Cascade and<br>so these fish are actually intimately<br>linked back into that sort of basic<br>ecological sort of question well how did<br>they get here it turns out that the<br>mosquito fish that we have in New<br>Zealand their faka papa goes back to<br>Texas so they moved from Texas they were<br>taken to Hawaii where they were bred and<br>distributed they were then taken from<br>Hawaii and moved to New Zealand around<br>1930 and so this is a an article from<br>1928 the New Zealand Herald so a war on<br>on breeding grounds of mosquitoes will<br>shortly be waged in Auckland through the<br>Enterprise of Dr TJ Hughes District<br>medical officer of health and so he's on<br>this ship called the<br>marama and he's got a kerosene tin<br>containing about a hundred of these<br>special gambusia apinis and the the plan<br>is to transfer them and releasee them to<br>control mosquitoes to reduce problems<br>like malaria for example those mosquito<br>fish were established in the Auckland<br>domain any of you have been to the pond<br>next to the cafe over in the domain<br>Ground Zero for mosquito fish invasion<br>in New Zealand right next door to to us<br>it's where they brought them and the way<br>they went and they've been since<br>distributed um we've done a lot of work<br>with these little fish some of it has<br>focused on sort of what they do<br>ecological effects I'm not going to talk<br>so much about that um fin Lee for<br>example George Perry and I co-advised<br>Finn during his his master's degree and<br>Finn showed that essentially when we we<br>create Farm streams agricultural streams<br>and agricultural systems we create ideal<br>conditions for The Invasion by these<br>fish so agriculture essentially<br>facilitates the invasion of these fish<br>within within<br>systems okay what we were really<br>interested in using them for was trying<br>to understand things related to Thermal<br>change and climate change and if you<br>look at most of the ecological work that<br>focuses on climate change what people<br>typically do are take<br>organisms they warm them up they measure<br>the outcome and they say okay that's<br>what's going to happen with climate<br>change right so basically what they do<br>is take today's animals they put them in<br>tomorrow's climate to try to figure out<br>what goes on but we know that Evolution<br>can happen on short time frames maybe<br>what we need is tomorrow's animals in<br>tomorrow's climate so we can figure out<br>what's what's going on it turns out the<br>these little things fish both in<br>California and in New Zealand have<br>invaded geothermal systems and so we can<br>find populations of these fish that have<br>invaded systems everywhere from about 19<br>to 38 Dees C all within the last 100<br>years or so and so we've got replicate<br>populations across geothermal gradients<br>temperature gradients that we can that<br>we can focus on and so we decided to use<br>these as sort of models for um for<br>Change and so the populations in<br>California are in the Owens Valley which<br>is an a valley adjacent over from Death<br>Valley uh in California this work was<br>really spurred by Dave frickel he did<br>this during his PhD Dave eventually came<br>and was a postto over here and so Dave<br>really sort of built uh This research<br>and Eric palac was his adviser who was a<br>postto for Mike Kennison the guy I<br>worked in in Maine with at one point and<br>so I knew I knew Mike there those fish<br>in California were introduced in the 20s<br>from Texas so they Papa back to<br>the same place that the mosquito fish<br>from not only do you find mosquito fish<br>in these systems you also find goldfish<br>so these are all systems out in the<br>desert so you four-wheel drive out you<br>find a pond in the desert and you'll<br>find things like goldfish um this is a<br>different story their drinks afterwards<br>you can ask me about the bizarre stories<br>related to goldfish in these systems as<br>well if you want<br>to in New Zealand um this work was<br>really done by Emma Moffett and so Emma<br>was doing her PhD about the same time as<br>Dave and so so they started working in<br>Tandem and we sort of tore them loose on<br>this project and let them let them roll<br>on it and so she worked in geothermal<br>systems from starting down around<br>Miranda they're the hot pools down there<br>and then down in through Rotorua toppo<br>sort of area so we had a variety of<br>geothermal systems that Spann a gradient<br>um that we could we could focus on one<br>of our more interesting sites was this<br>one um which is on the side of a nudus<br>colony and so we would go in Sample and<br>there'd be curious naked people working<br>with us also a story for drinks<br>afterwards if you want to have a chat<br>with that happy to talk about what it's<br>like to do fieldwork with nsts what were<br>we kind of focusing on when we did this<br>and so if we think about climate change<br>it's going to be a warmer world in the<br>future but also we expect organisms to<br>be smaller and so it's considered sort<br>of universal response that as we warm<br>systems up body sizes tend to go down<br>okay and so temperature and body size<br>are inex extric linked and so we were<br>focusing on using what's called<br>metabolic theory of ecology to try to<br>address this and without going into the<br>Gory details too much on this metabolic<br>Theory suggests that if we look at<br>metabolic rates of organisms it scales<br>with body saws so bigger animals have<br>bigger have higher metabolic rates but<br>it doesn't scale equally it scales at<br>3/4 power and so metabolic rate doesn't<br>rise completely equally with body SIU so<br>basically large animals<br>have lower metabolic rates per unit mass<br>than small animals do right so small<br>animals are more metabolically<br>inefficient this scaling 3/4 power<br>scaling holds across kind of everything<br>so a variety of different tax them<br>metabolic rate if you normalize it for<br>Mass also scales with temperature<br>consistently across lots of different<br>organisms and so this notion that there<br>are these Universal scalings between<br>metabolic rate and body saws and<br>temperature have often been used to do<br>things for example predict change in the<br>future with with warming and so we say<br>well there's a universal response of<br>metabolism relative to body size in the<br>future we can make predictions<br>everywhere from lower ecological levels<br>to whole ecosystems based on this<br>metabolic Theory okay sometimes been<br>called the metabolic Theory of<br>Everything people argue over it so what<br>did we do we went out and measur<br>metabolic rate of these fish and all<br>these different populations at different<br>temperatures if you think that's not<br>interesting you can ask the year three<br>students in my sister's class we showed<br>up I showed up in her class with these<br>things in the states and we measured<br>metabolic rates of the fish and in fact<br>it was the most funnest day ever for<br>those kids I think the next day was<br>pizza day and that's a planted fish day<br>but that was that was all right so and<br>so what did we find and so we went out<br>to each of these populations we measured<br>metabolic rate across different body<br>sizes of organisms and we measured that<br>slope and it's supposed to be 3/4 power<br>for for everybody so it should be 75 for<br>everybody and in fact it's not that<br>allometric slope between metabolism and<br>body size actually changes as we change<br>temperature and it actually drifts<br>upwards and so essentially what happens<br>as we warm systems up that relationship<br>between metabolism body size gets closer<br>to one: one so the metabolic penalty of<br>being small kind of goes away you're<br>just the same as a bigger a bigger<br>organism we did find that metabolic<br>rates go up with temperature so if we<br>look at metabolism versus temp<br>temperature we find that it goes up this<br>is an uranous plot with this bizarre<br>backwards plot of temperature that's why<br>it's done but it doesn't go up nearly as<br>fast as what metabolic Theory would<br>suggest and so actually they're far less<br>temperature sensitive than this Grand<br>Theory would suggest that they actually<br>are<br>okay we do find that body size goes down<br>and so we look at the size of males and<br>females as we go across this temperature<br>gradient we mow off the big individuals<br>from these populations so body size goes<br>down but we're not seeing things like<br>metabolic rates changing in response to<br>temperatures we'd<br>expect is that<br>Evolution right it could be two things<br>it could be plasticity so a single<br>genotype that can lead to different<br>phenotypes different physical features<br>metabolic features of these organisms<br>when you put them in different<br>conditions or we could have actual<br>genetic differentiation in these<br>populations the only way to do that is<br>through what's called common Garden<br>rearing and so Dave did an enormous<br>amount of rearing where he took fish<br>from eight of these populations across<br>the temperature gradient he reared each<br>of them at five different temperatures<br>over time and so if you take these<br>different populations you rear them all<br>at the same temperature if they are<br>still different we know they're<br>genetically different if they're the<br>same then we know that actually it's a<br>single genetic signature that can give<br>us different physical and physiological<br>responses and it turns out when he did<br>this um we saw pretty strong evidence of<br>genetic evolution in these fish and so<br>these are growth rates of these fish at<br>five different temperatures each column<br>of plots on here is a different<br>population so there's our<br>19° population at 19 celus 23 26 29 and<br>31 and so if you look at this generally<br>growth rates go up with temperature so<br>we warm them up they grow faster which<br>is what we would expect but they go up<br>faster for the cooler<br>populations and so if we look at any<br>given temperature if we look across that<br>temperature gradient of those<br>populations it does the reverse of what<br>you would think this is called counter<br>gradient variation essentially evolution<br>is fighting against what you would<br>expect to see in this system and it<br>turns out that you see lower growth<br>rates higher reproduction at small size<br>and so we have an evolutionary basis for<br>why organisms get smaller in these these<br>systems so we we've found an<br>evolutionary basis<br>for jav benavente is part of her PhD<br>looked at metabolic rates of these fish<br>and the same sort of system and it turns<br>out that all the different populations<br>respond the same way they show that<br>change in the scaling of met metabolism<br>with body size so in this case it's<br>plasticity single genetic signature<br>giving us different outcomes in the<br>environmental systems the interesting<br>thing was that if she looked at these<br>fish big fish are far more sensitive in<br>terms of metabolism versus temperature<br>little fish are not very sensitive to<br>change in temperature at all and so we<br>end up driving towards smaller fish<br>through Evolution and fish that are less<br>temperature sensitive and so this story<br>we end up with sort of a mix of<br>evolutionary downsizing this sort of<br>plasticity in how metabolism responds<br>across different sizes of organisms the<br>end result is you don't get what<br>metabolic theory of ecology would<br>predict at all and it's because<br>Evolution and plasticity play into this<br>sort of sort of<br>question I told you there only be three<br>chapters but I'll give you a hint at<br>chapter four do you remember<br>Walter right the fish that Peter Fonda<br>and Billy were trying to catch it was a<br>rainbow trout right and so this there<br>are no rainbow trout in Great Pond<br>they're rainbow trout in the lake where<br>they actually filmed the story and the<br>fish was taken from a fish farm and<br>stuck on the hook and then they they<br>called it so they focused on rainbow<br>trout and we've actually started doing a<br>bunch of work now trying to focus on<br>rainbow trout so rainbow trout are also<br>in New Zealand they're famous down<br>around toppo and so we've been focusing<br>on the fish down there they were they're<br>they faka Papa back to Santa Cruz around<br>Santa Cruz California and so Eric has<br>worked with the original populations of<br>these fish and it turns out that there's<br>a super Gene so a collection of genes<br>that determine whether these fish stay<br>in a stream their whole life or whether<br>they pack up and head to the ocean or<br>they pack up and head to a lake and<br>finish their life and so we've been<br>doing work kind of looking at that sort<br>of super Gene and do we see genetic<br>control of how these fish play out their<br>life histories and what are the<br>ecological consequences of this sorts of<br>of things so a big thanks to a ton of<br>postgrads who have worked on this I<br>think I'm more Mar Todd than a cowboy<br>but I<br>try got to embarrass my<br>family that's<br>it</p></main><footer style="margin-top: 2rem; background: #0001; padding: 2rem; text-align: center;"><p>We Are
