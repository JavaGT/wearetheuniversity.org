This may seem out of our hands, but there some are surprisingly easy things we can all do to combat our personal food waste. Maddie Crang talks to Miranda Mirosa, Sheila Skeaff, and Phil Bremer from the Food Waste Innovation research team at the University of Otago.<br><br>This podcast was created by Maddie Crang, as part of an internship for the completion of a Postgraduate Diploma in Science Communication.

accurate.</p><p>you know is it food wasted it's a huge<br>issue it's estimated 40% of all food<br>that is produced is is<br>wasted and that's a problem for one<br>thing because we put a lot of resources<br>into growing food so therefore those<br>resources technically are lost<br>the other impact on food wasas in the<br>environment is when it goes to landfill<br>gases food waste is becoming one of our<br>most pressing issues almost 40% of our<br>lands are taken up by crops yet we waste<br>a around a third of everything we<br>produce at the same time many of us are<br>experiencing financial difficulties just<br>from our weekly Supermarket shop it<br>feels out of our hands like we're just<br>waiting through mounds and mounds of<br>rotting vegetables and moldy bread when<br>I had the opportunity to talk to<br>Professor Miranda morosa Professor<br>Sheila SCH and Professor Phil brimer of<br>the food waste Innovation research group<br>at the University of otago my most<br>precent question was can we even do<br>anything about this<br>yeah absolutely and which I think is<br>it's what makes it really challenging<br>because it means that we need to get 5<br>million people on board we've all heard<br>of the things we need to do as<br>individuals to help combat climate<br>change Take 2 minute showers but make<br>sure the water is freezing eat<br>vegetarian or vegan or maybe don't even<br>eat at all bike to work or school and<br>these unprecedented weather conditions I<br>thought that food waste would be full of<br>the same unrealistic expectations but I<br>came away with some surprisingly easy<br>and quick solutions that we can all use<br>waste one of the issues with wasting<br>food is like um we all eat often and and<br>and food is often wasted in sort of it<br>um in in small quantities and so we're<br>not often even sort of aware that it's<br>happening in fact the food waste in a<br>group has only just got a grant to once<br>and for all figure out how much food our<br>country wastes at an individual level<br>the task is more straightforward it's<br>easi as placing all food scrapped into a<br>separate bin or bag and being aware of<br>how much waste you individually create<br>it's shockingly easy but it works one<br>study found that cognitive factors such<br>as being aware of waste and its<br>consequences positively affects food<br>waste behaviors and so one of the things<br>they've just trial they've just tried<br>something in palmon north where they<br>gave everybody a bin to put their food<br>scraps in so they could separate out the<br>food scraps from what they were sending<br>to landfill and people were like I'm<br>amazed at how much food waste I had I'm<br>going to reduce it we're going to do<br>this they're going to compost it have a<br>worm farm whatever so that's great so<br>aware um but the reasons why<br>at household level that that people are<br>wasting food uh we we really simple like<br>we buy too much if you've been to the<br>supermarket when you're hungry you'll<br>understand you boy those sorts of things<br>you don't you don't necessarily intend<br>to hunger is controlled by hunger<br>hormones one signals that your stomach<br>is empty and the other signals when it's<br>full walking to a place filled with food<br>with that hunger hormone alerting in<br>your brain probably means the first<br>thing you will see will be going into<br>your car and then into your stomach<br>and it doesn't just happen with food<br>either hungrier Shoppers have been found<br>to spend 64% more than those who weren't<br>hungry even on non-f food items we tend<br>not to plan plan well in terms of you<br>know sort of um it's rather sort of<br>management to food and shopping if that<br>makes sense we we don't many of us don't<br>plan our our week's meals end up buying<br>too much we only cook we cook too much<br>sometimes um we don't sort of if we've<br>got if we're following a recipe and we<br>end up with half a ton of that we didn't<br>need for that recipe a lot of people<br>don't actually have the um one either<br>desire or two the the knowledge to be<br>able s improvise and make something from<br>that you know make something from the<br>the leftover ingredients so what can be<br>done to combat this first eat before<br>going shopping in any capacity have a<br>meal or a snack secondly walk into a<br>supermarket with a plan it could be<br>either a detailed list of every meal<br>that week<br>or maybe just an idea of a couple things<br>you would like to cook either way you'll<br>be saving money and combating the<br>potential to waste food if you're<br>feeling even fancier plan meals around<br>using up leftovers like that half a can<br>fridge well they store it in correctly<br>so they don't give the food a chance so<br>they take their carrots and put them in<br>the fridge and they dry out you heard<br>that right folks stop putting carrots in<br>the fridge food waste and nutrition is a<br>filled Rife with misinformation and<br>unfortunately a lot of that surrounds<br>Child Life practices but fridges are<br>often very dry environments so they pour<br>moisture from the carrot and your carrot<br>goes all floppy and horrible if you had<br>that carrot and a atite container when<br>it with a paper tail on it would last a<br>lot longer because it wouldn't lose the<br>the moisture from the carrot would go<br>into the Container would form an<br>equilibrium and then it doesn't lose any<br>moisture this got me thinking what are<br>the foods am I and I'm sure many others<br>storing the wrong way the first one was<br>milk my milk always stays in the door of<br>the fridge but this might actually be<br>causing it to spoil faster every time<br>the door opens your milk is being<br>exposed to fluctuating temperatures<br>promoting bacteria growth the best place<br>for it is in the back of the<br>fridge and finally we're all storing our<br>fruits wrong as a fruit matures it<br>releases a gas called ethylene which<br>signals to the fruit that it should<br>start ripening the flish softens sugar<br>content Rises and the flavor of the<br>fruit deepens this gas is also released<br>after the fruit has been harvested so it<br>can wreck havoc on shelf life if not<br>stored<br>properly basically fruits are divided<br>into two categories climacteric fruits<br>like apples and bananas ripen after<br>harvest and they experience a peak of<br>ethylene accelerating the ripening<br>process non- climateric fruits like<br>grapes and strawberries are harvested<br>when fully ripe and they don't get the<br>same peak of ethylene therefore storing<br>climateric and non- climateric fruits<br>together means that the ones that are<br>already ripened may go rotten faster as<br>they're exposed to more ethylene you can<br>also use this to your advantage putting<br>an unright piece of fruit in a paper bag<br>with banana could get you the perfect<br>bite in a few<br>hours so one of the things that tends to<br>happen because people don't want to hang<br>around for when it's time to have<br>seconds they might fill up their plate<br>okay quite big um and then they can't<br>finish it so that's a problem much of<br>our food waste occurs in institutions<br>like schools University halls and<br>hospitals a lot of this is down to<br>behavior change consuming food in an<br>environment that you're not used to<br>often leads to you creating behaviors<br>you would not normally have in your own<br>home when they come from home where food<br>is not routinely wasted or you can put<br>leftovers in the fridge and go back and<br>get them later which is quite different<br>than living in a hostel often the food<br>in the hostel was being wasted and they<br>just started to waste food so their<br>behavior changed to accommodate what was<br>normal in the host to put that wasn't<br>normal for them at home well many of us<br>are not living in these institutions<br>these ways of combating food waste Canim<br>be used pretty much everywhere some of<br>the hostels what they've done is they've<br>reduced the size of the plate okay<br>that's a very simple way of of actually<br>getting people because you can't fit<br>that much on a plate so that can<br>work this idea is called nudging making<br>a change to the choice environment but<br>not removing any choices it can either<br>be done by changing Behavior at the<br>decision-making stage without alerting<br>the decision maker like altering plate<br>sizes or placing water at eye level inad<br>of fizzy drinks or promoting a change in<br>how the decision is made like running an<br>education campaign one University in<br>Illinois tested this Theory by switching<br>from round plates to over ones that had<br>less surface area and then measuring the<br>food selection consumption and waste<br>using the oval plates students waste the<br>20 G less food per plate which when you<br>take into account the thousands of<br>plates being used every day it most<br>up one of the things that's been propose<br>is that no green waste ever go off a<br>property I don't know how practical that<br>is if you're in an apartment so I think<br>that's very I mean okay for if you have<br>a house and a garden and all your green<br>waste assistant I think that that that's<br>an interesting concept um I think that<br>if we<br>could yeah just the further ways of<br>sharing food that we have that we don't<br>need food waste is an issue that has<br>always stood out to me as it is usually<br>talked about in such a technical way we<br>need plant cellulars in place of plastic<br>and aerobic respirators using food waste<br>meet grow in a lab but it's such a human<br>issue we are the only beings to create<br>food products and turn food into a<br>commodity maybe the ultimate solution is<br>to build up our communities have people<br>we can share food and knowledge with I<br>would love to see more community<br>building around this particularly in<br>neighborhoods I think that's what we<br>need more human contact more ideas more<br>sharing I really that's if I my<br>unlimited dream with regard to food<br>would be that we would have people who<br>are great gardeners roaming the streets<br>on the weekends helping people who<br>aren't good gardeners and you know<br>little Community hubs where people can<br>get together and share food and make<br>food and and maybe we just need to<br>respect our food more ask yourself where<br>is our meal growing how did it get to me<br>what impacts is this meal and its waste<br>heav on others in the environment so I<br>guess every little uh change that you<br>can make to your consumption Behavior<br>eating behaviors shopping behaviors um<br>will make a difference and and I guess<br>um it starts but all of us doing doing a<br>bit and I find that really empowering<br>because you know some of these other you<br>know it's really hard to solve energy<br>you know issues and for you know this is<br>something that you know three times a<br>day all of us can sort of actively<br>participate in being part of this<br>empowering so there you have it five<br>surpris ly easy things that you can do<br>to combat your personal food waste be<br>aware of what you waste eat before going<br>to the supermarket store your food<br>correctly use a smaller plate and create<br>a food Community around you if we all<br>did these five things we would change<br>the future of food waste in<br>aloa I would like to extend a big thank<br>you towards Miranda Sheila and Phil for<br>taking the time to be interviewed and<br>spreading a win of food waste around<br>aloa I would also like to extend thanks<br>to guyre dck for your support in<br>creating these
