font-size: 0.8em">Transcripts may be automatically generated and may not be 100% accurate.</p><p>I was a musician before I was a surgeon<br>and the very first time I walked into an<br>operating theater what I noticed was<br>that the surgeon put on music and for a<br>calming effect I had an interest in<br>human factors in surgery and of course<br>music so the fact that someone was using<br>music for purpose in the setting was<br>really interesting to me yeah so the<br>questions that are often raised with<br>music is that surgeons generally think<br>that well they generally enjoy it and<br>they generally think that it's a<br>positive effect in the operating<br>environment so it improves the mood<br>reduces anxiety reduces mental fatigue<br>but uh there are some people who really<br>don't like music it's quite a<br>controversial topic and there are some<br>who feel that it can impair<br>communication and increase<br>distractability so we found by and large<br>there's little evidence in this area uh<br>particularly with the effect of Music on<br>surgeons stress U we felt that most<br>people do enjoy music and do think it's<br>a positive influence though some people<br>really don't um we found that it's a bit<br>too difficult and probably not feasible<br>to get result looking at a<br>Interventional study in the clinical<br>environment and we found that out from<br>our pilot field study um and this year<br>what we've found is we've been able to<br>create stressful situations for surgeons<br>um and at the moment we're in analysis<br>phase but the preliminary results um a<br>suggest of that music doesn't imp or<br>improve their stress response but we're<br>doing the final analysis so I was<br>encouraged by my parents from very young<br>to play music and I started with the<br>recorder uh followed by the clarinet but<br>currently I mostly play um the alto<br>saxophone I finished 5 years of medical<br>school and I really wanted to do<br>something different and I went to study<br>Jazz at the New Zealand School of Music<br>in Wellington Victoria University um and<br>I also studied South Indian classical<br>CTIC music and that really gave me a a<br>large amount of exposure to to music and<br>musicality um which I really took with<br>me when I went back to complete medical<br>school</p></main><footer style="margin-top: 2rem;
