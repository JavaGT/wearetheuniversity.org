a compassionate<br>person<br>you<br>tonight you are being honored by people<br>from the academic world and from the<br>medicine Ki we of the Mari Community<br>have turned up as<br>it is our dearest wish to acknowledge<br>you to support you and to thank you<br>also we thank you for choosing medine as<br>your line of work we thank you for the<br>care you have given to thousands of<br>people throughout your working life we<br>thank you for choosing to live here in<br>central atago so that we may benefit<br>from your skill and from your hearing<br>knowledge I know that you will have<br>treated thousands of people and I don't<br>expect you to remember me but I I<br>remember<br>you I have been one of your<br>patients<br>we're also very grateful that you have<br>chosen a topic data Mari Hearts which is<br>inequality you are seeking to find the<br>reasons for inequality in the health<br>system so that a pathway may be found<br>for<br>equality the word in equality is very<br>sensitive for Mary we baffle inequality<br>on a wide range of fronts and it is<br>widely known that we do so<br>so when someone from outside our<br>community chooses to take up the Cel and<br>fight on our behalf or with us we are<br>very grateful Mar have a faki a proverb<br>this if the teeth are huge the jaw must<br>be the size of a<br>on it is common with Mary wisdom that<br>the meanings are often very obscure but<br>what it's really say is that for a great<br>Enterprise to<br>succeed we need or the person needs<br>great wisdom and great experience and<br>Gary we think you have enormous tee and<br>tream to the STA of dunon<br>Hospital<br>Koto it is difficult for us to find the<br>words to thank you you've chosen a<br>job in which you work you keep our<br>Hospital open and you work<br>to look after our<br>people it is work which is confronting<br>and stressful it is work which is<br>demanding and I imagine it is often<br>heartbreaking you see daily probably the<br>worst and the best of people and you<br>truth the and what is the most important<br>thing it is people<br>it is people it is people I'd like to<br>leave you with a proverb that you can<br>fire the treasures of life and if you<br>falter let it be before a<br>l<br>nor<br>hpal<br>to<br>up<br>to<br>Kahari p and to translate that was the<br>call of the century look left and look<br>right and I reckon that Gary has been a<br>century for us for quite some time my<br>job tonight is to help keep things<br>moving along get the right people to the<br>right place at the right time and I need<br>to say these things in the unlikely<br>event of an<br>emergency there's a door there there is<br>a door through the kitchen out the b and<br>if you would follow our staff they will<br>tell you where to go the toilets are at<br>the back<br>um<br>Malo<br>toao and warm Pacific greetings and<br>greetings to everybody who is seeing<br>this because this event is being live<br>streamed and recorded so now we're going<br>to hear some interesting things and I'm<br>ready for you Helen Nicholson who is our<br>words<br>Nicholson<br>toak my name's Helen Nicholson and I'm<br>the acting Vice Chancellor as Jamie said<br>and it's my great pleasure to welcome<br>you here on behalf of the university to<br>this very special occasion to celebrate<br>the promotion of Gary Nixon to professor<br>and thank you for putting on such a<br>beautiful day for us all to drive down<br>across to you I'm delighted that the<br>inaugural professorial lecture can be<br>here held here in erns glue so that<br>friends and family and members of the<br>community can be here to listen to<br>Gary's journey to<br>Professor I'd like to welcome you all<br>this evening to those here in person and<br>also those watching via the live stream<br>but I'd like to give a special welcome<br>to Gary's wife arene Sister Evelyn and<br>brother-in-law Robert nieces Anna Abby<br>and nephew Joshua and a number of Gary's<br>friends who have traveled long distances<br>to be with us this<br>evening so many of you will know Gary as<br>an outstanding rural doctor but to<br>become a professor at<br>ataro we have we put our colleagues<br>through a various um things and they<br>have to jump a few hurdles to show that<br>they are um worthy of being given the<br>title of professorship<br>so they also have to show outstanding<br>competence and leadership in research<br>teaching and<br>service and as Professor Baxter is going<br>to tell us shortly Gary has clearly<br>demonstrated this in his research which<br>focuses on health outcomes and improving<br>Health Services for Rural communities<br>communities his teaching to<br>undergraduate and postgraduate students<br>and his role as director of the post<br>rural postgraduate program in the past<br>and his service both to the medical<br>profession and to The Wider<br>Community congratulations Gary on your<br>well-deserved promotion we're very<br>fortunate to have you as part of the<br>atago<br>Faro um it now gives me great pleasure<br>to introduce Professor Joe Baxter who's<br>the dean of the denan school of medicine<br>who will give a formal introduction to<br>Professor Nixon Nora tenot tenot<br>ten<br>for<br>well everyone and this a huge um<br>privilege and honor to have been asked<br>to come here today and to introduce<br>Professor Gary Nixon I firstly before<br>introducing Gary wish to acknowledge<br>mana and our for the wonderful welcome<br>uh to this community and also to the<br>community who has made this a wonderful<br>place to come and do an I um so just a<br>little bit um about myself and<br>introducing Gary because I'm the dean of<br>the denan school of medicine and I've<br>been in that role for about a year and a<br>half but prior to that I had an<br>associate Dean role in the division of<br>Health Sciences and so I've had a a<br>privilege of walking alongside Gary um<br>both with different copaa I was focused<br>on how do we Champion Marty Health how<br>do we grow and develop<br>those things and Gary was walking<br>alongside a pathway for Rural health and<br>we often intersected and so my first um<br>I suppose acknowledgement of of Gary is<br>um that he is someone who has<br>unwaveringly been passionate and<br>committed to rural health so I always<br>know that if I've had a a meeting with<br>Gary that he will be really clear there<br>will be an outcome for um his community<br>for Rural health and he wants to have a<br>conversation about it so I do want to<br>firstly acknowledge you Gary as a friend<br>and colleague and someone who I have<br>immense uh respect for um so a bit about<br>Gary and our journey with him as a<br>university so Gary started as a rural<br>Hospital generalist in Dunston in<br>1992 um and obviously worked very<br>strongly um as part of the community<br>here but then you've had to share him<br>with the University of oo from about<br>2005 onwards and you may have been<br>wondering what Gary was up to heading<br>off um well he has slowly but surely<br>taken uh rural Health from a very small<br>part of our medical curriculum and a<br>small part of our imprint to something<br>that is spread across the country so uh<br>he has been become the professor and<br>head of section for Rural health and<br>also was the associate Dean for Rural<br>health so working<br>strategically Gary has been a prolific<br>academic uh so you often hear about<br>people's research and I have been Amazed<br>by the level of amazing research that<br>Gary has done but also his capacity to<br>form teams with people all over the<br>country in big and small places as he<br>nav Ates the kinds of research that's<br>going to make a real difference for<br>Rural health so his research does focus<br>on outcomes and ways that he can improve<br>services for the kinds of communities<br>that he has served over his years uh so<br>some of his earlier research was about<br>point of care diagnostic Technologies<br>including things like ultrasound and lab<br>testing how do we make sure that tests<br>happen for everyone but in more recent<br>times he's been part of a group of<br>researchers who have developed a new<br>tool to actually make sure we have<br>robust measures about who is rural and<br>um how do we better understand access to<br>services and of course acknowledging his<br>focus on Equity uh Gary has a number of<br>students um some of them in the rural<br>Hospital GP training program but he also<br>has postgraduate<br>students um so without further ado<br>I wish to uh acknowledge you Gary um<br>before handing over to Gary I do want to<br>thank you as a community and as a Health<br>Service for your contribution to lending<br>us Gary for those times you can be very<br>uh proud of what Gary has been achieving<br>I know as the dean of the medical school<br>I am so can I welcome you Gary you're<br>going to be talking about on Solid<br>Ground rural health and out your door<br>New Zealand so<br>welcome<br>uh thank you to those that have traveled<br>to get here and welcome to this dry<br>fertile Inland<br>Basin place is really important in rural<br>Health to the to the north is high hi<br>leaning Rock on the Dunston mountains to<br>the South is caai the old man range and<br>behind you the everpresent river Mata Al<br>the<br>cluther thanks also to the locals that<br>have come along I'll do my best but this<br>may not be the most entertaining event<br>you've been to In The N<br>hor and finally welcome to those<br>watching remotely our University team<br>has distributed over more than 20 rural<br>communities and zooms our<br>medium I've looked at a few of these<br>events online and will follow the<br>standard pattern providing some<br>biographical detail then then a a<br>research my dad was from the English<br>Scottish borders a descendant of Border<br>reavers you can Google that he<br>immigrated ated in vagle in the early<br>1950s with his when his uh World War II<br>unit which had been kept on as part of<br>the army of occupation in Germany was<br>finally demobbed the passage in Vago was<br>still free in those days dad was a<br>painter and paper hanger with a strong<br>Northern English sense of social justice<br>and labor<br>politics M was descended from Loland<br>Scott weers who traveled to Port<br>Charmers in the late 1840s moving to<br>inago when my grandparents walked off<br>World War I ballot farm near Clinton in<br>the<br>depression mom was a seamstress she<br>pretty much made every Stitch of<br>wore including dressing us up and<br>competitions so you have it evidence<br>that the impeccable dress sense that's<br>been the Hallmark of my entire<br>career<br>start<br>okay that's in the memory of Lor<br>mcnorton who kindly brought it to work<br>one day after visiting my godparents<br>that<br>photo<br>okay when we were quite small mom and<br>dad bought one of the old rower houses<br>in Millis flat which become the family<br>home and and where they retired to it<br>was there we spent large chunks of our<br>childhood and the swimming pool in the<br>summer and for me walking the long trap<br>lines in the hills with the rabbiter who<br>lived across the<br>road EV and I went to South scholand in<br>Vago then I went on to boy High which at<br>the time felt like my first promotion<br>and biked across inago every day the<br>winds blow from the north every morning<br>afternoon I wanted to be a wildlife<br>service officer at school but when I<br>told the school Ker adviser that he<br>pointed out that those jobs were really<br>hard to get quite<br>competitive I'd good marks maybe I<br>instead sometimes I've been a bit<br>envious of those who've done that sort<br>of work and there's quite a few of in<br>this in this room who do but I don't<br>regret it doing medicine was probably<br>the best decision I'd ever<br>made those first years at med school and<br>den Eden were exciting but unsettling<br>including the springwalk tour<br>at times times I guess I think I thought<br>I'd gone to New York when I was in Den<br>Eden I withdrew at the end of third year<br>and went traveling alone over land from<br>Europe back to New Zealand and what was<br>a much less connected<br>world I I uh I worked out that denen<br>wasn't New York and and returned to Mid<br>School the following<br>year I came to dunon hospital for the<br>first time in<br>1984 as a fourth year medical student<br>with Alan Clark professor of surgery for<br>a Surgical Clinic the weather was bad so<br>we drove rather than<br>flew I remember a few things the food<br>was very<br>good dunon hospital was larger than<br>Roxboro<br>hospital and in the car on the way home<br>Prof Clark gently needled the registar<br>about completing his Doctorate which<br>seemed a bit pushy to me at the<br>time now I understand where he was<br>coming<br>from the regist by the way was Andre<br>vanro who would be the next professor of<br>surgery when we got to Roxboro proph<br>suggested we call and to see my folks in<br>m flat so Professor Clark sat in front<br>of the co range at home and at a cup of<br>tea with<br>Mom I didn't say a word but she and the<br>professor seemed comfortable enough<br>chatting away which once surpris those<br>of you in the room who remember remember<br>my<br>mom in fifth year I did my 5 weeks GP<br>attachment into aery with Dr<br>Alder Eric aler had started the aior<br>World War I he was revered in medical<br>circles considered by many to be the<br>father of general practice training in<br>New<br>Zealand but as Trevor says it's the<br>patient that teaches the medical student<br>the supervisor's job is merely to keep<br>them both safe while it<br>happens not that I didn't learn a lot<br>from Eric but the to taery patients<br>didn't hold<br>back teaching me me teaching me what<br>they thought I needed to know by telling<br>doctor one story involved him getting<br>involved him getting his car stuck in<br>the sand on Blue Cliff's Beach when he<br>was on his way to roow Allen Township to<br>do a house<br>call he was universally recognized as a<br>terrible<br>driver he knew he had just to wait he<br>had had to just wait till the end of the<br>day when the workers would come out of<br>the roow Allen Forest he spent the time<br>working out a complicated plan to<br>extract the car when the workers<br>appeared he explained to each of them<br>what their role would be they listened<br>politely and when he was finished<br>without saying a word walked over to the<br>car picked it up and carried it over and<br>sand the was a lot to take<br>in what sorts of knowledge are actually<br>the most<br>important who was really looking after<br>whom in that<br>Community about words and action and the<br>nothing I done my o OE so my intern<br>elective was an opportunity to have a<br>summer close to those feldland mountains<br>which I did in Tiana with Trevor Walker<br>eventually doing GP training with David<br>Cook and a wacker and back in central<br>tago with Dennis<br>mentors after a climbing trip to Canada<br>in 1991 arene returned with me she was<br>on a visitor's visa and I needed a job<br>so I applied to an advert for a medical<br>officer post at Dunston Hospital<br>initially during the hospital where the<br>workforce needs were greater at the time<br>and some general practice and later in<br>ened by Pat fer combining it with<br>University<br>work in 1998 as part of the health<br>reforms those ones not the current ones<br>the local Crown Health Enterprise<br>decided to pull out of central ataro<br>handing the hospital and related<br>Services over to the community to<br>run I'm sure they just thought that it<br>would fold taking it over was a<br>Monumental task for all concerned I mean<br>getting involved in the wider Health<br>Workforce and Health Systems issues that<br>impact act way more than we may want on<br>local<br>Services hence the management teaching<br>and<br>research like other doctors or like<br>other rural doctors and nurses physio<br>X-ray and lab staff Etc I'm a generalist<br>which means turning your hand to to<br>anything a bit of Cardiology a broken<br>bone a sick kid of a sey at the end of<br>the<br>day and this research is similar it<br>ignores the discipline boundaries and<br>encroaches on everyone else's<br>territory there are frequent calls to<br>specialists in town for advice and a lot<br>of teamwork in fact most of this is the<br>work of others notably the gch team Dave<br>blanner Rory and I recently listened to<br>this woman Marlon fles speak at the<br>Royal medicine Australia conference<br>Marlon is an academic psychotherapist<br>who practices and teaches the politics<br>of power privilege and feminist ethics<br>to medical students in the rural stream<br>of the world's northernmost Medical<br>School the Arctic University in Thro<br>Norway it' be good if the world's<br>southernmost medical school also had a<br>rural<br>pathway although it's being worked<br>on Marlon and Eric Alder probably sat at<br>different points on the rural health<br>professional<br>Spectrum but I suspect they would have<br>got on quite well<br>Marlin's research research focuses on<br>the attitudes and sensibilities those<br>working in large Urban healthare systems<br>and universities have towards their<br>rural colleagues some think she very<br>narcissism more recently though she's<br>she has been examining the differences<br>between urban bioethics which can be<br>quite process and rules driven focusing<br>on the relationship between the health<br>profession and the individual patient<br>and Rural bioethics which she considers<br>more pragmatic more about doing what<br>needs to be done more outcome and<br>Community<br>focused most of all she says it's about<br>being<br>useful so I'm hoping that the principles<br>of potato ethics which she talks about<br>um you what you'll use when you judge<br>this<br>work I think Northern Norwegians are as<br>cleen on um good potatoes as what<br>southlanders are<br>but I also wonder if there's a few other<br>areas in Modern Life that I couldn't do<br>ethics most of this all cover with a<br>pretty light brush but I'll go into one<br>study um in a bit more depth it was<br>important because it helped us realize<br>that we had to deal with our own<br>problems and couldn't just always rely<br>on the expertise from<br>town when I was at Dunston Hospital the<br>management of heart attacks was changing<br>rapidly when you have a heart attack a<br>cholesterol plaque sitting in one of the<br>arteries that supply the heart muscle<br>the coronary artery ruptures you can see<br>it here if you look closely at this<br>video there it<br>goes and blood blood plot forms that can<br>go on to block the<br>archery there didn't used to be much we<br>could do about this nothing we could do<br>to unblock the archery and had to accept<br>the down that the downstream heart<br>muscle would lose its blood supply and<br>die but in the early 1990s a new drug<br>appeared that could dissolve the clot<br>supply the drug was made out of the<br>strip to caucus bacteria strep strep<br>causes tonsilitis and importantly<br>rheumatic fever but it also causes<br>cellulitis that spreading skin infection<br>we treat pretty<br>frequently the reason it can do this is<br>because it makes an enzyme<br>that allows it to move through the<br>tissue called<br>strepto and it's this enzyme that was<br>harnessed and used to dissolve the blood<br>plots it was highly<br>effective but it but it's made from<br>bacteria because of this it really fires<br>up the immune<br>system patients would frequently come<br>out in a rash start vomiting drop their<br>blood pressure and feel pretty lousy<br>just what you don't need when you're<br>having a heart<br>attack and despite the side effects we<br>would keep the infusion going going<br>life-saving a few years later newer<br>synthetic drugs that didn't have the<br>same side effects come<br>along but they were very expensive and<br>with few exceptions we had to keep using<br>the older<br>drug karty and I become aware that<br>things were happening differently in the<br>city hospitals they were using the new<br>drugs more frequently and were starting<br>to open the archery mechanically by<br>using a catheter it was starting to feel<br>a bit un<br>fear there was another problem with<br>strepto conas many predominantly Maly<br>rural communities have high rates of<br>strep infections as evidenced by the<br>high rates of rheumatic fever and<br>therefore therefore likely High antibody<br>level levels including antibodies to<br>strep<br>toino antibodies that can quickly mop up<br>the drug and render it<br>ineffective importantly we knew that the<br>effectiveness of strepto had never been<br>tested in these sorts of<br>communities so in an effort to justify<br>getting our hands on the new expensive<br>drugs we set out to measure the strepto<br>antibody levels and patients admitted to<br>our small hospitals with heart<br>problems<br>okay this was easier said than done for<br>start there was no commercial assay to<br>test for strepto antibodies so we had to<br>get the immunologists and Den Ed and to<br>make one this was actually Dave uh Dave<br>Finley's<br>brother-in-law don't worry I don't<br>understand this slide either but I think<br>it involves using goat antibodies to<br>antibodies we found a big<br>difference this is a little bit hard but<br>it's a logarithmic scale so levels at<br>the top of the scale are a thousand<br>times higher than they are at the bottom<br>more than a third of the patients in the<br>hokianga had very high antibody levels<br>much higher than a much higher<br>proportion than in central of<br>tago these Northern rural communities<br>should have been the first to get these<br>new drugs not the<br>last nowadays we e we use even newer<br>generations of fontic drugs but in many<br>Pacific Islands but many Pacific Islands<br>still rely on strip toin despite having<br>other things were H happening as part of<br>this change in heart attack management<br>we'd already published a paper<br>suggesting if we work closely with<br>tedian cardiologists heart attack<br>patients admitted to Dunston hospital<br>had good<br>outcomes but a study comparing another<br>southern hospital and denan<br>appeared about 12% of patients admitted<br>to Denon had died a year after their<br>but the death rate for the smaller<br>year there is actually a good news story<br>here wall has helped precipitate the<br>routine collection of National Data and<br>a Cooperative effort over many years to<br>prove care for Rural patients involving<br>the city cardiologists two of whom in<br>Den needen a South and farm boys which<br>may have been helpful along with those<br>of us working in rural areas and<br>educating young rural<br>doctors Rory published a study earlier<br>this year using this big<br>database these are the chances of<br>survival up to six years after a heart<br>attack now the red line is patients<br>admitted to a rural<br>Hospital the first few days which is<br>sort of up<br>here the fishery days are are still<br>pretty dangerous but a lot safer than<br>they used to be<br>but most importantly the lines almost<br>overlap there's effectively no<br>difference in survival if you're<br>admitted to a rural hospital or admitted<br>directly to A cardiology unit in the<br>city um at the end of a year and only a<br>small difference after that which<br>probably likely has other<br>causes this isn't what we expected in<br>other countries there is still a<br>considerable difference in survival<br>between rural and urban patients who<br>experience a heart<br>attack it doesn't mean we can't improve<br>things these same studies still show<br>rural patients are waiting longer for or<br>not getting some investigations and<br>treatments overall though in the case of<br>heart attacks the poorer rural outcomes<br>have been identified and processes put<br>in place to fix<br>pattern in New Zealand it has been<br>assumed until recently that for most<br>things there is no significant<br>difference in health outcomes between<br>rural and urban populations and there's<br>no need for targeted rural Health<br>policy the statement was um taken from<br>the executive summary of one of the two<br>major reports into the health of rural<br>new<br>zealanders this has never made sense to<br>me of was working in rural it was not<br>what we were seeing day to day and it<br>differed from what was known in similar<br>countries<br>overseas we're also aware of some<br>inconsistencies between the two reports<br>for example this<br>report concluded that rural people were<br>disease and the second report<br>concluded that Urban people were more<br>opposite one day sitting in Dave's<br>living room after a bike<br>ride he pointed out that these two<br>contradictory findings were based on the<br>same data the<br>2002 National Health<br>survey the only thing that was different<br>was the definition of rural and urban<br>the authors has used he was right and<br>further exploration revealed almost 30<br>different ways of defining rural in the<br>New Zealand Health literature none of<br>which really made sense look like we<br>couldn't believe anything anything in<br>reports some some of these definitions<br>classified places like ham the springs<br>is<br>urban and most the 10 acre blocks on the<br>edge of large cities our riches<br>rural sorting this out demands skills<br>that you don't develop treating patients<br>in CDE expertise in health geography M<br>health data management and bio<br>statistics the research team that has<br>evolved has been enduring and great to<br>work<br>with the results a novel Urban rural<br>classification called the geographic<br>classification for health or gch which<br>divides all of New Zealand into two<br>categories the gch has started to paint<br>a different picture of the health of<br>rural new zealanders the dotted line<br>here represents the mortality rate for<br>different age groups living in the large<br>cities U1 so anything above this line<br>means the rural mortality rate is higher<br>urban as you can see younger rural<br>people have M are much more likely to<br>die in a given year than the urban<br>peers up to twice as likely for the<br>youngest living in the most remote<br>those of you who are over 65 may look at<br>smug rural mortality rates in your age<br>group are lower than they are in the<br>cities but this might also be<br>incorrect when elderly rural people<br>become frail and unwell they often shift<br>to the city to be closer to to care and<br>this migration may be responsible for<br>research the urban Ro disparities are<br>even larger for what we call amenable<br>mortality that's a group of deaths that<br>are potentially preventable with timely<br>Care<br>okay this is<br>important but it's also very important<br>to keep it in<br>perspective these differences are much<br>smaller than the Mari non-mi inequities<br>in New Zealand which worryingly seem to<br>be exacerbated by<br>rurality this graph represents mortality<br>rates across the gch separately for Mari<br>and for<br>non-mi the equity Gap is considerably<br>larger in our most remote<br>communities<br>here than it is in the<br>cities<br>here Mali are also more likely to live<br>in rural areas and more likely to be in<br>the younger age groups whose health is<br>rurality the gch has been rap rapidly<br>adopted by Tatu AA and the Ministry of<br>Health forming the basis of the recent<br>strategy the gch also has potential to<br>tell us about Equitable access to<br>services for example despite having<br>higher mortality rates we can tell that<br>rural people are much less likely to<br>access Hospital services in a given<br>year the reasons for us who live uh who<br>live really are pretty<br>obvious in this small<br>study done by Dave he he he sat with<br>patients waiting for an outpatient<br>appointment at Dunston hospital and<br>worked out the cost if that had to<br>travel to denen for the appointment<br>including time off work travel and<br>accommodation the average cost was over<br>$700 for service that would be almost<br>free for a denean patient and that was<br>ago and thinking how we can reduce that<br>travel and improve access we've tended<br>to concentrate on improving local<br>diagnostic<br>services Diagnostics are important<br>because they're often the gateway to<br>treatment and the rest of the Health<br>Service improved technology has also<br>created opportunities and it's now<br>possible to provide tests in rural areas<br>past Studies have included looking at CT<br>scanning cardiac exercise testing and<br>point of care<br>testing these handheld devices were<br>designed for use in intensive care units<br>and can do a range of blood tests within<br>minutes it was obvious that they would<br>have a role in rural communities without<br>a local medical laboratory where blood<br>test results would would take a day or<br>back and another was ultrasound which<br>was becoming portable impossible for<br>doctors to use at the<br>bedside but to get these Technologies<br>accepted it was necessary to prove that<br>they are are safe and make a genuine<br>difference to Patient Care that is not<br>just an expensive<br>toy this was done by comparing<br>information about the presumed diagnosis<br>and planned management before the doctor<br>did the test and after they completed<br>the<br>test as an as an<br>example this represents the probability<br>that the doctor thinks that the<br>diagnosis they are considering is the<br>right one if 100% that means there's<br>certain of it if zero then it's ruled<br>out as you can see before the ultrasound<br>most of the time was around 5050 a<br>tossup they're very<br>unsure apologies if uh some of you think<br>it's pretty alarming to see how<br>practice but once they have the<br>information from the scan this changes a<br>lot and they are much more confident<br>that the diagnosis is correct or<br>unlikely when assessing a patient we<br>have a range of options up here from<br>discharging them home right through to<br>organizing a helicopter to take them to<br>base Hospital these are high stakes and<br>high cost decisions for both the patient<br>and the Health Service so we were<br>interested in how these tests altered<br>these<br>decisions now this is a this is a heck<br>of a<br>figure some young guys at Boda<br>scientific and Alexandra made these for<br>me and I was actually even surprised the<br>journal printed<br>it um don't been trying trying to<br>interpret it what you need to know is<br>that these bold colored lines in<br>here are where the ultrasound has<br>changed patient management and the shift<br>in the bar to the right means that the<br>management was less intensive in<br>particular more patients could be safely<br>discharged but for few patients the<br>lines went in the other direction they<br>went to the left resulting in more<br>intensive<br>treatment point of care ultrasound has<br>continued to grow and we now have a<br>large teaching program that sees memore<br>Hospital Emergency Physicians amongst<br>skills point of care testing uh can also<br>have a positive impact on job<br>satisfaction for Rural doctors as out<br>the lined in this paper by uh by cardi<br>Ward because the costs of point of care<br>tests because point of care tests can be<br>a bit less accurate than those done in<br>the main laboratory knowing that safe is<br>also really important<br>good example of this is the blood test<br>to detect a heart<br>attack this necessitated in create<br>creating a whole rural chest pain<br>diagnosis pathway and then Rory<br>undertook a large trial involving over a<br>thousand patients to prove that it was<br>effective the downstream savings to the<br>health system and the patient completely<br>swamped the costs associated with these<br>point of care Technologies and I'm<br>surprised that been uh picked up more by<br>central government to support rural<br>general<br>practice a study undertaken in the kumu<br>region of Nepal also relied on point of<br>care<br>testing stomach ulcers are common and<br>stomach the predominant cancer in this<br>region a bacteria called hpylori is is<br>known to be associated with these<br>diseases but there's no local medical<br>labor or way of testing for h pylori in<br>the kbu that is until the Chinese<br>started producing a simple point of care<br>test using a feal<br>specimen which we used to determine the<br>local prevalence of hpylori by<br>collecting samples from 384 individual<br>individuals and randomly assigned<br>households only one person failed to<br>provide a<br>specimen the prevalence was one of the<br>highest recorded anywhere over 80% of<br>children were positive and would carry<br>it with them their whole lives<br>cancer but that's actually not the<br>reason I went to<br>Nepal the Himalayan trust was supporting<br>young doctors through mid school only to<br>have them leave and head to the city and<br>they were worried about losing another<br>one a common<br>problem I got to know sharing really<br>well including the doing the study<br>together and I did my best but in in the<br>end he headed to km do to be become a<br>specialist like the<br>others it seems that the more country<br>needs ryal generalist doctors the<br>Specialists Rory published a small New<br>Zealand study emphasizing the importance<br>of generalists to rural Healthcare<br>earlier this<br>year he followed patients who were<br>transferred from six rural hospitals to<br>the base hospital and worked out whether<br>or not they had had an investigation or<br>a treatment surgery for example that<br>could not have been provided locally<br>that is did the transfer which is<br>expensive and inconvenient for patient<br>and patients and the houseal system<br>proved to be<br>necessary the length of the Blue Line<br>represents the proportion whose transfer<br>in the end was clearly<br>Justified despite real hospitals coming<br>in all shapes and sizes the results were<br>surprisingly similar it would even be<br>100% we need to ER on the side of<br>caution but over 80% of patients ended<br>transferred but there was one<br>outlier only 37% of transfers from that<br>hospital were clearly<br>Justified this was their only rural<br>Hospital staff by<br>Specialists who while very competent in<br>their area will be much less comfortable<br>managing patients outside their<br>immediate<br>specialty<br>there's now a well established training<br>scheme for Rural Hospital generalists in<br>New Zealand this creates a career<br>pathway and generates a community of<br>rural doctors which wasn't present when<br>I<br>started including these<br>suspects mark on the left was the first<br>graduate of the program to join the<br>Dunston team and he's just starting out<br>on his first research project I'm sure<br>it won't be the last J Pini Center is at<br>Kar hospital he also helps helps Roy and<br>his projects and tuni on the right in<br>the islands where CI has had way<br>more success than I had in the the<br>result of a long-term relationship and<br>commitment Dunston has done well out of<br>out of this and many of you will see the<br>steady stream of young doctors come<br>through but many places are still very<br>short and we just need to see more<br>trainees and strategies to get them to<br>go where they're<br>needed and there's also there is a need<br>for a similar real GP training program<br>which is being<br>considered we also know what works at<br>Medical<br>School this is Caitlyn's research one of<br>our PhD students we know that New<br>Zealand doctors who have grown up<br>rurally are about three times more<br>likely to end up in rural practice and<br>students who do a taro's one year R<br>Rural and medical immersion program are<br>about six times more likely to do so now<br>this Pro program is just being extended<br>at the moment and will include Alexandra<br>and W from next<br>year although we know what to do we<br>it this is taken from a paper accepted<br>for publication just in the last few<br>days this is the rate of medical school<br>en enrollments per head of population<br>down the bottom here and these here this<br>these here are the rural kids<br>you can see that the the rate of medical<br>school en enrollments uh for the for the<br>rural kids is less than half what it is<br>U1 if we compare that to if we can<br>compare this to Australia we're real<br>kids are now actually slightly more<br>likely than Urban ones to end up at<br>Medical<br>School rural generalist training<br>pathways are just as important um for<br>our rural nursing and Allied Health<br>colleagues uh and and a lot they are<br>just just sitting out on this journey uh<br>this is serious paper from the<br>Australian Journal of rural Health um<br>weeks all of this only matters if having<br>a high performing rural House service<br>makes a difference and there some data<br>from the pandemic covid vaccine roll out<br>to suggest that it does maybe more so<br>than we<br>think this isn't a snapshot of ockland<br>partway through the vaccine roll out<br>each of the areas contains about 3,000<br>people darker the GRE darker green<br>corresponds to high vacination rates<br>purple if there is any to lower rates<br>uniform this is the central North Island<br>at the same same point in the<br>rollout firstly vaccination is further<br>variability you can see it here again<br>this dark line is the vaccination rate<br>for Mali and remote communities at a<br>national level over the 15 weeks of of<br>out here is one Community community's<br>experience for its Mali that's the solid<br>orange line and non-mi residents that's<br>a dotted line both groups outperform the<br>national Mali rate all the way<br>through some of the some of the<br>difference will be caused by the Mal<br>population being younger and the vaccine<br>being offered to older age groups first<br>close things went really differently in<br>the second<br>Community much slower at the start for<br>every one and although the non-mi<br>population managed to pick up later in<br>the roll out the rates for Mali<br>continued to languish and finished 25%<br>rate these are neighboring communities<br>with the same socio demographics and the<br>same<br>dhb the co immunization program was a<br>national program delivered by dhbs the<br>roll out should have been<br>uniform local fact is seem to be making<br>a difference and especially for the more<br>poorly served and vulnerable parts of<br>the<br>communities a series of interview based<br>studies were undertaken in an effort to<br>find the reasons for this this is still<br>work in progress but the conclusions are<br>be successful Ro vaccine rollouts and<br>other health initiatives should not be<br>built on specific immunization programs<br>large Central ized programs but rather<br>Services established local leadership<br>matter retaining and valuing Workforce<br>and human human resources in rural areas<br>is<br>important this has lead cardi to come up<br>with the features of a rural Health<br>service that best meets the needs of its<br>community<br>geographically tailored culturally<br>driven when we treat patients with heart<br>failure we give them diuretics to drive<br>off fluid they're important drugs that<br>provide immediate relief but it's a<br>sugar fix in the background they are<br>activating the renin Angiotensin Alder<br>sterone system you don't have to<br>understand that just to to know that<br>it's a hormonal system that is doing<br>structural damage steadily weakening the<br>heart so that if we use diuretics alone<br>we end up needing more and more of them<br>to the point the patient needs a<br>constant<br>infusion it feels like we're doing that<br>with our rural health system at the<br>moment investing in schemes to recruit<br>overseas health<br>professionals paying locom or distant<br>Urban emergency doctors on teley<br>medicine links way more than Those who<br>commit longterm to a real<br>Community if done in isolation these<br>things will weaken the local health<br>services that we know as so<br>key there is very effective<br>evidence-based therapy for heart failure<br>patients nowadays but it's harder work<br>and a bigger investment up front you<br>need to know the patient tailor the<br>treatment to their needs and work with<br>them in the long term real healthare is<br>the<br>same<br>there's way too many people to<br>thank research teaching Hospital GP<br>colleagues friends family and others the<br>and Jamie for organizing this event Tom<br>Murray for shooting the<br>deer there I have a couple of special<br>thanks first is to the nurses who you<br>work with most and end up knowing you<br>the<br>best who can make the most of your<br>strengths and more importantly cover for<br>your<br>weaknesses and arene uh no idea how many<br>times plans have been canceled at short<br>notice for work and uh she never<br>complains<br>me<br>no<br>done no put no Fang<br>or tanoto tanoto<br>tanoto so I'm Tim Stokes um I'm head of<br>Department of general practice I'm<br>Gary's boss I think the preferred term<br>these days is line manager and um it's<br>my great pleasure to uh open uh the<br>response to Gary's lecture I guess<br>before I start um many of you will not<br>will notice from my accident that I'm<br>not from around<br>here and uh so I'm from from North<br>England from black pool in fact so I've<br>Come A Very Long Way<br>South so in lectures such as these um<br>it's appropriate to reflect first of all<br>to thank Gary fulsomely for a very<br>interesting very reflective very<br>informative and I think very uplifting<br>anogra of sort of lecture I'm reflecting<br>on this there's certain ingredients in<br>the magic IP that you need to put in the<br>first of these is the personal touch<br>okay Gary I never knew you were such a<br>dresser and the second of course it's<br>very important to um acknowledge one<br>significant others particularly one's<br>partner so about excellent excellent<br>work there and also as well I think to<br>share something about yourself so that<br>we can learn who you are where you've<br>come from why you do what you do and<br>that was very clear and it's also so<br>nice to see you along the way<br>acknowledge people such as Pat marry and<br>others people who ignite the flame<br>people who are your mentors people who<br>support you so it's really good to say<br>that and thank you and feel not just<br>about what you do and what research you<br>do they're also about you telling us who<br>you are and I really appreciate<br>that moving on to the content of Gary's<br>lecture I'd just like to reflect that<br>Gary talked about his<br>research and I think thinking about<br>thinking about Scrooge that's Christmas<br>is coming up that there are ghosts of<br>research past the ghosts of research<br>present and the Ghost of research<br>future and Gary has talked about all of<br>those in order the first thing he talked<br>about was the research that he did when<br>he first<br>went into into Medical Practice he's a<br>contian and those who contians usually<br>start research from the work that we do<br>as CL something excites us something<br>interests us something we want to test<br>so very much really good description of<br>this clinical work that he did that has<br>of importance starting with strein a<br>antibodies and acute cous syndrome<br>moving on to aspects around the<br>development of point of care ultrasound<br>and troponin testing those are really<br>important because if you're a gist<br>working in a in a in in a roal hospital<br>setting you need access to timely<br>investigations to help you better<br>diagnose and then better manage the<br>patients that you're seeing in addition<br>to that an emphasis on quality of care<br>also emerged now that isn't really the<br>ghost of research present that's<br>continuing but that leads on to the<br>ghost of research so ghost of research<br>past I should say but that leads on to<br>Ghost of research present which is this<br>issue around the geographical<br>classification the past what was really<br>strong from what Gary said 20 years ago<br>is that we of course knew 20 years ago<br>that if you were rich or you were poor<br>you've had worse outcomes if you were<br>poor if you were Mari and you were<br>nonari you you had worse outcomes if you<br>were mared but 20 years ago we didn't<br>know that you had worse outcomes if you<br>lived in a rural area as opposed to an<br>urban area some said you did some said<br>you didn't and some said there was no<br>difference and that's no way to develop<br>and understand things with<br>that conflicting views so Gary's<br>research currently has really emphasized<br>the need to develop a robust<br>classification of rural Health by using<br>different categories<br>and then through that has been able to<br>show that on a range of both Health<br>outcomes and also Health delivery<br>aspects that it makes a difference so<br>it's very striking to show that if<br>you're aged under 60 then you are more<br>likely to have more mortality in rural<br>areas that's worse if you live more<br>rurally and that's accentuated from our<br>very important findings and then I think<br>then just brings me on to the ghost of<br>research<br>future because it is very important to<br>unmat ask actual disparities which is<br>what Gary has done looking at rural and<br>urban but we actually want to use that<br>information in a practical concrete way<br>to improve the health care for us all<br>and that will be the next step I I<br>foresee in your research Gary to help<br>build on this work to look at ways that<br>you can build as you say strong<br>resilient rural Health Systems and<br>hopefully through doing that you will be<br>able to show that actually you have<br>improved Health outcomes for the for<br>those<br>people and just wanted to finish now<br>just by saying something personally so<br>as I mentioned I'm from the UK I came<br>here<br>uh nearly 10 years ago and I met Gary at<br>interview that's over 10 years ago and<br>Gary I was immediately impressed with<br>Gary there was a passion there was a<br>drive this is when you were doing your<br>research on ultrasound work and you'd<br>obviously done this great work between<br>hcky anger and Dunston in terms of using<br>different populations to demonstrate the<br>impact of what you were doing and over<br>this time I've been Gary's colleague<br>I've worked with Gary I've laterally<br>developed a section for Rural health and<br>our department and the said of which I'm<br>head of which Gary is my I'm his line<br>manager and in addition to that we work<br>closely together on a number of research<br>projects and I just wanted to reflect on<br>not only the research that Gary's<br>presented but my Reflections on Gary's<br>ability to have passion to drive to<br>build and support a team around him to<br>actually support and nurture that<br>members of that team and always thinking<br>through as well it's not just about us<br>it's about the Next Generation and<br>supporting and encouraging those people<br>doctors academics and so forth and in<br>those respect I want to pay uh thanks to<br>Gary for having that ability to<br>demonstrate that and to and it's been a<br>pleasure for me personally to have been<br>on the journey with Gary over the last<br>car and as is the custom I have a little<br>Gary I'm being left-handed I'm never<br>really<br>sure congratulations there a present for<br>you from the University and thank you<br>again<br>for<br>so now I'm calling on Trevor Lloyd who<br>is a long serving doctor to say a few<br>up um well was<br>awesome um thank you<br>Gary um yeah my name is Trevor Lloyd<br>um I'm one of Gary's colleagues at<br>Dunston hospital um I acknowledge there<br>are others in the audience who can claim<br>the same privilege um either currently<br>or from before and I know some of you<br>have come a long way to be here just for<br>this um most of us are here I think<br>because of our love and respect for Gary<br>achievements so my job this evening is<br>to thank Gary for his<br>lecture uh on behalf of his colleagues<br>and I'm happy to do that um but there's<br>for Gary once gave me some tips on<br>Research knowing I like telling<br>stories he advised me when presenting<br>the results of research put numbers in<br>it<br>notice well only people who can't read<br>or can't count or can't think would fail<br>to take notice what Gary has been<br>telling us this evening um so I'm going<br>story um I don't have time to tell you<br>stories of Gary as a doctor or a teacher<br>or a<br>patient instead I'm going to tell you<br>the story of how I came to be working<br>here um we're both from Southland um in<br>the 1990s we both worked in rural<br>hospitals um me in Northland and Gary<br>here in Dunston um in those days there<br>was no network of rural hospitals like<br>there is<br>now um I met Gary at a rural teaching<br>conference in viago in<br>1996 when he and Dennis pizaro gave a<br>presentation on managing heart attacks<br>in rural General practices in rural<br>hospitals<br>1996 um the sort of heart treatments<br>he's been telling us about this<br>evening the next time I came across Gary<br>was when I got a job at Dunston in<br>2000 and some of you may have heard this<br>story before they must have been<br>desperate for doctors at that time and<br>and I'll tell you now how I knew<br>that I phoned Gary at home to ask him<br>about the position I had seen<br>advertised his wife arene answered and<br>explained he was in the<br>bath so I offered to phone back<br>later no no she said he'll want to take<br>you a<br>phone now that was the recruitment<br>time uh since then the place has grown<br>and the paperwork has become more<br>complicated uh we have a strong stable<br>group of doctors to borrow a<br>term um we have specialist registration<br>as rural Hospital doctors we have a<br>training program for Rural Hospital<br>medicine and many of our doctors are<br>graduates of that program um that<br>includes papers from aaga University<br>postgraduate<br>diploma and as Gary says we need<br>something similar for nurses and Allied<br>Health um we have undergraduate medical<br>students and jior medical staff and it<br>sounds like next year we'll be doting<br>rural emersion<br>students dunon is part of a research<br>Network extending across the country<br>employing a range of healthcare<br>professionals and researchers not just<br>doctors as Gary has told us but nurses<br>and Allied Health and others bringing in<br>millions millions of dollars for Rural<br>communities and for the University of<br>ATO it's partly thanks to Gary as he has<br>all so thank you Gary for your lecture<br>this evening and for all your hard work<br>over the<br>years<br>Nora<br>all right thank you for that Trevor so<br>we're nearly done and all I want to<br>reflect on is this is the day the<br>University of aago came to this fall<br>there's been the odd Professor here<br>before for social occasions but I don't<br>think we've ever had a vice Chancellor<br>and a dean of a medical school and a<br>bunch of professors who are doctors who<br>also do doctoring so I think that's<br>pretty remarkable for those who are out<br>of town I just quickly want to say this<br>Hall is about to turn 100 in two or<br>three years time and the name ears clue<br>was given to this place by the<br>interesting surveyor<br>Thompson and there's another earns clue<br>to the southeast of Edinburgh in<br>Scotland and it's beside a place called<br>lorda and there are a range of names as<br>some of you may know that were given by<br>that survey the truth is he wasn't<br>allowed to give M names as I understand<br>it in the story that's why out the way<br>towards the manoto you've got saburn urn<br>and gimma burn I understand that that<br>was his idea of a joke so you're an<br>insute tonight and I think that if all<br>said and done we will<br>conclude are we ready to<br>conclude then I will say for my<br>part CL tanoto t<br>tanoto and I will ask that our friends<br>in the front row conclude and bless the<br>food because we're about to ask you to<br>stay and have a fabulous cup of tea and<br>scone and a little bit of catering for<br>about 20 minutes and the reason for that<br>time frame is the family are going to<br>have a barbecue out the b so I encourage<br>you to stay talk have a cup of tea<br>within that time<br>you<br>thank you very much for your attendance<br>tonight your thank you for your talk uh<br>it was I found<br>Illuminating interesting but also very<br>concerning in in many<br>ways<br>we honor you for all of us it is<br>customary at such times to fish with a<br>stand<br>okay</p></main><footer style="margin-top: 2rem; background: #0001; padding: 2rem; text-align: center;"><p>We Are The University</p><ul style="list-style-type:
