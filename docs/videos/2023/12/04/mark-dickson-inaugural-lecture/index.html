taroto<br>C my name is Robin Kerns I'm uh one of<br>the other professors of geography at the<br>uh University of Oakland School of<br>environment I'm here tonight um bringing<br>greetings from the dean of science John<br>hosing and also the deputy Dean Jr<br>Roland both of whom um unfortunately<br>can't be here this even evening but that<br>leaves me the particular pleasure and<br>privilege of introducing my colleague<br>Mark uh who's been with us in the school<br>for I believe it's about 15 years isn't<br>it and uh and uh so we're here this<br>evening for a very special<br>occasion inaugural lectures are an<br>opportunity to<br>celebrate to um<br>congratulate and to be inspired by<br>uh a career of scholarship teaching and<br>service that have led colleagues to the<br>point of the uh very uh Elite promotion<br>to professor at this<br>University and uh we're here today to<br>this evening to um hear Mark speak to<br>his career and his uh research so it's<br>my pleasure just to make a couple of<br>comments um introducing Mark for those<br>of you who may have come more for the<br>topic um than the person because I do<br>acknowledge that especially with family<br>and friends and former students in the<br>room many of you will know Mark very<br>well but um Mark's uh distinguished<br>career as a geographer stretches back to<br>his bachelor's degree at Massie and then<br>doing a PhD in Wallen gong in Australia<br>and uh there Mark told me he met Shona<br>and so uh it's very important on<br>occasions like inaugural lectures to<br>acknowledge family I believe I look back<br>warmly on my own lecture uh inaugural<br>lecture when my children were were were<br>present as with as was the same with my<br>elderly father at the time uh Mark<br>joined us as I said about 15 years ago<br>and uh during that time he's had a<br>number of um very satisfying uh research<br>and study leaves AKA sabatical in the US<br>and uh and in England<br>uh but he made the comment to me that uh<br>one of the most satisfying parts of his<br>career was um the pleasing sense that<br>his postgrads have gone on to do so well<br>and I believe that there are some<br>graduates in fact I've spotted one or<br>two graduates in the audience so um a<br>particular welcome um Marx had roles in<br>in organizations such as Nia manaki fena<br>several councils and engineering and uh<br>Consulting companies uh these these are<br>some of the uh organizations that his<br>postgrads have gone on to work in as<br>well as having two former PhD students<br>at scrips institution of oceanography<br>and uh another at Tufts and a former PhD<br>now at Oxford so I think you'll agree<br>that's a a very rich um variety of<br>places where his graduates have ended up<br>now as you'll know from the poster<br>Mark's Work Embraces understanding<br>processes on the coast across a range of<br>settings from open Sandy beaches to<br>Rocky Cliff<br>shorelines and that is a field of<br>enormous currency as we seek to mitigate<br>and adapt to uh effects of climate<br>change his work is principally in New<br>Zealand in Arta but um in 2017 I had the<br>privilege of joining him on a data<br>collection Excursion to the Maldives and<br>uh uh learning uh as a human geographer<br>from uh both uh Mark and others and in<br>fact I can see a couple of uh smiling<br>former postgrads in the audience there<br>that was a a wonderful trip so Mark<br>Mark's Work unpacks the complex<br>relationships between sea level change<br>tectonics uh environmental processes and<br>Coastal landform Evolution he's an<br>Enthusiast for the field that uh site<br>that we as geographers use to describe<br>anywhere outside our offices and uh in<br>Mark's case the field is the coast he<br>applies inductive field traditions of<br>physical geography but in combat ation<br>with a wide variety of new opportunities<br>for measurement sensor technology<br>radiometric dating remote sensing and<br>modeling so just to uh round off a few<br>introductory remarks here as Coastal<br>instability across our too right from<br>places closer to home like muray through<br>deah here um as these sort of instances<br>attest the challenges posed by<br>accelerating Global sea level rise these<br>are current and pressing issues and<br>Mark's Work is Central to understanding<br>the future of this domain between land<br>and sea he's an effective and<br>influential leader in transdisciplinary<br>research which this University honors<br>and uh his focus is in relation to<br>climate adaptation and mitigation look<br>forward to your uh lecture very much<br>Mark thanks for<br>wel Koto um thank you very much Robin<br>for for that introduction thank you<br>everyone for for coming uh along it's a<br>it's a great pleasure to have a a group<br>of people I think none of whom have been<br>compelled to come and and listen to this<br>talk except maybe my kids at the back<br>here they've been compelled to come<br>along uh hopefully we'll be able to talk<br>about something interesting uh today<br>I've I've I've come up with a title for<br>this talk which has two parts to it uh<br>SE change our transgressing coast and<br>sea change what I really wanted to<br>reference is uh to take an opportunity<br>to look back on my career in in in this<br>field Coastal geography Coastal<br>geomorphology uh more specifically and<br>have a look at how it's changed over the<br>years in which I've been involved and<br>what I'll try and convince you of is<br>that what I learned as an undergraduate<br>student at Massi University not so<br>terribly far away turns out to be quite<br>different to what I'm now currently<br>teaching my undergraduate students here<br>in the last kind of 20 years there's<br>been that change so I'll try and address<br>that and I also want to um spend a bit<br>of time addressing this question of our<br>transcript dressing Coastline about sea<br>level rise climate change and Coastal<br>erosion I did my first postto at the<br>University of Bristol after I'd<br>completed my PhD and I was working for<br>the Tindle Center of climate change<br>research at that time but if I tried to<br>convince anyone that the sea level was<br>rising or the coast was eroding in<br>response you was very difficult argument<br>at that time now it feels like the<br>pendulum swung to the extent where<br>there's barely a week goes by that<br>there's not an article in the newspaper<br>and almost always linking Coastal<br>erosion to sea level rise and yet I<br>think that's probably not quite<br>appropriate either so I want to spend a<br>bit of time talking about that as well<br>but before we get onto any of that the<br>kind of obligatory uh where did this<br>come from uh I think so here's a<br>photograph is sort of a pretty classic<br>1980s photo photograph maybe the very<br>last year the brown Skiby was in I think<br>perhaps in this period of time that's uh<br>that's me in the foreground thankfully<br>my brother in the background I'm the one<br>wearing underwear<br>thankfully we moved here in 1979 my<br>parents moved here my father was a<br>geography teacher on the carpy coast my<br>mother was a school teacher as well uh<br>and in the year that we moved here it<br>was only three years after the big storm<br>of 1976 has wiped some properties off<br>the map left other properties<br>precariously positioned on the<br>coastline and so my parents was<br>conservative School teachers what did<br>they do purchased one property back from<br>the back from the June that's the right<br>thing to do but of course wisdom is a<br>funny old thing uh there hasn't been<br>another storm to rival the 1976 storm in<br>the last 40 odd years and now the<br>beachfront properties that you couldn't<br>give away at that time are worth<br>multi-millions of dollars so my parents<br>are still sitting there in their house<br>one June back uh perhaps waiting for the<br>storm maybe their wisdom will be uh<br>borne out in the end<br>so here's uh my father and I on some<br>beach somewhere I think this might be in<br>myah here actually uh hopefully people<br>have noticed the impressive head of hair<br>going on back at that time but you can<br>see the<br>transition in in progress uh and my<br>memory as a as a kiwi growing up<br>traveling around the country was like<br>many many kiwis I guess going to<br>different remote locations where it<br>differed is that I had a geography High<br>School teacher driving the car and<br>lecturing my family about the landscape<br>as we were driving along and much to the<br>abject horror of my mother and my<br>brother I was deeply interested in what<br>my father had to say and I would spur<br>him along you're kidding me dad a<br>glacier once flowed down that Valley etc<br>etc so that those were our car Journeys<br>and my kids sitting back there right now<br>can probably attest to that tradition<br>carrying on to this present<br>day so I've always extracted a great<br>deal of Joy from Landscapes from as long<br>as I can remember and and back when I<br>was a kid you went to the university<br>closest to your house more or less and<br>so I went to Massie and I was very lucky<br>to arrive at Massie at a time where<br>there there were two Coastal<br>dermatologists operating uh Mike Shepard<br>and and Patrick hisp and also at a time<br>where Messi was willing to run a<br>massively financially unsustainable<br>model in which myself and the one other<br>Coastal geratology student in the class<br>had two Coastal geology lecturers and<br>would go out into the field and explore<br>the landscape it's pretty sad to see how<br>physical geography has withered on the<br>vine at Massie now uh but in terms of a<br>selfish kind of experience as a student<br>I'm what great training to be able to to<br>have that<br>experience after Messi I went across to<br>uh work with uh this chap here colum<br>woodrough at the University of Australia<br>uh fantastic um Mentor uh I often look<br>back thinking that Colin effectively<br>taught me how to read the literature and<br>read the landscape I thereafter went to<br>the University of Bristol and was<br>suddenly subject to um a bunch of<br>Engineers who were using the language of<br>math and computer programming and so I<br>remain I mean I went to work with Mike<br>walked in here on the photo and Jim Hall<br>and I remain extremely grateful in<br>particular to Mike for persevering with<br>me as I came up to speed slowly in math<br>and and programming so that was kind of<br>my training uh up till Bristol days uh<br>thereafter I came back to New Zealand<br>worked at Nea with um particularly with<br>people like giovan Coco and and Murray<br>Hicks and then I had this glorious 3mon<br>Gap where I'd finished my three-year<br>postto at at Nea and deciding what to do<br>with my life um I'd met my wife Shona by<br>this stage and we'd gone to Kolkata<br>where her parents were and we stayed in<br>this room for three months i' drunk beer<br>and drunk tea um watched Cricket kind of<br>living the dream as far as I could see<br>my father-in-law was less impressed with<br>what was going on uh he sted to wonder<br>about his his daughter's life choices no<br>doubt but I had a choice to make because<br>I was um at that time deciding should I<br>go back to nea I also had a a postdoctor<br>a um a work opportunity at at a big<br>engineering company that I could go to<br>or I'd just done this interview here at<br>the University of ockland was talking to<br>my father-in-law about it and I was<br>really nervous about coming to ockland<br>of the three opportunities the ockland<br>one was the one I was least um<br>comfortable with because I'd never given<br>a lecture before basically so do I want<br>to turn up and just guess that I might<br>be a bble to do this eventually took the<br>brave Choice landed up here and I I<br>remember being wheeled out in front of<br>the first class no training that's how<br>we do it generally no training rolled<br>out in front of the first class and and<br>I was sort of grateful for my school<br>teacher parents because I feel like some<br>osmosis or something I felt comfortable<br>like I knew what to do uh and the rest<br>is kind of History really been here for<br>15 years since that<br>time okay enough sorted background let's<br>jump into some detail that's why you're<br>here uh I want to spend a a little bit<br>of time referencing changing sea level<br>and I think most people will be aware of<br>the fact that the climate has oscillated<br>a lot uh through cycles for a very long<br>period of geological time and as the<br>temperature has been warmer and colder<br>associated with how far the Earth's<br>orbit has been away from the Sun so too<br>has there been more and less ice held in<br>ice caps which means that the sea level<br>has gone up and down a lot if you look<br>at the scale on this ax is up to 120 M<br>lower than pres present only about<br>20,000 years ago so sea level has<br>oscillated a lot and what US Coastal gy<br>apologists are particularly interested<br>in is what's happened during the period<br>of time between about 20,000 years ago<br>and about the present day we call this<br>the post Glacial Marine transgression<br>sea level Rose incredibly quickly on<br>average at a rate of of about 10 millim<br>per year before abruptly slowing down<br>and stabilizing around the<br>globe I was particularly influenced by<br>this paper published by Jeremy Gibb and<br>the Royal soci of New Zealand bulletin<br>back in 1986 all of us were when we were<br>studying in the mid90s because Jeremy<br>had gone around the coastline of New<br>Zealand collecting data for historic uh<br>and geological scale sea level<br>variability and basically produced the<br>same plot that you see from other parts<br>of the world so sea level Rose then<br>stabilized at about its current level<br>about 6 a half thousand years before<br>prison and has been approximately stable<br>since this time so that was kind of the<br>framing that we thought about Coastal<br>Evolution within uh and yet it's it's<br>not quite right and we've been learning<br>that only in the last kind of 10 or 15<br>years or so so what's happening now well<br>I think we're all aware that sea levels<br>been rising over the 20th century uh<br>historic rates of about 2 millim per<br>year accelerating to nearly double that<br>rate since about 1990 and where are we<br>going in the future depending on how<br>badly we manag the climate we're not<br>doing a very good job right at the<br>moment probably something like a meter<br>of sea level rise um maybe by the end of<br>the century or<br>thereabouts now I want to talk about two<br>overarching conceptual models for Sandy<br>Coast Evolution and for Rocky Coast<br>Evolution that I learned as a<br>undergraduate and a PhD student and<br>which we've been spending some time kind<br>of re-evaluating during my years here at<br>the University of ockland first thing to<br>say is that 120 M of cular Riz is a<br>great deal so at the height of the last<br>glacial maximum you have no problem<br>walking from Oakland to Great Barry<br>island or to that matter to the south<br>island or you could even walk to the sub<br>Antarctic Islands as well and then as<br>the sea level has risen dramatically<br>since that time it's flooded across the<br>continental shelf and it's reconfigured<br>Coastal landforms as a as a result so we<br>can go about understanding this by<br>jumping across the ditch to Australia<br>were a fantastic series of studies were<br>done by um Peter Roy Peter Cal Bruce Tom<br>and short Colin woodro many many others<br>throughout the 80s and '90s back as far<br>as the 70s and very nicely summarized in<br>this textbook by mass Lin and Hughes<br>that I've often used to teach from here<br>at the University of ockland so what are<br>we going to do we're going to take a a<br>boat and we're going to take a we're<br>going to take a crosssection off the<br>coastline of this little Township called<br>maruya few hours drive south of Sydney<br>so here's our boat and on the back of<br>the boat we've got some coring equipment<br>we're going to drop core down through<br>the seaf Flor sediments there's going to<br>be a thin veneer of sand but shockingly<br>we're going to discover beneath that<br>thin veneer of sand these Relic esterine<br>muds that's important because we can<br>only get an isy if we have a Sandy<br>barrier in front of that isy to block<br>the wave energy that's how the sediments<br>can filter out and suspension we don't<br>see any evidence for a Sandy barrier<br>there now and because the sediments are<br>getting older and older the further we<br>go out across the Shelf what that must<br>mean is that this barrier<br>has been bulldozed across the<br>continental shelf and then put in place<br>where it's remained for about the last<br>6,000 years or so this is kind of like a<br>sediment bulldozer model of sea level<br>rise uh that we came to understand from<br>the Australian data if we jump into the<br>Junes now and take a cross-section<br>across the Junes from a to a prime then<br>we can see that the sedent bulldozer has<br>been very effective at quickly<br>prograding the coastal land mass and in<br>fact about 75% of the sand barrier was<br>in place by around about 5,000 years<br>before prison so this is our overarching<br>highly simplified model of how our Sandy<br>Coastal barriers came to look the way<br>they do think odwa or um<br>Fatar Omaha Etc these barriers should<br>look something like this that's what I<br>learned as an undergraduate what I spent<br>a bit of time teaching my undergraduate<br>students here as<br>well okay texbook Rocky Coast response<br>to sea level rise over the holos scene<br>here I was very much influenced by the<br>the the first textbook on Rocky Coast<br>written by Alan trinal in<br>1987 but perhaps even more so by a<br>textbook that came out only 5 years<br>later Sugo curra's book in 1992 this was<br>kind of my Bible embarrassing I walk<br>around with this book as a PhD student I<br>learned an incredible amount from it I<br>think I I think I favored it because so<br>many of the examples were from the<br>Japanese Coast which could kind of look<br>quite a lot like the New Zealand Coast<br>that I was familiar with I've forced<br>many of my subsequent PhD students to<br>read this Bible too so it a some relief<br>that I turned up to the University of<br>Durham a few years ago and found this<br>poster up on one of their walls in the<br>postgraduate room so the cinema of fan<br>club has spread far and wide okay I'm<br>going to grossly simplify what this<br>textbook had to say in a a kind of a<br>single slide this is what Rocky Coast<br>lines look like most people will be<br>familiar generally and actively in Cliff<br>with quite a gently sloping what we call<br>Shore platform in front of the cliffs<br>here one of my um students hero working<br>out on the on the shore<br>platform and here is a very simplified<br>conceptual model of how we understand<br>the evolution of this type of<br>landscape sunamura assumed that the<br>original position of the cliff when the<br>sea level stabilized around about 6 and<br>a half thousand years ago would have<br>been out here so in the photograph the<br>the cliff would once have been out out<br>here and it's eroded back through time<br>with the seaward edge of the shore<br>platform remaining as a kind of a<br>vestigal reminder of the original<br>position of the cliff he reasoned that<br>the rate of erosion should decrease<br>through time as the platform gets wider<br>and wave energy gets increasingly<br>dissipated so we sometimes call this the<br>static equilibrium model because you can<br>imagine that once the platform gets wide<br>enough then erosion would cease so this<br>is our kind of working textbook model of<br>um Rocky Coast response that I learned<br>as a PhD student when I was over in<br>Australia but the big learning I think<br>one of the big learnings from the last<br>10 15 years plus has been that Hol CNC<br>level at least around Northern New<br>Zealand has not been stable at all there<br>was an early possible indication of this<br>right back to the work of scoffield who<br>was a professor here I think must have<br>been back in the 50s and 60s who had<br>found some evidence for higher sea<br>levels during this period of time but<br>it's really been over the last 10 or 15<br>years that evidence has gradually<br>started accumulating I'm thinking of<br>work by Bruce haward and alist Clement<br>and many other people to indicate that<br>sea level's been somewhat higher during<br>the Hol scene uh the very nice text book<br>of Paul Williams has raised Coastal<br>landforms and Limestone raised Coastal<br>notches as well so sea level must have<br>been higher at some point during the<br>hallene and I think this has been<br>brought together really nicely in the<br>PHD work of aliser back in 20 2016 uh<br>where the blue line is a modeled line of<br>sea level history during the hallene in<br>Northern New Zealand applicable to<br>Oakland and so what does this tell us<br>that the sea level probably Rose to<br>present levels around about 8,000 years<br>ago continued to rise reaching a maximum<br>of maybe even as much as 2 meters above<br>current Levels by about 4,000 years ago<br>and then it's declined in some fashion<br>over the last 4,000 years or so so I<br>think this new understanding of Hollen<br>sea Lev in New Zealand it's taken quite<br>a long time to dawn on me how profoundly<br>important this is for understanding our<br>both our Sandy Coastal Landscapes and<br>our Rocky Coastal Landscapes this is<br>what I want to spend a bit of time<br>talking<br>about okay let's go back to my very<br>first year here at the University of<br>ockland 2001 at the Miranda Shin<br>airplane and I've got a class of 200<br>student jog 2011 and off you go Mark<br>we're off to the Miranda chener plane<br>I've got I'm standing here taking a<br>photograph of students I've got 100 of<br>them out here with 5 m High metal sha<br>metal uh staffs and this kind of for<br>boing weather is coming in I'm hearing a<br>rumble in the background suddenly<br>occurring to me I've got like a 100<br>lightning conductors standing out there<br>in the landscape be a bad start to one's<br>career wouldn't it but it it worked out<br>okay we're able to study this chener<br>plane and I was looking for a photograph<br>of a PhD student who was around at that<br>time but what did I find a photograph<br>here of where is Emma there's Emma<br>marching out across the landscape it<br>must have been Emma's first year maybe<br>or second year as a as an undergraduate<br>student here but already you can see the<br>seeds of a promising academic she's left<br>her colleagues abandoned here in the mud<br>behind her as she's marching out across<br>the landscape so early good signals<br>there from Emma but this is the photo I<br>was looking at for Amy docky was nearly<br>not too far away from finishing her PhD<br>by the time I turned up previous<br>supervisor had left the country and so I<br>was helping her kind of bring her PhD<br>thesis together and what we wanted to do<br>was study how these you can see these<br>shiners we call them shiners the little<br>shell ridges they're poking up through<br>the grass and the landscape here we<br>wanted to understand how has this system<br>evolved through time and we already had<br>this beautiful radiocarbon chronology<br>that had been laid down by scoffield and<br>woodro my former supervisor when he was<br>here at Oakland uh so we already had the<br>chronology to work with all we needed to<br>do was to drag something called a ground<br>penetrating radar across this wide<br>prograded Coastal plane and the reason<br>we wanted to do this is that we argued<br>that the basil contact between the<br>Shelly sediments and the muddy sediments<br>underneath would be a very reliable<br>proxy for sea level over time and so<br>that's what we did and we mapped out how<br>high the contact was between the Shelly<br>uh sediments and and the mud and lo and<br>behold we find that the older shenir<br>develop about 3,900 years before present<br>was about the sea level would have been<br>about 2 m higher than it currently is<br>and note that our study 2012 has come<br>along well before alistair's study and<br>so it's really gratifying then when<br>Alistair comes along with the modeling<br>and says yeah that's what we think as<br>well sea level should have been about 2<br>meters higher so the data seemed to make<br>a lot of sense for this Coastal<br>landscape but what does this really mean<br>if you look at this procreated Coastal<br>plane all of it has developed during a<br>period of time in which sea level has<br>been falling there's no evidence<br>whatsoever for the sea level rise<br>bulldozzer pushing sediments up against<br>the landscape here all of the<br>progradation is forced by sea level rise<br>a sea level fall a combination of sea<br>level fall and the production of shells<br>from um production of shells out on the<br>foreshore okay next example uh we're<br>going slightly further north here I love<br>this photo we've got a picture of um our<br>technician here watching the academic<br>doing the work at I think shamefully<br>actually they did all the work and I<br>asked to pose for this Photograph you<br>remember that I think think that's what<br>actually happened here uh but here we<br>are at the dudas regional park<br>shamefully unpublished probably because<br>I didn't have a student working on this<br>um project at the time and yet I think<br>this particular study holds the clue to<br>really unpacking the history of Sandy<br>barrier Evolution uh around Oakland<br>because there's at the back of this<br>barrier there's a big Sand Ridge which<br>is stratagraph sedimentologically<br>completely different to the Shell ridges<br>that occur in front of it in the seawood<br>part of the barrier and when we dated<br>these sand ridges we used a method<br>called Optical stimulated luminescence<br>we find out that the ridge was developed<br>about 7 and a half thousand years ago at<br>the end of the time that this<br>postglacial transgression was<br>terminating here's our bulldozer it's<br>bulldozed this sand barrier up against<br>the coastline and left it stranded and<br>then we have 4 th000 years of high sea<br>level and no progradation whatsoever<br>before the sea level starts falling<br>again and just like at Miranda the shell<br>ridges start getting produced and we see<br>progradation of the barrier uh during<br>the last 4,000 years so we see we see<br>the sea level rise bulldozer here but<br>it's only a very small component of the<br>progradation of these<br>barriers so if I try and bring this<br>together and I've got a photograph here<br>of AA in the in the background we<br>haven't studied this particular location<br>but I think our conclusions from<br>elsewhere can be applied here we used to<br>think that Coastal sand barriers<br>prograded during 6 and a half thousand<br>years of stable sea level a product of<br>the post glacial bulldozer and sediment<br>Supply but I now say think something<br>really quite different I think our<br>Coastal sand barriers mainly prograded<br>during sea level fall in the last 4,000<br>years I think they required sea level<br>fall to prograde so if you kind of think<br>about the implications of that in the<br>context of new<br>ongoing rising sea level then I don't<br>know I think there's less evidence that<br>we've had sediments to build these<br>barriers more evidence that we've had a<br>higher contribution from sea level fall<br>so digital elevation model of AUD it<br>currently looks like this if we imagine<br>the period of time between 4,000 and<br>8,000 years ago it would have been a big<br>wide open embayment and then only when<br>sea level started falling did these<br>barriers start prograding out in<br>response to that sea level fall as well<br>as bit of sediment Supply I think these<br>sediment I think these barriers are more<br>sediment starved than we previously<br>thought and I think they should<br>therefore in theory respond more quickly<br>to accelerating sea level rise than we<br>previously thought as<br>well okay so that allows me to segue<br>into this kind of current situation<br>where we're in where barely a week goes<br>by where we don't get a report in the<br>media about Coastal erosion and the<br>inevitable link to sea level rise being<br>the driver of that erosion and it's not<br>just in the media I mean it's a paper<br>published in nature climate change using<br>a numerical model to predict the near<br>Extinction of sandy beaches um from<br>large parts of the world by the end of<br>the century so there's a lot of this out<br>there in the literature so what are we<br>doing about this so here's our um Megan<br>Emma can we call this a labor of love<br>certainly a labor The Last 5 Years of<br>kind of mapping all of the historical<br>changes in New Zealand's Coastline as<br>one of of the National Science challenge<br>projects heaps of people involved we<br>counted up about 40 people who have been<br>involved in our mapping program Over The<br>Last 5 Years apologies if I've managed<br>to admit anyone's name from this list so<br>this is a kind of real Legacy project<br>for this country with mapping all of the<br>erosion and accretion patterns that have<br>occurred everywhere and what are we<br>starting to find well as you might not<br>be surprised to realize uh there are<br>lots of local scale variability in<br>erosion and accretion P patterns so here<br>in the carpet Coast accretion on the<br>Northern side of the Headland erosion in<br>the South here on the West Coast lots of<br>erosion but packets of accretion as well<br>and it's too early to try and draw any<br>firm conclusions but here are some<br>headline stats uh were about 95%<br>complete in our mapping so here are some<br>early stats I mean strikingly more of<br>the West Coast of Northland has either<br>been stable or accreting than has been<br>eroding uh by cont more of the West<br>Coast has been eroding than has been<br>stable or accreting and lots of variable<br>patterns around the coastline and this<br>is not that surprising for us Coastal<br>germ mythologists because we know<br>sediment Supply local sediment Supply is<br>important we know vegetation changes are<br>important we know that humans are<br>important and an affected climate<br>variability associated with alino and<br>Lina there's lots of things that can<br>screw up us seeing the signature of sea<br>level rise in these data it doesn't mean<br>that the sign of sea level rise are not<br>in the data that means it's hard to see<br>it so that's where we're currently at we<br>do have some really interesting um early<br>observations that right at the top of<br>the North Island at the bottom of the<br>South Island for example we see in the<br>aerial photograph record a history of<br>accretion but in the satellite record<br>last 10 15 years A reversal of that<br>Trend toward quite fast erosion is this<br>uh a result of accelerating recent SE<br>liise too early to say but this is what<br>our our team has been working on over<br>the last kind of 5 years or<br>so when you have a broad team of people<br>working on a project like this you get<br>lots of different perspectives and I<br>just wanted to pick out one here uh this<br>is an honors student Millie uh<br>co-supervised by myself and Dan hikaro<br>Brennan's here as well out helping in<br>the field<br>and we've gone to work at her local<br>marai in a far north of far far Northern<br>re region of Northland and we' looked at<br>the historical data and it paints a kind<br>of alarming story really uh Coastal<br>erosion coastal flooding and my thoughts<br>went immediately to kind of like is<br>there an engineering solution here do we<br>need to do manage Retreat or whatever<br>and and Millie and her Foo came back<br>with this uh this this kind of very<br>nuanced and I thought quite deep<br>response which was that we need to make<br>the land clean before it goes under the<br>water I thought oh well that's a<br>completely a much more sophisticated and<br>important way to think about this<br>problem it made me think that these data<br>that we're collecting are very good very<br>important that they're robust and<br>locally relevant because we're going to<br>need local adaptation with lots of<br>different voices that's kind of what<br>this example made me think made me also<br>remind me of course you can learn a lot<br>of things from your<br>students okay in the time that I've got<br>left I want to go back to kind of a<br>completely different topic and finished<br>with um with Sandy coastlines and I want<br>to talk about rock coastlines which are<br>I mean I think these are beautiful<br>dramatic Landscapes this here is Ball's<br>pyramid I'm not sure if anyone's ever<br>been here it's a volcanic Spire of rock<br>550 M High comes straight out of the<br>Pacific Ocean It's the final penultimate<br>remnant of a volcanic island that's been<br>completely plated away and in the<br>background we see Lord how Island which<br>is where I did my PhD research um back<br>in the early 2000s now Rock Coast<br>Landscapes are they're beautiful but<br>they're really quite tricky to study<br>because they change very slowly and<br>because they change slowly it means we<br>can't take measurements of the change<br>and Link that to the processes that are<br>driving the change and therefore we<br>can't build um robust mathematical<br>models we're kind of left with<br>observation and so as a result of that<br>there's a really cherished field<br>tradition in physical geography and in<br>coastal geology dealing with these Rocky<br>Landscapes they can almost be captured<br>by the maximum of sort of like study<br>nature not books I'm no philosopher of<br>science but the philosophers of science<br>uh writers that's the sort of thing they<br>say that there's been a a belief that we<br>should go into the field almost<br>Unshackled by Theory and we should<br>observe the landscape and the true<br>nature of the landscape will reveal<br>itself and therefore we can go from<br>observation to Theory we call that<br>induction or and in more recent times<br>twist Twist on that is abduction and<br>dermology but those who are critical<br>about that way of knowing can sometimes<br>argue it's definitely has its roots in<br>scientific positivism and almost reduces<br>to sort of like a radical form of<br>empiricism and I thought I'd try and<br>give you one example to try and<br>understand this uh and that are the many<br>confounding observations that we see in<br>Rocky Coast Landscapes it should be the<br>case that you get wider Shore platforms<br>and parts of the world that are more<br>exposed to more energetic waves because<br>they eroded this wider surface The<br>Cliffs gone further back and you do see<br>that very often but it's also very often<br>the case that if you go to the most<br>sheltered embayments then you see the<br>wide platforms and and we've had this<br>kind of longstanding debate in the<br>literature it's more than a century<br>between those on the one hand who<br>believe that wave erosion processes are<br>important driver of Cliff recession and<br>those who on the other side of the coin<br>who believe that weathering is all about<br>the way about the Rocks weather is the<br>most important thing this kind of<br>so-called waves versus weathering debate<br>and I think it's only relatively<br>recently through some of the work of of<br>some of my students and some other<br>people as well particularly the work of<br>one of my students hero who who<br>developed a numerical model for rock<br>coasts in which we allowed the model to<br>develop either by wave erosion or by<br>weathering processes or by some<br>combination of these and we quickly<br>found that we could produce an almost<br>ident iCal landscape with wave erosion<br>processes and with weathering processes<br>so we call that equ finality the the<br>opportunity to arrive at the same land<br>form through completely different sets<br>of processes and so this is kind of the<br>landscape in which I AR doing my PhD on<br>on Rock coastlines and and so I was very<br>grateful for these textbooks by Tren Hal<br>and sunamura because for the first time<br>they La outlaid outlined a simple<br>mathematical framework within which we<br>could start to test some of these ideas<br>so that's what my students have been<br>doing at ockland over the last um 15 or<br>so years uh these are not all of my<br>students but these are all students who<br>have worked on on Rock coastlines uh<br>we've done all sorts of things we've put<br>seismometers at the top of cliffs to<br>measure how they Shake under wave load<br>loading we've measured hydrodynamics a<br>lot in different places I think Patrick<br>and who's come along today I think one<br>one of our first field campaigns we've<br>done taken laser scanning so that we can<br>work out rates of Cliff Retreat I've<br>done a bunch of numerical modeling as<br>well I wanted to acknowledge in<br>particular the support of Brendan<br>through all of these years and in a<br>couple of photos drilling into rocks and<br>jandles hard hat but done lots of good<br>stuff over over over many years lots of<br>failed campaigns but lots of successful<br>campaigns as well as soon as I arrived<br>at the University I I kind of picked out<br>that Brennan had a whole bunch of the<br>technical skill that I didn't have so<br>we've done a lot of work in in the same<br>uh in fantastic locations in different<br>places uh measuring measuring erosion<br>rates and and so forth so lots of<br>different collaborators working on these<br>uh<br>projects lots of students that we've<br>taken into the landscape as well like<br>taught uh postgraduate students here<br>Paul kinch in the first year that I<br>joined and we've taken a big group of<br>students out to uh to M here on this<br>first trip and then more recently uh<br>here's Murray this is still a decade ago<br>Murray's not here because I think he's<br>in the US at the moment so that great<br>opportunity to poke a bit of fun at him<br>here I was shocked by how interested the<br>students look and what he's got to say<br>in this Photograph here I was also<br>shocked by how young he locks I was very<br>tempted to put up a post CFT and a prec<br>CFT kind of photo but wisely sted clear<br>of that um what I also noticed when I<br>put up these photographs of all the<br>students we've taken out into the field<br>that Within These two photographs alone<br>there are 12 students who went on to<br>write Coastal thesis of various types<br>phds Masters and honors a reminder that<br>we need to get back to the field again<br>after Co stopped us going there<br>um recently okay so what have we what<br>have we learned let's go back to our um<br>model the static equilibrium model the<br>assumptions that H sunamura made and<br>trying to understand this landscape and<br>I want to talk to you briefly about a<br>new technique that we've been<br>applying and it could be difficult to<br>understand this technique but I think<br>I've found a way to simplify this and I<br>want you to imagine that you are a<br>parcel of rock and that you are say here<br>in the middle of the shore platform and<br>at at one point in time because we know<br>the cliff<br>was outside here if you're a parle of<br>rock here at one point in time you were<br>inomed by Rock above you so you not<br>seeing the sky but there's been a Eureka<br>moment when Cliff erosion has eroded the<br>cliff back and suddenly for the first<br>time you've seen the sky which means<br>you've seen the cosmic raylux for the<br>first time as well and that's important<br>because when a parcel of rocks suddenly<br>sees the cosmic raylux we get different<br>atoms being developed within the within<br>the within the rock itself and the atom<br>we're interested in here is a cosmogenic<br>atom called brillium tin it's like a<br>clock goes on and we can start counting<br>the number of years that have passed in<br>which you've been exposed to the exposed<br>to the sky so we've been going around<br>the coastline of New Zealand trying to<br>use this new technique to give us for<br>the first time chronologies of Cliff<br>Retreat so Aiden's Masters and his PhD<br>work he's still working on it so we<br>haven't published uh any of this yet so<br>this is very much a a bit of a sneak<br>preview as we're trying to work out what<br>these data mean so he's taken a sample<br>here ad19 18 17 16 and then a few<br>samples around the corner<br>and this plot here is a thing of<br>incredible beauty if you're me uh<br>because the highest concentration of<br>atoms of brillium 10 is found out at the<br>seawood edge exactly where it should be<br>if sunamura was right so sunamura has<br>this perfectly right and the<br>concentrations get less and less and<br>less the closer you get to clifto to the<br>clifto exactly as sunamura had predicted<br>now you start to dig into the detail a<br>little bit more and the thing starts to<br>unravel a little bit because the erosion<br>rates implied by these data are all over<br>the place the erosion rates impl implied<br>by these data are suggesting that<br>erosion rates are increasing with time<br>rather than decreasing with time as that<br>platform gets wider and wider and so<br>we've had to go at um modeling this and<br>I think I'm convinced myself now that we<br>understand what's going on it looks like<br>during the end of the postglacial<br>transgression 198 and 17 as the sea<br>level was still Rising we started<br>cutting the cliff back and we started<br>forming the sloping Shore platform while<br>the sea level remained High ad6 ad15 We<br>continued to drive the cliff back sea<br>level still being high we've developed<br>this big sloping Shore platform but when<br>the sea level started falling within the<br>last 4,000 years so the platform starts<br>getting cut down Cliff erosion stops the<br>platform starts getting lowered and so<br>I think there's a quite a lovely<br>reconciliation of the theoretical<br>problem here the platform is wave cut<br>during sea level rise but weering<br>flattened during sea level fall<br>therefore in this location with these<br>data I think we reconcile the waves<br>versus weathering debate using this data<br>set hope that made sense for people I'm<br>pretty excited about these results but<br>we haven't published them yet video<br>hopefully we won't get Gump<br>Now That's a classic academic thing to<br>think isn't it um okay what else have we<br>done here we've measured waves across<br>this surface here Rachel pentney some of<br>you all remember did her master's degree<br>on this I remember plotting up Rachel's<br>data myself I had a a moment of Madness<br>with mat lab here it's the most<br>complicated plot I've ever made and I've<br>been punished for it ever since because<br>I keep having to try and explain this<br>plot uh but I think I can simplify by<br>saying just look at the thin uh yellow<br>band here here and we can go from high<br>tide to low tide and we've got ground<br>shaking of the cliff here from high tide<br>to low tide and it gets more and more<br>and more so ironically at the lowest<br>stage of the tide this Cliff is shaking<br>violently but at the highest stage of<br>the tide it's shaking much less this is<br>completely the opposite to what you see<br>in most in different parts of the world<br>and the way I interpret Rachel's data<br>now I think 15 years on from when she<br>did her master's thesis I think the<br>outside edge of the shore platform is<br>currently being destroyed because the<br>platform was raised up and cut at a<br>higher level during higher holos sea<br>level it's been flattened down but not<br>low enough to bring it fully within the<br>grasp of waves so most of the time now<br>waves are destroying this platform<br>they're not creating it anymore so we<br>have a kind of a sea level modulated<br>back wear then downwear model of shore<br>platform Evolution that's nearly<br>consistent with sunam Mara's Theory not<br>quite but nearly<br>it just requires a tweak for sea level<br>okay next set of data we're going to<br>jump down to Koda here and these data I<br>consider a hot mess basically I mean<br>they're all clumped at about the same<br>level they don't get lower in the<br>direction that you'd expect them to<br>neither on the Northern side of the<br>peninsula nor on the southern side of<br>the peninsula and I was appalled<br>basically when when these results came<br>back for the first time but now of<br>course we've got a a beautiful<br>explanation for why the concentration<br>should should all be the same because<br>Shore platforms at this location aren't<br>formed by Cliff back wear they are<br>formed by catastrophic earthquake<br>uplifting the seaf Flor out of the<br>ground therefore all of the<br>concentrations become the same now you<br>would you would have thought I was crazy<br>if I made this argument five or six<br>years ago before the 2016 Cota<br>earthquakes but of course it's<br>convincingly demonstrated now because we<br>saw the uh we saw the land lifted up of<br>the out of the ground last bit of dat I<br>promise uh now I'm going to call the<br>site Dixon's Road and you might consider<br>that the height of some academic<br>arrogance but let's zoom in here and<br>you'll see I kid you not I could not<br>have made this up but the last site that<br>we collected data from uh is at Dixon's<br>road down in Deep South otago and what<br>does Dixon's Road have to tell us a<br>completely different story once again we<br>can still see some history of back wear<br>in these dat dat because we can see a<br>kind of a slope through the data points<br>in this direction but look at the<br>concentrations they are way too high<br>they don't make any sense they can't<br>have for this platform cannot have<br>formed during the hollene at all it must<br>have formed during an earlier sea level<br>period and then been re Exum within the<br>holos that's the only possible way to<br>interpret these data so three sites<br>ockland Coda otago all superficially<br>similar in terms of their geomorphology<br>they don't look that different from each<br>other three radically different<br>evolutionary Pathways revealed by this<br>technique Oakland the classic back wear<br>but with a bit of downwear model Kota<br>uplift and then downwear and Oto I think<br>it's an inherited feature developed<br>during some other sea level cycle uh<br>it's been exhumed during the current uh<br>period of high sea<br>level so that's kind of all I want to<br>say about Rock Coast evolution um I<br>think I would conclude by saying that<br>this issue of equ finality is alive and<br>well and I think it does explain the<br>long-standing debates so what does that<br>mean for the history of 100 Years of<br>kind of inductive field research and<br>rock coastlines the way I think about it<br>is this I I feel like the field<br>observations delivered us hypotheses<br>that we can now test I've been lucky to<br>come along at a at a stage in the<br>scientific process uh where we have high<br>resolution measurements GE<br>geochronological data and numerical<br>modeling that allow us to test some of<br>some of these theories and and refine<br>them okay I want to finish off now by<br>talking about the issue of sea level<br>rise and Coastal Cliff erosion um the<br>stakes are fairly High I mean this is an<br>aerial photograph from Oakland you can<br>see houses being extended new houses<br>being built and if you do a simple<br>exercise of just counting the number of<br>properties and measuring the distance to<br>the cliff Edge you can see the whole<br>histogram sliding across to the left uh<br>if I were to I should get around to<br>updating this but you can guarantee that<br>it would be going up further and sliding<br>to the left further so we're building<br>more and more properties on the cliff<br>top at the same time that the Cliff's<br>slowly inching back toward these<br>properties so my students have been<br>doing a bunch of work mapping laser scan<br>surveys more seismometry more modeling<br>more hydrodynamics I just want to pick<br>on a a couple of results that we've<br>learned many of you remember heroki my<br>first PhD student really along with um<br>Amy doy and we had heroki go out and<br>study um some beautiful landscapes in<br>different parts of New Zealand with<br>these very wide near horizontal Shore<br>platforms uh here here's his whole<br>thesis I think summarized in a slide<br>there probably should be some rule<br>against summarizing a student's PhD<br>thesis in a single slide I'm not going<br>to talk about the data at all I just<br>want to draw your attention to the<br>summary plot down here because what's so<br>important for me now about Hero's work<br>is that we worked out that there are<br>very Dynamic hydram thresholds on Shore<br>platforms so if you have and confusingly<br>in our field little h means water depth<br>and big h means wave height and so if<br>you have relatively shallow<br>water relative to the wave height then<br>you get infrequent well waves that have<br>very long periods we call them<br>infragravity waves they just slush<br>across the platform and then run back<br>out to see they may do important things<br>like moving sediments around but they're<br>not really likely to be very important<br>erosive uh forces but if you have<br>slightly deeper water relative to the<br>wave height you jump across an Abrupt<br>hydrodynamic threshold and you can<br>transmit the normal sea swell gravity<br>waves we call them the normal waves that<br>you're used to swimming in in the ocean<br>we can transmit them across the platform<br>and whack the base of the cliff so what<br>will sea level rise do in this context<br>it's very clear theoretically that sea<br>level rise will transition clifto wave<br>regimes in many locations around the<br>country and force waves many waves to<br>jump across this hydrodynamic threshold<br>uh seise will force clifto wave regimes<br>into new mode so heroki worked that out<br>in his PhD and then more recently some<br>of you remember Katrina as well I think<br>she worked out something very important<br>as well she bolted seismometer onto the<br>top of a cliff she measured wave impacts<br>with a video camera and with pressure<br>sensors and then she manually<br>categorized 7,500 individual impacts and<br>produce this outstanding data set that<br>we're still working on to this present<br>day and what krina really discovered is<br>that there is a very sensitive uh<br>relationship between water depth and<br>wave height that can result in perfect<br>waves impacting against Cliffs they trap<br>a little pocket of air they indu these<br>massive pressures on the cliffs That You<br>Don't See for the rest of the time I've<br>got a little video to show of this<br>shortly so Katrina identified rare<br>perfect wavebreaking conditions that can<br>violently shape Cliffs One impact during<br>her month-long experiment was an order<br>of magnitude larger than all the other<br>impacts so this is what we're currently<br>doing um it's funny you get to this<br>stage of your career you you'd think<br>you'd be finished I'm sometimes very<br>jealous when I look at my friends going<br>from job to job and they get to leave<br>everything behind we need to get never<br>get to leave anything behind but<br>something that's fun is that sometimes<br>you get to carry on working with<br>students who studied with you so in this<br>particular study PhD student Katrina PhD<br>student hero both gone to UC San Diego<br>to work with this chap Adam uh and new<br>collaboration I'm glad to see Yong here<br>today he's doing a post over in<br>engineering with my colleague Colin<br>whaka a colleague danad otago we're<br>taking a lot of this work forward I<br>wanted to show you just a few little<br>videos to finish with so here's one of<br>Katrina's waves notice this tiny little<br>wave really you think it should do<br>nothing but look at this<br>one this is sort of 20 M High Cliff this<br>is probably about 7 or 8 met high in the<br>mudstone here whack the hell out of the<br>cliff here now we're trying to reproduce<br>this in the laboratory through yong's<br>work so here's<br>um the type of perfect breaking that you<br>can induce during laboratory conditions<br>and here are I think is a a really<br>beautiful little uh video that yong's<br>puted together with a gravel beach in<br>front of a cliff showing it's not all<br>about big impacts it could also be about<br>how sediments get entrained within waves<br>that are coming in and notice that uh if<br>you how many was this a month or<br>something a month a month of simulations<br>here eventually you can erode a notch in<br>the base of this model Cliff which will<br>slowly deepen through<br>time so we've got the laboratory<br>modeling going on and we've we just<br>developed a numerical model as well we<br>haven't published this uh as yet uh and<br>I'm not going to get into the details of<br>this um model result because I want to<br>leave a few minutes at the end here but<br>what I would do want to say is Will sea<br>level rise increase Cliff erosion rates<br>a lot of my early work just said kind of<br>yes and most other people around the<br>world are just saying yes as well but<br>through the Dynamics of these types of<br>experiments I think we can now say and<br>through our model results it's going to<br>be way more complex than that yes in<br>many places like the site okari point we<br>studied yes I think we'll step through<br>thresholds and turn Cliff erosion back<br>on once again but in other situations we<br>see sea level rise actually likely<br>flooding some Cliffs meaning you raise<br>the water level high enough on cliffs<br>that you start to reflect the waves off<br>the cliff you no longer get breaking and<br>Cliff erosion in those sites May well<br>slow down in the future so I don't think<br>it's a simple sea level rise will<br>accelerate Cliff erosion rates<br>okay my final slide I wrote a couple of<br>things down here uh because easy to<br>forget over a career uh the impossible<br>task of trying to thank everyone who's<br>uh who's ever worked with you who who<br>you've ever taught uh I've tried to<br>display a little um snapshot in the uh<br>talk today of of some of the people who<br>have uh been helpful and informative for<br>me but it's very much a short list um<br>I'm particularly grateful I guess<br>looking back to the setup work that was<br>put into me by people like Colin woodr<br>my PhD supervisor and in particular Mike<br>walked in over at Bristol who was just<br>very patient with me as I got my<br>modeling skills up to up to scratch um<br>fantastic set of colleagues across many<br>different universities they they all<br>know who they are uh fantastic set of<br>colleagues here at the University of<br>Oakland I struck me in preparing this<br>talk that I've supervised so many<br>students on topics that are completely<br>different from this as well that I<br>haven't even mentioned today but I kind<br>of had to pick an area to to describe so<br>that that's kind of what I what I've<br>done but I did want to acknowledge uh<br>the various people that I've had the<br>opportunity to supervise with over the<br>years um taught with many different<br>colleagues in many different areas uh<br>even maybe some pleasure in some of the<br>admin I've done with different<br>colleagues across different service<br>roles so I've got to know a lot of very<br>good people here as well um finally I<br>thought I'd say that it feels like many<br>academics develop their careers largely<br>on the back of what postgrads do uh<br>that's definitely What I've Done uh it<br>definitely feels like what I've done so<br>I'm I'm super grateful for the large<br>range of
