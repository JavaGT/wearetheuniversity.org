its<br>beginning and the history uh and the<br>stories that were passed on to us you<br>know for us at Cuda we were told that to<br>uh was the sister uh or is the sister<br>of and the story of<br>to and her husband who we say it's p and<br>her children the is a story of love uh<br>it's a story of betrayal and it's a<br>story of healing much like the coalition<br>sure whoever is the villain in their<br>story I don't know yet we'll see<br>Winston's got his hand up to be that man<br>at the moment David's doing a good job<br>as well but we're here right now to show<br>the world what a treaty uh Centric model<br>looks like uh we all e Come Together We<br>all walks of life come together where<br>all nationalities come together with one<br>goal in mind and that is the restoration<br>waterways we are the water and the water<br>today<br>fore<br>are<br>fore<br>spee<br>fore<br>fore<br>we<br>for<br>fore<br>foree<br>goodbye all right now um I'm not too<br>sure if everybody knows everybody that's<br>sitting right next to them so I just<br>other now just is why some of the other<br>fun I want you to turn to your right now<br>and go<br>that's how we do it BEC<br>we doesn't matter if you uh if you're<br>actually blood related or not we all<br>cussies especially if you got a lot of<br>money we love you if you got a lot of<br>money J got a<br>$2<br>uh you know um our first Speaker uh<br>somebody I grew up with and and one of<br>the uh best pastimes when I was growing<br>up I was jumping off the train bridge<br>which was something low actually but uh<br>jumping off the train bridge enjoying<br>our wake up to a and just so you know<br>especially with the brothers in here<br>we're the best bombers in the whole of<br>the country bring it on if you want some<br>competition all right yeah M manges<br>gorillas Staples we got it all from We<br>got it all we know how to do it back<br>home<br>in heway uh those were one of the best<br>uh times growing up especially during<br>the summer months going out there and<br>having a swim and and I'm saddened uh<br>actually that my tamiki don't get to<br>enjoy uh that while they're growing up<br>it's very rare that you see our tomiki<br>in the river these days and we're<br>probably the last generation to really<br>really enjoy that although they're out<br>in the in the doing wak and whatnot in<br>terms of swimming and bombing off the<br>off the spots down at a POA that's<br>pretty much n and void these days so<br>your m is important to make sure that<br>the Next Generation coming through and<br>will be able to enjoy that so once again<br>I'd like to thank you for all the hard<br>work you're doing to restor uh for the<br>restorative uh stuff for our so our<br>first<br>Speaker we a long day ahead of us so<br>we're going to get our first uh speaker<br>up and ready to go all right our next<br>speaker as I said and grew up at wahan<br>with the impacts of the Huntley power<br>project and coal mining of local on<br>local communities she collected oral<br>histories from Kat and supported the<br>establishment of the tribal T Hoy to<br>return this history to descendant off<br>the river Tipper has held a wide range<br>of governance roles including e and<br>local government positions she is the<br>co- cheer uh e appointe of the W River<br>Authority and co-chair of the multi<br>health authority which I'm hoping will<br>future<br>that was for me more than so I remember<br>today<br>fore<br>for I'd just like to again add my H<br>welcome to those that have been sping<br>today I see many of our friends of the<br>river but most of all I see the of<br>my<br>River um we've got lot to get through so<br>I'm not going to take too too long and<br>I'm going to assume a whole lot here but<br>if at any point in the H you would like<br>to dive into the history or any other of<br>the aspects that I'm going to touch on<br>this morning my team is here and we're<br>here with you but uh briefly and he he's<br>not going to like that I want to do this<br>but just so we don't sit through the<br>whole you're wondering who's that I'd<br>like to introduce my my coacher of the<br>river Authority NE too more you're too<br>little to<br>sit so if if you can find me as<br>you thank you um but really it's been a<br>long time since we've been able to sit<br>together so today is you know really<br>exciting for all of us and we thank the<br>university and all our other friends uh<br>that have come today I just want to<br>touch briefly you've seen the logo so if<br>you have a look at it it brings together<br>I guess what we trying to bring together<br>today to make more normal is that there<br>is knowledge there's the m know that<br>always left here and there's the science<br>that has been brought here today as<br>they're coming together of the best<br>parts of those so that our River and I<br>say our River can be the beneficiary of<br>that so that we are the Kaki of the<br>future that the old people aspire to so<br>did that just to help you come into that<br>theme most of you are part of creating<br>that theme wherever you're from I can<br>see the K here and I'm a little bit all<br>struck<br>actually um but my job really is to put<br>the place of the authority how we got<br>here what we see our ongoing rollers and<br>what's important to us going forward so<br>covering those things um I guess is<br>helps frame the H but then you know<br>where it's all going to go to too it's<br>they is having beautiful C for two days<br>and go<br>well who's going to do something with<br>that well we're going to do something<br>with that okay so that's our commitment<br>to you um it's a k system what you in<br>we're going to add to and hopefully<br>every river in this beautiful nation of<br>ours will benefit it's not for w only<br>that we do these things um for those of<br>you that don't know that work of mys in<br>the early days was coming going to all<br>the other<br>rivers they went on support of moaka you<br>named the W they went in support because<br>whoever did this work would lead for all<br>of us so to those of you who C that in<br>your here we thank you we thank you for<br>continuing the work and we thank thank<br>you for all the that you are bringing<br>well so I just want to go forward into<br>um how did I get here it's been everyone<br>goes well you know what's your link to<br>the river and really I'm just uh memory<br>keeper it was my privilege to walk<br>alongside our old people hear them talk<br>about those aspects of our River cord<br>ital that wen't shared widely he only an<br>our cord it all only when you went to<br>and um you know only when you went to go<br>and make dinner did all that knowledge<br>come forward only when you went to go<br>and to the kids that all that<br>information come forward only when we<br>went to go and visit and bless the sites<br>did we know that we used to haaku in<br>those sites so if anything it's been a<br>privilege to gather that cordor and then<br>try and make sure that it went somewhere<br>back to it quite so that that's been my<br>role so today it's just an extension of<br>that I have the unique privilege of<br>coaching sharing the river Authority<br>again so uh we know uh without speaking<br>into why that cordor has been<br>disconnected and this like many other<br>are part of reconnecting all of that<br>cord all so part of that too is bringing<br>history toes for<br>me<br>it I'm absolutely confident that through<br>the river Authority we have at last a<br>cohesive plan that connects all of the<br>stakeholders together where at the the<br>core of the blueprint is how do we<br>protect the health and well-being and<br>improve the health and wellbeing of the<br>river for everyone when we embarked on a<br>set of negotiations with the crown we<br>believe that it was our time to<br>contribute back to ensure that the river<br>was protected the role of the authority<br>is to ensure the local government<br>organizations follow a vision strategy<br>set by the river Authority for uh what<br>people want to see on the wter river<br>water<br>is is absolutely essential to The Wider<br>region obviously there are tradeoffs<br>that are going to have to be made along<br>the way you can't continue to intensify<br>the land use as we have in the past our<br>elders taught us that it was our River<br>of Life our spiritual Refuge it was our<br>healing water we are the river and the<br>river is us we are inextricably bound<br>river<br>foreign<br>fore<br>all we want to<br>do is for<br>everyone to pull their hand<br>out and clean up our River in the<br>particular case of of the river<br>settlement<br>it moved well beyond I'm really going to<br>have to move well beyond the sort of<br>classic framework of 3d7 so re C was<br>quite unique and exit so so we didn't<br>touch ownership because we always had<br>different views around that and we've<br>always said we don't need a piece of<br>paper to tell us where hour given the<br>uniqueness<br>of the citan instruments that were<br>created you know a new statutory body<br>that is a body corporate uh such as the<br>W River Authority<br>is quite new it it hasn't been repeated<br>and there is quite a lot of attention uh<br>on the success or otherwise of the river<br>Authority well I'd really encourage you<br>to reach out to the authority if you've<br>got an idea for a project that you're<br>passionate about to restore the houra we<br>would love to sit down and and hear all<br>about<br>it<br>so that breaks it down into a nutshell<br>you got all of that lock it up<br>you'll be tested before the end of the<br>H<br>um so and again so bring that forward so<br>I think 13 years now of history of the<br>river Authority has so we need less to<br>tell you about who we are and be more<br>about what we do and that's that's the<br>way forward for the river Authority we<br>have a um a role of purpose and a<br>function that we want to come out and<br>create more<br>opportunities more ways of people<br>talking and and performing a again their<br>passion and as it leads them towards the<br>river so sorry just checking which one's<br>play so again I want to acknowledge um<br>the late um the former co-chair uh tuku<br>Morgan who's still with us in the late<br>Donn Lon for their establishment of the<br>Authority for establishing us again with<br>Partners at the time who again were<br>skeptical about what could be achieved<br>th over Authority so we gained a lot in<br>those early years of partnership work of<br>working with our communities from the<br>dairy new zealands right through to our<br>M and that was the work of the authority<br>I would say um in those years we've<br>developed expertise now in terms of the<br>actual project management and bringing<br>those projects forward and we and<br>supporting our community be to become<br>the best Kaki they can be in<br>place so in terms of the authority<br>ourselves some people are interested in<br>this but what is co-governance I mean<br>lot's been said about the idea but not<br>really the practice if you know what I<br>mean so essentially we're I nominated a<br>group of people in a room to make great<br>decisions for the river there's no<br>mystery in it um again that's what the<br>planet's going to take a whole lot of<br>sensible uh humans to look after<br>themselves so they can look after the<br>planet so again the logic isn't deifying<br>um how we hold ourselves to that purpose<br>though and difficult times and I give<br>you an easy example the board of inquiry<br>for Oakland's need for<br>water<br>now we know many in Oakland are our<br>people too but where does that tension<br>play out and how does their<br>responsibility play out so those are the<br>kind of tensions that our Bard is<br>designed to look into and work with we<br>are all bound collectively by those<br>decisions and as much as possible we<br>work through<br>consensus um we're not always from the<br>same point of view cuz again we're from<br>different parts of the the river we have<br>different matters that impact on us<br>uniquely and um we therefore our<br>advocacy is uh again must be brought<br>forward in different ways for reasons<br>not of our own many of our special<br>places to our manaa have been<br>disconnected they have been disconnected<br>from so teaching a covering partner<br>who's always had connection what that<br>generation yeah when they can return to<br>places that they had not previously<br>enjoyed but again once the uh once that<br>learning is done by the um River<br>Authority we internalize and it becomes<br>the way we do things we also like<br>hearing about the new opportunities for<br>learning not just from New Zealand but<br>from overseas and recently we supported<br>a member of our board to attend<br>different Forum so that they could bring<br>that knowledge back um I don't have to<br>tell you all about the clarate there's<br>probably a clam expert in the room or 10<br>yes uh but so again that's that that is<br>the<br>new the new that we are preparing to<br>address again our people want to discuss<br>it's Kaki potential though what what can<br>it do before we you knowz that's what<br>quite you look at what what what was it<br>in the environment for<br>anyway what unique purpose does it bring<br>we know it's not um native to New<br>system noral<br>the again we've had to we work with<br>councils and their jurisdictions as well<br>to understand or help them broaden their<br>understanding of what this kak kak could<br>look like through their instruments so<br>we constant submitters on a whole lot of<br>matters as well as no doubt we have a<br>big um Suite of legislation I'm guessing<br>that we will need to comment on and not<br>for for goinging months so what we look<br>forward today though is the opportunity<br>for you to discuss things for you to<br>bring your gr ideas into the room and<br>for you to share with us so that we can<br>grow the Authority's ability to reach<br>not only the W River but every river in<br>this great nation and we thank the<br>university for that partnership cuz we<br>expect that whatever we share here in<br>the white can be shed whereever else<br>that is necessary and<br>so technical difficulties aside and<br>guess what I didn't cause any of<br>them not being native am but I I just<br>want to complete my and into the room<br>and all your water that you break that<br>also and all the all the water that<br>flows from you through to us here and<br>for it is our privilege to host today<br>days<br>uh a couple things I took away from that<br>uh first up technical glitches you know<br>something happens in my Friday I've got<br>seven kids so uh us yell out to one of<br>the tomiki and cuz I got seven kids I'm<br>I'm quite like my parents actually IED<br>laugh at them but now it's my turn you<br>know as they say k oh you know uh so I<br>end up yelling out every other name but<br>the kid that I want so instead I've<br>given them numbers I'll be just yelling<br>at number five can tell come and fix the<br>the TV please uh the other thing I I<br>thought about with tippers corded of<br>course is that are absolutely right this<br>is not one of those hoie with no Dey<br>this is a hoie where you're going to go<br>away and do the do the m f now also<br>talking about some of our coats and<br>sitting with them and hearing their<br>stories and they always you know they<br>always start with you know boy am my dat<br>it's like they went on this massive ass<br>hike just to get D Cuda you know I would<br>swim across the river that mountain up<br>on that tree I'll look over to that<br>cloud over there climb back down jumping<br>some cow tickle just to warm my feet up<br>again and then I'm off the<br>ca tell you that's what they need to<br>tell<br>us uh looking back at of course some of<br>the uh pictures in the uh uh in the uh<br>video that was paid out the 1995 uh<br>settlement uh uh an auspicious day for<br>our for our e the first of course settle<br>and then of course uh the W Riv settle<br>as well and that was very special for us<br>down the day that we were given W for<br>own and uh when we went to go and launch<br>that W all the other W was standing<br>there and you know they made a big deal<br>about it they had fires going all the<br>way down the river they brought it out<br>of the shed you know this was like 4:00<br>in the morning we're dragging it down<br>there's Haka going we're standing there<br>waiting for a Waka to be delivered to us<br>and then finally it lands in front of us<br>then they came the call came for us to<br>lift the wer and then take it into the<br>river<br>said the wer didn't move all the other<br>all the other that's true story didn't<br>move so we thought that oh uh maybe we<br>have to give this wak up but uh all the<br>other Waka came and finally we got the<br>water the Waka into uh the ywa and then<br>uh now we have five Waka as part of our<br>Fleet uh every regat and whenever uh our<br>King wants the wers to be out on the<br>water and that's another way that we<br>enjoy the spiritual connection that we<br>our our next uh speaker is a counselor<br>on the W of the Regional Council and<br>supports oh Mike sorry got this wrong<br>Mike how I<br>Mike<br>counsel I think it might be a pay cut<br>though<br>um Koto Mike<br>scar um I've lived uh alongside the<br>banks of the woto river for nearly 30<br>years I I moved up here from the south<br>island uh to come and work for Bryce<br>Cooper at Nea in 1995 and we thought<br>we'd stay for a few years and then go<br>back to the South Island but we never<br>left and um Hamilton k k Ro is is our<br>home um<br>tenot for the for the welcome and kak<br>here and it's wonderful to be here at<br>the I guess the the knowledge hub for<br>Wu uh and also to be sharing the<br>so with your knowledge basket and and my<br>knowledge basket together we can um uh<br>make all the people well in the<br>environment as<br>well what I've uh been asked to do today<br>is give a we bit of a context of guess<br>where this Symposium um comes from and<br>what we're trying to achieve um and I go<br>into a a little bit of detail around<br>um this concept this piece of work that<br>we've been working on for a while now um<br>Bob Pinter and Julian Williams and<br>myself around restoration timelines and<br>I'll talk about that a little bit but I<br>just wanted to highlight uh Tipper<br>introduced um and the video introduced<br>uh to to f Mana um it was uh it's great<br>to see the the the videos from the past<br>and and not like to acknowledge those<br>who've passed on including um John Lux<br>who I used to work for when I worked at<br>at deran Zed so lots of great people<br>who've who've moved<br>on um to 25 Mana I just wanted to say<br>one of the things that really I found<br>find most impactful about T5 Mana the<br>vision strategy is the collective<br>responsibility it requires so everyone<br>in the catchment is responsible for the<br>health and well-being of the river and I<br>think that was mentioned as well earlier<br>on um so there's there's<br>no value in finger pointing there's no<br>value in criticizing others because<br>everybody is responsible for the health<br>and well-being of the river and unless<br>we all Embrace that we're not going to<br>achieved<br>um make sure I'm pointing at the right<br>place I think the other key point is<br>we're<br>seeing already<br>bu a building of a long history and I'm<br>thinking even just from U the time of<br>the late 80s where the um the white<br>Tangi tribunal claim over the river um<br>was lodged as far as I understand it<br>there there was a a establishment<br>Guardians establishment committee and<br>they delivered the vision and strategy<br>in<br>2010 at the same time um<br>Nea um and a number of others brought<br>together a massive body of knowledge in<br>the WETA River Independent scoping study<br>and some of the things that that uh<br>scoping study<br>covered uh are really relevant today and<br>and sort of form the Genesis as some of<br>our thinking about restoration of the<br>river going forward so I just want to<br>acknowledge the great work done in that<br>and that<br>study um there's also the wo<br>River w River restoration strategy<br>delivered in 2018 which has really<br>helped Focus attention and and effort um<br>and certainly uh helped um those of of<br>us who have resourc to put into<br>restoration why Regional Council uh why<br>a river cleanup trust and others um to<br>really focus action and identify<br>priorities but if we're thinking about<br>we we're now sort of 13 years into this<br>um sort of formal restoration Journey<br>Journey um I've I've titled this the end<br>of the beginning and it relates to a a<br>quote from Winston Churchill in 1942 the<br>Allies had just won the Battle of North<br>Africa and he said it wasn't obviously<br>wasn't the end of the war it wasn't even<br>the beginning of the end but you could<br>think of it as the end of the beginning<br>so part of the reason for bringing<br>people together this week is to consider<br>where next where are we heading in terms<br>of river<br>restoration<br>with the um restoring the hour very<br>briefly I wanted to talk about some of<br>the the real um might to read on<br>here eyes not what they used to be um<br>some of the the real fundamentals of<br>restoration so you need to know where<br>you're at now and you need to know why<br>you are where you are so um then<br>information about our current state and<br>the cause<br>um the the the drivers and the pressures<br>that have caused us to be where we are<br>now until we understand those it's going<br>to be very difficult for us to know how<br>we turn things around we also need<br>clarity about what we're aiming for and<br>to 2y man gives us that that vision and<br>also that Suite of objectives for us to<br>aim for and then there's a suite of sort<br>of um next tier indicators called TOA or<br>the the um strands of a rope which help<br>us understand some of the the core um<br>indicators or attributes that we're<br>trying to<br>improve how we will get there that's<br>always a fundamental question um what's<br>the achievability what are the time<br>frames what are the costs associated<br>with with restoration it probably takes<br>up a lot of um our our Collective time<br>in terms of uh talking about and um<br>seeking funding for some of the<br>restoration efforts that go on<br>I've highlighted the next one in terms<br>of action CH change and transformation<br>so you can have all the strategies all<br>the plans but if we don't see change on<br>the on the ground we don't see um action<br>and if we don't see a transformation and<br>how we<br>use um the land how we interact with the<br>land and the river we won't see um the<br>changes that we need and then we also<br>need to adapt and review and respond and<br>um this is recognized to be an<br>intergenerational issue what we have to<br>do is find a way to maintain and engage<br>not just our generation but future<br>generations to continue the work and and<br>um sort of they will be the ones who see<br>this through to the<br>end as I mentioned the white cat River<br>Independent scoping study a massive body<br>of work um more than a thousand pages of<br>very technical information um and I'd<br>like to acknowledge um my good friend<br>and Mentor John Quinn who passed away<br>several years ago he was one of the the<br>main authors of that W River Independent<br>scoping<br>study what they looked at was the uh the<br>the level of investment that might be<br>required to<br>achieve um the the core indicators the<br>the Torah associated with uh to Mana one<br>of the key things highlighted in the in<br>the graph here is so these are sort of<br>Investments over time and this is the<br>the thinking then about how that benefit<br>might acre over<br>time really when when we think about the<br>restoration timeline and and how we<br>might describe it that's that's the<br>piece of work that um Bob and Julian I<br>have started and which we'll continue on<br>this week and and Beyond to try and<br>understand how is the river going to<br>change through time through the various<br>interventions and actions because by<br>doing that we can essentially help our<br>community understand what's going to<br>happen and when it's going to happen and<br>show them that the Investments are<br>actually going to uh make a<br>difference but too much detail on there<br>so I'll skip that one the next one the<br>so these are the the six TOA uh which<br>have been developed and sit under the<br>to5 Mana so these are the measures of<br>success and really<br>reflect the the values that the<br>community wants to see restored and and<br>enhanced so Kai our uh as local locally<br>abundant and plentiful and safe food<br>resources ecological Integrity so the<br>system is operating as it should water<br>quality water security sites of<br>significance and<br>experience so experience is often under<br>or overlooked often from a from a<br>science perspective but it is often one<br>of the things that really resonates most<br>with people access to sites of<br>significance um being able to swim in<br>the hour being able to um take um<br>spiritual healing and guidance from the<br>river um these are all core values that<br>we need to<br>restore for each of these TOA there are<br>a set of uh indicator values<br>and those indicator values can be<br>monitored and assessed over time and<br>where this led to was the first report<br>card done in 2016 of the the state of<br>the river in relation to those TOA and<br>individual um individual<br>indicators and so the overall grade at<br>the time was a C+ for a for as a report<br>card for the river so um some areas of<br>of the river are still in a in a very<br>good condition others are in a very<br>degraded condition and so there's a long<br>way to go to achieve the um the<br>outcomes um the restoration timelines<br>concept is as I say something that um<br>Bob um Pinter and myself and Julian<br>Williams sort of developed and and put<br>in front of the wa board but it does<br>very much come from the the W River<br>Independent scoping<br>study just show one example here of of<br>some of the thinking around trying to<br>explain to the community how things<br>might um develop through time so with<br>with time on the bottom here and and<br>used 80 years because um sort of deeply<br>involved in plan change one and 80 years<br>is the time frame there the the the<br>scorecard grades and we sort of are<br>coming from um a certain grade and<br>there's an expectation that we're going<br>to get to that a grade what is it going<br>to look like how long is it going to<br>take and what are the things that we can<br>do to change that trajectory to change<br>that time frame how do we communicate to<br>people that if we do this this and this<br>these are the changes we're going to see<br>and this is when you can expect to see<br>some of these benefits because almost<br>always there are there are significant<br>lags in we make the changes but we might<br>not see the benefits for some time and<br>that can be quite challenging for the<br>community um and for funders to say well<br>not um I won't run short of time but I<br>just wanted to highlight um I guess as<br>we as we're on this very long journey to<br>Restoration of the river we need to keep<br>our communities we need to keep our<br>people we need to keep our decision<br>makers<br>engaged and to do that um part of that<br>will be about um sharing our knowledge<br>and understanding about how the river is<br>going to be restored and the process<br>that it goes through I think it's a a<br>fundamental challenge for an<br>intergenerational um concept such as the<br>restoration of the river is how do you<br>keep everyone engaged for that period of<br>time doing the right things investing<br>the money in the right places so I'll<br>you<br>Mike<br>and um yeah<br>C+ yeah say my dad that's a<br>pass no I was more of a B minor student<br>uh our morning presenters now I<br>understand uh what my mistake was this<br>before uh you might not know it but I<br>turned up yesterday thinking that uh I<br>was a day ahead I was sitting outside in<br>the car park wondering where everybody<br>was and I had to ring up to a few people<br>say ah am I at the right place true<br>story I'm sitting there by myself and uh<br>my Uncle T had to come boy you all right<br>what you doing here I say oh I'm here<br>for the wake of the rpr him I think<br>that's tomorrow boy so I jumped back in<br>my car and cruised off get here today<br>and as you saw just before I introduced<br>the the wrong person that's from day two<br>so day one all right come on all right<br>okay coming up next uh will be our<br>morning uh presenters uh that'll be Sam<br>stage strategy manager commercial<br>science and innovation of uh fontia now<br>Sam has a bachelor of Environmental<br>Management from Lincoln University and a<br>background in on Farm sustainability<br>including working with ewi stakeholders<br>across ala he is passionate about<br>improving outcomes for and has recently<br>supported theu estate Wetland<br>k<br>for<br>fore<br>good morning everyone um yeah as<br>mentioned my name is Sam and I work as a<br>m strategy manager at our Cooperative<br>font um and look it's a privilege and an<br>honor to be given the opportunity today<br>to talk about this amazing wiland<br>restoration project uh we still very<br>very early on into the project but I'm<br>Keen to share with you uh where we're at<br>today um I must admit I'm not an expert<br>when it comes to Restoration projects<br>and I know we've got plenty of those in<br>the room today so take their word uh<br>rather than mine um also conscious too<br>we've got some amazing speakers uh and<br>this panel lineup coming up so the<br>cordal is going to start pretty low and<br>hopefully get better and better from<br>here um and I want to blame Tim Mano for<br>putting me on the spot here um I<br>absolutely hate talking to crowds and<br>particular of this caliber and so if I<br>sound nervous if I look nervous I'm<br>absolutely packing myself so uh here are<br>not for the next 13 minutes or so um<br>I've got nowhere to run and hide so<br>we'll get into it um so to P your head<br>Wetland restoration I guess that name in<br>itself needs no introduction here into W<br>um and across the mot in fact I'm I'm<br>very reluctant to speak of the legacy of<br>to your head in fear of not doing it the<br>Justice it deserves and again I think<br>there are far more capable people in<br>this room that can do that than I what I<br>will focus on though is the farm that<br>was left as part of her Legacy which<br>still um I guess forms a huge part of<br>supporting the K and and T Mai<br>operations um what from what I have been<br>told um to puya along with a number of<br>people including many of the children<br>that she helped toang and raay uh were<br>involved in working this fena a number<br>of years ago I believe there were marai<br>Gardens Etc set up on this farm and at<br>some point in time it was converted into<br>a dairy farm uh we as fona are very<br>fortunate to receive the milk from that<br>farm considering its history um and I<br>guess by naming this project in her<br>honor uh for me I think brings with it a<br>lot of money but also a lot of uh<br>responsibility to do things right um so<br>I'm just going to hopefully try and<br>actually I'll start here in terms of the<br>location hopefully you can see from this<br>pixelated image um the farm is actually<br>on River Road in Gard here so just up<br>the River from here um it's in very Pro<br>close proximity to the hour everything<br>from that farm drains into the hour via<br>two outlets um it's about 216 hectares<br>in size and the farm um currently Peak<br>milks about 500 cows twice a day or just<br>under um before I skip to the next piece<br>um in terms of a restoration project uh<br>we've been blessed with every common uh<br>pissed weed you can think of um<br>hopefully this next video works if I get<br>this right um let's see so this is a<br>drone fly over from the Wetland uh last<br>week as you can see in here we've got<br>quite a lot of P plant species GS privet<br>Willow Pine you name it it's likely to<br>be in here in the center of the Wetland<br>we can see some of our tree fern species<br>so we've got paa fi we have kahik<br>regenerating ming mingi m kanuk there's<br>some quite good stuff but the outsides<br>species finishes there um in terms of<br>Mahi today it's probably worth me<br>stepping you back a few years to<br>understand how this projects come about<br>and I guess people might question well<br>how the hell has fona become involved in<br>here other than it being a fona farm um<br>I know I've got a few of my fontier<br>colleagues in the room so I'm hoping if<br>I get tricky questions on the panel<br>they're going to back me up but um if<br>we're really honest about the history of<br>fona when it comes to dealing with Mana<br>well we haven't got the best track<br>record um if you look at our<br>relationships to date um very hard to<br>call them call them genuine when they've<br>been centered around the resource<br>consenting process at a time when we<br>want something um and so previously in<br>the past our relationships would ramp up<br>pre- consenting and then drop off again<br>once we got what we wanted and I know<br>I'm probably being unfair to some of our<br>sites who who through good people and<br>Leadership have bucked that Trend but<br>that's the Stark reality of where we've<br>come from I guess we're part of the<br>problem we need to be part of the<br>solution and so this project was<br>actually born out of um our Ted up a<br>manufacturing site which sits Upstream<br>of Tong mod going through their um their<br>Recon senting process to allow our I<br>guess treated discharge of Wastewater<br>into wota um probably quite a<br>controversial thing to talk about you<br>know within the group here but that's<br>the reality of where it was born out of<br>um Tang trust board were one of the main<br>submitters um I guess against that<br>consent and rightly so and it took a<br>number of years of going through that<br>process before my time uh to end up<br>where we are today in 2021 I was lucky<br>enough to be around when we signed a<br>memorandum of understanding with the<br>trust board and that basically set the<br>foundations for our relationship um<br>going forward I think we're still like<br>in our infancy but from our side I can<br>hand on heart say it's it's heading in<br>the right direction I'll let the<br>trustees speak to speak to it from their<br>end um and so at that same time in 2021<br>we applied to wotter River Authority for<br>funding and thankfully we're granted<br>funding in<br>2022 um this document up here was<br>produced by wildlands so we had<br>basically a baseline study done to help<br>us with the management plan to help the<br>trustees you know attack where they<br>wanted to head from here in terms of us<br>getting involved the trust has expressed<br>an interest um that they needed support<br>with going through that funding process<br>and just some support around you know<br>what were some of the things that they<br>could do to restore this particular<br>piece of fenua the aim of the project<br>really was to restore it back into<br>something that um I guess Fu can be<br>proud of it is a bit of an Isa If we're<br>honest when we look at it from the road<br>um and really to honor that Legacy of<br>Tangi considering all the effort that's<br>that's gone into that farm uh in the<br>past this year so<br>2023 um is our second year of funding<br>and we've targeted most of our efforts<br>on uh weed control particularly around<br>the perimeter of the catchman here and<br>then within that kind of Red Zone in<br>some of these open areas um kind of<br>through here where we're gearing up for<br>planting out about a hectare of natives<br>next year um all the plants will be<br>sourced from the nursery here in hopu<br>hopu I did see John T somewhere up the<br>back there so thank you for for<br>supporting us here um and basically what<br>wildlands noted when they did this<br>report that because of the impacts of<br>drainage on the fua um this particular<br>catchment is reverting more into a<br>terrestrial Forest rather than a wetland<br>um if you were to walk through there<br>today there's very little water left in<br>there um and so the call was made to<br>sort of go carry on down that Journey<br>rather than trying to convert it back<br>into a wetland and I guess if you<br>consider the significance of what the<br>farm operations do to support the M um<br>that was sort of where the trustees<br>landed jump into the next slide here um<br>in terms of other Mahi we've been doing<br>kind of separate to um the funded<br>projects for the last couple of years<br>we've been chipping away at planting<br>other parts of the farm as part of our<br>memorandum of understanding um so we've<br>put in about 1,400 trees here in an area<br>that's very close to the FY that to put<br>your heading you used to live on on Farm<br>um so a very significant piece of the<br>farm if you do drive past it don't be<br>too judgmental it doesn't look amazing<br>at the stage but we're hoping eventually<br>um it'll look really good and I know<br>there's a few people in this room that<br>have helped contribute to those<br>plantings<br>today um I'll share with you another<br>quick one I done<br>there oh there it is um this year we<br>teamed up with trees for survival and<br>Nadu here High School um if you haven't<br>learned about that Copa i' would<br>encourage you to do so really cool um<br>sure what's going on there but really<br>cool project um where they look for<br>sponsorship from Partners like fontia to<br>help provide Cuda with raw ingredients<br>to start growing plants and then once<br>they're ready they ship them off to to<br>local farms or local land areas to start<br>on restoration projects so by involving<br>the high school this year it's been been<br>kind of twofold we've we've had angah<br>involved which is one of the key<br>objectives of the project but also a<br>number of these kids have poer<br>connections here which is extremely<br>important so I'm hoping we're going to<br>build some of the successor for some of<br>the work I've been doing um into this<br>going<br>forward um conscious of time I'm just<br>going to spend the last couple of<br>minutes uh speaking through some of the<br>successes and learnings of the project<br>today as I mentioned we're going into<br>year three of funding next year so still<br>in our really early days of this project<br>so still got lots to learn um um I think<br>relationships like anything have been<br>integral we've been very lucky to work<br>with some really good people um as I<br>said I'm not an expert it's a teaming up<br>with the right people um firstly want to<br>acknowledge the wa not just for funding<br>us but um people like Michelle hodgers<br>who I don't know how many times I've<br>picked up the phone to you and you've<br>answered all my silly questions<br>persevered with how slow to get um I<br>guess the funding stuff and and go<br>through the am buts and pieces I really<br>appreciate um your help today um Julian<br>Williams was here somewhere um your<br>instrumental mate in helping just Pi the<br>stuff off early days so appreciate that<br>um I must acknowledge wotter Regional<br>Council who are a co-sponsor in this<br>project um both from a cash and and kind<br>perspective um so people like Paula<br>Grant Blacky I haven't seen them here<br>today but just do want to acknowledge<br>them are there somewhere ker um I guess<br>some of our fona staff who have come in<br>and helped on this journey um people<br>like Tracy Dean Spears who have given<br>advice um and just help chew the fat on<br>different ideas and then again to the<br>trustees of the morai for putting faith<br>in us to help them on this J journey and<br>I do want to acknowledge the late Paya<br>nepia who's no no longer with us but was<br>around at that point um I'll put the<br>relationships Partnerships and outcomes<br>um we started off with a very<br>transactional relationship I think we're<br>starting to grow towards a partnership<br>with Tonga trust board but in terms of<br>outcomes just conscious of time um for<br>fonti to be able to bring staff into a<br>c-pop m environment and be invited into<br>things like coron regetta poy to go and<br>help in the and prep Kai Etc has been<br>just I guess invaluable um we've had Kai<br>mahimi like myself are on their<br>reconnection Journey coming back and<br>feel like we've been able to give back<br>in those Co Co-op environments but for<br>non- mildy coming in and learning in an<br>environment that they don't usually get<br>an opportunity too so um we know that<br>they go home and talk you know good news<br>about what they've seen with their farer<br>and friends and we start to do you know<br>something that's far bigger and greater<br>than the project I ever um aimed to<br>achieve for me personally um I was lucky<br>enough to receive a wake up to T who<br>scholarship through University and and<br>felt like an absolute fraud if I'm<br>honest um I knew my Papa growing<br>up in thappe but didn't know my<br>Papa here in W and so when I fill out an<br>application and have to say where my m<br>is and this is my MOA this is my a um<br>yeah absolute fraud but I guess now feel<br>like I have an opportunity to give back<br>in some small way so this yeah this has<br>been a extremely important uh project<br>for my own Journey um in terms of some<br>of the learnings we've had few<br>challenges with plant releasing<br>maintenance uh we had the cows get into<br>the first uh the first plants that we<br>put out in front of T's house which was<br>just devastating so the importance of<br>getting everyone on the copopa including<br>the sherker staff um hopefully that<br>won't happen again uh we thought we<br>needed a resource consent to do some of<br>the piss plant stuff early days which<br>caused a lot of delays but thankfully we<br>didn't um and I guess where to next uh<br>we've still got some big issues to to<br>tackle here um animals um yeah came to<br>learn a network from this group of of<br>experts over the next couple of days if<br>you have any ideas if you want to get<br>involved please sing out um no my<br>anyone's welcome to be to be part of<br>this<br>project<br>um<br>Sam and don't worry about you I wake up<br>to the tiny scholarship when I received<br>PlayStation J me rugby one too it's the<br>PlayStation one F straight to uh<br>straight to no Ling<br>C I clocked the game though finally yeah<br>there you<br>go all right up<br>next uh now Shannon leads the punu uh<br>punu River K uh which was established<br>back in 2015 to help local Mar hu learn<br>grow and use the knowledge in M Mali pun<br>River K has grown and planted more than<br>2.6 million trees and is currently<br>producing 700,000 native trees annually<br>while it has seen more than 110 km of<br>fencing completed and 120 hectares of<br>land retired and planted on farms along<br>pinu and we a and I was very lucky to go<br>and visit this site and see their<br>Shannon<br>spe<br>a success story of pun River I got to go<br>I got to take a back story cuz 10 years<br>ago they had the W River symposium W it<br>and I was sitting up there somewhere and<br>um we had Tamar's Dad speaking on behalf<br>of Nati HOA and he explained their<br>Journey um around education through<br>wintech um and then enabling a lot of<br>their Foo to get involved in Mahi<br>meaningful Mahi um to do with restoring<br>the the a or the waterways and um<br>straight away I spotted this dude from<br>wi his name was Klo and I just um got a<br>hold of him and I think about 3 months<br>later we had a level two wind wi Tech<br>satellite course operating at M marai we<br>had 15 students and thir graduated with<br>a level two H um qualification was crazy<br>um and from then um Don picked me up Don<br>scarlet and we rolled out to the river<br>uh rolled out to um Ragin and we met<br>Fred lar and then we um just went on<br>that whole journey and I think it was<br>real powerful that um I got access to<br>people like that at the start and but I<br>think it was equally as important um to<br>do something about it so yeah I just<br>thought um yeah it's interesting that 10<br>years later we're in the same spot on<br>strong yes our our vision is very clear<br>we know what we want<br>it's up there we want our people turning<br>returning back to<br>pun<br>um we want it to a state where we can<br>swiming it U at the moment we can't well<br>do but yeah it was interesting how you<br>you you type some prompts into Ai and it<br>images so it's pretty cool um so that's<br>a pretty Clear Vision it's better than<br>words<br>aric um yes so I'm just going to start<br>off with the um cultural significance of<br>punu and um you don't hold me to this<br>like I know a little bit but um you know<br>we've got theti we've got the um you<br>know the Gateway<br>into we've got um we've got we've got<br>the land walls um we've got um Mah Kai<br>there we've got inspiration that our<br>cars take from um punu um we've got the<br>um<br>M and so all of that kind of incompasses<br>you know a whole lot more than just<br>being a Waterway or a river um and<br>that's part of what we do at P River<br>cares um providing access for Al kahi<br>and everyone that wants to get amongst<br>it um to be involved in learning more so<br>we've got a few photos here of um Shane<br>turuki talking about<br>um what was he talking about<br>there might have<br>been um we've got one of the cousies Bob<br>tya talking about the carvings and some<br>of the um haker and stuff and explaining<br>you know when we do these Haka um a lot<br>of them is written on the carvings that<br>he's doing we've got Uncle H there with<br>um teaching some of our our K that have<br>never gone healing before teaching them<br>how to eal old school ways um<br>sacrificial um ceremonies of<br>PUK and um then we've got um we took the<br>team up to rang to get another cordor<br>around the um the ls and stuff which was<br>pretty powerful and then we've got Pon<br>glin um talking about K so every every<br>month we drop tools and we do T day and<br>we get in guest speakers or somebody and<br>we just throw down and learn um yeah so<br>that's probably something that makes us<br>a bit different um the current of punu<br>and its journey to wiper so pun and the<br>mang 2u they start up in p and then they<br>both weave down um they go through they<br>go through the the Hill Country see all<br>the sheep and beef stuff then they enter<br>Dairy conversion before they hit the<br>flats down to Dairy<br>country um they converge at White Kia um<br>where the where the volume starts<br>picking up down there and then they flow<br>into WIA just up p and then into um<br>W um pun River care so it's a copopa<br>first and foremost and then it's a<br>business and so that's kind of how<br>decisions are made um first and foremost<br>it's the copopa why we're doing it and<br>then um and then we have a lot of<br>business decisions and I think that's<br>kind of the um the big thing for us is<br>that constantly navigating that um from<br>operational and a governance perspective<br>can be challenging at times um but I<br>think if it was easy then everyone would<br>hard so our mission is to enhance the<br>waters and replenish the tong within the<br>catchment so that mission came about by<br>and<br>and this this Mission um until we<br>actually got the wording right and we've<br>still got it like it's it's still our<br>mission<br>today we focus on better water more T<br>species creating jobs for and<br>advocating um the significance of<br>funding we received from the wi is is is<br>pretty hard out like when we first<br>started um we wouldn't have been able to<br>stand up this Copa um without the<br>funding from the to support our projects<br>um very early on I think Ki helped us<br>with one of our first applications<br>beside the marai and then Eda um helped<br>us with a manaki tuna project um and<br>without those um those larger projects<br>we would have never developed the<br>capability or the capacity to take on<br>other Mahi um um and so I<br>think I think what occurred there we<br>weren't unsure for for us it was like<br>there was Mahi where to do the project<br>so on and so forth but looking back um<br>that steady stream of Mahi that we were<br>doing and then would get spikes um<br>another Mahi um was really was really<br>helpful um collaboration is key um with<br>M with e Regional Council um Grant you<br>know he helped us with a lot of um<br>writing a lot of writing a lot of<br>terminology I mean we knew what we<br>wanted but articulating that in some<br>pretty hefty funding applications to<br>Ministry um you know it's pretty hard<br>and they brought the experience in terms<br>of um measuring valuing quantifying<br>projects understanding scope um timeline<br>so on and so forth um it just made the<br>project delivery a lot easier when you<br>had that Insight at the start um yeah no<br>question about it if we didn't partner<br>with Regional Council we would not you<br>know have done as<br>well um and constant engagement with<br>midi I mean we employ a lot of midi F<br>anyway so they already know um e so yeah<br>that's been pretty influential so our<br>relationship with waku um<br>T jeez they they look the same one of<br>them anyway oh was so long ago he um he<br>rocks up in goes Shan what do you need<br>and we're like bro like we just want to<br>put our tools down and know when we come<br>back they're still going to be there so<br>he um he dropped off a couple of<br>shipping containers at the marai um and<br>a cover so that we could get our workers<br>out of the Sun and we had somewhere safe<br>to store our<br>tools and to this day like wak Toano has<br>just throw down every every chance they<br>get I think they recent they supported a<br>um a to come through our education<br>program um and then before that they<br>were supported our our open day um we<br>saw 600 people from om across New<br>Zealand come to moto to learn about the<br>coper and yeah like stakeholders just<br>constant we we grew up with most of the<br>farmers played rugby with them and<br>bar um challenges and pressures on punu<br>so um I was lucky to meet uh guy Lucen G<br>through um sheep and beef and BR took me<br>up and was helicopter and we went and<br>looked where the pun started and um as<br>soon as it comes out out of pyod it's<br>under pressure straight away um it's got<br>a real old school Farm up there that's<br>it's like a grid it's just grided and<br>like stock just go in and out um so as<br>soon as it comes out of the Bush um it's<br>under pressure<br>from uh sheep and beef and then it goes<br>down and there's some conversions that<br>have happened up in the top catchment I<br>think they've been fined a couple times<br>as well couple of farms up there um you<br>know it get it gets hammered and then it<br>comes down through um through the flat<br>country and then it's and still got to<br>compete with um Dairy down there um not<br>only that it passes um wiia which is<br>it's got a well it had you know for<br>years they only just changed it they had<br>a um Waste Water Treatment Plant out<br>there on a flood plane so that's no good<br>um and then goes past tooi where they<br>have the old tooi hospital and that has<br>a wastewater treatment plant there as<br>well that's on a flood plane so um and<br>then it goes into um into<br>W um but yeah you know like you've got<br>two huge a um discharges from um waste<br>that normally flood whenever it when<br>whenever it rains and then you've got um<br>very heavy Dairy um down on the<br>Flatlands every you know it's it's<br>pretty hard to give up that good land<br>down there but we are getting there but<br>these are the just the pressures you<br>know um the opportunities enabled by the<br>wa to address these pressures<br>um we get to determine where we're going<br>to do work which is good you know within<br>the constraints of the um restoration<br>strategy so we rather than just being a<br>contractor that delivers work for<br>another project that's been designed by<br>somebody else um we get<br>self-determination to say say this is<br>important to us and this is where we<br>should go so I think that's a real cool<br>framework um the importance of community<br>engagement in working together is key um<br>like the B said like there's no finger<br>pointing like you just got to get on<br>board there's we see more change from um<br>from Farmers wanting to do the right<br>thing as opposed to um what they have to<br>do and those are the farmers we like<br>working<br>with um so restoration and project<br>initiatives<br>um we operate under the the direction of<br>the Wu and W Power River restoration<br>strategy um you know still Guided by<br>that document although we are now<br>leaning towards some of the um areas at<br>fona identifying as critical Source<br>areas that outside that scope um that's<br>another project but um funds<br>specifically related to the river<br>Authority is is all is all done under<br>the strategy um um it's quite we we took<br>the regional council's lead on how we<br>Implement those projects so what we<br>found challenging was that um and we did<br>it for a 1bt project you land owners<br>would bug you about doing work or<br>wanting to do some good stuff on their<br>Farm um would go out would spend<br>considerable amount of time scoping um<br>doing the mapping quantifying putting<br>together the project and then you know<br>those time frames from when they get<br>that when they have that um first<br>engagement to when things start<br>happening is quite a long time and<br>things happen and then you go back and<br>then they kind of get a bit shy or then<br>you know and it can really throw the<br>whole project down so what we do is we<br>say We'll operate in this area here and<br>if um and as long as it satisfies the um<br>restoration strategy which we um get<br>approved um it enables us to move you<br>know if a farmers track the brakes down<br>and all of a sudden they're unable to<br>contribute then we can just move so we<br>have a range of um farmers who are<br>interested and who on the go um ready to<br>do this<br>Mah um our works Pro predominantly ran<br>planning fencing programs to reduce<br>settlement dirt like we're looking for<br>clarity so when we put our vision for it<br>it was from um what called it all about<br>the pun when when they fled from Moro<br>and it was that the pun was crystal<br>clear with the gravel bottom so that<br>gives us a bit of a context and set our<br>heads didn't he didn't say much about a<br>coli or any of those things but from<br>what I understand from there is that um<br>you know Clarity is a good pres is a<br>good indication that there's not a coli<br>so I think just Clarity for us good VI<br>good Vis is<br>good um we do wetland restoration<br>projects to enhance biodiversity and<br>provide habitat for Tong um we do<br>education and awareness campaigns to<br>promote<br>kak um and we're starting to delve into<br>some of this monitoring stuff right it's<br>been pretty pretty cool um we're with a<br>Dro so um Mercury and Dawn um and Waka<br>too partnership um gave us access to one<br>of these platforms called Adroid<br>monitoring check your phone know what's<br>going past technology which is pretty<br>cool um and so we put this PO up on the<br>top catchman his name is way order and<br>he talks to us through our phone and<br>tells us what's going past that's pretty<br>cool um and then Uncle Nik um from Nea<br>he linked us up with um some technology<br>that they're doing at Nea where they set<br>up cameras and then I've got this um M<br>um calculation that kind of gives us an<br>indication of if the woman if the River<br>safe to<br>swimming so um they're not like we<br>haven't set up a huge program for<br>monitoring but we we we're looking in<br>that space because we want to understand<br>um how do we make P new um summable<br>again and how do we kind of Target our<br>um restoration efforts towards that cuz<br>job um so we've got some achievements<br>here and outcomes and I'm just going to<br>go around the room and call you's out<br>so well I actually I won't because I'll<br>probably miss somebody but I think um at<br>very minimum um Dan hooko needs to stand<br>up because he's one of our um board<br>members um so I just want to give him a<br>bit of a round of applause for um<br>supporting<br>but you know there's just so many people<br>that I can see in the Stream that have<br>helped with this achievement even the<br>bro come up these planted a few of these<br>trees um so um yeah just give them a<br>round of applause<br>too um so we've established 142 hectares<br>of native um 203 rugby Fields um planted<br>1.3 million seedlings we've grown 3.6<br>million seedlings from seed we collected<br>ourselves from White<br>um we've enabled 90 jobs for Mii um<br>showcasing a significant impact not only<br>on economic growth but<br>empowerment um and we've advocated kak<br>at 23 events like I went to Wellington<br>one day and there was my face on this<br>huge building and it had Kaki and I was<br>like yo that's<br>cool so we're just advocating kak and<br>it's becoming more and more normal so<br>that's<br>cool<br>um lesson Lear Lessons Learned and best<br>practice so<br>um we just wanted to measure if you know<br>we talk about healthy people and people<br>coming through the cop up and we just<br>wanted to know you know surely there's<br>more than just providing a job and so we<br>wanted to start capturing a record of<br>learning that was occurring when they<br>were coming through the copopa and we<br>decided okay um we're going to put we're<br>going to put together a um like a<br>curriculum or whatever a course<br>so that um when we have kahi that start<br>they go through the whole thing and<br>we've called it a um certificate and<br>introductory River enhancement and we<br>got a um we got a course writer to write<br>it out as exactly as they would a a<br>proper curriculum for to all so um what<br>it does is it's made up of six cor um<br>and it takes you from seed collecting to<br>germinating seeds to um Growing Seeds in<br>the plants in the nursery to to<br>Preparing sites to planting sites and<br>then through maintaining sites um so it<br>has all of um that technical stuff but<br>it also has things like pako filtered<br>through it it also makes um Al kahi um<br>do some homework on their Pepa their<br>their faka papa and things like that um<br>what else does it have in it yeah it's<br>it's it's pretty cool um and then once<br>they've completed it<br>um you know they've really we can really<br>measure that and say actually you know<br>you know quite a bit when we first did<br>it we had guys work for that with Mahi<br>for like 5 years we had these students<br>come through and then they knew more<br>than people that have been with us for 5<br>years because when you go into somewhere<br>you might just go and do one piece of<br>that job like could just do planting or<br>just do Nursery but what we're finding<br>by doing this um program was they got<br>access to every single um piece and Y<br>they were doing everything so that was<br>pretty cool<br>um the importance of collaboration and<br>landowner engagement is key there's no<br>there's no um there's no if buts or<br>Mayes about it we have our project<br>manager is an ex Dairy manager dairy<br>farm manager race sper uh and I<br>purposely um pulled him out of the Hat<br>cuz he was a gym buddy but also I I knew<br>that we couldn't have those<br>conversations with land owners with<br>Farmers with d Farmers because we didn't<br>understand we couldn't see things from<br>their perspective and so Ray is very<br>good at understanding um the pressures<br>that farming has um and the times of<br>years times of year where you should be<br>approaching farmers and Times of years<br>where you need to just like you know<br>don't annoy them<br>um and that's being key like securing<br>land like what do we say 142 hectares we<br>didn't even need to go through a<br>settlement process to get that land back<br>for Papu and you know it's just been<br>through constant<br>uh collaboration and now we're working<br>with Matt hell who's writing the farm<br>plans for Daran Zed and so he's doing<br>that engagement now so you've got Ray<br>and Matt um really constantly talking<br>about them packs identifying these areas<br>and then linking them up with um with<br>with us to go and Implement these um<br>this<br>Mahi oh yeah so communication strategy<br>with engaging land owners is is pretty<br>hard out um<br>yep and so you really got to take a step<br>back and look at um look at the bigger<br>picture here cuz there may be things<br>that you don't like um but there's so<br>many Landers that are trying to do good<br>things<br>that you just got to<br>wait<br>yeah our future plans and sustainability<br>of the copopa<br>um just um not just but business as<br>usual ongoing restoration with a focus<br>on a forestation in Hill Country big<br>retirement of land up in the Hill<br>Country and critical Source areas in<br>Dairy um the WR is funding is critical<br>to support our people and our projects<br>um we're looking at Financial<br>sustainability it's been a big one for<br>the last year for me anyway is to<br>understand what that looks like how to<br>be less dependent on um on funding how<br>to create um you know different areas in<br>the business where we could probably<br>enter into um a commercial space to<br>support some of our some of our<br>charitable efforts or some of our<br>Cooper but those are decisions those are<br>conversations that were still right at<br>the board level um we're adopting<br>monitoring approaches so getting access<br>to these monitoring approaches is one<br>thing but actually adopting one or or<br>many is is another things so we're<br>looking at that and that'll help us<br>highlight areas um that are making punu<br>unum um minimizing waste generation so<br>not through a nursery there's there's a<br>really um there's a dirty side of<br>nurseries and there's a lot of plastic<br>waste um there's a lot of waste that's<br>been generated from growing trees and<br>sometimes you got to scratch your head<br>and wonder but there is technology out<br>there that can help us um actually<br>minimize waste um reduce use of plastics<br>but also the water that we are pulling<br>we're pulling 100 Cube um from the<br>stream every day but we're not<br>reticulating it reticulating it and<br>using again we're not Scavenging water<br>as best we could if we had a um facility<br>that was kind of designed to hold that<br>water um and so for us it's about okay<br>um let's not let let's start being less<br>time in conclusion um yeah achievements<br>in outcomes from funding from the W<br>River Authority all there um you know I<br>just I just can't speak uh highly of of<br>not only the people there today but the<br>people set it up with that Vision um<br>yeah because I think through the success<br>of P rare I think we' I hope we've<br>achieve some of that Vision that the<br>people at start you know put head um the<br>significance of the puny river is always<br>for<br>in continued collaboration and support<br>and restoring protecting our River um<br>yeah so we always you know doesn't<br>matter what our differences may be if<br>you're Keen to throw down for the hour<br>talk I'm here my brother aome Mah out<br>there at the P River K you know I've had<br>the the best wers at the pub with the<br>Faro some of the best ideas some of the<br>most transformative ideas future<br>planning you know all of that stuff if<br>only I could remember it the next day<br>we'd be in a much better place right now<br>so we've organized another one sometime<br>this<br>weekend all right our next speaker<br>coming up our speakers should I say uh<br>the an trust has been instrumental uh in<br>the M Gali restoration project a bold<br>30-year plan to create the first green<br>corridor from Sanctuary Mountain to the<br>wo River uh phase one of the project<br>will ultimately see 8.4 hectares of land<br>retired and replanted and protecting and<br>enhancing 1.1 kilomet of stream reparan<br>environment surrounding M<br>TOA Shannon clar<br>and<br>and I'm here today with my awesome<br>cousin Shannon GL who whoever whoever<br>put us up after the pun River care has<br>up all right that that's the gold<br>standard get ready for the gum boo all<br>right kaai so I'm just going to start<br>off first of all by just uh playing a<br>videos I think there's been some visions<br>of reconnecting fno back to the fin for<br>a really long time but this particular<br>project really started going in 2018<br>we're really looking at a longterm plan<br>and creating an ecological corridor from<br>the mountain of the hour that increases<br>the biodiversity of the birds in both<br>areas the sense of connection for them<br>has been absolutely amazing absolutely<br>amazing it's now become a project of<br>TI our project has extended further to<br>be on just a tile just some little dinky<br>TI project having my daughter tell me<br>Mama I want to go to my manga and I take<br>her back and she's running around the<br>fina planting trees and she's like 5<br>years old it's really given her a strong<br>connection oh honestly it's 100e plan<br>our co- to have our fin reconnect to the<br>fena wherever they are every one that<br>we've come to they've met new cousins<br>new aunties new nannies they've learned<br>new M that we never knew about old<br>people talk about how they interacted<br>with the why how how their Puna was over<br>here and what they used to do they used<br>to toe FY um in the water when somebody<br>was sick but we we don't have that same<br>relationship with our um with our a<br>anymore we're sharing new experiences<br>with new family members that we can<br>cherish and I guess pass down to the<br>Next Generation we're now fin as well<br>Alo<br>well<br>K so so here's here's where our project<br>is it's at the uh at the base of our tup<br>moar uh and and here's the uh the street<br>of uh Gully that we are currently<br>restoring right now so I'm just going to<br>move<br>this Cai it it covers uh six uh Mary<br>land<br>blocks sorry five Marty land blocks one<br>road Reserve uh so we have five uh five<br>laughing uh and uh and over uh 1,500<br>land owners<br>so uh it spans across 11 uh 11 hectares<br>and I just referred to it as a dinky<br>little project actually a restoration<br>project and we took we took Sue K Sue<br>and uh and Michelle out the other week<br>and they said there's nothing dinky<br>about<br>this kaai uh 70,000 uh 70,000 plants<br>we've planted so<br>far uh we uh covered two uh quite<br>significant uh sites of signific an uh<br>in our<br>um yeah<br>C that's that's uh essentially an<br>overview of our uh our<br>area uh we we were I I don't know what<br>we were crazy actually uh we we had a<br>you know it it almost seems like we got<br>off the kitschen table and then we went<br>out and said should should we do a pro<br>TI bro and and she said yeah yeah why<br>not so so we started it we started it in<br>2018 and there's some shots of the galy<br>or what the galy looked like at that<br>time and then we went into 2019 and at<br>the 2019 at the end of 2019 we really<br>started to gather momentum our funders<br>were interested we were presenting our<br>copopa all over the ways and uh and then<br>Co<br>hit so that's why there's not a picture<br>there from 2020 cuz we were all in<br>lockdown<br>right kaai so you can see there that our<br>the progression of the galy in<br>2022 we we uh we we said that's it we<br>we've had enough of this GS and uh and<br>we decided to get a a a basically an<br>industrialized lawn mower in there to<br>take care of<br>why when we started this<br>we we've had to Pivot a couple of times<br>and when we started this this was preco<br>and we had all the Big Ideas right we we<br>had this idea of grander we were going<br>to create this amazing tourist<br>attraction it was going to be awesome it<br>was going to you know it was going to be<br>an extension of our of our manga uh it<br>was going to be<br>fantastic we we went away we got<br>KPMG uh to pull us together a strategy<br>we were like yeah we were going to we're<br>going to put our sight of significance<br>and some Po and some signs we were going<br>to be<br>Gangsta hey we put it all together we<br>did our homework we said Al f are going<br>to love this<br>absolutely and<br>then and then not only did Co hit and<br>and with it went the pgf funding that<br>Shane Shane Jones and um<br>and uh Winston uh uh championed for Mai<br>but so did the uh the the tourism<br>industry in New<br>dreams go away those things are out of<br>our control when we could absolutely<br>sort of deal with those right okay kaai<br>the the tourism industry will boom back<br>again one day what wasn't so what wasn't<br>so easy to get over was<br>Alano<br>a right what wasn't so easy to get over<br>was Alano and I'm just going to hand it<br>over to<br>Shannon when when in the video there I<br>said that we we don't have the same<br>connection to our to our a<br>anymore and that's that's a result of a<br>couple of things urbanization people<br>have moved into town um and we don't<br>have a lot of Alano still living out out<br>at oura but a lot of Alano are<br>disconnected from the fena they leas it<br>out um to to Farmers who make a ton of<br>money<br>um<br>and and and so and so there is this uh<br>there is this disconnection and actually<br>um I'm reminded by um by something David<br>Asen said uh he said no one will protect<br>what they don't care about and no one<br>will care about it until they experience<br>it and this is why one of the one of the<br>key steps for us in the success of our<br>project was to get Alo<br>involved for that and so I just want to<br>go through some of our photos the top uh<br>the the the top leftand photo is a photo<br>of all of our trustees at our very first<br>um truste consultation H we had this<br>really a we had mean bright ideas about<br>it and getting five trusts together to<br>agree on a common goal is a Mastery in<br>communication and I was down for that<br>challenge cuz if I can't talk to my own<br>family members how am I going to go out<br>into the real world and get a job um so<br>lucky for me um we are we are we are<br>resilient people and Alo could see some<br>movement but they I'm not going to joke<br>they um were deeply reluctant until this<br>year until all the planting was done and<br>then went oh yeah all right then okay I<br>suppose you know and you just get some<br>foo like that so one of the difficulties<br>for us straight up was navigating that<br>communication with our own Foo our own<br>aunties um and our biggest learnings was<br>keep pursuing keep going don't give up<br>just because someone says no means no<br>for<br>now for today it just means no for today<br>but hey we're from the fer we're not<br>going anywhere if you don't say yes to<br>me today you're going to say yes to my<br>son or my M or my great grandson you<br>know<br>so good luck with<br>that cool I need to keep moving um this<br>was I just want to Mi to cousin kho Mahi<br>trust they really helped us uh in our<br>very first our first war are really<br>getting our plants onto the Monga<br>getting Alo involved um really<br>instrumental and teaching us and<br>incorporating the<br>that we already held from our from our<br>Faro um that's me pretending to tell<br>someone how to plant a<br>tree uh that's all my brothers all ouro<br>there with um our planting team from May<br>trust Uncle T yeah I'm mindful of our<br>time I'll let you keep<br>same one of the pivots for us one of the<br>pivots for us and and and there's been a<br>few uh and and uh a few talent and<br>things for us to work through but one of<br>the things that was almost like a<br>byproduct of um of our uh of our<br>restoration project was actually the<br>work that we that needed to be done in<br>order for us to reconnect with ourselves<br>and to ReDiscover and reclaim our own<br>stories and that's been one of this this<br>for me um yep it's great we restoring<br>our our um our hour and we're restoring<br>our fua and we''re being good Kaki<br>excellent Tech but actually for me this<br>is where the real gold and the real Dem<br>GMS have come from is uh we've had the<br>ability through this project to um to uh<br>interview some of our fun some of our<br>nannies and um the the stories have been<br>absolutely amazing um we you know we we<br>had one one fun over there uh recount<br>the time that uh you know when<br>electricity first came to M to and um<br>some of the questionable games they used<br>to play with real guns<br>um to right right through to the<br>disturbing Kai they used to eat so a lot<br>of this a lot of this has been great yes<br>restoring our uh restoring our a and<br>restoring a piece uh of the of our you<br>know I guess a tributary of our T has<br>been significant but actually also as<br>well along with that reclaiming<br>ourselves and restoring ourselves as a<br>people has been fabulous and I'm<br>reminded by my auntie who's sitting up<br>there she always reminds us we are the<br>tial not just not not just what grows<br>and in the ground and What flows to the<br>so very quickly um what's next for us we<br>we are holding space for the first green<br>corridor from M TOA to<br>WWA we have no idea how to do that in<br>actuality we are mindful that may take a<br>long time but we know if we hold the<br>space for that then the experts will<br>come to us um so what's next for us is<br>is really doing these six blocks very<br>well we I I feel like I've got<br>undiagnosed ADHD so I was like yes cuz<br>let's go to the next six blocks and she<br>was like hang on a minute let's go ask<br>the foo hey let's go home and go and see<br>what Foo want and they were really clear<br>water restoration wire restoration and<br>access to our galy is a must yeah aome<br>you planted 70,000 trees but we can't<br>get over the fence you know cuz Nan's<br>got a bung leg and she's<br>85 so you know just really simple things<br>are really important to our Faro in<br>order to get access back to M at those<br>first six blocks of the galy so they can<br>get back to the Y so we can start doing<br>those really little things so we are<br>really conscious small things in our own<br>backyard making a really big impact and<br>when we do that well then maybe that<br>will inspire the next six blocks and the<br>next six blocks and the next farmlands<br>and I guess oh sorry I just want to go<br>back to Cambridge East Primary School<br>Auntie put um you know when you do like<br>a project you're like oh yeah all about<br>the coopa All About the coopa and then<br>someone goes oh what about the next<br>coopa you know which actually is the<br>next uh I'm inspired by the fact that we<br>start this little thing we do things in<br>our own backyard and then our aunties<br>and our neighbors go oh B this could<br>have want to get involved hey they want<br>to plant the next six blocks you know<br>and so when you stand and you hold space<br>for something your funo will jump on the<br>people that care about this will get on<br>and and and help you along the way so<br>just m to all of those who is that<br>person that goes oh hey we can help do<br>the next bit or you might not have you<br>know the bread but you bring the butter<br>to The Coop Papa or you know all of that<br>all that makes a<br>difference oh okay well and just can I<br>have a full disclaimer um I'm not an<br>expert in this I'm a youth worker I have<br>a real<br>job a kid I joke but I'm not an expert I<br>start we started this because I I'm a<br>urban girl brought up in you know why<br>cut all the places in the urban city and<br>we only went home for tongy<br>hunger and then I get old and go oh who<br>am I where are my<br>people what you know and so these given<br>me an opportunity to come home when when<br>cousin and I were talking about various<br>Copa we were like who do who are we<br>going to be about this what could be<br>possible if we were the best versions of<br>ourself what type of Marty do I want to<br>be I want want to be the tree climbing<br>go up the Monga type of moldi I want to<br>be the You Know M all the way Maly I<br>want to be the sit down with my mockos<br>and tell them we planted this tree moldy<br>so it was really moving for me to um for<br>my cousin to give me some Mah and<br>project management and can I just say I<br>know we're over time but I was never a<br>project manager before she hired me as a<br>project<br>manager you know and so I like am so<br>overwhelmed and honored to be here today<br>but you do not have to be an expert to<br>just go and get<br>done<br>hey and we're all amazing here for that<br>and I'm me to you all cuz I think we all<br>got the same you<br>that yeah I think that's the point of<br>this slide so we've gone through we've<br>told you about how awesome we are um and<br>and and now I'm giving you our<br>background she's she's uh she's got a<br>background and comes uh she's a mama and<br>and um yeah she said yeah yeah see she<br>said to me oh I don't know how to how to<br>manage a project I said neither do I<br>let's discover this together so off off<br>we went um I I'm a I'm a library I have<br>a background in librarianship I was at<br>the University of white CLE library for<br>allness and and I've got all the<br>gumption in the world so so so that's<br>our background we're we're we're<br>both bought up in town right we're both<br>townies and um you know<br>the I Pro I guess what I guess the point<br>here is if we can do this um anyone can<br>it does it it takes it doesn't take uh<br>an expert so sorry to the experts but<br>but it doesn't take an expert to get uh<br>a a project uh a restorative project off<br>the ground we are all kayaki we all have<br>Kaki um just just lastly I just wanted<br>to uh toku uh to our uh to all of our<br>funders uh to all of our um our subbies<br>um<br>yep<br>awesome to of cordor and just goes to<br>show what passion can do and when you<br>got a heaps of passion you can achieve<br>stuff uh there's no photos of me during<br>2020 during lockdown as well uh had the<br>whole fun I've got seven daughters and<br>we got my two sisters and my mother to<br>come and stay with me I was the only<br>male in the house as my brother refused<br>to come with all with all of those so uh<br>luckily for my mom's um Gil Mall's car<br>uh I came out of lockdown I bought a<br>borderline alcoholic after all of that<br>and put on about 20 kgs so there's<br>definitely no photos of me during uh<br>during lockdown either but a fantastic<br>qu from all of our panel and uh from all<br>the projects that I've listened to today<br>job without vision and without passion<br>our EVN will be lost so your passion and<br>your vision and watching it come to<br>fruition uh definitely inspires me to go<br>home and tell somebody else to get it<br>off the ground so we're into it uh you<br>uh we're going to have a panel<br>discussion and we're going to take a few<br>party and I'm not here to do this job<br>all by myself I've got one of uh my<br>brothers over here one of the to come up<br>and take this part of<br>I<br>I'm Julian Williams I work for the<br>workout of river Authority the range of<br>other hats like many of our Maro here<br>today um so you know they they they<br>reckon part should never meet your um<br>hero in Real Life part meet me around<br>about um<br>1994 and uh we will be um uh running the<br>show over the next few days B will look<br>after the whole scheme of things and<br>I'll be helping out with the panel<br>discussion um quickly a little bit about<br>myself so I'm way here boy I actually<br>think we have the best bombers uh around<br>the country and our kids are still<br>jumping off the bridge doesn't matter<br>how many defense mechanisms you put<br>around their Bridge they they're going<br>to find the way and and I think that's<br>important because they the litmus test<br>on all the Mah we're doing hey if were<br>they still going there if they're not<br>then something's not working and so um<br>yeah grew up in here uh here boy never<br>moved far moved to Huntley played some<br>games with part at tono and then up to<br>Hamilton so that's me I've been in<br>environmental space for quite a while my<br>mom was my I suppose uh instigator into<br>the um into the environmental space and<br>acknowledge my cousin lilan here so she<br>would take me up to the hak mat and we<br>look at Co<br>and then she'll make me have a look<br>underneath and if there were eggs we put<br>them back she would use her hands I'd<br>use my hat don't like getting pricked by<br>things would go earing down at at the<br>AWA uh with all of our cousins and you<br>know we'd put the depending on how they<br>looked we'd put them back and let them<br>go um so yeah she was the instigator uh<br>for my Mahi and me moving into the space<br>but uh just um everyone sitting here uh<br>I just uh do want to acknowledge um the<br>cordor you've shared that energy man<br>you've set the bar you know the next two<br>sessions today<br>k um but I need to do one bit of uh<br>housework uh at this time if you can um<br>we we'll be taking questions over the<br>next two days uh we have an app called<br>the slido app on the inside cover of<br>your program uh there is a uh QR code um<br>could you please scan that the reason<br>why you know usually I'd say put your<br>hand up ask us a part you know parttime<br>way um but what we'd like to do is<br>actually capture a lot of your questions<br>because these are things that we can use<br>to think about for future conferences uh<br>we may not and we will not be able to<br>answer them all and we have some f<br>online as well so um you've been sit if<br>you can do that while I continue to talk<br>that would be great we're only going to<br>have probably two questions you've been<br>sitting in here for at least 2 hours and<br>15 minutes cuz you all got here early<br>thank you um it was us the organizers<br>that were running a bit late but um I<br>just want to reflect on on a couple<br>couple of things here um H Shen Shen is<br>um was exactly where you are today he<br>did sit up here we didn't know he didn't<br>like public speaking they said can you<br>come and have a cord about 10 years ago<br>like he said so you know it's uh it's um<br>he was in the same shoes as you and so<br>um yeah keep going what all of this<br>needs is collaboration but also needs<br>leadership doesn't matter where you're<br>from or what you're up to um I do want<br>to reflect on what um uh Dr Mike<br>mentioned so he he spoke about Winston<br>Churchill's quote um and and um I<br>reflect on something Shane Solomon said<br>to us once with the river settlement<br>everyone expected water quality to be<br>healed overnight um this is a long-term<br>gain hence why we have people like Mike<br>and all of our news and all of our Crown<br>research institutes and councils trying<br>to help us figure out and collaborate<br>all the things we're doing how do we<br>know we're going in the right direction<br>and Shane reminded us that our<br>settlement like all m<br>like all of our settlements who have got<br>our Tong at the Forefront of those<br>negotiations Shane said we've only just<br>pulled the handbrake on the train we<br>haven't even turned the train yet and so<br>we've got a long way to go and so with<br>all of your M and all this collaboration<br>hopefully we can turn that train around<br>and head into the right direction um you<br>might not recognize Sam because in the<br>in the in the schedule that you've got<br>there that was about when he was<br>12 but but Sam was one of those one's<br>quite courageous uh you know he didn't<br>know many people here but he came and he<br>knew something had to be done he knew<br>something wasn't working well with<br>fontier and he reached out and he found<br>the right people I suppose to talk to so<br>um I'm not going to talk too much more<br>really just to say that um we've got<br>Michelle over here and we're going to<br>have a couple of questions from Michelle<br>like I said you've been in here for<br>about 2 hours and 15 minutes I don't<br>want to be the barrier between the kai<br>Michelle hoders took I'm monitoring the<br>slid today so I'm just looking we've got<br>a few questions um with a few thumbs up<br>next to them so the first question uh<br>for punu are the training opportunities<br>restoration yep that's why we made them<br>um want to share<br>them um there's a couple of ways to<br>deliver it that we can um have some kahi<br>come out and share them wherever you are<br>or um you can come through our training<br>program via if there's F out there that<br>um registered with MSD um they can come<br>through um that way or um w we sponsored<br>one of the trainers this year so um yeah<br>resources I think we've got another<br>question directed at you Shannon um how<br>are farmers receptive to change now<br>ago yeah that's a good question<br>um very<br>receptive um but I think in part because<br>of the um the co-funding<br>element um I think it'll be another<br>story cuz 10 years ago like they had to<br>cost uh kind of a related question here<br>um for Sam did fona match the funding or<br>funding um we just we put in a a<br>percentage of the project um based on on<br>our memorandum of understanding with<br>Tong trust board um but part of that<br>funding as I showed through some of the<br>other projects has been put into um<br>planting other parts of the farm but we<br>have a bucket set aside every year for<br>away okay question for I think any of<br>you could probably answer this one uh<br>how are you protecting the new plantings<br>from grazing and P species deer Wes<br>rabbits<br>Etc start with<br>the<br>experts thank you thank you so much for<br>that um well we have a fence keep in<br>mind this is like phase 1.1 of a<br>100-year plan and right now I got Kathy<br>from Bush to BS going hey I haven't<br>caught up with you yet so pests is<br>definitely in the and we're probably not<br>the experts to be um giving you some<br>flash details about about that one but<br>we don't have wab bees um<br>thankfully or deer cuz we would have<br>now sorry I thought it was<br>Smo so we had the fence but we didn't<br>have the power going and that was a key<br>learning um in terms of the shoker staff<br>make sure that buddy power's on because<br>so yeah um for us it's been good<br>fences um and making sure that Landon<br>has skin in the game<br>um next one um we've struggled with PUK<br>kle so we've just gone to a bigger grade<br>so they can't pull um pull the trees out<br>they normally Hammer the um<br>fak um and um any other P species I<br>think there's the here but um yeah you<br>kind of need to be on site to Bow them<br>um but what we've done at PRC is we grow<br>way more plants than kind of we need and<br>then what we do is we'll go through all<br>of our plantings and then just replace<br>them um and but just note what species<br>that they're hammering and replace it<br>with a different<br>one well I'll just um jump in a little<br>bit here so I've been asked to go for<br>another five minutes um so I think this<br>is where collaboration is important<br>because the treaty settleman you heard<br>um Mike speak about uh the independent<br>scoping study said um said basically for<br>the next 30 Years you need 4 billion the<br>treaty settlement was $210 million so<br>it's 5% of exactly what yeah of what was<br>needed uh then that was just to turn the<br>curve and so the<br>ewe in upper and he said we we got to<br>put this funding into places that are<br>not the responsibilities of others so<br>pests is one of those we don't fund<br>quiot removal we might help with a few<br>of the events but it's not our<br>responsibility it's it's for other<br>agencies to look after those things like<br>pests we'll do do as much as we can to<br>make sure that the plants are being<br>protected that they continue to get to a<br>place where they can look after<br>themselves but general pest eradication<br>is a responsibility of others and that's<br>the same with other things uh that that<br>we're working<br>on any more part um we've got one a<br>little bit different uh about monitoring<br>approaches so Shannon what monitoring<br>approaches are you using or<br>investigating for use for pun<br>River<br>um Edna use that one um we got some<br>smack kits donated from R which has been<br>good learning how to use those very<br>practical way on how to um get people<br>involved and more educational but um in<br>terms of longer term monitoring they're<br>too um that you can't do them enough um<br>remote um monitoring so the Droid<br>systems where they've got sensors in the<br>water measuring um stuff and um we've<br>got got um there's some photo Point<br>monitoring from<br>Nea um but yeah what I would suggest is<br>if you're interested in the Droid stuff<br>come and talk to me email me um if<br>you're interested in the um the Nea um<br>Monitoring Solutions talk to Uncle niky<br>over here from newa and then um yeah I<br>think um Edna Edna um a lot of the fin<br>should be aware of that through the<br>testing of the KO of the of the clams at<br>the moment so I think that's pretty cool<br>because it tells you you know what's in<br>the water Upstream you not only can get<br>an indication of some of the bad things<br>but also some of the good things and<br>trying to increase the presence of those<br>good things so yeah highly recommend the<br>Edna um monitoring stuff do any of our<br>other f up here on mention anything<br>cultural health indicators or you know<br>some of the indicators they far are<br>looking at for monitoring the<br>Improvement of Health<br>I just say Julia I mean the great work<br>and there's so many different catchment<br>groups out there that are getting<br>engaged in that that um that monitoring<br>work it's amazing<br>how just you know like that you<br>mentioned the schmack kit Shannon so the<br>stream Health monitoring assessment kit<br>very simple kit that was developed by<br>Nea quite a few years ago it's amazing<br>how that can really help with engagement<br>and getting people a little B but um you<br>know that understanding of what's living<br>in their Waterway and when people start<br>to understand what what's living there<br>they are much more likely to want to<br>protect and and restore it often people<br>will think of the Waterway as just well<br>that's a drain or that's you know<br>there's nothing living there but<br>actually when when you actually go in<br>there and look at things um every<br>Waterway has life got a got a mik um<br>just got the text morning te ready um<br>before we we send you out to to have a<br>Kai the today is all about um you'll see<br>you'll see in in the schedule there is<br>about River restoration practitioners<br>and so when we think about back about<br>when we first started working for the<br>tribe and and working on the settlement<br>negotiations um when we went out to uh<br>poar actually we were talking rahu Papa<br>about<br>and what he meant was in 1975 that all<br>of those things that make me up as a w<br>boy boy is reflected in that pip during<br>confiscation The Invasion these things<br>were taken away and those<br>responsibilities were taken from us to<br>look after our a to to to uphold the man<br>of our King and um to protect our most<br>sacred MOA well 1975 we had the the Moa<br>returned in 20 1995 we had the ratu<br>settlement resolved and 3% of the lands<br>that were returned back to our tribe of<br>the 1.2 million confiscated was put in<br>the name of P to so that that that kind<br>of Jigsaw that creates me uh as a w<br>little boy was starting to be fulfilled<br>and in 2010 we had the river settlement<br>so what's the next challenge it's<br>exactly everything they're doing<br>hereif at every Bend we do have<br>communities and we need to lift up those<br>communities to create what they want so<br>yeah we have Chiefs probably have too<br>many<br>chiefs uh but at every Bend we have a<br>community and what I ask you to think<br>about is what the river has created more<br>so than what's going into her you know<br>sit in her and see what she's created<br>cuz she's the only reason we have the<br>region and the catchment we do today so<br>what we're seeing here and what you'll<br>see today is a creation of those tny<br>fire at every at every community and at<br>every bent and then<br>um the devourers of challenges so we<br>have challenges coming towards us and<br>they generally come out of Wellington<br>thankfully oh I better not say too much<br>contract um and and and what we the<br>beauty we have here and we're very<br>fortunate in the W especially for our a<br>is we have one of the strongest policy<br>instruments in the country that can<br>deter some of those flip-flop policy<br>changes that happen every 3 years and<br>you'll hear more about that tomorrow but<br>today is all about creating those uh T<br>far at every B so it's time for our kite<br>first one out there if you can bless our<br>great we just have um some t for<br>our<br>count I didn't have my 5-year-old son<br>here to<br>help yeah so um yeah just a small t uh<br>and and Stu just um like to yeah we got<br>two more coming yeah two more coming so<br>thank<br>you make our way<br>they<br>y all right fin let's go and have some<br>keep<br>and my first year in here we didn't get<br>past the agenda that's how that's our<br>robust the conversations can be from<br>time to time here y so those are the mar<br>everybody I Look to left we did this<br>exercise earli just make sure the same<br>person is next to you and to your right<br>and if they are uh then we know that<br>everybody is here uh if they haven't<br>then just put your hand up and let me<br>know that that person hasn't arrived<br>back yet I know we got a few coming in<br>go<br>bye<br>now I just picked up a little bit of a<br>cord uh that happened just before uh we<br>broke for morning tea around Wes here in<br>Al and that's a bit of a problem if you<br>have a problem with wab bees in your<br>area it's all right just give Eddie<br>Jones a call okay he'll take care of the<br>problem completely eradicate them from<br>your area all right it's currently in<br>Japan so good luck to our Japanese uh<br>for KN over there<br>all<br>right and we'll move straight into our<br>next speaker uh for this uh this morning<br>afternoon is the W and West Coast Zone<br>Manager for w Regional Council where she<br>oversees the delivery of council's<br>catchment management program for these<br>areas uh prior to this she worked for<br>more than 25 years in the catchment and<br>cons conservation management uh with<br>roles in local and central government<br>and with the wao river Authority she was<br>lead author on the wa and waa River<br>restoration strategy catchment<br>scale erosion control Kiri neelson I'm<br>me uh kot Koto um car Nelson TOA um as<br>um as introduced I'm for the last three<br>years I've been the Zone Manager for<br>Regional Council in the W power and West<br>Coast zones but I've also lived for most<br>of my 50 plus years in the WIA zone so<br>it's a place that's also very dear to my<br>heart so just a quick overview of the<br>WIA Zone most of you um are probably<br>reasonably familiar with it it's just<br>over 300,000 hectares in size so it's a<br>large water shed with almost 5,000 km of<br>waterways um it's characterized by<br>erosion prone soils and um High sediment<br>loads to waterways and this um is is<br>predominantly caused by Meth mass<br>movement of um Hill slopes and stream<br>bank erosion so the Zone goes from um<br>the headwaters at pikipiki Springs down<br>to the Confluence of the wiar main stem<br>with the wut river<br>atua just want to talk about this as a<br>precursor to um the whitea hatchment<br>plan project the history of land<br>clearance and the catchment like most of<br>the country um the wiper has a long<br>history of vegetation clearance<br>beginning right back in the in the early<br>1800s but particularly in the 1960s to<br>1980s um the government provided major<br>incentives to clear marginal land<br>through um incentive um programs where<br>land owners got up to 100% of the cost<br>of clearing land in a in a bid to<br>increase um sheep and beef uh production<br>and so land that wasn't really well<br>suited for pastural use was was cleared<br>and there was a big push for it in the W<br>CLE and approval for clearance was<br>widespread and now the land owners um<br>who have those properties and the<br>communities within the catchment um are<br>decisions so that's that's left us with<br>a catchment um with lots of um issues<br>and these certainly aren't all of them<br>but particularly relevant to this talk<br>is the vulnerability of the catchment um<br>and it soils to erosion the river water<br>quality so the middle photo there is<br>where the AWA meets the Wako River um<br>and the Wier river is the largest<br>contributor as a tributary of sediment<br>to the low W cutle River so this isn't<br>just about improving the wiper hour it's<br>about the low W cutle Health as well and<br>then also as we've heard from um the<br>amazing speakers we've already had the<br>loss of Modi of the river and the<br>connection um and access for e to the to<br>the hour has been impacted by all of<br>these historic<br>activities just want to briefly talk<br>about this scheme because for the W par<br>hatchment plan project it was a it was a<br>bit of an inspiration um the wtoo whiteo<br>catchment uh scheme that really was<br>kicked off in the 80s and 90s because<br>the caves were at threat from<br>sedimentation from the upper catchment<br>major tourism um asset for the area but<br>also hugely significant um for many<br>other reasons and the white more landare<br>group initiated this project uh along<br>with ewi to try and save the caves um<br>and incentives were offered at 75 to<br>100% of the capital costs of Hill<br>Country erosion Works um to land owners<br>and by<br>2014 110 km of fencing had been done and<br>nearly 12 more than 1200 hectares of<br>land retired and importantly the<br>monitoring showed that there was a 40%<br>reduction in suspended sediment in the<br>white Tomo stream over this time so this<br>showed us it could actually be done it<br>was on a smaller scale but it provided<br>us with inspiration that something<br>measurable was<br>possible at the time that we initiated<br>the White Park hatchment plan project<br>Council had a couple of incentivized<br>programs um clean streams which you may<br>have had some experience with which was<br>really around Behavior change regarding<br>stock access to waterways there was a<br>35% Grant to land owners um who would<br>exclude stock from waterways um for<br>Native planting and also for water<br>articulation um the fences were often<br>quite minimal and quite close to the<br>waterways but it it did its job and its<br>time we also had project Watershed which<br>is still ongoing which has um it's a<br>catchment based approach to flight<br>control soil conservation and River<br>Management that also has a 35% grant for<br>Land Management activities and a 50%<br>grant for River Management activities<br>but what we knew at the time is that 35%<br>wasn't enough to get the kind of change<br>that we wanted um to facilitate progress<br>against uh towards the vision and<br>strategy<br>we were still left with major problems<br>like this Mass erosion huge amounts of<br>sediment entering the<br>rivers so the wiper catchment plan<br>Inception came about around 2012 2013<br>with a really strong drive from wiper<br>ewe and the catchman advisory committee<br>which cont had those e representatives<br>and landowner Representatives as part of<br>it for Council to have greater<br>investment in the catchment and there<br>was a real desire for to see us base our<br>management decisions on cost benefit<br>analysis um we at the similar time we'd<br>had an independent review of our<br>sustainable Land Management Programs<br>which highlighted that there was a lack<br>of demonstrable benefits from our<br>existing program um recently um at that<br>time um wers Regional Council had a soul<br>scientist and a spatial analyst Reese<br>hel and Dan Borman who completed a wiper<br>prioritization prioritization spatial<br>modeling um program which I'll talk<br>about briefly um which would could<br>inform this cost ba benefit based<br>approach and also the the catchman<br>advisory committee saw a real potential<br>to leverage co-funding um from W CLE<br>River Authority and central government<br>if Council was prepared to put more<br>investment into this program at the time<br>of the wiper catchment plan Inception<br>the council's investment was around<br>about $300,000 a year for the whole<br>zone so I won't go into detail about<br>about this it could be a present of its<br>own but essentially the spatial modeling<br>exercise looked at areas of risk and<br>opportunity within the catchment looking<br>at all of the spatial layers that we<br>could draw together um to identify areas<br>where if we did management um gold<br>standard management mitigations we could<br>see change so things like um the type<br>and location of erosion the modeled<br>settlement yield from subcatchments um<br>where there was High um high class Lu um<br>land and areas of pasture that that<br>wasn't really suitable for that<br>use and so this was all brought together<br>to create an estimate of sediment yield<br>by all of the little subcatchments the<br>watersheds within the catchment and then<br>we identified best practice mitigations<br>that you would incentivize so this<br>wasn't about regulatory actions this was<br>about incentivized actions these were<br>costed and then applied to the model and<br>priority catchments were selected with<br>the greatest reductions and sediment<br>toward waterways were predicted to be<br>from applying those<br>mitigations and so that helped to feed<br>the goals of the white par hatchment<br>plan there are several um more than what<br>are here but three that have really<br>driven this program were around land use<br>matching capability and erosion and<br>sedimentation being reduced to give<br>effect to T25<br>Mano that water would be of a swimmable<br>quality and visibly clearer at the<br>Confluence with uh the W River and that<br>co- management partners and stakeholders<br>are working together<br>collaboratively uh can't not mention<br>that um partway through implementation<br>of the of the plan the won wi River<br>restoration strategy was produced the<br>same models were updated and priorities<br>refined through that process in 2018 and<br>then council's wiar catchment plan<br>implementation project has been aligned<br>to those revised priorities we' focused<br>a lot on soil conservation and River<br>Management um and incorporating fish<br>habitat and ew priorities and capacity<br>building into that there are a lot of<br>other um entities doing really great<br>riparian management and we've heard from<br>some of them already so we haven't so<br>much focused on riparian and Wetland<br>restoration and our<br>delivery so we first applied for funding<br>for wack hatchment plan implementation<br>in 2014 and the intended funding share<br>would was a 35% uh contribution from<br>Council our standard contribution 35%<br>from the river Authority and then % from<br>land owners and other funders um of<br>which NPI has been a major part of we<br>identified two Priority One catchments<br>for Focus that was the kifa and the Moa<br>Kura and since this time oh important to<br>note there's several other priority two<br>catchments and rivers as well but our<br>our priority is on the K fan and and the<br>mo since 2014 a to total of 12.5 million<br>has been invested into the program and<br>the wot riveral Authority has invested<br>4.6 million of<br>this so just going to flick through a<br>few before and afters because I know<br>everyone likes them but essentially so<br>this is one of the gullies and the KY<br>funif far um five years into its um<br>program but just sort of demonstrating<br>we utilized the model from the<br>restoration strategy around planting and<br>it's been very successful in<br>establishing native plants at that<br>site um one of the um places we've<br>worked along the kif FIFA stream um to<br>enhance or stabilize Banks through<br>through retirement but also enhanced<br>shading and potential um fish habitat<br>through um Woody matter and debris um<br>into the into the<br>river this is a Hill Country Retirement<br>in the Moa Kura this was 36 hectares<br>retired from pastal farming into Manuka<br>aforestation it's now looking even more<br>fantastic and also in the mo Kura just<br>another example of a critical Source<br>area where there was previously lots of<br>pugging um stock access now retired and<br>fully um vegetated with native<br>plants River Management's been a big<br>part of the program because um uh River<br>erosion is such a large contributor to<br>sediment in the wiper um you can see<br>here on the left um the Tura stream<br>which is a tributary to the mo Kura<br>large um Mass B corrosion there from um<br>unvegetated Banks and the river cutting<br>in and so in this example we've used um<br>small rock groins to redirect stabilize<br>the bank and redirect the flow um often<br>we'll use vegetation groins um which<br>will also accumulate sediment and help<br>build um the bank back up<br>again we're also trying to avoid that<br>kind of Bank slumping and Bank loss um<br>we've been using gradient control<br>structures in the bed to reduce bed<br>degradation that happens because Rivers<br>have been historically<br>straightened degradation causes slumping<br>um so these are put in place made of<br>rock and they're also designed to<br>provide habitat diversity for fish<br>creating some um run rle pool habitat<br>and enable easy fish passage for our<br>native<br>species so over the program which has<br>been around I said 10 years but it's<br>basically nine years um here's some of<br>the outputs so um almost 500,000 mixed<br>natives have been planted in riparian<br>areas 300 km of fence seene eight 1,700<br>hectares have been retired of which 700<br>have been A5 fored um pop and Willow<br>poles 15,000 of those they stabilize um<br>Hill Country that's at risk of of mass<br>movement quick routing and absorbing of<br>water that's in those areas and more<br>than 300 River erosion control<br>structures and our Priority One<br>catchments um up here on the left is the<br>Moa kururu catchment and the right is<br>the canif fifar and this shows the sort<br>of coverage that we've had in these<br>catchments in terms of working with the<br>land owners um the green area is<br>conservation estate and the colored<br>areas represent the time time period<br>we've worked with those land owners but<br>essentially you can see we're getting<br>quite good coverage now and it has taken<br>a long time to build these relationships<br>and we by all means have not done all<br>the work we would like to see done on<br>these properties but over the 10 years<br>it's been a slow burn with some of the<br>land owners um both financially and<br>philosophically to make the changes on<br>profit and that is ongoing and really<br>need to acknowledge the river Authority<br>for continuing to support the program to<br>enable this slow change to happen but<br>we've worked with 50 to 60 um land<br>owners in each of those catchments now<br>and um we think it's a strength of the<br>program to have Council as an umbrella<br>organization in this instance because<br>that would be a lot of projects for the<br>W River authority to manage if they were<br>individual landowner projects<br>so how have things changed well here's a<br>quick Google Earth ripoff um this is the<br>uh omaru stream which is a tributory of<br>the Moa Kura in 2012 and 2021 you can<br>see in uh extends into the main test now<br>quite Dev vegetated in 2021 unstable<br>exposed raw Banks Now by working for<br>multiple different land owners almost<br>their entire length is um vegetated and<br>we're getting some hell<br>um revation as well so that doesn't<br>happen overnight and Shannon talked<br>about it as well the the slow change<br>over time that's been 9 years and still<br>a drop in the ocean um for the whole<br>catchment a really important part of the<br>project has been the supporting capacity<br>building and that's been our um our<br>commitment to our e Partners as well as<br>the authority when they have generously<br>funded us um and we're doing that<br>through um an undertaking to engage e<br>Enterprises were available to undertake<br>the work um we have approved e providers<br>some of who are here today um who can be<br>engaged automatically um up to a certain<br>amount we also wait the procurement for<br>Enterprises that employ iwari um to<br>undertake work we've taken an e student<br>intern each year for um three months<br>over summer to work on the project um<br>and that's a student who a puers to<br>either W or Tiner or Man portal um<br>and and some of those several of those<br>have actually gone on to full-time jobs<br>and and Council some of them are here<br>today and I won't mention who they are<br>they might be embarrassed um but like<br>Shannon um pointed out it's not just<br>about engaging e as contractors for the<br>work it's about um e leading the<br>projects that that are important to them<br>as well so as a part of the broader<br>project we've um supported E le projects<br>financially and and technically as well<br>um it's not not it's not about just us<br>doing the work and I remember actually<br>era saying to me when we were working on<br>the restoration strategy uh several<br>years ago that achieving the vision and<br>strategy wasn't just about achieving the<br>outcomes for the river it was about who<br>was doing the work and it really stuck<br>with me and it's been really important<br>to ensure that we are staff advocating<br>to council about how important it is to<br>continue to support the E Leed projects<br>and the catchment we really value our<br>partnership with pun River here and our<br>new partnership we've getting with<br>wilder Riv here and others um to share<br>the load of what is a huge<br>undertaking I know I'm getting short on<br>time but um in terms of monitoring we do<br>have monitoring set up this is designed<br>to man to measure long-term change in<br>the catchments um we have sedent<br>monitoring at the bottom of both the mo<br>Kur and the kifa catchment that's<br>ongoing and we expect that it will need<br>about 10 years before we can start to<br>say anything about Trends Mike's<br>probably thinking more like 20 but um<br>but yeah we've only had it for six so<br>far um we survey riparian<br>characteristics every four years which<br>um as someone out on the ground and<br>sometimes our students looking at uh the<br>amount of fencing stock excess Bank<br>errosion buff buffer wdth and the<br>catchments we take sediment snapshots<br>during high and low flows there wasn't a<br>lot of high flows on the last couple<br>years there was almost no low flows this<br>year um and we're measuring St s<br>stability using aerial imagery so<br>there's been 500 randomly selected site<br>one hectare sites in each catchment and<br>an assessment visual assessment of<br>active erosion is undertaken so there's<br>been 2012 2017 and 2023 has just become<br>available I don't have time to talk<br>about the monitoring now I wouldn't want<br>to get excited CU I did when I saw some<br>of the KY funny fire results but I know<br>that the sediment monitoring will have<br>taken a big hit once we bring in this<br>year's results because of the huge<br>amount of rain we've had in the<br>catchment so sentiment will be up again<br>but one good piece of news that we had<br>was um in terms of the KY funny far the<br>last riparian characteristic survey last<br>year which results from everyone's works<br>not just councils land owners everyone<br>working in the catchment the length of<br>fenced um stream bank had increased from<br>49% in 2017 to 65% in 2022 and<br>approximately 85% of the surveyed Bank<br>length was stable with no evidence of<br>erosion and that was um has been a<br>increase over time in terms of the<br>amount of eroding bank it's not yet<br>statistically significant but it's<br>something that we're really happy to see<br>and most of the lower catchment streams<br>that are in Dairy 95% are now fenced<br>excluded from<br>stock so upcoming work um we've just<br>received a further three years funding<br>which we're hugely grateful for from The<br>Authority we're going to continue to<br>focus on priority catchments and we're<br>looking to integrate our incentivized<br>programs with freshwater Farm plans<br>whatever that is now going to look like<br>under the new government<br>thank goodness 425 Mana is all I can say<br>for the W C<br>all and just really want to acknowledge<br>um our funders and also our e partners<br>for the ongoing support of this project<br>um and look forward to maybe when I'm 60<br>coming back and saying things are s look<br>better<br>so<br>and working together and collaborating<br>together uh but one read it all snap but<br>if there's many uh you it's unbreakable<br>so uh thank you for your Partnerships<br>with everybody and making sure that<br>everybody's projects uh get up off the<br>ground and awesome M I'm looking forward<br>to one day uh visiting the Cara stream<br>it's where my 2.0 fire was born before<br>mov moving into the Wake so one day I<br>hope to get there and check out that uh<br>that stream uh here talking about uh<br>together I want everybody to put their<br>hands up together like<br>this Ka now apparently that's sign<br>language for uh together and being<br>strong I got that from watching rise of<br>the pan of the<br>Apes ape strong together yes how I could<br>do there for ages as<br>well good movie by the way good movie<br>uh scrolling through Netflix and came<br>across that and learned some new sign<br>language Ka by thank you Caesar and to<br>all that I there all um Julian's cousins<br>way all right let's introduce our next<br>speaker uh Michelle is a skilled<br>environment professional with<br>significant exper experience in Project<br>managing large scale Wetland restoration<br>activities and scientific studies uh for<br>the past 5 Years Michelle has helped<br>coordinate freshwater bio security<br>activities for pfish in the W region and<br>as a work stream lead for the koi<br>management<br>programi and Michelle<br>Archer<br>everyone<br>um it's really funny hearing you guys<br>all at the start because there's so many<br>of us from Huntley and uh I think it's<br>just we all grow up in that area and<br>maybe learn to love our hour and that's<br>why we've all ended up here and um I<br>also jumped off the rail bridge in<br>Huntley when I was a teenager as well um<br>I can't believe that I did<br>that um and uh also when I grew up Cy<br>were not in my<br>hour so so um you know that's really<br>important to me uh they are there<br>they're right up to the swimming hall in<br>maturu so if you know where that is<br>that's where they finish um so this role<br>would not be possible without uh the<br>Waka Regional Council wo River Authority<br>and Department of Conservation and Tor<br>wo so along with me there's Amy McDonald<br>who's the project manager for the<br>program Nigel banks in the front row<br>so I know a lot of you may know this um<br>but why are they here um to us these are<br>an invasive species not native to us so<br>immediately we think we don't want them<br>um but they've been spread as result of<br>intentional human interactions from Co<br>fishermen so people grew up in other<br>countries and enjoyed fishing these<br>species and so then they ended up here<br>and and liberated on purpose throughout<br>our woodways so um there's also<br>accidental releases which I'll get to a<br>bit later um which you all might be<br>starting to understand check clean dry a<br>bit more now um and so the other thing<br>that is you know we've got a lot of<br>different cultures in New Zealand now um<br>so the Buddhist ritual of fang Shing the<br>life Rel release to Nature is also a big<br>big one for us um so radius slider<br>turtles for example are ones that are<br>often released mostly in Western Springs<br>in Oakland um you know we just because<br>we don't value these animals other<br>people do for other reasons so and I<br>think we have to recognize the<br>importance of these they are living<br>things but we don't really want them in<br>our<br>River um so the coin Management program<br>um so in 2021 Carri bodman and myself um<br>we already had a little bit of funding<br>from the Wako Regional Council so we<br>thought let's get more um and so we came<br>together in 2021 for an application to<br>the WR so we were successful um and yeah<br>so at the time um obviously<br>collaborative project we've got our<br>project Partners um but our priorities<br>were a little bit different back then<br>but it was kind of understanding coin<br>numbers because our last um accurate<br>count of koi was undertaken by Brendan<br>it all and um like early 2000s so things<br>have changed since then so it' be good<br>to build that understanding and also<br>starting to think about we all know that<br>certain times of year they come together<br>to spawn or move up and down Rivers so<br>how could we target them we have pivoted<br>a little bit since that but that sounds<br>like it's life uh for all of us in the<br>environmental space<br>um so the Koy Management program is<br>focused on I guess six work streams um<br>high priority infrastructure so you'll<br>be aware there are barriers and things<br>that can be built in rivers to stop koi<br>spreading so we're looking at them um<br>there's Operational Support for<br>Community projects or groups out there<br>who may want to look at koi projects T<br>aato is governance and technical support<br>and then we've got targeted programs<br>advocacy some aggregations and<br>surveillance and there's also future<br>Pathways um thrown in there just to add<br>a lot more stuff so as I said was<br>originally focused on aggregations but<br>we've had to Pivot a little bit but um<br>just so in case you don't know this is<br>my real cool drawing I did um the so<br>back in 1991 there was recognize that<br>there's very visible fish because it is<br>visible compared to any of the other<br>ones uh cuz they're big and orange and<br>they love to gulp for air at the top<br>surface um so they gazetted an area in<br>1990 that was it that red area um in<br>reality that other the picture over<br>there is actually where they are so you<br>know they they've far exceeded the um<br>containment Zone and they're in fully in<br>the W ho piao up in Northland and Caro<br>and wiper<br>River but it's not all bad news eh we do<br>have Correy lakes and areas in the wo<br>obviously we' got some of our gems at<br>the top there just because they're<br>beautiful and I just like to talk about<br>them but you know there's other ones<br>closer to home here where they actually<br>aren't so even over in ham Downs there's<br>few Lakes there that they haven't<br>actually got to and that's primarily<br>thanks to the rail bridge at<br>topy created a barrier probably and they<br>couldn't get up there so things like<br>that that we never we you know it's kind<br>of working in a balance so I'll get to<br>that but um so these are examples of<br>interventions that are currently in<br>place around the region so um we like to<br>uh I guess the focus is on things called<br>selective barriers so Pini stream um and<br>uh like cooi uh kind of selective so<br>allow the climbing fish natives to get<br>past but not um the bad koi perch rud<br>Etc uh and so like Ari Ari and like uh<br>oini y have a similar one to the one you<br>see there which is a oneway barrier<br>where they can get out but the big ones<br>can't get back which isn't you know<br>there kind of a ambulance at the bottom<br>of the cliff to be honest um because the<br>babies can still get up there but I<br>guess it stops those big ones just<br>initially going there<br>so um what ones am I working on um<br>recently uh well not recently in the<br>last year I've pretty much I'm pretty<br>certain that the mango no catchment is<br>corree so that comes into Hamilton City<br>at Hillcrest riverly sorry um so last<br>week we just completed um 48 Edna<br>samples around the whole catchment<br>trying to prove that that's Kree and<br>that's purely because of the um Waka<br>kotahi cover at dread n pool which is um<br>letting climbing fish pass so it's got<br>lots of tuna um red finin bullies um<br>things like that but um not uh pissed<br>fish maybe goldfish but yeah so watch<br>this space that's 250 km of um stream<br>right here that potentially doesn't have<br>koi so pretty exciting for me um and<br>we're also looking at wio it um next to<br>wior more commonly maybe known as Naro<br>um there's looking at potentially<br>building a selective barrier there um<br>back a few years ago W to dried out and<br>became koi free and we all know it's La<br>Nino whichever one it is it's hope well<br>not hopefully it may be a drought this<br>year and so we're trying to build a<br>structure um in anticipation of a future<br>drought so um Community projects very<br>important um this year we started uh<br>check clean dry at Lake kaputo uh five<br>months later they found gold clam um so<br>this year before that happened um yeah<br>we attended all of those events um<br>talking about koi because koi were<br>discovered in Lake KIRO in<br>2019 which was quite devastating but I<br>immediately thought there's so many<br>watercraft people use that Lake we need<br>to educate people about cleaning before<br>they move back to their own waterways so<br>um yeah we uh there was 13,800<br>competitors and over 25,000 Spectators<br>who would have heard that message but<br>I'm sure now there's a lot more people<br>know that message um T um are part of<br>the program on our governance they<br>undertake fishing in lake wuti as well<br>and have some processing um stuff that<br>they're doing with koi but I won't<br>talked about that cuz that's their Mahi<br>um but yeah to them if you want to learn<br>a bit more about that um but yeah we've<br>used them for um some of our biomass<br>trials and yeah we're talking to them<br>all the time as well um so what we have<br>done in regards to some science is some<br>biomass trials at Lake haahi um so it's<br>I don't know if you can see it but those<br>little circles are koi that you can see<br>so that's just a shot from um wahi and<br>you can see how visible they are and<br>that um yeah so it's actually<br>I mean you're not seeing the ones under<br>the water because the clarity in the<br>water is about 30 20 cm however um you<br>know it's a one way to give us a<br>snapshot of what's actually happening um<br>yeah so that was us catching um using<br>the University's boat um yeah so we've<br>andah um and yeah just continuing<br>advocacy with everyone out there sorry<br>I'm I'm rushing but I've got to get to<br>the point um so aggregations and<br>surveillance um we know where they a lot<br>of the areas have congregated like I've<br>taken information from a lot of people<br>in this room um have provided advice to<br>me um and at the moment we're not doing<br>any fishing although that was the aim at<br>the start I'll get to why not in a<br>minute um so it's continuing to<br>understand where they are and aren't<br>through our Edna work work um<br>and yeah there's we've got also God<br>Master student who's um completing Edna<br>detection research as well um so our<br>Pathways work is just we're kind of just<br>starting to reinvigorate these<br>conversations um so it could include<br>looking at legislation I guess I wrote<br>down um you know fishing within the<br>containment Zone requires a permit from<br>Dock and outside it's Mish so there's a<br>disconnect in the rules so creates<br>confusion for people who are out there<br>and want to catch them so it's just some<br>little things like that that make it<br>quite hard um you know how do we solve<br>this problem um you know it's it's a<br>pretty big problem but and what's the<br>cost of that we know we've got<br>information from Australia on what<br>they've tried to do in Tasmania and what<br>they're trying to do with the virus and<br>the maray darling but yeah it's quite a<br>lot so um I just thought I'd bring some<br>just as really to start conversations<br>with with people out there um it's<br>really hard um because Co species<br>management is<br>difficult um it's it's hard to see your<br>outcomes and people naturally get a bit<br>beaten down um I know some people in<br>this room have been in that role and it<br>is hard and it's just the nature of<br>biocurity I found so maybe we need some<br>counseling from biocurity<br>uh so keeping engagement with people and<br>staff to keep their enthusiasm is<br>important um and I guess it's like<br>focusing in on the areas where we can<br>make a difference and that's why<br>understanding some of the science and<br>how we may count them using drones or<br>how we could build a barrier here to<br>continue to keep them out of a specific<br>important lake is really important<br>um so yeah obviously we wanted to do um<br>fishing when K and I first put this<br>application in we were very ambitious um<br>let's fish out the aggregations of koi<br>um but the reality um is that there's<br>the lack little availability of people<br>to fish um I me and this is there's<br>probably people in this room who are<br>familiar with how to fish and are<br>confident in doing that but from an<br>industry Council dock perspective that's<br>a high-risk activity working on water so<br>there's a kind of Disconnect from health<br>and safety requirements which makes it<br>difficult for me to contract someone to<br>do some work um so you know the cost of<br>competencies and insurance is a barrier<br>for E to do some of this at times so you<br>know I just it's it's not a new thing<br>but it's just a different perspective we<br>have this in riparian planting as well<br>but you know it's how do we um build man<br>of people and get that work done um<br>they're difficult to catch ask anyone<br>who's tried to catch them they Clipper<br>and as soon as you try to shoot one of a<br>bow they don't come back um and you know<br>we've only eradicated them in small<br>isolated ponds in New Zealand and<br>there's no solution worldwide yet for<br>large scale eradication so that's<br>important to bear in mind and I guess um<br>we've learned that once fishing starts<br>you need to keep going forever but hey<br>there are challenges but there's also<br>opportunities um so everyone is is um is<br>engaged in this and wants to talk to me<br>about it I've been the koi lady for over<br>five years<br>now what a what a role um and um it's<br>you know it can be really rewarding<br>because I get to talk to so many amazing<br>people who are passionate um so yeah and<br>we've you know we've still got<br>opportunity as I mentioned waterways<br>where they aren't and ensuring they<br>don't get there um so you saw some of<br>the names of the lakes that they are not<br>at let's keep it that way by keeping<br>talking and if you see them somewhere<br>weird that you you've never really seen<br>them can let the KO lady know please um<br>so we've only got one year remaining so<br>we're kind of focusing on INF the<br>infrastructure things um and our<br>advocacy but um in the last couple weeks<br>actually I've been um leing with wak<br>Regional and vir schools I've met with<br>House of Science and talking about how<br>we actually bring it um knowledge of<br>freshwater bi security and use koi as<br>example into our schools and our<br>children because I got engaged of<br>science when I was seven years old so<br>you know how how do we keep bringing<br>that spark to our<br>tamiki um and you know is there a change<br>of legislation required so that people<br>it's actually easier for people in the<br>wak to harvest fish um so yeah there<br>everywhere um it's not feasible for wi<br>wides scale management I know we'd all<br>want that um but right now not possible<br>but you know there are places that we<br>can make a difference and we are so<br>that's what's important um so please<br>I'll be here the rest of the today so if<br>you have any Amazing Ideas relevant to<br>Koy please come see me my details are<br>there as well oh sorry I needed some<br>water kot thank you very much<br>here Michelle I suppose they are smart<br>fish it's probably the name right cuz K<br>and M mean sharp so they're probably<br>clever things uh I just see a video on<br>YouTube uh talking about this machine<br>that they had I think it was that Lake f<br>up here uh where the machine actually<br>separated the koi from the other fish<br>and then uh killed the fish and then<br>turned it into fertilizer that they use<br>uh to fertilize the replanting uh at<br>that place and then I went down to<br>another Lake and I saw some of uh the<br>fish and chip owners fishing for koi<br>made me suspicious of the old Snapper<br>that was on the menu<br>there they must have been really sharp<br>because about a couple of weeks later<br>the Snapper was off the<br>speaker is a land and water management<br>specialist with tribal research while<br>heite management processes and mang Mii<br>integration and land freshwater policy<br>uh experience his work includes the<br>design and development of M freshwater<br>management framework uh process<br>development and implementation of<br>cultural sites Landscape Management<br>within<br>policy<br>foree<br>for<br>um there's been some flash presenters<br>already uh not sure what Sam was on<br>about about keeping the bar low cuz I've<br>got up here and I can't even see the bar<br>so he um we we'll have crack we'll have<br>crack um and just to acknowledge the<br>Mahi that those presenters and everybody<br>is doing in this<br>space<br>um my presentation is going to take a<br>little bit of a different spin to what<br>we've uh what's been shared previous<br>previously<br>um and in the spirit of disclos<br>um after listening to all those flash<br>presenters I've made the executive<br>decision to uh Park my rather sterile<br>presentation and largely Wing this one<br>so bear with me bear with me if I go<br>kiwi<br>kiaha uh and if my time starts looking a<br>bit hairy somebody just raised the<br>eyebrows so oh<br>Bo um<br>yeah<br>uh so this project is looking at a<br>cultural landscape mapping for<br>RO um it's looking at revitalizing the<br>connection of our people back to our a<br>back to<br>relationship I we give a skip on that<br>one we know where we are the local<br>landscape obviously uh some significant<br>challenges like most of our River ewi um<br>over the last 200 years we've been faced<br>with some uh some major challenges in<br>terms of our<br>our and our relationship to those<br>species<br>um one of the one of the major<br>developments that has had had a massive<br>impact on us in rwa is the eight Hydro<br>uh this image here is of the arapuni<br>force uh which Now lies under Lake AR<br>and to give you an idea of the scale of<br>that so if you can see that man there<br>that's a person standing below y force<br>that just provides some context of<br>of I guess the changes that ouro has<br>experienced and our have experienced<br>over the last 200 odd<br>years<br>um uh fast forward to<br>today um obviously as River ewi we have<br>our co-management<br>agreements<br>um the uh the river settlements the<br>W um and so through those mechanisms<br>we've been able to actively participate<br>as our in our role as Kaki for the<br>hour um some of the presenters have<br>already spoken quickly and briefly about<br>the White cutle River restoration<br>strategy um in<br>2016 uh ourselves along with our River e<br>fonga also participated in that space<br>and we went through and tried to<br>identify our uh<br>our priorities as AI for the restoration<br>of the<br>WBA<br>um<br>yeah I guess through that process one of<br>the things that became really evident<br>for us was actually there's a massive<br>gap for<br>us as a people we had largely been<br>locked out of our the only access points<br>we had were three public access<br>points border and frame the wle river<br>all held in external<br>ownership and unless you were friendly<br>with the farmer or that land owner they<br>were just dots on maps that we couldn't<br>see or couldn't<br>access<br>so a little bit different to a lot of<br>the other e who were able to go and<br>identify specific projects our priority<br>was about how do we restore our<br>relationship as a people back to our<br>um we broke it up into a couple of<br>things the relationship was was the<br>first one for us it was Paramount that<br>for us to be able to do this Mahi we<br>need to restore our<br>connection the second thing that was<br>that as a result of the<br>uh many issues and many challenges we<br>faced faced a lot of our m toong had<br>been lost as<br>well<br>and the the shift for us was about<br>reclaiming<br>our but it was also about looking at<br>where we are<br>today and the other knowledge sets that<br>are available how do we utilize those<br>other knowledge sets to enhance our<br>people to build the capacity of our<br>people so we are able to become<br>effective and efficient<br>Kaki so those were the priority themes<br>with<br>um yeah those W were a really<br>interesting space for<br>us<br>um and with the Faro coming together and<br>sharing their aspirations for the a it<br>was really in hard<br>really really uplifting to hear them<br>talk about their aspirations for the a<br>so we knew knew the a was still very<br>important for us we knew the connection<br>was still really important for us so our<br>role was to try and to bridge that gap<br>fin one of the ways we looked at I<br>touched on using other knowledge sets to<br>help build the association and the<br>relationship<br>um with our a and what does Kaki look<br>like from a distance if you can't access<br>your if you can't access your a how do<br>you be<br>effective and obviously<br>through uh through our jmas our our<br>River settlements there's mechanisms<br>within there that enable us to to<br>uh activate our from those sorts of<br>spaces um one of the things we were<br>exploring is cultural landscapes and the<br>identification of our cultural landscape<br>and the protection of that cultural<br>landscape through District<br>plans<br>um really interesting quot we uh and I'm<br>going to read<br>this I thought I got pretty flash here<br>so<br>um we had we had a number of with Al and<br>um for our comar and for our people and<br>we explained to them look we're going to<br>Define this cultural<br>landscape um the objective is to seek<br>some protection measures through um<br>through the district plans um with the<br>hope that we<br>can uh affects<br>some or affects um best practice<br>Management on these on these Landscapes<br>so the first the first issue was what is<br>a cultural landscape and so at our first<br>w um the cord ital my brief I had I I I<br>shared with them was this a cultural<br>landscape is a living breathing canvas<br>that tells the story of human<br>interaction with the<br>environment it is not just about the<br>physical features of a place but also<br>the ways in which people have shaped and<br>been shaped by that space over<br>time think of it as a dynamic tempestry<br>woven with the threads of History<br>tradition and the everyday lives of the<br>people who have called that landscape<br>home it is essentially a snapshot of the<br>symbiotic relationship between humans<br>and their<br>surrounds so I thought that was pretty<br>flash um who the looks on the Kat's face<br>and the ra raised eyebrows told me<br>otherwise um yeah listen number one<br>um and so we had<br>this and we had<br>this and at the end of it they said ah<br>so all you want to know is where we used<br>to live where we used to eat where we<br>used to sleep we were used to fight we<br>were used to die and we were<br>buried oh yeah okay but I think mine's<br>fles but know that's that'll do yeah<br>come and so through process<br>um they said to me well that's easy why<br>do you need to define the extent of<br>that you just start at the tip of the<br>north island and you go all the way down<br>to the bottom of the South Island ter to<br>your cultural landscape you<br>know is a cultural<br>landscape however I guess for the<br>purposes of my didn't quite cut the<br>mustard so I had to flip the script a<br>little bit and rather than focus on the<br>cultural<br>landscape we focused on the M that<br>existed within that<br>landscape<br>um and we did that by by taking it in in<br>three different streams the first was<br>tangata who were the people who occupied<br>this space what were their connections<br>to this place what were their Puro what<br>were their<br>stories and what did those stories tell<br>us about them<br>and not only them but the the landscape<br>that they lived in in that time what was<br>some of the uh what are some of the<br>knowledge and M that existed in those<br>spaces and it was a really interesting<br>cordal because at the start of our W<br>when we started the process when we<br>spoke to our k a lot of blank faces and<br>they said oh yeah know you we didn't<br>really occupy those spaces but through<br>that cordal and through that F we were<br>able to unpack that actually they did<br>have a lot of cordal for those spaces<br>they were able to identify k and t who<br>who were in those spaces and so there<br>was a real richness and a real sense of<br>understanding and belonging that come<br>process<br>uh the next area we looked at was<br>Fina what of the stories that the can<br>tell<br>us so there are lots of hidden gyms<br>within the they can tell us so much<br>about who we are as a<br>people<br>uh<br>the 14 km stretch of our 14 pass sites<br>That's not including the many W that<br>exists within those spaces but there's<br>14 parides<br>why don't we know it's populated it was<br>a populated area heavily populated<br>area<br>um the other thing that was really<br>interesting about that process too was<br>we utilized the uh the ml<br>plant and we utilized ml plans to help<br>one identify wah<br>tapu but also to unpick some of the<br>names and<br>again<br>so there was so much in those names and<br>so much uh that we were able to gleam<br>from those names so that in itself again<br>was a really uh exciting process where I<br>finally moving through this project and<br>you know those W<br>became uh a place of real interest for<br>our fin they they really wanted to be<br>involved in those<br>cordal uh G just an image of some of the<br>email plans we<br>used<br>um our fin were along the W River<br>so we were able to go and<br>visit about 10 of our we were able to<br>get access to 10 of those sites<br>and you know ouri tapu are more than<br>just parids they are our classroom<br>they are<br>our<br>urupa they are our connection to the fua<br>and every time we visited those sites<br>the the amount of cordal and the<br>richness of their cordal was just<br>amazing and I I compare the w we had on<br>those to the W when we<br>had so in the offices and they aren't<br>comparable the the amount you can gleam<br>from from standing on the fina feeling<br>that breeze smelling that ear although<br>sometimes it was full of C<br>but you know there there is a real<br>richness to be able to stand on your fua<br>share that cord of the who occupied<br>those spaces and connect with it so yeah<br>that was that was again another<br>highlight for me in this<br>process<br>and the third and final piece to the to<br>the puzzle was the hour so we know what<br>the a looks like<br>now so from a once vibrant free<br>flowing uh river system to a pretty<br>stagnant slow moving uh network of<br>lakes um but what would it have looked<br>like for our<br>supera what with some of the challenges<br>and difficulties are to are faced with<br>the other where were the places they<br>fished where were the places they<br>crossed where were the places they<br>interacted in and again there was a<br>there was a<br>real<br>um a real richness in sharing some of<br>those cord that we were able to to learn<br>from<br>um one of the things we tried to do in<br>the<br>process was to pull on the imagination<br>of<br>Alo how do we how do we use some of the<br>technology we have available to us today<br>to to ignite a passion to build a<br>relationship and build a connection to<br>these places if you can't get to a get<br>to the hour or can't get to these<br>parides how do you bu build their<br>connection you got to remember this is<br>postco so before you follow started<br>jumping on zoom and and team meetings<br>where you used the the our visualization<br>project so this is p parite uh as it is<br>today and this was our attempt to<br>recreate uh P it of what it may have<br>looked like back in the day oh sorry p i<br>don't<br>P um we used the land survey plans that<br>we done back in 1934 I think it was the<br>first time pet we was surveyed so we we<br>thought we got pretty accurate to where<br>the old F sites were where the old Mar<br>know<br>P um is again it's it's a site that's<br>and<br>um again this was another attempt at at<br>trying to capture the imagination of<br>Alano and build that<br>relationship<br>um this is where it's going to get<br>tricky and I'm going to need some<br>assistance in this I think<br>yep<br>um cool thanks I just Ste it over<br>the so what we did<br>theur landscape cultural landscape<br>mapping website and so this again it's<br>journey be with<br>me um a bit of a journey around how the<br>landscape was identified it starts to un<br>pack some of the the M that we had<br>managed to<br>find<br>on this here is a is a bit of a flyover<br>using um using Google Earth oh<br>okay A bit of a flyover using Google<br>Earth to establish where we're talking<br>about in the world um starting at M to<br>moving down<br>through uh down towards the hour um one<br>of the things we we did was utilizing<br>the old ml plans we also identified the<br>old Ripple and old streams that would<br>have existed so these blue markings here<br>are some of the old stream systems that<br>that were there previously um largely<br>not<br>anymore<br>uh and then down<br>hour and so these are some of the par<br>sites but then moving up to the<br>a uh the darker blue is the a as it is<br>today and the lighter blue was the hour<br>uh as it was prior to the DMS being<br>built um and again just just a bit of a<br>sites<br>um and then also in defining the<br>at so what are the resources contained<br>within<br>Thea um to be honest once we had gone<br>through that three-phase process<br>actually identifying the extent of the<br>landscape was pretty easy really it it<br>was uh you know I think it was about a<br>30 minute W I really<br>was<br>um and so we also created PCO mapping<br>again to help build connection of our of<br>our T that we connected to those sites I<br>won't um I won't but you're more than<br>welcome to jump on and have a bit of a<br>tutu um so it gives some fua some of our<br>F Papa to the fina and also some of the<br>um some of the cord around the Tupa that<br>connect to<br>the<br>um again the landscape<br>resources looking at Manu looking at rco<br>their<br>uses um and again are they still found<br>so<br>and<br>and then finally the uh the<br>visualization project<br>um we we tried to use uh VR was it VR VR<br>the the um<br>3D and it was successful to a point but<br>it yeah it probably didn't quite hit the<br>mark like we would have hope to but<br>um yeah we were certainly looking to um<br>try<br>and<br>uh I guess build on that experience for<br>for the F so that's<br>um that that Mahi is hous in aroa<br>website accessible the for the Faro um<br>we have a number of Foo who utilize it<br>it's a really important tool for us in<br>our Mahi that we do on the hour as well<br>um and yeah it's a little about me I I<br>think um you know one of the things that<br>we do as a in our Mahi it's about<br>restoration of the hour but what I would<br>add is that it's through the restoration<br>of the hour it's also about the<br>restoration of the<br>uh<br>wow that session actually felt really<br>fast the Kur was really good and I think<br>what struck me um was the interaction<br>between um what we do at the river<br>author policy Partnerships and and<br>projects and you need all three to be<br>successful and when I look back and and<br>think about I think maybe 2006 to8 Ed<br>Shane Tim with Lady RHA went around the<br>muu to ask people how they feel about<br>this new this this way we want to go and<br>looking after our<br>a what lady RHA was doing was creating<br>friendships she had a guide in her mind<br>to create Friends of the river and it<br>was through all of us cuz she was quite<br>clear<br>um we can't do this alone and so we<br>needed to create Partnerships and<br>friends and and even further that when<br>we spoke to the other e she said Creator<br>a to be a part of this discussion but<br>for them to look after the house that<br>they and the way they want to but let's<br>all have the same aspiration at least<br>and you see that aspiration to restore<br>and protect the health well wellbeing of<br>the W cutle River and all it Embraces<br>for future generations and all of these<br>projects but just delivered in a<br>different way the priority for Anu was<br>around theu and of significance and<br>regenerating that that partnership uh<br>with with our with their<br>a um and then on top of that needing<br>policy to protect those sites if they<br>decided to you didn't have to do that<br>before you had<br>T you had a Taha in your face if you did<br>something wrong you know but through<br>these Partnerships and the projects we<br>need some policy to support that and the<br>same with K's Mahi you know um we we<br>knew we needed a tool as a regulatory<br>tool to to to set a standard to set a<br>bar through policy and and through the<br>wiar restoration projects there's some<br>policy set around that but also the<br>Partnerships with all the all the<br>property owners and the funding uh not<br>just through the riveral authority but<br>to accelerate that work so we can see<br>outcomes faster and then we have the Koy<br>lady at the end she's got some some<br>contradicting um policy to deal with<br>again one of the the outcomes sought by<br>the settlement was to unify 20 pieces of<br>legislation they seem to talk<br>differently to each other they seem to<br>say I think the best example we had AA<br>was around white bait if you wanted to<br>go and uh put on your white Bait Stand<br>you had to go and talk to Doc if you<br>wanted to put in a structure there's<br>health and safety for District Council<br>but the fishery itself was managed by<br>someone else and the regul set with the<br>ministry of fisheries and so so um poor<br>Michelle is having to deal with um<br>conflicting information and you know<br>she's the koi lady we have Ed at the<br>back there it's called the tuna lady we<br>got I'm part with seven kids he's the<br>L's<br>man oh I I wonder he's going to<br>get wonder he's going to have the<br>microphone lost<br>today um so let's take some party um I'm<br>going to get a message when lunch is is<br>ready so we'll keep going until then uh<br>Michelle I'll take one from Michelle and<br>then uh if someone here wants to ask a<br>question you may not be able to log into<br>slid so you will have a think um<br>Michelle part okay I've got a question<br>for krie how did you convince farmers of<br>the need to aforest their land did it<br>include building alternative economic<br>uses for the<br>lands is this on I have<br>to can do it on yeah um um yeah like I<br>say it's been a it's been a slow journey<br>and certainly as Julian was just talking<br>about um the complimentary regulation<br>that was coming assisted with that and<br>because we have the vision and strategy<br>and then healthy Rivers plan change that<br>was coming plan change one coming<br>through that so farmers and through<br>industry support as well I me Fones had<br>a had um a big role in that farmers um<br>were looking to make change and the<br>additional funding that was available um<br>helped um us to I guess convince them<br>that going beyond what was required was<br>for regulation would be um an advantage<br>for environmentally but could also have<br>advantages for their um farm management<br>and when we talk to people now who have<br>undertaken those um kind of projects<br>they talk about the fact that in some of<br>those areas they now don't have to drag<br>cattle out of those areas anymore um<br>they they don't they're not missing the<br>productivity that came limited<br>productivity that came from those areas<br>but across the board unanimously is that<br>they wouldn't have done the work without<br>that high level of funding and so<br>without that without that 75 kind 70 to<br>75% funding it just would have been<br>unaffordable so that's really what has<br>gotten them over the<br>um partic participating in the<br>coer um is there um cultural practices<br>that our people use in the tuna um<br>Co<br>anyone<br>this well Michelle's having having to<br>think um uh I do remember sitting with<br>um<br>Papa<br>Um Papa di green and he was going trying<br>he was testing out uh using um<br>Loy yeah to to shift and create a<br>barrier and hopefully but I don't think<br>the koi come over but he caught them and<br>smoked<br>them um so yeah not that I can think<br>of is being used yeah we did get a lot<br>of applications from we at the tribe<br>about permits for different types of um<br>of capturing them with um the FL net<br>sizes and a range of things with hooks<br>underneath but I don't know if any of<br>them were ever yeah so I mean I'm not<br>again I'm not a Fisher person I'm a a<br>paper pusher but um yeah I guess that's<br>Brendan is sitting there raising his<br>hand so he might actually have comment<br>do you want to Brendan to say the<br>difficulties I guess that's the thing in<br>Tia Lakes everyone's seen the catfish<br>killers work um that's cuz catfish are<br>really easy to catch in<br>hinaki um yeah so um yeah and it's<br>trying yeah where you go Brendan tell us<br>how to catch a<br>koi um well you won't like some of the<br>methods that I have but but dick green<br>did have some ideas<br>and of using sorry what was the word<br>wear w so um and and and building a<br>brush wear with actually sort of like a<br>little bit of high-tech sort of<br>aluminium to sort of keep it more stable<br>and guiding them because the the the<br>weak the the the weakness of a koi is<br>that they migrate yes and so so when<br>they migrate you can kind of you know<br>sort of Channel them into an outlet or<br>an let and um and put them in a trap and<br>um and the uh aies have done this on<br>some of their fish<br>ways so I mean there there are<br>alternatives and I guess we had seen<br>that with the Trap they had on the<br>outlet of the fish pass at Lake quat um<br>but I mean amazing concept it's just<br>unfortunately that area was not the<br>right place for that trap just because<br>of the operation of the flood of the<br>lake basically so yeah<br>Michelle um IU is the story met on J<br>available publicly for others to use yep<br>yeah it is um you'll see oh in uh the<br>presentation I think it's getting sent<br>out Jules is that correct there's a link<br>on there um otherwise you can just jump<br>on our Ro website and go through<br>there<br>I'm wondering if there's a lot of<br>questions here I'm wondering if we try<br>and get the presenters to answer some of<br>these online um because I know that<br>we're we're short on time I carry on ask<br>us another one okay go for a couple more<br>um all right try and get a variety going<br>on here uh so KY have any science<br>studies considered contraceptive<br>adults<br>yeah so the question was if you didn't<br>hear it is there contraceptive an option<br>to to there's sterile male um technology<br>out there sorry guys no um the I guess<br>um so that's actually being tried um by<br>TI and B Regional Council with Nea<br>breeding sterile male catfish and then<br>releasing them into the wild um and then<br>uh over time um they you know there's no<br>males for them to breed with and they<br>die so um so that's the theory um does<br>it work for koi<br>Brendan so so back to the Aussies again<br>and Ron thresher had a program where<br>they were sort of trying to breed<br>daughterless carp um for years and years<br>and years and I never heard that it made<br>any real success because they didn't<br>really understand the genetics<br>controlling the koi breeding but I think<br>one of the bigger problems and I don't<br>know how the catfish went was that you<br>would have to breed up so many sterile<br>males to overwhelm the wild males in a<br>population so you'd sort of need to fish<br>them down and then sort of supplement<br>with the genetic<br>altered fish and and there's several<br>problems there the sheer cost of raising<br>the um sterile males um and and the<br>point is that they would actually pass<br>their genes on and<br>produce only males if there were enough<br>of them but then you simply for the W<br>you know what was my estimate 400,000<br>adults in L W carry um you know they<br>going to sa a fair bit of breeding to<br>overrun those and the problem is that<br>they move around the catchment so much<br>that you could deal with one Lake for<br>instance but unless you could stop the<br>Wild Ones moving back in they would soon<br>overwhelm those efforts so it's just the<br>logistics of them undertaking 200<br>kilometer migrations up and down the<br>wado in and out of<br>lakes thank goodness you're here<br>Brandon<br>sure um outside of partnering with e how<br>do you hold space for matang Mari or<br>projects I think that's a question for<br>anyone who wants to have a go it we<br>start<br>G I guess for for me um us I mentioned<br>the barrier projects which are you know<br>trying to keep um fish out pest fish out<br>of significant sites and those are sites<br>that are significant e and you know I'm<br>not going to sit up here and say why<br>those are significant that's other<br>people's um qu but um yeah that's one<br>part of one small aspect of our program<br>is protecting those things that are<br>important and that's what I see for<br>freshwater bi Security in general um I I<br>have a big focus on freshwater bi<br>Security even though I'm the koi lady um<br>there's many pests under that water that<br>we can't see um so you know um how do we<br>protect the native Koo species and uh<br>mind uh yeah so didn't have time to<br>really talk about it in the main<br>presentation but it's probably more on a<br>a site by sight basis I mean the whole<br>the whole program was um developed with<br>significant input from E and driven by E<br>actually at the start um but um a lot of<br>the work that we're doing quite a lot of<br>the land that was cleared um in the<br>upper wiper um is owned by multiple<br>multi-owned land owners and often the<br>the management of that land was um<br>contracted out to lands and surve by<br>mold Affairs and so there wasn't<br>necessarily even the owners of the land<br>um approving the clearance um and so<br>their aspirations for that land on um<br>and Rehabilitation that's on a site by<br>site basis so there's a number of<br>examples um for example there's one that<br>we visited recently actually with you<br>guys where there's the marai on the edge<br>of the farm and there's a Skool nearby<br>and um and part of the restoration of<br>the river um includes um reh in those<br>places um has Rian planting influenced<br>water temperatures and can this assist<br>with water temperatures and future<br>um so there's probably people I'm<br>looking at Tony peit for example you<br>know who might be Bryce Bry coofer you<br>know the gurus in this in this field<br>from Regional council's perspective I<br>know for the clean streams program there<br>were a lot of sites that were set up to<br>monitor the impacts of riparium planting<br>um along those areas I think it was<br>pretty well established that temperature<br>reductions um um were able to be seen in<br>a relatively short time time period<br>through shading um our climate change<br>work is more around resilience of<br>catchments to mass um events retaining<br>um water and Headwaters and and upper<br>catchment so that you're not getting<br>Mass losses and and events and loss of<br>land I don't know if um Tony or Bryce or<br>Mike want to respond around water<br>change if you can do it in one<br>minute that'll be<br>good put put your hand up go go one<br>minute<br>please you sorry but K K's absolutely<br>right is that long in terms of the so in<br>terms of the water temperature<br>um if you start off in small<br>streams controlling temperature you do a<br>lot better than in wider streams it's<br>obvious and and that of course feeds<br>into the bigger streams further down so<br>um you know look after the look after<br>the small streams and and the bigger<br>streams looked after as well so I think<br>I think it had would have a mitigating<br>change cou Michelle go one more one more<br>uh can Adu tell us more about how he<br>accesses maps and the process and costs<br>in building the landscape<br>website um yeah so I guess through our<br>treaty settlement Arrangements we we<br>have a database full of um all the old<br>email Maps um we also and I can't<br>remember the the name of the website but<br>there is a website we subscribed to<br>somebody out there my m recall it um<br>that has got all the old email<br>maps in terms of the development of the<br>website it was<br>um I can't tell you off the top of my<br>head but it was<br>relatively cheap in the scheme of things<br>I think the biggest the biggest piece of<br>Mahi was<br>actually um identifying what we wanted<br>to be included in that in that website<br>um and it's just hosted on story maps<br>and uh we P an annual subscription which<br>is relatively low as as<br>well is there one more burning question<br>from the floor our lunch chairs arrived<br>they're just sitting<br>oh some of you know me some of you don't<br>just a series of websites will be<br>forwarded to Julian and the team<br>regarding where to is some of those data<br>sets<br>emails um archival stuff archaeological<br>stuff who we if you see us flooding<br>around come and have a<br>chat thanks marke just I want to touch a<br>little bit on man he was one of those<br>guys that was begrudgingly moved from<br>doing practical stuff on the ground with<br>his Faro into a policy role and<br>eventually into an Environmental<br>Management role he didn't really want to<br>do it but he but he got there and uh so<br>congratulations um H and so we we're<br>going to finish up um this round um so<br>lunch is out in the same space we've got<br>an hour we might cut that back part will<br>give us give us a call uh what was I<br>there was one more I think sorry when I<br>when I think about all the piss species<br>you know we've had koi it's really hard<br>cuz like any mother the river accepts<br>them more and looks after them all and<br>it kind of needs kind of sense to say<br>actually that's you know that um that<br>foster child you're trying to look after<br>is a bit ha uh you know but but she does<br>and it's even harder when your comat<br>give those pests<br>names and um dick green was one he would<br>say yeah they<br>Co and so it becomes part of a and and<br>and Tipper touched on it earlier about<br>well what what what what could their<br>purpose be here if any um but if it's if<br>it's not going to heal our we have to<br>make those decisions ourselves um yeah<br>so let's finish up I'll just ask uh to<br>provide our presentations of the small<br>Tong acknowledgement of your time you've<br>put into developing your presentation<br>your Mahi and coming here and spending<br>some time with us to share your<br>knowledge so you can come around the<br>front so Edo will be speaking tomorrow<br>but um for those you don't know edin is<br>also a board member on the W riveral<br>Authority<br>this<br>f<br>this we we're waiting for a couple more<br>to uh to come in thought i' talk a<br>little bit about uh some of the hory of<br>our uh somebody talked a little bit<br>about uh the Ina and the names some of<br>our historical sites and how important<br>they are and um especially in you know<br>inel Mali it always is attached to a<br>story and that's what's so special about<br>our names uh rather than the North isand<br>and the South Island it's a little bit<br>dry right so all our all our Ina have<br>stories and historical narratives behind<br>them uh for those of you who don't know<br>wasn't always called it was first<br>called uh ta being one of the uh uh to<br>or a high priest upon the W on the tyu<br>uh uh just after they hauled the the tin<br>canoe across the white<br>coast and then he came down and saw the<br>and he named it after himself as they<br>did it wasn't until a couple hundred<br>years later and a few Generations later<br>uh due to a story between uh Waring<br>fathers if you like mahang and kak and<br>who kako had a<br>son Mah had a daughter called and during<br>their marriage which was unbeknownst to<br>both fathers that this was happening uh<br>they had a son uh but during those times<br>uh in order for the son to be blessed uh<br>uh the son had to be blessed by his<br>grandfather and that forced uh kak to<br>come to Huntley at a place called typod<br>which is an island in the middle of the<br>W of towa uh to uh say to his father<br>that oh he's your grandson furthermore<br>this is a shortened version of The Story<br>by the way um this is your grandson uh<br>you're going to have to bless him and by<br>the way your mortal enemy mahang this is<br>his daughter and the mother of this<br>child uh he then uh CED the water into<br>word I'll cusp this water and I'll place<br>it on your head and I'll baptize you and<br>I'll name you w and so w is the name of<br>that<br>child uh is named after that child and<br>uh and that's where W uh gets its name<br>was from that baptism of uh of way so I<br>thought i' just throw that in there and<br>uh before we get started um it's awesome<br>to listen to all the cordal that's<br>happened thus far and and talk about the<br>Innovation uh that innovative ideas that<br>have come out of all of our F who have<br>come up here to to present their uh<br>their co-a and and I'm reminded of how<br>resourceful and how on to and how<br>Forward Thinking us SM are you know one<br>of Julian's uncles was drinking down at<br>uh the Huntley Pub once uh I think in<br>the 60s back when Neil Armstrong took<br>the first step for mankind on the moon<br>and uh one of the other Paro turned<br>around to Julian's Uncle says see that<br>bro we just put a man on the moon and he<br>goes whatever bro we're going to put a<br>man on the sun and he goes you can't do<br>that he'll get all burnt up CU not if he<br>goes at<br>night see he there's always a way F know<br>there's always a way cover<br>on all right get into it<br>home um well he has dedicated his career<br>to the betterment of the T the<br>environment has experienced spans from<br>working in local government uh funding<br>agencies central government and E in his<br>current role as po environment uh<br>environmental manager for Wake Jaden<br>oversees a commercial tribal nursery and<br>the delivery of conservation work on<br>behalf of the fak or Incorporated and<br>this is where we uh where we house today<br>in the faka building and it's 68 M that<br>represent the uh his aspirations are to<br>grow his people's M knowledge systems<br>across a wide spectrum of environmental<br>Matters from environmental restoration<br>climate resilience resource management<br>and environmental policy while creating<br>opportunities for wake of the tin marai<br>to influence the protection of their<br>natural resources and maintaining their<br>TI and cover Within These<br>spaces environmental<br>manager jadden<br>FASA<br>Robert<br>for<br>uh how are we doing today um like<br>Natasha pointed out I've got the<br>challenge to get you after lunch um but<br>also want to to<br>talk yo um the quo that's been spoken<br>before me um we're quite privileged to<br>have a lot of tribal members who who are<br>um doing this Mahi in the space and this<br>restoration space um so I just want to M<br>out to to to them and also M out to our<br>partners Regional Council we got Mercury<br>we had a few on on on on on that's been<br>presenting or talk talking about um<br>certain things sponsors of of the W<br>River Authority um before I go any<br>further I just wanted to talk about<br>although we're in a restoration sort of<br>space just wanted to talk about who we<br>are<br>K in terms of so we have 68 marai<br>33u 86,000 tribal Members Plus um I just<br>wanted to give you some context first<br>before we go down the restoration place<br>um space I would normally give you a<br>historical overview cuz it's all<br>relative to get to where we are now but<br>because of the 15 minutes and I know<br>we're running over time just give you a<br>quick little update so this is this is<br>beforehand so this is us this is where<br>we cover although we're talking about<br>the W River Symposium these are all F<br>Papa back to the river the river as well<br>as our Coastal and and our lands up in<br>Tamaki and below so just it gives you a<br>bit of context to how many people invest<br>invested into our white CLE River you<br>know it it's it's it's a resource we can<br>pull on CU there a lot of people who are<br>very passionate about our hour and our<br>tile going forward with that we'll go<br>through teaka our guiding document which<br>is faka 2050 the reason I brought this<br>up so this is the long-term strategic<br>plan for<br>wtin um we've been hearing about that<br>what's the long-term goals what's the<br>longterm<br>plans 2050 talks about TI well allows<br>our tribal members to have that and how<br>we get there so we have<br>mahu so Community environment there's<br>economic aspirations we want our people<br>to be strong and T in their real going<br>forward this is all relevant because<br>looking at the holistic view for our wak<br>River we always say if if our land or<br>hour is healthy then our people are<br>healthy vice versa if our people are<br>healthy our land can be healthy too or<br>hour so this is looking at the<br>holisticals of just looking at a plant<br>or restoration project and just focusing<br>on that one plant or that one<br>restoration project this is the<br>long-term Vision you know we understand<br>that you know for restoration putting on<br>my experience that we only plant in the<br>winter but what's the year round vision<br>for that the monitoring the pest control<br>the plant pest control and the plant<br>animal or the P Animal Control What can<br>you as Kaki and Kaki of your<br>organizations do to incorporate our<br>people to be part of the project for<br>years to come we're talking generational<br>projects you know um also keep it in<br>mind and I took talk of some coridor<br>beforehand for our people they were<br>Exile exiled from our lands they were<br>bandn so for them this is the<br>opportunity to come back to their lands<br>that they have never seen for a long<br>time so I just wanted to plug that plug<br>that there because I know we've got a<br>lot of people from a lot of different<br>spaces we're fortunate enough that we<br>got some um partners that have been<br>working in the space for a long time but<br>the other conversation I have is our<br>people stay everyone else sort of<br>changes and leaves and with that the M<br>goes from our partners and therefore we<br>find ourselves training those people<br>again where if you if you keep<br>us as part of your project forever more<br>then stays and so it's just it's just<br>the it's just a sort of Widow to all of<br>you to to continue to engage our manao<br>from the ground up so that's what I<br>wanted to bring it cuz this the<br>holisticals<br>uh sh lightly from my personal view I<br>want to say from the white view that um<br>white ma in general are tree huggers<br>they we we just want to restore and<br>that's it um we're not we have economic<br>aspirations we have cultural aspirations<br>we have social aspirations so keep that<br>in mind we we want to capture everything<br>and we can capture everything the cor I<br>talk about a lot and why to Robert<br>Robert who who's a key figure in<br>actually creating the W um back in 1995<br>when M tanu settled have you would you<br>ever thought that in 15 years time a w<br>River Authority would been established<br>have you ever thought that a $210<br>million fund would have been directed<br>specifically for wak River have you ever<br>thought that the river area Collective<br>would come together with co-governance<br>that's scary with coverance that's<br>coming down from Cal government but with<br>co-governance with crown partners Dan I<br>normally get you know nah we never<br>thought that would happen yet where here<br>we are today and we get to have these<br>Wanger today so that's the resilience of<br>us as a people just like our tile we've<br>gone through it we've navigated these<br>spaces but we're still resilient and<br>we're still optimistic that we can<br>achieve the outcomes that everyone's<br>been talking about today so that<br>initially goes through the half that<br>then turns into the he and wellbeing of<br>the river that's what we all trying to<br>achieve all of us in this room so that's<br>why I wanted to give you that context<br>first just to give you the holistic view<br>the overview everything that captures<br>everything CU that's the direction we<br>want to head in it's not just the<br>restoration it's not just about the<br>plants going into the ground it's the<br>everything you know that's everything so<br>I just wanted to stamp that um as we<br>move forward so Al po so as obviously I<br>work for the ti team um I just want to<br>speak about a couple of them climate<br>change um very broad very difficult we<br>all know that uh but with climate change<br>for our people<br>it came back so what I forgot to talk<br>about is the way we reached our 2050<br> is our 5year plan so for our 5year<br>plan we'll create milestones and and and<br>sort of time frames to how we're going<br>to achieve certain things within within<br>um our pove right here so climate change<br>is something that um some of the team um<br>where's lorine you come in she must be<br>outside she's very shy she um created um<br>uh climate change resource booklet you<br>know just to start the conversation the<br>biggest challenge you're going to have<br>and I think You' all have it is what<br>does data look like and how do you<br>translate that to our people or to the<br>farmer or from the scientist to the<br>business planner so those are the<br>challenges we have the only way we get<br>around that is w and this comes back to<br>what I talked about before engaging our<br>man how they looks like on The Mod ey<br>talk to them what you're trying to<br>achieve and then the the results are<br>come from that building the people um<br>building the skills of our people out<br>don't might it's a typo typo um so we<br>run a training program um just last week<br>we did our first aid kit our first aid<br>um certificate with some of the people<br>in this room but this is mainly creating<br>opportunities for our people to<br>participate so could be uh Grace safe or<br>could be project management training um<br>from on the ground to high level<br>Commissioners training which we had<br>successfully 17 Commissioners past that<br>training but what I mean was it's also<br>thinking bigger so as a commissioner if<br>you don't understand you actually to get<br>on a panel when it comes to Resource<br>consenting you you actually need<br>experience before you get on to those<br>sort of panels um or get nominated to<br>jump on the panel so those are the next<br>steps we're looking into investment into<br>a Fina so basically restoration projects<br>monitoring where we can we support our<br>Fu in those spaces could be a consultant<br>could be direct linkage or facilitating<br>H with our faru with Partners like<br>Regional Council who are doing that M<br>anyway so it's partnering that up um tto<br>toine mon vision and strategy we should<br>all know about that um it's definitely<br>one of our p portfolios or one of the<br>guiding principles within our team how<br>do we continue to achieve that you know<br>always pushing always pushing our<br>partners always pushing our people or<br>our people pushing us so we can achieve<br>that and continue to achieve that for<br>our next Generations<br>anti I plug that in so the biggest thing<br>for I'm taking opportunity now to tell<br>everyone e have their own e<br>environmental plans if you TI to party<br>is our one<br>um it never gets r from our partners and<br>it comes out quite obvious that it<br>doesn't um unless from a slick view so<br>whether you're an organization or you're<br>just a contractor or consultant or<br>something like that read our<br>environmental plans they're awesome it<br>gives you all this and a book it looks<br>pretty big but it's it's not too<br>daunting once you get into it and we<br>also you know the need there offer<br>workshops to go through it not only for<br>our our people but for our partners and<br>then something can the pop as well so<br>this all incorporates into the next<br>project um disclaimer I've only been on<br>for a few months I've been in the<br>community for a while but I've been on W<br>Ton's uh pay off for a few months if you<br>get paid<br>um the next project is eventually<br>through all the training for that<br>the holistic views is something that we<br>want all Ed to think about it's called<br>the r Kura um planting project if you<br>weren't aware the r superhub um I'll let<br>the doing the talking strategically I<br>put a video on as well cuz it takes<br>about 5 minutes um but that's hearing<br>from our people that's the people who do<br>the work on the ground that's<br>incorporating the economic views the<br>social procurement everything in a<br>nutshell and I'll let the video to<br>talking<br>itself<br>please a huge part of our vision the fck<br>to put on a 2050 is utilizing all of our<br>business opportunities that we create<br>and support our Tribal member businesses<br>to be able to be part of it their teams<br>also include you know tribal members the<br>good thing is is that we're starting to<br>see that economy work that circular<br>economy the tribes investing money that<br>dollar is going further as a result of<br>our tribal members being involved in the<br>actual doing and implementing of this<br>development the network native plant<br>Supply is a collaboration between<br>Hamilton city council woo and bofer mcll<br>to deliver over 310,000<br>plants 1,800 trees and prepare over<br>82,000 square m of bare land and return<br>it to its native<br>Origins B school's been involved in this<br>part of the Project Aura with the<br>landscape design the aim of the planting<br>strategy is to develop a collaborative<br>process for the landscape implementation<br>from Papa sourcing seed right<br>through to planting and<br>maintenance my team were put together<br>they're all tribal members basically my<br>job is to give them the opportunity to<br>actually do something on the land you<br>know get them to learn new skills it's<br>my responsibility I think as Tri member<br>to teach our young<br>ones SOI trust is involved ATA to grow<br>plants deliver plants and plant the<br>plants on site it's important for us<br>that the seeds are ecosource locally and<br>tamah working ATA has enabled Mahi trust<br>to expand our nurseries and expand our<br>kahi creating more employment and also<br>space is mar based initiative with a<br>vision for safe places healthy Waters<br>and healthy people we're fortunate<br>enough to be a part of the r Kura Inland<br>Port works as the major plant supplier<br>of high- grade Quality Plants the cool<br>thing about it though was just<br>connecting in the first place and<br>working collaboratively with all<br>stakeholders on this project so yeah<br>it's pretty<br>cool with the Ruda Port came the<br>opportunity for w to supply their own<br>project with their own<br>plants most of my team love their job we<br>like getting our hands diry and if we<br>don't do it ourselves it doesn't seem to<br>uh fulfill our um W and all that stuff<br>this is sort of um filling the cup for<br>me and hopefully it will do so for many<br>more<br>years the name of my business ISU and<br>the reason I started was to get all our<br>far from T involved with tile planting<br>and working on the fina has helped me<br>build the capacity I started off with<br>four people and now I've got 10 what do<br>I love about it being out in the open<br>just being one with nature obviously<br>working along with all my<br>umu sort of come in as a supervisory for<br>these young fellows here I'm the uncle<br>so yeah makes it easier for them to<br>listen to me but you know we always seem<br>to get the job done we haven't really<br>have much opportunities so it's good to<br>actually have one especially for our<br>people you know within the last planting<br>season we've seen great growth between<br>our tribal Network in terms of<br>businesses skills and qualifications we<br>originally started the project planting<br>just under 2,000 plants per day now our<br>planting teams are reaching between<br>6,000 to 8,000 plants which is competing<br>with the best of the best in the<br>industry teer project management has<br>been involved in this project from the<br>beginning of the year we've really<br>enjoyed the challenges and the success<br>we've seen within the tribal businesses<br>and we look forward to building on this<br>and completing the project on time and<br>on<br>budget working on rura is the Great<br>example to challenge other projects in<br>the country that it's really important<br>to work with manaa it's important that<br>manaen are involved and it's important<br>that Mana lead the way for our future<br>we're really proud of this project I<br>want to acknowledge all the Fino<br>contributing to make this a real success<br>this is ala ultimately it was returned<br>as part of the OPA to you know having Al<br>reconnect with their F true planting is<br>is one way to do<br>that<br>so that you know captures everything um<br>we've got a few of ouro up there if you<br>want to get any questions also was a<br>good plug to Market some of our<br>businesses they've got any Mahi give<br>them a call give me a call and I I'll<br>Point them 3 but that captures<br>everything we're trying to do at wony<br>support our fers so they can do it<br>themselves you know and that's that's<br>all we can do and we we we want to do<br>so um<br>Mar yeah 86,000 tribal members I've done<br>my bit to add to that uh Kaka the rest<br>of you<br>uh another thing that I really liked<br>about that video is actually reminded me<br>and about some of the cord about talking<br>about you know getting a connection with<br>the and reconnecting our people back to<br>the hour as well and there was a picture<br>on there about we to seen the Waka uh<br>the um uh the oh je what are they called<br>nowaka on the on the river we run a<br>program called<br>the and it's an awesome program where<br>two representatives from each of our 68<br>marai I get an opportunity to go all the<br>way to W iy uh the beginning of the wo<br>River and then travel along the river<br>all the way<br>to uh learning about all the historical<br>sites along the way and they just<br>finished I don't don't know what cohort<br>that was but they just finished doing<br>the titoo and they'll be taking uh<br>another uh set of registrations for that<br>uh in the new year but that's something<br>that I think a lot of eie should be<br>looking at doing if you're not doing it<br>already is running programs like that to<br>reconnect your e and your Hau back to<br>your a uh moving on uh our next speaker<br>uh is operations manager at w to River<br>and the lead coordinator uh of an<br>ongoing restoration<br>ongoing restoration efforts at this<br>project uh in 2021 Riveria successfully<br>secured funding from the W of the river<br>authority to support fencing and<br>planting outcomes in the upper catchment<br>of the punga punga Wetland this year's<br>planting Target is 45,000 plants with<br>37,9 already planted within a 25 hectare<br>area uh Kev was previously employed at<br>the Department of Conservation working<br>in the other way uh kard program and the<br>F Marino Wetland the pyy from W the<br>Hutchinson<br>k um thank you very much for uh that<br>introduction and uh Jaden's uh big<br>picture uh uh presentation beforehand<br>um uh this uh today pardon me just a m a<br>fluster here but<br>uh forgot my<br>glasses writing is very<br>small um<br>so panga panga Whitland uh is<br>um<br>uh<br>it's all right I'll get there I'll get<br>there try to feel younger than I am um<br>so the panga Wetland uh project um uh<br>was uh initiated uh by by our land<br>owners and and partners uh with a goal<br>to protect this guy up<br>here austral Asian uh biton um it is a<br>partnership between land owners uh and<br>our f ERS with the goal to uh extend and<br>Wetland so our key outcomes for this<br>project uh was to expand the habitat<br>that's there because the uh the area had<br>been impacted uh by drainage activities<br>post first world war and second world<br>war and the habitat was obviously<br>modified as a result of the land<br>drainage<br>um so we wanted to increase the extent<br>of that for the biton uh part of that<br>process was winding back some of the<br>improvements done to that Fina uh by<br>excluding stock from areas um creating<br>zones for the bird to uh feed in and uh<br>doing some complimentary native<br>plantings uh to establish further<br>indigenous zones around the site um<br>you'll see uh our six key goals there um<br>uh we're working towards uh probably<br>more than half of those being achieved<br>now um and uh We've uh we we've come a<br>long way but it's early stages yet<br>um uh next one<br>here so this is River's largest uh<br>project at 50 hectares uh Riv has been<br>operating for 24 years uh and so it's<br>quite an achievement for us to to get a<br>large scale project like this um uh the<br>site has uh already had a Q2 Wetland<br>established and we have um Extended it<br>with the support of uh our Q2 rep here<br>we were able to do this by uh taking on<br>to some covid Provisions that were um<br>were changed by the organization<br>whereby they recognized areas that were<br>previously uh unable to be um funded uh<br>with the view that with funding they<br>would become valuable habitat um so that<br>was quite a change by QE2 and it really<br>opened the door for for this project um<br>the hydrology along with um uh the<br>planting were one of the main drivers<br>where we could see um value and and and<br>we were able to demonstrate that to to<br>Hy<br>to in case you're wondering where the<br>um there poy there so it's down the<br>bottom end of<br>UHA um uh you can see the uh the site<br>it's it's a a Remnant a lot of land<br>drainage around here this was a vast<br>Mosaic of wetland habitat with a<br>hydrological connection to the L white<br>ker River um uh it's now a fraction of<br>what was was once there um I'm just<br>going to play a movie here and while<br>a<br>so you see drainage going through<br>there t thing going along the edges<br>around<br>here there brain<br>going so as I've mentioned hydrology is<br>one of the key uh drivers for this<br>project to create habitat and so the<br>first we that we intend to build is<br>going to be here this was going to<br>happen the summer just been but<br>obviously with the Cyclones we had to<br>defer our our mahy there the second wear<br>is going to be down down this drain here<br>and effectively it's reversing the uh<br>land drainage efficiencies created by<br>this uh this drain here um if you go to<br>Retro lens really great uh website to<br>look up what's happened in the past but<br>year post second world war this strain<br>here pops up um and uh the impacts are<br>quite obvious that's the QE2 block that<br>was already<br>in Covenant prior to the project um and<br>it didn't have the same drainage uh<br>channels dug through it and obviously<br>the ecological Integrity is much better<br>there uh the project goes all the way up<br>around<br>here but quick there um oh you go comes<br>along the top and uh these three Forest<br>remnants here are all included in the<br>site<br>um and you can see the uh spray work<br>there the guys doing uh around the<br>plantings<br>there this area here we intend to do<br>some uh control on the gray<br>Willows and hopefully with transes to<br>hydrology we'll get um<br>vegetation change and we won't hopefully<br>have to do too much in terms of planting<br>the hydrology will keep out dry species<br>with weeds and we'll get uh some of our<br>native wi Rush communities establishing<br>ahead of<br>them just see all the spots spraying<br>around<br>there these trees here are all about to<br>established they all suffer from the<br>same sorts of effects of uh stock um<br>wind Edge effects Etc so one of the key<br>uh drivers for the project was stock<br>exclusion to establish the uh extend of<br>the project and we've done six<br>kilometers of fencing here um the uh the<br>fencing um we had to stick to land<br>parcel boundaries uh and where possible<br>though we uh want to make life easy easy<br>for our land owners and keep material<br>out of flood zones and so where possible<br>when we didn't weren't governed by land<br>Parcels we would uh keep them out of the<br>Wetland you can see by the extent the<br>photos actually don't do it justice but<br>we basically had uh um a digger hauling<br>a tractor all the way up the hill here<br>is so four four different l owners for<br>for the project not everybody on the<br>same page but we got<br>there the little red line that you see<br>going around the edge down here that's<br>project project planning so as already<br>commented uh We've now done 45,000 we<br>just uh we're held up with the wet uh<br>weather we've had this year um so we<br>actually the last of the treas in uh bit<br>over seven weeks ago<br>um it was really really long planning<br>project uh primarily because access was<br>compromised we had a sidebyside vehicle<br>stuck for uh five five weeks in a Pedic<br>so uh it was pretty wet um even in the<br>image here you can see the water of the<br>else um Michelle wanted me to talk about<br>the successes and the uh and the<br>learnings so um so obviously early<br>engagement with the four different<br>landowners was was very important um and<br>that may basically even if they weren't<br>on the same page they knew where we were<br>heading um uh we tried to use the<br>landowners uh skills and uh attributes<br>in the project so rather than just<br>saying this is how much is going to cost<br>we were asked you know asking them what<br>they could bring to the project as uh as<br>as co-funding or incline support is what<br>the WR calls it which is a a really way<br>really good way to capture buying and<br>get<br>long-term uh outcomes for the for the<br>site without the financial impact um we<br>used we're possible local contractors to<br>do the<br>Mahi um we've been very flexible on<br>delivery of the project uh around<br>weather um the price of roundwood if<br>anybody's been building a house post<br>will know it just went crazy so um<br>obviously had some cost issues there to<br>work around um this project was rejected<br>for funding a number of times for<br>different uh parties um but we didn't<br>give up on it we just stuck with it um<br>the project also is is a long-term<br>commitment by the forland owners so they<br>all realize that River care and our<br>partners are here setting up the first<br>five years of this but it's here in<br>perpetuity um uh as Jaden pointed out in<br>his uh his discussion uh the marai is<br>always at that location they're going<br>nowhere they're always going to have a<br>commitment uh to the site in the Tanger<br>and so uh you know it's too short term<br>to think of five years of funding it's a<br>much bigger much bigger thing<br>um and my only gripe because we can't<br>all have good good feedback um is that<br>um this project was was really hard to<br>do<br>because uh we had had to jump through<br>some quite big Hoops with our partners<br>at Regional Council um they fund us and<br>we're very very grateful for everything<br>that Regional Council does for us but we<br>were able to demonstrate through the<br>rrin imagery that the drains that we<br>were wanting to create the<br>inefficiencies on with these weird<br>were man-made and um you know their<br>being there in the in the Wetland was<br>compromising the long-term health so<br>should be straightforward to say hey we<br>want to do a restoration project no<br>one's impacted the long-term outcomes<br>are going to be positive we're just<br>reversing what's occurred 50 years<br>prior uh but it was extremely hard to do<br>and we're very very fortunate to have a<br>number of Partners who made the process<br>easier including in Regional Council um<br>uh but if we have land owners that think<br>they're going to be spending 20 grand on<br>some rock to you know to create a wear<br>and a drain and they're going to spend<br>70 on a consultant and the process of<br>getting a resource consent these these<br>projects just aren't going to happen um<br>it's just too cost prohibitive um and<br>when you're talking to a farmer and he's<br>got a small Quarry or a cousin or<br>someone who's got a farm down the road<br>who can get the material really cheap<br>and then you're saying actually it's<br>going to cost you 50 Grand to get some<br>paperwork to make it happen it's a<br>sell um I have to do some<br>acknowledgements here and some some of<br>the people actually noted here in the<br>room um but uh the W River Authority<br>have been awesome in terms of a funding<br>partner for this project um uh Robbie<br>from QE2<br>um he you know comes down to<br>relationships and to get successful<br>outcomes and you know when you when you<br>show that modified Paddock there that's<br>been grazed you know over the last 50<br>years um you know Robbie sees Bush<br>blocks that are pristine is part of his<br>work so you're trying to sell him a a<br>project for him to be invested to to get<br>qy2 on board and he saw the vision so<br>big UPS to Robbie there um billion trees<br>they they funded the project uh little<br>noan organization New Zealand G bird<br>habitat trust um you buy a duck shooting<br>license and you get a stamp um the $10<br>on the stamp goes into projects like<br>this um with seit or w a catchment<br>ecological enhancement trust they've<br>been awesome um Dave CLE he's not here<br>today but this guy's a legend when it<br>comes to doing projects like this um he<br>saved this project 50 Grand on on his<br>own because of his Knowledge and Skills<br>dealing with<br>Council uh new legislation around<br>working in<br>Wetlands um Natasha who's here it's been<br>awesome too um Hayden who was here know<br>where he is Aden Crystal from 19 Nall<br>there um uh they've been out on site and<br>checked it all out uh as manaa it's<br>really important to get that buying<br>again Partnerships and obviously the<br>project would not be possible without<br>land owners and um uh the three land<br>owners um involved been really really<br>good um can't really say enough good<br>things about<br>them and lastly but not least the<br>dollars and cents people so most of<br>those um logos should be familiar for<br>people<br>and in case anybody's feeling generous<br>thank you apologies for that mixed<br>up uh Kevin yeah bro it's it's it's<br>always you know uh a tricky uh thing to<br>navigate when you got cousins who uh can<br>get stuff on the cheap got heaps of<br>cousins that come up to me all the time<br>and say I can get stuff on the cheap it<br>just magically appears off the back of a<br>truck in a shed so you got to always be<br>careful about where they resourced that<br>stuff my friend<br>uh I got cies like that I tell you uh<br>also the other thing I thought I saw on<br>there was the um was austral Asian<br>bitten I don't know if it's got a mildy<br>name but um uh every year uh I was<br>reminded this year I didn't know they<br>did this but they have a bird of the<br>century award I don't know if you saw<br>this the PO ti ti won the uh bird of the<br>century award and actually picked up by<br>uh by a guy over in America who runs a a<br>talk show and uh he he found out that<br>this competition was going he M did a<br>massive campaign to save the PO tiet<br>ticket uh he put the uh Billboards up in<br>Spain he put some up in Japan and I<br>think he got 200 and something thousand<br>votes uh for this but it brought a lot<br>of attention to the P I would have no<br>idea that there was a bird called the P<br>until I saw it on on television H never<br>seen one in my life uh but yep uh I got<br>go so many places there I'm got to go um<br>I'm going to leave that one there<br>uh all right our next uh our next<br>speaker um is a freshwater ecologist who<br>has uh worked for the Department of<br>Conservation and wo Regional Council on<br>the lake fer restoration uh project uh<br>the project was a collaborative<br>initiative between doc WRC uh and W<br>through the Muka development and wahi<br>finer trusts and lo land owners of the<br>catchment and aimed to restore the<br>health of Lake Fang by restoring the<br>lake margins and Associated Wetlands uh<br>in the catchment just an interesting<br>historical note on this as well that<br>Lake F actually was the last<br>Natasha<br>just a bit shorter where is it which is<br>it that<br>you thank you just a bit shorter than<br>umoto<br>tenot kha Gro um and I'm just like to um<br>say thank you for having me and I'm<br>presenting this talk today on behalf of<br>the partners woi Department of<br>Conservation and the Regional Council<br>I'm presenting because I've got a a<br>unique perspective um I was involved um<br>initially when we were trying to get<br>funding from the external funders and<br>then I provided technical advice in the<br>project uh as a freshware ecologist um<br>and then when I moved over to the<br>Regional Council and uh 20 uh 2020 um I<br>oversaw the WRC work Stream So I've seen<br>it from two of the three Partners uh in<br>in this<br>work and also I get a bit nervous and so<br>I'm going to rely on my notes so bear<br>with<br>me so Lake funer um is the second<br>largest uh River in the laau area It's<br>associated with about 900 hectares of<br>marginal Wetlands including the a swamp<br>the lake is situated with a large<br>pedometry pastoral catchment and<br>receives infl infl via several streams<br>including the Tio and a streams it drain<br>drains via the Fung stream directly into<br>the W<br>River it's one of the 12 riverine lakes<br>next one um 12<br>riverine 12 riverine Lakes associated<br>with the w River these are all naturally<br>shallow mostly less than 5 MERS they<br>have um interconnected Wetlands they're<br>highly productive and diverse and their<br>ecology is depend dependent on the<br>hydrology and Fred frequency and closely<br>linked to the river they're highly<br>valued culturally and<br>recreationally um Lake fipe itself is<br>2.7 M deep uh it's 1,450 hectares and it<br>sits within a 32,000 catchment<br>area uh the degraded condition of late<br>funer is a result of hydrological<br>modification non-point Source<br>agricultural discharges from the Lakes<br>wider catchment um riparian management<br>and Invasion by plant and animal pests<br>these issues occur at a scale and<br>contribute to a great to create a<br>scenario um one of the outcomes of the<br>project was to ensure that there was no<br>further degradation in the water quality<br>of lake funge and the target was that<br>was set for this was that cyob bacterial<br>bio volumes would only exceed<br>recreational swimming guidelines for<br>time uh as I said earlier this project<br>was a partnership with between woi<br>through the wahanui trust and the namok<br>development trust as well as the<br>department of conservation and wut<br>Regional Council it was a $2.9 million<br>project uh funded over five years and I<br>just want to emphasize that when the<br>project was funded back in<br>2017 this was a really big amount for a<br>project uh the project management<br>structure included a terms of reference<br>signed by all the partners um doc held<br>the funders the funding Deeds um with<br>the funders but had separate funding of<br>Deeds between do and wut tyui and do and<br>wut Regional Council uh doc were<br>responsible for the project managing of<br>the project and they and the project was<br>governed by a Steering group with<br>support from an operational project<br>there were multiple aims to the project<br>uh to contribute to uh achieving to to<br>Mana um as well as the W environmental<br>plan Jaden so boom it was in there um to<br>enhance collaboration between the<br>partners to protect and restore the lake<br>and its Wetlands to improve access for<br>recreation but also for cultural Harvest<br>and um to reduce the risk of alligator<br>weed uh Lake fer pay grows alligator<br>weed like nothing else and sends it down<br>the river so this was about trying to<br>get on top of the alligator weed to to<br>protect the low W um the project also<br>had an aim to enhance the capacity of<br>local Hau and<br>lake the project had several work<br>streams and this slide just gives an<br>overview of each partner's deliverables<br>um unfortunately today I don't have<br>enough time to do justice to the large<br>amount of mahi that was done so I'll<br>just briefly talk about each of the work<br>stream with a slight emphasis on the<br>catchment work because I think that<br>applies to most of you in the off in the<br>room<br>today I'd like to acknowledge Linda Tuli<br>who's here today who oversaw the kitaki<br>monitoring framework uh with the support<br>of er atiny uh the framework was<br>developed following a series of Wanga<br>interviews uh fiti Coro and follow-up<br>conversations and discussion um so thank<br>you<br>Linda um<br>fencing D was responsible for<br>um overseeing the fencing project and we<br>use dashboards to monitor the progress<br>uh and I'm very pleased to say that the<br>lake is almost fully fenced uh just a<br>couple of fences that didn't get<br>finished last year because of the bad<br>weather and the Cyclones um but it's a<br>pretty big achievement to um get the<br>whole lake fenced um doc expects to<br>summer the weed control which included<br>uh environmental weeds such as Willow<br>yellow flag Iris but it also include<br>included a um a program for alligator<br>weed as I said before uh this was<br>governed by a project plan for both the<br>weed control and planting and just from<br>the image there you can see that the way<br>that we did that was to break up the the<br>lake margins into manageable zones to<br>work on and for each Zone there was a um<br>a plan for which weeds to control and<br>which plants to plant and that kind of<br>stuff and then the last but on that<br>slide was just um the objective for<br>alligator weed was really about um we're<br>never going to eradicate it from Lake<br>river all up about 53,000 plants were<br>planted around the lake margin some ups<br>and downs Last Summer caused a bit of<br>problems with high water levels and<br>waterers being at um some of the highest<br>levels seen in many many years but um<br>those just those areas on the map just<br>planted um The increased funding allowed<br>us to really Hammer the alligator weight<br>to reduce it to levels that could be<br>maintained with existing levels of<br>funding um we focused on high density<br>areas which are the areas in red on the<br>map here um and aiming to reduce the<br>source of the infestation and we those<br>areas just you can see the pictures on<br>infestations um monitoring was a bit<br>challenging um all our um spraying areas<br>have been gpsed and photos have been<br>helpful um but they didn't always work<br>as planned in terms of um clear<br>monitoring um so that's just been a bit<br>of a learning about how better to to<br>manage to be able to tell the story<br>about the work that you've<br>done um W Regional Council also used um<br>restricted Place notices under the<br>biocurity act and worked with the eight<br>biggest land owners to develop an<br>alligator weed management plan for each<br>property and you can see the eight um<br>crosses around the lake margin those are<br>the um properties with we worked<br>with I can't yet tell you if we've been<br>successful with the alligator weed and<br>we pretty much had to write last year's<br>control off um as you know we had lots<br>of weather events including a cyclone um<br>and the lake was just so high for most<br>of um last summer um and we're very<br>grateful to the funders who have allowed<br>us to carry this funding over and I'm<br>pleased to say spraying has already<br>started this year so we're hoping to get<br>year the catchman intervention<br>workstream was quite a varied one um it<br>was underpinned by some pretty cool<br>scientific analysis such as um spatial<br>analysis to identify Wetlands but it's<br>also included some tried and true um<br>projects including Farm days to Showcase<br>management techniques uh good old<br>newsletters um and surveys of farmers<br>and just to give you a context of the<br>catchment there's about 251 land owners<br>who have properties of over four<br>catchment the first major piece of work<br>that we did in this work stream was to<br>identify um what aspect of water quality<br>to Target to reduce those cob bacterial<br>levels um it was proposed to focus on<br>nitrogen with the target being set so<br>that the lake should be swimmable 60 to<br>80% of the time um the next piece was<br>then to identify the sector that was<br>contributing the most nitrogen to the<br>lake um which as you can see here was<br>sheep and beef<br>farming um and then we ident went<br>through a process of identifying sheep<br>and beef farming practices to Target to<br>reduce nitrogen leeching now obviously<br>we're a fiveyear project um and we kind<br>of do everything and so it was agreed<br>that the project would focus on three<br>main areas which was aforestation of<br>steep south facing slopes managing or<br>retirement of wetlands to manage<br>diffused pollution and soil management<br>control as an example of some of the<br>work we did um we identified<br>approximately 1,650 Wetlands um using<br>spatial analysis and then ground truthed<br>and as you can see from the map and the<br>the graph most of them were pretty small<br>so most of these wetland were less than<br>one hectare and most of them were<br>unfenced and the unfenced ones are the<br>blue ones up on that map um just to to<br>explain the fence ones of the Lilac ones<br>and mostly those large uh Wetlands<br>around the lake and the partially fence<br>colored we worked on 11 properties um<br>and the catchman interventions included<br>retiring wetlands um retiring steep<br>slopes fencing and planting these areas<br>and stabilizing land with popler and<br>Willow poles and to undertake some<br>Willow<br>control um I'll be using property 9ine<br>uh as a case study for the next couple<br>of slides uh as you can see it's in the<br>upper catchment quite steep country and<br>then the map on the right shows that the<br>property itself uh it's a beef mostly<br>beef stocked uh 443 hectar<br>property um<br>for those of you going on the field trip<br>on Thursday we'll also be visiting<br>property 11 which is up um just right<br>next to the<br>lake um the map of the property is split<br>you can see the different colored<br>outlines those are the catchman<br>intervention compartments that were<br>completed over the different over the<br>four years of the<br>project I've just got some before and<br>after photos um the first and third<br>photo um are the same sorry um the 1st<br>and third August 2019 and the 2nd and<br>fourth are October 2022 and you can<br>already see um the plants growing um a<br>bit of recovery there and far less be a<br>soil<br>exposed I really like this photo because<br>it shows the extent of this um the white<br>lines um are the outline of the area<br>that was fenced and retired um this was<br>the biggest project out of the 11 that<br>we did in the funga pay project um to be<br>eligible for funding land owners had to<br>um match the funger pay funding dollar<br>for dollar um and we had $40,000<br>available for each project or each<br>property um and what you can see in the<br>table is that some land owners use this<br>funding to leverage or unlock other<br>funding sources such as 1 billion trees<br>or receit funding so this was a pretty<br>big project just over 6 kilometers of<br>fencing 33,000 native plants 260<br>willower Pooles and 19.4 hectares<br>retired<br>um and you can see within the white<br>lines that you've got we've got um three<br>Wetland three big Wetland areas or four<br>if you count the fan pond at the bottom<br>um with Kaka stands um yeah and the fan<br>bottom was I not on that slide hopefully<br>you can see<br>that oh I didn't have the table thanks<br>Nigel just to summarize the 11 catchment<br>um projects that we did<br>um all up we did about 23 kilometers of<br>fencing um either new or fixed 106,000<br>retired I just want to briefly um<br>highlight two other pieces of work now<br>while they weren't strictly part of the<br>project I think they have had an impact<br>on the project um in April 2022 wut<br>Regional Council fixed the we um and<br>that's the the photo on the left with<br>the um rock Rubble wear being fixed and<br>so this was to increase the lake level<br>to uh 4.9 M um RL to match the as a<br>requirement in the regional plan and so<br>that deepened the lake um the we had<br>been damaged for several years and so it<br>was really good to actually get this um<br>wear um<br>fixed at the Project's Inception as I<br>said earlier this level of funding for<br>Lake restoration or even catchment work<br>was unusual but we had this um um we had<br>this new project called 1 billion trees<br>then we had this thing called Co which<br>bought a whole lot of money in um via<br>projects such as na or W and it's meant<br>that 57 Properties or 23% of the<br>properties in this catchment have had<br>some kind of catchment management with<br>through the through the funger pay<br>project or through other catchment<br>interventions and the um image on the<br>right is just showing all the properties<br>where work has been<br>undertaken so this level of work was Far<br>larger than we would ever have been able<br>to achieve without these funding<br>streams so just to<br>summarize having a plan is really<br>important I think this project was a bit<br>slow to get going and I think it needed<br>a bit more planning but the opportunity<br>for funding came up and we took it<br>working with multiple partners takes<br>time and effort and it requires<br>listening respect and patience and lots<br>and lots of<br>communication as many of you know<br>effectively sh sharing a joint bank<br>account is hard and in the end we ended<br>up simplifying our funding deed to allow<br>more fixed flexibility between<br>workstreams having a good project<br>management framework is essential and so<br>while I think we've achieved most of the<br>deliverables I'm not quite sure about<br>the outcomes yet<br>maybe I don't think the massive drop and<br>the fun and the C cyanobacterial bi bio<br>volumes Shan in the graph here is<br>attributed to the project solely I think<br>the fixing of the wear helped the depth<br>because of the the raising the depth of<br>the lake but also last summer we had a<br>really unusual and very wet um season<br>and so we had large amounts of flushing<br>from the river because of all the water<br>and this is what would have happened<br>prior to all the hydrological<br>interventions such as the flood scheme<br>such as drainage schemes so I think<br>reinstating that hydrological con<br>connection between the river and the<br>lake is absolutely<br>fundamental<br>I just like to acknowledge and thank the<br>dozens and dozens of people who have<br>contributed to this project we couldn't<br>have done it without them and while we<br>haven't finished I think we've made a<br>good start thank<br>you we we we'll keep going until 3:30 I<br>said to myself at lunchtime I says um no<br>don't tell any more jokes about P this<br>is not about us and and then um you know<br>CU just like when you work in the<br>environmental the ti space it's a war of<br>attrition you don't get successes every<br>day so I was going to let him have<br>today's battle but he keeps talking<br>about P Tey Ticky and saying poo Ticky<br>Ticky as if he enjoys it and so you know<br>he creat creating a bigger Target on him<br>but um no no I won't I won't I'll stick<br>to my guns we'll carry on tomorrow and<br>plus he's got the microphone at the end<br>um if you want a picture or an example<br>of perseverance and persistence uh look<br>at Kevin and look at Natasha they will I<br>would accidentally say yes to things uh<br>to them both and they'll be the first<br>ones leaving messages sending me a text<br>have we got my message and just<br>following up so you know and and the<br>projects that they've LED have started<br>from a long long time ago um and it's<br>those things and that drive to do better<br>for our a uh that creates Great lead<br>leadership and examples for Alano the<br>stuff that um K involved in wasn't<br>actually called wle to River K it was a<br>long name lower W catchment enhancement<br>Society something yeah and uh one of the<br>founders is hwa that was up the back<br>there why he final trust back in 99 and<br>so um you see these little things come a<br>long way I do want to touch on Jaden<br>he's that Golden Child for us in the<br>sense that um and I mean this in a great<br>way Jaden uh you know local boy grew up<br>around here inwa and<br>hu um and then he went to boy High then<br>he did an internship the the doc Cadet<br>ships and then after that he came to do<br>some work at the W River trust when we<br>started doing some he popped down to<br>Nelson bit of K and power down there and<br>then he came back and he found himself<br>doing stuff for us at the river<br>Authority and at the Regional Council<br>and now he's environmental manager for<br>the tribe and that's a great success<br>story I think and and he's only he is<br>only 30 you know so he's still got a lot<br>more to offer to us I'm going to get<br>into some questions and then I'll just<br>wind up with um I wouldn't say a summary<br>about today but a reflection probably on<br>the last 20 years and then I'll hand it<br>back to P to close up today's sessions<br>Michelle all right uh first question is<br>for Jaden Jaden what are the maintenance<br>plans for at uh rura at the rura project<br>after planting will our people be able<br>to continue working maintaining the f<br>after<br>planting short answer yes we we got a<br>5year maintenance plan which will be<br>engaging some of our tribal contractors<br>um and that that whole longterm vision<br>and as we look for more opportunities to<br>do what we we actually got to wrap up<br>our Barbecue on Friday actually which is<br>awesome too but we're also looking at<br>more opportunities utilizing little cod<br>as a template um that was the first time<br>we've done something like that um<br>bringing all our trouble businesses<br>together I should have said that we did<br>learn a lot as well not everything is<br>all huny Dory as we all know um but we<br>got to a space where we could have these<br>conversations and look at the<br>maintenance plan and utilize our tribal<br>contracts for future works as well so<br>yes we do have a maintenance plan good I<br>think the next uh questions for Natasia<br>um what do you mean by spray is this<br>referring to chemical spray and how does<br>andari yeah great question<br>z um yes we do spray um it's the only<br>way that we can get on top of alligator<br>weed it's a very fast growing plant um<br>we um there we use a special chemical<br>that is um approved for use over water<br>and it's used sparingly um but yeah<br>ultimately that's how we have to manage<br>it<br>um this may be a question for the panel<br>potentially for one of the previous<br>speakers um what's the strongest and<br>most effective alternative to planting<br>poppas ribon<br>wood can you can you expand on that um<br>when it comes to um uh erosion control<br>uh it's recognized that um the maxad<br>Willow Willow clone is the is the is the<br>Preferred Choice it's just so robust but<br>it's not a native um the best native is<br>ribbonwood but unfortunately it does not<br>withstand<br>inundation and so to most of the erosion<br>underwater<br>another question that anybody could<br>potentially put their hand up to answer<br>um are there any projects investigating<br>the use of wool as a material for<br>sediment control<br>tools uh I.E to reduce sediment deposits<br>hour I'm just looking up at Grant black<br>head take that as a<br>no no one in the room knows of<br>any um question for kri w Regional<br>Council um does the value of the land<br>areas being retired as part of the<br>contribution um thank you for the<br>question question um so it used to back<br>in the early days of the implementation<br>of our projects at least um we counted<br>the retirement of land and we had an a<br>um Economist do some estimates of what<br>the value of lost um income would be so<br>we used to value at at around $25,000 a<br>hectare but I think as a number of uh<br>speakers have mentioned you get tend to<br>get more buying from land owners if<br>they've got a bit of money in the game<br>as well ownership of the project and so<br>it's been quite a few years years now<br>perhaps five or six with the wiper<br>catchment plan project and the others<br>that Tash has talked about where we have<br>counted that as the in kind as it as<br>their contribution it has to be cash or<br>building a fence or um or maintaining<br>30% I'm getting a feeling everyone's a<br>bit tired um is there just one question<br>floor<br>C<br>J what was the<br>faed what was the fabric that you used<br>um we saw you digging your team digging<br>in was W day yeah W was the fabric but I<br>can get the information for you too W<br>Bond all right okay we're going to<br>finish up<br>um before I ask uh to present our Tong<br>um I was want to reflect on something in<br>in 2006 to Monaco as our environmental<br>manager for the tribe held the first<br>national Kaki Forum here at hopu hopu uh<br>worked with Ministry for environment and<br>the tribe um at that time I said to<br>someone outside was actually quite uh<br>tragic because um as W do we extend our<br>manaki Tonga into 2 3:00 a.m. in the<br>morning and a lot of our Faro came in at<br>at um morning tea yes so we learned from<br>that at that time most of the Faro that<br>were coming to check you know there<br>wasn't as many post settlement entities<br>um it was Faro just coming to talk about<br>the small things they are trying to do<br>and that they that they could do with<br>nothing about and then in 2016 w we<br>hosted another R River Symposium here<br>post settlement post 2010 post 2012 uh<br>with the man portal settlement as well<br>and so we were starting to see some<br>projects forming that's when we saw the<br>pun River care starting to evolve and<br>since then he become kiwi you know of<br>the Year New Zealander of the year we<br>were seeing these projects that were<br>just starting and today my reflection is<br>that we're actually seeing some large<br>scale projects that have impact and and<br>it's not it's not easy you can see from<br>amount of people involved and I think<br>from that 2006 what's that 17 years<br>that's some some pretty huge
