we're going to start<br>off with uh what we learned yesterday<br>and of sign language we're going to get<br>everybody to once again put your hands<br>up like this all right look to your left<br>have a smell of the underarm of your<br>mate see if they had a shower and had a<br>bath this<br>morning and come back with the same<br>sweat as yesterday C all right for those<br>of you who are new and or came in today<br>that is a sign language for Unity okay<br>unity and I got that from uh from<br>watching Planet of the Apes a couple of<br>nights ago uh to be fair I don't<br>actually know if that is sign language<br>for Unity uh but Hollywood and the<br>movies that they H put out have a lot of<br>learnings a lot of learnings in them and<br>I was thinking about the state of our<br>River and and while I was driving up<br>here I actually thought about a movie<br>that I watched as a kid uh came a hot<br>Friday I don't know if you remember that<br>movie uh ability James stared in that<br>movie came on hot Friday uh where he was<br>the tin Year kid and um you know I was<br>one of those kids that actually I still<br>do it as an adult whenever I go to watch<br>movies uh especially super hero movies<br>or Katey movies that come out of their<br>theater thinking like I'm Bruce Lee<br>thinking that I'm Spider-Man I'm doing<br>all the moves uh but in came a hot<br>Friday there was some environmental<br>learning uh that uh ability James gave<br>to us and one of them is don't MIM in<br>the river okay don't MIM me in the river<br>cuz the tany will come and bite off<br>while you get the idea right so don't<br>MIM me in the river F it's not uh it's<br>not good for the health and well-being<br>of our hour and of course that's why<br>you're here right you're here because<br>you have a passion for our for our<br>environment and to make sure that it's<br>uh it's kept to a healthy standard for<br>so here we got a we got a long day ahead<br>of us and we got a lot of speakers that<br>stage well we'll get straight into it we<br>get straight into it with our first uh<br>speaker all<br>is a counselor on the W Regional Council<br>and a local farmer he actively supports<br>initiatives that contribute towards<br>catchment Health water quality and<br>biodiversity enhancement uh he has<br>experience across local government and<br>is committed to the local environment<br>and working with River eie he's been uh<br>heavily involved in the healthy River<br>white order project change since its<br>Inception including co-chairing uh the<br>committee that governed the project with<br>r e from a practical perspective uh Stu<br>has had an active involvement in<br>Regional Council catchment and<br>management restoration work as well as<br>extensive riparian restoration work on<br>his own Farm uh wo the river Authority<br>co-chair Crown<br>appointee<br>St<br>for<br>for<br>for<br>look I I stand before you here today as<br>as Crown crown co-chair of the W River<br>Authority um my journey in this role is<br>rooted in my commitment to the<br>environment my experience in local<br>government and and my dedication to<br>working alongside River<br>e uh and Crown agencies uh to protect<br>these waterways um my interest in in<br>tile and in the community is probably<br>why I have tolerated the challenges of<br>of local body politics for as long as I<br>have but um I can say that it's it's<br>been a real privilege to to hold this<br>role with with the river Authority and<br>work alongside my fellow co-chair mahut<br>my fellow fellow board<br>members um and and the team that are<br>here today that that make the waor river<br>Authority what it is is is we Traverse<br>this journey uh is Kaki of of to Mana so<br>today I want to talk about the policy<br>that impacts the W to wer Rivers<br>especially to mana and reflect on on how<br>these policies shape the way we manag<br>the hour and and look ahead to an<br>effective and fitful purpose regulatory<br>um<br>regime um that enhances our Mahi to<br>clean up the hour um our journey to<br>toward safeguarding the W won wiper has<br>been a pioneering one into 25 man stance<br>as a testament to the determination uh<br>in the dedication of those who have<br>hour so to T5 man's primary Direction<br>setting document um it's the the<br>statutory framework for the vision and<br>stratey strategy and it's very unique<br>it's it's arguably the strongest<br>planning document in the country it it<br>prevails over any Inc consistency<br>provision and a national policy<br>statement and and a National<br>Environmental standard in many<br>circumstances within that framework is<br>our vision for a future where a healthy<br>Rock River sustains Abundant Life and<br>prosperous communities who in turn are<br>all responsible for restoring and<br>protecting the health of the walor river<br>and all that it<br>Embraces uh for generations to come it<br>has 13 objectives and I won't list them<br>more but some of the key ones um the<br>restoration and protection of of the<br>health and wellbe of of the Wako River<br>um the protection and enhancement of<br>significant sites Fisheries flora and<br>FAA uh the restoration of water quality<br>within the Waka River so that it is safe<br>for people to swim in and take food from<br>over its entire<br>length and and one of the ones that's I<br>guess quite particular to my talk now is<br>no further degradation as a result of<br>human activities and and that's a really<br>high bar now when we speak of policy<br>that impacts the wton wiper Rivers we<br>must acknowledge that those waterways<br>are not isolated from the broader<br>environmental and Social Challenges we<br>find ourselves in an era where the<br>implications of policy decisions Ripple<br>far and wide affecting not only the<br>health of our Rivers but also the<br>relationships of our communities within<br>it and the sustainability of our<br>environment now I'm a fourth generation<br>wo Dairy Farmer I'm also acutely aware<br>of the implications of how a rapidly<br>changing regulatory environment affect<br>the viability of Agro business in<br>alterar and the financial contribution<br>that it makes to our nation's well-being<br>you this policy and Regulatory stuff is<br>hard and it's politically challenging<br>and I I see Jenny in the um audience<br>there a number of people that are um at<br>a lot of history of the Regional Council<br>here and they and they know<br>that um the 13 years I've spent as an<br>elected counselor have have well and<br>truly ramm that home and of course<br>that's why as a country we've kicked the<br>can down the road and and put this um<br>this stuff off for too long<br>now Tang said to me this this you need<br>to get a few pictures and I think he's<br>probably right because his policy<br>stuff's pretty boring and I got home<br>last night and it was raining so I had<br>to shoot out this morning and so so the<br>photo on the um on the left is um a<br>photo I took not lot longer long after I<br>bought the the farm and whiteall so I<br>farm and whiteall with my wife H Maria<br>we got 270 Acres um small place I list<br>2third of it to the Dairy Farmer next<br>door he's miling 700 odd cows and that's<br>how I find the time to do it this stuff<br>um and this is my happy place where I go<br>to unwi wind after um challenging<br>Council meetings um and of course I at<br>the time I never really occurred to me<br>what it would look like um once these<br>trees got a bit bigger so those photos<br>are effectively taken in the same place<br>and of course we can't see the waterfall<br>anymore um but what's really cool is<br>when you get into that waterfall I took<br>um a Wayne Bennett from just up the road<br>here and there and and um he identified<br>25 different ferns in there uh there's<br>gloworms in there now so it's it's a<br>really cool place so just a good example<br>of um it doesn't seem like much at the<br>time but just a little bit every year<br>makes a huge<br>difference um so look our efforts to as<br>a country to establish ourselves as a<br>credible part of the world economy have<br>not always been successful in terms of<br>our environment um yesterday Kier nilson<br>mentioned the subsidies introduced by<br>the mold de government in the 70s that<br>saw large tracks of Wako Hill Country<br>cleared of native vegetation now now<br>when the Financial locations of those<br>subsidies reach the point that are no<br>longer sustainable the the labor<br>government of the 80s ax them overnight<br>um farmers will sent a clear message<br>that they needed to stand on their own<br>two feet crank up their production and<br>demonstrate their worth um to the to the<br>economy to the country and look the<br>sector responded positively and they did<br>exactly that and and I know because I<br>was one of them unfortunately at that<br>time however there was not widespread<br>recognition of the implications for the<br>environment from that<br>intensification and as was mentioned<br>yesterday We've Only Just Begun to put<br>The Brak the handbrakes on and start on<br>that road to to recovery um for the hour<br>and you know we've got cost structures<br>and land prices that have involved in an<br>environment that's<br>facilitated that whole concept of of<br>privatizing the benefits and and and<br>socializing the costs of of that<br>environmental degradation and so you<br>know that's a journey that's going to<br>demand a lot of long-term commitment<br>from us and but you know we have to<br>accept that production systems that are<br>that depend on natural resources are<br>limited they're not finite and if we<br>want to achieve our aspirations for the<br>hour<br>um maintaining the status qu going<br>forward is is not an<br>option one of the key challenges we face<br>is a national decision-making framework<br>and it often impedes influence of of to<br>Mana um the large scale yuse changes<br>that took place during the period 2001<br>to about 2018 so up to 40,000 hectares<br>of of uh Forest land converted uh into<br>dairy farms in in the region most of<br>that was in the upper W or pmus country<br>that significantly increased the<br>contaminant loading of particularly<br>nitrogen from into the hour and that was<br>despite the evidence been really clear<br>that if we were to achieve our<br>aspirations for the hour contaminant<br>reduced however despite the best efforts<br>of the Regional Council at the time its<br>ability to pre prevent those um those<br>conversions um was was completely<br>affected by the the cus Samar processes<br>that we were obliged as a council and as<br>a regulator agency agency to abide<br>by but in complete contrast to that and<br>and at about the same time and<br>immediately Upstream there was a<br>partnership made up of Regional Council<br>too District Council a Ministry for the<br>environment and and t tour they were<br>gearing up to spend 80 $81 million of of<br>taxpayers and rate payers money to<br>reduce the manageable nitrogen um<br>entering into the lake um by 20% or or<br>um it's 170 tons I think now that<br>project's a really cool story in itself<br>and I'm I'm not going to go there now<br>but um my point is that was a<br>significant reduction and large<br>sacrifices uh were made by the farmers<br>in that catchment and those sacrifices<br>continue today it's been a really<br>successful project and it will continue<br>to be so providing we as a as a Regional<br>Community remain committed to<br>maintaining that investment for a mo<br>point of going forward it will have been<br>worthwhile but but you know there you<br>had two completely contradictory things<br>going on one working against the hour<br>one working um working for the hour um<br>at the very same time um and you know<br>those legislative processes that we bind<br>ourselves to they're they're well<br>intentioned in their own right but they<br>often create roadblocks for our journey<br>to realizing our aspirations um for a<br>cleaner and healthier wal<br>River and look I've got no doubt that<br>that all Farmers want to do things by<br>the environment on one of them but the<br>the way our economic systems work we we<br>do need an effective and fit forp<br>purpose regulatory environment and<br>that's a key part of our ability to<br>Mana um it's another one of those<br>examples where I never never envisaged<br>um how big the trees would get this this<br>was a flood in 97 that on the left there<br>that um resulted in a um a huge Plum of<br>sediment um so I farm in the headwaters<br>of the catapal stream the mangura stream<br>which flows into the CLE and um and it<br>it enters um the walk to River at<br>Cambridge and and and this this created<br>a huge Plum of settlement into Cambridge<br>that that that um ended up on the front<br>page of the paper and and was one of the<br>Watershed so so one of the the<br>significant Pol policy initiatives<br>that's about giving affected to 2 F<br>miners is a healthy Rivers Water order<br>project or or pc1 as we call it um a lot<br>of you in this room have been intimately<br>involved with that project and have<br>committed many hours to the to the coopa<br>um<br>and and and it this was a a partnership<br>with with W River e um it was it aimed<br>to develop a plan change for the wton r<br>river catchments that um with the focus<br>on managing diffuse uh cont contaminant<br>losses from agriculture it's been a<br>really challenging Journey but it it it<br>was I guess premeditated on on extensive<br>consultation engagement with<br>stakeholders from all walks of life um<br>and you know it really highlighted the<br>power of collective action it's required<br>us to reconcile a lot of diverse<br>interests and perspective Farmers<br>industry environmentalists<br>Kaki and it really tested the commitment<br>of all of those involved to finding<br>common ground um and solutions that are<br>that are not only effect effective but<br>but Equitable yet despite and I think<br>it's fair to say the best interest of<br>everyone that was involved in that<br>process we still ended up in the<br>environment Court we're still struggling<br>to agree on what the final version of a<br>a bunch of roles for Farmers uh will<br>look like now now it's currently<br>traversing through its final stages of<br>the process and the environment Court as<br>we SP speak and and I hope it's going to<br>be operative by by middle of next<br>year um but but you know we do have to<br>acknowledge that way too much time and<br>resources gone into arguing about policy<br>and plan roles at the expense of of<br>actions on the<br>ground and you know back in you know<br>even what seven years ago a lot of<br>farmers were really on board with the<br>stuff and to F man has been he's been a<br>real asset for the Regional Council in<br>this process um and a lot of farmers<br>will really get up for that change but<br>it's dragged on for so long that they've<br>a lost a bit of Interest and then<br>they've now become frustrated because<br>they want to do something but but but<br>but um but we we can't give them some<br>certainty um and you know we we have to<br>we're supposedly reviewing these plans<br>every 10 years it's taken us longer than<br>10 years to get the first iteration off<br>the<br>ground um and of course the other<br>challenge we have is is where National<br>policies um and Regional policies or<br>aspirations um conflict now to 35 minor<br>represents the um collectiv vision and<br>values of the region but but they they<br>Clash often with um with policies that<br>are that are achieved at a national<br>level and it conflicts it it it hampers<br>their ability to fully realize the<br>potential of the legislation and the<br>dreams we hold for for the hour so where<br>do we go from here um how do we ensure<br>that to5 man can really fulfill its<br>purpose um our individual restoration<br>efforts will only produce results if we<br>can work together as a<br>collective um the is a very small<br>organization but it's it's done a lot of<br>great stuff because it's been able to<br>Brent together groups of people with<br>similar interest in in the collective<br>efforts has demonstrated that it that it<br>can make a<br>difference um the $6 million of funding<br>that the WR allocates every year in fact<br>it's eight now with with our um<br>contribution from our our friends and<br>and Oakland um it's it's a lot of money<br>but it's not enough to deliver to T fer<br>and I think jolian mentioned that<br>yesterday I think was Shane too made a<br>comment about the the the I think was 5%<br>of of what the<br>um of what the um the predecessor to the<br>river Authority came up with through<br>through their<br>investigations um and um and and so um<br>you know if I put my farmer's head on in<br>addition to all the good stuff we heard<br>about yesterday we've got to be<br>initiating our own projects to<br>complement the Mahi that that we're<br>already<br>doing um and um so you know we've got to<br>we've got to collaborate um communicate<br>we got to work together and we've got to<br>advocate for change in the National<br>decision making framework and and you<br>know we've got to have input from those<br>the people that the policies um affect<br>and we got to take them with us but but<br>it you know becomes a point where if<br>that that engagement and and<br>collaboration takes too long it starts<br>becoming counterproductive as as we saw<br>in in the upper wal um you know those<br>those people doing those conversions and<br>there were some pretty big big hitters<br>in there um they knew full well that um<br>that they could have all the trees<br>chopped down while we were bog down in<br>in in the court process to try and stop<br>them from doing it<br>um and what and I think was I think was<br>Jaden mentioned yesterday um that those<br>the risks of leaving those e<br>environmental plans um sitting on the<br>shelves Gathering dust you know you've<br>put a lot of time and effort into those<br>and and they have a key role in<br>influencing policy going forward but but<br>again um and look e really particularly<br>face this challenge in terms of of<br>resource and time availability to engage<br>with regional coun but but it's but<br>Regional councils face it too and that's<br>why I think the current budget for pc1<br>is sitting at nearly $30<br>million<br>um and and and as I said before pc1 us<br>the very first step on on the journey<br>towards achieving to 35 Miner we've<br>still got another well supposedly 70<br>years to go but but the way this process<br>has been dragging on it's probably going<br>to be<br>80 um so yeah I mean I guess we're all<br>going to be be watching very carefully<br>over the coming months with with our new<br>coalition government um what to man or<br>to why will look like going forward<br>remains a bit unclear at the moment but<br>but I think what is really clear to all<br>of us here today is that we've got to T<br>F Mina and we're all committed to<br>putting the Mana of the wak and W Rivers<br>at the Forefront of our decision making<br>so<br>k um the establishment of the river<br>Authority um it it represents a key<br>moment in this history of the rest<br>of of our waterways um born from the the<br>wonu claims um treaty settlement and it<br>signals a commitment to collaborate uh<br>partner and share governance between<br>River ewi and the crown it it emphasizes<br>the importance of Monga maldi um and<br>those values and Environmental<br>Management and look it also it<br>demonstrates that W River ewi are<br>willing to not only write the injustices<br>of the past but also work together with<br>the community to clean up and protect<br>the for future generations and that's<br>something that that we must never forget<br>when we're on this journey our work's<br>far from complete um we must continue to<br>implement restoration projects and<br>engage with local communities and and<br>adapt to the to the um ever evolving<br>challenges posed by by climate change um<br>and population growth and we've got to<br>continue to promote sustainable land use<br>practice that align with our align with<br>our Shar Vision um for the river's<br>future um we've got to remain steadfast<br>to our dedication um to the Copa and the<br>people who um who depend on the hour um<br>the the health and wellbe of of the of<br>the rivers it's a reflection of our<br>Collective commitment uh to<br>environmental stewardship uh in<br>kakang so to conclude the policy that<br>impacts the the won wiper Rivers it's<br>it's a multi multifaceted challenge that<br>requires diligence um collaboration and<br>and a deep respect for for the Mana um<br>of the ti Mana uh the history of those<br>Rivers reminds us of their enduring<br>importance um while the present offers<br>us the opportunity to to write a new<br>chapter one of restoration<br>sustainability um and healing our River<br>um and its relationship um with our<br>communities um Tanga was right uh<br>putting some extra pictures up there uh<br>and seeing the change in the environment<br>was awesome but what Tanga was really<br>getting at was where's your water Cris<br>spots buto that's what those those are<br>the pictures he wanted to see was<br>where's the water Cris hidden on your<br>land it's funny too cuz I got a lot a<br>lot of fer out there who who who are<br>absolutely giving people you know<br>they'll give you the shirt off their<br>back but where they draw the line is<br>where's their water crust spots where<br>their diving spots are that's where they<br>draw the line they will not share that<br>information Gatekeepers I call them and<br>anyway coming up our next uh key speaker<br>today is a proud am murri and a oh I<br>hope I say this right uh camar<br>camar C Camy cam Roy Ka got to get that<br>right camiller Roy nation and is a<br>researcher in indigenous water science<br>qualifications in Hydro geology and<br>environmental science and in the final<br>stages of a PhD at the University of cra<br>uh he is also a board member of the New<br>South Wales EPA a member of the<br>Wentworth group and concerned scientists<br>a governor of the WWF Australia and<br>president of the Australian freshwater<br>science Society hii Nation cber<br>M as you can sort of see there my kids<br>call me an ass Pro as an associate<br>professor so it's uh it's it's stuck<br>yeah um so yeah I've got to use it if<br>that's what the kids call<br>me um look I'm camil Roman and uh yeah I<br>just want to say Yama which is a<br>greeting in our language and which which<br>it's sort of when you greet someone you<br>sort of say you know hell how you going<br>but it's it's more about what is your<br>intention and I suppose you know why are<br>you here why what are you doing what's<br>next and I think you know we've heard<br>here that you know we you you guys want<br>to bring back the wakat to its former<br>glory and you know that's that's<br>definitely something to live by uh a lot<br>of the old people there um and and and<br>the new people so my son there on the<br>bottom right there uh two kids when they<br>were a lot younger um at our Sacred<br>Water Hole um and then obviously the the<br>old people you can sort of see so yeah<br>they're special photos and always like<br>to acknowledge country with them um I<br>know they're with me so I've been here<br>before uh 2016 I come off the bench as<br>we said um and I think it was a wakata<br>river conference wasn't it back then um<br>and I it was a massive stitch up um<br>because they said oh yeah just can you<br>present see then I had to follow the<br>deputy Grand Chief of the crew<br>nation and then Brad<br>mgrid so oh it was an absolute honor to<br>talk then and and uh be amongst that<br>wisdom and and greatness and obviously<br>there was a lot of other presenters and<br>then yeah rocked up again in 2019 with<br>brother Phil um we're up the hill and<br>yeah we gave another pres I think the<br>actual King turned up at that time but<br>he didn't want to come in because he<br>didn't want to interrupt our<br>presentation like how humble is that the<br>king the king you know come in please<br>don't sit in the<br>car but yeah it was it was very humbling<br>that experience and yeah like I love<br>River selfies so that was<br>2017 and then just recently the other<br>day so um that's the way I celebrate my<br>Rivers is uh always take a selfie with<br>it look uh and obviously huge thank you<br>to the people that got me here um<br>Lorraine for the original invitation and<br>then yeah Tim and anded edin of course<br>and Charlie and Dennis and and shabonne<br>who's looked after us all um the wado<br>river Authority um and the university<br>and obviously W tyui thanks for having<br>me um talk about don't ride off the<br>Aussies on bombing so we need an<br>oldfashioned trasman bomb off so we need<br>neutral<br>country no no no wait wait wait he's<br>getting ready he's preparing so this is<br>he's he's he has this is my son so he<br>has International bombing experience so<br>this is in malta in St peters's Bay and<br>look at that<br>hey so I suppose yeah yeah just in in<br>Goodwill yeah we we'd love a bomb off<br>yeah um into the serious stuff now um<br>and Australia you know we only respond<br>to a crisis um you know we had a th000<br>kilometers of blue green agle bloom in<br>our one of our big rivers and we had<br>huge National Water reform um we've had<br>uh the Millennium drought and the mega<br>drought and uh I suppose that that that<br>challenge for us is that you know these<br>in the last 30 years two of the worst<br>droughts on record have been experience<br>so you know that's not normal um we've<br>got species extinctions we had have<br>Rivers drying up millions of dead fish<br>in<br>20189 um and then obviously fish kills<br>2.0 we saw in uh Western New South Wales<br>um in 2022 and then we had horrendous<br>fires in 920 where lives and obviously<br>property were lost in a lot of country<br>you know some of you know threatened<br>species were this is the only place they<br>lived and they were just burnt or crisp<br>so it's quite we've been doing it tough<br>and then yeah you think about last year<br>North Coast of New South Wales had two<br>one in5 100 Year floods in a matter of<br>months two one in five so these floods<br>should only happen every 500 years so<br>they had two in a couple of months so<br>like this is this is what we're dealing<br>with and then obviously the other bit<br>was in 2020 uh we couldn't save juk and<br>Gorge so it's in wa it was all approved<br>by government all approved by government<br>uh it's a 40,000 year old cave with<br>those people's<br>occupation uh evidence you know there<br>there's sacred items in there and a<br>mining company blew it up but they had<br>approval to do it that's normal every<br>day that's businesses usual in the<br>colony as we say and that's um that's<br>just yeah refreshing photo of of you<br>know great smelling place of all those<br>dead fish you know you can sort of see a<br>lot of lot of small silver bodied silver<br>brim you can see a large bodied fish<br>there but a lot of our lot of those<br>species are totem species so we have a<br>lot of connection to those species uh<br>bit more um water is is who we are we're<br>connected you know in many ways it's in<br>our songs dances stories and art of<br>course um we have strong diversity over<br>300 languages and over you know 6 or 700<br>dialect so you we're not all the same<br>Aral people aren't all the same um<br>trying to connect with our water the way<br>the old people knew water um tell our<br>stories our way um building indigenous<br>research methodologies to way we do<br>business business and then move to a<br>point where we can decolonize water and<br>then get our old people to validate our<br>science that we're<br>creating um this is sort of policy<br>setting so we're getting moving towards<br>a a restoration project so I suppose<br>we're the only colonized country without<br>a treaty with its first people um so we<br>don't have uh veto so we couldn't say no<br>to the blowing up of that 40,000 year<br>old cave um our land and Waters were<br>given away modified diverted harvested<br>overex extracted polluted and the other<br>fact is that you know my mom's<br>generation we were encountered as humans<br>till the late<br>1960s think of that so not human um and<br>I was born a human so I was lucky but<br>they'll still they'll<br>still they'll still taking the children<br>away you know in the 1970s when I was<br>born so you know those sort of this is<br>recent history um and we find that every<br>time there's a review of a do doent it's<br>sort of a copy and Pace you know we need<br>to do better with our original t people<br>um so when we became human all the good<br>land and water was gone and water from<br>those huge reforms in the early<br>2000s um they separated land and water<br>so created two separate markets and so<br>if our original people want water they<br>actually got to go to a market and B<br>purchase water and so that that can<br>range from you know $80 in Good Times<br>$80 a megaliter so million a million<br>liters of water in in in the river<br>system um to $1,000 in dry times so it's<br>very flu you know fluctuates with the<br>market<br>um the aim for me was to to test the<br>process you know which engaged my people<br>um through spirit and Co co-design and<br>co-management of river flows and to<br>Wetland this is the location uh so it's<br>sort of in in I got a bit selfish I<br>wanted to do research on my own country<br>I've been helping a lot of other mobs<br>over the years um and you know I become<br>selfish in the air that's the front<br>cover of my PhD which is a painting of<br>my River uh so it sits there and reminds<br>me every day of why I do what I do and<br>you know that chunk of the Wetland is<br>always good so it's a state Conservation<br>area where I do my study uh so only 9.7%<br>is in public hands so a lot of it was<br>privately held land so locked Gates uh<br>Angry Farmers with guns um and you know<br>we weren't even allowed access to the<br>riparian Zone our River you know where a<br>lot of our cultural places are um you<br>know originally was 100,000 hectares so<br>it's still a a small chunk and there's<br>uh a lot a lot of a lot of that land a<br>lot of the wet land is on private land<br>so we have good good private land<br>holders that are Keen yeah there's<br>ramsar sites and things like that so but<br>I suppose being locked out for 160 years<br>we got to reconnect with our country um<br>we still don't have the keys yet even<br>though I got one cut don't tell anyone<br>I'm in New Zealand that's all right uh<br>so I have the the master key to the<br>padlock uh which is cool but I think<br>it's um uh we have to you know we want<br>to get to a point where it's co-managed<br>co you know we want to be part of the<br>recovery of this country um these are<br>just some of our species so y little<br>little little um quaran or cockatil uh<br>Dinan is the Emu of course<br>um and yeah like things like we've come<br>out of L and our emu are breeding twice<br>and they they don't normally do that so<br>good times and so emu are breeding twice<br>and we have the Emu in the sky which is<br>the the dark matter in the Milky Way and<br>it changes and moves around and that<br>that is linked to how we hunt the Emu<br>but also how we collect the eggs and so<br>you can sort of see a group of group of<br>emies there um and yeah like they<br>the system was out of whack because of<br>linia so the old people would have known<br>you know that oh we can catch we can<br>collect because there's all of a sudden<br>the males are chasing the females again<br>and the males actually rare the chick so<br>they were sitting on the eggs and and<br>things like that so it's you know those<br>sort of changes in in in our um in our<br>environment is is observed uh there's a<br>red belly black snake gabay so yeah he's<br>top 10 in the world of venomous so yeah<br>he's uh um tasty but yeah scary um but<br>yeah you got to be careful um and oh<br>actually I might go back yeah there's I<br>don't know if you can see which was the<br>laser that one so this little fell here<br>that's a a little um a little owlet and<br>it's fully grown adult and it looks like<br>a fluffy little baby but it um yeah<br>there just has a little little um<br>certain song and yeah it was behind<br>behind one of our camps when we're on<br>site uh to find him was really cool and<br>then obviously um um M and gy which is<br>our tree goana and yeah he's tasty as<br>well he has a a beautiful oil so a lot<br>of the oil old people used oils from the<br>from the goana and then obviously<br>getting kids back on Country um we call<br>them gangles the young ones and making<br>sure they're reconnecting with the<br>country so that was a thing where we had<br>scientists Elders teachers<br>and government people and obviously with<br>the kids you know introduce<br>reintroducing them to their own<br>country uh some of the methods um ethics<br>approval sometimes ethics can be<br>unethical um it was a challenge in<br>itself but I got a letter from my mom to<br>say I'm a good boy and he'll do good<br>work with his own people and that got me<br>ethics approval so maybe I think that<br>was it so face to face was definitely<br>essential uh there was a generic set of<br>question but you know you know what<br>Elders are like they don't stick to the<br>script and they wander off and you got<br>to try and bring them back and it was<br>you know a lot of that stuff was was<br>excellent you know some of the stuff I<br>couldn't collect because it was secret<br>and sacred and they just sort of drifted<br>off into those those conversation<br>especially when you sit around the fire<br>um I you know they that's special um and<br>I suppose we had Co and la so access to<br>people in country was heavily restricted<br>which was which was tough through those<br>times some of the outcomes so we had<br>system scale thinking species seasonal<br>markers cultural Harvest long knowledge<br>and that that connection so you know up<br>to 65,000 years of connection to this<br>landscape um exclusion from the water<br>markets um I'll quickly run through<br>these you know the interconnectedness<br>between the spiritual and the<br>biocultural U biophysical was strong<br>with these you know people so even<br>though we' had been locked out for 160<br>years let's say when you're out of WR<br>country they could you could they were<br>they were listening to country and they<br>were telling stories about country even<br>though they'd been lot you know for<br>Generations they'd been locked out um I<br>suppose where the interconnectedness<br>between the Landscapes and obviously the<br>water and and and the species and the<br>climate and um where that wasn't<br>considered they were reluctant to engage<br>but then when you started thinking about<br>ecosystem thinking and sort of you know<br>to point a western way of thinking but I<br>wanted to bring in my my indous ways of<br>knowing and being so it was sitting<br>around the fire and you know like I had<br>some people that didn't even want to<br>sign ethics forms and like how do you<br>deal with that at a university level and<br>I said can I record you n no you're in<br>my bloody house I'm not TI of nothing<br>sorry sorry we'll move on but I suppose<br>you know how do you in an academic<br>construct you know how do you deal with<br>that yeah um definitely climate change<br>has you know we're changing that<br>narrative to climate changed not climate<br>you know it's not not changing you know<br>it's changed where where we're feeling<br>it now and this is one of our big water<br>holes uh in the GU Wetlands the ging and<br>water hole this is October 2020 and<br>that's my son walking across it in<br>December 2020 so it was hot and dry no<br>no new inflows he's the bomber yeah so<br>he couldn't do a bomb there um so I<br>suppose and you sort of see his<br>shoulders slumped he's<br>s yeah that was a recent um fish kill we<br>had uh as well so that was in September<br>this year that's um it's a site with<br>cultural values cultural indicators as<br>well as non-indigenous value so there<br>was a lake there was a I'll get to it in<br>a sec um I better keep moving it's it's<br>a large Lagoon um called<br>tonger um that needs regular watering<br>water and you know the non- people had<br>connection to it because it had you know<br>was great for hunting ducks and things<br>like that but it's it's a space you know<br>there's scarred trees so we used to scar<br>trees to to collect um you know it<br>depends you know make canoes or Shields<br>or whatever else so um there's a large<br>scar tree that's remaining there so this<br>is a heavily developed area so irrigated<br>Agriculture and we found a koala scat so<br>it's it's red Ridge Country um it's it's<br>a higher point and what we found was<br>there's a lot of bush food around there<br>so some definitely has been translocated<br>by by by my ancestors so you know Bush<br>banana wouldn't be normally there so<br>it's been translocated to this place and<br>yeah that's uh koala poooo um and or we<br>call it GDA is the koala but gner is is<br>the poooo um uh so yeah having evidence<br>of that species there also was quite<br>significant so this was an old map we<br>found um and obviously Tara mry was the<br>Lagoon and you this is the large scar<br>tree um o sorry um you can sort of see<br>the Outlet's<br>huge um there myself the and my uncle so<br>uh that's mom's eldest brother uh she's<br>one of 14 so I got a crazy amount of<br>cousins um and so like these places<br>still exist the cultural heritage and<br>connection is still there and it's still<br>strong and I suppose that would have<br>been a potentially a large sheet so<br>you're walking along the Wetland<br>collecting you your bulbs you might have<br>a little fire burning on it and you're<br>walking through the Wetland um yeah duck<br>eggs or swan eggs and things like that<br>so um those sort of places still exist<br>so you can sort of see that it's pretty<br>dry that was 2018 and then as we come<br>out of<br>L you you just add water and it comes<br>back to life this place is special so we<br>know it's special we have all these<br>cultural uh signs to say it's important<br>um so and the obviously with our<br>disconnection uh potentially over those<br>Generations you know we're going to lose<br>we're at the risk of losing you know the<br>species that are important uh because we<br>want water in these places to make sure<br>that the species turn up and we can<br>actually undertake our cultural<br>obligations um the the seasonal markers<br>uh the cult and obviously cultural<br>Harvest yeah like the there our three<br>main fish the the maray Cod the yellow<br>belly um and obviously the catfish and<br>then din one so you can sort of see gumo<br>yeah the male looking after the the<br>chicks and we call them bugger buggers<br>um it's a cool name um and yeah and so<br>he he's he's responsible for rearing the<br>the chicks and whereas the the ladies<br>just go off and have<br>fun uh that's warle greens which is like<br>a spinach you know so these sort of<br>things are um are important in this<br>place um the Black Swan and the duck so<br>potentially you know you'd be collecting<br>the swan eggs before they mature but you<br>wouldn't take them all that's uh water<br>literacy is huge like water law is<br>bloody complex and you know a lot of a<br>lot of our communities you know some<br>potentially have literacy and numeracy<br>challenges um M you know some parts of<br>Australia where English is like fifth<br>language so you know they they they<br>speak all these different other Clan<br>groups and family group languages but<br>they English might be fifth so water<br>trying to explain water law is yeah it's<br>I've heard it's the saying is it's it's<br>like rocket science but harder um so<br>cultural barriers getting those young<br>people back into this space is important<br>for us um and then I suppose the<br>knowledge exchange when we're on country<br>is is the best fun you know I suppose<br>having the elders there talking to the<br>kids is is is Magic and I suppose yeah<br>like as I talked about the water Market<br>we have almost zero um this this is an<br>easy photo to understand this is how<br>easy Aboriginal water<br>is I did this a number of years ago and<br>nothing has changed so we've got all<br>these challenges trying to get access to<br>water um and I suppose you know that's<br>potentially why we're excluded from the<br>market all right I'll get adle uh so<br>there is an environmental contingency<br>allowance in the water plan so we do<br>believe we can access that for<br>potentially cultural reasons and I think<br>it's it's getting water into the places<br>where they should be going uh so it's<br>identifying those spaces with which have<br>cultural value um and obviously we're<br>we're trying to look at those spaces and<br>I you know in the end I did that tonger<br>Lagoon doesn't get water um and this is<br>one of the reasons why so you can sort<br>of see that's a that's a wheat farm and<br>this is part of the Wetland and so water<br>would come down here and then naturally<br>would head that way in in sort of medium<br>flow<br>events and unfortunately this is flat<br>country<br>and you know it only takes a small mound<br>to divert water and so what happened is<br>um that that's the mound you like that<br>animation that was high tech H let's<br>again um that's that's as good as I<br>get but those that that um that that<br>small Mound moves water away from that<br>legon so when medium flows we don't get<br>water into those spaces and for me this<br>is my Learning Journey you know it's<br>huge amount of learning for me you know<br>reconnection who you are where you're<br>from know your story and then we get to<br>tell our story so I suppose these are<br>all the bit of language you know caring<br>for<br>gimar yeah which is Mother Earth Mother<br>of the earth so and you know we we talk<br>about our ancestors come from Beyond the<br>Milky Way behind the Milky Way so that's<br>where our ancestors come from and um the<br>bdle which is the creation and I suppose<br>you know that that's what we're trying<br>to re re-inject into our into our kids<br>as well you know is this is where this<br>is who you are this is your story this<br>is your<br>country um this is yeah obvious that<br>it's you know has failed perspectives<br>can be gathered you know we're not that<br>scary we're nice people I'm going to<br>have a yarn you know and I think<br>definitely building policy that is<br>Equitable and inclusive you know that<br>co-design stuff is is important um<br>because I said you know a lot of these<br>developments and governments don't have<br>to engage abigal<br>people so I suppose it's it's doing that<br>and you you'll get the benefits of<br>engaging people and listening to some of<br>the oldest water stories on the planet<br>and I think that's<br>exciting um so yeah these are just some<br>of the journals that been pumping out so<br>it's it's walking the walking the walk<br>let's say so I'm Australian Journal<br>Environmental Management so as<br>Australian New Zealand papers and there<br>was an abstract written in an Abal<br>language Ang so potentially that might<br>have been a first um which is cool and<br>then Australian Journal of Water<br>Resources I was great to connect with Dr<br>Gail Tipper and you know we had<br>indigenous co-lead authors as well um<br>myself and my supervisor Ross um<br>Thompson we won the g&amp; Alexander medal<br>from Engineers Australia because we're<br>not Engineers we don't get a medal we<br>get a bit of<br>paper bloody<br>engineers and then that one also we had<br>um<br>uh we challenged the editors of the<br>journal to to have um one of the the<br>papers had marar River of Life as the<br>first author they accepted it so that's<br>a huge shift in sort of environmental<br>journals water journals uh a couple<br>other papers so um Martin you you'll<br>know that one so we got a chapter go<br>going into a book that yeah Martin's<br>leading H he'll talk a bit later the sum<br>so hopefully that'll be out in in 202 4<br>available for about 20 bucks or 400 I<br>can't remember something like<br>that um yeah another paper it was more<br>about this was this paper was about the<br>methodology I used and where I come from<br>and how I engaged and there's me as my<br>beard grows through Co with my River<br>selfies<br>thanks<br>as Pro oh<br>Sor laying down the wedow there Brad<br>laying down the wiedow there my friend<br>and you know what sport sport is what<br>brings us together right brings us<br>together and I'm reminded of the uh<br>multi Allstars and the indigenous rugby<br>league game that happens and getting to<br>see those two teams come together but<br>more importantly uh the sharing of<br>culture and we had a few mobs come<br>across as well uh to help celebrate that<br>game and seeing uh the hucka and the<br>indigenous dancers uh performed on<br>International stages absolutely<br>fantastic so a bomb off is definitely<br>accepted if I was to judge your son I<br>didn't know cuz you didn't show the<br>video and saw him doing the pin drop<br>action see so it's the pin drop action<br>but I would like to see how his form<br>would have been just before he hit the<br>water and I could have given him a<br>proper score there but the splash<br>definitely a nine out of 10 there so<br>I'll give you that um it was good also<br>to see the pictures of your native<br>Wildlife my older brothers and sisters<br>they all they all live over in Australia<br>and New South Wales and in Melbourne uh<br>I went over there for holiday uh<br>cockroaches started flying around uh I<br>saw my first uh humman Spider and that's<br>when I knew that I should be the brother<br>that stays<br>home and look after the ker while they<br>go over there and do that um I have<br>tasted the purple<br>Gana fantastic drink uh it was flowing<br>as well uh it's good to see the um<br>cockroach bird as well um and you know<br>in the spirit of unity maybe the<br>and the P can get together and uh I<br>don't know you know have a<br>cord uh but awesome awesome to hear your<br>um your cord and uh hopefully that uh in<br>the future of course many many Ms will<br>come together and and you find that<br>connect and you can all work together to<br>get to the ultimate<br>speaker is an established World expert h<br>on weaving indigenous knowledge and<br>science to realize the dreams of the<br>communities he works with he's also<br>spearheading alternative ways of<br>dressing success sustainability<br>including weaving indigenous knowledge<br>and oh this is a big word should have<br>went to school for this one uh<br>epistemologies there we go I got there<br>uh with science and Inter legislation<br>assessment Frameworks and uh decision<br>support<br>tools<br>University of Oakland associate<br>professor<br>Dan<br>adjustment<br>I um course that's a hard act to follow<br>gracious<br>me um but the title of this this talk<br>was um inspired by many things of course<br>wonderful speaking about our our many<br>chiefs at our manyi<br>bins and the decisions they made that<br>ensured that we're here today to be to<br>be hosting this and talking to all it's<br>also inspired in part by um a colleague<br>working on a research project with me<br>she's a she's an artist works a lot on<br>the digital medium um and her and her<br>husband her husband's an artist<br>too and and they had an exhibition in<br>taaf called be the tanif and actually it<br>was a it was a challenge to to many of<br>our um many of our folks who who occupy<br>seats on boards um and just keep the<br>seat<br>warm and actually you know that's a<br>responsibility when you're in those<br>roles and so that it was a challenge<br>because they were a little bit upset<br>with some of their uh their mandated<br>people on those roles they said you need<br>to be the tany fire and you're in that<br>role it's not just about the Mana it's<br>about you<br>know doing good calls and making good<br>calls and in this instance for our<br>hour and so um to<br>hour and just a said of bit of a context<br>and actually before I do that much of<br>what I say here is is almost Irrelevant<br>for the<br>cordor<br>um because you guys are being the tanif<br>you are hitting the tanif and doing<br>amazing stuff but I want to use um some<br>images of our just to set a context for<br>for the rest of the nation and so you<br>know I was beautiful like this when it<br>when it flows out of of<br>tooa um and yet you know<br>you know Downstream a little bit not<br>quite so beautiful<br>n and and this is just an example of of<br>minale rivers um acrossing<br>AMU and so this is kind of the challenge<br>we<br>face and and and this isn't even about<br>kind of pointing a finger at at at a<br>government whichever color it is it's<br>kind of the governments successively you<br>know we find ourselves where we are<br>today um because it's been pretty much a<br>bottomline approach um and you're<br>bucking the trend here with your 25 Mana<br>so I just need to express that again and<br>you know acknowledging you know<br>yesterday it was that was those Flex<br>Roots groups who are just doing amazing<br>stuff<br>um but it's not achieving the scale and<br>rapidity of change we need and I think<br>You' all agree with that and that's why<br>we're here and I also don't think it's<br>not enough to rely on government and So<br>within that challenge it's how do we how<br>do we realize our agency how do we be<br>that tanif far and how do we heed the T<br>far uh in our Collective efforts and and<br>in our<br>Mahi and just a bit more as if as if<br>those kind of words were when enough you<br>know this stuff just makes you want to<br>cry and sometimes give up but we<br>don't because our Rivers need us and we<br>need our rivers and that's and that's<br>here one of I I think one of the<br>challenges and this is um kind of<br>looking at it from from the national<br>scale um even to the regional scale is<br>is that<br>often often those rules those<br>regulations and the things we do we do<br>them individually and we think<br>individually and and yet the message we<br>heard loud and clear yesterday and we're<br>hearing Evan this morning from um from<br>Stu and and and from Brad even is that<br>actually the strength comes when we act<br>collectively um but it's funny how how<br>that individualist mindset is really<br>ingrained in us and I experienced that<br>driving down yesterday morning um coming<br>along um just just coming off off off<br>the new part of the expressway<br>coming up to that part where there seems<br>to have been Road Works since even<br>before there was a Motorway there I<br>don't know<br>um and it's like there's a sign that<br>says we're going to we're going to come<br>down from two lanes into one and so when<br>you think collectively you just join the<br>end of that one queue because then we<br>all arrive and get through it the same<br>time that we arrived in that queue and<br>then we come but some folks want to<br>think they need to be there a bit<br>quicker and they think about the<br>individual and they try and hook around<br>the sides there and it's like there it<br>is it's<br>ingrained and so she reminding ourselves<br>that gosh we we're ingrained to think<br>individually and the things we do but<br>when we're Collective we're so much more<br>stronger and we can achieve so much<br>more so in<br>2012 um I was privileged to be at the<br>transit of Venus uh commemoration and<br>celebration that was the the the idea of<br>Paul Kahan so Paul Kahan um sadly he<br>actually passed away before before we<br>held this celebration based in taati uh<br>and then going up and we were hosted by<br>the uawa community up in up in TOA Bay<br>um in Cara to the people from from UAA<br>they just got smashed again over the<br>weekend with with more<br>flooding um and then we came back<br>together there was a collection of of<br>amazing people and I was just kind of<br>snuck in the back door when no one was<br>looking and they one of the communities<br>actually the UAA Community they said hey<br>you're you're an ating group of people<br>who who can do stuff and get things done<br>our River needs help and and then that<br>sh was say our River needs help our<br>River needs help and so the call came<br>out from from the<br>rivers we need your<br>help and so um an Salman stood up and<br>said we hear you um and then she put out<br>a tel to everyone who was there who<br>wants to help um help our<br>rivers and so from that um an idea was<br>born and we're with the support of UA<br>we're still working with UA we're still<br>working with other<br>communities what we realized was<br>that uh we were still making really<br>terrible decisions for for for the<br>health of our Rivers we were behaving as<br>if we could manage our Rivers no no we<br>need to we need to we need to to we need<br>to regulate and manage ourselves and our<br>relationships with our Rivers because<br>that's how it's going to work<br>best and we realized it was all we were<br>all about making the river behave how<br>much we can take out of the river how<br>much we can put back on the river and<br>none of it was from the river so we<br>tried to put the river at the center and<br>we had an approach which was we call<br>tador thousand rivers in a state of<br>order um but we realized quickly that<br>actually what we were really trying to<br>do was be the voice of the river and we<br>recognize that this you know there are<br>some legislation that exists you know P<br>to 35 Mana is is effectively doing that<br>it's giving a voice to the river we've<br>got the wangi we've got to<br>Ura and in Practical terms where that<br>didn't exist for all the other rivers in<br>altero New Zealand we kind of thought hm<br>the voice of the river can be expressed<br>this way<br>in in terms of River Health and River<br>behavior and River stories so even<br>though we have all this information<br>we're still making bad decisions so what<br>we thought was missing was actually that<br>that connect and we heard it beautifully<br>yesterday you<br>don't you don't what was it you don't<br>care about what you don't know you don't<br>value what you don't what you don't care<br>about that was our beautiful um our team<br>who presented yesterday our our Gumboot<br>approach Ka<br>so what's interesting though is that we<br>got Heats of information on River<br>Health and in fact more information<br>there isn't going to change anything it<br>just further diagnoses the problem that<br>we have and you know you might get a<br>scientist arguing at 7.64 this and 7.51<br>that and that might be that might be<br>contested in environment Court M like<br>you were saying you know those<br>challenges that we Face are real it's<br>because the information is just you're<br>either dying quicker or slower basically<br>and so we already got a lot of this<br>stuff and then we also thought you know<br>conceptually around River behavior and<br>it's controlled a little bit by geology<br>you know that's why the wiar is a little<br>bit more poty with sediment than other<br>ones you got a more pmus on on the W<br>cutor it's about how the river behaves<br>and it's about flooding and hicka we've<br>seen a lot of that in in in the last<br>year um and if fact the last two years<br>and in fact the last three and actually<br>when you when you look back through time<br>there's been significant floods in that<br>kind of one and 500 or 1 and 250 year<br>seemingly every other<br>month and one of the challenges with<br>that is we're basing frequency and that<br>statistical analysis on how the climate<br>used to be like like we heard the<br>climate has changed so our models need<br>to change<br>too cuz I I can tell you the amount of<br>times you present a community say one in<br>500 year flight they just laugh at you<br>like we just experienced four of those<br>last year what are you talking about are<br>your models broken or your data is<br>broken or<br>both and you know it's a tough thing to<br>hear but you know a flood plane is a is<br>a flat piece of area that<br>floods and we decided to put stuff on<br>those things and then we get a bit upset<br>when when the flood plane floods F it's<br>in the name we couldn't have been any<br>more<br>obvious the challenge we find ourselves<br>though is that we we we we're bearing<br>the legacy of 150 years of of really ill<br>thought decisions and or 160 I think it<br>was we mentioned you know I'm for Brad<br>this team so what do we do<br>and we think what's missing is the<br>stories it's how people know their<br>rivers and you like you said you know<br>sit with your people 160 years off the<br>hour off country boom it all comes back<br>you're listening to country you know and<br>I'm I'm drawing on this this famous<br>quote you know not tell and this idea of<br>actually putting the river at the center<br>telling the river stories and the way we<br>think about it it's kind of like um you<br>know the the river behavior is kind of<br>like the woodwind section and and the<br>River Health is kind of like the brass<br>and the river stories is I don't know<br>the<br>percussion and so what we need is all of<br>those parts of the orchestra in order to<br>have the<br>symphony and at the moment we've only<br>got some of it and it's a little bit Out<br>Of Tune if we can bring that stuff<br>together we can start to do great things<br>and you know the Inspire I'm also<br>inspired by by this this is out of the W<br>up the River Act I'm sure you know it<br>all you know it's actually it's a gift<br>and it's our<br>responsibility all at once so for me<br>that's the that's that's the be the<br>tanif that's the call that I think okay<br>we need to be doing something we need to<br>be doing something different outside of<br>what you're doing at w which is was<br>amazing so we've been working with the<br>gbbn community for over 10 years now um<br>and then they got smashed again with<br>with Gabriel and so this is the wa River<br>the one that you've seen all over the<br>news um in in recent times and this is<br>it when it's you know looking at it's<br>most beautiful and best and when<br>Community is on it in it with it um so<br>just uce the team real quick um some of<br>the members of the team colleagues from<br>the University of Orland some of our<br>postgrad<br>students um these are these are kind of<br>the core of the people that responded to<br>that call that an made in<br>2012 um but because it isn't just about<br>what people do in in universities and<br>institutions we've got some Faro based<br>Ina um and so Walton's with with the the<br>hot Waka amama team uh Reena is the<br>artist I mentioned earlier Reena K KY uh<br>she's from Lon which is right at the<br>river mouth of the a the mat she's also<br>from aawa as is here Gibson in fact the<br>urupa I think they lost a bit more on<br>the weekend with with the weekend's<br>floods uh and en rudu some of you may<br>may know in and some of his Mahi around<br>mody um and and so for us those are some<br>of those local tanify that we need to<br>listen to as well as the cordor of of<br>the tany fire and and the key thing<br>about those and at the risk of kind<br>of pointing out the obvious the reason<br>we had tany was to keep us safe they are<br>Guardians they tell us where there might<br>be places in the rivers where we<br>shouldn't go places where we might need<br>to behave accordingly you know for<br>goodness sakes we all know about um nahu<br>and kutah just down the road here um and<br>how I first heard about that there's<br>some kind of headline on the herald you<br>know mythical creature costs the<br>taxpayer millions of dollars you know<br>this tany fire changed the motorway and<br>then you know less than two years after<br>the the motorway open massive flood goes<br>right through home people I can just<br>imagine my mind<br>saying and then the planet is saying why<br>didn't you tell us it was a flood risk<br>it's like that's how that's how we<br>understand that tanify that's how it<br>manifests and so I'm still waiting for<br>that next headline mythical creature<br>saves taxpayer millions of dollars not<br>going to hold my breath on that one far<br>now<br>um just to care for my time don't want<br>to take out too much cuz we good to have<br>some cordor and then get to morning tea<br>that's a dangerous place to be I know<br>edit is coming up next but hopefully her<br>video is loading<br>up and you know so when we think about<br>he the tiny fire T about let's think<br>about how we do our Mahi in in a m<br>worldview way so we put up this map and<br>people go oh that's Nifty and neat but<br>actually that's reflective of how M see<br>the world or make sense of it and you<br>have no idea um and this is actually<br>really good I do it and like kind of<br>technical audiences there there's a lot<br>of kind of alpha Personalities in those<br>rooms often and um I put this image up<br>and usually those hyper Alpha um<br>personality would say oh excuse me your<br>picture's up the wrong way and I just<br>smile to<br>myself and then I was like oh and then<br>everyone else who kind of cottoned on<br>it's like no you're just used to seeing<br>it that way and because of your<br>personality you don't see the world any<br>other way and that's part of the problem<br>is that there there's people think<br>there's only one way to see and make<br>sense of the world um and the M you're<br>doing here in the W you flip that<br>completely around you say we put the<br>river at the center that's how we do it<br>that's how we roll and so the wiar is is<br>is a catchment that flows down through<br>gisborn um a little bit technical stuff<br>now sorry team just that there the<br>catchment um a little bit about what's<br>going on up in the catchment I think<br>this is probably very similar to many<br>catchments you know that you live in and<br>work on um The Challenge here is that<br>we've got young um highly erodable soils<br>because the geology is quite young we've<br>got a lot of tectonic activity<br>earthquakes in this area and then we had<br>a veneer of of of Ash that kind of has<br>been deposited in that area in the last<br>100 oh maybe a million years or<br>so and so we know when when when<br>conditions are good um the river can<br>look lovely and then when the conditions<br>are not good it can look absolutely<br>terrible and so we've got forestry in in<br>the catchment up there in the<br>headquarters um and then some of the<br>practices after you harvest live a<br>little bit to be desired in fact you<br>know there was a there was a full<br>forestry inquiry that that that took<br>place here<br>um we're hoping that rules will change<br>as a result of this and so on the back<br>of that with these high magnitude<br>rainfall events you know there's just<br>more sediment and slash that keeps<br>coming down um you know this is this is<br>some of the information that's coming<br>through but even that's kind of snapshot<br>even though that's that's that's<br>accurate the community is telling us<br>they want they want to have really up<br>toate information about what's going on<br>they also want to have models looking<br>forward so we're trying to create models<br>that that adjust to the new reality<br>accepting that climate has changed not<br>trying to use old data from in the past<br>you know this is what happened um in the<br>recent one and this is just PA of the<br>course think about all of the rivers and<br>the bridges in this part of the country<br>um when you get a moderate rainfall<br>event the Wastewater system just fails<br>um the city grew quicker than the<br>infrastructure kept up<br>with and you know on this River some<br>people call it the the river of gold<br>this part because we had some kayakers<br>who won gold medals in in the 80s uh and<br>then more recently we've got Waka and so<br>the hota Waka team pedals on this River<br>Champs and yet you know they come out of<br>the water and they get all these hucky<br>hucky on on their<br>feet and stuff and like oh hi I should<br>have given you a trigger warning there<br>sorry team that's um but but actually<br>the the the the under 18 they were the<br>world champs two years ago or three<br>years ago who who gave us this image<br>said use this image because people need<br>to know what's going<br>on and so our project is is kind of<br>about letting the river speak we're<br>trying to tell the stories of the river<br>with the community we're recognizing and<br>this is interesting to hear what some<br>people are doing that digital<br>information can be really accessible<br>thinking about what Shannon was saying<br>with those Adroid senses when when the<br>community can have an amazing data set<br>you know you you can't hide from it it's<br>right in front of you the other reality<br>is right there and then when you can<br>weave their stories and how they connect<br>with their Rivers then we might start to<br>see some real positive change<br>um and we want the river to heal and<br>I've heard that already about the wour<br>as well so we're all on the same hiding<br>ofano um just to give you some idea of<br>some of the work that we've been<br>undertaking this river is really<br>connected as soon as sedent gets in it<br>just gets flushed down um down at the<br>lowlands and into the into the harbor<br>and into the um the coda um seedling um<br>sea grounds and breeding grounds right<br>under the port<br>there and we're working with um modeling<br>to try and work out where are the the<br>settlement erosion hotpots um where<br>might we be best placed to do our<br>riparium planting where might we put our<br>Wetlands what we discovered sadly is<br>that maybe 25 years of planting um some<br>of it was just completely destroyed in<br>the Gabrielle event um either eroded<br>away or or completely inundated and so<br>immediately the community has pivoted<br>they've gone straight to the tribet<br>trees and the wetlands so um their work<br>is an activation of of the river<br>speaking it's all of those things the<br>River Health the river Behavior and the<br>river stories all coming together with<br>better outcomes for the<br>river and so in closing um it's about<br>trying to actualize those River voices<br>where we don't have a 22 F Mana how do<br>we get stuff done and we found it's by<br>mobilizing people and communities you<br>know just a what catchment restoration<br>groups have just emerged all it took was<br>just an awareness that oh you're<br>interested and you're interested and<br>you're interested together we can do<br>amazing<br>stuff and yeah recognizing that this<br>idea of of making room for rivers in<br>places where there is room to be made<br>for Rivers recognizing we can't do that<br>everywhere it's as much as a mindset<br>shift as it is as a physical active<br>letting letting the river be a river so<br>in closing you know when I say he the<br>tanif it's both acknowledging our M that<br>goes back Mar around how our Rivers<br>behave and the things they do and the<br>actions we take to keep ourselves safe<br>but also about being the tanif fire and<br>the position we have and the agency we<br>our<br>tanif yeah for those you who don't know<br>I'm the rebel tanif uh I'm the tanif you<br>don't listen to now straight up so they<br>ask me whether or not they can build<br>their houses on the wetlands yeah ni<br>sweet C build them over there all good<br>and then the flood would have came and<br>they would have blamed me and I says oh<br>the I want to bring the rebel t for they<br>said to those poor kids and and man that<br>is that is really shocking and I'm<br>hoping that that that that gets fixed<br>for those T when they enjoying the hour<br>but I would have been the tuny for this<br>as well if you don't want it to get<br>worse you better pedal fast so you can<br>get out of the water quick that's<br>probably why you're world champions<br>right now because you know you're<br>pedling really really fast but yeah<br>we're definitely one of the enemies OFA<br>there we're just trying to get the video<br>up to go at the moment and if that<br>doesn't happen we'll work on it uh in<br>the break and we'll take some questions<br>Ka but here we<br>an<br>is an experienced governor and director<br>serving in the W River Authority board<br>thei trust New Zealand biological<br>Heritage science challenge ewi uh and<br>not for-profit uh boards professionally<br>uh Iden is a freshwater scientist with a<br>background in river and Lake restoration<br>Tonga species research resource<br>management and environmental planning uh<br>she has experienced working at the<br>interface between policy Mami and and<br>science uh she grew up alongside the W<br>River and has Papa connections to<br>W iwi her strong technical expertise and<br>freshwater management sits alongside her<br>communic uh Community uh connections<br>Chief scientist New Zealand's biological<br>challenge everyone I was a little bit<br>touch and go I wasn't sure if my<br>presentation was going to load whether<br>or not we'd have to cut straight to the<br>break but just in time um it's appeared<br>but it still might be a b uh guess the<br>slides so just feel bear with me as uh<br>we head on through so to begin um my<br>presentation I just wanted to um share<br>this image of our hour um it was taken<br>from across across the ways there from<br>the top of the hu it's a beautiful a<br>beautiful morning with the sun rising<br>and the fog um over our hour um I'd like<br>to say that I climbed up the mountain to<br>take the photo myself but<br>uh I stole it off Facebook and uh so I<br>just like to I just want to acknowledge<br>the hak mat Predator free um group for<br>um sponsoring my cover<br>photo all right is this working okay so<br>um these are my uh these are my kids and<br>they've had the privilege of growing up<br>in and around um the hour uh as you can<br>see in one of the photos uh they before<br>they could walk into talk they were um<br>in in the front patch of uh of waiters<br>and going white Bing so whether it's uh<br>um getting white bait doing tahi being<br>on Waka um they've been very fortunate<br>in that they've um been in and around um<br>I was since they were<br>born uh this is the presentation of my<br>uh this is the title of my presentation<br>I'm pretty sure that's not the one that<br>I sent through to Tim so uh we'll just<br>um and so this is the catchment as a<br>whole I don't need to tell us what the<br>catchment looks like but I just sort i'<br>put it up there because I hadn't seen it<br>um as a whole uh in the presentations uh<br>yesterday but building on what Dan has<br>said you know coming out of Topo it<br>looks amazing um by the time you get<br>TOA um it's experienced quite a bit of<br>degradation along the<br>way uh just to locate us again<br>this yep<br>um this is the point where um the wiper<br>and the W cator um join together it's<br>quite an old image I think it's I think<br>it's in the '90s I think but you can see<br>um the high like sediment load coming in<br>from the wiper uh I also wanted to point<br>out the rail bridge that Julian spoke<br>about yesterday I didn't even know how<br>to use the<br>pointer the best bombing bridge for uh n<br>here um and so that's what we're here<br>that's what we're talking about um today<br>and so this is our hour and these are<br>some of the things that uh it has to<br>deal<br>with and then I kind of ran out of<br>things to think of so these are just uh<br>some of the things that our has to um<br>has to deal with right oh one<br>more oh two more sorry so it's a lot and<br>it<br>okay and so I guess um building on<br>Mike's presentation yesterday there are<br>the fundamentals right of rubber<br>restoration there's a pretty clear<br>pathway let's work out the state let's<br>you know get achievable goals let<br>through the feasibility all of that<br>stuff and the T tonics and that's<br>awesome and that is one way forward um<br>but then there's this other scientist<br>guy and he reckons<br>this and I think there's some value in<br>that too right so and I'm not saying we<br>should check the baby out with the bath<br>water what I'm saying is that not just<br>me what people are saying is that<br>there's other knowledge systems that can<br>contribute um to how we restore our<br>rivers and part of that is understanding<br>that there's whole different worldviews<br>like for us uh the river sometimes I go<br>to conferences and they talk about<br>rivers as external things like they this<br>water body that's there to provide<br>ecosystem services and blah blah blah<br>blah blah but like for us it's not it's<br>not that so like from our world viw our<br>river is a Tupa and our identity is um<br>you know fully connected um with our a<br>I'm not going to read it out you guys<br>can read um and in ancient times it<br>provided food water and a means of<br>Transport for our<br>tribe oh I also wanted to say sorry if I<br>went back a couple like oh no I'm not<br>I'll go forward but in terms of um the<br>title of my presentation around an IND<br>indigenous um perspective on River<br>restoration I just wanted to acknowledge<br>the speakers from yesterday they gave<br>the master class on that um mine is the<br>entry level um first year class but I'm<br>talking about Jaden anaru um Shannon and<br>Shannon and hangi they that was the<br>master class this is the the first year<br>class and so the way that we uh I guess<br>could approach uh River<br>restoration um and this came from the<br>trib's website as well is that the<br>teachings and the learnings from our<br>ancestors can help guide uh our thinking<br>they provided a lot of gems of wisdom<br>and I don't have time to go through all<br>of them but if you had to listen to uh P<br>all the way through this Symposium he's<br>been dropping little pears all the way<br>through when he talked about um the<br>origin of the White cutle River that the<br>connection between top and<br>um uh and then he talked about um why um<br>and how the river got its name he talked<br>about a lot of the um tongy CA um as<br>well and obviously we don't have time to<br>go through all of that but I'm just<br>saying there's lots of knowledge um that<br>our Tupa have shared um that can help<br>guide us<br>today I'm just going to share some of<br>them um and there's heaps of people in<br>here way more than me that can give the<br>deeper meanings but I'll just uh just<br>push on<br>through uh so this is the first um Marty<br>King so a lot of our um T had these uh<br>amazing sayings or Tonga that provide<br>this guidance and some of them have been<br>shared already before Sam Shar shared<br>one in his presentation too um this one<br>kind of speaks to one way of<br>interpreting it but please ask the<br>experts on the break is about uh<br>self-determination ation and and oh no<br>this one is about actually pulling<br>together the threads and having a shared<br>purpose and a shared Vision so bringing<br>together all the different strands and<br>then moving forward<br>together this one um Sam presented<br>yesterday is about you know if I dream I<br>dream alone if we dream as a collective<br>we can achieve our<br>dream so some of them are metaphorical<br>some of them are just straight up<br>straight up advice<br>uh this is uh King thio he had many um T<br>that that have helped guide um our<br>people and these are a couple of them um<br>one that um P sh yesterday as well about<br>if you're a single read you're easy to<br>break but if you bind them all together<br>um you become unbreakable so that<br>strength ands<br>right stop it and then that last one uh<br>is about um you know I shall fashion my<br>own FY so that's about um<br>self-determination and doing it our way<br>um and using the resources that we have<br>at<br>hand so just taking some of those<br>learnings and then applying it to a real<br>life situation I'm going to talk about<br>tuna because that's what what I do um<br>and I might get some of the group where<br>are they've disappeared have<br>they if we come back to it so tuna we're<br>going to talk about tuna and then a tuna<br>project so<br>tuna there is old as Alo itself um we're<br>connected to tuna through Papa um<br>we have obligations and responsibilities<br>as Kaki to protect preserve and care for<br>tuna the importance of tuna for w but<br>all many e all e I'd say uh cannot be<br>underestimated and Fisheries are<br>considered a tus for w they sustain our<br>spiritually<br>so if we think about the current state<br>of tuna they're no longer as abundant as<br>they once were so these ones um had The<br>Misfortune of going through some flood<br>pumps in the low white cutle um longin<br>are considered at risk and Decline and I<br>guess from our perspective that's um<br>that's you know that's not acceptable<br>and many factors have kind of<br>contributed to the state of tuna<br>including over fishing loss of habitat<br>parasites barriers you know climate<br>change the list the list goes<br>on so what happened in our catchment in<br>2021 2022 a lot of the tile managers uh<br>the environmental Managers from across<br>the catchment so not just um one<br>particular part of the catchment they<br>kind of initiated a project where they<br>got together um and came together and so<br>these are the ogs um and so they come<br>from four four of the e and um three<br>hapu at the time it was manari trust<br>board and so the the people that were in<br>this initial group they were either<br>environmental managers so decision<br>makers or governance members as well and<br>this was initiated from them it wasn't a<br>project that someone imposed on them and<br>what Drew them together was the fact<br>that the Turner management was<br>fragmented across across our catchment<br>so there were lots of different<br>activities NE were wanted to do tagging<br>studies Eco would doing um traff and<br>transfer there's lots and lots of<br>different things that everyone had to<br>respond to and I guess they were feeling<br>a little bit ha her about that so they<br>had an initial W to discuss whether or<br>not they wanted to collaborate because<br>it wasn't a given that that they did<br>want to collaborate so they had the<br>first warer but in that first warer they<br>kind of decided that yes because of all<br>the different things that were happening<br>we would come together and that first<br>wer led to so this was during CO as well<br>so it was online it was meant to be in<br>person so the first W led to two other w<br>a site visit um and a strategy session<br>where they kind of developed a<br>strategy oh wait these are the new these<br>so those were the ogs and these are the<br>new the new G's that have have joined in<br>as well and um Aiden's sitting up there<br>and I was I told him to come down and<br>join but he's decided to he might come<br>down for the questions and uh I see<br>Jordan's up there too um and then some<br>of the others weren't able to be here<br>today so our process was we had an<br>initial Wang that I spoke about and then<br>we had uh a strategy session that we<br>held at Kap um where we went through um<br>a number of initiatives or uh<br>aspirations actually was to identify<br>what is it that the collective wanted to<br>do wanted to achieve like if we put tuna<br>at the center of our decision making um<br>what is it that we we collectively<br>wanted to to do to help the tuna<br>because it wasn't about um telling<br>people how to cuz this is the other<br>thing we we didn't want to tell Roo what<br>to do in Roo or W what to do in W it's<br>like if we all come together what are<br>the things that we can do<br>together this is what they came up with<br>um oh so originally there was like about<br>30 different 30 different ideas and<br>things that we should be doing we're<br>like yeah look we probably should just<br>focus on the top four for now because we<br>have limited resources uh what is it<br>that you actually want to do first<br>and so the first thing that they wanted<br>to do uh was to to so there's a trap and<br>transfer program um going on at Kar the<br>river e collectively wanted to I guess<br>come back and take over take over that<br>program that was the number one thing<br>identified so this is C and the Ala tra<br>and transfer program has been been um<br>operating since<br>1992 uh originally there was some um<br>really strong a involvement so H AWA was<br>there Wally Papa I think Harold man they<br>were all part of the original um team<br>that helped set up the Alva traff and<br>transfer program but for the most part<br>um the commercial a industry had been<br>operating uh the program so what it what<br>happens is that the baby ears are caught<br>at the base of the dam and then they<br>transferred into the upper Lakes for<br>hydro lakes and I guess from a<br>commercial perspective it was a it's a<br>it's a form of wild ranching so they<br>could go back and harvest pretty much<br>harvest the tuna so it kept their<br>industry going and when the river AE<br>leaders got together they were kind of<br>like well that doesn't really align um<br>with our aspirations at this time<br>um so when um the permit came up for a<br>renewal for the commercial fishes to<br>continue that Mah they all<br>collectively um opposed the renewal of<br>that pyramid<br>and um then NPI did not renew um that<br>pyramid so it kind of created a space<br>and a gap um luckily luckily we knew<br>some people that that might want to um<br>jump in and do the job so um so the<br>collective we got our Kaki and they're<br>doing that Mahi now but further to that<br>um we wrote Our Own permit we didn't<br>have to go to NPI to get a permit to do<br>this Mahi so through the W River um<br>settlement<br>regulations we were able to write our<br>own permit um and then as that<br>Collective we decided whether tun went<br>um so some did go into the upper<br>catchment most of them did actually in<br>that first year but some also went into<br>other parts of our catchment where um<br>the tuna could get back out to see and<br>spawn so we were put putting them across<br>our whole catchment and they were it was<br>determined by us us collectively<br>us and some of the sites that were<br>selected too they were important<br>significant sites you know like the Mano<br>at the sites chose the sites because<br>they were important to them either<br>historically or whatever the case may be<br>so completely different to how the<br>program had been run<br>previously I do have a video of the<br>process and this is where it could go<br>really<br>is<br>oh<br>good<br>wa<br>for<br>up<br>spe<br>so a little bit glitchy but you get the<br>you get the picture um but yeah so it<br>was a completely different vibe to um<br>how that program had run for the last um<br>30 years um and then I'll just talk<br>about some of the feedback that we had<br>um from the Faro that we're at some of<br>the sites I won't talk about it I just<br>put it up here so by doing it our way um<br>these are just some of the comments you<br>can just read through I'm not even talk<br>we were able to deliver the program in<br>our way<br>um and those T at each of those<br>different sites the releases was led by<br>the Mana so they kind of rolled out how<br>however they wanted to roll out that<br>that practice was up to them and so in<br>some cases it might be two or three<br>people and they might just do a little<br>cut other to another place we turned up<br>to to two schools arrived in a bus and<br>they were like haaker and like loads of<br>different um I guess our practices um at<br>site at location based on their their<br>knowledge and their yeah<br>anyway okay that was another thing uh<br>the h a lot of connections connections<br>between us across the river uh as the<br>team that we're doing the Mahi<br>connections uh to our to the young ones<br>coming through connections to all the<br>different manaa across um across our<br>catchman area and connections to the<br>tuna<br>themselves lots of intergenerational<br>transfer of knowledge uh like like I<br>said earlier there's a bus that rocked<br>up to one of our<br>releases um and these kids they're like<br>looking at um alvas never seen that<br>before they're touching them they're<br>feeling them um so kind of building on<br>some of the messages from yesterday<br>about you have to to to know something<br>uh as to for something is to look after<br>it for the future so this is about um<br>building the next generation of tanif I<br>guess as<br>well um another key point I guess you<br>know Partnerships is really key too<br>although this project is was initially<br>about um reconnecting the river e the<br>river e kind of taking the taking a<br>leading role in terms of what happened<br>to the tuna in their catchment we<br>couldn't do it without our partners as<br>well so uh acknowledging Mercury um<br>well they're all up there Nea um The<br>bioh Heritage science challenge some are<br>funders wtin we also funded um yeah so<br>Partnerships are really important and<br>one of the things we did for our<br>partners is we held a specific release<br>for them to come to and they bought<br>their kids and they were able to kind of<br>have their own um special time with the<br>twi as<br>well now just cutting back to t35 man<br>this project and of itself uh kind of<br>contributes to a lot of the objectives<br>not going to go through them um and also<br>many of the strategies as well so this<br>project is not funded by the W CLE River<br>Authority<br>yet<br>so um because it wasn't driven it it was<br>a it was a Copa driven process where<br>there was no money there was no nothing<br>it was like this is the issue that's<br>going on in our catchment how are we<br>going to respond to that that was what<br>was the driver behind it not<br>Pua but we still need FIA to operate<br>now and then uh I guess cutting back to<br>that original question how can we blah<br>blah that Tim gave me um well first of<br>all recognize that there are other ways<br>of knowing being and<br>doing um understand that indigenous so<br>what Jaden said yesterday as well and<br>many others said too indigenous people<br>are not going anywhere and we know how<br>to collectivize<br>think um and in our own way and based on<br>our knowledge and<br>practices and then when we do do it our<br>way there's some incredible outcomes<br>that don't happen when it's done in a<br>different way right so uh yeah and then<br>this approach here it kind of prioritize<br>collective decision making autonomy<br>self-determination and empowering ewi to<br>manage resources to and apply their M uh<br>and practices in a culturally<br>appropriate<br>manner<br>um I guess another thing um if you<br>wanted to expedite restoration is<br>understand the barriers that also<br>happened some of them got raised<br>yesterday around health and safety um<br>getting resource consents Etc um and<br>another one is having a flexible funding<br>model um that could be something that we<br>could consider too a lot of funding uh<br>have a one-time um call for applications<br>but um t m trust which is another trust<br>that I'm a part of they have a they have<br>two funds one has its annual funding<br>round and there's another fund that<br>stays open year round and once I guess<br>once that's exhausted it's exhausted but<br>it kind of provides that flexibility to<br>be able to um respond to needs as they<br>arise and last but not least um tips for<br>partners when looking um in terms of how<br>to operate or how to work differently um<br>just connect listen collaborate<br>co-create<br>resource and um and Empower and let go<br>you don't have to like um hold the rain<br>so tight let go let Faro do their thing<br>so yeah<br>K morning morning firstly um yeah<br>another round of applause for our for<br>our four presenters this morning thank<br>you<br>I um I need to apologize for being late<br>this morning and missing kakia just<br>after I Dro my boys off to R Cody Kura I<br>get a call from my sister she locked the<br>keys in the car and uh thankfully as a<br>boy growing up in the 80s you have a few<br>essentials in your<br>trunk I had two bottles of water one's<br>for if you go to urupa you just need one<br>the other one was when we used to drive<br>up uh the Bombay and we have to pull<br>over and fill up the<br>radiator um and then I'd have a hammer<br>and a I've got a um a coat hanger<br>due to the skills I acquired over<br>Summers uh with my Moana F we we happen<br>to get in there from about 15 seconds<br>she's my f over there so successful<br>morning I got here just in time um so<br>today we have our International speakers<br>and Alo that have international<br>experience and worked have worked well<br>with other communities as ER has<br>mentioned um we had heard from Stu and<br>just a point from me about when she was<br>talking about policy it's probably going<br>to be more evident now than ever the<br>importance of the to5 for our catchment<br>in the sense that it's going to bring<br>confidence uh and um to the community<br>that um we confidence and certainty to<br>our region that we've got something that<br>that's going to Trump anything that<br>comes out of there so I think that's a<br>great thing and what we've seen over the<br>last 10 years is actually our sector<br>groups talking more about the to5 man<br>than ourselves and that's what we've<br>been trying to change is the mind shift<br>um thank you for that to and our our our<br>brother<br>Brad um or bro Brad that's better than<br>uh what the bum one aspro um it's always<br>a pleasure see him yes he always gets<br>bought over here and he's probably one<br>of the first persons we call um and and<br>it reminds me and I have to read this<br>one and thankfully Ed didn't put this<br>faki up on his slide um from from tfel<br>and it was during the time uh we were<br>probably in the most turbulent times our<br>people were suffering<br>from anxiety deprivation frustration and<br>alienation from our Tong and through his<br>reading of the scriptures and<br>discussions with early missionaries<br>tafel became aware quite quickly that<br>his struggle our people's struggle was<br>said my friends will come from the four<br>end of the world they are the shoe<br>makers the blacksmiths and the<br>Carpenters well today we have different<br>titles we have scientists and we have<br>friends from around the world that come<br>to learn from us but it's also nice to<br>know that you can that someone else is<br>going through something similar you got<br>someone to talk to outside of the<br>country and hopefully offer some advice<br>and we've received plenty of advice and<br>and I really appreciate your cordor<br>about your totem species because it<br>makes us think of our T species that<br>both um Dan and Ed have spoken about<br>so uh Dan I love<br>Ki for me one of the first projects that<br>I worked on and I see some of our Foo<br>Lindon the Faro here um that yeah was in<br>the paper for all the wrong reasons but<br>it's probably came a benchmark uh<br>discussion cuz now when we talk about t<br>far with our friends at wsp and other<br>places they're not they're going oh K<br>where is it where does it stay those are<br>the questions they're asking rather than<br>uh using it or acknowledging it rather<br>than seeing it as a barrier to<br>development so it's um yeah I'd love to<br>track that actually in a bit of research<br>and Ed um we've known each other for a<br>very very long time uh one of my mentors<br>um as we're coming through the tribal<br>work uh wanu and other places um and one<br>thing I really love about Eden and she's<br>very consistent is about what about the<br>way our people want to do it she always<br>challenges us even us as her friends<br>she'll go what do Alano think how do<br>they want to do it and that's what we've<br>seen today and and and you come up with<br>successful stories like that<br>um so great qu it all this morning um<br>our morning teer is ready but we're<br>going to take a few questions so please<br>remember to use slid to send your<br>questions in again if we can't answer<br>them here today because we've run out of<br>time we're going to log them and we'll<br>find some way to respond uh to all of<br>those questions there so I'm G pass you<br>over to<br>Michelle Koto um just a remind well some<br>new information for those of you who<br>weren't here yesterday um on the inside<br>side cover of the program is um a little<br>QR code that you can scan to access<br>slido to put in your<br>questions um so first question uh for<br>Chu or or maybe even Julian uh what risk<br>to t2y Mana do you see with the current<br>government oh so I'll probably I I'll<br>trouble um our our toy man and all the<br>mechanisms that Ed spoke about our B<br>laws Ministry Accords are all all locked<br>in uh the W cutle River settlements and<br>the upper river co-management e<br>Arrangements um you cannot make any<br>changes to the settlement uh without e<br>approval and that's not going to happen<br>so I'm pretty confident there'll be<br>there there'll be some issues around<br>other things like T or areas that impact<br>the catchment but set outside of our<br>settlement legislation but other than<br>that I think I'm confident and I and I<br>hope the council's do do this<br>confidently lean on to to 25 Mana to uh<br>to to continue the work that we've<br>continued up that we've developed<br>already including all of our<br>partners I'd say minimal risk sure so<br>this question is for Bradley uh how can<br>we move forward together in a<br>collaborative way in the future so<br>between indigenous peoples and companies<br>combative uh yeah that's a great<br>question um I think the opportunity to<br>to turn up and speak is<br>always uh and then the conversations<br>that happen after are also important as<br>well so um I'd love to have the<br>opportunity to bring you know some of<br>some of you guys over to to Australia<br>and you know share your story with our<br>people because you know we you know that<br>that saying you know is is we have<br>similar struggles similar fights and you<br>know you guys are potentially a bit<br>ahead of us um in that regard and you<br>know we want to learn rather than act<br>like we own it we at the moment we're<br>it um part knows what you<br>mean um but I think it's yeah the<br>conversations that happen after and I<br>think this this ongoing you know when I<br>keep getting an invite to to this I<br>never say no I<br>it's an absolute honor to be here and to<br>main maintain that relationship and<br>conversation is is especially important<br>I think especially working with<br>companies you know I think in different<br>contexts in Australia and New Zealand<br>and I think um you know we're we're<br>still fighting to have a voice we had a<br>referendum recently that still gave us<br>no voice um and you know we're still<br>living with the no um and we got to just<br>business as usual for us we got to keep<br>fighting and I think the strength that<br>we get from you people over here is is<br>special and I think we just keep doing<br>that<br>yeah uh question for Eda how does water<br>quality affect tuna longevity when<br>releasing back into the hour how do you<br>weigh up poor water quality and<br>reinstating<br>tuna that's a good question um tuna are<br>pretty a pretty hearty species for<br>starters and I guess they already exist<br>um throughout the whole catchment but I<br>maybe not in the uh abundance that they<br>could have existed previously so I think<br>in terms of releasing into our catchment<br>there's a number of factors to take into<br>consideration and um we're comfortable<br>with the decisions that we made I guess<br>not really answering the question but<br>enough I might just just throw a bit in<br>completely supporting what en has said<br>one of the things you find in the<br>literature is there this ecological<br>Keystone indicator species and Tong of<br>species and um Tona is definitely not a<br>keystone ecological indicator species<br>because they're tough buggers as you say<br>so they can withstand pretty pretty<br>tough environments but the key thing in<br>the difference here and that's to your<br>point is that it's a tongo because we<br>have a really strong relationship with<br>it and it's just a kind of a message to<br>some of our ecologists there it's like<br>actually no they're not the same thing<br>yeah and some of the sites that have<br>been chosen by the man are chosen<br>because T were there historically anyway<br>so yeah so just adding that to<br>so this is a slightly related question<br>to that um are Tona release sites mostly<br>into places where Tona can no longer<br>reach because of<br>barriers no they can still oh the ones<br>that go into the upper catchment yes<br>definitely there's eight kind of big<br>Hydro dams that stop stop them from<br>reaching those areas um but the ones<br>into the lower reach so we did 20<br>releases last year four went into the<br>lower catchment there the 16 went into<br>the upper CCH catchment so um and of the<br>four that were in the lower uh reaches<br>those tuna um now have free um access<br>Back to the Sea when when their time<br>comes so<br>yeah uh question for Dan awesome idea of<br>sharing the river's story however<br>scientists use certain terms is it worth<br>using annual exceedence probability<br>I think annual exceedance probability is<br>getting closer to what communities would<br>work with but still would leave manylion<br>people perplexed and kind of scratching<br>their heads<br>um drawing from 's experiments what<br>would our people say what would the<br>community say and just being honest and<br>just saying how often do these things<br>occur when when I speak them about this<br>is how this was calculated you look at<br>how much rain fell in the past year in<br>the past 10 years in the past whatever<br>and then you model how much you'd expect<br>to get on a certain day and so it's just<br>around demystifying what it all came<br>from and then they can come up and tell<br>is one more one more uh will the review<br>of the vision and strategy uh to 25 Mana<br>potentially provide more explicit<br>requirements to ensure the bar is raised<br>and we avoid future 10 plus year<br>processes I'll pull my hand up with that<br>um So currently going through the review<br>the most comprehensive review of to5 and<br>and the the 13 objectives that um edin<br>Anu spoke about uh we've only just<br>completed phases one and two that have<br>identified um some of the spaces that we<br>need to<br>strengthen and<br>um our goal has generally been and the<br>expectation from E and the communities<br>is that what whatever is happening at a<br>national level we're pushing it by at<br>least 10% whether that um and so we're<br>always driving to to set a new platform<br>so um I would say that's that's the<br>expectation yeah C I wasn't that's why<br>there was one more question because it<br>was for me um so we're going to do our<br>presentations to our uh uh speakers here<br>up here if I can ask Eda and Dan to go<br>through first and then uh Brad at the<br>end um one of the most important things<br>about our settlement that we heard from<br>a lot of people was that it had our C in<br>it cuz it wasn't written for the<br>government it was written for us so we<br>used our words and it was really neat<br>that we get to use that so we<br>have the country has and so we used our<br>type of Koo and and and it makes a<br>better relationship for Alano to see<br>themselves in there um just going to ask<br>now Tim Timothy mono a wahi p boy or a p<br>kid as they call<br>them grew up at wahi uh he's like third<br>generation and gathers all the Tona for<br>all the foo and the Pokey he's just sent<br>us a picture about three uh at the why<br>po that his kids were then Gathering<br>their tuna with um his father um and he<br>was environmental manager for a tribe of<br>mentor of mine for many many years and<br>now he is the senior research fellow and<br>manga co-director for the Environmental<br>Research Institute at the University of<br>wak the University of wak are major<br>k<br>the good boomerangs<br>and Shields and<br>things woods and yeah I've just burn in<br>here<br>all right Faro is that getting their<br>photo ready later today we do want to<br>have a group phot photo and I think<br>we're aiming to do that at lunchtime um<br>we'll do that outside the fet uh so just<br>before we allow you to eat we'll um your<br>ticket is their photo uh so we have<br>morning tea now uh we had scheduled to<br>come back at uh 11:15 we'll call you at<br>11:15 and we'll try and get back in here<br>up<br>a slideshow some of the pictures that<br>were taken uh yesterday and I just like<br>to acknowledge our our photographer uh<br>Peter jury for your<br>Mah uh so you'll see him floating around<br>taking pictures as well so hopefully you<br>brush your teeth this morning uh and<br>ready for your uh Colgate smile uh for<br>our proceedings and also to Steve Fisher<br>uh who is uh I got the camera over here<br>I no it's not for the evening news and<br>uh hopefully not for crime watch either<br>profile uh just as we're waiting for to<br>get started I just want to uh once again<br>acknowledge all our efforts for the<br>restoration of the health and well-being<br>of our waterways and um you know for<br>those of you who are new to this area uh<br>behind the chambers you'll see uh the<br>the hills there they're called the hak<br>Mata and the hak Mata gets its name from<br>structures that were built uh back in<br>the day and it's Howa got its name also<br>but uh the structures that were built<br>were uh uh triangular in its uh<br>formation and the Mata were the mats or<br>the uh the face of the of these<br>structures where we hung our food and of<br>course the the hills was where we<br>gathered all our our Birds and the hour<br>is where we scored our fish our trout<br>our white baits our uh tun nut and they<br>will be hang up on the on those<br>structures and uh haki being to feed and<br>the MAA being the mats or the or the<br>face of those structures and that's how<br>hak Mata uh got its name uh our<br>historical narratives also says that the<br>hak mat uh are the uh children<br>P from Dr Tom was the name previously<br>given to P before<br>K across that mountain range he was the<br>uh the T who sought uh her hand in<br>marriage now to used to live in the<br>central Plateau alongside her brother<br>too and it was pong who traveled across<br>to the central Plateau to ask for her<br>hand in marriage and uh gifted to or<br>gave her gave his Blessing should I say<br>for to to marry pong however uh due to<br>some<br>uh male uh genealogy uh somebody started<br>sliding into pong's DMS and he played up<br>and so he uh got caught and she left and<br>she currently resides where she is now<br>and as they do the woman took the<br>children with her and hak mat sit on the<br>behind here and to uh just down the line<br>so little bit of historical narrative<br>for you the condensed version uh just<br>thought I'll throw some dry jokes in<br>there I had a dream the other night of<br>orange o uh safe to say it was a<br>fantasy and uh they reckon<br>uh they reckon the kitchen sink is a lot<br>uh cleaner than the toilet bowl but um<br>there's two reasons why uh you don't<br>drink from the toilet bowl uh number one<br>two okay all right that's enough for me<br>uh we'll get into our next uh kind qued<br>uh C just to our kordor as well when you<br>uh come up and um uh do your<br>presentation we'll ask that you uh I get<br>them up now oh so if we can get our<br>three presenters to come up now and just<br>sit on the seats over here and wait for<br>me to ENT you into come and have your<br>cordal<br>C all right our next speaker is a senior<br>environmental scientists at the United<br>States Environmental Protection Agency<br>uh has researched centers on the<br>condition assessment of streams and<br>rivers and has a special interest in the<br>development of tools that enhance Basin<br>scale management of water sheds from the<br>US Environmental Protection Agency no my<br>hi G and no Mikey Dr Joseph<br>on start my timer so first I'd like to<br>thank um all the tribes of the Wako for<br>hosting this and allowing me to be here<br>it is indeed a great honor and I greatly<br>appreciate it<br>um I'd also like to thank uh Tim Charles<br>Dennis Siobhan and Joshua for their help<br>in facilitating all the details of<br>making it here um there was a lot there<br>was some ups and downs the trip was on<br>off on and off with our budget changes<br>but then back on so I made it um very<br>thankful for that um a little bit about<br>me um the last name Flo merch is<br>actually Germanic not hard to see that<br>but the uh Flow Part has to do with<br>flowing Waters and the merch part has to<br>to do with marshes so the way it was<br>explained to me by Christian who's a<br>friend of ours Christian vter in Germany<br>is that my bloodline comes from people<br>of the marshes on the flowing Waters and<br>I didn't know that till I was way down<br>this path of working on Rivers for my<br>career um I'm from uh the state of<br>Kentucky in the states and I'm guessing<br>most of you all have heard of Kentucky<br>is that<br>true okay now can I is anyone brave<br>enough to say what they know about<br>Kentucky Kentucky Fried Chicken right so<br>you know I'm very proud that the one<br>thing that people know about where I'm<br>from around the world is a fast food<br>it's great so um I'd like to share<br>something else with you about the state<br>of Kentucky um it's actually pronounced<br>K and it comes from um Native Americans<br>and there's if you ever look at a map of<br>where all the tribes are in the country<br>there's there's hundreds of tribes but<br>there's nothing in Kentucky a few spots<br>but nothing is really claimed in<br>Kentucky and it's because it was<br>referred to as the happy hunting grounds<br>and no there was an agreement among<br>tribes not to claim it because it was a<br>shared resource and I think that's a<br>good theme to carry into this<br>presentation um like he said I work for<br>USPA work in the office of research and<br>development and my major responsibility<br>right now in that role in the role that<br>I have is to work on national scale<br>issues uh that Center on condition<br>assessments so what's the condition of<br>this resource that resource um how do we<br>create greater pictures um I've done a<br>lot of research on bioassessment and<br>monitoring and I think some of it was<br>really good but it didn't change<br>anything um it was good science it<br>didn't get the message across um I it's<br>hard to go to a politician in DC and say<br>but there's fewer care Nomads or there's<br>more caroms it means nothing to them and<br>there's also in the country we have a<br>lot of variability we have mountains we<br>have Plains we have deserts and to<br>convey biological information across<br>this variability is difficult and last<br>um to convey it to a broad audience<br>whether it be a politician or children<br>in a school how do we convey the same<br>set of data to this audience and how to<br>where they actually go oh I get it and<br>that's what this presentation today is<br>about is how do we collect information<br>efficiently rapidly in a timely fashion<br>yet be able to explain it to a diverse<br>audience and when I'm talking to<br>students that are making presentations<br>they go I don't know what to say I don't<br>know what to do I said go home and if<br>you can explain it to your mom you can<br>explain it to a politician because they<br>have about the same level of<br>arrows so I I want to start off with<br>with a couple definitions real<br>quick I didn't do it there we go start<br>off with a couple definitions of how<br>we're using the terms we've used the<br>term Watershed catchment and Basin a lot<br>differently I just want to be sure that<br>for this presentation you understand how<br>I'm using them in general Watershed is a<br>spatially explicit landscape that is<br>definable and it contains a range of<br>intera interacting physical ecological<br>and social attributes and those things<br>considered collectively makes it a<br>social ecological system system there's<br>an ecological element and a social<br>element that are both influencing each<br>other and this social eological system<br>provides a range of ecosystem Services<br>valued by society and that's why we<br>impair these systems why we interact<br>with them we're getting something from<br>them um unfortunately a lot of what they<br>get from us is not in their best<br>interest so the ability to provide these<br>Services depends on the degree to which<br>they're impaired by human related<br>activities I think we've had several<br>presentations that's demonstrated that<br>we all get it we don't need to beat it<br>beat a dead horse but what's different<br>is all although we have and I've saw<br>thought I was thinking about Martin when<br>I was making this slide I say at the top<br>the water saids are longit<br>longitudinally connected systems things<br>flow downhill but in River ecology we<br>think about them more as networks but to<br>go into an audience and explain what a<br>network system is as opposed to water<br>running downhill can be difficult so<br>sometimes we have to back on back down<br>on the science to make the connection<br>the problem with longitudinally<br>connected systems is that most of our<br>policy and most of our guid or<br>governance is hierarchial so we have a<br>misalignment of the system designs and H<br>um one of the biggest ways I've seen<br>that works for me to communicate is to<br>remove some of these boundaries so um<br>what I've termed that and what we've we<br>working with is efficient how do we have<br>efficient Bas and scale management it<br>requires efficient trans scale<br>communication management and by trans<br>scale I mean trans scale in education<br>trans scale um between someone's yard<br>their Farm the community the state the<br>nation how do we bridge that so trans<br>scale communication as I've defined it<br>is communication that facilitates<br>understanding thinking collaborative<br>management across political Geographic<br>cultural and conceptual boundaries and<br>all of those have little bitty little<br>differences to different people but it's<br>really reaching different audiences with<br>the same data I can show kids in a<br>school information and take that same<br>data set and explain it to a politician<br>at a different<br>scale so as an example I'm not<br>advocating the index of waterers shed<br>Integrity I love it I've spent years<br>working on it but it's just an example<br>of this concept the index of watershed<br>Integrity is based on the definition<br>that Watershed Integrity is the capacity<br>of a watershed to support and maintain<br>the full range of ecological processes<br>and services provided to society that<br>hits everybody it hits everybody who<br>cares about bugs fish um the habitat the<br>water that they want to go kayaking in<br>but it also speaks to the things that we<br>get whether it be cultural spiritual or<br>resources from the<br>river the the index itself ranges from<br>zero which uh 0 to one with one<br>representing a watershed that is absent<br>of impact so right there you standardize<br>across the entire country if there's no<br>anthropogenic activities or impacts gets<br>a one whether it's in a desert or in the<br>mountains if it's heavily impacted it's<br>a zero you don't have to account for<br>anything<br>else and what we did is we identified<br>key functions of unimpaired watersheds<br>what functions do water sheds have and<br>do they have to have in order to<br>function properly and provide the<br>services that we that we desire from<br>them and last we map and model risk<br>factors shown to interfere with and<br>degrade key functions so what's<br>different about this we're not looking<br>at going out actually measuring the<br>physical habitat we're not measuring the<br>bugs we're measuring things that we know<br>impact those and that seems like it's a<br>little bit hard of a concept to grasp a<br>hold of and this is another key thing<br>that I think is important for<br>communicating across scales of people is<br>the use of analogies and I'll show you<br>how I use an analogy here I see the<br>index of watershed Integrity very<br>similar to human health we have in the<br>center we have the river but we also<br>have all these different systems that's<br>that contribute to the well-being of the<br>body and if we look specifically at the<br>circulatory system what when you go to<br>the doctor and he says oh your blood<br>pressure is up know you ask about how<br>much do you exercise you know how's your<br>weight you know family history does your<br>dad have heart problems does your mom<br>have heart problems and what do you eat<br>are you eating at McDonald's or KFC or<br>uh are you fixing your own fruits and<br>vegetables at home so these are risk<br>factors that science a lot of the<br>science that we do we know the<br>relationship we already know it we don't<br>have if we know that we're eating bad<br>we're not exercising all these things we<br>know we're probably not going to feel<br>very good and we're not going to be<br>good in the same way if we look at<br>Watershed Integrity a group of us<br>identified a list of functions that are<br>inherent to Rivers hydrologic regulation<br>sediment regulation which we heard a lot<br>about yesterday temperature regulation<br>no trees the water heats up that<br>temperature carries Downstream<br>regulation of water chemistry<br>hydrologic connectivity are the rivers<br>still connected to their wetlands and<br>habitat<br>provisioning so if we look just at<br>habitat provisioning I'm going to focus<br>in on that one because it's one of the<br>simpler<br>functions you know in the same way we<br>had functions for the circulatory system<br>or risk factors if we look at physical<br>activity obesity family history and diet<br>what would be the risk factors for<br>physical habitat and this model looks<br>very complicated but I'm going to<br>simplify it real quick we have a model<br>and if we look simply at habitat<br>provisioning and then we look at the<br>typical alterations that impact these<br>systems it's things like changes in the<br>habitat degradation of the habitat<br>that's there fragmentation and just<br>absolute loss so if we look at what<br>human<br>activities that impact those what caused<br>those it's impervious Services where we<br>we reduce the uh habitat itself<br>agricultural activities um repairing<br>habitat condition um the removal of<br>repairing habitat dams<br>dams we've talked about how that<br>affected the tuna and streams and Road<br>Crossings these are things that we know<br>if we have those in the Watershed<br>they're risk factors for degrading the<br>habitat and we went through and we<br>created a list for all the six functions<br>of things that we know from science that<br>we spent years and years studying with<br>graduate students studying that these<br>things affect it and one of the things I<br>want to point out here is before we did<br>this we didn't look at the availability<br>of the data the ones that are dark are<br>things that turned out to be things that<br>we had national scale coverages of the<br>things that are light gray those are<br>things that we think would be ideal to<br>have but we don't which we call graduate<br>student activities so so these are<br>things we came up with we've done this<br>in other parts of the world and we use<br>whatever data they have so it's not it's<br>like you have to have this data it's<br>like what do you got what can we use it<br>for what are the risk factors in your<br>land and then we use that to create<br>index value if we look at habitat we see<br>the surface area of the reservoirs if we<br>create dams and we have big reservoirs<br>that's negative to the well-being of the<br>wed it may provide some services but as<br>far as overall Watershed Integrity it's<br>a<br>negative um and we have some other ones<br>here and you also see across the top<br>surface area of the reservoir is in all<br>these categories so something is not in<br>just one category it can affect multiple<br>systems just like eating bad can affect<br>a lot of your different systems so this<br>simple slide but for good purpose<br>analogy number two we have a catchment<br>we heard a lot of people use the term<br>catchment yesterday this could be<br>someone's Farm it's a scale that a<br>farmer a land owner um a park a<br>government might understand if we look<br>at that one little section of river a<br>lot of people refer to that as a stream<br>reach you it's like what's this you<br>here's the stream that runs through this<br>piece of property when I'm talking to<br>children I of to refer to that and use<br>the analogy of it being like a person<br>that person is influenced by what's on<br>the left and right of it it's influenced<br>by its nearby community its surroundings<br>but it's also<br>influenced by what what came before it<br>and what's where did it come from what<br>is coming to it so it's it's not just if<br>we just simply look at the catchment we<br>get part of the story if we know about<br>about what came<br>before we know more about it and we know<br>how if something's wrong with that<br>catchment if the Upstream Watershed is<br>there to support it like a family and we<br>also know that all these things run<br>downhill and affect everything p as that<br>um so we I showed you a catchment and a<br>watershed but for different scales<br>governments we have different watersheds<br>in this picture we have the Missouri<br>Basin that's a watershed for a<br>particular question the oh Ohio River<br>Basin another<br>Watershed that happens to be where I<br>live in the Ohio River Basin this is<br>also a watershed but these for a<br>particular question may be the Watershed<br>and the poor point at the bottom is the<br>catchment so 2.7 million catchments in<br>the United States that's the index of<br>watershed we figured out how to do it<br>for one catchment we could do it for the<br>whole country as long as the coverage is<br>available so I can take this to a<br>politician he goes what are the big<br>problems we summed up all these<br>functions we get a number for the whole<br>country he goes what about my state so<br>we can zoom in on his state or he goes<br>well I'm I'm on this committee because<br>we had these indices were generated by<br>these different risk factors we can<br>break apart and just look at one<br>function and say what are the big<br>problems in the United States you can<br>see or where are they we can see it we<br>can break it<br>apart um again I'll go back to this<br>diagram we have the reach the catchment<br>and the Watershed and I showed you how<br>we calculate the index of watershed<br>Integrity we take the catchment and<br>everything above it and it tells us<br>about that health of that Watershed from<br>that catchment up we can also just look<br>at the catchment health the<br>individual and that's called the index<br>of catchment Integrity so the ICI the<br>index of waters set Integrity looks at<br>that person you're talking to just that<br>person and when you look at the<br>Watershed The Watershed is the person in<br>the community the index of catchment is<br>just the<br>person and I'll throw a couple more<br>examples up and I've got 30 seconds geez<br>this is the uh index of watered<br>Integrity we did for a part uh the Matsu<br>Bas in Alaska we did the ICI in the<br>index of watershed Integrity as you<br>would imagine most of the of most of the<br>space and scores very good but we can<br>zoom in on the area of<br>problem and we see that the major<br>problems big surprise sediment and also<br>temperature and habitat provision we<br>then worked with the local organizations<br>to focus on those things and we all<br>could also focus on um what activities<br>would have the biggest impact if you fix<br>a catchment at the very bottom of the<br>Basin it affects that Basin I mean it<br>affects that catchment only do you<br>change something at the top it comes<br>downhill you know it has to start at the<br>top so again index of catchment<br>Integrity index of wi shed Integrity two<br>different measurements you know how can<br>we use those together another this<br>example is from the Pacific Northwest<br>Washington Oregon area so like I said we<br>can have a catchment that's in poor<br>shape if everything above it is in bad<br>shape you can do all the restoration you<br>want it's still going to be impaired if<br>the Watershed above it is in good<br>condition then your restoration efforts<br>at that catchment are likely going to<br>take hold so in this in this study they<br>had a whole Suite of a couple hundred<br>sites we looked at the index of water<br>shed Integrity the index of of catchment<br>Integrity the upper right hand corner<br>where the ICI and I iwi are good those<br>are great sites to protect if you look<br>at this what sites would be the best<br>ones to to restore it'd be one the ones<br>that had low ICI and a high index of<br>watershed Integrity because that<br>Community above that catchment was there<br>to support that restoration and then you<br>have the other two categories which are<br>different management strategies so the<br>take-home messages are the people you're<br>communicating with often have a<br>perspective that matches their area of<br>responsibility it's just like when you<br>have a company that wants to buy a hunk<br>of land and somebody says but my<br>family's been on this land for three<br>generations they go but look how good it<br>is for the whole state or the whole<br>country be aware that people have<br>different areas of areas of concern and<br>different perspectives your perception<br>like a as a scientist may be bound by<br>the issue or in a Bound in a similar way<br>as theirs other perception of an issue<br>may not be trans scale or transboundary<br>they may be bound by something totally<br>different than what science uses and<br>last trans scale Communications help all<br>involved perceive the issue in an actual<br>scale of the issue in a way that helps<br>the collective conceive and develop<br>realistic Solutions and I think we've<br>heard that repeatedly through talks and<br>I'll close with one last slide<br>which I don't know why but it resonates<br>with<br>people sure glad the hole is in not in<br>my end of the boat when it comes to a<br>watershed we're all on the same boat and<br>we have to communicate we have to talk<br>or you know what happens in this picture<br>and uh I appreciate the opportunity<br>have did aqu well thank you thank you uh<br>for your presentation and uh one thing<br>that amazes me about uh America I'm<br>going right left of center here is that<br>why do aliens only go to America like<br>every movie that I see the the aliens<br>always turn up to America for some<br>reason I don't know why it's like when I<br>watch movies about haunted houses and<br>you fellas run upstairs it's like we're<br>sitting there at home going cuss don't<br>go upstairs there's no there's no way<br>getting out of there okay stay out when<br>we go to a haunted house if it's haunted<br>there's two things that we do either we<br>move we get out of there or we call a<br>TOA to come and do K<br>here so you can take some learnings from<br>that when you when you go back and talk<br>to your friends uh also uh a lot of<br>people don't know this but we were the<br>first to discover America before<br>Christopher Columbus uh that's how we<br>got over there got the K and then we<br>brought it back and we probably met some<br>aliens were over there that's why we<br>didn't stay there it was like nope get<br>the hide out Carl all moving on okay uh<br>our next speaker uh is the is the<br>director and a professor in the<br>Australian Rivers Institute uh Griffith<br>University brisban uh he was previously<br>back in 2002 and 2017 and Sciences at<br>the University of wle uh we held the<br>inaugural Bay of Plenty Regional Council<br>chair and Lake restoration he has<br>published more than 300 papers on<br>various topics ranging from Lake<br>management catchman science sensor<br>monitoring and environmental modeling p<br>p from the Australian Rivers Institute<br>David Hamilton<br>T um I thought about the 300 papers and<br>it gave me something to think about<br>because there were probably a few trees<br>at least in the early days that were cut<br>down for those 300 papers and I think of<br>someone like Shannon touya and uh<br>700,000<br>trees wow you know that is<br>something um so I'd also like to thank<br>um and I don't think I've got everybody<br>here but it was Charles uh Sherman and<br>um and Tim and I know that I missed one<br>not sure who it was but uh anyway thank<br>you to all of you k for bringing us<br>together um it's been an amazing for me<br>an amazing experience coming back from<br>six or seven years ago um Co<br>um David Hamilton Taco WIA<br>P too<br>manga<br>K<br>tiwa can I um acknowledge uh the the ewi<br>of the headquarters from T party TOA Tia<br>Roa<br>nanii and in fact all River e um it's a<br>it's a my privilege to be here thank you<br>um I actually live in and work in<br>Brisbane now it's the home of the<br>terrible people um of<br>me um yeah it it sounds like ter<br>terrible it's terrible uh we have a<br>slight change of of accent on that uh<br>terrible and um the terrible people uh<br>of mean and Brisbane they were the first<br>First Nations people the first First<br>Nations people of that area for many<br>thousands of years um until the 1860s<br>the 1860s they were down to 50 people<br>they headed to the Sunshine<br>Coast uh they rode out the storm and<br>then they came back to to the river uh<br>after that and uh it's quite a story and<br>one that uh even a lot of people in<br>about so with with that I'd like to<br>acknowledge their Elders past and<br>present and extend that to all<br>Aboriginal and and indeed all indigenous<br>peoples um what I'm going to be talking<br>about today is a project that we've been<br>working on you just heard the word<br>catchment so I'm I'm not going to repeat<br>that and I'm going to really fly through<br>things pretty<br>fast um and this was something that<br>we've been working on in the catchment<br>in in uh just out of Brisbane and this<br>one actually drains into um some of our<br>drinking water uh and it's a very<br>productive catchment produces about 30%<br>of the vegetables that is uh are<br>actually consumed in in Brisbane it's<br>called the ladly catchment and you can<br>see um just after all the uh people got<br>their diggers out um to straighten the<br>river after the floods in<br>2011 and actually just what I remember<br>and just before I I um head on to the<br>next slide I just wanted to say one<br>thing that's just been nagging me a<br>little bit and that is the national<br>policy statement for freshwater<br>management you've all heard about it um<br>it's and I've heard some stories that<br>things that that might be pulled down or<br>it might be different I spent a lot of<br>time on that personally um it's not<br>perfect um and it but it does include a<br>lot of good elements to it it's one of<br>the first structures that was able to<br>deal with poll diffused pollution it<br>includes Tano um please don't change it<br>better um you people are demonstrating a<br>wave of global restoration but in fact I<br>reckon you're a a long way ahead um this<br>the wave here in Al New Zealand is quite<br>a long way ahead of many other parts of<br>the world you were going to be the<br>exemplars and I've had a lot of<br>colleagues around the world actually<br>talking about uh fui um the personhood<br>statement status there you know all<br>things may not work but most things will<br>and uh keep it up that's all I can say<br>so as I said I'm going to fly through<br>this we're really concerned about some<br>of the things that are going on the<br>slide in the bottom in the middle bottom<br>uh is Morton Bay that's a ramar<br>international site of inter<br>International<br>significance um the dongs out there the<br>whales come and migrate through it and<br>that's what it looked like after the<br>2022 floods just in the Nearshore<br>region pretty obvious that what happens<br>Upstream also occurs<br>Downstream that 2022 flood trapped me<br>for 5 days and uh obviously I couldn't<br>get back to<br>Brisbane but more<br>importantly uh there are long-term<br>repercussions of this and when you see<br>this sort of thing happening in the uh<br>and this is quite a long way up the<br>catchment<br>um this was the event which uh in that<br>catchment took about 200,000 tons of<br>sediment uh out and into the coastal<br>region and if I just flick back to some<br>of<br>the some of the people or some of the<br>organizations that supported this you'd<br>have to ask why would the port of<br>Brisbane support a project like ours<br>well it's because every time there's a<br>flood there's a massive amount of of<br>sediment and they have to dredge the<br>port pretty obvious why did the<br>wastewater treatment plant operators<br>support us also because they were up<br>against the limits of how good how much<br>more treatment they can do and they look<br>up into the catchment and say well you<br>know I think we might be able to do<br>something up in the catchment and<br>they're talking about a million dollars<br>per kilometer for the restoration but<br>that's what they invested to do about 3<br>restoration and when it works it works<br>those massive floods actually protected<br>some of the Farmland um that you can see<br>here um really amazing they've really<br>got it down to a tea in some of these<br>areas about how they're able to to build<br>resilient restoration programs so we<br>understand the problem well the problem<br>is obviously the the the sediment<br>erosion the nutrients it brings down<br>catchments in poor condition are not<br>resilient they won't withstand the<br>ravages of climate change that are going<br>to occur into the future so we decided<br>to build a tool that would' be able to<br>assist and it's not to assist the people<br>that are already doing things it's to<br>assist to get that overview and say okay<br>if you're going to invest some more<br>where's the where are the best places to<br>put it we need targeted investment and<br>this is a one of the catchments in the<br>Southeast Queensland region the Logan<br>Albert the red areas are where the<br>erosion occurs<br>the yellow areas were where most of the<br>restoration programs occurred with<br>willing<br>Farmers so you can see those little<br>yellow dots and unfortunately they're<br>not connected where most of the erosion<br>is actually occurring in that catchment<br>so we want to be targeted we want to get<br>value for<br>money slow the rate of flow reduce<br>erosion trap and transform nutrients and<br>other pollutants imp improve catchment<br>resilience and theform main target areas<br>that we're looking at here ripan and<br>Riverbank um<br>Rehabilitation riparian area is pretty<br>obvious Hills slope revation going right<br>up into the headwaters Gully remediation<br>you've all seen um the photos over the<br>past couple of days of gullies and also<br>being able to reconnect and create new<br>Wetlands key<br>challenges which actions we're abouts<br>optimize the investment for multiple<br>outcomes multiple outcomes being the<br>nutrients the sediment the biodiversity<br>you even get carbon credits when you do<br>this and you'd like to be able to put<br>those together into a bundle and say<br>it's a pretty good<br>outcome reduce the flood impact improve<br>water quality improve stream Health<br>carbon<br>sequestration so we were working on<br>developing up something that could<br>interface with uh more widely with the<br>community here's the catchment that we<br>tested upper part is like a sponge in a<br>way and um not in great condition but<br>sort of okay condition a lot that could<br>still be done up there to be able to to<br>reduce um some of the some of but here<br>here you see as you go further<br>down the the stream Banks a lack of<br>ripan vegetation it just can't deal with<br>the the flow velocities that are<br>occurring you're losing massive amounts<br>of of Farmland productive Farmland<br>that's that that's occurring along the<br>stream Banks whether or not it should be<br>there in the first place is arguable but<br>um it is what it is and without that rip<br>perion vegetation to about 60% coverage<br>then you're really going to be<br>struggling to um to deal with some of<br>the the erosion that's occurring um<br>through through the through the stream<br>and of course as it goes further down<br>stream the velocities increase the<br>potential for human impacts in terms of<br>of the um the storm that then starts to<br>inundate um inundate urban areas uh<br>further<br>Downstream and I just wanted to go a<br>there<br>sorry we'll leave it there um but I<br>wanted to show you all the flattened<br>trees that uh were down in the bottom of<br>the of the catchment where the velocity<br>did did<br>increase so we thought we'd design<br>something and all right it's pretty<br>looks pretty complicated but basically<br>it takes a lot of the data that's<br>already there with the regional councils<br>with many um local and Regional councils<br>it's what we call geospatial data and<br>that geospatial data is basically<br>information on the slope um the soil<br>type the vegetation and so on you feed<br>it into this model as I said models just<br>like policies are not perfect but<br>they're there to help you and assist you<br>with decision- making um the model's<br>pretty standard but it does use what we<br>call an optimization process that<br>optimization involved I was thinking<br>about it actually as I was thinking<br>about the talk last night in bed a<br>million trillion um possible solutions<br>where you can go up into that catchment<br>and Implement your actions um and we<br>narrow those down to just a few thousand<br>the beauty of a few thousand actually is<br>some people may not like a particular<br>solution or a particular strategy you<br>put in front of them but they might<br>choose another that's actually quite<br>good one might minimize cost one might<br>minimize the nitrogen um and it's what<br>we call multiobjective simulated analing<br>and so don't worry about the<br>complexities um the essence of it is<br>it's trying to use our best biophysical<br>knowledge to be able to complement the<br>other other knowledge streams that we<br>might have to design<br>Solutions um and this part you'll be<br>able to relate to for example if you<br>take your uh go to the garage and<br>there'll be a guy there that says I can<br>do it fast and cheap but you know it<br>ain't any good and then there'll be<br>someone else that will say um I'll build<br>you a house and it's going to cost you<br>like Grand designs um New Zealand um<br>it's going to cost you a lot of money<br>and it's going to be slow um and it's<br>but one thing it's going to be good so<br>you can't get them all usually um and<br>somewhere you're looking at a spectrum<br>of different solutions that's what we're<br>basically<br>designing so um just to give you an<br>example uh we looked at a couple of<br>things designing um what are the<br>tradeoffs um there's always trade-offs<br>and we looked at that between the<br>implementation costs and the opportunity<br>costs um we looked at what would happen<br>if you had $20 million to put into the<br>catchment where would be the best places<br>to be able to implement that so as I<br>mentioned we um put that into we used<br>all this geospatial information that<br>you've been seeing over the last few<br>days ground cover rainfall slope<br>Etc and we design a set of solutions<br>using that model and as I said there's<br>no one solution there are there's there<br>are multiple different solutions and so<br>that catchment represented by the whole<br>Yellow Part what we're showing is the<br>subcatchments often about Farm scale<br>where you need to implement actions and<br>so some of those will be okay $20<br>million what are we going to do um some<br>of them will be geared around um uh best<br>sort of value for money some of them<br>will be focusing on nitrogen some of<br>them will be focusing on<br>sediment and so all those pixel pixels<br>there are where um the blue spots are<br>actions there's just another example um<br>and again it's about this restoration<br>based around tradeoffs to to inform<br>decisionmaking um and we put in a<br>dashboard to B basically be able to help<br>people jump between those options pretty<br>quickly so remember the million no<br>billion trillion different options<br>options um well this is narrowing down<br>to now 13,000 of the socaled optimized<br>Solutions and you can see the dark areas<br>are where 100% of the time you need to<br>go in and address that particular area<br>whether it's River Bank restoration Hill<br>slope restoration or Gully restoration<br>those dark areas are where and Wetland<br>establishment those dark areas are where<br>it has to happen um to be able to<br>optimize uh or educe the amount of<br>sediment the amount of nitrogen and<br>where you can do it at best cost this is<br>a little bit different from just<br>targeting the area it's actually saying<br>what's the best value for money where<br>you can do<br>it we we worked with the computer gaming<br>people and we put these as scenarios so<br>that you can put on the goggles this is<br>an area of a gully and this is what it<br>looks like in 25 years time uh if you've<br>revegetated it so you can zoom in at um<br>and walk the catchment if you like walk<br>the whole catchment if you ever if you<br>didn't get um<br>caric and I'm serious there because you<br>only some people can only put these on<br>for about two two minutes and then<br>they're they're gone um and we choose<br>different scenarios okay so again you<br>can zoom out um you can zoom in you can<br>look at those potential different<br>options um using this gaming software to<br>be able to assist you um and it's a<br>little bit like flying with Google<br>except in this case you've got control<br>to be able to zoom um in and out it was<br>an expensive process working with the<br>gamers um taught us a bit but um yeah it<br>it was it was good fun in the end so<br>acknowledgements um these are some of<br>the people I I work with and uh yeah<br>I'll look forward to<br>uh any questions later on<br>uh thank<br>you<br>David C that's why I bought that<br>PlayStation uh when I got my uh my<br>scholarship I was I was ahead of my time<br>finally yeah that's why I got me a<br>PlayStation when I got my education<br>scholarship cuz I knew that one day<br>gaming will be part of the industry C uh<br>13,000 and trillion ideas that's awesome<br>and um you know uh I'll just Pi up your<br>point as well if you can explain it to<br>your mother then uh I can't explain<br>anything to my<br>mother I don't know if it's it's<br>probably me but it's like I'm an in- and<br>outer guy right I'm an In-N-Out guy when<br>I goes to shopping but when I'm with my<br>mother far out uh we go to countdown<br>like I know what I'm going to get the<br>food are in the same aisle every time<br>you go in there but for some reason we<br>go all the way around back and forth and<br>all the way just to get to that same<br>spot again and get that same food it's<br>like going to McDonald's sometimes with<br>my mom we'll be in the Drive-Thru<br>there'd be like five cars ahead of us we<br>get to the get to the thing like can I<br>take your order your mom what you want<br>she's like ah she's looking at the menu<br>I'm going F it's the same menu as<br>yesterday tell you mean my sister's the<br>anyway okay all right moving on to our<br>now he is a professor of river science<br>and the chair of the physical geography<br>at the University of New England<br>Australia as an<br>uh as an uh interdisciplinary River<br>scientist he applies Cutting Edge<br>research and thinking to further uh our<br>understanding and management of riverine<br>riverine Landscapes as social ecological<br>uh system systems uh he is regional<br>editor for the international Journal<br>River research and applications home the<br>paky py from the University of New<br>Thomas thank you very much for that<br>introduction and also I'd like to Echo<br>my thanks to uh Charlie and Dave<br>particularly shabor you're a a lovely<br>individual for putting up with me and I<br>really do hope that those current<br>kaas were a payback for all the work<br>that you did for us getting us here<br>um I don't know where to start because<br>we had a great session yesterday and we<br>had a great load of um talks this<br>morning and I'm going to have I'm going<br>to follow that and Dan hooker kurus says<br>just be like a bike rider you're hiding<br>in the strip sing and you're riding and<br>then you're slingshot in front of my<br>poor little legs are riding like buggery<br>at the moment and I'm I'm out the back<br>of the pack mate I'm all on me own I<br>there's no bloody slingshots<br>here but um in all seriousness uh um my<br>name is Martin Toms I'm from the<br>University of New England uh and it's<br>custom in Australia to acknowledge the<br>traditional custodians the lands of<br>which we sit and I pay my respects to<br>Elders both past present and emerging<br>and thank you very much for having me in<br>this magnificent Road<br>so um then comes to the difficult part I<br>actually asked Dennis um what do you<br>want me to say and he goes talk about<br>your research and stuff like or tell you<br>something about you're really interested<br>in don't let this Australian accent mate<br>fool you I'm from South Canterbury I<br>still wear a bloody old black uh scarf<br>every 3 weeks I get asked in<br>Australia are you in New Zealand or<br>something and I go is that an<br>option sorry I'm an alien yeah I do work<br>at the US so yes um so what am I meant<br>to talk about so you know uh let me see<br>if I this works um this is some of the<br>territory that I work in I work in<br>central Australia on some of the big<br>large river systems out there and this<br>is the um the this is the largest Creek<br>in the world this is Cooper Creek and it<br>has a catchment area of nearly a million<br>square kmers that's a big bloody Creek<br>okay unfortunately I'm not going to talk<br>about this tonight this afternoon I'm<br>going to talk about something else so<br>what I thought I'd do is give you not<br>baffle you with some science I'm going<br>to give you a series of points to think<br>about and Ponder because Who Am I to<br>tell you um how you're doing with<br>restoration because it's pretty obvious<br>that you're doing a bloody good job so<br>what I would like to do in the next 15<br>or 20 minutes is just say hey you ever<br>thought about this or have you ever<br>thought about that it might be useful so<br>the first thing it's pretty obvious<br>large rivers are not just simply large<br>streams pretty obvious but interesting<br>thing is that when I go around the<br>world a lot of River Management of large<br>rivers still treat them as large<br>strength there is an issue and that is<br>scale is<br>important hey if I was going to pop<br>right against neala me okay he's got<br>scale on his side okay it's not just the<br>weight but also the bigger you are okay<br>in<br>ecosystems the more complexity you get<br>the more complex you have that is the<br>more bits and pieces of different things<br>this is a complex environment when I<br>look around all the ewe names on here<br>this is really complex and I'm really<br>undering how the hell do you manage that<br>cuz complexity as you know okay you<br>think it's difficult dealing with a lot<br>of people you try dealing with big large<br>rivers it's complex that has<br>implications for what I call C an effect<br>okay what actually causes our River to<br>erod and David gave us some magnificent<br>slides on there and the other one is how<br>do we actually um attribute that cause<br>okay to what's happening is it<br>natural cuz Rivers change and change<br>naturally huh okay so we've got to look<br>at cause and effect so size does<br>matter the second thing I want to look<br>look at is that we're talking about<br>large river ecosystems in the anthropos<br>scine what the hell was that okay the<br>anthropos scene is now the new Epoch<br>where humans dominate the environment<br>dominate processes they dominate<br>structures<br>interactions and so how do you actually<br>look at that okay I'm going to introduce<br>the thing called resilience David talked<br>about it and a a lot of people throw<br>this word around resilience let's unpack<br>that let's see how we can actually use<br>it and because if you think about<br>resilience and res use resilience<br>thinking what resilience thinking says<br>that we can't restore<br>back sorry bro you can't go back to<br>where you<br>were you've got to start thinking about<br>where you want to be not going<br>back so that has implications then for<br>how we study larger of ecosystems and<br>how we manage them but also how we<br>monitor what we do with<br>them okay so let's take the first one<br>and this is just a bit of a a geography<br>lesson and that is large rivers are not<br>large streams and the traditional model<br>of river ecosystems suggests that they<br>started their headwaters and they go<br>down to the the sea yeah but as they do<br>they change and change in a very<br>predictable<br>way okay they are what we call clinal<br>systems and so they're very<br>predictable okay but a lot of our work<br>would suggest that<br>not if you increase scale and what I've<br>got here okay I'll fall over the chairs<br>is this is a the catchment of the mry<br>darling system<br>in Australia it has a catch material a<br>watershed or a basin of over a million<br>square kilm those lines I've got up<br>there are the river Network the rivers<br>the channels the streams in the mar<br>darling at a particular scale the<br>different colors represent what I call<br>different functional process zones that<br>are different types of rivers<br>and if you look at the pattern of those<br>colors they don't change in an orderly<br>manner as you go from the head orders<br>all the way down to the Sea some of them<br>repeat themselves some of them are<br>really rare some of them are quite<br>common so what we actually have is a<br>series of functional process zones and<br>the<br>organization of those functional process<br>zones some might say it's a bit like you<br>know a Mad Dog's breakfast really they<br>res represent a mosaic it's quite<br>spatially complex okay now each<br>functional process Zone has its own set<br>of unique features we can derive this by<br>a whole set of um really neat GIS tools<br>using all the spatial data that you have<br>available like quite easily to look at<br>and we've been looking at these things<br>for quite some time the interesting<br>thing is that oops each fpz or<br>functional process<br>Zone has it's it's distinct they are<br>because I love stats they are<br>statistically different in terms of<br>their physical character that is the<br>assemblages of habitat they're also<br>different in terms of biota fish bugs<br>and what have you also riparium<br>vegetation EOS system function I like<br>playing around with food webs that is<br>who eats what and where okay they're<br>also different in terms of ecosystem<br>services and Joe's been talking about<br>that and some of his talk but the in<br>other thing is they're also different in<br>terms of what I call their response<br>trajectory so if you disturb<br>somebody their pattern after being<br>disturbed is what I call a response<br>trajectory you know everybody when<br>they've had a good old well in in the<br>pub night they wander back to their car<br>differently that is a response<br>trajectory okay you disturb and oh there<br>we go some fall over some waddle some<br>walk backwards some Hold the Wall okay<br>restoration is a<br>disturbance I have not put a value on<br>disturbance but restoration by doing an<br>active<br>act an active participation of changing<br>the river where it be the riparian zone<br>or the river Channel or what have you by<br>planting trees is a<br>disturbance so the way each fpz responds<br>to disturbance or<br>responds to Restoration will<br>differ okay let me give you some<br>examples okay here is um I know this is<br>a little bit busy but let me take you<br>through it these are four functional<br>process zones along the backa rther<br>where Brad mudbridge<br>resides the blue the blue columns are<br>what we call Channel heterogenity that<br>is the complexity of<br>habitats the greater the number the more<br>types of habitats that are there the<br>more complex that are there the more<br>habitats the more biota are going to be<br>there okay the more bits that you have<br>the more resilient you<br>are<br>okay the green line okay green bar is<br>what we call the trophic space and this<br>is the niche the trophic Niche space the<br>niche space is essentially where<br>organisms do their stuff we all have a<br>niche some smaller than others some it's<br>just one B Store and a pub others they<br>go right round the whole public room<br>okay so the larger the niche space okay<br>the more able you are to absorb a<br>disturbance so the green is the natural<br>interesting thing is that if you look at<br>the the the height of the green and<br>comparing to the height of the blue<br>there seems to be a relationship ship<br>between the heterogenity of I'm allowed<br>I'm a scientist so I'm allowed to use my<br>language I've been listening to a lot of<br>interesting words over the last couple<br>of days just bear with me with<br>heterogenity he<br>bro okay so what we actually see is a<br>very good association between the<br>assemblages of habitats the heterogenity<br>and the trophic Nick<br>space the more resilient food webs the<br>functioning are associated with high<br>heterogenity then in the bker what we<br>did is we built a lot of large dams we<br>sucked a lot of water out okay we say<br>that the Barker is dying by the death of<br>a thousand sucks okay so the Brown Line<br>the dark brown line okay is the niche<br>space after water<br>development after we built dams we put<br>in over a th000 pumps drag the water out<br>change the hydrology TR quite<br>dramatically and what we actually see is<br>that there is a reduction you can all<br>see a reduction in the trophic Nick<br>space because of the disturbance of<br>water<br>development the paby the baby boo the<br>baby poo<br>brown okay is the niche space after 20<br>years of river<br>restoration that restoration is terms of<br>water water BuyBacks conscious<br>allocating water to the environment you<br>would have thought oh the W the river<br>would have bounced back hey<br>no it did<br>not it cost a lot of<br>money invested in buying water okay<br>because they think water is the only<br>thing that's important but we didn't but<br>in one occasion we had a little bounce<br>back up here but that's a associated<br>with that functional process Zone that<br>had high<br>heterogenity okay so there is a<br>relationship there um the next slide I<br>actually threw in for Brad mrid my my<br>Countryman but he's not hear the bugger<br>okay so here is the functional process<br>zones for 10 catchments in the Kimberly<br>in Northwest Australia this is a quite a<br>pristine part of<br>of Australia the reason why I put up<br>this one up is<br>because the cultural heritage<br>values vary between the functional<br>processes we've been working with<br>Aboriginal ranges in this part of the<br>country and what we actually see is that<br>aborigin use different functional<br>process zones for different activities<br>different resources<br>and also we've worked with some<br>archaeologists and the way that the<br>aboriginals entered Australia was<br>actually through these river systems we<br>can actually Trace their Journey the<br>interesting thing is they actually went<br>up some rivers with some functional<br>process zones and not others why because<br>some of those functional process zones<br>wren<br>okay let's go back to the Murray darling<br>if you look at this Rhythm network with<br>all these functional process zones okay<br>what we see is that we've got four<br>abundant if you look at the network as a<br>whole we've essentially got four very<br>very abundant fpzs 1 3 4 and nine okay<br>but then we've got a bunch of rear ones<br>now remember each fpz has a different<br>set of biota<br>inher um Heritage<br>issues the ability to bounce<br>back okay these are<br>rare let me just stop for a minute<br>Richie mcco was a very rare<br>person what happens if we ignored that<br>rareness we wouldn't have won two World<br>Cups okay we'll be sitting in the<br>doldrums and we'll be calling for Eddie<br>okay so the thing here that I'm getting<br>at and I'm guess I'm echoing Joe and<br>David is that scale<br>matters we can't just look at our own<br>little bit a riverbank we need to know<br>where our own little Riverbank is within<br>the network of the streams and channels<br>and the catchment really important we've<br>got to make a decision do we actually<br>tackle the rare ones or not some of the<br>really neat work that's been doing with<br>the sediment transport stuff and Dave's<br>captur um resilience stuff here is<br>another way of actually prioritizing<br>where we invest money do we<br>want to retain our richy m in that<br>rareness of<br>fpzs okay I've got to move pretty<br>quickly so what are the implications<br>we're actually dealing with um very<br>complex landscapes<br>they're not uniform they don't behave<br>the way that we thought they would do<br>okay we have a series of what I call<br>patches fpzs and between the fpzs we<br>have different connections different<br>connectivity okay each fpz is unique in<br>terms of its set of influences and its<br>sensitivities to<br>disturbance both climate change but also<br>the disturbance from us to restore store<br>something okay so it will have a<br>different response to disturbance it's<br>Unique so therefore the outcomes the<br>indicators what you monitor should vary<br>between<br>fpcs I know you all like planting trees<br>and grasses and I applaud you for that<br>seriously let's get a little bit smart<br>about where we put them because they<br>might not always work<br>you might have to do other things in<br>other parts of the river and they should<br>be sympathetic with the River or the fpz<br>that you're dealing with and this is<br>where cultural issues then come involved<br>okay so um so you need to understand the<br>entire rivering landscape Mosaic not<br>your just your little bit of patch okay<br>let's move on to my second Point uh RS<br>in the anthrop osine oh the anthropos is<br>that new geological Epoch where humans<br>now dominate the environment okay<br>therefore anthropos scine rivers are<br>different to our natural<br>cousins okay they're novel C they are<br>they're novel and when they're novel<br>they also behave differently too we all<br>behave differently on the whiskey to the<br>Beer yes<br>okay so this has implications if we're<br>dealing with something that's novel this<br>has implications for the way we study<br>and the way we manage anthropos rivits<br>okay we can look at this start to unpack<br>it through the concept of resilience the<br>lens of resilience okay we've heard a<br>lot about it here is a traditional way<br>of looking at resilience it's called the<br>ball and cup model<br>okay don't look at me look at the string<br>watch the little ball watch the ball<br>going from side to side listen to my<br>what we could sell a million here<br>bro okay so what it means is that rivers<br>are always dynamic they are dynamic they<br>change and when they're changing they<br>cross over things called thresholds but<br>there is these other special types of<br>thresholds called tipping points now<br>it's not when you fall over on the bear<br>but I'll bring come back to that in a<br>minute and what drives these things are<br>a whole bunch of variables and we have<br>different variables they have fast<br>variables water quality is a fast<br>variable because water quality can<br>change very quickly but we also have<br>what we call slow<br>variables okay in New Zealand tectonic<br>action the rising of the land is a slow<br>variable land use change is a slow<br>variable climate change is a slow<br>variable okay<br>fpzs had different special thresholds<br>called tipping<br>points okay and they have different sets<br>of slow and fast<br>variables what the hell is he getting on<br>about let me illustrate in another way<br>okay so what we have in this thing here<br>is what they call the uh natural regime<br>where the ball would go backwards and<br>forwards being Dynamic changing and what<br>have you the thing is if you go over a<br>hump and then into another regime that<br>hump is called a Tipping Point important<br>thing to remember if you cross a Tipping<br>Point you can't go<br>back if your River tips into a different<br>state you can't go<br>back okay and as a consequence that New<br>River has a different productivity it<br>can't produce the same number of e it<br>can't produce all that Water Crest that<br>you like it can't provide those water<br>holes you like bombing into you have a<br>different set of structures you also<br>have different sets of<br>functions and you have um different<br>interactions responses to activities<br>disturbances and has different<br>sensitivities I'm<br>arguing that perhaps we need to be<br>looking at the why Cado has moved from<br>pre-european<br>into a new regime called the<br>anthropos it's behaving it's novel so we<br>need to have<br>perhaps novel ways of looking at it<br>novel ways of managing<br>it this is where traditional knowledge<br>comes<br>in okay so we have multiple lines of<br>evidence to suggest that Rivers a lot of<br>rivers globally have flipped into this<br>new Basin of Attraction we have got uh<br>climate change evidence land use<br>hydrology sediment regimes obviously<br>okay uh morphology a whole lot of<br>aquatic communities and all the way down<br>to here we're now seeing that the<br>respons of<br>rers which are in this new state are<br>also<br>novel management responses okay I'm<br>going to give you an example and here<br>I've got to go to Joe's country the good<br>old us OFA okay and um I'm going to be<br>looking at the Illinois River uh the<br>Illinois is an important uh River up<br>here it it essentially comes out of<br>Chicago and it goes into the Mississippi<br>okay um and then the aliens the<br>politicians okay they decided to build<br>what they call now I've got to get this<br>right because I have a trouble at times<br>it is the Chicago sanitary and<br>ship<br>canal okay it's the Chicago sanitary<br>ship canal where they took the waste<br>from Chicago rather than putting into<br>the Great Lakes they made a big canal<br>and put it into the Illinois River and<br>sent it Downstream hey to get rid of<br>okay really good and um the interesting<br>thing um because of the Turning of that<br>waste into the<br>Illinois and about 20 years afterwards<br>the first survey showed that the<br>Illinois was<br>biologically dead okay for 500 km<br>Downstream because of poor water<br>quality no fish no bugs no nothing just<br>a lot of sanitary and<br>ship<br>okay now there were major restoration<br>efforts under taken to clean up the<br>Illinois um and they began began in 19<br>48 with the environmental Pollution<br>Control Act and<br>1972 with the Clean Water Act by<br>1982 water quality levels had returned<br>to pre- uh ship canal levels water<br>quality improved in fact they reckon<br>that water quality now is probably<br>better than what it has ever been in the<br>Illinois River<br>okay as as a<br>result okay what we're seeing now is<br>that ecosystem structure that is fish<br>diversity um food webs interactions even<br>fish<br>growth okay is now different to what it<br>was pre<br>1900 even though water quality has<br>returned we've got a novel system going<br>to show you some a little bit of data<br>I'm getting the evil way you've got to<br>hurry up because we're getting hungry<br>what we've got here is on the X the Y<br>AIS is uh fish diversity this column<br>here is for the entire River this column<br>here is for the upper river the upper<br>fpz and this one here is for the Lower<br>River the fpzs in the Lower River okay<br>we've got fish diversity from 1950 all<br>the way up to<br>2015 those Dash lines oh sorry those<br>columns are for fish that feed<br>differently they're called functional<br>feeding gills some fish eat other fish<br>some feed some only eat little bugs some<br>Grays Okay so we've got different<br>functional feeding Guilds of fish okay<br>herbivores and vertor omnivores pisor<br>and planktivores okay the lines indicate<br>where there was a significant change in<br>the behavior of the fish diversity over<br>the time<br>okay um that's when we had the Clean<br>Water Act the the the two major<br>restoration<br>efforts there's a lot of data there but<br>the take-home message that I want to<br>give you is that the<br>responses in the river were not what we<br>thought would<br>happened so in some cases omnivores<br>bounced back pretty quickly and then all<br>of a sudden they got highly<br>variable some did Naf<br>all you know okay some got more variable<br>some improved a little bit then<br>flattened out some actually went down so<br>what we got was all of these different<br>responses response<br>trajectories okay they were<br>different highly variable responses they<br>were<br>novel interesting thing is that fish<br>diversity is still<br>now fish response trajectories differed<br>between different guilds feeding guilds<br>so we've unpacked fish to say hey where<br>are they eating what are they eating but<br>we found they all responded differently<br>in different<br>ways<br>okay those responses are novel which<br>suggests to me that the Illinois River<br>which is a large river like many large<br>rivers around the world are now<br>Noble they are anthropos rivers they are<br>responding differently to what they did<br>do<br>naturally okay implications for that we<br>can't restore<br>back you can't restore back in the<br>Illinois I'm<br>suggesting<br>okay we have um so that has implications<br>for your targets for<br>restoration because if you can't meet<br>them the people gave you the money<br>saying hey we gave you all that Bloody<br>money you haven't met your<br>target so how come it's all about<br>expectations<br>hey so if you try to push back to where<br>you once were and you don't meet him<br>uhoh youve<br>failed I'm suggesting you can't do it<br>anyway<br>perhaps okay so perhaps we need to be<br>looking about what are you managing<br>sorry what are you managing the white<br>cut<br>for I would suggest another way is to<br>prevent another bloody flip hey because<br>if you flip you're going to lose<br>productivity you're going to use your<br>cultural values and everything else so<br>the whole the larger aim should be we<br>are not going to go over another Tipping<br>Point simple aim but underneath it you<br>have that complexity and the richness of<br>what people doing but that needs to be<br>an aim<br>okay um so I think there needs also an<br>increased focus on slow<br>variables not just water<br>quality so we need to be looking at how<br>eels grow what is their growth their<br>response to being<br>translocated we need to be looking at<br>the response of other variables as well<br>and these could be cultural variables<br>because they are slow vars they're<br>really<br>important so therefore our targets our<br>outcomes our indicators also need to be<br>specific sharper for fpzs as well<br>because there were in the Illinois the<br>response differed between those<br>functional<br>processes so we need to be playing it<br>smarter and<br>sharper okay I'm winding up because I<br>can feel stomachs rumbling okay large<br>river ecosystems in the anthropos scene<br>they are what I call complex adapt you<br>can can tell I've gone back to my<br>scientist role in our these are complex<br>adaptive systems okay that require<br>different approaches to their study and<br>management simply avoiding avoiding<br>further flips which is a part of<br>resilience thinking I think is a really<br>healthy aim longterm aim okay I think<br>that um the response is that we need to<br>be looking at an increased scale of<br>focus in the Rhythm<br>not just our itty bitty patch we need to<br>be looking at the entire Rhythm Network<br>and knowing what type of functional<br>processor uh zones there are what is<br>their complexities and what have<br>you having said that I think Zone<br>specific management would be the way to<br>go okay with improved focus on outcomes<br>and indicators and monitoring that are<br>specific for<br>fpzs that are stopped to prevent further<br>flips if we flip we're going to have a<br>loss of our ability to bomb in the<br>river to fish in the river and to have a<br>healthy system okay with that I think<br>it's really quite important to<br>acknowledge that we can't leave it to<br>the two guys on the<br>outside okay and you know what this<br>comes from South Africa and if there's<br>one thing Australians and new zealanders<br>have in common we love beating South<br>Africa and R particularly now the cheats<br>okay sorry that was in a for that was<br>inappropriate comment okay that was an<br>inappropriate refereeing decision as<br>well and I'm going to hope that I don't<br>get that thank you very much for<br>listening you're a very very clever man<br>Martin bringing us Unity as part the SE<br>uh through the desire to beat someone<br>else um our lunch is is ready we're<br>going to have maybe three questions um<br>as those questions are getting ready I<br>do want to thank uh Dr Joe we had the<br>privilege of sitting with Joe on radio<br>tin um Monday 2: p.m. if you jump online<br>um you might find that video they<br>recorded our discussion was supposed to<br>be 10: but we ended up being 18 it was<br>such an easy conversation and I agree<br>with you talking about it's information<br>we can gather and together but how do we<br>communicate it to our kids which meaning<br>communicating it to our future um in<br>your discussion you spoke about um some<br>of the the uses of water and in our<br>environmental plan we talk about states<br>of why certain uses are used uh certain<br>I suppose um if it's it's the most pure<br>water we'll use it for certain things<br>and it's similar uh to what Martin was<br>talking about our responses were based<br>on the river telling us how we should<br>use it and so our water bodies if they<br>were of the most purest form we would<br>use that to heal our Chiefs to bless our<br>babies cuzz they're the closest things<br>we have to our creator as it comes<br>through all of uh human land and being<br>tainted by human hands we change that<br>response to her and we sit with her and<br>we use her use that water differently<br>and I use the example when we do our T<br>if you're drinking water and I put my<br>finger in that glass of water you're not<br>going to drink it it's use has change<br>it's now only good for us putting on the<br>garden um so I appreciate your<br>discussions there in in our River's gone<br>through some similar things<br>um where we've not only fought to have<br>rights to look after her but we' fought<br>to limit her as a<br>competitive um commodity and when we see<br>the splits uh we saw the split in 99 of<br>EC andz into multiple uh power companies<br>the tribe fought against those things<br>because we saw her being pulled apart<br>for competing interests so um just a lot<br>of similarities she's regarded and then<br>we get the pressure put on us because<br>we're told but it's a matter of national<br>interest<br>that we uh provide that the river<br>provides 50% of New Zealand's energy<br>it's not about you and so that pressure<br>is put on and when we look like the bad<br>guy um David um yeah that I get you I<br>feel you and and we won't be giving up<br>on that um I've seen you uh over 10<br>years ago in those discussions land and<br>water forum and some of the national<br>objective framework groups pushing to<br>man in particular providing for<br>M to be involved in those disc and as a<br>tribe we're really proud of the fact<br>that the title of the expression of came<br>from which we used for the work of river<br>settlement and the E we said why are we<br>all doing negotiations to get something<br>of betterment for the whole country why<br>don't we just do that and we've got<br>Nancy TW you can talk to she helped<br>draft the definition of t for the<br>national policy statement and we can um<br>you know so why can't we just apply that<br>around the whole country what w cotle is<br>trying to achieve and so yeah pretty<br>happy a lot of those discussions<br>happened here some of those are W I<br>think they were called also brought<br>those about Martin um sorry we'll get to<br>those<br>questions Martin um your large Riv<br>ecosystems how do we manage that we like<br>to think and I think this is your point<br>around the functional process zones is<br>that we'd like to<br>think the Mana the power The Prestige<br>and authority of our Waters tell us how<br>she should be used so we have areas<br>designated to put our wer areas<br>designated to cut here is there areas<br>designated to swim areas designated for<br>blessing based on the way she moved and<br>I think you're right so our Tia is<br>changing the way we apply and look after<br>her we want to do it the same way we<br>used to and you said we're not really<br>going to get back to restore because<br>we're in that anthropos scene era so I<br>was<br>listening and it's it's creating a<br>different response for us and the way<br>the Tik we applied and we're now<br>challenging the way that we apply Tik<br>and we have to think Beyond what we what<br>we used to do um to to heal her so great<br>discussions um novel responses and I<br>think our people our communities Mii are<br>very um adaptive and respond quite<br>quickly and so that challenges for us to<br>to to apply a novel way of thinking um<br>we'll have some questions thanks<br>Michelle right we've got quite a lot of<br>questions coming through so I'll just<br>say if we don't get to your question uh<br>today we'll get our presenters to um put<br>their answers uh on paper and we'll<br>email them out to people um so first<br>question for David uh is the tool being<br>implemented to undertake restoration<br>work on the ground are land owners and<br>or how are land owners and communities<br>being incentivized to do<br>this um it the the tool itself is more<br>like a catchment planning tool so it's<br>designed to sort of guide I would say<br>more at a at a high level like a subc<br>catchment or catchment scale and so I<br>think it's valuable at that level um as<br>the catchment planning tool it's you<br>know you'd use different models or<br>different um knowledge systems to be<br>able to guide at a more local level<br>whether that be Farm scale whether it be<br>riparian Wetland or something like that<br>yeah uh question for Martin what key<br>points do you look at to create<br>resilient plans for restoration should a<br>catchment h should a river<br>change po how long have you<br>got um one minute<br>first yeah um first of all my big<br>question is um uh do we still have a<br>natural river system do we still have it<br>um and so I look um for a whole bunch of<br>variables or indicators around that um<br>and then from that I I also asked ask<br>what fpzs and what's driving those so<br>then it it's a bit like David in terms<br>of the building a decision Port support<br>system to say this is what's changing<br>wear this is what's driving it and the<br>end of the day these then are the best<br>uh restoration tools depending on where<br>you are in the river to do that because<br>a a one fix approach doesn't doesn't<br>work so really um Vite and spreading the<br>Vite all the way across your toast<br>doesn't<br>work okay I have to ask this one um I<br>know this one will be on the top of many<br>people's minds um former Ry and Faro<br>residing at the toilet end of the river<br>so the lower end of the Y cutle River or<br>the toilet end of river systems do you<br>have any ideas on areas to focus on on<br>while they wait for Upstream catchment<br>clean<br>up so so if we've got a lot of sentation<br>a lot of nutrients coming down from the<br>uper catchment what would the catchment<br>receiving all of that what are the<br>things they should focus<br>on if if that<br>sounds can I um tackle that one first<br>sure right um the work that we've done<br>in in a number of large rivers in the US<br>um suggest around nutrient Dynamics<br>suggested that no matter what you did in<br>terms of the riparian Zone um and the<br>the catchment would make that much of a<br>measurable effect on nitrogen and<br>phosphorus and the riverbed<br>sediment so they've started to put in<br>sediment traps to remove<br>it um and that was their first approach<br>and then they then they went into<br>riparium<br>management and then they went into broad<br>catchment management so it was very<br>staged approach but once again it was<br>determined by what type of river we<br>actually got in terms of the nutrient<br>and phosphorus and a lot of our modeling<br>would suggest that if you want to get<br>phosphorus and nitrogen out of the bed<br>sediments just move in there and take it<br>out you hear that Council we don't need<br>a<br>consent just be really quick and ask<br>turn the question around and ask what do<br>they<br>want fundamentally<br>yeah okay I've got another one for David<br>how does the tool demonstrate return on<br>investment to inform and secure<br>additional<br>funding well it's got two components<br>it's got um what's called implementation<br>cost which is the cost of the<br>restoration work and it's also got<br>opportunity cost and that might be<br>something along the lines<br>of maintaining for example a key Wetland<br>and actually being paid to do it um and<br>you'd get paid for the in effect what it<br>took to take that Farmland out of out of<br>action to be to make it nonproductive<br>it's much better value where it was<br>being<br>um sequestering nutrients and so on in a<br>wetland context um how does it support<br>future actions well I I don't know if<br>the tool was used by let's say an<br>authority it could be used alongside<br>other tools to say where are the key<br>areas and where's the best value for<br>money that we'd get in implementing an<br>action I've got a text to say Al Kai has<br>been delivered it's been out there for<br>about 10 minutes um give our give our<br>presenters 10 minutes to have something<br>to eat before you go and give them heaps<br>of questions um fin them sit down and<br>have a cord with them uh and and and<br>yeah we'll enjoy our lunch now probably<br>will cut our lunch a little bit short um<br>but before we head out to lunch um if I<br>could call um Gavin Williamson down to<br>come and uh provide our panel members<br>atong uh Gavin is an environmental and<br>key relations um relationship manager at<br>Mercury and one of the sponsors of the<br>river Symposium um prior to Mercury they<br>were water care and we had um only what<br>done four 5 months ago the 20 year kind<br>of commemoration of the signing of<br>W run here and take a photo that's the<br>only task I've been given of importance<br>today if we can go out the front and<br>lunch<br>that be out here to join us very shortly<br>and then we'll get<br>started<br>uh different type of scale uh from their<br>Kai so hopefully everybody had a good<br>Kai and uh ready for the afternoon<br>session uh a couple of things I picked<br>up just before lunch uh one picture that<br>really caught my eye was uh good fast<br>and cheap uh much like my dating life uh<br>day some of the other things I picked up<br>as well sometimes Common Sense Common<br>Sense prevails it reminds me of a story<br>uh one of the uncles who was walking in<br>the uh Outback in Australia actually he<br>was walking through Australia and he<br>noticed the sky hanging from a tree from<br>his legs and uh a guy underneath him he<br>was he was like a b and a guy Underneath<br>Him cutting wood and he went up to the<br>guy and he says Alo what's what's up<br>with your mate he goes oh mate don't<br>worry about him he's a little bit crazy<br>he thinks he's a light bulb and he goes<br>oh why don't you turn him off bro he<br>dark yeah sometimes Common Sense<br>prevails finally who who wants to cut<br>wood in the<br>dark Ka I think that's all of us here e<br>yep Ka all right we'll get into the uh<br>of has been involved in freshwater<br>ecology over a long career uh he holds a<br>BSC MSC is almost the whole alphabet in<br>here uh degrees from the University of<br>Oakland and a PhD in Fisheries from<br>Oregon State University uh he's also had<br>broad experience in both Lake and stream<br>ecology uh including uh quantitative<br>estimation of fish population the<br>effects of land and the abundance of<br>fish and Coda or crayfish uh use of<br>stable isotopes for food analysis and<br>impacts of evasive fish on water quality<br>and Native fish now prior to joining<br>Morphin in 2022 uh he was a professor at<br>the University of w where he taught<br>supervised students and led research<br>programs for 30 years uh his research<br>achievements include uh 88 referred<br>Journal articles 10 book chapters and 95<br>Comm missioned contract reports know my<br>how of my uh emiritus is that who say<br>emiritus yeah there you go Professor<br>Brendan Kiora<br>CAU just play ball with me don't do<br>that<br>okay all right um Co Brendan Hicks tooa<br>um and I'm really pleased to be here uh<br>today this is my one screen here in<br>front of me right okay it's kind of<br>teeny um so uh what I talk about today<br>is um uh uh tuna uh the one of my<br>favorite animals and um and I'm actually<br>not from around here so we were the 10<br>pound Pals who came across in the<br>1960s and um I went used to go fishing<br>with my dad at hunua in KY Creek and the<br>first fish I ever caught was a long fin<br>tuna and uh that<br>tuna we held up proudly before we let it<br>go and it was eight my dad said this is<br>over8 pound this is big so 4 kilos and<br>that was the same size as the uh UK<br>anguila anguila European eel maximum<br>size so I was hooked on<br>fishing since then so what I'm going to<br>talk about is um tuna where they come<br>from uh what we know about them and um<br>then I'm going to have a look at the<br>distribution in New Zealand and uh uh<br>talk specifically about um experiments<br>we did with biomanipulation which I will<br>explain and um and then we'll go through<br>the response of the tuna to pest fish<br>removal and um and then finally a more<br>local example of um uh the um fish the<br>fishing that we did uh with what he<br>finally trust I'm hugely grateful<br>because I couldn't have done that<br>fishing without them and um and we've<br>this was uh 16 17th of November so brand<br>new fresh results you know they're warm<br>and um so anyway I'll go through and<br>describe how we went with um uh with<br>with that with that fishing so so um<br>tuna have a global distribution<br>freshwater eels in particular and they<br>all belong to one genus which is called<br>anguila um and 19 species worldwide of<br>course we've got two here occasionally<br>we have the Australian visitor um but we<br>don't find a lot of the uh uh their long<br>speckled long final um and where they<br>are is described is described by the the<br>thick black lines so they're they the<br>coasts on the coasts of um uh east coast<br>of of North America and uh and then<br>variously in a lot of tropical areas and<br>this has actually has significance<br>because um as a tropical origin for the<br>genus and they're probably 80 to 40<br>million years uh old um and and the gray<br>arrows show some of the sort of ways<br>that they probably got from U this area<br>the teus sea and of course continental<br>drift happened and the world used to<br>look a lot more like this and the eels<br>have been around so long that they have<br>moved in their migrations with the<br>continents which is<br>extraordinary um when you think about it<br>and so they still spawn uh in Fr in in<br>the in the salt water um and they live<br>to adulthood in um in fresh<br>waterer so<br>um the freshwater fish database is a<br>wonderful resource and this these<br>pictures here I got from it so the short<br>fin tuna huila Australis is mainly North<br>Ireland so it does exist throughout the<br>country but there's far more in in North<br>irland streams um the longf tuna angua<br>debaki is throughout the country and<br>predominantly it's in the south island<br>so there's a lot of dots there in the in<br>the North Island too so it's really<br>spread through both Islands<br>but the important thing is that in those<br>cooler South Island Waters it's the<br>dominant species um and the important<br>thing this is one of our lessons out at<br>Lake Kim here is<br>oops was it gone sorry wrong way that's<br>the way I should go um so the tuban<br>species in New Zealand you can tell by<br>uh their dorsal fin this is very hard to<br>do when they're wriggling and their eels<br>wriggle a lot<br>so um so we put them to sleep with a<br>little bit of clove oil or some other<br>use useful anesthetic and um so the the<br>long fin tuner has a dorsal fin which is<br>on the top of the body and and it<br>extends uh more than a body width which<br>is this distance here forward of the<br>anus um and the short fin is different<br>because um its dorsal fin extends only<br>less than a body width<br>pass the anus towards its head so um so<br>that's eels 10 tun<br>101 um but very important because uh and<br>in fact a good e biologist can a good<br>Turner biologist can can tell the<br>species in the dark because the the long<br>fin is sort of more softer and has much<br>more flexible and loose skin and the and<br>the sort of muscular ones are the short<br>fin<br>Tona<br>so um now going to our bi<br>biomanipulation example um what we<br>wanted to do and uh David and I were U<br>sort of Co co-leaders of 10-year funding<br>projects um that we LED through the<br>University of wakato um and uh I was<br>looking at um invasive fish pest fish<br>and their effects on a variety of<br>different parts of the ecosystem um and<br>and of course tuna are Tonga<br>uh to to Ami and as they should be<br>because they're so common and a handy<br>Kai in most parts of the country unless<br>you're too far in land um and um and<br>they still recruit well to uh rivers and<br>lakes despite habitat change and<br>Commercial Fishing that started in full<br>in Earnest in the sort of early<br>1970s um and and they're over they're<br>vulnerable to over fishing without<br>careful management because of their long<br>life Cycles um so for female maturity<br>and the females are the only important<br>ones here sorry Lads<br>um they the females take 20 years to get<br>to maturity if they're short fins they<br>take about 40 years to get to maturity<br>if they're long<br>fins um and and the lads mature in about<br>half that time for both<br>species so our local lakes and rivers<br>I'm sorry to say but most people know<br>this have massive numbers of um of<br>invasive fish and especially the KO carp<br>the Dreadful koarp um which has been red<br>designated we used to think it was<br>saprinus Carpio and now we're sort of<br>realizing that that sort of orange color<br>that is characteristic probably means<br>that they Robo fuscus um they comprise<br>60 to 80% of the biomass so it's good<br>you're all sitting down because that's a<br>very high percentage of the biomass<br>considering they weren't here before the<br>1980s so they're really Dom made a lot<br>of<br>systems um and we undertook<br>biomanipulation removal of pests of<br>these invasive fish um in in hinai uh to<br>see the response of the tuna and the<br>water quality actually but um I'm going<br>to present the results of tuner removal<br>and um so what we've got here is a great<br>big boxo carp of which we collected many<br>many many and uh and and the Goldfish<br>like that there um they will hybridize<br>with the um with the Koi carp and uh and<br>then catfish or and other sort of<br>equally uh well no they're not quite as<br>big so they don't form the same sort of<br>biomass um here's an example of a short<br>fin uh tuna and uh this is um a rather<br>wonderful uh long fin tuna that we<br>actually used in a nutrient excretion<br>experiment and she went back and this is<br>LOA hinai in the<br>background<br>um<br>so lake ainai is not a large lake and<br>that was one of the reasons we chose it<br>for biomanipulation because if it had<br>been much bigger we wouldn't have sort<br>of chance of removing enough fish so<br>it's about 17 hectares in surface area<br>um has got a 330 hectare catchment area<br>um and and unfortunately the land juice<br>like much of the WTO is primarily<br>dairying around and um the other<br>important part is that here is um Lake<br>hin and the outlet goes down to Lake W<br>carry and we know what lake W carry is<br>full<br>of more carp so there's a um uh a covet<br>here and we uh decided to put a one-way<br>trap on that so that once we'd got rid<br>of Koi carp in uh Lake of hin um you<br>know they couldn't get back in at least<br>that was the<br>theory so um this and this is the<br>one-way trap here so it's got a um a<br>hinging gate and at the bottom of the<br>hinging gate it's got a number of sort<br>of fingers that can go one way to let<br>fish out but prevent fish going back in<br>whoops sorry um so this is the way the<br>fingers work and there's 35 mil gaps<br>between the uh articulated Fingers um to<br>allow natives to go in upstream and go<br>into the the lake um but that does stop<br>the large adults and here you can see<br>the large adults uh congregating around<br>trying to get back in so it allows large<br>Cory to leave they can't get back in as<br>they normally would do between their<br>life cycle<br>movements so we use these Mark Mark Rec<br>capture techniques doing a small fin<br>clip um letting the fish go once we<br>caught them waiting a few weeks for them<br>to mix around the population and fishing<br>again and by looking at the proportion<br>of marked fish to the total fish uh we<br>can make an estimate of um uh of the<br>total fish population with some cunning<br>maths which mostly we believe um so we<br>in 2011 we began this we removed three<br>tons of invasive fish mostly carp<br>because they were most of the invasive<br>fish um we fished again in 2012 we got<br>another one ton out and um and uh sorry<br>we fished again got half a ton and we<br>figured that there's this C reduction<br>which we hadn't fished and we assumed<br>they left out of the oneway gate and um<br>and weren't able to get back in so um<br>then we fished again in 2016 to see the<br>response so the calculation suggested<br>that we had<br>308 kilg per hectare of Koi carp that's<br>enormous by 2011 we'd managed so the<br>abundance is the number of car that's<br>the the black Square the gray circle is<br>the biomass which is sorry two axes<br>makes this a little bit tricky to to<br>read um but the important thing is the<br>huge drop between 2011 and<br>2012 and um uh uh and and then we fished<br>again in 2014 we had a further drop and<br>um uh unfortunately we weren't fishing<br>in 2015 and we saw a minor recovery of<br>the car which is pretty rapid when you<br>think about that um in the short time<br>period so uh they do breed and we figure<br>the small ones can go back through those<br>Gates through the<br>fingers but the the good news story is<br>that the short funa which were about 8<br>kilos per hectare in 2011 increased to<br>41 kilos per hectare in um by<br>2016 and these are you know pretty tight<br>confidence intervals we're pretty happy<br>estimates so one major Advance which we<br>have to thank Tino's negotiations<br>careful work with the crown for um is<br>that they made fishery regulations so<br>the first in fact ignore that first<br>point or two and we'll go straight to<br>the actual regulations in<br>2011 can't touch that can I<br>2011 um the w tyui w River Fisheries<br>regulations um allowed T wui to exercise<br>traditional management practices over<br>their own Ro and um and so these uh<br>points were brought in that couldn't<br>take female migrants um going Downstream<br>to spawn uh they introduced the minimum<br>weight um of 300 G for short fin tuna<br>400 gr for long fin tuna so you can't<br>take fish smaller than that and um uh<br>and that's 300 gram for the rest of the<br>country so it was a slight increase but<br>still a significant increase of the<br>minimum size but the important thing was<br>that the maximum weight that Fishers<br>could take to<br>long fin tuna was 2 kilos the rest of<br>the country it's 4 kilos so that is<br>hugely protective it's what we call in<br>Fisheries a slot limit because there's a<br>minimum size and a maximum<br>size um and um and there's a couple of<br>rahy conditions um one during the um uh<br>out migration from Fong Marino Wetland<br>streams and the other after a human<br>death and um and this is all well<br>resourced if anyone wants the links it's<br>down there and I can tell you them if<br>You' like and uh but certainly wonderful<br>absolutely wonderful uh act and um and<br>fishery regulation that tyui were<br>instrumental in um I've been going to<br>lake wahi for fishing trips taking out<br>my second year ecology class for a<br>number of years and um and suddenly a<br>change started we started to see long<br>fin tuna and about<br>2015 2 well we were fishing from 2015 in<br>201 uh 17 18 we started to see long fent<br>tuna being you know um not huge numbers<br>but really big short F long funa which<br>weren't there<br>previously uh and so here's a a very<br>happy student getting to grips with a uh<br>with a tuner and another one's escape<br>from a bin there down down below this<br>happens this is typical<br>fishing um<br>so moram came along I came along with<br>moram and I have to thank Tim Monaco um<br>for I think pushing this pushing this<br>our way or recommending the mor this to<br>Morphin and Morphin to um uh to the<br>funding agencies to W Regional Council<br>so we were engaged to devise cultural<br>cultural health indicators with wahi fui<br>trust as a joint Enterprise and um and<br>the other thing was knowledge transfer<br>so I had um impart a little bit of my<br>knowledge of fishing to uh uh to to<br>raher trust and um and we used uh 10<br>fine mesh F Nets which we set along the<br>shoreline of of Lake Kim here um and<br>that's that lake has been restored with<br>uh a new uh Bund and Outlet structure as<br>a result of the whiteo expressway so the<br>level's been raised by about half a<br>meter and um that's pretty uh a pretty<br>good thing to do so now we want to see<br>the response of that but also have um<br>local ewe take over the monitoring and<br>assessment of that fishery so<br>um so the the the indicators I've<br>proposed uh is species composition<br>because we want to see how many long<br>fent tuna there are compared to short<br>fent tuna um the mean weight because the<br>larger weights of eels suggests they're<br>doing better um the size frequency<br>because we want to see the number of<br>babies to see what the recruitment looks<br>like um and the catch rates so catch<br>rates are a standard fishing metric by<br>which I mean the number of tuna per net<br>and the weight of tuna per net so these<br>have been collected around the country<br>for 50 years so we've got good data to<br>compare these to see how local lakes do<br>Kim here being the first cab off the<br>rank we're also going to look at we uh<br>looked at we're going to look at um the<br>weight and length and the relative<br>weight of the to their length because<br>that tells us how fat they are do they<br>look like they've got enough to eat are<br>they getting enough Kai and and also the<br>proportion of invasive species such as<br>catfish and goldfish to tuna so that<br>shows the likely extent of<br>competition so um here are the Nets and<br>here's our Keen uh crew who helped me<br>set them so they have a long leader<br>leader goes out from the shore out uh on<br>the literal zone the shallow water and<br>and then the net is stretched with a<br>brick on the end of it just to hold it<br>flat and here's Johnny Kenny who's<br>helped me set these nets that's good<br>because he's nice and tall and I'm short<br>so he can get into the deep part um so<br>they were unbated and they were set<br>overnight and um uh sat in there late<br>afternoon and uh hauled in in first<br>thing in the morning um and was it<br>successful well yes it was people very<br>successful so identified um the tuna B<br>species in every net we weighed and<br>measured the first three netfs and we<br>didn't weigh anymore because we're<br>running out of time because we got so<br>many uh Tuna from the first three Nets<br>that we had all we needed um and so but<br>we identified encountered fish in the<br>other seven nets all the tuna released<br>we released alive and well in really<br>good shape and you can see um the uh<br>them being uh released here<br>going back into the lake um so we got<br>403 tuna all together short fin tuna and<br>uh and they were a good really good size<br>range and so as an average of 40 short<br>fin tuna per net that's a good catch<br>rate from a lake like Kimmer here which<br>does look pretty rubbish really we got a<br>scky depth of um less than 10 cm and<br>scky depth is the distance at which a<br>black and white disc disappears from<br>view underwater so it was pretty<br>horrible water um but very productive<br>and we got one long finin tuna who is uh<br>810 mm long nearly 2 kilos we got 178<br>invasive fish um and here's a box full<br>of them and they weighed about 25 kg um<br>mostly catfish some Goldfish a few rud<br>and five koi but F knitting is not the<br>most the best way to catch core in<br>actual fact um so is that an average of<br>18 invasive fish per net so another bit<br>of good news is a far more tuna than the<br>catch so conclusions um so monitoring<br>the the tuner with these fine mesh F<br>Nets and Lake Kim here works really well<br>so we'll do it again we have another<br>exercise planned for February March um<br>and uh from the initial results it looks<br>like there's very good numbers of tuna<br>um despite the number of invasive fish<br>so invasive fish probably aren't the<br>worst thing in the world um for these<br>tuna um and uh we got one large long<br>fish tuna and like why sorry in Lake Kim<br>here that should say um uh that was a<br>great discovery and sort of messages for<br>the future um you know removal of<br>invasive fish invasive species could be<br>a good idea but only if you can prevent<br>further invasions through some sort of<br>barrier um and uh it's hard work it<br>requires a lot of effort and repetition<br>and in general that's expensive as well<br>and eradication by fishing on alone is<br>um well most people consider it<br>completely unrealistic it's quite<br>unlikely that's for sure and the one way<br>gate that we tried wasn't a complete<br>solution um but it did help uh reduce<br>the biomass to some extent and um but<br>the juvenile koi which also migrate<br>could get up through that 35 mil Gap so<br>you need a different kind of barrier to<br>stop Koy getting up<br>completely so finally I'll wrap up now<br>um now me he knew to these Keen helpers<br>from wer trust um and uh uh W Regional<br>Council sent out a couple of students<br>some of students and um in setting the<br>Nets hauling them weighing and measuring<br>uh kakura nura was really excellent on<br>the scales she could read it when I<br>couldn't and um uh so uh Johnny Kenny<br>and bar hanui um Mane Kennedy Phil R Aon<br>kabakura and um and the couple of<br>students Matt singer and Zoe booth and<br>Paula Reeves came out which is quite an<br>achievement because I've never seen<br>Paula in the field before um and and our<br>Kim here fishing wouldn't have been<br>possible were that<br>this E help because we had a flat<br>battery there on our scales and Johnny<br>had a got old trade battery with the<br>radio on it you know and a 230 230 Volt<br>Plug-In and and they brought out the<br>Gazebo to keep the showers off us<br>Kiora Brendon<br>uh uh<br>k um yeah just uh just with the w um<br>regulations 2011 we got a I think uh we<br>got Ed and Nick manoko they were<br>responsible for putting that together uh<br>and also using traditional practices and<br>and I talked yesterday about the<br>importance of a name and how that has a<br>story especially with mildy names it has<br>a story and has learnings in it and when<br>I look at the the tuna and those<br>regulations of 2011 I can't help but<br>think about uh Huntley or Rahi poo as we<br>know it and and the story behind that<br>name uh because uh back in the day uh<br>pre-european uh Huntley wasn't really a<br>place that a lot of Alano lived they<br>lived on the outskirts of of raahi Poa<br>and um but Huntley was a great hunting<br>and fishing ground and especially for<br>fishing uh tuna uh so much so that a lot<br>of the neighboring iwi would come to PO<br>to to to fish and they and as you said<br>um tuna quite susceptible to over<br>fishing and that's exactly what happened<br>there were too many of the Foo taking<br>big catches of tuna and um before we<br>knew it uh there was a depression of<br>numbers of tuna and that almost caused a<br>Civil War uh amongst the ewi they<br>started to fight and argue about uh each<br>person's catch and how much they were<br>taking out of the the lakes and uh in<br>Rahi POA so uh to fix that uh arang<br>named TSU I was asked to come down and<br>uh sort the sort the problem so he came<br>down and he gathered all the foo<br>together and he put a Rahi uh on all the<br>lakes and the uh the river and Rahi Po<br>and that's where the Rahi part comes now<br>Rahi means that there'll be a CE a cease<br>of fishing there'll be no more fishing<br>there'll be no more hunting in this area<br>for for a little time so that's where<br>the Rahi uh part comes in that name the<br>second thing he did is he he grabbed a a<br>PO depending on who's telling the story<br>the PO is the Pow kicker others say that<br>the pow kicker is a you might see some<br>pictures of Waka<br>and now Captain<br>onaka he wears this uh cloak that looks<br>like a porcupine uh but that's a rain<br>coat to us and that's called a poro as<br>well and so on that post he he put He uh<br>uh drove it into the ground and he tied<br>pieces off his pork ker jacket uh to<br>that post and every now and then he'll<br>come back and he'll start to hammer this<br>post further and further into the ground<br>and his message to the people was that<br>while this post is above ground uh<br>there'll be no fishing in this area and<br>he continued to do so right up until uh<br>it was into the ground and then uh the<br>people were allowed to come back and<br>fish and then that created a uh<br>traditional system of when we were<br>allowed to fish and when we W allowed to<br>fish it became a seasonal thing and all<br>of that stuff so to look after the<br>numbers of our tuna uh the second thing<br>that happened after that happened was we<br>did a hucker uh and that hucker uh made<br>uh the tapu on the place or the Rahi no<br>it's a Rahi po being the Rahi that was<br>put on the place the P the jacket that<br>was tied of the post and the Haka to fak<br>the place there's another Lake in uh<br>Huntley called Haka not and that's where<br>that Lake gets its name uh the other<br>thing he said to uh the Fishers the<br>fishermen and the Fisher ladies uh was<br>that uh when you catch your fish you'll<br>have to uh I use the word wahi or to to<br>to other other people but to divide your<br>catch evenly amongst all the different<br>tribes doesn't matter where you come<br>from or where you fish and who you fish<br>for whatever your catch was you had to<br>you have to divide this equally amongst<br>all the other and so that is the where<br>the lake wahi gets its name and later on<br>uh wahi also gets that name from that<br>story as well so yeah thought I'll just<br>Dro that little historical knowledge on<br>goodbye okay moving on to our next<br>speaker uh she is a senior lecturer at<br>the school of of government uh her<br>research aims to understand how Society<br>can better design and analyze<br>institutions to the benefit of our<br>environment our economy and our<br>communities she leads the freshwater<br>program at Motu economic and public<br>policy research from the school of<br>government University of Victoria H<br>pakipaki do Dr Julia<br>tber<br>Mako<br>Pap<br>M called Julia toet Jones<br>a<br>thank you for having me here today it's<br>a real honor um I was really privileged<br>to receive the invitation and I feel<br>humbled to be standing alongside people<br>today and the wisdom that was shown<br>yesterday from the commitment to the<br>projects both on the ground and um in<br>the<br>offices um today I'm speaking about a<br>range of work that um I've been involved<br>in and that I'm generally interested in<br>and I think it is important when when we<br>think about water management and River<br>Management and so I'm talking about the<br>economics of river restoration my<br>background's pretty mixed so when people<br>ask me what I do now or what I am I say<br>an economist but it took me a long time<br>to get there um my undergraduate degree<br>was actually in ecology and zoology and<br>then I was interested in Social systems<br>because when I was learning about<br>ecological systems to me the biggest<br>challenge seemed to be people it would<br>be really nice to be able to lock it up<br>and put put it away or to use it for the<br>birds and the bees and the butterflies<br>but we needed to figure out systems<br>where we could influence people's<br>decision making to improve the<br>well-being of our<br>hour and our communities and so I went<br>back to school and did economics and now<br>here I am calling myself an economist so<br>there you go um but today I'm talking<br>about the e ecomics of river restoration<br>and often when we talk about economics<br>it's not just money it's not just<br>Financial benefits it's also non-market<br>benefits as well and also about how we<br>design our institutions or our rules or<br>our social structures to incentivize or<br>constrain behavior and so that will be<br>um the focus of what I'm talking about<br>today the second part of what I'm<br>talking about is the role of<br>values in economics we often treat<br>values as<br>exogenous particularly in a neoclassical<br>frame so we think about them as<br>outside of um our day-to-day decision<br>making and it makes the models<br>easy um but it doesn't always<br>reflect how people behave and so um what<br>I'm going to advocate for today a bit is<br>bringing values back into our decision<br>making frame as well as policy makers um<br>and also people on the ground so how can<br>we influence and change people's values<br>and attitudes or their preferences or<br>their beliefs about their relationship<br>with the environment and their<br>relationship in your case with the w<br>River<br>so I said it's not only about money but<br>money kind of matters as well when it<br>comes to this sort of stuff so um the<br>value of river restor ation is well<br>understood globally the Returns on<br>investment from improving River Health<br>and wellbeing significantly outweighs<br>the initial costs so the in New Zealand<br>nationally riparian margin restoration<br>has been estimated to generate net<br>benefits of between 1.7 billion and 5.2<br>billion per year so for each dollar you<br>put into River restoration the benefits<br>you get back greatly outweigh that<br>initial<br>investment and these benefit can come in<br>a range of forms so we've talked about<br>some of these today improve water<br>quality improve FL flow regimes sediment<br>reduction<br>hydrologic connectivity regulation of<br>water chemistry reduced extraction so in<br>some cases this is critical because you<br>end up with more water in the system<br>biodiversity gains and so on and these<br>changes clearly benefit the environment<br>but they can also benefit people and so<br>we've talked about ecosystem services<br>today as as well and that's how we tend<br>to monetize some of the benefits that<br>can come from improving ecosystem Health<br>but the fact that they benefit the<br>environment and their benefiting social<br>systems means that we can classify these<br>watersheds or these catchments or these<br>um River Scapes as social ecological<br>systems and this term's already been<br>brought up today but it means that not<br>only are we focused on the ecosystem<br>capability of a particular system but<br>we're also concerned with those social<br>feedback loops that can occur because<br>although the the environment can deliver<br>well-being outcomes for communities in<br>terms of ecosystem goods and<br>services is the interaction effects<br>between what's going on the environment<br>and the social system that's interacting<br>with the environment that creates these<br>feedback loops and also puts pressure um<br>on the environment in different forms<br>and so this this idea of so social<br>ecological systems I think really<br>resonates with one of the talks<br>yesterday about cultural<br>landscapes and thinking about things as<br>um and trying to understand the networks<br>or the feedbacks that effects that occur<br>between social systems and ecological<br>systems and so today I'm going to be<br>talking in particular about values and<br>governance um<br>what that means within a social system<br>and so the purposes of um trying to<br>understand what's<br>um going on within social systems is it<br>seems likely that the biggest challenge<br>going forward for<br>um restoring or improving the health and<br>well-being of the river or or any River<br>um will remain what it is today namely<br>the social aspects within the social<br>ecological system as we've talked about<br>today there's evidence out there we know<br>a lot of the science it's about figuring<br>out ways to change people's behavior we<br>can always know more but focusing on<br>social systems is what we'll be talking<br>about here so within um my discipline<br>and the way that I look at these things<br>um social systems are constructed from<br>rules and I equate rules to institutions<br>so institutions are the rules of the<br>game that shape human behavior they're<br>the things that encourage some of you to<br>open the door for someone else as<br>they're walking through it's<br>institutions of tier they they're the<br>things that guide our Behavior tell us<br>what it is appropriate to do and not<br>appropriate to do and institutions<br>really matter so the type of rules that<br>we create really influence people's<br>behavior so for institutional<br>arrangements to be effective rules need<br>to be aligned across scales and we<br>talked a bit about this um or others<br>talked about this today or yesterday um<br>the importance of having<br>consistency from the Constitutional<br>level so what's being said up and New<br>Zealand obviously doesn't have a written<br>Constitution but we have a whole lot of<br>Acts and laws that set up in that at<br>that constitutional level they in a top-<br>down system will influence what goes on<br>to the RMA that will influence what goes<br>on in District and Regional plans and<br>then that will influence what goes on on<br>the ground at the operational<br>level um and these systems can work in<br>both ways so we can have top- down<br>systems where direction is coming down<br>from the top but we can also have bottom<br>up systems and some of what's H occurred<br>here in the white C could be argued to<br>be more of a bottomup Arrangement rules<br>and the social norms are driving<br>decision making on the ground and that's<br>starting to influence what's going on<br>heading<br>upwards um but an example of where this<br>alignment works and where it doesn't<br>um this<br>year um a colleague and I um produced<br>some research that argued that we could<br>be here in New Zealand and some small<br>catchments be designing water markets as<br>clubs So within catchment groups you<br>could allow trading to occur between<br>those members of the group and you can<br>arrive at<br>outcomes that<br>improve environmental performance and<br>also production outcomes for Farmers now<br>the challenge for New Zealand is<br>is we have a resource management act<br>which is obviously in some state of flux<br>currently but um the<br>RMA does not define property rights<br>clearly and so for a trading club to<br>work you would need well-defined<br>property rights but we do not have<br>well-defined property rights in the r<br>and part of the reason for this is Mari<br>writes an interest in water are still<br>unresolved and what you can see in this<br>example is we might have an Innovative<br>governance Arrangement that could<br>actually improve outcomes for<br>communities and the environment but we<br>don't have the institutional alignment<br>that'll support that um across<br>scales um and as has been talked about<br>today W cutle is a little bit insulated<br>from some of this because of their own<br>legislation and their own environmental<br>plans so some of this applies to other<br>areas of New Zealand that wouldn't<br>necessarily apply directly here um but<br>having alignment across scales is<br>critical in the social<br>Systems Second argument I want to make<br>is in economics we often assume that<br>people's choices reflect their<br>preferences and so people have these<br>values and attitudes or beliefs and your<br>choices<br>reflect what you want to do sometimes<br>governmental decision makers don't like<br>the choices that people are making so<br>they create a range of policies or<br>institutions to try and nudge or move<br>people in a direction that they feel is<br>socially<br>optimal now our<br>assumption as policy makers is often<br>that we should change people's choices<br>and we forget about people's preferences<br>attitudes now if we can change people's<br>preferences or values and attitudes the<br>cost might be greater upfront but the<br>longer term benefits could far outweigh<br>that cost it's just really hard and the<br>political situation means that often the<br>short-term acceptability of policies<br>that prioritizes them over the long-term<br>efficacy that could come from changing<br>people's values and attitudes but if we<br>oh yeah so that's if you put your<br>institutions your choice to change but<br>if we could think about this again as a<br>dynamic feedback loop where it's not<br>just the linear process but we have an<br>option of changing people's values and<br>attitudes alongside their choices when<br>it comes to Big Global Environmental<br>challenges and fresh water falls into<br>those we might have a greater ch chance<br>of addressing um some of those future<br>challenges so we do see values change in<br>Action<br>Recycling would be something that even a<br>few decades ago or maybe a decade ago I<br>can't really quite remember it's all bit<br>fuzzy um wouldn't have been internalized<br>as a Behavior now it just is something<br>that both social norms and individual<br>attitudes have probably<br>shifted<br>if we could change people's attitudes to<br>fresh water and to Restoration all of<br>those years of investment that go into<br>convincing people that this change is<br>needed that money and that investment<br>could be put into projects on the ground<br>and there's no easy way of doing this um<br>but I'm just putting it out there as an<br>idea of thinking about these<br>institutional Arrangements both as top<br>down but also bottom up and<br>that um you all have really powerful<br>relationships with your communities and<br>with the Regional Council and so<br>Regional Council is going through<br>another 10-year plan or whatever um<br>thinking about the language that's used<br>in terms of changing people's values and<br>attitudes and embedding that in uh lower<br>level legislation could be really<br>helpful<br>so looking to the Future river systems<br>need to be thought of as social<br>ecological systems not just um<br>ecological systems and and this<br>reinforces the message that's been uh<br>shed today aligning rules across scales<br>is critical to achieve effective<br>governance outcomes as I said here in<br>the Y cutle you're a bit insulated from<br>that because of your own legislative<br>Arrangements but across the country more<br>broadly thinking about rules alignment<br>across scales as really<br>important and then thinking about longer<br>term changes and preferences and values<br>um can be stimulated by institutional<br>change there are feedback loops there um<br>and if it's done well it could help<br>deliver well-being improvements for both<br>the environment and the communities um<br>in the decades to come and that's likely<br>to accelerate restoration efforts um and<br>improve outcomes for the hour all right<br>cheers<br>thanks Julia awesome awesome cord all<br>one thing I picked up on there and this<br>is for T goes back to uh my dating days<br>you know when you start off and it's<br>about Tia right Tia and stuck into that<br>Tia and one thing you talked about was<br>you know when you're you're courting<br>your wahini the first thing you do is<br>you start opening up the door okay open<br>up the door to the car open up the door<br>to the fry all of those things being a<br>very courteous man seven C just get in<br>the<br>car until uh and you wouldn't believe it<br>sometimes my mouth gets me into the dog<br>box and then so to revert back uh to Tia<br>101 and start opening up that door again<br>and she's just more like whatever and it<br>takes takes me months to get back in<br>there uh<br>heway okay all right move on before I<br>pering myself some more uh uh our next<br>speaker is a freshwater ecologist with<br>research interests that intersect uh the<br>areas of freshwater ecology aquatic<br>biodiversity and water quality with a<br>strong focus on providing knowledge and<br>solutions to assist enironmental<br>managers Kaki and stakeholders and<br>reaching achievable restoration and<br>uhi Bay plenty Regional Council chair in<br>Lake and freshwater Science University<br>of w associate professor and I'm going<br>to try and say your name my Bo Dennis<br>Now give me a<br>go<br>oi right<br>yes<br>um I would like to acknowledge my coer<br>of this presentation Michael pingram<br>who's working at the white cut Regional<br>Council um who's uh really inspired a<br>lot of the uh the the the content of<br>this presentation and he's also the<br>ecologist behind a lot of the arguments<br>that I'm putting forward today um<br>whereas I know a little bit about likes<br>Michael can answer all tricky questions<br>about fish ecology um um I would like<br>also to thank a lot of people who have<br>influenced my thinking about the uh uh W<br>uh low W flood plane and the connected<br>Lakes to it uh many of uh which are in<br>this room era David Natasha Tracy and<br>Carrie uh over the years um<br>I feel like I'm that little stream<br>segment at the at the bottom of the<br>water that Joe described earlier to<br>us and I'm just sort of accumulating all<br>of that knowledge of what came before me<br>from all of these different branches in<br>the in the in the Watershed um one<br>person in particular I want to<br>acknowledge is Bruno David uh who's been<br>very influential in a lot of the work<br>that I'm presenting here today Bruno<br>David is um I would argue the most<br>passionate fish ecologist in New Zealand<br>um and has unfortunately uh moved on<br>from freshw ecology is now brewing beer<br>in Reglan um and it's recently won the<br>best brewery Award of New Zealand so um<br>um it seems like everything he's doing<br>he's doing with<br>passion um so I'll be also thank thanks<br>Martin for describing the concept of<br>resilience earlier because that saves me<br>a lot of time explaining it so I can<br>jump right into it uh so really today um<br>I will focus a lot of my my my talk on<br>the white cut of flat plain water bodies<br>um which is sort of really uh stretching<br>all the way from uh Hamilton maybe uh<br>Downstream and you'll see a lot of the<br>flood Plaines when you're driving out uh<br>through n here and topi um I will<br>outline a few current challenges uh with<br>the aim to then start talking about how<br>we can rebuild resilience for Native B<br>biodiversity and specifically talking<br>about uh uh uh Native fish including<br>inanga Giant kapu and um Bandit kapu<br>sort of normal sort of white B species<br>that you usually encounter in those<br>water bodies and I'll be talking a<br>little bit about opportunities on how to<br>achieve that but I will end with a<br>question uh that um I would like<br>everybody's really give me feedback on<br>how to achieve some of these<br>things um just really not going to spend<br>too much time on uh on some of these<br>slides here I think I just wanted to<br>highlight that the low wakato flat plane<br>has a vast area of wetlands that<br>historically would have been connected<br>directly to the main stem of the river<br>and its tributaries and would have been<br>part of uh that system that would<br>normally flood very naturally during<br>high flow events and would reced during<br>dry events um and um I don't think I<br>need to label the point about the<br>importance of those wetlands in in the<br>flood plane ecosystem um I do appreciate<br>that this map I'm showing here with the<br>the change in Wetland extends between<br>the uh 1840s and uh current state is<br>slightly outdated so this is a map that<br>was produced in the mid 990s really um I<br>don't think the Wetland extent has<br>changed dramatically since then and<br>today and really Al also the<br>hydrological connectivity between a w<br>cat River and some of these Wetlands uh<br>is still uh very much impaired um it's<br>worth pointing out that um the uh wut<br>District uh contains about a third of<br>all of the wet freshwater Wetland<br>habitat in the wut region so that's a<br>very substantial amount of wetland<br>habitat that is worth protecting um as I<br>will highlight later it's also home to<br>the funga mar funga Marina Wetland which<br>is a RZA site so it's an internationally<br>recognized site of importance um and um<br>I did have a a slightly cynical uh<br>reason for putting up this map from the<br>mid 90s because until then uh Regional<br>government included the funga Marin<br>wetland in its documents and Maps as<br>flood protection area 2 I believe um<br>with Lake white cut being flood<br>protection area one um and uh I just<br>wanted to sort of highlight the way our<br>perception and our narrative around<br>these are has changed over the<br>years um the low W cut um flood plane is<br>also home to a lot of lakes and um<br>probably about uh thousands of water<br>bodies and habitat types along the river<br>and I'm just putting up an example of<br>some of the different Lake types that<br>occur along the waata river here um with<br>this map being produced uh just really a<br>couple of months ago for a publication<br>that is in press by Dave low and John<br>Green who who have gone out of their way<br>to uh map and classify lakes in the<br>white cut region and especially along<br>the white cut River um with dozens of<br>different Lake types um occurring along<br>the river that were formed by a large<br>diversity of geological processes um all<br>of these legs uh provide um incredible<br>value to the region um and they've been<br>used for various purposes um the one<br>thing I wanted to highlight is that most<br>of those Lakes along the wut river um if<br>not all of them would have been uh<br>directly connected to the main stem of<br>the river they would have been part of<br>the wider flood plane um all of those<br>legs would have contained um some level<br>of wetland habitat around them and as<br>we've seen yesterday with Natasha's uh<br>presentation along around leg funga a<br>lot of those habitats are degraded or<br>are in dire need of of management and<br>restoration um so the focus of uh the<br>next few slides is really around some of<br>those Lakes um and we know that a lot of<br>those leges are managed hydrologically<br>very carefully um and they are<br>disconnected um or they modified from<br>their natural uh connectivity to the wut<br>river and we were particularly<br>interested in uh how that change and<br>that modification of hydrological<br>connectivity has impacted on uh Native<br>fish movement between these Lake<br>ecosystems and the wi white cut<br>riverscape and this is a study that<br>Bruno David LED in 2019 uh we we were<br>interested in really understanding uh do<br>some of these Lakes uh actually provide<br>a spawning habitat of native fish and do<br>they provide uh a source of native fish<br>recruitment into the wider<br>riverscape um so we sampled um several<br>catchments uh that we labeled with<br>letters uh in the white cut riverscape<br>on this map so all of those blue lines<br>represent uh a larger stream um and you<br>can see it's a fairly complicated<br>connected system with the main stem of<br>the river here flowing through Huntley<br>all the way up through<br>Tata um and leg W being the largest<br>Shallow Lake in the area and like funger<br>being the second largest lake and we<br>have L wahi here and a whole range of<br>other Lakes so all of those red circles<br>were sampled for Native fish uh normally<br>young of the Year fish so they those<br>fish would be about a year old and we<br>were interested in understanding where<br>these fish have come from and we used um<br>autolift m microchemistry for that which<br>is a very fancy tool to uh trce fish<br>back to their point of origin um for<br>that you need to extract this little ear<br>Stone here which is a calcium carbonate<br>structure uh here in this area of a fish<br>and this is what it looks like under the<br>microscope uh the diameter uh is about<br>as big as a small grain of sand<br>basically um it accumulates uh um the um<br>calcium carbonate and the chemistry<br>uh of the water into its structure every<br>day so each of these rings represent a<br>day of growth which is very similar to a<br>tree uh uh tree rings if you look at the<br>tree ring you can sort of understand how<br>old the tree is and by analyzing the<br>chemistry within each of these layers<br>you can understand where the fish has<br>come from and um and um obviously uh if<br>you're looking at the chemistry uh near<br>the core of that ear Stone you can start<br>to understand where the fish was hatched<br>actually and where the fish was born and<br>then moved out of that system um so<br>hopefully that makes sense because the<br>this plot here really shows at least one<br>way of looking at the chemistry oh how<br>up um so this is just looking at one uh<br>way in terms of the chemistry um the<br>important part here is that each of<br>these horizontal lines represents the<br>chemistry in each leg which is really<br>unique each of the chemistry uh uh<br>fingerprints in these legs very unique<br>which is then imprinted on this ear<br>Stone um and each of those dots here<br>represents a fish uh that was collected<br>um to understand where the fish has come<br>from so what you see is that uh fish<br>that were collected in this catchment F<br>which is basically around the<br>tributaries of L<br>W um never left the lake all of the fish<br>that were collected at L W were actually<br>born and hatched in leg W except for<br>this little buer here that we re uh um<br>that we uh later found was actually<br>misclassified using uh a second tier of<br>analysis which put the fish actually<br>into different catchment um so yeah<br>anyway um so some of the other legs and<br>I want to highlight one leg in<br>particular this is leg wahi so this<br>horizontal line here represents the the<br>chemical fingerprint of legui and you<br>see that uh the fish that are sitting on<br>this line were caught in all of these<br>different catchments uh so there's fish<br>that were caught in catchment B uh d and<br>H and G and if you go back to this map<br>here you can see that fish that were<br>born in L<br>wahi migrate out of that lake so from<br>this little catchment here go into the<br>main stem of the river and basically<br>move through the almost the entire water<br>riverscape of the W River all the way up<br>to top into the into some of the<br>tributaries past nahia um going all the<br>way up to Hamilton and even uh uh uh<br>some of these legs in Hamilton so this<br>is really amazing for us to understand<br>that um and one of the major conclusions<br>of this work was really that um some of<br>the lakes and the wakato river lower W<br>River flood plane disproportionately<br>contribute uh to the fish recruitment of<br>Native Native fish along the wut<br>riverscape whereas other Lakes uh uh<br>unfortunately don't do that anymore um<br>and some follow-up work concluded or<br>found that the um hydrological<br>connectivity that still exists between<br>leg wahi and the W cat River enables<br>those things to happen um there during<br>certain times of the year especially<br>during uh winter and Autumn when the<br>when the river level is high the<br>actually the W river water flows back<br>into<br>lahi um so there's a bidirectional uh un<br>almost unconstrained movement of fish in<br>and out of that Lake enabling those fish<br>that were born in Lake wahi to move back<br>into riverscape and populate other<br>areas uh we think that this is um um<br>something worth considering for<br>conservation efforts to um maintain and<br>restore and manage the habitat at at<br>likew and its tributaries to enable the<br>lake to uh uh uh contribute to that<br>native fish distribution along the ward<br>River scape but we also argu that this<br>is probably something that needs to be<br>considered for all of the other Lakes as<br>well to reinstate and restore<br>hydrological connectivity enable that<br>bidirectional flow in and out of those<br>Lakes uh so those Lakes can have an<br>opportunity to contribute to the fish<br>populations if you think about this in<br>terms of resilience um for us um it<br>really highlighted that the native fish<br>recruitment in the in the in the flood<br>plane area has very low resilience and<br>is very susceptible to a dramatic or<br>catastrophic event in L wahi if we<br>losing that Lake uh it could you know if<br>if it's if it's de if it's degrading or<br>if the habitat is declining the habit<br>equality in that leg is declining we<br>might lose those really important<br>ecosystems to support native fish<br>riverscape um so with that in mind we<br>also um sort of um started to think<br>about how we could improve the<br>resilience of native fish um in in that<br>flood plane<br>area um which is not very easy and it's<br>very complicated and I'm putting up this<br>slide here to highlight a couple of<br>things um so this map here uh shows how<br>uh the wut river uh um has been modified<br>and the hydrology has been modified uh<br>an entire um sort of flood plane area<br>the light shade the uh the light blue<br>shaded area is the flood plane um which<br>is uh now largely disconnected from the<br>main stem of the river um and despite<br>some of the major vegetation clearances<br>and agricultural activities uh that took<br>place between sort of the late 1800 00s<br>and mid 1900s the uh um the<br>unconstrained lateral inundation events<br>were actually still intact until the<br>sort of 60s to 80s when the construction<br>of the flood protection scheme resulted<br>in um um several hundred kilometers of<br>stop Banks being built uh many flood<br>plums and floodgates uh that have now uh<br>largely disconnected the flood plan area<br>by uh just about<br>50% um and on top of that um because of<br>the um water quality issues in some of<br>those areas uh we have now created an<br>environment where um invasive fish uh<br>are are largely dominating the ecosystem<br>as Brenan pointed out earlier that they<br>can build up biomasses uh that that<br>exceed at least 50% uh in those<br>ecosystem so each of these black uh Dots<br>here on this particular map highlights<br>the records of uh invasive fish um um in<br>those areas that are all largely uh uh<br>flood plane<br>areas<br>right so um so given those uh uh<br>multitudes of pressures in the flood<br>plan areas along the W River uh we felt<br>that meaningfully improving the<br>resilience of native fish species will<br>require uh uh addressing uh issues of<br>water quality hydrological connectivity<br>um and also we thought about when when<br>we accounting for climate uh change<br>controlling and reducing invasive<br>invasive Fish Production will become<br>increasingly difficult um and I think<br>Michelle's talk yesterday's spoke<br>volumes on how difficult it is to manage<br>pest fish at moment and we expect that<br>uh pest fish will have probably a bit of<br>an advantage under climate change<br>scenarios as well so on this conceptual<br>figure um we're looking at the key<br>factors of mortality uh of native fish<br>at flood pumps as we've seen earlier uh<br>with one of the slides from era um we're<br>looking at DIS disconnection of flood<br>plan water bodies and environmental<br>stress um that can uh lead to the<br>dominance of alien fish<br>in some of those areas which is<br>highlighted uh by that um uh dial or<br>that Arrow here which is sort of what we<br>estimating to be the current status<br>where disconnect disconnection is high<br>mortality is high and environmental<br>stress is high we now seeing this uh um<br>proliferation of inv invasive<br>species and um those positive feedback<br>loops that we're trying to indicate with<br>those curved<br>arrows um really sort of highlights that<br>um they're really hard to uh manage and<br>um and they're probably sort of creating<br>their own little resilience in terms of<br>management this is the a second cup that<br>Martin showed earlier where that marble<br>is already uh sort of in that cup and<br>we're trying to push it back to to the<br>previous state which might not be<br>feasible um so the likelihood of uh<br>expected fish assemblages uh being<br>prevalent and the uh potential changes<br>in state of fish assemblages following<br>actions uh to address a single pressure<br>AIS can then result in possibly a<br>mixture of tolerant species U But<br>ultimately I think uh what we I'm hoping<br>that's where we aiming for would be to<br>increase native fish resilience and give<br>them a Fighting Chance over some of<br>those alien species and it will<br>ultimately uh need a um a whole range of<br>different op management options that<br>need to be implemented including uh<br>reducing native fish mortality and<br>controlling in invasive fish um flood<br>plane management men so that means um<br>either managing or recreating a spawning<br>habitat for for those fish species uh<br>reconnecting habitats um and wetlands to<br>the to the wider uh uh flood plane um<br>and um and we've had this discussion um<br>after lunch actually about some of the<br>legal instruments as well uh so far I<br>believe native fish don't have uh legal<br>protection status um like for example<br>trout uh where the habitat is protected<br>and there might be an option to to think<br>about and push for protecting habitat<br>for Native species as<br>well all right so um one more thing I<br>wanted to mention I'm sorry if I'm run<br>running a bit over time um so because<br>flood plan management is a pressing<br>issue worldwide this is a lot of these<br>issues are not unique to New Zealand um<br>it's not surprising that this is a very<br>effect active area of research globally<br>and um we felt there's good potential<br>for River restoration practitioners in<br>New Zealand to draw on lessons from<br>elsewhere and we've heard some of the<br>arguments to today from our<br>International speakers um we also<br>embarked on a literature review here and<br>we draw upon some 200 uh case studies<br>from overseas and trying to understand<br>what people have done where things have<br>worked where things haven't worked and<br>how transferable some of that knowledge<br>and those learnings might be to New<br>Zealand uh uh situations as<br>well um so we uh asked these questions<br>to guide our literature review um and uh<br>as you can see from these organiz and<br>from those people involved here there<br>was a really uh large uh collaborative<br>effort with people who know much more<br>about River restoration than I do and<br>I'm grateful uh I was able to be<br>involved in this<br>work um so we uh postulated a few<br>assumptions to guide our res to to guide<br>our literature review uh we wanted to<br>understand how some of these restoration<br>methods might be applicable to uh what<br>we sort of estimated 27 large river<br>systems in New Zealand uh those are uh<br>rivers that are uh uh what we calling<br>seven order or greater um those are<br>lakes uh rivers that have huge<br>watersheds where a lot of a lot of<br>tributaries uh uh flow into the main<br>stem of that river that ultimately flows<br>out to the Sea we also included a a<br>range of six OD streams rivers in New<br>Zealand that flow out to sea and also<br>have flood plan areas um and um yeah we<br>wanted to uh we we we postulated that<br>currently uh in New Zealand um the<br>restoration efforts are largely focused<br>on small rivers and streams and we<br>wanted to understand large scale River<br>restoration um um methods and um we<br>wanted to understand how aspirational<br>goals will likely uh will will be<br>achieved and we um postulated that it<br>will likely require some pretty large<br>scale restoration<br>efforts okay so the expected<br>Effectiveness and achievability um<br>coming out of the literature review uh<br>varied um as you would expect among<br>restoration methods summarized in this<br>table using this traffic light scheme<br>where we looked at um uh Effectiveness<br>achievability and sustainability and the<br>confidence level that we might have in<br>terms of applying some of these methods<br>in New Zealand um some restoration<br>methods such as uh enhancing wastewater<br>treatment plans usually address a very<br>narrow range of impacts but have a<br>comparably high feasibility uh because<br>we know exactly what to do they're<br>engineered systems we know how to<br>optimize these systems<br>um and other methods such as Wetland<br>creation or restoration uh addresses<br>multiple impacts which is great but uh<br>they usually have a a potentially and<br>have a high potential Effectiveness but<br>can be very hard to realize uh at the<br>necessary spatial scale to achieve those<br>uh desired outcomes um so the given that<br>the W River faces a range of impacts<br>this table highlights that uh generally<br>uh a suit of methods need to be uh<br>implemented and are required to achieve<br>multiple objectives so um I think I'm<br>putting up a couple of examples here<br>that we uh that came out of the<br>literature review this is a restoration<br>work done at the done uh in the danu<br>river uh which flows through my old home<br>as well in Germany um where the WWF is<br>heavily involved and provides a lot of<br>funding for this restoration uh this is<br>the Delta of the danub river where um<br>the channel realignment was carried out<br>and agriculture was the inant the uh<br>intensified so they're calling that<br>extensive agriculture uh where uh which<br>can take several shapes and form but has<br>very low impact on the surrounding land<br>and the receiving water bodies uh this<br>is an uh um connection of marsh back to<br>the main stem of the river uh using a<br>nature-based solution without hard<br>engineering where you're trying to uh<br>reinstate the natural inundation regime<br>in that Marsh which now provides<br>fantastic spawning habitat for fish in<br>that<br>River um the costs and time scales<br>associated with those rest ation methods<br>vary substantially and there's often a<br>very poor understanding of how costs and<br>benefits of uh restoration varies<br>amongst time scale um so accounting for<br>this sort of variable variability is<br>very challenging in uh and it came<br>through in all of the case studies um<br>during restoration<br>planning um and there's often uh not<br>sufficient long-term implications are<br>often not sufficiently uh considered<br>especially at multi- decadal or sort of<br>time scales of centuries uh which which<br>are often required to really achieve<br>some of the benefits from these<br>restoration methods um increasing so<br>carbon in pet lens for example uh um has<br>potential for huge impact but we can't<br>predict the efficiency and effectiveness<br>of those uh at a multitud c time scale<br>um evaluating long-term SC long long<br>time scales is important though um<br>especially uh if we consider that the uh<br>that implementation of some of these<br>restoration methods might result in<br>almost a lockin uh geomorphologically um<br>in terms of the way the the river uh uh<br>flow regime is managed or any other<br>management regime and we don't want some<br>of these restoration me measures to lock<br>Us in for decades to come um and<br>potentially constraining future uh um um<br>work um so I think uh a lot of lot of<br>these restoration um activities from<br>overseas especially large scale<br>restoration activities have implemented<br>some fairly sophisticated spal spal<br>planning tools and we've learned about<br>some of these potential spatial planning<br>tools earlier today from uh Joe Martin<br>and David um and I think there's a<br>potent there's there's huge potential<br>for for the white cutle uh uh uh River<br>of you know in terms of the these<br>agencies that are involved in the<br>restoration of the wut river to<br>implement or develop those spatial<br>planning tools to give us better<br>understanding of when and where some of<br>these restoration measures might need to<br>be implemented and what the expected<br>outcomes might be<br>um and I'm also curious to see how some<br>of these spatial planning tools can<br>actually integrate matong gamari going<br>forward I'm sorry yeah I'm speeding up<br>going sorry last slide then anyway so um<br>just really wanted to sort of draw a few<br>conclusions here um so I think from what<br>we've heard over the last couple of days<br>uh the collective efforts in flood plan<br>and River restoration and W cat are very<br>commendable uh from what I've presented<br>here I can see that almost like<br>basically all of the restoration<br>activities will contribute to the<br>overall goal um and I'm obviously<br>focused I focused on some of the Native<br>fish uh um um Dynamics today but I think<br>ultimately um reconnecting Wetlands<br>restoring uh gullies all contribute to<br>to that same goal um questions remain um<br>especially with uh regards to how we can<br>systematically scale up restoration<br>efforts to uh tackle some of the very<br>difficult aspects of flood plane<br>restoration um and the one question I<br>had for you uh for all of you is really<br>uh given that our knowledge of the<br>system has changed some of the<br>aspirations and the demands on the<br>system have changed since the flood<br>protection scheme was<br>built um with all of this knowledge<br>would we redesign would we design the<br>flood protection scheme in the same<br>way<br>and um if the answer is no to that how<br>would we design it and how can we future<br>proove it so with that I thank you very<br>much just getting some last minute<br>instructions um<br>Gano we're not going to be uh taking any<br>questions uh for this session um we will<br>answer all of those questions online as<br>best we can uh and we'll we'll share it<br>with the experts but yeah can we have<br>one more round of applause for our for<br>me this will be the last time you'll<br>hear my voice sadly and um we want to<br>talk a bit about um Brendan Brendan's<br>one of those guys when we're doing the<br>river settlement is one of my lecturers<br>um but also alongside other people he's<br>like one of those guys that was<br>alongside the Jac days of the world and<br>the Charlie Mitchells who sadly passed<br>away in 2016 I think you know the white<br>bait leaders the eel leaders the ones<br>that looked after us and taught uh some<br>of us one here here today so I want to<br>want to thank you for your cordor and<br>when you spoke about the tuna bylaws one<br>of the cool things we noticed when we<br>did the<br>settlement was that um we GA the<br>commercial elas and we we had them meet<br>in Manu Cordo just over here and and we<br>had asked them and Nicholas had said we<br>we're going to drop the maximum size<br>from 4 kgs to two and they talked about<br>it and I happened to walk past we gave<br>them some time and one of them says we<br>have to listen they're in charge now I<br>was like oh won't tell them we're not um<br>but we took it and the gains were<br>immediate 3 months later we get an email<br>with a picture of 375 kgs of eel they<br>had to put back because it was over 2<br>kgs in size and so for us you can't get<br>some immediate impacts in this<br>environmental game so um thank you for<br>your cordal and Julia AR really joyes my<br>my wife did her Masters in economics and<br>I learned economics wasn't about money<br>and all these other things it was about<br>people's behavior and so um all the<br>things you spoke about probably if there<br>was a case study around the social<br>impact of T mana on the people here<br>would be really useful we've seen mind<br>shifts uh we've seen things like you've<br>said have now become the norm um we're<br>talking about things that would have<br>been hard for us to speak about TI M<br>cultural things and put it into a place<br>an environmental court for example and<br>now it's becoming an everyday discussion<br>and people are people are um I suppose<br>we're creating a social Norm as you said<br>we'll leave the trading uh property<br>rights for another<br>discussion um but what one one point<br>there at a national level the land and<br>water Forum said the government needs to<br>resolve rights and interest to fresh<br>water an allocation needs to be<br>determined for E because the rest of the<br>country wants certainty so if it's going<br>to happen do it and so um you know we're<br>fortunate enough to to have and I are<br>here now who's uh been brave um and<br>providing those opportunities for E Mii<br>um then sorry there we had to had to Peg<br>you back a little bit um he's also one<br>of the project Steering group members<br>for this whole Symposium so thank you um<br>River Scapes I love it when science kind<br>of affirms or or or reconfirms the<br>things that here we talk about<br>connectivity between water bodies um<br>when we were speaking of the clam Alman<br>poano said we know it's in K but there's<br>a connection there in the White River<br>and you can't see it but it's something<br>there and it's it might be under water<br>so I love it seeing all those<br>connectivity um<br>biodiversity uh pictures you're putting<br>up because it demonstrates uh um that<br>that we we're seeing the same things<br>your question your last question was um<br>would we do the flood protection scheme<br>different yes I don't know what it looks<br>like and the reason was in 1999 uh we<br>had this young young young man come from<br>R Regional Council they were develop<br>developing the low Wako flood protection<br>scheme and we took we happened to be a<br>Hoku Yi and as we went down they got the<br>the ash ponds but also some of the flood<br>protection scheme uh you know that's<br>lifting up and the chief tumate mahut<br>come over and said I want you uh I built<br>my house so I could see my a you've put<br>Ash Pon there and now you're putting a<br>flood protection scheme in the way<br>you're putting these high things so his<br>goal for us was to remove those<br>eventually so that they could have that<br>connection back to our Tong so yeah<br>we'll do it another way a different way<br>uh but I don't know what that looks like<br>um so I'm going to finish up while I am<br>done I do want to acknowledge p p is<br>both uh humor in a different way than I<br>uh has brought humor to this whole qual<br>we both had a role to try and Link all<br>of these discussions and we both did it<br>differently but he brought energy and I<br>just want to acknowledge Him um for for<br>all the Mah he's done uh uh for the<br>preparation for keeping us entertained<br>and keeping our energy levels High and<br>um if you need him please contact him<br>and you'll you've seen what he's like so<br>give we have a round of applause for<br>part<br>please now as everyone else has had T<br>presented to them um if I could have two<br>t Douglas come down and and prepare to<br>present our Tonga to our three panel<br>members if he could jump in the front<br>front here we'll get a nice photo lovely<br>if you can get this in the background<br>toah is K for policy and strategy at the<br>W Regional Council who are also one of<br>the supporters and sponsors of the<br>Symposium py py<br>mate as they doing the uh stay close as<br>they're doing the um getting their photo<br>ready uh I do want to thank without<br>saying too many names everyone that's<br>been involved in providing for today as<br>I reflect game back from 2006 from that<br>Kaki form where we're trying to figure<br>out what engagement looks like where<br>we're trying to figure out best practice<br>and then moving into discussions we've<br>heard yesterday about multi-million<br>dollar restoration projects it's<br>impressive and I'm glad I got to see it<br>in my lifetime being 32 years old and so<br>it's it's wonderful but<br>to<br>um but but to um also to uh everyone<br>that's organized us but our sponsors for<br>woni for hosting us here and and looking<br>after us as usual with Kai andak to<br>Mercury for your support uh for the our<br>Symposium as well and you always seem to<br>be side by side with our ewi in<br>particular over the last 20 years which<br>shows that we don't need a consent to<br>have a relationship so thank you very<br>much um to the Regional Council uh not<br>just just here with the Symposium but<br>the technical advice you provide to all<br>of the E up and down our river system um<br>so you do all the hard thinking and and<br>we can um access your material and use<br>it to provide make our submissions our<br>statements to protect our ow as well but<br>also for the simposium and to oh man<br>I'll write it down it's right in front<br>of me to T the University of w our major<br>P I'll hand you over to part<br>today bye to py for Julian as well done<br>an awesome<br>job uh he's absolutely right we we both<br>come in here with a role and I gave him<br>a call and he says oh bro do you want to<br>you can just do the whole thing and I<br>was<br>like and that's how we talked back home<br>inle no very far out I say you're the<br>one who went to<br>Cuda you're the one who's worked in that<br>space and I'll just do my thing and then<br>you can wrap up all the cordal because<br>you're you know you're in touch and and<br>you know what all of this stuff is about<br>and I thought that work well between<br>us and thanks for as my<br>brother<br>for<br>for<br>uh<br>for<br>right the<br>honorable<br>can I acknowledge and thank the riv<br>Authority um friends and who you know<br>there's something altogether disturbing<br>when they say come and have a listen to<br>something in next minute can you have a<br>c that's what happens when you think<br>you're uh uh coming back to just have a<br>nice uh retiring opportunity at home but<br>can I thank the river Authority can I<br>also thank the uh sponsors of this 2023<br>Symposium and the opportunity that you<br>have to uh continue a different<br>conversation blessed are they whose who<br>plant trees and whose shade we may never<br>um experience and when I think back to<br>2010 and the river settlement and some<br>of the architecture and the thinking<br>that informed uh our mother's uh<br>thoughts about the river settlement and<br>what it might provide it was all in the<br>realm of possibility and intention<br>because things were hard nobody had<br>really negotiated a settlement that had<br>an intergenerational benefit or that<br>talked about the health and well-being<br>the protection and restoration of the<br>most used River in the country or even<br>fathomed that you could bring two<br>potentially disparate interests local<br>government and E together to make<br>decisions with a collective view in mind<br>but some of the architecture was<br>informed by another model down in the<br>South Island which you might be Familiar<br>of with uh which is the fieldand<br>Guardians trust so those of you who have<br>had the great privilege to visit that<br>area will know why uh the way in which<br>uh the fieldand is looked after is done<br>with an<br>intergenerational um uh mindset there<br>were two things things two critical<br>learnings that came out of the uh the<br>visit down there which I think informed<br>very much a lot of uh what our mother<br>believed within the context of this<br>settlement one in order to ensure that<br>we were going to<br>preserve uh something of such great<br>treasure to all of us um in very<br>tangible ways it wasn't what you did<br>today or tomorrow it was what you were<br>going to keep doing for the next<br>generation and the generation after so<br>having an inter generational U mindset<br>was absolutely key but there was<br>something about the way that the<br>Guardians trust operated that she<br>believed if we could tral it here in in<br>uh along the river it would be magic and<br>that was to have decision<br>makers<br>eway local government with central<br>government committing to the<br>architecture of this particular<br>agreement who really thought Beyond<br>themselves and acted in a way where we<br>were working towards a common<br>conversation with a Common Language two<br>different perspectives yes but actually<br>one one goal and that whole idea of<br>gifts and gains for the next generation<br>was really important and was embedded<br>within the architecture of the river<br>settlement so we're some 13<br>years um since that time we're having<br>the conversation I think uh that she<br>would have imagined would be necessary<br>because we know that if you can't<br>measure it it's very difficult to try<br>and say what what else needs to be done<br>but the other thing is with M inserted<br>if you can't understand it then that's<br>going to be difficult as well but we<br>have the great Fortune right now to be<br>able to acknowledge on the E side of the<br>Leer with the gold claim who actually<br>raising the conscience of all members of<br>the community about what a detrimental<br>impact that has on River we have our Foo<br>down at maturu who are planting we have<br>lots of Foo participating in riparian<br>planting not just of the river but its<br>tribute trees as well and we also have a<br>Faro who I and I I see them on my<br>Facebook you know who I call Par<br>Champions who are just volunteering<br>their time to clean up the river in very<br>tangible<br>ways and there are more things there are<br>more things on that side and then there<br>many of you in this room scientists who<br>are offering and lending your insights<br>your knowledge quantifying what the G<br>the demonstrable gains are and can be<br>over time and the way that you share<br>that knowledge helps us but I know<br>that's one thing to be true because<br>we're having a conversation about the<br>benefit for the river and what's<br>required we can only but continue to<br>move forward and with all respect to<br>policy makers a respect perspective of<br>the policy of the day because a vision<br>and strategy to 2 Mana holds us to<br>account to each other's objectives for<br>the wle river and its catchment so in<br>many ways the gains humble as they may<br>be for the W cutle River can be<br>transferred and adopted by any other<br>eway should they choose to draw from its<br>um its evidence or indeed other<br>indigenous groups should they choose to<br>draw from our learnings here and that's<br>as it should be so in my mind I think<br>the conversations that you've had over<br>the last two days I understand um have<br>not only been insightful insightful<br>they've been Rich they have context and<br>they have<br>purpose and for that as a member of<br>white cutle we are truly grateful for<br>your contribution and your own ongoing<br>commitment to have a different<br>conversation that's what our kids need<br>that's what our moper need<br>is to to have this different mindset<br>about how we work together to improve<br>the health and the wellbeing the<br>protection and the restoration of our<br>Rivers our waterways and everything that<br>gives life to us<br>here so it comes down to<br>leadership and in my mind the leadership<br>that's required has to be values and<br>formed if we don't have that we're going<br>to be driven by process and policies and<br>things like that you don't need<br>politicians to be leaders you need<br>Community people you need Everyday<br>People to be a part of that value<br>proposition about what it is that is so<br>important to us it is right here in<br>front of us and we've got to look after<br>it you<br>know I've I'm going to be really<br>cautious the next time I accept the<br>invitation to just come and sit down and<br>have a listen outside but it's truly my<br>pleasure to be here today and just offer<br>some small<br>thoughts and thank you to all the of the<br>river Authority and everyone else that<br>have put on thisa for for us all to<br>benefit<br>from<br>for<br>for<br>thank you so much uh everyone uh for<br>your participation in this awesome uh<br>and no doubt there'll be plenty of more<br>future I just want to remind us that the<br>biggest takeway from all of this is that<br>we must work collaboratively in order to<br>and<br>for so just remember those T little<br>lessons from our T to remind us that we<br>must work together in order uh to<br>achieve our goals so one more time at<br>the<br>fin Abes together strong<br>okay all<br>right<br>foree<br>now<br>GL<br>now<br>cor<br>now<br>Gia<br>be<br>safe</p></main><footer style="margin-top: 2rem; background: #0001; padding: 2rem; text-align: center;"><p>We Are The
