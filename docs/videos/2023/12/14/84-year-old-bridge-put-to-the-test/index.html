Funded by Toka TÅ« Ake EQC and QuakeCoRE, the research will help inform future earthquake response planning.</p><h2>Transcript</h2><p style="opacity: 0.9; font-size: 0.8em">Transcripts may be automatically generated and may not be 100% accurate.</p><p>so I'm Lucas Hogan I'm a senior lecturer<br>in the civil and environmental<br>engineering department at the University<br>of Auckland and the project that we have<br>here is looking at the resilience of<br>existing bridges on the New Zealand<br>state highway Network so with the<br>testing that we're doing here what we<br>did is extract out uh existing Bridge<br>columns from uh Bridget was being<br>demolished Bridget was about 85 years<br>old and it happened to be a really good<br>representation of many other bridges on<br>the state highway Network so we bring it<br>into the lab and we put it on our strong<br>floor uh and we push and pull on it to<br>simulate an earthquake and if we<br>understand how this bridge behaves it<br>really gives us great insight into how<br>similar Bridges um around the state<br>highway Network would behave and really<br>how resilient are they to an earthquake<br>and How likely are they to be able to<br>function and get Emergency Services<br>across allow people and communities to<br>uh recover quickly after an event uh my<br>name is an toy Bal I am a PhD student<br>here at the University of Auckland the<br>bridge is the AI load that's going down<br>on it is going to be 30 tons on either<br>column so 60 tons in total and then<br>we're pushing on it with a force up to<br>this one got to 28 tons I think the<br>highest we've seen is 30 tons getting<br>pushed onto one of them and so I am<br>actually putting in just the the<br>distance that I want to push it out to<br>so I'm not messing with the force I just<br>say this is how far we want to push it<br>out and then I put that in actuator<br>pushes it and it gets a reading of the<br>force and then that<br>displacement after that we go up of this<br>is left and we actually start measuring<br>what happened that's a lot of that<br>qualitative analysis so looking at how<br>big these cracks are what is different<br>in this Bridge versus the last one<br>measure all that we map it out so we<br>actually have it drawn for each one of<br>these then we go down and we do it again<br>so the retrofit solution that we're<br>looking on is um the idea is to try to<br>contain uh the concrete so as the con as<br>the bridge peers are moving back and<br>forth uh the concrete's pushing down and<br>it wants to spall out and so the idea is<br>to provide some containment to that just<br>like you would uh the steel belts on a<br>wine barrel and this is called uh<br>jacketing and jacketing of bridge<br>columns has been used for many decades<br>uh overseas and in New Zealand it works<br>really really well the challenge with<br>traditional jacketing is that it's<br>expensive um and so if you have sort of<br>an overpass style bridge where you have<br>you know one to four columns that you<br>have to jacket and that's the only thing<br>which is providing resistance to the<br>earthquake yeah it's worth spending all<br>resilience</p></main><footer style="margin-top: 2rem; background: #0001; padding: 2rem; text-align: center;"><p>We Are The University</p><ul style="list-style-type: none; padding: 0; margin: 0;"><li><a href="/">Home</a></li><li><a href="/about">About</a></li><li><a href="/contact">Contact</a></li></ul></footer></body></html>
