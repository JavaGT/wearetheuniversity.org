The talk will cover a variety of research projects including the implementation of the ‘What Works’ policy into a Welsh Probation Area, the legal and ethical aspects of sex offender treatment, why British South Asian women don’t report sexual abuse and finally her current work on the health and wellbeing of prison staff. Throughout these varied topics there is a thread of justice – ensuring that offenders are treated ethically and with dignity; that victims have the ability to seek the help they need regardless of the barriers they encounter; and that prison staff feel safe and supported in their working environments. Karen’s interactions with external partners and the impact that her research has had, will also be included.<br><br>Karen Harrison is a Professor of Law and Penal Justice in Lincoln Law School and the Director of the Lincoln Centre for Crime and Justice. She graduated with a Ph.D. from the University of Wales - Aberystwyth in 2004 and over the last 20 years has established a national and international profile in sentencing, penal policy, and offender management. She has written extensively on the legal and ethical implications of risk reduction and management strategies with high-risk sex offenders, often writing with criminologists and psychologists. Karen has completed several funded empirical studies including one looking at why British South Asian women fail to report sexual abuse and another examining the implementation of Body-Worn Cameras in Humberside Police. She is currently working on a project looking at EDI workplace experiences with Prison Governors in collaboration with the Prison Governors Association. She is the author of Dangerousness, Risk and the Governance of Serious Sexual and Violent Offenders (2011), and the editor of Managing High Risk Sex Offenders in The Community (2010) and The Wiley-Blackwell Handbook of Legal and Ethical Aspects of Sex Offender Treatment and Management (2013). Her most recent books are Penology: Theory, Policy, and Practice (2020), The Law Relating to Financial Crime in the UK (2022) and due out in 2024, Work, Culture and Wellbeing Among Prison Governors in England and Wales.</p><h2>Transcript</h2><p style="opacity: 0.9; font-size: 0.8em">Transcripts may be automatically generated and may not be 100% accurate.</p><p>when I was thinking about um what type<br>of lecture I was going to give tonight I<br>think generally there's two types of<br>lectures there is the I'm going to give<br>you a research presentation or there is<br>the journey which makes me sound like a<br>big brother contestant um but I decided<br>that I was going to do the journey one<br>and I was going to talk about as Richard<br>said the the kind of the the diversity<br>um of the projects that I've been<br>involved in but I think when you make<br>that decision that you're going to do<br>that Journey the next decision is well<br>where do I begin so I thought well I<br>could tell you and not many people know<br>this that I was born in Essex girlo I<br>could tell you that three of the first<br>four years of my life I lived in<br>Nigeria and then the next seven years of<br>my life I lived here in Lincoln but I<br>thought that was just too ridiculous to<br>go back that far so I thought I really<br>should start in abis mid Wales which is<br>where I did my undergraduate law degree<br>but I think more important tonight where<br>I did my PhD now I'm not going to talk<br>about my PhD in any great detail but<br>I'll just give you a flavor um of the<br>type of thing um that I was looking at<br>so it was a funded scholarship which I<br>was really grateful to have and it was<br>looking at the implementation of the<br>what works policy now this was<br>1999 to set the scene um the what works<br>policy was a home office initiative<br>initially they were going to tell us<br>what worked with probation and in fact<br>there was a question mark after what<br>works because they were that confident<br>that they were going to tell us the<br>question mark disappeared as time went<br>on because they realized they just<br>couldn't tell us um but what I was doing<br>I was focusing on one Welsh probation<br>area DVID um and I had four probation<br>offices I spent a day in each of them<br>for the best part of a year so abber<br>iswith Kenley Karan and haford West and<br>I had 12 case studies of offenders who<br>were been supervised by probation<br>starting at their pre-sentence report<br>and then I followed them as best as I<br>could um through their probation orders<br>and it was at the time a really<br>interesting time in probation because it<br>was at that time where they would well<br>the home office were trying to shift<br>them from being a social work agency<br>based on advice assist and befriend to a<br>much more law enforcement agency and<br>there were some people who were more<br>willing to shift than others let's say<br>that but I think really um why I wanted<br>to mention my PhD was not so much about<br>the topic but it was my apprenticeship<br>it was where I learned how to be a<br>researcher um I was very fortunate the<br>first six months was research training<br>um I learned how to use SPSS I have<br>never used it since but I have actually<br>been trained on SPSS but I think really<br>what it meant to me was I knew that<br>criminal justice was my area area I knew<br>I loved Empirical research I loved going<br>out into the field and finding out that<br>original research now there's nothing<br>wrong with sitting in the library but I<br>realized that really wasn't for me and I<br>love working with people and partners<br>and I think you might get as we go<br>through tonight I haven't stayed on one<br>single topic I just like the idea moving<br>and learning um it does mean I am quite<br>often outside of my comfort zone but I<br>think that's a nice thing about being in<br>Academia that you can push your<br>boundaries so um Rich has kind of done<br>this already for me but these are the<br>just a a hint of the the diverse things<br>that I've covered over the last 20 years<br>so started in probation um then I moved<br>on to look at sex offended treatment and<br>managers management that kind of led<br>into a general um looking at dangerous<br>offenders I have dabbled in financial<br>crime um looked<br>at they were a bit slow on there weren<br>you um looked at why British South Asian<br>women and girls don't disclose sexual<br>abuse did the evaluation on the<br>implementation of body War cameras in<br>humberside<br>police finally did one of those bucket<br>lists wrote a penology textbook and then<br>more recently have been focused on the<br>health and well-being of Staff now<br>clearly I couldn't talk about all of<br>those um so I've chosen three um and I<br>think again when I was trying to write<br>the summary for this lecture I thought<br>right let's choose three that's probably<br>manageable so I chose these three and<br>then I thought well you're going to have<br>to find the link they want a title if<br>nothing else and it almost amazed me<br>that there was a link I think previously<br>I had thought that things were so<br>diverse that I didn't really know what<br>my main theme was but I think it is<br>Justice I think it is about trying to<br>ensure that those people who are in some<br>way linked with the criminal justice<br>system they are treated fairly they are<br>treated um equitably<br>so the first project that I'm going to<br>have a look at or I'm going to talk to<br>you about is the legal and ethical<br>aspects of sex offender<br>treatment so I'm going to set the<br>scene I just finished my PhD um I was in<br>my second job which was at UWE in<br>Bristol I had published one article from<br>my PhD because my PhD was out of date<br>before I even had my viver so from a<br>point of view of publishing from it it<br>was just a<br>disaster um and I was doing um prep for<br>teaching I was teaching a penology<br>course and I can't explain why but I<br>decided we needed to cover sex offenders<br>in this course and I was looking at well<br>what works with sex offenders and I<br>guess that was a Remnant from my PhD<br>what works in offender management and I<br>was looking at the highrisk sex offender<br>strategy and at that time there was<br>mappa which is a multi- agency public<br>protection approach so lots of agencies<br>working together but that was very<br>communitybased there was a sex offender<br>register but certainly not how we see it<br>um today and there was sex offender<br>treatment programs but really the<br>evidence on those was that it was<br>working with low and medium to risk<br>offenders but not so much with high-risk<br>offenders so then I was thinking well<br>what else is there out there I'm not<br>going to go into the details so no need<br>for men to worry about this but was<br>surgical castration an option did it<br>work and certainly the evidence<br>suggested yes it did but not really an<br>option in the sense of Human Rights and<br>you know aspects like that so I was<br>interested in finding well what else was<br>there out<br>there so<br>I found this<br>option that at the beginning I referred<br>to as chemical castration so this is the<br>use of drugs to achieve the same effects<br>of surgical castration now I'm going to<br>talk about anti-androgens which are the<br>hormonal drugs you can achieve minimal<br>effects through anti-depressants ssris<br>but I'm not going to focus on those um<br>too much but basically the anti<br>androgens they work by tricking the<br>brain into believing that the body<br>already has enough testosterone so that<br>it doesn't produce anymore to give you<br>an example um in America um the drug<br>that is used is Depo proa which is the<br>birth control pill so it is about<br>changing the hormone levels in a man to<br>effectively make them more feminine um<br>in<br>nature the evidence although a lot of it<br>is on quite small case studies the<br>evidence is that it can work it does<br>reduce um sexual desires sexual<br>fantasies and importantly it also<br>improves concentration so if we're<br>talking about sex offender treatment<br>programs let's get somebody into a<br>position where they're able to<br>concentrate on a treatment program<br>before we actually um use that treatment<br>with<br>them so positive<br>potentially one of the real problems<br>with this is it has a large number of<br>side effects and probably we don't know<br>what the full list of those side effects<br>are I've put some of them um on the<br>screen so weight gain severe headaches<br>hypoglycemia hypertension diabetes liver<br>function osteoporosis is they're quite<br>serious side effects and feminization<br>and by that I mean breast growth and<br>that can be really um problematic and<br>I'm going to talk about that in a bit<br>more detail<br>later I also looked at well who else is<br>using it and it's quite broadly used<br>America and Germany are probably the two<br>main countries um who were using it but<br>as I've put on the slide a lot of<br>European countries we using it so this<br>paper here came out in<br>2007 um and it's not a title I don't<br>think anybody really wants but for a<br>while I became the castration girl um<br>and I think it's because no one was<br>really writing about this at the time<br>certainly a lawyer wasn't writing about<br>it and it was round about this time that<br>the home office while they were just<br>becoming the ministry of Justice they<br>were thinking what do we need to do as<br>part of our high-risk sex offender<br>strategy and I was contacted in 2008 by<br>the ministry of Justice told that this<br>paper had gone into the House of Commons<br>library and that they had used it in<br>their review um on the protection of<br>children from sex offenders and<br>developing or thinking about using drugs<br>was one of the actions I think it was<br>action six off the top of my head so I I<br>think this was probably the first time<br>that I thought that actually something<br>that I did may have or may have the<br>potential to have influence I'm<br>certainly not suggesting this paper<br>influenced them in any way shape or form<br>but it did make me think that actually<br>what we do it isn't just sitting in our<br>Ivory Towers it can have an impact um on<br>The Wider world as well but it also made<br>me realize that timing is Absolut Ely<br>crucial if this had been<br>published a year later then you know I<br>would have missed the<br>boat now when I did this um article I<br>sent it off to the Howard journal and<br>they said yes great but what about the<br>human rights aspects and I thought yeah<br>you're right but you're not going to<br>give me another another seven and a half<br>thousand words to write about that so um<br>this is where I started working with<br>bernardet Rainey so I knew Bernie from<br>abber iswith she was there doing her<br>postdoc when I was doing my PhD and<br>Bernie is a human rights lawyer so I<br>thought well rather than me learning<br>lots and lots about human rights why<br>don't I go to a human rights lawyer um<br>so Bernie's area is on particularly on<br>excluded groups and the rights of<br>excluded groups her PhD was on Refugee G<br>and I kind of brought her into the sex<br>offender World um really so what we were<br>looking at started just with chemical<br>castration the use of drugs and then<br>went wider in terms of General um<br>treatment and management options so we<br>were looking at<br>legally can we use these things but even<br>if legally we can should we be using<br>these<br>things so over the next<br>eight years and that quite staggered me<br>that it was eight years but over the<br>next eight years we published quite<br>widely um I guess the first article was<br>probably our main kind of entrance into<br>the world um we went to quite a few um<br>sex offender um conferences I met Todd<br>at one of them um and we kind of entered<br>into the world of psychology which was<br>quite scary as lawyers um I I think one<br>of the reasons we were asked to write so<br>much was because and the psychologist<br>Clos your ears I just don't think you'd<br>really thought about the legal aspects I<br>think it it was something new for people<br>to hear in terms of you know should we<br>be doing this ethically is this<br>something we should be doing even though<br>we know um that potentially it can um<br>work so I can't in the time that I've<br>got tell you everything that obviously<br>we wrote over those eight years but I<br>thought I would just run through um some<br>of our main<br>arguments so one of the things that we<br>looked at in quite a lot of depth was<br>consent now I said earlier that um the<br>use of drugs is used in America in some<br>states it's mandatory and we said that<br>it should never ever be mandatory it<br>should be a voluntary Choice mainly due<br>to the side effects whether somebody<br>decides to participate um in this type<br>of<br>treatment even the home office when they<br>published the review um of protection<br>against CH for children they said it<br>should be free and informed and that's<br>quite important that we're looking at<br>consent that is free and informed and<br>certainly putting my lawyer hat on if we<br>look at the European committee for the<br>prevention of torture that says that all<br>interventions need to be free and<br>informed<br>consent so what do we mean by informed<br>consent so we<br>argued people need to be told what the<br>drugs are they need to be told what will<br>happen why they're on these drugs what<br>these drugs will do certainly what the<br>side effects are what length of time<br>they're on these drugs for what the<br>benefits and also importantly they<br>should be able to have the ability to<br>withdraw at any<br>stage importantly there cannot be any<br>coercion involved and this is why we've<br>always argued this cannot be linked to a<br>punishment in America for example in<br>some states if you agree to go on these<br>drugs you either may get a reduction in<br>your sentence you get a community order<br>rather than prison or they will decide<br>to release you from prison and we've<br>always said that's wrong because that's<br>coercion because what you'll then doing<br>is choosing the lesser of two evils<br>rather than making an informed<br>decision we also looked at mental health<br>law and I'm going to cover this very<br>briefly but under our current mental<br>health law we can um section somebody<br>who we diagnose as as a<br>pedophile it used to be the case until<br>the 2007 amendments that pedophilia was<br>excluded from the ability to do that but<br>that is no longer the case I'm not<br>saying it happens often but under the<br>law absolutely we can do that and that's<br>really problematic I think more so<br>because the test no longer is<br>treatability it's now about appropriate<br>treatment and you know that can be quite<br>subjective in terms of<br>appropriateness and then we moved on to<br>look at rights and really Bernie's area<br>is this idea of dignity in living a<br>dignified life and I'm well aware that<br>depending on the audience that you are<br>talking to telling people that sex<br>offenders particularly high risk child<br>sex offenders telling people that they<br>have rights is not always is well<br>received but actually irrelevant of what<br>you have done however dangerous you are<br>you do have rights under the European<br>Convention of Human Rights so looking at<br>article three for example so that is an<br>absolute right it's not something that a<br>state can derogate from and that's<br>torture inhuman or degrading treatment<br>and just thinking about those side<br>effects that I mentioned before<br>feminization the growth of<br>breasts that can be viewed as degrading<br>and when the court looks at what is<br>degrading that can be just in the eyes<br>of the individual so if I think<br>something is degrading that is seen as<br>sufficient it doesn't have to be<br>degrading in other people's eyes as well<br>so really what we said here was that<br>there is the potential for this to<br>breach article 3 depending on the<br>individual depending on whether they've<br>view this as degrading but it also<br>depends on consent if somebody has<br>freely non-<br>coercively in an informed way given<br>consent then this probably isn't um a<br>problem article 8 and 12 um I'm going to<br>put those together I've just looked at<br>what the time is I'm going to put those<br>together and that was looking at um<br>article8 respect for private family life<br>in article 12 right to found a family<br>and very similar comments there is the<br>potential for these rights to be engaged<br>it all depends on consent it all depends<br>on whether this is viewed as a treatment<br>rather than as a punishment and I think<br>really what our feelings were is that<br>this had to be a medical decision this<br>couldn't be a decision for judges um to<br>make consent had to be informed and non<br>coerced and as I've said it couldn't be<br>linked um to<br>punishment so after we've kind of done<br>that we kind of felt that we'd said<br>everything that we wanted to say and I<br>was kind of looking for a new project<br>so this was not necessarily the next one<br>but this is the next one that I want to<br>focus on um<br>tonight so again not on my own um so<br>this time I was working with Professor<br>Aisha Gil she's currently at the<br>University of Bristol she was in rampton<br>at the time um Aisha and I met at both<br>our first jobs so we both started at cry<br>University we were doing a teacher<br>training um thing and we sat there and<br>realized that we had similar interests<br>and we'd spent years trying to work<br>together but had never quite achieved it<br>um her background is looking at<br>generally domestic violence um in black<br>and minority ethnic um communities<br>Refugee um communities as well and I<br>guess my background was more sexual<br>violence so we decided that we were<br>going to try and combine and see whether<br>um we could bring both our interests<br>together so our project funded by the<br>British Academy um and it was a while<br>ago so this is 2013 to<br>2015 but really exciting thing for me<br>was this was back in the field this was<br>back going out talking to people working<br>with Charities um and<br>NOS so we spent a lot of time collecting<br>data so we had four focus groups um with<br>women who were all survivors um of<br>sexual violence two in the Midlands one<br>in the north of England one in the South<br>and overall we spoke to about 85 women<br>now now two of these were pre-existing<br>groups so they were groups that were<br>happening anyway one was a knitting<br>group with one was a coffee morning and<br>we just went in and we spoke to them and<br>I still have visions now of Aisha<br>running around this room with the<br>dictaphone trying to get you know as<br>many um people um talking as possible so<br>yeah so we did four focus groups with<br>women and that was just trying to get<br>the general view on why women in British<br>South Asian community communities<br>weren't disclosing sexual abuse we then<br>held two focus groups with Community<br>Representatives um one with religious<br>leaders from mosques as you can imagine<br>that was very interesting um one with um<br>Community leaders and again one group um<br>was based in the Midlands and one in the<br>north of<br>England in addition to those focus<br>groups we had interviews with 13 women<br>all whom had um sought help from<br>Charities um so all of them had been<br>survivors of sexual violence some had<br>been born in the UK some had um come<br>over to the UK on spousal<br>visas um some had experienced historical<br>sexual abuse um and some had experienced<br>it more<br>recently and then we spoke to 26<br>professionals um 13 of those worked in<br>the Charities that were helping these<br>women and then we spoke to a number of<br>police officers um a Senior Chief<br>prosecutor and a number of um policy<br>officers so we were really trying to get<br>a very broad view of what were the<br>experiences um of these women what were<br>the barriers that were preventing them<br>from disclosing sexual<br>abuse there were lots of barri barers um<br>and I I won't go into all of them now<br>but just to highlight um some of them<br>for some people it was they didn't speak<br>English so it was quite difficult to go<br>into a police station or into a support<br>agency to seek that help um for others<br>um normally they would use their<br>children to translate or to help them to<br>communicate and they weren't going to be<br>sharing those experiences um with their<br>children<br>some assumed that all police were men<br>and therefore didn't want to have to<br>have those<br>conversations others it was down to<br>modesty they didn't want to use the<br>vocabulary the language that they would<br>have to use to be able to get those<br>views across and the main one really in<br>terms of that was culture this idea that<br>it it wasn't something that you you took<br>outside of the community we were looking<br>at at um what was the um the the<br>communities that offenders on the<br>register were from looking at offending<br>rates and it would appear that sexual<br>violence is very low in the British<br>South Asian Community we kind of assumed<br>that wasn't true but rather it was being<br>kept in the community rather than you<br>know being taken out to the criminal<br>justice<br>agencies another issue was physical<br>infrastructure the idea that some women<br>were only allowed to go to certain<br>places they were concerned about being<br>spotted um and reported back so it was a<br>real problem in well I can't go into a<br>police station I can't go into a<br>building that's obviously you know<br>women's Aid or or something like that so<br>for some that was a a problem as<br>well one of the other issues was just<br>just not knowing that what was happening<br>to them was a criminal offense so even<br>though marital rape I mean it's always<br>been rape but even though we explicitly<br>um know that since<br>1999 you can rape within a marriage this<br>wasn't something that the community were<br>aware of and I've put one of the quotes<br>up on there so women are told if your<br>husband wants to have marital relations<br>with you you shouldn't deny<br>him and again and this isn't just true<br>for the South Asian Community this is<br>true for all communities that fear of<br>not being believed whether that was fear<br>from the police fear from family um fear<br>from<br>friends but as I said really one of the<br>major barriers was culture and the idea<br>of um losing honor and then because of<br>that shame being brought upon you so um<br>um some of you may already be aware but<br>honor is key to South Asian cultural<br>norms and traditions so men are seen as<br>heads of the family and Defenders of the<br>um family's honor so females are quite<br>often seen as property resources and are<br>symbolic of the family's honor so in<br>that sense a family's honor is much more<br>important than an individual's interests<br>one of the things that I was really um<br>interested in um and Aisha was great in<br>terms of she understood the language and<br>she understood the culture um obviously<br>because she was from that culture was if<br>we think about the eru and Hindi words<br>which are used for rape they roughly<br>translate to I could not prevent him<br>from stealing my<br>honor and I think that's really<br>interesting interesting because it's<br>placing the responsibility on that<br>female rather than placing the<br>responsibility on the person that has<br>raped<br>them now once honna is lost it can never<br>be repaired so the chief prosecutor that<br>we<br>interviewed told us that top um quote<br>it's like if a white silk scarf is<br>dropped in mud it can be washed but it<br>will never be the same so honor is like<br>a mirror once it's broken it can never<br>be fixed and if you lose that honor you<br>then bring shame and you bring shame not<br>just onto yourself but you bring it onto<br>your siblings you bring it onto your<br>family your extended family and to some<br>extent onto your community as well so if<br>you are a female who has um experienced<br>sexual abuse use then you're not just<br>worried that you will not be married you<br>are also worried what effect or what<br>impact is going to have on your siblings<br>as well and as this quote says the shame<br>ripples out from the woman to their<br>families to their siblings in a way it<br>doesn't within any other<br>community and one of the things which<br>was surprising to me from somebody not<br>having grown up in that culture was I<br>went in thinking it was the men who<br>controlled this and it's not it's quite<br>often the Elder women in the communities<br>so one woman told me how if her daughter<br>came to her and disclosed that she had<br>been sexually abused she would tell her<br>we're not telling anybody because if you<br>go and report that I am a bad mom I have<br>allowed you to bring shame onto the<br>family and onto the community so in our<br>experience or certainly the people that<br>we were talking to they were telling us<br>that actually it was the women who were<br>the greater barriers um than the<br>men so we wanted to focus on well what<br>do we need to do to break down these<br>barriers and there's lots of things that<br>we can do a lot of it is about education<br>a lot of it is working with communities<br>with religious Leaders with Community<br>leaders to try and um prevent that<br>behavior to try and ensure that<br>everybody understands what the law is<br>what protection is available out there<br>what support is available out there but<br>also it's about making sure that the<br>support that is out in the communities<br>is accessible so we were told by one<br>charity it's not about them being hard<br>to reach it's about us being hard to<br>reach so they had an Outreach worker who<br>went and attached herself to the<br>knitting group to the coffee mornings<br>and she was kind of almost it sounds I<br>don't mean this but she kind of<br>infiltrated she was from the community<br>they trusted her um and that was really<br>useful because they were able to do um<br>debates they were able to inform them<br>about things that were going on and they<br>felt that that was spreading out into<br>the wider Community another charity that<br>we um went to see they had a community<br>center and they did lots of things going<br>on in this community center it might be<br>cooking courses it might be about health<br>and well-being it might be a a nursery<br>for the end of fives but at the heart of<br>this was this Support Agency so this was<br>somewhere where the women were allowed<br>to go and the men didn't really know<br>what was going on behind those closed<br>doors but that support was was there in<br>a place where they were allowed to go<br>and that was working really well for<br>them another suggestion was on on stop<br>shops so you have Community buildings<br>that have lots of things under the same<br>roof so if you're seen walking in people<br>don't know if you're going to see the<br>doctors or the library or there's a<br>nursery in there or you might be going<br>to see a support worker so these were<br>all ideas um that were really<br>useful we saw a charity in the north of<br>England that was setting up Survivor<br>networks and that was really useful so<br>people knew they weren't on their own<br>they were able to talk to people um that<br>were going through the same experiences<br>as<br>them some areas had a South Asian<br>Community liaison police officer and<br>that was working really well to break<br>down those barriers not just with the<br>victims and the police but also the<br>Charities and the police there was a<br>feeling that Charities hadn't always<br>worked as closely with the police as<br>they could so that was seen as really<br>useful and then in the Midlands there<br>was a marriage course and that was about<br>bringing men and women in and talking to<br>them about expectations of<br>marriage and then in terms of the police<br>it was just about understanding the<br>culture understanding that some people<br>will want to talk to people from their<br>own community because they'll understand<br>the culture some won't some will be too<br>concerned that that information will go<br>back to the community so actually they'd<br>rather speak to somebody outside of<br>their own<br>Community the availability of female<br>officers that was a big one um and just<br>that cultural understanding so for<br>example when a First Response officer<br>arrives at the house they might think<br>well let's get the men out of the room<br>but it's okay to leave the woman there<br>with her<br>mother-in-law well it's not okay because<br>as we've said generally it will be the<br>Mother-in-law that is more controlling<br>in terms of what we're talking about<br>than potentially the men so we need<br>better Community um liaison so working<br>with the community working with the<br>influential religious leaders being at<br>Community event so we you know people<br>can see there are South Asian female<br>police officers they are approachable<br>this is something that I might consider<br>um doing it if needs be and as I've said<br>already trying to improve relationships<br>with<br>NGS so on our Whistle Stop tour and now<br>on to the third one um and this is<br>really the work that I've done since<br>I've been here at Lincoln so I'm quite<br>kind of pleased that I've had to wait a<br>while a while three and a half years um<br>to be here because I wouldn't have be<br>able to discuss um this um if I had gone<br>straight away so I am grateful for covid<br>and the waiting list so I'm going to<br>start with team photos and I'm going to<br>embarrass a few people in the room so um<br>just to introduce the team on this I'm<br>going to start here so Lauren<br>Hall Gary Saunders both used to be here<br>um now they've deserted us gone to the<br>University of<br>Nottingham um Rachel M Health and Social<br>care second<br>row um Helen Nichols again used to be<br>here Shout at the University of Hull um<br>and then Lauren well at the end Lauren<br>Smith psychology second row as well she<br>was here but she had very important<br>stuff to go on we don't actually have a<br>team photo do we and the reason I've<br>used these is because this photo was in<br>Trafalga Square we just presented our<br>research to the ministry of Justice and<br>this was I was walking back to the train<br>station and I love to name drop this<br>well Place drop it this is at the Sky<br>Deck in Melbourne um during the summer<br>when we went over to present our<br>research to Corrections in Victoria um<br>so thought I would mention that so um<br>we've done quite a bit of work on health<br>and wellbeing of prison stuff but I'm<br>just going to talk about um the initial<br>project which looked at the health and<br>wellbeing<br>of prison Governors and we did this in<br>conjunction with the prison Governors<br>Association and I'm so pleased that Carl<br>is here um tonight who is from the<br>prison Governor Association and who<br>we've done all this work with and I<br>think this is probably a really good<br>example of tenacity because Lauren just<br>sent an email to Carl and said do you<br>think it would be a good idea if we did<br>this and Carl said yes and that was what<br>two and a half three years ago um yeah<br>so basically what we did this is during<br>covid we interviewed 63 um prison<br>Governor Association members um and we<br>spoke to them about their health and<br>well-being and they came from a variety<br>of settings right across the prison EST<br>estate England Scotland Wales um from um<br>open prisons maximum security prisons<br>the women's estate the youth custodial<br>state so we had a really good<br>representative right across the board<br>people working in operational<br>non-operational roles people working in<br>headquarters as<br>well and I think really our core<br>findings was in General Health and<br>well-being was not good um the title of<br>our report was just get on with it that<br>was quote not just from one people<br>several people were saying we've just<br>got to get on with it um and the general<br>feeling was that there was quite a<br>dysfunctional culture in the prison<br>working environment and that was<br>resulting in staff feeling undervalued<br>disenchanted and disengaged and that<br>then had quite a negative impact on<br>their home life as well as their<br>physical and mental<br>well-being as I said we did we collected<br>our data during covid and as you can<br>imagine um covid in prisons was a really<br>high pressured um time for them but<br>everybody was really Keen to say to us<br>that okay covid has exacerbated these<br>issues but it certainly hasn't been um<br>the cause of them so I'm just going to<br>go through some of those core findings<br>um in a little bit more<br>detail and it's probably worth saying up<br>front as well that we have been really<br>well supported by the university um in<br>this project um we've had money to go to<br>Australia which we will never forget um<br>we had money last year to do a film<br>about our research available on YouTube<br>um and we also were really lucky to have<br>money for illustrations so the<br>illustrations on the next few slides are<br>by a man called Andy devil and they're<br>just perfect in terms of trying to sum<br>up um the key points that came out from<br>our<br>research so one of the key issues was<br>just High workloads you know the<br>workload<br>challenges um that many of our Governors<br>felt that they were under and one of the<br>phrases which prison Governors use is<br>that we are All Hours worked so they're<br>not a 9 till 5 job as you can imagine<br>but we not work all hours but that<br>seemed to almost be the expectation so<br>their contract says 37 hours a week but<br>we were being told that Governors were<br>working 50 60 70 hours but not just you<br>know but in really high pressure um<br>environments so as one quote here I want<br>a job I can do in 40 hours and that job<br>in was probably at least 50 and it could<br>have been a hell of a lot more and I<br>just want my I don't want my kids to pay<br>that price in general I think there are<br>clear equality problems with jobs that<br>will take more than 40 hours but that<br>was really difficult because the culture<br>the expectation was that in order to<br>function as a prison Governor you had to<br>put 50 60 70 hours a week into that job<br>and sometimes even more during during um<br>the covid period so that was a real big<br>issue in terms of workload amount and<br>the pressures of that and really the um<br>the illustration here um explains this<br>really well in terms of Governors were<br>having pressures from pressures from<br>headquarters they were having pressures<br>from their prison staff and they were<br>that pinch point in the middle and I<br>don't know if you can quite see it but<br>the little tick box you can't quite see<br>it but the idea was that everything was<br>for work then family I think there was<br>about five on there and then there was<br>one for myself so there was a big issue<br>in terms of I give most of myself to<br>work my family get a tiny bit but for me<br>there's virtually nothing and that<br>really fed into health and well-being<br>and the state of the health and<br>well-being now those of you who know<br>anything about prisons may already know<br>that it's quite a macho<br>culture um and again these illustrations<br>are just brilliant because the first one<br>is about the mask this is the<br>presentation of myself in front of<br>everybody I am controlled it doesn't<br>bother me what is going on around me but<br>actually inside I'm drowning and that<br>was that Viewpoint that as a prison<br>Governor you couldn't ask for help you<br>couldn't admit any weaknesses you<br>couldn't admit that actually having to<br>cut prisoners down having to cope with<br>self harm was affecting you in any way<br>and a lot of people spoke about those<br>pressures of having to fit in with a<br>macho culture that doesn't want to<br>accept that we suffer from stress or<br>anxiety and that feeling that you have<br>have to say that you're all right and<br>somebody spoke about how it was a little<br>bit like in a restaurant when you're<br>asked in a restaurant if your meal is<br>all right you're expected to say yes<br>they don't want to know but they've<br>asked you they've ticked the box and<br>they've asked you and the and the kind<br>of the Macho way of dealing with this<br>was<br>compartmentalization so the manner that<br>I deal with it an issue goes into a box<br>and it gets put in that cupboard un<br>fortunately sometimes the lids come off<br>the box and eventually it's inevitable<br>the lids will come off most of the boxes<br>the lids have been rattling quite a lot<br>over the last few years and that's just<br>the idea you can't keep on putting all<br>these traumatic things in boxes at some<br>stage that is going to be<br>problematic another big thing was people<br>just didn't feel valued<br>um they didn't feel that their line<br>managers their prison group directors<br>the ministry of Justice they didn't feel<br>that they valued their contribution that<br>they were making that they were giving<br>their all their heart and soul to the<br>prison<br>service and they weren't valued for it<br>and part of that particularly for the<br>governing Governors was a lack of<br>autonomy so you know they didn't have<br>they weren't able to make these big<br>decisions about their own prisons they<br>had gone through multiple assessments to<br>get up to governing Governors but they<br>still weren't able to make decisions<br>about their own prison so a lot of them<br>felt that the only way that they could<br>do anything Innovative the only way that<br>they felt that they could make a<br>difference was to be a Maverick and run<br>the risk of being told off for doing<br>that not everybody had the confidence to<br>be a Maverick and you know they were the<br>ones who were um feeling that the job<br>wasn't what they expected it to be it<br>do a lot of our Governors also felt that<br>whilst there was support in the prison<br>service for their staff there wasn't<br>really support aimed at<br>them so in terms of support most prisons<br>will have what's known as a care team<br>and they are um specially trained prison<br>officers who are there if you've been<br>through a particularly traumatic event<br>you can go and talk to the care team but<br>a lot of Governor said well that's just<br>not appropriate for me to go and say to<br>somebody who is two or three bands<br>Junior to me to share and tell them that<br>I'm stress that I'm anxious that I'm<br>feeling concerned after a traumatic<br>event so care teams for most of our<br>prison Governors wasn't an<br>option the employee assistance program<br>which um the ministry of Justice puts on<br>for prison staff is run by Pam assist<br>it's a 24hour<br>helpline um we had some good experiences<br>of Pam assist but generally not so good<br>um mostly in terms of just not being<br>able to access them and they wasn't a<br>lot of confidence in terms of<br>confidentiality a lot of people were<br>concerned that that information would<br>come back to the line managers and that<br>it would lead to them being either<br>managed out of the service completely or<br>it would lead to them being moved on to<br>another prison so there wasn't great<br>uptake on pamy<br>either now during Co um the governing<br>Governors and the deputy Governors were<br>almost forced to do um reflective<br>structured reflective<br>sessions probably in terms of feedback<br>this was the best form of support for<br>those who<br>engaged um but it was still mixed and I<br>Now understand that since covid has<br>ended I know it hasn't ended but since<br>covid has ended in terms of that<br>additional support that support is no<br>longer available<br>so again this illustration is just<br>perfect so all of that has really led to<br>a lot of our Governors being on what<br>we've coined a path to disenchantment<br>and I'm writing something at the moment<br>which is looking at a psychological<br>construct of employee disenchantment<br>it's that going outside of my comfort<br>zone that I mentioned earlier and really<br>that's what we've seen that a lot of our<br>um research participants are heading<br>towards disenchantment it's really<br>important that we're now thinking about<br>how can we reenchant these highly<br>trained highly experienced individuals<br>so the prison service doesn't lose them<br>so very quickly just in terms of<br>Engagement so we've really tried hard<br>again not to stay in our Ivory Towers to<br>go out and share this work with those<br>people who can actually try and make a<br>difference so we've raised awareness of<br>this in the UK in Australia and New<br>Zealand um we've pested um Carl<br>constantly to come and share um our<br>research so we presented at the PGA<br>conference three years in a row um and I<br>think we are making some changes so um<br>hmpps they're now piloting a new<br>governor support program we believe off<br>the back of our um research um maybe we<br>were tin bit instrumental in getting you<br>a bit of a pay rise and one of the pga's<br>official objectives is now work to<br>improve and maintain well-being and<br>that's really important that we are<br>actually making a difference that we're<br>not just doing the research for research<br>sake so we're building from that so our<br>team now includes Chloe Wilson from the<br>law school um so again we're working<br>with Carl and the prison Governor<br>Association this time we're looking at<br>EDI equality diversity and inclusion<br>workplace experiences of prison<br>Governors and Roger you're not being<br>left out um Roger kind of in the middle<br>from psychology um off the back of the<br>prison Governor's work we were<br>commissioned to evaluate a prison staff<br>coaching program so we're currently<br>doing that um with spark<br>inside so I'm nearly done you may be<br>pleased um to hear um but I think what<br>I've tried to show throughout that this<br>isn't just me um it has taken a lot of<br>time effort to get here but there's been<br>a lot of people who have helped me um<br>get here so in addition to those I've<br>already introduced you to um these are<br>just the people who I genuinely wouldn't<br>be here um without so I'm going to<br>finish by saying thank you you to these<br>listening</p></main><footer style="margin-top: 2rem; background: #0001; padding: 2rem; text-align: center;"><p>We Are The University</p><ul style="list-style-type: none; padding: 0; margin:
