it's your first time uh here uh the<br>Beating Heart of the University uh as we<br>uh as we say<br>now uh so um I'm not sure which<br>generation I represent um uh but I can<br>show you the excitement starts after<br>I've spoken so uh just hold on for a for<br>a minute um while I say it is a great<br>pleasure to be here uh to celebrate uh<br>with you 50 years of uh computer science<br>uh as you are going to hear this evening<br>and as most of you uh know already uh it<br>is a 50 years uh that is really worth<br>celebrating a 50 years of some really<br>extraordinary achievements uh some<br>extraordinary people who've shaped the<br>course of computer science not just at<br>this University but internationally uh<br>and that's a great source of Pride for<br>me as Vice Chancellor today and and all<br>of our colleagues here uh and and those<br>who have gone uh before<br>us the official history of the<br>University Records a few Snippets of uh<br>the history uh<br>of uh computer science at the University<br>uh and uh and of course uh tataka has<br>mentioned it but you know universities<br>spend their time uh uh confronting<br>government polic policies trying to work<br>with them and uh and rubbing up against<br>them and have done uh right from the<br>beginning of this University uh there<br>are many stories that some of you will<br>know about the challenges we've had here<br>uh but they began here with uh as the<br>history records that the tangles uh from<br>the 1970s created by the demands of<br>computing for University administrative<br>activities uh while at the same time uh<br>Computing was required for University<br>academic activities uh the long process<br>to persuade the university grants<br>committee as it was then uh to fund uh<br>computer science at the University as a<br>separate Department um those were the<br>days of real centralized control in New<br>Zealand uh and uh and in Wellington sat<br>a group of wise people who uh not only<br>allocated Capital grants to each of the<br>universities but actually decided what<br>the Staffing in each University should<br>be as<br>well um and of course out of those<br>challenges and eventually persuading the<br>university grants committee for funding<br>uh for a computer science uh Department<br>uh came uh our work uh on the internet<br>uh as it<br>emerged uh and the data mining and the<br>software revolutions uh a as they uh<br>took over uh computer science and became<br>areas in which uh we not only excelled<br>but actually made a huge International<br>contribution so it's a great pleasure uh<br>for me that uh tonight we're able to<br>have so many people who were part of the<br>very beginning of computer science at<br>this University uh and uh and to see you<br>know th those names on the guest list<br>this evening uh from uh the history of<br>the university and the record uh of<br>those very uh early years uh in in the<br>50 so you're going to hear a lot from<br>people uh who've been part of those uh<br>50 years uh but let me just say again uh<br>thank you all for being here this<br>evening uh it's fantastic that so many<br>of you have sh shown up uh and I think a<br>real tribute uh to the great<br>contribution that computer science at<br>this university has made thank you all<br>very<br>much quite<br>um okay we're going to move on with our<br>program uh we've got a whole bunch of<br>speakers um the first Speaker some<br>people here may be aware of who his uh<br>his name is Bill<br>Rogers uh Bill Rogers<br>received um a Bachelor of Science in<br>1973 um he has been a fundamental Rock<br>shall I say of the computer science<br>department um and he had a senior El<br>role for many years um but recently has<br>stepped down from that so to talk about<br>the computer science department in the<br>Rogers Well actually to not quite live<br>up to that exactly I was asked to answer<br>two questions um one I think these were<br>designed for student speakers really one<br>was how the university set me up for<br>success and the other was to describe<br>one highlight um so I thought I'd start<br>off with setting me up for Success so I<br>completed bachelor's and master's<br>degrees at University here in chemistry<br>biology and Mathematics back in 72 3 4<br>five um and I just stayed on so it<br>didn't really so in that sense I think<br>what I would like to say is my major<br>success was achieving 42 years of<br>service which is indeed of course the<br>answer to life the universe and<br>everything as we know from Douglas Adams<br>and I sincerely hope that Hitchhiker's<br>Guide to the Galaxy is still required<br>reading for all computer<br>scientists so then my other question was<br>to describe one highlight and you know<br>directing academics as the vice<br>Chancellor of the dean I'm sure we well<br>aware has been likened to uh hurting<br>cats so my immediate response is well I<br>don't like the question I mean I don't<br>think that one highlight would really<br>suffice for that number of years so I<br>thought instead I'd just describe my<br>favorite ongoing aspects of being at yat<br>so I think first and foremost I've liked<br>being free to pursue aspects of computer<br>science as the subject has developed<br>over all the years and the as the in<br>aspects of that that interest<br>me I've liked the range of people I've<br>met the ideas the<br>technology that I've experienced and the<br>places that I've visited so over the<br>years I've taught programming once even<br>in Cobalt computer hardware operating<br>systems algorithms computer graphics<br>programming on the internet and<br>smartphones the internet of things and<br>various aspects of software<br>engineering I've been had the<br>opportunity to take students to<br>International<br>competitions um in Australia in Florida<br>in Korea and in<br>Russia um of the things I've<br>particularly liked I've been<br>particularly fond of<br>lunch over the years lunch lunch has<br>been a marvelous opportunity one of the<br>things I suppose that teachers in all<br>all sorts of teaching institutions<br>experiences that they spend a lot of<br>time with their students and<br>surprisingly little with their<br>colleagues and lunch has been that<br>opportunity to interact with and talk<br>with a diverse group of really<br>interesting people that I consider good<br>friends um over all those years so lunch<br>lunch is up there I've liked the diverse<br>range of students I've met so just some<br>little examples here um I had a graduate<br>student who was a a professional<br>wrestler um we didn't work on wrestling<br>uh I've had Sports people who worked in<br>volleyball and Athletics and we've done<br>software in support of them I had a<br>chimney sweep who decided that he would<br>transfer to computer science before he<br>fell off a roof and injured himself<br>badly um I've learned how people manag<br>to get to sleep in 50Â° summers in<br>Pakistan so apparently you hose down a<br>concrete slab and you lost on that um I<br>have learned how cursing Works in Sweden<br>and I won't go into that um and I've<br>even been told by an Inu speaker exactly<br>how many words there are for snow in the<br>Inu language that that he used but I do<br>think I'd finish with one little<br>anecdote and thanks to Taka for setting<br>something of a tone here I wasn't really<br>sure kind of what the tone of this would<br>be but being a teacher is often a bit<br>humbling and often what we learn or or<br>experience in a class may not be what<br>was intended or what we expect so my<br>very best tutorial experience ever I<br>think was in about 1996 which I'll<br>nominate as my decade I guess and we<br>were talking about the potential and<br>impact of this new fangled idea the<br>internet and so I was teaching bits of<br>communication software and internet<br>programming at that time and we had a<br>weekly tutorial and one of the topics I<br>sort of set for this was um talking<br>about what the internet was what its<br>impacts would be and at that time what<br>what I can say is that we were<br>completely wrong in almost everything<br>that we expected of it but the tutorial<br>was kind of right and I'll I'll<br>explain it was expected to be a<br>democratizing Innovation what was<br>unexpected was the domination of<br>advertising the survival and growth of<br>traditional um copyright protection<br>where people had kind of hope that<br>individual artists and producers of<br>material would interact directly with<br>their public the the structures really<br>survived all of that and mostly the<br>dominance of consumption over<br>contribution it was expected that people<br>would contribute to the web rather than<br>just absorb information anyway I had one<br>very interesting Stu uh student in a<br>tutorial here who was from South Africa<br>and he told the tale of a neighbor so he<br>lived on a farm before he left South<br>Africa near the namibian border and if<br>you know anything about South African<br>law one of the things that's key is that<br>you're not allowed to deal with diamonds<br>um and he had a neighbor who was engaged<br>in a diamond smuggling operation over<br>the border into no I'm not going to try<br>and reproduce this it was a wonderful<br>spellbinding tale of uh struggling<br>across the border escaping guards and<br>things but the upshot of it was that he<br>was cheated out of an impressive Rive<br>amount of money in exchange for a tube<br>of rocks he'd been shown these uncut<br>diamonds and when he finally got them<br>they were hidden in the right place they<br>weren't and I felt that of all the<br>discussions we had as to where the<br>internet was going maybe that story<br>really captured what actually happened<br>that the internet has developed in a way<br>that's had huge benefits and a great<br>deal pleasure for many people but<br>perhaps has also cheated us out of<br>potential development um in the world's<br>implementation of democracy and and<br>exchange of information so that was the<br>sense in which I'm thanking Chaka for<br>having a slightly negative aspect as<br>well but um but mainly my highlight is<br>the people that I've met the places that<br>I've been and how much I've enjoyed<br>you<br>thank you B excellent can't help<br>thinking that uh what you're saying<br>about the internet is somehow parallels<br>with what's happening with artificial<br>intelligence at the<br>moment uh but fortunately we have an<br>artificial intelligence Institute within<br>our computer science well associated<br>with our computer science department<br>shall we say then marille okay so the<br>next speaker we have tonight um is<br>Andrew<br>scn Andrew scn will be here talking to<br>us about the period 1984 to<br>1993 when he was involved with the our<br>department<br>Andrew everyone pleasure to be here it's<br>it is fantastic to see so many people um<br>and yeah like I'm proud to come from<br>this place uh and to have been through<br>this program I can't take credit for all<br>of those I only started in ' 92 uh I I<br>know I look older um but uh yeah so look<br>when I was when I was uh growing up um<br>over in Tonga um I was always really<br>interested in Computing and when I was<br>looking for a university you know I was<br>looking around see what's available and<br>the thing that Drew me to W was really<br>the fact that they had a dedicated<br>computer science degree like everywhere<br>else that was Bachelor of engineering or<br>Bachelor of Science you could major in<br>Computing and I love the fact that there<br>was something dedicated to that and I<br>think even then it was it was<br>recognizing that this is a really<br>important part of the of the future um<br>so so that was huge for me uh I also got<br>asked talked about highlights and and<br>what what I learned and again uh I I<br>don't think I could pick only<br>one um probably the thing that stands<br>out the most if I'm honest is the fact<br>that I still had a full head of hair<br>back then uh that was pretty special uh<br>that's something you be proud of in the<br>'90s you know whole whole boy band type<br>thing anyway sorry I don't um but really<br>I I think it was you know it was the<br>facilities were a huge part the internet<br>was there was starting this was the<br>birth um of the internet really starting<br>to take off and that was a really<br>exciting time we had the labs we had<br>modern computers we had great facilities<br>uh and it was exciting to be part of uh<br>and and the lecturers all had had a<br>passion for it you know this was an<br>industry it was going somewhere and the<br>passion was clearly there and you<br>couldn't help but be a little bit<br>excited about you know the things that<br>you were<br>learning another highlight was probably<br>the late night Labs I'm sure most people<br>have lived through the late night Labs<br>where that dangerous combination of<br>sleep deprivation and too much caffeine<br>can lead to some suboptimal decision<br>making um you can read one of my stories<br>I think it got posted online about<br>something I may or may not have done in<br>a in given situation but that was Al<br>also special you're working with other<br>people you often you're working with<br>groups to achieve things and again<br>you're doing you're just learning the<br>entire<br>time I even enjoyed and I didn't at the<br>time but looking back now it was it was<br>actually really good um I was doing a uh<br>Information Systems stream for computing<br>and mathematical sciences and I was<br>doing management papers and accounting<br>papers and organizational behavior<br>papers and I just thinky remember at the<br>time thinking why am I doing this I got<br>no interest like I I like engineering I<br>like maths like not this rubbish I'm<br>never going to be in a leadership<br>position why would I need to know this<br>sort of stuff so thank you very much for<br>knowing better than I um the department<br>yeah yeah that was that was really good<br>but I think overall it was the breadth<br>and I think this was previously<br>mentioned it was the breadth of areas<br>and ideas that I was exposed to um so<br>you know understanding how computer<br>science was going to have a role in more<br>than just an engineering or scientific<br>discipline it was going to have a role<br>in all sorts of fields in the future and<br>really starting to learn and appreciate<br>that so when I think about all that that<br>what really set me up for Success was<br>was that whole experience cementing a<br>lifelong passion for learning which I<br>still have and I think most people in<br>this room probably have that that desire<br>to learn new things to be excited about<br>new things and also really enabling me<br>to appreciate the bigger picture and go<br>beyond just engineering excellence and<br>that's really what's enabled me to add<br>the most value to the organizations and<br>the groups that uh I've worked with in<br>the past so happy birthday to the school<br>of computing and mathematical science<br>and thank you very much for setting me<br>up for<br>success thank you Angie excellent to<br>hear uh next<br>so um the next uh speaker we have is a<br>student who was here in the 2000s so<br>we're moving into this millennium<br>Uh current founding director of Wi-Fi<br>Bachelor of Science computer science in<br>2002 postgraduate diploma in computer<br>science in 2009 T Thomas thank<br>you um yeah just before I before I<br>started just tell a bit of a story um<br>it's a story about a uh young first year<br>student named um it's called<br>Bob uh it could be you or me um probably<br>me um Bob was yeah so excited to attend<br>V University uh just the atmosphere<br>around it<br>the uh computer science department the<br>uh excitement for learning um it was<br>actually a bit embarrassing how exciting<br>he was um he went and researched all the<br>papers looked at all the descriptions uh<br>the internet was in full bloom at that<br>point and um yeah just just could<br>couldn't really understand what he<br>wanted to do he's very excited about a<br>lot of different things<br>um so Bob chose a uh nice uh degree<br>structure that had a whole bunch of<br>different papers including a really uh<br>strong foundation in computer science um<br>so yeah he studied uh artificial<br>intelligence before it was cool<br>right and uh but yeah we know artificial<br>intelligence has always been cool here<br>at University of<br>w um and uh Bob spent a couple years at<br>University um before entering the<br>workforce um of this this guy Bob was<br>really sort of quite practical so he<br>just wanted to get his hands on on the<br>doing um and it's just it it speaks like<br>a lot to a uh University to sort of just<br>let that hybrid uh education environment<br>sort of work right so two years at<br>University and then yeah over the next I<br>think four or six or something years uh<br>sort of polished off the the other the<br>other degrees um and yeah every stage uh<br>Bob was supported by the university in<br>his journey uh the people who were here<br>here the people who are here and the<br>people who will be here um Bob got into<br>a little trouble here and there right it<br>wasn't a straightforward Journey there<br>was uh ups and downs um and uh at one<br>point Bob yeah he found himself in front<br>of someone a little bit little bit scary<br>and uh it's um yeah late late night<br>dangerous uh situation right you uh a<br>little bit enthusiastic about maybe<br>networks and the Linux environment is<br>very locked down at the time but the Mac<br>um um and yeah like okay that's that's<br>um the good news is yeah Bob's a<br>successful business owner now<br>and and uh wouldn't wouldn't be there<br>without the University of like um so<br>yeah I'd um and and that's what it's<br>about the people right so yeah I'd like<br>to pay really special respects to<br>everyone who's been part of my journey<br>and and um gu everyone's Journey here<br>and uh yeah we we all know that the<br>University of W's a worldclass<br>institution and um yeah wouldn't be here<br>today without my time so very proud to<br>too thanks very much Bob uh<br>Thomas okay so the next speaker we have<br>is going to talk to us about um life in<br>the university in the<br>2000s um<br>um Nar is a bus business analyst<br>and<br>a yeah business analyst for programming<br>commercial here at wo University so<br>we've managed to keep her she hasn't<br>escaped from us yet uh Bachelor of<br>Science with honors and computer science<br>in 2015 master of information in<br>Abraham<br>uh cool uh good afternoon staff and<br>guests of the school of computer and<br>mathematical science uh it is an honor<br>to stand before you today as we<br>celebrate the 50th anniversary of this<br>department and during such occasions<br>it's difficult not to reminisce about my<br>own time<br>here um I first enrolled in the computer<br>science degree in<br>2012 a year most notable for its many<br>the world predictions uh clearly this<br>could only be construed as a good omen<br>into my introduction into<br>Academia in the Years proceeding that uh<br>that followed I became very aware that<br>my passion for computer science was<br>often not enough to pass the rigers of<br>our practical assignments there were<br>many late night sessions a lot of<br>exasperations to endless errors and the<br>growing unease that I would never<br>graduation apparently 2012<br>again um nonetheless uh on a warm day in<br>2016 I carefully stro across the stage<br>in my regalia desperately trying to<br>remember which hand was meant for<br>shaking and which hand was meant for<br>saing uh for those taking note the<br>answer is not<br>both I had finally reached the<br>anticipated day of graduation and it was<br>a very proud moment for me a moment that<br>I reviled In This Moment was immediately<br>interrupted when I spoke water on my<br>brain new graduation not 20 minutes<br>after reing it much to the mirth of my<br>friends and the disappointment of my<br>parents as I transition from a student<br>into the work a student to an employee<br>in the workforce the foundation I<br>created during my time here was<br>instrumental in shaping my professional<br>trajectory the analytical mindset the<br>collaborative experiences and<br>adaptability and the face of new<br>challenges have all been schools I<br>highly utilize to this<br>day however even with these skills it<br>would be a disservice to say that they<br>were the only things that I gained from<br>my time here soy qualification also<br>excluded for every NightLight session<br>within the confines of the computer lab<br>there were my fellow friends who<br>delivered food on the assistance that<br>coffee was not a food<br>substitute for every unsolvable<br>assignment there was my teor who would<br>give up his lunch break running over the<br>concepts again and again until I was<br>able to understand and for every doubt<br>or roadblock that came my way there was<br>my advisor with his unraveled optimism<br>who could find a path through any<br>problem I<br>presented the anniversary we he to<br>celebrate today celebrates the<br>continuation of The Institute of<br>computer science it is more fitting that<br>I pay homage to all the people past and<br>present who have made the success of<br>this program<br>possible to those who helped me and many<br>others I want to extend my heartful<br>gratitude for your support during my<br>journey thank you to all my classmates<br>who became my own cheer squad thank you<br>to my teacher who didn't give up on me<br>and thank you to my advisor who cleared<br>my path to<br>success it is only with your care<br>dedication and support to students who<br>enter this program that makes it a<br>success I can also say without your help<br>I would not be the person who stands<br>before you<br>today when you leave the university you<br>leave with the knowledge that those<br>connections carry you forward that the<br>support given is the template for the<br>support you give others and that no<br>matter how many world-ending events are<br>predicted for your future you strive<br>forward in the knowledge that there are<br>people always willing to help<br>congratulations to the Department of<br>computer science and reaching your 50th<br>Anniversary I have no doubt with your<br>continuing efforts there will be many<br>come n thank you very much um<br>interesting to hear the similarities<br>reaving through our past students um now<br>we'll have<br>um some information some talk from a<br>current<br>student uh Zack Isaac so Zack uh<br>completed our bcms in 2019 with honors<br>uh got a diploma in finance also in<br>2019 good trick master of science in<br>2020 and is currently working on his PhD<br>SEC oh jeez there's way more people than<br>I thought<br>I uh yes I'm kind of the old one out<br>here I didn't really do much compy at<br>all in my<br>degree feel very odd uh so my name is<br>Zach Isaac I'm a PhD student here in the<br>maths Department I guess most of you<br>probably won't know where that is uh<br>that's the quiet little space up the top<br>of gblock um there aren't many of us<br>here but we do exist mathematicians so<br>yeah when I finish up my PhD next year<br>I'll have been hanging around here not<br>working studying for nearly a decade I<br>did my bcms in maths I did my MC in<br>maths now my doctorate which is kind of<br>scare if you think about it 10 years of<br>maaps and imagine the size of my student<br>loan I think I'm single-handedly keeping<br>the maps Department of float just about<br>no seriously it's crazy to think it's<br>been so long and there's so many<br>highlights along the way I knew from the<br>first day here that this place operated<br>a little differently when I walked into<br>my first math 101 lecture 2015 and the<br>lecturer Professor sha Alton was there<br>in his jandals singlet stubbies he just<br>come straight from football and I<br>thought okay all right that's how it<br>works around here but uh that for me<br>being from wsky little town that was<br>pretty cool that set me right up and I<br>knew was at home there early on I got<br>involved with student student clubs on<br>campus many of you remember or recall<br>the famous computer science student<br>Society CS cubed if you don't I guess uh<br>in summary it's it's essentially a trap<br>for lonely students from maths compsite<br>data and design we kind of lure them in<br>with a few free pizzas and uh trick them<br>into socializing and<br>networking then we tell them about the<br>pub crawl that happens at the end of the<br>year and that kind of that keeps them<br>motivated all the way through to<br>October I was um I was one of those<br>students uh was in better shape than I<br>am now after all the pizza over the<br>years but uh many years ago I happened<br>to wander past es block caught a sniff<br>of some pizza and I strolled into what<br>happens to be the club's AGM and I<br>thought you know there's too many compai<br>students here I'm going to I'm going to<br>bring a maths approach so I joined the<br>committee and that began my love affair<br>with procrastinating from work by doing<br>Club things<br>instead nowadays I have the interesting<br>position of being the president of the<br>computer science student Society uh but<br>never having done more than first year<br>computer science so<br>don't tell them that interestingly 2023<br>actually marks a 10-y year anniversary<br>for CS cubed after it was founded by<br>people like Grace noan and Brad Cy back<br>in 2013 the school supported us every<br>step of the way and helped give me some<br>of my personal biggest highlights from<br>my time in SS from organizing the Cs<br>Cube careers fair in May of over 200<br>students 17 companies and attendance to<br>seeing associate professor tiaka Keegan<br>at the pub crawl furiously finishing as<br>many human Bingo cards as he could<br>before he left the hilly we even started<br>a toonga branch of the club this year<br>and I've spent many days over the other<br>side of the kimise uh desperately<br>dragging students Kicking and Screaming<br>into talking to each other which is a<br>strange concept for compiz<br>students Beyond CS cubed I also founded<br>the University's first Club focused on<br>students with interest in maths and data<br>the mathematics and Co club or MC squ<br>for short again there are many of us<br>supposedly just me and a couple others<br>but we do exist with the support ofs<br>we've held events on campus celebrating<br>Pi Day we've run stores at open day<br>hosted a mini math student seminar and<br>then slowly again dragg those few math<br>students closer together trying to build<br>up some form of<br>community I think overall almost<br>counterintuitively given the stereotype<br>of students in our field the biggest<br>thing I'll take away from SCS is the<br>ability to manage myself and communicate<br>with others I've worked with lecturers<br>and supervisors who've allowed me to<br>grow my research skills in my own way<br>I've worked on computational<br>astrophysics projects tissue Optics<br>projects all sorts of different things<br>in between ient conferences to present<br>my work the school hired me as a tutor<br>for some reason they developed my<br>ability to teach and then they kind of<br>made another mistake that hired me as a<br>school Ambassador and they got me<br>speaking to the public without sounding<br>like a robot which was kind of cool and<br>through clubs like CS cubed and MC squ<br>I've developed my skills in managing<br>people in groups which I think all up is<br>not really a bad return for little old y<br>CLE honestly and here's the next 50<br>years of students coming through thank<br>you<br>good KN when you<br>si uh I've noticed that um the people<br>who have got up and speaking who a bit<br>older used pieces of paper but the<br>people who are a bit younger using their<br>phones so I think I'm going to start<br>using my phone in the future if I have<br>to get up to speak so people think that<br>I'm<br>younger uh k um in thank thanks to to<br>all of our speakers uh for giving the<br>audience a little bit of a taste of<br>remembrance um to what computer science<br>has been over the years so though um the<br>next speaker we got on our list is our<br>current dean of our school um Anika hins<br>um ana has been quite proactive and a<br>lot of the the celebration activities<br>we've had this<br>year Ana and for me it was very<br>appropriate that she received her<br>professorship as the first woman<br>professor of computer science of our<br>had<br>thank you for coming to this celebrating<br>bow I can see all the t-shirts over<br>there this is Nate yeah I agree this is<br>really actually cool looking from here<br>that's quite lovely um thank you for<br>coming for celebrating with<br>us I acknowledge all the students and<br>staff and<br>colleagues all of you coming that is<br>lovely lovely to see<br>you I'd like to name all of you but<br>that's going to be tricky so I thought<br>this is what I do I can't name all of<br>you so I will list our heads of computer<br>science and the head of<br>schools and the ones that are in Gold<br>are the ones that are actually here I<br>hope I didn't forget anyone who's here<br>please wave if if your name isn't in<br>gold and you're you're also here and now<br>of course I want to look Daryl darl I<br>saw you<br>earlier Daryl Smith first head of<br>computer science is is here which is<br>absolutely lovely so make sure you talk<br>to him later um so yes it's actually<br>absolutely lovely to have you<br>here I also like to acknowledge so you<br>can see this is my job now I'm<br>acknowledging lots of people being here<br>so I'd like to thank our sponsors our<br>industry Partners it's great to have you<br>on board um and also previous students<br>most of you turned into industry<br>Partners one way or the other you just<br>can't let go and we love having you and<br>it's fabulous also thank than you you<br>will have seen the little goodie bag so<br>sponsors this is an artwork and there<br>seems to be now a new tradition that<br>started um at 30 Years celebration so<br>this is an artwork by Don ratana that<br>celebrates 50 years of computing in ra<br>if you did the tour earlier uh you will<br>have seen it in the entrance way of<br>gblock it lists every single course in<br>computer science uh through all the<br>years so Bill you will be able to find<br>all of your courses there I<br>think it's called unlimited abilities<br>infinite<br>possibilities it's absolutely<br>fascinating colleagues tell me they<br>stand and look at it for quite some time<br>looking at all the different words in<br>there so what I thought I'd do while<br>showing you this picture as um while<br>Neil has already listed a number of<br>milestones and first I think I'd like to<br>extend that list and add some more<br>in marking the years of the<br>department so when we were<br>eight Computing at bado received the<br>first International research grants in<br>New Zealand that was some colleague here<br>at<br>Bato when we were 16 you know that part<br>were quite instrumental in setting up<br>the first New Zealand internet<br>connection<br>when we were 30 we welcomed our first<br>design colleagues into the<br>family at<br>33 we were recognized as the best<br>computer science research Department as<br>part of the PBF<br>exercise at 34 our first software<br>graduated at 40 we created the very<br>first moo from a university in New<br>Zealand<br>at 50 with our first female professor<br>and our first graduates at our new<br>taranga<br>campus so that's our Tanga campus and<br>there's some colleagues here that work<br>over there at the moment and a lot of<br>people going over the kimis supporting<br>our staff over<br>there in the middle you see hjo so I<br>want to recognize and acknowledge my<br>colleagues who couldn't come to<br>celebrate with us because they're<br>working at hjo in China teaching our<br>design degree and you see Hanan<br>University where we're starting our new<br>partnership that is next year with our<br>Bachelor in AI starting there we've just<br>member so while we're strictly speaking<br>celebrating 50 years of computing<br>because it was 50 years that we had the<br>computer science department it's all<br>slightly more complicated because the<br>mathematicians and the statisticians<br>were there first and the school actually<br>came later so what we actually decided<br>to do is that we celebrate all of us<br>together all the colleagues in all the<br>different fields in the<br>school and our partners and our<br>students we were actually the first<br>school at yato to have a Tero name and<br>at that<br>time the best we could come up with was<br>to translate the English name directly<br>into ter<br>well times have moved on and we're doing<br>this slightly differently now so there<br>two aspects to this one thing is also in<br>looking at starting with stance math<br>then Computing and going forward we're<br>looking at where we're actually going so<br>we're now focusing on different<br>strategic areas perhaps even though some<br>people have already done iion before so<br>within Computing and software<br>engineering we look at artificial<br>intelligence cyber security and human-<br>centered Computing and we're joined by<br>now data analytics mathematics and<br>design so in order to acknowledge this<br>change of the different areas that we<br>represent within the school and also to<br>embrace a new way that the university<br>has found for how to create the Tio<br>names for schools uh we've been seeking<br>for quite some time a new Mari name for<br>the school<br>I'm however totally not qualified to<br>tell you about this so I'd like to have<br>tiaka come back and actually introduce<br>and um explain the new name that we<br>found and that we will then go forward<br>name just thought was<br>down uh cool everybody so<br>um we we wanted to in terms of a new<br>name for a school both in English and<br>Mari we wanted to think of from from a<br>Mari perspective rather than list all<br>the different departments all the<br>different streams of research what was<br>something that<br>encapsulated all of that research what<br>was something that showed us how it all<br>come together um so so I actually worked<br>with a couple of uh colleagues from the<br>mar Department<br>uh Professor Tom Ro<br>and uh hcky 2 piy and I worked with them<br>for a long time um trying to really<br>identify what computer science or what<br>our faculty or what our school what all<br>of this meant um and we we went<br>backwards and forwards for at least six<br>months we started working on this for<br>over like over a year ago um and really<br>it was about<br>um we we think our faculty has the<br>ability<br>to um take something that's really<br>complex and make it simple um and then<br>take something that's simple and<br>extrapolate it out so that it's<br>complex um so there's a<br>saying<br>um which simply means that um from the<br>complex Simplicity and from the<br>Simplicity there is<br>complexity um but that's not that's not<br>the name we used cuz it would be too<br>long uh So eventually we settled and um<br>we haven't made this official yet Neil<br>so that's maybe coming down the track so<br>this is an unofficial unqualified name<br>uh yeah perhaps we should have picked on<br>that before but here we here we are um<br>So eventually we settled on this name<br>here<br>OA<br>OA um and they're thinking there kind of<br>three phrases inside of O day and CA so<br>the first phrase o o was and Marty it's<br>a stream and so the thinking is we have<br>lots of different streams and a little<br>bit of that thinking is in the the<br>artwork that Don rat created there's all<br>of these different streams all of these<br>different areas of research of<br>understanding of Enlightenment that come<br>through our school or our faculty so<br>that's what o is about it's Gathering<br>all of the different streams Ray is<br>about collecting them all together so<br>taking all of these dreams and bringing<br>them together and the thinking is within<br>our faculty we're collecting them all<br>together we're taking the divers we're<br>taking the complex collecting them all<br>together making them simple and then<br>spreading them out and the spreading out<br>is some examples of some of the students<br>that have been talking tonight uh and<br>Kura Kura is a traditional word uh it's<br>got a bunch of different meanings uh it<br>means the color red uh one of the<br>traditional meanings is school but in<br>this example it's<br>treasured so it's the treasured<br>convergence of a number of different<br>streams<br>it was how we could best describe what<br>we've been doing and what we intend to<br>do um in our school so o day CA uh we'll<br>do some steps to make sure it becomes an<br>official name and then hopefully we<br>might start seeing it in some places and<br>for<br>up and we purposely didn't use school<br>department division faculty<br>because unities have a habit of changing<br>Thea I looked at all the papers that we<br>wrote over the years 50 years of paper<br>writing oh my God so um look at this<br>clearly the people who do digital<br>libraries need to name those in the<br>title immediately you actually don't see<br>that the machine learning people say I'm<br>doing machine learning but Digital<br>Library you can absolutely see there if<br>you're wondering about the wind and the<br>turbulence that's the<br>mathematicians so so over the years<br>um all of these Publications so<br>1,500 Publications over 40,000 citations<br>often co-written with students so nine<br>nine 5,000 undergraduates and more than<br>a th000 postgraduates and 142 phds and<br>all of these academics and students<br>working<br>together looking at this you might<br>wonder how did these citations come up<br>who's who gets cited well I can tell you<br>who got most<br>cited and that was actually nope that's<br>the wrong<br>computer um it's this one it's Ian's<br>book together with I and everyone's like<br>yeah yeah not surprised not surprised at<br>all it's the fourth Edition and if you<br>app<br>yeah<br>indeed so Ian of course had a huge<br>influence in the topics we looked at<br>over the time in working with young<br>students so we thought we want to find a<br>way honoring<br>Ian and we set up an Ian Whitney prize<br>in computer signs so we will start this<br>in 2024 and it will be awarded annually<br>to the student with the highest grade<br>point average who's enrolled in the<br>final year of the Bachelor of Computer<br>Science you might cite me so that's why<br>I was so careful in how I phrased<br>this so so this will be going to a<br>student who's really engaged in computer<br>science but if you knew Ian you also<br>know he was not just all about computer<br>science he was also all about his<br>clarinet and BR that to the conferences<br>and playing and in later years I think<br>he's I don't know whether he started<br>painting at least he did do lots of<br>drawing and going out in painting so we<br>felt we also needed to capture that side<br>and together with the School of Arts<br>we've set up an Ian Wht summer research<br>scholarship that will go to a student<br>who works in both the Arts and in<br>computer science and it's set up<br>together with the School of Arts<br>so that will also come into um effect<br>2024 it's been a full year you will have<br>seen that we had so many announcements<br>and talks and what we had done actually<br>we celebrated throughout the whole year<br>this 50-year anniversary we had elected<br>different themes topics for each of the<br>month and then in each month we had a<br>public speaker representing each of the<br>different areas that we now<br>have and if you missed any of them you<br>can actually go to our website they've<br>all been recorded so you can still look<br>them this is my moment to thanking some<br>more people I'd like to thank the people<br>from the library who turns out had a lot<br>of old pictures from G blog and our blog<br>and they made those available to us so<br>you will also find on the website a<br>history of the department and to staff<br>who turned out all had little archives<br>and then came forward with these<br>pictures so we could scan them and bring<br>all of those together so I really<br>recommend having a look at our photo<br>collection there and of course also<br>thank you to all the staff who personed<br>all the Stalls out there and and showing<br>off the interesting research so back to<br>the web page on this page we also<br>showcase some of our graduates so you<br>can find out where they are in the world<br>now what they're doing where they're<br>taking these degrees out into the world<br>and if you're several of you are one of<br>our alumni please also go and add in<br>your memories tell your<br>stories perhaps edit them beforehand<br>however much you want to tell um in<br>public but it would be lovely to bring<br>together all of your different memories<br>we will keep this page and an update and<br>us so to wrap up I have two things still<br>to come<br>one of them is as tiaka had already sent<br>is that we will go out and we all sit on<br>the bleachers and we will get our<br>picture taken because the last time we<br>did this is 20 years ago and really<br>another one is absolutely due to take<br>and so please everybody to do this but<br>that's the last one so there's one more<br>step before that so before we do this we<br>would really like to honor one of our<br>colleagues and I'm really hoping that we<br>managed um to keep this a surprise and<br>to do this I will hand over to BC Neil<br>Quigley again for the procedure thank<br>paper<br>no so um to cap uh um 50 years of<br>innovative thinking and uh doing things<br>uh differently uh from the usual<br>University way um my colleagues in uh<br>Computing and Mathematics uh brought me<br>very interesting challenge um not that<br>long ago actually um especially as these<br>things go so you'll be aware that uh the<br>university has a system of uh University<br>honors um and uh the path uh to get one<br>of those University honors is is usually<br>quite long it requires a university<br>nomination um goes through uh a um a<br>honors Committee of the University<br>Council and uh to academic board uh<br>before uh finally being approved by the<br>full University<br>Council uh so um uh as a test of the<br>fleet footedness of the University<br>Administration we were asked whether we<br>could do all of this in uh a few weeks<br>uh a and uh and to support it I was<br>presented with a significant dossier of<br>uh of uh letters of support uh for the<br>person uh that uh that we're about to to<br>honor um so yes it's um seems fitting uh<br>as the school of computing and<br>mathematical science that celebrates 50<br>years<br>uh that we wanted to recognize someone<br>who's made a really substantial<br>contribution both to the university and<br>the broader community of computing uh<br>over a very significant<br>career uh so gives me great pleasure uh<br>to say that uh uh I'm presenting this<br>evening a university of w medal uh to<br>so you've heard a little bit about Bill<br>this evening but I'll just briefly go<br>some of through some of the things that<br>are in the<br>citation uh bill in B th's academic<br>Journey at the University in February<br>1978 uh as uh as you've heard over the<br>years he's really become an integral<br>part of the University's Legacy in<br>computer science uh positively impacting<br>the lives of countless students and<br>colleagues uh until uh his recent<br>retirement a large number of people<br>wrote in support uh of this<br>nomination just as a a wonderful<br>indication of how many people there are<br>uh that bill has helped he's known for<br>introducing Cutting Edge subject matter<br>into degrees to expose students to new<br>technologies and as an example you his<br>paper on mobile Computing and The<br>Internet of Things in 2019 became a key<br>component of the new smart electrical<br>and electronic engineering degree uh<br>that we offer uh recognizing the need<br>for high school scholarship programs to<br>promote Computing as a study subject<br>Bill also single-handedly established<br>and led uh the University Computer<br>Science undergraduate scholarship<br>program an initiative that's allowed a<br>very large number of students uh to come<br>to the university who otherwise might<br>have been discouraged uh by modern uh<br>tuition<br>fees Bill's well known also for his<br>Outreach efforts with high schools<br>including workshops and events that have<br>introduced students to the exciting<br>world of computing uh inspiring many to<br>pursue degrees at the University his<br>role in organizing and hosting events<br>such as the global game Jam uh and the<br>international Collegiate programming<br>contest has significantly enriched the<br>academic experience of students raised<br>the University's profile on the<br>international stage uh successes Through<br>The Years included having a university<br>of wot team in the World Finals in 2 and<br>Bill's extensive research contributions<br>in areas like computer systems human<br>computer interaction and computer<br>Graphics have not only Advanced the<br>field but also provided a captivating<br>material base uh for the work of others<br>he's authored more than 80 journal and<br>Conference papers and supervised more<br>than 70 students in honors degrees<br>dissertations Masters and and PhD thesis<br>Bill's willingness to share knowledge<br>and his dedication to assisting others<br>is regarded by all those who wrote as<br>one of the Hallmarks uh of his<br>career uh so uh for a really Exemplar<br>exemplary contribution to computer<br>science at this University it's my<br>pleasure to present a university of wut<br>bill<br>very<br>well yes I explained to somebody I I<br>really only speak in 50 minutes slabs<br>and I'm quite good at that I mean if you<br>st me I will stop at 15 minutes so<br>encouraging unless it's a two-hour<br>lecture period um this came as a<br>complete utter and total<br>surprise um yeah so thank you everybody<br>for your support and I guess thank you<br>also for the opportunity over all these<br>years to be part of so many different<br>and exciting things think and certainly<br>uh part of the academic career that I've<br>valued very much that I've basically<br>been able allowed to do whatever I want<br>to yeah well I know was allowed to but I<br>I've done whatever I wanted nobody's<br>complained and I I have enjoyed all of<br>that that so thank you Neil thank you<br>everybody I won't continue for the<br>remainder of the 50<br>minut uh C everyone um this wasn't on<br>the agenda these were just underneath my<br>chair so I thought I might give them out<br>um so I've got some guests for our<br>speakers the first one is for you Bill<br>but I'm stting at doesn't compete to at<br>University middle<br>much and just before I move on um again<br>Mark way Neil um thank you to the<br>university for allowing us to honor one<br>of our colleagues in this way at such<br>short notice and not telling him<br>beforehand so T not we we appreciate it<br>um<br>Thomas<br>Andrew<br>Zach um in a couple more years some of<br>you young ones maybe we'll be looking at<br>University medals as well who who can<br>say okay um a couple of things and then<br>that's us um I want to close us off for<br>the Kut here before we go and take our<br>photo um before that uh I just want to<br>thank everybody for for coming tonight<br>and sharing um a little bit of what's<br>been a massive 50 years in computer<br>science uh the places we've been the the<br>the fields we've reached out to the<br>people we've touched has been amazing so<br>thank you everybody for being here to<br>celebrate that um and also a special<br>thanks to Ana to Carol to all of the<br>team who put up all of the stores and<br>who will be the last ones home tonight<br>because they've got to take them all<br>down again um thanks to everybody who's<br>helped make these 50 years of computer<br>science um happen so a big round of<br>applause to all of those people thank<br>you um so two two quick things before I<br>do a here I just wanted to um mention so<br>same<br>um if you take the center part of the<br>hariki um where is the place for the<br>Kuru to<br>sing<br>um<br>to um if you were to ask me what is the<br>most important thing in the world I<br>would say it's people it's people it's<br>people and I just want to extrapolate on<br>that it's not just like a person but<br>it's the intermingling of people it's<br>the sharing of ideas it's the coming<br>together it's the working together in<br>collaboration uh perhaps it's the late<br>night in the basement of G block all of<br>those steps that's what the saying is<br>about<br>so I just want to acknowledge everyone<br>for being a part of all of that coming<br>together<br>here so K everybody okay closing katakia<br>and basically this katakia is just about<br>taking everything that's within us<br>embracing it and then taking it home<br>so<br>okay so my last world tonight is to<br>gather everybody in the steps out here<br>for a photo and then that's us for<br>tonight there's still I think drinks<br>maybe flying maybe some food enjoy<br>yourself catch up with everybody thank<br>you very much everybody Jo<br>order</p></main><footer style="margin-top: 2rem; background: #0001; padding: 2rem; text-align: center;"><p>We Are The University</p><ul
