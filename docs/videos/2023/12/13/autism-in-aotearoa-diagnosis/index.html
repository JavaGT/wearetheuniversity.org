It was a<br>beginning of something new<br>and a kind of a challenge that<br>we were, we were ready for,<br>but it put us on a good<br>platform of this is,<br>this is the start of something<br>and the continuation, how we,<br>how we're gonna approach it.<br>Tēnā koutou katoa<br>Ko Leon Ellison tōku ingoa<br>My name's Leon Ellison and I'm a father<br>of a 5-year-old daughter, Te Tai Amokura Ellison<br>and I'm part of the<br>discussion group for today.<br>Big shout out to my<br>beautiful wife, Rongorito Ellison.<br>Kia ora.<br>Well, I suppose the very<br>first time, we weren't aware<br>of any autism in the family<br>or anything, so it wasn't on our minds.<br>And I had done a psychology undergrad,<br>so I'd done like a short course on autism<br>and I thought it was a<br>child rocking in the corner,<br>not letting you touch them.<br>And she was so affectionate<br>and you know, all these things<br>that went against the<br>stigma that we were taught.<br>So it wasn't on my mind at all.<br>And then we had had a second baby<br>and she started having meltdowns<br>and we thought, this is strange.<br>And I started Googling<br>how to help her adjust<br>to the new baby and<br>everything that came up.<br>I was thinking she doesn't have<br>near the level of engagement<br>to understand like a present from her baby <br>sister or whatever.<br>And then the word engagement in my head<br>and I was like, oh,<br>autism maybe, you know?<br>So I had a little, pulled out the DSM<br>and had a look and I was like, ah.<br>Immediately I was just sure,<br>because I was just instantly sure,<br>but my husband took a<br>bit, a bit more time.<br>And yeah.<br>And then after<br>that we were really,<br>we were pretty well supported.<br>Plunket didn't believe me, they<br>were saying, "she makes eye contact".<br>So I went around Plunket<br>and got a referral and then,<br>um,<br>and then after that it was really good.<br>Got in touch with Autism New<br>Zealand, they gave information,<br>went to the spectrum<br>playgroup, met other people.<br>But we won the postcode lottery<br>because if you live in the Hutt Valley,<br>there's a lot of good support.<br>And I hear that that's not the<br>case in the rest of the country.<br>And she was really young<br>and we were speed tracked<br>because if you're under two,<br>there's a much better service<br>for identification and support.<br>And so then we went on to<br>have three more children<br>and all four of them by now,<br>we knew what we were looking at<br>and all four of them<br>were diagnosed by two.<br>I mean, there were hiccups<br>and there were things<br>that didn't go exactly the way we would've<br>thought would be best.<br>But on the whole, um, pretty<br>straightforward for our family.<br>Hi, I'm Tabitha Harlow.<br>I'm a parent to four autistic children<br>aged two, four, six, and eight.<br>My diagnosis journey was quite a mess.<br>I mean, around the time<br>that I started thinking I was autistic,<br>I'd already lost contact with my family<br>because of the breakdowns, I<br>had really poor mental health.<br>I'd been trying to end<br>my life at least once<br>a month for about four years.<br>And I had been in the<br>mental health services<br>and had been misdiagnosed.<br>So I went to my doctor<br>and I asked what do I do if<br>I think I might be autistic?<br>And it just happened that we<br>had a psychologist at my GP<br>practice who specialised in autism.<br>So I went and saw her and<br>it was still complicated<br>because the way things<br>work, I had to be referred<br>to my mental health<br>team 'cause I was in a mental health team.<br>So she sent a referral<br>and when they refused<br>to assess me, she assessed me anyway.<br>The mental health<br>services tried to stop it, tried<br>to make it, make sure it couldn't happen.<br>But I got diagnosed<br>because it was very<br>obvious that I was autistic<br>and my diagnosis is what saved my life.<br>But for a year<br>after getting my diagnosis, I had to fight<br>with mental health services<br>because they were trying<br>to remove my diagnosis<br>because they didn't like it.<br>Which was really hard<br>because it was like, well,<br>it stopped my attempts at ending my life,<br>so why would you want to remove it?<br>In terms of community, pre-diagnosis,<br>when I was thinking I was<br>autistic, it was kind of challenging.<br>So I'd say to someone,<br>"Oh, I think I'm autistic."<br>And they'd be like, "Oh<br>no, you're not autistic."<br>"Oh no, you're fine, like, you're,<br>don't worry about it, you're normal."<br>Um.<br>Which was really frustrating<br>because those same people would say<br>that I was really struggling<br>before I said that I might be autistic.<br>And then I got diagnosed<br>and it was like,<br>"Oh, but you're high functioning."<br>"Oh, but everyone's autistic."<br>And it was just really frustrating.<br>Um.<br>So then I wrote my book and<br>that has helped a lot of things.<br>Yeah.<br>I am Chanelle Moriah.<br>I am an autistic adult<br>and I work as an autistic<br>advisor at Autism New Zealand.<br>And I'm an author and<br>illustrator of my two books.<br>In terms of myself and my whānau,<br>I have whānau members who are diagnosed,<br>but I'm not diagnosed.<br>I don't have autism myself.<br>But I do, um, lead this clinic<br>that we have here in the centre.<br>And we have, um, generally,<br>we're supporting, um, whānau<br>with children under five.<br>So we see a variety of<br>kind of identification<br>and diagnosis journeys, I<br>would say, within our clinic.<br>So, we have children come to<br>us who have been diagnosed<br>through, um, the official pathway<br>and referred from the<br>hospital to come see us.<br>But we also have a lot of parents coming<br>to us whose children aren't yet diagnosed.<br>And so for us, um, we<br>don't say that you have<br>to have an autism diagnosis in order<br>to receive our services.<br>So if we have a whānau who comes to us<br>and their child is not diagnosed yet,<br>what we'll do is, we'll do<br>a little kind of screener,<br>a few questions and things<br>to see if there's some<br>signs of autism there.<br>Um, so some key ones might be<br>perhaps not waving to say hello<br>or goodbye, or having,<br>um, kind of different<br>eye contact from neurotypical<br>people, things like that.<br>So if we see that there's<br>enough signs there,<br>we'll say you can access our services.<br>And I think that's really important<br>because the diagnostic journey<br>as Chanelle indicates can be<br>really hard.<br>Depending, you know, there's<br>often quite a long wait.<br>So we know that in Aotearoa<br>the average<br>age of diagnosis is six,<br>if we were waiting for diagnosis,<br>we wouldn't be seeing so many whānau.<br>We wanna get in there with the signs.<br>And I think from our perspective,<br>because we don't do diagnosis,<br>if a child doesn't go on<br>to receive a diagnosis,<br>that's actually okay.<br>You know, we, we say we don't<br>know if your child's gonna go<br>on to receive a diagnosis or not,<br>but there's some signs here<br>and maybe we could help.<br>So yeah, I'd say that's<br>kind of the journey<br>for our whānau, um, in that space.<br>Kia ora, I'm Hannah Waddington.<br>I'm clinic lead of the Victoria University of Wellington Autism Clinic,<br>and I also have autistic whānau members.<br>How has an autism diagnosis<br>changed things for you and your whānau?<br>My diagnosis significantly<br>improved my mental health,<br>and saved my life, and got me out<br>of being in the hospital so often.<br>I was able to put in the right tools<br>and understand myself better<br>and develop a little<br>bit of self-confidence<br>because I was always feeling<br>like I was doing things wrong.<br>So, learning who I was and what<br>I needed was really helpful.<br>And being able to explain<br>that to people around me meant<br>that I have been able to<br>get a bit closer to people.<br>Because we're actually<br>understanding each other<br>in terms of communication.<br>Um, in terms of<br>my family, I mentioned that<br>I didn't have contact with them before.<br>After my diagnosis, we<br>were able to fix a lot<br>of those relationships.<br>We had more of an<br>understanding of each other.<br>I understood why my parents<br>were frustrated with some<br>of the things I was<br>doing, because honestly<br>I was very stubborn and I<br>challenged every value they<br>had and every moral.<br>And I, I wasn't an easy child.<br>Um,<br>On the other hand, they,<br>they now have a better<br>understanding of my<br>communication, and my needs,<br>and they're not just being like,<br>"Oh, we're going out now. You need to come."<br>It's, "Okay. You actually need time to prepare for that."<br>Or, "You might need some quiet time,<br>I'm gonna leave you alone for that time."<br>For our whānau,<br>it's, like, became a little<br>bit more patient with things<br>and I think it brought me<br>and my wife a lot closer<br>and a lot more supportive of<br>each other for, that we need<br>to be there for our daughter<br>and just give everyone perspective on,<br>I've got a big whānau and a wider whānau, we both do.<br>And it's just, yeah, I guess<br>the more patience, the<br>more, look at the holistic<br>side of the child rather<br>than their, their meaning<br>to do these not, bad things,<br>but just our non-typical.<br>Yeah, not neurotypical is<br>the wording sometimes used,<br>but it's, yeah, it's<br>more teaches you patience<br>and it's not the diagnosis,<br>as such, it's just, "Oh, okay,<br>this is her little quirk,<br>or this is her difference."<br>Yeah, so I think exactly<br>like we have families coming in<br>at different stages of<br>being diagnosed or not,<br>we also have families coming<br>in at all different stages<br>of accepting the diagnosis, right?<br>And so it's really<br>important for us to take families<br>where they're at and try<br>and move them towards the really<br>positive place of accepting<br>and understanding this<br>diagnosis is a really great way<br>of understanding their child.<br>You know, um, when you,<br>and you've talked to me about<br>this, Tabitha, you know,<br>when you Google things,<br>it can be really scary,<br>you can hear a lot of negative stuff,<br>you can come in with all these<br>ideas about what autism is.<br>So I really see a big job<br>for us at the clinic is<br>supporting parents to<br>go through that journey<br>of accepting their child's diagnosis<br>and through parents, helping the child<br>to be more accepting<br>of themselves as well.<br>So really the idea, you know,<br>that autism is a difference,<br>not a deficit or a disorder,<br>your child's gonna have huge<br>things that they can do.<br>Amazing strengths<br>and yes, of course some challenges<br>that we will support with.<br>So that gentle, I think,<br>that gentle reframe for our families.<br>But what's really exciting I think is, um,<br>even in the past couple<br>of years, we have a lot<br>of families coming in<br>who are really accepting<br>and embracing of the<br>diagnosis straight away.<br>I think that's because there's<br>a lot more stuff out there<br>about being accepting and<br>being neurodiversity affirming.<br>So, um, that's, yeah, a really cool<br>and exciting thing that we are seeing now.<br>Everything has changed.<br>I mean, no one knows the future.<br>I don't know what would've<br>been in store for us had this,<br>you know, not entered our journey,<br>but our, our life is pretty,<br>pretty much revolves<br>around supporting the needs<br>that they have right now and<br>trying to create real quality<br>of life for everybody,<br>and, um, making sure<br>that we are advocating everywhere we go.<br>And, um, my both my husband<br>and myself have retrained<br>in careers related.<br>Um.<br>So, its.<br>There's, there's no end to<br>how much it's changed things<br>for us, but also like<br>as, as people, um, I mean,<br>previously, I always sort<br>of worked in mental health, um<br>and worked in fields, you know, where,<br>where diagnosis was a very common word<br>and I didn't, didn't understand autism<br>and didn't thought I did.<br>And I've learned so much about it<br>and about, um, neurodiversity<br>in general and how much people<br>out there don't understand<br>and they have no reason to understand.<br>Yeah, yeah.<br>And I, I thought<br>I was the kind of person<br>who would have been, you know,<br>understood this and I didn't.<br>And I think back to some of<br>the things I thought in the<br>early days and I'm like, oh<br>my goodness, yeah, how stupid,<br>you know, what, what did I say to people?<br>So yeah, it's just,<br>it's just massively<br>changed me as a person and how I see it.<br>It changes your, um, perspective on<br>what you were like as a child<br>and how you interacted<br>when you're at school and<br>because you learn so much<br>about it, you go, "Oh,<br>that's why that kid was like that."<br>God, I was, I was such an<br>egg, you know.<br>They're a kid so you, you<br>give that as a an excuse,<br>but it was still like, oh, you,<br>you feel so much, like, sorrow<br>for the, the person that did struggle<br>and you, you put it up to the parents<br>and say, oh, were they<br>giving them, the, as much support<br>as they did in the school or the,<br>but having another child<br>kind of changed our,<br>how we parent them and how we<br>teach them about their sister.<br>So she's the middle child<br>and we've got a older boy who's<br>understanding a little bit<br>more, but just our young<br>one, he's only three now too.<br>Two, sorry.<br>He's kind of getting used to,<br>my sister's not talking yet<br>and she's got different<br>ways about how she wants<br>to eat her food and stuff like that.<br>So I'd, yeah, it's changed<br>how we parent, how we show<br>our other offspring how to<br>best support his sister.<br>Yeah.<br>I think having an understanding<br>of neurodivergence definitely helps you<br>have more patience and kindness<br>and you see people more as<br>individuals rather than like the,<br>the norm of society and expectations.<br>You're more willing to revisit<br>what the behaviours mean.<br>Something that I<br>really got from listening<br>to autistic adults, like<br>yourself, is the idea<br>that people often say, "Oh,<br>a label is bad."<br>You know, you don't<br>wanna label your child,<br>but it's just being pointed out to me,<br>children, exactly what you said,<br>like, kids in the past,<br>children always are given labels,<br>but the labels are worse.<br>They're like naughty, or weird,<br>or bad, or all of those.<br>Or lazy.<br>Yeah.<br>All of those kind of things.<br>And when you reframe it<br>to neurodivergence, autistic, it can come<br>with understanding rather<br>than judgement, you know?<br>So I just do really<br>love that for diagnosis as well.<br>Yeah, like I was often seen<br>as disrespectful or rude<br>because I didn't understand the concept<br>of authority or hierarchy.<br>So I treated everyone as<br>though they were my equals.<br>And me talking to authority<br>figures the same way I talked<br>to friends was considered<br>disrespectful and rude.<br>Like, you don't ask them questions<br>or tell them they're wrong<br>or you know, that's not what<br>children are meant to do.<br>And so I was constantly<br>getting in trouble just<br>because I saw people as<br>equals.<br>It's really annoying.<br>As Hannah and Chanelle<br>know, that through, through<br>discovering what was going<br>on with my kids, we realised<br>that I have such a significant<br>amount of autistic traits<br>that it did.<br>It made me look back into my past<br>and looked at so many<br>things that, um, started<br>to really make sense<br>and make me almost forgive<br>myself a bit, as well.<br>Yeah.<br>And, um, I'm still like very<br>much at the beginning of all<br>of that for me.<br>But it does,<br>it makes you rethink everything<br>that happened in the past and<br>yeah, the people that I met,<br>and interactions I had,<br>and things in my family that didn't fit.<br>Yeah, it's great.<br>It's great to have awareness.<br>Although I am not a parent,<br>obviously,<br>um.<br>You could be a parent.<br>Well...<br>[Laughs]<br>One thing I think I've realised<br>and acknowledged a lot since<br>getting my diagnosis is<br>how hard that could be, for a parent.<br>Um, I mean, especially<br>for parents of people<br>who get diagnosed so late.<br>Like, I was diagnosed at 21<br>and I know my mum felt<br>like she'd failed so badly<br>because of all of the things she'd missed<br>and the way she'd treated me<br>and how that impacted me<br>as an autistic person.<br>So I, I can see how that<br>can be a very hard journey<br>for a lot of parents as well.<br>From us as, like, te ao Māori, we, we<br>only speak Māori in our house<br>and we've come from kōhanga<br>and kura Māori background.<br>It's, it's, like there's a, a group<br>for the Māori side as well<br>and there's people that have<br>um<br>changed the label<br>and got it to a point<br>where it's more accepted.<br>Māori's real structure-based<br>and, you know, like different<br>things on the marae<br>or at Kōhanga where we, we've<br>been through, um, situations<br>where they're going, "Oh, she's<br>just a, like a no-ears girl<br>or she's, she's, she's just a, a bad kid."<br>But, re, refocus,<br>refocusing the knowledge<br>on, "This is just her quirk.<br>This is just her norm."<br>It, it gives perspective more<br>so than what we actually know,<br>or what the norm is.<br>I think it comes back to something<br>that we've been touching on a lot.<br>Just the idea that it can bring<br>compassion and understanding, right?<br>Rather than pre-judging things<br>or making certain assumptions.<br>How was sharing a diagnosis with others?<br>Yeah, I'm sad that my wife isn't here<br>because she is kind of anxious<br>and not who she tells,<br>but the reaction she'll get<br>or the unknown factor of, oh, people go,<br>oh yes, so what's that?<br>Or what's, and you almost feel<br>like you have to explain them<br>and give them the big<br>scientific explanation,<br>whereas I'm kind of like,<br>"There's a big spectrum<br>and some people like it<br>their butter on their toast<br>and some people like it on the<br>side."<br>And that's how you try<br>and explain to them through<br>experiences rather than this is,<br>this is her diagnosis, this is her,<br>the stigma is usually it's<br>coming with a bad thing<br>or this is why she's like this.<br>Or you've read stories of, um,<br>their, their focuses are really<br>um,<br>out of this world and they've got yeah.<br>Traits that I, I don't wanna say positive,<br>but yeah, different.<br>And it, it,<br>it brightens up your, your day I reckon.<br>Just to know and to try<br>and search for those ones<br>inside your, inside your kid.<br>Yeah.<br>How about you Hannah?<br>How is sharing the diagnosis<br>or health, how's trying<br>to explain it to people?<br>How do you find that and<br>Yeah, I guess it's<br>something that we, um, talk<br>to parents about a lot and and<br>how to, to share and support.<br>And I think the shame is often the stigma<br>that exists within the community so that,<br>I can't say I guarantee,<br>but you'll tell people<br>that your child is autistic<br>and they'll take it totally fine, you know.<br>I'm hoping that, like,<br>five years from now, say,<br>you can tell someone your<br>child is autistic and<br>everyone will be totally fine.<br>Tabitha's looking at me like maybe<br>that's still optimistic.<br>Five years.<br>[Laughs]<br>Yeah, I think it's<br>different for every family<br>and you probably just wanna<br>perhaps support them of<br>how they can frame it to others.<br>So like what you're saying,<br>Leon, is you sometimes have<br>to put it in a not scary<br>way, you know, maybe you're<br>between the family members or, um, friends<br>or things you could say, "Oh look,<br>my child's had this autism diagnosis<br>and they're still the same kid, you know,<br>they're still totally<br>the same kid as they were<br>before the diagnosis.<br>This has helped us to<br>understand it better.<br>It means that, um, you<br>know, what I'd like you<br>to know about my kid is<br>she loves these things<br>and this is what really<br>you can do to help her."<br>Or whatever, you know, so<br>just frame it like, "Hey, um,<br>this is what's going on,<br>here's how you can help,<br>here's what you can do."<br>Rather than this big<br>scary thing, I reckon.<br>So sometimes I'm like, oh, to my friends<br>and some, I'm not sure if<br>this is just a male thing,<br>but I'm like, "Oh, she's kind of like,<br>she doesn't communicate through words or,<br>but you know, she can run really fast<br>and she, she's a really good climber<br>and those sorts of things."<br>It's like, um, I'm not sure<br>if a female perspective<br>is you need more, um, information<br>or you need, "Oh, so<br>what exactly is that?"<br>Whereas like male, male's<br>kinda like, oh yes, she's,<br>she's struggling in these parts,<br>but these are the, these are<br>the cool things that she does<br>or she's really, she gives out good hugs<br>and this, that kind, that<br>sort of thing, yeah.<br>And guys are just like, cool.<br>Yeah.<br>Yeah. Cool. Sounds cool.<br>Yeah. Yeah.<br>That's just my, my guy,<br>guy, my male perspective.<br>What about you, Tabitha?<br>How was your sharing of diagnosis or?<br>Yeah, um, I don't know.<br>I've, I tend to be a bit of an oversharer<br>so I'm never afraid to [laughs]<br>Providing a lot of helpful<br>information, perhaps.<br>Yeah, yeah.<br>And, um, you know,<br>and it is something I'm just like, I'm<br>so passionate about advocating for now<br>and I'm sometimes a bit lost<br>between the two worlds of<br>um,<br>what am I doing that's best for my child,<br>specifically, advocating<br>for them versus trying<br>to break down the stigma of autism<br>and get people to recognise<br>what a neurodivergence really is.<br>Because, so for example, I used to<br>like, often have those big<br>conversations with people<br>about my kid's diagnosis<br>and also pointing out, like<br>you suggest, often wanting<br>to point out all of the<br>really super positive things.<br>Like for example, my two<br>boys, they're hyperlexic.<br>They've both been reading<br>since they were one.<br>And you say that to someone<br>who doesn't understand autism<br>and it immediately breaks<br>down a little picture<br>that they've got in their head<br>that this person is not capable.<br>You know what I mean?<br>And you want to,<br>you want to try and teach people that.<br>The other analogy I love<br>is it's kind of like<br>introverted versus extroverted.<br>It's, it's a difference<br>and nobody,<br>you never tell someone,<br>my child's introverted<br>and they're like, I'm so sorry.<br>Yeah.<br>But people say that<br>to you if you tell them about the autism.<br>So it's just explaining,<br>it's a difference.<br>Some of the things, you know,<br>about being introverted can<br>make life more difficult.<br>You need to make certain accommodations.<br>It's on a way smaller scale.<br>I'm definitely not wanting to<br>dismiss how big it is to be<br>autistic in our current<br>world, the way it is,<br>but speaking in that kind<br>of language to people gets it across.<br>But at the same time I'm, I'm<br>just learning, I'm starting<br>to learn now that there's<br>actually a thing about<br>not outing your child.<br>So not sharing their diagnosis<br>with people without their consent.<br>My kids aren't really at<br>that age, so I'm starting<br>to be a little bit more thoughtful<br>and a little bit more careful about that<br>because there's both sides.<br>I wanna be the person I wanna be for,<br>for the autism community<br>and then I wanna be the best<br>parent I can for my kids.<br>What's your thoughts on that<br>Chanelle,<br>not outing your child?<br>Yeah, it's quite a big conversation<br>among the autistic community.<br>It is kind of a balance, right?<br>Like there's some ways in<br>which you do need to share<br>that diagnosis in order to<br>get the support for the child<br>and helping them in social situations.<br>Sometimes it's helpful to<br>have kids understand it<br>but at the same time, it's tricky<br>because the child may not<br>want people to know that,<br>and you've gotta prepare<br>them for future situations.<br>So telling kids in school<br>might follow them to college.<br>Yeah.<br>Not being outed is<br>something, I mean, I've also had<br>to deal with in the<br>sense that when I first<br>released my book, I<br>didn't consider the fact<br>that I was removing the<br>luxury of deciding when<br>and how I tell people.<br>Oh, yeah.<br>It's a big deal.<br>Yeah.<br>Um, so I can understand how<br>some autistic people might<br>not be keen on their parents<br>sharing it with people.<br>But, I think people underestimate kids<br>and they can actually share<br>their opinions a lot earlier<br>than people realise<br>and they may not understand<br>the full extent of it.<br>But yeah, it's still a<br>conversation you can have.<br>Um, yeah.<br>And as for sharing diagnosis,<br>obviously my situation's<br>a little bit complicated<br>and mixed.<br>Early in the<br>journey it was quite hard<br>because I'd receive comments like, oh,<br>but everyone's a little bit autistic.<br>And then I'd have to educate them on<br>how the spectrum isn't linear.<br>And autistic traits<br>are still human traits.<br>That doesn't mean<br>everyone's autistic, um, or, or,<br>but you are high functioning<br>and it's like, well<br>that's really invalidating<br>'cause I can't cook a meal by<br>myself, I can't clean my room.<br>How is that "high functioning"?<br>Um.<br>I was burning out from masking as well.<br>Um.<br>And then I guess<br>because my book's come out,<br>like, I don't really get<br>to choose when to share,<br>which does mean that I've become a bit<br>of a public figure and people see my story<br>and they relate to it<br>and they're like, "Oh,<br>I feel less alone with this person."<br>So I get lots of people asking to meet,<br>which is a lot to deal with.<br>Yeah, I think it, it's, a<br>bit exhausting at times.<br>Just you don't really know what kind<br>of response you're gonna<br>get when you share it.<br>And sometimes I've had situations<br>where someone's been mad at me<br>and I've explained to them, "I'm sorry,<br>like, I didn't understand I<br>was supposed to do this thing<br>because I'm autistic."<br>And they would think that<br>I was using it as an excuse<br>and I'd have to explain like, "No,<br>I'm explaining my situation."<br>Yeah.<br>So it's just, it's frustrating<br>and tiring a lot of the time.<br>So sometimes I just don't<br>really wanna share it.<br>But it is part of my role in life.<br>My whole life revolves<br>around neurodivergence,<br>my job, everything.<br>Definitely, there are times<br>where it does bring me down<br>because there's so much unnoticed hate,<br>I suppose, like the way<br>we talk about autism,<br>people don't realise how negative it is.<br>It'll be like, oh sorry, I'll that up.<br>It'll be like, "Oh they're succeeding<br>despite being autistic."<br>Or, "Oh they overcame their autism<br>to do this thing."<br>Or, you know.<br>Yeah.<br>Yeah. It's, I don't know.<br>Or people thinking that<br>you can't do things.<br>Like if people knew that I<br>couldn't cook a meal or look<br>and clean my room or stuff, they'd think<br>that I can't have a job.<br>I'm really good at my job.<br>You are.<br>They're just very different things<br>that executive functioning side<br>of things people don't understand.<br>Yeah. It's a mix of a journey.<br>Positive, negative, hard, tiring.<br>Yeah.<br>Speaking, um, from<br>what I think my wife's<br>perspective would be too,<br>of hearing it, sometimes it's<br>like when they're having<br>meltdowns at the supermarket<br>or something, you almost<br>feel obliged to go,<br>oh sorry, she's autistic.<br>Or she's, yeah, this is why<br>she's screaming so hard.<br>And it's like, some people,<br>some kids just have, um,<br>meltdowns 'cause they,<br>they're not allowed lollies<br>or they're not allowed.<br>It's, it's not like you,<br>you have to share it<br>because this is why she's not being<br>the perfect kid or something like that.<br>So yeah, in those instances<br>it's really, yeah,<br>it's difficult sometimes<br>as a parent going, do we,<br>do we always need to tell people.<br>I mean, there are ways to<br>share it without making<br>it about being autistic.<br>I mean you can explain that<br>the kid finds noises really painful.<br>Yeah.<br>Or they, um, don't understand metaphors.<br>Yeah.<br>You know, you can<br>explain it that way.<br>Which still allows them the<br>choice of whether they disclose.<br>Yeah.<br>Sometimes when it's complete<br>randoms, I'm just like, ah,<br>like nevermind.<br>Yeah. Yeah.<br>You definitely have to have<br>like, quite a tough skin<br>as a parent I think.<br>Yeah, absolutely.<br>Like you need to get<br>so much judgement from community<br>based on how the child acts<br>and a lot of neurodivergent<br>people are seen as naughty<br>and disruptive and stubborn.<br>So yeah, I can, I can see how hard<br>that might be tricky to navigate.<br>I also think it's a journey<br>for parents like children, as well.<br>And you can't expect<br>any parent to be, have<br>that tough skin straight away, you know?<br>So you have to have a lot<br>of empathy for, yeah,<br>It's totally stressful<br>to you for you to go<br>to the supermarket and<br>have your child be upset<br>and feel like everyone's<br>looking at you and judging you<br>and it takes some time<br>to reframe like, hey man,<br>this is a societal issue.<br>You're so right that lots<br>of people have these<br>challenges for whatever reason.<br>And you'd hope that in society<br>we could just be like, yep,<br>you know, this is a an issue,<br>there's some things going on,<br>but you know, we won't<br>be passing judgement here.<br>You know? Yeah.<br>Recognising that someone<br>else's diagnosis might be hard<br>for you and it, I, I don't<br>know, like people feel bad<br>for thinking it's hard for themselves<br>or getting, grieving that process,<br>but I think it's fair like, yeah,<br>that person is living as an<br>autistic person or an ADHD<br>and that might be hard,<br>but that does impact other people as well.<br>And it's okay for both to happen.<br>Absolutely.<br>Support that thick-skinned kind of<br>aura that you have to hold.<br>And we're so lucky that we're<br>in a small community in Ōtaki<br>and we've got big, big whānau<br>that have just, like, complete support<br>and almost like she's the<br>the special one out of us<br>and she's got those special powers that<br>almost enlightens lots<br>of people when they see her and stuff.<br>So yeah, we are real, we are<br>really lucky in the sense<br>that we've got that<br>community behind us as well.<br>The other thing I struggled with in terms<br>of sharing my diagnosis is<br>that sometimes I'd be met<br>with people being like, "Oh,<br>your mum must be like so good."<br>Or like, that it's all about my mum.<br>Wow.<br>Like, when my book came out right,<br>media asked to talk to my mom<br>who I was barely in contact with.<br>Because they're like, "Oh<br>your, your mum must be<br>so proud of this success."<br>It's my success.<br>You're a grown human.<br>And I mean that does come<br>into that, like, narrative of<br>parents being like heroes<br>for having autistic children.<br>And that's quite hard to<br>navigate as an autistic person<br>because a lot of autistic<br>people like myself<br>who have lower support<br>needs get attacked online<br>by these parents who think<br>that they're better than other parents<br>because they have an autistic child<br>and then they have<br>autistic people telling no.<br>Yeah.<br>Something I should clarify is that<br>in real life people are<br>constantly like, "Oh my God,<br>you must be, you're so amazing.<br>How do you do it?"<br>I'm like,<br>"They're my kids. I love them.<br>It's easy."<br>And then, and then it's the online world.<br>It's actually the<br>autistic adults that have<br>so much stuff going on<br>that they see that's awful<br>that they've kind of<br>projecting that on all parents.<br>Yeah.<br>And some research<br>we did recently, one<br>of the findings that I'm<br>most excited about was<br>that like in our sample<br>of participants there was<br>so much agreement, you know, like parents<br>and autistic adults and professionals<br>agreed about a lot of things.<br>And so I think you can get<br>this impression when you find<br>yourself in these like<br>polarised online spaces maybe<br>that there's these huge disagreements.<br>But what's exciting<br>and what I try to bring myself<br>back to is these, mostly,<br>areas of agreement and really trying<br>to find the right ways together.<br>And that's also what's<br>so cool about this panel<br>and things like that, right?<br>Like we're all coming from<br>different perspectives<br>and having a chat about it.<br>Finding the majority of people<br>genuinely mean well, I feel.<br>What can be done to support people<br>once an individual is diagnosed?<br>There are so many<br>different disconnected services<br>and it's really hard<br>to figure it all out<br>once you get a diagnosis.<br>Like that's so overwhelming.<br>So having someone to help<br>navigate that is helpful.<br>Another is just like educating<br>yourself on neurodivergence.<br>Yeah.<br>So I think I've already<br>kind of highlighted<br>that the system for<br>identification and diagnosis<br>and then support in New Zealand is not<br>working as it should be, right?<br>So we know that it's a<br>really long waiting list<br>for diagnosis, but then<br>we also know it's a really<br>long waiting list for support.<br>And in Wellington things are a bit<br>better than perhaps in other places.<br>But you know, you, a common<br>experience would be to go<br>to the child development service<br>to be told about the diagnosis,<br>to be given a thousand like pamphlets<br>and various different things that you need<br>to navigate yourself to contact<br>them and to be told time<br>after time that there's waiting lists.<br>So research that we've done<br>is like the biggest barriers<br>to accessing support once you've got a<br>diagnosis is the waiting list.<br>That's the number one<br>barrier, right? Yeah.<br>How disheartening is it to have gone<br>through this whole wait to find out<br>and then another whole wait<br>being feel like you've left<br>all by yourself to find that<br>support, but also to even try<br>and navigate it yourself, right?<br>To like work out what<br>support's gonna be right<br>for my child, where do I go?<br>I mean that, that's one of<br>the big barriers I've found is<br>that it needs to be, there needs<br>to be something centralised.<br>Yes.<br>Something centralised<br>because you think you have the answers<br>or you think you've been sent<br>this one person who's gonna<br>come to your house and tell<br>things to you and that's great.<br>And I feel like I'm in their hands<br>and then I discover later, hey,<br>this exists and that exists<br>and the other exists, you know.<br>I'm still learning new things.<br>One other thing that's really<br>cool that we did with Chanelle<br>and a few other autistic<br>adults is we did this<br>neurodiversity workshop<br>thing where parents<br>learnt about autism as a form<br>of neurodivergence, from autistic people.<br>If you find out<br>someone's been diagnosed,<br>don't be like, "Oh no you're not."<br>Or, "But you don't look it."<br>Respond with, "What<br>does that mean for you?<br>How can I help you? How can I learn?"<br>You know.<br>The other<br>thing is, like, recognising<br>that accommodations that autistic<br>or neurodivergent people need are the same<br>as things like glasses or<br>wheelchairs or hearing aids.<br>They need them.<br>You cannot just give<br>them to them sometimes<br>or remove them when they're being naughty.<br>They need their accommodations<br>all the time. Yeah.<br>I'm always in the<br>thinking of the parent,<br>like the parents are the biggest<br>support for the child<br>and 'cause our daughter's only<br>five,<br>you know, we are the ones<br>that are best support, supportive of her.<br>It's just interesting to<br>hear your side of this story, Chanelle.<br>Like, commend you for that<br>21 years of not knowing,<br>and it's, it's, it's<br>really interesting and.<br>Like I do wish I was diagnosed earlier,<br>but at the same time if<br>I'd been diagnosed younger,<br>I wouldn't have been allowed<br>to move to New Zealand.<br>If I'd been diagnosed younger,<br>I probably would've struggled<br>with school because I would've<br>really, really struggled<br>with feeling like I didn't fit in.<br>I already struggled with that.<br>I felt really alone at school.<br>But having a diagnosis,<br>I think I, I would've struggled with that.<br>So it's kind of hard.<br>Like I wish I knew, but<br>I also am glad I didn't.<br>But at the same time, like it<br>could have come much earlier<br>and I probably wouldn't have had<br>as much struggle with my mental health.<br>This is another question<br>that I really love my wife<br>to be here 'cause she's lots of the<br>support that we seek out.<br>She'd be the first port of contact<br>and I'm kind of like the, "Oh what,<br>what's this email for again?"<br>Or, "Who's what, what<br>conference are we attending?"<br>Like I said, we are so<br>grateful that we've got the<br>community support and the whānau<br>support that surrounded us.<br>Like we, we've just had our kids going<br>to the grandparents' house for<br>the school holidays weekend<br>and it's, and it's those<br>sorts of things that I know<br>lots of people don't have the luxury of.<br>So yeah, we, we're just, one<br>of the, the grateful ones,<br>the blessed ones that<br>have that support network.<br>Just wish society was<br>more open to difference.<br>I think if we were just happy<br>to accommodate differences<br>and listen to people<br>and learn about people.<br>While diagnosis is<br>important, it wouldn't be<br>as big a deal, if that<br>makes sense.<br>Yeah, yeah.<br>Although the nice thing about that is<br>that it can start at home.<br>Yeah.<br>So, you know, even if<br>you're in a difficult spot<br>where you've got schools<br>around you that don't get it<br>and you've got all sorts<br>of other areas where that,<br>that kid might get<br>excluded and that's tough.<br>You know, having the family, loving,<br>and supporting, and<br>doing the right things.<br>I mean like when I was a kid<br>I had a million autistic traits,<br>I'm realising now, but my sister,<br>she was borderline personality disorder.<br>So no one was looking at me.<br>Everyone was looking at her and,<br>and I just wonder how different, you know,<br>sometimes I do wonder what<br>would life have been like<br>had they known, would they have?<br>Yeah, would life have just been totally<br>different in childhood for me?<br>So it's great when I look at my kids<br>and I see how much we love them<br>and everything we're doing for them.<br>And even though they've got<br>all these challenges coming<br>and we worry about that,<br>you know, you just remind yourself,<br>gosh, they're, they're<br>getting a great life in<br>so many ways just by<br>having a, a really loving,<br>focused family with their<br>heart in the right place.<br>I just, I kind of laugh<br>about getting my diagnosis.<br>because growing up my<br>mum would always say,<br>"Oh your brother doesn't have to do<br>as well 'cause he is dyspraxic."<br>And then I get,<br>Wow.<br>I get diagnosed at 21 with autism,<br>pathological demand avoidance,<br>sensory processing sensitivity,<br>ADHD, like depression, anxiety.<br>I'm like, see.<br>[Laughs]<br>And you did really well in school.<br>You knew as well.<br>Yeah. Yeah, I was very academic. Yeah.<br>Once you get diagnosed,<br>look for every support group<br>that you can, give them your time<br>and your absolute, kind<br>of, love and respect,<br>because they're looking out<br>for you as as much as you,<br>you are trying to do it for your child.<br>So, yeah, obviously this is<br>good time to thank you Hannah<br>and what you've provided<br>for my family and our girl<br>and yeah, just that<br>mutual respect thing of these<br>are the support networks.<br>Sometimes you are, you're<br>a bit angry with them<br>because you've been on the waiting list.<br>But once you get in there,<br>show, show that respect, show<br>that love 'cause because it's reciprocated<br>and diagnosis is not the be all, end all<br>and it's just the platform<br>that you work off.<br>Yeah.<br>My final thoughts, but thanks so much.<br>I would like people to know<br>that diagnosis is important<br>also just because, I mean the<br>mental health treatment isn't<br>like, designed for autistic people.<br>So my men, the treatment<br>that I was getting<br>in mental health is making me worse.<br>So I think from that front,<br>having the diagnosis is really important.<br>And I think I encourage parents to try<br>and connect with autistic adults<br>and listen, even if it's<br>really hard to hear.<br>'cause some of it will be<br>hard to hear and that's okay.<br>Oh, I think early on, unfortunately,<br>like, the world's not in a place<br>we want it to be right now.<br>So you do have to get ready to advocate<br>and that means don't you get<br>told there's a waiting list,<br>go see what else you can do in<br>the meantime.<br>There are loads of things,<br>when Plunket didn't believe me,<br>I rang Autism New Zealand,<br>didn't have a diagnosis,<br>had Plunket telling me no.<br>And they sent someone to my house.<br>Yeah, amazing.<br>To come and talk to me about it,<br>got me into a spectrum playgroup,<br>gave me heaps<br>of information to validate<br>where I was coming from and<br>that's really important.<br>And it doesn't happen unless<br>I make that phone call though.<br>Yeah. So you've gotta make the phone call.<br>You've got to see what you can do. Yeah.<br>Don't wait for it to come.<br>Yeah. A diagnosis can be<br>a really positive thing.<br>Support everyone's understanding.<br>And I also think something<br>that I just didn't get<br>to touch on is being a<br>professional, working in this space,<br>I'm increasingly seeing all professionals<br>want to do the right thing.<br>You know, and the problem<br>with the waiting list<br>is a funding problem,<br>you know, we just really need<br>more resources in this area<br>so children can be identified early,<br>diagnosed in a timely fashion,<br>and be supported to access<br>appropriate supports.<br>That would be a system that could work<br>and just isn't working<br>so well at the moment.<br>I don't, I don't think we<br>as a country realise the consequences<br>of not prioritising this<br>because autistic people<br>very commonly struggle<br>with their mental health.<br>And because of, like, people<br>not understanding autism,<br>they struggle to get work,<br>which means they struggle<br>to fund housing and you<br>know, it's like a whole big<br>whole life issue that<br>actually ends up being quite<br>a big cost to the country.<br>Because if we can't work,<br>we're on the benefit.<br>If we can't find housing,<br>we're on the housing register,<br>you know, we need mental health services.<br>We are taking up a lot of resources<br>by not having the appropriate support.<br>Yeah.<br>We know right now that<br>all the children out there<br>who need ORS for example,<br>are not getting it.<br>We know that.<br>Everybody knows<br>that because it's limited<br>and yet we know that so many<br>of these people can thrive if they've got,<br>but they're given their<br>wheelchair, they can do it.<br>Yeah. So we've got to address that. <br>Ngā mihi nui kia koutou. Thank you so much all for your time.<br>I've really enjoyed this conversation.</p></main><footer style="margin-top: 2rem; background: #0001; padding: 2rem; text-align: center;"><p>We Are The University</p><ul style="list-style-type: none; padding: 0; margin: 0;"><li><a href="/">Home</a></li><li><a href="/about">About</a></li><li><a href="/contact">Contact</a></li></ul></footer></body></html>
