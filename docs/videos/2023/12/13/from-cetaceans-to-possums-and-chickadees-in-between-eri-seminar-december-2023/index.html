here<br>today to give you a few examples as Josh<br>kindly said in his introduction um of<br>some work using genomics to look at uh<br>what's gone on in the the lives and the<br> POA of a few different species so<br>I'm always interested in these talks<br>about why people got where they're going<br>so um as I mentioned in my little Mi I<br>grew up in Oakland uh spent a lot of<br>time my time at this beautiful little<br>beach here called wak and I was one of<br>those kids who was just spent a lot of<br>time just fossicking around in rock<br>pools loved Rock pools loved all the<br>little CR Critters that were in there<br>really wanted to see what they were<br>doing with their lives also spent a bit<br>of time out fishing with my dad um and<br>uh here's me with Captain big Ted as<br>well so I knew from a pretty young age I<br>liked the marine environment and I was<br>pretty Keen to study it so I turned up<br>to the University of Oakland where I did<br>my um my bachelor and my honors degree<br>and I got taken under the wing of some<br>of the scientists there who study<br>citations so particularly Professor<br>relle Constantine and Scott Baker who<br>was at that time at ockland I got the<br>opportunity to go out to see marwe<br>dolphins which are our little our<br>version of cinkus hctor we have off the<br>coast just here and that was really<br>exciting got to um spent my time just<br>spotting to see where they were keeping<br>keeping the boat where it needed to be<br>because we were quite close in and I was<br>like okay I could do this I could be<br>some kind of Ja custo like person who's<br>out with the dolphins this is going to<br>be rad the next project I did was up in<br>pangi in the Bay of islands on<br>bottlenose dolphins and there I was a<br>little bit more Hands-On so I did some<br>of the photo ID so Dolphins often get<br>little Nicks in their Dorsal fins which<br>we can use to identify them kind of like<br>fingerprints and um to do that though<br>you have to zoom in on the dorsal fin of<br>the dolphin which is doing a completely<br>different direction to how the boat is<br>rocking you have to Stow the gear below<br>deck while the boat's also rocking you<br>have to write down your detailed not<br>those of you who do feel work know all<br>about this while the boat's rocking and<br>it turned out that I get seasick so that<br>was the end of that dream sadly um but<br>at the same time we been learning a lot<br>about genetics and the power it gave us<br>to learn both about the lives of<br>specific individuals and also all of<br>their ancestors at the same time so this<br>is the story about how I became a<br>geneticist so I've been really lucky to<br>work on a whole bunch of different<br>Critters during my career so far um and<br>they might look pretty desparate but the<br>thing that tends to unite my research is<br>that I'm interested in looking at<br>patterns of genetic diversity across the<br>genome and using it as a bit of a time<br>machine to try and look at what what<br>forces have impacted on those<br>populations through time so selection<br>and how the populations themselves have<br>changed in<br>number so we can do this with genetics<br>because our individual that we're<br>interested in is actually inherited bits<br>of their genome from their tupuna<br>ranging back in time and they are sort<br>of a snapshot of those pressures that<br>have acted throughout time uh in that<br>population so this can include things<br>like climate change anthropogenic<br>impacts like<br>Fisheries the exposure to different<br>diseases as well as just the integral<br>part of being an part of the holistic<br>ecosystem and most of the examples I'm<br>talking about today will have in some<br>way um a bit of a climate change angle<br>on them so what I'm going to step<br>through is just a few examples of how I<br>use these techniques in my own<br>research so I'm going to start off with<br>cations which is my kind of my bread and<br>butter in my main main research area and<br>uh this is part of rather for Discovery<br>Fellowship project that I'm I'm running<br>um creating Puro past present and future<br>conservation impacts using genomics and<br>I'll come back to the Puro aspect at the<br>end of it so for the past and the<br>present impacts we're focusing on these<br>guys the hectors and marui dolphins um<br>these subspecies of the genus cph cenus<br>hior um they are New Zealand's only<br>endemic citations so we've got about 45<br>whales or dolphins that call our coasts<br>home but these guys are only found<br>around here they've got these<br>distinctive Mickey Mouse spins they're<br>hard to mistake for anything else when<br>you see them out in the water and<br>they're often seen in quite close and<br>Shore so if any of you guys are are<br>surfing out at regand you've got a<br>reasonably good chance of seeing them<br>when you're out there surfing they're<br>adorable in Wei so they're smaller than<br>I am which is pretty small for a dolphin<br>um but unfortunately they're also um<br>very threatened so the hectus Dolphins<br>which are found around TI pamu there are<br>about 15,000 of those animals but the M<br>dolphin that we've got off the coast<br>here we're down to around 48 IND<br>indviduals over the age of one so one of<br>the reasons that they're the focus of<br>this part of the project for us is<br>because of how threaten they are there's<br>a lot of attention put on them every<br>time an animal comes in it's generally<br>send sent for necropsy so we can figure<br>out what what killed the animal and why<br>so we know they've got this to the sort<br>of threatened stage through the past<br>impacts of Fisheries so monofilament<br>Nets are not good for these guys whether<br>in the form of gilets or<br>trolling because of the the attention<br>that's been placed on the impact of<br>Fisheries there've been a number of<br>Fisheries exclusion areas put in place<br>and that's really helped so by catch is<br>no longer the principal effect um impact<br>on these guys in a lot of the areas<br>around New Zealand but by sort of<br>removing the Fisheries impacts it's<br>allowed another threat to really raise<br>its head and that's one of infectious<br>diseases so it's likely when Fisheries<br>was really heavily impacting on these<br>guys we couldn't really see how how much<br>diseases were impacting on them so this<br>first example here I'll come back to in<br>a few slides time but um this animal was<br>ultimately um impacted by Bruce osis and<br>this for of brel it got was from FAL so<br>we've got these interactions with the<br>other marine mammals that are also in<br>the environment as well perhaps the most<br>contentious disease threat that's facing<br>these guys though is<br>toxoplasmosis so what we think's<br>happening in terms of this disease is<br>that we've got cats that are pooping<br>their beautiful hour such as the W cutle<br>this the Toxoplasma cysts are washing<br>down stream and these dolphins are<br>feeding in often quite turbid Muddy<br>Waters so it's likely that they're<br>potentially either ingesting the cysts<br>accidentally as feeding or potentially<br>there's some bio accumulation up the<br>food chain and what ultimately happens<br>is that these dolphins are not the<br>definitive host for Toxoplasma and it<br>causes some really severe um Health<br>impacts through toxoplasmosis similar do<br>we get as humans if we've got<br>compromised immune systems either<br>because we're pregnant or we've got<br>HIV so because of these reasons what<br>we're ultimately hoping to do with this<br>um with this uh project is to look at<br>whether holog genomics shows utility for<br>conservation so the idea of holog<br>genomics is we've got the Genome of the<br>animal and we've also got all the<br>microbes who are on board and we're<br>trying to analyze them in tandem to see<br>if they give us richer insights than we<br>might have by analyzing each of these<br>data streams separately and I have to<br>give a big me here to my PhD student<br>Sebastian who's actually the one who's<br>doing all the hard work right I'm just<br>up here talking about it um as many of<br>you guys who work in the genomics field<br>know it's often you need a cast of<br>thousands so there are a lot of other<br>folks who've also contributed their time<br>and expertise to this project so<br>far so they make a great test case<br>because despite this really intense<br>research and and management focus on<br>them we've got a lot of unknown<br>questions when it comes to hius Maui<br>Dolphins one of the big ones is genetic<br>interchange between these subspecies<br>every now and then we actually find<br>hectors swimming around with Maru<br>Dolphins even in the same social groups<br>but as of yet they haven't actually<br>successfully into breed so we've got<br>some questions about how profoundly<br>different they might be we know that<br>populations have been impacted by<br>Fisheries but we don't have a good<br>Baseline for how many dolphins there<br>were before Fisheries started impacting<br>on them we know the mawei dolphin in<br>particular is down at this really small<br>population size so it's likely that<br>there might be inbreeding risks but we<br>we don't really know how many there<br>might be and we don't have a good idea<br>about which Dolphins might be more more<br>susceptible or resistance to disease<br>such as<br>toxoplasmosis but the first thing we had<br>to do as we needed to go talk to people<br>and that's because these guys are a Tong<br>as as an URI or Tong um so from a<br>western science perspective when we when<br>we do this kind of research it looks<br>like things are changing form we're<br>going from a dolphin we getting a a<br>skinin and blubber sample we're<br>extracting the DNA into solution and<br>then we're ultimately um turning that<br>into digital sequence data but because<br>the dolphin itself is treasured that<br>means that we also have to be exercising<br>that level of care when we're looking at<br>each of these sort of derived um aspects<br>from the the dolphin so for this reason<br>the first thing we needed to do is to<br>chat to people and make sure that the<br>aims of the study were were consistent<br>with what folks were interested in um<br>out in the community so I carried out<br>what I'm going to consider BL broad but<br>shallow consultation um and what I found<br>is that folks were generally quite<br>supportive of this this project because<br>it was giving information that was going<br>to help with um looking after these<br>animals into the future so they were<br>around um around for the<br>Muno so one of the reasons that it was<br>pretty broad but shallow not what I<br>would necessarily consider best practice<br>consultation is that these guys are<br>found everywhere so I had about 40 E or<br>Hao that I was chatting to I'm up to<br>around 400 400 or so emails and phone<br>calls from everyone so sending daily<br>updates to let them know where we're at<br>with the research but I've only had<br>about 10 Carnel hi Carnel hii with folks<br>so far which is really where I think the<br>gold standard is for talking about<br>research on these on these amazing<br>little animals so some of the issues<br>that came up so tissues to stay on Shore<br>right so doing all the lab work um and<br>Library prep within New Zealand and the<br>reason for this is that if they go<br>overseas there's always the risk that<br>they might end up in museums over there<br>and um and not brought back home one of<br>the interesting ones was uh a definite<br>call for no patenting of information so<br>for conservation<br>examples like dolphins probably less of<br>a big thing um but you can imagine if<br>you doing Marine Bio bioactives from<br>from some of the invertebrates or things<br>like that uh there could be a risk that<br>some of that the the benefits that that<br>acre from that sort of research don't<br>flow back to the people who are actually<br>caring for the environment and then one<br>of the final ones is that we're looking<br>to store the genomes on the Alo gen<br>genomic data repository so that's a<br>repository posted within New Zealand and<br>it means that e and Hau can continue to<br>have a say in what that data is used for<br>and downstream<br>research so what are we actually trying<br>to do with these Dolphins we're doing<br>something called whole genome shun<br>population level sequencing which is a<br>bit of a math so wgs we've got samples<br>scattered all around T Mai and tonu<br>including some of those Hector dolphins<br>that are swimming up around the ma<br>dolphin range so whole shotgun<br>sequencing you can think of that kind of<br>like having to assemble a bunch of jigsa<br>puzzles so you can do a spot the<br>difference between these jigsa puzzles<br>but in this case our jigsaw puzzle has<br>2.3 billion pieces AG so it's um<br>difficult one way we can make it a<br>little bit easier is using a reference<br>genome so we've got a reference genome<br>from an animal um from the port W Cato<br>area as well as an animal from too or<br>Coupe from Cloudy Bay and these<br>reference genomes are kind of like<br>having the jigsaw puzzle box lid to<br>allow us to see where those pieces need<br>to be assembled so that we can do the<br>comparison between um between the<br>individuals so Al Mar dolphin animal is<br>the animal that I mentioned earlier that<br>died ultimately due to brucelosis<br>this was actually really sad because she<br>was an animal that had been recorded<br>having multiple carves into this<br>population and losing a successful mom<br>from a population that's so critically<br>endangered was just quite gut raching<br>for the folks who were involved so in<br>her case she had somehow contracted<br>brella and had caused her fetus to abort<br>and for some reason she'd been unable to<br>give birth to the fetus and had<br>ultimately succumbed to blood poisoning<br>herself so it's pretty sad but I think<br>the Silver Lining is that she's still<br>going to be able to contribute to the<br>conservation of of her subspecies<br>through acting as the reference genome<br>so we had her samples from the New<br>Zealand satation tissue archive which is<br>a really cool collaboration between ewi<br>hapu Department of Conservation to Papa<br>in the University of Oakland so every<br>time a citation strands in New Zealand<br>if e and Hau are okay with it a sample<br>was taken with the intention to do<br>Downstream genetics on their animal to<br>figure out more about that<br>sample our Hector's dolphin sample came<br>from an animal that as far as we know<br>could still be swimming around um so it<br>was a using a biopsy gun which sounds a<br>little horrible but it's a Veterinary<br>rifle that takes a small um small bit of<br>tissue out of a free swimming animal I<br>think you can tell that it's not too<br>horrible for this animal because it was<br>sampled three times in 2011 and twice in<br>2012 so you would think that if it was<br>that horrible it would start spending<br>time further away from the boats so one<br>of the reasons that we focused on this<br>animal is that it had a lot of tissue<br>available from these biopsies so we<br>weren't depleting this really treasured<br>resource so the main point of doing<br>these reference genomes is to act as<br>that kind of jigle puzzle box image but<br>we can also learn some things from about<br>these populations just using these two<br>samples as well so one of the things we<br>can do is a peerwise sequentially mobian<br>coalescent plot which sounds like a<br>nightmare so I'm just going to call it<br>psmc it's a little complex we're going<br>to stick through nice and slow so no one<br>gets up and walks out um on our graph<br>that we're going to be showing here<br>we've got something called a fected<br>population size on the Y AIS so this is<br>going to reflect either having tons lots<br>and lots of dolphins or lots and lots of<br>different populations of dolphins so if<br>we're high up on the graph we've got<br>heaps of dolphins heaps of population<br>structure or heaps of population<br>structure or both we've got low numbers<br>on the graph we've got either fewer<br>dolphins or fewer populations so perhaps<br>stuck into one<br>population on our xais we have time and<br>because genst are horrible people it's<br>flipped around completely the opposite<br>way to what a normal human would think<br>of time as so we've got towards the<br>present on the left there and towards<br>the past on the right okay let's start<br>having a look at some data so around a<br>million years ago we've got got our<br>hectus dolphin our blue and our ma<br>dolphin in the red and I will talk about<br>the pseudo in a little bit later on so<br>we see this massive decline in either<br>population structure or in the number of<br>dolphins and we think what was going on<br>here is this was actually the formation<br>of the species so the greater genus of<br>seenus is scattered around the southern<br>hemisphere these these they're all these<br>adorable little cute Dolphins my<br>favorite is probably the Common's<br>dolphin because it looks like a little<br>Panda and and we think what was<br>happening here at this this this big<br>decrease we're seeing is that's actually<br>signaling the time<br>where we've gone from having multiple<br>species to coalescing down into one<br>little lineage that's present around New<br>Zealand the continue trotting along with<br>quite low numbers so there's about 20 to<br>30,000 effective Dolphins here an<br>effective dolphin is a dolphin who has<br>had the chance to contribute genetic<br>material to the Next Generation so um<br>it's likely the se's population sizes<br>could have been even higher than this we<br>can see these periods of glaciation<br>shown by Blue here so the sea level is<br>going up and down and that's shown by<br>the relative sea level graph here<br>showing what sea level looks like<br>compared to the<br>presents we then get to the Eman warm<br>period SoCal because TI has got up to<br>just a little bit warmer then today and<br>you can see that the hector dolphin line<br>shoots straight up what we thinks<br>happened here is that warm period<br>allowed the Dolphins to distribute out<br>to other places around the country and<br>then the you can see that the sea levels<br>started dropping again which means that<br>things are cooling down so those<br>Dolphins got out to new places and then<br>kind of got stuck there without much<br>interchange that was going on between<br>them you can also see that little black<br>line the pseudo line creeping up that<br>line is giving us a measure about gene<br>flow shutting down between hectors and<br>Mar Dolphins so being having them<br>separated out into separate<br>subspecies that keeps on happening<br>through the last glacial maximum when<br>the sea levels got really really low so<br>we're seeing a complete shutdown in gene<br>flow between hectors and Mai dolphins<br>and you might be asking well why would<br>that be happening if we look at what New<br>Zealand looked like back in the last<br>glacial maximum it looked a heck of a<br>lot different now so timana orawa the<br>cook straight was not in fact a straight<br>it was more like a giant big land plug<br>that meant the Dolphins couldn't get<br>through to each other so we're seeing<br>this this sort of this impact of these<br>really large geological um differences<br>so this sort of shows you some of the<br>limitations with just having our two<br>samples right things might have looked a<br>little bit different if we had a West<br>Coast sample that we were comparing to<br>the Maui dolphin because presumably<br>things were a little bit more connected<br>along that Coastline there you can also<br>see that our time scale cuts of 10,000<br>years ago which isn't super useful for<br>looking at anthropogenic impacts and the<br>reason for this is that we're a little<br>Limited in the number of mutations that<br>we can incorporate the information we<br>can use when we've only got two genomes<br>and finally perhaps one of the more<br>annoying things with these pots is that<br>we've got the sort of conflation between<br>the number of dolphins and the amount of<br>population structure so when we're able<br>to add in that the extra data those<br>additional animals for the whole genome<br>sequencing it allows to use some of the<br>techniques it allows to tease apart some<br>of these these different sort of<br>conflated measures and it will also<br>allow us to get a little bit more um<br>accuracy going into recent<br>time one of the other things Sebastian's<br>been able to do however is to look at<br>the levels of genetic diversity across<br>these genomes so this plot here the<br>larger the bar is the more genetic<br>diversity you have in a given species<br>and we've got a bunch of whales and<br>dolphins here so we've got animals that<br>have an LC next to them a least concern<br>these are animals that are doing or<br>species that are doing pretty well lots<br>of lots of uh individuals we've got<br>animals that are vulnerable the V code<br>so these are animals that might have<br>been impacted by things like wailing in<br>the past but are starting to recover or<br>animals that are maybe a bit more at<br>risk depending on what their population<br>uh their habitat preferences are we have<br>e in for endangered so these an are<br>animals that were either profoundly<br>impacted by whaling in the past or in<br>areas now where um they're at risk from<br>from other anthropogenic impacts and<br>then we've got our critically endangered<br>animals with the CR these are animals<br>where in some cases such as the B um we<br>consider them actually functionally<br>extinct nowadays and the V is down just<br>to a handful of individuals as well so<br>what you can see is that the Maui<br>dolphin and the hectus dolphin don't<br>look too terrible in terms of genetic<br>diversity they're kind of sitting in the<br>middle of the pack however the mai<br>dolphin has about 40% less genetic<br>diversity than the Hector's dolphin we<br>might expect some of that just based on<br>where they're found so the mai dolphin<br>has a smaller range than the hectus<br>dolphin and generally if we we're we're<br>not in we don't have as big of<br>population size we're not found as<br>widely distributed we might have less<br>genetic diversity however the thing we<br>worry about is that this might have been<br>exacerbated by these impacts such as<br>fishing removing a lot of individuals<br>and we worry about populations when they<br>get really low in genetic diversity<br>because it might increase their<br>susceptibility to things like<br>disease one of the other um big risks<br>that Ma and Hector Dolphins face is<br>climate change so all of the cute little<br>cousins of Hector dolphin Hector and<br>Maui dolphins are found distributed in<br>cool temperate Waters and what we worry<br>about is as things start warming up is<br>that we're going to see prey shifts<br>we're going to see pth pen shifts we're<br>particularly um concerned about Aven<br>influenza potentially making the jump<br>into into these guys we'll see Predator<br>shifts and these guys are absolutely<br>snack siiz for our mangle for our sharks<br>that we have around the water we're<br>going to see increased human<br>interactions you guys might get out for<br>a swim at Regan I'd hardly ever get in<br>the water in Denon because it's too cold<br>as it warms up I might change my mind so<br>we're going to be around these Dolphins<br>more and we're also going to see the<br>impact of extreme weather events so I<br>think one of the um outcomes we could<br>see from Cyclone Gabriel was how much<br>impacted that<br>environment through<br>siltation it's not going to be just a<br>pro a problem for these guys though so<br>for this section of the research we're<br>actually going to extend it out to all<br>of the whales and dolphins that we have<br>samples for in the New Zealand station<br>tissue archive so we've got samples from<br>animals that really like like it hot so<br>the animals shown in red here are<br>animals that don't like any of that blue<br>area shown on the globe here they<br>they're warm water Specialists we also<br>have a lot of species that like it cool<br>so they're ones that don't like the red<br>shown on that Globe they're found in the<br>sort of yellow blue areas and then we've<br>got our generalists who don't really<br>mind the water they're just there<br>swimming so to show you guys what we're<br>hoping to achieve for the next um next<br>part of this project I'm just going to<br>pick on three examples so our hectori<br>dolphin who you guys know well by now<br>our um Sperma par who's a generalist<br>found in all areas of the globe and then<br>the risos dolphin who some of you guys<br>might be familiar from about the stories<br>of polis Jack who used to lead the<br>fairies into the mar<br>sounds so what we're hoping to do is try<br>and figure out how CL it's likely to<br>influence these guys going forward in<br>time so we've got some fairly um fairly<br>good ideas about how climate has changed<br>in the past based on all the the<br>hardcore work of the the phys physical<br>geograph geologists and what we're<br>hoping to do is to tie that then to our<br>estimates of effective population size<br>and how it's changed through time so you<br>might notice there that I've I've<br>suggested that the the cold temperatures<br>as we can see in the top Trace there<br>with the gray is particularly associated<br>with low effective population size for<br>cold species and you might be thinking<br>think that's a bit weird L if the<br>temperature is colder surely those cold<br>water species should really enjoy what's<br>going on but the problem is that a lot<br>of that cold water back in those really<br>cold times was covered by ice so we've<br>got to have a little bit more nuanced<br>idea about what this actually means for<br>animals who are swimming around so what<br>we're ultimately hoping to do is to use<br>projections of climate change going into<br>the future and tie this to our<br>understanding of the relationships in<br>the past to get an idea about how it's<br>going to impact on the effective<br>population size of these animals and<br>that's by prox see an assessment of how<br>well they'll be able to adapt to Future<br>um future<br>challenges okay I'm going to attempt my<br>most clumsy transition of this whole<br>talk which is I chose sperm Wales as an<br>example because they're super cool uh<br>and because I actually did my PhD up on<br>them when I was up at Oregon State I'm<br>not talking about them today because it<br>would make it like a three-hour talk<br>because they're just so wonderful um but<br>after I finished my PhD I ended up going<br>over to the University of Kansas which<br>is not an area you go to study Wales and<br>dolphins it's in the midddle of the of<br>the whole country<br>but what they do have is they do have<br>these really amazing animals called<br>chickes and chickes are an adorable<br>little BB they name for their um their<br>calls which go something like this Chi<br>so everyone in the species group has<br>that sort of characteristic call and I<br>was particularly focusing on these two<br>um species here the black cat chick and<br>the Carolina chick so the black cat<br>chick is found in the northern us and<br>the Carolina is found in Northern North<br>America I should say before I get<br>canceled by the Canadians um and the<br>Carolina chck is found in the in the<br>Southeast us so they have this really<br>extensive uh hybrid Zone that runs all<br>the way from New York in the East all<br>the way out to Kansas in the west it's<br>been characterized by a few different<br>data types including morphology um but<br>even the ornithologists have a lot of<br>difficult difficulty telling these guys<br>apart they're very similar looking birds<br>songs also been used um so they've got<br>differences in the number of notes that<br>they have in their calls but<br>unfortunately they're really crafty and<br>they're really good at learning each<br>other's songs as well I think of them a<br>lot like the TU and the CK<br>sometimes it's easy to tell which bird<br>you're listening to but when they start<br>mimicking each other it can be quite<br>difficult um what's known based on<br>observations from from backyard<br>naturalists and some of the genetics<br>work is that in Ohio and Pennsylvania<br>the hybrid Zone's been marching North at<br>quite a rapid rate so about 100<br>kilometers over the last 100 years<br>there's been some work that's been done<br>in the Illinois region on song which<br>hasn't shown much of a movement but<br>again with them been crafty with so with<br>how they can learn each other's song<br>that's a a bit difficult to to establish<br>whether it me truly means no movement or<br>just that the song data is not um useful<br>for looking at the movement of the<br>hybrid Zone and there's been no<br>comparisons done on the Western Range to<br>see what might be happening there so<br>this work came about because um Mark<br>Robbins who's listed on these papers<br>here really intensely surveyed this<br>these hybrid Zone this hybrid Zone back<br>in the 1970s using some of the really<br>cool old school um genetic techniques<br>and he came to me and he said okay I've<br>got these samples in the freezer if I go<br>back out again now and get more samples<br>can use your fancy genetic stuff to tell<br>me what's happening with this hybrid<br>zone so he did exactly that he went back<br>out into um into Missouri and tried to<br>sample quite densely the areas that he<br>previously sampled back in the late<br>1970s so these dots here red means only<br>black cat birds were found blue means<br>only Carolina Birds was were found and<br>then the purple is a mix of either<br>different the different species or<br>hybrids to show it a little bit more<br>easily we carried out something called a<br>spatial<br>interpolation so this means if you drop<br>a point anywhere on that square we<br>should be able to tell you if you were<br>to go out and Sample a chick from there<br>whether it was more likely to be<br>Carolina or more likely to be black cap<br>so we've got Carolina and the blue and<br>the lower right and then black cap and<br>the upper left up there and that that<br>zone where it switches over from Blue to<br>Red is where we think the middle of the<br>hybrid zone is we can also do this using<br>sort of a a nice little Line in the Sand<br>so this is uh again individual birds<br>that are plotted here and that dotted<br>line is the line where we think that you<br>switch over from on average being a<br>Carolina bird to being a black cat bird<br>so that's for the historical Sample When<br>We compare that to the modern one we can<br>see that there's just this pervasive<br>plug of Carolina chickes that moved into<br>the hybrid Zone and we can see that it<br>actually physically moved around six6<br>kilometers we was pretty cool to find<br>some significant movement um but when we<br>compared it to the other areas of the<br>hybrid Zone we actually found that the<br>hybrid Zone had moved much lower in<br>Missouri than it had in Pennsylvania<br>we were curious about why this might be<br>so we looked at some of the climatic<br>variables and we found that Pennsylvania<br>had warmed up to 50% more than Missouri<br>so it seems like how fast this hybrid<br>zone is moving really ties into how how<br>much warming these areas have<br>experienced this was a pretty important<br>lesson for us because these are these<br>are a really big widely distribut group<br>of birds and it seems like the impacts<br>of climate are going to be actually<br>quite localized which is actually a<br>really important lesson for us to be<br>thinking about when we're doing the<br>similar analyses on our<br>cations so although the hybrid Zone has<br>moved it hasn't widened so we're not<br>seeing a collapse of these species into<br>one big sort of um meta species or<br>hybrid Zone and part of the reason for<br>that is the hybrids have it really tough<br>they've got poorer spatial um um spatial<br>memory and poor problem solving ability<br>this is a big deal for these birds they<br>they spend these these har harsh harsh<br>Winters where they're having to cash<br>food around in order to make it through<br>the win winter and if your memory is<br>impaired it can make it really difficult<br>to locate that food and that obviously<br>means that the hybrids don't do quite so<br>well so we were able to do some more<br>complex genetically ner stuff that I'm<br>not going to even try and put up on here<br>but it uh helped us identify specific<br>genes that might be involved in<br>reproduction and survival so um I my<br>Visa was up from the US and I was moving<br>back down to New Zealand so I started<br>off my citation research but I kept on<br>thinking ah this hybrid stuff could be<br>really cool for conservation if we can<br>just think of something that we might be<br>able to apply it to and eventually we<br>realized that possums would be actually<br>a really cool system and that's because<br>our possums in New Zealand come from two<br>distinct locations in Australia so we've<br>got possums that have come from the<br>Victoria New South Wales region um and<br>they originally would have been sort of<br>the grayfer possums you might have seen<br>around meanwhile the Tasmanian pums tend<br>to be characterized by nice dark<br>fur this correlates with the really<br>different climatic variables that these<br>possums have experienced so possums in<br>Tasmania um deal with a lot of lot<br>colder temperatures and a lot more<br>rainfall they tend to be larger bodied<br>whereas the possums the gr grayfer<br>possums from the mainland area are much<br>more drought tolerant so it's kind of a<br>reversal of the previous uh examples<br>where we've been um using genetics to<br>unveil the the the impacts of climate<br>this one is they're coming from areas<br>that experience different climate and<br>now we're using that to try and tease<br>genetics so our ultimate question is can<br>we leverage these hybrid zones to<br>identify important genes and now I am<br>going to put up a scary plot but I we<br>walk through I promise so on this plot<br>here on the x axis the horizontal one<br>we've got pums that are more looking<br>more like they Tasmanian through the<br>possoms that look like they're more<br>Mainland and then on the y- axis we've<br>got the same thing for each gene so each<br>of those lines is a specific Gene so for<br>example that blue um blob that we can<br>see there we can see that it has the<br>gray version of the of the that specific<br>Gene all the way through to being super<br>Tasmanian before it suddenly suddenly<br>drops so what we would infer this being<br>is that that Gene is pushing in from the<br>gray the gray population into the black<br>population and that might be something<br>that infers a lot of benefits such as<br>say resistance to 1080 and some of the<br>other pest control methods we use we<br>also have these red Deans here which are<br>really tied to how um to the overall<br>genomic background so you don't see um<br>the gray version of that Gene present in<br>animals that look more Tasmanian and<br>those are the ones that we think are<br>getting stuck in the middle of the<br>hybrid Zone so things that are really<br>strongly involved in reproduction and<br>survival so our first question after we<br>got this gr was oh and I should<br>acknowledged donor and Oscar who are the<br>ones who are actually doing all the work<br>on this why I Swan around to give talks<br>um so our first our first challenge is<br>can we confirm that we do actually have<br>hybrid populations in New Zealand<br>otherwise it was going to be a very<br>interesting response to the funders on<br>this grant um and so we were able to do<br>this as part of the the posum genome<br>paper that came out so Sandy who's the<br>little red pouch was the was the<br>individual who was sequenced for this<br>reference genome with donor and Oscar<br>being some of the lead authors on it so<br>we had three reference locations from<br>Australia so uh New South Wales shown in<br>light green Tasmania and dark green and<br>then Kangaroo Island shown in Gray and<br>the first one we looked at was<br>mitochondrial DNA which is maternally<br>transmitted so everyone here today has<br>the same mitochondrial DNA as their<br>biological month so this is a little<br>Transit of otago here we've got denan on<br>the right through to going through to<br>central otago on the left and Sandy our<br>individual our reference genome has this<br>light green hype that's pretty<br>characteristic of New South Wales we<br>were then able to look at some nuclear<br>markers based on RNA s and here's Sandy<br>again shown by the star so Sand's got a<br>fair little whack of Tasmanian dark<br>green in there but very little of that<br>New South Wales um that we'd seen in his<br>mitochondrial DNA and there's a big<br>chunk of that blue which is so far<br>unsampled so we we haven't done a good<br>job necessarily of s all the diversity<br>that's in Australia to compare it to so<br>what this tells us is that we do have<br>different patterns between mitochondrial<br>and nuclear DNA which is evidence of<br>hybridization and great for the grant<br>continuing<br>on okay so a question you might have is<br>identify genes or identify lows of<br>interest for what<br>purpose and I think we need to be pretty<br>honest that one of the the implications<br>of This research is potentially for<br>genetically mediated piss control so the<br>idea behind these sorts of uh piss<br>controls is that they can Target things<br>like fertility so if we were to Brick<br>the mitochondria um Loosely brick the<br>mitochondria we might be able to impact<br>the ability for sperm to swim while<br>still having an animal that's largely<br>healthy so it's the idea is it's being a<br>little bit more Humane than some of the<br>the current methods that we're using and<br>the way that this would tend to work<br>particularly for some of the the um the<br>applications is using crisper which you<br>guys might have heard about it's a fancy<br>pair of molecular scissors that can<br>either chop up genes or it can uh be<br>used to replace specific bits of the<br>gene with uh new sequence that gives a<br>trait that we desire so imagine our<br>trait was um green mice for whatever<br>reason what a gene drive would allow you<br>to do is to actually um have every<br>offspring of appearing of a normal Mouse<br>with a green Mouse be green so it<br>spreads the trait spreads through the<br>population very quickly compared to a<br>normal population on the left here so if<br>this was something that imped<br>reproductive success you could<br>eventually end up suppressing that<br>population with that trait so I love<br>this quote from Jurassic Park which is<br>your scientists were so preoccupied with<br>the whether or not they could they<br>didn't stop to think if they should and<br>we do a lot of could in in science land<br>and so one of the barriers to trying to<br>get people um get this information out<br>to people so they can tell us about<br>whether we should or not is that um<br>genetics is difficult to understand so<br>you don't have to be smart to Do<br>genetics in fact you can be a literal<br>Muppet but you do have to learn a lot of<br>jargon and that jargon is really<br>difficult dense multi- syllable words<br>that's difficult for people to come to<br>grips with and what this means is that<br>people who have values and place-based<br>knowledge from their local areas aren't<br>necessarily getting to engage in the<br>conversations that we're having about<br>some of these genetic tools that we're<br>applying so um the sort of plank that<br>I'm trying to have underpin a lot of my<br>research I do is translating the nerd<br>speak so the idea with this is that<br>we're going to help people to make their<br>own decisions on the should by knowing<br>the could a little bit more strongly<br>that's particularly important for Mar<br>communities for things like genetic piss<br>control where we're talking about<br>modifying fuler POA there there are some<br>strong Tik hanger and other Associated<br>values that come into play not least<br>which what if we do this Gene drive and<br>it escapes over to Australia and we<br>impact on their Tonga over there where<br>possum should be so there's a lot of<br>really really important ethical<br>questions about these these types of<br>Technologies so despite these concerns<br>we've seen this happen quite a lot of<br>times um often the the engagement with M<br>communities only occurs when we're a<br>long way down um down the pipeline<br>rather right back at the beginning where<br>we we don't even know whether we can<br>find jeans or not so that ultimately the<br>thing that we're trying to wrap up with<br>this posum research is trying to create<br>resources for Kura Papa andari and part<br>of the reason for this is that I'm<br>working alongside the indigenous<br>genomics Institute one of our directors<br>is Haru who's the tum the<br>kuroani and one of the things that har<br>sees a lot is that there's not a lot of<br>developed resources for science in the<br>kopa that are really embedded in tikanga<br>and we're also lucky enough to be<br>working alongside TI fak maraki on this<br>so this sort of area of my research is a<br>bit of an outgrowth from a conference<br>here at the University of wut actually<br>back in 2020 the sing 2020 conference it<br>was a really amazing experience there<br>were indigenous scientists from all over<br>the world um and uh it was just<br>fantastic to get to hear from people who<br>are really uh experts and weaving<br>together their Mar Tonga and the science<br>that they were doing so there were a few<br>of us who grew up to alako was sitting<br>there feeling a little bit fuar a little<br>bit embarrassed and that was partly<br>because um as scientists in the room<br>will know often we suffer from imposter<br>syndrome if you're a mar scientist who<br>grew up T alakia you you suffer from it<br>two ways you worry about whether you're<br>a good enough scientist and you<br>definitely worry about whether you're a<br>good enough Marty and so instead of<br>being all sulky and and and not um not<br>thinking about how we could utilize our<br>backgrounds we decided to try and use<br>this as a strength so what we're up to<br>is to try and Empower M communities to<br>make informed decisions about genomics<br>and we thought we would take ourselves<br>as raw material so Mario scientists who<br>grew up to alakia and cult upskill<br>ourselves so we could go into<br>communities and be less likely to get<br>growlings from the AES but also walk<br>with those communities so that they<br>could learn a little bit about genomics<br>and I need to acknowledge uh Dr<br>Katherine Collins shown here and also Dr<br>Simon Hills up at Massie who are the<br>other co- pis on this<br>project so I've been really lucky to be<br>influenced in this journey by a number<br>of people who are far smarter than I am<br>and have spent a lot of time thinking<br>about the role of Science and mangar and<br>walking alongside each other but I<br>should also point out that all the<br>mistakes my own they're definitely not<br>responsible for the<br>um so that comes back to our pako<br>project uh we're looking at the past<br>present and future genomics impacts on<br>sitations so sitations are incredibly<br>important species they've been used um<br>for Millennia in terms of uh uh<br>resources but also respected as an<br>integral part of the environment um but<br>a lot of the genomics work that we've<br>done with citations hasn't necessarily<br>had a lot of Marty involvement and we<br>come back to this nerd speak being a<br>real barrier so working alongside Kyla<br>Russell and RAR alant Stewart who was<br>shown on the previous slide as well as<br>andot from and Dan hio from Oakland<br>University of Oakland what we're hoping<br>to do is to try and utilize some real<br>powerful knowledge transfer medium from<br>SAR including paku potentially Mahi toy<br>to try and wrap up some of this nerdy<br>genomics knowledge in a way that's more<br>easily accessible for<br>communities so ultimately I think this<br>is sort of talking about how we Empower<br>genomics to walk into the future we know<br>that genomics can be really useful from<br>a management perspective we know that it<br>can be useful for understanding past<br>present and emerging threats for species<br>and for identifying functionally<br>important genes that might help out in<br>our management of species what we need<br>to do a little bit better probably is to<br>facilitate this local this knowledge<br>interchange with our local communities<br>and the reason for that is that other<br>the ways we're spinning off in our<br>little Ivory tows not necessarily<br>looking at the things that are of<br>interest to<br>communities ultimately it'd be awesome<br>if we can Empower those communities to<br>actually utilize genomics for their own<br>C- purpose it's not always research lead<br>when we're coming into those communities<br>and there's a real need for this because<br>although we might be good at the could<br>and the science side T helps us a lot<br>with the should and to consider some of<br>the unanticipated impacts that we might<br>have from applying these Technologies to<br>populations so another way I could have<br>titled this talk is how do I avoid field<br>work but still get to learn about<br>species so we've got this beautiful Pik<br>here here if we zoom in on it we can see<br>these whale binnacles which are just<br>jammed on there for the rid so much like<br>these beautiful little mutualistic<br>organisms I definitely depend on my<br>colleagues who are actually out there<br>collecting the samples so in the cation<br>world this includes e Hau do um public<br>who have been responsible for reporting<br>strandings includes my um scientist<br>friends who actually likeing out on<br>boats and collecting by opsy samples and<br>on the posum side it includes the folks<br>who are actually out there working the<br>trapping lines and doing the hard Mahi<br>and with that I'd just like to thank all<br>the folks who've influenced This<br>research um and have been an integral<br>part of it and thanks you guys for<br>along<br>no question on there yet but um if Zoom<br>people want to put questions on I can<br>answer<br>them interested in looking<br>at as anything around that could be<br>human yeah yeah that's a great question<br>so our ultimate question when we were<br>doing that was did the genes we find in<br>Missouri correspond to the genes that<br>have be previously found in Pennsylvania<br>and the answer to that was unfortunately<br>no because it would have been really<br>sexy if we had um but we were using a<br>form of um genomic sequencing called<br>radx which doesn't actually get the<br>whole genome little chunks across it so<br>so I think I'm going to give you a non<br>answer and which is it would be great to<br>redo that kind of study with whole<br>genome sequencing where we get the whole<br>genome because I'm what I'm afraid of is<br>that yes we've found some genes but<br>we've likely missed a bunch that are<br>really important but there yeah there<br>some of the previously found genes in<br>the Pennsylvania region had sort of had<br>some links to memory potentially and and<br>neuro<br>neurocognition um for those of you guys<br>who've done this kind of study it's<br>often what I would recall a bit of a<br>fishing Expedition you find a gene<br>you're like okay seems important but the<br>real tricky part is figuring out what it<br>actually does and all of those studies<br>yeah first question is should orist be<br>of at the distribution of where they<br>are<br>yeah population control was being<br>considered<br>for<br>y oh cool yeah um okay update mat first<br>one so the ornithologists are really<br>organized compared to the satation world<br>and they actually released additions of<br>the like the bird Atlas every decade or<br>so so that that's where a lot of this<br>data comes from so they're really good<br>at updating updating things um just just<br>because you guys are here and you're a<br>captive audience you might have noticed<br>there was a like weird little dip in the<br>hybrid Zone that's actually the<br>Appalachian Mountains so there's also<br>these cool little sky islands where the<br>the the the same thing's happening but<br>in a vertical sense like the the<br>Carolina is moving up the side of the m<br>mountain and the the the black caps<br>stuff on the top the fish one I hadn't<br>heard of but fish in some way a little<br>bit easier to work with um so we've been<br>doing the sort of groundwork on the<br>posum side of things but the actual um<br>technology you would need to engineer<br>traits within the pums is tricky mup are<br>tricky in this space fish are a lot<br>easier we already have trip Floy fish<br>which are meant to be sterile um that<br>are often used in fact in like fish<br>farming where often they'll use<br>polyploid animals which are less likely<br>to potentially impact the wild<br>populations if they can escape<br>um so it would not surprise me if fish<br>is where we see some of the advances in<br>that that space um with freshw fish you<br>also have that nice ocean barrier to try<br>and contain anything that you might do<br>um at the moment and and it may change<br>the current government one of the the<br>barriers to that sort of research here<br>is the regulatory environment so you can<br>do gen editing as long as you can keep<br>an animal contained in a lab um which is<br>easier for some animals than others we<br>we did have a awesome Colony going down<br>in Oto for a while and they're<br>remarkable amazing animals um but not<br>not very tidy and they require an amount<br>of space to to keep them keep them<br>well and small place Mar ORS that have<br>sh I don't know of any um one of the<br>things that we find a bit tricky is that<br>it's there's the potential that the Maui<br>distri used to to extend further south<br>around the tonaki bite and that it's<br>been those sort of connecting<br>populations that have been knocked out<br>by impacts of fisheries and that comes<br>back to again it' be nice if we had a<br>ground troof of what things were like<br>beforehand so there are a few historical<br>samples around that might help us answer<br>that question um and we're now<br>occasionally seeing Hector Dolphins pop<br>up in areas that we previously hadn't<br>seen so they've just had some over in<br>the haki golf in the fifth of Tims um so<br>you can even see from the whole<br>distribution right the fact that these<br>tiny little dolphins are found around<br>the whole southern hemisphere every now<br>and then they must just go I'm just<br>going to go swimming and so they do have<br>the potential to disperse so yeah it's a<br>bit of an interesting Gap um and it's to<br>how much it's it's been human mediated<br>versus a natural one is I think an<br>outstanding<br>question<br>we<br>know<br>successful peopley to e engagement yeah<br>it's a tricky one I think I think as<br>supervisors we've got a lot of<br>responsibility to try and have those<br>relationships in place place already so<br>that we can extend them out to our<br>students and bring them in in my case I<br>was working on a species that my<br>supervisor hadn't worked on so he was<br>not a able to necessarily extend out his<br>that that sort of um approach um being<br>patient and realizing that there are a<br>lot of conflicting priorities that<br>people have to deal with if it's a<br>choice between solving the flooding and<br>the coas flats or answering your email<br>one of those things is more urgent than<br>the other so it's not that it isn't<br>isn't important it's just I think um the<br>capacity to engage is can be really<br>restricted um the other thing is uh<br>we're a little bit like a plague of<br>locusts that's signed us and all of us<br>are sending off emails to the<br>communities it's actually quite quite a<br>bit of a a time crunch so I think<br>there's probably broader conversations<br>that need to happen in the RSI sector<br>about how we facilitate the capacity on<br>the on the side of e and Hau in order to<br>be able to meaningfully engage um other<br>than that I mean i' I've been sitting<br>out on our eoo tyy our customary<br>Fisheries um b as a a pet nerd for<br>genetics tal that coming and that's been<br>actually probably one of the most<br>valuable things because it means you get<br>to see what what's on the community side<br>of uh in terms of priorities and what we<br>might build your research to actually be<br>helpful in the future so probably<br>encourage folks to look for those<br>opportunities where they can give back<br>and just sort of sit there and make the<br>cups of teas and man the tea tow station<br>and just listen to to what's important I<br>think part of the problem we have in<br>science is our funding structures are<br>very brief and these relationshipss are<br>enduring things so when you go into the<br>community it's almost like what's your<br>lifetime plan for maintaining that<br>relationship it doesn't it builds out<br>beyond the end of the grant

be not let the per<br>be the enemy of the better than we've<br>been in the past and try and work<br>together to to figure out what that<br>forward beh of<br>on I'm going to welcome our one of
