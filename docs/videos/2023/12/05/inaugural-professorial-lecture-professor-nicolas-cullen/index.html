Professor Cullen's<br>achievements I'd especially like to<br>welcome Professor Cullen's family his<br>wife Elizabeth daughter Susanna Mother<br>Anna sister Emma Davis and brother<br>Marcus Cullum I'm delighted that you<br>able to join us today on this very<br>special<br>occasion i' also like to acknowledge<br>Professor Cullen's father Roger Cen who<br>passed away exactly one year ago today<br>Nicholas I'm confident that he was very<br>proud of your<br>achievements it's not easy to become a<br>professor at the University of tago the<br>title Professor is reserved for the<br>highest achieving<br>academics it takes ability commitment<br>and hard work to become a professor you<br>need to be able to demonstrate that<br>you're a leader in your field of<br>research an outstanding teacher and that<br>you're providing significant service to<br>the academic and wider<br>Community as you will hear tonight Dr Dr<br>Cullen clearly earned the title of<br>professor professor Colin's research has<br>provided us with better understanding of<br>the impact of anthropogenic and climatic<br>variability on precipitation and snow<br>melt and Alpine reasons and their<br>Associated Global rep<br>repercussions the wide range of service<br>roles Professor Cullen carries out for<br>the benefit of his school the division<br>of humanities the university and the<br>wide academic and general Community is<br>impressive Professor cullin has also<br>received some excellent teaching<br>evaluations from a range of popular<br>undergraduate papers he teaches and he<br>is a ex and he's a strong record of<br>mentoring and supporting postgraduate<br>students I now invite Professor Rachel<br>spocken Smith from the high education<br>development center to formerly introduce<br>thanel and it's my pleasure and<br>privilege to introduce Professor<br>Nicholas Cullen normally it would be<br>done by a senior academic in his<br>department but with a few departures<br>they've called on me and I have a very<br>special place<br>uh in Nicholas's career so Nicholas was<br>my very first Master student when I<br>lectured in the geography department at<br>the University of Canterbury and indeed<br>this was his<br>thesis surface atmosphere interactions<br>over regenerating vegetation in the hon<br>Valley of the Port Hills despite having<br>me as a very green supervisor Nicholas<br>completed his master of science with<br>honors and then went on to the<br>University of Colorado where he began<br>his work in ic environments with his PhD<br>on characteristics of the atmospheric<br>boundary layer at Summit<br>Greenland after completing his PhD he<br>went on to do two post-doctoral<br>fellowships the first at Colorado and<br>the second at the University of insbrook<br>Austria the second postto was perhaps<br>more successful given that towards the<br>end he met Lisa his wife so she has been<br>with him for the journey here to atago<br>as in 2006 he accepted a position as<br>lecturer in the school of<br>geography Nicholas has enjoyed an<br>academic career characterized by<br>research Mobility mountains and other<br>icy environments he has conducted field<br>workor in Antarctica Greenland Tanzania<br>with six field Expeditions on kangaro<br>and of course here in the Southern Alps<br>his research spans the subfields of<br>meteorology and climatology with a<br>current focus on understanding how the<br>coldest regions of the Earth are<br>responding to climate<br>change his focus is motivated by the<br>urgent need to assess the impacts of ice<br>ice loss from glaciers and ice sheets on<br>sea level rise and the decline of<br>seasonal snow on Water<br>Resources Nicholas has been involved in<br>numerous National and international<br>projects has nearly 80 peer reviewed<br>Publications and has supervised nearly<br>40 graduate students his supervisory<br>capabilities were recognized with the<br>New Zealand geographical societies<br>president award for outstanding graduate<br>Supervision in<br>2015 he's also a passionate teacher<br>working to instill climate literacy and<br>undergraduates and generating a<br>framework of courses that introduce<br>students to key aspects of climate<br>change he is instrumental in promoting<br>International exchange opportunities for<br>his students and helped establish a new<br>student exchange agreement between ataro<br>and lingan University in Germany one of<br>his distinctions is is gaining an<br>arasmus award this year at Elan to focus<br>on Research informed teaching and<br>climatology he has also held a m<br>Fellowship awarded by a German Research<br>Foundation to enable intensive long-term<br>project-based collaboration with<br>researchers at Elan and from 2016 to<br>2018 held an Alexander Von hble research<br>Fellowship for long-term research in<br>Germany alongside his outstanding<br>research supervision and teaching he is<br>actively involved in a range of service<br>roles from co-leading the school of<br>geography through to membership of key<br>University boards and committees as well<br>as membership and significant roles in<br>professional<br>associations hopefully you're starting<br>to form a picture of Nicholas not just<br>as a researcher climbing mountains and<br>Chasing Ice but also as an extremely<br>dedicated teacher and supervisor and one<br>who's actively contributing to his<br>university and professional<br>communities without further Ado I will<br>hand over to Nicholas who is going to<br>talk about Chasing Ice in a warming<br>world he will reflect on the scientific<br>Journey he has taken with colleagues<br>students family and friends to chase the<br>remaining Ice Still found in our Frozen<br>Landscapes and an effort to better<br>understand the future fate of the<br>Nicholas Teno tenot Teno CA thank you<br>Phil and Jessica uh for coming this<br>evening to support me and Rachel for<br>your very kind words to my esteemed<br>colleagues students and<br>friends thank you for taking some time<br>to come and listen to me this evening I<br>would especially like to welcome my<br>family who have already been introduced<br>who have traveled from Christ Church uh<br>I should also mention chrisa Marie<br>who've come to do that uh it's lovely to<br>see you here and to my Swedish family<br>who might be zooming in and listening to<br>me from<br>afar and I also just want to say a<br>heartfelt thank you uh to my wife Lisa<br>and<br>Susie my daughter um for your love and<br>support and on this little journey that<br>we've really shared<br>together so tonight I'm going to talk a<br>little bit about my journey uh Chasing<br>Ice in this uh warming world and I<br>thought I'd just begin with this uh<br>figure here which is uh fairly familiar<br>to most people these days which is a uh<br>the global temperature record and uh you<br>can see from 1880 through to the present<br>and this is a uh a temperature anomaly<br>that our world has<br>warmed uh the most recent winter is the<br>warmest winter on record and uh 20123 is<br>certainly tracking to be the warmest<br>year on record and when I effect on this<br>little figure I look at that period in<br>particular because there's a lot of red<br>uh and it also was the time that I've<br>been on this Earth since<br>1971 things have kind of gone into the<br>red and that's the journey that I want<br>to talk to you about<br>today and how our perception of that has<br>changed even in my little<br>lifetime so I'm a climatologist as uh<br>Rachel mentioned and uh my interest is<br>certainly first and foremost in the<br>atmosphere and how it inter acts with<br>other parts of the climate system the<br>oceans the biosphere land surfaces but<br>most importantly for me I guess is the<br>cryosphere those regions on Earth that<br>are covered in snow or ice uh and they<br>importance uh it's really they're really<br>fairly critical to our climate system uh<br>mostly<br>because they reflect a lot of the sun's<br>energy um when we have a white surface<br>or a snow covered surface much of that<br>sunlight that comes uh is reflected<br>immediately back into space and so if<br>you have ice if you have snow on a<br>surface it controls that climate system<br>to some<br>degree and we're seeing changes of<br>course to that because of this<br>warming so the talk today I decided to<br>break up into three little Parts uh or<br>chapters the first I want to begin uh in<br>the 1970s uh 1971 was the year that I<br>was born and talk a little bit about a<br>myth the global cooling myth which some<br>of you might<br>remember um and then the advancing<br>glaciers in our own backyard and then<br>the second part will be the Greenland<br>ice sheet it<br>awakens uh and that coincided with the<br>time that I started my<br>PhD and talk a little bit about tropical<br>glaciers and the journey that I had uh<br>on kjaro and then that final chapter<br>which is mostly about Mountain glaciers<br>in the Southern Alps which has been my<br>focus since I've been at otago but all<br>of those places have actually been part<br>of my world while I've been at otago um<br>but they''re sort of separated in<br>chapters here just for uh<br>convenience so let's start back in the<br>1970s I was born in<br>1971 and uh there was plenty of evidence<br>even at that time that our Earth uh<br>might end up warming up a reasonable<br>amount because of greenhouse gases it<br>was nothing new in fact a Swedish<br>physical chemist Fant<br>arenus first proposed that if we put<br>greenhouse gases into our atmosphere uh<br>it could impact our climate uh and lead<br>to a global warming and this was back in<br>the late<br>1800s so in the 70s uh there was plenty<br>of knowledge but it wasn't that<br>accessible uh to the public and it<br>wasn't something that we were thinking<br>about but I did a quick search and there<br>is uh plenty of literature out there uh<br>focusing on this carbon dioxide<br>problem in the Greenhouse<br>Effect and so if we think of that Global<br>temperature record again of course we<br>focus on that and it's understandable<br>it's been a massive rise in temperature<br>uh since that period of time but that<br>myth about global cooling had a little<br>bit to do with that part from the 1940s<br>or the mid 1940s through to the uh early<br>1970s there wasn't that much warming in<br>fact it flattened out a little bit even<br>though greenhouse gases were increasing<br>and the reason they think that occurred<br>was because after World War<br>II with all the industrial activity that<br>was occurring there were a lot of<br>aerosol sulfate aerosols primarily being<br>put into the atmosphere which were<br>reflecting sunlight they also think<br>there's a little bit of a natural<br>variability inside that signal but it<br>leveled off a little and so the popular<br>media got on to that and uh and I<br>remember this as a as a child growing up<br>in the 1970s<br>that we might be Hing for another Ice<br>Age uh there was C in going on but it<br>wasn't really supported uh by the<br>literature uh others have gone back and<br>you can see from this figure here the<br>number of Publications at the time from<br>1965 to the late<br>1970s and the red line here is uh P<br>published papers associated with this<br>idea that the Earth will warm because of<br>greenhouse gases and then the other<br>around the cooling the imminent uh next<br>Ice Age which was uh being discussed by<br>some and then there was another thing<br>that was going on at that time and it<br>was uh the fear of nuclear war we grew<br>up I think in the 70s and early ' 80s<br>actually worrying about nuclear war and<br>one of the implications of that if it<br>occurred would be that we might be<br>plunged into um a global cooling or some<br>kind of climatic cooling is associated<br>with nuclear<br>war very different to how we think about<br>things today I<br>think the other interesting thing that<br>was going on in New Zealand too at that<br>time at the beginning of the 19 80s uh<br>some of our glaciers at least 50 or so<br>started<br>advancing and uh we've got quite careful<br>records of that and that continued to<br>about the mid<br>2000s So Not only was there the<br>perception that the Earth might be<br>calling little old New Zealand had<br>glaciers that were also advancing at<br>that<br>time and uh we we think that's probably<br>mostly associated with uh a slight<br>Cooling in the new cem region and that<br>the sea surface temperatures were a<br>little bit lower than<br>normal so that set the scene for me<br>growing up back in the 1980s at school<br>here's a photo of me this is the first I<br>could find uh from standard three and<br>through to<br>intermediate then I ended up at boy High<br>Christ Church boy high school and uh<br>this is my third form picture and this<br>is how I looked at the end of all of<br>that 5 years later and uh I like school<br>and and I quite like studying um<br>and it was a different time I think and<br>I can reiterate we certainly weren't<br>worrying about global warming at that<br>point if anything as I said uh perhaps<br>that imminent new Ice Age was on its way<br>the one thing about uh school was that I<br>always had a little bit of a passion for<br>uh skiing and you will see the back uh<br>on the wall there there's a poster um a<br>poster of a skier and so while I enjoyed<br>my study our certainly enjoyed escaping<br>from Christ Church and heading up into<br>the Hills uh to a place called kurn<br>Valley which is about an hour and a half<br>west of Christ Church to a place called<br>craigburn Valley and this is probably<br>where my passion for snow and ice began<br>my father introduced us all to this he<br>discovered the place in his late 50s and<br>uh and spent a lot of time up there<br>Hammond his friend ended up uh acquiring<br>a hut for hour tear and it burnt down<br>but they rebuilt it the year I was born<br>in<br>19771 and that became a bit of a center<br>for our family and I also enjoyed that<br>period and I'm probably best remembered<br>for my exploits and uh Speed Skiing<br>rather than my academic<br>achievements uh and this is a gang of us<br>uh in the late 80s with our speed skis<br>and it was at the end of<br>school that I decided uh rather than go<br>directly to University I'd head to<br>Sweden<br>uh following my dream to become a bit of<br>a skier um but also it was an important<br>period in my life because I went and<br>lived with my Swedish family and uh and<br>learned my mother's tongue Swedish and<br>and spent a considerable time with my<br>with my Swedish family but after that I<br>ended up back in Christ Church doing my<br>undergraduate degree and then my<br>Master's Degree with Rachel in the hon<br>Valley and I was lucky because Rachel<br>had just come from UBC in Canada and uh<br>had worked with a quite a well we should<br>say famous boundary lay meteorologist<br>Tim Oak who had really set the scene and<br>The Benchmark for boundary lay<br>meteorology so Rachel rolled in and uh<br>and I felt really lucky to be able to<br>work with her uh on a problem which was<br>really focusing on the microclimate of<br>this little<br>Valley and I think we're on a good thing<br>there Rachel actually all those years<br>ago indigenous vegetation trying to<br>understand what the microclimate would<br>be<br>uh thinking about how regeneration of<br>indigenous vegetation is important and<br>uh and I think we're still grappling<br>with those things today one of the big<br>outcomes for that uh was to set up a<br>series of weather stations and this is<br>kind of the beginning of what became a<br>bit of a uh a backbone to what I really<br>do and I would say it was fairly<br>ambitious we set up two permanent Towers<br>in that Valley<br>uh a b ratio system which measures uh<br>the energy and water<br>fluxes and uh that allowed us to look at<br>evaporation and heat transfers over that<br>indigenous<br>vegetation as well as a mobile Tower um<br>and it was that training that really set<br>me up uh for for some of the next<br>chapters in my<br>life during that time though uh one of<br>my fond memories of that period doing my<br>undergraduate and master's degrees were<br>the escape to the mountains and uh like<br>many of my graduate students today uh I<br>would be looking at we the maps in<br>between lectures and as soon as a high<br>pressure came along I would try and<br>escape and I spent a lot of time in the<br>Southern Alps especially in the canbury<br>region uh doing lots of recreational<br>climbing at that time which was uh<br>building my passion for understanding<br>how these uh unique systems were're<br>behaving so that takes me to uh sort of<br>the second chapter the Greenland ice<br>sheet awakens and the demise of tropical<br>glaciers and I arrived there and started<br>my PhD in<br>1999 and uh it was a fantastic period<br>and a really interesting period because<br>things were changing really<br>rapidly so when I arrived the consensus<br>at that time was the eye sheets were<br>basically imbalance and I had to check<br>this actually I remembered it uh but I<br>went back to the ipcc reports just to<br>confirm it and uh it's true like the the<br>thought at that time was that they were<br>in equilibrium they weren't growing or<br>shrinking and uh even though they were<br>aware that the greenhouse gases were<br>likely to impact uh the climate which<br>would then lead to a response from the<br>ice sheets they were certainly still<br>thinking they were in<br>equilibrium it was the same again in the<br>1995 ipcc report um ipcc I should say is<br>the intergovernmental panel for climate<br>change the United Nations uh since 1990<br>have been producing these sort of state-<br>of the climate reports uh every five<br>years or so and sort of there our<br>Benchmark in terms of our understanding<br>of uh what is happening to our climate<br>system and uh they were still thinking<br>perhaps because the world might be<br>warmer that it would increase<br>precipitation so even perhaps leading to<br>an increase in the mass balance of uh<br>Antarctica so no shrinking at that time<br>that would be perhaps even uh glaciers<br>growing so I landed in Boulder Colorado<br>and that's actually why I have this uh<br>gown it's uh the buff Buffalo color from<br>uh the University of Colorado at Boulder<br>and uh got immediately involved as a<br>post as a postgraduate student a PhD<br>student in this Parker program the<br>program for Arctic Regional climate<br>assessment and their game was to try and<br>figure out the mass balance of the<br>Greenland ice sheet is it growing or<br>shrinking and uh they were doing that in<br>lots of different ways<br>observationally uh but the big thing<br>that they were doing was looking at it<br>from<br>aircraft and space so remote sens<br>and the big thing here was uh Airborne<br>laser altimetry so an aircraft with a<br>laser on it flying over the I sheet<br>measuring the distance from that<br>aircraft to the surface and if you do<br>that over repeat surveys you can<br>understand whether it's uh increasing in<br>height or lowering in height which gives<br>you a sense of whether uh it's losing or<br>gaining<br>mass and we were sort of parked up in<br>this part of the equation uh as a<br>research group led by Connie Stefan the<br>surface energy balance uh and<br>understanding the<br>climate and so ipcc and the consensus in<br>the '90s was that there was uh these ice<br>big ice sheets were imbalance but this<br>work by uh Bill krael uh he was based at<br>the University of Kansas at the time he<br>was behind uh the laser altimetry from<br>these P3 aircrafts the NASA aircraft and<br>this paper that came out in the 90ss<br>1999 started to change the game and they<br>realized that the southern part of the<br>Greenland ice sheet was really<br>responding to a warming signal and that<br>it was lowering and there was certainly<br>a<br>retreat um and and and from this<br>observation from aircraft using those it<br>sort of spawned a whole new interest in<br>what Greenland might be up to and uh is<br>it actually uh responding to climate<br>change so so as a post-graduate student<br>or PhD candidate I was in a research<br>group led by Connie Stefan who was from<br>switzland uh Swiss Professor ended up in<br>Boulder and uh very much a field-based<br>climatologist and I worked closely at<br>the time with Jason box we were both PhD<br>students and I was arrived in Boulder in<br>January 1999 I was basically deployed to<br>Greenland in March uh 1999 after a<br>couple months and spent 3 and a half<br>months on the Greenland ice sheet<br>primarily on that trip servicing weather<br>stations so con had set up the GC net<br>the Greenland climate network uh which<br>was a series of weather stations across<br>the ice sheet and uh they needed to be<br>serviced the ice sheets up in the<br>accumulation Zone tended to get buried<br>so you had to raise them otherwise you'd<br>lose them uh and and the ones around the<br>margins of the ice sheet were melting<br>out so you had to lower them and redrill<br>and make sure uh that they didn't fall<br>over because of all the melting<br>ice it was a lot of field work and uh<br>really remote field work we did all of<br>our Logistics which is different to<br>Antarctica uh we got to Greenland we<br>ched the flights ourselves we made the<br>weather calls and we ended up staying in<br>these little remote camps and I do<br>remember uh being up at this little Camp<br>here uh hanol uh back in uh May 1999 and<br>getting a uh little text message that<br>Emma's first son Benjamin was born and I<br>remember walking out of that tent and<br>looking out across the eye sheet and<br>thinking wow that's an amazing thing uh<br>we were really remote there's a couple<br>places I just want to point out some at<br>Greenland which is at the top of the<br>Greenland ice sheet the Peterman Glacier<br>which is the Northwest Greenland and<br>also uh some uh Swiss Camp which I'm<br>going to talk a little bit about Swiss<br>Camp is a more established camp and then<br>we had a whole series of weaer stations<br>down in the ablation Zone uh from<br>there so up to Summit now just to the<br>top of the Greenland ice sheet quickly<br>uh in the late 1980s and early 1990s uh<br>they drilled two ice cores to<br>bedrock uh that involved drilling<br>through 3,000 M of ice and allowed them<br>to reconstruct climate through to the<br>Eman which is the last interglacial<br>about 125,000 years ago a massive<br>achievement and started to kind of<br>change people's understanding of how the<br>ice have behaved over that kind of time<br>scale but in the meantime they realized<br>that they couldn't quite understand all<br>the chemistry you know what chemicals<br>ended up in that ice Cole how did they<br>go from the snow or atmosphere and<br>reside back into the ice and so there<br>was a flurry of activity with uh snow<br>chemists working up at the top of the<br>Greenland I sheet trying to better<br>understand how some of those chemical<br>species actually ended up in the ice<br>core so they called on us to take some<br>turbulence measurements<br>uh which are basically understanding how<br>we have exchanges of heat moisture and<br>some of these other chemical species to<br>to really get a an understanding of the<br>the wind pumping and the exchanges of<br>some of these things it was tricky work<br>and uh the the the snow chemists really<br>wanted these uh ity diffusivities or<br>exchange coefficients they wanted me to<br>tell them what that wind or turbulence<br>was doing uh so they could figure out<br>how that snow chemistry was behaving<br>but I was getting worried because it was<br>uh it was a really difficult environment<br>to take those types of measurements uh<br>you have a very stable atmosphere but<br>also unstable which is quite unusual um<br>over snow the other challenging part of<br>it was that the turbulence was really<br>intermittent so it would be really<br>stable and nothing would happen for a<br>long time and then you'd get these<br>little flurries of activity which I'm<br>trying to demonstrate with this plot<br>which is just shows you a 30 minute time<br>time sequence uh which has in this case<br>990,000 values because we were measuring<br>at 50 hertz 50 samples per second to try<br>and capture this turbulence and uh you<br>can sort of see nothing would nothing<br>would occur and uh and then suddenly you<br>get this<br>activity this ended up being the focus<br>of my PhD and uh and and there was a<br>moment there when I was working with the<br>snow chemists desperately trying to<br>generate these uh flux values for them<br>and uh I had a visitor from uh<br>Switzerland matius Roto who's now<br>leading the uh climate group there and<br>uh we went out for a lunch and I I was<br>sort of telling him hey I'm really<br>finding it quite challenging to make<br>sure that this Theory which we're<br>working with up there uh is actually<br>working and he said to me uh well maybe<br>you should stop trying to do that and<br>actually flip that problem on its head<br>and show people why it's so difficult uh<br>and and what some of those uncertainties<br>are rather than trying to just show that<br>it does work and it was just one of<br>those simple moments<br>and it stuck with me because uh I think<br>we end up doing a lot of that with us as<br>as with our students reframing problems<br>thinking about how to turn them around<br>uh and sometimes they're right in front<br>of you but you don't really see them<br>matius Roto really helped me with that<br>one but the real action actually was<br>going on around the margins of the<br>Greenland ice sheet this is where the<br>Melt had been detected and we knew<br>things were going on and so uh this is<br>just a little project that occurred up<br>on the Peterman Glacier which is a large<br>Outlet Glacier in Northwestern Greenland<br>70 km long and 20 km<br>wide discharging about 12 cubic km of<br>Ice uh per year 70 km long is about the<br>drive from here down to B CLA that's the<br>length of the this part of the ice<br>tongue 20 km wide is about the the full<br>length of Theo Harbor it's a massive<br>massive floating body of ice that is<br>discharged from the Greenland ice<br>sheet we went there and did some field<br>work and uh we really wanted to<br>understand how much melting was<br>occurring at the bottom of of that<br>floating tongue no one had ever been<br>there before we weren't too sure whether<br>we could land in there even with these<br>twin OTS and uh Connie my supervisor at<br>the time uh was trying to get some<br>support to do it but the rumor was<br>amongst The Graduate students that it<br>was going to be a really horrible windy<br>site and so no one really put their<br>hands up um but it ended up not being<br>that at all it was beautiful so this is<br>where our site or Camp was and we first<br>set up uh two little<br>tents uh we had polar bears potentially<br>visiting uh the camp so we had to do<br>some uh practice with rifles and this is<br>a picture of uh Eric rno who's quite a<br>famous glaciologist and uh it was funny<br>watching him getting instructions from<br>uh Connie Stefan how to fire a rifle it<br>was probably the first time I'd done it<br>too uh luckily we never saw any polar<br>beers this is what these kind of camps<br>look like out on the ice sheet and uh<br>inside this is sort of how we lived not<br>too different from a camping setup and<br>uh some if you're on a summer holiday<br>there's the gas cooker and other bits<br>and pieces here was my little computer<br>with the data loggers and everything<br>else that I was using and the very<br>important bread maker which uh was uh<br>next to my office<br>space it was wide and open out there and<br>we had to do a lot of work just moving<br>around out on that massive floating ice<br>tongue we worked long hours and<br>sometimes through the night and uh it<br>was<br>exhausting and there were little<br>surprises everywhere we went on Peterman<br>it's a remarkable and beautiful place<br>and uh I'll never really forget that<br>that field work but there were dangers<br>too there were there were difficulties<br>uh when we were moving around out on the<br>pedum and there were lots of things that<br>you had to be careful of we did ground<br>penetrating radar which allowed us to<br>see through the ice to work out the<br>thickness of that floating ice tongue so<br>we have a body of ice that's come being<br>discharged from the ice sheet and it's<br>floating on the ocean and we used that<br>ground penetrating radar to see through<br>and what we disc covered was it's not<br>flat underne underneath there there were<br>large valleys and grooves and there was<br>a lot of melt<br>occurring in fact about 20 M of uh melt<br>per year<br>underneath the ice sheet or the floating<br>floating ice and that was the beginning<br>I think for Greenland uh of<br>understanding that the ocean can really<br>interact with our ice and and there was<br>a lot of activity of course then down in<br>and Antarctica doing similar things but<br>we were seeing that in Northwestern<br>Greenland and we were also doing some<br>observations meterological observations<br>again I was busy uh trying to understand<br>how much melt we had on the surface as<br>well and uh we calculated that as being<br>about 1 meter per year so it was losing<br>mass but most of it was occurring<br>underneath the ocean the warm ocean was<br>melting 20 m per year the atmosphere and<br>the surface only a meter so that was<br>starting to transform our thinking a<br>little bit about what some of these<br>physical processes really were that were<br>controlling this acceleration and<br>Retreat of ice after I left Peterman<br>changed and a large fragment broke off<br>uh in 2012 indicating instability and uh<br>and questions being raised about the<br>long-term stability of of<br>Petman and just to leave Greenland uh<br>Swiss Camp was that little camp on the<br>western margin of the Greenland I sheet<br>that I talked<br>about and it was a site that we would do<br>a lot of intensive field observations<br>and when we used to arrive we would<br>arrive and see it like this uh in in the<br>early part of the summer and often<br>involved trying to dig out these tents<br>here and doing a lot of work just to<br>kind of get that camp going but through<br>time uh they were confronted more with<br>this and so if anything is an indicator<br>of how much melt started to occur in<br>Greenland this little<br>simple<br>demonstration really shows us that uh<br>things were changing in Greenland and<br>that station that used to get buried is<br>suddenly melting out on the western<br>2020 uh in August 2020 where my<br>supervisor Connie went back to try and<br>disestablish that camp it was falling<br>apart and the weather was poor it was in<br>that period of Co they they should have<br>been up there earlier but they went in<br>late uh and in and in that field trip he<br>fell into a crass and uh and and we lost<br>Connie and his legacy<br>uh Swiss Camp Legacy ended there and and<br>it it was a it was a tragic event but<br>said something about really Greenland<br>and and what it happened in Greenland<br>and a year after his son Simon and his<br>friend went back and completed uh just<br>establishing that camp and uh and and<br>now it no longer exists but I spent a<br>lot of time there with Connie and he was<br>quite a remarkable<br>person after Boulder Colorado I moved to<br>um inbrook as Rachel<br>said and uh started working with a group<br>interested in kilamanjaro which is the<br>highest freestanding mountain in the<br>world and uh has glaciers on it the<br>Snows of kilamanjaro as Hemingway has uh<br>written<br>about and uh it's a<br>large volcano it's about<br>5,895 M high and uh it has an<br>interesting group of glaciers which are<br>quite complex and Karu became a bit of a<br>icon for global warming and especially<br>after a published paper by Lonny<br>Thompson he was a big ice core guy and<br>uh he extracted a lot of ice cores out<br>of the tropical regions and he published<br>this in 2000 and talked about the<br>evolution of that ice cap over the holos<br>scene like the last 10,000 years but<br>predicted that those glaciers would<br>disappear uh by the 20 2015 and 20 which<br>uh was really established by just<br>putting a linear regression through some<br>of the retreat rates that they had<br>mapped it irked the person that I ended<br>up working with uh Gail Kaza and uh<br>postto Thomas Mur who's the person now<br>I've done a lot of work with the nean<br>and uh so they wrote this concept paper<br>to sort of set the stage to sort of say<br>hey we need to go back to killamanjaro<br>we we we should think a little bit about<br>what some of those processes really are<br>that are controlling that<br>Retreat so typical Glacier looks a<br>little bit like this uh you'd expect<br>snowfall at the top perhaps across the<br>whole Glacier uh most of the Melt occurs<br>at the bottom we have a series of energy<br>exchanges that control the Melt and<br>other things but the thing about<br>kilamanjaro it looks a little bit more<br>like this you have these unusual<br>fragments or uh little pieces of ice and<br>uh and what makes them quite different<br>to your regular Glacier is that they<br>have quite steep Cliffs or vertical<br>walls and once you have those in a place<br>like Kilimanjaro in the tropics uh it's<br>hard to prevent or stop the<br>retreat so I'll take you for a quick<br>Scenic trip around uh kilamanjaro we did<br>this flight in 2005 and so you can kind<br>of see what was left at that<br>time here's the southern ice Fields um<br>you can see they sort of look somewhat<br>like a traditional Glacier in this<br>regard<br>and there was still ice there at that<br>time but you can see that it was<br>fragmented here is the Eastern ice field<br>there's only little parts of it left you<br>can see the discoloration on the ground<br>where the ice used to be but has<br>retreated and disappeared and there's<br>the northern ice field the largest ice<br>body still on kilamanjaro<br>you can see how there's these little H<br>features here these are these quite<br>unusual Cliff like features they're<br>quite<br>tabula and so we set up this kind of<br>framework which has been something that<br>I've continued with with students here<br>is uh we want to understand the<br>atmospheric controls on those<br>glaciers and we want to link those to<br>large scale climate and there are<br>different Pathways to link large scale<br>climate to the smaller scales you can do<br>it statistically or dynamically uh and<br>it's probably where I've spent a lot of<br>my time trying to disentangle the large<br>scale climate signal to what's happening<br>on the<br>ground and of course kilamanjaro has<br>this complexity because we've got these<br>funny little remaining ice bodies little<br>blocks so this is how it looks on the<br>ground and we did fieldwork on Karo here<br>is uh goog walking up against one of<br>these<br>Cliffs quite unusual lots of little<br>Jagged features which uh demonstrate<br>that this Environ environment is uh not<br>dominated by melt but sublimation of ice<br>which is uh the phase from solid<br>straight to Vapor if it was melting<br>along these surfaces uh you would see<br>much more rounded edges and much more<br>rounded<br>slopes and we installed a vertical wall<br>station here next to one of these cliffs<br>in uh January of 200 and<br>five and it was your classic Weather<br>Station set up uh we had these radiation<br>measurements and they were important<br>because one of those was a perometer<br>which allowed us to measure the<br>temperature of that ice surface and we<br>also had an instrument here which was a<br>Sonic ranging sensor which allowed us to<br>measure the distance from that sensor to<br>the vertical<br>wall unlike Greenland where I work<br>remotely uh and often on my own in the<br>these remote locations uh this was<br>fabulous I had a team of guides and<br>lovely tanzanians who would help me and<br>it was tough up there at uh almost 6,000<br>M was a difficult environment to work<br>and and I'll always always remember the<br>friendships that I made uh working with<br>those<br>guys so here's just an example of what<br>happens along one of those little Cliffs<br>so this is one year of data from March<br>one year through to March the next and<br>on this Y axis we have distance<br>from the weather station to the cliff<br>and the other solar<br>declination and so the shading here<br>represents the period where that Cliff<br>is mostly in shade and you can see the<br>distance doesn't change very much but<br>once uh you get into a sunlet period<br>that Retreat really rapidly increases<br>and you get melting along that wall and<br>so we're able to measure directly just<br>how much are those ice walls retreating<br>per year and it turns out it was about<br>70 to 80 cm per year or about a meter so<br>once that thing starts there's no way<br>you can really prevent it and you will<br>see a retreat uh on those at that kind<br>of magnitude through time we also use<br>photogrammetry which is a series of<br>photographs at the cliff uh taken at one<br>point in time and then returning to see<br>them again which demonstrated that uh<br>there's varability a those Cliff faces<br>but there's a coherent signal between<br>sunlit versus<br>shaded once you end up with Cliffs like<br>that in an environment like that there's<br>nothing you can do there's only Retreat<br>and I think that's uh one of the unique<br>parts of the retreat of ice on<br>Karo we also worked on the southern ice<br>fields and uh I ended up having to<br>install one of those weather stations uh<br>in that period in January 2005 I was up<br>there with Thomas mer and Gail Kaza both<br>were unwell on that day so I wandered<br>over to the southern icefield on my own<br>and I still to this day remember peering<br>down that slope of the Southern icefield<br>thinking am I going to go down there and<br>try and install this weather station uh<br>but it was a beautiful view over uh the<br>African Savana I eyed it up again and I<br>did end up wandering about halfway down<br>that Southern icefield and f a location<br>which I thought would work uh it wasn't<br>too steep but it was reasonably testing<br>and by the time I got back up and talked<br>to the guides and said I've got a spot I<br>think we should go down to this location<br>they just looked at me and shook their<br>heads and said we're not going down<br>there uh and so we ended<br>up installing it at the top it was hard<br>work trying to get the brain to work and<br>putting this logger together and wiring<br>a Data Logger up at altitude but Joel<br>who was a fabulous guy and still I'm<br>still in contact with helped me install<br>that weather station uh and it ran for<br>almost uh 15 to 20<br>years and it was a similar setup uh<br>simple observations the key for us being<br>again these radiation measurements which<br>allows us to understand how much<br>sunlight Shines on these glaciers we can<br>then derive cloud cover and understand<br>how cloudy it is and we know what the<br>surface temperature is when it's melting<br>when it's not and we use energy and mass<br>balance models then to calculate how<br>much mass is being<br>lost as Rachel noted I went back six<br>times in that period and every time it<br>was different and uh you would go there<br>and service those weather stations<br>hoping that they were running we didn't<br>have Telemetry so it was always a bit of<br>a open up the logger connect and hope<br>and uh but we had a pretty good record<br>out of there and kjara was different<br>every time and uh as you can see from<br>these penitentes these ice needles it<br>was often really sublimation dominated<br>not so much<br>melting and so we looked at the uh rate<br>of retreat for the southern ice field to<br>uh using one of these energy and mass<br>balance models and we were dealing with<br>about half a meter a year of retreat<br>much more down at the bottom of the<br>glacier um but on average about half<br>half a meter what we also did was some<br>backward modeling we asked the question<br>what was happening back at the end of<br>the 19th century when these things were<br>retreating initially and found that the<br>climate didn't have to be too different<br>to today just small little perturbations<br>can really make these things uh behave<br>in different ways if anything we really<br>felt the climate had to be wetter in the<br>past than today we're just not getting<br>as much snowfall as we need but<br>ultimately I think Kara's Glaciers are<br>really just remnants of a past climate<br>and uh and the retreat is irreversible<br>and I think we'll see them<br>disappear and I did some work here with<br>Pascal serue we Revisited the mapping uh<br>had another look at those uh estimates<br>by Lonnie Thompson and uh I think it's<br>more likely that most of these glaciers<br>will be gone by the middle of the<br>century as opposed to have already<br>disappeared and uh we put this animation<br>together this was uh really work done by<br>Pascal this is what it looked like in<br>1912 we had about 12 square kilm of ice<br>on Kilimanjaro certainly covering all of<br>the Southern ice field at that time and<br>then the retreat began and uh and it and<br>it hasn't stopped here's 1960s into the<br>1970s you can see the Western breach has<br>these isolated ice bodies but it's all<br>starting to break apart becoming<br>isolated and then really vulnerable to<br>additional melting just because they're<br>surrounded by Ash Rock and other and<br>other<br>things and that brings me to my last<br>little chapter and uh and and my journey<br>here I guess uh while I've been at AO<br>the accelerating Retreat of mountain<br>glaciers and also just understanding<br>that there's these widespread changes to<br>the cryosphere so when I returned it was<br>sort of the question I had to ask myself<br>oh what what's next what what shall I do<br>and uh we're all here and it was<br>exciting to have uh those Southern Alps<br>in my backyard again and so that became<br>a bit of my focus and my current uh<br>areas of research are linked to Mountain<br>glaciers so I'm into the glaciers thing<br>still but also seasonal snow uh and how<br>they modify water availability in our<br>largest drainage basins and then I've<br>got uh an interest in the mcmo drive<br>valleys in Antarctica and I've got a<br>couple of students working on that<br>Tamara Tamar up there and also Marta<br>who's currently uh in the mcmo triy<br>valleys I've only got time to talk a<br>little bit about the impact on glaciers<br>and the work that we're doing in in that<br>space so Mountain<br>glaciers uh occupy about<br>200,000 uh there's about 200,000<br>Mountain glaciers in the world occupying<br>about 700,000 Square kilm in the present<br>and uh if we took them all today and<br>melted them it would be equal to about<br>40 cm of the sea level<br>rise which is only 1% of the total uh<br>amount of land Ice uh the ice sheets are<br>where most of our ice resides Greenland<br>and Antarctica but they're still<br>important contributors to sea level rise<br>today um and so we have quite a strong<br>interest in them their contribution as a<br>proportion to the total amount of sea<br>level rise is actually still quite High<br>comparable or equal to the ice<br>sheets so that area is about the same<br>size as uh New South Wales and<br>uh as I said uh they are important<br>contributors to Global sea level um<br>accounting for about 177% of<br>the uh sea level rise that we currently<br>observe so then I had to sort of think<br>well should I tackle this problem at a<br>global scale uh would that make sense<br>but there's quite a big Community out<br>there looking at uh the retreat of<br>glaciers at a global scale so it made<br>more sense to me I think to focus on the<br>local and Regional impacts of Glacier<br>loss how they'll impact Stream flow um<br>modify Stream flow properties and and<br>other<br>processes but I do before getting into<br>that I just really want to briefly tell<br>you a little bit about what that Global<br>Glacier modeling Community does uh<br>because it's an interesting exercise how<br>do you go about trying to understand how<br>our glaciers at a global scale are<br>retreating<br>first you need to know something about<br>the global climate and you use uh<br>reanalysis or these Global Climate<br>models but they are they run at a really<br>large scale so you have to downscale you<br>have to come up with some sort of method<br>to make that data more representative at<br>a smaller grid scale and there's a lot<br>of work involved going from Global<br>Climate down to local<br>climate then you have to run a little<br>Glacier model and you need to know<br>something about the surface Mass balance<br>what is controlling that Glacier is it<br>going to grow or Shrink and what are the<br>controls on it temperature and some of<br>these other um energy<br>exchanges you also have to take into<br>account the geometry changes of that<br>Glacier once you start to understand<br>whether it's growing or shrinking and uh<br>there are some tricks doing that too<br>it's not that easy to understand how<br>those changes are occurring over time<br>once you do that you can calculate the<br>volume change you sum all all of that up<br>and that gives you an estimate then of<br>the contribution of ice to sea level<br>rise and it's that framework that allows<br>people then to make these projections<br>that we see uh at a global scale and<br>this work comes from Ben Marion who I<br>work with in insbrook uh the projections<br>then what are our glaciers on a global<br>scale going to do in the future how much<br>ice loss will we see by the endend of<br>this century and uh you can see that<br>it's dependent on the emission scenario<br>how what is our pathway and uh the ipcc<br>and some of these other agencies have<br>different emission scenarios a low<br>emission scenario uh where we would be<br>curbing our emissions which we sometimes<br>refer to as RCP 2.6 2.6 actually being<br>uh the radiative forcing and watts per<br>meter squared or<br>we don't do very much at all uh and we<br>allow those emissions to run away on us<br>and that radiative forcing will be much<br>larger RCP<br>8.5 and so depending on that emission<br>pathway that will dictate to some extent<br>what those glacies will do by the end of<br>the century but on a global scale we're<br>looking at about an 18 to<br>36% change in the amount of ice that we<br>will have which equals about 8 to 16<br>cm what's interesting though is if you<br>look at the small glaciers the pockets<br>of small glaciers in places like New<br>Zealand and Scandinavia because there's<br>much less<br>Mass uh and they're at Mid or lower<br>latitudes uh the projections suggest<br>that much more ice in those regions will<br>disappear and so for a place like New<br>Zealand we would expect by the end of<br>the century about 80% of our glaciers to<br>have<br>disappeared and and so then you can<br>start considering uh the uncertainty in<br>those estimates and Ben came up with<br>this plot which shows us uh what is the<br>uncertainty going into all of this<br>modeling from 2020 through to<br>2100 and you broke it up into four<br>components the glacier model<br>uncertainty the climate model<br>uncertainty the emission scenario and<br>the natural variability so have you got<br>the right model at a global scale for<br>your es how's your climate model going<br>do you understand your climate do you<br>have a handle on the emission scenario<br>do you know what the emissions will be<br>and the natural variability what will<br>that be as well and so in the present it<br>makes a huge difference what Glacier<br>model you end up using because uh in the<br>current in the present we actually have<br>a reasonable understanding of our<br>climate um so much of that uncertainty<br>is associated with the glacier model but<br>as as time goes on it's the emission<br>scenario that will dictate the<br>variability much more so than the<br>glacier model and the input<br>uncertainty I'm giving you a little bit<br>of that detail because it sets the stage<br>for where I've tried to Center my<br>research while I've been at ataro so<br>what are those key uncertainties and how<br>should we be handling them you've got<br>Global Climate you've all these biases<br>in those global climate models we don't<br>quite understand how some of those<br>things work so we need to evaluate them<br>that downscaling trying to connect the<br>large scale climate down to the local<br>climate is a challenge you can use<br>different methods to do<br>that uh the geometry we use quite<br>simplified models to try and understand<br>how those glaciers will change in size<br>and dimension and we use we could use<br>then more physics based models to try to<br>account for some of that<br>complexity but it was the surface energy<br>balance that model uncertainty that I I<br>thought maybe we can make a contribution<br>in that space to improve those models to<br>make sure that those projections are<br>more robust moving from quite simple<br>empirical models to more physics based<br>models that really allow us to<br>disentangle some of the surface energy<br>exchanges so my thinking was to place<br>myself in this space when I got to a<br>Targo to try and Tackle some of those<br>problems not up at the global scale but<br>trying to understand some of those<br>processes um at the surface mass balance<br>and local scale and so to do that we set<br>up a program uh in the Southern Alps at<br>Brewster Glacier uh which is just west<br>of the main divide it sits under mount<br>Brewster which is at about 2,400 M uh<br>the elevation down here is, 1600 M or<br>so and uh at the end of every winter we<br>go up there and measure um first the<br>snow density by digging snow pits and we<br>also do a series of probes that allow us<br>to work out how much snow actually fell<br>on the glacier we then install the BL<br>Stakes using steam drills which are<br>basically drilled into the ice 10 m into<br>the ice that allow us as measuring<br>sticks to work out how much of that snow<br>and ice actually melts over the<br>summer and that gives us the mass<br>balance it tells us what the inputs are<br>and what the outputs are and it's just<br>provided us with a baseline for the<br>modeling and other observations that we<br>do the field workor is relatively simple<br>but can be logistically demanding it can<br>be quite complicated there up at<br>times my view is that probably one of<br>the more important parts of this<br>fieldwork is the opportunity it has<br>given me to get graduate students and<br>other students working in these kind of<br>environments and the students I think<br>that have had the opportunity to be up<br>there have experienced uh booster and<br>been able to see uh some of those things<br>those physical processes firsthand and<br>it really if it wasn't for this team of<br>people uh I don't think we would have<br>got all of that work<br>done we've put wither stations up much<br>like the ones that I have put up<br>elsewhere uh on the glacier and next to<br>the glacier allowing us then to work out<br>how much melt is occurring back to<br>turbulence measurements which I did for<br>my PhD uh and help us resolve some of<br>these uh complexities in the modeling<br>space really working then on the energy<br>balance the atmospheric controls on<br>Mount and the large scale atmospheric<br>forcing and the connections to the<br>glacier a similar framework that we were<br>using on<br>Kilimanjaro and from that I think we<br>really have established a bit of a<br>benchmark for Brewster uh we I haven't<br>got time to kind of go through all of<br>the work that we have done but we really<br>I think have produced a volume of work<br>that has allowed us to advance our<br>understanding about how brewst is<br>behaving and how glaciers in the<br>southern hemisphere are<br>behaving<br>uh I think the key contributions really<br>have been to uh characterize some of<br>those energy and mass exchanges directly<br>some so going from those simple<br>parameterizations to explicitly<br>resolving<br>them and that's really helped reduce<br>modeling uncertainty for us and then<br>allowed us to make those contributions<br>uh to the global Community about how to<br>model some of those things they've also<br>those observations have provided uh a<br>lot of information for the validation<br>and calibration for remote sensing<br>observations it's allowed us to dig into<br>some of those techniques about how you<br>downscale from large scale atmospheric<br>circulation to the local scale using<br>different<br>methods and it's spawned a whole other<br>area of Interest around how some of<br>these extreme weather events which have<br>uh started to impact us<br>all uh how those events are contribued<br>to Big snowfall events big snow melt<br>events and uh a number of my students<br>have targeted atmospheric Rivers<br>specifically to try and characterize uh<br>what is controlling the varability of<br>these<br>glaciers just to finish on a little note<br>about uh one of the more simple<br>observations we used an energy mass<br>balance model to reconstruct what<br>Brewster has been doing over the last 40<br>years so from 198 5 through to the<br>present and on the Y AIS here we've got<br>annual mass balance and we've got<br>cumulative mass balance here and so if<br>you're in the blue the glacier is<br>growing in that year and if you're in<br>the red the glacier is shrinking over<br>that time and you can see that since<br>about the mid two around 2006 78 things<br>changed and we've seen a significant<br>decline uh in in<br>Brewster Glacier and the glaciers more<br>broadly across the southern albs so<br>we're losing three times as much mass<br>since that time than we were previously<br>so we've gone from about half a meter or<br>0.4 M of lowering of ice to about 1.2 in<br>that<br>time and if we look at it as a<br>cumulative loss that's about 30 m since<br>the<br>1980s if you think of the diving board<br>down at moan and you go to the top<br>that's three of those in height and<br>loss so they are rapidly<br>retreating and just to put a visual<br>marker on that here's Brewster in 1983<br>this animation or these images have come<br>from the EOS program which Gregor marara<br>who is here and Andrew Lorry have been<br>responsible for overseeing and more<br>recently that's bruer in the mid 80s<br>there's<br>1997<br>2006<br>2016<br>2022 and then in March this year you can<br>really see how much ice has disappeared<br>and these areas in the upper part of the<br>glacier which you'd expect might be<br>holding on or hanging on are definitely<br>just breaking up there is no<br>accumulation Zone uh I think anymore in<br>the southern elves and so when I go back<br>to this global<br>uh scale plot which is being produced by<br>colleagues like be marzon using globally<br>gritted data uh and I look at those<br>different emission scenarios and their<br>projections for glaciers in New Zealand<br>and this is indicating that if we get<br>our act together we can prevent that<br>glacial loss perhaps restrict it to<br>about<br>40% uh but if it was business as usual<br>it would be 80 my gut feeling at this<br>point based on what our observations are<br>at booster is I don't think the emission<br>scenario will make a difference I think<br>uh the pathway is uh Retreat from here I<br>think they're so out of equilibrium uh<br>that they will continue to disappear we<br>may still have pockets at the highest<br>elevations and places like Mount Cook<br>but a lot of our other glaciers will be<br>gone by the end of the<br>century what are we still struggling to<br>have a handle on precipitation we still<br>don't really understand how to measure<br>it properly and if you're in the<br>modeling game for glaciers it's a real<br>pain uh but luckily we've got former<br>postgraduate students from atago Peter<br>Gibson and Jon o Conway working on those<br>problems have been recently funded uh<br>and have come up with some pretty clever<br>ways to address some of those things<br>machine learning uh artificial int<br>intelligence to try and improve how we<br>understand our Mountain climate so I'm<br>really encouraged uh that that next<br>generation of climate scientists are<br>going to solve some of those problems<br>for us so I will end there and uh and<br>say that over the last 50 years or my<br>lifetime I think we have developed a<br>much greater understanding of the<br>impacts of global warming on our<br>cryosphere we now really know that the<br>ice sheets are contributing to sea level<br>rise they are changing Greenland and<br>Antarctica have<br>awoken uh The Retreat of mountain<br>glaciers has has<br>accelerated uh and many of our mid<br>latitude and tropical Glaciers are<br>expected to vanish this Century I<br>haven't had time to talk about sea ice<br>today um but we're seeing drastic<br>changes in sea ice and some of the other<br>parts of the cryosphere<br>so change is a foot but I think the<br>Benchmark measurements that we've made<br>on Brewster have been useful and uh and<br>have provided a really good framework to<br>do some of this work in New Zealand and<br>I am hopeful that it's also provided a<br>platform for that next generation of<br>climate scientists that I'm confident<br>will solve some of these problems for us<br>or at least allow us<br>to understand um how we might go<br>about<br>reviewing<br>disentangling and uh and and to sort of<br>establish a better understanding of what<br>our future<br>holds and my last little slide is this<br>it's not all doom and gloom uh I still<br>think these places have uh Great Value<br>and uh and can still be enjoyed and uh<br>and I will endeavor to continue doing<br>that with my family and I think we all<br>should uh they will be changing uh but<br>there's still lots of fun to be had up<br>there and I'll end with<br>that<br>so it's my great pleasure as the proce<br>chancellor of humanities which is the<br>division uh that Nicholas and the school<br>of geography happen to sit in we can<br>have a discussion later about why that<br>is there are many in this room who have<br>views on that but nevertheless for<br>tonight it means I have the pleasure of<br>um congratulating you Nicholas and to<br>give you a vote of thanks and confidence<br>on behalf of the University um I think<br>that was a Stella lecture don't you um<br>and I think what beautifully presented<br>is is how important research is and that<br>it really matters and that um Nicholas's<br>career is a story of how researchers<br>don't just solve problems but they<br>identify problems and questions that<br>need further solving and lovely that you<br>ended with exactly that here are the<br>things that we've discovered need to be<br>researched even further and you showed<br>us that um research is complex that it's<br>detailed and that it takes years um of<br>commitment so Bravo to you for that<br>there were two things in particular um<br>that as I watched you in Flight um I was<br>reflecting on and one is that um know<br>three things<br>actually uh that research and some of<br>the best research is a DI dialog it's a<br>dialogue between our personal stories<br>and our own interests and questions and<br>knowledge and ideas and again um<br>Nicholas started and ended with that the<br>the things that make him who he is and<br>his family and his own personal<br>experiences are what have motivated his<br>research and so I want to say thank you<br>for being true to who you are and uh for<br>exploring that in your research um<br>secondly great<br>research depends on being communic ated<br>really well it's one thing to sit in<br>your lab or in your office or if you're<br>lucky to be like Nicholas on an amazing<br>glacia somewhere but if you can't<br>explain that and tell the rest of us why<br>it's important um it's a bit of a<br>shortcoming and tonight Nicholas<br>demonstrated I think with real class<br>that he communicates his research<br>exceptionally well um I go to quite a<br>few<br>ipls this one had 96 slides in it that<br>is definitely a record of all the uh IPS<br>I've seen and yet I don't think any of<br>us thought when is this finishing it was<br>just beautifully crafted um and so much<br>uh information in the UT dovetail<br>beautifully between personal stories<br>lovely to see Susie appearing in there<br>and also some very technical information<br>and you took us with you so Bravo for<br>that and then thirdly for me um I think<br>the other important thing that you<br>emphasize for us is that research um and<br>knowledge are not static and that they<br>are the subject of theory and change<br>and a dialogue and that um you've shown<br>us that theories on glaciology<br>meteorology climatology are needing<br>constant research and so um in a sense<br>you gave a great plug for the role of<br>universities and the role of research<br>institutes We Can't Stop we have to keep<br>going and I wish uh that there were<br>several politicians in the room tonight<br>to be reminded of just how important<br>funding research in this country really<br>is so Nicholas um I want to pass on to<br>to you some well wishers from Ian who is<br>the head of geography here and<br>unfortunately couldn't be with us<br>tonight and he passes on congratulations<br>and I want to say to you on behalf of<br>all of us<br>congratulations Nicholas Cen I have<br>somewhere here a we her from us which is<br>a um a little sign of appreciation to<br>you but also a marker of what is in<br>historic night<br>congratulations</p></main><footer style="margin-top: 2rem; background: #0001; padding: 2rem; text-align: center;"><p>We Are The University</p><ul style="list-style-type: none; padding: 0;
