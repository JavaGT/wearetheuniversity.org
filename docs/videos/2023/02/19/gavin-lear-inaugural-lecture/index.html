Warren Gavin koi<br>Sebastian<br>Sebastian<br>koi Sebastian<br>mahi<br>kojaya to<br>Manicure<br>welcome all welcome colleagues welcome<br>friends and family welcome Sebastian and<br>especially welcome Gavin my name's J.R<br>Roland and I'm the deputy dean of<br>science it's my privilege to be here<br>today to host Gavin in his inaugural<br>professorial address on behalf of John<br>hosking the dean of science who cannot<br>be here tonight<br>and I've had the pleasure over the last<br>few days of reading through Gavin's<br>Stellar professorial application and<br>it's an absolute joy to be doing that<br>um Gavin you've got a superb track<br>record across teaching research and<br>service and I'm going to touch on a<br>couple of those and I just want to start<br>by going over your academic pedigree<br>which derives from the UK you did your<br>BSC honors and environmental biology<br>from the University of Nottingham he had<br>a PhD in environmental biotechnology<br>from Oxford then you augmented that with<br>several postdocs one in Manchester and a<br>couple here at the University of<br>Auckland<br>in 2010 you took on a senior lecturer<br>role at Lincoln<br>and then you jumped up here back to<br>where you've done your postdocs in 2012<br>and you've steadily been building your<br>career<br>and it has been an absolutely Stellar<br>career you're focused on microbiology<br>microbial sorry<br>microbial ecology and bioremediation and<br>I'm very interested in those because of<br>the context in which we find ourselves<br>in in the world today you're at the<br>absolute Cutting Edge you're highly<br>productive and impactful you've got at<br>the time of the professorial application<br>you had 91 articles and a suite of<br>additional outputs including two book<br>chapters which serve as textbooks for<br>people studying in the area uh also book<br>chapters and major technical reports<br>Devin you've published in top ranked<br>journals including microbiome and nature<br>ecology and evolution<br>amongst others and I think it's amazing<br>really when you look at your traditional<br>academic metrics you've got in h index<br>of over 40. it's outstanding you've got<br>more than 4 000 citations not all of<br>them bad most of them good and you've<br>got 18 articles identified as high sites<br>by Thompson Reuters and I think that's<br>absolutely outstanding it's clear that<br>by those traditional academic publishing<br>metrics you're a star and you've got a<br>stellar International reputation and<br>that's evidenced in the invitations you<br>get to workshops and to give talks and<br>to collaborations at International<br>levels<br>um your works of increasing relevance<br>and as I said it's Cutting Edge and<br>that's demonstrated by the uptake of<br>your work and policy those invited talks<br>and also your success in winning more<br>than 17 million dollars in research<br>funding<br>um in relation to your work and that<br>includes several prestigious grants<br>Marsden MB Endeavor and you've also had<br>theme leadership on National Science<br>challenge in terms of the biological<br>Heritage program so you've had an<br>absolutely exceptional contribution to<br>science generation in this country and<br>it's had relevance internationally<br>I'd also want to note that you're<br>generous to your discipline you hold the<br>vice president role for the New Zealand<br>microbiology society and you take a<br>proactive approach to drawing<br>International experts to New Zealand in<br>the worlds to be largest microbial<br>ecology conference which has been put<br>off because of covert so it's delayed<br>but that is an exceptional achievement<br>on your part and that's good not just<br>for the discipline that's good for the<br>University of Auckland and it's good for<br>the context of what you're doing within<br>New Zealand and in terms of Auckland be<br>very grateful to that conference coming<br>here<br>I do want to comment on your teaching<br>because here you really excel in reading<br>your professorial application and the<br>various endorsements of that application<br>you have a portfolio of contributions<br>that demonstrate your commitment to<br>reflective and Innovative practice and<br>that's demonstrated in your ability to<br>turn around courses that have been<br>challenging for students in terms of<br>their performance and their enjoyment of<br>those courses and really turn them<br>around and that's through a really well<br>considered redesign with a strong focus<br>on student and teacher engagement and<br>that ability to listen to the students<br>so I really want to thank you for that I<br>think in reading through your history<br>and your contributions one of the<br>absolute standout highlights for me is<br>your contribution to the development of<br>early career researchers and teachers<br>from doctoral students through the<br>postdocs and early career researchers<br>and even high school students it's<br>really an exceptional record of<br>contribution and commitment and and I I<br>would say service Beyond self you've<br>supervised to completion I presume by<br>now more than 13 phds 12 subdoctoral<br>students and in so doing you've mentored<br>PhD students in manuscript and grant<br>writing you're always thinking of that<br>broader picture of the people you're<br>working with but I guess the amazing<br>service and Leadership role that you've<br>occupied which I think transcends many<br>service records that I read is local<br>it's right here and it's right in the<br>school of biological sciences and it's<br>that contribution as a PhD advisor for<br>SBS you've mentored more than 200 PhD<br>students and their supervisors which I<br>think is exceptional and and given the<br>size of SBS and this load the role's<br>more than equivalent to what you would<br>normally see in a faculty level<br>appointment of some note and you've<br>provided outstanding leadership in this<br>capacity and particularly over the last<br>two and a half years of covert so I<br>really want to thank you for that at a<br>time of pressing ecological and societal<br>need I think you Gavin have been making<br>a concerted difference in your<br>professorial application you were asked<br>to list your most influential works and<br>articulate your uh contribution and<br>impact and I recommend that you share<br>that narrative with other aspiring<br>professors because you've painted a<br>picture of a consummate and strategic<br>scientist who understands how to work<br>collaboratively with communities of<br>interest funders and colleagues<br>including doctoral students to advance<br>science with considerable academic and<br>societal benefit and I want to<br>congratulate you on that I think you're<br>an absolute model<br>today I'm actually an outstanding step<br>in your academic career one I'm told of<br>two major life events for you over the<br>last few days on behalf of the faculty<br>of science I'd first like to acknowledge<br>and congratulate you on your recent<br>marriage to Sebastian may you have long<br>and happy lives together and second I'd<br>like to offer my congratulations to you<br>on behalf of John hosking and the entire<br>faculty of science on your promotion to<br>professor and a warm welcome to deliver<br>your inaugural professorial lecture<br>soon<br>it's just well giving giving it away<br>giving it away just gonna jump back into<br>that so it'll help me with the timings<br>slightly nervous now who was that person<br>she was talking about okay really nice<br>to see so many um familiar faces they're<br>really nice to see lots of people also<br>from outside the University of Auckland<br>here as well if you haven't been to one<br>of these things before don't worry the<br>idea is not that I try to Blind you with<br>microbiology rather it's to take you<br>through I guess a bit of a journey let's<br>try and explain how I got to this quite<br>privileged position of being able to<br>call myself Professor I should probably<br>say that I'm struggling to get to terms<br>with calling myself Professor Leah that<br>would be a lie I think it sounds<br>fantastic<br>almost over there with King Lear which<br>is what I like to get my new students to<br>form<br>so everyone else I know that my academic<br>colleagues don't really want to Be Wild<br>by my microbiology either you're mainly<br>hair I know to let that bear free beer<br>and wine go to your heads and to judge<br>photos of Gavin as his younger self so<br>let's get on with this<br>well I thought You're gonna laugh oh<br>can you tell which one's me<br>okay a few take-home messages just with<br>these next ones to all my hilarious<br>colleagues so at this time of year take<br>the piss out of me for being very tanned<br>and suggesting that I haven't been to<br>work since before Christmas no I've<br>affected my quick tanning Tech pick from<br>a very young age as you can see from<br>this cremated baby here uh very<br>helpfully labeled Gavin's first suntan<br>on the back I'm often asked if I've<br>always had curly hair actually no I tell<br>people I used to have straight blonde<br>hair people roll their eyes they don't<br>seem to believe you can stop rolling<br>your eyes that is me on the right<br>far right that's a monkey<br>and I've not always been quite as Slim<br>as I am today apparently someone someone<br>used to enjoy his biscuits<br>okay a few more photos sent of me with<br>my family<br>um here I am with my mum and my older<br>brother Aaron who is my dad and my<br>younger sister Kelsey there I'll show<br>you another picture of my mum you can<br>see it's from my mum's side of the<br>family that I've got my curly hair<br>people tell me I probably look most like<br>my granddad I personally can't see the<br>resemblance but I'll show you a picture<br>of him as Youth and you can make up your<br>own minds<br>nothing nothing chalk and cheese<br>okay some of my efforts to recreate my<br>granddad's hair in later life and not<br>quite so successful<br>anyway<br>what I'm going to do now is just take<br>you through some of my<br>um early years so I was born in the<br>English Midlands in a place called<br>Leicester normally when I tell kiwis I'm<br>from Leicester I get a blank look back<br>so then I say yeah it's close to<br>Birmingham and they love the heads just<br>kind of weird because I've never<br>actually been to Birmingham I think no<br>one needs to go to Birmingham a bit like<br>no one really needs to go to Leicester<br>in my opinion to give you a bit of an<br>idea as to um how little you need to<br>visit my hometown of Leicester I put<br>together a bit of a list of leicester's<br>most famous people and it's a bit of a<br>side bunch I have to say I didn't even<br>have to change it too much from what was<br>in Wikipedia to get this idea across<br>we're going to come back to this later<br>so just for contacts to the east of<br>Leicester this is where I grew up<br>a little bit further you it's a town<br>I've got the right a little bit further<br>into town<br>um with a home at someone very famous<br>you'll have heard of him you recognize<br>this picture Joseph Mac he's famous all<br>over the world and last a week had so<br>little about him that we smashed his<br>house down and built a multi-story car<br>park in the 1960s<br>in a weird sort of way that's kind of<br>fitting because the person that's most<br>associated with Leicester now we<br>actually forgot where he was buried for<br>about 200 years we actually buried King<br>Richard III's body under a nasty<br>Council car park<br>apparently his body was hard to find<br>it's hard to relocate even though as it<br>turns out that the Big R on the car park<br>marking in the spots<br>okay we dug him up we didn't really give<br>him any privacy he's now kind of on<br>display for people to see which seems a<br>bit mean but the car park has got<br>scheduled Monument status<br>okay Ashley King Richard he wasn't born<br>in Leicester it's just where he got his<br>head smashed in<br>um the night before that happened he did<br>stay to put in Leicester called the the<br>I think it's an old Boar Inn and right<br>next to that was another famous person<br>from Leicester who you may not have<br>heard of and his name was Daniel Lander<br>to Daniel Lambert he was a little bit<br>sensitive as you can imagine about his<br>weight<br>to give you an idea of what the average<br>person from Leicester is like what his<br>friends did is they invited him on a<br>road trip a carriage trip to a<br>cockfighting event<br>they'll then put that carrot onto a big<br>wine scale jumped out to work out that<br>this guy weighed 320 kilograms and then<br>he got the title that he never wanted of<br>being the fattest man in England and<br>after which he was actually uh spent the<br>rest of his short life on display I<br>think it might have been that story that<br>stopped me eating all those biscuits as<br>a child<br>there's not meant to be a history lesson<br>but just one more for you for the latest<br>this one actually was a lady she lived<br>in Brad Pitt Park this is Lady Jane gray<br>what she famous for she was in power for<br>nine days Queen for nine days before she<br>was removed from power and had a head<br>removed from her Shoulders by a sharp ax<br>so that's where I'm from<br>I don't think there's meant to be<br>immortal to that story probably um if<br>anything is I'm very lucky to be here to<br>have escaped Leicester with my head<br>largely intact and not have been put on<br>display<br>okay so let's go back then to where I<br>grew up<br>okay so this is the house that I spent<br>all my childhood in it shocked me a<br>little bit when I see this now because I<br>think it's a bit of an assault of bricks<br>and concrete a lot of you will have been<br>to Mike Taylor's amazing inaugural talk<br>I've got a lot to live up to um here<br>Mike where micro counted his love of<br>Nature and how that developed as he grew<br>up in the beautiful area of a Hopi Beach<br>you're smart guys you probably worked<br>out already that leicester's no<br>beautiful Eastern Bay of Plenty but Mike<br>when are you giving your talk it made me<br>realize actually that in some ways we<br>have a similar kind of story just we<br>reached it from different angles okay so<br>to get our bearings here can I get this<br>mouse to work you can see where my house<br>is<br>um on that yellow yellow pen there<br>somewhere in the middle there's a school<br>where my sister went to my sister's in<br>the audience so it gives a big wave<br>Kelsey so everyone knows who you are<br>thank you very much<br>and just a little bit down here they<br>used to be before we were born a train<br>station and this tradition is train<br>station needs to take people from<br>Leicester to the coastal town of<br>skegness<br>if you've not been to skegness before<br>you've really not missed out I promise<br>you<br>no seaside resort that sells itself is<br>bracing it's really worth going to<br>okay why am I telling you this why is it<br>important so in the late 1960s<br>this railway station was taken down and<br>so were those lines as well and what<br>that meant was before I was born is that<br>swathe of land you can see the green<br>tree so it went up for sale behind our<br>house<br>no one wanted to buy that land because<br>it was Steep and I understand it's quite<br>cheap but there's really nothing that<br>you could do with it and my family had<br>the foresight at the time to buy the<br>little parcel gland behind my house but<br>also all the adjacent ones as well it's<br>really hard to get across how important<br>this was to me and my brother growing up<br>but we had our own forest to grow in in<br>this Urban Jungle so we spent huge<br>amounts of time in that little strip of<br>forest at the back of our house<br>and I think that's where I started to<br>develop my my love of biology not<br>microbiology I wasn't interested in<br>microbes as a child no sane child would<br>dream of becoming a microbiologist<br>my main interest was probably in birds<br>so I used to build bird boxes bat boxes<br>and things for my for my wood as you can<br>see here<br>um seeing what kind of species that I<br>could I could find in my garden I think<br>maybe I had some ideas at one stage of<br>maybe putting together some kind of bird<br>ID book and it never really took off<br>maybe the pictures weren't quite good<br>enough I'm not sure if I'm honest I<br>probably couldn't draw any better these<br>days but that's what I did<br>so I had another biology in school and<br>also geography as well and some of you<br>in the audience already know that where<br>I went to school I actually went to the<br>same school as this guy on the bottom<br>left so that's not me that's a young<br>David Attenborough so we actually went<br>to school in the same biology classroom<br>not at the same time yeah I do look good<br>for my age thanks for noticing but not<br>that good but we did go to the yeah we<br>both learned biology in the same<br>classroom so he wasn't born in Leicester<br>he moved to Leicester at the age of five<br>because his dad was a principal of what<br>is now Leicester University<br>the Leicester University<br>is on the on the campus of Leicester<br>University is where my school was the<br>Lesser University it's kind of famous<br>now for two things one is identifying<br>that body of King Richard III and the<br>other is it's a birthplace of DNA thing<br>printing so it's the birthplace of that<br>place where we revolutionized forensic<br>biology and actually most areas of<br>biology that we work on today as well so<br>most of the techniques used in my early<br>career use DNA fingerprinting using<br>techniques that were essentially<br>designed in a lab just across the road<br>from where I was still at school which<br>is quite cool I think<br>okay so that was me at school I didn't<br>actually enjoy the last years of my<br>schooling it was made hard by the fact<br>that I got bacterial meningitis close to<br>my exams you would think of that state<br>I'd work out that Michael Bolton can<br>sometimes suck but now I stayed with<br>that as a career and the main reason is<br>when I got to Nottingham University I<br>had a really fantastic<br>um honest supervisor whose name was<br>Helen West she was a microbiologist<br>that's how that inspired me in<br>microbiology<br>things note about<br>um I guess Helen but lots of other<br>people that I talk about today that I<br>tend to mainly not always of course<br>mainly from quite strong friendships<br>with women and most are mental<br>throughout my career have been female as<br>well I think that's really important we<br>often talk about diversity<br>representation we often think of those<br>things as being for the important<br>important for people belong to those<br>diversity groups it is but it's actually<br>more important more wides has more<br>widespread importance as well the reason<br>I'm here today as a professor is because<br>I have a string of fantastic female<br>mentors that have talked me through my<br>career and you'll see examples of these<br>coming through my talk later on as well<br>so I love Notting Nottingham University<br>I did really well and as a result of<br>that I managed to get into Oxford<br>and at Oxford I undertook a PhD on using<br>electrokinetics and bio augmentation<br>to optimize remediation of<br>pentachlorophenyl contaminated soil I<br>also had some time Spare Time clearly to<br>do some other things as well like<br>straighten my hair<br>don't worry it was just a phase okay<br>let's break down what my PhD was about<br>then using electrokinetics and bio<br>augmentation to optimize the remediation<br>of a pentachlorophenol contaminated cell<br>so let's start off with what is<br>pentachlorophenol<br>so this substance spent all that I<br>worked with it's a bio site so it's very<br>good at killing fungi Woodruff fungus<br>that it's used in the forestry industry<br>and the wood industry<br>it's a pen chlorophenol it's good at<br>killing fungi I could probably go with<br>some of it at the moment in a bathroom<br>but actually it's quite good at harming<br>us as well it's damaging to our liver<br>our kidneys it has carcinogenic<br>properties and if we spill a lot of it<br>on our skin it can also be fatal as well<br>you can see from the structure of this<br>pant chlorophenol it's a chlorinated<br>aromatic ring and what that means is<br>it's really hard for microorganisms to<br>degrade it so even though pent<br>chlorophenol its use is banned in many<br>countries now around the world there's a<br>lot of Legacy contaminated sites because<br>this stuff just doesn't go away on its<br>own<br>so let's think about what happens if we<br>have some soil maybe underneath the<br>building that's contaminated with a<br>nasty contaminant maybe like<br>pentachlorophenol<br>if you want to clean up that saw one<br>thing you could do is maybe be fun knock<br>the building down and then excavate that<br>Soul it's fun but expensive<br>another option<br>is<br>endochlorophenol at a neutral insolent<br>neutral pH as a slightly negative charge<br>so if I put two huge electrodes either<br>side of my building and switch on the<br>current my negatively charged will<br>pollutant will move towards the<br>positively charged anode so you can<br>migrate that pollutant through the soil<br>which way you can collect it and clean<br>that soil<br>another thing you can do even though<br>pent chlorophenol is pretty nasty is you<br>can actually find some microorganisms<br>that can degrade it so you could inject<br>those into the soil and try and get them<br>to degrade the pants chlorophenol for<br>you yeah so injector pentachlorophenol<br>degrading bacteria into the soil and<br>hopefully they'll do a good job<br>integrating that and the chlorophenol<br>but from experience what we know is not<br>all of that pollutant will be degraded<br>there's always going to be some of that<br>pollutant for example that's held in<br>pores that are too small for those<br>bacteria to interact with or maybe bound<br>to Clay particles in a way that they<br>okay so my bright idea as a PhD student<br>was<br>how about should we put some of these<br>bacteria and it's all getting to degrade<br>most of the pentachlorophenol then<br>instead of frying the soil with lots of<br>electricity just apply a little amount<br>just a small enough amount to get the<br>pollutant to move out of the pores so<br>that the rest of it can be degraded<br>sound like a good idea<br>of course it does that's my idea and<br>what could fail I was an amazing Oxford<br>student<br>at what I didn't realize whoops at the<br>time when I started a PhD is that<br>sounds like a bit of a bug to say I was<br>an overachiever at exams but I was<br>useless in the lab and I had no<br>realization that I had no common sense<br>until I started my PhD<br>the first thing that I had to do as a<br>PhD student was to try and dissolve some<br>of this and chlorophenol<br>um into solution it doesn't dissolve in<br>water so I tried to dissolve it in a<br>range of different solvents I tried for<br>ages and I couldn't get it to work my<br>PhD supervisor he got exasperated and<br>dragged me into his office and told me<br>to bring the pentachlorophenol with him<br>with me<br>um I knew that this was really dangerous<br>stuff so I've been working really<br>carefully with it and so I was kind of<br>surprised when in the in the office he<br>took the lid off of this plant<br>chlorophenol and looked inside I was<br>shocked when he put his fingers in and<br>started rubbing it amongst his fingers<br>like how did I end up such a dumb<br>supervisor<br>the next thing that he did he stick his<br>hand inside the container and whipped<br>out another container inside and<br>explained to me for the last three weeks<br>I've been degrading the packaging<br>material three weeks<br>it didn't get any better from there<br>the next thing that I had to do was to<br>start working with radioactive forms of<br>this pentachlorophenol<br>so these radioacts when I was working<br>with radioactive material what I was<br>told is I needed to work on a big sheet<br>of paper so that if I spilled it I could<br>wrap it all up and throw it somewhere<br>safe<br>makes good sense apart from his<br>microbiologists we're always really<br>worried about keeping things sterile so<br>I was working in the fume hood and I was<br>weighing out my Radioactive<br>pentachlorophenol on a nice expensive<br>balance trying to keep everything<br>sterile of course at some stage I<br>knocked the ethanol over which soaked<br>all the way across the paper and because<br>I was trying to keep everything sterile<br>all the time the Benson burn the next me<br>lit the paper yeah so then it's<br>basically sterilized my entire<br>experiment<br>irreversely sterilize the balance I was<br>working with and set fire to the inside<br>of the fume head<br>in my defense it wasn't my chloroform in<br>the fume head that set light I'd used my<br>chloroform the week before storing it<br>improperly in a fridge melting the<br>entire contents of it and dissolving<br>through the job<br>foreign<br>at this stage my supervisor thought<br>Gavin might need a little bit more<br>training working with radioactive waste<br>so what he did was he decided that I<br>needed to go to work in another lab in a<br>city up North Lancaster to get a little<br>bit more training which sounded great<br>difficulty if they didn't have the<br>radioactive material that I needed to<br>work with so my supervisor said don't<br>worry just take it with you but be<br>discreet about it<br>so I got on the train with my<br>radioactive waste<br>I got on public transport I wasn't<br>stupid I didn't leave the danger signs<br>on the outside of the box I put them all<br>inside and had a very uneventful Journey<br>with this radioactive material on my lap<br>that was until I arrived at my instinct<br>station which I think was Manchester<br>Piccadilly I'm not sure where there was<br>a big football match occurring so it's<br>loads of supporters everywhere loads of<br>police so the moment I stepped off that<br>train the police asked me what was in<br>the box<br>I don't remember how I talked to the<br>police after that and how I got out of<br>bed I think they just must have felt in<br>the end sorry for me all of that I was<br>too geeky to be a threat so they did let<br>me on my way in the end of my illegal<br>cargo<br>obviously I made my supervisor feel very<br>very guilty about this to such an extent<br>that the next time I had to travel<br>somewhere very far he presented me with<br>a ticket for the travel and the honest<br>truth is that's still the only time in<br>my life that I've traveled first class<br>to me this all makes perfect sense I've<br>reminded you already that I worked I I<br>studied in the same biology classroom as<br>David Attenborough and some clearly some<br>of his biological actors and Excellence<br>had rubbed up on me<br>in Oxford the little lab that I worked<br>in there was a very famous person that<br>worked there before me as well on his<br>master's project and it was this guy<br>yeah so I don't think that I had much<br>hope from the start<br>okay so I had a bit of a slow start to<br>my PhD but in the end as I tell people<br>my particularly my students far more<br>often than I really should I managed to<br>complete my PhD in two and a half years<br>and I use the remaining time to write<br>some papers which continue to be some of<br>the most successful in my career<br>what I managed to find in the end was<br>that sorry it's a little bit hard to use<br>the mouse here but basically when I<br>applied my special treatment of adding<br>Benz chlorophy and chlorophenol<br>degrading bacteria and electrocuting the<br>soil the end result was that I had able<br>to reduce the residual amount of pence<br>chlorophenol in that soil by half which<br>was a really great achievement to make<br>sure that our soils remain clean of<br>nasty contaminants like<br>pentachlorophenol<br>I also went on to show that that<br>traditional technique of just frying the<br>soil with electrokinetics was really<br>harmful it didn't just take the pollute<br>out of the soil it took the nutrients<br>out of it as well and it fried the<br>bacteria they were getting a really good<br>electric shock so my technique uh it<br>looked like not only successful but it's<br>a more sustainable technique for<br>long-term remediation of contaminated<br>land<br>on the back of this success I moved to<br>Manchester University where I gained I<br>worked with nuclear waste this time<br>cleaning up soil contaminated with waste<br>uh mainly from sites in the UK and the<br>US there's kind of sites where they tell<br>you they've locked it up for Millennia<br>and it's going to be really safe just to<br>leak out a few years later and I also<br>worked on trying to clean up a<br>contaminated aquifer sediments as well<br>that have been contaminated with arsenic<br>so arsenic pollution content is still a<br>problem for millions of people all<br>around the globe particularly in West<br>bun Bengal but other places as well too<br>much arsenic and groundwater if it's<br>consumed leads to keratosis as you can<br>see on that person's hands in the<br>background and also some other more<br>grisly complaints as well which are<br>perhaps just not quite as visible<br>I'll gloss over this period a little bit<br>but it was fun I was quite productive<br>and at that stage I managed to secure<br>myself a post-op position at the<br>University of Auckland<br>so Jillian I can still remember having<br>that interview with you on the phone I<br>think I presented well but I was a<br>little bit unsure because mainly what<br>Julian did throughout the whole<br>interview is left<br>um I I form the opinion that Jillian's a<br>lot of fun maybe a little bit crazy in a<br>good way as well but Jillian my opinion<br>hasn't changed since<br>um and here goes uh working with my next<br>amazing female Mentor I always felt like<br>Jillian and I had something in common<br>quite intangible I can't tell what it is<br>Jillian had managed to get lots of money<br>together to work on monitoring<br>um the health of fresh waters<br>so freshwater in New Zealand continues<br>to be under threat from increasing<br>urbanization and agricultural<br>intensification<br>even in clean green New Zealand it's<br>really easy to forget that over 90 of<br>our wetlands have been drained about<br>three quarters of our freshwater fish<br>are either threatened or at risk of<br>extension if you eat what if you eat<br>white bait you're probably consuming<br>them perhaps without realizing it and<br>sometimes we can look at strings for<br>example and because there's not a<br>selective oil on it although there's not<br>a load of rubbish we can see we think<br>it's clean but most pollution is<br>invisible<br>so the vast majority of strains in New<br>Zealand going through Urban or rural<br>environments actually have at least one<br>contaminant that is over recommended<br>levels<br>so what we wanted to do was to try and<br>understand how we could better monitor<br>the changing health of our streams so<br>that we could engage the public more<br>because it's really hard to tell people<br>the need to look after their streams<br>more if they don't know how the current<br>health what the current health status is<br>so let's think about how we generally<br>monitor the health of our streams and it<br>tends to be by biological monitoring if<br>you want to monitor the health of a<br>stream what you tend to do is you go<br>into a stream and you kick the crap out<br>of it and you get a big net and you<br>scoop up all of those mangled insects<br>and then you give them to someone<br>probably a poor PhD student like this<br>one to sort through and identify so<br>she's trying to smile for the camera I<br>think she probably hates her life<br>probably hates our supervisor even more<br>once you've worked through what all of<br>those insects are they're given a score<br>so insects that don't tolerate pollution<br>very well like cut a slime mayfly are<br>given a high school first to ten those<br>that will just live kind of anywhere<br>kind of you know worm-like organisms<br>that you'd find in any old sewer line<br>Channel they're given a low score nearer<br>to zero with all of this information we<br>then do some maths Wizardry on it and we<br>can score the health of a stream from<br>being either close to 200 in really good<br>health to zero completely buggered<br>so our idea at this stage was okay you<br>can do that with insects what about<br>doing it with bacteria because if we<br>take a closer look at the bacterial<br>communities in our streams what we find<br>is a whole diversity of life and you can<br>imagine<br>that in this slimy layers that coat our<br>rocks the kind of layers that we slip<br>over in streams more often than we'd<br>like to there are going to be lots of<br>bacteria presence some which are very<br>resistant to pollution and will be found<br>in most streams other which are<br>intolerant Evolution so if we see them<br>disappearing from the stream that's an<br>indication that the health of those<br>streams is declining<br>so we decided to come up with our own<br>actual Community index of stream health<br>so we sampled a range of different<br>strengths from beautiful Forest line<br>streams in the waitakere's through to<br>concrete line channels in the last<br>beautiful pakuranga and we characterized<br>the insects or present in these sites<br>to undertake our traditional analysis of<br>stream Health but at the same time we<br>sampled microbial DNA so the DNA<br>bacteria and protozoa to see if we find<br>different communities present in clean<br>versus impacted streams we also did this<br>at sites undergoing remediation for<br>example sites impacted by acid mind<br>drainage that then had lime added to<br>raise the ph and we could see that the<br>bacterial Community started to recover<br>to something that looked more like that<br>of a healthy stream<br>so I gave a talk on some of these<br>preliminary results back in 2009 in<br>whangarei to an audience that included<br>lots and lots of council researchers<br>from around the country<br>and on the back of if I say myself what<br>was quite a strong presentation and on<br>the back of a lot of hard work also from<br>Jillian we managed to engage one of our<br>colleagues who worked with Council<br>Martin Neal<br>um and he went around the room and he<br>managed to secure a hundred thousand<br>dollars on that same night for us to do<br>some research in this area and the<br>commitment to provide actually thousands<br>of samples for us which was pretty<br>amazing<br>so from across the country Council<br>workers started to provide us with DNA<br>from streams so that we could see what<br>bacteria were present at the same time<br>they were characterizing the chemistry<br>of these streams to see what nutrients<br>of pollutants were in them<br>and also undertaking analysis of those<br>macroinvertebrate communities to score<br>the health of those streams using those<br>traditional measures as well<br>so what we did with our bacterial DNA<br>data it's we I'm not going to go through<br>the details but we worked some of our<br>magic did some of this math modeling if<br>you like to develop our own approach to<br>score the health of streams by looking<br>at bacterial DNA and this is the kind of<br>result that we got we could go into a<br>stream<br>sample the DNA with within that stream<br>and looking at that score the health of<br>that stream on a scale from either 0 to<br>200 and as you can see our results from<br>our bacterial analysis analysis kind of<br>makes sense our native streams to the<br>right get higher scores than our Urban<br>streams to the left<br>yeah so this is actually one of the<br>first times at bacterial Community data<br>that's used in this way on such a big<br>scale to start to try and explore the<br>okay we also uh compared our results our<br>bacterial Community data scores to the<br>standard macro invertebrate scores as<br>well and you can see there's a fairly<br>good level of correlation there so what<br>our bacterial data was telling us was<br>comparable to the standard<br>macroinvertebrate scores at the time as<br>well a lot of this work was done with<br>the help of Kelvin and I can't see you<br>in the audience here as well but just<br>acknowledging thank you Kelvin cobin's<br>work in this<br>okay so this was really exciting we<br>started to develop for the first time<br>some of these new indicators of<br>microbial Health uh stream Health by<br>looking at microbial DNA<br>but what I also realized at the time is<br>we had this amazing big data site<br>because lots of our collaborators even<br>overseas were surprised by how quickly<br>we'd managed to get so much DNA data<br>from streams across New Zealand so we<br>started thinking maybe we could actually<br>look at some other things associated<br>with this data such as some of the<br>patterns that govern the distribution of<br>Life on our planet<br>okay so let's look at one example an<br>example of one of these very common<br>patterns here what we see using birds as<br>an example is an increase in species<br>richness of birds about tenfold As you<br>move from the poles to the equator you<br>guys know this happens already if you go<br>to the equation you see a huge diversity<br>of bloodlife and the poles you might<br>just see a few hungry seagulls yeah so<br>it's a very common Trend but of course<br>what we wanted to know is do we see the<br>same thing for microorganisms as you get<br>closer to Auckland do we see that<br>there's more species closer to the<br>Equator because this really hasn't been<br>looked before looked at before in any<br>huge way at the time<br>I couldn't have undertaken this kind of<br>work as a PhD student it would have been<br>really hard for me because at the time I<br>was using these old-school DNA<br>fingerprinting technologies that I<br>talked about before whereby for every<br>sample what I'm actually doing is<br>generating a trace like this<br>traces that look kind of similar we<br>assume that they have actual communities<br>that are more similar to each other look<br>we don't know how many species are<br>however at around this time there are<br>also some really big advances in DNA<br>sequencing so that for all of our<br>samples what we ended up doing was going<br>extracting the DNA from them<br>amplifying up the bacterial DNA and<br>using these advances in DNA sequencing<br>for every single sample<br>we could DNA sequence and identify tens<br>of thousands of bacteria for all of<br>these many hundreds of samples so we get<br>now a really good idea as we progress<br>the uh the diversity of microorganisms<br>in the system<br>okay so what did we find did we find as<br>we get closer to Auckland a greater<br>richness of species present<br>well that's exactly what we found for<br>every 100 kilometers you move north<br>across New Zealand we found that the<br>species richness of bacteria increased<br>by 20 telling us what we already know<br>that Auckland is quite a lot more<br>diverse than Christchurch yeah so we<br>found this trend in with this large data<br>set this was actually one of the first<br>times it was shown I think uh to such an<br>extent for terrestrial microbial<br>communities<br>the reason that we often think we have<br>more species closer to the Equator or<br>further to Auckland if you like it's<br>because there's more available energy<br>from sunlight and water but there are<br>other suggestions as well as to why<br>maybe we have more species close to the<br>equator I'm going to try and just take<br>you through one of these briefly<br>okay if you imagine closer to the poles<br>what you find is the<br>um summer and winter are very different<br>yeah Winters are cold and dark all the<br>time Summer's not quite so cold or<br>within the equator you have quite static<br>conditions all throughout the year you<br>don't have that big seasonal change<br>so there's an idea out there that closer<br>to the Equator because things are quite<br>subtle you don't have that seasonal<br>change organisms can specialize more<br>they get more specialized because of<br>those constant environmental conditions<br>and in doing so<br>um because they're specialized they<br>actually get trapped in a little band<br>for example close to the equator because<br>they're so specialized they can't live<br>anywhere else<br>in comparison around the parallel<br>regions organisms we think might not<br>specialize quite so much they keep<br>generalist traits because they need them<br>to survive those big summer winter<br>differences and because they keep those<br>generous traits we think that they're<br>found across a much I find across a much<br>bigger distribution<br>so take her message close to the equator<br>things get more specialized and get trap<br>looping where they are is the idea<br>so again what we want to know is okay<br>that's kind of fun but do we see the<br>same things occurring for our<br>microbial communities do we see them<br>getting more specialized and becoming<br>trapped in their distribution where<br>they're found as you get closer to the<br>Equator<br>so what we found was is that as you move<br>further north so to the right close to<br>the equator towards Auckland<br>for every 100 kilometers further north<br>you move in New Zealand the distribution<br>of your average bacteria and their<br>samples declines the distance that they<br>found not to South declines by about 30<br>kilometers this was the first time that<br>this trend was shown for microbial<br>communities so quite an exciting find<br>for us<br>so it's exciting to find this but do we<br>know that this is occurring because<br>these organisms are actually more<br>specialized there's a little bit of a<br>quirk when we're working with microbial<br>DNA<br>that when things so we think that they<br>might get more specialized close to the<br>equator further north when<br>microorganisms tend to get more<br>specialized what we tend to find is that<br>they have less genes they don't need as<br>many genes so they lose them so we then<br>look for evidence to see if we actually<br>had organisms sorry<br>our bacteria closer to the Equator<br>having less genes present showing that<br>they're more specialized<br>when we looked for that again for the<br>first time what we found is tantalizing<br>evidence that actually as we get closer<br>to the Equator<br>the average genome size of a bacteria<br>decreases so that it looks like these<br>organisms are getting more more<br>specialized as we as we move further<br>north<br>because I've published quite widely on<br>lots of aspects of space ecology but I<br>don't really think of myself as a as an<br>ecologist so I have to give lots of<br>credit to two proper spatial ecologists<br>here<br>um Hannah and Brad and also thanks to<br>Ken as well for all of your support<br>environments because I'm not very good<br>reaches a time in your career<br>um when you're working with a very<br>successful boss when you realize that<br>actually you're going to need to<br>diversify are you going to start<br>competing with them and I didn't want to<br>take Jillian on because I knew that I<br>wouldn't win so there's a stage when I<br>started to move away from working in<br>that freshwater space to working in the<br>space of looking at the microbes in in<br>soil instead so we used a similar<br>approach I had some fantastic<br>collaborators Fiona and Matthew who<br>helped me collect over short Bridge time<br>over 5 000 Soul samples from around New<br>Zealand spanning New Zealand<br>their teams are characterized these<br>souls in terms of their main characters<br>it's a pH the concentrations of<br>contaminants and so on I could have<br>never done this on my own it would have<br>taken me years it would have cost me<br>millions of dollars but they provided me<br>through their resources those samples<br>for free which meant that I had the many<br>left over to sequence that microbial DNA<br>to look for patterns there<br>okay so let's have a look to see what<br>patterns we found when we looked at the<br>on this kind of plot each one of these<br>dots represents a different bacterial<br>community and the further apart those<br>dots are the more different those<br>bacterial communities are<br>so what you can see here is that these<br>bacterial communities are separating out<br>across the gradient and then they seem<br>to be separating out across a gradient<br>of pH so back to all bacterial<br>communities are really impacted by the<br>pH of the soil<br>okay we can work a little Wizardry on<br>this as well again we constructed a<br>model we started to work out how we<br>could predict the pH of the soil by<br>looking at the microbial DNA<br>and then Compares an actual pH of the<br>soil that we measure we could actually<br>get quite a good correlation by looking<br>at the bacterial DNA you could predict<br>the pH of the soil<br>and it wasn't just the pH that we found<br>we could predict things like<br>concentration of nitrogen phosphorus or<br>here for example the macro porosity of<br>the soil the amount of pore space in the<br>soil that's sufficient for the<br>respiration of roots we managed using<br>our micro herbal DNA to predict measures<br>of macro prostate and bulk density and<br>find that there weren't too bad compared<br>to what was actually found in the soil<br>some of you might be thinking this is a<br>bit stupid I think because why don't you<br>just go and look at the pH why don't you<br>just look at the bulk dancing itself<br>it's not that hard to measure but<br>actually to do all these different<br>measurements is quite expensive whereas<br>when we look at our bacterial DNA a<br>single bacterial Community analysis can<br>be used to predict all of these<br>different things and that really was the<br>advantage in using our microbial<br>indicators of soil Health it's not<br>perfect we're still working on it but<br>this is where we managed to reach<br>a lot of the work that I've been talking<br>about so far<br>um whatever outputs of one very<br>addictive and PhD student Siri<br>I really like this photo here so this is<br>a slightly old picture now this is from<br>when Siri passed her PhD which occurred<br>during a covered lockdown if you look<br>really closely at this picture there's<br>one very very happy PhD supervisor in<br>the background Siri I have to be quite<br>honest I think through my long career<br>now at Auckland University this won't be<br>it wasn't the first and when the last<br>time that your supervisor has been<br>okay after after that we started to<br>realize is actually we could go further<br>with all this DNA that we collected<br>across the country we've been focusing<br>just on the bacteria so we've been<br>extracting the bacterial DNA from the<br>soil and look and see what bacteria were<br>present there was no reason that we had<br>to stop there we had all of this DNA<br>present that we could use to sample<br>other organisms present in the<br>environment so I can use your disgusting<br>group here as a good example as you've<br>sat in this lecture theater all of you<br>will have shed thousands of skin cells<br>into them it's pretty gross but that's<br>what happens I'm probably going to get<br>through about a kilogram of skin a year<br>the outer skin layer maybe grow through<br>a thousand skins in your lifetime so<br>don't waste money on the chemical appeal<br>what happens in our guts even worse<br>every day we probably get through about<br>a hundred billion intestinal epithelial<br>cells and shed them<br>why am I saying this what this means is<br>as your average organism goes around<br>shedding its skin wing and pooing in the<br>environment we can actually use the DNA<br>that's located in the environment and<br>shut out there to work out what<br>organisms are present not just bacteria<br>but any organisms from the DNA that<br>they're casting off so we can work out<br>what organisms are present or even more<br>organisms have just passed through by<br>looking for traces of<br>traces of their existence<br>by analyzing them DNA<br>sounds good doesn't always work<br>brilliantly so here's one example that I<br>really like a Japanese group looked at<br>Okinawa aquarium they took quite a small<br>amount of water and from that water<br>sample amazingly they could identify 95<br>of the species present in this huge tank<br>and that's amazing that's a really good<br>way to monitor biodiversity<br>slightly odd thing about this they<br>couldn't find any of their massive whale<br>shark that were located in that tank<br>because they didn't design the<br>experiment quite as well as you might<br>otherwise like<br>I got another example here of this one<br>from Australia I think this is back in<br>2012. researchers identified from about<br>60 scat samples they identified what<br>they thought was Fox DNA but it wasn't<br>it was just false positive results from<br>dog DNA because they designed their<br>experiment wrong they only managed to<br>correct this Schoolboy error work it out<br>after the government spent 50 million<br>dollars looking for foxes that didn't<br>and never have existed in Tasmania so we<br>don't want to be making those kind of<br>mistakes<br>um so what I managed to do was to secure<br>as part of a national science challenge<br>Project funding because we worked in<br>this kind of area and we put together a<br>manual to try and better assist people<br>in working with the analysis of this<br>environmental DNA so to assist<br>individuals in working with DNA from<br>bacteria fungi fish birds and so on and<br>to avoid those annoying false positive<br>and false negative results it's pretty<br>well received particularly by early<br>career researchers that hadn't worked on<br>these kind of samples in the past and we<br>use these kind of techniques ourselves<br>as well so for example Indigo has been<br>researching the incidence of Kodi die<br>back disease around the waitakere ranges<br>and particularly the impact that that<br>disease has on Cell microbial<br>communities<br>ziva's been looking at the the DNA that<br>we find in kiwi fruit orchards to work<br>out if we can use that to identify early<br>incursions of different pests and<br>pathogens and we're just starting to<br>think about how we could actually sample<br>water in different environments as an<br>early warning signal to detect avian<br>botulism<br>okay Hamilton's time not too bad<br>okay now I'm just going to get on to<br>what's taking up most of my time at the<br>moment and over the last few years and<br>that it's that is really to do with this<br>area of plastic pollution so although I<br>say myself I give quite an outstanding<br>talk on this subject uh to my colleagues<br>um a few months back and I'm going to<br>test your knowledge now so in terms of<br>these Plastics or first production first<br>started in the 1940s and he told me you<br>love this talk colleague so you can tell<br>me<br>the amount of plastic we produce each<br>year is equivalent to how the weight of<br>how many blue whales<br>it's in this ladies and gentlemen the<br>kind of colleagues I deal with on a<br>daily basis<br>so the amount of plastic that we produce<br>every year is equivalent to the weight<br>of four<br>oh I forgot myself four million blue<br>whales that's an incredibly large amount<br>it's a huge amount that we're checking<br>out into the environment each year<br>so we know that microorganisms can<br>degrade nasty things like<br>pentachlorophenol can help us to clean<br>up<br>um environments that are contaminated<br>with nuclear waste so maybe we can<br>actually use microorganisms<br>microorganisms to clean up some of this<br>plastic pollution<br>so I had a quick chat with my mate David<br>um as around this time uh that the issue<br>of plastic pollution was becoming uh<br>I guess really in the public Minds<br>um because of things like the blue<br>planet production and it's around this<br>time uh my colleagues so Lou Joe and<br>Olga managed to secure about 12 million<br>New Zealand dollars to look at plastic<br>pollution in New Zealand<br>so we were really excited by this not<br>least because there were so many<br>Publications out there at the time that<br>were telling us that there are<br>microorganisms that degrade things like<br>polystyrene polypropylene PVC and even<br>some insects actually if you gave them<br>polystyrene absolutely loved it couldn't<br>get enough of the stuff so what we<br>thought we would do is to collate all<br>the information out there on the<br>different kinds of plastic degrading<br>organisms that we could find in the<br>literature<br>so Victor said about doing this he found<br>I think it was about one and a half<br>thousand Publications and read them all<br>apparently it's very boring he told me<br>this multiple times but at the end of<br>this what he managed to come up with<br>which he found about I think about 400<br>different species of bacteria and fungi<br>that have been reported might be capable<br>of degrading different kinds of plastics<br>and we can see these he managed to put<br>there we go so for example down here<br>we've got an organism which looks like<br>it can degrade polypropylene this is a<br>bacteria it's a geobacterium and up here<br>belonging to the fungi I've got one that<br>someone's reported can degrade<br>polyethylene this is a trichoderma so he<br>collated all of this information<br>together as a useful resource for other<br>scientists wanting to work on this area<br>of plastic pollution so we were really<br>excited by this result and we decided to<br>submit uh this collection of information<br>and other other data that I'm not going<br>through now do a top journal A NATO<br>communication publication a lot of<br>people in the audience already know what<br>I'm going to say here because you've<br>heard this recently you're such a<br>horrible group of colleagues you enjoyed<br>me being thrown under the bus so much I<br>thought I'd just leave it in here so I'm<br>sure you still appreciate it so I<br>submitted my work or Victor's work to<br>this great publication in nature<br>Communications we've got two really<br>strong reviews and we're really hyped up<br>by this and then right at the last<br>moment we had some horrible third<br>reviewer that said things like this that<br>the statements were vague misleading or<br>simply wrong<br>what an doesn't you know I went<br>to the same school as David Attenborough<br>so after this that's okay we didn't get<br>internet communications we submitted<br>then to another Journal so submitted to<br>another good Journal we've got two good<br>reviews and then another really shitty<br>one it was by the same reviewer because<br>he signed his name off<br>so I argued then with the editor of this<br>Channel and managed to get my<br>publication through which we're really<br>pleased with only for this man to email<br>me afterwards and tell us what terrible<br>work we've done<br>um and include the the journal editor in<br>this as well<br>so once Victor and I had stopped crying<br>and picked ourselves up off the floor we<br>thought about this a little bit more and<br>we came to the conclusion that actually<br>this guy didn't really just hate us he<br>hated the whole field of<br>um micro wheel plastic degradation and<br>kind of the more we work in this area<br>the more we're starting to agree with<br>him and I'll try and just take you<br>through that briefly<br>okay so what I did is I collated<br>information on all the different studies<br>that have evidence of plastic<br>degradation and through some really<br>basic criteria at them to see how well<br>this studies worked if these studies<br>didn't manage to meet these criteria<br>um they'd drop out and that's why these<br>circles get smaller as they go down<br>focus on the red ones the red ones<br>indicates that it's on the Plastics the<br>majority of plastics that are in current<br>circulation<br>we throw really simple criteria like do<br>you know what this plastic was made of<br>at least it is what we find is that most<br>of them don't and that's really<br>important because when we work with<br>things like plastic a lot of plastics<br>actually contain lots of things like<br>talcum powder calcium carbonate things<br>you might not otherwise realize<br>so when you see weight loss in your<br>plastic if you don't know what was there<br>in the first place it might just be the<br>calcium carbonate dissolving out<br>remarkably with these simple criteria we<br>could find not one single study out of<br>these many hundreds that Victor looked<br>at that really show evidence of the<br>degradation of the plastic polymer<br>okay so that's not a good good news<br>story doesn't mean that our database<br>wasn't useful it's just what I would try<br>and suggest you is that we found<br>evidence not at the degradation of the<br>plastic polymer but of substances<br>associated with the Plastics such as<br>those additives<br>actually these additives are also quite<br>problematic as well we do have lots of<br>them that are combined in our Plastics<br>and they Leach out quite quickly over<br>time for example when we put some<br>Plastics in Christchurch and Nelson in<br>Marine water there what you can see is<br>very quickly this is pet plastic<br>antimony leaching out of the plastic<br>which is used as an additive<br>and Tim<br>not very good at pronouncing it antimony<br>is a priority plan it's not something<br>that we really want lots of in the<br>environment and it has some carcinogenic<br>properties and it leeches quite quickly<br>and readily from our Plastics<br>so what we decided to do is to try and<br>have a look to work out what impact<br>Plastics had when surround into into a<br>marine environment on our microbial<br>communities<br>so we installed a range of different<br>plastic types both virgin plastic and<br>plastic that would aged by using strong<br>UV light into different areas around<br>Auckland Nelson and Christchurch<br>you can see what this plastic looked<br>like initially before we put it in the<br>water once we've left it there just for<br>a few months because it's actually quite<br>rich in in life you actually start to<br>feel you're almost doing a good thing by<br>putting so much plastic into the water<br>it's kind of strange you get beautiful<br>things like this little seahorse that we<br>found coming out as well<br>in the water quick<br>but of course what we're interested in<br>is how the microorganisms engaging with<br>these Plastics and without any evidence<br>that we could degrade them<br>so we use now Victor's highly derided<br>database to work out what kind of<br>organisms that other people had<br>associated with plastics we could find<br>in our samples<br>so you've got the number of Presumed<br>plastic degraders at two weeks here<br>six weeks and 12 weeks and you see that<br>initially there's quite a lot of<br>bacteria that have previously been<br>associated with plastic degradation<br>after two weeks of immersion but then<br>they start to disappear<br>one suggestion for this may be that they<br>get in there they degrade some of those<br>small monomers of the plastic or those<br>additives and once it's all leached out<br>there's no benefit to them being there<br>because they can't degrade the polymer<br>so they then disappear off and they're<br>no longer prevalent<br>okay so I guess take home messages here<br>is that I think the majority of plastic<br>polymers in circulation cannot be<br>degraded by microorganisms the bigger<br>problem is probably the stuff that<br>leeches out of the plastic since<br>microorganisms they really are the<br>problem because no bacterias ever choke<br>to death on a plastic bag so it's these<br>leachates that we're really focusing on<br>now<br>we're also starting to focus on some of<br>these Plastics shown in in Blue on here<br>as well these represent a minority of<br>Plastics in circulation but they're<br>things like PCL pla the known combustion<br>compostable Plastics the ones that make<br>up your coffee cup lid so focusing more<br>on the ones that we now know to be<br>degradable<br>okay so for example Victor's managed to<br>put together<br>an assay whereby he can screen hundreds<br>or even thousands if you wanted I<br>probably wouldn't want two thousands<br>Victor of different organisms to see how<br>well they can degrade plastic so he<br>makes an Emulsion of the plastic and<br>what you can see here for example is<br>evidence of one microorganism shown here<br>that can degrade this plastic because<br>you've got a clear Zone in this plastic<br>so he's managed to isolate a whole range<br>of different organisms bacteria and<br>fungi that can degrade things like PTL<br>and Pla Plastics and actually some<br>organisms that can degrade multiple of<br>those compostable type plastids as well<br>we can screen the genes of the organisms<br>that we find those novel organisms and<br>try and work out what kind of genes they<br>might have that might be capable of<br>degrading these plastic for example this<br>organism here this fungus looks like it<br>might have some novel genes for pla<br>degradation and also I think PCL<br>degradation there if my eyes are not<br>going crossed<br>so we can start to understand start to<br>isolate new organisms and work out what<br>their capabilities might be<br>we can also look to see what kind of<br>genes are being expressed for example<br>when our organisms are or aren't being<br>exposed to Plastics as well so this is<br>an organism that Victor worked with it's<br>probably got about 20 000 functional<br>genes there's maybe three or four here<br>that you can see the organism is using<br>only when it's exposed to that plastic<br>so that gives us evidence of Novel<br>plastic degrading genes that we can then<br>take out test and potentially mutate to<br>try and get them to degrade plastic more<br>okay and that's pretty much where I'm at<br>for now so that leaves me with some<br>economic acknowledgments so it takes a<br>lot of took a lot of people for me to<br>get to where I am today there's a lot of<br>people listed here whose work I haven't<br>mentioned and I apologize but I've only<br>got so much time<br>um as as you already um now aware so<br>I've supervised a number of different<br>students here but my role in SBS extends<br>much further as well to the care of our<br>about 150 PhD students some of this<br>suggests that this may be a bit of a<br>thankless task actually it's not I<br>really quite enjoy it I feel like I get<br>good stuff done<br>um and one key reason for that is I've<br>got a really good Mentor in Vivian Kirk<br>as well for helping me through this very<br>test which I really appreciate<br>I'd like to thank my colleagues both the<br>ones that are here and in the Border<br>science community and also some of these<br>beautiful people as well who<br>occasionally are kind enough to make<br>sure that I actually get outside of the<br>lab and enjoy myself too<br>okay I now need to mention two very<br>important men in my life<br>first one Mike I you don't think I was<br>going to miss you so Mike and I started<br>at the University of Auckland at about<br>the same time<br>um Mike's anomaly it's always been that<br>little bit ahead of me in terms of his<br>research career so I should say we share<br>a lab we're also work in offices next to<br>each other and because our building is<br>so poorly Bill Mike as you've mentioned<br>portugals like we share in office at<br>times as well Mike I've got really<br>strong memories of when I was still a<br>postdoc and you're a lecturer of just<br>watching you and thinking God that guy<br>he does so much work I don't know that<br>I'm capable of doing that job and I<br>really appreciate all of your help in<br>getting me to where I am today not least<br>because now I'm Professor I can give<br>this god-awful task of trying to keep it<br>with you it's been exhausting<br>okay the other person that obviously<br>needs to acknowledge is my brand shiny<br>uh new husband Sab<br>uh here on the left you can see my<br>beautiful engagement ring that he made<br>um so yeah so<br>obviously we've had uh our marriage very<br>recently um I probably don't need to go<br>through too much emotional stuff with<br>you because Seb won't appreciate that<br>but I am very lucky to have found<br>um myself with someone that that really<br>is just so Deport supportive of all the<br>work I do and actually not just the work<br>that I do but my colleagues and students<br>as well<br>yeah so I think as I told you at the<br>beginning I often like to try and get<br>people to call me King Lee I said<br>sometimes I think he likes people to try<br>and use the term Saints have we've been<br>married for nearly two weeks so it's<br>possibly starting to earn that title um<br>I'm not quite sure so as many people<br>these days do um me seven I met online<br>and shortly after meeting him online he<br>sent me some really dodgy videos and I'm<br>whoops here we go I think the sounds<br>coming off of my laptop so it might be a<br>like a circle okay yeah I see that now<br>hair Circle<br>huh well<br>so if you listen to that whole clip it<br>really is quite funny and on that basis<br>a lot of seb's friends can we talk to<br>hair servants and just for anyone that's<br>thank you very much</p></main><footer style="margin-top: 2rem; background: #0001; padding: 2rem; text-align: center;"><p>We Are The University</p><ul style="list-style-type: none; padding: 0; margin:
