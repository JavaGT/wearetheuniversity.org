and so a look at the<br>usual shape of the fertility curve and<br>in particular what it shows and how it<br>relates to the total fertility rates<br>because this is where it actually gets<br>interesting because<br>demographers talk a lot about the total<br>fertility rate it's important it's an<br>important measure it's talked about a<br>lot even in the Press but how does it<br>relate where does it come from what are<br>the numbers that uh<br>um actually reflected in the TFR<br>it's not just a number it is derived and<br>I'm going to show you how it's derived<br>now the fertility rate can relate to<br>just first births in which case it's for<br>the age Pacific Fertility rates of just<br>first bursts we can also look at it for<br>higher order births and quite often for<br>all birth together<br>I'm going to discuss how it really how<br>it relates to a normal distribution a<br>normal curve<br>I'm going to look at how postponement<br>affects the uh cohort the period<br>fertility curve in relation to the<br>cohort fertility curve<br>and so why we see the difference in<br>cohort fertility rates compared to<br>period fertility rates<br>and so yes the effect of postponement<br>moving from a left skewed curve to a<br>right skewed curve<br>I'm also going to look at the effect of<br>immigration on fertility curves why they<br>have bulges and sometimes very strange<br>shapes<br>I'm going to compare countries and how<br>there's a very wide variation even<br>between countries that are basically<br>quite similar the developed Western<br>countries I'm not looking at developing<br>countries<br>I'm looking at<br>um touching on bimodal curves why some<br>countries go through that stage in their<br>evolution over time<br>and then I'm going to be looking at and<br>explaining why the TFR Rose after a<br>trough around 2000 and then white has<br>fallen over the most recent decade<br>and explaining that in terms of the<br>fertility curve so that you can actually<br>see why have these Trends happened<br>and then the final question<br>um an open question are we reaching a<br>limit to late fertility<br>so these are the data sources I'm<br>looking at<br>mostly when I'm comparing countries I<br>use the human fertility database<br>but I also get direct data directly from<br>the Swiss statistical office<br>which gives more detail particularly<br>comparing women of Swiss nationality<br>compared to women of foreign nationality<br>so I get more detailed and more<br>up-to-date information from them<br>for New Zealand I managed to download<br>the data from the website of the<br>statistics New Zealand which was<br>exciting for me that I founded this last<br>week or two so I can actually compare<br>New Zealand which is rather nice<br>now for some of the graphs I'm looking<br>uh by birth order sometimes first bursts<br>sometimes all birth orders and again<br>sometimes I look at a period curves<br>sometimes cohort curves I'll try and<br>clarify which I'm looking at for which<br>graphs<br>as I said I'm focusing solely on<br>developed countries and those with good<br>data often birth order specific data<br>so first of all let's look at the usual<br>shape of the graph and what it shows and<br>how it relates to the TFR<br>so here we have uh Switzerland's the<br>fertility curve called Switzerland in<br>2005 so a period curve<br>I'm looking at all birth orders so first<br>uh births and all other birth orders and<br>I'm concentrating particularly on women<br>with Swiss nationality<br>um a very specific reason that<br>Switzerland has a very high proportion<br>of uh people in the country with foreign<br>nationality<br>um getting on for a quarter and for<br>women in their early 30s is the third<br>and the problem with uh foreign<br>women mixed into the uh into the whole<br>population is that they have rather<br>specific patterns of fertility<br>and it causes a distortion<br>whereas if I look just at women with<br>Swiss nationality then it's a more<br>stable not a completely stable but a<br>more stable population<br>and so that's why I'm concentrating on<br>them<br>the other interesting thing about women<br>with Swiss nationality is that they have<br>very late uh child bearing uh trends<br>that they uh their Peach house bearing<br>age this is back in 2005 was at age 31.<br>so here we have the um the mode of the<br>curve up at age 31.<br>so yes just to cover the x-axis is age<br>of women from 15 to 49 this is the usual<br>age bands that we look at<br>and their y-axis is the age age specific<br>fertility rate shortened to asfr<br>that we're going to be talking about a<br>lot more and the TFR for this<br>um for this year for Swiss women the TFR<br>was 1.27 so very low and I'll explain a<br>bit more about why so this is a basic<br>fertility curve<br>a nice smooth curve<br>and how do we get that to that curve<br>so it's a plot of the age-pacific<br>fertility rates and they're calculated<br>as the number of births in a particular<br>year to women of a specific age<br>as I say many of you most of you will<br>know this I'm just clarifying for<br>perhaps anybody who is not quite so<br>clear on it so in 2008<br>2005 that year that I was discussing<br>there were<br>3746 births is this all birth orders<br>it's a 34 000 Swiss women aged 31.<br>certified<br>3700 by 34 000 you get an asfr of 0.11<br>you might not be able to read these<br>numbers but that's the red box over here<br>age 31 not 0.11<br>you do it for all the ages from age 15<br>to 49 you get all these numbers usually<br>four decimal places we usually use<br>and so the age band as it says 15 to 49<br>generally considered the main<br>reproductive ages<br>and what is a total fertility rate is<br>the sum of all these age-specific<br>fertility rates so you have all these<br>asfrs all these numbers and you add them<br>all up just a simple sum you get the<br>number down there<br>1.2733 that is the TFR for 2005 for<br>Swiss women<br>going back to looking at a bit says more<br>like pure maths graphically the TFR is<br>the area under the fertility curve it's<br>integral<br>the screen smaller we just can't see on<br>the main screen this<br>oh I see everyone assume it's the<br>problem in the room oh the zone is fine<br>okay<br>sorry folks so people you can see more<br>often the people in the room the the<br>folk in the room have difficulty seeing<br>the bottom line<br>so<br>we can help you later if you want so the<br>TFR for 2005 is 1.27 it's the sum of all<br>let's have a look at how um you get<br>um the combination of first birth rates<br>and higher order birth rates<br>again a fertility curve for first burst<br>the red line<br>the peak for in 2005 for Swiss swimming<br>was at age 30. so a year younger than<br>for all births for second births the<br>peak is at age 32 33 it's identical for<br>those two ages and for higher or diverse<br>it's 34. as you'd expect obviously<br>well it doesn't always quite work but<br>that's another story that's the<br>um Peak age for higher order versus<br>younger first holes diverse<br>so the tfr1 so this is the area under<br>the first birth curve is 0.61 for tfr2<br>is 0.46 for higher order versus 0.2<br>so you add all those together and you<br>get the TFR for everybody<br>sometimes it's best or nicest cleaner to<br>look at just first births the curve is<br>more easy to interpret because it's when<br>women enter motherhood<br>the care for all birth orders is wider<br>the higher order births raise the curve<br>another interesting thing if you look at<br>the complements of tfr1 so this is one<br>minus tfr1<br>that is the proportion of women who are<br>going to remain childless if but that is<br>now the trainings so there's the rise<br>are a fallen fertility tend to follow in<br>sequence after changes in first birth<br>rates so there'd be a rise or a fall in<br>first birth rates in one year and then a<br>year or two later it'll be the that same<br>Trend will happen for second birth and<br>so on<br>um the problem with many countries is<br>that it's not biological birth order<br>it's marital birth order that is<br>recorded for women and that's not as<br>useful it really needs the actual<br>biological birth order<br>so a real normal curve is a natural plot<br>of her<br>um a normal distribution the black<br>dashed line<br>this is a hypothetical line of<br>um a normal distribution so for a normal<br>curve uh with a peak that matches uh the<br>period<br>um<br>a curve for 2005.<br>the normal curve is somewhat wider than<br>the period curve we see in 2005.<br>listen again we're looking at just first<br>verse because I say that's this curve is<br>cleaner it will tend to be more likely<br>to be symmetric<br>and in 2005<br>the period curve was pretty symmetric<br>again I'm going to talk a bit more about<br>this<br>so what is a normal distribution again<br>going back to basic maths it's also<br>called the bell curve<br>it represents random values equally<br>spread between those less and more than<br>the mean it's symmetric with the mean<br>being same as the median same as the<br>mode<br>and I calculated the normal function<br>with numbers that I derived with a<br>certain amount of logic from other data<br>that I'd got<br>um with estimates from the mean standard<br>deviation I did a model with the data<br>that I'd got<br>but what we've seen in that graph is<br>that the period fertility curve is<br>narrower than the normal curve and why<br>might that be<br>how does the cohort curve compare<br>so I have data for the 1975 cohort The<br>1975 cohort the ones the women born in<br>1975 of course reached the age of 30. in<br>2005. that is why I've chosen this 1975<br>kilowatt unfortunately of course I don't<br>have a data but prior to<br>um when they were 25 but I have the rest<br>of the data up to 2020 because I'm<br>looking at just Swiss women so I don't<br>have a full age span<br>and so what I see is that for the cohort<br>curve<br>I would say that pretty closely<br>approximates a normal curve which I far<br>is rather interesting and rather<br>exciting<br>let's look at period anchor hot curves<br>therefore the period curve is narrower<br>than the cohort curve and the cohort<br>curve<br>approximates at the curve from a normal<br>distribution<br>so the TFR on a normal curve is 0.71 but<br>so as I say the cohort curve<br>approximates a normal curve for a fairly<br>static population the Swiss women<br>but the period curve is narrower and<br>therefore we have a lower TFR for period<br>TFR compared to cohort TFR<br>so let's look now at how postponement<br>has happened over the past<br>um<br>50 years<br>40 years so this is the period curve for<br>Switzerland in 1980. now because I'm<br>going back to 1980 I have to combine<br>Swiss and foreign women because I don't<br>have them separated out from that era<br>so this is a very strongly<br>um left skewed curve with a Peak at age<br>26 so much earlier Peak<br>um stronger left skewed the tfr1 was<br>but let's move forward to 2020 the<br>latest State the latest year that we<br>have numbers for<br>the peak has moved out from 26 to age 31<br>and the curve is Right skewed it's also<br>the TFR one is a little lower<br>so what what happened then<br>um<br>it moved being left skewered to right<br>skewed and uh back in 2005 the year I<br>was discussing before was when it went<br>through<br>a more or less symmetric curve<br>so it went from this food symmetric<br>right skewed<br>and we can see that the 2005 period<br>curve this is for all women in<br>Switzerland is still narrower than the<br>cohort curve for 1975.<br>but if you compare those uh to uh the<br>cohort and the period where the the peak<br>is identical we actually obviously have<br>an identical number there because the<br>1975 cohort or age 30 in 2005 so that is<br>an identical number there to think<br>period curve<br>uh but the yeah the TFR ones were quite<br>different<br>so what's happened<br>so why is the cohort curve wider the<br>cohort curve is wider than the period<br>curve because a cohort of women start on<br>a trajectory of higher earlier fertility<br>in their pre-modal years but then<br>continue to hire late fertility in their<br>post-modal years<br>and so when postponement is happening<br>cohort tfrs will be greater than period<br>tfrs and so cohort curves are wider than<br>period curves let's just go back so a<br>cohort will set off when they're 15 so<br>this was the<br>um<br>uh the women at age 15 in 1980 they<br>started off heading up this line<br>but as they got older they were heading<br>off to a later Peak because that was<br>what was happening so they would reach a<br>peek at a later year later age and it<br>would continue to be higher as they<br>got older and so you can see that for a<br>cohort they would be it would be a wider<br>curve a later Peak<br>and the cohort curve was wider<br>I hope that explains it<br>I think that's the graphical<br>representation makes it much clearer<br>than trying to persuade trying to<br>persuade people about the difference<br>between cohorts rates and period rates<br>because you can actually see<br>why they why there is a difference<br>between<br>the narrower perfectly period race The<br>now moving on and<br>um looking at immigration how does that<br>distorts the<br>um curves for fertility why do fertility<br>curves have boundaries<br>again looking at Switzerland comparing<br>the Swiss women with foreign women<br>now look at that turquoise curve again<br>just first births for foreign women the<br>turquoise that's so I don't like a crazy<br>curve how can that be it's got this huge<br>Spike and then comes down to somewhat<br>similar normal levels after age 30. so<br>the TFR one of foreign women is actually<br>over one 1.09 back in 2005. whereas for<br>Swiss women in women it's just not 0.61<br>much lower so you combine them all<br>together<br>and you have<br>a fairly smooth curve but with this sort<br>of hump on the left side which is<br>derived from all these foreign women<br>sort of pushing up<br>the fertility curve on the left hand<br>has it changed much in recent years<br>go through to 2014 no there's still that<br>a strong hump on the left hand side<br>um and the contribution of foreign women<br>to<br>um boost the total fertility rate when<br>you combine Swiss and foreign women<br>and again still the TFR is a straight<br>one which would imply going back to the<br>discussion before that the compliment<br>would be zero so no foreign women were<br>remaining childless which doesn't really<br>make sense because obviously some do<br>so why why is it this huge hump in early<br>asfrs of migrants<br>it's because women often postpone<br>starting a family until they've arrived<br>in their new country<br>so they were childless in their country<br>of origin<br>and then their first birth fertility<br>rates rocket when they arrive in their<br>new country<br>migrant women tend to start a family<br>this is for Switzerland at a younger age<br>than the Swiss population<br>the tfr1 of foreign women can be greater<br>than one<br>which would imply negative childlessness<br>is actually caused by the Distortion<br>inherent from the migrants whole life<br>course being split between countries<br>their country of orange in TFR is<br>depending on their actual numbers<br>leaving slightly deflated they're<br>receiving countries TFR is inflated<br>depending on the exact number of<br>migrants so for instance I'm an example<br>of this I moved to Switzerland<br>um when I was 28 I was childless in the<br>UK I then had two children in<br>Switzerland so I deflated at the UK's<br>TFR for the years that I was there and I<br>inflated the TFR of Switzerland because<br>I had my children<br>in Switzerland so my whole life course I<br>just have two children so I wouldn't be<br>doing too much to a a normal country in<br>fact stayed in one country but my<br>behavior my fertility behavior is<br>actually<br>um distorted two countries tfrs I guess<br>it could happen could have happened to<br>some of you because New Zealand has a<br>and therefore the ultimate how sorry<br>however<br>the ultimate cohort fertility of Swiss<br>women<br>is greater than foreign women<br>so I did some modeling I used what I<br>call a cohort tracking method I've<br>followed uh the women through of the the<br>model of the women through from age<br>um on this graph it's 20 through to<br>um late 40s so the again the turquoise<br>line is the actual number of children<br>that women have at at each age so it's<br>in the 20s mid-20s up to 30 foreign<br>women have actually more children than<br>Swiss women Swiss women start<br>childbearing very late<br>however once Swiss women get going<br>then<br>they actually exceed<br>the number of children<br>that foreign women have<br>there's also a distorting fact because<br>of naturalization so the women who are<br>in their 40s some were immigrants but<br>became Swiss now it takes quite a long<br>time in Switzerland but by the time<br>they're in the late 40s then they will<br>have become Swiss some of them<br>but in addition the foreign population<br>there's still childless women coming<br>into Switzerland<br>right through from the<br>um 20s and 30s and 40s again still<br>Childers as they move into Switzerland<br>so they're deflating the actual average<br>number of children<br>so it's really quite complicated but<br>let's say for Swiss in Switzerland the<br>final number of children<br>or Swiss women is slightly higher than<br>for foreign women<br>if you actually look at it rather than<br>by nationalities and but by immigration<br>status<br>the number of children on average at the<br>end of a woman's fertile life it's<br>actually very similar for immigrants<br>there's not born in Switzerland and<br>those who are born in Switzerland<br>because of all these factors<br>so it's actually very similar it's about<br>now let's look at the variation in shape<br>of the fertility curve between countries<br>so yes we have the graphs for all birth<br>orders most recent years attack and<br>compare countries 2020 we're not going<br>to look at how the pandemic might have<br>affected fertility rates because that's<br>a whole other story and yet to be told<br>really<br>so that first graph as the Swiss women<br>TFR 1.36 and still very low in 2020<br>again this is just looking at Swiss<br>swimming<br>for Denmark it's a really quite a<br>similar curve but the TFR is quite<br>significantly higher because the peak is<br>higher the TFR is 1.68 so really quite<br>marketably higher than the Swiss women<br>whose TFR is only 1.36<br>then for Spain the TFR is much lower<br>the age of the peak is is later but the<br>whole curve is just much lower<br>look at the USA the TFR is actually very<br>similar to Denmark 1.64 compared to 1.68<br>but it's a much wider curve much less<br>focused on a single age for childbearing<br>so yes every country has unique features<br>even comparing relative pretty similar<br>countries developed highly developed<br>Western countries<br>some have sharp Peaks which suggests to<br>me take social norms for the timing of<br>child's bearing some have wide curves<br>which I suggest is an amalgam of<br>different norms for different subgroups<br>of the population<br>the age of peak child's bearing various<br>again significantly even across Europe<br>the dead markets the peak is at age 30<br>for Spain it's 33.<br>a couple of comments that I don't<br>reflect in the graphs the likelihood of<br>going on to a second or higher order<br>birth there is considerably between<br>countries so for Swiss women it's very<br>high for the Eastern European countries<br>um also the proportion of women who<br>remain childless varies between<br>countries<br>and doesn't always lead to a lower TFR<br>so for instance Britain the USA have<br>high childlessness like 20 or more will<br>remain childless but if you have a<br>subgroup of the population who have<br>relatively high fertility so relatively<br>High being three so we're not talking<br>about huge families but it's relatively<br>High three or more<br>that can affects the distribution uh the<br>how about New Zealand so there's their<br>fertility curve for 2020 the TFR for New<br>Zealand in 2020 with 1.61<br>so where does it what country is it does<br>it most resemble for its fertility curve<br>so for the first half first portion of<br>the curve up to the mid-20s<br>it's really very similar to Northern<br>Ireland<br>it's got a bit of a hump on the left<br>hand side which suggests to me the<br>effects of immigration but I might be<br>wrong there could be other subgroups of<br>the population that have rather early<br>fertility I don't know the<br>um I don't have a whole lot of<br>information about New Zealand I want to<br>learn more but I don't know it yet<br>what about this the second part of the<br>curve for New Zealand really very<br>similar to Canada look out<br>closely it tracks Canada<br>so yeah a combination<br>but not so dissimilar to the other<br>developed countries<br>now a quick look at bimodal curves these<br>are and makes them rather nice graphs<br>and also how they evolve over time<br>so this is the Czech Republic<br>and uh so these are cohort curves for<br>first birth<br>um so this is what I concentrated on for<br>a particular study that I did so going<br>from the 1965 cohort in five years jumps<br>up to 1985. what you see is a huge drop<br>in the peak fertility which was very<br>early it's age 20. a huge drop in the<br>peak rates<br>um between the 1970 cohort in the 1975<br>cohort what happened to them it was the<br>cohorts that were going through the fall<br>of Communism in 1968 so suddenly the<br>postponed child's bearing dramatically<br>so the the peak dropped hugely and then<br>between the 1975 Copart which still had<br>an early Peak and a a very wide curve by<br>1980 the 1980 cohort it had moved across<br>so that the peak was later in the late<br>20s and by 1985 the peak was still wide<br>and was at age 30 so much more like a<br>Western European pattern<br>I plotted it as a contour graph I'm a<br>geographer after all I like Contours<br>um I mean look at those rather nice<br>Peaks so<br>again again the vertical axis is the<br>cohort so 1965 cohort from through to<br>the 1975 cohort you can see this<br>um we're losing one Peak but starting to<br>gain this later Peak I'm going through<br>to the 1985 cohort where you have one<br>later Peak but yes it can give you some<br>really interesting patterns if you plot<br>this these numbers as Contour plots<br>these are for Sweden again a transition<br>from an early Peak to a later Peak but<br>the USA just staying fixed with an early<br>so bimodal fertility curves they occur<br>when there are two sub-populations in a<br>country with different Norms of<br>childbearing<br>the early Peak and requirement<br>immigrants population where the peak is<br>caused by the effect of women commonly<br>starting as a family soon after they<br>arrive in a country in a new country<br>after being childless in their home<br>country<br>in the Eastern European countries early<br>child's bearing was the norm and was<br>encouraged by social policies supporting<br>young women to study or work at the same<br>time as starting a family<br>but with the fall of communism a portion<br>of the population changed to late<br>child's bearing the late transferring<br>Norm of Western countries<br>but for a period there are two distincts<br>of populations one moving<br>so yes what had been happening to the<br>TFR Trends since 2000<br>first of all there was a rise<br>and this is what we see that how did the<br>fertility curves change from the year of<br>minimum TFR<br>um soon after the year 2000<br>so that the trough was in the<br>um<br>a year span between 2000 2002 after the<br>tfrs have been falling through the 1990s<br>in most countries so they were tfrs were<br>coming down through the 1990s Richard<br>trough<br>soon after the millennium<br>and then they went up steadily in many<br>countries many Western countries I<br>reached the maximum in the eight years<br>between about 2008 and 2010<br>really all in a similar band<br>and then after that they started falling<br>again so why did this happen<br>so<br>I think the most interesting thing you<br>can see which is very clear on these<br>graphs is that the early fertility under<br>30 fertility those two years the uh so<br>far the earlier year the trough year the<br>red year<br>and the later the peak here the Europe<br>Peak fertility the yellow year for the<br>early years they trended very closely so<br>early fertility stabilized it's very<br>very similar across those<br>that's a um time spam but what's<br>happened in that decade the first decade<br>of the New Millennium to late fertility<br>so this is postmodal age fertility<br>but it the curve grew rightwards so<br>later fertility expanded that women uh<br>women who are having uh children early<br>they've stayed the same the rates stayed<br>the same but the rates for uh late<br>childsbury and late child bearing<br>expanded sometimes the peak also went up<br>so there's uh the height of the curve<br>increased but it was particularly the<br>width of the Curve<br>um moved off to the right widening the<br>Curve you can see it again for these<br>four countries France Italy Netherlands<br>and Norway and the change in their tfrs<br>respectively for instance Norway moved<br>from the TFR in 2003 their year of the<br>trough<br>1.75 to 2010 1.98 so getting on for two<br>so what caused<br>um in demographic terms the rise in the<br>TFR after the post-2000 trough<br>there was a stabilization of early<br>pre-modal age fertility rates together<br>with a rise and late post-modal age<br>fertility rise this is the the curve<br>moving off to the right therefore the<br>fertility curve widened but on that side<br>only<br>so there's a also a rise in Peak rates<br>in some countries indicating increased<br>but then what happened next after around<br>2008 2010<br>again looking at the curves comparing<br>the yellow curve they have uh Falls<br>eight year Peak TFR with the green curve<br>which is the the latest year or<br>2019-2020<br>all we see is that it's a latter cut<br>part of the curves that are very similar<br>so for Swiss women they all they overlap<br>Canada's the same Denmark the same<br>Finland the same<br>and so the curve became narrower that<br>the there was a movement for early<br>fertility<br>across<br>to<br>um the later year and so the curve<br>so what caused the fall in the TFR in<br>the most recent decade there was a<br>stabilization of late postmodal age<br>fertility rates together with the fall<br>and early pre-modal age fertility rates<br>causing a narrowing of the fertility<br>curve so the right outside stayed fixed<br>but the left-hand side shrank<br>there was also falling Peak rates in<br>most countries there was a declining<br>intensity of childbearing<br>what happened in New Zealand<br>somewhat similar not quite the same<br>the year of the peak 2010 was really<br>pretty substantial<br>um<br>which is a substantially high of most<br>Ages which gave a TFR in 2010 of 2.17<br>which is really quite High compared to<br>most of the Western countries and in<br>2020 it's really shrunk back a lot the<br>Peaks gone down a lot it's shrunk also<br>considerably for early child's bearing<br>so are we reaching a limit to late<br>fertility<br>so this we I split the fertility curve<br>into two halves<br>first of all we're looking at early<br>fertility for the most recent years ages<br>15 to 33 and then I look at the higher<br>ages<br>so for this dozen countries or so that<br>I'm looking at there's really quite a<br>big variation<br>in the patterns really fertility so<br>Spain really low very low Peak<br>but the Swiss swimming starts even later<br>but then go on to a really quite a sharp<br>Peak<br>um around just have the age 30.<br>um look at this country up here this is<br>Denmark<br>um really quite a sharp Peak<br>um a little earlier than a younger age<br>than many countries<br>um<br>this country the Netherlands also really<br>quite a sharp Peak<br>but down here<br>we see Italy much lower Peak much more<br>like Spain<br>New Zealand pretty much in the middle<br>it tells garage a lot of early fertility<br>but then the peak is<br>meddling for intensity<br>as a very different patterns and<br>fertility for ages up to 33.<br>there is significant very young<br>fertility they say I call it under age<br>24 in the USA Northern Ireland and New<br>Zealand<br>and for Swiss women and also to<br>illustrate extend women in the<br>Netherlands they start childbearing very<br>late but then they have quite a marked<br>Peak an intensity of child's bearing at<br>age 32 for Swiss women 31 from the<br>Netherlands<br>that's really quite<br>remarkably different the earlier uh<br>fertility curve much more similar<br>that for the countries I would say the<br>following very similar patterns for ages<br>um again Swiss New Zealand right in the<br>middle<br>Swiss women yes they hire because they<br>so I would say the late fertility curve<br>is remarkably similar for all these<br>countries so does that suggest as it<br>does to me that<br>women are hitting a limit to late<br>child's bearing<br>so I thought let's look at a different<br>country that does have higher fertility<br>Israel I've plotted Israel on this graph<br>here<br>so yes it is significantly higher than<br>the Western countries I've looked at<br>okay so it's a back in 2009 but even so<br>it is significantly higher<br>so why am I to be representative what<br>could happen or why might it not be<br>representative<br>so the Fidelity curve late fertility<br>curve of Israel<br>does suggest that over 34 fertility<br>could be much higher than is currently<br>observed in Western countries however in<br>Israel some women have larger families<br>or have just large families this is four<br>and more children<br>and some late fertility May often be<br>from higher order births rather than<br>from women who are just starting child's<br>bearing much younger<br>we know obviously that frequentity<br>declines with age<br>and I wonder might it be more pronounced<br>for women who have not already had a<br>child<br>again open questions<br>also there are various barriers to women<br>starting a family late even if they're<br>not continuing to have children later<br>for instance not having a stable partner<br>or a partner with whom a woman wants to<br>have a child<br>there's a problem that we know a lot<br>about Korean motherhood conflicts and<br>the opportunities of having a child at a<br>so just to recap the topics I've covered<br>in this talk what the fertility curve<br>shows and how it relates to the TFR in<br>particular<br>what the effect of postponement is how<br>we get see it from the period curve<br>how it compares to the cohort curve the<br>impact of immigration<br>um variations between countries the<br>height the width of the curve bimodal<br>curves and the what you can learn from<br>Contour plots<br>um I've explained to the rise in the<br>fall of the TFR<br>since the year 2000<br>and how variable early fertility rates<br>um comparing countries but the similar<br>similarity in late fertility<br>so these are papers that I've published<br>in relation to these topics<br>and I'll finish off there thank you<br>foreign</p></main><footer style="margin-top:
