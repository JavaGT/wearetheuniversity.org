Researchers at the University of Waikato are positioning New Zealand as a world leader in the development of AI and machine learning.</p><h2>Transcript</h2><p style="opacity: 0.9; font-size: 0.8em">Transcripts may be automatically generated and may not be 100% accurate.</p><p>AI is going to change everything and it's going to <br>be used everywhere there is a big opportunity in  <br>New Zealand not to be only users of AI but to be <br>developers of AI. The AI Institute is the first one  <br>of its kind in New Zealand and we decided that <br>we are going to make AI accessible to everyone.<br>The Ability to analyze data draw conclusions and in follow up on<br>those conclusions as well artificial intelligence  <br>is about and that's why it's so exciting it has <br>the power to analyze, re-analyze, give us directions  <br>on where we're heading and build solutions that <br>fix our world. Te Ipu o te Mahara is about supporting the pursuit  <br>of intelligence and that's what the Institute <br>is about providing sustenance to researchers  <br>to programs to knowledge so that we can build <br>better knowledge systems to support the greater good.<br>The waikato AI project is perhaps more most <br>well known for its machine learning software the  <br>Weka software which has been downloaded several <br>million times it's used across universities in the  <br>world to teach the basics of machine learning and <br>artificial intelligence the goal with this project  <br>was to try to make machine learning techniques <br>accessible to anyone by providing a very easy  <br>to use collection of algorithms in the form of <br>a user interface. The Weka software was very very  <br>well known everywhere so for me coming to waikato <br>was like going to MIT because in terms of machine  <br>learning data mining they were the ones living <br>in the world we have the first AI supercomputer  <br>from Nvidia Nvidia dgx a100 this is a specific <br>supercomputer design for AI in the sense that  <br>it's using gpus to build deep learning models that <br>otherwise would not be possible so students that  <br>are doing the PHD and researchers they really <br>need all these huge resources to be able to do  <br>their research in a way that is successful.<br>We can apply this also to natural language  <br>processing and in this case we are exploring <br>options to do that with Maori. <br>Knowledge is conveyed through language and if we can get <br>our artificial intelligence systems convercing  <br>and different languages inherently different <br>knowledges will be applied and that's cool.   <br>I think AI is quite exciting because it's going to <br>change everything and at the moment the current  <br>speed of the advances is so huge that makes the <br>field very very exciting. For the young people that  <br>they really want to build the new big things <br>yeah AI is the place to be right now </p></main><footer style="margin-top: 2rem; background: #0001; padding: 2rem; text-align: center;"><p>We Are The University</p><ul style="list-style-type: none; padding: 0; margin: 0;"><li><a href="/">Home</a></li><li><a href="/about">About</a></li><li><a href="/contact">Contact</a></li></ul></footer></body></html>
