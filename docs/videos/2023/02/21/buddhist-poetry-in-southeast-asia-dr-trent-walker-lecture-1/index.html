my name is Ben schoenball I'm the<br>head of the religion program at the<br>University of otago and it's my great<br>pleasure on behalf of the program and<br>the domika Education Foundation which<br>has supported this lecture series to<br>welcome Dr Trent Walker to give a series<br>of lectures starting today and all this<br>week on uh Buddhist poetry in Southeast<br>Asia<br>um those here will know uh Dr Walker um<br>he specializes in Southeast Asian<br>Buddhism music literature manuscripts uh<br>he's published widely in several<br>languages Camino Lao Pali Thai<br>Vietnamese for this text and several<br>several language texts I should say uh<br>he hasn't you haven't posted anything in<br>poly yourself No I<br>um and recently he's the author of uh or<br>he is the author of a book that's just<br>come out recently until Nirvana's time<br>but his songs from Cambodia which has<br>just come out recently and which were<br>all very excited about there's lots of<br>uh really wonderful things to say about<br>him and his research and um but I don't<br>want to take up too much of our time<br>today uh but what I do would like to say<br>is that he's come all the way to New<br>Zealand to give this series of lectures<br>uh taking time away from his commitments<br>at Stanford right now in Palo Alto and<br>we're very grateful that he's come all<br>this way to be here<br>um and we're very grateful to you for<br>tuning in I know it isn't a completely<br>convenient time for all of you<br>um but I think you'll be uh rewarded for<br>the time with these this set of lectures<br>so thank you very much Trent I'm going<br>to turn it over to you and um just a<br>couple of housekeeping things we are<br>recording this uh so there will be a<br>kind of interactive element to the<br>discussions that will be recorded if you<br>make some comments and then down the<br>line feel strongly I guess within 24<br>hours or less uh that you really don't<br>want them uh you know sort of out there<br>on a YouTube channel that you know maybe<br>not many people will see but some might<br>um please do let me know but other than<br>that I will take it as it's okay that we<br>um sort of have this recording out there<br>including comments<br>um and also this will be the time that<br>we use every day for the next five days<br>so whatever you've signed in for now<br>it's the same time slot uh for the rest<br>of the week<br>so without further Ado I'll turn it over<br>to you Trent thank you very much thank<br>you so much ben thank you for<br>inviting me here having it be possible<br>to give this series of talks and it's<br>such a pleasure to be here at the<br>University of otago to be here in New<br>Zealand and to have a chance to to speak<br>and and learn in conversation with all<br>of you so thank you<br>and those of you who are<br>here uh in the room<br>um again such a pleasure that that you<br>are here those of you who are on Zoom uh<br>you'll see that there's not an<br>overwhelming number of people in the<br>room here but uh I'll sometimes be<br>talking maybe more to the camera more to<br>the screen up there sometimes to<br>particular people here<br>as as Ben mentioned I'd like to make<br>this a somewhat interactive space as<br>much as that's possible within the the<br>boundaries of of zoom and so we'll just<br>need to experiment a little bit together<br>as to what will work best for that and<br>no pressure at all to participate I'm<br>I'm happy to keep talking but I think we<br>will have a more enriching experience if<br>there's some degree of of dialogue as we<br>go through<br>so before I offer some framing remarks<br>on the series of these five lectures as<br>a whole and what I in a sense trying to<br>to do in them I wanted to just get a<br>sense from from all of you about what<br>what brings you here<br>so in order to do that I'd like you to<br>respond in the chat or if you're here in<br>the room you can maybe write this down<br>um and then deliver that deliver it or<br>at least let me know um and there are<br>two very simple questions uh the first<br>is what's something you find interesting<br>about<br>Buddhist poetry<br>you can take that any direction you want<br>to something you find interesting<br>uh and the second question is what's<br>something you're curious about or would<br>like to know more about for Buddhist<br>poetry in Southeast Asia<br>questions make sense so the first one is<br>what's something that you find<br>interesting or cool or uh<br>distinctive about Buddhist poetry<br>and the second one being what's<br>something you'd like to learn more about<br>and feel free to just if you're on Zoom<br>to drop something in the chat no<br>pressure If you would not like to<br>participate but just giving you the<br>invitation to do so so I can get a<br>better sense of what might be<br>percolating for all of you as I I move<br>foreign<br>of course please go for it uh<br>it's like I'm interested in your<br>translation experience and you mentioned<br>in your book that you leave<br>your belief intact you just cancel it<br>you don't<br>make it<br>but you don't care if it's relevant to<br>modern world or not you leave it and I I<br>would like to know how can you do it and<br>I believe it will help in my PhD thesis<br>because it involved a lot of translation<br>as well wonderful wonderful that's a<br>fantastic question and throughout<br>because I'll be bringing up translations<br>of the text we're dealing with let's<br>keep reflecting together on you know<br>what are some of the choices that want<br>to make in Translation you know none of<br>the translations I'll be sharing are<br>definitive in any way so I think there's<br>lots of different choices we can take<br>and I think in those choices I think<br>we'll learn something methodologically<br>together so let's yeah let's keep that<br>question alive and can I ask your name<br>I'm sorry my name is<br>wonderful wonderful very nice to meet<br>you<br>I would just share up there<br>um so Jin ruli wrote about metaphors<br>used in Buddhist Poetics and their deep<br>meanings for various understandings<br>um and and also more connections and<br>links with Mahayana Buddhist poetry I<br>had the same<br>thing I was interested in metaphors and<br>similes that kind of are perennial I<br>mean it seems like other people reacted<br>um<br>a look also reacted with a heart to that<br>one so that seems to be a Common Thread<br>great<br>I remember<br>um<br>I first started hearing smote when I<br>when I was going to Cambodian Buddhist<br>temples in Dunedin in the 80s and I uh<br>the late 80s and I asked Paul Harrison<br>about it he said there was no such thing<br>as dumps<br>I shouldn't say that but it was you know<br>it wasn't done and then I realized it<br>was something special for Cambodia they<br>don't do it true that could do that no<br>yeah and it was a woman singing yes<br>in the 1980s yeah yeah yeah fantastic we<br>yeah<br>can I say one thing actually so one<br>thing that we'll we'll come back to is<br>this question of performance Melody and<br>different forms of Buddhist poetry<br>um it brings up this definitional<br>question of like what counts as song<br>what counts as poetry what counts as<br>recitation so that's one bit of it but<br>then the other part of how to how does<br>the performance practice change how we<br>read and interpret these materials<br>yeah and<br>uh the thing that interests me about<br>Buddhist poetry in Southeast Asia is<br>that only<br>um The Poetry is not only reflects what<br>we said is the main idea I'll put it<br>soon like Buddhism from India but it's<br>also reflects um what the local code is<br>in that Industries and reflect or<br>respond to to the idea from what we call<br>Indian Buddhism so it's how how Buddhism<br>local is localized by local people<br>fantastic that's a really great point<br>and that that will show up again and<br>again I think in the kinds of texts<br>we'll look at<br>um and you're you're totally right that<br>poetry is a wonderful uh lens with which<br>to think about this process of<br>localization and to think about what<br>distinct kinds of ideas or doctrines<br>show up in poetry that might not show up<br>in other kinds of Buddhist texts so that<br>might be helpful to again to keep in<br>mind as we go forward I'll just call<br>attention to lead on Lefferts because<br>he's just gone out of the screen there<br>but I can read it here it says I don't<br>know much about but it's poetry but<br>having spent considerable time working<br>with and trying to understand the<br>Dynamics of Tetley<br>isan monk singing as part of a sermon<br>I'd like to know more about more and see<br>how it interacts with other forms of<br>Buddhist sermons and Ted die<br>fantastic thank you so much uh lead him<br>so that uh<br>the question between what counts as a<br>sermon and what counts as poetry and the<br>ways in which those recitation Styles<br>interact with one another again is<br>something<br>um we'll need to come back to again and<br>again so for instance the text that I'm<br>going to be focusing on today is one<br>used for inviting monastics to give a<br>sermon and then some of the texts we'll<br>look at throughout the week are ones<br>that might be recited in a sermon<br>context<br>um some of the recitation Styles some of<br>the approaches have Parallels for to the<br>Pele or these kinds of uh sung or<br>chanted sermon styles used in<br>northeastern Thailand and other parts of<br>the broader biosphere so again that's<br>something thank you for asking that and<br>then we finally have Alexander trans<br>comment there<br>um I can read that for you if you like<br>it says I find what is poetry<br>interesting because it's an alternative<br>way of learning about Buddhist Doctrine<br>in addition to the sutras commentaries<br>Etc I definitely share that opinion and<br>I'd like to learn more about the<br>Mahayana uses of both poetry and Poetics<br>and how it might differ from those of<br>other Traditions wonderful so uh again<br>those are questions we'll come back to<br>particularly the first one the material<br>that I've selected principally for the<br>next few days is mostly coming out of<br>taravada traditions though there will be<br>some a little bit of Mahayana material<br>coming out of Vietnam and also out of an<br>early period in cambodia's history so<br>um but I think we need to I think<br>several of you are interested in that to<br>keep that question alive too even when<br>we're looking at material that we put<br>under this label of theravada how does<br>that help us understand forms of<br>Buddhism that fall outside of that as<br>well and it looks like John Marston has<br>a question here or a comment of I've<br>always been interested in the mnemonic<br>aspect of poetry the degree to which<br>poetry becomes a tool to facilitate<br>memory that's again extremely important<br>we'll see that in a number of the when<br>we look at the metrical forms of the<br>Poetry how they're structured as poetry<br>uh what kinds of patterns around tone<br>and Rhyme or number of syllables how<br>might be connected to mnemonic functions<br>as well I think there's also this<br>question about some of these poems are<br>being transmitted orally and by people<br>who aren't interacting with the written<br>form of these texts at all so there<br>there's a very strong role to memory of<br>course and then there are also other<br>forms of poetry that seem to be written<br>with their written or their visual form<br>in mind so what does that mean to go<br>across that Spectrum<br>so thank you this this is a really uh<br>Rich set of questions and and themes<br>that uh that you all are bringing to the<br>to the table that I hope to return to as<br>we move through some of the materials<br>I've selected so thank you and if you<br>have more things to add we're going to<br>keep the chat um feature open always<br>feel free to<br>um chat in a question or a comment<br>um at any time and for those of you here<br>always of course feel free to raise your<br>hand or you know I just want to make<br>this again something where we can<br>continue to learn through with each<br>other throughout the process<br>so with that in mind I'm going to move<br>on to a little bit of<br>framing what I'm I'm trying to to do in<br>the question that uh<br>I in a sense and beginning with is what<br>even is Buddhist poetry how might we<br>Define you know I'm using this term I've<br>you've been drawn to this lecture Series<br>in a sense because of this term but what<br>does it really mean and there's<br>different ways that we could understand<br>it and I think those different ways can<br>be productive and how we come to you<br>know understand this relationship<br>between Buddhism and poetry<br>so one way of understanding this of<br>course is simply Buddhist texts written<br>in verse<br>now what counts as verse and what counts<br>as prose is not something that<br>in all circumstances in Southeast Asia<br>can be clearly defined but in many cases<br>it can't there are particular metrical<br>forms that are understood as verse that<br>are understood as poetry<br>um and Buddhist texts can be transmitted<br>in those forms does that mean that those<br>texts are Buddhist poetry<br>perhaps another way of thinking about it<br>though are verse texts that have uh<br>Buddhist themes<br>so for instance there are many verse<br>texts used composed transmitted in<br>Mainland Southeast Asian context for<br>instance that are not in their overall<br>framing or in the key parts of the plot<br>or other elements something that one<br>would necessarily label is Buddhist but<br>there are never less Buddhist themes<br>showing up in those polls are those<br>works also what is poetry again let's<br>let's keep thinking about that so in<br>essence there's some dangers of using<br>this this this term Buddhist poetry<br>because we might be uh limiting<br>ourselves in the sense of we're we're<br>missing how Buddhism or Buddhist ideas<br>show up in poetry that isn't necessarily<br>labeled as Buddhist<br>um but there's also a some possibilities<br>that it opens up uh when we see that oh<br>well maybe we need to take a more<br>expansive view of what counts as<br>Buddhist in textual production in<br>Mainland southeast Asia maybe we need to<br>take a more expansive view of what<br>counts as poetry are certain types of<br>things we might ordinarily think of as<br>Pros for instance in certain kinds of<br>sermons that have these uh<br>linking Rhymes and other things that tie<br>them into a<br>verse-like structure even though overall<br>they seem to be in prose is that also a<br>form of of Buddhist poetry<br>so in essence I'm interested in when we<br>look at these intersections between<br>categories like Buddhist and poetry we<br>can begin to trace a set of encounters<br>uh between Buddhist practices and ideas<br>and as you pointed out what I mean<br>there's ideas that are ones we might<br>identify as coming out of Buddhist<br>scriptures composed in South Asia as<br>well as local kinds of ideas that are<br>being developed in Southeast Asia as<br>well as tracing encounters between<br>particular practices and ideas around<br>poetry that include uh what we mentioned<br>before around performance practices how<br>do Melodies and other elements of<br>performance fit in with these<br>definitions Etc so in summary I'm<br>interested in Buddhist poetry as as a<br>question<br>um as a generative space as a room like<br>this room here the broader Zoom room<br>that you're all in uh for for<br>conversation<br>and uh Anushka you've brought in a<br>couple of uh comments here that I think<br>are are relevant to what we were just<br>discussing you write my research is<br>unrelated to poetry but those are<br>Doctrine itself reads like poetry to me<br>uh the way is being delivered in a<br>poetic way is beautiful and to me<br>there's there's two elements there<br>there's one uh the formal elements of<br>poly prose in the sutthas<br>um how do those formal elements uh<br>can be understood as literature can be<br>understood as poetry that's that's<br>something that's coming out and then<br>also the ways that this might be<br>delivered what they might be recited or<br>used in a sermon it also entails this<br>element of aesthetic Beauty so how do we<br>see a space for aesthetic beauty within<br>how we read Buddhist texts<br>um and then the second question that you<br>bring up here Anushka is how do you<br>distinguish doctrinal content from quote<br>unquote poetry again<br>let's I can't answer that now but let's<br>keep thinking about that<br>um and we'll look at a few different<br>examples as we move through so to begin<br>to<br>open up more to these questions uh on<br>the the right side of the screen here is<br>an inscription is anyone familiar with<br>yes yes and so can you tell us a little<br>bit about the inscriptions that at what<br>poll<br>you mean this particular not not this<br>particular one uh unless you unless<br>you'd like to say something about this<br>particular one but I sort of the idea of<br>sort of all the inscriptions that what<br>poll what do they do they tell us so one<br>point is like um<br>first University<br>um<br>in Thailand so monastic University in<br>Thailand is scattered a lot of um<br>you know Innovations knowledge<br>um cultural and there are a lot of um<br>store inscriptions surrounded the temple<br>especially it's very famous for um<br>what what we call it some stretching<br>like yoga traditional<br>Thai massage<br>so<br>yeah fantastic thank you yeah so so what<br>poll or what particular one is one of<br>the most important temples from the<br>ratanakusin period or the current<br>dynasty of of Thailand the roots of the<br>temple and the site go back to the UTI<br>period but the key Renovations that led<br>to the site looking as it does today<br>come from the early retinobosi period<br>that is the late 18th early 19th century<br>um and part of those Renovations<br>included the installation of many many<br>inscriptions you know gathered in a book<br>this could be about this uh think of<br>inscription 500 pages 600 Pages or so<br>inscriptions how many descriptions yeah<br>I can't remember either but there's a<br>lot and as you mentioned some of them<br>are uh dealing with medicinal practices<br>with forms of uh<br>Yoga practices all kinds of other<br>medicinal ideas are transmitted there's<br>also a whole set of texts that are<br>dealing with forms of poetry<br>so this is within a Buddhist temple we<br>have inscriptions of how to write<br>different kinds of poems giving examples<br>of the the metrical forms and so this I<br>think provides us a good entry point to<br>thinking about this question of Buddhist<br>poetry so we're in this important<br>royally sponsored Buddhist temple in in<br>Thailand and<br>on the walls are poems and not all the<br>poems are Buddhists not all the<br>principles connected to the poems are<br>Buddhist at all<br>um what does this uh<br>mean about how we might Define Buddhist<br>poetry so let's take a closer look at<br>this inscription so you can see that<br>there's four<br>um actually four plus a fragment of a<br>fifth text at the bottom visible on on<br>the photograph and each of these is just<br>one stanza okay so let's see make sure I<br>think you can see my cursor I hope<br>um so there's one stanza there<br>another stanza here another chance there<br>and then uh one that's sort of<br>incomplete here so let's take a closer<br>look at two of these and see what it<br>might tell us about um Buddhist poetry<br>so<br>um let's start with this uh first one on<br>um some with<br>some ways in<br>what's that<br>but we<br>parallel<br>on<br>wait<br>Lambo<br>blah<br>great<br>so we'll get to the meaning of the text<br>first but let's stay at the element of<br>the visual yeah so hopefully those of<br>you on zoom and if you don't know Thai<br>script I was just trying to point where<br>we are that the cursor seems to have a<br>delay so apologies if you're<br>experiencing that what do you notice<br>looks like sound waves it kind of looks<br>like sound waves yeah that's this kind<br>of uh so it's kind of dividing these<br>different sections yeah what else do you<br>know so yeah it's just it's interesting<br>the way it's present so like um the<br>lines that the word that had been shared<br>um<br>um<br>and then connect to the next one and<br>yeah it's quite interesting<br>and so this this is a particular kind of<br>uh<br>first created for aesthetic purposes<br>um so it's given this title up here uh<br>on Chrome<br>so fooling here means something like<br>Reese or something that's woven together<br>or Garland<br>um and it's sort of here woven into four<br>different sections so we can see a<br>section here a section here a section<br>here a section there so we have this<br>sense of it as a the poem is something<br>visual not just something that exists in<br>an oral context or in a performative<br>context but something that exists on the<br>page of a manuscript or here on the wall<br>of a temple and uh what I made as you<br>pointed out the particular trick or on<br>this term Gala in Sanskrit uh pronounced<br>here refers to these<br>um<br>this artifice maybe as a way of<br>understanding this word used to create<br>poems so these very complex<br>um rules that govern how they're<br>composed so this one meaning the second<br>um syllable of each line as well as the<br>four syllable as well as the sixth<br>syllable<br>um all are the same word so that's why<br>we have them merging down into one word<br>Etc and really word is not quite the<br>right definition here because uh<br>actually everything here in the first uh<br>the first syllable uh these are not<br>complete words they're completed by the<br>second syllable of way<br>um so again we have something that's<br>really playing with sound and the visual<br>at the same time<br>and then if we look at the meeting we<br>can think about you know is this a is<br>this a Buddhist poem or not and what<br>does that mean so in terms of just<br>here the way sangwei is spelled is not<br>the way we'd expect it to be spelled<br>today but this is a<br>um we normally expected to have the<br>chatang at the end<br>um and this would be a word that is<br>related to the indic term Vega some Vega<br>that<br>that sense of being stirred or being<br>shaken by the encounter with something<br>that's impermanent<br>and so it also has the sense of have<br>have pity on or have compassion for<br>ETC like in the sense of understanding<br>something isn't permanent so again that<br>first line<br>um Quake for or be moved be stirred by<br>have pity on the satwell the the world<br>of living beings<br>that all comes to an end and then the<br>the The Dwelling Place<br>um of the surolog the surologia of the<br>heavens extends uh throughout the skies<br>extends throughout the heavens<br>um entering into the parallel the next<br>realm in other words the realm that hap<br>that living beings are born into after<br>death that is the path in which all uh<br>living beings end<br>then we have this last line which again<br>we can think about how is this working<br>in a Buddhist context so the line here<br>goes<br>sorry<br>here uh is a combination of the term<br>Shiva<br>uh which in a outside of the Buddhist<br>context would be understood as the deity<br>Shiva inside of a Buddhist context is<br>understood as the this kind of root<br>meaning of the term peace or as a<br>synonym for Nirvana plus Isha this term<br>that means Lord but in a Thai poetic<br>context can be freely combined with<br>other indic terms to create a like a<br>slightly loftier version of that term so<br>see Wade here is simply a synonym for<br>Nirvana and then<br>that exceeds that goes beyond uh the<br>world goes beyond the Earth so far up<br>and all in the heavens cannot be<br>compared to this Nirvana so thinking<br>about the meaning of this is this a<br>Buddhist poem<br>so the the meaning is pretty<br>straightforwardly about Buddhist poem<br>but yet it's transmitted in this context<br>of focusing on the set of aesthetic<br>principles to create this very ornate uh<br>structure<br>uh very different than we might<br>ordinarily see in certain kinds of<br>Buddhist contacts so let's look at the<br>the second poem here<br>um<br>so sorry is there any other way to read<br>that could you read the three middle<br>syllables and does that mean something<br>separate or is there is it there's just<br>that one Convention of reason there are<br>other kinds of poems that uh have these<br>acrostic functions particularly in a tie<br>context where sometimes you could read<br>the the whole thing normally but then<br>you could also read the first syllable<br>of each line that would have its own<br>meaning here we can't do that<br>um I don't think that yes this would not<br>form a complete set of meaning and the<br>second syllable wait doesn't have any<br>meaning on its own it's only completed<br>by the different Uber Saga these Hindi<br>prefixes that come before it<br>um so and as I understand it this is the<br>only way it can be read but there are<br>other kinds of visually<br>um specified poetic forms like this<br>where there are these alternative modes<br>of reading and we'll get to one of those<br>actually in the next one here so let's<br>take a look at this second one<br>um<br>again would someone like to read this<br>please go for it<br>foreign<br>Joy<br>soy cell more<br>Japan<br>fantastic thank you so<br>what is the form of this poem<br>even though those of you much of what<br>we'll be looking at I will have<br>translations I will have<br>transliterations I wanted us to begin by<br>just this experience of encountering<br>something that probably many of you some<br>of you are familiar with Thai poetry<br>some of you aren't but just to to enter<br>it through this space first the rest of<br>the the talks we'll be looking at things<br>in Translation and with transliteration<br>so we can we can think more together but<br>I just want to plunge us a little bit<br>into the how these kinds of texts work<br>um so those of you were just hearing<br>this you would have heard that there's<br>certain kinds of Rhymes that are<br>happening and the the basic form of<br>poetry this gone form that's behind uh<br>this is often in this eight syllables<br>per line<br>um and with a set rhyme scheme so we<br>have words like ham is rhyming word San<br>and<br>um that cheat is rhyming with<br>Etc et cetera<br>um<br>yes and then also the last the the lines<br>uh are linked together the standards are<br>linked together through Rhymes Like Nong<br>is rhyming with Mong and prong and those<br>of you who are familiar with other<br>poetic traditions in Mainland southeast<br>Asia in Vietnam and Cambodia these kinds<br>of rhyme patterns will be very familiar<br>so that's partially what's happening on<br>the surface here then it's being put<br>into this sakawa form this is a form of<br>usually oral poetry uh that where the<br>additional rules to the Forum are that<br>it has to begin with sapawa and has to<br>end with uh<br>um so it has this additional rule<br>um defining how the the poetic form<br>works but otherwise it's within this<br>um<br>basic gone form uh one that's been since<br>the middle of the 18th century at least<br>has been associated with with popular<br>poetry in Thailand and we'll look at<br>other examples of this form later and<br>what it how it works in a Buddhist<br>context<br>but before we get there<br>there's something else that's happening<br>here and this relates to your question<br>Ben was like are there different ways to<br>read this so<br>so meaning this this particular artifice<br>is the particular artificial meter going<br>um is being called now clong is another<br>kind of poetry that's quite different<br>than God<br>foreign<br>so there's definitely a set of rules<br>that are operating here and the<br>the way it relates is to the the<br>question you raised Ben is<br>there's a clone form hidden within the<br>claw<br>so this on the surface is a glomo it's<br>on the surface in one meter and then the<br>the meaning of course of this would you<br>read this as a Buddhist poem we can<br>don't have to go on the translation but<br>does it does it sound Buddhist for those<br>of you who are understand the meaning<br>I don't think I don't think so no it<br>seems to be a lament over a lover who's<br>spurned and is uh afraid that he's he's<br>lost his lever to someone else that's my<br>broadly understanding there's nothing<br>specifically Buddhist about what's going<br>on here<br>um but there's this interesting play of<br>the poetic form so if we were to read<br>and it's the second line each eight<br>syllables long Etc in this long form but<br>we could also if we cut off the sakawa<br>since that's just a formal part of the<br>the form and cut off the last bit then<br>we see hidden within this there's this<br>uh clone text uh clone text that goes<br>it<br>said<br>and then a new Converse would start so<br>the idea is that that's not the way that<br>a Quran verse would be recited it's<br>breaking up the<br>um the ordinary rules of glonn but<br>hidden within that is this whole other<br>poetic form<br>so this is just a way of opening this<br>question of this is carved into Buddhist<br>temple it's not at all a Buddhist text<br>or is it you know something that's<br>taking place within a so-called secular<br>sphere if that's something that we can<br>Define or think about for this period of<br>time<br>um might not make sense for this period<br>of time but as we look through different<br>pieces let's keep these kinds of<br>questions in mind what's happening with<br>the forms what's happening visually<br>what's happening with the recitation<br>when it's recited a particular way it<br>becomes one one style when it's just<br>another way it becomes another style<br>so what do we mean even by reading this<br>is the other part of the title reading<br>Buddhist poetry so<br>um in many different Southeast Asian<br>languages the term for reading often<br>means reading aloud that's the the basic<br>sense so<br>um when we talk about reading Buddhist<br>poetry are we reading it silently are we<br>having a silent appreciation<br>understanding what's going on certainly<br>at certain periods of Southeast Asian<br>history and in the present that's a very<br>common mode or are we talking about<br>things that are to be read or recited<br>aloud or do we mean reading in this<br>broader sense of the kind of engaged<br>analysis that in theory that's what<br>we're we're all doing here in this this<br>academic space so but let's try to keep<br>these different senses of reading alive<br>overall my goal here is to deepen our<br>aesthetic and also intellectual<br>appreciation of Buddhist poetry in in<br>Mainland southeast Asia in particular<br>and through that I hope that we can<br>discover together new ways of reading<br>texts and some of these will try to move<br>beyond the borders of traditions<br>languages particular nation states that<br>are often the way that poetic traditions<br>in particular in Southeast Asia are<br>studied and through that I hope we can<br>develop a sense of our own Curiosities<br>about the subject that's why I at the<br>beginning I'm asking you to share what's<br>what's bringing you here what questions<br>are are present for you as you work<br>through this material<br>um and then of course also we'll come up<br>with many unanswered sometimes<br>unanswerable questions and that that's<br>that's part of the process that's of<br>course Very Much germane to the study of<br>poetry writ large and of course to the<br>awesome<br>so the geographic Focus as you know for<br>this series will be on mainland's<br>southeast Asia particularly on materials<br>from Cambodia Thailand Laos in Vietnam<br>of course the sort of broader sphere of<br>what we think of Mainland Southeast Asia<br>is in interaction always with what's<br>beyond that what's what's happening in<br>the Southeast Asian archipelago but also<br>particularly what's happening in South<br>Asia and East Asia okay<br>um so to constantly think about the<br>geographic situatedness and that the<br>emplacement and time and culture and<br>language is essential to understanding<br>these texts<br>the primary languages for Buddhist poems<br>in in the region include tax written in<br>a variety of different language families<br>so some are in synitic sort of literary<br>Chinese texts um one of you mentioned or<br>two of you mentioned actually interested<br>in the place of Mayana Buddhist texts in<br>Mainland southeast Asia the the largest<br>uh surviving body of Mahayana Buddha's<br>texts composed in Southeast Asia are<br>those composed in literary Chinese and<br>also in Vietnamese<br>um in uh modern what's now Vietnam<br>um there are also texts of course<br>composed in ending languages in poly and<br>Sanskrit some composed in South Asia but<br>also many composed in Southeast Asia and<br>we'll look at some examples of those<br>um there are many different ways of<br>trying to understand what<br>um does<br>what is an indigenous language in<br>Mainland southeast Asia this is a very<br>complex question because human migration<br>and the movement of people in Southeast<br>Asia is something that's been constantly<br>in process for thousands of years so<br>some of the languages that have been<br>here<br>and in Mainland southeast Asia for<br>longer include those of the<br>austro-asiatic family including<br>languages like Mon and Khmer or crying<br>and Vietnamese<br>some of the languages that came a little<br>bit later to the region<br>um are those in the southwestern by<br>families such as Thai or Lao or Lama or<br>Chan kunmu<br>et cetera and then also those in the<br>spermish family Burmese or econis Etc I<br>don't<br>um know Burmese I reckonies and we won't<br>be looking at poems there but if you are<br>familiar with those Traditions I'd love<br>to bring your thoughts in on how they<br>might interact with some of the<br>materials we'll be looking at<br>foreign<br>that I want to take us through today is<br>one that<br>looks at this question of language in<br>the formation and transmission of<br>Buddhist poetry in Mainland southeast<br>Asia and that as you saw in the abstract<br>that's the overall theme for the lecture<br>today<br>and uh there I wrote that many Buddhist<br>poems from Southeast Asia are products<br>of an interconnected web of translations<br>between languages across the region over<br>a period of centuries sort of what I've<br>tried to visually represent here this is<br>different<br>um<br>scripts and translation of this one<br>particular text for the invitation of a<br>monastic to preach that we'll be looking<br>at today<br>um this is again this way of thinking<br>about how language is present in this<br>process of translation between different<br>languages in Southeast Asia so one<br>question I'll be asking and how do these<br>historical and linguistic layers affect<br>how we read Buddhist poems in other<br>words is it possible to read a Buddhist<br>poem Only in one particular linguistic<br>and temporal instantiation or do we have<br>to understand it across the broader<br>sweep of time in which it has been<br>transmitted<br>and so here as I uh Trace examples of<br>this polychant as it uh transforms<br>throughout its translations into Thai<br>into Kumai into Vietnamese<br>um I'm hoping we can develop a sense of<br>this interplay between languages and how<br>that shapes the ways in which Buddhist<br>texts are produced as well as performed<br>the image here is from a temporal mural<br>at uh Watson this mural is now since<br>been destroyed in the renovation of this<br>particular Temple um<br>but uh it shows well actually before I<br>s from uh invited yes<br>fantastic and how do we know this is<br>Brahma<br>yes so we can't see the head in the back<br>but we can assume that there's one more<br>head in the back that we see one more<br>face I'm sorry in the back that this is<br>the four-faced<br>um depiction of Brahma which is a very<br>common iconographical depiction of<br>Brahma<br>um in uh Cambodian Thai and Lao cultures<br>in particular and he is inviting the<br>what is he inviting the Buddha to do<br>to preach and why why doesn't doesn't<br>the Buddha just want to preach the<br>diamond what's going on what's the story<br>he realized it's as fully hard to teach<br>other sentient being<br>3 or 10 nibana to Enlighten so it's a<br>real end of mind but<br>um and<br>Brahma<br>um<br>it's just you know and then says descent<br>and<br>invited to Buddha there is a there's<br>some people who has a<br>um who has the latest delusion or<br>um some of them some of them has too<br>much illusion in the mind some did not<br>so<br>so the Buddha can teach those who are<br>ready for it for a deep enlargement<br>beautiful fantastic and we're as we look<br>through different instantiations the<br>text we'll see different elements of the<br>themes you raised like the Buddha's<br>reluctance the idea that living beings<br>are mired and delusion the idea that<br>some beings are perhaps more suitable to<br>receiving uh teachings from the Buddha<br>et cetera these will all show up in the<br>the tax that we explore but that's<br>absolutely right this is the the basic<br>story that this this image is is<br>representing so the core verse that's<br>associated with this story is<br>um<br>one that comes it's actually the very<br>first verse<br>has been<br>um there's some debate about when<br>exactly this text would have been<br>composed<br>um some have argued that it's a<br>relatively late addition to the Pali<br>uh body of scriptures<br>um and has some linguistic features that<br>place it in that somewhat later<br>development of text as well as doctrinal<br>features and in essence is the the story<br>of or the lineage of of different<br>Buddhas how they um came to awaken Etc<br>and sort of it's it's very key text for<br>pudology budology in the sense of<br>studying what the meaning of Buddhas are<br>tracing the lineage of Buddhas in the<br>taravada tradition but it's this very<br>first verse that's been excerpted from<br>that and used in a ritual context quite<br>commonly across the at least in<br>Cambodian Thailand Laos in Vietnam in<br>teravada context I don't know for<br>instance in a Sri Lankan context if this<br>is if this verse is used<br>um there may be other ways in which<br>monastics would be invited to preach or<br>I don't actually don't know to what<br>extent it shows up in a Burmese context<br>of course the text of the Buddha bangsa<br>is very much known in both of those<br>locations but there's maybe something<br>distinctive that's happening within the<br>Cambodian Thai Lao and then later in the<br>Vietnamese context around this verse<br>so when this uh text is recited<br>um usually there's a certain Melody<br>that's given to it that Melody may<br>depend on the particular cultural<br>context the one I've described<br>transcribed the musical notation here is<br>one that's commonly used in Thailand<br>though there are a variety of different<br>Melodies that are used in Thailand and<br>so one realization of the melody is<br>there are a variety of other Melodies<br>that might be applied<br>foreign<br>to that Melody later because it's one<br>that shows up in the Kamai translation<br>of this this text as well<br>um<br>but first let's just take a little bit<br>of a look at the the initial polystanza<br>this some of the findings here that I'll<br>be sharing come from this article that I<br>published in 2020 in the Journal of<br>Vietnamese studies called a chant has<br>nine lives circulation of terabonda<br>liturgies in Thailand Cambodia and<br>Vietnam and if you're interested in some<br>of the details of these texts feel free<br>to check um that out<br>um uh there's a you can freely there's a<br>PDF accessible on my website<br>um that article is more concerned with<br>what this shows historically around the<br>founding of the this particular<br>um terabada tradition among ethnic<br>Vietnamese communities in Vietnam so<br>that I won't be talking about as much<br>today but<br>um using it as a way to again bring us<br>into how the transmission of Buddhist<br>poems across languages reveals something<br>about how we might want to read them<br>so looking at this poly uh verse<br>initially again this uh almost all uh<br>poetry in Pali is divided into uh four<br>lines uh for bada in this context<br>um and together forming one verse<br>sometimes we've heard it was a godha<br>and uh there's a particular metrical uh<br>pattern that's being used here and go<br>there is some variations in the<br>transmission of this text as well as<br>some problems if we try to scan it<br>metrically but in essence poly poetry<br>for those who are not familiar with it<br>just like in Sanskrit poetry the basic<br>structure of what makes a poem a poem is<br>that it's divided into lines in these<br>ways and that the lines have particular<br>patterns of short and long syllables<br>so that means that this generates a<br>just on the basis of those short and<br>long syllables<br>um again there's some variations in this<br>the Southeast Asian version the meter<br>has been smoothed out a little bit<br>um uh so that this compound instead of<br>another<br>but uh this these kinds of patterns are<br>common when a text is being recited in<br>this way in other words the very process<br>of recitation and an effort to make it<br>as easy and clear as possible to recite<br>and to fit in within Melodies may cause<br>some minor changes to develop in police<br>texts so that there's this harmonization<br>between the text and its performance<br>practice but this is in essence the The<br>Narrative that you describe for us uh<br>what I made this is this is Brahma<br>appealing to put the saying some of the<br>beings here even though many of them are<br>filled with the diamonds some have just<br>minor ones this is this compound<br>um<br>Sanskrit this kind of lesser and then<br>this term<br>can be understood in a couple ways one<br>it can be understood is those whose eyes<br>a cup have Raja have pollution in them<br>or it can be understood as those who are<br>polluted with namely the Rajesh and then<br>just like in other kinds of verbal<br>forming nominal formations in Pali and<br>Sanskrit this can be a derivative of<br>grudges<br>two ways of understanding but the same<br>basic idea of beings with minor<br>defilements and then asking the Buddha<br>to preach<br>um having Mercy for this generation for<br>this this particular group this body of<br>living beings<br>so this is something that we don't have<br>a clear historical idea when it was<br>first used as a tax to invite a monastic<br>to preach<br>um but at a certain point<br>um talks like these began to be<br>translated into different Southeast<br>Asian vernaculars so this is one of the<br>oldest versions I was able to find this<br>is not this is translated into Thai but<br>it's not the usual version that one<br>would see translate into Thai<br>this is a re a transcription of an oral<br>version that was preserved on a now<br>defunct Buddhist web board in Thailand<br>so I don't have any further Evidence<br>about where this comes from but uh<br>linguistically it's older than the the<br>most common version uh used today for<br>this purpose in Thailand<br>um and there are you know aspects about<br>the way the meter works here that's uh<br>a bit complex we don't need to go into<br>that now for now I would uh just have us<br>look at what's happening in terms of the<br>the meaning here what might be uh<br>staying the same or what might be being<br>transformed so of course the way that<br>this has been translated into Thai we<br>see that it's not just one stands<br>anymore it's suddenly now five so<br>there's been an expansion details have<br>been added that have uh<br>that are corresponding to how the<br>translators understanding what's<br>happening within the polytext<br>the other thing and we'll look at this<br>when we look at the slightly more recent<br>Thai translation as well is that the<br>meter that's been chosen this is a meter<br>known as<br>though it has some features of certain<br>chat or these other kinds of more<br>elaborate meters and Thai as well<br>um is is one that can be recited with<br>the same uh Melody as one might use for<br>the poly so there's this attempt in<br>Translation to harmonize the performance<br>practices uh between these texts<br>um and so<br>even when we look at uh say this the the<br>so there's a uh that Rhythm that's being<br>built into it uh Rhythm we can<br>understand is two plus three and then<br>three plus three let me um<br>put the cursor on the romanization here<br>so<br>um I'm here being the initial two<br>syllables and then we have three<br>syllables<br>and then again we have uh then for the<br>second line we have three syllables<br>um<br>and then again we have some<br>hypermetrical syllables here for these<br>unstressed syllables that's very common<br>um and then again we have the pattern<br>and again because it's happening within<br>again there's some hypermetrical<br>syllables Happening Here Again very very<br>common if you're counting some of you<br>are looking at you're counting with this<br>doesn't add up to five and six it<br>doesn't add up to 11. it's not adding<br>the way it should be and that's<br>um uh it's really following on how the<br>performer realizes which syllables are<br>unstressed and therefore not counting<br>towards that syllable count<br>um so this is something that we see in<br>in Thai Lao and my poetry in particular<br>this is not a feature as much in<br>Vietnamese poetry when we look later<br>when Vietnamese poetry is structured by<br>syllable count in some of these<br>traditional forms generally it's not<br>possible to insert a hypermetrical<br>syllable but in the Thai Lao and my<br>context in very common to have this and<br>that's again why the melody is so<br>important because it ties together the<br>performance even across attacks that<br>might appear uneven in its metrical<br>realization<br>then when we look at the meaning perhaps<br>it's the same thing just expanded in<br>some way we we are introduced to Brahma<br>um<br>uh then he presses his palms together in<br>the second syllable<br>um and asks for or makes this request to<br>the the Buddha here being described as<br>the um the 10 powered Lord<br>and then we have the substance of his<br>request<br>um saying that there are beings in the<br>universe who are dull and then those who<br>are racked with defilement but please<br>um preach so that you might be able to<br>to save them so they some of those<br>beings might be able to reach their<br>bottom so the same basic meaning but<br>encapsulated in this other form if we<br>look now to the this more recent Thai<br>translation and this is the one that one<br>would more commonly hear in a Thai<br>context today<br>um again if we transcribe the musically<br>what's happening in the melody<br>that same Melody<br>with some minor changes due to how the<br>tones of Thai cause minor changes to<br>occur in the melody when these kinds of<br>attacks are recited we see that the<br>poetic form that's<br>chosened meter is one that allows to<br>retain this kind of performative parity<br>with what's happening in Nepali<br>and the meaning here the the way the the<br>this particular version in Thai is is<br>uses simpler vocabulary more common and<br>more present day vocabulary than the<br>previous text it also scans a little bit<br>more easily there's not as many<br>hypermetrical syllables and that those<br>are some of the reasons I can imagine<br>that this has been the one that by<br>consensus is more often used in a tie<br>context for this purpose but we see that<br>the meaning is essentially the same we<br>and what is he doing he's bowing down<br>before the Buddha to make this request<br>and then we have the three stanzas of<br>this request<br>um<br>uh this is now stanza four and five uh<br>four is completing the request and then<br>we have uh something that wasn't there<br>in the previous two versions and isn't<br>in the poly version at all that is that<br>to put the<br>um accepted uh this request<br>um and ascended to the Brahma deity on<br>um and then we have something that we<br>didn't see at all in the last two<br>versions either and this is where we're<br>suddenly moved out of the narrative<br>frame of uh Brahma long ago inviting the<br>Buddha to the very present so that's the<br>we invite you o venerable you who are<br>comparable to the Victor that is to the<br>Buddha save beings and spread the karmas<br>who has to illuminate and Enlighten in<br>other words this this invitation to the<br>venerable prakutan here means the<br>monastic in the present moment who is<br>the one being invited to preach so the<br>uh in other words the comparison here is<br>just as the Buddha was uh<br>out of compassion<br>uh<br>was uh agreed to preach for the sake of<br>living beings so too should you oh<br>venerable uh monastic and generally<br>speaking this would be for a monk and<br>some uh recent contexts it can also be<br>used for bikuni as well<br>um but uh<br>that uh monastic is being compared in a<br>sense and this is how it's brought into<br>this ritual present and we'll see as<br>this text Journeys throughout these<br>different lives in Southeast Asia how<br>this portion the portion that connects<br>into uh the very concrete ritual<br>manifestation of what's happening in the<br>narrative is one that gets increasingly<br>expanded<br>so the next stage in the development of<br>this text historically these two Thai<br>versions probably date from the 18th<br>century or so but they're part of this<br>broader body of short poems in Thai that<br>are used in Buddhist contexts that are<br>rarely recorded in palm leaf manuscripts<br>sometimes they're recorded in paper<br>manuscripts that record some of these<br>more informal kinds of texts but they're<br>almost always Anonymous and it's very<br>difficult to historically Trace where<br>they come from but they're part of this<br>question as you mentioned uh what I made<br>about how do we understand the the<br>localization of Buddhism it's not just<br>happening through these longer tax often<br>composed in Elite settings that are<br>maybe more easily accessible in<br>manuscript Traditions but also those<br>that were often only recited orally that<br>might be passed down in an oral context<br>this case recited really only by lay<br>people<br>um and at certain points in history<br>would have been today it's more common<br>to have women recite this text I don't<br>know how far that tradition goes back<br>into the past<br>um but at the very least it's one that's<br>so now I'd like to to move on to this<br>this second expansion of of the poly<br>verse so we have that original first<br>verse if you remember the one that was<br>the first verse of the the Buddha and<br>it's been translated into Thai in these<br>various ways<br>at some point later on again we don't<br>know this could be in the 18th century<br>it could have been several centuries<br>earlier than that but it the at least by<br>the 18th century this verse was composed<br>again I'm not aware of evidence for it<br>outside of Cambodia Thailand Laos so my<br>guess is that it was composed somewhere<br>um in one of the areas in which<br>polytextual production was important<br>during the last uh five or 600 years in<br>Maine in in Cambodia Thailand Laos so<br>most likely in central Thailand or<br>Northern Thailand but it could have been<br>composed elsewhere as well<br>and this one introduces a simile around<br>the the nature of the the Dharma and uh<br>the the verse goes it's sort of<br>continuing in the same poetic style as<br>the first verse the one from but this<br>was really uh one that expands<br>specifically for this the meaning of the<br>the drum of the true Dharma whose frame<br>is the vinya whose straps are the whose<br>leather head is the epitome striking<br>this drum whose Mallet is the four<br>truths awaken those fit to be led in the<br>midst of the assembly and the earliest<br>evidence we have that I've seen for this<br>this text is uh from a<br>um<br>an early collection of uh<br>chance that was gathered I think during<br>the first or second Reign you may know<br>this connection better first or second<br>made you respond first first reign of<br>course so uh late 18th century<br>um and it was published later on Asus<br>but originally he was a palm leaf<br>manuscript<br>um and uh this is the sort of earliest<br>example of this particular text<br>um and<br>I just wanted to before we look at how<br>it gets translated into Thai and how it<br>gets expanded in various ways this image<br>here is of a uh drum would any is it a<br>little too small to read up there so it<br>says so<br>no um<br>it's forbidden to uh hit this drum uh<br>not for an official purpose sort of out<br>of play or for fun<br>and then it gives the this gloss of like<br>what's going on this is this word for<br>inviting a monk to preach which is the<br>very context of this verse we're looking<br>at so<br>um drum is not allowed to be used<br>playfully that's only to be struck uh<br>for at the time in which a monk is<br>giving a sermon so<br>we have a physical object that's sort of<br>tying in how this particular poem is is<br>used<br>then the earliest translation we have of<br>the<br>translated chance the dating from the<br>first Reign and the style of translation<br>here is uh what another context I would<br>call a bite text it's a it combines<br>portions in poly with portions in a<br>vernacular language in this case Thai<br>here alternating phrase by phrase in<br>some cases word by word to give a a very<br>close literal translation of what's<br>happening in the poly how it's intended<br>to be understood by the compiler of this<br>by text so<br>um this is a sense the same meaning that<br>we saw in the English translation but<br>this is simply the earliest way in which<br>gets um it's been uh used because this<br>is a book of of chance and and their<br>translations we don't know about the<br>exact performance practice it's not<br>terribly common in most contexts in<br>Thailand today for<br>buy texts to be recited outside of a<br>sermon context in other words for those<br>for them to be recited in this<br>liturgical way or to invite a monastic<br>to preach in this kind of bilingual<br>alternating words and phrases but it may<br>be that that was something that occurred<br>in the past or that this was used as a<br>text for the study of these kinds of<br>chances this we don't fully know<br>um but in any case this verse came to be<br>particularly important with the<br>Cambodian translations and adaptations<br>of uh these poems so that's where I'm<br>going to turn to next<br>um before I get there and we'll look at<br>some of the the manuscripts in which<br>these Cambodian versions are found<br>um we have also been going for about an<br>hour and you may have some questions<br>um or I may want to have a sip of water<br>and<br>um but I just want to make sure that I'm<br>not purely talking to you without there<br>being some interact active part of this<br>so if you have any questions now feel<br>free to put them in the chat you can<br>also I don't know if it's possible to<br>really see the hands yeah I think you<br>can speak so you can simply unmute<br>yourself and speak if you'd like<br>um I always find that really<br>intimidating when I am a participant on<br>a zoom event so I'm figuring out how to<br>so okay so what I'm reminding of is that<br>this is very much in the Mahayana<br>tradition where you Bang the Drum<br>um yeah that's a very good point<br>yes so in in a Mahayana liturgical<br>context say in in China in Vietnam in<br>Japan and Korea the recitation of<br>Buddhist tax is very very frequently<br>accompanied by uh the beating of of this<br>usually object that's shaped like kind<br>of a like a fish made out of wood uh<br>known as in in Vietnamese<br>um I think in Japanese this kind of uh<br>object that keeps time and then there<br>are other kinds of drums that might be<br>used for marking time within a monastery<br>other kinds of ritual settings as well<br>um but it's very rare in a terravata<br>context<br>again there are Exceptions there are<br>ways in which drums appear and certain<br>forms of chanting in Sri Lanka the way<br>they might appear in other forms of of<br>uh but it's not super common for the the<br>drum to accompany Every Beat and again<br>this is not what's being uh suggested<br>here that the drum with literate be used<br>for every beat and this image of a drum<br>here again this would be used I think to<br>announce that the sermon is to happen or<br>to a part of this ritual invitation not<br>to uh Mark time while chanting and<br>certainly not to drown out the preacher<br>whilst he is preaching yeah it's pretty<br>nice<br>I mean what about isan I'm just think<br>it's it's came across my life that's<br>somewhat that's important use the drum<br>but it use call<br>yes yes Kong it's<br>um I mean<br>yeah it's just interested in the<br>metaphor that they use here<br>so um there's probably suggests why they<br>make the call like there is the frame<br>there's like something like this the<br>reason why they they missed the call<br>um<br>the shape of the drum like this so a<br>calm a Kong is usually what we would<br>translate it as a Gong a metal it's a<br>metal<br>um percussion instrument that one hits<br>with a big Mallet<br>um usually this term drum is used for<br>things that have a leather pad or other<br>kinds of uh vibrating head as opposed to<br>the whole instrument like the Kong the<br>whole instrument vibrates in this way<br>but I think that's really interesting to<br>point out that it also has this Frame it<br>also you know has some of these kind of<br>elements just like a drum of course has<br>a head has a frame has these uh straps<br>this particular drum isn't one that's<br>tied with straps but other kinds of<br>drums would be particularly drums in a<br>South Asian context often are tied<br>together with straps Etc that holds the<br>resin in chamber together and they use<br>more drums like in low<br>right I think in Nissan blouse they use<br>common middle drum<br>and particularly to Mark time yeah and<br>to say like now is the time for people<br>to come to chant now is the uh and I was<br>paying now is the time to eat lunch<br>um are the enemies coming get ready yeah<br>oh yeah no I know I'm like temperature<br>calm they have a lot of the drum thing<br>that was<br>because they were scared<br>yes yes<br>some music so there's more percussion<br>than music it's more common perhaps than<br>it is now<br>um<br>no um yeah but what interests me is that<br>the metaphor they compare yes<br>um<br>the frame or the drum or<br>the strings with the fourth screws so<br>it's it's quite common for um so I I<br>found something that used<br>some metaphor but it's in vernacular<br>it's it's it's in um<br>vernacular meditation manual it's used<br>like they compare the body of the<br>practitioner like the role of the the<br>Sangha compared to the winaya or<br>something like other build with the two<br>trousers<br>that's a really good point yes it's<br>really interesting yes that's a very key<br>metaphor in the traditional meditation<br>systems of Southeast Asia connecting the<br>different elements of the monastic road<br>to different parts of the Buddha<br>scriptures for sure I mean there is some<br>element you know this idea there's there<br>is um<br>some double entender is going on in<br>Nepali there that would you could<br>interpret some of that right the idea of<br>Sutra as bandum also has that oh yeah<br>tying it you know but you know there's<br>there's double entenderism at play<br>absolutely yeah<br>that's a great point I never thought<br>so one term we'll come back to is this<br>term in the last line here<br>this term<br>um is one that gets commentarily<br>expanded upon uh later on so literally<br>it's the sense of those fit to be led<br>but it's part of this broader<br>commentarial level distinction between<br>the four types of of living beings<br>um this also gets expanded in a Mahayana<br>Buddhist context as well but here we're<br>seeing this<br>instantiation of this idea of<br>uh here I think it's in the<br>um<br>it's in the accusative<br>of the am I trying to say<br>but that's how I was understanding it<br>but but<br>forgive me sorry I'm not um thinking<br>clearly about uh how this is being<br>translated let's let's take a look at<br>the by text and how how are they<br>understanding this term and we can see<br>whether this makes sense<br>um so<br>it's understanding it as an accusative<br>but but grammatically is it locative I<br>will I will think about this more and<br>tomorrow I'll uh and you should think<br>about it more and we can we can decide<br>what's going on<br>um here it's being translated as if it's<br>so uh let's move on now unless there are<br>further questions from those of you in<br>the audience and on in the zoom overs uh<br>um let's let's move on to uh how this<br>text evolves and changes in a Cambodian<br>context so<br>um there are various versions of a<br>chance used for uh inviting monastic to<br>to preach<br>um and within a Cambodian context and<br>the most common version is actually not<br>the one we're looking at the image of<br>here this is from a manuscript the<br>manuscript itself dates I think from the<br>late 19th century but it was<br>subsequently added on in the early 20th<br>century with additional writing it's<br>from<br>Province from<br>what song I Believe<br>and it includes this version of a uh<br>this particular<br>translation of these two stanzas in poly<br>that I wasn't familiar with before<br>except through<br>um a a very learned uh lay person and<br>scholar in Cambodia<br>sadly passed away a few years ago<br>um but who who had also memorized uh<br>this text and had his own oral version<br>um of it but this is one uh written<br>version of this translation and when we<br>look at it<br>um we can see that it's also a<br>translation of these same two verses in<br>other words the original one coming from<br>the bangsa and then this later version<br>composed sometime in the past 500 years<br>in mainland's Southeast Asia<br>and the the text is in this the<br>equivalent meter as the the Thai<br>translations we were looking at so one<br>thing that's quite interesting across<br>certain<br>um bodies of poetry in Southeast Asia<br>there are some meters that are shared<br>even though friends instance Kai is in<br>this australasiatic language family and<br>Thai is in the southwestern Side branch<br>of the broader godai family they still<br>are able to share some poetic meters so<br>these particular sets of meters known as<br>in Thai appeared to be borrowed from<br>from Kamai at some point<br>um and that's why we also of course see<br>them in Kamai and so the parallel to<br>this<br>meter in Thai is known as the meter in<br>Thai means something like<br>brahmas and then plus<br>um<br>is the usual way in which this is<br>understood but it's the same<br>um basic structure without of course any<br>tone rules uh that there's one tone rule<br>that exists in the Thai version but<br>since my total language there are no<br>rules in the this particular meter but<br>it still has this basic structure of<br>five syllables six syllables five<br>syllables six syllables uh for a total<br>of 22. and then typically those are<br>divide them in terms of how we<br>understand the meaning into two three<br>Etc<br>and looking at the meeting we have<br>basically the same sense but this has<br>been expanded this text I forget exactly<br>how long it is but it's something like<br>between 20 and 25 stanzas I haven't put<br>the whole thing up but it's it goes uh<br>and it expands upon many of the the<br>tales that we saw in the Thai versions<br>of which it was probably inspired by in<br>some sense as well as trying to bring<br>out the meaning in the various uh<br>aspects of those two quite dense poly<br>verses so we have this expansion the<br>idea of uh how this term is meant to be<br>understood and here we have it very<br>clearly referring to this grudges in the<br>just in the in the eye so we have this<br>phrase here<br>sorry<br>like as if dust in layers of silt taken<br>um and this gets<br>um again uh expanded in various ways<br>particularly around the theme of what<br>does it mean for living beings to be<br>mired in this state of delusion and here<br>it uses some of the poetic techniques<br>that be became quite important by this<br>period in in my literature namely this<br>kind of assonance and alliteration that<br>develops across these lines that go<br>above and beyond uh the existing rhyme<br>scheme so if we look just at how some of<br>the uh both there's this external rhyme<br>scheme the external rhyme in here means<br>the Rhymes that link different lines<br>together so we have home here writing<br>with room we have Kaya rhyming with<br>pragnya uh we have writing with and I'm<br>not and then we have GA rhyming with gra<br>and satwa and mole Etc so the Rhymes as<br>you might have heard are not not always<br>perfect rhymes from the modern<br>definition of Cambodian poetry but<br>within this context these were<br>understood as as rhyming in a particular<br>way so that's the external Rhymes in<br>other words ones that tie different<br>lines together as well as tie different<br>stanzas together into this long thread<br>of continuous rhyme then there are also<br>forms of internal rhyme that could be uh<br>Etc or they could be places that have<br>this kind of alliteration happening so<br>certainly phrases like room or even the<br>way the moha and the mo here uh come<br>together<br>as expressing<br>um<br>a kind of play on sounds that's very<br>important in this to this type of<br>literature so that's something we see<br>here it's not as developed as in the<br>next translation we'll look like that<br>but it's uh something certainly that's<br>coming across and then we have going to<br>the second<br>um polystanza we have this these key<br>ideas being reflected in the Kamai as<br>well<br>that karma is like into a drum<br>gong whose booms and beats uh<br>with round and lovely tones Etc and then<br>again continuing with the this the<br>metaphor that was explained around the<br>sutrist the paramata here is the synonym<br>for the dhamma<br>um etc etc and then the last stanza here<br>that's added there's a portion that I<br>skipped because it's fragmentary and all<br>the available manuscripts<br>um is the one that brings it<br>um in a sense back to this present<br>context<br>um a present context of listening to a<br>should anyone be able to listen<br>attentively without lapsing this is the<br>most meritorious and fortunate may your<br>minds be of clear Faith so it's not<br>about the invitation of the monk per se<br>but it's about the context of listening<br>to the sermon and again that's something<br>that's being added in this process as<br>there's this harmony across the text the<br>performance uh and the melody<br>can you just remind us briefly of the<br>the manuscript like the physical<br>specimen like where you've found it and<br>what Assurance yeah so this is uh this<br>one again is from uh<br>which is in central Cambodia to the<br>north east of of problem up the megong<br>river little bit and uh it's this<br>particular manuscript is one on a format<br>namely it's this kind of uh Fork hope<br>paper<br>um from<br>various trees within the Mulberry<br>um that are uh processed into this pulp<br>and then made into very long strips<br>which are then folded in this<br>accordion-like format that we we see<br>here so<br>uh in the Cambodian context in this<br>period besides the an English term for<br>this is leparello<br>um or sometimes a concertina folding<br>manuscript<br>um the<br>some were used in a lead context like in<br>the palace and they they are the quality<br>of the paper and they might be<br>um done in black and then written on<br>with gold ink or with chalk or other<br>kinds of things<br>outside of this this is from a temple in<br>the countryside this is the most common<br>format and unlike for text transmitted<br>on palm leaf manuscripts which tend to<br>be longer texts tend to be more formal<br>texts tend to be texts either used for<br>monastic uh recitation or for sermons or<br>for studies uh done within the monastery<br>these kinds of uh paper leparellos are<br>often used to transmit very short texts<br>informal texts and sometimes have<br>multiple scribes that are working within<br>them so that's why again we see here<br>multiple hands people have different<br>handwriting using different uh writing<br>implements you know people adding their<br>own notes and sometimes graffiti to<br>different portions of it this is a text<br>that's been used and passed around a lot<br>so these are burn marks from incense and<br>candles because it was used in a Time<br>prior to electric lighting<br>these kinds of uh manuscripts are often<br>circulated at the Village level in other<br>words they're not not just stored at the<br>monastery but they might be moving from<br>house to house they can be borrowed they<br>have colophons to indicate how they were<br>in in motion so why they're important<br>for the study of Buddhist poetry is that<br>in the Cambodian context and you see<br>some parallels to these kinds of<br>manuscripts in Thailand as well this is<br>where these short Buddhist liturgical<br>poems are recorded they don't show up in<br>the by and large in the larger more<br>formal manuscript collections on<br>politics but they appear in these in<br>these places so they're a window a kind<br>of a bridge between the the written and<br>the oral Traditions as well<br>so that's the particular context for<br>this poem<br>um again probably 18th or 19th century<br>when this this example the was composed<br>but by an anonymous author<br>um moving on to this next example<br>um this uh we have a brief interlude<br>this is an image of uh King monkwood<br>Rama IV<br>um he composed this text when he was a<br>monastic this is not a picture of him<br>when he was a monastic because he was a<br>monastic before photographic technology<br>was available in Sam but this is him<br>later in life when reigning his King<br>taking<br>um must be taking the white robes on a<br>precept day<br>um but this this he presumably composed<br>early earlier in his life as a monastic<br>and is an expansion this is actually the<br>last stance of a longer set of<br>expansion into Pali of this chant for<br>inviting a monastic to preach this is<br>just the very last chance<br>but it conveys some of the key ideas and<br>is composed in this distinctive uh poly<br>voice that that he developed through his<br>long years of composing uh new Buddhist<br>texts in Pali for the Tamil<br>this isn't a much simpler meter this is<br>in the very common<br>um Pali version of the shlokometer which<br>has various names in one of the common<br>names for it<br>um but that's very what's the most<br>common meter that uh King monk would<br>um<br>compose polytext and on absolutely<br>indeed the most common meter for<br>polytext composition in Southeast Asia<br>in general but again we see the way this<br>is being composed to build on the<br>earlier text from the buddhavangsa but<br>to tie it into this specific ritual<br>context so let's see what happens by the<br>end of the 19th century the early 20th<br>century we have another named uh poet<br>attached to a particular text and this<br>poet is<br>this is one of the most important poets<br>in Cambodia from the late uh 19th and<br>early 20th centuries he studied for a<br>long time<br>both in Cambodia and in Thailand<br>initially as a monk later as a lay<br>person<br>um and was a Mastery of a range of<br>different poetic forms translated many<br>texts from Pali and Thai into<br>um into Kauai and also composed the<br>whole body of original poetry and prose<br>texts that really uh set a standard for<br>what was possible in my Pro poetry at<br>that time<br>um so lots to explore about the for<br>instance the prose writings of<br>Southampton explored quite deeply in the<br>PHD a dissertation and also the fifth<br>chapter of uh Ann Hansen's book how to<br>behave<br>um but there are other ways to explore<br>what's going on within his work uh his<br>poetic writing in my view and we'll see<br>this when we look at uh his travel<br>poetry in this genre known as nirea and<br>Khmer mirat and Thai he was quite um<br>I think influenced by the uh and just an<br>earlier generation maybe actually maybe<br>two generations earlier uh Thai poet uh<br>whose work we will also look at uh in a<br>later lecture this week<br>um and we see that in the the way he was<br>able to master these particular poetic<br>forms and bring in these ideas around uh<br>assonance or euphony that that that tied<br>the the the sound of these poetic lines<br>with their meaning together in a really<br>powerful way so this is um this is a<br>translation coming out of<br>um until Nirvana's time and this uh<br>shows the first initial section of the<br>text<br>um and see it's but it's very similar to<br>what's coming before in terms of the the<br>meaning but this whole text to 26 dances<br>is probably the the longest of all of<br>these in this this genre it's sort of<br>the one that's so far that's<br>um expanded the ideas within that<br>initial poly verse in the most numerous<br>ways so let's take a closer look at<br>what's going on here so uh again we are<br>introduced to to Brahma who makes this<br>request and then the substance of his<br>request is quite long<br>he says how this the situation that<br>living beings Iran some creatures are<br>Laden with lusts unable to grasp the<br>three marks others are ready to<br>comprehend thanks to your power or<br>blessed one if they could hear you teach<br>the truth their wisdom would grow and<br>strengthen depth please a meritorious<br>Lord and humbly invite you to preach and<br>that in a sense here this is still the<br>translation of that verse first but then<br>we get this expansion that isn't really<br>in Nepali at all but offers this other<br>uh depth to what's happening so here you<br>can see it um<br>with uh what's happening in the<br>transliteration and the uh the<br>translation so starting from this part<br>uh which is save leaving beans and<br>slaves<br>save living beings and slay their sorrow<br>their sickness their passion their<br>thirst for flesh that the darkness might<br>brighten into faith and deepen with<br>wisdom to reach the truth worldly Realms<br>are fleeting wastes samsara's wheel<br>quarrels Without End ignorance is the<br>fundamental cause that sets in motion a<br>chain of effects<br>it leads living beings to suffer to<br>drown in cycles of birth and death the<br>five morals and blind delusion wrap them<br>tight till they're stuck fast and here<br>we get this sense and that last line of<br>how he's using these techniques of<br>internal rhyme on that line wrap them<br>in some cases borrowing uh you know<br>words that might be used in a Thai<br>context in this case from from time that<br>means to wrap to cover uh this is very<br>rarely used in Kamai but here it fits<br>this context because<br>meaning Tyler here and again this we<br>have internal Riot and happening in<br>terms of consonants<br>in terms of vowels again with and then<br>again back with consonants<br>and these this kind of technique with<br>which is we see all over the place for<br>instance an earlier Thai Glon poetry<br>particularly that of sunton pool from<br>the<br>who flourished in the beginning of the<br>19th century uh we see this uh developed<br>to its apogee in the work of uh Satanta<br>pritian so<br>he again expands this idea of you know<br>what does it mean to be saving living<br>beings and he brings in this other<br>metaphor we have the metaphor uh we'll<br>we'll show up soon again around the drum<br>here's this metaphor of the boat the<br>idea is that the Buddha's teachings with<br>the Buddha or the Buddhist religion is<br>in some cases a vessel that can Ferry<br>living beings to the far short the far<br>shore of Nirvana<br>um and then this boat is described in<br>particular ways the image of this boat<br>and the ways in which the boat is<br>understood again back to a point you<br>raised what I made that's connected to<br>ideas in the esoteric meditation systems<br>of Southeast Asia as well but there are<br>also ways in which this bull imagery<br>appears throughout<br>um uh teravada and Mahayana attacks as<br>well as if on a water Lantern fasts the<br>sky with fractal arrays of dazzling<br>light to illuminate all living beings<br>that they might know through peace and<br>joy and even as he's trying to bring in<br>and Entune these meanings to what he's<br>going on he also has this superb control<br>bringing the the residents of these<br>different levels of external uh external<br>um<br>again that uh expanded section on the<br>metaphor of the drums<br>and what he adds here is this expansion<br>around the idea of the four assemblies<br>um and this is where he writes the four<br>Assemblies of followers are like Lotus<br>buds in the water some will surface<br>waiting for a sunrise then Bloom with<br>the touch of Dawn's Rays the Dharma is<br>the sunshine that rises in gleams<br>casting its beams lighting up the three<br>worlds to make clear the path to Bliss<br>and hear this sense of the four<br>assemblies is something we don't see in<br>um as being uh this uh idea that comes<br>out I think initially in budagosa's<br>commentary to the digonikai and it's<br>exegesis on the Maha banana gives this<br>simile of the four types of individuals<br>so those uh okay yeah yeah so this is<br>something that becomes quite important<br>in sort of later understandings of<br>Buddhism and does it show up<br>yeah in the places here for me yes<br>and so the terms that this particular<br>passage uses here so he explains uh how<br>for instance the first one those that<br>having risen out of the water lie<br>waiting to be touched by the race of the<br>sun Blossom today Etc that describes<br>each of these four flowers these four<br>groups of followers using this flower<br>metaphor<br>there are four types of flowers there<br>are four types of individuals so those<br>that's the one we're looking at and uh<br>so that has these different kinds of<br>proclivities or karmic predispositions<br>that allow them to be more or less uh<br>receptive uh to the Buddhist teachings<br>um so again that's something that uh<br>uncenses is pregnant within the text but<br>then he expands and makes visible to the<br>The Listener through through this poem<br>and this is of course the version that's<br>most commonly recited in Cambodia today<br>usually it's actually just the last bit<br>uh the portion that begins here with<br>the melody that's used here is just like<br>the one we heard earlier so it's usually<br>something like<br>um<br>those being the first two stances there<br>from sahamati Brahma to befitting his<br>compassionate state<br>um and that would then that Melody would<br>then be continued through the remainder<br>of the stances but this section here is<br>not referring to something that's in the<br>poly at all remember that the poly that<br>we looked at was just happening within<br>uh somebody brahma's imitation to the<br>Buddha and then this subsequent metaphor<br>about the drama uh this however is of<br>course like we saw in that very first<br>the very the second Thai translation it<br>brings it into the present it makes it<br>clear what's happening richly but it<br>precedes that with this account of the<br>the Buddhist light we have this very<br>abbreviated biography of what happens<br>after brahma's imitation in other words<br>the Buddha accepts it walks to sarnath<br>preaches to the banjivakia to this group<br>of five uh monastics<br>um uh preaches<br>and from that moment on continues to<br>preach sermons on the Dharma throughout<br>the 45 light 45 years of his teaching<br>career<br>um and then we get in the last two<br>stances this way just like we saw in<br>that second Thai translation bringing it<br>back to the the moment of inviting a<br>monastic uh to preach that is why right<br>in this moment we are filled with such<br>great joy venerable or virtuous one here<br>referring not to the Buddha but to this<br>monastic we invite you to save us and<br>preach uh rescue those assemblies again<br>borrowing this same word that picked up<br>earlier within this Terminator still<br>mired in delusion that their wisdom<br>um<br>then something else happens in the story<br>of this text<br>so<br>un as you saw was working quite<br>assiduously to make his translation<br>match those existing polystances but<br>expanding on the meaning when he felt<br>necessary and when it accorded with<br>certain exegetical principles drawn from<br>the the commentaries that he had studied<br>and translated over his career<br>in addition however in order to create<br>this perfect parody between what exists<br>in Pali and what exists in the<br>vernacular he then composed four<br>additional stanzas in power that<br>captured what we were just looking at in<br>Combined so this which he added into my<br>these eight stances he created four<br>stanzas and poly to communicate that<br>meaning and it's a very distinctive and<br>interesting form of poly because it uses<br>words that we would very rarely<br>encounter in other kinds of context but<br>if you look at just at the translation<br>for a moment you'll see that it's it's<br>basically the same thing the some of the<br>accepts the imitation<br>um by silently but the accepts it uh and<br>then this summary of His preaching<br>career and then the last stanza bringing<br>it um to the present moment of inviting<br>a monastic to preach and in this we find<br>even the Teeny details are meant to be<br>quite closely matched between the Kamai<br>and uh the poly so for instance when we<br>have uh in the uh the poly we have<br>um<br>um or uh we have this the way the term<br>compassion shows up<br>um<br>in accordance to the pirouette the<br>Bahama the state<br>of the virtues of uh of compassion just<br>like we have here in the Pali uh with<br>this very unusual gerund<br>um a diva Asia I think this is a<br>never seen this appear in in any other<br>polytext this particular gerund devasia<br>this having resorted to it's a unusual<br>form of this particular gen<br>um to what sort of<br>um on on the basis of his compassion<br>then we see again this parallels being<br>developed for in the Kamai we have<br>uh that is<br>the first ah here being the<br>pronunciation of ADI uh at the first and<br>then we have the same thing being<br>expressed here in the Pali with<br>so again very closely being represented<br>which was what we'd expect when he's<br>back translating uh from my into Pali<br>then we have this very I think the most<br>unusual term<br>um well I'll get to the most unusual<br>term<br>um one here this this plan where it's a<br>Pacifica<br>so preach sermons of the Dharma to<br>fulfill the aims of living beings<br>this is again a term not really used<br>elsewhere<br>um but it's a play on words for satartas<br>um aims are are fulfilled that's the<br>sense of that<br>um this plan words on the Buddha's own<br>name is being brought into how he's<br>describing the Buddha's career with this<br>term<br>and then the the most unusual part uh is<br>this this phrase here mag of asani so uh<br>here I've translated as 45 rain Seasons<br>but<br>so the<br>um this is a very rare application of<br>this so-called<br>system of numerals so it's in in<br>Sanskrit there are different ways that<br>one can express numbers so one is with<br>Etc<br>um a bunch of going on Etc um another is<br>with using<br>um<br>particular<br>nouns to stand in for numerals like one<br>for the moon or three for I forget which<br>particular nouns are used in this case<br>but using items in nature or within the<br>Hindu Pantheon to be able to describe uh<br>and stand in for numbers this is yet a<br>third system<br>um that's usually described as the<br>katupayadi that is the system that<br>begins with yeah uh and that's where<br>particular syllables that are if you<br>write out the Sanskrit alphabet in a<br>certain way and then divide it such that<br>you get nine columns uh those then<br>syllables from any of any of this<br>singles that fall into those nine<br>columns those can be used to stand in<br>for particular numbers and this is<br>something that that shows up instance in<br>um<br>I'm forgetting the name at the moment<br>there's an important poly Treatise that<br>um<br>sorry budgetasara uh that should that<br>um that was uh studied by Javier<br>schnapped for his PhD dissertation<br>composed probably in in llama in<br>Northern Thailand in the 16th century<br>that details how to apply this<br>sanskritic numeral system to Pali and<br>then we have here in the late 19th or<br>the 20th century on in one of the very I<br>have never seen this in any of their<br>polytexts uses it just in these two<br>words so that he can fit 45 into two<br>syllables<br>um ma standing in for four and standing<br>in for five maybe the other way around I<br>have to double check but<br>um again this is you know part of the<br>The Genius of of Sultan as a poet but<br>also the Great Lengths he went in order<br>to make sure that he could have this<br>sense of performative parity between uh<br>the two uh versions and and Kumai and<br>Pali so the last stage in this is uh the<br>ways in which this text gets translated<br>uh into a Vietnamese<br>and I can go into this now or I can<br>because the nice thing about having<br>creative lectures over several days is<br>that things can bleed into the next day<br>and it's probably okay<br>so I mean maybe I'll suggest just<br>because they're you know we do have<br>several days maybe we should open up for<br>questions and then get to this as a nice<br>segue 100 more so um the floor is open<br>for those on Zoom you can um type in the<br>chat you can turn off your mic and just<br>ask a question it's a little bit<br>informal<br>so<br>I just realized that you were saying<br>parody parody parody parody that for me<br>they're the same yeah but they sound the<br>same but yeah but in other dialects<br>they're probably different yeah<br>so just um so um<br>so as I missed understood that the<br>um the invitation for the month to to<br>give<br>um to Del Mar so at Diwali Diwali<br>portion it's appear<br>where the first<br>um when it is performing itself no no I<br>the very first one appears in the<br>buddhavan<br>until<br>um so can you just go back right yeah of<br>course literally only that very first<br>verse<br>um so let's let's do it this way so if<br>um<br>we go to the Buddha then that's cool<br>makes sense<br>um<br>so if we look at the text itself<br>um<br>the very first verse is this one<br>but otherwise it's the same price but<br>none of the rest of this has ever used<br>or recited in Southeast Asia so it's<br>only this very first first that's being<br>accepted<br>so can we assume that they knew it at<br>I mean I was I was thinking it was uh<br>it's still going and show that cover<br>right anyway so it's it's a relatively<br>later as far as the relative chronology<br>of different parts of the guy has<br>understood<br>um<br>we don't know the exact date of its<br>composition<br>um it you know according to teravada<br>tradition of course it's part of the<br>text recited at the First Council it's<br>more likely that it was composed<br>um by the<br>first century BCE to first or second<br>century AC I think but it could have<br>this very important Cambodian academic<br>journal in 1926<br>um but he had already passed away I<br>think by 1920 or 1921. so<br>um and so he presumably wrote it down in<br>he was presumably working from either<br>European style notebooks that were<br>becoming available at that time or in<br>these kinds of leperelos<br>um but like many of the poems he<br>composed they were already circulating<br>orally during his lifetime and people<br>were using them<br>you know within uh his own life and so<br>it's hard to we don't know exactly when<br>he wrote it the<br>the version that's published doesn't<br>indicate any of that because it got<br>published after he died<br>but then but the assumption is to<br>demonstrate his error Edition was ever<br>used anywhere was it was it deliberately<br>some kind of attempt to<br>um if you like canonize the his version<br>or what's the what are your intuitions<br>about that I think he really wanted to<br>have it work in the case of ritual<br>performance right<br>um and so in order to make that happen<br>it required from his point of view<br>having there be a poly version that<br>corresponded to the poem he was putting<br>into Kamai and he thought that that was<br>something that was missing if he was<br>familiar we know he was familiar with<br>many Thai texts as well if he was<br>familiar at all with that earlier Thai<br>tradition he would have seen that that<br>Those portions were being added but that<br>there wasn't a except for that one last<br>verse by monkwood there wasn't an<br>attempt in Nepali to bring this into the<br>present of uh inviting a monastic to<br>preach so that may have been part of his<br>motivation I don't it's possible that he<br>was you know trying to demonstrate his<br>erudition but I think everybody knew<br>that he was quite goodness<br>so um<br>he was quite aware as a poet of how his<br>poems would be performed so he has a<br>short life with the that was designed to<br>be used in a theatrical setting and it<br>includes the different melodies or<br>different<br>um directions for how it is to be cited<br>in that setting so I think again he was<br>aware that this is something that would<br>have happened the melody that's used<br>probably predates him again we don't<br>have sound recordings but many of these<br>Melodies presumably go further back<br>they've been changing over time but<br>there would have been an existing<br>performance practice and by harmonizing<br>the Pali and the khmi in this way he<br>could fit his composition into this<br>performance yeah with Melodies notated<br>In These that was entirely oral right<br>okay<br>so until the history of this performance<br>when it's like possibly first Appliance<br>no this is where you have no idea so we<br>have no idea when that first buddhavanza<br>verse was first used and to invite a<br>monastic preach whether that first<br>occurred in Thailand now or Cambodia or<br>when that would have occurred<br>um because there's no to my knowledge<br>any record of that in any kind of<br>inscription or or<br>um historical Chronicle Etc and it's<br>these very details about the<br>nitty-gritty of Buddhist life and the<br>way in which short poems like this this<br>is the very kind of thing that doesn't<br>appear in these official records we saw<br>we'll see in a maybe tomorrow we'll look<br>at some inscriptions that do provide<br>records of how<br>um poems were used and how liturgical<br>poems fit into particular periods of<br>time we have some evidence for that in<br>Cambodia<br>um but often it's very hard to trace<br>these kinds of<br>so what I can offer in this lecture is<br>only this sense of through this process<br>of translation and circulation we can<br>imagine a certain history for these<br>poems and we can see how they play out<br>and expand over this time and space but<br>except for the ones for which we have a<br>known author these very later ones and<br>I'll also bring up tomorrow this version<br>by hotong in Vietnamese where we have a<br>very clear date Etc uh otherwise it's<br>very hard to trace<br>so it is one thing you're trying to kind<br>of apply with this example the sort of<br>um very intentional intertextuality of<br>the of these Traditions or<br>yeah yes I think that's there's on the<br>one hand there's it's there's this<br>intentional borrowing and connection<br>because people are aware of existing<br>performance practices so they're trying<br>to harmonize their new translations into<br>this existing practice<br>um and at the other at the same time<br>there may be an urge to hide the process<br>of translation so un doesn't talk about<br>the previous Thai versions of these same<br>kinds of poems but he chooses the same<br>poetic leader and is making many of the<br>same choices and presumably was aware of<br>what's going on but in the text itself<br>he hides that we see the same in the<br>Vietnamese though it's a almost uh very<br>perfect literal translation of what's<br>happening in the Kamai there's nothing<br>in the that<br>version or the the books that were<br>published in the middle of the 20th<br>century that really highlight that these<br>were translations from Kamai and to<br>Vietnamese rather it's tried to be shown<br>that this is a translation from Pali<br>because that's the source of authority<br>that's being involved so there is this<br>interesting tension between alankara<br>between adornment for its own sake for<br>the psychopoetic beauty and virtuosity<br>and as you say like<br>demonstrating Fidelity to kind of some<br>Authority you know in in cleaving<br>closely to that Authority that I mean<br>basically in everything you've shown<br>seems to be very present do you have a<br>sense that does it does the does the<br>meter leading toward one side or the<br>other would you say or is that meter is<br>that is it always that's attention<br>that's always there it absolutely thinks<br>lean to one side or the other so when<br>we're looking at the inscriptions at the<br>very beginning from what poll those are<br>very much on the side particularly that<br>first one with that elaborate visual<br>presentation that's on the side of<br>alankara<br>that's trying to in a sense not just<br>reproduce but also expand this idea of<br>alankara shastra in a Thai context<br>that's the the broader framework whereas<br>what we're looking at here I think is<br>the the aesthetic elements of it are<br>subordinated to the ritual process the<br>key part is what's happening at the<br>ritual level and drawing the audience in<br>then we have sort of beneath that this<br>aesthetic elements that support that and<br>then that's uh in turn on this doctrinal<br>basis uh for the text<br>it's interesting I mean so you could<br>imagine say a a certain set of<br>parameters within which you could map<br>whatever we're calling but it's poetry<br>you know that the sort of fit for ritual<br>you know so alankara doctrinal fidelity<br>um Felicity in the in the sense of<br>musical Felicity or what you know like<br>that there's these<br>we're working within a kind of a set of<br>parents you know one so what what<br>connects poetry a shared set of<br>parameters possibly I don't know I mean<br>I'm just sort of<br>but it just seems quite striking that<br>that there's these different<br>um it's it's it's not as though the<br>projects are competing against each<br>other but that they are sort of aware of<br>each other and you give here to take<br>their kind of thing absolutely<br>absolutely and I think we see that most<br>prominently within this liturgical<br>sphere where it's very easy to borrow<br>across Traditions yeah when we look at<br>some of the poems that are more created<br>in an aesthetic context there we might<br>see more distinctions I say traditions<br>and less possibilities for borrowing<br>I know we're getting to the end of time<br>or we're already past the end of time so<br>if if there's anyone in the audience who<br>has questions or if<br>please let me know<br>um you can also write to me you can also<br>ask questions if you're in if if this<br>wasn't so terrible and you'd like to<br>return another day this week you're more<br>than welcome to it<br>um and uh<br>yeah again I don't want to take more of<br>your time but thank you so much for for<br>being here all of you that are here both<br>those of whom I know and those I haven't<br>met yet it's it's a real privilege and<br>pleasure to have this chance to<br>mostly talk at you but we can have more<br>talking with you too<br>so great so we'll see everybody tomorrow<br>this time again if there are people in<br>the audience and you could think of a<br>question and you'd like to pose it<br>um and you could you feel free to email<br>me or Trent uh ahead of time tomorrow<br>otherwise we'll see you and I'll give<br>you even more introduction to Trent's<br>background<br>um uh tomorrow uh when when hopefully<br>we'll have more time because we uh<br>need less time to kind of get our<br>operations underway so thank you for<br>coming and we'll see you all tomorrow<br>thank you all thank you</p></main><footer style="margin-top: 2rem; background: #0001; padding: 2rem; text-align: center;"><p>We Are The
