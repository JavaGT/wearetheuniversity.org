online<br>um again it's nice to see both new and<br>familiar names so<br>as last time I just wanted to invite you<br>if you have any questions from uh<br>yesterday's lecture<br>um this would be a fine time to<br>um to ask anything and anything you'd<br>trivia question but I started reading<br>music yesterday like online<br>translation was beautiful like that I<br>don't know I feel it's beautiful the<br>poetry<br>oh thanks thanks so much<br>yesterday we we got to the pot that um<br>so that there is about the reformation<br>and respond to<br>um through through the focus on our<br>heart Chief rather than become Buddha<br>host people recite that you mentioned<br>people resides<br>some part of of the Poetry have you<br>found<br>um can you hear about something that I<br>would say contradiction between what<br>really the text say and then what people<br>um do differently for example my text<br>the demographic so really the text<br>describe the Buddha would be coming they<br>put a hood but the way people use it<br>um it clearly said that so for the<br>practitioner of of this text so we<br>recite these things frequently in order<br>to attend our Hachi rather than becoming<br>different self in the in the future so<br>have you ever<br>that kind of tension between doctrinally<br>what's happening in the text and what<br>people<br>talk about what they're doing either in<br>a present-day context or what evidence<br>we might have for that in historical<br>I don't have a good example offhand I<br>think other than what the kinds of<br>examples that you've raised around this<br>tension between what is the key<br>satiriological goal or mode of<br>Liberation that people are articulating<br>in a given text or anything in practice<br>something that we'll see a little bit<br>later today is I think I mentioned it<br>yesterday that we've come to a text<br>where it describes all the things that<br>put us in a certain context should not<br>do but do anyways<br>and<br>I think that's a very interesting list<br>for us to consider with regards to your<br>question and it relates to I think a key<br>idea that shows up across a number of<br>different Southeast Asian Buddhist texts<br>particularly in a Cambodian context that<br>is<br>that<br>being a human being involves a certain<br>degree of violence to the world<br>some aspects of unwholesome karma from<br>this perspective are inevitable<br>so therefore what kinds of rituals might<br>be constructed to<br>absolve or to seek repentance to take<br>leave of the kinds of karmic results<br>that are incurred by an ordinary<br>inevitable<br>course of human life<br>so I think there I think that's also a<br>question it's like is the text is it<br>describing maybe in the other direction<br>like a much more violent life than<br>uh people might frame their<br>particular aspirations today<br>even though the text like that is still<br>used so it could be asked for multiple<br>angles I hope that gets at some of them<br>there's a lot of there's a lot going on<br>here<br>anything those of you who are joining us<br>on Zoom if you want to put any questions<br>in the chat or ask directly<br>uh just wanted to give you this<br>opportunity otherwise I'm happy to to<br>wonderful so today uh I wanna<br>bring up one text that I think will help<br>us transition a bit from the theme we<br>were exploring yesterday around prayer<br>and aspiration and how we might think<br>about that showing up in these different<br>types of verse texts and the theme that<br>I'll be more explicitly focusing on<br>today that is around questions of debt<br>particularly familial debt<br>so to go to the text that I think will<br>foreign<br>okay<br>so this is a text that in Kamai is<br>um in other words the benefits of the<br>recitation memorization copying<br>performance of the this particular<br>non-canonical polytext that's more<br>or again with this slightly more formal<br>polynomial<br>this is a text for which one version has<br>been edited by badman of jaini uh that's<br>of the polytext that is um this is a<br>vernacular text that articulates the<br>anisansa the benefits of that particular<br>and it only appears to my knowledge in<br>one manuscript this manuscript comes<br>from what was then Province what's now<br>part of province in Cambodia<br>a little bit north and east of bromplend<br>sometime in the late 19th or maybe early<br>20th Centuries by a particular<br>um<br>layperson who was a poet named<br>so this is an addition and translation<br>of that text we'll just look at some of<br>the features of it<br>so<br>as we saw yesterday very commonly the<br>beginnings of these kinds of Buddhist<br>poems all across Mainland Southeast Asia<br>have verses of Praise at the beginning<br>so we have here I composed this in the<br>Brahman<br>song meter<br>again as we went through the other day<br>with this alternating pattern of five<br>and six syllables with linking Rhymes<br>prostrating before the teacher whose<br>heart is compassionate ever kind and<br>enlightenment<br>and then to the other uh two of the<br>three jewels to the Dharma into the<br>Sangha<br>then after this opening homage we have<br>uh this appeal appeal to ask for the<br>very blessings or benefits that are to<br>be conferred from the composition and<br>recitation of this this text I humbly<br>asked for the blessings to be my refuge<br>then we get this even more specific<br>prayer one that comes in a more<br>autobiographical Direction<br>beginning with moreover may I now make<br>this solemn prayer and the word here<br>one of the terms we were looking at for<br>aspiration yesterday so be fine to<br>translate this as a truthful aspiration<br>or something else like that<br>May the omniscient Gods residing in all<br>quarters assist me as my witness<br>listening to my uttered wish the true<br>words that I vow to be enlightened<br>the virtues of my mother and of my<br>father and of course this will be the<br>theme that we're looking at today this<br>question of how do virtues and deaths<br>towards uh family teachers other people<br>show up in Buddhist poetry what do they<br>tell us about how Buddhist poetry is<br>being structured and crafted ever<br>precise and of my preceptor that is the<br>one who ordained<br>as a month as youth to whom I bow and of<br>teachers and relatives may they help me<br>truly as per my aspiration<br>and then<br>he asked to<br>repay these debts<br>um here the the phrasing is song this is<br>one of uh various number of phrases that<br>are used in Kumai to articulate this<br>idea of repaying debts I found a repay<br>my debts to them when I reach the fruit<br>that is when he attains uh the fruit of<br>the hood and to save living beings that<br>is acting as a Buddhist act so that they<br>are free from worry abandoned and cast<br>off evil acts and enjoy Bliss as they<br>so this is the the opening we see and in<br>many ways it parallels the opening we<br>saw in uh in that Masterpiece of Lao<br>literature where we have<br>um an opening mangala of praise to the<br>three jewels and then also asking for<br>the the benefits of<br>composing such obese and also asking for<br>assistance from those of virtue to be of<br>witness to this act of writing and<br>composition then we have the very<br>specific question that says what exactly<br>is the meritorious action that's being<br>done and here it's again like composing<br>in a text I intend to arrange and<br>express the Buddha's words uh when the<br>Lord preached about the one who recites<br>this<br>and strives to ponder it benefits will<br>sin then this is the part that I'll skip<br>in my presentation here we have the core<br>portion of the text that goes into this<br>tale around what exactly are the<br>benefits of reciting this particular<br>text this is the text that again is<br>known uh not this vernacular poem but<br>the polytext is one that shows up all<br>across Cambodia Thailand and Laos<br>so I will skip this portion for now<br>um if you're interested you can find it<br>in my dissertation<br>then<br>towards the end we have<br>a recapitulation of what he's done and<br>then again this trying to connect<br>autobiographically to what's going on<br>and here we have this again this<br>invocation of<br>what his actual life is like who this<br>particular poet and how it connects to<br>himself his family and his aspirations<br>so<br>here ending this particular explanation<br>of the benefits of the we have this<br>explanation of the fruits has been<br>abbreviated according to Convention it's<br>very very common conventionally for such<br>Southeast Asian poems to say that they<br>are merely short versions merely<br>abbreviated versions of What should be a<br>much longer Exposition and this can<br>occur in a relatively short Texas about<br>60 stanzas but it also can occur in<br>texts that are hundreds or thousands of<br>stances thought still this insistence<br>that well this is this is really just a<br>short version<br>as a fruit for me in the future set down<br>is sufficient for seeking refuge and<br>chastising the mind<br>and again we have this kind of apology<br>very common that one would see in<br>Buddhist literature particularly first<br>text of this type you see it also in<br>manuscript Halifax if any of you should<br>read this don't call it immature<br>please take pity on me since I fear I'm<br>maybe wrong corrupter not so correct<br>according to tradition<br>since I have but little wisdom and here<br>the text is fragmentary not in<br>accordance to custom the way of people<br>of the past please help Rectify it so it<br>is correct don't criticize it in other<br>words he's inviting the readership of<br>this text those who may be reading it<br>those who may be listening to it to<br>work to make it better<br>of course we see texts like this<br>changing and growing over time this<br>particular one I'm only able to find in<br>this manuscript I don't know whether<br>it's a autograph in other words the poet<br>himself wrote it in the very physical<br>manuscript in which I came across it or<br>it had been already copied and shared<br>beyond that geographically it's in<br>exactly the right place but it's it's<br>hard to know if this is of course his<br>particular handwriting taking this fruit<br>as a basis your virtues shall be<br>extremely exalted<br>massively large Beyond Compare like a<br>great ship crossing the waters if you<br>clearly see into the precious Dharma and<br>your virtues cannot be explained<br>explain then we get his own actual<br>autobiography as for my own name and its<br>original powerful letters the lovely<br>letter H cleft by a u and finished with<br>is the way of spelling the name<br>this kind of name riddle is very common<br>in Cambodian literature of this period<br>manifest in script and spelled according<br>to the method the way we spell my name<br>is<br>the child of rural government official I<br>ordained and studied within the Buddhist<br>religion strive striving to quickly<br>write according to Pali with my<br>uneducated mind<br>I came to stay in breita Monastery or<br>the lay people were not disrupted<br>following what my teacher taught me to<br>chant and study according to tradition<br>do only to my unwholesome states which<br>caused me to suffer inside I struggled<br>to change but could not contain them so<br>I disrobed and became a Layman so<br>presumably this is a reference to be<br>struggling with celibacy<br>um and it's very common to see these<br>kinds of Admissions and sometimes<br>manuscript color funds sometimes in<br>poetry like this that former monks might<br>acknowledge that the very Act of being<br>monk particularly being celibate was not<br>something that they were able to<br>and here we have continuing to State<br>what his life was like after the time of<br>disrobing I began to make a living<br>according to need without to see<br>settling in the Great Village near named<br>uh sorry oh<br>as for me I am bereft of my precious<br>parents I now take shelter with my other<br>sibling such and my difficulties when I<br>was still a monk my mind was straight<br>and generous I tried to test my wits<br>close this<br>for the continuation of the religion of<br>the teachers appropriate to worship him<br>his first shoes are massive and manifold<br>always saving beings<br>since my heart is true and seeks peace<br>in my own being may I not be distantly<br>cleft from my wish to become<br>I attain according to this vow that I<br>pray earnestly bowing low and become a<br>Buddha in the future according to my<br>affinities for the benefits that vary<br>across like a precious grape vessel that<br>lead and countable numbers of living<br>beings to arrive at the far Shore that<br>is the Bahama<br>finished Mrs here bringing in this poly<br>term a completely completely ended<br>this is concluded in the main it stops<br>now normal recounting thus it ends right<br>here<br>and<br>the conventions that I wanted to bring<br>out here just to recapitulate what we<br>went through yesterday is this close<br>link between how aspirations are<br>articulated and the particular<br>nature of the poet's life and how that<br>life shows up in these beginning and<br>ending portions is this kind of British<br>verse<br>and as for the transition into our topic<br>today of course you'll notice that<br>he's met when talking about his life<br>growing up he mentions his parents then<br>the big change that happens of course<br>after his ordination is<br>death of his parents<br>um and that this uh forms a way of<br>framing his life as well as at the very<br>beginning he invokes this<br>the virtues of his parents so let's now<br>go into<br>this question of you know what what is<br>meant by virtue or debt in regards to<br>parents in a Southeast Asian Buddhist<br>context<br>so the term that I'm using here to<br>translate debt<br>is one that's quite multivalent this<br>term in Bali and Sanskrit<br>in pronounced and pronounced in<br>different ways in in Mainland Southeast<br>Asian languages<br>um<br>has the basic sense of quality<br>and on the basis of that basic sense we<br>also get this extended meaning of virtue<br>in other words virtues being this the<br>kind of positive qualities that would be<br>connected to a particular person saying<br>State Etc so a very common context in<br>which we see this idea of una appearing<br>in Buddhist texts<br>um not so much in the davidica but<br>certainly later in the in Buddhist<br>Traditions is this idea of<br>that is the virtues of the Buddha within<br>many uh teravada contexts later in in<br>Buddhist history this term<br>is sometimes connected to the nine or<br>Etc<br>in other cases it can be connected to<br>much longer lists and more elaborate<br>understandings not just the epithetics<br>with all the different aspects that can<br>be considered a certain quality or a<br>certain virtue of<br>beyond that however this term gets<br>extended<br>to<br>a wide range of other beings<br>and here we have this sense that it's<br>not just virtue but it's somehow<br>virtuous beings are those to whom we owe<br>a debt<br>in other words on account of their<br>virtue<br>um this is<br>um<br>why we have this sense of indebtedness<br>so that applies equally to the Buddha or<br>the Sangha in the way this is framed in<br>a Southeast Asian Buddhist context as<br>well as other things to whom this this<br>uh una is attributed like that of the<br>Earth or of various deities of teachers<br>Etc<br>so<br>um<br>Alexander Tran has a question here uh<br>what is the motivation behind wanting to<br>repay one's debts instead of<br>appreciating or acknowledging that they<br>might not be able to be repaid whether<br>in full or at all<br>though one's parents are always going to<br>be fundamental for example the desire to<br>repay that debt regardless imply that<br>one is ultimately wanting to detach<br>themselves or move on from those they<br>will adapt to Fantastic question and<br>I think uh there are a number of ways we<br>could approach this certainly within the<br>the text that I'm looking at which are<br>by and large between the 16th and 19th<br>centuries<br>um there are different verbs that are<br>used around how to relate to this kind<br>of debt<br>so I've uh put some of these down here<br>as the third major point on this slide<br>so one way to think about it is this<br>contrast between knowing debts and<br>repaying them and this idea of knowing<br>and repaying are sometimes separated and<br>sometimes the really thought of as uh<br>together in some way so in terms for<br>knowing deaths terms that we might<br>sometimes describe as gratitude or being<br>grateful in English include a Sanskrit<br>term like katagna literally knowing yeah<br>what has been done<br>and implied on one's behalf and then<br>similar kind of sense these are very<br>commonly used in a reference to the<br>relationship between children and<br>parents those who are grateful those who<br>are uh in this context are those who<br>both know<br>that's the literal sense of these terms<br>they know and have this sense of<br>appreciation for this debt<br>and as you put it uh Alexander might no<br>acknowledge appreciating or<br>acknowledging that they might not be<br>able to repay it in full I think that's<br>part of the dimension of this knowing<br>it's knowing that the debt of parents is<br>um and certainly there are lots of<br>examples of uh Chinese or Vietnamese<br>context or in a South a Cambodian or<br>ticondus to try to compare the debt of<br>parents to something that's Limitless<br>something that can never uh be repaid<br>so that's definitely there but there's<br>also this sense in these terms like uh<br>certainly<br>but also a term like<br>um that's this<br>um or uh<br>et cetera in the Vietnamese context that<br>one who knows this debt one who knows<br>the virtues of of one's parents<br>according to this line of thinking is is<br>also one who repays them who is able to<br>song<br>in a sorry in a quiet context or um<br>and a Vietnamese context Etc<br>and so I think it's sometimes very<br>difficult to tease apart these uh this<br>question<br>um whether knowing necessarily means<br>repaying there's a second part of your<br>question that<br>um<br>I think is not so much developed in the<br>text I'm familiar with but let's keep it<br>open as a question as we look through<br>the materials today that is does the<br>desire to repay that debt imply that one<br>is ultimately wanting to detach<br>themselves or move on from those they<br>owe a debt to I think that becomes very<br>relevant to consider in the context of<br>monastic coordination because monastic<br>coordination we'll see this in a text<br>soon from a Thai source is both the<br>an opportunity to repay that debt to<br>one's parents the most effective way of<br>repaying that debt according to this<br>these kinds of traditional texts and<br>rituals but it's also a the act of<br>ordaining is separating oneself from<br>one's family<br>uh one must uh ritually at least say<br>goodbye to one's parents and that kind<br>of cut that so does that mean a kind of<br>moving on as you've expressed it<br>Alexander let's see so let's keep that<br>question in mind<br>moving uh up one point on this Slide the<br>the uh of parents<br>this can be expressed in different ways<br>in different languages and Kamaya it's<br>often expressed as<br>in the case of Thai usually this other<br>word uh<br>uh Boon which is uh the Thai<br>pronunciation of punya may be added as<br>well for a phrase like um<br>but sometimes can have the sets as well<br>but it's a quite multivalent term in<br>Thai<br>um in Vietnamese there's a number of<br>different terms a particularly common or<br>um<br>but there are a variety of other ones<br>that could be used as well<br>what I want to get to a little bit and<br>we'll see how the course of our<br>conversation goes is the relationship<br>not just between knowing and repaying<br>these kinds of debts but also between<br>the celebration of those kinds of deaths<br>and grief or Mourning when there's a<br>risk that they cannot be repaid in some<br>way<br>this can be from the perspective of<br>parent or from the perspective of a<br>child<br>and I think this too gets to what you're<br>getting at Alexander with this idea of<br>appreciating or acknowledging I mean<br>certainly some of these texts are really<br>on exploring this idea of how to<br>celebrate the virtues of parents others<br>are really focused on this question of<br>grief like oh I was not able to fulfill<br>these kinds of filial obligations or my<br>child is leaving me at this moment of<br>great need that that is also very much<br>connected to what's going on<br>I think what we will see is how<br>narratives of mourning and loss can<br>become key focal points for recalling<br>this virtue and that's when we see these<br>links between poetry composed in<br>Southeast Asia outside of an explicit<br>Buddhist context really intersecting<br>with these Buddhist Frameworks around<br>filial debts<br>so with that overall framework in mind<br>let's take a look at some of the<br>specific texts so the as I mentioned<br>before I thought we could begin by<br>thinking about the context of monastic<br>coordination so this is a wonderful poem<br>by uh<br>um<br>and even the monastic name of uh<br>uh you know literally has this sense of<br>he who is the uh the chief among<br>excellent poets that's one way of uh<br>Translating that that monastic name so<br>it seemed<br>um destined for uh a career in poetry<br>and this is this particular one uh this<br>poem is called uh<br>or the Glon poem that tells the process<br>and there's this wonderful bilingual<br>edition of it uh with a very<br>um<br>sophisticated English translation by<br>Thomas silcox this went out of print a<br>long time ago<br>um but as you see when you look at the<br>text itself<br>he did I think a really incredible job<br>with making the<br>the key aspects of the Glon meter in<br>Thai uh come across in English<br>so if we just look on the top right here<br>we can see though it's in 10 syllables<br>instead of eight it captures these<br>complex Rhymes<br>um<br>hot is well it's rhyming with sit it's<br>not a perfect crime but ease and phase<br>and chews and Vain and slain then and<br>him and uh obligation renunciation<br>persuasion petition will ill fail<br>Etc these kinds of Rhymes are all being<br>set up in a similar or analogous kind of<br>way to how they are on the tie it means<br>that in any kind of translation like<br>this it's not going to be as closely<br>literal but I think it does a very<br>admirable job in both giving the the<br>flavor and the content of of what's<br>Happening so let's take a little bit of<br>uh a sense a closer look at what's<br>happening here this this Story begins<br>these are just excerpts and starting<br>already on line uh 180 here of a much<br>longer text<br>it's from relatively close to the<br>beginning<br>and uh the<br>there are<br>I forget the name of the Father the<br>mother's name is uh John and her son his<br>name is Pian oh sorry Keen is the uh the<br>father's name and uh done uh is the the<br>mother's name and their son Kian was<br>originally a was a a boy educated as a<br>as a non-ordained uh young child at a<br>temple<br>um and then having grown up his parents<br>are thinking huh as young men do with<br>tempers ever hot this is from the top<br>whose sleep eats sit and stand never at<br>ease hold it and thought now he's in a<br>dangerous phase he may well choose a<br>crooked path in vain if left to seek his<br>fun at his own will he'll end in Gaul or<br>be destroyed and slain this year is<br>rabbit next to his Dragon then we must<br>ordain him find his application and John<br>agrees they'll have this son they love<br>tread the way of the great renunciation<br>and so they called their son and their<br>persuasion and sweet petition soothe and<br>caress his will and then we have this uh<br>brief section that shows how they're<br>trying to convince him that well in<br>order to fulfill this obligation of<br>yours as a son<br>you need to ordain as a monastic<br>Dear Boy the blight of age blasts Every<br>Creature it is but nature none escapes<br>this ill mother and I grow older fade<br>and fail and cannot tell when we too<br>shall be dead<br>from birth till now we too could rear<br>and love you no honor gave you that no<br>Craven need no wealth we leave no store<br>of treasure stowed to farm for food is<br>all the skill we've taught you<br>and though to rear a child's a strenuous<br>task we do not ask returns for what<br>we've brought you only when Earth claims<br>us and we desert you to share your<br>virtue among to bless our sleep now this<br>here is when we have a bit of a problem<br>in the translation in the sense that the<br>word that sokak has translated as sleep<br>here<br>so subin here does not though literally<br>this term uh means you dream or sleep<br>this is not the sense of what's<br>Happening Here so there's a very<br>important Thai narrative<br>um known as<br>that we have evidence of being recited<br>and used in Thailand since I think at<br>least the 18th century maybe earlier<br>um and there's a wonderful recent PhD<br>thesis on this text that came out<br>recently<br>and if you're interested in the there<br>also exists a Kamai translation of it I<br>think that the English translation of<br>the Khmer version of my dissertation as<br>well<br>um but the core of the narrative is<br>around uh this young monk who wants to<br>ordain but his his mom doesn't want him<br>to<br>um and uh his father is a hunter and<br>slaying all kinds of animals and it's<br>through the the benefit of his<br>ordination that he's able to save his<br>parents<br>um from a painful fate<br>and so the sense here that that<br>narrative gets reproduced<br>um<br>and each time someone is ordained within<br>this Thai or Cambodian context that<br>and then we have uh going on describing<br>like you know what's<br>um<br>that they'll pool their resources<br>together in order to be able to sponsor<br>the ordination ceremony which is much of<br>what is described so elaborately in this<br>poem<br>um and then<br>a sense that this is very important to<br>the parents so starting in this uh line<br>down near the bottom let us your death<br>just see your habits him in other words<br>just the the edge of the uh the robe<br>cling there and come clear over Sorrows<br>River and that image is one that is<br>exactly what's happening in the story of<br>um that he uh<br>her his mother when she's has this<br>either a dream or she's really in the<br>house sees this glimpse of the robe and<br>is able to have that lift her out<br>from uh a lifetime of suffering in the<br>house<br>let me move on now to the way some of<br>these ideas around<br>um debt to parents is expressed also<br>again in Thai literature but outside of<br>a strictly Buddhist context now let's<br>see are some of the questions around dad<br>and virtue the same or might they we see<br>them come to new light in this kind of<br>context so the example that I wanted to<br>bring up here is from mili prala this is<br>one of the<br>gems of early UTI period literature<br>um it's likely that the the text as we<br>have it uh which kind of comes down to<br>us in I think 18th and 19th century<br>manuscripts has gone a lot of change<br>over the centuries and presumably was<br>Something Told in an oral storytelling<br>context<br>um and the particular forms of poetry<br>meaning that it's it combines two uh key<br>and very old types of Thai poetry that<br>of cry which is a kind of rhymed prose<br>as a way to think about it in English<br>um and clone which is a much more<br>formalized uh structure based on the<br>basic concepts of from eye poetry<br>but it's a poetry that has many<br>parallels with other uh Thai languages<br>within uh Mainland southeast Asia and is<br>one that fits the the phonological<br>principles of those tonal languages<br>particularly before something called the<br>Great tone split which was a change that<br>affected all Southwestern by languages<br>uh approximately uh 500 years ago<br>um leading uh what was originally a<br>system of three principal tones to the<br>five or six tone systems we see across<br>these languages today<br>so the way that the the structures work<br>when reading it in uh contemporary<br>phonology of time maybe isn't the way it<br>would resonate in the past but it gives<br>us a sense of how this how this poetry<br>worked the story of Lily prala and there<br>are now two uh wonderful English<br>translations available one by uh<br>and uh Chris Baker and another by Robert<br>bickner who the latter who'd been<br>working on the text for<br>at least yeah at least 40 years um so<br>it's a both very learned and wonderful<br>translations and uh the overall<br>narrative is one that doesn't<br>necessarily correspond to any kind of<br>Buddhist context and sometimes in Thai<br>literary Christian it's discussed really<br>as the Buddhist text<br>um thickener for instance argues quite<br>strongly against that idea that it<br>should be understood as a Buddhist text<br>so we can sort of think about those<br>competing arguments when we look at the<br>passage but we'll look at soon it's<br>about<br>um how uh<br>uh<br>flaws mother is<br>lamenting that her son is not is leaving<br>her<br>so let me fill you in on the story a<br>little bit first so this is a story of<br>two kingdoms and uh law is originally<br>Prince law and uh his father leads a<br>military uh expedition to the<br>neighboring Kingdom<br>and in the process the king of that<br>neighboring kingdom is killed<br>um but sovereignty doesn't seem to they<br>seem to make that Kingdom seems to<br>retain their Serenity after this this<br>loss of their camp<br>um eventually Law's father uh retires<br>and law himself becomes king<br>and then of course the son of the<br>deceased King in the neighboring Kingdom<br>becomes king as well<br>and uh the beauty of of now King law is<br>is one that's celebrated throughout the<br>land and uh so much so that Barnes and<br>those singing this kind of oral poetry<br>which is<br>exactly the style with this poem is<br>composed in uh would would praise it to<br>neighboring kingdoms as well and the<br>granddaughters of the slain King of the<br>neighboring Kingdom were the daughters<br>of the that King uh procure and<br>preparing hear this song about the<br>beauty of the handsomeness of King law<br>and this and completely fall in love<br>they're completely spitting and decide<br>that uh we we need to meet him this is<br>the one goal that we need to achieve so<br>they uh then begin to work with their<br>attendance and have someone come recite<br>a poem to uh law about the beauty of<br>these two princesses he then is<br>attracted to them but in order to make<br>this Union come together<br>uh they have to rely in other words<br>um uh um<br>and their ladies in Waiting have to<br>invoke and seek out powerful Sorcerers<br>in order to convince law to leave his<br>kingdom and travel over to their Kingdom<br>to have uh clandestine Union<br>and so much of the story is about uh is<br>going back and forth between Rivals<br>Sorcerers to bring a law over eventually<br>he makes it over first the the two<br>attendants of law and the two attendants<br>of uh<br>um have<br>um a dalliance in the garden and a uh<br>a<br>H or geostic uh sex scene in other words<br>um and then that eventually leads to uh<br>law and Putin paying similarly uh<br>finally uniting together in the uh scene<br>of both<br>um erotic and also lots of<br>symbolism drawn from<br>brahmanical deities<br>and so it's at that point uh that uh<br>we're getting towards the end of the<br>story<br>um that uh<br>eventually things end up terribly uh for<br>the three of them for Law and for puan<br>and Pang in that the uh the King the<br>notice that the father of<br>proves of their Union he's very excited<br>to have laws his son-in-law<br>um but<br>uh the wife of the slain king of that<br>Kingdom the the two princesses<br>grandmother is very upset<br>um and so secretly has them uh all uh<br>killed by her her own guards and then uh<br>the story has this dramatic dinner wall<br>uh from from that point uh<br>ends with the the funerals of these<br>characters<br>prior to that though there's this<br>tension between Law's mother and law<br>that extends throughout the text<br>um and before he even leaves his own<br>kingdom he is he's torn of course<br>because he's being pulled by this magic<br>and also by his own feelings having<br>heard about these two princesses but he<br>also sends us that there's some danger<br>his mother definitely senses that<br>there's danger and that this is<br>um not uh the right uh time uh to go<br>um and so<br>in that he's<br>um uh trying to decide his mother is<br>trying to convince him to stay and this<br>is just a section of his his mother<br>trying to convince him that no really<br>think of all that I've done for you<br>um all of um in other words the ways in<br>which you are indebted to me as your<br>mother why can't you listen to me in<br>this context let me see if I can adjust<br>so here I've just uh put a very very<br>literal translation so you can get a<br>sense of of what's going on but in<br>essence this means uh just remember this<br>is Law's mother speaking for 10 months I<br>held you in in my womb<br>oh Lord and you the beautiful one the<br>handsome One<br>um I cared for you uh without<br>um<br>forgetting in other words I without a<br>single moment of of carelessness not<br>even once<br>um and until uh in this here is an<br>epithet for the the king uh<br>um the literally The Hairpin of the<br>triple wheel but in this case the the<br>Lord over uh the three worlds or the the<br>Lord over the three divisions of the<br>Kingdom<br>until you were born<br>I cradled you I bathed you I held you<br>constantly always caressing you raising<br>you protecting you<br>and then she goes on to detail what that<br>entailed so every day for each of the<br>three meals I always fed you never<br>making never having anyone else uh do<br>that or do it wrong for you taking such<br>extreme care for you my<br>um my that my true pair in this life<br>I'm not wishing to change this at all<br>sort of naturally or constantly<br>supporting you<br>um until you were able to eat on your<br>own<br>um arranging her in this case carefully<br>preparing food and cooking things for<br>you to eat never at all being careless<br>or indifferent not even once<br>um all uh all kinds of things all the<br>clothes food Etc<br>um for for you a child I I counted I<br>checked I carefully<br>um reflected and prepared not uh placing<br>the heart that is not trusting uh even<br>half even a little for someone else to<br>do from the time you were little I I<br>raised you continuously<br>um uh sorry where I wrote<br>product I meant protect<br>um until you reached<br>um maturity until you came of of age and<br>reached this attainment over Earth that<br>means you came into kingship and reigned<br>as king why must you uh now uh take<br>leave and make me grieve to death in<br>this way so she's invoking uh this the<br>way that we might see in Buddhist texts<br>that talk about<br>um what is the this kinds of debt of<br>care uh that children owe their parents<br>but here she's using as a way to<br>convince him not to go uh and seek out<br>um the uh this clandestine Union with<br>the two princesses uh one that I I think<br>at that point everybody realizes will<br>we also see similar themes show up in uh<br>Vietnamese literature<br>um again this is not in the context of<br>something that would be normally<br>considered explicitly a Buddhist text<br>really not at all and this is from the<br>the national epic of of Vietnam the uh<br>my wing you and this is a translation a<br>reformulation of a Chinese novel<br>um but the the Real Genius of the text<br>is not necessarily in the narrative<br>which is borrowed<br>very very closely to to the Chinese<br>novel it's not even set in Vietnam it's<br>really set in China with all the same<br>place names Etc but the the genius of<br>um when you is as a poet is how he<br>retells<br>um this story in in such a a beautiful<br>and precise way with his use of language<br>so the other day when we were looking at<br>a Vietnamese text I think this was the<br>beginning of yesterday's lecture we were<br>looking at this form that had seven<br>syllable two lines of seven syllables<br>then six and eight uh this one is just<br>um uh in this six eight uh meter the<br>text was originally written in uh that's<br>the Semitic looking characters that you<br>see there<br>um and so words that are of uh directly<br>borrowed from literary synodic the<br>characters are the same for those words<br>that only exist in Vietnamese<br>um the uh the system of this way of<br>writing Vietnamese using these<br>characters uses a whole bunch of other<br>characters usually combined with this<br>phonetic and radical method for<br>um representing all of these different<br>Vietnamese sounds including the ones<br>that don't have any connection to a<br>Chinese word<br>so that's what's being represented here<br>on the very top left you can see how one<br>of the the<br>printing of one of the wood blocks that<br>survived for this text<br>um in this particular passage<br>um were uh we're getting to know<br>um<br>the character who's the heroine<br>and she has just gone off on an<br>Excursion with her uh her brother and<br>sister and in that she comes to the<br>grave of this uh deceased singer who met<br>an untimely end<br>um and that the ghost<br>um uh about being that to see singer<br>um informs that she she too has an<br>unfortunate fate awaiting her so she's<br>now<br>um beginning to she's<br>she's mourning the fact that this is<br>maybe what could be in store uh for her<br>um so the beginning of this passage here<br>goes<br>so the sound of you uh lamenting or<br>wailing<br>um behind or the<br>um the Troon is this kind of curtain and<br>Wang with a kind of Phoenix pattern to<br>it<br>um so her uh the implications her mother<br>hearing that and the term used for<br>mother yahweing is this very interesting<br>poetic term that connects to a<br>particular kind of uh plant that<br>has a very<br>um<br>so Prince Transit is a day lily that can<br>be used in medicine and has a very soft<br>and gentle healing quality to it so the<br>yahooem is the place where that<br>particular plant grows here it's used as<br>a epithet for um the mother and here as<br>um<br>so suddenly awakes this in the middle of<br>the night and asks like and what's<br>what's going on and this is what she<br>um<br>so what's what's going on how are you<br>why are you tossing and turning here so<br>late um at this late watch of of the<br>night<br>um and your uh<br>your tier your um pear this is the huay<br>your pear flower uh like uh cheeks how<br>is it that they're now soaked through<br>um uh with with water as if covered with<br>rain<br>system<br>um<br>and this is she's implementing that as<br>she'll explain later that oh this<br>terrible fate is going to<br>um befall me but uh she she first the<br>first way that she frames this sense of<br>fear or apprehension around this<br>terrible fate is uh this line<br>so Jung is the set it means to raise to<br>bring option is to to to give birth or<br>to be born uh knowing uh the paired debt<br>so this pair debt of being raised and<br>having been given birth to by my mother<br>by my parents<br>um<br>even to the breath of a hair or the<br>thinness of silk has not yet been repaid<br>and later in the the text we see uh it<br>happens a number of times just picking<br>out a few examples uh when she's uh has<br>this kind of conflict between realizing<br>oh this is the way my life is going but<br>I haven't repaid this most important<br>debt she ends up in the end after I<br>won't summarize the story because it's<br>it's too long and complex but there are<br>parts that get more explicitly Buddhist<br>towards the end as she Cycles in and out<br>of a nunnery and there's different<br>questions and Reflections on uh the<br>value of uh sensuality and Chastity in<br>that context<br>um but here<br>um is uh the kind of an early emotional<br>climax the text<br>um<br>after that meeting with the ghost she<br>comes across<br>um the man to whom shall become betroth<br>but is not yet married<br>and uh well he has to go away for a<br>relative's funeral I think<br>she uh that is<br>um uh you know comes home one day and<br>her her father and her her<br>been arrested<br>and accused of some kind of financial<br>crime it seems and in order to get him<br>out of that because the family has no<br>money to be able to save him she<br>ultimately decides to to sell herself to<br>sell herself into prostitution<br>she doesn't expect that it will be<br>prostitution she attempts to sell<br>herself into marriage to someone else<br>but it ends up that she<br>um is being tricked but she doesn't know<br>that yet but still she's of this<br>terrible choice because she doesn't know<br>uh whether to be filial in this context<br>to repay this debt she feels to her<br>parents or to<br>um the the man to whom she just became<br>engaged so the way it's phrased here um<br>um so win is a way of meaning something<br>like karmic Affinity in this uh and<br>inside of Vietnamese there's bonds of<br>karma kafindi of meeting that means this<br>chance Encounter of meeting uh this man<br>to whom she became patrolled and then<br>that's contrasted with<br>is like in the in the context of is a<br>translation of Merit or sometimes virtue<br>and here's the senses the virtue of the<br>wow of that long and painful arduous<br>um<br>um so this word or this concept of<br>meaning uh<br>some this is from Chinese Ching of the<br>sense of<br>affect or feeling or sentiment sometimes<br>translated as love<br>um along with<br>one of uh several kind of Vietnamese<br>words for filial piety<br>on which side is is weightier which is<br>is more important<br>um<br>and then later on she says to be a child<br>to be a failure child<br>one has to repay<br>um this debt repay this uh this virtue<br>and then uh she<br>decides<br>to sell herself in order to save her<br>father so this is part of the framing of<br>the whole narrative uh this these key<br>ideas around uh<br>dead and virtue to parents so let's see<br>a little bit how this traces in other<br>forms of poetry and music in Southeast<br>Asia<br>so<br>um this of course is a major theme of<br>songs in in Vietnam uh this is a song<br>from 1959 by the key post Independence<br>um songwriter elong<br>um and uh this uh this song is not<br>necessarily explicitly a Buddhist one at<br>all though it may be recited and<br>performed at uh Buddhist ceremonies<br>particularly<br>is the annual<br>um<br>right of making offerings to one's<br>ancestors that in in a modern day<br>Vietnamese context has been one of<br>primarily offering uh<br>thanks to one's parents and both those<br>who are alive and morning those who<br>passed away we'll look in the next song<br>about a text that's become very<br>important in that context composed by<br>um this one<br>um<br>uh I won't sing it for you now<br>um but uh because I think I made a typo<br>here but uh<br>she the the key way in which it's Being<br>Framed are uh for love of her children<br>um for this care for children a mother<br>makes all these kinds of sacrifices for<br>years she wakes up early and retires<br>late craving hardships till the day her<br>kids finally grow up or at night your<br>whole heart Delights in her kids her<br>soothing lullaby and endless Echo across<br>the year so coming back to Alexander's<br>question we have this this tension<br>between this kind of Celebration and<br>also<br>articulating what is what exactly<br>is constitutes the debt that parent that<br>children would owe their parents<br>um this uh song is based on a short<br>essay by uh<br>um and was then re- formulated into a<br>poem by phantombe<br>um and this text again very commonly<br>sung for vulang this important<br>um annual Buddhist ritual<br>um in in Vietnam<br>um is is one that again tries to<br>articulate what exactly is it uh that<br>um constitutes the debt debt of a child<br>towards in this case their their mother<br>um the particular ritual that's being<br>um described here is uh uh in this essay<br>uh relates uh time he went to Japan and<br>saw that there was a tradition of<br>wearing a a<br>red flower if one's mother is still<br>alive in a white flower if one's mother<br>is deceased and he was moved by this<br>ritual and wanted to bring it<br>um to uh to Vietnam<br>um and so<br>that's<br>um what's being described here A Rose<br>for you sister a rose for you brother a<br>rose for any of you for anyone who still<br>has a mother or mother who's still alive<br>mother who still is a mother to fill you<br>with joy<br>um and then we have uh the ways in which<br>the the poetic sensibility here is tied<br>very much to an idealized version of the<br>countryside so this is in what's<br>highlighted in in uh red and pink or<br>um<br>now for mother is a sweet sugar cane my<br>um<br>a bunch of bananas a cluster of Eureka<br>Eureka being that's what's consumed with<br>Beetle nut uh Latin<br>the sound of crickets deep in the night<br>the fund of love that sorry the fund of<br>Love That founds a life so this another<br>way of explaining it I'll I'll skip this<br>next song we can come back to it if<br>you'd like this is the way some of the<br>same ideas around gratitude towards<br>mothers gets transformed in a uh<br>immediate post-war context for gratitude<br>towards<br>um those who sheltered uh<br>North Vietnamese or Vietnam gorillas in<br>South Vietnam during during the worst<br>this is told from this particular<br>post-1975 perspective but still bringing<br>in some of these these same ideas so<br>for the rest of the time I'd like to<br>look at some of<br>um oh I did shops chair I didn't mean to<br>do that<br>you can still hear me though right um I<br>just need to<br>do this again which will take a moment<br>um I may even have to invoke<br>um<br>Jeff who is over here and has been the<br>masterful tech person this would be a<br>great time if you have any questions<br>that you want to ask or formulate before<br>we transition in the second half we'll<br>look at carefully at some Cambodian<br>poems that go into a little bit more<br>doctrinal detail around some of these<br>ideas so we can looking some of the non<br>sort of the the perspective of Buddhist<br>themes in texts that are not explicitly<br>Buddhist now we'll look at some texts<br>within the Buddhist Force<br>um<br>well I'm going to keep trying to figure<br>out how to how to re-share this<br>um<br>Jeff<br>I think hopefully they have to go that<br>way<br>so Eric White has a question you have<br>emphasized indebtedness to parents in my<br>discussion uh yet it seems like<br>indentedness is felt towards many other<br>beings Beyond parents as well yes uh<br>this Buddhist poetry always prioritize<br>in foreground indentitors towards<br>parents in comparison to others so the<br>text that I want to look into next is<br>one that's usually called The V or In<br>Praise of the Earth<br>um<br>uh stop share no problem no problem<br>just be a moment folks thanks and so in<br>it begins with the first<br>um priority oh thanks with the first<br>priority uh being given to the Earth<br>um and then a list of a whole bunch of<br>other beings all kinds of deities<br>that are also repositories<br>repositories uh virtue or or beings to<br>be indebted to or to have gratitude<br>towards<br>this this x is interesting because<br>though it shows up in the manuscript<br>Edition it's not one for which there's a<br>living performance tradition in Cambodia<br>unlike the many other texts that focus<br>on gratitude to parents so similarly to<br>the I think the wonderful insights you<br>had yesterday around what's happening<br>with the role of print and the changes<br>for the um the changes that took place<br>in the Advent of print it seemed like<br>these earlier texts in the Cambodian<br>context that that articulated gratitude<br>that's much wider variety of beings uh<br>were not as uh emphasized in what got<br>printed from in the Cambodia case from<br>the 1930s onward so<br>um I think that's interesting to be to<br>reflect on and let's take a closer look<br>at this text and see if it gets at some<br>of um what you've asked in that question<br>so uh this text is called um again we<br>were in Praise of the earth<br>um and the Earth here is understood as<br>the Earth goddess this is uh the figure<br>that<br>um Elizabeth<br>who's here with us in the room today has<br>um it's done such wonderful scholarship<br>on uh and it's also understood as the<br>the entire Earth herself so it begins I<br>now shall chant and praise of the earth<br>Majestic goddess who supports the<br>world's creatures the birds the beasts<br>and all the trees her thick soil shows<br>her Merit her vast extent some 280 000<br>yojinas wide to mass unknown<br>mother to all she supports whole Realms<br>and all our homes never angry or prone<br>to move despite what we've done to her<br>we dig deep holes but Villages carved<br>paths and Roads plant fields of rice and<br>plow the mud we and piss she<br>doesn't mind those who repay their debts<br>to her shall be reborn and lofty Thrones<br>and interested in Awakening<br>so the way this whole text is framed<br>begins with the Earth as its foundation<br>but then it moves into a wide variety of<br>other uh deities figures to be indebted<br>to<br>so uh we have this brief simile around<br>the nature of Baba or of misdeed or sin<br>in the Buddhist context<br>um<br>and then<br>um<br>it gives a a framing of what to do if<br>you seek Merit then repay your massive<br>debts to your parents<br>relatives your preceptor and your master<br>as well as your debts to the gods the<br>moon and stars the wind the Sun the rain<br>above the fire below and<br>so uh by shravana here is here I've<br>Transit is the god of rice<br>um this is kubera the god of wealth in<br>another context but um in different Thai<br>and Cambodian contexts it also gets<br>modeled onto the idea of rice itself is<br>a deity sometimes like in a Cambodian<br>context it's known as Brentley<br>um other context can you say it again<br>also yes yes<br>um so very important in a Thai and Lao<br>context as well helps all secede as our<br>Guardian a mother to all a father to<br>blessed<br>so it's<br>um as you've uh pointed out Eric there's<br>this broader array of indebtedness to be<br>found<br>um it could be what's not being<br>mentioned here is maybe more local<br>deities or those who are involved of<br>relationship particular deities that's<br>not so much Being Framed the emphasis of<br>this text is around how to uh engage in<br>particular Buddhist practices as well as<br>both on a regular basis and those<br>connected to particular uh moments in<br>the calendar in order to repay this kind<br>of these kinds of debts so it begins<br>after that after stating you know what<br>one should do by then going through the<br>different<br>um<br>classes of entities one could have this<br>step two so it begins with the Buddhism<br>the Sangha<br>um and the way of repaying them is to<br>chant the epithets beginning with Etc<br>um and then the way of repaying uh the<br>Dharma is<br>et cetera the way to repay the sanghas<br>to to to begin the chanting they begin<br>et cetera all people should hear the<br>scriptures and chant Praises of Buddha's<br>great Reflections and Mass from birth<br>till Nirvana<br>listen wise ones chant in the morning<br>chant in the evening and chant at noon<br>hone your practice so that you reach<br>Heavenly Bliss then we have a list of<br>for very specific kinds of debts what<br>texts should be reciting so the next uh<br>line here goes Buddhism old repaid their<br>mothers through great sermons<br>The Deep teachings that help repay<br>maternal debts and this is very much the<br>way that the abitama is framed in<br>sermons and in other kinds of context in<br>Cambodia as well as in Thailand about<br>to repay their debts to the virtues of<br>their fathers they preached the tale of<br>the santara the final life of Lord<br>Buddha<br>I'm not so familiar with this framing of<br>the vasanthara javika being a way to<br>repay the debts to one's fathers but um<br>it is certainly what's being articulated<br>in this text now we have the chant that<br>we just looked at in Hun's poem that<br>we've begun today's lecture with that of<br>the<br>my for your teachers who guide the path<br>you should in tone<br>to repay debts and wipe away all trees<br>of sin<br>then for kith and kin in other words for<br>one's relatives you should recite one of<br>the tales of the banyas 50 past lives of<br>the Buddha and the other texts we were<br>looking at yesterday the Laos inside was<br>framed as being one of the texts coming<br>out of the Pena no it's not fair in all<br>versions<br>we must also repay our debts to the<br>Earth herself<br>to fire wind rain and vaishravana are<br>mothers true who care for us so repaying<br>our debts to the deities that embody the<br>forces of the natural world the the<br>elements and of course also Bryce that<br>sustains life<br>then we have this uh being plugged into<br>the calendrical context the fourth lunar<br>month<br>usually Falls around March uh is rare<br>indeed a crucial opportunity to pay back<br>debts so take good care on the full moon<br>of paguna build a stupid stand and this<br>kind of uh uh sand uh super deity Sai<br>and a tire Lao context or uh technai or<br>um<br>context is a very Central practice most<br>commonly see it on in the the weeks<br>preceding<br>um the solar New Year<br>um in mid-april but it can also be done<br>at other times of here here it's<br>advocating making it during this month<br>it precedes that new year<br>um in order to build a stupa of sand to<br>make the central Mount uh raising your<br>paying your debts to the vaster then in<br>Cambodian practice<br>um up to the present there's one Central<br>mound in the center and then it's<br>surrounded by four smaller uh mounds of<br>each of these subcardinal directions so<br>make a small mound in the Southeast so<br>the big one is of course to repay Earth<br>the smaller ones uh Southeast to pay<br>back fire who blazes bright as the full<br>moon endowed with light and Brilliant<br>Rays make another in the southwest to<br>pay back wind show thanks to rain in the<br>Northwest by shreveen in the Northeast<br>then we move on to what one does in the<br>next one in the next month known as<br>chaitra<br>and chitra usually Falls uh on during<br>the period of New Year in mid-april make<br>more stupids for the three days the new<br>year as the Buddha has guided us drop<br>all your work<br>um of course these are public holidays<br>during that time<br>um pray to let go of Bad Karma make your<br>heart come<br>finish the Mounds and do good deeds to<br>uh Buddhism pay respect to monastics bow<br>down to all your ancestors and Elder<br>kins so they live long if you're beset<br>with fear and bread of ghosts and ghouls<br>you must recite the Maha Mai the<br>Muhammad is a or Muhammad is an<br>important non-canonical put it to text<br>in in this and the terramatic in the<br>really the Cambodian context I'm not<br>actually sure this is used in tightened<br>files go meditate and to soothe your<br>heart and then in tone the friendly<br>prayers of this all gods will come and<br>listen close and then through the<br>repaying the Sun and the Moon it brings<br>up these two other birth texts that are<br>often included in Southeast Asian<br>Collections<br>and the moon and then this ends with a<br>closing<br>um statement<br>follow the Baptist Buddha don't be<br>heedless for such people Laden with sin<br>dropped to the house a reckless man for<br>forfeits his own ordained lifespan I'll<br>die alone is wealth used up in marathons<br>Merit and sin take after us a long<br>Shadow through samsara there's no way<br>out if you can't lick your lack of care<br>and I think uh this is related<br>um<br>uh to the question that you just raised<br>Alexander is a debt repaid through one's<br>intention in subsequent action to repay<br>it or could also be repaid unconsciously<br>does intention make a difference does it<br>enhance the potency of the debt being<br>repaid absolutely intention is critical<br>so uh this is partially why when we<br>looked at the examples of the aspiration<br>and making offerings in the inscriptions<br>as well as in the various first texts<br>transmitted in manuscripts intention is<br>always the first thing in other words<br>one has to very clearly intend that oh I<br>am doing this I am doing this<br>meritorious action and then I am doing<br>it for what purpose to whom am I<br>dedicating the Merit to myself to my<br>parents to all all beings to all three<br>of those categories this is the key<br>element in the repayment of debts within<br>a Buddhist context I think if we begin<br>to ask this question uh at the edges of<br>what we might consider a Buddhist<br>context then<br>um we might get some other more<br>interesting answers to your question<br>Alexander but certainly what we see uh<br>Being Framed here in this text is that<br>uh one has to do these things with<br>intention at a particular time in a<br>particular place following a set of<br>ritual instructions only then is this uh<br>potency as you describe it Alexander uh<br>really possible in repaying such<br>as the framing of the text<br>I'd like to move on now well let me<br>pause if you have any questions about<br>um go for it so um<br>to take actually<br>is there is there any mentioning about<br>the name of the<br>godmother for mother for water water<br>yeah no tell me more about that so in<br>Thailand we we call Prime<br>so I don't know if there is any oh<br>godmother in other words not godmother<br>yeah yeah<br>so um do you think um which is the same<br>as konkai yeah yeah okay um so do you<br>think so there is a<br>day<br>mentioning about<br>um they replayed it for the mother in<br>their secular literature<br>do you think<br>do you think Buddhists where do we play<br>a big role influencing a person who<br>wrote<br>um their secular poetry I think that's a<br>that's a really interesting and<br>challenging question so you know in the<br>case of green Theo the the Vietnamese<br>text there's all kinds of<br>um Buddhist references throughout many<br>of those are also in the Chinese text<br>um and<br>particularly ideas around Karma and fate<br>and ideas around uh indebtedness to<br>parents these are themes that show up<br>throughout East Asian literature as well<br>as Vietnamese literature<br>um articulating just what is Buddhist<br>and what falls under the category of<br>other kinds of ideologies is really<br>um challenging I think<br>so<br>um I you know I'm not sure how to answer<br>that in terms of<br>what's happening in terms of influence<br>in the case of I think it's also very<br>hard we know that that text is old<br>bickner argues that it it predates in<br>some sense that the overall narrative<br>seems to be a fertility narrative<br>I mean that's that's why there's such a<br>key role given to sex and sex followed<br>by death that follows from his uh<br>Viewpoint<br>um a number of archetypal myths across<br>Society<br>um<br>which are not really connected to<br>Buddhist ideas of course<br>um but there are the way the text has<br>been passed down and the way it's<br>recorded is filled with all kinds of<br>Buddhist ideas so what does that mean<br>how can we you know understand is is<br>that a kind of influence or not<br>okay we have a question from John<br>Marston for what it's worth the<br>Contemporary quiet poet in Luan has at<br>least a one short poem in which she<br>talks about the death a debt to the<br>earth oh fantastic oh I haven't read<br>that<br>um so uh that's wonderful and certainly<br>in the broader sphere of 20th century my<br>poetry there's been a lot of interest in<br>this relationship between the poet and<br>nature<br>um and I'd be really curious to read<br>that in the in the context of sort of<br>early earlier ideas in Kamai poetry<br>around deaths too to Nature Etc thank<br>you so much for bringing that up John<br>I'm going to click that so I can see<br>um<br>okay great hello Trent a question re<br>parental debt again are there a parallel<br>Concepts in South Asia's Indian Buddhism<br>medical ethics or perhaps elsewhere in<br>the non-asian non-butus world that is<br>similar to this Confucian slash Buddhist<br>concept of heal<br>um<br>that is show in Chinese<br>um uh filial piety uh and its Associated<br>sense of hierarchical indebtedness among<br>kids perhaps an indigenous culture so<br>I've been talking about sort of<br>um the Buddhist resonances of a term<br>like uh heal or um shell which is really<br>emphasizing the step between uh children<br>and parents that's what gets emphasized<br>most in in Buddhist settings in a<br>Confucian context we also get this<br>emphasis on the hierarchy between<br>siblings that becomes and also how that<br>mirrors hierarchies across uh the whole<br>social system that we see less often<br>emphasized in in Buddhist texts<br>um but I think the<br>certainly in um medical ideas uh if<br>um and we can ask<br>um Ben about this too<br>um within the the karma shastra World<br>um there are also plenty of ways in<br>which there are non-buddhist and<br>um<br>South Asian ideas around how to<br>structure these kinds of relationships<br>between parents and children sometimes<br>structured in terms of of debt going<br>back to early Buddhist<br>um<br>uh inscriptions and archaeological<br>findings in South Asia it's it's clear<br>that from very early period Buddhists<br>were engaged in<br>um<br>Pious acts in order to transfer Merit to<br>their living or deceased parents seem to<br>be particularly important for monastics<br>who left those kinds of inscriptions but<br>it seemed to be a key concept uh<br>throughout so I think<br>this is not really addressing your<br>question uh Quinn because I don't think<br>there's a way of describing uh<br>that whole conceptual world that is<br>healed particularly with its uh<br>Confucian resonances<br>um outside of a Vietnamese or East Asian<br>context<br>um and I'm not familiar with uh any kind<br>of specific term in an indigenous uh<br>culture or culture we might frame as<br>indigenous<br>um<br>uh like in for instance Upland cultures<br>in Mainland southeast Asia that would<br>have a a similar kind of concept but I<br>think there's a lot more to explore in<br>that Realm certainly these are these<br>questions are ones that have been<br>studied a lot in the South Asian and a<br>East Asian context but there's been<br>insufficient work done on how they play<br>out<br>um contemporaneously and also across<br>Eric White asks to what degree do<br>cambodians in practice follow the<br>guidance of this poem regarding very<br>specific ways to repay debts to specific<br>beings to what degree do they creatively<br>innovate other ways in response to<br>particular circumstances constraints or<br>opportunities and certainly<br>um Elizabeth Guthrie and John Marston<br>who are here who know a lot more than me<br>about what happens in contemporary<br>practice in Cambodia could speak to this<br>better than I could in brief I would say<br>that<br>many of the uh<br>like for instance building stand stupas<br>is remains very important in Cambodia<br>um reciting a number of the different<br>Brita texts that are mentioned uh is<br>still very important<br>um<br>do is the common way that that's framed<br>uh by monastics or by lay people<br>connected to these deaths to specific<br>deities in my experience no but I'm I<br>wasn't was not investigating this<br>anthropologically so I haven't done the<br>field work to be able to to say uh<br>in some broad sense what people are<br>saying they're definitely rituals that<br>I've observed but<br>just because something's happening it<br>might be framed in a new way and of<br>course there is all kinds of creative<br>reframing and Innovation that is taking<br>place and also a way in which older<br>practices are being<br>um brought back or renewed in certain<br>ways so again this is something that<br>um John Marston who's here is the<br>world's specialist on but there's a a<br>clear<br>at least in the way that cambodians talk<br>about distinctions between different<br>modes of Buddhist and practice Buddhist<br>practice in Cambodia<br>um between that known as semi and that<br>known as Buran uh between that<br>understood as modernist and not<br>understood as traditional<br>our traditionalist and within that that<br>very broad conceptual framework uh<br>temples that are invested in uh these<br>kinds of modernist practices might not<br>emphasize uh the building of these Sam<br>students whereas others uh those who<br>invested in more traditionalist<br>practices or build their identity around<br>those kinds of of practices of wood this<br>particular text to the second part of<br>your question Eric<br>um I have not been seen it used as a<br>manual because I this is one of the<br>texts um that there doesn't seem to be a<br>living performance tradition around so<br>even though it shows up across the<br>manuscript uh tradition I haven't heard<br>it being recited and that's that's the<br>way in which there'd be evidence for it<br>being used as a manual in that context<br>the next text that I'll look at has<br>again a lot of very specific details and<br>it is used as a kind of manual not a<br>manual for specific ritual actions but<br>for this process of repentance so maybe<br>with uh your questions in mind uh we can<br>I have a quick question sure<br>so in terms of<br>paying this for parents yeah help you<br>funds and it takes like aniso<br>so we yeah we at the first part we are<br>in snovice so this has been<br>um<br>regarded as<br>repeated it for fighter and I've been<br>when you become a monk so it's regarded<br>as um<br>we played it for the murderer so is<br>there any Tech show evident for<br>absolutely absolutely so<br>um<br>are found in Cambodia as well<br>um so for instance that that very text<br>known as um<br>is one that<br>um<br>has been known<br>um<br>I think since the 17th century<br>um so uh and uh that about Accords with<br>the earliest surviving manuscript<br>examples in Lana and Laos for the uh<br>particular text<br>so<br>um and aspects of it also show up in<br>Pali in this Central Thai collection<br>so yes all all of those cultures were<br>constantly sharing and translating tax<br>among each other it's difficult at one<br>project the moment where I'm looking<br>specifically at this<br>across mainland's southeast Asia and<br>comparing the different versions<br>um but the basic content yes is the same<br>so anything you'd expect in in a Thai<br>context or a lot of context what about<br>Sri Lanka<br>um<br>I don't think there's this same<br>tradition of these short anisansa<br>sermons<br>uh that seems to be a particular textual<br>tradition within this this smaller world<br>but the broader ideas around the around<br>benefits of ordination of course are<br>present but it may not be tied to ideas<br>around benefiting one's mother or father<br>for instance the Cambodian context<br>usually it's the novitiate coordination<br>is what benefits one's mother and the<br>big coordination is what benefits went<br>father<br>um in esoteric meditation systems these<br>are then tied to specific parts of the<br>body<br>um in other words the 12 Parts liquid<br>parts of the body<br>um that are the deadness and The<br>Inheritance uh from one's mother this is<br>detailed in Gregory kuroski's work based<br>on Lao and also other I mean in<br>Southeast Asian sources<br>um that the individual around the age of<br>12 is what repays that death whereas the<br>20 or 21 parts of the<br>solid parts the human body uh<br>inheritance of one's father within the<br>esoteric meditation context those are<br>repaid through uh the uh the for<br>provided by the B coordination at age 20<br>or 21 et cetera so<br>um those ideas are certainly present<br>yeah please so about Sri Lanka like<br>there's like this popular narrative<br>about if<br>Winter's man code so the Seven<br>Generations which would be escaped from<br>samsara something like that so it's not<br>like<br>I don't know whether it's connected to<br>death but it's like you are in a way<br>bringing entire generations with you to<br>escape from sansara oh that's fantastic<br>can I ask what seven generations means<br>in the Sri Lankan context it's like your<br>father mother and like other ancestors<br>and so<br>there are different ways in which this<br>is understood in Cambodia for instance<br>so<br>um sometimes it's understood as the<br>present one and then six before okay<br>sometimes it's the present one and six<br>following<br>and then sometimes it's understood is<br>the present one that is presence mother<br>and father and then three before and<br>three in the into the future okay I have<br>no idea what exactly I think maybe can<br>depend on upon region also<br>that is a possibility but at the same<br>time I have a question about this text<br>and because it's I think it's coming<br>from satsati and how Buddha was also<br>prepaying to like this tree so is there<br>any mention about that in the in this<br>kind of poetry like how Buddha was doing<br>it<br>yes so certainly<br>uh having trouble manipulating the PDF<br>my apologies<br>um<br>um Putters of old we paid their mothers<br>through great sermons so this idea that<br>we paid his debt to his mother through<br>preaching the apitama in double things<br>they haven't something that occurs again<br>and again and again<br>um the other thing that I think is<br>relevant is that<br>um chance of this genre also homes in<br>Cambodia are are<br>very frequently retelling the life<br>history of the<br>and they're retelling it from the<br>perspective of his relationship with his<br>mother with his people uh with<br>um<br>his relationship with uh princess<br>et cetera so these kinds of deaths and<br>familiar relationships are the the key<br>way in which the life is narrated<br>that applies to the present life and<br>applies to past lives as well so for<br>instance<br>um<br>one uh text<br>um<br>in a jotica context that gets brought up<br>a lot is suanasama there's also<br>um<br>wrote an important poetic version of<br>this in and Lao as well in the my<br>context sometimes the whole story is<br>told but most commonly it's told in<br>these very uh short<br>um episodes this is the whole poem<br>that emphasize uh<br>this uh way in which to want to savor<br>the bodhisattva in this particular<br>narrative is lamenting the fact that in<br>death he won't be able to<br>care for his parents and fulfill this<br>this kind of debt so that's one way in<br>which we see these kinds of ideas<br>showing up is that<br>getting at some of the things you're<br>interested about yeah so thank you sure<br>so<br>um let's turn now to another text that I<br>think will be helpful<br>um because since I was just talking<br>about the the parts of the body and how<br>those are tied to uh repaying one's<br>parents this is a text called uh the 33<br>consonants which then ties those parts<br>of the body to the 33 consonants of the<br>alphabet<br>um in a in a way that um is designed to<br>be mnemonic so that some someone can<br>recite and memorize this text<br>to both be able to engage in that kind<br>of meditative practice on the 32 parts<br>of the body as well as use it as a basis<br>to repay debts to one's parents so it<br>begins with eye Rouse my mind awake and<br>bow my head down low this is probably a<br>18th or 19th century Cambodian<br>composition to my exalted mother whose<br>virtues are Supreme I under my dear<br>father and yield my before my preceptor<br>note that in the Cambodian context the<br>mother almost always mentioned first<br>foreign<br>the legacy of these three are precious<br>Beyond Compare poor as I am what can I<br>do but sit by their side at death I<br>haven't got enough to repay my debts<br>with odds I've only got my heart and a<br>mind to see clearly the legacies of the<br>three who gave birth to my life<br>my preceptor translated the pith of poly<br>words everything he taught me holds fast<br>within my body as for my parents even<br>lofty meru can't measure but a third of<br>their soaring Grace and this and this<br>comparison between the dead of parents<br>in Mount meru is very common in<br>Cambodian time Mao context in a<br>in China that's under that's the<br>stand-in for the the overwhelming size<br>of this debt<br>they fed me cradled me and nursed me<br>through the night they guarded me from<br>foes and saved me from all harm I bring<br>these legacies to mind each day without<br>a lapse and of course back to<br>Alexander's point it's it needs to be<br>intentional in this kind of way sitting<br>upright I honor them through their<br>undying signs the virtues and the<br>consonants are 33 and all I've learned<br>them as the letters that gave birth to<br>my being the polyphrase<br>means within our very selves of course<br>this is what uh Begins the long list of<br>uh the parts of the body in poly it must<br>mean<br>um and hence inside my body I find these<br>33 then we have the list each of them<br>paired a consonant paired to a part of<br>the body this is again tied to this<br>esoteric meditation system in which uh<br>these very letters are the<br>the way in which uh living beings come<br>to be come to be born they are<br>generative uh in that sense<br>um and each tied to these different<br>parts of the body and then when we we<br>won't go through all the parts of the<br>body<br>um but uh when we come to the end thus<br>the letters are expounded study and see<br>them in your mind divide them as<br>appropriate memorize them Beyond doubt<br>21 consonants are Gifts of my father and<br>here it says those from which being the<br>uh the solid parts of the body<br>and then plus the skull here<br>my mother gave me 12 from<br>the wise know these 33 and honor their<br>true legacies what great rewards redoubt<br>the pious men and women who learn and<br>prize these words for ancient scriptures<br>say one who daily chants these letters<br>who take rebirth for evidence of lives<br>um and here it's interesting that it's<br>not one's whole family that you were<br>describing in the case of finaster<br>coordination in Sri Lanka but it's<br>talking about just the individual person<br>um as a blissful righteous Monarch<br>blessed with beauty and speech divine<br>so<br>um<br>with that in mind I'm going to go to the<br>text that maybe will<br>um spend a little bit more time on and<br>that is<br>this one called uh<br>so uh this is a text that does have a<br>living performance practice and before I<br>dive into it uh Ben has a question among<br>the sources with which you work do you<br>see any kinds of links between the idea<br>of debt you're talking about and the<br>Notions of debt in an explicitly<br>legalistic sense I.E borrowed Goods that<br>ought to be repaid<br>um with interest IG for example the word<br>and poly that's a fantastic question so<br>in the case of uh for instance between<br>bail that word this paired debt of your<br>mention of raising and giving birth to a<br>child no that's the the general term for<br>a debt that could resp respond to a kind<br>in different languages is not one that's<br>associated with debt in an economic<br>sense<br>um and so there's a certain danger in<br>translating it as debt where we get this<br>um<br>this resonance with this these kinds of<br>economic ideas around debt that aren't<br>present uh within that dimension of the<br>trans of the tradition<br>um others then prefer other kinds of<br>translations like Legacy or<br>um virtue Etc but to me the force of<br>debt is important because all of the<br>verbs that are being used like<br>um topsanong in a combined context or<br>sometimes thought couldn't in a Thai<br>context<br>in a Vietnamese context all really have<br>this sense of or<br>um<br>et cetera have this sense of repayment<br>in some sense even though I haven't seen<br>any texts you know and probably they<br>talk about email or something like that<br>um so I think that's<br>something I'd have to return to the text<br>to see if there is any kind of resonance<br>it's not something I'm familiar with<br>yes that's a very interesting way of<br>putting it<br>um and but I don't know where it's<br>coming from yeah but it doesn't it<br>doesn't show up so much in discussions<br>around<br>right that would be it's used in a much<br>more General sense to describe value but<br>that's an interesting way in which in a<br>word that explicitly means price car um<br>comes together that's a great Point<br>guilt guilt well this this next this<br>next text we could apply this term guilt<br>um uh but let's think about it I I think<br>I haven't translated anything using the<br>word guilt but let's think about how it<br>how it shows up because that would be<br>one way of understanding what's going on<br>in the text so this text begins with and<br>this this is an invocation of a poly<br>repentance pericope as well as a<br>particular verse that's used particular<br>set of phrases in poly that's used in uh<br>monastic coordination<br>um so that's what's being invoked by<br>happening at the beginning of the text<br>so in other words it's becoming<br>it's signaling that this is a text of<br>repentance this is a text of absolution<br>because it begins with this phrase<br>the sense but it's invoking this this<br>broader context<br>um<br>seeking Absolution I place my head<br>Beneath Your Feet by ten fingers raised<br>high in veneration both<br>then we get a key element of this text<br>okay I take leave and why this is like I<br>humbly request so Leah to beef to<br>say farewell to to be free from to move<br>Beyond uh my own faults from conception<br>up to the present this is to me a very<br>interesting idea doctrinal him because<br>normally we would think that uh one's<br>unwholesome karma in a Buddhist context<br>is something that<br>um having been committed it must uh come<br>to uh fruition and if it's a unwholesome<br>Karma it would lead to a unfortunate<br>result<br>this this text however is saying that<br>whatever faults have I committed may I<br>be free from the consequences of those<br>thoughts that's the the essential idea<br>here that's this phraseology of may I<br>take leave of my own faults we see some<br>similar ideas in<br>uh tie in Lao context as well not in a<br>more canonical expressions of Buddhism<br>or in sort of more modernist uh forms<br>but in a variety of other uh settings we<br>see similar kinds of ideas presented but<br>nothing quite as<br>um complete of a picture as we get from<br>this text so what follows uh starting in<br>the middle of the second stanza<br>is a a Life review beginning from the<br>moment of conception up to a full adult<br>life and here it's told from a male<br>point of view a full male life<br>um<br>what are all the ways in which we as<br>human beings have inevitably caused harm<br>to others<br>and how to seek absolution<br>of uh in regards to those could say<br>forgiveness this is a text about<br>repentance ultimately but these are<br>things that one has no conscious control<br>over I think again coming back to<br>Alexander's question that's the role of<br>intention here is is very interesting so<br>well uh here in terms of how it presents<br>pregnancy this this if you look at for<br>instance the work of Amy Landenberg and<br>others the idea that the fetus is<br>suffering that being that the station<br>gestation is not just difficult for the<br>mother but it's really difficult for the<br>fetus it's a key idea in Buddhist text<br>and here we get it<br>um sort of showing both sides both the<br>pain of the mother and the pain of the<br>child but emphasizing the pain of the<br>mother because it's about how throughout<br>life we have caused harm<br>um<br>uh and then describing the process of<br>gradually becoming a<br>developing fetus nursed and fed by the<br>umbilical cord then the body curling<br>around turning uh turning around this<br>quite interesting ideas around<br>embryology<br>um uh and of obstetrics that's being<br>presented in this text like a monkey<br>abused and whipped I turned and kicked<br>when my mother ate sweet desserts joy<br>and pleasure surge within me but if her<br>fault had too much salt or excess spice<br>I'd rather in pain burning inside my<br>cold up limbs shaking at the womb and<br>this is about the pain of the the child<br>and then we get more about the this is<br>the uh moment of birth itself<br>um<br>never quite understood really what's<br>going on here but at that moment I was<br>careless not yet conscious as if first<br>hurled to the final wall that Rings the<br>world this is the jackawala this is the<br>the wall at the edge of the Buddhist<br>Cosmos<br>um and only then leaving my mother as<br>Consciousness arose I scream as for my<br>mother I caused her searing pain she<br>laid above a blazing fire this is the<br>forget exactly what how this is<br>described in a Thai context but uh after<br>this postpartum right of laying above a<br>blazing fire<br>then we get the faults of growing up<br>um my mother raised and nurtured me<br>whatever the cost she made no mistake<br>she always bore that weighty task<br>my mother faced countless trials<br>sleeping in my urine and feces when I<br>was young I leave this sin behind<br>I've solve this fault my mother cared<br>for me with love I'll give me clothes as<br>I suckled her breasts even as I bit and<br>beat her chest<br>um<br>and then<br>the father is barely mentioned goodbye<br>the sin of ignoring my father<br>um which is the text in a sense ignores<br>the father but I leave such sins I may<br>my faults be clear<br>then we get expanding out this universe<br>of those to whom one owns a debt or<br>those to whom one has caused uh pain or<br>suffering over this life so beginning<br>with relatives<br>um I competed in quote with my relatives<br>hurling words of abuse I was heedless<br>when I fished taking creatures lives I<br>now take leave of those cruel sins may<br>all hostile remnants this is the sense<br>of uh uh Gambia and Khmer<br>um<br>and and Thai et cetera may all hostile<br>remnants be appeased<br>um I lack ideas skills and knowledge so<br>my relatives taught me all I know but I<br>was careless with their trust and I spit<br>back lies for all the times I mock the<br>Sun the moon of the Stars the Lords of<br>the wind rain fire or water or other<br>gods interesting that Earth isn't<br>legendary I take leave of those sins<br>seek to absolve the fault of deriding<br>the king lord of the realm Earthly ruler<br>I take my leave of all such sins<br>Etc<br>so<br>what happens as we get deeper into the<br>text we have this interesting contrast<br>between things that are one in theory<br>could avoid but the text presents them<br>as somehow inevitable so for instance in<br>the context of being a monastic first as<br>a novice I when I was a young foolish<br>novice my master taught me well but I<br>was naughty and rude shrugging him off<br>I was cheerless with my teacher I cursed<br>with anger behind his back<br>um<br>and then it flips to uh<br>when I was 21 ordained as a full-fledged<br>I chided and scolded my novice charges<br>telling them lies to help them learn<br>anger I snapped at them my face all red<br>I glared down at my students hoping<br>they'd beat their ignorance I didn't<br>hold back even with my slow-witted kids<br>I shouted and swore desperate for them<br>to learn to read the texts<br>um and again this is the way in other<br>texts we have from this period that<br>monastic education is presented it was<br>not uh necessarily one that was always<br>marked by a certain kind of kindness and<br>respect for the pace at which all<br>students might be learning could be<br>different but rather one uh in which a<br>certain degree of aggression was<br>understood<br>the same idea for how it describes<br>violence towards animals of course this<br>text is not advocating vegetarianism but<br>saying that somehow in the life of being<br>a farmer it's necessary to have caused<br>these kinds of pain or for instance the<br>way it deals with tax with practices<br>that it understands from the perspective<br>of this text to not be Buddhist but<br>nevertheless to be somehow necessary<br>when it came down with a fever an<br>astrologer checked for evil forces and<br>found the source I needed to free the<br>ones I hurt free the ones they hurt<br>meaning to to liberate animals because<br>one had caused<br>um<br>incurred this kind of misdeed or sin by<br>abusing animals so there are many rights<br>within a Cambodian practice sometimes<br>connected to the unless and other kinds<br>of texts of liberating two and<br>four-footed animals<br>he told me to tell a Healer that I was<br>haunted by those I abused and needed to<br>have a smoke and down a drink after I<br>die so these were necessary within this<br>non-budist framework but then the text<br>frames it as after I did I'll have to<br>swallow molten bronze for such<br>intoxicants betrayed the with this pure<br>um<br>then we have a section that I still<br>haven't quite figured out how to make<br>sense of everything else in this text is<br>about things one has done and seeking to<br>be free from what follows is a whole set<br>of congenital uh<br>malformities as well as other kinds of<br>suffering from the Perfection of this<br>text within the human condition like<br>orphan hood or ignorance<br>um that one is seeking to be freed from<br>in a future life<br>and some of what I've translated here is<br>uh<br>uh medical kinds of terms that don't<br>show up elsewhere so they're not<br>um this is not necessarily the only way<br>to understand what's going on here for<br>instance with goodbye plus Jewels<br>goodbye leprosy goodbye thrush and<br>Pedigo sores and lesions rashes and<br>Rings may I never have them there's a<br>lot to be understood that I'm not able<br>to do about the medical history that's<br>being described in a text like this but<br>the basic uh force is that these are<br>from the perspective of this text<br>certain kinds of entailments of negative<br>Karma and so to be freed from these<br>consequences is goes right along with<br>one's particular uh unfortunate action<br>so the same goes for what continues with<br>uh violating the five precepts and then<br>the part that I'll end with here<br>um this is taking us a bit away from<br>questions of debt but just to that we<br>see in the beginning of this text but<br>then it's taking this into this this<br>other realm of uh and this I think comes<br>back to Eric's question about to what it<br>to what extent do these manuals or<br>anti-manuals of what uh people are to do<br>this describes passage describes in a<br>very Vivid sense what people actually do<br>within this in this period in going to a<br>temple for different kinds of Temple<br>festivities but from the perspective of<br>the text are framed as uh misdeeds in<br>some way absolve this fault on holy days<br>I failed to keep the eight precepts<br>during New Year which one and the Reigns<br>Retreat during these times I I boxed<br>wrestled or organ masked held whips and<br>shovels Drank in the temple and defied<br>the Buddha's words cart races and<br>elephant rides hair in a turbine shoes<br>in my feet a parasol above my head a<br>post about my shuttlecock game my hands<br>clutching a sharp chisel I did such<br>thing and more in the temple in every<br>life and of course Temple festivals in a<br>Thai context or these kinds of uh born<br>in a context are filled with all kinds<br>of amusements and games and some cases<br>depravity that has what might be framed<br>in a certain way from a British context<br>but are nevertheless part and parcel of<br>what it means to celebrate these<br>calendrical or other important rituals<br>um then it describes like what does it<br>mean what what's an ideal way of<br>listening to chanting or sermons and<br>what are other kinds of ways that people<br>might actually be engaging in<br>um when monks chanted sacred texts and<br>preached the Dharma I didn't listen chin<br>in my palm I chatted with my neighbors<br>thinking of other places<br>um then this way it describes how this<br>relationship between things that are<br>framed explicitly is not Buddhist I<br>built a shrine for a tutelary spirit<br>um which was very important this uh<br>connection with in a Cambodian context<br>such shreds are worthless and wasteful<br>they open the gates to Laura realms<br>but nevertheless this is part of what<br>makes a life<br>in the lecture for tomorrow I'm going to<br>be going into this idea of some Vega or<br>shock uh the encounter with impermanence<br>and this text that we're looking at now<br>is actually uh most often ways it shows<br>up in living practice and in the<br>manuscript tradition is as an end of<br>life text and same for the many texts<br>dealing with shock and so I wanted to<br>end on it as a kind of bridge it begins<br>with questions about uh gratitude and<br>debt to one's parents are the ways that<br>we have caused harm to uh mothers to<br>fathers Etc uh in a life as well as all<br>the other kinds of beings one might have<br>harmed but uh as a transition to<br>thinking about what does it mean to when<br>these poems are recited in an end of<br>life context what kinds of affects does<br>that engender so let me end here<br>knowing that we have a little bit of<br>time for questions<br>um but not<br>a huge amount so my apologies for taking<br>people can't think of it<br>kubernetes I mean like you make those<br>donations when you build a house you<br>know but it's like you're trying to<br>describe the goals you're not trying to<br>make up her<br>well I sometimes if you dig a post<br>then you make an offering to<br>so that would be<br>yeah absolutely absolutely yeah that's a<br>great<br>stuff yes absolutely<br>then like in the beginning<br>so you sort of acknowledge something<br>that you're not really apologizing<br>yes I guess no that makes sense this<br>this<br>the ways in which invocation and seeking<br>apology or bearing witness these all can<br>merge together in some of these parts<br>particularly in the relationship between<br>uh petitioners and the department Sangha<br>or petitioners and various deities like<br>the elements Etc<br>Eric has a question in these Buddhist<br>poems to what degree is either the<br>character of debt or the method of its<br>repayment gendered taking on distinct<br>features depending on whether the<br>indebted person is male or female<br>this is a question I've been very<br>interested in with regards to I was<br>working on a project<br>on uh Cambodian nuns and the ways in<br>which motivations for ordination and<br>practice might be tied to uh either<br>rejecting the family or uh and the<br>violence of its patriarchal structures<br>or uh paying re-deaths paying debts to<br>particular family members often mothers<br>but but others as well and something<br>that struck me in in trying to engage on<br>that project was that<br>there is much that's gendered about<br>the text we looked at just now this<br>absolving all false of course is very<br>gendered it's told basically from a male<br>perspective it's a male life<br>but many of the other uh tax and I'll<br>just you know give an example<br>here<br>um<br>these are much more commonly recited<br>texts today in Cambodia around filial<br>deaths<br>um are<br>neither gendered in terms of what um the<br>child recounts what was sort of done to<br>them nor are they gendered in terms of<br>the method of repayment<br>put it and same for these kind of texts<br>on asking for mothers forgiveness<br>again there's no uh particular<br>implication of what's going on there<br>same with these kinds of laments that<br>might be discussed in this context this<br>word from this lament it really it's<br>told in such a way that it could apply<br>to a person of either gender the<br>genderedness really comes in with<br>regards to the it's the debt towards<br>mothers that gets emphasized more often<br>than debt towards fathers but there are<br>texts that also Focus explicitly on the<br>UNA or the kinds of Virtues Of Fathers<br>I'm just thinking you know that what<br>that promise on Liberty they have this<br>Stone carving that's supposed to be the<br>Midwife where the guy is like so the<br>husband I don't know if I really believe<br>this is what it is but the husband is<br>begging forgiveness in the midwife<br>because it's such a pain to<br>baby<br>and then the mother<br>has got the placenta and a box on her<br>head this is how I've seen it explained<br>have you heard this one no I'm not<br>convinced<br>but that's what's going on and so that's<br>definitely a gendered<br>Absolution so what<br>telepathy what is that it's like late<br>driver<br>um like is that really a woman or is it<br>a dwarf you know I mean is that really<br>the husband is that really a midwife was<br>there a cult I mean that's very unclear<br>to me but that's how it's usually gross<br>thank you<br>but that's true you've got to be really<br>respectful to midwives and apologize up<br>and down I do know that<br>so that's gender<br>so we're getting now I think to the end<br>of time and I want to be respectful of<br>all of your time and not have this<br>stretch on longer than it needs to be of<br>course if you're able to come tomorrow<br>or the next day any questions you have<br>from today you can ask them tomorrow as<br>well you can always email me or email<br>Ben if you have any other questions I<br>happy to address them in that context as<br>well so again thank you so much for all<br>of you joining from the zoom world for<br>your attention and of course very much<br>for your engagement and questions and<br>then for those of you who are joining us<br>here<br>um thanks again such a pleasure to have<br>this chance to talk<br>tradition of apologizing to the Midwife<br>you guys want to know why am I asking<br>about you do you know anything about<br>this<br>yeah<br>I mean there's a whole<br>relief devoted to it so it must have</p></main><footer style="margin-top: 2rem;
