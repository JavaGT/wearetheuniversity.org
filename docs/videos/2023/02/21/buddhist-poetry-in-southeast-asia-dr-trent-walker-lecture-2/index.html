program and<br>the Donald Kai Education Foundation to<br>be able to support the series of<br>lectures from Dr Trent Walker uh on the<br>topic of Buddhist poetry in Southeast<br>Asia yesterday was our first talk which<br>was wonderful we have recorded that talk<br>for those who weren't here and we are in<br>the process of<br>trying to establish a playlist from the<br>University YouTube channel to post that<br>but it is recorded and if you write to<br>us individually if you're you know very<br>anxious and you're Keen to have a look<br>at it before tomorrow for example<br>um you can email me and I'll I I can<br>email you a link sooner than that<br>um I I'm also going to give a very brief<br>bio to Trend because it seems like every<br>time I want to give a longer bio I feel<br>constrained by time but let me just say<br>that<br>um in addition to uh until Nirvana's<br>time which we generously provided us a<br>copy of which is right here which has<br>just come out uh too much Acclaim um<br>he's also recently edited a book uh a<br>major anthology of my literature Out of<br>the Shadows of anchor Cambodian poetry<br>prose and performance Through the Ages<br>which is just come out with the<br>University of Hawaii press as well<br>um or the well this is um from Shambhala<br>but that's from the University of Hawaii<br>two really important Works uh and you<br>know just in last year alone so<br>um and I know he's got a couple of<br>really cool projects in the works as<br>well right now um again maybe we'll have<br>time to talk more about that tomorrow<br>but I don't want to take up our time<br>today so without further Ado let me<br>return you to uh Trent so thank you<br>again thanks so much Ben uh thank you<br>all here in the room for for being here<br>again and for those of you joining on<br>Zoom my respectful greetings and thanks<br>to to all of you for for joining from<br>from far away from wherever you may be<br>some of you were here yesterday some of<br>you weren't and I want to begin just<br>with an opportunity for you to ask any<br>questions you have that came up last<br>time or things that you're wondering<br>about Buddhist poetry in general if<br>you're new so if we can just Again Begin<br>like we did last time but if you were<br>here yesterday just take a moment to<br>think were there any questions you had<br>that you weren't able to ask yesterday<br>you wanna you're still curious about or<br>if you're just joining us now and you<br>weren't here for the lecture on language<br>yesterday and you're showing up today<br>for this talk dealing with connections<br>between Buddhist poetry and prayer in<br>Southeast Asia and just something you're<br>curious about that you might want to<br>know more about or explore during this<br>this time we have together<br>and uh you can put that in the chat if<br>you're joining us remotely if you're<br>here in the room feel free to just think<br>about it write it down and share life as<br>foreign<br>so Dr Eric White asks is there any value<br>in distinguishing between Buddhist<br>poetry and Buddhist verse this is a<br>great question and one that I had not<br>thought about I've been using these<br>interchangeably<br>but as we will look at this a little bit<br>more today as well<br>there are a variety of<br>first forms that are considered verse<br>within different Southeast Asian<br>contexts that if viewed from another<br>lens might count as something like<br>rhymed prose or very lightly rhymed Pros<br>or<br>poetically structured prose things like<br>that so<br>in other words this question of how we<br>divide between what counts as<br>strictly structured poetry in a certain<br>sense between other forms of writing<br>that have<br>aesthetic and poetical poetic<br>considerations welcome in them is I<br>think something that's important to<br>consider so that's a again a wonderful<br>question for us to return more to today<br>I think another way to ask that question<br>is that sometimes poetry and verse can<br>be used to describe different<br>levels as it were in poetry so for<br>instance take for example and tie this<br>both are more and one might translate as<br>literature but one would usually think<br>of those in different echelons<br>or have a different relationship to<br>power so things that get called<br>would be specifically those that have<br>been<br>raised up and selected through this<br>process that began over 100 years ago in<br>Thailand to select what was considered<br>to be most representative of the best<br>literary Creations By Thai writers and<br>consequently those pieces that end up<br>being labeled<br>end up being products of the Court uh<br>things that have been celebrated in<br>Elite circles Etc whereas this term<br>wanakam is much more broad to refer to<br>all kinds of of literary writing is that<br>kind of Distinction something that's<br>present in this question between<br>Buddhist poetry which maybe has this<br>somewhat more elevated term we said well<br>this is not this first this is poetry<br>um yeah so anyways that's a that's a<br>wonderful question and let's let's keep<br>working through it<br>other questions those of you who are<br>here in the room or those of you joining<br>online if again if you're online feel<br>free to type anything in you'd like<br>I have a solution but it's not it's not<br>about poetry but it's about what I read<br>in your book please go ahead please like<br>I I read about the idea of paying debts<br>and I was yeah<br>Mesmerize and speak about<br>the common idea of paying that to the<br>Earth the<br>elements around you yes yes so in terms<br>of the overall structure of this week uh<br>today I'm going to be talking around<br>some doctrinal ideas connected to prayer<br>tomorrow I'm going to be talking about<br>ideas related to debt and repayment of<br>of debts so I think maybe the best time<br>to address that would be tomorrow are<br>you able to join us tomorrow yes okay<br>fantastic and I maybe I want to ask a<br>question yet in advance in this Modern<br>Age we have Technologies and if you get<br>food to my Kindle how can I pay them<br>do I feel grateful to my electronic<br>devices can I pay that can everybody<br>let's let's look at the tax tomorrow and<br>see where those Technologies might fit<br>in and the doctrinal systems that those<br>texts articulate who knows great<br>question<br>so uh<br>asks are there any particularities to<br>the practice of Prayer in Buddhism slash<br>Buddhist poetry that are fundamentally<br>distinct from other religious traditions<br>to say<br>question that I didn't think about but<br>it's one that we should address today<br>and I think I'll have to ask it back to<br>all of you as we look through some of<br>the ideas around prayer some of these I<br>think are distinct some of them we'd<br>find quite abundant parallels with other<br>religious Traditions so let's let's see<br>and we can discover together what might<br>be some of those continues and<br>discontinuities<br>let's let's yeah<br>questions that came up yes<br>out<br>the uses context histories the kind of<br>politics sociology behind the production<br>of poetry yes and so uh you know for<br>what the people who are who are both<br>sort of reproducing it who are chanting<br>it who are producing it in the first<br>instance<br>do they do we have Clues as to what they<br>imagine themselves to be doing or the<br>purpose them you know so I mean<br>certainly uh we can imagine other the<br>production of<br>texts in in other types of genres of<br>Buddha sex as having a particular kind<br>of purpose produced for a certain<br>audience for certain kinds of reasons<br>this it seemed like from what we talked<br>about yesterday much less sort of<br>context around the production of of<br>poetry and therefore<br>um there's a way in which it is sort of<br>already disembodied from a kind of<br>historical context even when we first<br>encounter it<br>um what then how then should we think<br>about that contextual element of<br>Buddhist poetry perfect question and I<br>I'm hoping again that it's almost like<br>you planted that question to be a segue<br>for what we'll talk about<br>um because this question of poetry the<br>way I wanted to end prayer the way I<br>wanted to frame it was through very<br>specifically contextualizable<br>uh pieces of verse in other words what<br>we see in inscriptions as well as the<br>kinds of prefaces and endings to poems<br>where the authors specifically say why<br>they wrote Such poems yeah<br>um so we didn't have that in what we<br>were looking at yesterday we were kind<br>of kind of trying to reconstruct that<br>but I I thought it might be helpful to<br>plunge into that today<br>and I think that will also get to Gwen's<br>question as well as like<br>um because part of my argument today is<br>that there's something particular that's<br>happening in Buddhist poetry in<br>Southeast Asia where prayer becomes not<br>generalized but autobiographical and so<br>that's really what I would like for us<br>to focus on and explore and we see that<br>Within These historically contextual<br>bicycles yes<br>so unless there are further questions uh<br>coming in online or here in the room<br>um let me get started so there was one<br>uh bit from yesterday that I I didn't<br>finish and that uh was<br>this is just for those of you who<br>weren't here yesterday we just put up<br>these slides again you could see some of<br>the questions we were thinking about you<br>know what is Buddhist poetry why are we<br>trying to think through these terms what<br>are some of the aims of uh this time we<br>have together<br>and spent a little bit time giving some<br>Geographic contextualization Etc but the<br>main thing I was talking about yesterday<br>was the story of how one particular<br>liturgical poem uh initially in Pali<br>gets transformed as it's translated and<br>reimagined across different languages in<br>Southeast Asia so there was just the<br>last part of it that I didn't get to so<br>one thing I wanted to quickly loop back<br>to from yesterday was this term this is<br>an accusative plural just dramatically<br>just to clarify what was going on there<br>in other words very literally<br>um<br>awaken in a um<br>a imperative sense here<br>um<br>those who are fit to be led in other<br>words this particular category of living<br>beings<br>in the midst<br>in the midst of what parisai and the<br>midst of the assemblers so that's<br>discrematically what was happening<br>the last part that I didn't get to was<br>we were looking at this Kamai version by<br>Satanta precia and<br>the<br>particular choices that he made both in<br>the Khmer version and the way that he<br>filled out uh this translation with the<br>back translation into Pali of the<br>portions that he added was that the<br>closing part of the the story and<br>Elizabeth I know this is a figure who<br>shows up in your work as well<br>um the monk uh hope who's<br>one of the two key founders of paravada<br>Buddhist Traditions among<br>um ethnic inner ethnic Vietnamese<br>speakers in southern Vietnam during the<br>end of the colonial period beginning of<br>the independence period in mid 20th<br>century southeast Asia and he translated<br>a having studied with leading Cambodian<br>monks of his day particularly<br>who would go on to become the patriarch<br>of the Cambodian Sangha he translated a<br>lot of material from<br>and Pali he had spent many years in<br>Cambodia as<br>an Aryan and got high school there<br>growing up and so was was perfectly<br>competent in both languages and I just<br>wanted to bring your attention to some<br>of the the ways that he translates this<br>text they these this translation appears<br>in a number of early Publications uh by<br>um<br>such as this one this is a close<br>translation of<br>two related Works attributed to um<br>the circle around to a knot and with<br>that and again at this mid 20th century<br>period<br>and the when looking at the translation<br>we see that it follows almost exactly<br>the same kinds of choices that we saw in<br>on this version in other words he's<br>working not off the poly even though<br>it's structured in the same way this<br>amongst the worst followed by the the<br>drum similarly followed by the added<br>Portion by on<br>um but the the way that he does it uh<br>allows for this as I mentioned before<br>this kind of performative parity<br>p-a-r-i-t-y<br>between these these different Traditions<br>such that something that had been a<br>living a liturgical tradition and like<br>my context could be immediately imported<br>into this Vietnamese context and the uh<br>particular poetic form that's used here<br>is probably the most popular form for uh<br>poetry both popular and Buddhist poetry<br>traditionally in<br>um in Vietnam or at least for<br>several hundred years for which we have<br>evidence for this form that's known as<br>meaning two lines of seven syllables so<br>we have seven syllables here and<br>followed by a line of six followed by a<br>line of eight<br>um with particular kinds of rhyme<br>patterns so for instance<br>rhyming as well as particular kinds of<br>tonal rules so we'll look a little bit<br>later at some Lao poetry that is<br>structured not so much around rhyme but<br>around particular kinds of tonal rules<br>and these tone rules are very important<br>in the context of Vietnamese poetry as<br>well<br>um and something because of the way uh<br>Vietnamese is written in this script<br>um starting from the at least on a wide<br>scale from the um end of the 19th or<br>20th century really allows us to see<br>very clearly how those different kinds<br>of rules are operating<br>so when we looked at just to fill in the<br>some of the context when we looked at<br>these examples of un's poetry those of<br>you who are familiar with indic<br>languages just uh but you might for<br>instance if you don't know Kamai this is<br>this uh transliteration here into<br>Roman script that follows exactly the<br>orthography of the text and command and<br>when transliterated in this way<br>one might seem many words that look like<br>they're in big word so for instance<br>thrillo Caribbean triloka the three<br>Worlds<br>the the three marks the wheel of samsara<br>Etc<br>ignorance even though these are not<br>pronounced in this way in Kamai so this<br>becomes of and but yeah becomes<br>Etc<br>but we can still see the ways in which<br>indic and local Southeast Asian words<br>are very closely woven together and this<br>is a beneficiary of writing in general<br>as well as the spoken language of many<br>languages in Mainland southeast Asia for<br>at least the past 1500 years<br>we see a different pattern when a force<br>when we looked at the case of this uh<br>translation into Vietnamese and that is<br>there are many words here that are like<br>Vietnamese writing in general that are<br>coming from<br>Chinese that are have a origin and<br>literary syninic as well as later spoken<br>varieties of Chinese all of which are<br>part of the many ways that words have<br>been borrowed and Incorporated and<br>reformulated in Vietnamese over the<br>centuries again a process that has been<br>unfolding over the past 2000 years<br>and so<br>um those of you who are familiar with uh<br>with Chinese might recognize some of the<br>the particular words that are being used<br>in this context so something like<br>um what would be in Chinese fun Tien for<br>uh becomes here in Vietnamese<br>for other kinds of phrases like for<br>to bow<br>excluded to Bowen's head to lower<br>oneself richly becomes label<br>Etc even though these are relatively<br>rare phrases and and spoken Vietnamese<br>particularly the verbs uh they and don't<br>commonly appear in most dictionaries of<br>Vietnamese but they're here they're<br>being drawn from this literary synthetic<br>vocabulary to very precisely I think in<br>hotong's intention here translate what's<br>going on we also see just like in that<br>phrase uh of<br>this kind of use of reduplication<br>reduplication is extremely important<br>across Southeast Asian poetic Traditions<br>particularly from the 18th century<br>onward<br>um how this<br>why things began to change around then<br>is something that I'm I'm curious about<br>but we certainly see this pattern in<br>Thai poetry but by the 18th and<br>particularly in the 19th century safe<br>what looks at the writing of supanpu I<br>mentioned yesterday it's really rich<br>with this kind of reduplication in other<br>words uh just like this phrase we saw<br>here<br>that's you know essentially saying the<br>same thing twice<br>um uh we also see that right in the next<br>line<br>in Chinese<br>um<br>ah<br>and the essential meaning of<br>are both the same I'm sort of literally<br>saving the world faring over or saving<br>um the world of humanity the world of<br>human beings<br>um but they're repeated partially for<br>poetic effect partially because it<br>corresponds to a long<br>tradition both in in Chinese writing and<br>Southeast writing Southeast Asian<br>writing of coming up with these kinds of<br>paired uh often four syllable kinds of<br>phrases so again this is something that<br>we see uh being replicated uh in this<br>text then when we look at the particular<br>ways the very skillful ways I think that<br>translated uh<br>versus in I just want to point out the<br>ways he's able to capture some of the<br>more subtle doctrinal details so for<br>instance we looked before in the<br>um<br>my version we're looking at this term<br>meaning the three marks of and<br>impermanence suffering and not self and<br>uh here we have<br>excuse me uh we have that being spelled<br>out in Vietnamese instead of saying the<br>three uh marks um it spells out what<br>those what were at least one way of<br>phrasing those inside of a sign of<br>um<br>and uh again pointing out that he's<br>really trying to<br>capture what's happening in the Kamai<br>text fit it into this Vietnamese form of<br>poetry but make it accessible to an<br>audience that was encountering terravada<br>Buddhism for the first time a number of<br>you asked yesterday about so where it is<br>Mahayana Buddhism fit within this I I<br>think at a later<br>um lecture this week I'll bring in a<br>little bit of Mahayana poetry as well<br>from Southeast Asia but even in this<br>case of a<br>translating terravada ideas into<br>Vietnamese poetry for the first time we<br>see this kind of resonance of a long<br>history of Mahayana Buddhist terminology<br>coming in through literary cinematic<br>into Vietnamese<br>um<br>another way we see that here's in the<br>this final uh the four verses composed<br>by UN in other words those new Pali<br>verses that he composed uh we see a<br>couple of interesting choices that uh<br>being being named so I'm just going to<br>take us back to the Pali to look at how<br>he's approaching uh this line here uh<br>which here is translated as to say the<br>group of who tasted the flavor of<br>Nirvana without remainder if we look<br>back to the poly there<br>as for those fit to be Len starting with<br>the group of five that is to put his<br>first five disciples that we see<br>depicted in this Cambodian or<br>um uh cloth painting he had them drink<br>of the deathless that is uh Nirvana<br>naturally but it doesn't you know talk<br>explicitly about who is in the group of<br>five or<br>what is the meaning of this term<br>deathless Etc<br>and we would find the same is true if we<br>looked at the<br>um Kamai it simply says the group of<br>five<br>um it's this uh here but not stating Who<br>belongs to it<br>uh when we look at the at ho thong's<br>version we see that he's able to<br>clearly grasp what's going on and insert<br>this kind of commentarial understanding<br>of how to best present to a Vietnamese<br>audience that would have been familiar<br>with these kinds of terms from a mahayan<br>Buddhist perspective uh what is uh being<br>implied here so we have here um<br>we preach the Dharma to all disciples<br>starting with the five Keen monks who<br>wrote the Dharma so that's this again<br>this invocation but then we get this<br>that is to say the group of what in Pali<br>would be known as<br>I think this particular sign of<br>Vietnamese transliteration is<br>perhaps from another indic language for<br>instance this is called in in Sanskrit<br>and then instead of framing the Rana<br>simply is the deathless we get this very<br>specific uh technical term<br>or yo Yoon in Chinese which is a uh the<br>standard literary Chinese translation<br>for a celebrity this kind of Nirvana<br>without remainder that is the experience<br>of uh or the attainment of Awakening<br>that is reached within this life as<br>opposed to at the moment of death<br>so I just wanted to bring out those few<br>last things from this text so to kind of<br>bring the the story to a close<br>um as we journey with this particular<br>verse that started just with one stands<br>in poly and the way that it expanded and<br>clarified in these various ways as it<br>traveled across Mainland Southeast Asia<br>so unless there are any questions at<br>this time as we wrap up this topic I'm<br>going to go into the next one<br>okay okay so does he actually say he's<br>translating<br>no<br>um and in the early translations it<br>doesn't say uh that these are coming<br>from my sources if one looks at the<br>biography of the Vietnamese language<br>biographies of how thong it clarifies<br>that uh yes that these things were<br>translated from from Kamai but it<br>doesn't uh indicate uh the author and<br>command for instance okay you said did<br>you find that in Vietnam or was it in<br>The Archives this<br>um sorry that was from I think either<br>Cornell or Michigan okay<br>um it was something that I had to get<br>over interlibrary loan from Berkeley but<br>yeah<br>um<br>I wouldn't know where to be able to find<br>these kinds of older Publications in<br>Vietnam I would find that to be very<br>challenging but that would be uh I think<br>there's obviously a lot more<br>so uh I'm going to move on to this the<br>questions that we started with here<br>around Buddhist poetry and prayer so in<br>invoking this term prayer I'm thinking<br>most explicitly of this this poly term<br>Akita<br>now This this term has an interesting<br>um kind of history in a modern sense so<br>for instance and this relates to when<br>your question as well uh that is the<br>this very term<br>um uh is one that's often used by<br>Christians in Cambodia to translate<br>prayer<br>so for instance uh if one is<br>say offering a short prayer before a<br>meal in a Christian context in Cambodia<br>I believe this is the term that's used<br>right I've heard people use that term in<br>that context<br>um I'm not exactly sure why that term uh<br>was used<br>um but testify testify yeah uh so if<br>there's all kinds of ways to understand<br>it it's a term that within the indic<br>context like so many terms uh within<br>indic religious context can have a very<br>wide variety of meanings so this term<br>becomes and it's Tibetan translation as<br>well becomes very important in the<br>vajrayana Buddhist context to refer to<br>kinds of<br>um<br>blessings within the tantric initiatory<br>context<br>um the use of it in taravada areas of<br>Mainland southeast Asia is really around<br>a kind of aspiration or vow but it's a<br>somewhat more general term than that I<br>mean literally it means like a a a<br>laying down or an implacement as it has<br>this term or a place uh within it but<br>Within These Buddhist contexts it's<br>expanded to this broader sense of of<br>Prayer of aspirations or in some cases<br>absolutions that might be made with a<br>particular mental intention<br>the more specific term that we'd find<br>for this sense of aspiration in Buddhist<br>context we see this at least some of<br>these terms in South Asian contexts as<br>and this is a Southeast Asian term that<br>combines Sanskrit and Pali words into a<br>single compound Sacha pranitan or<br>instance and these terms have a more<br>specific sense of a vow made to attain<br>something in the future an aspiration to<br>attain something in the future so they<br>could be referred to an aspiration or a<br>vow to attain our hardship to be<br>awakened and achieved Nirvana or to<br>achieve buddhahood this is a kind of<br>term that would be used in that context<br>and it's one that we would see often<br>frames and a genre sense what's<br>happening in these forms of poetry<br>another key term for thinking about<br>how their this relationship between<br>poetry and prayer gets articulated in<br>verse text is the idea of ani salsa<br>um this this poly term is usually<br>translated as benefit as in other words<br>the kind of<br>um<br>can you say it one more time<br>fruition Federation yeah fruition so the<br>kinds of uh beneficial karmic fruits uh<br>that result from particular wholesome<br>actions so anisansa DNA uh homiletic<br>context can refer to a variety of<br>sermons<br>um that are structured<br>as<br>um<br>first stating what some particular<br>meritorious Act is like listening to a<br>sermon or copying the davidica or<br>offering a toilet that's one of the most<br>important and highly uh revered kind of<br>um benef actions within this this<br>traditional context uh we're offering a<br>whole Monastery for instance the sermon<br>then goes to detail all of the positive<br>things that could result from that<br>so that's one sense of Anisa here we see<br>this sense being worked out in in poems<br>as well in other words whatever the uh<br>particular<br>active Merit whether it's paying homage<br>to the three jewels or writing a piece<br>of Buddhist poetry the author then<br>articulates what what benefits they are<br>wishing for<br>and are clearly articulating those<br>benefits is part of the logic of Prayer<br>in this Buddhist context a more<br>specifically Cambodian understanding<br>that we'll look at a little bit later is<br>this idea of some and uh<br>so some loan comes from the uh my uh<br>verbal Roots home meaning to to wish for<br>and this is the broader sense here is<br>one of aspiration and then this is<br>contrasted some sometimes with which<br>comes from this kind word Lia meaning to<br>depart from to take leave of<br>and this is connected to acts of<br>absolution that is hoping or aspiring to<br>be freed from the negative consequences<br>of unwholesome karma<br>we'll look at this a little bit uh<br>tomorrow as well because some of the<br>texts dealing with debt are really tied<br>into ideas around absolution<br>what I want to highlight in the<br>different pieces we're going through<br>today and I hope that can get us to both<br>the the questions that Eric and queen<br>raise for us as well as as well as what<br>you raised um been around the kinds of<br>historical<br>context for how particular authors wrote<br>and structured these pieces is this<br>question around personal and generalized<br>aspects of prayer now of course<br>Buddhists in Mainland southeast Asia are<br>very frequently reciting poems in a<br>liturgical context<br>these are often memorized in some cases<br>that they might be working off a<br>particular book or script but often<br>they're the these memorized daily<br>prayers of homage to the three jewels or<br>asking for repentance or say in a<br>et cetera all of this is part of the<br>body or the repertoire of tax that is<br>living in a very real sense within<br>people's bodies within their memories<br>and is being entombed and resonated<br>through their bodies on a daily basis<br>so much of that we might put in this<br>category of a generalized aspect of<br>Prayer in other words those texts are<br>not written to respond to any one<br>particular person's aspirations but<br>rather something that everyone can<br>participate in<br>but also uh when people go to uh<br>their own trying at home when they go to<br>a Buddhist temple when they go to any<br>other kinds of uh sites in the Buddhist<br>context when they're making Merit<br>through offerings or listening to the<br>karma et cetera people are also engaged<br>in personal acts of aspiration they're<br>deciding at that moment what is it that<br>I'm really hoping for what am I aspiring<br>for in my life who am I hoping to be<br>freed from illness who who has passed<br>away in my life am I hoping to transfer<br>Merit to Etc and so there's also this<br>whole personal aspect that doesn't show<br>up in the text that people most<br>frequently memorize for that we have to<br>look at texts that may have a specific<br>authorship uh that again prefaces to<br>longer pieces of poetry and again we'll<br>see in inscriptions that are often these<br>very personal records of piety and<br>prayers we can get a sense of what's<br>happening in this interrelationship<br>between personal and generalized aspects<br>of prayer and what role does diverse tax<br>or aesthetic texts written with poetic<br>principles in mind how do those interact<br>and then sort of this key idea that I<br>brought up before is is there a way we<br>can see Buddhist verse in Southeast Asia<br>as sometimes articulating prayer as a<br>kind of autobiography<br>that's what I want to explore with you<br>as we move forward<br>any questions here I'll just take a<br>moment to pause<br>so you're using prayer to as a<br>these are all sort of approximations<br>that you're using as the uh vernaculars<br>for what we're taking pre in the<br>category prayer yes right yes I don't<br>know if it's a good catch-all word for<br>the different things I'm trying to get<br>at obviously when the challenge whenever<br>of using words that have resonances and<br>other religious traditions we can<br>somehow sometimes bring those residences<br>to what we're looking at in another<br>religious tradition<br>um what sorts of what sorts of<br>other like local words would you would<br>then fall outside of the category of<br>prayer that some might people want might<br>want to map what are the choices the the<br>difficult choices you had to make<br>well I don't think I made too many<br>difficult choices I was looking for a<br>very broad word and uh in other words so<br>there's whole other kinds of things that<br>I would categorize as prayer like<br>um<br>ideas like bonban in a Thai context of<br>making a like a votive offering or a<br>having making a promise to a particular<br>deity or image at the Buddha that you<br>know may I<br>um you know if I succeed in my exam or<br>if I get well or if my relative gets<br>well or if I uh a child that I'm hoping<br>to be born is born then I promise to<br>return and repay that debt to that<br>particular deity or that particular<br>image or site Etc so that's I think a<br>whole other logic of prayer we see that<br>in inscriptions as well that<br>has different kind of vernacular terms<br>that fits uh within that I guess I'm not<br>I think I until you asked I hadn't<br>thought about what are the what are the<br>limits then what Falls outside of this<br>idea of prayer<br>um so Gwen has a question here I'm<br>thinking of the word uh in Chinese sign<br>of Vietnamese with the connotation of<br>pleading beseeching in the word gal<br>which is very similar to the word Psalm<br>in inquire those are often even in kind<br>of these translations between quiet and<br>Vietnamese we often see that and then uh<br>also this term uh wishing or aspiration<br>so<br>um absolutely there's a dimension to uh<br>beseeching supplicating pleading and<br>choir Cambodian words for prayer so<br>that's absolutely there Gwen in this<br>term or some gnome in the my context<br>um<br>we see you know if one looks at<br>different kinds of prayer texts in uh<br>Thai we would see that words this one<br>that you pointed out for us Eric here<br>karong<br>um certainly the the just the word Kaw<br>is one that we see again and again and<br>again so to humbly ask for it to request<br>is something that will again appear<br>again and again in these kinds of texts<br>um something that I find really<br>interesting and this you've brought up<br>Eric in the different kinds of this sort<br>of lexical field of what gets translated<br>as prayer so very often in Thai words<br>like one get translated as as prayer<br>I guess in that context I<br>I usually<br>um think of that as chanting or<br>recitation and then the prayer could be<br>part of what's being chanted falls under<br>that category of prayer because it<br>involves this idea of intentionally uh<br>asking for something or wishing for<br>something<br>um but there are other aspects of sort<br>one that I wouldn't necessarily think of<br>as falling under this broader category<br>of of prayer but I to me that's always<br>been a really interesting word same with<br>this term bhavana or pawana and Thai<br>that<br>um<br>in some consequences can mean meditation<br>and some context can mean this sense of<br>internally<br>internally reciting yes internally<br>reciting so internally reciting even<br>something like foothole<br>um or reciting the entire list of the<br>different uh Kun of the or the um the<br>virtues of the qualities that that can<br>all uh follow under this category of<br>pawana as well<br>um and then there are other terms that<br>aren't so commonly used in the Buddhist<br>context so on one uh for instance<br>doesn't so much appear in Buddhist in<br>very formal liturgical Buddhist texts<br>um but would be something that appears<br>in secular context very frequently<br>um same with karong<br>um<br>and et cetera et cetera so thank thank<br>you so much Eric and thank you so much<br>Gwen for bringing up these these these<br>comparisons so let's keep those in mind<br>as we look at some of the specific texts<br>and see whether it changes how we think<br>about ideas around prayer did you have a<br>yeah for some questions so um<br>do you have any like um<br>definition for to pray uh pray and<br>chanting so like in terms of delayed<br>like how long would it take like the<br>prey is much shorter or but what about a<br>chance that's so interesting I guess I<br>just thought about those in terms of<br>until uh<br>you raised this question I thought about<br>them as different kinds of verbs and not<br>not having anything to do with time but<br>something like<br>chanting referring to the physical act<br>of<br>interning words aloud particularly in a<br>religious context yeah and prayer is<br>something that can happen<br>out loud or silently<br>but involves specific intentional<br>actions that are happening at a mental<br>level as well uh that could be in terms<br>of offering homage in terms of making a<br>particular<br>aspiration to achieve something or be<br>freed from something that's how I think<br>I I thought of those in different<br>spheres but there's ways in which in<br>different languages those could could<br>come together<br>um so it's something I think it's<br>interesting for instance in the Thai<br>context this term<br>kind of that's a very common translation<br>very commonly translated as prayer<br>whereas<br>um and uh when you mentioned this term<br>gomwi and again which is again very<br>commonly translated as as prayer in a<br>Vietnamese context but for instance the<br>term<br>to recite the scriptures which is kind<br>of the closest approximation for Mon and<br>Thai I don't think would usually be<br>translated as prayer it could be if one<br>wanted to articulate for an non-budhis<br>audience like what it is that Buddhists<br>are doing when they go to the temple but<br>it's a way to build that kind of<br>bridge for people that want to<br>understand what is it that they would be<br>doing but they're quite I would think of<br>those as quite different actions between<br>uh Owen and uh LinkedIn to make this<br>kind of beseeching prayer and then also<br>wish that's inherent within that<br>Vietnamese uh term<br>um as opposed to reciting uh Buddhist<br>scriptures<br>but it actually means my prey in the<br>context of like Christianity or in<br>English<br>I mean the volitional element that sort<br>of the vote about the imploring element<br>of course that's a very<br>Protestant understanding of prayer<br>that's built into the term but that but<br>it's interesting this conversation is<br>actually I've never actually thought<br>about just how complex<br>this kind of mapping is is but but in<br>the kinds of you know because of course<br>the one that comes to mind for me is<br>distinctive is is Puja Karima you know<br>that the act of offering you know does<br>that and in the one hand does that<br>necessarily imply something like an<br>internal element or not I don't think it<br>does necessarily but yeah we're taking<br>up a lot of your time with it oh this is<br>great this is great this is why we're<br>here yeah so I'm gonna we can we'll<br>continue to discuss these things as we<br>look at some specific texts and I think<br>Ben will have a a basis to explore so<br>some of the examples I want to bring out<br>first are some ins epigraphic examples<br>uh from the accordion period from the in<br>largely once modern day Cambodia also<br>parts of modern day Thailand the uh<br>quote high period this particular<br>Kingdom and what's sort of middle<br>Northern Thailand today the uh maybe<br>I'll have one example from the YouTube<br>period and a few from middle Cambodia as<br>well so just to get a sense of<br>um how far we're driving yes well that<br>was the only way I could easily do that<br>with my limited psychological skills but<br>yes that is also how long to drive but I<br>think it would actually you would spend<br>a lot more time at the border and you<br>need to rest for snacks and sleep Etc<br>so the where the one where I want to<br>begin is to think about a this early<br>phase in indic religions in Mainland<br>southeast Asia and a number of examples<br>that I'll I'll bring out here<br>are specifically looking at the<br>aspirations and<br>ideas around what we might label as<br>prayer might not be appropriately<br>labeled as that made by female authors<br>or devotees<br>um this the when will I begin is an<br>example of this prashasti genre being a<br>very key genre of uh quite ornate poetry<br>usually<br>thought of within this genre of gavier<br>of this very um ornate style of writing<br>in Sanskrit in which<br>um<br>there is usually a praise in the<br>Cambodian context a praise of various<br>deities<br>either in a brahmanical or in a Buddhist<br>praises to the Royal figures involved so<br>this is you know principally a genre of<br>praise that's glorifying royalty and as<br>well as deities and was you know<br>foundational for the spread of indic<br>ideas across South and in Southeast Asia<br>as well as for the the spread of of<br>Sanskrit as a Cosmopolitan language of<br>power<br>this particular inscription is from the<br>very end of the angorian period probably<br>from the late 12th or maybe eight uh<br>early 13th centuries this is just the<br>very last bit of this inscription<br>um the last eight verses I think here<br>um the whole inscription is a little<br>over than a hundred stances long a lot<br>of it is fragmentary but again the whole<br>thing is quite long<br>um according to the last verse<br>um here uh<br>so she saw<br>um having laid down<br>whose skills eclipsed those of all<br>others and this is referring to Indra<br>Devi the queen who is understood to be<br>the author of this inscription on the<br>right there that's an image that has uh<br>is on the surface one of Prague an<br>important<br>goddess<br>often framed is the mother of all<br>Buddhas<br>I'm literally means the the Perfection<br>of wisdom<br>um but like many images from the<br>angorian period this is one that's been<br>mapped onto particular figures so this<br>is probably also a portrait of either<br>um Indra Devi or her younger sister<br>um in looking back through this last<br>night I realized I made some gross<br>errors in the Sanskrit so we won't look<br>at it too closely<br>but um<br>be and some typos and Etc but uh<br>what I want to point out here is just uh<br>how a little bit of how this genre works<br>so it's a genre of kind of hyperbolic<br>praise but it also is one that can<br>reveal to us what was held to be<br>religiously important at particular<br>periods of time<br>um and so here uh after this you know<br>long Praise of her younger sister who<br>was originally the queen and then she<br>passes away and then Davey Rises to the<br>queen this is Queen to King chair Vermin<br>VII one of the most uh powerful monarchs<br>in the angorian period<br>um and who was uh a promoter and builder<br>of many Mahayana Buddhist temples<br>um this is this part of the text<br>proclaims in their Davies uh faith in<br>and commitment to uh Buddhism but also<br>her great knowledge<br>for instance this last uh stanza here is<br>one one that's been<br>thought about for a long time as as to<br>whether it gives evidence to there being<br>Buddhist nuns in Cambodia during this<br>period<br>um there's no specific word that means<br>none in this context but it it's very<br>clearly showing how Indra Devi was<br>teaching women uh Buddhists<br>presumably texts of some kind so we have<br>some sense of what's what's happening<br>and these kinds of what's listed here is<br>Buddhist abodes or presumably uh<br>monasteries then we have again in that<br>the next stanza that follows a sense of<br>you know how she's teaching in these<br>different ways and then finally a<br>the penultimate stanza here a sense of<br>how uh she's trying to frame herself and<br>what her her life at the court was what<br>were the most important things that she<br>was doing was<br>um sharing her knowledge was teaching<br>others within the court<br>so this I just wanted to raise as an<br>example of it's very very in in the<br>Sanskrit not in my translation but in<br>the Sanskrit it's very very fine uh<br>gavia style poetry in Sanskrit and one<br>of the very few works that we can uh<br>securely attribute to a woman author<br>um I want to now go to just a slightly<br>later period to think about more<br>specifically around these questions of<br>prayer so this is a pattern that we'll<br>see very frequently in inscriptions and<br>in poems that they begin with something<br>that sometimes is described as a mangala<br>as a kind of an auspicious verse at the<br>beginning that usually takes the form of<br>a some kind of homage so the homage here<br>in in Pali this is<br>um not the very first instance of poly<br>showing up in Cambodia but it's one of<br>the first instances of a tax composed in<br>Cambodia that's written in Pali and<br>Records the the founding of a a temple<br>I bow my head down low eternally<br>to the most pure Victor that you know<br>who can bestow true Purity even to the<br>um and as well as to the Dharma and the<br>noble song in other words this is a<br>praise to the three jewels and it frames<br>the the whole text then we have what<br>happens after a statement of the date<br>um and we were talking a little bit the<br>other day around how these kinds of<br>um<br>numerical systems work so there's the<br>ordinary way of stating numbers and<br>probably in Sanskrit then one can also<br>use these particular nouns so for<br>instance moon is one pair is two moon is<br>one and blessing is eight<br>um and they're reversed in order in a in<br>the poly compound so that's we have<br>mangala as for Aid Hindu for Moon Yama<br>for<br>but again reflecting this this date we<br>have another date given below and then a<br>statement of you know what was taking<br>place what was the particular act that<br>gave rise for this inscription as a<br>legal document to come to light but we<br>see that it begins with this stanza of<br>homage again this is a pattern that<br>we'll we'll see when what is the role of<br>whether this homage counts as prayer or<br>how we might frame it but it's it's<br>something that uh patterns how these<br>inscriptions work something else that we<br>see in inscriptions this period are very<br>specific kinds of<br>aspirations that are being articulated<br>and this is this inscription is paired<br>with one in poly and one in Thai that<br>communicate much the same content but<br>each of them are a little bit<br>aspiration which is here in the in the<br>middle paragraph here that this is just<br>the end or just it's actually much<br>longer inscription this is just an<br>excerpt of it but this aspiration gives<br>a sense of how in a literary prose this<br>is a very elegant use of old Khmer one<br>of the most<br>um literary sophisticated pieces of<br>writing an old Kai but it is in prose<br>but it gives us a sense of how different<br>types of<br>aspirations with the made during this<br>period<br>um so in Old Kamai this would be<br>um<br>so we have a statement of what this<br>aspiration is no matter what Meredith<br>earn from the ordination this is a the<br>Thai King King<br>I think<br>um or whatever he earns from the<br>ordination and the distance<br>ordaining temporarily as a monk here I<br>crave not for the prizes of being born<br>as a universal Monarch it's more<br>interest or drama like we've only come<br>up with this was to lead living beings<br>across the three things of existence and<br>of course even though this sounds like a<br>Mahayana kind of thou it's very common<br>for this period in Pali Buddha's context<br>these kinds of vows for uh to become a<br>Buddha and then we have also a statement<br>of like what is the consequence of of<br>this kind of<br>foreign<br>here is in a from the almost the same<br>period a little bit later in so-called<br>High history<br>um relatively nearby this is<br>high and this inscription is apportion<br>in Thai this is a portion of poly this<br>is the portion of poly it's written in<br>this very clear style simple style of<br>poly verse<br>and here it's attributed to the to the<br>queen<br>and here she's articulating what exactly<br>she's aspiring for this is again a<br>pattern we'll see in inscriptions and in<br>Poetic writing throughout the centuries<br>since again it's the end of the 14th<br>century up to the present so she states<br>you know by means of this meritorious<br>action with this stereotype phrase<br>and then stating all the people who she<br>wants to be the recipient of this Merit<br>so the members for family uh as well as<br>um all others um<br>relatives and non-relators so it may all<br>be happy<br>um and then uh she gives another uh<br>sense of<br>how the benefits should be how she hopes<br>that they would be made manifest in the<br>world in this case by the power of my<br>Merit power in the sense of anupama here<br>the kinds of<br>um spiritually effective power<br>um that is attributed to Mariner punya<br>in this context so that they might enjoy<br>a more fortunate rebirth and then we see<br>the specific somewhat more<br>autobiographical dimensions of what<br>she's aspiring to<br>um so she says by the power of my Merit<br>may be a man in the future may I listen<br>to the lofty teachings of Maite that is<br>the future Buddha to come and then in<br>that context may she be a distinguished<br>disciple of the Buddha in other words in<br>the midst of that assembly made the<br>Buddha praise me<br>non-be equally equal to me across all<br>existences and the virtues led by<br>generosity Beauty Fame longevity and<br>wealth and though it doesn't say so<br>explicitly uh these kinds of aspirations<br>are again often tied to the idea of<br>um sometimes we see relatively more uh<br>simple aspirations or ones that are<br>articulated<br>simple as the wrong word uh an<br>aspiration that's articulated in more<br>simple language it might be just as uh<br>deep and complex and aspiration but<br>here's a this is sort of one example<br>there are not many examples of this<br>these kinds of aspirations that survive<br>in<br>um uh epigraphy from the UTI period<br>um this is one that's attributed to a<br>lay woman named<br>and here on uh line 13 with regards to<br>whatever Merit I have performed<br>um<br>uh I don't need her in other words<br>whatever Merit I performed I respired to<br>become a mother of the Lord in the<br>Hereafter who shall arrived in the<br>distant future and as well in other<br>words she hopes become the mother of my<br>prayer or some other future uh<br>so again this is articulated in prose<br>but gives us a sense of how these<br>aspirations might work another one this<br>is uh bringing us to back to not back<br>this is we'll look at another piece from<br>Uncle while later but this is in the<br>middle period of Cambodia long after<br>anchor wat was constructed in the 12th<br>century uh as initially as a question of<br>a temple it became an important site of<br>Buddhist pilgrimage during this middle<br>period in Cambodian history here's one<br>of the very earliest inscriptions<br>attributed to a queen of Cambodia at<br>that time actually the mother of the<br>king I think at that time uh in 1577<br>and this inscription gives In This Very<br>literary style prose<br>um not a formal form of verse but a very<br>literally literary style of prose<br>articulates what her uh her aspirations<br>are and it begins with this statement of<br>faith of uh<br>and uh<br>than these kind of very elaborate<br>statements on you know what is the who<br>is the here at the Buddhist being<br>depicted of Our Lord the chief Refuge<br>comparable to a huge towering junk it's<br>a big ship capable of faring living<br>beings across the ocean that is to say<br>this realm of rebirth A Wasteland and<br>then she gives this account of uh what's<br>specifically happening so it begins with<br>this opening prayer and then we have we<br>plunge into the moment of the present a<br>statement of the date just like we've<br>seen in these prior examples<br>um and here she's seeing how her son<br>restored uh Angkor Wat<br>and uh then she says I too uh am endowed<br>with Rich was Faith so not just her son<br>but she too did all of these uh<br>important meritorious actions begins<br>with this contemplation of impermanence<br>um and this will meet on Thursday uh to<br>uh tomorrow's lecture but the day after<br>uh we'll look at some of the the ways in<br>which contemplations of impermanence or<br>the shock that comes out in the<br>contemplation and permanence shows up at<br>Buddhist poetry just to show that that's<br>happening here as well and then her<br>particular Act of Merit is burning her<br>top knot into Ash in other words taking<br>some of her hair and making it into<br>lacquer uh to construct a Buddha image<br>at that time and then she gives a sense<br>of what she hopes to do it's not just<br>what she hopes to receive in the future<br>but a vow that she's making and here she<br>says I made the truthful vow<br>that is<br>um<br>to become that is a jewel of a lay<br>person that is a highly distinguished<br>layperson upholding the five precepts of<br>diligent effort and uploading the eight<br>precepts on every half full a new moon<br>continuously until the ultimate demise<br>this life and then we get what her very<br>um personal aspirations are for the<br>future just just State what she vows to<br>do and then this is also tied to what<br>she uh hopes and uh in that vowel<br>section we saw this term<br>used in this section here we have a<br>version of anisansa here it's phrased as<br>uh Palani Palani song in Kai or um<br>so this the karmic benefits the fruits<br>uh that she's hoping to attain and like<br>that other previous Queen she hopes to<br>be reborn as a man but not just not an<br>ordinary man one endowed with all kinds<br>of marks of wealth and Merit and then<br>again very specifically hoping to be<br>reborn uh at the time of maitreya to<br>ordain as a monk and just as she had<br>offered her hair in this present life<br>she hopes to then shave it off and<br>ordained as a monk in that future life<br>and not again not to be an ordinary one<br>but one who perfects these routine<br>aesthetic practices and the 40 subjects<br>of meditation Etc<br>um<br>so again I'm trying to bring out a sense<br>of which there's aspects of Prayer in<br>these historically contextual texts that<br>are quite uh generalized that we see<br>patterns across all of them but there's<br>also aspects that are very personal and<br>in each case the autobiography the story<br>of the individual person writing is tied<br>into it and so I'm trying to understand<br>what's going on in that interaction<br>between prayer and autobiography<br>this is just to bring some examples from<br>a bit later this is these are now<br>um one the one on the left is probably<br>late 18th century<br>um uh the Khmer version so sorry this<br>here is the is the polytext from<br>the opening stanzas to buducosa's<br>Samantha basarica this commentary on the<br>vinya<br>um and this is another example of how<br>this is a kind of generalized pair that<br>would be cited in Cambodia very<br>frequently<br>it has a particular set Rhythm that's<br>baked into the metrical structure of<br>this poem and then the translation into<br>Kamai just like we had that Rhythm and<br>Pali<br>young and that's my pronunciation<br>probably we get in the Kumai translation<br>of this same very frequently memorized<br>liturgical text I don't have it up here<br>et cetera so that it keeps this exact uh<br>rhythmic structure like we saw yesterday<br>and then just to give you a sense of how<br>that works in English the hello and the<br>final Refuge of all beings bound to<br>as our only teacher Etc<br>um and this is an example of a very<br>generalized kind of Prayer<br>um that again as we set it up to the<br>present sometimes we see reformulations<br>of that that appear in literary context<br>so this on the right is actually the<br>beginning to more than that we have that<br>um this is a<br>um I think the first photocopy of the<br>first premier uh printing of this this<br>text itself was composed in 1882<br>um and uh is a my reworking of<br>the Thai uh blah narrative the golden<br>Gobi narrative as articulated within<br>this Buddhist Treatise known as the<br>jaitanya that I've worked on in another<br>context but here at the beginning of<br>this literary text which is ultimately<br>at least one one gets into the very<br>um exciting story of a of<br>related to an East Asian<br>um version of Cinderella<br>um the very beginning is very much<br>framed in a Buddhist context with this<br>kind of prayer something that's<br>interesting here is that this is in Pali<br>so here we're looking on the right side<br>of the screen but the poly is not<br>um functioning according to the normal<br>rules of poly grammar it's poly that's<br>been uh made explicitly to fit into this<br>particular form of Khmer verse so this<br>form of primary verse is known as<br>and this this kind of verse is very<br>common in literary texts from the 16th<br>to the 19th centuries and has a kind of<br>you know rhyme scheme that as we would<br>expect for other forms of Cambodian<br>poetry at the period but it's usually<br>written in Kumai it's not usually<br>written in poly but here we have this<br>way in which it's been the Pali has been<br>adapted and we get the same kind of<br>rhyme system we would expect in the<br>um and then we also have this very<br>precise syllabic structure in the this<br>particular meter we have seven lines<br>Each of which has four syllables<br>um and that you know again creates a<br>particular kind of<br>um or it could be resetted into more<br>Stones<br>Etc<br>uh such that the the metrical structure<br>can be continued the grammar however<br>doesn't make much sense if one looks at<br>this uh from just the perspective of<br>poly writing the grammar is<br>doesn't really hold together but if one<br>translates the words literally into<br>Kamai and then imagines that this is<br>being written from that perspective then<br>often we see at the beginning of<br>Buddhist poems are uh again these kinds<br>of opening uh verses of Praise sometimes<br>they even uh connect to the very Act of<br>writing or reciting<br>so ordinarily in the context of offering<br>homage in a Buddhist context one might<br>offer candles or incense or lamps or<br>lotus flowers or drums and gongs or<br>music or et cetera et cetera all of<br>these might be offered as acts of Puja<br>or Worship in a Buddhist context but<br>what about in the case of a poem when<br>you're only reciting a poem when you're<br>not able to get up and offer these other<br>things or one is writing a poem how is<br>the act of worship how is this kind of<br>prayer refigured into the poem itself so<br>these are this is an example of a a poem<br>we've been talking about and then<br>probably in the early 19th century was<br>translated into my and there it's a very<br>close translation again because of the<br>ways in which these meters are very<br>similar in the two languages<br>but the the overall content of this text<br>you can uh guess from the first line of<br>the tie there that's about it's it's a<br>praise to the Lilac to the symbols on<br>the<br>um<br>The Souls of the Buddhist<br>um and it's an explanation of what all<br>those symbols are and also the benefits<br>the ADI songs of paying respect to those<br>symbols<br>um but what we see uh in these opening<br>lines is the way in which the recitation<br>of the poem itself and this act of<br>joining one's palms and reciting them<br>and using a lovely words so for instance<br>with my two my ten fingers as a blossom<br>in other words taking the fingers<br>together so that they form this<br>lotus-like blossom in place of incense<br>and gold candles so it the very Act of<br>reciting the poem takes place uh uh<br>stands in for ordinary acts of worship<br>the two eyes the eyes that may be uh<br>present or reading the poem and in place<br>of offered lamps the hair on the head<br>for uh lordly lotuses uh lovely words<br>here framed as what uh<br>in place of gongs and drums the ordinary<br>kind of Sonic offerings here are being<br>framed as uh what's uh being offered<br>in the recitation and then of course<br>what's happening internally the kind of<br>internal Dimensions to prayer<br>um here in time frame is<br>sort of my the sphere of my heart uh or<br>the my mental spheres that the intention<br>of that is being offered in place of<br>offered in place of fragment taste this<br>is somewhat of a bridge between prayer<br>that's generalized and something that's<br>made specific to the context of reading<br>and writing poetry we see this even more<br>um he was apparently a monk who resided<br>at what saw this is a temple near the<br>capital of during the 18th and 19th<br>centuries in Cambodia and the boat this<br>poem presumably<br>um<br>dates from that period as well and this<br>one is interesting linguistically in the<br>sense that it combines portions in Pali<br>and uh Kawaii so we see here again in<br>this same meter that we believe in the<br>same crows gate meter sir<br>and then continues<br>having made my head into a Lotus my head<br>and body offered in place of lotus<br>flowers my hands I offer them<br>respectfully raised up high so the same<br>concept as being articulated here and<br>then is linked to his biography because<br>the Magnificent who resides in what saw<br>the White Lotus Temple by resorted<br>resorting to the pattern of the<br>commentaries X expressed and recorded<br>this this is this idea that composition<br>has to<br>conform with the standards of Buddhist<br>exegesis is something that we see again<br>and again it's very it's actually very<br>rare for authors of these kinds of<br>Buddhist poems to state that they are<br>the author and most other cases either<br>those parts of the poems have been lost<br>and not transmitted over time because<br>they're not generalizable and not as<br>accessible to others who might use or<br>memorize the poems in some cases because<br>the the authors are not emphasizing<br>themselves but rather they're uh<br>creating this is something that others<br>can use as well but when authors do<br>mention their names or state why they<br>might be uh composing something it's not<br>usually from the framework of I'm<br>composing this out of my own uh<br>creativity but rather I'm facing it on<br>something that already had existed I'm<br>writing in a way that conforms to uh<br>precise exegetical explanation so this<br>idea of room<br>that is very literally resorting or<br>having relied on the original the uh the<br>pattern the<br>way that texts are laid out<br>um in accordance with the Holy layer of<br>the commentaries that is the way in<br>which he's framing the writing of this<br>poem<br>so we see something similar when we look<br>into some of the works of Lao literature<br>for for instance so this works on uh<br>um is perhaps the most uh by the by the<br>20th century the most famous<br>poem in in Lao and sort of held up by<br>20th century standards as uh<br>probably the most important work of of<br>loud literature this the picture on the<br>right this is from a modern reprinting<br>of the Edition by mahasi<br>who was the probably again most<br>important uh Lao intellectual of the<br>20th century he was actually born in Isa<br>and educated in Bangkok<br>um but uh dedicated you know most of his<br>life to this cause of Lao uh literature<br>um and again mostly writing in Lao in<br>that context and uh his version of the<br>text includes a lot of passages that<br>he's inserted because he wanted to have<br>it<br>um conform to this these particular<br>ideas that he had about how loud poetry<br>should look but if we look at the very<br>beginning there aren't any uncertain<br>passages and this this base this agrees<br>with the manuscripts of the texts that<br>survive and there are many manuscripts<br>of the uh uh narrative this narrative is<br>one that uh well this is probably the<br>most famous and important version of<br>this and most celebrated version of this<br>in Southeast Asia<br>um and this may have been the first<br>vernacular version we don't know about<br>that<br>um there are also versions of this<br>narrative in Cambodia where it's known<br>as<br>um and uh<br>uh uh the the author here is uh very<br>very skilled in how he used this first<br>form in in Lao this particular verse<br>form is usually known as gone and and<br>allow<br>um which is one<br>um one of various forms that are used<br>for writing in this this period probably<br>16th through the 17th century<br>um it is not one that has external rhyme<br>so again I was talking about most forms<br>of poetry in Mainland southeast Asia are<br>structured around ideas of external<br>rhyme that is the the ends of lines or<br>the sometimes particular syllables and<br>the lines rhymes with other ends or<br>other particular syllables and lines<br>that follow<br>um or there are linking Rhymes that tie<br>the different syllables together the<br>songs inside does not have those kinds<br>of uh Rhymes so it's a very different<br>effect let me just play for you<br>um well I'll read this part aloud and<br>we'll look at the translations then I'll<br>play you a recitation of it by one of<br>the leading uh<br>poetry and um<br>other sort of ritual recitation masters<br>of Laos you get a sense of how it might<br>be recited<br>um<br>so this is the opening part which again<br>we would expect this kind of uh mangala<br>this kind of opening verse of homage to<br>appear before we get we plunge into the<br>specifics of the author so we'll look at<br>that in a sec<br>um<br>very somewhat more literally this is<br>Glory May blessings overflow from the<br>sheer might and rare Renown of Lord<br>protector the foremost mind of the three<br>tools success I bow to his teachings the<br>Dharma over Sage the king lifting all<br>virtues to my head in honor of wisdom's<br>true Peak and then below that I've<br>um<br>I wasn't happy with my initial<br>translation because it felt too wordy so<br>I tried to give a one that fit into a 10<br>syllable structure in English that's<br>what we have going forward but<br>um that 10 syllable structure is a<br>compromise one loses out on some of the<br>words that are that are in the Lao so<br>let's just hear the recitation of that<br>um as it would actually be recited in a<br>um so this is<br>um<br>who's again one of the most famous uh uh<br>foreign<br>for me<br>so after this opening uh verse of homage<br>we then get the very specific context<br>instead of a date of when he composed it<br>we have a sense of what what the weather<br>was like this is something that we find<br>also occurring in later works of loud<br>literature it's a very distinctive um I<br>think approach to beginning a text like<br>this<br>I rumbled the rainy season sigh sign<br>when winds and storms assail the Earth<br>pink Orchid balance that free their<br>flowers a surface of seeds scattered<br>forceful above a massive clouds Loom<br>large covering the sun just as it<br>slipped behind a stand of trees the moon<br>Rose through the third month stars in<br>the year of the lovely Ox most term time<br>it was then that I<br>pondered the Dharma thinking how the<br>chief Sage cycled through samsara I wish<br>to compose to translate these texts into<br>Thai so appealed to the heavens for<br>inspiration when weary I bowed the four<br>Guardians the Lord of all lands to the<br>great garudas nagas gods and goddesses<br>and then in the part that I don't have<br>the translation up here now um he he<br>continues to go through<br>um<br>why he's you know asking for the support<br>of these four Guardians and all these<br>deities it's in order to compose uh this<br>poem and why why compose it uh why that<br>um in order to compose it such that it<br>can be<br>a mirror something to compensate uh to<br>contemplate<br>um in times of of worry or times of<br>difficulty<br>foreign<br>in accordance with the way I have paid I<br>have paid homage through my joined Palms<br>through the three doors that is through<br>body speech and mind<br>um offering to the three jewels at all<br>time now I<br>shall compose<br>unfolding or extracting the meeting from<br>this jyotica text and translating the<br>Dharma<br>um such that it can be something that<br>people in the world can enjoy<br>and then in the last line of verse seven<br>here he's saying that this is really in<br>the the um uh<br>that is the uh this<br>um<br>non-canonical or post canonical<br>collection of jadaka tales composed in<br>Southeast Asia and then eight is the<br>beginning of the story itself so just<br>giving you a landscape of how the<br>elements of prayer and the biography of<br>the autobiography autobiographical<br>details of the author get woven together<br>in the beginnings of of these kinds of<br>texts from inscriptions to literary<br>let me pause here there's I have I have<br>more materials to go through<br>um but I I don't really want to make<br>time for a discussion so let's<br>um and I will also have a sip of water<br>I might want to cap<br>so<br>yeah I hope those of you who are on Zoom<br>are regularly getting up walking around<br>or<br>um<br>but if you have any questions I think<br>it's even possible for you to unmute<br>yourself and ask that works as well as<br>the chat and Elizabeth you have a<br>no sorry so um live during this period<br>16th to 17th century and then the<br>scholar I mentioned from isan um<br>he uh it's a 20th century figure okay I<br>see I actually wrote that down<br>yeah sorry<br>Eric's got a question there oh yeah<br>please do we have any historical<br>evidence regarding the ritual practice<br>that accompanied the performance of<br>Buddhist poetry as prayer in earlier<br>centuries were there any distinctive<br>behavioral practices stereotypically<br>associated with praying that distinguish<br>it from other wholesome ritual acts of a<br>meritorious nature<br>well these are great questions uh do we<br>have any sense of how the Aesthetics of<br>the oral speech were coordinated with<br>the Aesthetics of physical activity to<br>create a total ritual performance so<br>let's let's work backwards here so I<br>think<br>in some of the examples we were just<br>looking at I think there is certain<br>Clues we can determine from these texts<br>around a sense of the Aesthetics of oral<br>speech<br>in this case we can assume that it was<br>recitation often with a particular<br>musical elements<br>whether melodies or more simple kinds of<br>chat that were coordinated with the<br>Aesthetics of physical activity and the<br>key Aesthetics that we see showing up<br>again and again in these texts when<br>elements of prayer are mentioned is what<br>the body should be doing so certainly<br>um certainly the as uh Elizabeth you're<br>demonstrating the ways in which<br>um the hands are being offered or placed<br>up high the way the body might being uh<br>seated in a particular way or the head<br>being inclined in particular moments<br>these are absolutely part of what Eric<br>you call a total ritual performance and<br>I think there's lots of evidence in the<br>texts both in inscriptions and in<br>literary texts that this is the kind of<br>context<br>something we we could talk about<br>later is the ways in which inscriptions<br>for instance mention aspects of chanting<br>and recitation or even borrow or cite<br>these kinds of chanted and recited texts<br>as if<br>um invoking this this living ritual<br>practice of the period and that allows<br>us to make these kinds of historical<br>connections between what's happening in<br>the present and what's happening in the<br>past<br>um so I think yes uh those give us a<br>sense of the kinds of distinct<br>behavioral practices uh<br>melodic recitation<br>um<br>disciplining the body in a particular<br>way to be respectful and for maximum<br>efficaciousness in the context of<br>Performing<br>um but I think there's probably a lot<br>more that we're missing and there's a<br>lot there that sort of isn't going to be<br>present in the historical record well<br>look at one text tomorrow that's always<br>fascinated me in this regard that<br>describes a number of things that people<br>do that they're not supposed to do when<br>listening to Buddhist chanting or<br>listening to sermons or when going to<br>the temples in a way that's a kind of<br>anti or sort of an episode anti-evidence<br>um<br>it's kind of the way like for instance<br>in the video we have all this evidence<br>of monastic's Behaving Badly which shows<br>us that those were real concerns these<br>are real things that were happening<br>presumably in in the Sangha<br>um so in the same way texts that<br>describe things that people might have<br>not supposed to have done in the context<br>of listening or the performance of these<br>kinds of poetic texts or sermons Etc we<br>can get a sense of that so I think let's<br>ask this question again<br>um tomorrow as well<br>and John has a question<br>well I thought I'd um<br>I<br>well first of all all this is just<br>totally brilliant uh Trent and it's just<br>amazing how you can bring all these<br>things together in the way you do and um<br>but just to play a little bit of The<br>Devil's Advocate meanings uh um that the<br>question would be is by using the word<br>prayer to what extent that tends to<br>project<br>ideas that<br>that maybe are not there in the original<br>context I mean what we see is is<br>obeisance we see the<br>um the body language that nowadays we<br>associate with prayer<br>um and we see people making vows and I<br>think you've been very careful in your<br>wording and not often you say well these<br>are aspects of prayer and so just to<br>keep that in mind I mean you started out<br>talking about different terminologies<br>for prayer and<br>and I wonder how much<br>these Concepts is reflected these<br>terminologies are<br>are<br>um<br>are are really there is a single concept<br>of prayer um<br>uh since I'm at home I could take off my<br>Marcel most from my my shelf and<br>incidentally Marcel most book on prayer<br>I mean it was it was never completed in<br>his lifetime and you probably know it<br>much better than me it hasn't changed<br>uh it has a chapter it as a matter of<br>fact it has a chapter called<br>um the prayers exist in Australia and so<br>the question do prayers exist in New<br>Zealand is another question but um uh<br>but um<br>uh you know and Moses really wonderful<br>and uh I I I'm tempted to just read some<br>things from there but of course being<br>mostly<br>he does talked about individual<br>um<br>uh uh<br>uh well every prayer is an act individ<br>the individuality of prayer at the same<br>time of course he<br>has a heavy emphasis on<br>on ritual coming from the tradition he<br>had is the communal aspects of it and<br>you are emphasizing<br>um this autobiographical<br>aspects which is really quite striking<br>that you could find it and that makes it<br>seem more like prayer in archons except<br>at the same time<br>uh then uh a lot of what we're seeing is<br>is<br>communal ritual which is<br>um<br>which is sometimes<br>but most would say that is part of of<br>prayer always<br>um but it's also<br>something different than<br>um<br>uh then what we sometimes think of<br>prayer in In the more modern Christian<br>sense okay those are my comments so<br>that's fabulous thank you so much I I<br>have not read that by Mouse so I I look<br>forward to checking that that out that<br>looks that looks very relevant for this<br>question you can actually build on<br>John's point because I think it really<br>helpful actually both urine Erics points<br>are really really helpful and I think<br>that that sort of it sort of putting<br>about your fingers on something that's I<br>a little bit unclear to me on<br>just to say that<br>um you know a lot we're not in the in<br>the kind of manuscript Traditions that<br>I'm familiar with I do see things not<br>unlike this these kinds of<br>elements of<br>um<br>you know that I'm offering such and such<br>a text as a prayer and you know the the<br>um<br>um you know punya come in a sort of<br>formation right uh but through in which<br>the in which the punya is the act of<br>producing the manuscript or whatever it<br>is and and as and then some various<br>kinds of analogies to<br>um the active manuscripts uh uh preserve<br>or manuscript copying as<br>um is analogous to offering to Puja<br>basically is is the imagery really<br>um<br>but I guess my question is then<br>is the prayer I mean in a way I see that<br>act and in this sort of individual<br>again the the the through my the my<br>through my punya action as the as an act<br>of Prayer in the sense that they're<br>obviously doing it for their own karmic<br>betterment the people who's writing the<br>prayer who's in my case you know writing<br>the manuscript or whatever<br>but it's not clear to me that these<br>would then be used as kind of a<br>liturgical texts by other people that<br>the prayer in other words is a kind of<br>it's It's the prayer of the it's the<br>prayer involved in the action itself but<br>it's unclear to me and I guess I wanted<br>to ask you how these texts are then used<br>by others in the context or if indeed<br>they are or where is the moment of<br>prayer as it were they I think you know<br>apropos John's comment like<br>because I think I think Joe correct me<br>if I'm wrong but you would might be<br>happier with the kind of approximation<br>of the language of prayer if what Trent<br>is referring to is the prayer involved<br>in the in the personal Act of<br>the creation of the of the verses as<br>opposed to thinking about these things<br>used in other<br>uh more more communal settings as sort<br>of chants or whatever so there's this<br>kind of interesting sort of spectrum as<br>to which into which the the the uh<br>the verse can fall right at the in time<br>one in the act of of preparation it is<br>something kind of you know you could<br>think of it as something like prayer if<br>we are to believe<br>the to take the words at face value<br>which I'm not sure we want to<br>necessarily because just like prashasti<br>these things are very formulaic right so<br>in in other words the the very kind of<br>rhetoric that I want to say is prayer<br>like<br>um which talks about the the the the<br>goals and the intentions the inner world<br>of the of the author<br>um are also following certain kind of<br>literary conventions that may not<br>approximate the inner world of the you<br>know that it may mean that the inner<br>world of the author is irrelevant<br>completely but if we're to accept that<br>at that time one there is a prayer like<br>quality to this and time too whenever we<br>see these things out in the world after<br>they've been composed do is that also a<br>kind of a prayer like moment for you I<br>guess is where I was leading with this<br>long question I think I think what<br>you've raised brings up for me how can<br>we distinguish those moments if on the<br>one hand there's this<br>way in which<br>what we think of as an internal process<br>or an autobiographical process is<br>following certain<br>uh formulas and even those<br>autobiographically written things get<br>used by others as a way to articulate<br>something that feels important to them<br>so<br>I'm a bit caught in this Loop yeah as it<br>were not able to distinguish easily<br>what's uh what we might attribute to a<br>single person what might fall in<br>something else and then how This this<br>term which I've realized I've<br>hopefully a nice wonderful can of worms<br>but it is uh is a uh yeah so there's so<br>many problems in a sense with using this<br>this this term prayer<br>um so maybe if I bring up one more<br>example that we can think through just<br>we'll take the<br>what what each of you have raised uh<br>Eric<br>um Ben and uh John and and see how it<br>makes sense in this other context so<br>here I'm going to switch to<br>um<br>and by the way if anyone else wants the<br>right questions or comments in will we<br>have the chat open so you can think of<br>it as kind of<br>you can feel free to do that<br>so here's one example that I I would<br>bring up and this is again an<br>inscription from Uncle what it's a<br>little bit later than the one we just<br>looked at a little more than a century<br>later from 1684.<br>and here the the author this<br>um high-ranking official named<br>um<br>it goes through this very I think<br>hyperbolic account of his own life and<br>all the things that he's offered and<br>then we have a sense of his of<br>aspiration so I if we can just look at<br>this a little bit together I'm going to<br>skip sort of for it's kind of it's a<br>little long so we can't look at every<br>detail but just to highlight how it<br>parallels things we've seen so far<br>um so it begins with this<br>um<br>asking the Buddha in a sense to be<br>witness to this account of Merit<br>and it begins with this uh<br>describing what his faith is like with<br>these very<br>um this is in this style of writing kind<br>known as which is somewhere between<br>verse and prose it's prose that's linked<br>with these kinds of Rhymes somewhat less<br>structured than cry in a Thai context<br>but<br>um again a way in which that's falling<br>between these two categories<br>so things like my fervent aspiration<br>grounded in truthful resolve a<br>meritorious words is vast Peerless<br>exceptional the fruit of the unified<br>mind it beams radiant majority of Jewel<br>among bloodborne blossoms subtle yet<br>Blissful Beyond thought charms and<br>dazzles adorned by the Delight of<br>fragrant sense and tastes soaring to<br>lofty Heights it shines as bright as the<br>best of lotus Supreme in its abundance<br>it arrives right at the auspicious hour<br>in all places equally completely<br>unprompted and here this is<br>um a formula we see something very very<br>similar to this in many other<br>inscriptions in the period but it's<br>presented as if it's something of his<br>own then we have this praise that the<br>Buddha similar to what we saw before<br>then uh we have his Reflections on being<br>um and on that account that's the<br>framework again same thing we saw before<br>so it's falling within this formulaic<br>pattern of stating the date and what he<br>did from the time he was 16 to 57 we get<br>a place<br>um but the list includes all these<br>Buddha images that he offered<br>um hundreds of them uh the Bodhi trees<br>that he planted<br>um the sand stupa the gifts of monastic<br>robes that he financed the digging of<br>Wells the shaping of ponds the clearing<br>of Roads the building of bridges some<br>five more occasions and offered fire<br>water cloth fine meals mat seeds<br>cookware water vessels and beetlebox is<br>still a monastic community and then cut<br>it off with flag ceiling drapes and<br>sponsored manuscripts et cetera so we<br>have this whole listing of the things<br>that he did it's this again it's a it's<br>an account of a life<br>then we have this poem that kind of juts<br>in here and we get again this bear<br>witness oh Lord and then for these of my<br>merits may I and every life that's yet<br>to come be born when each Buddha appears<br>to serve them with my whole ba may I be<br>rich flush with vast wealth Gold Gems<br>and wish fulfilling Jewels like the<br>merchanti whose wishes were Beyond<br>Compare may be kind toward All Creatures<br>giving them gifts with firm resolve<br>without any hesitation just like great<br>Prince<br>maybe like Prince Damia my heart always<br>patient and pure and my mind glow with<br>goodness pleasing to both men and women<br>should some commit capital crimes or be<br>condemned to endless pain may I free<br>them from such rulings so that the mean<br>green their lives but I exchange my life<br>for theirs just like all Buddhas have<br>resolved May served as the guarantor for<br>All Creatures the last Refuge<br>then we have the end part of his<br>aspirations<br>um and this this one is somewhat unique<br>in the inscriptional Corpus I'm familiar<br>with in that he doesn't just aspire to<br>become the in the future but to be very<br>specifically the 11th uh but the to<br>appear in other words in the anakatha<br>another politex uh there's a listing of<br>the next 10 Buddhists to appear but the<br>ones after that are unnamed so he's<br>claiming his spot in line as it were to<br>be the 11th<br>um<br>and uh so that's what I hear May then be<br>the next one to awaken with the wisdom<br>and inside permission for the fit to<br>lead living beings just like the long<br>line of Buddhism<br>past so when I first you know read this<br>um and the usual way this has been<br>interpreted is that this part is been<br>understood as prose because it kind of<br>this part doesn't scan as poetry and the<br>way it's written on the stone it just<br>looks like prose but yeah I also<br>recognized that this was coming from a<br>verse text that still recited in<br>Cambodia today<br>um<br>and that first text is<br>um<br>he was a she was a translation of it<br>um this is connected to an a poly text<br>uh this is a translation uh from the<br>from the Kamai um<br>and it's also connected to a polytext<br>that appears only that I've only placed<br>I found it is in the caliphant the um<br>a temple Chronicle of a temple in Sri<br>Lanka the I'm forgetting the name of the<br>specific Temple but the<br>much<br>I I can look up the the specific uh name<br>of this act but<br>um the content of that aspiration<br>um not the way it begins here but the<br>later content of it is<br>um some at some stage borrowed into<br>Cambodia presumably from Sri Lankan<br>sources we don't know exactly when<br>um though there could have been all<br>kinds of other intermediaries in between<br>but then shows up in this text and as we<br>move through this long series of<br>aspirations we see the same ones that we<br>just saw so after this opening uh verses<br>of praised the Buddha we get that same<br>content that uh something like<br>aspired to my eye on all future eons<br>every life that's yet to come be born<br>when you put appears to serving while<br>being might be rich flush with fast 12<br>gold jumps which Etc et cetera et cetera<br>um uh May exchange my life for theirs<br>just like I'll put a set result my serve<br>just a guarantored for All Creatures<br>their last Refuge then it goes on with a<br>whole bunch of other<br>um aspirations<br>uh so for instance may I recall the<br>three Vedas and all their spells to<br>Perfection with total ease and efficacy<br>like Lord Shiva best of the Gods may I<br>be blessed with the brilliant mind my<br>answers to riddles roundly praised the<br>resolutions of Doubt so marvelous they<br>raised the hair of all around my<br>awakened to the vastness if the Dharma<br>while still young memorizing the three<br>baskets of the canon in seven years when<br>my voice be resonant resounding with<br>sonorous tones charmingly ears of all<br>who hear just like the voice of Lord<br>Brahma so when I chant the two Dharma my<br>voice astounds the Gods on high hailing<br>them down from the Heavens to rejoice in<br>the Buddha's teachings and for me it's<br>quite significant that this this very<br>song is a very poem is one that is<br>recited with the melody in Cambodia that<br>is sort of celebrated as the most<br>complex or the most musically<br>um compelling<br>um and so there's this way if<br>contemporary performance practices<br>anything to go by<br>um that connects back to how this poem<br>which must have existed prior to uh the<br>inscription by some like uh in 1684 who<br>borrowed from it<br>um but it was something that was on his<br>lips that was on his mind that felt like<br>it was appropriate for his own account<br>of his life and aspirations but also was<br>coming out of this this broader more<br>generalized source so I just want to<br>offer that as a<br>something to think with in in the<br>questions you you all have raised not<br>sure if it makes it<br>clearer or less clear so but your<br>assumption sorry yeah but the Assumption<br>based on what you just said is that when<br>someone reproduces this yeah they're<br>they are sort of signaling their<br>um own kind of personal affirmation or<br>commitment to the set the sentiments of<br>the text itself there's two questions I<br>have with that like<br>um I mean I think that's an assumption<br>that we should hold out because I think<br>it's a question you know it's assumption<br>We can question but also what about in<br>the case where<br>um you know these things are<br>um you know sponsored by certain people<br>and therefore you know you know they're<br>essentially the I is the is the sponsor<br>not the person who's actually scribing<br>it does that add another level of<br>complication absolutely absolutely yes<br>describe might just have slotted into<br>the sponsor didn't even write it yeah<br>yeah I mean the sponsor may not have<br>really known much<br>whatever yeah yes that's very possible<br>we don't have a good sense of how<br>exactly<br>um the relationship between scribes and<br>The Poets or authors who are writing<br>these inscriptions who are composing the<br>words for them and the sponsors so just<br>make me look good um you know 30<br>centimeters or something yeah because<br>I'm not paying for 50 bucks I mean we<br>don't exactly know how this this<br>happened some of them are very clearly<br>planned out and they fit the space of<br>the stone uh very well others they<br>if they run out of space at the end or<br>they leave this big gap so there's<br>there's a really interesting range but<br>we don't have kind of contemporaneous<br>evidence that would show sort of what's<br>happening in those questions I think for<br>the for something that regards regarding<br>this text is very interesting to me is<br>that the content of the aspirations once<br>we get this deep into the text and the<br>the aspirations get more and more lofty<br>until they end with and with buddhahood<br>um none of those portions of the text<br>are ever recited today in Cambodia<br>one it's a change in time of ritual this<br>would take maybe um two hours to recite<br>the whole thing because it's excited<br>about a very slow Melody so that's one<br>dimension but I think the other<br>dimension is<br>it doesn't fit with the way the<br>religious aspirations that that<br>cambodians would articulate today<br>so it somehow feels it's not it's past<br>its time so that's why it wouldn't be<br>articulated because it was to be chanted<br>then it would why is that is that really<br>what I'm aspiring for it's just because<br>it's a very lofty kind of aspiration but<br>sorry I cut you off from this one you<br>were saying oh no no it's just same the<br>difference between Puja and prayer I was<br>going to ask about that and then prayer<br>there's always ego involved some<br>you know turning the clock<br>doing a ritual like just something I<br>um<br>I think you had a question too right I<br>was just wondering um so um<br>did you mentioned about<br>um some sort of ritual shins or the<br>inspiration<br>um for those who recite the text so they<br>will be indicate um<br>some sort of information<br>reform and the focus on our hardship<br>rather than Buddha buddhaust so that's<br>why the possibility that was really the<br>what they cut um absolutely that that<br>makes a lot of sense to me and indeed<br>there's a<br>um another taxed uh<br>when was this poem<br>uh written most likely<br>early 17th century or late 16th century<br>as we know it was already memorized and<br>current in the<br>um<br>late 17th century<br>so for instance today sometimes this one<br>is used in place so instead of a this is<br>just a title I'm giving it usually the<br>title is something like<br>a poem on lotuses or sometimes<br>lotus flower the offering of flowers<br>something like that but this the this<br>the same Melody is used and it's<br>following the same and some of the lines<br>are the same but<br>let's say this set of aspirations match<br>a contemporary doctrinal context so<br>instead of aspiring for with the hood<br>and to achieve all of these very lofty<br>goals it simply says here we're all<br>bereaved worn out beat up broken World<br>by worldly life sundered from our<br>spouses we're bound to suffer and rounds<br>of birth and death no one can help us<br>ours alone the anguish we offer these<br>flowers to you Lord so that we might be<br>from Fault be freed and break the grip<br>of age flee the pit of pain be death in<br>the dust and one day Delight in<br>Nirvana's repose<br>our prayers fly straight May trude by<br>honesty the obliss may come for us all<br>step by step so again this this way of<br>articulating it I think to your point<br>what I might really captures a more<br>contemporary approach to the the same<br>ideas<br>such beautiful translations man I have<br>Eric's has a oh great how if all did the<br>arrival of Technology of mass modern<br>printing transform the transmission<br>preservation and or use of Buddhist<br>poetry as prayer in the colonial and<br>post-colonial eras did it transform the<br>aesthetic<br>forms or techniques of Buddhist poetry<br>is prayer in any way did it transform<br>Buddhist poetry as prayer and to<br>generalize liturgical forms that were<br>distinct from prior girls now it's that<br>last question that I'm particularly<br>interested in that I hadn't thought<br>about before did it transform Buddhist<br>poetry as parents generalized literature<br>performs interesting from prior errors<br>that's that's a fascinating question<br>because these kinds of more the<br>autobiographical Dimensions that show up<br>in in Buddhist liturgical poetry that<br>was clearly designed to be recited but<br>also includes these statements about the<br>author and about the very particular<br>things they're writing I don't see as<br>much of that happening in the world of<br>print<br>um that is very common in in manuscripts<br>up to the sort of in the case of<br>Cambodia<br>um just like much of Mainland southeast<br>Asia manuscript uses continued well into<br>the era of print but up through the<br>middle of the 20th century there are<br>lots of examples of these kinds of poems<br>that have a very personal element to<br>them and those uh we have again evidence<br>for this from the 16th century up to the<br>middle of the 20th century for that but<br>that's less present today<br>um something that happened in the kinds<br>of Buddhist reform movements was also a<br>uh a unification of liturgical practices<br>so this happened uh with uh some of the<br>reforms really going back to the first<br>reign in the uh the beginning of the<br>period at the end of the 18th century<br>um it happened in a new way under<br>Kingman in the middle of the 19th<br>century in Cambodia those kind of<br>reforms really took off uh with ideas<br>from Supply<br>during the French Colonial period and<br>again that idea of liturgy as a really<br>bound vehicle of set texts uh that<br>everyone needs to agree upon and use<br>within certain teravada settings is what<br>gets imported in a very wholesale way to<br>the Vietnamese context with om and and<br>his his colleagues and<br>to me that's so fascinating because it<br>is something that it just formed in<br>Cambodia in the context of print so I<br>think that that question<br>um uh is<br>really speaks to the heart of what's<br>what's what changes were happening<br>through those uh changes in technology<br>this of course definitely happened in<br>Sri Lanka right like this this sort of<br>standardization and<br>um the attempt to kind of create a<br>unified sort of<br>liturgical kind of manual or givenia<br>type volumes I mean like basically<br>around the turn of the 19th century when<br>you go and look at the pamphlet<br>collection say in the<br>um<br>Museum library at Columbo it's full of<br>stuff like that<br>this is monks writing this is like some<br>kind of new standard prayer book for<br>um that you should all Buddha should use<br>it there in vihara and things yeah<br>great great<br>so I'm just another thing I'm thinking<br>is um like<br>presumably you should see<br>ritual and iconography right and I was<br>just like there's this amazing thing you<br>know the statue of driver in the seventh<br>for like how many years everybody<br>thought he was meditating yes and then<br>they find the arms and realize that he's<br>actually in some pair now is that a<br>prayer<br>you know I mean you know if he was<br>meditating we'd know he was into his own<br>that's definitely not prayer right this<br>is this is a namaskara kind of yeah it's<br>Puja but it's you know what these texts<br>are describing is what what to be doing<br>while reciting or listening to them or<br>making these aspirations those<br>aspirations are made with hands in a<br>position so but for Years everybody<br>thought he was meditating because they<br>missed the arms so that completely<br>changed so you've got to be able to find<br>an iconography is what I'm saying<br>you've got ritual yeah if you've got<br>prayer yeah oh that's fantastic yes<br>sorry<br>I mean this question is like really like<br>put your finger on something Trent yeah<br>it's just like very clear that it's a<br>really generative question yeah<br>thank you so much yeah<br>I am aware that it's almost five and you<br>do have a commitment at five this is<br>true this is true<br>um<br>questions that those of you here in the<br>room or those of you on Zoom that you've<br>you can always as I mentioned you can<br>always email them to me and we can raise<br>them tomorrow you can come and raise<br>them tomorrow as well it looks like<br>Peter might have something<br>I know I'm just saying thanks for your<br>talk I've enjoyed it<br>well if there aren't further questions<br>at this time let's uh adjourn here and<br>we'll meet again tomorrow at the same<br>time uh thank you again so much for<br>those of you coming in from far away<br>it's great to have your presence and<br>your questions so thank you thank you so<br>much teaching every one of you and thank<br>you to those of you here in the rooms<br>it's great to<br>share in this space with you and glad we<br>get to continue these
