who's<br>Elizabeth<br>teaching new religious program<br>s<br>Thailand<br>I'm doing some sort of like transition<br>translation examination of<br>from from time<br>hi I'm Brian I'm a PhD candidate<br>and I'm working on the life of Buddha I<br>it was so excited sort of coming to the<br>time but I just thought it's nice to<br>welcome and you know so you do yeah<br>um welcome back to those who are uh<br>tuning in<br>um I'm again I'm benjam doll I'm the<br>head of the religion program here and on<br>behalf of the religion program at the<br>University of otago in the kai Education<br>Foundation we're very pleased to have<br>our fourth in this series of lectures by<br>Dr Trent Walker<br>um<br>those of you it seems like most of you<br>have been here on the other lectures but<br>as before we're recording it um and we<br>put plans as you've just heard to upload<br>it to a YouTube channel once we get the<br>permission to make a YouTube channel<br>um<br>I just was in previous lectures I was<br>sort of giving little bits of transpire<br>and just one thing I wanted to mention I<br>was going to mention yesterday that I<br>hadn't mentioned before is that um Trent<br>has done work as director of<br>preservation and Lead scholar for the<br>manuscript heritage project which is a<br>part or is an initiative of the Buddhist<br>digital Resource Center to digitize 1.5<br>million pages of palm leaf manuscripts<br>texts in Kamai poly and CMEs from<br>Cambodian libraries and Rural<br>monasteries<br>um this kind of project<br>is really important in the field of good<br>studies and<br>um takes a lot of effort and I've never<br>done it myself but just something that I<br>want to recognize you for here as well<br>in addition to all your academic<br>achievements and books and all the rest<br>of it so um I just wanted to say that<br>um and uh without further Ado I will<br>hand back over to you trance thank you<br>so much and thank you

hope I hope you're getting<br>something out of this and this applies<br>to you people in the future as well as<br>all of us here if you have questions<br>after this time feel free to email me or<br>get in touch happy to talk about<br>so today I thought we could be a little<br>bit more<br>relaxed if that's okay I would love to<br>hear a bit more from all of you as we<br>look at some of the text together and<br>part of this is because the theme for<br>today that of shock is one that I've<br>I've worked on before and they have<br>things to say about it but<br>the topic of shock is no longer shocking<br>to me<br>so I want to be refreshed be shocked by<br>your shock as we look through texts that<br>deal with this these kinds of themes so<br>Indulgence have exactly thoughts doesn't<br>have to be contributions but just your<br>code thinking<br>as we work through these questions I'm<br>going to try to see it with new eyes too<br>instead of I could give you the way that<br>I've usually framed these things but<br>let's just look at the text together and<br>see what um we've found if you're<br>interested in some of the ways that I<br>have thought about this theme of shock<br>or aesthetic shock or shaking or quaking<br>this term that<br>um various ways that I'm trying to<br>capture this indic term some Vega<br>that's very important with regards to<br>Buddhist poems that are trying to<br>arouse a<br>sense of horror in the face of<br>impermanence and death that are trying<br>to to dislodge a kind of complacency in<br>the face of the inevitable suffering of<br>life I want to put his perspective<br>and I've looked at it in two main ways<br>one is in terms of the pairing of this<br>term samlega with another term basada or<br>brasada in Sanskrit has this sense of of<br>stilling or calming or settling of the<br>meanings of this term but this is the<br>particular one that's relevant in this<br>context<br>um and<br>which is this settling down kind of the<br>way if you can imagine you have a glass<br>filled with Muddy Water<br>if you let it settle the particles will<br>go to the bottom and the glass would<br>become clear so that clarity<br>is the other way of translating or<br>understanding this term Posada and these<br>this SATA and some Lego from some<br>Village like the sense of shaking these<br>are often paired in certain poetic<br>traditions in Southeast Asia whether as<br>well as broader ways of teaching certain<br>Buddhist ideas so that's been one of the<br>ways that I've investigated and looked<br>at this idea of<br>being stirred being shaken being shocked<br>um by how these these these poems are<br>framed and that<br>this pairing of these two terms and the<br>relationship between Melody<br>text and Doctrine is something that I uh<br>found<br>um through some of the teachers that I<br>studied<br>um Cambodian Buddhist chant with and<br>I'll just let you hear the voice of<br>these two teachers who<br>um<br>help me reframe what was going on in<br>certain kinds of Buddhist poems along<br>these ideas of shock that is exactly in<br>some way or some Vega and polyure sounds<br>good and uh or a sense of stealing<br>so let's just listen a little bit to um<br>you'll hear her voice first and then<br>followed by<br>and these are two teachers with whom I I<br>studied in Cambodia who lived in school<br>province<br>Monday<br>foreign<br>foreign<br>button group<br>looking<br>um<br>foreign<br>so what do you hear<br>and if you're joining us over Zoom feel<br>free to anything that comes to mind feel<br>sorry I guess the first thing that<br>strikes me is just that female male<br>thing that you get in Cambodia or the<br>Tijuana<br>there's always this gendered hair<br>and it's true of all<br>my song like<br>particularly Cambodian<br>yeah it's not the most common mode of<br>performance most often this text would<br>be done just by a single voice but when<br>it's possible and they have two people<br>whose voice vocal ranges can<br>either be on the same pitch or an octave<br>apart and that's comfortable within<br>their vocal range<br>um this this sometimes occurs we have<br>evidence even in inscriptions going back<br>to the 18th century of two voice<br>performances for these kinds of attacks<br>in that case it's for it was young<br>novices are being described doing that<br>but it continues in the present more<br>often with late people but sometimes in<br>Cambodian<br>absolutely<br>yes and that we see in all kinds of uh<br>artistic and vocal Traditions Beyond<br>Cambodia certainly in the Lao context<br>certainly in the Thai context all kinds<br>of<br>uh vocal report between male and female<br>voices is very much there here it's you<br>know a different context but it's<br>interesting that it has that kind of an<br>instance<br>it was just the torn of of this song is<br>it's it's funny like it's a sorrow and<br>brothers and just um<br>and that's what made them and um we have<br>written so Agony and pain whether that's<br>just listening from my background or<br>that's what they mean to convey because<br>it's in the words yeah yeah so there's<br>absolutely it's something that we're<br>hearing in the melody or in the what's<br>happening vocally but also what's<br>happening in the words because you were<br>being able to read what's what's going<br>on and then quian says that was so<br>beautiful there's a slight mournful tone<br>so this question of what this mournful<br>tone is where is it located how do we<br>find it what does that mean is it<br>intentional is it not is something that<br>I've tried to think about<br>um from others of you here in the room<br>anything else you notice or you have a<br>question about there's no no observation<br>thanks<br>um I feel that the tone of the<br>singer reflect the truth about<br>uh<br>not impermanence nothing is last forever<br>has to like me that's right the case<br>eventually right and it's reflected<br>unsatisfied and satisfactory yeah<br>and it's but<br>I have a kind of a doubt about how<br>nothing ever lasts right how can a<br>person<br>attain the<br>Buddha James would lead them to<br>the city of nirvana in your next poem<br>your poem number<br>35 and 36 oh same like some something<br>yeah well that's um first of all a great<br>observation around this relationship<br>between the sound and the sound of<br>impermanence of that with the sound of<br>the curve<br>unsatisfactoriness from suffering<br>distress Etc<br>um but on this second Point that's of<br>Eternal if I may say so question in the<br>Buddhist context and one that Buddhist<br>philosophers and people within Buddhist<br>faces have have wondered about how does<br>this idea of anappa<br>that things that we ordinarily think of<br>as somehow me or mine are not that what<br>does that mean for a particular Buddhist<br>ideas of suteriology that is Buddhist<br>case of a path to liberation of<br>achievement of Nirvana<br>that is not always fully worked out or<br>specified in the text<br>s that's the very simple answer to the<br>to the question<br>um but I think something that we should<br>pay attention to<br>in these texts that are on the surface<br>about some Vega on the surface about<br>this shock with the encounter<br>with impermanence or death<br>there's also<br>instructions that are given with regards<br>to achieving the path of Awakening<br>how do these sit within the same pole<br>I think that's a question we can ask I<br>think we'll be challenging to ask the<br>the broader question about how certain<br>doctrines uh can can fit together but in<br>a microscopic way<br>we can examine that question as we look<br>forward through these problems<br>I don't know if I'd say they're about<br>some Vega they evoke some Vega you know<br>making sure the the I mean the thing<br>that really just comes to mind I've<br>never thought about it until this moment<br>as it actually you know it's good that<br>you're maybe you had this experience<br>often I teach when I teach intro to<br>Buddhism<br>can we get to some point in thinking<br>about the Dharma and there is an<br>experience of like total despawn being<br>totally despondent about the world you<br>know like if you talk about Anita or<br>whatever and I've had some students<br>regularly almost every semester come up<br>to me after one of the classes and just<br>talk about like how depressing it all is<br>and all that and I've never said to them<br>and I think it's something I could say<br>now<br>or I mean you don't have to take but<br>just look at global warming right I mean<br>we all experience the feeling of<br>something total<br>it's not quite hopelessness but it's<br>yeah the sort of shock or whatever<br>the impermanence I think that's right<br>um look because this is this is a kind<br>of emotion this is in the I aesthetic<br>repertoire of Buddhism this is an<br>experience that is documented it I've<br>never thought about pairing it with<br>Posada I don't know if that's a sort of<br>a canonical move like I don't know if<br>that I mean I would ask you if that is<br>something that is considered a Posada is<br>considered to be the antidote to some<br>vague I've never thought about it in<br>that way I thought about it two separate<br>things but even being able to kind of<br>identify the emotion is as we know in<br>psychoanalysis because it's important<br>right so<br>um<br>yeah but that this experience that that<br>even even the most advanced you know<br>kind of<br>sort of put us steeped in the tradition<br>experience some Vega I can say that to<br>students you know this is an emotion<br>this is a Buddhist emotion you're<br>feeling<br>um I find it interesting that yeah<br>there's a sense of like despair in the<br>singing<br>um but<br>um some things that I've heard about<br>Buddhism this idea of maybe some sort of<br>like relief<br>when you allow yourself to to feel these<br>things<br>um<br>idea of this like there's a freedom in<br>acknowledging and like letting go and<br>like fully stepping into<br>um<br>yeah these kind of realities<br>um and I also found it interesting that<br>it's it's some and singing is it's<br>inherently ecstatic and this is a singer<br>allows himself to<br>to step into the song and be taken in by<br>it<br>um<br>but you know like doctrinally it's not<br>like you're meant to like read it in a<br>monotone voice you know it's kind of<br>interesting but it's<br>a pumpkin song<br>absolutely and that<br>um that link between the sound of the<br>poems<br>is one that we see of course here in<br>this example I've raised but everything<br>else that we've sort of written read and<br>discussed together over the past few<br>days is also written or oral performance<br>and has uh that<br>both aesthetic Dimension tools but also<br>just even more simply an oral Dimension<br>to it uh that we always have to contend<br>with when trying to understand what's<br>what's going on<br>I think this question of<br>Aesthetics and emotions is is really<br>complex are some Vega and basada<br>pathetic States or experiences or<br>orientations or are they emotional or<br>affective States obviously these are all<br>kind of contested terms but I think it<br>also it's significant for how we<br>interpret what's going on are these<br>songs<br>evoking some wake or at the about some<br>wake up what does that mean<br>um<br>very briefly to your earlier Point<br>um some vegan Pasada do not appear<br>as such<br>paired in most texts<br>that there's some pairing in the um<br>but most of that pairing happens in<br>post-canonical texts so for instance in<br>all kinds of other<br>um commentary literature discusses these<br>terms together so there are ways in<br>which they're being paired and certainly<br>uh the woman's whose voice you heard she<br>um emphasized that the point of these<br>kinds of songs is to evoke either some<br>Lega or Pasada in The Listener that's<br>the that's the point<br>um and so that speaks to this question<br>is that an aesthetic kind of approach or<br>is it trying to evoke an emotional<br>experience sometimes I've thought about<br>this within a South Asian<br>discourse around Russia that is the I<br>was just thinking yeah literally the<br>juice or the essence of an emotion<br>one that can be<br>appreciated aesthetically as when it<br>appears in the context of enjoying a<br>context in which russet theory was<br>developed by Gupta and others but it<br>it's another way of understanding what's<br>going on in how gauran is framing things<br>even though she doesn't use that term<br>there are terms similar to that in Kamai<br>for instance<br>um I know I'm not sure if this is<br>somewhere<br>um is that a term used in Thai<br>how would you explain or understand what<br>that term means<br>so somehow this meaning and and Russia<br>being uh combined together when it's<br>used in a Kamai contest has this sense<br>of the the aesthetic essence of a<br>particular line of of poetry for<br>instance it's not it's different than<br>like the the strict literal meaning it's<br>something else that we're we're getting<br>out of it so in a sense this San Diego<br>or in other kinds of poems there's<br>something else yeah you were going to<br>say yeah yeah in the sense of the term<br>it's a test yes it is but you're feeling<br>regarding too but it's taste in the<br>sense of not just the way it tastes but<br>the taste for so it's the taste of and a<br>taste four is that it was I think unique<br>about that Russia you know yeah<br>Anushka you had your hand up earlier<br>yeah I was thinking that although it is<br>like I'm like gonna build up on what he<br>has said<br>just<br>it is shocking at the<br>end at the same time it's a joy at the<br>end like because you understand<br>everything and it's beautiful because<br>it's sung yes so it's kind of<br>understanding in a very rhythmic way<br>also something like that<br>somehow those are coming together in<br>this this complex way and it's hard to I<br>find it's hard to disentangle all the<br>levels that's happening something that's<br>maybe not happening for us at least we<br>haven't notated it but maybe lead him<br>this is what you were alluding to as<br>well for many cambodians when hearing<br>these songs it'll it can be scary and<br>can evoke ghosts because they're most<br>often performed today in the context of<br>funerals in the past these were<br>um used to funerals but also really<br>important in end of life some of the<br>texts we'll look at later today are<br>really focused on this end of life<br>context which is a bit different than in<br>the context of the funeral but there's<br>still this sense in which these are<br>really scary and in that sense powerful<br>texts<br>um you mentioned listening to the clip<br>I'm also reminded of the Vietnamese way<br>of singing poetry which is a particular<br>way of singing that to me makes even<br>joyful or neutral poems sound suddenly<br>weirdly sad and desolate this is kind of<br>interesting in along the lines of what<br>you were saying because there's also<br>this sense even though it's sad there's<br>this kind of joy in it too because it's<br>singing<br>um here's another way of understanding<br>it perhaps there's something specific<br>about the methodology musicology of a<br>Southeast Asian way of singing slash<br>chanting even non-buddest ways like the<br>singing of folk songs Etc<br>that's a wonderful point and certainly<br>just a bare musical level and this also<br>came up with your point Elizabeth around<br>how this kind of alternation between<br>male and female voices evokes a whole<br>other range of musics outside of a<br>strictly Buddhist sphere but the kind of<br>Musical<br>characteristics like the mode the scales<br>that are being used as well as the kind<br>of<br>vocal ornamentation that's being applied<br>as something that would we would find<br>outside of this sphere as well and so<br>for every poem and any particular meter<br>in any particular Mainland Southeast<br>Asian context there's always multiple<br>ways to recite it multiple melodies or<br>cadences that can be applied Each of<br>which has different kinds of aesthetic<br>effects<br>this particular Melody is one that has<br>long been associated with this text<br>the melody associated with the<br>lamentation of uh queen mahamaya that is<br>the Buddha's mother<br>prior uh to her<br>what's actually the lamentation of her<br>when she's having passed away seven days<br>after the Buddha's birth and looking<br>down from the heavens and seeing that<br>he's practicing this these kinds of<br>um excessive<br>asceticism and and starving himself<br>that's the particular my context but we<br>see it in other circumstances as well so<br>just to give you another example of the<br>same Melody<br>um this text of uh<br>um<br>or the guidance or the words of<br>admonition of uh Queen mahamaya for Uma<br>Japanese uh<br>uh and who becomes his who raises and so<br>oh to these words<br>of guidance<br>I ask you now<br>to receive<br>d<br>forgive me<br>sense<br>so that's essentially the same Melody<br>that we saw in the other text but it has<br>a different resonance in the context of<br>this narrative<br>but equally any other kinds of Melodies<br>could be applied if this was a secular<br>poem and a more secular context one<br>might have a much simpler Melody applied<br>something like<br>um<br>uh and those that Melody though it's<br>in the same tradition it has similar<br>kinds of characteristics is very<br>different than the long drown out sounds<br>of aimi<br>and so that uh what's happening<br>musically is really important to<br>consider what I I found in trying to<br>study the text that outrun and others<br>labeled as evoking some Vega versus<br>those that were labeled as evoking<br>Pasada was that there were certain kinds<br>of of patterns<br>and those patterns were particularly<br>connected to scale and tonality when<br>approximating The Melodies onto a<br>western system<br>and so those that were primarily<br>associated with the evocation of some<br>Lega had these kind of dominant scales<br>either minor or major dominant skills or<br>sort of combining the two together so we<br>get this fundamental scale of something<br>like<br>this basic scale that we see throughout<br>all different kinds of uh Cambodian<br>music but here it's not a fully<br>articulated system like in the idea of<br>ragas in a South Asian context<br>um but we see these certain kinds of<br>associations where if we compare this to<br>The Melodies associated with Casada<br>um we have<br>huh<br>um<br>uh the uh<br>The Melodies associated with basada are<br>tonality associated with them so usually<br>this kind of<br>um<br>major pentatonic scale or sometimes a<br>few other notes added within that<br>context so just to give an example of<br>what that would sound like so we can<br>sort of contrast a little bit between<br>the sound of some wig and the sound of<br>Posada as articulated within the<br>Cambodian tradition here's an example<br>this particular text lotus flower<br>offering has a Melody that goes<br>something like this<br>no<br>more<br>me<br>um<br>and again these Melodies tend to repeat<br>every stanza but that's one that is<br>associated with these other kinds of<br>aesthetic understandings of what's going<br>on<br>questions about any of this before we<br>move on to some other texts<br>I'm going to say something really<br>irrelevant okay so with gamalon you know<br>there's there's a slantum and then<br>there's a pillock<br>and a pillow makes you feel creepy up<br>and down your spine and it's much older<br>and so which is any of these older or do<br>we know<br>Thai particular musical practices<br>particularly ones that are intangible I<br>mean organology is something we can<br>study over time in Cambodia but<br>recordings only go back so far yeah no<br>notation so it's it's challenging this<br>particular text uh was one of the ones<br>that we're looking at the other day and<br>goes back to at least the beginning of<br>the 17th century<br>um and as some of the earliest<br>sort of evidence for<br>um this kind of tradition in Cambodia<br>um but obviously the themes of sombrega<br>show up all the time in even earlier<br>inscriptions as well does that yeah yeah<br>it's hard to for me figure out<br>musicologists have worked out<br>help yeah no I don't I don't I don't<br>think so certainly this scale uh that's<br>associated with some Vega that one is<br>associated with the cut with there are<br>two major traditions of my traditional<br>music just to take the Cambodian case<br>for an example one are those that are uh<br>the music used traditionally for<br>weddings and for Spirit possession<br>ceremonies<br>um sometimes referred to as uh roleplay<br>Moran this set of instruments which are<br>instruments we've known have been used<br>in Cambodia for a very long time<br>um uh represents one tradition that<br>usually uses scales similar to that<br>first<br>um chant that we heard<br>then there's another tradition which is<br>we know is actually very old and has<br>been in Cambodia a long time but<br>sometimes uh today it's called Uh<br>playing uh but in the past sometimes<br>sorry<br>claim wouldn't be it is called uh<br>plansium or Siamese music that's<br>anathema to a modernist or particularly<br>nationalist sensibility to think of this<br>as time music because it's very clear<br>evidence that it's been used in Cambodia<br>since the end where in Period based on<br>organology but it's there's a clear<br>contrast musically between the the<br>Styles<br>um and definitely that also applies to<br>what's happening with regards to the<br>notes and scales that we see happening<br>one example that<br>the one that had been beat uh type we<br>art historical evidence for it going<br>back to the Emporium period but the<br>other form uh is usually assumed to be<br>even older to be somehow pre<br>um<br>yes but it's hard to say you know what<br>has been changing over time<br>but that does it could have this<br>Resonance of something that's older<br>within how people perceive it and I<br>think that's what's particularly<br>relevant I have to ask how the hell do<br>so let's let's look at some other texts<br>and we'll continue our our conversations<br>in in that vein so<br>um<br>so we were just thinking about some Wega<br>in the context of the life of the Buddha<br>so let's look at a couple of texts that<br>deal with the life of the but are also<br>associated with some Vega<br>um these this is actually part of a<br>uh and so that's what it's evoking is<br>this broader scriptural context<br>um and in this particular scene in the<br>mahapara this is the last<br>um sermon uh of the prior to his passing<br>away into uh Nevada uh is<br>his guidance to his uh attendant Ananda<br>saying that you know I'm I'm going to<br>die<br>after I die after I pass away into<br>Nirvana it's up to you uh and all the<br>other uh<br>of my disciples to carry on the the<br>teachings<br>so<br>this is a song that's on the surface<br>about the life to put in about this very<br>important moment but this like many of<br>these other kinds of songs today are<br>performed typically in funerals<br>and so it's also about the life and the<br>death of the people who are there and<br>grieving at that funeral it's not<br>explicitly saying that but that's the<br>context in which everyone is<br>participating in<br>um so this one uses a different Melody<br>because it's in this<br>um this five six five six uh uh promo<br>code or brahma's song meter<br>um they're traditionally 12 Melodies<br>associated with this meter uh the one<br>that's associated with this tax is<br>actually named after this text it seems<br>to be a um<br>a kind of locus for this Locus classicus<br>for this meter and the melody goes<br>something like this I'll just do it in<br>English here<br>here<br>come here now<br>don't delay<br>all alone<br>oh<br>I needlessly<br>five Aggregates will break down and<br>dissolve stay stay on the contemplate<br>your own life<br>these days your body as brittle as fired<br>clay<br>won't last for long bound to break in<br>pieces please dear Ananda contemplate<br>this deeply when I pass away you spare<br>my teaching truly this Dharma remains<br>with anyone whose heart is bright and<br>clear<br>that is whose heart is characterized by<br>now the realized one that is<br>shall end in Nirvana times curse comes<br>so the phrases whose heart is bright and<br>clear<br>bright and clear is actually Posada so<br>the I think the Kamai there<br>is<br>foreign<br>truly remains or has made manifest in<br>anyone by omian<br>that has a heart which is which means<br>cleared cleared away like cleared away<br>from any kind of pollution or defilement<br>and plot that is bright and this term is<br>the Kamai the constant command<br>translation of Pasada interesting so<br>whereas uh command uses the long word<br>somebody for some Vega for Posada it<br>doesn't very rarely use actually says<br>almost always uses<br>to describe that so really describing<br>the sense of again<br>the way a clear pool of water is clear<br>to the bottom and has been cleared away<br>of anything that would get in the way of<br>being able to see to the bottom and Pla<br>in the sense of being uh shining with<br>with light that's the the sense of of<br>these terms so combined together of<br>anything else you notice<br>Stay Stay Ananda where where is giving<br>us to stay by his side stay in the sense<br>of uh<br>hold yourself together<br>stanza is this now<br>so I that the talk doesn't realized one<br>um<br>the five Aggregates belonging to me will<br>be extinguished<br>no job uh nah I know that's the sense of<br>stay stay another so known just means<br>remain and job makes it imperative and<br>na is an emphatic<br>stay uh be<br>saying don't grieve don't lose yourself<br>in this<br>um<br>to contemplate<br>um<br>within your own anger within your own<br>Prana within your own body that's the<br>but it's not a common phrase in my mojo<br>to me it's really striking that it comes<br>out here because it's it's provoking<br>this sense of you know Ananda is the one<br>who's at this time has not yet achieved<br>our Hot Chip among the Buddhist close<br>disciples so he's very much shaken by<br>the Buddha's passing away<br>um and the Buddha is in a sense trying<br>to talk sense into him<br>at least that's how I read what's<br>happening<br>and by extension<br>everyone listening to this at the<br>funeral is you know called upon to<br>so let's uh take a look at another text<br>in the same vein<br>the Buddha is passing away<br>this has a a different Melody<br>um<br>I'll do it nice you get a sense of it<br>while you get a chance to read it here<br>thank you<br>so after describing the Buddha's funeral<br>we get this scene with an on on another<br>again meanwhile his attendant Ananda was<br>out for alms men and women from the town<br>bowed low before him<br>and asked venerable Ananda the worthy<br>one our great Lord has not been seen<br>night or day where is the Lord with the<br>god<br>we're used to seeing you always walking<br>in his steps today we've lost Mars full<br>our teacher is disappeared Ananda<br>couldn't bear their grief hearing them<br>ask for the Lord they'd never see again<br>he covered his face with his palms the<br>all-wise one won't arrive since he's<br>entered Nirvana we've lost our Lord<br>Master that's why you see me alone such<br>as our miserable fate bereft of our<br>beloved Prince from this day until<br>this is a scene that doesn't actually<br>appear in the canonical<br>but it does appear in the in the<br>commentary<br>that's where the quiet tradition is is<br>finding this scene and putting it into a<br>when they're describing the day that the<br>funeral happened<br>um<br>I have two questions yeah one is like<br>what is the evidence for that day<br>existing and two<br>I almost complementary to that is is<br>there a like symbolic resonance and and<br>how they're described in the day and<br>what is what is their description convey<br>as part of the poem<br>Faith that's being given here is<br>problematic in the sense that<br>there's a there's a 10-year calendar and<br>um<br>and<br>there's<br>the particular date date that's given<br>here is one that's not possible that<br>wouldn't make sense within that the<br>calendrical system so something happened<br>in the transmission of the text<br>that that's not correct here<br>um and with even within the terravada<br>tradition there are different<br>understandings of what the year<br>including the animal year or the that's<br>this 12-year cycle and also the<br>decimal year this is this 10-year cycle<br>how that should work out and how that<br>should be calculated to arrive at<br>particular moments in this Buddhist life<br>that Reckoning within the teravada<br>tradition is in disagreement with other<br>Buddhist traditions and in disagreement<br>with uh different camps of modern<br>Scholars who all also have different<br>ideas about when the particular life and<br>death dates so this is a been in kind of<br>Unsolved problem for a very long time<br>and and Buddhist traditions<br>um today there's a quite close consensus<br>about you know when the around the year<br>uh that the<br>um birth Enlightenment and our Nevada<br>was in the terravada tradition that's<br>not exactly what's described here except<br>that the 15th waxing day of the month of<br>visakha that that still is understood<br>um<br>as uh as a key date and that's that's<br>the most important part of for the<br>context of what's given here because<br>this this chant in addition to being<br>performed uh for funerals is often one<br>that's performed during uh what's known<br>as visacobojia or VISA visaka Puja or<br>what today is internationally known as<br>Facebook<br>the the holiday of the the most the most<br>important taravada put a stay within the<br>calendar that corresponds to the date of<br>uh birth Enlightenment and<br>uh passing away of the<br>all supposedly took place on the same<br>lunar date of the full moon day of the I<br>think visakas the it usually Falls in<br>May I think that means it's the sixth<br>lunar month they're different ways of<br>counting the lunar months but that's<br>approximately when it happens<br>um so by evoking the scene in this way<br>it's also connecting to what the<br>audience knows about oh this day is<br>important even if it wasn't being<br>performed on vasak people know that oh<br>this is something I know about the<br>Buddha's uh passing away it's something<br>that takes place at that particular<br>moment it's also something that was<br>described as taking place at a<br>um I hope did that get it your question<br>you should uh yeah I was also wondering<br>about like whether where it's subscribed<br>has some sort of like symbolic meaning<br>that has been to like add to the like<br>pump there are<br>many different descriptions for what's<br>happening with the this particular day<br>this is not a particularly elaborate one<br>other texts have much more elaborate<br>descriptions there's there's in fact a<br>whole<br>um branch of Cambodian funeral music<br>usually instrumental known as gomsko or<br>this form of music<br>According to some oral Traditions about<br>it is meant to evoke this sound of this<br>very scene<br>so the Buddha being passing away laying<br>down between two Saul trees<br>and then having these blossoms raining<br>down having storms and wind happening in<br>the background this is meant to be<br>evoked by the instruments of a certain<br>kind of music that's used in a funeral<br>uh<br>context in Cambodia so by again by<br>evoking that scene it invokes this Sonic<br>Dimension as well I'm not sure there's<br>something truly<br>I would label symbolic per se but if<br>there's these different kinds of<br>anything else about this text before we<br>move on<br>okay so just wanted to give you some<br>examples of how this idea of some Vega<br>or<br>stirring shows up in a context of poems<br>about the Buddha's life let's now look<br>at some texts that are really about end<br>of life practices in a in a Cambodian<br>context<br>um<br>it seems almost like<br>um he<br>yeah from the sale until forever we only<br>would suffering it's almost like uh he<br>feels like it's like chances gone or<br>like with the passing words for the it's<br>like there's some something in finishing<br>I think on them at least the narrative<br>Traditions around this particular Moment<br>In The Life narrative Buddha are trying<br>to depict a little bit the hopelessness<br>of Ananda that's very true Ananda is<br>totally grief stricken in the different<br>sources so<br>whether that's connected historically<br>but that's certainly the way the<br>tradition depicts what's going on at<br>this moment I think there's also a sense<br>that that a lot of Cambodian attacks are<br>invested in which is describing the<br>temporal and Geographic distance and<br>remove from Buddhists today in Cambodia<br>to the time and place<br>so face obvious of course a day of on<br>the one hand of celebration because it's<br>it's auspicious these are key moments in<br>the Buddha's life the Buddha was born<br>awakened but it's also this<br>the day of the Buddha is passing away<br>um it's also a reminder that uh<br>what remains after the lifetime of the<br>Buddha from different Buddhist<br>perspectives is different than what was<br>present during the lifetime<br>and so it's a reminder of that kind of<br>long-term<br>historical<br>so let's uh let's take a look at a<br>different uh set of texts and these are<br>this is about a particular kind of<br>funeral music not the one I just<br>mentioned<br>this is one called<br>um<br>usually it's called<br>Cronkite<br>sometimes it's called<br>different ways of referring to it but<br>the main one that's used along kayak is<br>interesting uh it's it's a it's based on<br>the Thai word uh<br>meaning the in a sense the South Asian<br>realm is the sense of it because the<br>long drum that's used it's one that was<br>at some point borrowed from in an Indian<br>or a middle eastern context<br>and uh this uh particular form of Music<br>we hear<br>um<br>can play it for you that will<br>um<br>okay<br>foreign<br>foreign<br>foreign<br>foreign<br>what do you see about the connection<br>between<br>at music and this poem that's<br>that's a repetition of the first one<br>over and over again which we haven't<br>really seen before yes<br>yes<br>and part of this this is a modern poem<br>composed by the<br>um<br>uh to he passed away not too long ago uh<br>by a my Buddhist scholar Lisa B<br>wrote in 91 I think<br>I believe in the in the context of the<br>but something we don't see so much in<br>traditional Cambodian poetry but we do<br>see in more modern forms are these kind<br>foreign<br>um<br>resting one's head on the pillow of the<br>truths<br>free from Pain free from suffering<br>early<br>gaining peace and Bliss<br>the color of Truth yeah it's a very<br>striking image I've never seen it<br>elsewhere the only thing you know the<br>yeah that's the only other context I<br>think of girls being appearing in songs<br>because that also appears in wedding<br>songs yeah<br>it's going for pillow again I'm sorry no<br>Canali right here right yeah and so<br>Canali comes from the verbal root Gali<br>Galley means to rest one's head on<br>something so Canali is that upon which<br>one response had IE pillow<br>um<br>so returning to<br>anything else you notice about does the<br>music seem to evoke what's going on here<br>yeah it's important<br>um<br>like mimics the vocal qualities of the<br>other songs like in the way that<br>instruments are used yes yes so this<br>kind of slide this is a quadruple read<br>woodwind instrument<br>um like other quadruple reads in the<br>Cambodian context it's always played<br>with circular breathing so that's why<br>the sound was unbroken from beginning to<br>end<br>um one fills air into one's cheeks and<br>then is able to<br>push air out with the cheeks and breathe<br>in quickly through the nose so that you<br>I I kind of feel like it's like the<br>music the same kind of music in a very<br>glorified celebrated way I I don't know<br>I just<br>um<br>Trump thing<br>yeah<br>yes so I think that's really the Queen's<br>question here is the rhythm of the drum<br>usually at this pace so this is a drum<br>that could be used in other kinds of<br>settings uh two<br>um uh and<br>in those settings it would have a much<br>more active Rhythm yeah here we have<br>this very spare rhythm in other words<br>the drama is not being hit very often at<br>all the other form of funeral music that<br>I mentioned<br>the drum is um hit in a very irregular<br>way that's said to evoke and permanence<br>here it's it's regular ultimately but<br>it's there feels like there's this kind<br>of disjointed relationship between the<br>melody of this oboe and the rhythm of<br>the drum it's not in this kind of close<br>relationship there's this spaciousness<br>which I think is one of the sort of the<br>Geniuses of this<br>um kind of music how it works in that<br>context<br>um Alexander says I've been moved by the<br>sounds of the lyrics so far but I think<br>the sounds of the instruments have<br>caused me the most shock particularly in<br>the last piece yes yes whenever I the<br>first time I heard this and each time I<br>hear it again uh I'm really<br>um<br>I guess I just feel so impressed by the<br>the<br>intentional way it was crafted for this<br>kind of aesthetic effect<br>and freedom writes the strong and open<br>performance is very similar to The<br>Current Funeral dirge performed today<br>um and certainly there are many<br>parallels in in Thailand with regards to<br>uh these kinds of funeral dirges as well<br>and that's part of the reason why this<br>very term uh cronkai is is a<br>my pronunciation of the Thai word<br>um<br>it's<br>presumably a form that was borrowed many<br>of these forms have been circulating<br>between Cambodia and Thailand over the<br>century so that's why it has these Thai<br>names associated with it as well as well<br>what's known in kamaya's clong China is<br>related to that chanat is a Thai word<br>which for victory because this is a drum<br>associated with<br>um<br>uh military use in the past that has<br>been sort of re-appropriated into this<br>so let's move on to some other texts in<br>this genre this is the one we were we<br>were just looking at this is just I've<br>it's the one that began with Anita<br>asankar so sorry can I just yeah I'm<br>just let me pause it because it just<br>circle back to something you said in the<br>first lecture was about what<br>distinguishes<br>poetry from other forms and it just<br>there's something about evocation here<br>that is kind of unique I'm just you know<br>it's not<br>um<br>my friends fluctuating a little bit but<br>it's not it's not sort of systematic<br>thought it's not narrative thought it's<br>it's a it's a it's a kind of<br>um<br>whatever total aesthetic experience of<br>which<br>that also includes you know in which<br>music is invited and which that in which<br>evocation seems to be one of the aims as<br>a you know as opposed to instruction<br>absolutely absolutely and you you could<br>you could treat even a sort of I suppose<br>it's it's a classification based on how<br>you treat the word you know the the text<br>or the the thing you listen to it<br>whatever so that to the extent that you<br>treat its goal as evocation you're<br>treating it as poetry I don't know I'm<br>just throwing that out the role of<br>instruction of and didactic poetry<br>within the Southeast Asian context more<br>broadly in the Cambodian context in<br>particular is very strong however and as<br>we look through a few more of these<br>texts we'll see that what may begin with<br>this evocation of some Lega that's on<br>the surface what's going on the end<br>often ends up in a very didactic place<br>in other words does this mean that the<br>instruction is best received when the<br>audience has been brought into a<br>particular regular aesthetic or<br>emotional place that seems to be how the<br>texts are structured so we look at this<br>example it begins with this evocation as<br>it were of this scene of death and the<br>particular scene of death here is one<br>that we see in a lot of Cambodian<br>attacks also in Thai tax from the 18th<br>and 19th century<br>whereas today we understand cremation to<br>be the norm for the post-mortem<br>treatment of the body in a funerary<br>context there are certain conditions out<br>in Cambodia for instance where bodies<br>may be<br>buried in a shallow grave for some time<br>you've been up to a period of several<br>years before being executed<br>uh and then uh cremated often in a mass<br>cremation ceremony that happens as well<br>what's being described here though is<br>more the<br>the disposal of bodies in the forest uh<br>this is of course tied to certain<br>meditation traditions of this period and<br>the contemplation of corpses disposing<br>but it also uh seems to be outside of<br>elite circles where cremation would have<br>done the norm an important dimension of<br>funeral practice this time so that's why<br>it says discarded deep in the forest<br>with nunted trust as your own save wild<br>beasts who run and groan you'll be alone<br>through and through your wealth For<br>Worse poverty you can't take anything<br>with you you'll lie there something you<br>do your body truly worthless all Merit<br>gone and you're awake your kin will take<br>your karthus to Woodlands cloaked and<br>darkness they'll leave tearless there<br>you'll stay<br>the dead must be abandoned their bones<br>and flesh thrown away their bodies bound<br>to Decay your name they say<br>they soon unsaid<br>reflect on this and be stirred stirred<br>here is this word sampaga have this<br>experience of some Vegas says the text<br>after having evoked it ill have it don't<br>be deterred but instead take refuge in<br>what's well said hear this and tread the<br>right course here we then transition to<br>the didactic portion give gives keep<br>rules train your heart that is perform<br>the three key practices of laypeople uh<br>um<br>generosity<br>morality and<br>cultivation three ways to start from the<br>source to wipe your brow of remorse<br>don't do what's coarse thus I preach<br>build your Merit hard your mind always<br>be kind strive to reach all those in<br>need make your speech those who teach<br>so just trying to bring out this example<br>of how the is evoking something then<br>transitions in this key stance I reflect<br>are there other Rhymes that I'm missing<br>oh so this whole thing is structured<br>along the the rhyme um scheme of the uh<br>probably the seven syllable meter this<br>is a group of Cambodian meters that are<br>related to the Quran meters and Thai and<br>they feature<br>um<br>there's all kinds of optional internal<br>Rhymes<br>um but the external Rhymes that is<br>Rhymes that are connected to ends of<br>lines are very important so just to look<br>at the English for a moment so in each<br>stanza the last syllable the first line<br>rhymes with the fourth of the second the<br>last of the second uh and the last of<br>the Third<br>both of those rhyme with the fourth of<br>the fourth and then the last of the<br>fourth rhymes with the second of the the<br>last uh syllable the second and third<br>line and fourth syllable of the last<br>line of the following stances all the<br>stances are linked together<br>um so uh I don't do the rights perfectly<br>but reflect on this and be stirred don't<br>be deterred but instead take refuge in<br>what's well said hear this in tread the<br>right course and that course will rhyme<br>with Source remorse course and this<br>preach will rhyme with reach speech<br>teach Etc<br>okay<br>there's Gwen's got a question there oh<br>yes please are there moments in certain<br>Cambodian songs where some leg and<br>Posada might happen at the same time or<br>does one always come first the other at<br>the end so just to be clear in terms of<br>how I'm understanding what's going on<br>I'm not sure if some if basada is even<br>really being evoked in this text<br>um I think we see that more in a much<br>more devotional context<br>um so it's shifting into this didactic<br>realm but I'm not sure if Posada is<br>being a vocal maybe a little bit there's<br>that sense of it but it's not it's not<br>as strong as we might see in other<br>contacts but yes I think we see a little<br>bit of this here<br>um and a little bit later we see the two<br>sequentially and it's often sequential<br>in the course of a ritual so there may<br>be for instance in the context to put an<br>image consecration there are a set of<br>three very long chants in Kamai that are<br>performed each two or three hours long<br>it takes all night and the ones that are<br>more some Lego evoking come first during<br>the night and the ones by the time the<br>sun rises are more Posada oriented but I<br>think your question<br>I mean there's one I hadn't thought<br>about before uh are there moments in<br>which both are might be evoked at the<br>same time this is sort of along the<br>lines of what Anushka you mentioned<br>before it's like it's sad<br>and it's it's stirring and yet there's<br>something joyful because there's a<br>Melody because it's it has this kind of<br>aesthetic Beauty I think the same thing<br>uh that you yourself raised Gwen where<br>and uh uh for instance listening when I<br>listen to kayak this kind of Vietnamese<br>folk poetry recitation<br>um there's a ways even if it's funny<br>even if there's something joyful about<br>it there's something that's plaintiff<br>that sounds mournful there's a taste of<br>that there as well and I think<br>um there's something to understand and<br>unpack about how our tastes and<br>understanding of what gets mapped onto<br>certain emotions have changed in many<br>different cultures across time<br>um and I think there's also something to<br>explore more in your your question<br>around you know maybe there are moments<br>let's as we look at a few other pieces<br>let's see if that because you know just<br>as a just to maybe<br>take that question a little bit further<br>you need to say in the example of the<br>mahaval so that you're talking about<br>where you see Posada and some Vega I<br>mean they're the two are like and it<br>appears the end of all the chapters<br>it's not as though they're opposed in<br>that it's you know it's it's it's it's<br>almost like as though they're both kind<br>of evocation you know like that the<br>reader should get that from the mahabala<br>asada and some Vega that it's for the<br>Posada and some Vega and Posada comes<br>first from memory in in<br>so thank you guys so<br>um<br>I mean is there a way it just basically<br>kind of ripping a little bit on what you<br>said about the the way in which emotion<br>you know we're understanding we're sort<br>of mapping<br>some Vega as a kind of a slightly<br>negative depressing emotion and Posada<br>is this like uplifting joyful emotion<br>which is what you just said but I mean<br>it's entirely possible it seems to me if<br>we take the Maha bomb so that<br>they weren't seen as opposed that they<br>want one wasn't necessarily yeah sort of<br>you know coded positive and one negative<br>in quite the way we're making it out<br>right now<br>I don't know<br>um I just am also Eric just commented on<br>there isn't the promise and refuge of<br>Dharma<br>evoked by the by the didactic turn at<br>the end of the poem evocative of the<br>Serene confidence of Posada yes yes yes<br>and I think that's again what we and you<br>were getting to as well<br>um I guess they've been very literal in<br>reading this and only thinking where the<br>text explicitly says you know things<br>that are associated with with Posada or<br>uses terms like<br>et cetera that I think of it in those<br>terms but yeah for sure okay yeah<br>there's the there's the mahabomba<br>um yes<br>so absolutely it's um<br>facade this comes first in the combat<br>so that's very interesting to think<br>about<br>um<br>yeah<br>I never really thought about that like<br>this<br>so<br>um in the places to<br>that are give rise to their to give rise<br>to Posada<br>and the same in those that are to give<br>rise to some Vega in other words here<br>it's saying that they're separate that's<br>right yeah that's the way the mahamas is<br>framing it they're separate<br>um that's right so let's<br>but it's putting them in a different<br>order so many of the other Traditions<br>try to put this sequence to things where<br>somewega is coming first and Passat is<br>coming later but it's interesting that<br>this has a different order but still<br>considers them separate in a certain way<br>so let's let's keep these questions in<br>mind as we uh move to<br>um<br>thank you<br>foreign<br>let's take a deep dive into this text<br>song for the hour of death this is one<br>of many<br>um<br>Cambodian homes that and we see<br>parallels to this in in Siamese and<br>London and Lao examples as well but<br>let's just focus on this particular<br>example at the moment<br>um that are designed to<br>uh evoke the horrors of the process of<br>dying and what happens after death and<br>lots of connecting that to the practice<br>of certain practices of meditation so we<br>have a very interesting Arc that we'll<br>go through in this text<br>um so I thought we could explore it in a<br>little bit more depth usually in terms<br>of genre these are given the generic<br>title of uh meaning the<br>of all these uh three marks that's the<br>marks of impermanence suffering and not<br>self<br>um<br>but there are many many songs that have<br>that same uh title sometimes they're<br>also given the generic title of Thomas<br>that which arouses a sense of stirring<br>with regards to the teachings so both of<br>these kind of generic titles uh appear<br>for this kind of text so this this the<br>title I've given here a song for the<br>hour of death is not actually one that<br>appears in the tradition it's just I'm<br>trying to giving it um something that<br>describes more specifically what's going<br>on<br>so it begins with this evocation of pain<br>of the sheer pain of coming to the end<br>of life<br>and seizes squeezes and makes you sick<br>with fevers that wreck you from within<br>from Life Death from death to the void<br>your body knows but constant change<br>short-lived bound to Decay on slight no<br>and in that it tries to capture what's<br>happening in this process of Aging your<br>voice sang clear but now it's hoarse<br>your eyes once range both far and near<br>but now they've changed and all grows<br>dim your hair once gleamed black and oil<br>but now it's dull and gray is Ash wiped<br>the tips like River grass bugs your<br>teeth one snugly meshed together mashing<br>your food without a hitch now you're<br>going to swell your teeth shake they<br>slip from the roots and fall from your<br>mouth whatever you eat you can't bite it<br>through you Chomp down and swallow<br>fearing hunger your ears grow death your<br>Supple skin when it's tightly wrapped<br>around your flesh goes slack and droops<br>my beauty remains your body's Parts<br>aren't really you and here it's<br>transitioning to thinking about this<br>idea<br>or not self you can't even call them<br>your own<br>and we begin this very interesting<br>conversation<br>to love them is useless what refuge are<br>they you coax your hair stay as you are<br>don't go gray but your hair won't listen<br>you woo your teeth stay as you are don't<br>fall out your teeth won't listen you<br>bleed with your ears be kind to me don't<br>go death yours won't listen you beg your<br>eyes sweeping and wailing tweeting the<br>gods to offer Their Blessings dear eyes<br>have mercy<br>stay as you are don't go dark<br>but your eyes won't listen<br>then we have this graphic description of<br>how death is being imagined itself<br>death this is here being understood as<br>King Yama yeah<br>and<br>sometimes known as<br>other kinds of uh phrases that describe<br>these figures but those who are guy<br>either the Servants of Yama who are<br>usually in teravada context understood<br>as real living beings but who are either<br>Guardians of the hells who are managing<br>this this process of rebirth deaths are<br>foe rallies his troops to storm in<br>swiftly and Seize Your Body the grasp<br>your head hands and feet and down your<br>waist and never let go they grip your<br>chest squeeze your heart pinching the 32<br>vessels within they knock you down and<br>tie you up plunging you forward<br>pulling you forward pushing from behind<br>tugging and tossing you left and right<br>crumpled and pummeled you Wither in Pain<br>by ugly crushed by anguish be tormented<br>tortured relentlessly your chest<br>contracts and blazes red hot thick<br>phlegm creeps up crowding your throat<br>the body's four elements<br>same elements we were looking at in the<br>other context of Earth<br>water Wind and Fire<br>slink away but your mouth sticks open<br>gasping for air your nose will clogged<br>your last Tears Dry what a struggle to<br>breathe the wind element Slips Away<br>tying your vessels and Knots your eyes<br>roll back as you shiver and shake and<br>Quake inside pursued to death<br>good<br>is that is that pun or not pun but is<br>that uh<br>repetition and uh<br>uh no it uses<br>um either I can't remember now whether<br>it's Yama or yama's Guardian so that's<br>the the thing is<br>and then we get this description of what<br>happens after death so what has to<br>imagine the context of this whole poem<br>is reciting for someone who is sick<br>um<br>this wouldn't ordinarily be recited in a<br>funeral but rather for someone who was<br>who was alive or those who are caring<br>for someone who's alive but who who is<br>dying and they're given this preview of<br>what what death is like you're snot once<br>yellow turns black and sticky your body<br>Stone grows noxious and foul strangers<br>haul your corpse to the woods throwing<br>is the you is the second person<br>pronoun that that is it that it's in<br>most cases it's not necessary to State a<br>pronoun yeah in these particular my<br>sentences right<br>um so uh<br>there it's not clear in the verbal form<br>or whatever it's in the verbal form it's<br>that verbs don't conjugate in Kumai um<br>right so<br>it's it's really ambiguous so this is<br>okay I think there are places where it's<br>clear that this is really this it's<br>calling out in a second person<br>addressing you listen this is what's<br>happening with you<br>um but it doesn't re in English I have<br>to repeat you much more than yeah<br>I sort of interrupted it's very Struck<br>it like it's freaking me out a little<br>bit yeah<br>sorry but it is it is only the theme the<br>we'll go into something more pleasant uh<br>tomorrow but<br>um in the Toronto grounds your body's<br>forlorn Gibbons civets and flying<br>squirrels hounded by Wolves tolls and<br>wild dogs<br>um and this is evoking this sense of the<br>forest is a place of danger of great<br>Danger<br>completely different than the world of<br>uh lowland rice cultivation the forest<br>is outside of the scope of civilization<br>oh don't oh it's a doll they're actually<br>quite cute from a picture on the other<br>subjects<br>do you know that<br>yeah<br>I buy modules Osprey and circling Hawks<br>whose Hoots and squeaks shrieks ReSound<br>in the woods and of course owls and<br>these other kinds of birds being evoked<br>here are ones that are often framed as<br>scary and associated with ghosts within<br>a Mainland Southeast Asian context<br>hemmed in by crows and circled by<br>cultures who summon a flock to join<br>their feast of Gore so in all these<br>beasts Russian to Peck and hack gnawing<br>and tearing their corpse to shreds they<br>mob on mass as your last Entourage<br>let me just skip this it gets really<br>gory this is um going to go into the<br>decomposition of the corpse so that's<br>what that's what happens next<br>um where the worms burble Within<br>uh let me just skip it uh with with your<br>permission<br>um then we we move into this reflection<br>on back to this world of the living<br>person<br>you can't control this body for it's not<br>yours reflect on this carefully ponder<br>it well see the path before you don't be<br>careless and this is a part that's very<br>interesting from a gendered perspective<br>usually the way that this these texts<br>are framed is with a male<br>um<br>point of view in mind<br>as far as I can understand what happens<br>in the next passage uh it's with a a<br>woman's perspective in mind<br>you bathe yourself put on a lace hem<br>skirt an embroidered silk blouse a<br>blended scarf smiling and thinking<br>you're not too bad you trim your hair<br>massage it with oil and shave the sides<br>so you can show off and in 18th and 19th<br>century in Cambodia this was<br>particularly Elite women's fashion but I<br>think it also uh would have extended to<br>other people in society that hair would<br>be left on top of the head but shaved<br>off as a kind of<br>what's the I forget what this is called<br>and<br>adorned with gold and gleaming with<br>jewels you walk with Grace swinging your<br>arms you never stop preening but this<br>body is loathsome it's fake disgusting<br>certain to Decay take a moment to think<br>in order to think it over<br>then we get the rest of the text that<br>goes into this framework around uh<br>certain practices of meditation<br>um I think this is where we can also ask<br>this question of is there this you know<br>maybe the some Lego passata framework<br>isn't totally germane to what's going on<br>here there will be limits to that<br>framework we might want to think about<br>other things or even this framework of<br>evocation and instruction uh are these<br>blending together in some way too how<br>you know maybe there's something else<br>that you can you all can see in this<br>text that will will help us understand<br>it but I think it's uh useful<br>um for us to just<br>um go go through it we won't do every<br>bit but just give you a flavor of what<br>remains<br>so one is being asked then to reflect on<br>the fragile body<br>and then to not think of<br>normal thoughts of attainment don't<br>think of the pleasures of men and women<br>gold and silver horses and elephants<br>Buffalo and cattle are rising in rank<br>these are all would have been signs of<br>status and pleasure at that time these<br>thoughts are futile such attachments<br>bind your neck waist and ankles your<br>whole body Shackled like a Thrice bound<br>corpse and here it's a direct connection<br>to Cambodian funerary practices I don't<br>know actually if this is done in allow<br>or tie context or other places in the<br>terravada world in Sri Lanka et cetera<br>but corpses are traditionally tied three<br>times with a cord around the neck or<br>head different contacts chords around<br>the um uh<br>the ways sometimes connected to the<br>wrist and then with the ankles as well<br>um and so sometimes those are described<br>as different kinds of attachment<br>attachment to spouse attachment to<br>Children attachment to wealth as being<br>the things that bind uh people at<br>death<br>rare are those who can loosen these<br>courts that's the text to succeed and<br>reach complete Freedom you must study<br>the 45 subjects the Masters selected for<br>meditation now I don't know what the 45<br>subjects are<br>for instance 40 is the number of<br>subjects so what is meant by the 45<br>subjects is<br>um for a specialists in meditation texts<br>like to to figure out<br>um clear your mind and concentrate well<br>on the Lucid guidance of your teachers<br>filled with pity the admonish you to<br>Vanquish the evil trapped within and<br>abandoned all five of the obstacles<br>these are these new I don't know these<br>obstacles that are brought up in a<br>meditation context quick cast them off<br>don't let them get near you might get<br>stuck and fail to progress having gained<br>the hard run jewels of virtue and this<br>is a connection to this idea of the<br>uh these<br>context the the jewels that are or the<br>glowing spheres or glowing orbs that are<br>tied to esoteric meditation practices<br>that involve the visualization and<br>manipulation of these kinds of uh orbs<br>within the body<br>so having gained them in other words<br>having succeeded in this kind of<br>meditation practice hold them tight<br>don't uh keep them safe and secure don't<br>be a fool and forsake the manual<br>um that guided you this far<br>uh don't let your mind wander don't hold<br>grudges don't be Sly so we're getting<br>into this very didactic section the<br>sages of old learned upheld and vowed to<br>realize the truth of the Buddha's<br>teachings completely detract they<br>accrued good deeds and strove to cast<br>off numberless evils they rooted the<br>tarma in their bodies aiming to one day<br>reach its highest fruits that of our<br>buddhahood<br>Etc all doubts they severed all sins<br>they ceased Fletchers of the mind they<br>drew the resolve their aim was sure to<br>complete their practice and find real<br>Bliss before life's window shuts<br>and here we have again another metaphor<br>to describe attainment of these kinds of<br>uh jeweled orbs<br>um and the way to guard them in life so<br>this is again an end of life kind of<br>text but it's perhaps designed for a lay<br>man or a lay woman given the different<br>resonances we hear who has practiced<br>certain forms of esoteric meditation<br>earlier in their life and now that<br>they're coming to the end of their life<br>they're asked to recall that practice<br>and uh bring it up at this most<br>propitious moment should you succeed in<br>meditation you're certain to win a<br>Divine prize to attain the heavens once<br>you've mastered the true practice keep<br>it fixed and firm within your being<br>suppose you had a horde of Gold Gems all<br>scrolled away in a secret cache if<br>you're able to protect it well the<br>treasure would keep you secure for life<br>but if you were to relax your guard and<br>spend a little here a little there soon<br>your vast riches would be scattered and<br>you'd be ruined worse than before this<br>is just like one who wins the Dharma and<br>gains freedom<br>can't live up to it resting on success<br>he loses his Zeal and here I've inserted<br>the pronoun<br>um<br>maybe if I was translating again I might<br>have just put they throughout all of<br>this but the the client is not specify<br>the gender of uh this particular student<br>resting on success he loses his you know<br>I'm stirred by urgency he fails to<br>strive and keep up all the progress he's<br>made he assumes that now he's a Master<br>with vengeful Karma this idea of um<br>thank God I'm Joiner<br>uh Gambia my contacts all melted away<br>that is no<br>possible negative consequences to the<br>right unexpectedly arrive in the future<br>he can just be careless uh with his body<br>and not bothered to think things through<br>one can never cheat the price of Bob or<br>sin in this context don't doubt this for<br>Evil Fast accumulates when you fail to<br>hold yourself upright when you take up<br>the Dharma be careful<br>study the mind keep it pure stick to<br>truth deepen your tolerance and<br>compassion find the path of kindness<br>from within take care of yourself Be<br>steady settled follow your teachers<br>don't mess around<br>then we have this next paragraph I won't<br>go into it but it's really connected to<br>this broader genre in my literature of<br>these didactic poems<br>uh poems for the admonishment or the<br>training of oneself that could be used<br>in simply the moral training of young<br>people or those preparing for a<br>particular government positions Etc this<br>kind of ethical literature is<br>foundational within the Cambodian<br>literary context<br>um there's some similar genres in the<br>central Thai Arena<br>but they're not as Central within that<br>literary tradition as we see in the<br>Cambodian context but a very clear sort<br>of uh didactic basis for how is one<br>supposed to behave<br>um and some of this could be some things<br>that one could use at this end of life<br>context some of it seems to be extending<br>beyond that because other people would<br>be listening to this as well<br>um and then it ends with this anisansa<br>like if you were able to do all this<br>that's a very very long list of things<br>you'll have nothing to fear study these<br>teachers with Care at a pure intention<br>that idea of intention being Central you<br>need that doubt should you aspire to<br>reach the heavens soaring above and<br>distant Brahma Realms or even return<br>back here in human form your hopes and<br>prayers shall be fulfilled<br>and then a short summary of what this<br>was all about at last is this position<br>is complete<br>facts that haunt our lives are plain<br>constant change ceaseless pain nothing<br>to call our own again<br>now these wise words are said<br>so I can start now go go meditate right<br>now<br>Alexander's got something there I am<br>wondering if there is a tendency for<br>Buddhist Doctrine to subvert tropes that<br>are typically associated with hardship<br>to instead represent auspicious<br>occurrences<br>um<br>very interesting the one I'm thinking of<br>in particular is earthquakes and its<br>employment in the Lotus who tried to<br>signify the shattering of Illusion<br>ignorance Etc<br>um and if we go back to<br>uh that we looked at on the uh maybe<br>even the first day uh no the second day<br>uh we were thinking about prayer uh we<br>saw that an earth uh earthquakes<br>appeared as well at that moment this is<br>after the king ordains the whole lore<br>around that is the earth quaked in all<br>directions<br>we see images of earthquakes rainbows<br>all kinds of other atmospheric phenomena<br>being tied to particularly auspicious<br>moments but particularly ones that are<br>somehow<br>consequential like the ordination of a<br>particular figure or the passing away of<br>a particular religious figure this is<br>very common in a Buddhist context<br>um but I think that the general thrust<br>of your question might be getting at<br>something else and I I haven't thought<br>about that before about sort of uh uh<br>things associated with hardship<br>um being reframed as uh auspicious<br>occurrences<br>the perfect example right and this is<br>all<br>you're sort of you're sort of the horror<br>at the story of esanta is<br>you're called upon to sort of hold it in<br>abeyance in a way or at least at the the<br>didactic level of the story I don't know<br>if the at the performance level maybe<br>not but<br>um I I had a similar kind of reaction to<br>Alexander Alexander<br>um<br>but of course you know the some Vega<br>style is is precisely the polar opposite<br>right is to reconsider everything good<br>is bad so it's it but I I I would agree<br>with that my experience of<br>verse and The Limited verse I know in<br>the context I'm always from us is like<br>Alexander's and that yeah that is good<br>bad is good yeah<br>to leave it behind him but it's much<br>more Posada you know much more Posada<br>what would you say like<br>have you<br>we see a lot of have you experienced a<br>lot that's like some Vega evoking<br>I think that uh earlier versions of<br>Buddhism it's kind of like suffering and<br>somewhere and fear no when it's like in<br>in my groups I'm studying like when<br>they're more into conventional practices<br>then they will be like some veg and<br>ghosts and other Realms and fear<br>all these things but in more modern<br>sense it will be pressure and how you<br>should enjoy life and moments and it's<br>like because you know things so then you<br>should be happy it's that kind of a<br>thing so it's like the perspective I<br>guess<br>that's I don't know maybe it makes the<br>series absolutely absolutely yeah yeah I<br>think we see those those kinds of<br>patterns all across uh the Buddhist<br>worlds<br>20th century 21st century very very<br>common to see that kind of transition<br>taking place and let's let's keep that<br>in mind for tomorrow when we think about<br>pleasure and Buddhist poetry and do<br>those ideas around pleasure that you're<br>seeing in some of the groups you study<br>um do does that show up in any of the<br>Poetry we'll look at so it's a<br>supernatural in the ghost is that to<br>give you some<br>kind of fear I think it's just like you<br>will go and end up in those Realms yeah<br>I mean that's like those hell<br>murals of those Health statues they're<br>supposed to shake you up I know you have<br>sort of didactic<br>descriptive like about how worms are<br>coming out of yeah I mean how light is<br>only there in your body and it feels<br>sterilized in your face go dark and<br>people can't see your face but your body<br>um guian's got a comment great<br>uh in the rituals that last the entire<br>night is exhaustion<br>part of the<br>that goes through the participants in<br>the end definitely<br>yes yes<br>um or just the repeated shock flash<br>horror of these songs energize the body<br>somehow that's really interesting<br>um<br>so that's that ecstatic shamatic thing<br>yeah yeah I think there's a bit of both<br>you said definitely the exhaustion is<br>part of it can you tell us more I mean I<br>just I I would I I mean I do believe<br>that<br>the again the total ritual experience or<br>whatever that in which this is<br>something like this would be performed<br>um the breaking down yeah yeah<br>yeah<br>the gamelon teacher says you do a shadow<br>puppet then you you can't pee the whole<br>30 minutes<br>yeah and these kinds of all night<br>rituals Gwen are less and less common in<br>Cambodia today because they don't<br>necessarily Accord with<br>contemporary schedules or relationships<br>to time uh in Cambodia<br>um I've certainly experienced them in a<br>in a public way in a vaseoc context in<br>Cambodia but the last time I<br>stayed up all night at one of those<br>instead of half the night in 2016 and<br>but 2006 was the only time I remember<br>actually chatting with people until dawn<br>um<br>I think I I personally was exhausted<br>um but there is a kind of energy that<br>comes from<br>this this chanting<br>um<br>what I haven't experienced is the the an<br>all-night ritual for<br>a end of life kind of ceremony because<br>that tends to be something much more<br>private<br>um and I haven't done that kind of uh<br>in-depth field work around uh those<br>particular kinds of rights part of why<br>I've been hesitant to write<br>too much about this what's happening in<br>that context because I'm getting it<br>second hand from teachers who describe<br>it as well as books in the early part of<br>the 20th century that are describing in<br>detail how these vegetables take place<br>but they're again much less common today<br>um Eric you're asking in Principle as I<br>understand it a piercing realization of<br>any of the three marks of existence can<br>trigger feelings of some Vega but to<br>Southeast Asian Buddhist poems seeking<br>to evoke somebody like attentive<br>foreground or prioritize any of the<br>three marks of existence more than the<br>others I would say that it's<br>particularly the first two that get<br>emphasized what we saw in this last text<br>is quite interesting that it really has<br>extensive sections dealing with<br>that is unusual in the in the text that<br>I'm familiar with there's much more on<br>the impermanence of the body uh and<br>the foul the impure which I'm not<br>actually sure how to categorize into the<br>three marks<br>um in other words is the Decay<br>witnessing a body decay<br>which of those three marks does that<br>really fall under or imagining one<br>either dying in a painful way or being<br>after one has died once corpse being<br>abandoned in the forest is that<br>ultimately about any one of the three<br>marks more than any of the others I find<br>this you know challenging to figure out<br>hmm<br>probably on each other right all right<br>yeah<br>makes seems to me<br>and that's the one that has of course<br>entered most<br>um concretely into the vernacular<br>language<br>um<br>uh as something that you know we see in<br>all kinds of other poetry world with uh<br>uh Anita has this sense of glass or<br>foreign<br>and then you've written again Eric that<br>is my sense as well are there many cases<br>of poems evoking some Vega through<br>another and as I mentioned it's really<br>this text that we just looked at this<br>song for the hour of death<br>um that had particularly those passages<br>on uh you know you're coaxing your hair<br>stay as you are don't put your hair<br>won't listen this is sort of a a even in<br>canonical understandings of anata this<br>is part of the idea it's like one can be<br>sick but you can't control that sickness<br>of your body so therefore the body is<br>somehow not you uh or the same for<br>thinking about the other five Aggregates<br>Etc so that's one way in which um gets<br>foregrounded but it's it's rare<br>so would this be sung at a funeral<br>as far as I understand it this is for an<br>end of life so yeah<br>there's not a particular Cambodian word<br>for this ritual um but it's for someone<br>um so when there's someone who is very<br>trying to think of my phrase to describe<br>it<br>um<br>to someone who's of low energy which<br>means they're at the very Advanced state<br>of illness and and Tayo be something<br>like sword hi poop boy something<br>like for those who are at a very serious<br>stage of illness reciting the Dharma to<br>them but I don't think even in Thai<br>there's not a it's not a word to<br>describe this ceremony<br>and I don't see<br>the content product yourself often in<br>life<br>but when people are in the hospital when<br>they're hooked up to everything then<br>doesn't come and there's a candle<br>um<br>bit of the life in Thailand<br>um I mean in my understanding of the<br>manuscript tradition in the 18th and<br>19th centuries<br>so<br>um particularly leparello manuscripts<br>visual it will be easier to understand<br>um<br>sorry<br>put it in an endless scroll sorry this<br>is the book you're working on God sorry<br>just past the part I was trying to get<br>so<br>it's like you would like to actually pay<br>to bring the monk down to chat something<br>when somebody's in the hospital<br>yeah<br>that's ritual too but it's definitely<br>understand this there is no<br>um<br>fixed or<br>particular text to be used<br>in that circumstance so there's kind of<br>General but attacks that will be be used<br>yeah there's also some specific kind of<br>sort of index that would be used in a<br>Cambodian context so for instance the<br>um that<br>um<br>my computer is not cooperating but<br>um there are what I was going to show<br>you is that they're in 18th and 19th<br>century Thai manuscripts uh there are<br>illuminations that show these kinds of<br>practices taking place so they're often<br>sometimes connected to the problem<br>manuscripts but they're<br>in a slightly different genre because<br>they contain texts and contain ritual<br>instructions that are about chanting for<br>the end of life so this is how it's<br>depicted in a Cambodian context<br>I forgive so it's Vista Health here your<br>soul your Vinnie and my<br>and Mike yeah so that's one one one<br>dimension of it but the the key way the<br>texts themselves frame it is how does<br>one maintain uh toward the very last<br>moments of life to the final moment uh a<br>thought that's that is a that it's<br>centered on on something else that's<br>wholesome so one is maybe asked to<br>reflect on the merits that one is<br>performed in life and then the texts<br>around Cambodian end of life practices<br>uh tend to emphasize at the very end the<br>person should recite<br>or if they're not able to recite<br>themselves the uh delay efficient or the<br>monastic can recite<br>to them uh so it describes sort of this<br>sort of narrowing of practices as the<br>various faculties of the person uh begin<br>to slip away and the Cambodian practices<br>are specific about how to prepare the<br>room out of lay down the person where to<br>set up the altar how to clean other<br>things away and both monastics and lay<br>people might be chanting to them in this<br>kind of context and we see similar<br>depictions in a Thai context so this is<br>one example here's someone who's<br>depicted as ill in a Thai context<br>this is for us about Croc ritual but<br>there are other portions in this same<br>manuscript as manuscript from the<br>British library early 19th century<br>manuscript that depicts monastics<br>chanting for someone who is ill and the<br>kinds of texts that appear in that<br>context are the you know the ones we<br>mentioned around the kiriman and the et<br>cetera here's another example of the the<br>same kind of depiction<br>um and uh sometimes this text<br>is one that appears as well they're<br>being mentioned here<br>um<br>and but with this different kinds of<br>medicinal practices for someone who is<br>all being mentioned and we know that<br>these particular texts at this period in<br>Thailand where we cited melodically<br>because the red annotations you see here<br>these are indications of how melodically<br>to recite and this by the way is outside<br>of Vietnam this is the only form of<br>Mainland Southeast Asian<br>musical notation prior to the 20th<br>century and that occurs very rarely on<br>first maybe they just wore out<br>so thank you so much<br>it's true true<br>this is really pretty<br>yeah<br>today we just know that<br>says for afternoon to date like during<br>the the<br>ceremony funeral so we we can't wrap my<br>life yes<br>I haven't had haven't seen<br>their contemporary practices of reciting<br>yeah for<br>yeah yeah so it's very interesting the<br>same kind of pattern seems to have<br>happened in Cambodia<br>the manuscript tradition shows the end<br>of life practices and chants around them<br>were very important in the uh certainly<br>by the time the manuscript record really<br>picks up and in the 19th century being<br>in the 20th century and then that<br>declines as we move towards the present<br>with the increasing medicalization of<br>death<br>we see a very similar uh context in the<br>Thai uh the Thai world and for instance<br>like the work of Scott Stonington or<br>theolina Givens or another kind of<br>perspective on how care for the elderly<br>or care for for the dying is is changing<br>within this medicalization of death<br>and of course the medicalization of<br>death happened on a broader scale<br>earlier on in Thailand particularly in<br>urban areas than that sort of
