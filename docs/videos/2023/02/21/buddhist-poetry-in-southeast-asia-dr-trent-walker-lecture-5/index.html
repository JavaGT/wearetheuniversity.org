all<br>for attending and over to you Trent<br>thank you so much ben thank you all<br>again for being here those of you here<br>in the room and those of you uh joining<br>uh virtually really appreciate your your<br>presence and all the ways that you've<br>you've contributed to this week together<br>so<br>uh I again really want to make sure that<br>there's space for your questions your<br>Curiosities things you're wondering<br>about today this is any time including<br>right now is a good time to ask those<br>things<br>so<br>let me just give you a moment as I've<br>done before for you to just if you're<br>here in the room to jot down something<br>that you're you're still curious about<br>that you thought we would cover but we<br>didn't or that came up yesterday or that<br>you're hoping will come up today to<br>something you're you're wondering about<br>or thinking about and if you're joining<br>us virtually you can put that into the<br>chat if you'd like if you're here you<br>can just write it down or think about it<br>and then let me just give you a moment<br>yeah I have two questions oh already<br>okay please go ahead I read the poem<br>number 44 the amount unions yes and sum<br>up your essay about the consecration of<br>Buddha image yes and my questions the<br>first first question is from the poem<br>to come to be<br>to come to the new icon yes including<br>the Buddha 10 Perfections yes the power<br>of the Buddha of the past of the future<br>right uh I don't have problem with the<br>Perfections up on the Buddhas in the<br>past present and future because they<br>exist in abundance but the Buddha relics<br>exists in a limited number and before<br>this time uh there are many people<br>building many Buddha images and one of<br>them consecrated the image so if a new<br>new group of people view a new icon and<br>they invite Buddha image from everywhere<br>uh even from the existing Buddha images<br>we will just consider some sort of<br>spiritual depth<br>uh spiritual warfare like because the<br>Buddha really exists in limited number<br>so when people build new icon they<br>invite other image from a Buddha relics<br>from everywhere right it's mean that the<br>relics that existing in the executive<br>images has to leave the brightness and<br>come to the new new icon so what does<br>this mean<br>yes I never thought about this<br>particular potential problem before<br>let's let's take a look at the text and<br>uh so this is the the text that you're<br>asking about yes<br>um this text is often known as koi Yao<br>in KMI<br>um it there's also an existing version<br>of it in Thai that was probably composed<br>in the UTI period<br>um and that<br>I've not found any manuscript evidence<br>for it in Thailand but there's<br>manuscript and inscriptional evidence<br>for it in Cambodia and then in 1869 that<br>version was translated into Kamai so<br>this<br>in the in the Thai version has the same<br>kind of doctrinal problem that you've<br>pointed out so let's let's take a look<br>at where that appears and what we might<br>think about it so this is a text that as<br>you mentioned is used still today in<br>Cambodia for a Buddha image consecration<br>rituals<br>um<br>kinds of Rights so if<br>um<br>we look at the beginning it begins with<br>this opening homage to put Sangha<br>and then it goes right into what you've<br>discussed there's this portion later<br>where the bottomy these Perfections Etc<br>are being invited but it begins with<br>inviting uh relics and as you pointed<br>out these are limited what is so what<br>does it mean to invite them so when it<br>says we invite the relics of the Buddha<br>and Realms both high and low<br>come here come here quickly may you fly<br>Swift and never be delayed merge with<br>our new icon bring your bright Rays<br>Ablaze with Prismatic light the relics<br>of the Victor in all cities and the Isle<br>of Lanka here in Japan and High Heavens<br>and down in Naga Realms Come O relics<br>come quick enter into this new Buddha<br>image and then it goes into some of the<br>very specific relics like the four<br>canines Etc and I never thought about<br>the particular issue that you raised in<br>other words that this would mean that<br>the relics in those locations and enter<br>into a Buddha image and then they're<br>stuck in that Buddha image until someone<br>else conducts a consecration right<br>um<br>I think it's interesting to<br>yeah the text doesn't say that the<br>invitation is metaphorical it says that<br>they're actually supposed to come<br>but it also seems to imply that<br>they somehow either go back or never<br>really leave their resting places<br>because of course whenever this text is<br>recited they're being invited from the<br>traditional places they are thought to<br>be not from whoever most recently<br>performed a Buddha image consecration<br>um but it's interesting that the text<br>doesn't deal with that issue<br>um and now I'd be curious to ask those<br>who use this text in say a Cambodian<br>context today where similar kinds of<br>parallels elsewhere in Southeast Asia<br>what they make of your question so thank<br>you for that and okay and the second<br>question yeah in the this poem yeah uh<br>next to the this part is about<br>invitation of the Buddha gamma without<br>teaching and his<br>uh Transcendent power right and in your<br>essay you describe this as the diamond<br>higher or the Buddha spiritual body but<br>in the poem it doesn't mention the<br>mataya it's just that's why this thing<br>has the Buddha spiritual power and and<br>his teaching yes so what I wonder what<br>is the definition of the Mahaya because<br>Steve Colleen he defined it as the body<br>of eggs and the body of Buddha teaching<br>but but I think it can can mean the body<br>of the Buddha Spirit Transcendent<br>qualities as well yes yes so let's again<br>let's take a look at this passage and<br>see what we can make of it<br>um so after inviting the various<br>portions of<br>relics<br>uh the Buddha's<br>Rays or Halo<br>the different Perfections the nine<br>Supreme states that constitute the Tamma<br>etc etc this is all invited and one is<br>inviting them to come into the image<br>so then I mentioned I think in that<br>essay about this is one way of<br>understanding how in this Cambodian<br>context and presumably in a<br>another tie context as well with the the<br>Thai language text came<br>that there's an understanding that the<br>the Dharma body of the Buddha is somehow<br>being reconstituted in a sense so<br>in a consecration right in Cambodia<br>along with this text there's a key right<br>in which this<br>um<br>this core<br>uh text that's in prose uh with a little<br>bit of verse at the end and this is the<br>PhD dissertation here at the University<br>of otago<br>um that particular text is recited and<br>uh<br>the<br>person conducting the ritual makes this<br>connection between the physical image<br>and the<br>discussion of all of these different<br>nyana or knowledges of the Buddha that<br>are tied to the the physical body of the<br>Buddha and tied to the new the Buddha<br>image to be consecrated culminating in<br>the opening of the eyes of the Buddha<br>and so that's the the context in which I<br>was framing it as the kamakaya of the<br>Buddha but you're right in the text<br>itself uh I don't believe that term<br>appears so maybe maybe the way I framed<br>it isn't precise<br>um because the the text itself doesn't<br>talk about it it's this other text<br>that's recited at this<br>um either immediately before or after<br>that that uses that term explicitly<br>n is<br>that classification ritual right it's<br>more like his transcending qualities<br>right in the com in the context of the<br>uh<br>for the image consecration ritual I I<br>see it as<br>something that brings together a point<br>of Union between the these particular<br>nyana these particular uh<br>Transcendent qualities of Awakening of<br>the Buddha and specific parts of the<br>physical body<br>now this whole text is also called like<br>in some literal sense the Dharma of<br>Union<br>um but the yoga this Union I see the<br>inter the text doesn't explain what what<br>the yoga really means here but I<br>understand it as the union with this<br>physical Buddha image with all of these<br>particular nyanas and tamas and barami<br>and dhadu Etc uh all coming together in<br>the image that's this Union that's being<br>described so it's analogous I think to<br>the way that hamakaya is used as the uh<br>the union between Transcendent qualities<br>and the specific physical parts I think<br>the other thing that's happening here<br>that I I didn't explore as much but I<br>think would be worth exploring in more<br>detail and this shows up in a article by<br>Francois in 1984 1994<br>um and in that piece he<br>chose some of the close connections<br>between ideas around the<br>Spirits were ghosts uh that are in in a<br>sense inhabiting an image what would be<br>in a Thai context those two are tied to<br>the image so there's a a different kind<br>of ontology that's taking place here uh<br>one in which physical images just like<br>um an image of a tutelary deity or in a<br>in a combined context is and the<br>inhabited by a a spirit that is usually<br>understood in non-buddhist terms I think<br>a similar kind of logic is at work here<br>and understanding what's really meant by<br>the invitation of the relics into the<br>image I think requires going into that<br>non-buddest<br>ontology you don't have to frame it as<br>bad but it's but the tradition itself<br>sort of frames it is so I think there's<br>there's a lot to explore with I'm sorry<br>that I can't get into all the possible<br>details about a question but you've<br>opened up some really key areas for<br>exploration<br>um that's a nice segue to Eric's<br>question there which is there any<br>evidence of non-buddist literary<br>Traditions influencing the ascetic form<br>the aesthetic forms or techniques of<br>Southeast Asian but it's poetry and the<br>pre-colonial era for instance Islamic<br>syndic Etc<br>and similarly is there any evidence of<br>non-purdist literary Traditions such as<br>European Christian Etc influence in the<br>so<br>say in a Time context<br>there was certainly in a broader<br>literary<br>um interest in Chinese writing<br>um certainly like the Romance of the<br>Three Kingdoms became important from the<br>19th century but I haven't thought about<br>any sort of particular<br>synthetic or Islamic say in the case of<br>Cambodia Thailand and Laos among<br>areas that from communities that were<br>not primarily<br>oriented toward Islam or to Chinese<br>religions that kind of influence showing<br>up and Buddhist poetry it's quite<br>different in the case of Vietnamese<br>poetry of course where there's<br>um<br>who deeply abundant influence and<br>interaction with the broader East Asian<br>and synthetic literary tradition<br>and in some cases it's harder to find<br>clear evidence of specifically Buddhist<br>kinds of influences on on Vietnamese<br>poetry but we see this long and Rich<br>tradition of working within and Beyond a<br>Semitic patterns<br>um and then the second part of your<br>question is there any evidence of<br>non-foodest literary Traditions such as<br>European Christian uh influence in the<br>colonial or post-colonial year ads<br>um I'm I'm thinking of a book by Stephen<br>Berkowitz<br>um<br>poetry written in the in the 16th<br>century Sri Lanka in the Portuguese<br>period what's it what's it called<br>radicals<br>I'm thinking of something else but yeah<br>no absolutely yeah I I<br>don't have that kind of top of mind at<br>the moment in terms of<br>European literary traditions<br>what<br>I mean there the implication was more I<br>think from memory that<br>that was placed more in the the kind of<br>events of that period replaced more in a<br>sort of a Sri Lankan kind of literary<br>context but I don't know you know poetry<br>Buddhist poetry and colonialism thank<br>you yes wonderful so that radical is not<br>even in the title I don't know what I'm<br>thinking of<br>um<br>so yeah I'm not sure is the short answer<br>um evidence literature is an influence<br>in the colonial posture here is for so<br>for instance in the case of Cambodian<br>literature<br>um many of the intellectual leads who<br>were educated from the 20s 30s 40s uh<br>were reading in French we're reading<br>French poets and the kinds of novels and<br>poetry that were produced in<br>Cambodian language venues in the 50s 60s<br>and 70s were all were often informed by<br>that kind of<br>encounter with French symbolist poets<br>with French popular music with French<br>writing of the of that period and of a<br>prior periodically 19th century writing<br>so there I think there's lots to explore<br>how that those encounters ended up<br>influencing poetry we might nominally<br>call the district that interacts with<br>with Buddhist idea so for instance uh<br>an important Cambodian poet intellectual<br>who vote um for many decades but some of<br>his most important work is from the 50s<br>and 60s<br>we see<br>certainly an engagement and a<br>reformulation of Buddhist ideas but also<br>one that's broadly informed by forms of<br>uh French and other kinds of non-<br>Cambodian literary philosophical and<br>intellectual Traditions so I think<br>there's a lot more to see how that might<br>show up on poetry that we might label as<br>Buddhists but it sort of gets us to this<br>question of you know what really is uh<br>Buddhist poetry in these different cases<br>um<br>Queen writes hangman was a modern<br>Vietnamese Catholic poet also well read<br>in French symbolism and who also had<br>traces of Buddhist thought and Chinese<br>canonical poetry in his work fantastic<br>and Gwen if you could write for us what<br>the dates for for this particular poet<br>um excellent okay<br>um so a similar period in which we see<br>that beginning to develop in a in a<br>Cambodian context though again it's like<br>most of these issues that would have<br>developed first I think in a hidden<br>miscontext in the Siamese case writes<br>Eric I think of the Portuguese Islamic<br>and East Asian communities at UTI but I<br>know nothing of studies of literature at<br>that Court<br>so in the court literature of the UTF<br>period there's a constant invocation of<br>the uh<br>ethnic and linguistic diversity of of<br>UTI and writers were profoundly aware of<br>that and engaging with that and we see<br>into the period in of course in the Arts<br>these different kinds of influences as<br>well what I haven't seen is evidence<br>that those writers were seriously<br>engaged with the reading and translation<br>of Portuguese Islamic and East Asian<br>literature and that that literature<br>shaped what was going on there's this uh<br>just like this popular image in the<br>poetry and literature of that period<br>that<br>that acknowledges that they're living in<br>a Cosmopolitan state<br>that others uh<br>other people with different ways of<br>thinking and dress and and being were<br>present uh certainly the work of Matt<br>reader has brought the way in which uh<br>ideas around ethnicity were articulated<br>in utia and restaurant who's in literary<br>texts but I I would have to check again<br>about this question of uh really<br>concrete literary influence other than<br>other questions or things you all are<br>thinking about at this time<br>the only thing I would add to this is I<br>I have just my own interest in this sort<br>of polemical use of Buddhist poetry by<br>you know what were the<br>um<br>sectarian or political implications of<br>some of these poems that that kind of<br>thing<br>yeah<br>yes yes and I think in the what I'll be<br>sharing today<br>there will be a little bit there's not a<br>ton that sectarians are tied to<br>religious Politics as much but let's see<br>if there could be things that I'm<br>missing there too so I think that's<br>always a good question to keep in mind I<br>haven't because that's not the emphasis<br>of my work I haven't been paying<br>attention to that and what we've been<br>talking about so far but I'm sure that<br>element is present this way<br>this way certainly it's president how<br>people read or make sense of these kinds<br>of text debates and how they're being<br>claimed into a particular lineages so<br>certainly this text that we've been<br>discussing that uh very good in race for<br>us this morning this is one that in a<br>contemporary Cambodian context is really<br>closely associated with certain Quran or<br>traditionalist monasteries that has a<br>whole political connotation within the<br>Cambodian context so there's a way that<br>a text that on the surface doesn't seem<br>to be connected to monastic politics can<br>actually be quite deeply embedded in<br>so uh with these questions in mind and<br>always feel free to bring more questions<br>to the fore let's come back to this the<br>question we'll look at today which is<br>that of of pleasure so over the the<br>course of the week<br>um we began by inquiring around the<br>relationship between Buddhist poetry and<br>language and that I tried to bring out<br>through the particular Journey that this<br>single poly verse originally<br>takes as it expands and is translated<br>and<br>becomes something newer and larger<br>through the process of moving across<br>different cultural and linguistic<br>spheres and Mainland Southeast Asia<br>and that was also a way to introduce us<br>to how poetry shows up across these<br>different linguistic contexts what might<br>remain the same in terms of performance<br>practice in terms of metrical forms and<br>what might change as we see these<br>different forms and interaction then we<br>looked into this question of aspiration<br>and benefit under the broader heading of<br>what I was calling prayer and seeing<br>whether that was a useful term or a<br>problematic term and trying to<br>understand the ways in which these poems<br>are structured particularly this<br>relationship between aspirations and the<br>autobiographical elements we'll see a<br>little bit of that surfacing again today<br>then we went into this question of debt<br>that is the way in which this key<br>concept of Guna in an indic context and<br>expressed in other ways in different<br>Southeast Asian languages shows up as<br>debt to parents as well as an a range of<br>other beings and the connection between<br>those doctrinal ideas around virtue and<br>debt and narratives of mourning and loss<br>we saw some of those that connection to<br>mourning and loss as well and those<br>kinds of narratives showing up yesterday<br>when we looked at ideas around some Vega<br>or shock or stirring and their<br>both in the kinds of poems that we took<br>a closer look at those that are<br>connected to these end-of-life rituals<br>as well as other ways that poetry around<br>shock shows up we saw some of these<br>Aesthetics of shock we exploded<br>statistics as soon as I kind of<br>aesthetic<br>essence or taste or juice that we can<br>um and see going on in the material or<br>are there other ways to understand how<br>shock is operating<br>so today<br>we're turning to the last theme that I<br>wanted to bring up and in some ways this<br>is the least developed theme in my mind<br>so again I really want to bring the rest<br>of you in uh to help me think through<br>what's going on of course Buddhist texts<br>speak<br>extensively about<br>the pleasures of Peace of contentment of<br>bliss of well-being<br>uh Suka this idea of health or happiness<br>or Bliss it's understood differently uh<br>in different contexts<br>other texts particularly those connected<br>to ideas around meditation and different<br>Southeast Asian languages speak to a<br>different kind of pleasure a spiritual<br>kind of pleasure sometimes referred to<br>as BD that is this this Joy this Rapture<br>this Blissful if we have time we'll look<br>at one meditation poem uh that's very<br>much invested in these kinds of ideas at<br>the same time this deliberately using a<br>term in English that allows us to<br>explore what are chemically speaking<br>perhaps different Realms but pleasure of<br>course is also tied to ideas around<br>sensual pleasure and sensuality uh in a<br>Southeast Asian Buddhist context so<br>particularly this idea of karma or<br>sensual pleasure is one that shows up<br>particularly as something to be<br>critiqued in Buddhist poetry but we'll<br>also see ways in which uh moments of<br>sensual pleasure can be celebrated by<br>Buddhist poets or uh tied into<br>narratives of longing or Mourning we<br>certain we saw certain elements of that<br>in our discussion of uh the other day as<br>well in that classic of of Thai poetry<br>at the same time much of what we've been<br>talking about has centered on ideas<br>around euphony that is this aesthetic<br>pleasure or the beauty in sound and<br>there are different words in Southeast<br>Asian languages that might be used to<br>describe this certainly<br>is one way of understanding that our<br>entire<br>and allow contacts that gets at part of<br>the function some would say even looking<br>at the work of Thomas Hudak the<br>core function of Southeast Asian poetry<br>is to be<br>a source of aesthetic pleasure in the<br>very sound of the Poetry that's part of<br>what these dense structures of internal<br>and external rhyme and alliteration are<br>all working towards and why it's often<br>such a challenge to capture<br>in English translation what's going on<br>for a reader or listener of these these<br>bodies of work and that equally applies<br>in a Vietnamese context as well and the<br>very little bit we read from we use uh<br>the tale of of you<br>um<br>we certainly saw that that particular<br>structure of rhyme and the the Mastery<br>with which uh he is able to make sound<br>and sense and structure come together in<br>a powerful way is a key part of why the<br>Poetry uh has been enjoyed um<br>and memorized and held closely to<br>people's hearts and lips over so many<br>years there's another dimension of<br>pleasure that I don't know so much how<br>to frame and that's the enjoyment of of<br>other kinds of<br>senses through this idea of aesthetic<br>pleasure particularly visual we can also<br>look at ideas around olfactory pleasure<br>as well but let's I think I'm<br>particularly curious about uh<br>this kind of expressions of aesthetic<br>Rapture<br>um that to me challenge certain<br>dichotomies between what is considered<br>an wholesome or unwholesome state and a<br>Buddhist doctrinal context<br>so with that in mind uh let's explore<br>some of these examples I'd like for us<br>to begin with a transitional piece one<br>that helps us think about this question<br>of shock and and its relationship to<br>pleasure<br>and that's through some examples from<br>this masterpiece of<br>his<br>journey to angkorod<br>um this this particular text was<br>composed sometime between 1909 and maybe<br>1915<br>um and it it's an account of a journey<br>uh that<br>took from his native<br>to the temples of Angkor Wat in siemria<br>province that became possible after the<br>Retro retrocession of these Northern<br>provinces of Cambodia that had been<br>under Siamese Administration since the<br>end of the 18th century uh to Cambodia<br>and so yeah legal retrocession took<br>place in 1907 the journey itself took<br>place in 1909<br>as we discussed the other day in<br>actually the first day because<br>was the poet who composed that very fine<br>uh Khmer version of the verses to invite<br>a monastic to preach that was later<br>translated by Vietnamese<br>he uh that is on was a keen student of<br>certainly poly literature but also time<br>material as well and was almost<br>certainly uh quite well read in the<br>works of<br>uh whose style he is the closest analog<br>to in Kamai<br>um and we see that of course in the the<br>very genre that he's chosen this uh<br>genre that's known as milia and Kamaya<br>Nira in Thai that is usually translated<br>as separation it's a it's a travel poem<br>that involves the author constantly<br>reflecting back on their beloved who<br>they have left behind at home reflecting<br>on toponyms along the way uh engaging in<br>close observation of of Nature and<br>man-made structures and how humans<br>behave but always tied back into this<br>formal structure of a love poem and the<br>very particular uh form of glompe uh<br>this eight syllable poetry used for<br>um<br>you know poetry in by the 19th century<br>in Thailand is also the one that's<br>adopted by on in his Kamai composition<br>here<br>so we see this at the the very beginning<br>where he<br>um first invokes this is from a little<br>later in the text at the very beginning<br>uh he invokes his beloved who's he's<br>leaving from as he goes off on this<br>journey at times it can feel hyperbolic<br>since he's only gone about two weeks but<br>the the depth to which he describes<br>um missing home and missing his wife in<br>this case is<br>um made to be something profound in the<br>text<br>then as he goes through he he observes<br>uh all what he sees along this riverine<br>journey on these sometimes quite narrow<br>slews leading from<br>across the the lesab and over to simria<br>and<br>if you if you're at all familiar with<br>poetry you you'll note that often when<br>he sees uh<br>people along the river particularly<br>women that he finds attractive he<br>he comments on that and often in a very<br>extensive way and it's it's a way of<br>recounting on his his Frailty but it's<br>also a way of him being honest about the<br>ways in which visually he's enjoying the<br>the sights that he's he's taking it<br>un takes us somewhat different approach<br>and his his poetic is much more<br>explicitly Buddhist uh than that of<br>sunhan pool and in that he makes even<br>the way he observes women or reflects on<br>his own uh<br>ways that he's pining for his wife very<br>closely connected to uh Buddhist ideas<br>including ideas around some Vega so here<br>I wanted to sort of just bring us into<br>this this kind of tension between ideas<br>of pleasure and ideas of Samuel so as<br>he's traveling around this uh small<br>stream out to towards the the lysab he<br>he encounters<br>um a young girl who's uh<br>transplanting rice<br>um saying how transient uh that and here<br>he's you know using a phrase something<br>like<br>Amiga like how impermanent or have pity<br>on that life limb uh Girl's Life<br>stooping diso seedling scorched by the<br>sun her face plastered with mud and<br>Dusty Earth I mourn the strife and<br>strain of those born poor<br>she had reached his rank in great Renown<br>she died in those and lofty luxury<br>adorned with fine perfume and fair<br>powder hair trimmed and dyed her<br>complexion was would shine she'd flaunt<br>her charm to Captivate rich men she<br>looked over never overlooked but staying<br>now by the Sun and by the soil she can<br>ensnare and earn their love no more<br>and<br>here we have this sense that he's<br>there's both a sense of Attraction and<br>Revolution that's coming out uh through<br>the poetry and we see this uh show up<br>again as we move to the to the next page<br>here on the right<br>uh and<br>hear where he writes I sit perplexed my<br>gaze still on the girl we reach on songs<br>Monitor and there he begins to reflect<br>on the debris that's clogging the<br>pathway as he's a really again narrow<br>channels as he's they're trying to make<br>it out to the Donley saw and as uh they<br>the boat essentially it's a steamboat<br>gets stuck uh he then reflects on the<br>way that this sense of stuckness uh can<br>be mirrored without living beings are<br>mired in<br>sensual pleasure and that that um is uh<br>what he sees in the metaphor so at the<br>bottom there I see how tight the scum<br>griddles the boat as lust would Mount<br>our bodies are soon trapped<br>in that dark place the wheel the wheel<br>is shrouded off and light is screamed<br>lassiers and singes creatures in the<br>world to rule and regret base<br>earthliness the vessel's frame is like<br>our human form the short of insight<br>cannot see the real the blades are<br>wisdom the slices and shears the<br>floating scum is less dropped away<br>Escape From the shallows of sorrow and<br>strife depend on Brave wisdom a Paddle<br>Wheel<br>and this in a sense reminds us of his<br>the way he unpacks the metaphor of the<br>different parts of the drum he's taking<br>particular Buddhist ideas and uh<br>bringing him bringing them into this<br>very concrete metaphor the boat's<br>innards or our bodies workings earth<br>water fire wind the fort bases the Helms<br>the post of wakeful remembrance the<br>bamboo poles the clear Minds reflection<br>the sticks and scum are meditations foes<br>preventing us from seeing what is real<br>the water whirls around like birth and<br>death drowning creatures in this carnal<br>Abyss<br>and here we then turn in the somewhat<br>more personal or autobiographical uh<br>Direction it's not just the lust of<br>creatures in general that he's<br>reflecting on but it's really his own<br>alas that this body does not spurn lust<br>instead it's spun around is in a gyre<br>and well we weep and wail for we forget<br>to follow our Lord's Flawless words of<br>truth reflecting on myself shaken and<br>stirred this is explicitly evoking Sun<br>Vega here forwarded by thirst for all<br>Earthly Delights I've seen the truth but<br>it's for girls like Pine fathers of lust<br>and fonts of mystery lust yields not<br>restraining seals are tighter my poor<br>heart and its loved are wrenched apart<br>even if I take sacred writ as rule<br>worldly lust stands unhabbered<br>unhindered ditching the Dharma cannot<br>Dallas this fire desires pitch black<br>like night with shapes unseen seldom<br>sloft off but Fades but it's never gone<br>and here he's uh<br>he's already in his<br>60s I think but is still you know<br>thinking about perhaps lust fading over<br>the course of his life but never being<br>God can washing tar stain silk remove<br>the coal to Scrubs no use the color<br>changes not tar stains are ever bound to<br>their Blackness as taints are tied to<br>creatures thus enthralled fancy that you<br>could somehow wipe from clean<br>straining to let go I'm locked in<br>tighter practice is stopped not steady<br>stayed not still I said to rule myself<br>with the Dharma like Duck hands clearing<br>the scum all at once<br>once we pass through the scum and sticks<br>float back again settling into the<br>self-same clumps the sticks and scum are<br>like thirsting desire we chop and clear<br>but choked Remains the Stream<br>he then continues this reflection as he<br>sees the along the along with the scum<br>that's in the middle of the stream but<br>that the carry-on of cats and dogs and<br>other creatures along the side so again<br>in some sense explicitly invoking this<br>context of<br>the meditation on the decomposition of<br>corpses but here it's not humans but<br>animal corpses that set<br>um his contemplation and motion and on<br>the right he says how transient the<br>lives of All Creatures again coming back<br>to this sense of impermanence as a<br>as a node for invoking some Vega but<br>here as somewhat of an antidote for this<br>experience of lust that he's feeling<br>along this journey<br>um both thinking back to his wife and<br>then also the people he sees along the<br>way I humbly strive to Quake at Corpse's<br>sight yet lust must still be burning<br>inside me for I think of my darling my<br>dear love<br>permanence is only on my lips<br>reflecting on the follow should Purge<br>desire Crush lust and take me to the<br>edge of Trance that is into these<br>progressively deeper states of<br>meditation that texts like<br>describe as the key consequence of<br>engaging in a super meditation Etc a<br>true Yogi would seize upon the object as<br>the object of meditation uh<br>I've lost my calm and can't focus at all<br>to see a dead dog's corpse as my body<br>can't help disenchant me my dear friends<br>oh what am I to do whoever's now<br>protecting me<br>so I just wanted to bring this up as a<br>kind of bridge so we can see that ideas<br>around pleasure particular sensual<br>pleasure and its critiques are often<br>tied to ideas around some Vega and<br>Buddhist poetry from these periods let's<br>give you just a quick question about<br>this before in the stanzas before there<br>you had a number of times translated<br>something as the real<br>kind of thing or is that some other I<br>think it's uh in this in this context uh<br>I can that's fine yeah it's not it's not<br>it's not something<br>um<br>it's not a particular particularly<br>doctrinal that's what I was curious<br>about yeah but it was I think it was<br>something like in this context in other<br>words the<br>is truths cannot be seen<br>um because one is shrouded by<br>the terms he uses to describe meditation<br>on their hand are quite specific in<br>doctrinal but when he's talking about<br>theirs<br>so<br>let me move on uh and<br>I want to bring up a brief example this<br>poem uh Liam writes reflecting on death<br>and decomposition reminds me of the<br>skeletons Etc and some taiwat kept There<br>To Remind monks and people of<br>impermanence and yes absolutely there's<br>a very explicit connection between that<br>practice in in Thai temples also it<br>appears in Laos and Cambodia as well but<br>most prominently in Thailand and to my<br>knowledge<br>um that's connected to this practice of<br>assana that a in in the absence of being<br>able to go and attend an autopsy or in<br>the absence of being able to watch a<br>corpse decompose in the forest that a<br>skeleton which is one of the stages in a<br>super meditation uh being a key Focus<br>for that kind of practice so you're<br>absolutely right these are closely<br>connected<br>one of the key uh first versions of the<br>Buddhist of the Buddha's life composed<br>in mid 20th century Cambodia is the uh<br>that is the<br>um<br>poetic version of the Buddha's life<br>and this is a I'm just going to show you<br>a brief excerpt the whole text passes<br>through a number of different poetic<br>meters and offers a way of<br>retelling The Narrative of of the within<br>some of the forms of poetry that have<br>become prominent by the late 19th and<br>early 20th centuries in Cambodia here's<br>the particular moment uh that's often<br>connected to explorations of this idea<br>of the or this middle way or a moderate<br>way<br>in in Buddhist texts and it's the moment<br>had been practicing aesthetic practices<br>in the woods for some six years and uh<br>destroying his his body uh but still not<br>attaining his goal of Awakening so as<br>the text reads one day in the Lord of<br>the Gods descended from<br>with a Charming triple strong loot to<br>strum and sing for the great man and<br>this triple strung loot uh is in a<br>Cambodian context tied to the Japan<br>which is an instrument<br>that actually has only two strings that<br>one plays but there's an additional<br>string that's always part of the<br>instrument I don't know if it actually<br>has a sympathetic resonance or it's just<br>traditionally been there whether it's<br>tied to this narrative but in Temple<br>murals of this scene it's always this<br>particular instrument that's to that's<br>first he tuned one string to taut and<br>soon that chord snapped in Twain and<br>then a string two lacks lack to Chris<br>twang so I tightened the slack to return<br>it again the moderate way not too tight<br>to loose Midol fall silent listening to<br>the strings strung together in songs<br>both long and short The Melodies rang<br>true owned Harmony<br>and so this is this key Moment In The<br>Narrative of the Buddha's progress<br>towards Awakening uh when he realizes<br>that well too much in this direction of<br>indulgence and hedonistic pleasure is<br>not the way and same uh is can be said<br>for too much<br>um<br>over exertion and ascetic practices so<br>uh I offer it as a way of framing how<br>ideas around pleasure and renunciation<br>show up and put his texts more generally<br>and we'll see whether that is relevant<br>to a material we'll look at going<br>forward<br>I want to bring us into some texts that<br>are not necessarily ordinarily framed as<br>particularly Buddhist<br>but that were often composed by Buddhist<br>monks that would have been recited in<br>Buddhist ceremonies<br>um and that are framed at the beginning<br>and end of these texts in particular<br>around Buddhist ideas this one Don Tio<br>is one of the most famous narrative<br>texts in the Cambodian context there are<br>many different versions of it on the<br>right is a version by<br>um<br>and on the left is the most is an image<br>of the author the most famous literary<br>and sounds uh version is the one that<br>many Cambodian school children have<br>studied over the years it's unclear<br>where exactly the narrative comes from<br>unlike many of the other poetic long<br>narratives preserved in Buddhist<br>monasteries during this period in the<br>18th and uh 18 19 during the 20th<br>centuries there isn't a Thai or Lao<br>parallel to this text it's uh and it's<br>clearly set in a Cambodian setting<br>some versions of the royal Chronicles<br>mention a similar narrative that<br>narrative is sometimes set in the 15th<br>16th or 17th centuries there's a<br>disagreement in the Chronicles about<br>that but the historicity of that has<br>been sometimes put in doubt by Scholars<br>so<br>what's important for us is that this is<br>a story in which the hero uh<br>storm we see on the the right along with<br>it's also who's next to him uh Tom is<br>initially a Buddhist novice and uh they<br>fought the two of them fall in love<br>while uh Tom is is still in robes<br>um and it sets up this very long and<br>tragic ultimately very violent ending<br>for for all involved<br>um in some ways it it's an arc that uh<br>is constant with what we see in<br>lillipala but unlikely deeper law<br>there's there's<br>um<br>well it's a very different story I won't<br>get into the differences but it's a very<br>very different story told at a really<br>different time<br>um and is much more connected to<br>exploring ideas around<br>um<br>consequences of leaving uh the Buddhist<br>order<br>um disobeying one's teacher on uh the<br>power struggles between the king and<br>Elites and the precarious position of uh<br>a woman who attract the interest of men<br>um the beginning of this text is one<br>where we can see this kind of autograph<br>autobiographical Framing and set of<br>aspirations appearing so I'll just<br>briefly show you what's going on here<br>first to just get a sense of the kind of<br>internal and external rhyme this very<br>first uh phrase here uh very first<br>and so that constant form of<br>alliteration and different types of<br>Rhymes<br>are all part of the particular craft<br>that he's doing and certainly in the way<br>he frames it here he's saying this is<br>not an original composition but one that<br>he's trying to<br>tune into a better literary composition<br>there's a lot of debate whether he<br>plagiarized this from another poet's in<br>public or whether this is a complete<br>rewriting of the story but in how he<br>frames it saying I tried to retain<br>remove and replace but oral Lord this is<br>this poly term Gita like hearsay I<br>struggled to conserve less my diction<br>should waste the very pith I matched it<br>to the bequeath yarn school time<br>then he introduces his name with this<br>kind of name riddle if you remember we<br>saw on the the text and the anisangs of<br>the benefits of the we had with the H<br>the U and the N being articulated in<br>this way the same goes for how he<br>explains his name Sam then he gives a<br>little bit of a sense of where he came<br>from that uh how he ordained that he uh<br>took<br>um<br>that is a preceptor uh then had him<br>gradually Ascend the Sangha hierarchy<br>uh and that in doing so he became uh<br>freed in some sense from the<br>deprivations of the deprivations the<br>privations of the French uh Colonial<br>regime so when he writes here embarking<br>out for alms of far and near at hand I<br>feared not uh Tai here is a Vietnamese<br>word for Teacher but it's borrowed into<br>the Khmer context uh to mean<br>the uh civil servants often who were<br>often Vietnamese and were proficient in<br>in French during colonial the colonial<br>Cambodian period in or uh doing the the<br>work of the colonial Administration nor<br>boy lackey's boy being this uh loanword<br>into French and then into Vietnamese to<br>describe the underlings of those civil<br>servants who charge us with their crimes<br>in claims of land without a proper God<br>for want of embankments<br>then he in addition to citing himself<br>with situating himself within this<br>particular early colonial early to mid<br>Colonial period in Cambodia he gives the<br>date for the poem as we've seen in other<br>compositions<br>um which amounts to uh 1915 A.D and then<br>uh he<br>then has this invocation uh to the<br>Buddha to the Dharma and the Sangha<br>and begins this uh closing portion to<br>the preface where he he prays for all of<br>these different<br>um entities to whom he feels he owes a<br>debt uh particularly his preceptors and<br>the other monastics who are involved in<br>the ritual of becoming a monk uh as well<br>as his parents and all these other<br>different uh beings that we have looked<br>at on back on Wednesday so the virtues<br>of water and mighty fire of sun earth<br>the holy Moon holy wind great stars and<br>deity secluded in The Sixteen Brahma<br>Realms and all of those this is down to<br>stanza 28 mean the glory of all these<br>Mighty ones who shade and shelter is<br>silent and Serene grant me freedom from<br>lice vicissitudes according to my<br>heart's aspiration whatever sicknesses<br>may come to me may they never cause me<br>illness inside and my body be clear and<br>unclouded everlustrous like the round of<br>the Moon<br>and after this opening uh biograph<br>autobiographical statement and set of<br>aspirations we move into the story<br>itself where he begins by saying let me<br>recount the tale of a boy named boom<br>raised in The Paddy fields of Rothman<br>province<br>and we have a sense of how he's growing<br>up and then we move to the on the right<br>page here he and his fellow young novice<br>month like<br>um<br>towards the as they progress in their<br>career as novices this is down towards<br>the bottom on wholesome thoughts weighed<br>down on boom's body and this is often a<br>phrasing used to describe<br>um for those who are coming under the<br>sway of lust or interested in sensual<br>Pleasures but<br>um they're being framed because they're<br>monastics as uh unwholesome thoughts he<br>confessed to what uh to like as if the<br>come on help me out here we're just<br>selling a few trays at a time profits<br>are down soon our business will fail<br>don't you wonder about that old saying<br>and every place that's close and nearer<br>there's only rest if my girl's here the<br>Ancients do not err in their true words<br>for we are too young for we too are<br>young men here in this world you know<br>nothing Beyond begging for food<br>shouldn't we break the mold and travel<br>far so then they come up with this plan<br>the Abbott their Master is quite<br>suspicious of you know you know why why<br>do you want to do this are you sure<br>that's<br>um if this is good and then on the<br>bottom here he says go by all means but<br>stay out of trouble uh don't act the<br>fool if you see a girl you shouldn't be<br>clown about or play around unless your<br>behavior spoil my good name<br>shame of worldly disgrace and Scorn<br>defies the rules to put the set for<br>monks once you've sold your load of<br>these baskets they're making uh hurry<br>back here don't Terry there to tally<br>losses and games<br>then we get The Narrative of how they uh<br>set off on this journey portion here<br>I've I've skipped in my translation<br>um<br>but what I wanted to bring out is the<br>way that the presence of these two young<br>monks arouses sensual desire in the<br>people they visit<br>so<br>uh just in the second stanza here some<br>stared with spite<br>resenting his hands to embody some<br>fantasized of taking him back home if<br>only I could snatch and snuggle him<br>close I'd have my way with him so they<br>got near they pristled with delight<br>before his face<br>probing their new heartthrob against a<br>well the frenzy crowd gathered at a<br>shaded gnome the sight of a lovely town<br>named<br>men and women alike amassed aroused by<br>them<br>and so they this sets off a a series of<br>scenes in which they're trying to<br>persuade the novices to say to stay and<br>then they begin to recite and it's it's<br>Doom's uh beautiful voice when reciting<br>these kinds of Buddhist texts<br>particularly this version of the the<br>suntar Java that he ends up reciting uh<br>attracts the attention of people in the<br>village including boom Theo his eventual<br>love interest boom's chanting voice was<br>crisp and smooth and sweet when he sang<br>all the people of rushed over to listen<br>young Lads old men widows and fresh<br>maidens all gathered around<br>and so this way in which ideas around<br>euphony around the aesthetic Pleasures<br>in sound in this text framed explicitly<br>as a Buddhist text but really going into<br>these quite secular themes is tied to<br>the sensual desire or arousal on the<br>part of those listening to them so we<br>have again this tension that's existing<br>particularly because the portions that<br>are being recited are in fact uh the the<br>mourning of Princess mantri and the<br>morning of<br>the two children of prince vasantra who<br>are being given away they're some of the<br>most emotive scenes in the whole uh of<br>the vasantra sometimes scenes that might<br>be associated with with some Vega with<br>other kinds of motions that could be<br>tied to religious context but here<br>they're serving in some sense to arouse<br>the lay people who are who are enchanted<br>by the sensual pleasures of sound and uh<br>just to sort of show you what that those<br>scenes are that uh<br>Phil must be saying this is from a Thai<br>version from the mahata come along this<br>is the oldest and one of the most<br>influential uh bilingual polytai<br>versions of the placenta jadaka<br>and uh<br>and I'll skip this discussing its poetic<br>form uh for a moment but just to give<br>um<br>in this sermon version tied into this<br>particular form of poetry which also<br>would have been recited melodically we<br>have the poly portions in plain Roman<br>type and the Thai version the Thai<br>portions in<br>um<br>bold<br>where we have something like being led<br>away the children or monks regarding the<br>prince's two deer loves the Brahman<br>whose heart was hardened took them away<br>as they cried out and here these are the<br>two uh children uh<br>and<br>um<br>no uh Charlie and Krishna it's the my<br>way of saying I forget that<br>Charlie and gun Hunter I think is in the<br>poly Christian said to their father<br>these words which the two Royal issue<br>uttered to the Lord the prince of the<br>teachings thus please tell Mom we aren't<br>sick please Lord tell the princess that<br>we are neither sick nor sad if we're<br>free from Pain and you Dad please be<br>happy as for you Lord please keep it<br>well for when suffering comes we can<br>bear it oh Father<br>little elephants and Horses The Lonely<br>black elephant and horse figures lying<br>here and these are oxen the wild oxen<br>molded to be friends still seen there<br>please give them to moths the Lions and<br>the rest Give Them All to princess<br>Madrid our mother our mother please by<br>them her sorrow will end that she may<br>Dodge grief's pain and waste for when<br>our faces she sees not these toys should<br>take their place oh Lord and here it's<br>this tragic misunderstanding on the part<br>of the children thinking that these<br>these toys rather than the the presence<br>of the children themselves would be able<br>to placate madri when she comes back and<br>sees that her husband<br>is given away their two children is what<br>is designed to arouse the sense of<br>Pathos in the audience of these texts<br>particularly when portions like this get<br>expanded in Poetic versions and the<br>Khmer versions that are being evoked and<br>don't feel or greatly expand on these<br>kinds of passes images and yet in The<br>Narrative of Theo itself the kind of uh<br>narratives of mourning even the way of<br>some Vega is evoked is tied to people<br>being lost in the aesthetic pleasure of<br>listening<br>let me return now uh to another text and<br>this is one where again we see this kind<br>of interaction between ideas around<br>sensual pleasure and Buddhist authors or<br>Buddhist framings of texts<br>is celebrated today as one of the most<br>important poets in Cambodian history<br>we know a little bit about his life from<br>the Chronicles it's hard to tell exactly<br>how much is historical he lived quite<br>briefly probably was born at the<br>beginning of the 17th century so died<br>quite Young<br>and he is known for his his<br>quite learned Works in in a Buddhist<br>sphere his kinds of Buddhist didactic<br>poetry but he also left a body of<br>romantic poems<br>uh until recently these were thought to<br>be incomplete when I was visiting the<br>British library and going through and<br>trying to help re-catalog some of the<br>client manuscripts there I came across<br>to this particular version which has<br>complete versions of almost all of his<br>romantic poems uh the this particular<br>manuscript dates from the 1830s and is<br>one of a group of some of the oldest LA<br>parellos and and kabai script to survive<br>as you can see it's not it's a little<br>hard to read in portions because uh the<br>um<br>I'm forgetting the name for this kind of<br>ink<br>um but it has uh rubbed away in portions<br>can you say it again<br>hold it on yeah I just can't think of<br>no I think it's called corperman<br>okay yeah yeah<br>ascending<br>yeah it's maybe it's made it's our city<br>yeah so it's an arsenic based yellow ink<br>like this<br>on this blackened lamparello<br>so this text on the surface is is purely<br>a uh romantic poem<br>in a way it's a kind of uh nirad or kind<br>of nerea but traveling through time in<br>that sense I think it has a certain<br>um this poem of of mourning and of<br>sensual longing uh that's one of the<br>masterpieces of utl literature there's a<br>new translation of that<br>um available I haven't seen it yet but<br>there's a new translation available from<br>uh<br>and and Chris Baker<br>um this uh so my version of this poem<br>it's actually it's a much much shorter<br>poem than uh and it's in the manuscript<br>it's joined with about<br>um 12 other uh romantic poems attributed<br>to apprenticeship<br>um this one has this repeating line<br>figure which is we saw in that much<br>later uh poem the one on invoking the<br>the sound of clunk hike or the the drum<br>the funeral March poem that we explored<br>yesterday<br>um and this opening line prolonged it's<br>one that repeats at the beginning of<br>each of the stanzas in this uh crows<br>uh and the Journey Through Time is just<br>within the the<br>a single night from midday until the<br>next morning and he goes through this<br>process of longing for his beloved<br>through this close observation of both<br>the the Beauty and the stirring power of<br>nature so it's a poem that's invested in<br>articulating what's so moving about<br>nature and also connecting it to his<br>particular experience<br>uh it's also one that's very much tied<br>to a Buddhist vision of cosmology and<br>sort of ties the Turning of a single uh<br>day and night to this this broader<br>cosmological Vision uh to some extent I<br>think is we can make this comparison to<br>uh in the Thai context that actually<br>shows up even more in his uh<br>other romantic poems but I think in this<br>one this fascination with the Turning of<br>the Spheres uh within the context of<br>romantic poetry by someone who is<br>themselves quite a learned in religious<br>person to me really brings up this<br>resonance with John Dunn the<br>17th century 16th 16th centuries I don't<br>know<br>something like that yeah thank you yeah<br>uh poet who was who's known for his<br>verse in this kind of genre<br>so if I'll just<br>skip the beginning part here and go to<br>this part my soul of gold Twilight has<br>come the sun's race hide how bright the<br>moon it's this Source High soft light<br>scatters Darkness clothes my soul of<br>gold the moon glimmers chief of the<br>Stars<br>a bird song carries rustling wind sorry<br>when all is hushed bird song carries a<br>rustling wind douses The Dusk my soul of<br>gold evening arrives the moon orbits<br>around the pole of Mount meru it's<br>slopes gleaming with lunar light<br>my soul of gold Moonbeam Shimmer I see<br>your face perfect and round Bejeweled by<br>gems twinkling stars far from the earth<br>my soul of gold night time has come the<br>moon grows full it's orbed and wrapped<br>by constellations as the lone Lord of<br>Starry Skies my soul of Golds here in<br>this world there's only you my golden<br>friend your skin exudes the finest Bliss<br>in Realms of lust<br>and here he then goes more explicitly<br>into what he is particularly missing in<br>the physical Union uh between him and<br>his beloved and we get this Echo that we<br>that we see also in taipur to this<br>period uh what's by contemporary<br>literary critics uh are usually referred<br>to as well as<br>this term is probably coming out of the<br>way uh this sense of wonder is tied to<br>the erotic scenes in the law but here<br>there's this way in which nature and<br>sensuality are very clearly linked my<br>soul of gold at such moments My Love<br>would swell we'd sing as one in search<br>of bliss our bodies joined to the same<br>tomb my soul of gold peels of Thunder<br>rocked Me In Waves as if you were here<br>are looms entwined rumoring nothings<br>throughout the time<br>and then as the poem ends uh we turn<br>back to the quiet and longing so it goes<br>through this particular kind of Arc one<br>that as you mentioned Alexander it's<br>interesting to see this reference to<br>mount meru this<br>um<br>the reference to all this sort of<br>cosmological elements and this close<br>observation of what's happening in this<br>change of time from day to night and<br>Back Again<br>within the context of a a<br>a romantic poem<br>yeah I've got some questions so what's<br>it to essentially the soul so what what<br>is the original<br>um term of Khmer oh yes so this term is<br>uh equivalent in almost all cases with<br>Tai Kwan okay<br>um and so including all of the different<br>of these Soul recalling ceremonies in a<br>Thai context and allow context etc those<br>are all paralleled by the prolong and<br>and Kamai<br>so some people say it's 20 years<br>yeah<br>for me I think these are I think of<br>these as different kinds of con contexts<br>so that something this term like of<br>Consciousness that gets uh on our entire<br>Union and Kamai that gets emphasized in<br>Buddhist spheres can sometimes be uh<br>disconnected from this idea that I think<br>of as quite autophagus idea of the Quan<br>or the prologue the souls that inhabit<br>the body that are multiple that are not<br>involved in the process of<br>transmigration<br>um and then the use of it here is<br>you know it's the sense of<br>of its<br>it's one's beloved because the the Quan<br>is that which is so close to us just<br>like sometimes uh metaphors around love<br>or tied to like tied to our own eyes uh<br>this is something that's very common in<br>Southeast Asian poetry like I love you<br>the same way I love my own eye like<br>you're that Inseparable to me that's<br>same in the same way this is the the<br>sense of using the word Quan like you're<br>as close or as beloved to me as the<br>yeah so let me move on to uh One More<br>poem here and then uh let me we will<br>open up through a bit more discussion so<br>here I wanted to bring in another poem<br>in which we see these kinds of tensions<br>between you know Buddhist ideas poems<br>Being Framed in a in a Buddhist context<br>and also very clear ideas around uh<br>aesthetic pleasure as well as sensual<br>pleasure we see both of those kinds of<br>um<br>here he in the preface<br>um<br>I hail from the chief clan of Cambodia a<br>young Royal born for Sovereign Bliss<br>having set out from our old capital<br>um that is of udon at this period uh in<br>near Cambodia I ventured to Bangkok City<br>of Angels and here this is politically<br>very much connected to the time that he<br>was one of several young uh Cambodian<br>monarchs during this period in which<br>Cambodia was politically subordinated to<br>Thailand that were raised in Bangkok<br>during the early rotanakosan period<br>there I penned this long poem rooted in<br>sacred Bali scriptures keeping with the<br>tale still preached by Reverend monks<br>and teachers and he doesn't frame it<br>here as uh translating it from the Thai<br>instead frames it is translating it from<br>the Pali but of course at this time<br>there was already a poem Kaki in the<br>Thai context and this is very closely<br>related to that there's a wonderful ma<br>thesis by slangs alpia<br>um<br>at the Royal Academy of Cambodia that<br>that deals with<br>literary poems particularly long<br>narratives in the Cambodian literary<br>and in that she does some close<br>comparisons between the Thai and the<br>in short I warn I wove this yarn into<br>tidy verse to narrate a past life of Our<br>Lord Buddha and my stanzas endure for<br>long to come and Lords and commoners<br>keep them in mind<br>and then he gives a framing to it that's<br>explicitly connected to this Buddhist<br>moral one that's quite misogynistic<br>actually in its framing<br>um but tied to this idea of impermanence<br>as well and then uh giving it a date<br>which allows us to date when he composed<br>this poem he didn't himself Ascend the<br>throne into until the 19th until the<br>1840s so he wrote this while still a<br>young man uh in in<br>and again it ends with this kind of<br>apology my words may lack and true<br>eloquence for I simply follow women of<br>old inscribed in ancient tones of<br>polytexts are not so wise to dare to<br>rewrite scripture<br>um and then uh when we go to the the<br>um we see that it's framed again as<br>ajotica I tell a tale of the Buddha<br>great Lord most merciful back when<br>you're still perfecting the path to<br>highest Awakening then he takes this<br>particular rebirth here as a Lord among<br>the garudas like in other words the<br>chief Garuda those who have and have<br>this shame of eagles with limbs of man<br>that's a<br>um<br>an important figure in thailau and and<br>my art as well and so we learn a little<br>bit about where he he dwells<br>and sorry<br>and then we're introduced to the king<br>the human King of the realm<br>hmm<br>we now go into this long and quite<br>elaborate description of the palace<br>and elaborate descriptions of palaces<br>are a key Motif in Mainland Southeast<br>Asian literature particularly in thailau<br>and Khmer literature it's very common to<br>have these long elaborate and<br>aesthetically sort of rapturous<br>descriptions of what the Palaces uh were<br>like that try to capture their their<br>beauty and might so we certainly see<br>that in the uh<br>um an important piece of early utl<br>literature we see some aspects of this<br>in the story of King law that we looked<br>at the other day<br>um and it's very much present in the<br>that Masterpiece of Lao literature that<br>we looked at the preface to songs Inside<br>by uh man come uh again replete with<br>these very elaborate descriptions of the<br>pleasures and the beauty of the palace<br>so<br>uh<br>uh here I'll skip to the second uh<br>description of it above it all Rose<br>palaces and five-towered I wish I knew<br>how to pronounce this word having<br>translated it uh when conceal arrays I<br>think topped by shiva's sharp tridents<br>gleaming against the dazzling sky<br>there were buffalo chins Brahma faces<br>quartets of spiers and Sky blossoms<br>with Fierce garudas and not as Locked In<br>Perpetual battles all be decked in<br>Golden gems all was covered in silver<br>gloss finer than the heavens themselves<br>as this fashioned by holy hands the<br>Royal beds made of gold and laid with<br>thousands of shining gems shown and<br>shimmered by Perfect prisms breathtaking<br>Beauty brought to life the king's<br>three-story Royal Palace was filled with<br>dazzling ornaments shaped like Lotus<br>leaves and buns all interlaced and<br>twisted braids on top were Angels bent<br>in prayer beneath them nadas fought<br>their foes down to the bottom Fierce<br>over supported all the way with clubs<br>canopies and paracels Leafs and gold<br>sparkling with their blazing fringes<br>studded with rows of precious jewels<br>glittered under the solar light its<br>audience Hall was ornamented with floral<br>prints from floor to ceiling his Harem<br>with its feminine forms had walls and<br>laid with glowing chapels<br>and so the description of this wealthy<br>and righteous King is very much tied to<br>the glory and the aesthetic pleasures of<br>his Palace<br>um as well as those who inhabit it the<br>Royal Court was always packed with<br>ministers tasked with government with<br>poets charged with the pen with priests<br>entrusted to chant with wise sages and<br>astrologers with Craftsmen skilled in<br>every trade with top singers of every<br>tongue with dancers of dazzling Beauty<br>and this idea of singers of every tongue<br>we see this also in the UTI context back<br>to the question that<br>um<br>I think Eric who raised around the<br>Cosmopolitan nature of the Thai state in<br>various periods this idea of sip song<br>the 12 languages of the 12 ethnicities<br>is something that's constantly evoked<br>and performed through a musical<br>Dimension so that's what's being<br>sort of said here with this top singers<br>of every tongue with dancers of dazzling<br>Beauty<br>I forget the the list but it it includes<br>it's a quite diverse list of different<br>Southeast Asian languages but also<br>people from Europe East Asia the south<br>then uh we have a description of this<br>um of Kaki herself so Kaki is the<br>consort of the game and these detailed<br>descriptions of the beauty of particular<br>Heroes and heroines is again a staple<br>feature of poetry including poetry<br>explicitly framed as Buddhist of this of<br>this period so uh his deer concert was<br>named<br>fairer than any in the land no girl<br>could match her fine Beauty she was the<br>queen of womankind her birth was a pure<br>Miracle as the first fourth from a Lotus<br>so again this way in which Buddhist<br>images of Purity are tied into uh<br>presentation of the Aesthetics of<br>physical Beauty her face gleamed<br>brighter than the moon her hair darker<br>than a black Bee's stripe her forehead<br>glowed like<br>is a ritual object that's made out of<br>Polish metal and is passed around<br>particularly in ceremonies connected to<br>prolonged to these Spirits or Juan but<br>usually but well in uh my literature<br>translated from Thai is translating the<br>word when when in the sense of mirror<br>to like a reflecting glass so I think<br>that's possibly here why it has This<br>this term because like a mirror it would<br>reflect clear and complexion full of<br>charm<br>um her smile bloomed and effortless<br>Bliss her lips were full her words win<br>some and then it continues to go<br>throughout her whole uh body describing<br>all the ways in which it's uh beautiful<br>and captivating her neck her eyebrows<br>her teeth her breasts her thighs every<br>um<br>and it it goes into some detail around<br>how how joyful this Union including the<br>sexual Union between the king and his<br>Queen are<br>then we get this other scene where the<br>Buddha tabi the bodhisattva who's this<br>Garuda<br>um gets uh curious about this uh about<br>gets a chance to uh present himself uh<br>to the king and uh the king is delighted<br>come here my lab come here my friend and<br>that they begin to play this game of<br>dice so it's this gambling game that<br>brings the Buddha to be and the King<br>together in this story<br>um<br>and then we have uh just the last part<br>I'll bring out in this story at that<br>moment when uh got the the former lady<br>in the court as the afternoon gave way<br>to dusk was looking for her happy King<br>for he had not yet returned to take his<br>place on their shared bed the most<br>auspicious spot of all so she called out<br>and asked<br>where has this ladies of the Harem where<br>is my Lord where is his majesty gone and<br>they say that you know he's he's playing<br>now with this his this handsome youth in<br>other words the Buddha has transformed<br>himself from a Garuda into the form of<br>like handsome Youth and he's incredibly<br>beautiful no one can compare with him so<br>her Curiosity has peaked and goes to<br>take a glance at what's happening<br>she stopped to catch a glimpse<br>of the garuda's body and fell in love<br>her heart filled with such excitement to<br>take that Birdman as her mate the Garuda<br>still playing with the King happened to<br>glance towards gaki and felt the thrill<br>of Love arise delighting and desires<br>Rush silently he thought how stunning is<br>that lady this is what is called Beauty<br>I'm overwhelmed by my good fortune for<br>the girl who compare with her this is<br>charm this is Elegance a match to her<br>could never be found I've seen many<br>beings in the world but never a lady as<br>lovely as her even the angels in the<br>heavens couldn't match the girl before<br>me not one blemish could be found upon<br>her resplendent body<br>and the emphasis this constant emphasis<br>on Purity and Shining unrespondence is<br>echoed in the description of Buddhas and<br>Buddha images as well as these Heroes<br>and heroines alike there's a certain set<br>of vocabulary terms that are invoked in<br>both cases<br>um and and without seeing what<br>particular pronouns are being used or<br>who is being the subject of the<br>description as sometimes it's hard to<br>tell is this description of a particular<br>character is this a description of of<br>the who glows in these particular ways<br>and so then he he falls in love asks for<br>Kaki she caught the guru just staring at<br>her body she smiled coily and looked at<br>him from the corners of her eyes Fanning<br>the Flames of his love<br>whenever the Garuda lock dies with her<br>she giggled and smiled and Shrugged it<br>off and fruit of Joy she shot him<br>glances and flashed him a secret smile<br>seeing all this his skin tingled and his<br>belly leaped into his chest lost in love<br>dice gave him no relief he thought only<br>of caramel Bliss he turned away to focus<br>on the game and turned back stealing a<br>gander he peeked for a sideways glance<br>his eyes never tiring of her sight she<br>feigned a fall then her sash slipped<br>down from her shoulder revealing a<br>breast<br>his heart quavered stirred by the thrill<br>so again we have this some of the same<br>verbs that are used in the context of<br>some Vega which literally has the sense<br>of being shaken of being moved of<br>quivering inside appears in these erotic<br>scenes as well aroused long to ravisher<br>and almost rush to embrace her and whisk<br>her away at once but realizing his<br>repute would suffer rested himself back<br>okay<br>so I have one more text that I'd like to<br>take us through that's a meditation text<br>that deals with<br>some of the same kind of imagery that<br>we've seen throughout in these different<br>Reflections or facets of pleasure in<br>homes that are explicitly framed as<br>Buddhist texts in Southeast Asia but<br>before we get there I just want to pause<br>to have a sip of water and ask if you<br>have any questions or things you're<br>I could offer anyone here a couple of<br>time going to get a cup of tea would<br>anyone like one<br>I stood down I'm just and those of you<br>on Zoom please treat yourself sorry we<br>it's actually really interesting that<br>I'm doing with this poem tell us more<br>well I'm just thinking I mean<br>I guess Kings have lots of spare time so<br>cultivate themselves yes<br>yeah so he wrote this uh the story<br>doesn't end there it says to win the<br>game yeah yes yes you know it's<br>obviously that's like the um<br>yeah but um but he also did that<br>cremation poem<br>tells them to scatter his corpse<br>in the forest that must have been an<br>interesting person<br>so in the the sort of contemporary<br>perspective of looking back on undoing<br>he's often credited with like this<br>restoration of Cambodian artistic and<br>literary and religious Traditions after<br>a period of Siamese domination so that's<br>you know referring to the time in which<br>he ascends the throne<br>some sources put that at 1848 he ran to<br>about 1860.<br>but this is it's interesting this early<br>period he had time it seems to you know<br>craft this is just a maybe I forget it's<br>a sixth or fifth or so of the whole the<br>whole poem<br>um<br>but to create you know have time to work<br>in literature yeah<br>um obviously well educated was it he was<br>our Davis was he told me it's pretty<br>early<br>but he was ordained by um<br>yeah<br>with<br>the crowd that he's working on yes so he<br>was ordained yeah yeah<br>and was instrumental in sort of the rise<br>of some like Thomas in bringing the uh<br>something that you would order uh to<br>Cambodia in the<br>most of the Buddhist poetry in camera<br>so<br>where is where they are records it's<br>it's in the manuscript or the printed<br>oh it depends so almost all of the texts<br>that we've looked at today<br>um and actually throughout that have<br>been in Khmer uh there are manuscript<br>sources for them but there are also<br>print sources so<br>um in some cases in my translations I<br>was working from manuscripts like in the<br>case of Paris<br>in other cases like in this<br>I was working from a printed text but<br>there are plenty of manuscripts that<br>yeah so just like in the case of<br>Thailand and in a sort of analogous to<br>the sort of the long the process by<br>which tax written and uh no and also in<br>literary synthetic where either trans<br>transliterated into oatmeal or Roman<br>script Vietnamese or translated from<br>literary synthetic into Vietnamese that<br>was taking place<br>end of 19th century first half of the<br>20th century<br>most intensive period of that also if we<br>think in the Thai context the way in<br>which towards the end of the 19th<br>century beginning the 20th century there<br>was an effort to to gather uh literary<br>texts that were preserved in manuscript<br>form and then publish them and make them<br>available that's sort of the ongoing<br>work of uh Chrome Seton the fine arts<br>department among the other things they<br>do and also the work of the National<br>Library<br>um similarly in the Cambodian case uh<br>publications of these Works began<br>actually at the end of the 19th century<br>with some Publications first printed in<br>France or Vietnam and whoever they were<br>printing presses available but then<br>recently and no no yeah some of the<br>earliest ones and then eventually in<br>Cambodia Itself by the the 20s and 30s<br>so that's the pattern we see but not<br>everything that's represented in a print<br>Source<br>um is<br>there are abundant manuscript sources so<br>some things have been because so many<br>manuscripts have been lost and get money<br>particularly 1970 and 1990 sometimes the<br>print sources are extremely valuable in<br>other cases there's a whole bunch of<br>material particularly more explicitly<br>Buddhist material that never made it<br>into print<br>basically all the sermon and ritual<br>material and manuals none of that was<br>ever printed so it only exists in<br>manuscript form but the literate many of<br>the most prized literary texts did end<br>up being printed during the 20th century<br>it looks like this was on the Royal<br>cross some of his stuff was in the Royal<br>Chronicles<br>hmm<br>just looking at this Chandler article<br>which might not be Polaris to it because<br>it was so old<br>but so that it would have gotten<br>included in the Royal Chronicles about<br>solitaire<br>um do you know okay oh you found a<br>printed version<br>but it didn't say anything about Royal<br>Chronicle p 63.<br>Chronicle<br>before but it wouldn't have unclean's<br>poem so the in some versions of the<br>royal Chronicles there are some literary<br>references to literary attacks the<br>composition of lyric texts uh there are<br>um<br>yeah I don't know interesting it's an<br>interesting question you just made me<br>realize I have no idea where this stuff<br>comes from<br>re-topied in 1951 and 1971 at the<br>Buddhist Institute<br>yes so these uh Chronicles concerning<br>the remains yes so these Chronicles<br>particularly the ones uh that were<br>edited by consult<br>um uh to those that are like those<br>um ruins like other kinds of Royal<br>Chronicles that were copied and<br>preserved in monastic libraries and also<br>preserved in Royal collections the same<br>goes for these kind of literary texts<br>they were preserved at monastic<br>libraries and copied in manuscript form<br>and also within Elite collections<br>connected with the aristocracy and the<br>foreign<br>other questions or things you're<br>so is he coming back<br>is<br>I'm just thinking like you know<br>sometimes have you ever found the MCC<br>abled MCC microphone<br>Olivia keeps dribbling that sound but<br>no I haven't got the actual microphone<br>the rumors they're in France<br>um have you read this room yet uh okay<br>so I keep asking and then sometimes you<br>just wonder if they're not tucked away<br>and so suck me is sitting on them like<br>waiting you know<br>okay no I've just seen the things that<br>have been published yeah<br>collection so apparently right before<br>the war all the microfilms<br>disappeared<br>and then some people say the Vietnamese<br>stolen and some people<br>because nobody's gone into the basement<br>you think the Vietnamese are enough for<br>them<br>I'm just thinking so I'm just wondering<br>about circling back to some of the big<br>questions you start<br>Ed let's do this yeah<br>lots of not to uh but<br>um<br>you know the beginning of the week you<br>you posed the question about you know<br>what makes poetry or what what what<br>constitutes first so what are these<br>unique features or how are we to okay<br>should we how are we to single it out<br>sort of literary Corpus putting aside<br>for the moment I think the question of<br>what constitutes a Buddhist text or not<br>yeah<br>um I just wonder if people have ended up<br>somewhere else you know<br>um<br>with some of one of some of these<br>I mean if it's in the Royal Chronicle is<br>it a poem well yeah I mean that's that's<br>a kind of interesting version of it<br>exactly that that is there<br>are we just speaking about<br>form in other words a certain<br>symmetrical features and<br>um phonic patterns and all the rest of<br>it or is there some something beyond<br>that or<br>um and that sort of reminds me of the<br>question that Eric asked for us it's<br>like is there a difference between<br>Buddhist poetry and Buddhist verse<br>exactly yeah yeah yeah<br>yes Eric do we press Qs work something<br>very interesting does poetry count Eric<br>writes as a genre of literature<br>oh sorry<br>forgive me uh does poetry as a genre of<br>literature address or grapple with the<br>Buddhist doctrinal issues that you have<br>foregrounded in these last three<br>lectures deadedness shock pleasure and<br>this distinctly different way that would<br>be the case in other literary genres<br>commentaries so those birth stories<br>Chronicles higiographies Etc<br>which is to say are these doctrinal<br>themes unpacked or expanded upon in<br>particularly unique directions when<br>mediated through poetic verse yes so for<br>instance themes around uh indebtedness<br>to parents is and as well as to other<br>particular beings is one that we see<br>most emphasized actually in poetry in<br>terms of written texts that survive as<br>commentaries or first stories Chronicles<br>all the manuals all the other kinds of<br>genres that one might imagine<br>and so that link I think is surprised me<br>it's one of the one of the reasons I<br>wanted to talk about indebtedness and<br>these kinds of poems and books of poems<br>that are all about indebtedness to<br>parents gratitude to parents uh show up<br>in the means and Thai and Lao and<br>Cambodian but it's kind of it's very<br>easy in a contemporary Buddhist<br>bookstore in those particular cultural<br>contexts to find all kinds of new books<br>that are coming out all the time that<br>have poems that people are composing<br>today on those very themes I think the<br>same thing goes for this this theme of<br>shock though this appears in other texts<br>as well it gets particularly emphasized<br>in poetry particularly poetry recited<br>for funerals or for end of life context<br>why it shows up more there and less in<br>the sermon literature that gets<br>transmitted in Mainland southeast Asia<br>as a as a question for me but I think<br>it's about the particular aesthetic<br>vehicle of poetry particularly poetry<br>that's meant to be recited is sung or<br>otherwise put into a Sonic space that<br>works well with the<br>questions of gratitude questions of<br>somewega uh questions of these<br>narratives of mourning that are often<br>tied to both of those uh in terms of<br>even the theme that we explored today<br>around uh pleasure and the different<br>forms of pleasure<br>I think we see this again most<br>emphasized in the poetic context and<br>it's where we see this shading between<br>texts that are end up framed in very<br>explicitly Buddhist ways but end up<br>being uh going quite deeply into<br>the aesthetic beauty of particular<br>the the theme we looked at sort of more<br>early on around aspiration and benefits<br>that's not particularly limited to<br>poetry that we see in all kinds of other<br>different genres but I'm curious now in<br>thinking about the way you frame the<br>question whether we might also be able<br>to say that something distinctive is<br>going on when things are in a form of<br>first and John Marston writes I guess<br>one way of formulating the question<br>would be whether there was a general<br>conception of poetry other than the<br>specific meters being used and this in<br>terms of just thinking about the words<br>that are uh used<br>it's<br>sometimes it's possible<br>um to find<br>we see a bit of both<br>um Let me let me back up<br>in<br>late 19 in late 19th century<br>Thailand Laos and Cambodian through the<br>middle of the 20th century there was a<br>real interest in trying to catalog and<br>name and determine the limits of<br>particular first forms yeah<br>um I don't know about the parallel case<br>in uh in Vietnam you mean vernacular<br>verse 4. particularly vernacular<br>response but there was also an interest<br>in tying those vernacular verse forms<br>back to the kinds of works of meter in<br>Pali in some case Sanskrit sources as<br>well so there was a renewed interest in<br>texts like the yeah<br>um Polytech sun on metrical forms and<br>trying to understand those in that<br>context of course there were other<br>periods particularly in Thai literary<br>history if one looks at uh textbooks<br>like the denominy the attempt to catalog<br>verse forms and ways if one looks even<br>what the slide we have up here now this<br>is an early 19th century example to<br>catalog and put in stone all of the<br>different verse forms but it's a way of<br>which somehow during this period there<br>was an interest of defining uh poetry as<br>consisting in particular meters and that<br>being the definition of poetry so that<br>then that's that's a quote Elite<br>definition of that's you know like a<br>caveat type definition of poetry which<br>in a way I I I I I'm sorry to jump in<br>here but I just I think John's question<br>is an important one in a way which in<br>what way is your think is this thinking<br>or these as these as example of poetry<br>do they overflow or expand beyond the<br>kavia-like kind of restrictive more<br>restrictive understandings very much<br>Elite understandings of poetry if as you<br>say there's I mean it sounds like what<br>you're saying is there is an attempt to<br>deliberately map these forms of<br>vernacular poetry onto a kind of<br>um<br>again this word Elite's not great but<br>you know<br>um certain<br>uh<br>forms of certain metrical patterns that<br>have a certain kind of status within the<br>you know historic the I guess the high<br>Traditions absolutely the southeast Asia<br>so to an extent I guess<br>so there's a really you elegant way of<br>asking the question to what extent do<br>you think these poet poetic examples are<br>examples of that or something that<br>extends beyond that something that wants<br>to embrace that wants to have a kind of<br>a folks poetry you know yes yes yeah so<br>many of the examples particularly on the<br>days who looked at debt and shock were<br>coming from non-elite examples yeah uh<br>unlike today this we're looking more at<br>Elite examples in this context<br>the the broad point that I think is<br>interesting to consider here in the the<br>late Peter correct in some of his<br>um yet unpublished work has argued that<br>in the case of Lao poetry this 20th<br>century<br>um perspective of trying to make Lao<br>poetry fit into these uh particularly<br>categorizable metrical forms something<br>that that they were getting from similar<br>developments in the in Thai literary<br>studies at the period<br>is does a disservice to the Lao literary<br>tradition because it it makes it<br>impossible to see how the verse forms<br>um were actually used and appreciated by<br>Poets in earlier periods<br>so there's a danger when we take these<br>Elite definitions of poetry<br>as a standard on which to view all kinds<br>of literary production in Mainland<br>statistication I think that's very true<br>for the kinds of Buddhist texts in<br>Cambodia and Laos instance that aren't<br>always following particular Elite<br>literary conventions that are frequently<br>composed as acts of devotion like if we<br>think of the the one poem we looked at<br>by who was giving the benefits of<br>reciting this the only example of that<br>survives it may have you may have been<br>the one who to write it down in that<br>manuscript and it's connected to this<br>very personal record of his life story<br>in other words there was a whole process<br>of composing and writing poetry uh that<br>was not didn't have any kind of elite<br>Ambitions or it wasn't aiming to be<br>spread over a broad area but was<br>connected to this very practice of<br>conserving manuscripts and of reciting<br>poems from them there's also a whole<br>oral Dimension that's taking place in<br>terms of many people are who are hearing<br>who are memorizing who are reciting<br>poetry themselves or not literate don't<br>care about the definitions of these<br>different meters for them it's what's<br>living it's what's uh happening you know<br>internally for these poems that makes<br>the Traditions come alive and I think uh<br>Buddhist poetry if to use this term uh<br>could have exists between these two like<br>spaces that we might exist a label as<br>Elite and very written focused as<br>opposed to places outside of that that<br>are engaged much more in the oral<br>performance and reception of the Poetry<br>yeah yeah<br>no it's just agreeing with you um<br>actually that it was two separate spaces<br>with some intersection in the middle yes<br>but but even between those two spaces<br>there is something which is distinct<br>from say poetry and I'm sure it<br>literally studies they must have all<br>concentrates like this side yes you know<br>like this I just want to say like I know<br>nothing about these debates but it just<br>seems to be that you know it's my<br>conventional crass understanding of like<br>how we think of poetry in in say<br>contemporary North America or New<br>Zealand is there something you know one<br>of the things that distinguishes it is<br>is this sort of idiosyncratic creative<br>act of individuals in which they express<br>a kind of inner sentiment in it while<br>also kind of maybe acknowledging the<br>limitations of of of language right and<br>so it's so however in in the two polls<br>that you've just identified<br>I'm you know the kind of elite written<br>um convention heavy<br>-like sort of style of poetry and in the<br>in the vernacular which focuses much<br>more on recitation of an already<br>existing poem that kind of expression of<br>inner sentiment up on the part of the<br>author<br>um that's really not there in either<br>side to my mind in the sense that<br>um what virtuosity in the first kind of<br>poetry is not the virtuosity as assessed<br>based on the<br>um its sentimentality or its kind of you<br>know ability to<br>um the purpose being to kind of for the<br>for the author to<br>it's part of the purpose that to express<br>their kind of inter sentiment but it's<br>not the the kind of main T loss of a<br>poem so where does that fit into this<br>and there's other and then Eric has<br>something here too<br>yes so let's let's<br>I think a really key question of where<br>there are the place of the author is in<br>this kind of place of the author yeah<br>yeah because so often in Buddhist poems<br>that part gets alighted or is forgotten<br>over time intentionally or<br>unintentionally uh but it's very much<br>tied to the authors if it's framed as a<br>Buddhist poem to the author's aspiration<br>to the set of prayers that they're<br>making around the composition and<br>transmission of a call there's also an<br>element in which the virtuosity of the<br>poet is tied to the recitation<br>yeah their voice the way they use and<br>put it into a melodic form some some<br>forms are connected to also playing a<br>musical instrument at the same time and<br>those are also forms in which one is<br>expected to not just recite an<br>established poem but also would be<br>changing it would be improvising certain<br>sections and that bardic tradition is<br>intersects a little bit with Buddhist<br>ideas as well so to make sure we catch<br>the different comments that have been<br>made in the chat so does it make sense I<br>think this is Eric writing uh to think<br>about poetry as genre versus poetry as<br>aesthetic form technique I think it does<br>I mean in contemporary<br>um<br>Southeast Asian<br>sort of yeah<br>ways of discussing poetry in a literary<br>study sense there's always<br>general terms they're used like uh go<br>away<br>context that are designed to talk about<br>poetry in general as a genre<br>as opposed to uh poetry as particular<br>kinds of techniques or forms or readers<br>but as you raise this other important<br>question does this distinction apply in<br>the Southeast Asian poly slash<br>vernacular<br>terravata world<br>yes I mean I think it's operating but I<br>think the question to which it's<br>operating historically is one that I'd<br>be curious to understand about like<br>um<br>what that yeah what what that would mean<br>my my sense is for instance in the Lao<br>context that the evidence we have<br>further back in time suggests that<br>people talked about different<br>performative genres in other words poems<br>that were to be recited in different<br>styles or by different groups of people<br>in a different contexts that's how<br>different genres were defined not by the<br>meter and not by a general sense of<br>something being defined as poetry and<br>then what happens in a modern context is<br>that we get the labels that are being<br>defined as what are the particular<br>poetic forms in a metrical structural<br>sense as well as this overall conception<br>of like Lao literature to make Lao<br>literature something that's legible in a<br>transnational context as well as an<br>aesthetic sense of well this is poetry<br>as a genre so that particularly in the<br>context of in being in dialogue with say<br>Thai or French<br>um poetic Traditions who sense that oh<br>well we too and Laos have poetry this is<br>how we might Define it but that elides<br>again something more complicated<br>happening over history Alexander uh<br>writes why is it necessarily to Define<br>poetry uh in a Buddhist context it's a<br>great question does it have anything to<br>do with the fact that it's content is<br>religious and I think this is the<br>questions that we began with like<br>there's a certain possibilities that are<br>engendered by using these labels<br>Buddhist and poetry<br>um like for me<br>I like being able to make intersections<br>across Mainland southeast Asia so we<br>were able to think about these issues<br>outside of a particular National context<br>which is the primary way in which<br>thinking about literature in Southeast<br>Asia gets siled but there's also a<br>danger in that because both Buddhist and<br>poetry uh aligned so much of what's<br>going on and it's imposing a set of<br>labels on on things so I think we've<br>we've all been seeing the the some of<br>the dangers of the limitations of that<br>and Eric you write uh yes what of<br>ballads and other forms of oral poetic<br>verse in a folk or a non-aristocratic<br>register and this is again what we had<br>just frame uh had just mentioned are<br>these framed as Buddhist in any specific<br>sense by Southeast Asians in the uh<br>pre-colonial era I think again that's<br>really hard question to access but one<br>that I'd like to try to explore more so<br>much of the sources we have<br>uh pre-colonially speaking are Elite so<br>we get a vision of who was able to<br>afford a donation to be able to Iraq to<br>an inscription in the context of that or<br>who is going to be mentioned in Royal uh<br>criticular Traditions Etc uh and in that<br>we might be missing something but I<br>think what you mentioned about ballads<br>or other forms of oral poetic versus<br>really key for how uh poetry in living<br>performance Traditions the musical<br>instrumentation and the musical<br>qualities and also the context in which<br>they would be performed is a key way in<br>which these might be understood and<br>there it's hard to describe what's<br>Buddhist and what's not because so many<br>of those genres say and allow context<br>are ones that<br>might not be performed within the the<br>um the boseta hall within the most<br>sacred Precinct of the temple but could<br>be performed within the general<br>boundaries of the temple don't have to<br>be necessarily performed by monks could<br>be connected to Temple festivals and<br>fairs and so the gradation between what<br>gets labeled as Buddhist and and not<br>becomes very complicated in that realm<br>is the in in a context of recitation<br>what is valorized more if you put it in<br>terms like Fidelity to the original poem<br>or<br>um improvisation by the reciter I think<br>this depends on the particular genre so<br>there are a number of Lao and<br>Cambodian gems I'm sure there are Thai<br>genres I'm just not familiar with them<br>that are based around an improvised<br>often comedic or flirtatious repertoire<br>between uh several<br>um uh performers also the certain kinds<br>of<br>storytelling long stories like even like<br>you could be told in that kind of bardic<br>uh tradition but then it would be Beyond<br>poetry for you I want to say performance<br>still to me it's still poetry space<br>performance poetry you're saying that is<br>all length aren't you yeah I know just<br>thinking there's two marks some in fact<br>they go to the marketplace and people<br>beg them to recite yeah a poem<br>um so but it's not just reciting it's<br>just Beauty and the house I'm just<br>trying to think of the box that we're<br>putting around I mean because in a way I<br>pre-colonial well not so much that the<br>question of Buddhist which I think is<br>just<br>it's like this is<br>spirituality you know everything has<br>spiritual poetry like I mean once you<br>look at before the 19th at least in the<br>stuff that I do like asking the question<br>whether I was Buddhist is<br>there's no term right but the um the the<br>question of like I'm just sort of I<br>think I'm getting to your impulse here<br>which is that you do want to connect<br>things you want to open up a space of<br>inquiry<br>in inspect let's just maybe maybe we can<br>take it take a different project to use<br>a kind of an app with you know the app<br>aratic approach where we're like what is<br>it not so it's not<br>didactic as its primary purpose it's not<br>um it's not buddhavage you would even<br>to me the way I guess I'm defining it is<br>particularly un adventurous and that<br>it's that which is in verse<br>we're gonna connect Buddhist poetry is<br>that which is inverse and connected to<br>it's either framed as Buddhist or<br>connected to Buddhist ideas right that<br>including the verses we see in say<br>typical and all the rest of it oh<br>absolutely yes yes I was focusing on<br>this vernacular context uh because<br>that's those are the ones that most<br>frequently come alive in performance<br>Traditions<br>um and we're most frequently studied so<br>for instance in a Mainland Southeast<br>Asian context the great verse<br>collections of the levitica like the the<br>um<br>those were transmitted in manuscript<br>form but were rarely studied on their<br>own<br>with the narratives that go with each of<br>the 420 or so 123 verses at the time<br>about the those narratives were very<br>closely studied and of course the verses<br>show up they're studied but it's rare to<br>find manuscripts of just the Moolah of<br>the<br>uh and there doesn't seem to be any<br>tradition of reciting or studying those<br>of course many of the Buddha detects are<br>inverse some are also in prose<br>um but they weren't necessarily always<br>studied as poetry in that context so<br>linking a linking them making this link<br>between verse form<br>Buddhist themes and a performative<br>context seems essential to them yeah and<br>that's why I kind of focused on examples<br>that bring those three together<br>but it seems like the orientation toward<br>the performative context then is the<br>defining feature because if they didn't<br>I mean there is that yeah<br>irrelevant you know<br>what I think there there you're on the<br>most<br>I think that's kind of where I feel like<br>your heart might be really with this you<br>know the principle the implicit<br>principle of selection because I think I<br>think the explicit principle that you've<br>just<br>it doesn't do justice to the kind of the<br>Corpus that you're trying to call forth<br>into view you know yeah that makes sense<br>makes sense yeah like I don't think<br>anybody recites<br>and do insertion<br>anymore not anymore no yeah no so it's<br>not standing the test of time<br>yeah but there's also a way in which<br>these longer uh and more Elite kinds of<br>verses get transferred into a modern<br>like every great lecture series we are<br>left with more questions than answers<br>uh Eric Eric has<br>I think the performance is key<br>particularly in the pre-colonial era and<br>yet we have these inscriptions of verse<br>yes as as what Paul and in the current<br>Eric I thought we'd wrapped it up there<br>um I I'm just aware of the time and I<br>um there's so much more we could do and<br>this is a very you know this is<br>auspicious symbol of uh suspicious um<br>feeling at the end of a lecture series<br>but I just want to take this moment and<br>just to thank you Trent for really kind<br>of exciting and<br>I think for everyone here just totally<br>thought provoking and<br>extremely erudite set of lectures and<br>we're just so grateful for it and we<br>hope we can continue to have<br>conversations with you as time goes on<br>but um thank you so much thank you to to<br>all of you for making this this possible<br>I'm I'm so happy to have this chance to<br>be in discussion with you thank you for<br>being willing to bring in your comments<br>over the chat and for those of you here<br>in the room not just today but<br>throughout the week I really appreciate<br>everything that you've brought to this<br>so I've learned so much I'll be going<br>back to the recordings to listen to the<br>moments when you were talking and asking<br>questions I will recoil and at the<br>sound of my own voice but for those<br>other parts there will be much for me to<br>productively return to so thank you so<br>much thanks thanks so much everyone<br>thank you<br>I will<br>turn this up we all wait for all the<br>thank yous to come and then we'll speak<br>it in the recording so thanks everybody<br>and I will keep keep your eyes on the<br>University uh our Facebook page and<br>you'll see the links to these um<br>I was looking for meditation text that<br>you're</p></main><footer style="margin-top: 2rem; background: #0001; padding: 2rem; text-align:
