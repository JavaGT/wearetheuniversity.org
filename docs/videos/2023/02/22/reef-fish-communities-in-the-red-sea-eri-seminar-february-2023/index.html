Its reefs span 2,000 km along a strong gradient of temperature, salinity, and primary productivity. Yet, they support high biodiversity and endemism. Therefore, documenting fish communities is key to understanding changes in biodiversity. <br><br>Furthermore, temperature extremes natural to Red Sea reefs might inform how other reefs might respond to predicted climate change scenarios. I will present an overview of a Red Sea coral reef fish biodiversity and monitoring program, along with some challenges facing reefs in the region. This is a particularly pressing issue, given the rapid increase in coastal development and tourism.<br><br>Dr. Darren Coker works as a leading reef fish ecologist for the Red Sea Research Center, the Saudi Aramco KAUST Centre of Marine Environment Observations, the Integrated Ocean Processors group, and the National Center for Environmental Compliance. Using both traditional and cutting- edge approaches (e.g., eDNA), he documents the biodiversity and functional traits of Red Sea reef fishes.</p><h2>Transcript</h2><p style="opacity: 0.9; font-size:

ERI seminar today<br>particularly as we had to have a very<br>late reschedule because Darren got a bit<br>stuck<br>um because of all the Cyclone damage and<br>we're really lucky to have Darren today<br>so this is Darren Coker he is a<br>postdoctoral research fellow at the Red<br>Sea Research Center at cast which is a<br>King Abdullah University of Science and<br>Technology uh based in Saudi Arabia<br>Darren originally did his PhD at James<br>Scott University we actually were in the<br>same lab and I used to study fish with<br>Darren um and he was looking at the<br>effects of live coral and their<br>importance for Coral dwelling fish since<br>his PhD he's really branched out and<br>done a lot of work on impacts of climate<br>change and more importantly on ecology<br>and biogeography of refish and<br>particularly since he's been at calstr<br>really looking at the Red Sea<br>communities of refish so I think that's<br>what Darren's going to talk to us about<br>today I'll hand it over to you Darren<br>thanks Rebecca thank you good to see you<br>guys<br>um yeah so there's a few familiar faces<br>in the crowd but for everyone else I'm<br>just going to give a very broad kind of<br>overview of the Red Sea and some of the<br>work we've been doing there particularly<br>in refresh which is my background as a<br>reef fish ecologist<br>um<br>let's try and change slides okay there<br>we go<br>um so for those of you unfamiliar with<br>the area<br>um some from Cals which is the King<br>Abdullah University for Science and<br>Technology and this was founded in 2009<br>by the king at the time King Abdullah<br>and it was the University set up to<br>basically do science and technology so<br>some of these key areas where desert<br>agriculture solar energy clean<br>combustion materials and of course<br>science related to the Red Sea and so<br>the university is situated right on the<br>coast so most of the officers look out<br>over the water and this gives us really<br>good access to the marine environment<br>and<br>um and so I've been there for the last<br>nine years working as a reef fish<br>ecologist there and so one of the main<br>centers is the Red Sea Research Center<br>and then within that is the reef ecology<br>lab and<br>the lab sort of covers all sort of<br>facets of uh the marine environment so<br>we have a lot of work working on uh<br>megafauna particular the whale sharks<br>that aggregate there in the late summer<br>period and we also look at some aspects<br>of Fisheries some seabirds so we we<br>currently have a PhD student looking at<br>tracking and tagging seabirds as well as<br>Turtles and turtle nesting and then also<br>aspects of oceanography as well<br>so grid C is a long sort of narrow Basin<br>it's around 2 000 kilometers in length<br>and the width sort of varies a little<br>bit but overall it's relatively narrow<br>and then it has this very deep trench<br>through the middle of the sea there and<br>so the deepest part gets down to about<br>3000 meters and<br>it's also surrounded by dessert<br>environments as well and this creates a<br>very extreme environment and a lot of<br>this is to do with the the temperature<br>in Norwegian and so particularly in this<br>part of the world we we normally think<br>of brown areas over through the sea as<br>uh run off<br>um one of the unique things about the<br>Red Sea is there's very very little if<br>no terrestrial runoff so because there's<br>no rain there's nothing flushing out<br>into the the water for most of the year<br>every now and then there's some heavy<br>thunderstorms which will uh release some<br>water through the wadis into the sea but<br>we do get these large Sandstorm events<br>and so this is a large uh terrestrial<br>sort of input that we have periodically<br>as the seasons are changing<br>and so it's<br>it's an extreme environment and this is<br>driven by the water temperature mainly<br>so in summertime we have temperatures up<br>to around 34 degrees and in the winter<br>time in the low 20s and it's quite<br>uniform with dip so if you go down to<br>the deepest part it doesn't get much<br>colder than 21 degrees but the surface<br>areas in the summer is very warm and we<br>also get this latitudinal gradient and<br>water temperature as well so the<br>the image there with the red through to<br>the yellow represents the temperature<br>and so in the southern area we have much<br>warmer temperatures and then in the<br>northern area is much cooler so this<br>provides a natural gradient for us to<br>look at effects of temperature on uh<br>Reef communities and and Marine<br>communities we also have a similar<br>pattern in productivity so in the South<br>it's a much more productive area as we<br>get some water coming through the strait<br>at the bottom and bringing nutrients in<br>there as well as upwellings in that area<br>it's also very high evaporation rates<br>and this causes a lot of<br>um a lot of changes in salinity as well<br>so we have a gradient in salinity across<br>there as well and just a couple of<br>photos there the the top one is sort of<br>a standard<br>um photo of coral reefs uh in the<br>central region and so the water is often<br>very clear we often have visibility<br>excess of 30 meters and so those photos<br>here there's a diver sitting at 30<br>meters looking up and so you can easily<br>see right up and we have these very sort<br>of<br>um steep roof Reef fronts coming up out<br>of really deep water creating these<br>These Walls covered in Rich coral reefs<br>and the photo on the bottom is a image<br>from down the south in the farison<br>islands so it's a little bit more turbid<br>there and slightly different structure<br>um so it's known as a biodiversity Hot<br>Spot uh the reefs there are teaming with<br>life you can see a lot of diversity if<br>you visit any of these uh in short<br>offshore habitats and for corals there's<br>roughly around 360 species of live<br>corals there and there's also a lot of<br>indomism in the area with both inverts<br>corals and Fishes as well<br>um so I'm also part of a group that's<br>been putting out these uh structures<br>called arms and so these have been<br>looking at the biodiversity of the<br>benthic ecology and also small inverts<br>that inhabit these but sort of my main<br>focus and and why the work that I'm<br>doing in the Red Sea is based around<br>refish communities biodiversity ecology<br>and behavior and so at prison there's<br>roughly just over a thousand species of<br>fish associated with shallow reefs in<br>the region and this is quite high and<br>this is also always changing so as we're<br>finding new species this is changing but<br>not only that there's a lot of species<br>of fish in the Red Sea that look the<br>same in species of fish outside of the<br>Red Sea that are that we're now finding<br>a genetically different so this is<br>meaning we're having to update<br>checklists all the time and also re<br>reassign<br>um some of these fish species so<br>interestingly there's two photos there<br>are butterfly fish on the right there<br>over half of the butterfly fish in the<br>Red Sea are endemic to the region as<br>well and the other fishes the clownfish<br>we only have one species of clownfish<br>there and that is also endemic so<br>there's a lot of species that you come<br>across in there that you can't find<br>anywhere else and this is likely due to<br>changes in sea level through time that's<br>isolating the areas and creating pockets<br>of the for these species to change and<br>evolve<br>um the indomism and reef fish is also<br>very high so it's roughly around 14 but<br>again we're finding that this number is<br>changing too where we find some of the<br>species in the Red Sea are actually<br>different than the species outside of<br>um so<br>just when I moved so I moved to<br>Charleston 2014 and the year before that<br>this review was published by The Reef<br>ecology lab and this is kind of the<br>reason why I've been there so long and<br>what it showed back in 2013 is really<br>how little we know about the region and<br>so these figures<br>are all showing Publications through<br>time the green and the<br>um the blue one is the Great Barrier<br>Reef in the Caribbean so you can see<br>there's a lot of work being done in<br>these regions and the red lines along<br>the bottom is very low and this is<br>Publications in the Red Sea and you can<br>look at this through a number of<br>different different topics or taxa and<br>you can find the same Trend where we<br>just have very little knowledge and<br>this is kind of allow this is kind of<br>um<br>engage me enough to stay there for nine<br>years because it's really a black box<br>when you're there and when I first<br>arrived I was coming from the Great<br>Barrier Reef I was I was asking<br>questions that are commonly known about<br>the Red Sea and everyone was giving me I<br>don't know we don't know we haven't we<br>haven't looked yet so it's really in in<br>that period of time was understudied and<br>even now there's still very little we<br>know we're just starting to scratch it<br>some of these questions and some of<br>these topics and starting to put some<br>pieces together to be able to understand<br>the system as a whole<br>as a lab we've updated this so we<br>currently have a new review that's just<br>been written and close to being<br>submitted that's looking at what we've<br>done in the last decade as well as the<br>historical work for the whole Red Sea<br>region looking at spatial Trends and<br>also different topics as well but again<br>the trend is the same we still don't<br>know much about the region and also what<br>we do know I do know is often<br>concentrated in a few areas in the Red<br>so some of the work I've been involved<br>with since I've been there is one of<br>them was trying to really get a handle<br>on the biodiversity of reef fish in the<br>region so trying to catalog it<br>categorize it so<br>led by Dr Joey deep twister<br>sitting there in the blue t-shirt he's<br>currently the head fish curator at the<br>Sydney Australian Museum<br>and spend a lot of time up and down the<br>coast collecting fish using different<br>methods and all of these fish were<br>um were fin clipped so that we could<br>create a genetic library for future<br>projects and also go towards looking at<br>whether<br>um species were what we thought they<br>were or not and also<br>um<br>uh preserving some of these fish as well<br>so just give you a summary you can see<br>the first big bud here is the Saudi<br>Arabia collection so a large number of<br>fish were collected from there and<br>basically have a tissue library of about<br>10 000 fin clips from fish all over the<br>the various regions of the Red Sea and<br>we've also seen over 800 specimens to<br>the California Academy of Science to be<br>vouchered there as well so the the this<br>um also to try and<br>build on what's going on in this area<br>and also given that we have access to a<br>large<br>latitude of reefs and the Red Sea given<br>Saudi Arabia has a majority of the uh<br>the coast on the right there we've been<br>doing a lot of work I mean conducting a<br>lot of surveys with a colleague of mine<br>Alex guitar and so I've been trying to<br>build up an idea of what's going on in<br>the Red Sea what are the spatial<br>patterns the temporal patterns with fish<br>community so that we can start to build<br>up a<br>an idea of not only spatially but how<br>things are tracking through time and we<br>don't really have a baseline so<br>obviously what we we are collecting is a<br>shifted Baseline but it gives us<br>something to try and understand which<br>areas are potentially pristine or or in<br>good condition so so far we've done<br>close to 200 reefs from north to south<br>lucky we've been right down to the<br>Pharisee Islands early in 2014 because<br>this area is<br>um not really accessible to us lately<br>with the war in the South and<br>unfortunately we haven't been up into<br>the golf yet the Gulf of Eden right in<br>the top so we're looking to get up there<br>in the next few months to actually get<br>some some data from that region now<br>region right in the north is quite<br>interesting because there's there is<br>records of endemic species in that Gulf<br>compared to the rest of the Red Sea<br>um so we've been conducting standardized<br>for surveys up and down the coast uh<br>standardized debts and from these we've<br>been recording abundances but also size<br>estimates as well so we can start<br>looking at changes in fish sizes and<br>also biomass estimates and we've also<br>been selecting some of these sites as<br>long-term monitoring areas where we can<br>put down uh permanent transects and<br>actually go back and and map these<br>Through Time<br>and so what we're finding is that just<br>like some of these environmental<br>gradients we're finding some changes up<br>and down the coast with fish communities<br>and just you know roughly some of them<br>that we can show there is uh richness<br>abundance and also biomass and so you<br>can see with abundance it's probably a<br>bit hard to see there but the light<br>green one is actually very low compared<br>to the others and that could be<br>representative because it's quite close<br>to a major city coastal city there<br>whereas the others aren't<br>um and we can also see in the bottom<br>figure which is biomass there's some<br>changes with gradient and one of the<br>highest ones is the Frozen Island Frozen<br>Banks which is down in the central<br>region and while this tunnel looks<br>promising that it looks like there's<br>more fish biomass compared to other<br>areas along the coastline we're actually<br>Alex did some servos over in Sudan which<br>is in the red oval so this was directly<br>opposite and comparable and from this we<br>were able to try and see how close to a<br>pristine environment the Reds the Saudi<br>Arabian reefs would be compared to Sudan<br>and the benefit of using Sudan is they<br>don't have a large impact on the reefs<br>there through fishing they don't have<br>the the culture or the means to heavily<br>fish the reefs and so we're able to<br>compare the two and you can see very<br>quickly and easily from that that bar<br>chart there where the red bars uh<br>biomass estimates of a certain number of<br>key targeted Fisheries species that<br>there's really huge differences in<br>biomass between Sudan and Saudi Saudi<br>Arabian reefs and so even though this<br>region does have much higher biomass<br>than the others it's significantly less<br>compared to what we would we would<br>expect if it wasn't<br>um being heavily first and so this is<br>just one approach that we've been able<br>to use in the region it's very difficult<br>to get Fisheries data the Fisheries<br>um<br>is not regulated and not reported so we<br>have no way of actually<br>monitoring or getting catch rates or or<br>identifying what's actually been caught<br>so<br>this is one method that's showing us<br>that<br>um the reefs in Saudi Arabia are<br>actually potentially not doing as well<br>as we thought we're also starting to<br>look at how we can use the starter to<br>look at productivity as well so the<br>amount of biomass that's been uh<br>produced in different regions of refish<br>and we get a sort of a pattern where R1<br>and R2 which is right up in the north is<br>lower than the other regions and this is<br>likely driven by temperature and also<br>nutrients as well so as we go south the<br>water's temperatures getting warmer and<br>we're having more input of nutrients<br>through the strait at the south of the<br>Red Sea and we can also partition this<br>into different species and different<br>trophic groups as well when we looked at<br>that we found this was driven a lot by<br>plank tuberous fish producing a lot of<br>um and for those not<br>familiar with fish too much this graph<br>here basically takes the different<br>traits that fish produce and contribute<br>to an ecosystem so every organism within<br>an ecosystem is playing a role so<br>whether they are helping to remove algae<br>whether they're they're getting eaten by<br>other large fish and helping to move<br>energy through the food chain so we're<br>also looking at at instead of a species<br>level composition of refish what role do<br>they play what traits do they have and<br>how they how do those traits work<br>towards creating a healthy ecosystem and<br>so I won't go through this figure but I<br>just what I want you to take away from<br>this is that we can assign traits to all<br>these different reef fish we can then<br>put them together to see<br>um what combination of traits each<br>species of fish and then look at whether<br>these change in different regions or<br>different reefs or different transects<br>across space and we can see if some of<br>these traits are missing and so<br>um<br>so for example in the Region 4 we found<br>that<br>um there's a lot of uh functional<br>entities which are a group of traits<br>sort of put together are quite low and<br>so this is and represented by one<br>species so this also means that there's<br>a lot of vulnerability in the system and<br>so you have if you have one species<br>contributing a unique set of traits to<br>the ecosystem then if these are over<br>first and removed and and the number of<br>them or the biomass of these reduced as<br>well then it can have significant<br>effects on how the ecosystem performs<br>and actually maintains its role or helps<br>um so the all these these fish<br>communities that we've been looking at<br>up until now are the larger fish that<br>you can normally see when you're either<br>diving or snorkeling on a reef<br>um but we're starting to know that<br>there's a lot of fish that we don't see<br>on the reef so when you swim around<br>there's lots of these very small fish<br>called crypto bintique fish there's a<br>fish that don't grow larger than<br>uh like five centimeters they're very<br>hard to see they live within the reef<br>Matrix but we're starting to get a gauge<br>on the importance on the ecosystem as<br>well unfortunately you can't swim around<br>the reef and Survey these because most<br>of the time you don't see them so we've<br>been doing some collections with the Tio<br>sides to try and capture these and<br>actually look at the biodiversity of<br>these fish and also to look at how they<br>change through spatial<br>distributions and also their their<br>functional role as well so<br>we did a range of these stations along<br>the coast<br>um the standardized so we can compare<br>them they're all done with the same<br>method and this photo on the bottom<br>right shows uh a collection of fish from<br>one station and these stations are two<br>meters by two meters and we're basically<br>collecting uh every little fish that's<br>living within there so we have to do a<br>lot of rummaging a lot of looking under<br>rocks<br>um and we're finding that they're very<br>diverse so across these stations we<br>found<br>over 200 different species of these<br>little fish which is actually quite a<br>lot<br>um but the difficult thing is that<br>they're very hard to ID because not many<br>people know much about them it's hard<br>enough to ID the larger fish in the<br>region but these little ones don't exist<br>in<br>um in taxonomic books and so we did use<br>DNA barcoding to try and assign these to<br>a species level and again we had very<br>unsuccessful with that as well so over<br>50 of them we couldn't assign to a<br>species so there's a fish that visually<br>and morphologically we can't identify<br>them and also when we barcode them<br>they're not matching to anything online<br>so we can<br>see that they change through time uh<br>change to space so in the South we're<br>finding on average around 160 fish<br>within a 200 square meter plot which is<br>quite showing that they're extremely<br>abundant<br>um and we're finding upwards of 34<br>different species within a plot as well<br>so even within a very small plot on the<br>reef there's very high diversity and<br>very high high abundance these fish are<br>extremely important they have very short<br>life spans so they have very high<br>turnover they're also very important for<br>contributing energy through the system<br>so a lot of them if we think are feeding<br>on small bintech invertebrates and then<br>they are getting consumed by slightly<br>larger fish as well so they're very<br>important energetic connection to the<br>from the bintic environment to larger<br>fish<br>um you're finding very distinct patterns<br>in these as well so this Blue Area this<br>is a<br>multi-dimensional space the Blue Area<br>down the bottom is the farison islands<br>and we're finding very distinct fish<br>communities uh compared to in the<br>central regions and also cross shelf<br>patterns as well so as you move around<br>these these fish are changing uh very<br>com very much considerably<br>um and so we're looking to expand some<br>collections up into the north as well to<br>see how they change up there we have<br>done some<br>um some surveys and published these from<br>uh the large Lagoon system in the north<br>um and so one of the things we really<br>want to tease up with these little<br>fishes is what they actually do in the<br>ecosystem and how they what particular<br>type of role and then we can start to<br>assign those same traits and those same<br>functional<br>analysis to these groups as well to try<br>and build a complete picture because at<br>the moment we're just surveying mainly<br>the larger fish which is only half of<br>the the puzzle<br>um we're starting to try to identify<br>what types of habitat they depend on as<br>well so that we can see how Reef<br>degradation and and changes in the<br>um<br>for these we use a ethio side but in<br>other parts of the world or in other<br>systems you're not allowed to use<br>specific chemicals so we we're also<br>designed and used some of these small uh<br>sort of fish houses that we can put down<br>on the reef to try and attract these<br>small cryptic fish into them these are<br>standardized as well and then we can<br>replicate these through different areas<br>and so we actually have a this in a<br>publication which was just accepted<br>today<br>um and other tools that we're trying to<br>use to identify<br>um fish communities as with Edna and a<br>lot of you are probably familiar with<br>this particularly in the areas where the<br>water is murky it's hard to work in it's<br>cold<br>um there might be hazards in the water<br>this isn't really a popular tool in<br>coral reefs because you can quite<br>comfortably get in the water you can<br>snorkel or dive around and see what you<br>need to see but there's also some some<br>pros and cons in this and so we<br>published a reef uh a publication a few<br>years ago to try and look at how well<br>this works on coral reefs and also to<br>try and see if it's picking up any of<br>these crypto bintique fish as well which<br>we we visually can't see and so we had<br>some success so you can see the the<br>first bar with the little red fish that<br>grows to about two centimeters long<br>um it picked up some of the species<br>within that genus<br>um but overall it wasn't overly<br>successful and so we're working to try<br>and modify this approach so that we can<br>have a little bit a little bit better<br>method of trying to detect some of these<br>small fish using<br>um the Edna methods with water and<br>sediment<br>um and again we ran into a similar<br>problem with this method as we do with a<br>lot of the other work we do that there's<br>just very little on the the organisms in<br>the Red Sea so if we're comparing these<br>two sequences that are online if there's<br>nothing online then we can't match it<br>and that's really what we're running<br>into a big problem so we're trying to do<br>a lot of these collections as well and<br>get uh sequences up online to facilitate<br>some of these other projects down the<br>line<br>um and I had to have some butterfly fish<br>slides in here and so using a similar<br>approach we're trying to increase our<br>understanding of what some of the fish<br>are actually doing in the Red Sea what<br>are they depending on and so butterfly<br>fish are historically been used for<br>feeding observations so you can follow<br>them around you can see what they eat<br>they're very small mouths and a very<br>deliberate in what they are eating<br>and majority of them are either Corolla<br>balls some of them specializing on<br>specific species of coral and some of<br>them<br>uh eating a range of other benthic<br>organisms so as I said earlier over half<br>of the butterfly fish in the Red Sea are<br>endemic to the region and so I wanted to<br>document what the what the depending on<br>what they're feeding on in the Red Sea<br>but using a an approach that we could<br>sort of increase our resolution<br>um and so this figure here shows the<br>output<br>um with both co1 and 18s and the top two<br>graphs show the relative read abundance<br>of some of the sort of broad categories<br>of what these fish are eating<br>um and also and on the bottom is the<br>frequency of occurrence and so we can<br>start to look at what percentage of<br>their diet is made up of different types<br>of bintic texture but also start to see<br>what they're using and how how diverse<br>their diet is and this plot here gives a<br>really good good idea of the fact that<br>they're eating a lot more than what we<br>think that a lot of them have<br>specialized diets but also a lot of<br>overlapping in the diets<br>um but the majority of them are still<br>getting their diet their their energy<br>from uh hard corals so a lot of them are<br>hard coral feeders but they're also<br>supplementing these with a range of<br>other organisms like uh small copepods<br>Marine worms uh soft corals and and<br>other things growing on the hard benthic<br>environment<br>um one of the really interesting outputs<br>that I got from this is that we were<br>detecting<br>uh benthic organisms within their<br>stomach that have not yet been<br>documented in the Red Sea so given these<br>fish are swimming around and and eating<br>the bin thick environment they're<br>potentially a way of sampling the been<br>thick environment for us particularly<br>small and cryptic benefit organisms that<br>so these butterfly fish obviously rely<br>on live Coral cover for majority of<br>their<br>um their diet and when I first moved to<br>to Saudi in 2014 there was a lot of talk<br>about<br>how this region was pristine and how it<br>was potentially a a sort of study area<br>for future scenarios driven around<br>climate change because the environment<br>there was already so extreme we were<br>already detecting 34 degrees water<br>temperatures with the corals that were<br>still thriving and in very good<br>condition whereas in other parts of the<br>world when they start getting even to to<br>29 or 30 they'll start bleaching and<br>dying so it's a really sort of promising<br>idea but sadly since I've been there we<br>have had bleaching events and and a<br>considerable one in 2015. so in the red<br>circled areas the farison banks which is<br>a very extensive network of coral reefs<br>in 2015 a lot of these this area was was<br>bleached and subsequently died and so we<br>we did do some surveys uh post bleaching<br>and it's very sad some of the basically<br>documented up to 90 percent of the<br>corals had actually died<br>so this also shows that this region is<br>not immune to the effects of climate<br>change and that<br>um<br>and that we really need to start<br>thinking more broadly about this<br>um<br>is this common or not obviously as I<br>showed with the the status of research<br>in the region we don't really know too<br>much about the Red Sea<br>um so it's hard to go back and find<br>documentations of historical bleaching<br>events it's a nice paper published by<br>one of the postdocs in our lab Tom in<br>2020 where he took uh Coral cause of<br>some of these corals so it's kind of<br>very similar to Cinnamon claws except<br>you're drilling into very large Coral<br>skeletons that are on the reef and you<br>can take out these these Coral cores and<br>you can look back and see growth bands<br>relating to different seasons and you<br>can look for stress or or areas that did<br>right this is a figure here where<br>there's a small Arrow which is a a White<br>Band showing when there was a bleaching<br>event and so<br>after the bleaching event we had a trip<br>down to the farison banks region and and<br>um we clicked a lot of fish and also<br>drilled a lot of corals to try and look<br>at<br>um if we could put together some of the<br>history of the bleaching Moon and you<br>can just see by this figure that based<br>on what we found these bleaching events<br>uh a more recent occurrence and also uh<br>the more recent ones are more widespread<br>and have a significant impact on the<br>corals there<br>okay<br>um and I mentioned fishing as well<br>so these are this is um sadly one of the<br>biggest impacts to a lot of the the fish<br>so the coral bleaching impacts a lot of<br>the fish indirectly by removing a lot of<br>the the food that the Corolla balls the<br>fish that that feed on the coral need<br>but it also removes a lot of the<br>structure a lot of the habitat for a lot<br>of the fish and the fishing directly<br>removes the fish so<br>um at present most of the fishing in the<br>Red Sea is unregulated and it's commonly<br>done by small boats<br>um with one or two fishermen that are<br>using hook and line uh small traps on<br>some of the complex Reef environments<br>and then on the reflats are putting out<br>Gill Nets and so these are<br>discriminately catching everything<br>and sadly they're keeping everything as<br>well so when you do visit these fish<br>markets you can see a lot of fish that<br>are obviously targeted by fishermen but<br>you can also see a lot of fish that<br>aren't targeted by fishermen and<br>generally<br>um<br>generally at a lower value but they're<br>still being sold as well<br>and this includes all different trophic<br>groups so some of the traps will catch<br>Kerala fish<br>um or or fish that you can't catch with<br>hook and line<br>um and also sharks and as well and Rays<br>so looking forward<br>um<br>one of the biggest changes in the<br>regions is based around the vision 2030<br>of the region which is looking to<br>diversify income away from oil this is<br>just for Saudi Arabia here and so<br>there's some large Giga projects that<br>are happening in particular some of them<br>are right on the coast so if you have<br>some time<br>um later on I I'd ask you to you can go<br>to YouTube and look up neon or the Red<br>Sea development company and you can see<br>some stunning videos of what they<br>propose to do in these regions<br>um a very large in scale these ones are<br>all situated right on the coast Jason's<br>coral reefs or or um<br>and so this is potentially a large sort<br>of change to the system and they have<br>they have said that they want to try and<br>work with the environment and to try and<br>sustain the environment and also<br>increase what they have there so the Red<br>Sea development company is a large<br>Coastal Lagoon there it's around 60<br>kilometers in length and they're<br>building some luxury tourist Villas and<br>sort of Maldives style tourist<br>accommodation and hotels and they've<br>working towards trying to have a minimal<br>impact on the region and they're also<br>looking at increasing their<br>um<br>the the biomass of refresh or their<br>coverage of coral cover by 30 so it's<br>quite ambitious they all these different<br>entities are working closely with<br>researchers at calfs to try and<br>um make these achievable so they're<br>starting to use<br>um uh technology to look at different<br>ways of outgrowing coral reefs<br>um they're setting up coral nurseries as<br>well and also for fish they're looking<br>at removing all the fishing or putting<br>some management<br>aspects into the fishing in the in the<br>region so that they can try and bring<br>some of the biodiversity and<br>particularly the biomass of some of<br>these fishes and a lot of this is in<br>their best interest because most of<br>these are driven around tourism and the<br>tourism uh people coming for the<br>environment so if they can increase and<br>enhance these then it should be more<br>beneficial from then<br>so there's a lot sort of moving forward<br>in this region a lot to to keep us busy<br>um<br>and at the moment it's it's very<br>exciting to be there we're still uh like<br>I said scratching what the surface of<br>what we know in the region starting to<br>piece together a picture of the<br>ecosystem and how it changes<br>um with that I'll take any questions<br>student rights and that big lower on<br>that central region let's get<br>potentially because<br>um some specific Target species are<br>being pushed for what is that in order<br>yeah that's that's a good point so all<br>of the different species contribute a<br>different set of traits to the<br>environment so it could be that the<br>environment is not<br>um a suitable habitat for that<br>particular species doesn't support their<br>their species in order to be there to<br>provide those traits or it could be that<br>the they're being removed somehow so in<br>that central region is close to Jetta<br>which is a very large uh city right on<br>the coast<br>um and there's a huge<br>uh Port there there's also a lot of<br>Industry as well so<br>um is potentially that the there's some<br>impact from those Coastal uh there's the<br>coastal work that's been done there and<br>the input but it's it's hard to tease<br>out as well yeah we're still trying to<br>get a handle on some of these traits<br>um trying to assign them to some species<br>is challenging and also trying to<br>understand the specific importance or<br>role that some of these traits Play and<br>play an ecosystem but generally all of<br>these<br>uh species of fish are there and I've<br>found some kind of Niche that they're<br>fitting into the system and in some way<br>they're playing a role that there is is<br>either a few species have or none and so<br>it's it's trying to identify which<br>traits are really important for<br>maintaining the health of the ecosystem<br>finding out what species are providing<br>those traits and then trying to trying<br>yeah it's a that's a good question some<br>of the the juvenile species of reef fish<br>have a very different<br>um needs compared to the adults they<br>often look very different they play a<br>different role they depend on different<br>food sources<br>um most of these cryptic fish that we're<br>collecting are actually<br>um fully grown at about two or three or<br>four centimeters<br>um so a lot of the juveniles of some of<br>these other species you can you can spot<br>them you can you can still assign them<br>to to a different group these these<br>little fish are not growing much bigger<br>than an inch but they're extremely<br>extremely abundant and and very diverse<br>so we do know they have they have very<br>high turnover they're they're only<br>living for a couple of months some of<br>them they're also recruiting often<br>multiple times throughout the year<br>rather than than one or two pulses a<br>year so there's a really high turnover<br>in them and so they're they're clearly<br>really important for the energetics of<br>the ecosystem but um we're also trying<br>to identify what what they're eating<br>what's eating them<br>um and and what other particular roles<br>the other questions from you<br>yeah<br>a little bit of<br>um<br>the Secretary of an issue suspicious<br>yeah I I asked that when I when I was<br>moved there<br>um<br>I would say I don't know<br>um<br>and there's no reports of it<br>it doesn't necessarily mean that it's<br>not there<br>um<br>and<br>there's you will you will see them<br>catching and eating certain species of<br>fish there in large volumes that in<br>other parts of the world people stay<br>away from<br>um so it it's hard to know no one's that<br>I know of has specifically looked for it<br>um tested for it and so<br>yeah I would say the answer is I don't<br>know that all we don't know yeah<br>no Charlie did you have a question you<br>can see you've got your hand up yes I do<br>uh great talk thank you very much<br>um I I have two questions well one<br>question really<br>um which is that um the warming<br>experiment it looks really interesting<br>it's probably the most<br>um I would say the most relevant system<br>to do that in the world and I'm just<br>curious<br>um you know what's causing that what's<br>what's the primary reason driving the<br>winter and summer temperature difference<br>is it because of the salt the incoming<br>solar radiation or is it oceanographic<br>uh hydraulic Charles um so you mean the<br>the difference in water temperature yeah<br>yeah because because if it's solar input<br>then the we wouldn't expect to see a<br>huge change with um with um climate<br>change but if it's influenced primarily<br>the ocean currents then then we would<br>potentially<br>yeah that's yeah so a couple of couple<br>of things there so there's a natural<br>latitudinal gradient in the temperature<br>so in the north the the water<br>temperatures are getting much cooler<br>um than the South and the south of in<br>the winter and then also in this the<br>South and the summer it's getting much<br>warmer<br>um as I mentioned about vertical as you<br>go deeper it doesn't get much colder so<br>it's quite<br>um it's quite well mixed and that's<br>mainly because there's not a lot of cold<br>water coming in so this uh<br>um<br>and then in the summertime so you do<br>have uh water currents coming in through<br>the South so there's a very very narrow<br>and very shallow entrance of the South<br>that you get some uh water flowing into<br>the Red Sea and depending on the<br>currents that often gets pushed up along<br>the right hand side along the Saudi<br>Coast<br>um but it depends on the different years<br>there's a lot of uh Eddies and<br>um a lot of wind driven currents as well<br>that that move things around as for the<br>water getting so warm in the sun it's in<br>the in the summer I would say it's based<br>on warm air and mainly because the air<br>temperature is very warm as well so it's<br>very hard to work<br>um in the field in the Summers you you<br>know everyone probably here likes to go<br>in the summer but it's very hard there<br>you have air temperatures of excess of<br>40 degrees and then you have water<br>temperature over 30 degrees and so it's<br>if you're out all day in and out of the<br>water you you're you're getting hot and<br>you're sweating and dehydrating even<br>while you're in the water and then you<br>get out onto the boat and it's magnified<br>again so it's very challenging uh<br>environment there<br>great thank you<br>I had a question of um no one else has<br>got me more<br>um thank you for including the butterfly<br>effect that was what I did my PhD on but<br>if I just<br>like it so specifically around the<br>butterfly fish but more generally do you<br>find that the ecological patterns you're<br>seeing in the Red Sea so like the<br>feeding patterns of the butterfly fish<br>or any other sort of large-scale<br>ecological processes are really similar<br>to the other major Reef systems so<br>they're obviously different species and<br>maybe slightly different<br>um Dynamics but overall are you seeing<br>the same ecological patterns we see in<br>the gbr and in the Caribbean and the Red<br>Sea or is it quite different like very<br>very different ecologically as well yeah<br>I I it's it's very similar when you have<br>even when you have endemic species there<br>they they they're obviously not found<br>anywhere else but they kind of uh<br>you know Sister species or very closely<br>related to another species that you'd<br>find in the in say the Great Barrier<br>Reef or the Pacific and you'll find<br>often they they play a very similar role<br>in the ecosystem and feed on Berry uh<br>similar types of uh organisms be it<br>macroalgae or pentec organisms and<br>so obviously they're playing a very<br>similar role but what they're actually<br>eating is probably quite different so<br>um if we go back to the butterfly fish<br>the a lot of them that are Cruella balls<br>are still getting I think like 90 of<br>their diet from Coral<br>the problem is that it's likely that a<br>lot of the Corals in the Red Sea are<br>endemic and so I think at present<br>out of those 360 species of coral in the<br>Red Sea I think only like four percent<br>of them are listed as endemic and<br>since<br>since uh researchers are cows<br>particularly Francesco benzoni have been<br>starting to look at Coral species in the<br>Red Sea they're finding that are not<br>what we think we've documented them at<br>so so many of their corporals are<br>turning out to be endemic a lot of<br>species that we thought were the same<br>species but look slightly different are<br>turning out to be completely different<br>species<br>um where even recently finding new<br>families or Corals in the Red Sea new<br>genuses so it's um<br>yeah it's likely that yeah they're still<br>eating what looks like the same kind of<br>corals but they're actually a different<br>species so<br>um<br>and<br>yeah it's it's just the more you start<br>looking the more you the more kind of<br>questions you have<br>um and with the butterfly fish<br>only half of them we can really compare<br>to other parts of the world to see if<br>they're eating the same thing but<br>um obviously they eat they're dictated<br>by Watson what's available to them as<br>well<br>yeah sorry just with that high level of<br>endiveness that you would look at the<br>corals do you think that that has any<br>um like this future scenario for other<br>regions of the world that follows also<br>something there yeah<br>yeah good question<br>um I guess you know first thing to mind<br>is oh you could take corals from the Red<br>Sea and start planning them around the<br>world obviously that leads to a lot of<br>problems<br>um but yeah people are starting to look<br>at why the red sea corals uh so<br>resilient<br>um but it is very complex as you know<br>with corals they have you know bacteria<br>and and<br>um Susan Kelly and all sorts of things<br>they work together to either keep them<br>happy or not<br>um one of the professors uh at calst<br>um is working with probiotics at the<br>moment and so there's a large scale<br>um a field experiment going on where she<br>her and her group are administering<br>probiotics to corals to look at whether<br>that helps or not during stressful times<br>so similar to humans wherever we can<br>take probiotic tablets or or drinks to<br>try and increase it in our system to<br>help us a little bit healthier or you<br>know shake off a cold or something same<br>sort of idea as going towards corals<br>where you identify their natural<br>probiotics that are beneficial to the<br>corals and then you can give them back<br>to them and in certain times of the year<br>and large<br>dosages so they've been for last year<br>administering probiotics to a ranger<br>corals uh on one of the reefs off calves<br>to try and see if they feel better<br>Through Time particularly<br>um over the summer periods as well so<br>one of the things I've been doing with<br>the fish is trying to look at how that<br>has a flow on impact of the fish as well<br>either directly because when you give<br>the coral probiotics a lot of the fish<br>are living within the coral directly<br>impacted by it but then also you know<br>the overall health of that ecosystem as<br>well so<br>um that's that's another angle to try<br>and to try and counteract that as well<br>yeah<br>we have to take last question and then<br>yeah<br>what do you expect in the next couple of<br>years will you come up with the entire<br>Newport or in this beautiful Grandma red<br>yeah so we have we have a lot of these<br>fish collected<br>um I'm not a taxonomist so it's very<br>difficult for me to go through them and<br>and identify them so<br>um a lot of them we did send to<br>California Academy of Science in the<br>hopes that these would be accessible to<br>the wider taxonomists and that they<br>could<br>um people in different fields could<br>access them and go through them so we<br>have had<br>um some colleagues around the world<br>access these specimens in different<br>groups so particularly the small gobies<br>where they're working through to try and<br>identify them and see see how they fit<br>in and<br>um we have either a PhD student just<br>started Victor he's actually really<br>interested in identifying a lot of these<br>species as well and then also looking at<br>how they vary spatially as well because<br>it's it's trying to describe it you find<br>them find two fish and they look<br>different when you're collecting them<br>and you start finding more and you<br>realize you know I know oh it looks a<br>little bit like that one a little bit<br>like that one and so<br>um trying to really get a handle on if<br>the the different life stages the<br>different sets the environments<br>affecting them the different morphology<br>um so it's it's it's really tricky<br>genetics is is we thought going to help<br>but it's actually making it harder but<br>at least where these these the genetics<br>from all these fish are now online we<br>also have really good images of them all<br>as well and then we're also preserving<br>all the specimens so<br>um<br>while we haven't figured them out yet<br>they're they're sitting there for<br>someone to to take the time to go<br>through them and um some people are Keen<br>to do that so<br>um you know so just give you an example<br>some of the small uh Coral dwelling<br>gobies<br>um we got up to like species 32 because<br>we we just kept finding more that we<br>just just didn't look like<br>um anything that we thought they were<br>and they weren't matching to anything so<br>again these could be all endemics to the<br>Red Sea<br>um and then that that sort of brings up<br>the question of what what corals do they<br>do they depend on there as well because<br>in other parts of the world sees small<br>Coral dwelling go these they're very<br>specific Coral species that they inhabit<br>sorry<br>thanks so much Darren we really<br>appreciate you taking the time and<br>coming across especially<br>um given your journey from October the<br>other day um and also just being in New<br>Zealand it's really great to have a talk<br>on something quite different to what we<br>normally get<br>um so as a token of our appreciation for<br>you thank you and um yeah thank you<br>everyone for coming along and thanks to</p></main><footer style="margin-top: 2rem; background: #0001; padding:
