and<br>possibly what time is it safe 7 P.M in<br>the evening dinner time in New York<br>so thank you for uh for coming and being<br>with us today so this is uh the second<br>lecture third lecture of the<br>thought-provoking conversation fast<br>forward series of the School of<br>Architecture and planning of the<br>University of Auckland organized by the<br>Urban Design Hub this lecture is<br>sponsored by Jeep who have consistently<br>professor at this product and training<br>at the University of Oakland and our<br>current director of the architecture I'm<br>in the live introducer the speakers<br>architecture and Regional planning at<br>the University of Pennsylvania and it's<br>currently a distinguished professor of<br>environmental psychology geography and<br>anthropology and director of the public<br>space research group at The Graduate<br>Center of the City University of New<br>York during her brilliant career she<br>received a Getty Fellowship a National<br>Endowment for the Humanities award the<br>fullback senior research Grant and<br>Guggenheim Fellowship for public space<br>research the interest in public space<br>has a tremendous breath and that<br>long-standing focus on social justice<br>democracy and social solidarity<br>she has extended extensively studied<br>public space in Latin America in Europe<br>and the U.S developing a<br>multi-methodization inquiry that can be<br>defined as comparative and conjunctional<br>recent books include the specializing<br>culture anthropology and City spaces and<br>security Mark McGuire and the why public<br>space matters which is actually the<br>title of Roberto today<br>is also a board member of non-government<br>organization City space architecture<br>organization that in few weeks will open<br>the public Space Academy an online<br>program developing collaboration with un<br>habitat group and haruk Foundation<br>why public space matters presentation<br>examines how public space contributes to<br>an individual and societal for<br>flourishing based on 35 years of<br>ethnographic field worker on Plaza<br>workplace Park markets and which is in<br>the United States Costa Rica Argentina<br>India Kenya and France it presents a new<br>understanding of a role of the role of<br>social contact public can mature an<br>effective atmospheres in the creation of<br>places essential to Everyday about life<br>the presentation emphasizes that<br>people's experience of representation<br>recognition of difference inclusion and<br>care as well as opportunities for<br>contestation and resistance if you<br>discuss case studies that demonstrate<br>how public space provides a context for<br>socialization and improves physical and<br>mental well-being by showing how<br>sidewalks parks and plazas offer endless<br>relational opportunities through both<br>form and informal activities that<br>promote a sense of belonging and place a<br>place of attachment as well as transmit<br>cultural practices overall social safer<br>will use this total advocate for a<br>realignment of urban priorities by<br>highlighting the importance of public<br>space for social justice activities and<br>encouraging local activism without<br>further doing get invite to give you the<br>floor to sifa and thank you in advance<br>for being available and sharing with us<br>all your understanding cancer in such a<br>short time that probably will make it to<br>happen we really Express the very<br>incredible complexity versions please<br>well thank you so much manfredo I'm<br>going to share my screen and<br>start my slide sadly I can't see you<br>um and that always leaves us with this<br>sort of strange feeling that I don't<br>know quite who I'm talking to but I want<br>to say welcome to those of you who are<br>here I'm really delighted<br>um that manfredo thought of inviting me<br>to speak in New Zealand um hopefully<br>someday I'll be able to do that in<br>person<br>um I am celebrating with you<br>um the suit my soon to be published why<br>public space matters book<br>um that was heavily funded by the fusion<br>for places and my University<br>um has taken over seven years to put<br>together and<br>um this is an attempt I've actually cut<br>it down quite a bit<br>um to tell you a little bit about what<br>the book covers and to offer us an<br>opportunity to think together about it<br>um<br>the I will hope to talk about of course<br>why it matters and what it is and then I<br>would look at essentially and I'll<br>return to this six contributions six<br>areas of contribution<br>um that probably what public space does<br>for us and this is just a drop really of<br>all of public space<br>um what it can do for us but it it's<br>particularly those<br>um aspects that I felt were best<br>represented in some of the ethnographic<br>studies and uh each of these<br>contributions will be illustrated by a<br>case study<br>um and um I understand that question<br>asking is not going to be so easy to do<br>so um if you have questions just I guess<br>email me<br>um so let's start what why does public<br>space matter maybe at this moment in<br>time after we've gone through covid and<br>here in the United States black lives<br>matter we know why public space matters<br>because we suffered so much when we<br>didn't have it but I'm going to talk<br>about argue that public space matters<br>because if public space is for all I'm<br>really talking very specifically public<br>space matters when it is for everyone<br>when it really does address social<br>justice concerns and I have been able or<br>I have identified three theoretical and<br>now maybe even a fourth mediator that<br>moves us from public space to its<br>successes contact public culture and<br>affective atmospheres and then I'm going<br>to turn to public space in its<br>contributions so why does it matter I<br>think we all know it provides an<br>opportunity for social interaction a<br>especially among people one would not<br>normally encounter or among people who<br>don't normally encounter one one another<br>this perspective highlights the value of<br>human connections and the importance of<br>protecting space for spontaneous<br>interactions and for problem solving<br>without public spaces people don't<br>necessarily have the opportunity to make<br>these unusual spontaneous interactions<br>but they also don't don't have places to<br>come together to solve the daily<br>um<br>excuse me<br>um<br>uh why does it matter the first<br>principle<br>um that I look at on how it matters what<br>it is that happens in public space that<br>makes matter is contact<br>UM Intergroup contact is an agent of<br>cognitive liberalization it's I know<br>we've always talked about contact that's<br>being in you know important but there is<br>an over 50-year literature<br>um and there was a review done in 2018<br>uh to explore this contact hypothesis<br>that interaction between members of<br>different groups will reduce Prejudice<br>and improve social harmony and this<br>meta-analysis of I think it's over 50<br>500 and some studies found that direct<br>contact<br>cross-group friendship even in direct<br>contact and simulated contact contribute<br>to positive outcomes and these kinds of<br>positive outcomes include<br>de-provincialization a broader world<br>view in ideology contributes to better<br>problem solving more flexible thinking<br>and creativity so it isn't just that we<br>say contact is important<br>um there is a deep now literature that<br>can substantiate it from psychology that<br>that that contact makes these difference<br>and that it is a liberalizing agent and<br>it shapes human cognition and experience<br>that operates in tandem with other forms<br>of liberal education<br>so psychologists say that contact is<br>good for much more than is commonly<br>recognized and is a and is basic to a<br>central theory of human psychology<br>so<br>um but<br>uh there's been a lot written about<br>contacting public spaces and criticism<br>of that contact in and of itself will<br>not necessarily create successful public<br>space for all again when I say<br>successful I'm meaning diverse socially<br>just space that welcomes everyone<br>um and so I have begun to think about<br>and theorize a second component that is<br>really necessary for us to have the<br>kinds of public spaces we want and I've<br>called it public culture<br>um it's probably not the best term but<br>it's the best term I've come up with at<br>the time that I wrote this book if you<br>have better ideas for terms I would be<br>more than happy<br>um but the concept of public culture<br>refers really broadly to the dynamic<br>negotiation of police values and<br>attitudes usually through media and<br>social practices<br>um that are defined by Norms of Open<br>Access I mean it comes from one part of<br>public culture comes from the idea of<br>the communication literature<br>um these processes of negotiation that<br>produce this public culture involve<br>conflict contestation and other kinds of<br>race class and gender struggle you all<br>know the work of Don Mitchell and all of<br>our critical geographers who've written<br>so much but it includes Community<br>Building collaboration and the social<br>construction of meaning public culture<br>is that which mediates the relay<br>relationship of the public space and the<br>public sphere in other words between the<br>actual material space itself and the<br>circulating political ideological<br>um circulation of ideas of<br>interconnection of symbols of people so<br>public culture is this intermediate<br>between the place the the material<br>instantiation and the circulation that<br>permeates the public sphere and one<br>might even argue that the more that<br>public space can Encompass everyone the<br>more the public culture will be able to<br>process and come up with sort of<br>temporary stabilization of of of of of<br>people's ideas beliefs and practices and<br>the more that that widens and opens up<br>the public sphere to other publics<br>encounter publics<br>and the third piece of I think the<br>puzzle is you can have contact<br>and you can have even the development of<br>public culture which in the book I<br>explained can develop over time is very<br>unstable always changing but has a sense<br>of solidarity at any one moment but<br>there's a third component uh affective<br>atmosphere that I think is also critical<br>to contributing to contact uh being<br>successful public culture of forming and<br>it's affective atmosphere and Anna<br>Barker and her colleagues who study<br>Victorian parts and leads were one of<br>the groups that have done research on<br>how affective atmospheres uh contribute<br>to conviviality and feeling connected<br>um<br>affective atmosphere excuse me a park<br>atmosphere of mutual affinity for place<br>you know it's like we all love this<br>place we all feel a certain way and it<br>creates opportunities for social<br>encounters and promotes indifference to<br>different which is what really where<br>we're going an affected atmosphere is<br>not limited to experience perception by<br>a group or an individual but I've been<br>arguing it's an attribute of the place<br>and I've been reading recently the<br>literature for those of you know the<br>French literature on Ambiance and the UK<br>literature on atmosphere and<br>um ambient<br>there is a quite now a thick literature<br>in the last I'd say 10 years arguing<br>that places have at have attributes<br>um that are shared among people these<br>affects travel it doesn't require an<br>event or social movement to exist though<br>events can trigger an atmosphere whether<br>it's positive like Woodstock or VE day<br>or negative like 9 11 or<br>um and shooting a shooting of Martin<br>Luther King<br>um let me give you an example<br>um in New York the Nate the Yankees are<br>a very important baseball team and if<br>you go to a Yankees game and the Yankees<br>win you go out in the parking lot can<br>you imagine how everyone is behaving on<br>there patting each other on the back<br>people in cars are honking people talk<br>to each other who don't know each other<br>there's a lot of conviviality and social<br>interaction<br>um going on but when they lose everybody<br>walks away silently that's atmosphere<br>and that's how atmosphere can in fact<br>make a huge difference in public space<br>um so it contributes to uh conviviality<br>and social interaction but I would like<br>to argue that without a supportive and<br>egalitarian public culture it's not<br>likely to create a socially just public<br>space I mean you can certainly have a<br>positive atmosphere and still not<br>necessarily have an egalitarian public<br>culture where everyone and can<br>participate<br>so<br>um this is a very crude model but it it<br>gives you some idea of the way I came to<br>think about this that every public space<br>has antecedents there's a history<br>demography government policy the<br>geography of the place the kind of<br>environment the amount of water the<br>et cetera et cetera Etc I mean that that<br>public spaces have all kinds of just of<br>attributes to begin with maybe aniseed<br>is not the right word maybe it should<br>just be attributes but then the piece<br>that I'm focusing on and trying to<br>demonstrate through ethnography<br>um is how contact public culture and<br>affective atmosphere work together to<br>create these public space outcomes and<br>you can see now I put social media in<br>there because I gave this presentation<br>just a week ago in Slovenia<br>a much longer version of it uh which is<br>why I've cut it down it was really long<br>um and I think more and more in most<br>parts of the world that we need to also<br>think of maybe there's a fourth variable<br>or a discursive variable because so many<br>people are actually going on social<br>media even before they go to a public<br>space so that there would be contact<br>public culture affect of atmosphere and<br>some dimension of social media anyhow I<br>haven't worked it out and I would be<br>really interested in what you think but<br>you know I I've written previously that<br>um discourse like how we talk about<br>public spaces certainly change how we<br>feel about them so maybe another<br>mediating variable is the discursive<br>practices whether they be social media<br>or newspaper articles about this<br>dangerous and dark place<br>foreign<br>but these mediating variables or these<br>maybe if you don't want to use such a a<br>quasi-scientific language these these<br>these components of what I think see<br>going on in public space are are are are<br>are part of what allows health and<br>resilience and sustainability and social<br>justice and creativity and social<br>cohesion and infrastructure<br>uh to to occur as outcomes<br>um and then of course what is public<br>space and I'm not going to spend much<br>time on this because I assume most of my<br>audience knows the answer but I do think<br>whenever we start this kind of<br>conversation what do we mean by public<br>or publics you know can a public exist<br>in the private sector does public mean<br>governmental or is do we and Haber must<br>argue the public is formed as a<br>corrective to state power and outside<br>the private or personal profit<br>modisphere uh what creates greater<br>publicness I think I'm finding more and<br>more and more and again in the<br>literature we're moving much much closer<br>to talking about the production of<br>publicness and how we produce it<br>um rather than thinking of public space<br>as something given and then what kind of<br>space do we include physical virtual or<br>imaginary spaces<br>um don't have time to talk about it but<br>I think it's a I think at this point I<br>really am thinking that virtual public<br>space and imaginary public space play a<br>role but do these same mediating it do<br>contact public culture<br>and atmosphere make a difference and um<br>maybe it does but I have mostly studied<br>uh physical and you know with just a<br>little bit of work on Virtual spaces<br>one outcome of my working simply uh in<br>this book in a chapter on what is public<br>space is I want to argue that I find it<br>much more helpful<br>um to get out of our conundrum of what<br>is public space what is publicness and<br>on is to really start with a<br>multi-dimensional definition<br>um I I uh imagine and I again I wish I<br>had another slide of this but it<br>um that that that that that<br>some spaces are large they're virtual<br>and physical aspects how big it is the<br>shape the location how digitized it is<br>or how technological it is and that<br>Publishers vary and ownership is it<br>public limited partnership public<br>private private that what's the<br>authority that runs it is it a bid<br>homeowners association a common interest<br>development an NGO<br>um and what forms of control and<br>influence<br>um then does that governance Agency use<br>as it rules and regulation are they<br>strict to lenient it's access open or<br>closed is there cost is there fencing<br>etc etc but there's also the symbolic<br>and hor uh historic meaning of the space<br>is there representation and recognition<br>is there are there a lot of uh<br>historical uh representations or or<br>contemporary representations that would<br>encourage people to come in<br>um can political activity be is it<br>possible or is it prohibited and um and<br>the final idea was is are there aspects<br>of civil society that can happen there<br>is it an informal forum for ideas all<br>the way to not I I'm not going to um<br>belabor this but the point here is I'm<br>making is that it doesn't make sense to<br>compare all kinds of public spaces with<br>public spaces I think one needs to begin<br>to develop a much richer vocabulary<br>because a place like Central Park in New<br>York City that many of you might know is<br>definitely public it's owned by the city<br>but the governance Authority and it's<br>very large right and the governance<br>Authority however is a uh a public it's<br>a Conservancy<br>um almost the entire funding of that<br>park now is by the Central Park<br>Conservancy and control and influence is<br>determined by them so that they're very<br>strict rules in regulation you can no<br>longer have political activities there<br>the symbolic meanings of the space are<br>quite white in terms of the U.S<br>um context<br>um so it's not public in quite the same<br>way that Prospect Park is which um some<br>of these attributes are really quite<br>different anyhow just to give you a<br>sense that what I'm arguing is is in<br>terms of going forward I don't think to<br>think about public space just as one one<br>thing but to begin to pull it apart and<br>compare like with like or begin to<br>understand how these different<br>dimensions of public space work<br>okay so<br>um I can't ask you if uh if I'm going<br>too fast because I couldn't see it if I<br>couldn't see it uh<br>uh let's see so the zoom Lake yeah I<br>don't know how to do it okay will<br>someone tell me it says please ask<br>Professor to change the settings so the<br>zoom label will not all right I don't<br>know how if somebody could please send<br>me a chat those Zoom labels are driving<br>me crazy too and I don't know how to<br>to the side if you can just click and<br>slide it yeah okay yeah is that better I<br>don't think that's can I get it totally<br>out of the way how about I put it down<br>here<br>is that better everyone okay thank you<br>thank you to all yeah I it was bothering<br>me too I literally didn't know what to<br>do with it I apologize<br>all right so I'm not going to be crying<br>because it was just on the heading which<br>was always the same so we didn't lose<br>any fundamental information good anyway<br>it was I couldn't see it either so thank<br>you so much<br>um all right let me go back<br>no<br>there<br>um I'm going to look at six uh six case<br>studies<br>um the first three will be very Place<br>based and the second three will not<br>um I'm going to emphasize uh that these<br>are ethnographies and the reason that I<br>think ethnography is so important in the<br>study of public space is big is what I'm<br>going to show you is you can<br>hear in people's words and how they talk<br>about a place<br>um I think you can see the evidence that<br>of its contribution and I've had I've<br>narrowed this down uh you know quite a<br>bit so you'll just get a taste of what<br>the ethnography is and<br>um some of the dimensions of the the<br>contribution that I'm talking about and<br>um these are the six that I'll be<br>talking about but I just to give you<br>some sense so I'm going to start at<br>whether it's already<br>changing here which is Jones Beach Long<br>Island which is a state park that was<br>built in the 1920s by Robert Moses for<br>the New York City middle class and it is<br>includes beaches there's a bath house<br>there's a long Boardwalk there's a<br>marina it's a huge Park and it actually<br>was designed for the middle class and<br>actually in such a way that it was not<br>meant<br>um it was meant to exclude uh<br>essentially poor members of of society<br>Moses as we know was quite racist and<br>um was not particularly interested in<br>the urban urban uh people of color<br>coming after Jones speech but ironically<br>for um Moses who's no longer with us<br>um social inclusion belonging one of the<br>most important attributes of social<br>justice and Democrat uh democratic<br>practices is very very high that people<br>talk about Jones Beach in this way this<br>is America instead a man from the Bronx<br>at Jones Beach there's a friendly crowd<br>people are out with family and friends<br>it's a diverse place I feel welcome here<br>and that the first time I visited this<br>park with my wife a man originally from<br>El Salvador said I finally felt like I<br>belonged in this country we played in<br>the ocean with hundreds of other folks<br>somehow this made me feel special<br>so this gives you some idea of the power<br>of a park to to and and I have hundreds<br>and hundreds and hundreds of interviews<br>from there that say the kind of thing<br>but not only is there a sense of<br>belonging and and social inclusion<br>there's a recognition that not everyone<br>is the same which is another really<br>important dimension of social justice<br>um this uh one person says everyone<br>should have a chance to access this<br>speech there are lots of families here<br>it's pretty Lively everyone gets along<br>that's what New Yorkers are tolerant and<br>it says a group of young southeast Asia<br>Asian Indian men from Valley Stream<br>concur that the park is inclusive one<br>member says there are more brown people<br>playing ball and hanging out it's<br>getting more animated people do not look<br>at you just because of your color that<br>it's a place where you can go and be<br>yourself and be ready recognize this<br>different and still tolerated and<br>accepted<br>I'm just giving you a smattering of some<br>of the ways social justice I'm not<br>talking about I don't really have time<br>to talk about representation and<br>contestation and resistance which are<br>also attributes of social justice and<br>democratic practices but I I've also<br>selected out the ethic of care which I<br>think is another dimension that public<br>space offers and is important to a<br>social justice perspective and a member<br>says when you're walking in the park you<br>feel you are walking in something great<br>says a part goer describing why they<br>care about their part Advocates friends<br>and local workers have collaborative<br>collaborated to restore the facilities<br>that were part of the original design<br>and you can see people working here and<br>they have gotten together to restore the<br>West bathhouse and the pool I mean some<br>of this it's true comes from State money<br>but there are other ways in which people<br>show care they collect garbage they put<br>the garbage together other they share<br>all kinds of if you don't have matches<br>or you don't have something to start a<br>fire<br>um if you didn't bring up a bath towel<br>people are constantly sharing and<br>showing care for one another and for the<br>I wonder why<br>having a little trouble with it going<br>um the second example is this bridge<br>that you can see here in front of you<br>which is walk way over Hudson and<br>um probably be sustainability and health<br>and well-being right now are the two<br>attributes or contributions of Public<br>Health that I think we're hearing most<br>about these days probably because it's<br>actually measurable it's hard to measure<br>um uh social justice though I have<br>developed um I have developed a way to<br>but the fact that<br>Parks really are contributing to the<br>Improvement of health of people<br>in an area it's really going it's really<br>now being documented all over the world<br>and this is about a historic train<br>trestle it's between two towns<br>um one is Poughkeepsie this is north of<br>New York City and the other is Highland<br>and these were towns that are<br>de-industrialized towns with high crime<br>uh a kind of failing uh sort of<br>population is leaving uh very few jobs<br>um and uh Poughkeepsie is famous for<br>having an elite college but the the<br>infrastructure of these two towns has<br>been crumbling over the last 20 25 30<br>years even<br>um and<br>um this this uh restoration of this<br>historic train uh into a walkway has<br>completely turned around uh the<br>community in one particular way in<br>through the physical the way it in fact<br>attracts people to participate in doing<br>something about their physical health<br>and here's a visitor who runs several<br>times a week and she recognizes the<br>faces of other visitors she says it<br>motivates her to exercise to be on the<br>bridge to see the scenery she talks<br>about picking up the pace of a run when<br>she gets to the bridge because the air<br>is cool and the wind makes her feel<br>alive and another person says that she<br>says I love looking at the boats and<br>down at the water and the houses I love<br>being outside like this it's a backup<br>plan for not going to the gym sometimes<br>it's too nice outside outside and I<br>don't want to be inside so I come here<br>so that the bridge and the Beauty has<br>really encouraged and the accessibility<br>as you can see there's all kinds of ways<br>of moving across this bridge have really<br>made an impact on the physical health of<br>the community but it's not just physical<br>health it's also the mental health and<br>well-being<br>here's the middle aged African-American<br>man he talks about going to the bridge<br>as a means of preventing having another<br>stroke<br>um he says it's mentally therapeutic for<br>this for him he says the bridge is My<br>Sanctuary I love the water I don't want<br>to go in the water but I love looking at<br>it it helps me thinks it makes that<br>helps make sense of my life uh and again<br>people time and time again talk about<br>the mental health attributes of having a<br>bridge where you can go and see scenery<br>and be outside as well as the physical<br>benefits it also offers I mean it's a<br>really important space I think because<br>of a sense of security I mentioned to<br>you that Poughkeepsie and Highlander are<br>high crime areas<br>um they have actually a lot of violent a<br>violent crime more violent crime than<br>poverty crime<br>um somewhat unusual in that way and so<br>to have a place where there are types of<br>people uh this woman saying I think<br>there are types of people who just walk<br>here to have a peaceful experience and<br>to free their mind of whatever is on it<br>especially when you're working out I<br>think one of the reasons I come to the<br>walkways because I feel secure and I can<br>get lot in my thought lost in my<br>thoughts it's a very peaceful place<br>um other people mention the dogs and<br>that the dogs are so friendly and and<br>that's sort of a sense of security that<br>you can even go there and that the dogs<br>will allow you to be cut them but the<br>sense of security relaxation whatever<br>really contributes<br>um again to the health and well-being<br>that this walkway has offered and<br>finally and probably<br>one might argue from a community Point<br>of View Community Health Point of View<br>rather than at the individual level is<br>the sense of resilience that it has<br>created for this these communities<br>um one one visitor said uh you know she<br>had known that the the community worked<br>for 15 years to build this walkway and<br>she said Poughkeepsie is a place that<br>has been overlooked but democracy works<br>the people save their own great walkway<br>they honored it by saving it and a<br>younger Highland resident shares the<br>same sense of privacy said I used to<br>walk work at a outlet in Poughkeepsie<br>and I remember having handouts for the<br>walkway way back when they were making<br>plans to rebuild the bridge it's kind of<br>nice to see that all the hard work paid<br>off and just to give you a sense is that<br>um the the housing prices unfortunately<br>they have gone up<br>which is something I guess we could talk<br>about gentrification but at the same<br>time there has been more jobs incomes<br>have increased uh since the Vitality<br>people are coming from the city people's<br>children are staying in the community<br>and<br>um there you know there is a real sense<br>of revitalization so it's kind of<br>Community Health not just individual<br>health<br>there is there is some trick<br>okay<br>um Lake Welch New York so play<br>Recreation and creativity is a<br>contribution you would say well I know<br>of course parks are for recreation but<br>do we really think about<br>do we really think about how important<br>it is<br>um to have uh play and Recreation and<br>creativity for everyone<br>um and this is about a lake that is<br>um uh again about 40 minutes from New<br>York City<br>um and it's very popular with Latinos<br>both Hispanics and Latinos particularly<br>from the northern section of New York<br>um it's a major destination and when you<br>interview it's um interview people there<br>one of the first things they point out<br>and something I think we tend to<br>overlook and maybe uh under under value<br>or though we shouldn't is the<br>socialization of children so this is a<br>place where the Spanish language and<br>cultural practices give people a strong<br>sense of community I mean everybody is<br>freely roams back and forth people are<br>nice it says whenever I need a lighter<br>for the barbecue somebody lends me one<br>this is a place has many Latinos we<br>gravitate towards them when we hear<br>people speaking Spanish it's a normal<br>human reaction<br>um and then someone else says on the<br>Promenade he says I see families little<br>children young people playing games it's<br>a good place<br>um coming with family and friends<br>there's really only one day Sunday when<br>we can see each other and this is the<br>place you know where we can be together<br>a lot a few visitors said the exposure<br>to Nature was important for their<br>children While others thought that<br>there's a typo that pursuing their<br>recreational activities in a natural<br>setting had a particularly uh salubrious<br>effect<br>um<br>it's really amazing to watch the kids<br>um run back and forth between uh between<br>the sites and you know it's it's really<br>an incredible place and watch families<br>you know very fluidly uh admonishing the<br>kids to do what they should and and<br>again many of the interviewees really<br>talk about how important it is to have a<br>place where they're latinous or that<br>their culture can be expressed and<br>shared and where the kids can see that<br>there are other people like themselves<br>and feel part of this much larger<br>Community<br>um I think you'll see in this one a<br>relaxation of course is another<br>attribute of of a public space and<br>here's one woman saying one could get<br>the stress off by relaxing with others<br>here in this natural and highly sociable<br>setting<br>so this one older woman was sitting<br>there with many family members and she<br>was pointing out the contrast of the<br>environment and she said the park gives<br>her a chance to clear her mind<br>she said we like the beach<br>the water and we live close within a<br>room in cerados here we get to go out so<br>it's not just<br>relaxation but it's being able also to<br>just be outside to be together<br>um in an outdoor environment which is<br>not possible in the very dense fabric of<br>New York City environment especially in<br>a place like the Bronx which is a very<br>um and then of course reflection and<br>memory<br>um the park reminds many visitors of<br>their own childhood experiences<br>elsewhere and and it and so one couple<br>saying it reminds us playing outside in<br>Mexico when we were children and they go<br>on to tell me that<br>um you know they want to share those<br>experiences with their children and this<br>is the place where they can do so and<br>that's been true of so many public<br>spaces that I've worked in especially<br>working in New York where there are many<br>many many people from other places who<br>had very different experiences and often<br>those in very natural places rather than<br>in the hard Streets of New York City or<br>the urban Streets of New York City and<br>um really appreciate being able to share<br>those experiences with their children<br>um here's another childhood memory<br>coming here with my parents when I was a<br>kid on Sundays you know we'd have four<br>or five cars just so having all the<br>family together every Sunday knowing it<br>would happen was something to look<br>forward to<br>I think something that we forget is<br>um particularly for certain uh for<br>certain families and types of people and<br>I will emphasize those from Latin<br>America in the Caribbean and in many<br>cases African-Americans<br>um in the United States want to<br>socialize as families want to be<br>together as families and they have very<br>very large families I mean here at Lake<br>Welch sometimes 30 tables were brought<br>together so everybody could barbecue<br>together and<br>um to have the public spaces where this<br>can happen and have people<br>um uh you know it encourages diversity<br>but it also encourages and allows people<br>to be together in large family groups<br>which again it's not possible at least<br>in a very dense urban city which you're<br>not living in but I am here in New York<br>um another aspect of public space I<br>think gets overlooked I mean I sort of<br>mentioned that health and sustainability<br>are really important now but other<br>things get overlooked which is the in<br>informal economy and social capital and<br>this is a cartonero here picking up<br>trash and Buenos Aires from my colleague<br>Mario Mariano Perlman<br>but you need to remember that streets<br>and sidewalks and plazas and parks are<br>full of people working if you ask me<br>what the most important thing is and I<br>think globally not New York but globally<br>the most important part of public space<br>is working because sixty percent of<br>workers in the global South work in the<br>informal economy they need flexible<br>workplaces and they work in public<br>spaces<br>um uh you know the majority of the<br>population is working in public spaces<br>and they need to be able to to make a<br>living and support their families and it<br>depends on access<br>um and it and and public space allows<br>for a lot of flexible flexibility about<br>kinds so we have all kinds of innovative<br>forms of work I mean this is the<br>sidewalk Sidewalk Cafe in Burma Mia and<br>Mar if you prefer<br>um you know you see the sidewalk cafes<br>all over the world and these The<br>Sidewalk Cafe is the use of the public<br>space is a piece is how they make their<br>living and how actually it grows the<br>economy of the city<br>um but even in the United States public<br>space has become is very important I<br>would argue vendors which we're not<br>going to talk about public markets which<br>I'm not going to talk about have all<br>kinds of valuable<br>um attributes but public spaces often<br>where immigrant workers get first<br>integrated into the workforce the public<br>markets and these are day workers who<br>use the pub uh use the sidewalk to get<br>jobs each day in my neighborhood<br>um this is really vital to to their<br>making a living keeping a job and this<br>is true the world over and I've written<br>quite a long and extensive chapter that<br>talks about it and the other thing about<br>the informal economy is it's critical<br>after a disaster<br>um you know Puerto Rico just had another<br>hurricane but after Maria<br>places began so those places with public<br>spaces<br>survived better they were places people<br>who grow gardens there were places they<br>could sell there were places that um<br>could be adapted for all for a living<br>um so<br>they they the the informal economy<br>um part of public Space is really<br>critical in most of the parts of the<br>world really don't<br>know that much about Auckland<br>specifically I don't remember seeing a<br>lot of vendors on the street but you<br>know things could have changed and<br>um but in most of the world most of the<br>world where I live in uh through field<br>um environmental and ecological<br>sustainability<br>um I'm going to talk a little bit just a<br>bit uh I walked away from writing why<br>public space matters being convinced<br>that the greatest promise for changing<br>Urban environments or Urban Gardens in<br>public space I am absolutely convinced<br>that I can't do much about global<br>warming at a prac at a macro level I<br>mean I I can't make industry stop doing<br>what it's doing but I do know that each<br>and every one of us can fight much<br>harder than we have to to reuse the land<br>that we have in our cities for Gardens<br>that have both social and ecological and<br>water runoff and you know ecosystem<br>ecosystem Services uh qualities that are<br>critical to sustainability and making<br>our cities cities<br>um livable<br>um<br>but<br>um there are is a movement<br>um called the sustainable Parks movement<br>I is there one um Man trailer you can<br>actually hear me is there one in<br>Auckland do you have a sustainable park<br>I don't know<br>I will I will get back to you soon okay<br>you can add to that all right anyway<br>this is Dana Park in Paris<br>um<br>and uh it's um and anyhow there's been a<br>lot of research on this park and<br>actually Galen Krantz has done a lot of<br>work with Michael Bolin out trying to<br>look at sustainable parks to see if<br>they're really sustainable are they<br>ecological and sadly most of them<br>they're certainly<br>they use the language and they are<br>Greener and they do sometimes think<br>about water runoff but whether or not<br>they're truly sustainable or not or<br>whether sustainability has only become a<br>kind of metaphor or<br>um you know Brandy you know marketing<br>that's something she's skeptical about<br>but I think with time more and more<br>parks are will be sustainable especially<br>if we take an ecosystem Services point<br>of view<br>um I think we need to move away from the<br>term environmental sustainability and<br>think a lot more about<br>ecosystem services and really think<br>about parks and green areas as making a<br>difference so I am convinced that we<br>should indeed uh plant trees everywhere<br>we humanly can trees do an amazing<br>amount of work in a city and and parks<br>in our public space if we could green it<br>all uh tear up all the pavement you know<br>we could do something about runoff and<br>heat island so anyhow I am quite<br>optimistic that public space is one of<br>the important areas to work on and<br>sustainable Parks will become much much<br>much more important especially if<br>they're very large scale but ecological<br>planning and design which was very<br>popular when I started uh my work I uh<br>you mentioned I was in landscape<br>architecture I worked for Ian mccarg<br>where we planned Sanibel Island which<br>just had its Causeway blown down and<br>people got stuck on the island because<br>they over developed and didn't do any of<br>the things that we told them to do 30<br>years ago but you know that if they<br>ignore it but you know here's an island<br>that we told them that they you know<br>that this these storms were going to<br>come and destroy the island and the<br>bridge but if we if we took the advice<br>of ecological planning and design I do<br>think that our public spaces could make<br>a difference<br>um and um anyhow and integrating uh<br>systems of public spaces in in through<br>an ecological planning process<br>um as was advocated 40 years ago and it<br>were still hesitant to really take it on<br>for Force though there are some<br>practitioners<br>um like Kate orff who are who is<br>beginning to really take some of the<br>ecological planning design seriously but<br>but public space is is again the<br>centerpiece of that<br>I don't know and of course uh as Julian<br>argument brings up it shouldn't just be<br>sustainability but just stay just<br>sustainability and um to be thinking<br>about sustainability without thinking<br>about social justice I would argue to<br>think about public space without<br>thinking about public space for all or<br>public space and social justice I don't<br>think we're going to get anywhere you<br>know that that to me isn't going to be<br>successful so again for the<br>sustainability uh component of of public<br>space the contribution can be made it's<br>only going to be a contribution if it's<br>a just kind of sustainability that it<br>incorporates everyone but I think that<br>permeates all of these different aspects<br>that I'm talking about<br>and finally the concluding contribution<br>um is on cultural identity and place<br>attachment I mean what Anthropologist<br>isn't going to say something about the<br>importance of public space<br>um for identity I hope you all know this<br>is Stonehenge in the UK which is still a<br>place of identity formation even today<br>as it was in the uh in the past<br>um but I I also uh suggest suggest are<br>looking at places and public spaces<br>um that generate Place attachment like<br>the Statue of Liberty where we did a a<br>interesting study of what are all the<br>ways that we attach to public spaces<br>that public spaces are are create<br>attachments and cultural attachments<br>that bind us to other people and people<br>we don't even know I mean people form<br>Place attachments to the Statue of<br>Liberty even if they've never been there<br>and these imaginaries one would say<br>these again a public space or public<br>symbol<br>create certain kinds of relationships<br>that<br>um I really feel<br>um uh have duration uh create public<br>culture back to<br>um that that can uh be transmitted and<br>circulated and make a difference in the<br>uh public sphere<br>um I haven't talked I I talk a lot<br>usually under the social justice<br>um section about cultural representation<br>and I haven't spent a lot of time<br>talking about it today<br>um you know always as you present and<br>I'm talking to you I can already see<br>different ways to present this material<br>but I think it is important for us this<br>is Prospect Park uh near where I live<br>and<br>um you need to remember how important<br>parks are for uh cultural representation<br>cultural continuity<br>um these are Yorba uh Haitian offerings<br>here<br>um in the park in the drumming Circle<br>and this is just groups of people being<br>able to get together during covid to be<br>able to continue<br>um their relationships but uh cultural<br>representation as many of you know<br>there's been<br>um actually movements all over the world<br>to take down statues of people who of of<br>conquerors and slave owners and to begin<br>to pay attention to who is represented<br>in our space one thing I always want to<br>add is representation doesn't have to be<br>a monument<br>in a public space that if you want<br>socially just and spaces that uh you<br>know create cultural continuity having<br>people that look like you or having<br>activities that you want to uh um<br>participate in having sing having there<br>be a place where you would feel<br>comfortable those are also forms of<br>representation and public space offers<br>that<br>um in a way that that no other place<br>does and in a way that can absorb and<br>accommodate multiplicity of<br>representations and yet still bring<br>people together this part<br>Prospect Park has all kinds of of ethnic<br>racial cultural groups there all the<br>time and they have their own little<br>spaces sometimes they Retreat to but<br>there's also a big Promenade that<br>everyone gets together and walks and and<br>roller skates like a boardwalk in a<br>beach<br>um that um spaces that represent<br>everyone accommodate everyone and yet at<br>the same time provide spaces to come<br>together I think offer our uh our our<br>where we want to go<br>um this is Battery Park City again the<br>role of public space in disaster and<br>also in community cohesion their public<br>spaces created a way for the community<br>to come back together after 9 11 because<br>Battery Park city is right next to where<br>the World Trade Center towers went down<br>and<br>um we've written about how that public<br>space really made a difference<br>um for people for families and friends<br>and Community to get together<br>um so it's not just for the informal<br>economic and public space work but also<br>as a form<br>um a focus of community cohesion<br>and um this is it says Melbourne New<br>Zealand that's where the era came in<br>okay well this is Melbourne Australia<br>sorry new zealanders that's just a huge<br>typo<br>um but I used it to try to talk and what<br>I'm really worried about that it could<br>be wrong in the book somehow<br>um<br>this is a study by Jonathan Daly about<br>Intercultural encounters and uh how<br>public spaces both can and or cannot<br>encourage or discourage Intercultural<br>encounters and this was<br>um this architect's idea of<br>Multicultural and um kind of out of time<br>so I'm not going to talk a lot about it<br>I also I'm very concerned about this<br>type of so I think<br>um I'm not exactly sure what to do<br>should I stop sharing my screen at this<br>point and maybe take a few questions<br>yes<br>absolutely<br>okay<br>so now thank you very much<br>and uh well in first place I would like<br>to take the opportunity that you<br>mentioned at the beginning so to uh to<br>make the post question first question to<br>you through email so and I wonder if you<br>can uh tuck it down in the in the chat<br>your address maybe I have one here is<br>that one the one of the University shy<br>for this it's actually put it in the<br>chat put it are you gonna put it all<br>right I put that one is that the right<br>one<br>that's my email yes yeah okay that's the<br>right one you got that I'm I'm saying<br>this because uh we are running short of<br>time now we only have a couple of<br>minutes to wrap it up and uh uh we<br>haven't received any any question at the<br>moment in the chat so unfortunately<br>system is very unusual for our lecture<br>series we do them usually online and<br>offline sorry offline so in the in<br>presence and usually we do it in the<br>evening as I mentioned the the beginning<br>before the start of your talk so we're<br>gonna have discuss on this the tradition<br>of uh engaging with our lectures in this<br>way so I think that we can uh work with<br>that system of email but I have a couple<br>of things that might want to ask you<br>before wrapping up but one is probably<br>another picture so maybe it is uh you<br>ask or asking value or how can we<br>articulate this or uh come up with a<br>better definition of public culture and<br>how this culture is actually what we<br>pleasure what we want this public space<br>to be able to Foster and develop but of<br>course<br>they lose their way could be well public<br>relational culture because what happens<br>is exactly that they get out of this<br>system of alienation or abstraction and<br>re-establish a system of connections and<br>possibly the lesson will be the question<br>of Destruction how is the favorite here<br>so the question of exactly opposing this<br>system of these domains or regimes if<br>you want to distribution I would say in<br>terms of<br>exactly preventing the differentiation<br>in terms of the maximum differentiation<br>contribution and individualization that<br>happens in public space so let's just<br>note yeah those are great yes<br>I love it<br>I love the counter hegemonic a lot of<br>people have been trying to write that<br>public culture in there is counter<br>hegemonic I think it is sometimes and<br>sometimes not I mean I can think of<br>public spaces where there's quite a bit<br>of counterhead dramatic public culture<br>being created and others where you know<br>that's not the case at all so I mean<br>maybe there's a gradation of of what<br>goes on but I like that very much yeah I<br>mean and Rose upon what you mentioned<br>seven point referring to European<br>happiness of course the big questions<br>are coming here so how businesses are<br>really to make sure that people that<br>talk are able to be heard so that's<br>right that's yeah but another thing I<br>want to ask and I find it very<br>interesting<br>how you articulated through case study<br>is very important for to show evidence<br>when we're talking about these complex<br>aspects like what public space can do<br>and the question is very much something<br>that probably comes through the idea of<br>yeah and that's that's a bit of a<br>feeling that sometimes we feel in this<br>situation in which on one hand we have<br>had this exacerbation of segregation of<br>social distancing during these last<br>three few to three years right but<br>that's something to do I guess also with<br>the way in which we perceive and<br>understand things so other things that I<br>always<br>use as a point of reference for it is a<br>that we probably have to rename a<br>discussion of a social distancing it<br>should be special distance<br>or physical distance<br>yeah or we want to avoid the comments<br>call it physical distance that's what it<br>is it's not even spatial it's it's it<br>we're time at six feet that's uh you<br>know physical distance and we keep using<br>this word social distancing but you know<br>I've written a little bit about that I<br>think people did want a social distance<br>I think the physical distancing at least<br>in the United States<br>gave certain classes of people uh the<br>license to physically distance<br>themselves from the city from the dirt<br>from the whatever and I think it's very<br>much very telling that they wanted<br>social distancing and a lot of stigma<br>evolved out of it I don't know about in<br>New Zealand but in the United States the<br>the stigma and and negative feelings<br>about the other it it really magnified<br>it<br>I don't know if that happened where you<br>are<br>well it's quite complex quite a complex<br>situation also because we have been hit<br>in a very different way than for<br>instance the US I remember when you gave<br>the talk about the beginning of kovid<br>around the particularly bad impact that<br>had in New York uh essentially on<br>different social groups on different<br>conditions even related to different uh<br>districts and areas of New York uh<br>looking from New Zealand was quite a<br>revealing thing because here we have a<br>much different conditional density of<br>distribution and particularly of if you<br>want the<br>inequalities within the city but another<br>thing I want to just before wrapping up<br>mention is and I found particularly<br>interesting is in one of your cases to<br>probably talk of each and every one of<br>your of your examples but the one on<br>sustainability and the question of<br>sustainability and public Justice and we<br>will cast my mind the work of your diary<br>means and he is important always<br>the accent on this particular aspect so<br>we cannot do anything in that uh in that<br>in that aspect of say climate change or<br>environmental justice if we don't really<br>look at a much broader notion of Justice<br>am I right there yeah you're right I<br>don't think I I you know I think that<br>all of this has to be predicated on a<br>larger view of justice but I guess what<br>I'm arguing at least in this book which<br>is a book to try to convince the middle<br>class really the middle classes that<br>that publish space matters that's who it<br>was written for I mean the people who<br>aren't sharing their public spaces that<br>um it we can start with public spaces<br>not an end in and of itself but it's a<br>place we can start it's like going to<br>the micro and hope you know working up<br>because I don't know that I can<br>restructure New York City but maybe I<br>could stop the building of something<br>like Hudson yards which is totally<br>exclusionary you know I mean what what<br>is it I mean this is where Neil and I<br>differed Neil felt we only had to have<br>Revolution and of course I was I'm still<br>liberal and I kept saying well I'm not<br>going to be able to have a revolution in<br>my lifetime so what can I do I'd like to<br>be able to stop the privatization of<br>public space that is highly exclusive<br>exclusionary and argue for a very<br>different kind of public space where<br>different things can happen including<br>black lives matter protest resist you<br>know where something new can happen<br>yeah public space<br>a lot real public space public space<br>where you can make a difference yeah<br>yeah and what I think is that there's<br>not a hard boundary between say<br>revolutionary reform so the two things<br>oh you say they come together<br>hi we should have we should definitely<br>get together we could learn a lot I<br>I hope you will receive lots of<br>questions uh not only for the from the<br>participant today which I've seen I<br>received at the number of 30 but<br>probably for people that can see it in<br>the recorded version on our website on<br>the password lecture Series right and we<br>now yeah we finally have a question<br>about indigenous spaces and<br>Reconciliation yeah right okay I<br>um I will have to talk we'll have to<br>have another meeting<br>yeah Claire hello all Take Care thank</p></main><footer style="margin-top: 2rem; background:
