to the first celt corridero a<br>monthly series of talks about teaching<br>Innovation here at tafariwanana or taco<br>we're going to begin today with a<br>message from our Deputy Vice Chancellor<br>my name is Helen Nicholson I'm the<br>deputy Vice Chancellor academic<br>it's my pleasure to welcome you to this<br>first cult Corolla teaching and learning<br>is a vital part of what we do as a<br>university and these Colorado are a way<br>of raising the profile of teaching and<br>learning providing an opportunity to<br>share the expertise of our amazing staff<br>and providing a forum for people to come<br>together and discuss some other<br>challenging issues that we face<br>today we're going to talk about open<br>resources but in future calculator we<br>will be talking about other challenges<br>such as Ai and chat GPT and why students<br>don't come to lectures<br>I'd like to thank the committee for the<br>advancement of learning and teaching for<br>this Innovation and particularly for<br>Russell butts and Sarah Stein and Kate<br>Bardwell for the work they've put into<br>making this happen<br>foreign<br>daughter Helen thank you very much uh<br>I'd like to start today by welcoming<br>everybody to this Cordero uh firstly to<br>our studio audience who are here in the<br>media Production Studio uh to those of<br>you watching online via zoom and also to<br>those of you who might be catching up<br>with us at a later date via the Celtic<br>cordial website one of the big Concepts<br>behind calc is to Foster conversation<br>and uh debate about the way we teach at<br>otago and it's not just about whether<br>you you'll be here in person whether<br>you're watching live but also<br>potentially uh<br>engaging with the conversations at a<br>later date through the website<br>okay so<br>um the format for today is uh well it's<br>a conversation it's a chord editor I<br>have a wonderful panel here of teaching<br>practitioners here at the University<br>with me<br>um<br>so we'll be having a chat I'll be asking<br>them some questions uh but I also uh<br>welcome questions from the audience<br>towards the end I'll ask if people here<br>in the studio with us have questions and<br>they can ask them on the mic but also<br>people who are watching uh from Zoom<br>live cam feed questions through the zoom<br>chat and they will magically appear for<br>me here on this tablet and the studio<br>and I'll put them to the panel<br>so um<br>to introduce myself called Richard white<br>aho uh Cole Haute kaifakahire monitor<br>I am the manager copyright and Open<br>Access here at the University my role uh<br>broadly speaking is trying to ensure<br>that we are copyright compliant but also<br>to advise staff about things to do with<br>Open Access understanding licensing<br>understanding your rights as creators<br>and also what you can and can't do with<br>things that are created by other people<br>in the context of today's discussion<br>about open educational resources<br>obviously licensing is a big part of<br>understanding uh when something's open<br>what does that really mean what can you<br>do with it are you allowed to copy it<br>can you change it make money off of<br>those those kind of things but on the<br>copyright side of resources and readings<br>and access<br>people will be asking me questions about<br>or I can copy how much of this book or<br>what are the license terms of this ebook<br>you know and why can't my students<br>download those things those sorts of<br>questions and I worked very closely with<br>the library on a lot of those access<br>questions as well<br>so that's me turning to my panel here<br>I'm going to ask each of them to briefly<br>introduce themselves I guess uh you know<br>your name uh what department you're from<br>and what's the what's the kind of scope<br>of your teaching or the focus of your<br>and I'm from the Department of<br>management in the otago business school<br>and I guess I have a background in open<br>and open resources for about 10 years or<br>so now which is really exciting to bring<br>it here and I teach in the HR program<br>and the management program so I'm<br>teaching leadership and change and<br>employment relations<br>yeah sure thank you Sophie Tina go<br>though call Sophie I am a teaching<br>fellow in the department of geology and<br>I'm teaching mostly into first year<br>geology courses<br>cool thank you very much and joining us<br>from Auckland uh Sunny apparently<br>Auckland uh on Zoom is Christine yeah<br>Christine<br>like a whole new Hall um or hey I am<br>Christine and I'm Christine you I'm<br>teaching the otago MBA program<br>um discover professional Consulting<br>engagement so that's largely about<br>project management<br>great thank you very much okay so um<br>before we get into questions for the<br>panel uh I'm going to provide a little<br>bit of a framework uh to to ensure that<br>everyone's kind of on the same page<br>about uh what open resources are at<br>least in the context of what we're doing<br>here<br>um so<br>uh open educational resources or oers<br>are um<br>any kind of educational material that's<br>free online uh they're licensed in a way<br>that enable other people to use share<br>and adapt those things so in other words<br>they're not just something that's online<br>it's something that's specifically<br>enabled for people to to reuse<br>uh there can really be any kind of<br>material<br>today we'll really be focusing on for<br>one of a bit of a word textbooks<br>um although I guess really the kind of<br>textbooks we're talking about are not<br>not the traditional kind but they're<br>likely to be more interactive and<br>incorporate different kinds of media and<br>elements within the overall framework of<br>a textbook<br>um so that that's maybe the focus of our<br>chat today but oer's really can be<br>anything they can be videos they can be<br>quizzes they can be a curriculum that<br>someone has developed and released<br>online for other people to use literally<br>anything Wikipedia isn't is an oer<br>um it more or less anything that's open<br>and online and has an educational use<br>and it's licensed in that way<br>can be an open resource<br>it's worth mentioning that oers are not<br>new we've been around<br>really since the dawn of the internet<br>but but<br>um<br>probably more prominently in the last<br>10 12 15 years in some parts of the<br>world they haven't really caught on for<br>some reasons that that we we might get<br>into today in a big way<br>but I will mention that in some places<br>that I've invested quite a lot of time<br>and resource and uh thinking at a<br>strategic level uh into developing oers<br>for the benefit of<br>teaching staff and students a good<br>example is British Columbia and Canada<br>where they've been uh and working in a<br>space for uh 12 years or more and one<br>nice fact to drop in is that they've<br>estimated<br>that they've saved students 32 million<br>dollars in the 12 years of their origin<br>they calculate that by taking<br>a traditional textbook that cost X<br>dollars that was being used in the<br>course before and then multiplying that<br>by the number of students and then each<br>year subsequently that they they haven't<br>used the the book the cost that that<br>amount they they work out the total so<br>they're estimating 32 million dollars<br>saved for students uh in in British<br>Columbia over that period of time<br>and um one other uh oer just to mention<br>is uh a media studies textbook that was<br>developed here at the University in<br>2014.<br>um was hacked together in a weekend by a<br>bunch of people not to stay at otago<br>actually there were people from a number<br>of different universities across<br>australasia who wanted to create a uh a<br>media studies book for our first year<br>students that had a local flavor<br>um so they hacked it together in a kind<br>of a coding hack style over a weekend<br>and in the time that that's been<br>available online it's been used over<br>half a million times<br>uh by people literally from all over the<br>over the world funnily enough largely in<br>North America which was the kind of<br>textbook they were trying to avoid uh by<br>writing their own local New Zealand<br>favored one but for some reason it was<br>very popular in North America<br>so oh yeah it's been around for a while<br>um<br>the benefits are are pretty clear I<br>suppose if you think about them<br>obviously they're free they don't cost<br>students any money we're used to expect<br>students to certainly when I was a<br>student there was an expectation that<br>you would buy the textbooks and if you<br>didn't then they would be available for<br>you in the library high demand ones<br>would be on reserve<br>it's probably fair to say we don't<br>really expect students to buy or at<br>least we know a fair proportion of them<br>will not buy a book even if we tell them<br>that's really necessary for the course<br>and they'll find other means to um to<br>get the information that they need<br>so<br>um<br>it's free cost is obviously one<br>significant benefit it's also free in<br>terms of barriers you know there's<br>there's no logins you don't have to have<br>an account you don't have to go through<br>um Blackboard or Moodle or you know a<br>portal to reach a thing that you want to<br>just read it you know for your reading<br>for that course<br>um so there's Equity diversity and<br>inclusion are kind of key things at the<br>heart of oers the victim<br>um they're also free of of time uh<br>constraints as well<br>obviously um one of the things we've<br>turned to a lot and in recent times is<br>ebooks which are great as a way of<br>providing access anywhere anytime for<br>our students but there are still<br>restrictions to those one is cost it's<br>not necessarily free not everything is<br>available in an e-book and there's also<br>the time constraint of you must actually<br>be enrolled as a student in order to<br>access those kind of ebooks<br>um whereas with oers uh high school<br>students can see the textbook before<br>they come to University High School<br>teachers can even use them to help you<br>know shape uh you know year 13 courses<br>as a way of teaching students what<br>they're going to learn at University<br>um and obviously in terms of lifelong<br>learning there's no constraint at the<br>end of the course as well that once you<br>lose access you don't have access to<br>so that that's a that's a clear benefit<br>as well and I've mentioned a couple of<br>times already that what a key reason<br>people get into oers is to localize them<br>and you guys will have some things to<br>say about those two<br>it's not an Australian textbook and it's<br>not a Canadian textbook or a European<br>textbook you can because of the license<br>you can take the thing you can adapt it<br>and change it to fit your own local<br>context<br>this is not say that oers are not<br>without their challenges<br>um<br>we were chatting a little bit before we<br>came online today about um<br>the fact that oers are not kind of<br>plugged into the the traditional systems<br>for production publication editorial<br>standards peer review all that kind of<br>thing I'm not really part of oers that<br>tend to be developed by people with a<br>passion who invest their own time and if<br>effort into it which raises some<br>concerns about sustainability of of an<br>open textbook as well it hasn't got the<br>publisher coming back to the authors<br>every three years and saying we need to<br>update this and we're going to pay you<br>some kind of stipend to do it so<br>sustainability is another potential<br>issue with oers<br>uh not to mention just the time and<br>effort that's involved in creating them<br>as these guys are doing now<br>okay so that brings me to my final uh<br>bit to wrap up my um introductory uh of<br>the talk today and that's to say that we<br>are<br>and and the three people here on the<br>panel today are uh uh involved in this<br>project which has been undertaken at the<br>University to dip our toes I guess into<br>the open educational resources space and<br>create some of our own<br>textbooks so uh call which is the<br>Council of Australian University<br>Librarians of which there's a New<br>Zealand part uh have um<br>uh bought a license to press books which<br>is an open text platform which is<br>essentially WordPress but modified for<br>educational use and we can host a number<br>of books on this platform uh it's a way<br>of authoring but then also publishing<br>and making available your<br>through through press books so that's uh<br>that's what we've signed up for we have<br>a couple of slots uh each year that<br>people can if they're interested sign up<br>for but also it comes with support in<br>terms of the community of practice where<br>you can talk to other authors you can<br>get training and how to use the software<br>and that sort of thing<br>um but also support locally from people<br>like me<br>and there's also grants available<br>through that program to<br>okay that's my uh that's my blurb to<br>begin today's<br>um chat about open educational resources<br>so I'm going to turn to my panel now<br>let's start uh today uh Lenny I'll start<br>with you and we'll work uh work that way<br>um so perhaps you could just give<br>everyone here uh you know what's the<br>project you're undertaking<br>uh what's the scope of it what are your<br>plans where are you at right<br>right okay fantastic<br>I'm producing<br>um a book a textbook on workplace health<br>and safety and employment relations and<br>it's given me an opportunity to I guess<br>uh draw some resources that I've been<br>creating in other universities prior and<br>weave them into my current context here<br>in otago<br>um so at the moment I have some content<br>written and then I'm drawing in<br>um some new content and I'm at the stage<br>where I'm really grappling with the<br>actual software and I've really enjoyed<br>being part of the community of practice<br>probably since mid last year or yeah mid<br>last year and just really connecting<br>with people I guess who are like-minded<br>around the philosophy of open education<br>resources and just stretching us to<br>think about Universal Design and a whole<br>bunch of other things so that's kind of<br>the space I'm in at the moment thank you<br>and the things that you developed<br>beforehand uh some of these were videos<br>I understand correct so is a bunch of<br>different kinds of media or yeah it's<br>drawing together a bunch of media and it<br>was nice that you spoke to the textbook<br>being much more a multimedia resource<br>perhaps than a traditional textbook so<br>I'd produced six animated videos with a<br>team of media producers prior<br>and their ISBN resources so they get to<br>be plugged into my new open textbook<br>so in a way you're kind of curating<br>stuff and join together of existing<br>materials it's really nice it's being<br>able to share with my otago Learners a<br>portfolio of work and it's also nice for<br>me because it's a reflection on the<br>journey where I've been in workplace<br>health and safety and employment<br>relations and where that field has come<br>from and going to so and importantly you<br>retain the rights to the things that you<br>made in previous jobs so that you were<br>able to correct yeah and even still<br>though it was really important to be<br>courteous and go back to that<br>institution and make sure that they<br>could understand and importantly the<br>opportunity to share back is really<br>important because I know that they are<br>still teaching off my resources today so<br>I'm able to share that back in a new way<br>and integrate more resources in for<br>everyone okay great thank you very much<br>okay Sophie so how about your project<br>yeah so our group is working on writing<br>an introductory geology textbook<br>so I'm working with two colleagues on<br>this Mike Palin from geology here at<br>otago and Kate Pedley from the school of<br>it's an environment at Canterbury<br>um so the this is a textbook for first<br>year courses but because it's we want it<br>to be applicable to multiple<br>universities which have pretty different<br>course structures and themes at the<br>first year level one of our goals is to<br>try and make it as flexible as possible<br>rather than prescriptive to to a single<br>course<br>um another one of our goals is to<br>frame this open text in an aotearoa New<br>Zealand<br>perspective so geology is a very<br>place-based discipline yeah so bringing<br>in<br>um local geological examples case<br>studies and also indigenous knowledges<br>as well is is really exciting for us<br>cool okay and you had already been<br>working with an oer that was a Canadian<br>textbook previously so so uh<br>Saskatchewan<br>um based on the British Columbia<br>um text yeah and we have been using that<br>in one of our courses for two years now<br>yeah okay so one difference well a<br>couple of differences between your two<br>projects you're working by yourself<br>you've got the<br>benefits and challenges of collaborating<br>with other people<br>um but also you're both using stuff that<br>that has come before in your case it's<br>your own material but in your case it's<br>building upon the work that's been done<br>obviously but localizing it yeah<br>okay great okay and then over to<br>Christine<br>hi good morning so my project is<br>translating one English open textbook on<br>project management uplifted a bit and<br>into a bit more of an MBA project<br>management executive teaching material<br>and the book title is strategy<br>Consulting partly because the people<br>taking MBA are executive level our guide<br>for executives leading project<br>um I am using the original English open<br>textbook translating into International<br>Chinese now that's probably a new and<br>probably slightly ambitious concept for<br>a lot of people<br>um as you can imagine if you speak a<br>different language there are different<br>Regional differences and I had the first<br>taste of it when I taught the first Coho<br>and it is something that I feel very<br>passionate about maybe there is a<br>version like International English that<br>we can put together knowing that<br>different institutes had multiple<br>different Chinese language version of<br>the jargon of the same thing so it's a<br>global issue it's not just what we face<br>as localized issue and also the fact<br>that I can incorporate a bit of my<br>previous work experience of my first<br>book and so yeah that's something that I<br>feel like that would benefit The Wider<br>chinese-speaking community<br>potentially quite a wide audience<br>there's quite a few Chinese speakers in<br>the world down there<br>um so you're you're a cohort of students<br>are they are they all located in in<br>China itself or are they speed across<br>the the Chinese cohort or in China and<br>different part of the region and um and<br>and unfortunately they were in lockdown<br>so it was a bit of a tricky time to try<br>new things at the time but then we it<br>was good to have the internet and the<br>information available online and that<br>was exactly why I think an open textbook<br>when the logistical issue is impacting<br>students some sort of e-version and<br>online version that's open for them to<br>download can make a huge difference<br>okay okay thank you very much so<br>um Coming uh onto our next question<br>um<br>how would you say linear you touched on<br>this a little bit how would you say that<br>um openness informs the way you teach<br>your company first in an impressible<br>I'll ask the other two as well<br>um<br>and how does using openness<br>um or open resources inform your<br>pedagogical approach to teaching<br>yeah so I think about it in lots of<br>different levels<br>um I guess I come at it from a<br>perspective of widening participation<br>first of all for those who are going to<br>be actually attending my class<br>so thinking about so what's your student<br>body so generally speaking is quite<br>diverse yeah so third year students I'm<br>mainly in the third year student space<br>so I have previously taught<br>undergraduate and postgraduate<br>um and obviously with covert we've all<br>experienced online so that's a really<br>unique setting as well but I guess I<br>think it's about making the classroom as<br>welcoming as it can be and putting more<br>of an emphasis on the Learners learning<br>rather than the teachers teaching if<br>that makes sense so really thinking<br>about do I mind in some cases where a<br>student is able to learn and I think<br>that if I'm offering an opportunity<br>where for some reason they've had to<br>miss a week and they can engage with the<br>material online when they come back into<br>the classroom they're able to pick up<br>and and continue as an if but I guess in<br>the open resource context it's about the<br>fact that I don't need to worry about<br>the financial situation of my students<br>and for me personally I'm always<br>thinking that might be a couple more<br>hours in my classroom if I'm offering<br>that resource for free versus a couple<br>of more hours in the workplace and so<br>that's that's a priority there I guess<br>um<br>speaking to Sophie in collaboration I<br>guess I've done collaborative projects<br>in the past in that space or at least<br>been thinking about other people in<br>other contexts who would be using these<br>resources thinking about the longevity<br>of resources<br>and when you're partnering with<br>developing country context recognizing<br>that the colleagues won't always have<br>the same access to even the internal<br>funding resources that I have so if I<br>can create resources in collaboration<br>with them and then be sharing back in<br>it's it's also supporting them and that<br>that can build relationships for life in<br>terms of teaching research and Beyonds<br>excellent Sophie did you have any<br>thoughts<br>yeah I mean one of the one of our<br>drivers for considering doing this was<br>just knowing what our students<br>engagement with the hard copy textbook<br>was<br>um and it's very low so um yeah so you<br>had a for one of the better word<br>traditional<br>hard yeah and new editions coming out<br>were on the order of 250 per copy so<br>that's that's getting a little bit<br>extreme<br>um for a lot of students and you know<br>we um we know from from evaluations and<br>anecdotally that students are more<br>likely to use ebook copies through the<br>University Library website of the<br>textbook then to buy the HUD HUD copy<br>um but also you know<br>up to 65 of the students weren't<br>engaging at all with with readings so<br>for us it's about<br>um oers actually provide a lot of<br>opportunities to really knit those you<br>know readings that it's really<br>multimedia like you said linear and into<br>the rest of the course<br>um you know we've got our online<br>learning management system and oers work<br>really well with that and really open up<br>the opportunities for you know various<br>styles of flipped learning flipped<br>classrooms and you said you've been<br>using the Canadian oer up till now as<br>well<br>just elements of It kind of thing<br>because some of presumably is not local<br>enough or whatever yeah other basic<br>science stuff I assume is fairly<br>applicable yeah yeah and and we've had<br>pretty good uptake with that so far so<br>okay good so there was obviously enough<br>to convince you<br>that this was worth investing the time<br>and effort into going down this road<br>yeah yeah okay<br>how about you Christine<br>um you talked a little a little bit<br>about this already perhaps but yeah sort<br>of that that how does openness inform<br>the way you teach or your approach to<br>teaching<br>and I think what happened is there's<br>just a lot of information about project<br>management out there<br>um that are quite inconsistent and for<br>executive learning um having one<br>consistent good quality textbook can<br>make a huge difference to start off with<br>um then I think that having textbook<br>rather than you just have so many<br>articles when you do your own your<br>research it's just help with the quality<br>of um focus of the focus helping a<br>student who focus and also helping us in<br>terms of like you know quality education<br>to provide that end-to-end story with<br>consistency of a material mm-hmm all<br>right thank you I'd like to dig a little<br>um<br>I think all three of you have kind of<br>mentioned this in a way uh<br>the fact that removing the barriers<br>whether it's the time ones or the cost<br>ones uh expands you you guys are not<br>just thinking about your cohort of<br>students that are coming to this class<br>this year you're thinking about it more<br>broadly so I'd like to ask you each<br>maybe to expand on on that so for<br>example we've talked about the the fact<br>that you know you're the professional<br>discipline as well<br>um government agencies but school work<br>and that sort of thing as as well so for<br>each of you the question is kind of you<br>know<br>what are those broader avenues that can<br>be explored by going down this path so<br>for your set of years yeah so<br>um<br>to my knowledge they're a New Zealand a<br>New Zealand geology textbook doesn't<br>currently exist looking at at broader<br>applications High School NCAA Urban<br>space science really you said or it<br>might have been Mike said geology is not<br>a subject you can do at high school<br>you'd not do elements of it in geography<br>or geography or Earth and space science<br>is the main one so it might have been<br>might use the phrase it to discovered<br>subject at University yeah so yeah in a<br>way this is a way to help that Discovery<br>by removing the yeah that's right and I<br>mean a lot of it a lot of it comes down<br>to cost but a lot of it is also<br>engagement so being able to to knit in<br>you know quizzes and formative<br>assessments into the text the oer itself<br>really helps with student engagement and<br>you know we're welcome welcoming them<br>into the discipline and getting them<br>interested so and how about the<br>professional side<br>um I don't know much about it but you<br>know there's gns clients and you know is<br>a broader group of people at the other<br>end if you like have you know you've<br>talked about the high school students<br>but when you come out the other end<br>there's another cohort of people that<br>have an interest in what you're doing<br>potentially yeah absolutely I mean we're<br>starting with a pretty small group just<br>because of logistical challenges of<br>collaborating on such a<br>yeah ambitious task<br>um but the great thing about oers is<br>that the editable and you can add to<br>them so bringing in sort of the<br>professional side of things and giving<br>students a sense of what career<br>opportunities are available in the<br>discipline through this text would be<br>great to be great to have some case<br>studies from from folks in the various<br>institutions so obviously those people<br>will have complete access to what you've<br>produced as well and they could<br>potentially contribute to it in you know<br>in future times absolutely yeah<br>Christine how about you did you have any<br>other thoughts on this kind of uh what's<br>the yeah I mean you've mentioned<br>uh obviously there's a huge potential<br>audience for for your book so how are<br>you think thinking in terms of<br>who might use such a book you know it's<br>not just your class but it's you know<br>what's the broader possibilities there<br>yes I think in The Wider context<br>um High School<br>um even Primary School the project<br>management profession as an industry<br>where you're trying to lift the standard<br>I've been quite involved with the<br>project management Institute in New<br>Zealand and the fact is if we can do<br>projects better we potentially you know<br>keep workplace safer you know like<br>health and safety what we're in there<br>talk about and also like save a lot of<br>budget and wasting time and in terms of<br>like the fact that we are going through<br>a lot of challenges in business and also<br>in the society<br>um it's important to actually start the<br>education early and by providing a<br>textbook that's open enough you can take<br>some of the versions some of the bits<br>for high school students again thinking<br>about a future career not just sitting<br>at the project manager space but it can<br>potentially lead you to a next executive<br>career and these are some things that<br>like for me personally I have taken that<br>sort of career journey and and the fact<br>that I have done it I like to share that<br>um in part of the textbook<br>um and potentially in The Wider<br>community space once it's out and<br>generate some you know online discussion<br>and online Forum that will help other<br>people to you know sort of grow in that<br>career Journey<br>all right thank you you mentioned as<br>well in another conversation that you<br>would look to produce an English version<br>as well as a Chinese one potentially is<br>it still in your thinking or you know<br>that's a bit further down the track I I<br>realized I'm translating it's not that<br>straightforward so right now I'm only<br>focusing doing the Chinese version as<br>good as I can incorporate some of my<br>experience and and that eventually it<br>will possibly be like a different<br>English version<br>um but at this point I think it's better<br>to focus on one task and one task only<br>interestingly uh priest books a platform<br>um<br>I think I mentioned I can't remember<br>press but press books dot directory as<br>the URL you can go to to browse uh uh<br>oers that are have been made available<br>on the pressbox platform some really<br>high quality ones there<br>um<br>it's it the filters on the side allow<br>you to search there is not yet a Chinese<br>language textbook on the platform so<br>yours will be the first one actually<br>which would be quite exciting it's<br>mostly English there's quite a lot of<br>Spanish in a smattering of French and a<br>few other languages but but there's no<br>Chinese ones at this stage I think so<br>that would be a good first for you and<br>uh for a time I think Lenny I think<br>coming to you you already talked a<br>little bit about about sort of the<br>broader discipline but did you have any<br>other thoughts to add to this<br>conversation everyone listen to the<br>other two I think what's exciting is<br>that first of all you are reducing the<br>barriers but I think we're increasingly<br>recognizing the importance of people<br>seeing themselves on the page certainly<br>I know that from primary schools upwards<br>it's about<br>um seeing seeing yourself seeing your<br>own stories and I think this is an<br>opportunity like what Sophie's been<br>talking about to do that<br>um to you know include examples of work<br>health and safety culture from the New<br>Zealand aotearoa perspective will be<br>really important<br>and I think that<br>once we build upon that<br>um it brings insights for all the<br>different readers as well but<br>importantly I guess I just come back to<br>work health and safety and uh it's being<br>a social good<br>so I'm really Keen you know I do feel<br>that it is a field where you can<br>actually save lives and that I shouldn't<br>be holding that information to myself<br>ideally so it is about that sharing yeah<br>okay<br>just following up on that idea I guess<br>co-creation as a as a phrase we could<br>use<br>have any of you engaged in this<br>previously or is it something that you<br>you know obviously we're thinking that<br>this is a possibility<br>I've I've certainly seen examples<br>overseas where uh textbook in fact<br>they've done this in Australia<br>um<br>the previous version of open textbook is<br>used by the subsequent years students<br>and they actually effectively create a<br>new edition of the work by co-creating<br>and adapting it and that's part of the<br>assessment for the students as well is<br>to produce this thing so you know is<br>there is that a possibility for your own<br>projects in the future or certainly<br>would be for me I really think that you<br>engage students through involving them<br>in the resources and certainly even the<br>video resources I produced were<br>critiqued reviewed refined based with<br>the students and I always just put an<br>emphasis that you're building the Legacy<br>for the next group of learners but like<br>you said what I really love about it<br>also is that it will exist Beyond<br>Blackboard like what's their Blackboard<br>sites down they can share it with<br>colleagues in their future workplaces we<br>can continue to get feedback on how<br>relevant that is in the actual workplace<br>did you try that idea did it work build<br>them into case studies alumni so I'm<br>really excited to actually do that phase<br>Sophie Christine did you have any other<br>well for the student that is in the<br>paper they all each of them have to do<br>one um crime project and so they're like<br>given that we were we creating<br>um sort of Oakland sort of community if<br>they are ready to share back as part of<br>the case study and contribute back into<br>the textbook there's always a<br>possibility<br>um yeah so that's the<br>um I'm quite into that sort of iteration<br>kind of development method I think um<br>you know something like a textbook is<br>always going to have its own life<br>um and it's just different cohort comes<br>in and with different sort of projects<br>and challenges then we we can use the<br>new case study we may be talking about<br>sustainability which is a completely<br>different topic to 10 years ago with<br>sustainability is not a topic<br>um Innovation become a topic so that<br>kind of case study can become very fresh<br>um it's one way to keep you know core<br>elements of a textbook for one of a<br>better word can remain constant but you<br>if you can update parts for that sort of<br>thing Sophia did you have any thoughts<br>on that yeah I mean at the first year<br>level it's it's more about getting<br>students into good habits um although I<br>think<br>um you know we are starting to move in<br>with our assessment style we're starting<br>to broaden kind of the options for<br>students to show their learning you know<br>making videos doing presentations rather<br>than just you know the standard writing<br>and writing an essay and so I think we<br>we would like to demonstrate that in our<br>open text so it's certainly in my role<br>I'm seeing more questions come in from<br>people who are asking those questions<br>about well I'd like to raise this with<br>my class how do you go about<br>and there's privacy things to think<br>about there's a talent release all that<br>stuff you know if you're going down that<br>road if you're exposing if I can use<br>that word student work in a more public<br>way that change is fundamental some<br>fairly fundamental things about how we<br>um approach our attitude to the things<br>they produce you know and where we put<br>them and who can access them and all<br>that<br>okay all right well thank you so maybe<br>becoming we've been quite high-minded<br>and philosophical so far I feel<br>um how about uh thinking a bit more<br>about the nitty-gritty and what are some<br>of the<br>um the challenges you you there have<br>been a couple of comments about getting<br>to grips with the software and that sort<br>of thing you guys are are<br>Trailblazers or they're guinea pigs<br>whatever you want to call yourselves<br>um so you're having to kind of learn as<br>you go<br>uh you know I think I can say the<br>institutional support has been fairly<br>low-key so far so how are you finding<br>that in terms of um<br>motivating yourself what are the<br>challenges and that sort of thing<br>Christine can I can I start with you you<br>know you've mentioned sort of obviously<br>translation as a thing but in terms of<br>the just the software or copyright<br>questions that have that all that kind<br>of thing what are the challenges for you<br>so far for me I felt like translating<br>from an open textbook is kind of in a<br>way I dot a lot of Buddha because<br>there's a really version done with order<br>copyright references there and given<br>that I'm going to add a bit of my own<br>book my past material so that's not too<br>much problem in terms of the copyright<br>sort of material issue however in terms<br>of like you know getting the um getting<br>the jargons off the you know the<br>translation of jargon and that is<br>something that<br>um yeah it's probably not copyrighted<br>but takes a lot of research and the<br>research can be distracting and it takes<br>a lot of discipline to go okay I'm going<br>to have to set myself at that line<br>um with like the learning and the<br>research that needs to be done and it's<br>important so yeah yeah I think<br>self-discipline putting it in the<br>calendar I think Unity like having you<br>guys and Kate sort of email message<br>every now and then uh it's been quite<br>nice it really does feel like together<br>we are working on something new that um<br>it's very different and we're putting<br>some yeah new textbook out there and<br>together as the first trial really okay<br>Lydia you mentioned greatly with the<br>software but you also mentioned the<br>community of practice as well as a um a<br>positive thing for you yeah it's been<br>really useful to be part of the kind of<br>two country perspective on doing this<br>um hearing other people's General kind<br>of challenges but I guess I came at it<br>where I I felt quite happy that I had a<br>lot of the content down and then was<br>really I guess getting some of the<br>exposure to some of the real logistical<br>thinking through of Universal Design so<br>thinking about how would someone with a<br>particular disability engage with this<br>work I guess it got me to reflect on my<br>writing style and my genre I'm still<br>grappling a little bit there because<br>I've got several different tones<br>depending on where I find myself writing<br>and what I'm wanting to share and unlike<br>Christine I've had to go and discover<br>pictures and make sure that I'm<br>searching under the right licensing and<br>also cured us to Kate Thompson too for<br>drawing me a pyramid the other day when<br>I needed a drawing so yeah just trying<br>to do some of those Logistics and<br>certainly I feel that I couldn't have<br>done it completely on my own so I'm very<br>grateful for the support<br>so I think you've got the added<br>challenge of having two other people<br>that you're working with well I have to<br>acknowledge your support Richard<br>um our group you know being from<br>well physically in the same location and<br>we're collaborating on this it has been<br>hard to<br>um sort of carve the time out of our<br>schedules to to make this happen so time<br>has been a big one<br>um but Rich has been helping us organize<br>these heck days as we call it where we<br>block out a day from our calendar and<br>just get a lot of writing done I mean<br>really you need a project manager that<br>would be the way to go and then I know<br>then that's actually how we did the<br>media studies well we had something we<br>paid it's a project manage the whole<br>thing so that was why it was I mean that<br>would be lovely but also<br>um you know having I think for us<br>academics having<br>um you know with currently oers don't<br>have peer reviews so you know<br>um<br>it doesn't act as a as another<br>publication that you can put on your<br>publication lists perhaps more<br>acknowledgment<br>um from different places about the work<br>that we've put into this<br>um could be useful and it could be a<br>teacher<br>to help us and do it but another<br>challenge has been actually<br>um<br>trying to move away from the idea of a<br>linear textbook I didn't realize this<br>was going to be so so tricky but with<br>the oers you know it opens up a lot of<br>possibilities<br>for structure of a textbook students<br>aren't necessarily going to be reading<br>it you know chapter by chapter<br>um and it's kind of been hard to I<br>haven't really seen the other the other<br>two works really but certainly with your<br>one<br>some of those quite dense scientific<br>knowledge<br>that that I imagine is stuff that<br>students are going to have to keep<br>referring back to so when you get<br>further on they might be looking at this<br>topic but they probably think oh I need<br>to brush up on the thing so it can be<br>much more hyper-linked<br>thing that they're going to be jumping<br>around in this kind of how yeah<br>happening yeah that's right yeah there's<br>the fundamentals and then there's sort<br>of case studies and local examples and<br>things and they don't necessarily have<br>to they're not going to be read in<br>sequence yeah yeah and I mean there's<br>also some basic questions you guys have<br>been discussing in your meetings just<br>how do you approach the just the length<br>for example of it what is a chapter is<br>it now actually a much shorter thing<br>because there's no constraint on<br>you know you can make a disorder as long<br>as you like on the web page so those are<br>interesting questions you're having to<br>grab there's almost too much flexibility<br>we'll get used to it so it's Ian it's a<br>matter of adopting an editorial<br>style or whatever you mentioned tones is<br>a different thing as well yeah so<br>there's so many different things to<br>Grapple with but you know I'm getting<br>the sense each of you are enjoying it<br>it's a challenge you're excited by and<br>you're actually learning a lot along the<br>way I guess is that a fear yeah<br>absolutely in a good way I hope not<br>frustrating then you hit against the<br>software kind of way yeah yeah<br>okay now we're um getting towards the<br>end of our time I'll just remind people<br>online that they can ask us questions<br>I'm just checking my table here nothing<br>has appeared so I do pop those in if you<br>would like to ask a question<br>um and I'll I won't come to the studio<br>once just yet but I'm just seeing the<br>idea in your minds that Lloyd may come<br>to you with a microphone shortly<br>um<br>just in terms of wrapping up our<br>conversation amongst the three of us<br>here<br>um<br>we've touched on most of the the things<br>that I think we we imagine we might talk<br>about are there any uh final thoughts<br>that you wanted to add something we<br>haven't discussed so far that you'd like<br>to feed into the conversation Sophie<br>yeah so you mentioned at the beginning<br>one of the benefits being the fact that<br>it's not just open access for the<br>consumers it's also open access for<br>authors as well so in terms of you know<br>share alike copyrights and being able to<br>to take material and kind of reuse it<br>where needed that's been really useful<br>for us<br>um because we're<br>we're wanting to move to this sort of<br>place-based<br>um kind of approach where we use local<br>aotearoa examples what that allows us to<br>do is<br>um you know when we're having to explain<br>just fundamentals we can take content<br>that's already been created and that<br>frees up our time to focus on the things<br>that you know can't be written by<br>someone from another country the the<br>local examples and so that's not<br>something that I anticipated when we<br>started this project but it's I'm seeing<br>it<br>I remember in our one of our meetings<br>having a discussion about the Creative<br>Commons attribution license and you guys<br>finding it odd in a way that people<br>could just copy it yeah<br>surely I can't do it's plagiarism no no<br>it's not it's it's legal because of the<br>license is you can but it's it's that<br>difference between the copyright legal<br>side of it and the uh<br>the the moral side for one of a better<br>word of being the author and recognized<br>as the author which still carries over<br>with the Creative Commons<br>that that is never removed by an Open<br>Access license the the model side of it<br>and being attributed as is the author<br>and then that means you you can't just<br>plagiarize them either but but it was it<br>was an interesting concept for you guys<br>yeah a pretty foreign concept to us but<br>that's really been the main thing that's<br>allowed so many you know so many people<br>across the world to make these texts<br>that are really relevant to students<br>immediate surroundings yeah and you'll<br>see additions<br>uh and geology actually has quite a few<br>different ones that have been localized<br>in different places but they're all<br>originating really from one or two of<br>these original open texts yes yeah yeah<br>it's that cycle of<br>um<br>creativity and adaptation you know<br>building on the work of others yeah<br>Christine did you have anything that we<br>haven't discussed that you would like to<br>add in his final thoughts for you<br>um no but I think that there are<br>therefore management study anyway they<br>are already a lot of resources on the<br>internet and for the student that can be<br>distracting and I think yeah having that<br>sort of um step-by-step ladder upwork<br>um like you know and I don't actually<br>think copyright has been like of course<br>it's nice to have been able to share<br>openly there are copyrights of men human<br>material elsewhere out there<br>um but yeah there's so much material<br>that students can get through so for<br>them I think yeah this is probably not<br>an issue and for me to say it freely<br>it's not an issue because if I don't<br>share and with a particular perspective<br>with a bit of more um sort of out here<br>there were thielands like you know Focus<br>there will be the American there'll be<br>the ukw European and yeah yeah I think<br>we they certainly have our own voice<br>thank you yeah with the media studies<br>when I mentioned and having been<br>accessed over half a million times so<br>that they never in their Wildest Dreams<br>imagined that it would be so widely used<br>I told the person who was kind of the<br>academic lead on the project uh she'd<br>moved to another University I told her<br>how often I've been in excess since she<br>had a jaw dropped and she's like this is<br>by far the most red thing I've ever<br>written by magnitude of you know<br>um many many thousands yeah so linear<br>did you have any final thoughts yeah<br>it's really I just encourage people to<br>imagine what it could do so<br>um everything from Imagine a student<br>being able to look at the textbook when<br>they're in second year to consider if<br>they want to do my paper in third year<br>um imagine I've already had someone<br>contact me through this process to say<br>hey you're a work health and safety<br>academic I'm in this project as well<br>from another uni let's collaborate on<br>some things that sounds like our work's<br>going to complement so I'm excited to<br>see where that could go<br>um I'm excited to share with within the<br>otago business school we have<br>Partnerships us you know the world with<br>other business schools it could go there<br>and yeah like I said in the work health<br>and safety space it might just help<br>someone somewhere and that's that's got<br>a purpose of its own help someone not<br>die<br>yeah that's a good name for us to<br>conclude on the head I'm not seeing any<br>questions on my on my magic device is<br>anyone in the room<br>kinda<br>accomplish with a question perhaps we've<br>exhausted the topic sufficiently that<br>everyone's satisfied that we've covered<br>everything<br>okay excellent well<br>um that doesn't mean you can't<br>contribute to the discussion afterwards<br>as I said at the beginning one of the<br>key ideas<br>behindero is that we want to Foster<br>debate outside of just these these Live<br>Events so you don't have to be here in<br>the room or watching live but you can<br>contribute later so<br>um I'll finish today by uh giving a<br>number of thank yous firstly to the<br>media production unit guys who have<br>really made things seamless for us here<br>from a technical point of view and<br>provided uh these wonderful couches for<br>us to sit on Etc<br>and also to Russell and Bronwyn from HDC<br>who have done a lot of the uh dark arts<br>behind the scenes to make sure that this<br>got off the ground to our professor<br>Helen Nicholson and celt for<br>spearheading this initiative<br>and also to our audience here in the<br>room thank you for coming along it's<br>nice to see some faces uh in the room<br>into everyone who's joined and to all of<br>you who are watching in the future as<br>well thank you for engaging with this<br>content and lastly of course thank you<br>very much to my wonderful panel uh three<br>uh engaged<br>um interested uh academics who have<br>students at heart I think in the core of<br>everything you're doing so I think if<br>you're uh work on the project and your<br>input today so<br>um with that uh look out for some<br>communication about uh the videos that<br>will have come out of today which will<br>go up on the uh called our website so<br>there'll be some communication coming<br>through the normal university channels<br>about where to find that material<br>um if you're interested in hearing more<br>about the call oer Project you can<br>contact me Richard white or my colleague<br>Kate Thompson from the law library<br>uh or check to your subject librarian<br>initially would be a great place to<br>start as well<br>um and we can talk to you about what the<br>project is and how you can get involved<br>if that's what you want to do having<br>been inspired by these three here today<br>um there'll also be some uh training and<br>information sessions to look out for<br>through those normal uh uh communication<br>channels if you want to find out more<br>um so uh the last thing for me to<br>mention is that as I said this is uh the<br>first in a series of uh quite a little<br>about different topics and how I'm<br>referred to that and her thing at the<br>start so the next one I'll seem to be<br>wanting to tune in for this one is the<br>implications of AI and higher education<br>which we're all talking about at the<br>moment I actually originally got GPT to<br>write my introduction for today that I<br>did I did toss-up and use my own one in<br>the end because it it made up a whole<br>um so anyway with that uh got up to my<br>panel uh and Tina Colton to everyone<br>watching thank you very much and we'll<br>foreign</p></main><footer style="margin-top: 2rem;
