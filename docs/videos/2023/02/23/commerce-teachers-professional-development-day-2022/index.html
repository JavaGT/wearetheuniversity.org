little bit but<br>you'll see we've got quite another quite<br>a education and teaching of Commerce<br>theme to our program today and this is<br>really important because<br>um not only is this the 125th year of<br>Victoria University of Wellington<br>teharanga Waka<br>um it's also an opportunity for us to<br>reflect back on what we've achieved but<br>also to think about kind of what we want<br>to be into the future and here in the<br>Wellington School of Business and<br>government we're doing a lot of Forward<br>Thinking at the moment and you'll hear<br>about some of that as we go through the<br>day now for all of it it's been another<br>eventful year as we've grappled with<br>covid if we'd have been here in February<br>to be honest we probably wouldn't have<br>been in here because you might remember<br>but the protesters camped outside across<br>the campus so we've been doing a few<br>kind of we've started our kind of you<br>know end of year functions and we're<br>really remembering kind of all the<br>things that have that our staff but also<br>our students have been through this year<br>and I'd like to acknowledge that<br>challenge that you've had as Educators<br>but also your students as well<br>but we've had lots to celebrate as well<br>we've had lots of research successes<br>we've just had um one of our staff from<br>the uh the business school has won a<br>national tertiary teachers award uh<br>associate professor Christine shot who<br>some of you might have remembered from I<br>think it was last year that he presented<br>around sustainability and sustainable<br>development goals<br>um we've also been doing a lot of work<br>to start thinking so we're also<br>celebrating our re-accreditation by<br>Equus which is one of the international<br>sort of business accreditation standards<br>which means that we've had an<br>International Panel who<br>being with us well being with us<br>virtually which meant that kind of the<br>visit was quite late in the evening for<br>us as they were across the globe and<br>they've looked across our programs and<br>given us another sort of stump of<br>approval but also encouraged us to think<br>about some other developments that we<br>might do over the next few years<br>and two of those that um we've already<br>started are going to feature in the<br>program today I'm the associate dean of<br>learning and teaching acting actually<br>thank you I'm current I must say I know<br>quite a few of you from previous years<br>and I'm going to be here all today as<br>your MC and so if you need anything do<br>give me a shout out I'm also joined here<br>in the room by Jose who you'll hear a<br>little bit from later on in the day he's<br>part of our future students team and so<br>he's one of the team who come out and<br>spent time in schools with uh students<br>looking at options in terms of studying<br>he's going to talk to you a little bit<br>uh later give you a bit of an update on<br>what we're doing in our programs but<br>he's also going to be here managing the<br>chat with online so<br>um those of you online if you do have<br>any questions please pop them in there<br>and Jose can either um we can either put<br>you on put your microphone on or Jose<br>can push uh share those back with the<br>Border Room as well<br>but it's really exciting to be the<br>associating of learning and teaching at<br>the moment because there's a lot of<br>focus at the moment not only just on<br>what we learn but also how we learn and<br>I'm sure you've been grappling with many<br>of the same things thinking about what<br>is it that we add as teachers as<br>Educators that we add value to in our<br>students lives so we're doing some work<br>at the moment where we're actually<br>thinking about how we want to be<br>teaching in in the next five to ten<br>years thinking about as a school of<br>business and government what does that<br>mean for the experiences that our<br>students have at undergraduate and<br>postgraduate level and what it means to<br>be in the classroom when many of our<br>students like many of you joining today<br>or online as well<br>we're also doing a piece of work that is<br>a refresh of our Bachelor of Commerce<br>and you'll hear a little bit later from<br>Jose that this is our undergraduate<br>tourism sorry undergraduate I teach<br>tourism management it was a slip of the<br>tongue our undergraduate Bachelor of<br>Commerce it's our undergraduate degree<br>which has a range of different uh Majors<br>including tourism management<br>um but we're it's time we think it's<br>really sort of timely to be looking at<br>what we do in our Bachelor of Commerce<br>and we're going to get you involved<br>because actually you're a really key<br>part of the journey that our young<br>people take in terms of transitioning<br>from at school into tertiary education<br>so um I've got a few slides to start us<br>off the first couple<br>are basically some welcomes so these are<br>those who've registered on the left of<br>those in the room and obviously we've<br>got some good turnout from some of our<br>larger schools but also across there's<br>also you spotting yourselves now also<br>like to make a particular welcome we've<br>got a couple of uh<br>um uh training teachers to be in here<br>doing a initial teacher education as<br>well so welcome particularly uh to you<br>and then on the right in blue are all of<br>those who have registered to join us<br>online at various points during the day<br>I'd particularly like to say Cura and a<br>shout out to those in Auckland and<br>Christchurch unfortunately we weren't<br>able to make it to either place this<br>year<br>um in person I think in the end we got<br>defeated by the number of Accord days<br>that are currently happening in term<br>four and we just couldn't make it work<br>to actually be able to have enough<br>people and attend in person in<br>Canterbury and Auckland but we're really<br>excited and we hope to be back with you<br>in 20<br>um 23.<br>so we've got I think a really exciting<br>uh day ahead<br>um many of you are absolutely fantastic<br>it's giving us feedback about these<br>events and I kind of take away from<br>um all of the feedback that since the<br>four years I think now I've been<br>involved so a couple of things that<br>always come out<br>one is if is the value of a first<br>Speaker who will introduce in a moment<br>but the importance of our government<br>speaker giving an Insight from the<br>government's perspective about the New<br>Zealand economic Trends that's the first<br>thing we try and lock into our program<br>because we know that's highly valued<br>the um other things that oh I'm just<br>think we've lost is that okay<br>um after we've heard from uh Peter we're<br>going to have a morning tea and all of<br>our catering today is on the mezzanine<br>floor so just one floor down<br>um from here<br>and then through the rest of the day<br>we've got a bit of a sort of a business<br>education Focus to today so at 11AM we<br>have a panel looking at entrepreneurship<br>education at University and how we can<br>better connect the platform Secondary<br>School<br>um to opportunities here at tertiary not<br>just for Commerce students in fact one<br>of our speakers Ava is actually studying<br>um elsewhere in the University but is<br>part of our community of entrepreneurs<br>so that discussion is going to be led by<br>Dr Jesse farini who is the director of<br>the atom Innovation space here at the<br>Wellington School of Business and<br>government some of you who've joined us<br>in previous years we've became we've one<br>year we had lunch down there it's in the<br>space that you came past as you came<br>into bunny Street and as Jesse will tell<br>and Anita who is our entrepreneurship<br>and Community manager will tell you it's<br>a space for entrepreneur young<br>entrepreneurs on our in our student<br>Community to get involved and have<br>support and we've got some exciting<br>opportunities I think which will better<br>link that to the entrepreneurship<br>activity that you're already doing um<br>with your students at secondary level<br>uh Jose is then going to give us a<br>little bit of an update on The Bachelor<br>of Commerce and what sort of some of the<br>things that we're doing<br>um in that space and then we'll break<br>for lunch at 12 15. then when we're back<br>here at one o'clock we'll be joined by<br>my colleague associate Dean students Dr<br>Alan Sylvester talking to you about some<br>of the big com activities and and<br>getting your input into these<br>co-designing a junior business challenge<br>so I'll let him tell you a little bit<br>more about that later and then we're<br>going to be finished in a day with my<br>colleague Fong from the school of<br>accounting and commercial law and she's<br>going to be talking about accounting and<br>finance education in a digital age so<br>one of the feedback we get is we always<br>value the economic update from<br>government the other thing that we<br>always get is that it's really great to<br>sort of Hit the different aspects of the<br>work that you do so if you're an<br>economist if you teach mainly economics<br>or counting or business studies<br>hopefully we've got something in there<br>for<br>um each of your different areas<br>and then we aim to kind of start<br>wrapping up at 2 30 and have you<br>finished by 2 45 so that's our program<br>for the day any questions before we get<br>started<br>so I'm very excited to welcome our first<br>Speaker uh Peter Gardner and he is an<br>economist and manager of the treasuries<br>forecasting modeling and research team<br>um in this role Peter oversees the<br>production of the treasury's<br>macroeconomic and tax forecasts which<br>are published twice a yearly alongside<br>the government's budget in May and<br>December so coming up to a busy time of<br>the year again for um for Peter's team<br>he has over 20 years experiences and<br>applied Economist and previously work at<br>NZ ier and the ANZ economic research<br>team as well as a broad experience<br>across the public sector Peter it's<br>really exciting that you could join us<br>uh today hopefully your slides will just<br>click through uh using this and I'll<br>just get you to pop your microphone on<br>so those who are online can also hear<br>you I'll just get Peter to come up and<br>just make sure he's all set up and then<br>we'll get going<br>I've pressed the button that seems to be<br>just gonna get myself a drink<br>um and while I'm doing that I might just<br>make a few introductions so<br>thank you for the generous introduction<br>Karen<br>um I want to go a little bit further<br>back though I want to tell you<br>that I went to wairarapa college and<br>um I was taught economics by Tom Helena<br>and accountancy by Brett Anderson those<br>names may not mean a lot to people who<br>are outside the War app but there were<br>store lots of work or rugby and I think<br>Brett Henderson played one test match<br>for New Zealand as a<br>um as a junior all black in 1987<br>tour of Japan or something like that<br>um in addition uh so I actually live in<br>the wairarapa and I was driving over<br>this morning and stuck in traffic and I<br>contacted the um<br>contacted the organizers suggesting that<br>I might be a bit late uh if the<br>pessimist as an economist is uh and<br>there's a and as a forecaster I think it<br>just sort of highlights just how wrong<br>I've been over the last couple of years<br>so I made it in time<br>a couple of other things that I want to<br>sort of talk about before we get into<br>the presentation today we've got 45<br>minutes I'm not expecting to take all of<br>those 45 minutes thankfully so there<br>should be a bit of time for questions<br>um I've also got some questions of you<br>that I'd like to ask you about you know<br>where have all the economics graduates<br>gone so we'll get to that hopefully at<br>the end<br>um<br>I am in the middle of producing a set of<br>economic forecasts and we're going to<br>publish those in mid December so I'm not<br>going to speak directly about those<br>thankfully though the reserve banks<br>released uh their latest MPS and that<br>will be a bit of a reference for my<br>discussion today so that's kind of<br>helpful<br>um the other thing that I'm going to<br>just reflect on a wee bit is some of the<br>anecdote that we've heard from<br>businesses as we've gone into updating<br>our economic forecasts<br>now the other thing I just want to let<br>you know before we begin is that I don't<br>do a lot of presentations<br>um Dom<br>um<br>I'm our chief economic advisor he<br>usually does presentations like this and<br>he used to be the chief Economist at the<br>uh at Westpac and he's very good at<br>communicating<br>um I'm a little bit more<br>um introverted and less comfortable<br>being up on stage than he is<br>um so anyway I asked him for some tips<br>and advice a couple of months ago and he<br>said yep sure Peter I'll be able to help<br>you with that<br>since then we haven't talked about it<br>once but he's<br>um<br>he's given me five presentations to do<br>this is I think the third of them uh so<br>I don't think that's exactly what I had<br>in mind when I asked for some<br>professional development but here we are<br>um<br>I'm going to get started uh hopefully<br>that button yeah so I'm going to start<br>with the key points for the presentation<br>and then I want to go in and elaborate<br>on some of the the reasons why we think<br>um firstly the economy's got to this<br>point and what we think is in store for<br>the economy over the next 12 to 18<br>months<br>so the first thing I want you to know is<br>that<br>there are a number of reasons why we<br>think that the strong momentum in the<br>economy the the economy actually fared<br>pretty well through covert uh and then<br>the first half of the year is recovered<br>you know quite well and that momentum<br>seems to be seems to be continuing on<br>we have pricing pressure and we can see<br>that it's pretty intense with the rate<br>of inflation and some other indicators<br>there that I'll talk about uh the labor<br>market is extremely tight so wage<br>pressure is is building and unemployment<br>remains at a fairly well near historical<br>low<br>um and<br>I guess one of the key things and I will<br>elaborate on this a little bit more is<br>that tradable inflation remains<br>relatively persistent now that reflects<br>both Global price pressures and supply<br>and demand constraints<br>um as well as a low exchange rate<br>so with high inflation<br>we've needed to all of them the reserve<br>Bankers needed to raise interest rates<br>and we've seen policy rates rise quite<br>sharply uh and The Reserve Bank has<br>indicated that there's still more to do<br>so with that we do anticipate that<br>activity will ease and that will lower<br>demand for labor and eventually lift<br>unemployment there are some risks around<br>some of these things I'm also going to<br>elaborate on some of those things as<br>well<br>right so the first thing I want to talk<br>a little bit about is inflation<br>so as I talked about the the New Zealand<br>economy navigated<br>um Navigator covert extremely well it<br>was supported by both fiscal and<br>monetary policy<br>and what we've seen in addition is a<br>number of Supply constraints emerge both<br>domestically and internationally and<br>that's given rise to inflation<br>so inflation is at a near three decade<br>High<br>um I think at last was above seven<br>percent and the<br>um early 1990s and inflation hit around<br>just under 19 in 1987. I got still at<br>high school then<br>um<br>there are a number of factors going on<br>here so domestically supply and demand<br>imbalances have seen prices also if you<br>look at and the inflation outturn you'll<br>see that a lot of<br>um you know a lot of growth and prices<br>of fruit and veg<br>um<br>construction prices<br>and more recently the cost of travel has<br>increased quite considerably<br>internationally and I guess you guys<br>have if you've traveled from overseas<br>you uh over the country you would have<br>uh sort of felt that in your ear if<br>process uh if EF is internationally the<br>the cost of oil remains elevated and<br>that's contributing to the cost of<br>production for a whole range of goods<br>um but as policy Works its course we do<br>expect inflation to moderate<br>foreign<br>thing I just wanted well the two things<br>I wanted to draw your attention to here<br>is um the first chart on the the left<br>there I mean that shows the blue line<br>which is our current inflation but it's<br>the underlying or expected measures of<br>inflation that the Reserve Bank worry<br>most about so the next lie down that<br>they run on about six percent is<br>um that's the expectations when you're<br>ahead or pricing expectations when<br>you're ahead and the dotted blue line<br>should be oh no<br>and I got it wrong<br>um the rbnz measure of core inflation so<br>this is when you strip out all of the<br>one-off price movements the underlying<br>or the the common movement in prices is<br>still a well above what the The Reserve<br>Bank is targeting so Reserve Bank<br>targets uh between one and three percent<br>and they won't be satisfied until that's<br>the expectations in particular heading<br>below that the top of the the band that<br>they target<br>looking a little bit more forward you<br>can see here I mean this is an earlier<br>forecast that we produced about so it's<br>an update from budget but it is in our<br>latest forecasts<br>um and what I'd just like you to sort of<br>recognize here is that we we do foresee<br>a reasonably persistent<br>um tradables inflation Outlook<br>um and non-tradables which is domestic<br>inflation<br>um that's also persistent but<br>um as Supply constraints correct<br>particularly internationally we expect<br>um<br>some of those current inflation factors<br>or some of the factors driving inflation<br>to to unwind<br>so the international scene is adding to<br>domestic inflation I've kind of made<br>that point<br>what I want to do is now illustrate a<br>little bit of the thinking behind that<br>and I think it's quite well illustrated<br>by the the first chart on the left there<br>which is terms of trade so that's the<br>price of imports and the price of<br>exports and what that shows you is that<br>both important export prices through<br>covert lifted dramatically and<br>they are still at a very elevated level<br>that coupled with Supply constraints<br>that led to freight costs<br>internationally going up three four-fold<br>really was the story behind<br>um the strong boost in tradables<br>inflation<br>when we look forward<br>there are a number of factors still<br>playing out in in the international<br>scene which we think are going to lead<br>to both Import and Export prices<br>remaining quite elevated there might be<br>a little bit of a cycle we might see the<br>terms of trade cycle down soon<br>but historically input prices are going<br>to stay relatively relatively elevated<br>partly because the supply and demand<br>imbalances with oil and oil producing<br>economies have pulled back some of their<br>production because they quite like high<br>prices<br>um and just unwinding some of the the<br>additional Supply constraints so one of<br>the things that we heard from<br>um firms when we went and talked to them<br>and in particular<br>um importing firms is that they might<br>have locked in Fairly favorable<br>contracts through the covert period but<br>as those contracts are now winding off<br>they're faced with some reasonably large<br>increases in contract prices<br>particularly out of China for example<br>and whilst we have seen some of the the<br>freight indexes that we look at decrease<br>the cost of<br>the cost of Transport between New<br>Zealand and the world hasn't gone down<br>quite so much<br>and of course the other thing that's<br>also keeping import prices elevated is<br>the the terms of trade<br>so part of the the reason why the terms<br>of well the the terms of sorry the<br>exchange rate<br>um part of the reason why the exchange<br>rate has depreciated against most<br>economies is<br>um is what's happening in the US and<br>with interest rates going up in the US<br>money is piling into the U.S financial<br>Market which then causes a depreciation<br>in New Zealand dollar so that's making<br>it more expensive for imported goods<br>into New Zealand on the flip side I<br>guess it does support export prices uh<br>because we're getting more more money<br>for goods that we're selling overseas<br>okay<br>so strong and strong inflation outturns<br>have seen the Reserve Bank lift the OCR<br>by 350 basis points in the last 12<br>months<br>but they Rose 75 basis points last week<br>and now so that 4.25 The Reserve Bank<br>said that they would like to see would<br>probably expect to lift um<br>the icr by another 75 basis points so it<br>could top out at around<br>five and a half percent the OCR<br>now I<br>I just want to<br>give people a little bit of insight into<br>how markets react when<br>um<br>when we're thinking about inflation and<br>inflation Dynamics and what the reserve<br>bank's thinking so the first couple of<br>lines here<br>I'm going to show you where Market<br>expectations were of the 90-day rate or<br>the OCR prior to the latest inflation<br>outturn so everyone expected inflation<br>to have peaked in the June quarter<br>around 7.3 percent<br>came out above expectations and<br>um only<br>fell slightly to 7.2 when markets had<br>anticipated<br>um inflation come out at around 6.7 what<br>that meant was that<br>everyone started then pricing in what<br>the Reserve Bank would do in light of<br>the fact that you've got a stronger<br>inflation option and you can see here<br>that<br>um<br>host the CPA upturn on the 19th of<br>October Market expectations went up to<br>about five and a half percent and they<br>tracked down to just over five percent<br>or just under five percent of at the<br>start of November and then the Reserve<br>Bank came out and said a fairly clear<br>message that inflation is a problem and<br>we need to deal with it and we're going<br>to aggressively continue to increase<br>interest rates<br>what that means though is that<br>within rise in interest rates we do<br>expect the economy to slide now I want<br>to say at the out outset now that at the<br>moment<br>whilst there are elements within the<br>economy where we can see some slowing<br>and the effects of interest rates<br>overall there are strong momentum in the<br>economy and we haven't reached that<br>Turning Point yet I think it surprised<br>most economists<br>um because with the rise of interest<br>rates as much as we've seen we we<br>thought some of those interest rates<br>sensitive sectors of the economy would<br>react and that would lead to reductions<br>in consumption<br>so what's going on now and why haven't<br>we seen that reduction in activity as we<br>economists might have anticipated well<br>there's a couple of things going on one<br>I've already talked to but one I'm just<br>going to mention briefly and that's<br>through covert a lot of households<br>managed and and ferns actually managed<br>to create<br>um pretty good savings buffer so if we<br>look at the tax data we saw<br>evidence that business profits were<br>extremely high over that period of time<br>and when we look at savings data we can<br>see that you know collectively New<br>Zealand households have actually built<br>up<br>um you know a reasonable amount of<br>savings which is a bit of a buffer for<br>the consumption<br>um the other thing that's<br>um sort of offsets the slowing in the<br>economy that we might have anticipated<br>is the opening of the borders and the<br>strong increase in tourism numbers that<br>we've seen in the last six months<br>um and I think that what whilst we<br>anticipated that I think that's also<br>supported the economy and in particular<br>we can see the shifts in demand away<br>from goods and into services and that<br>that I think also reflects the the<br>strong rise and tourism that we've we've<br>seen today<br>so there's a couple of reasons why we<br>haven't yet seen the turning point that<br>we might have expected and and also<br>um<br>and<br>there's another point I was going to<br>make but if it's now sort of left me<br>um<br>no some of the risks I guess some of the<br>risks to the Slowdown that we might<br>expect that's right<br>okay so now let's look a little bit<br>closer at why we think<br>um the economy will slow and it does<br>feel a little bit odd talking about a<br>slowing economy when we've got such<br>strong demand at the moment<br>one of the key features here is and<br>house prices and its relationship to<br>um<br>to interest rates<br>so interest rates have risen as we've<br>talked a wee bit about<br>um to date house prices have declined by<br>about 12 percent<br>more in real terms and we anticipate<br>that over the next 12 months they might<br>fall by another eight percent so in<br>total around 20 decline in nominal house<br>prices that's quite a lot<br>um the surprising thing here is that<br>with the decline of house prices we<br>haven't seen a corresponding decrease in<br>residential investment activity so this<br>chart here just highlights the fact that<br>you know we saw<br>residential investment decreased quite<br>sharply during covert then it's<br>increased quite strongly and it's just<br>maintained to that level now back in<br>budget we were hearing quite clearly<br>from businesses<br>um or investment<br>um<br>you know business businesses and the<br>residential investment sector anyway<br>um that they were going to continue to<br>continue to build we don't think that's<br>necessarily the case but we do think<br>that there was a little bit of continued<br>momentum from the strong consents that<br>we've seen over the last 12 to 18 months<br>so in the previous government<br>the national government I used to talk<br>to the Minister of Finance<br>semi-regularly about<br>the outlook for residential investment<br>and I had a bet with him that<br>um consents which were about 32 000 at<br>the time would never reach thirty five<br>thousand I lost the bet and today<br>um residential consents are over 50 000.<br>so that just gives you a little bit of<br>an indication of just how much pressure<br>there is within the the residential um<br>construction sector<br>a strong demand for<br>um<br>strong demand for labor and highly<br>skilled labor at that<br>and with Supply constraints you can<br>understand why material prices in the<br>construction sector have just gone up so<br>much<br>probably all we want to say yeah<br>so the next chart here and and so we're<br>going to go from interest rates<br>so house prices and now I want to talk<br>about the role of house prices in<br>particular and its impact on consumption<br>so consumption domestic consumption<br>household consumption is two-thirds of<br>the New Zealand economy so it's a fairly<br>significant important significant and<br>important part of the New Zealand<br>economy<br>um and I think there are there are two<br>aspects of this that at least macro<br>economists would think about firstly we<br>think about interest rates and its<br>impact on wealth and that's through<br>um house prices in particular so a lot<br>of households have a lot of their wealth<br>accumulated in the house that they might<br>own and the first shot on the left there<br>just illustrates the<br>the relationship between interest rate<br>movements and house price movements<br>so that's the first thing I want you to<br>take from that point the second point I<br>just want to sort of sort of let you<br>focus in on that the last<br>sort of years here<br>and it shows you there that the strong<br>increase in<br>um interest rates has seen quite a<br>strong decrease in house prices<br>so there's been a strong decrease in at<br>least the wealth that people may feel<br>that they have in their<br>and yeah in the household<br>and we know that there's a strong<br>correlation between wealth and<br>consumption because people borrow<br>against the the price of their house so<br>that's the first point the second point<br>that it also impacts on budgets so we<br>know with higher inflation<br>um<br>we we are seeing that households are<br>budget constrained<br>um but there are some reasons why we<br>haven't seen that materially affect<br>consumption yet we talked about buffers<br>and the role of the labor market in<br>particular<br>um but eventually higher interest rates<br>will<br>um will be binding in the in the context<br>of the household budget and that draws<br>me to the the second chart here that<br>I've got so what this chart tries to<br>illustrate well what it is first of all<br>it's the weighted average of all<br>um mortgages at various terms and their<br>the weighted average of the<br>um the interest rate the mortgage<br>interest rate that people have<br>so we can see that that's increased from<br>just under four percent about 12 to 18<br>months ago to just over five percent now<br>with the Reserve Bank indicating that<br>the OCR will will go to around five and<br>a half percent that implies that<br>mortgage interest rates will probably<br>Peak at around seven and a half eight<br>percent something that we haven't seen<br>since um the late 90s and when you<br>calculate the the weighted average<br>mortgage<br>for all mortgage holders in New Zealand<br>it suggests that it will probably Peak<br>at around seven percent so the reserve<br>bank's probably done about half their<br>job but they've still got another<br>two percentage or 200 basis points two<br>percentage points to go and raising the<br>average well the weighted average<br>mortgage rate and so that is going to<br>hit<br>um households particularly those budget<br>constraint households and if you read<br>the Press from last week there is some<br>concern that the Reserve Bank has for<br>those people that might have been first<br>home owners in the last 12 months who<br>have got you know<br>um potentially in in sort of negative<br>so<br>this was probably the most consistent<br>bit of feedback that we had from<br>businesses right throughout New Zealand<br>um irrespective of which sectors they<br>were um<br>labor market conditions are the tightest<br>that they've ever experienced and what<br>we typically know is that demand<br>uh demands for goods and services is the<br>one thing that businesses report as the<br>the largest constraint on their activity<br>what we're hearing quite consistently is<br>that it's access to Skilled and<br>unskilled labor that's the one thing<br>um<br>the one thing and okay so the couple of<br>things one we've seen<br>uh quite a strong increase in wage<br>inflation a lot of that has been<br>um private sector wage inflation to date<br>so that's traveling at about twice the<br>pace of government sector wage inflation<br>um<br>the other thing is that<br>as demand for labor reduces it may not<br>necessarily result in a lift in<br>um<br>are left in the unemployment rate as as<br>we might normally expect so when we<br>think about this in a forecasting sense<br>we we look at relationships like oaken's<br>law which is the race relationship<br>between output and unemployment or the<br>inverse relationship between output and<br>unemployment<br>um and what we would what we what that's<br>what that relationship suggests is that<br>unemployment will will potentially rise<br>to above five percent<br>but the starting conditions are a little<br>bit different and what we may see is so<br>we're right up the top of the beverage<br>curve<br>um and so what that might so what we<br>might then see is that there's just a<br>simple Demar uh<br>a reduction in the demand for labor so<br>we might see reduction in vacancies<br>rather than an increase in unemployment<br>but we do anticipate nonetheless that as<br>the economy does slow that that will<br>translate into<br>um weaker Unemployment uh weaker<br>employment<br>now I'm going to finish with a couple of<br>slides on the international scene<br>um I think it will be common knowledge<br>amongst you or you professionals<br>um that<br>what's happening in New Zealand isn't<br>um specific to New Zealand and this is a<br>global a global thing<br>so<br>um<br>inflation has reached multi-decade highs<br>in most Western countries<br>and that's prompted central banks all<br>across the globe to increase their<br>policy rates<br>um as they aggressively try to combat<br>inflation<br>a number of uh economies including the<br>US and Australia in particular have<br>signaled<br>um a slowing in their increases in<br>interest rates I think it remains to be<br>seen that there was some positive<br>um some positive inflation<br>um data out of the us yesterday or last<br>week I don't think we've quite seen the<br>end of inflation in Australia so I will<br>be interested to see if the RBA<br>continues<br>um<br>um this slowing and<br>slowing in the increase of their<br>interest rates but I mean time will only<br>so we look at the global Outlook it does<br>look in fact pretty gloomy<br>um the imf's most recent forecasts<br>suggested that there was a 25 risk of a<br>global and Global recession<br>now what that translates to in growth is<br>growth<br>Global growth<br>below two percent<br>when you think of an economy like Japan<br>that would typically grow at six and a<br>half seven percent<br>um and they're not without their own<br>issues I'm going to talk that in a<br>minute<br>um<br>you can see that that's quite a Slowdown<br>and World activity<br>so the three factors there that are<br>going on and I I'm probably just<br>repeating myself for those in the room<br>that will really know this<br>um the Russian invasion of Ukraine so<br>Energy prices particularly in Europe are<br>incredibly high and that's Weighing on<br>um it's also contributing to the the<br>um High Global inflation as a<br>consequence what was that<br>right and we've talked a little bit<br>about the you know inflation and um<br>increases in policy rates and the last<br>issue and it's something that's probably<br>less talked about is the the risk to<br>China<br>so China have been persisting with a<br>zero covert policy uh locking down<br>cities and restricting people's<br>movements and all those sorts of things<br>I think that they are likely to unwind<br>that but it's going to take another<br>three to six months and in the meantime<br>the effects of slowing China on<br>intra-industry trade and you know<br>directly demand for New Zealand's goods<br>and services<br>something to to bear in mind the other<br>thing is<br>the housing and investment issues in<br>in China so a lot of large residential<br>investment firms are near insolvent and<br>they are currently supported by the by<br>the central bank<br>um and so that that there's quite a bit<br>of risk around the the residential<br>investment sector within China<br>China's a little bit of an unknown<br>because there's such a massive saver and<br>they can probably just<br>um sort of use some of their savings<br>buffers to manage through that but it<br>certainly is is a bit of a risk for the<br>Outlook<br>so look uh<br>nope<br>back on there try that now<br>all right yep so there we go there's my<br>summary New Zealand economy still has<br>momentum and we're yet to reach that<br>Turning Point<br>but inflation is built up ahead of steam<br>policy rates have increased considerably<br>um to try and help cool down inflation<br>that will lead to an easing and growth<br>and a rise in the implant so that's a<br>quick summary for me I think we might<br>stop there and we can just have a<br>general discussion<br>um<br>I'm happily uh happy to ask any answer<br>any questions uh and then I want to come<br>back to a question that I have for you<br>for you guys<br>can I just say whilst we're moving to<br>the question time on your tables you've<br>got a sort of a spiciness looking little<br>sort of unit and if you're asking a<br>question could you just click in the<br>middle of the unit so it turns green and<br>that will enable our online<br>participants to also hear your question<br>um as well and then obviously if anyone<br>online has got a question pop your hand<br>right<br>answer your question and he'll pick up<br>first of all thank you Peter that was<br>great that was really great<br>um the question that I'm intrigued by is<br>actually looking at your summary slide<br>reminds me of the argument that we have<br>two economies there's Auckland and<br>there's the rest of the country<br>right<br>um is there going to be big Regional and<br>sector differences in how you think this<br>might play out<br>yeah good question<br>um<br>so yes in a sense so I think one of the<br>things that we uh if you're trying to do<br>a little bit of work on and try to help<br>the government understand uh some of the<br>sexual differences that we see at a<br>regional level<br>so one of the things that we saw through<br>covert was the the hollowing out of the<br>the tourism industry and that had quite<br>a profound impact on some of those<br>tourism-related Industries uh regions<br>like Queenstown but not just Queenstown<br>just outside of the normal<br>um so as the economy cools down it's<br>likely to be some of the more interest<br>rate sensitive sectors that get felt<br>first so construction and some of those<br>types of areas<br>um that seems to be broadly across New<br>Zealand but you know the strong<br>residential investment and Christchurch<br>Wellington and Auckland<br>um so there will be some Regional<br>disparities<br>um<br>how it all plays out will really come<br>back to the the impact of<br>you know slow down and domestic<br>consumption on those Regional economies<br>and what exposure some of them have to<br>particular sectors<br>is that answer your your question<br>doesn't quite get at the the two-tone<br>economy thing but I just want to paint a<br>sort of wider picture there well I'd be<br>particularly<br>Regional economy you know the aggregate<br>you know Agricultural and exports how<br>are they going to fail yeah so there's a<br>couple of things going on there one I<br>don't think we've had a particularly<br>good growing season and if you look at<br>the um the forecast production for dairy<br>um it's down about five percent on last<br>year I think I recall<br>um now that may in fact end up<br>supporting dairy prices because as<br>demanded as and we've seen dairy prices<br>come off about 33 percent<br>and World terms in the last 12 months<br>but<br>um not so much in New Zealand dollar<br>terms because of the depreciation and<br>the exchange rate that will potentially<br>have an impact on Farmer income which<br>will also then have some sort of<br>implications for demand demand in the<br>economy<br>so in terms of trade probably matters<br>quite importantly for<br>um you know rural economies and and<br>and the Outlook there<br>um what's happening to<br>more urban economies I think it's more<br>about the role of interest rates and<br>hi<br>it is globally we are seeing every<br>country is using demand side policies to<br>battle High inflation but we all know<br>that inflation is caused by too much<br>money chasing to feel good so why<br>there's a supply side policy that's<br>trying to be used by the government yeah<br>and supply side policies you're right<br>um I mean we've got a lot of<br>Supply imbalances at the moment and<br>they're just harder to resolve right I<br>think that's the the key thing so we<br>know that we need well<br>we know that there are some play side<br>factors that have led us to higher<br>inflation<br>but demand is rampant at the moment or<br>it has been rampant at the moment so the<br>Reserve Bank that reserve banks are all<br>over the world that's why they but<br>they're wanting to bring demand more on<br>balance with Supply<br>um that's not to say that supply side<br>um<br>supply side policies aren't appropriate<br>but I think they're more of a longer<br>term solution so when we think about<br>supply side uh policies we we're talking<br>more about the longer term impacts on<br>productivity<br>um and those sorts of sorts of things<br>that might enhance productivity over the<br>long term like investing in education<br>infrastructure and some of those sorts<br>of things<br>foreign<br>weather events sort of linking to that<br>Growing System I do as well how that's<br>factoring into your forecast I know one<br>of the regions down on marble sounds<br>recently for a school trip and you could<br>barely access some of those places<br>because of the landslides not even<br>planning on just abandoning some of the<br>roads out there so yeah how you would<br>see that affecting into the future<br>outlook yeah so<br>we are doing some work on the impact of<br>climate change<br>um it's still early days the way that we<br>would think about it typically is<br>um so we when we forecast we think about<br>Trends and Cycles so the impacts of<br>climate change or climate change policy<br>maybe may have a long-term impact impact<br>on the trends so we might adjust some of<br>our long-term thinking around the trend<br>for exports or something like that<br>um where we think about the role of<br>weather events is more in sort of the<br>cyclical sort of the cyclical factors<br>that might underpin a forecast<br>um had to forecast the economy you'd<br>alone weather events so<br>I typically get both very wrong but<br>where we can see good evidence like<br>um you know poor growing seasons and its<br>impact on Dairy we'll factor that into<br>some of our near-term thinking around<br>the the strength of<br>um export growth or something like that<br>that kind of gives you a bit of an<br>insight into the way that we might think<br>about it<br>Peter thanks again I thought it was just<br>awesome<br>um a lot of your presentation focused on<br>monetary policy<br>um and you know the use of the interest<br>rate to influence or to start<br>basing your forecast on and there was<br>not that much mention of fiscal policy<br>even though you did say um New Zealand<br>navigated covert very well obviously<br>that was a result of both monetary and<br>fiscal policy<br>um so I'm just interested in in your<br>guys thoughts about where fiscal policy<br>can go over the next couple of years<br>yeah so it doesn't really show up here<br>but what I wanted to try and draw your<br>attention to I maybe just explain it<br>anyway<br>um is that you know we saw 50 billion<br>dollars injected into the economy to<br>support people's attachment to the labor<br>market and you know firms through them<br>um and that's LED in conjunction with<br>loosening and monetary policy<br>um stronger inflation and strong<br>activity<br>um<br>the unwind of covert spending will<br>actually contribute to the slowing down<br>of the New Zealand economy so that's<br>part of it but also the government's<br>having to think really hard about the<br>impact of inflation on government<br>services so the government has fixed<br>non-normal baselines and that's the way<br>that they think about their budgets and<br>so I've got some hard thinking to do<br>around whether or not with high<br>inflation<br>real government expenditure will<br>decrease or how much it might decrease<br>with our fixed nominal baselines<br>or whether or not they're going to<br>increase their allowances and the<br>spending that they might<br>um that they might um<br>Will Shadow in the next budget<br>which may have some<br>unintended consequences on monetary<br>policy so I think that's a real tension<br>that the government's going to have to<br>kind of walk over the next<br>certainly the next budget cycle we'll<br>see another budget it's from mayish I<br>guess next year and we'll get their<br>intentions<br>um yeah I think they're also going to be<br>challenged in an election year<br>um so I think you know we've got<br>High inflation fixed nominal baselines<br>um<br>a monetary policy slowing in the economy<br>and the school policy I think the<br>Reserve Bank Governor said fiscal policy<br>needs uh monetary policy needs Brands<br>um and so yes the Physical policy<br>interacts with monetary policy it's<br>going to be a bit of a tough question to<br>hi yeah um I was just wondering the you<br>saw a talk about interest rates is the<br>key thing to slow down<br>um the economy I was just wondering<br>about things like the other thing the<br>government could do was through taxation<br>to slow down the economy as well but<br>what would be your opinion on okay an<br>increase in tax uh capital gains tax I<br>was actually going to ask you about but<br>what would your opinion be on something<br>like a capital gains tax because because<br>interest rates do tend to hit uh you<br>know first form buyers and people that<br>got very hard well a capital gains tax<br>will be something that would uh hit the<br>economy in a different a different<br>sector yeah the tax working group a few<br>years ago before covert I think<br>advocated for a um capital gains tax<br>there's good reasons for it<br>um so talking as Economist not as a<br>treasury official<br>um I like you know efficiency and<br>fairness and our tax system at the<br>moment is a little bit unbalanced<br>because it doesn't have a capital gains<br>tax doesn't it so doing something around<br>that would make accents from Pure<br>it's hard though because you know our<br>tax base is largely you know personal<br>income tax<br>um and business tax I mean that makes up<br>the tax base so shifting<br>to capital gains would they want to give<br>something up and how would they do that<br>and get it all balanced as I think a a<br>difficult political question that I'm<br>or by stealth though in terms of bright<br>line moving and things like that it<br>looks like as you're the gradual<br>collection yeah they<br>probably the labor government wasn't<br>stealth-like in the way that it<br>introduced the brightland test a week<br>while ago but I think national<br>government have said that they might<br>remove it or something I think that's an<br>election year<br>party in sort of a debate not one that<br>I'm really<br>of money The Reserve Bank brings it to<br>get us out of code what do you see as an<br>impact that that's going to have on<br>future generations of retirees maybe the<br>the age going up and National I think of<br>said that they would move retirement up<br>to 67. but will there be any sort of<br>means testing for people once you know<br>on their kiwisaver once they get to<br>retirement age<br>as a way of<br>well should I just leave yeah I was at a<br>tax conference last week and I got asked<br>all of these political questions<br>um<br>issues around superannuation yeah I mean<br>I advise the previous government around<br>increasing the the age of superannuation<br>um over a 20-year period Well after 20<br>years on a five-year period to 67 I<br>think<br>um there are good reasons to do it um<br>superannuation in its current form is<br>pretty unaffordable<br>um so I guess the there are some choices<br>for new zealanders to make around<br>whether or not or how do we afford<br>superannuation if we want to keep it at<br>that level or what are the other choices<br>um it's not as simple or you know there<br>are other options I guess<br>um than just raising the the age of<br>Eligibility and I guess that's something<br>that<br>hopefully new zealanders will get to<br>debate over some some period of time<br>before we so we make some changes<br>um the issues around intergenerational<br>wealth I think<br>um yeah Loom large with when you think<br>about<br>um some of the issues around climate<br>change<br>the cost of borrowing yes I think that<br>will impact on future Generations<br>um I guess though you know<br>at the time when we were advising<br>government on some of the the<br>consequences of covert there was this<br>sort of No Regrets sort of a approach to<br>both monetary policy and fiscal policy I<br>think one of the things that we as it<br>turns out got quite wrong but I mean for<br>good reason I think<br>um was what we thought might happen to<br>the labor market so when we were first<br>doing our forecasts we thought the<br>unemployment rate might Peak at around<br>you know close to 10 percent<br>um we were quite wrong because in part<br>those forecasts were conditional and<br>conditional on what we thought well no<br>government policy the government then<br>introduced 50 billion dollars worth of<br>support to the economy which then<br>supported labor market attachment so<br>part of the thinking there though was<br>that you get quite bad outcomes for if<br>youth in particular<br>um aren't in the labor market and you<br>can see these episodes and time when you<br>have had sharp declines in unemployment<br>it's youth in particular that get<br>um you know you know High youth<br>unemployment and that has in in some<br>cases generational impacts on on their<br>employment outcomes so that was part of<br>the thinking I think to support<br>um support labor market attachment in<br>particularly youth attachment at the<br>time so it's it's a it's a bit of a<br>delicate delicate one when you think<br>about some of the the policy intent and<br>yes<br>so we have all the economics graduates<br>recruiting for<br>15 years<br>um been various in various different<br>um graduate program recruitment and we<br>find it very hard to recruit good<br>quantitative economists<br>um<br>we know that there's strong demand for<br>high quality graduates and that's not<br>just and we're not talking we I'm also<br>talking The Reserve Bank here so the<br>treasury in The Reserve Bank uh probably<br>the the largest employers of Macarena<br>macro economists in New Zealand and we<br>find it very hard to get good quality<br>graduates with quantitative skills<br>I I did economics<br>um because it was more interesting an<br>um<br>but I mean we would we would like to you<br>know we would like to see good<br>quantitative<br>um business students come out of<br>universities and be interested in you<br>know whether it's working as an<br>economist at The Reserve Bank or the<br>treasury or an accountant or a finance<br>graduate or something like that but very<br>hard to find sorry you've got some<br>answers I'll answer part of that for you<br>um my top economic students many of them<br>are going down a joint eco-finance route<br>and many of them are going into the big<br>pwc's but in the finance Consulting<br>departments uh they're not going down<br>the accounting route<br>um that's where I think some of the loss<br>from economics is going but you know you<br>guys could be tapping those of us here<br>and saying to us who are your best<br>economic students macroeconomic students<br>and we could give you the names and I<br>guarantee you they'll be the same best<br>economic students or Finance students in<br>four years time when they come out but I<br>think that's where you're possibly<br>losing them<br>certainly strong competition amongst the<br>um the big four we've got two more and<br>then I'm going to get a break are you<br>asked are you joining us I'm happy to<br>hang around so you can then mob Peter<br>with all other ideas but like we've got<br>a couple we've got one at the back<br>um now what we do here sometimes from<br>students who go out to universities is<br>that the message is given to them you do<br>not need to study Commerce at school to<br>be able to study at a university<br>so they then come back to school with<br>their message choose alternative<br>subjects now while that's true often<br>ever student studies the economics<br>accounting business at school that's for<br>their passion is ignited for the subject<br>and then they go on to University so I<br>we as teachers I don't know if I talk<br>about it I would love to see a different<br>message coming out to students<br>to support Commerce subjects because we<br>do see a huge decline in our senior<br>students unfortunately these huge<br>numbers that Junior levels and then they<br>just filter a way to<br>um you know maths and science<br>often grabs them and we lose them I<br>don't know if we if you agree with that<br>but the question here then let's have<br>one more I think we had this question<br>okay<br>we're gonna need to break morning<br>what have I started line one because<br>they're not going to get the opportunity<br>to speak to Peter afterwards uh I say do<br>you want to ask on their behalf<br>oh they have the handle let's pop you uh<br>Cinema would you like to unmute yourself<br>and I should be able to hear you can you<br>hear me we can awesome<br>um my I'm reasonably young I feel like<br>that's um person and information to the<br>hiring aspect of economists but um both<br>advice I was given as a university<br>student and advice I know my students<br>get is that<br>um being a pure Economist grad doesn't<br>give you the range of potential<br>jobs and and that also the big four are<br>mainly looking at engineering and<br>science<br>um graduates and so many of my students<br>both do conjoints or they look at<br>overseas universities and so our top<br>economists are having those supporting<br>subjects which mean that um<br>there's more competition for them purely<br>as well as yeah<br>my dad worked for treasury when he was<br>an economist grad and then he went to<br>work for the University but his<br>opportunities now and Investment Banking<br>overseas means that the same students go<br>straight to working for and Goldman<br>Sachs or whoever<br>um or they go straight to working for<br>companies that had nothing to do with<br>um economics but they're seen as being<br>trainable skills<br>so I just think the competitive<br>environment for our macro grads is far<br>different to what it used to be<br>yeah and that's certainly something that<br>that we would also see as well<br>um just one final comment from me so if<br>there is interest in the room<br>um me or my colleagues or people from<br>The Reserve back would be more than<br>happy to come and try and excite people<br>about the prospect of working as a macro<br>Economist or just to continue on with<br>economics and that sort of thing and I<br>think the other question that you raise<br>is exactly the question that we're<br>asking more broadly not just about<br>economics but economics I know is one<br>that that we're discussing it as well<br>and and keep keep talking about all of<br>those things that's what today is about<br>is to really I think cement those<br>connections between uh secondary<br>education tertiary education and<br>employers that the wider sector and I<br>think that that's very much what we're<br>doing at the moment in our become<br>refresh is to to challenge these<br>questions that we're struggling with<br>that you're struggling with and that we<br>know employers are struggling with so<br>there'll be lots of opportunities during<br>the day including after lunch in our<br>Workshop activity we'll bring some more<br>in there Peter thank you so much<br>um we won an annual Minister of Finance<br>post budget briefing that many of you<br>bring your students to and the Minister<br>of Finance usually says that the<br>students ask the Choppers questions I<br>think he needed to come here because you<br>can see why they're asking 12 questions<br>it's good because they've been well<br>trained um so thank you for um prompting<br>some questions sometimes a little bit<br>political there and I think you walk<br>that delicate line that you need to do<br>around that uh Peter I think you have<br>said that we can show us these slides<br>we'll get these out to you<br>um afterwards those in on campus we're<br>going to be heading downstairs the<br>mezzanine floor uh for morning tea those<br>who are online I'll just move this<br>forward to say we'll be back at 11 but<br>back at 11 online and in the room for<br>our panel on entrepreneurship education<br>at University and how can we better<br>connect to the platform at second set at<br>second school it's the question that<br>you're asking Peter but let me say Peter<br>thank you so much for um taking on the<br>challenge to start the presentations<br>it's been really great little thank you<br>on our behalf for coming and let's give<br>that's great yeah I will be around but<br>hopefully that was a little bit<br>sure welcome back I realized I did a<br>huge faux pas and never mentioned where<br>the bathrooms are if you haven't found<br>them yet they're all around sort of the<br>lift area so both sides of the lift on<br>each of the floors so hopefully you<br>found those if you needed<br>um needed them<br>person Peter's session great<br>um we will share those slides there's a<br>lot of information on them and we'll get<br>those out to you<br>um and I thought the question he posed<br>this at the end so spoke to the kind of<br>conversations we're having and that<br>we're wanting to have with you as well<br>so had a couple of good conversations at<br>the break let's continue to have that<br>Coral as we go through the day<br>now when we put these<br>um programs together I talked before<br>about how we try and sort of Hit the<br>different aspects of the areas that you<br>teach in<br>um but often it ends up once we've kind<br>of got most of the speakers in place<br>that there seems to be a bit of a theme<br>across them even if we didn't<br>necessarily set out to plan it and today<br>it really is about that kind of role of<br>um that education Focus what it means to<br>teach different areas that we're engaged<br>in<br>it's my pleasure to um introduce our<br>next session which is a panel of<br>speakers which is something you've not<br>tried I think um before and um it's an<br>opportunity for us to again learn from<br>you as much as you as share ideas with<br>you because we know that there's some<br>great entrepreneurship activity at<br>secondary schools and we've been doing<br>some stuff here but we think there's a<br>lot that we can learn from you so that<br>we offer that transition for<br>entrepreneurs into at the University a<br>bit more wrap around I think that<br>so I'm going to introduce um Dr Jessica<br>Carini he is a senior lecturer in our<br>school of um management and he's also a<br>co-director of the atom and we talked<br>about that before that's you saw that as<br>you walked in the building<br>um this morning I'm going to pass over<br>to Jesse to do a little bit more of an<br>introduction to the rest of the panel<br>and he'll be kind of running this<br>session again those of you who are<br>online we will be monitoring the chat so<br>if you do have any questions or the<br>SlideShare drops off or anything like<br>that just pop it in the chat and we can<br>get that sorted and we'll also be using<br>again the microphone here at the front<br>so hopefully that'll come through and<br>when we get into discussions thank you<br>for um pressing the button and getting<br>those live as well so Jesse welcome and<br>I'll pass over thanks Karen<br>oh<br>uh<br>um thanks Karen for the introduction<br>um my name is Jesse Pitney so I'm a<br>senior lecturer in the School of<br>Management I went to Onslow college is<br>anyone from Onslow here uh<br>and<br>um yeah so I just want to give a brief<br>introduction to what we're going to<br>explore today uh we have Ava here who is<br>our<br>um our star entrepreneurship student and<br>she's going to talk a little bit about<br>her business her pathway from high<br>school into University and the kind of<br>um support that she's had here in order<br>to keep her business going and then we<br>also have Anita she's our<br>entrepreneurship Community manager and<br>he's just had a photo of two of her<br>previous teachers from Hunt Valley High<br>School<br>um and Anita's going to talk about I<br>guess what Karen was saying in terms of<br>the wrap around stuff so so the the<br>non-curriculum support for<br>entrepreneurship<br>and uh one of the questions that I'm<br>really interested in exploring as we go<br>through this hour that we have together<br>is<br>um the question of can you teach<br>entrepreneurship<br>and hopefully you can because we have a<br>um and also how do you do that uh and<br>it is a bit of a challenge for um for us<br>here at the University to teach<br>entrepreneurship a lot of the founder<br>stories that we hear about are start<br>with someone leaving University and then<br>founding a business and we have had<br>occasionally entrepreneurs come to visit<br>and talk to students and say you don't<br>need to be here get out of here<br>so that song is not very helpful<br>um but over the last 10 to 15 years<br>there have been really<br>um advances in how we teach<br>entrepreneurship the kinds of systems<br>that we use and the things that we teach<br>students<br>um alongside the wraparound stuff that<br>we do so uh interesting to try and<br>explore that question<br>and one other thing that we have noticed<br>is that a lot of students come through<br>from The Young Enterprise program or<br>they've run small businesses uh in high<br>school and they come to University and<br>they<br>somehow we we beat it out of them we<br>beat that sort of passion out of them<br>and they start to think they have to<br>learn all these protocols and ways of<br>doing things before they can understand<br>and start a business so also trying to<br>explore that idea of how do you do both<br>things how do you teach useful skills<br>that you can use<br>um to start a business and then how do<br>you keep the fire going so that people<br>don't lose that sense of I know what I'm<br>trying to do here I'm trying to start a<br>business I'm the one in control I'm<br>going to do that and I'm also going to<br>draw on these skills that people are<br>offering<br>um skills Frameworks protocols that<br>people are offering so<br>uh<br>uh we'll start off by hearing from Ava<br>then I'm going to talk a little bit<br>about our minor in Innovation and<br>Entrepreneurship so how we do the<br>education side of things and then we'll<br>hear from Anita about<br>um<br>her role as the entrepreneurship<br>Community manager and what now to our<br>Innovation space does and how that<br>operates and really happy to take any<br>questions and comments throughout in<br>terms of um<br>what people are thinking and what<br>they're saying in your space around<br>entrepreneurship<br>so uh over I'll pass over to you okay<br>I'm Ava and um I'm just finished my<br>first year at VEC during a bachelor of<br>biomedical science and last year um I<br>was a student of Mr Young's at<br>Wellington East girls college and under<br>the young Enterprise scheme um a group<br>of friends and I started a small startup<br>called tisley which was um researching<br>how to make something to detect date<br>rape drugs and drinks so we started with<br>an issue which obviously like you know<br>impacted us then went from there and<br>then obviously through High School<br>through that like you know our last year<br>of school we had the support and the<br>kind of structure of the young<br>Enterprise scheme to kind of you know<br>okay this is what you guys do next you<br>know we're Miss Leong telling us what to<br>do and that kind of thing but coming to<br>UNI were kind of a bit<br>there's only two of us left now it's the<br>last two standing in the business but it<br>was kind of a um<br>like what do you do next kind of thing<br>so that's kind of where the atom came in<br>and um which kind of was a young<br>Enterprise in a way but like holding you<br>through University and so they've kind<br>of um provided that like kind of<br>somewhat structure and guidance and<br>opportunities to go how this is what I<br>want to do<br>how do I do it so they set up a um<br>a meeting with<br>um<br>Louise Dixon and I who's she's the she's<br>amazing she's so lovely she's the dean<br>of science at Vic it's a top dog<br>um and then she kind of was like oh you<br>could do this and so that's I'm doing a<br>research paper next year which is direct<br>to individual study so I can research<br>the chemistry behind tisley and how to<br>get that product made but while still<br>working away chipping away at my degree<br>then I'm still at the same time can keep<br>the business going and you know keep on<br>can you tell us a bit more about tastly<br>um so it's<br>it's we I guess we started with an issue<br>which we cared about a lot and young<br>Enterprise kind of gives you the<br>structure on how to how to go there so<br>um<br>it's it's pretty much making<br>um a benzodiazepine<br>um detector stick so it's like a a test<br>which is<br>um will like provide a color change if<br>there's a benzodiazepine present in the<br>drink because<br>um<br>Rohypnol is the most common date rep<br>drug in New Zealand it's like the most<br>commonly used one I guess it's quite<br>awful to say but yeah<br>um and so the test would kind of you<br>could use it to presumptively identify<br>whether or not<br>um rehab null or another benzodiazepine<br>was present in the drink so that would<br>be your indication that okay whoever I'm<br>with not safe and this drink not safe<br>and I should probably<br>you know I've worn the bar stuff and<br>that kind of thing<br>um<br>so when you arrived at Vic did you you<br>know how did you see that business idea<br>continuing<br>um did you think you would continue with<br>it how was it looking for you I guess I<br>was lucky to already have uh somewhat<br>like a relationship or a connection with<br>Dr Joanne Harvey who's um<br>a professor associate professor at um<br>the school of chemical and physical<br>sciences so she kind of helped us it<br>means what else about last year so I<br>still had that relationship so I kind of<br>continued that on and she invited me to<br>her lab this year and so I've done a bit<br>of lab work with her like doing some<br>research and then um<br>yeah I guess um I got a call from<br>lambrini from Young Enterprise going hey<br>Ava like is this cool little place up<br>called the atom like you interested and<br>I was like oh yeah for sure and I guess<br>yeah I didn't really think I was kind of<br>I knew that at the end of last year that<br>I wanted to continue with this business<br>because I feel like we worked so hard to<br>be kind of such a shame we you know we<br>really it's an issue that we really care<br>about will be so shame to just kind of<br>throw it out because<br>no one was telling us what to do<br>um so yeah I was kind of I knew I wanted<br>to continue but I didn't really know how<br>I was going to do that because it's kind<br>of scary it's like I don't know how to<br>run a business I'm 19 like I don't know<br>all the ins and out how to get people to<br>listen to me and get people to take me<br>seriously so I guess the item kind of<br>provides that kind of support that kind<br>of you know connects you with the right<br>people get you on comms with the right<br>people<br>and yeah<br>yeah that's an interesting idea I think<br>that sense of legitimacy maybe that yeah<br>you know they're asking for you<br>um<br>and so so you have this kind of<br>entrepreneurial drive or entrepreneurial<br>mindset which we talk a little bit about<br>um<br>your you told me previously that your<br>mum runs at two businesses and so you've<br>got this background of business<br>um<br>you know coming back to that question of<br>entrepreneurial education and supporting<br>people into entrepreneurship<br>you know what have you found that has<br>um<br>have there being things in courses that<br>have helped you<br>um or is that something that you you<br>just had and would have done anyway<br>I think um because I'm just studying<br>like<br>straight up science at Uni there's no<br>kind of um<br>you know it's just kind of this is the<br>science this is how it works not really<br>going this is the science and this is<br>what you could do with that science so I<br>guess um<br>yeah I think it's hard for people to<br>kind of tap into their kind of<br>entrepreneurial start if they're taking<br>something that's not like business or<br>Commerce related because it's like<br>you know they kind of structure degrees<br>in a kind of like a bit of a cookie<br>cutter like you do this paper then you<br>do that paper then you do this paper and<br>then you go get a job and work for<br>someone instead of going you're going to<br>do this paper and on the side you can<br>chip away at something that you're<br>really passionate about you know I'm<br>getting to use my knowledge that I learn<br>in my chemistry classes and I learn in<br>my biology classes and you know and so<br>so either but and then I get to use that<br>knowledge on the side as kind of like I<br>guess the atom is kind of somewhat of<br>like an extracurricular<br>it's kind of like something that I do<br>with my studies but also like like kind<br>of intertwined with my studies it's not<br>kind of like a completely separate thing<br>it's something that I can<br>do kind of as one because I guess that's<br>kind of<br>there's so many like super creative<br>people out there that just have like all<br>these amazing ideas of how to you know<br>benefit the world but just kind of I<br>guess it's quite hard to know how to how<br>to get that into reality and get them<br>into something because it's kind of like<br>God I know I want to make this but like<br>how am I going to do it kind of thing<br>but um<br>so I wonder if that is there something<br>about the education that supports you to<br>get to the how<br>but you have to bring the<br>the drive to the drive yeah I want to do<br>this<br>um I wonder if we could maybe throw that<br>out to to the group here<br>um I know some some schools around young<br>Enterprise as an as an addition to<br>classes as far as I understand and some<br>run it in in class<br>um how have you found that<br>uh uh you know supporting students to to<br>take on a project where they need to<br>have that kind of why that Avis talked<br>about<br>okay<br>is uh is quite confining so people see<br>it as a as a limited you know limited<br>amount of time to do it and tend to kind<br>of switch off saying middle term three<br>one question I was going to ask though<br>given that uh Ava is that you're doing<br>bio biomedical science okay so is there<br>anything that the university can offer<br>you almost as an additional paper in<br>entrepreneurship or<br>that could maybe you know people in your<br>subject area with really good ideas<br>might be able to just kind of almost go<br>tangentially off to a different<br>academic area that might actually give<br>them some route to develop ideas from<br>think advisor<br>um who's Dr John Harvey and she kind of<br>you know guides me to the research I get<br>kind of one-on-one lab time I guess<br>um but with that you kind of already<br>need to have something that you want to<br>research you can't just go in and be<br>like I want to do something that I don't<br>know what because<br>yeah so that might give you expertise in<br>that product the development if you like<br>but about the the business or the<br>entrepreneurial application of that to<br>take it to Market or find an investor<br>have you got anything that can back you<br>up through the university so I could<br>speak yeah if you so we have we have a<br>minor in innovation in entrepreneurship<br>that we just launched maybe two years<br>ago so currently we have about 80<br>students doing it which is a relatively<br>good number so the miner is worth 60<br>points<br>um so the monitor is a 60 point minor uh<br>and we constructed it by selecting a<br>range of 12 papers that we currently run<br>in the business school already which all<br>relate in some way to entrepreneurship<br>and Innovation so there's an IP paper<br>there's an international marketing paper<br>there's a<br>financing paper in terms of how do you<br>find out your business<br>um and so anyone in the University can<br>add this Miner to their degree program<br>and uh you take once you've taken four<br>papers you receive the minus so for<br>example Ava could decide I'm going to do<br>a paper on IP I'm going to do one on<br>financing uh you might choose to do a<br>lot of The Bootcamp papers that we have<br>and then we have a um sort of standard<br>structured entrepreneurship program at<br>300 level<br>which I think might give you that kind<br>of thing that you're talking about that<br>additional like<br>um<br>what are the tools that entrepreneurs<br>typically are using because you know<br>you're saying that it's quite difficult<br>to teach entrepreneurship and Innovation<br>that's certainly what I find I mean they<br>might have a vague idea and then come up<br>with some processes take it somewhere<br>but the Innovation is coming from your<br>subject<br>as opposed to studying entrepreneurship<br>and that toolkit on top of<br>um what you've learned in your subject<br>area your science area that's what<br>you're kind of developing<br>that's totally that's exactly the<br>approach we're trying to take and but<br>it's not the approach everyone takes so<br>I've got this question down here<br>undergraduate or postgraduate major and<br>Entrepreneurship so down in otago they<br>teach an undergraduate major in<br>entrepreneurship they also have a<br>masters in entrepreneurship for a short<br>time we had a masters in<br>entrepreneurship sort of on the box here<br>but and it never really took off<br>um and I think the challenge there is<br>that<br>you need to entrepreneur about something<br>it's it's hard to just be<br>um<br>yeah yeah yeah<br>and and you yeah yeah<br>young Enterprise right yes I loved it<br>um but did the credits matter to you or<br>did you just want to do the young<br>Enterprise and enjoy it I guess at Ace<br>you kind of do it like all your<br>internals you're doing on young<br>Enterprise so it's kind of you're doing<br>one thing and you you do one one little<br>thing and that goes to both young<br>Enterprise and your internal but so<br>credits so I guess<br>hmm that's kind of a hard question so I<br>guess like your<br>like I liked how that was kind of you do<br>one thing and it could count towards<br>both instead of having to do everything<br>twice right so I feel like that made a<br>lot more sense in kind of having as part<br>of like that's what you're doing in<br>class instead of you do it on the side<br>outside of class because you know things<br>are busy like no one not many people are<br>gonna be like you know what I'm gonna<br>finish my my you know 8 45 till 3 20 day<br>at school and I'm gonna go hit the books<br>and make a business like I think that's<br>quite difficult for a lot of people<br>Ava would you have done young Enterprise<br>none of it's extracurricular<br>um<br>yeah<br>um<br>questions to be honest like probably<br>probably not because I wouldn't have I<br>wouldn't have thought oh I think I want<br>to start a business that's not really a<br>thing that I would have been like hey<br>this is a possibility for me but um<br>so I guess yeah I think it's really<br>helpful to have young Enterprise as part<br>of the the curriculum for like year 12<br>or year 13 because it means like<br>it kind of gives people the idea hey<br>like I could I could do something here I<br>could make a business and I can go<br>somewhere with it and young Enterprise<br>kind of is that kind of like provides<br>the structure of how to how to get to<br>the endpoint because like no one really<br>knows how to make a business like that's<br>quite a big question especially as like<br>you know when you're like 17 it's kind<br>of like oh God it's quite a big task<br>can I just<br>uh I'd just like sort of follow up<br>quickly on that question about School<br>teaching that how they're not<br>necessarily getting the why and the<br>drive there and<br>um I've said a really important co-pop<br>that you wanted to work for that was<br>driving you forward into it<br>um do you think that why would have been<br>there and as strong if you hadn't taken<br>Commerce at secondary school as well<br>because we are seeing often students<br>indicating that's an interest area<br>you're getting told not to study it at<br>school because you can just do it from<br>scratch at Uni and I'm wondering if<br>that's impacting on the why or the<br>passion there yeah I guess I'm I picked<br>up business in year 13. I like I didn't<br>take it all the way throughout I didn't<br>do it like you know 10 or anything I<br>just kind of was like actually like hmm<br>maybe that'll be interesting and then um<br>yeah I think the why was definitely<br>would still be there regardless of<br>whether I took business I would still be<br>like I want to do this but I guess it's<br>useful to kind of start out and that<br>like high school environment where<br>you've got this kind of structure you go<br>to school every day you've got to set<br>time to do your business things so I<br>guess that's what I struggle with at Uni<br>is that I want to you know I wanted to<br>do this research I wanted to you know<br>forward the business I wanted to get in<br>contact with people and go hey I want to<br>do this help me that kind of thing but<br>you know I was studying four papers like<br>a that was kind of like taking out the<br>majority of my time and you know the<br>business was something that could<br>you know I didn't no one was telling me<br>you had to do this by you know next<br>Wednesday over whereas with my papers<br>that I was doing at Uni it's like<br>there's deadlines and so I guess that's<br>where the paper that I'm doing next year<br>is coming in quite handy because it<br>means I get credits for doing the<br>research that I already wanted to do so<br>it's kind of like it makes me have time<br>but also like have deadlines and have<br>like expectations on what I need to do<br>and when I need to do it bye interesting<br>I wouldn't be fair to say that actually<br>a really convenient vehicle yeah that we<br>used to<br>um to make the learning authentic yeah I<br>reckon that's kind of bang on as like<br>young Enterprise as a vehicle and they<br>obviously like I don't think many<br>students<br>you know you'd have to be kind of a<br>special kind of person to be like I'm<br>gonna do all my paper like classes at<br>school and then on top of that I'm going<br>to sign up for this you know quite kind<br>of like heavy content heavy busy takes<br>up a lot of your time<br>thing which is Young Enterprise so yeah<br>I think the credits definitely mattered<br>because I don't think I would want to<br>take away from my Studies by doing young<br>Enterprise and wanting to focus on that<br>while also having to you know need a<br>university entrance I need to get my<br>thanks any other questions around us I'm<br>kind of seeing this idea of how do we<br>structure our learning so that we<br>support entrepreneurship and that drive<br>um but if the learning is important like<br>you're saying you know you you need a<br>young Enterprise to be a credit bearing<br>course<br>in order for you to be able to do it it<br>also speaks I think to this idea of<br>legitimacy<br>um I used to run a business where I<br>would train University students to tutor<br>high school students and<br>they<br>they could just go out by themselves and<br>shoot our high school students but they<br>there's something about being under the<br>umbrella of a business that meant they<br>felt comfortable charging a higher rate<br>they felt comfortable saying I'm a tutor<br>I work for this company and in some ways<br>maybe young Enterprise and also the FM<br>space here gives students us Faith to<br>say<br>I am doing something and I'm going to<br>pursue my why through there yeah because<br>I guess that's kind of something that I<br>think most high school students wanting<br>to do something like this would struggle<br>with it's like people kind of go you're<br>17 like what the hell are you gonna do<br>kind of thing but it's like these are<br>kind of fresh Minds that have all these<br>great ideas that have you know a whole<br>life ahead of them to do all these<br>things it's kind of like<br>I feel like there's a lot of kind of<br>like<br>I even think I found this in the young<br>Enterprise scheme it's like you know<br>we're doing it like it's like a<br>Kickstart day where you kind of plan out<br>your ideas and we were like oh we want<br>to do this we want to make something to<br>to cheat day rape drugs they were kind<br>of like oh that's so much science like<br>they kind of almost wanted to they were<br>like a fabulous idea but<br>fabulous idea but you know almost wanted<br>to crush it because<br>how are we going to do that and I mean<br>we we won Wellington regionals and<br>Internationals with having no product we<br>didn't know exactly how we were going to<br>make the product<br>we kind of a bit of a bit of a like you<br>know but I guess we would we were driven<br>and we knew we wanted to do it and you<br>know I guess that was proved by you know<br>our pitching uh like all our little<br>documents that you do in young<br>Enterprise but yeah I guess that's the<br>kind of one fault with young Enterprise<br>is that they kind of want you they kind<br>of almost encourage you to stick to<br>these kind of cookie cutter business<br>ideas which are great but like I know<br>everyone has<br>some side of some sort of great idea you<br>know that they want to do but it's just<br>kind of crushed it's like oh you're not<br>going to be able to do that it's like oh<br>stick to making soap like you know it's<br>like like it's something like that yeah<br>so yeah I guess<br>you know encouraging people to do<br>things that are kind of not out of the<br>box but do things that are gonna be<br>challenging you know because I feel like<br>everyone loves to be it loves a little<br>challenge a little kind of like you know<br>but um yeah I think that's a fault with<br>young Enterprise is that it kind of<br>almost encourages you to do something<br>because it's like easy to do kind of<br>it's a lot easier to make soap than to<br>make a date rape drug protect us<br>yeah<br>congratulations on putting some<br>intellectual property against yourself<br>thank you<br>um<br>one of the things I'm trying to do with<br>my boys you know I teach at St Patrick's<br>in kilbirnie is get them to the idea<br>that really a successful business has<br>some intellectual property<br>right awesome technology some technology<br>or some IP of some kind or otherwise<br>they're opening a lemonade store so<br>right and yeah we all need soap but uh<br>it's a really tough business if you<br>haven't got any underlying competitive<br>advantage and showcasing those<br>businesses to them and getting them to<br>see that real people in Wellington have<br>businesses like that<br>um it's one of the things I'm trying<br>really hard to do and if you as the<br>University have access and there's just<br>things like I can bring 25 boys into the<br>atom because you're going to have 100<br>kids in and somebody's going to do<br>here's three startups talking for 45<br>minutes each about what they've actually<br>done would be amazing yeah great you<br>know almost like an angel investment<br>showcase but they get to rehearse<br>instead of in front of kids yeah yeah<br>well so um<br>I guess with getting these like ideas<br>for businesses and getting kind of this<br>like you know businesses that have like<br>a real like on a different so like some<br>kind of intellectual property that's you<br>know quite unique they've made<br>themselves I guess that's really like<br>fostering that kind of like what do you<br>care about kind of idea not so much uh<br>you have to start a business that makes<br>money you've got to make a product in a<br>year so like you know go do that you've<br>got to kind of start with the kind of<br>like what do you care about you know<br>credits aside you know the fact that you<br>have to do this in a year aside<br>you know what do you care about and how<br>do you think you can solve that because<br>that's what we did we're a group of five<br>girls and we were like you know this is<br>something that we're seeing with you<br>know our friends you know our families<br>like you know cousins siblings it's kind<br>of like we're we're at the age where<br>everyone's everyone's going out to town<br>everyone's going to parties that's kind<br>of a big new thing and then you know<br>every every weekend there's another two<br>people that gets spiked and you know I<br>had friends that you know blanked out in<br>town woke up and they're in the<br>emergency room and it's kind of like<br>that was something that we<br>we cared about regardless of whether<br>we're going to get credits or not like<br>that's something that was very like<br>that's something that we care about a<br>lot and then so we were like okay this<br>is something we care about how we're<br>going to solve it and then going from<br>there instead of going you have to make<br>a business how are you going to make a<br>business<br>what are you how are you going to make<br>money that kind of thing so it's kind of<br>like like you said like authentic<br>kind of like<br>yeah and I guess that's when the kind of<br>credits come in because there's always<br>going to be people that just want to get<br>the credits so I guess yeah people that<br>just want to make so I think you're<br>right it's a balance right you you sort<br>of the credits help you do the thing<br>they give you legitimacy but then you<br>have you bring the why the the thing you<br>really care about and some I mean I know<br>that young Enterprise has ways of<br>helping you discover a why right<br>something important to you<br>um this race is really interesting you<br>know the reason I love being involved in<br>entrepreneurship education is because of<br>the people who are pursuing this why<br>right they're really excited about<br>something and you're like I see this is<br>a problem and I'm going to find a way to<br>overcome it and there are some tools<br>that can help you validate your idea<br>some kind of just make a um you know an<br>MVP and go out and try things<br>um and in the University sector we're<br>seeing a growth in entrepreneurship<br>education within the business school and<br>there's probably some instrumental<br>reasons for that in terms of how how do<br>we get more students involved in<br>Commerce given that accounting is you<br>know some of our kind of core subjects<br>that are being really popular are<br>becoming less popular<br>um and so where do we sit you know a lot<br>of students the push for stem is<br>becoming more successful and so we're<br>losing some Commerce students<br>um like you say maybe at school people<br>are saying well we we won't do Commerce<br>we could we could just pick that up at<br>University you don't have any<br>prerequisites to do that<br>um and so I think for the University<br>sector anyway what we're seeing is<br>entrepreneurship as a pathway to saying<br>how do we have impact how do we be<br>really meaningful<br>um how do we get our students<br>um something so that they can go out and<br>really have an impact on the world and<br>pursue what they're interested in so<br>it's really a growth area for us trying<br>to understand how to do that well<br>um but I'm interested in how what's that<br>is it for some schools a place of growth<br>we're trying to expand our<br>entrepreneurship stuff for some schools<br>is at a place of no we don't do that we<br>don't do young Enterprise we're not<br>interested in that the summer in the<br>middle you know where is it at for<br>people<br>um it was quite good they they saw the<br>value of that it could happen too sorry<br>um other subject areas that we're doing<br>so for example we had students and<br>business studies that ended up making<br>methane detectors to put in compost<br>because they were doing sustainability<br>issues and they didn't know if it was<br>going to be market for it was pretty<br>Niche not many students that were going<br>to be able to sell it to but I think<br>that's the point that you're raising<br>that doesn't necessarily the motivation<br>wasn't oh we're going to make lots of<br>money out of this it was like what do we<br>need to do and oh well I'm doing<br>electronics and that was the whole idea<br>I said we'll do it for an Electronics<br>standard but we'll use that as a product<br>development market research<br>so I guess if you're asking how it may<br>look sometimes that's quite a good<br>Avenue to see what they're doing in<br>other subject areas and then bring that<br>in to depends how good that<br>communication is within a school I guess<br>and you're relying on factors outside of<br>your department but um I think that<br>maybe an Avenue<br>correct you've got to kind of keep that<br>door open as teachers like that you can<br>kind of you know double dip you know I<br>did a something for business that I got<br>credits for on chemistry yes like you<br>know Everyone likes to you know two<br>credits for one like oh yeah yeah but um<br>yeah I guess you've got to kind of<br>encourage that kind of you know you you<br>don't have to sit yourself to one<br>One path and you follow that one the<br>step and the step in the step you can<br>kind of go I don't know again yeah<br>you've got to get all over the place but<br>yeah you've got to kind of I guess<br>provide the environment for students to<br>be creative and to be Innovative and<br>kind of you know you know we're going to<br>do this you have to do your internal<br>your your business whatever whatever's<br>going on but like<br>and that you can kind of you don't have<br>to do something that you don't really<br>care about just because you know it's<br>for credits you can have something that<br>you<br>you know you've got to kind of got to<br>start from the what do you want to do<br>not the what do you want to do for<br>business studies kind of thing and I<br>think the interesting thing on the case<br>that I was explaining was a lot of<br>students started asking about business<br>studies through that from the<br>electronics class and you know they<br>suddenly saw there was an Avenue of<br>communicating with their community<br>community and maybe that is the strength<br>of the Commerce subjects uh that it can<br>bring in students that might have<br>thought on uh I'm going to do some of<br>the stem subjects or whatever to go oh<br>actually there's a really good pathway<br>for someone like me you might do<br>comments actually I've seen that now<br>visible in the school<br>yeah absolutely yeah we've got an online<br>uh comment as well uh Marla I don't know<br>if you'd like to to switch on and did<br>you see introduce it otherwise I can<br>read out mothers joining us from<br>Hamilton boys high school<br>um Allah says for us an area of growth<br>and many students bring in what they're<br>doing in other subjects outside of<br>school but at other subjects and outside<br>of school but again we're dealing with<br>the same issues that students feeling<br>they don't need to do Commerce at school<br>and we'll pick it up later and when<br>Jesse to give a bit of context we were<br>talking about that in terms of we're<br>challenged by a previous speaker to<br>think about kind of where were the<br>economics graduates going and and we<br>were talking about that challenge that<br>you know are we sending messages you<br>don't need to do comma promise at school<br>you can pick it up at Uni and actually<br>we need to have a much stronger uh voice<br>that actually talks about the value of<br>Commerce education across secondary and<br>tertiary thanks for your question Marla<br>or comment<br>right we have another um yeah<br>um what<br>with you<br>it what could have we done as teachers<br>to enable you to expand your idea<br>that you are actually getting at<br>University<br>I guess and how can we tap into what<br>you're doing at a university to bring<br>that knowledge back into the school so<br>just getting that knowledge earlier yeah<br>I guess I was quite lucky that<br>you know my business teacher wanted to<br>support what we wanted to do you know<br>she believed in us and believed that we<br>could we wanted to do something we would<br>do it but um<br>I guess it's kind of pushing that you<br>know if you really care about this why<br>would you wait for it for uni to do it<br>you know why would you put it off you<br>know if I really care about you know<br>preventing people preventing drug drug<br>disability sexual assault why would I<br>wait three years to start trying to<br>prevent that why would I just start it<br>now so I guess that kind of like<br>you know these these issues like if you<br>care about them now like start now don't<br>put it up for three years until uni but<br>yeah I guess having the kind of<br>believing believing in your students I<br>guess you know having trust that you<br>know<br>we are capable even though we're 17 18<br>whatever you know people are capable of<br>doing big things and also like<br>I was really surprised at how many<br>people were super willing to help us you<br>know would be like hi I'm Ava I'm a<br>student at Williams East and then you<br>know we worked with Callahan innovate<br>Innovations we went to their um<br>their big place in gracefield and you<br>know they turned us around and they were<br>really really interested in what we're<br>up to and I feel like<br>yeah they were super like I was<br>surprised how many people were willing<br>to you know back us and you know we're<br>the we've got the idea and they've got<br>the the big brains you know kind of got<br>a<br>we've got a link up and they're gonna<br>hang out is there anything over that you<br>are experiencing at University that<br>would have that you think your school<br>could have done<br>um I guess pushing students a bit more<br>kind of encouraging people to do<br>the most that they can do because I feel<br>like there's a lot of kind of ins in<br>school that's kind of like you don't<br>have to do that you can get an e without<br>doing this it's kind of like you've<br>really got to push students to do the<br>most that they can do because even if<br>they're doing it and they're not going<br>to get extra brownie points at school<br>you can still kind of like Foster that<br>kind of like you know I feel like<br>everyone wants to do well everyone wants<br>to do the most that they can do it's<br>kind of like you've got to support<br>students to to I guess reach their full<br>potential like you've gotta yeah<br>so have people pushed you here in ways<br>that you weren't pushed at school is<br>that what yes I guess yeah there's a lot<br>more kind of encouragement to kind of<br>do more<br>kind of like a<br>I guess you're kind of at school you're<br>getting that academic validation all the<br>time from teachers you know teachers go<br>oh well done either okay but then like<br>in uni No One's Gonna tell you oh well<br>done Ava you've just got to do it and so<br>I guess<br>there it's kind of like if you you kind<br>of gotta you've got to push yourself and<br>I guess finding that kind of Drive in<br>yourself it's like I want to do well<br>because I don't I want to do well I want<br>to get this business out there I want to<br>help people it's kind of you've got to<br>start that instead of kind of going you<br>know telling people well done for doing<br>little things it's kind of you've got<br>really got to push people to do more<br>than obviously you can get an excellence<br>in your in your internal just by doing<br>this much but like you know what's after<br>that what else can you be doing<br>kind of<br>do better you know you don't have to<br>stop at an excellence and call it a day<br>you can keep on doing more and keep on<br>doing<br>you know better things big things<br>yeah<br>um<br>love hearing your story I just I guess<br>what I'm hearing from you here I feel<br>like a lot of us a lot of us over the<br>last couple years we've been encouraged<br>to support students by making it easier<br>for them by not expecting too much of<br>them because it's very stressful at the<br>moment it has been horrific for everyone<br>with covert in there and so it's about<br>like adapting their program to lighten<br>the load and I think that's being at the<br>cost of Extinction activities like<br>scholarship for example kids aren't<br>choosing this because you don't get<br>credit so why would you do it and I<br>really appreciate from you because it<br>kind of sounds like you're saying no<br>actually do continue to push kids to<br>take on these extra things they don't<br>need to do it yes it's not necessarily<br>going to get credits or you know yes<br>you've got next one already but this is<br>something you might be really interested<br>to learn it might personally develop you<br>as a person it might you know like kind<br>of like these these things that are<br>gonna like you're saying question in<br>because they don't test to do it but<br>it's something that might actually help<br>you in the long term it might be<br>something that extends you personally<br>grows you as a person like makes you<br>reach your potential that isn't<br>necessarily measured and are you really<br>got your NCAA level three<br>kind of thing it's kind of like no don't<br>just keep it don't just like expect like<br>a oh you just want to pass like yeah is<br>that kind of like what you're saying<br>like do do this because yeah because I<br>guess there's a lot of kind of like<br>there's a lot of kind of in in high<br>school there's a lot of kind of<br>endpoints it's like oh you've you've got<br>on your 50e credits you're good for the<br>year kind of thing but I guess kind of<br>giving giving students the space to to<br>be creative and to push themselves and<br>to do things that they actually care<br>about because I feel like all through I<br>guess in chemistry last year we were<br>doing like a internal on like ocean<br>acidification like cool but like I want<br>to do this and I guess giving students<br>the opportunity to kind of<br>you know obviously it's a bit harder to<br>mark for teachers having you know they<br>had 30 different ideas being talked<br>about in a report but I guess giving<br>students the space to if they want to do<br>something a bit out of the box a bit<br>different thing like okay yep go for it<br>you know I feel like<br>giving giving students a bit more kind<br>of<br>what's the word like kind of giving<br>students the reins on what they're doing<br>so obviously you have to you have to do<br>the<br>you know you had to do your this and all<br>that but kind of you don't have to do it<br>in one specific way<br>you can do it kind of in your on your on<br>your own terms kind of thing and what<br>you're and like obviously you you do a<br>lot better when you're doing something<br>that you are actually interested in you<br>know<br>yeah<br>avocado just ask you something on on<br>that point something to press over here<br>something um I try to do a lot and we<br>try to do a lot like our programs it's<br>giving that agency that's an agency in<br>Choice um so let me make a comments<br>project I do for example pick any issue<br>in the world you're passionate about<br>what's the causes impacts common<br>policies to address it rather than it<br>used to be explained the income get<br>Australia which is top of my most<br>extreme Alternatives yeah<br>um a lot of students are hesitant they<br>often ask me what's going to be the<br>easiest choice to do is this going to<br>work for the internal to get my credits<br>easy as opposed to can I take that risk<br>of that creativity I spend about the<br>whole first four weeks just saying<br>things something you're passionate about<br>and you'll want to keep work on it and<br>I'll help you with the economics but<br>they are quite hesitant is there<br>anything<br>from your point of view that we could be<br>doing to help students trust us to take<br>I guess like again providing the space<br>to kind of be creative in the first<br>place kind of going you know what do you<br>guys care about because you know there's<br>probably 30 different things that people<br>care about in a class of 30 and kind of<br>getting people to kind of collaborate in<br>that way you know if you've got a little<br>team or doing the same thing then you<br>kind of can chip away at it but I guess<br>um<br>I guess<br>kind of almost reminding people that you<br>know there's a lot of people out there<br>that are very smart that are very like<br>Keen to help you and get involved with<br>young people like<br>and I don't know we were 17 when we went<br>to Callahan would probably be the<br>youngest people in the building for like<br>the past 10 years like they'll be like<br>um so we've got kind of 15 minutes or so<br>left I think would be quite I'd really<br>like to um take a look at some of the<br>kind of wraparound stuff that we provide<br>to so we talked about the education<br>Pathways<br>um so Anita is our community manager for<br>entrepreneurship and<br>I'll let you talk about your role but<br>it's really about connecting into the<br>community around us<br>um so like you were saying Ivan about<br>um you know showing students hey here's<br>what's happening and there's a great<br>Community around Wellington in<br>particular<br>um so so a lot of our workers to connect<br>into that so Anita I'll let you talk a<br>bit about what you're sure your role<br>involves children<br>apprenticeship Community manager alumni<br>Alum art early high school shout out to<br>miss Shea and Mr B Y who taught me<br>economics and business studies so thank<br>you guys uh I see a few familiar faces<br>to jaish and some<br>um great to have you here as well<br>um<br>so I want to take a little macro leans<br>and it might help to answer some<br>previous questions you've had today<br>um if you look into your own City or<br>just your own Community you will find<br>that there are so many great features<br>that have gone really big and they're<br>just I've taken Wellington as an example<br>but they are born out of Wellington in<br>CBD right in our neighborhood and a lot<br>of your alums and our alums have ended<br>up starting their business or working<br>for them and this is where I feel that<br>there could be a cross-colination of<br>um the subject that they choose to study<br>when they're in high school and need the<br>degree that they choose in uni and when<br>they um go out into the real world so<br>that's the support that we want to bring<br>to our students so from the outside<br>um that's a little image of the atom if<br>you haven't seen it already I can make<br>it available during lunch time so that<br>you can come down to have a visit and I<br>can have a personal chat with you as<br>well<br>so the biggest way that we help any<br>student entrepreneurs or perspectives<br>student entrepreneurs is through the<br>atom Innovation space and the way we do<br>this and not only is it space but where<br>the entrepreneurial hub for the business<br>school and for the University we provide<br>that<br>listening yeah like we want to listen to<br>our students the idea how they want to<br>get started and we provide them with a<br>safe space with free Wi-Fi Corp next<br>door right in the building where they're<br>studying as well so that ease of access<br>is really helpful for them<br>we provide event space as well so if you<br>want to run a workshop we can do that we<br>provide we connect our students with<br>mentors and also some of our graduates<br>who have gone on to start their Ventures<br>come back as mentors as well so death we<br>provide that ripperary service<br>we profile our students not only on our<br>website but in events like this so<br>you'll see Ava who's come here to have a<br>chat with you we'd like to profile them<br>in the community as well and<br>opportunities to participate in<br>community events so we are connected<br>with those who support entrepreneurs so<br>you might have heard of creative HQ or<br>you've heard about young Enterprise<br>quite a bit today and uh Callahan<br>Innovation unibiches we want to be able<br>to work with them to<br>continue our students pathway when they<br>finish uni and go out into the real<br>world<br>we they also hold events so<br>for instance there has been like careers<br>of the future for instance and that's<br>one held by Icehouse beaches there are<br>VC agency and they talk to students and<br>other community people about what<br>alternative careers people can have so<br>that's a good plug for our students who<br>are studying the accounting or economics<br>to be able to think outside the box<br>about what they really want to do once<br>they finish these studies<br>these are our current entrepreneurs so<br>um a lot of them<br>they are based in different locations<br>either around Wellington or around the<br>world so we have uh Daniella she's doing<br>marketing and management and she started<br>remote high school was two of her<br>friends so anyone here from Tower<br>College<br>no okay so that she was from um she<br>started in 2020 and it was at the time<br>when we're about to go on to lockdown<br>and they had this idea where they wanted<br>a repurpose laptops and um give it back<br>to their school and at the time it was<br>like just the timing of it with lockdown<br>that people needed a laptop to work from<br>home or study from home so it they<br>really went well with it and it's still<br>going strong they run workshops around<br>New Zealand to um with high school<br>students<br>um and then we have schwari who's from<br>Morocco menstrual cup she started her<br>Adventure at the um near age of 16. she<br>um<br>she was looking to develop a product<br>which was sustainable which would end<br>period poverty and also just promote<br>women's health and safety and she's been<br>going for a good four years now<br>and she's still like she's looking for<br>her second idea and what she is doing at<br>the moment is she's participating in<br>competitions that are unibun or some<br>agencies that we're connected with Japan<br>so an example of that is a 15-a-thon<br>where the student or a team of students<br>can work with a company like Fletcher<br>Golding<br>um and to try and solve one of these<br>sustainability issues so she's I mean I<br>could say it now she's won that<br>challenge and she's going to be going to<br>pitch to<br>everyone in Sydney over there so that's<br>a really good news story but it's just<br>that it's an example of how the<br>entrepreneurial mindset just keeps<br>growing and going growing so Ava that<br>you've got this idea now but in a couple<br>of years you might have another idea<br>that you want to test out and you might<br>want to bring others on board as well<br>but it's just promoting that and just<br>igniting the idea with students when<br>they're in high school and still are<br>quite you know they've got the energy<br>for it<br>um<br>and then we've talked about young and<br>deployed this program for prospective<br>students the students we also do high<br>school experience days<br>um I'm not sure if Jose is going to talk<br>about this in the next segment but I'll<br>just briefly explain that students from<br>other high school or from your high<br>schools maybe and they come in for a day<br>and they have a communist indoor day<br>where they go and have a tour they do<br>some workshops here so we have run a<br>small mini entrepreneurship Workshop<br>called them just to see if they can come<br>up with an idea<br>um so we'll be lucky to do that next<br>year as well if you're interested so<br>that's a quick brief about how we're<br>helping our students and how we what to<br>promote those opportunities to high<br>school students<br>and thank you<br>oh does anyone have any questions for<br>thank you that was really cool and it<br>just made me think of something while I<br>was watching it and I guess also just<br>hearing the other called it all<br>happening there about um is definitely<br>attention between a compliance model or<br>like what I need to do to get excellence<br>and stuff like that and how do you have<br>the entrepreneurial mindset um which<br>we're trying to also encourage<br>um and there's like almost a cognitive<br>dissonance and the word that I would say<br>that when I've seen it succeed is that<br>word trust<br>and what I like um about what you're<br>pitching that we've actually got a<br>community of really cool entrepreneurs<br>or agency with you know organizations or<br>through you folk as well is that I think<br>that that builds trust with students<br>they go oh it's not just that this old<br>guy at the front is saying come on you<br>should be entrepreneurial<br>believe me does that have agency don't<br>worry you know<br>they kind of hear that was like oh<br>really you know maybe this is just a bit<br>of a journey for this guy or whatever<br>but I think when you connect with the<br>community they start saying oh yeah<br>actually this is a world mindset for<br>entrepreneurs they do see things outside<br>the box and I I just thought as I'm<br>listening to you that maybe that's a way<br>we can build trust to say actually you<br>can have agency and still get those<br>other<br>not pushing the students out of the box<br>like not having the box in the first<br>place kind of thing yeah not kind of<br>ahead oh here's here's what you meant to<br>do but if you want to do something else<br>you can it's kind of letting students<br>decide on the first but they have to<br>trust you before they will take that<br>Journey they won't I've seen them not<br>take it if they don't believe it's a<br>model they can trust but I guess it has<br>to kind of go both ways that teaches<br>students as well absolutely yeah we um<br>we ran an alumni event<br>um the kind of breakfast of him maybe a<br>week or so ago and someone in the<br>audience said how do I how do I get<br>started I've got this idea what what<br>next and<br>um the the panel and actually someone in<br>the audience who is an experienced<br>failed entrepreneur he spent three years<br>starting a project to streamline Council<br>consents which if you've ever had to do<br>any consents you'll know is like a<br>nightmare and he said look I just we<br>just couldn't get it across the line we<br>had everything we needed we just<br>couldn't do it but he said<br>um actually this came from lingy one of<br>the one of the panel members he said oh<br>you want to get involved you've got an<br>idea what should you do he said build<br>your networks so attend events like this<br>participate in the ecosystem become<br>member of the entrepreneurship ecosystem<br>by going to the breakfast events there's<br>all sorts of things happening around the<br>city and and I think it speaks to your<br>point you know you see people doing the<br>things you you start to have the<br>conversations eventually you know you<br>become that kind of person and you start<br>to see what's possible and to then you<br>can trust you know the person at the<br>front of the class is like no honestly<br>um so<br>we've got about four minutes left if<br>anyone has any questions or anything<br>um otherwise we might wrap up and then<br>we'll um pass you over to Jose uh uh<br>we're gonna stick around for lunch for a<br>little bit anyway<br>um so as Anita said you're really<br>welcome to visit the atom which just as<br>you come in<br>um<br>it's it's our entrepreneurship space so<br>we have whiteboards and Post-it notes<br>and all those kinds of things<br>um that you need an entrepreneurship<br>space but you're really happy to talk<br>about other ways that we can connect<br>with your students so I love this idea<br>of<br>um having some businesses that can share<br>their you know what is their competitive<br>Advantage what's the thing that takes<br>you from lemonade stand and soap to<br>something else whether it's like the<br>ethic soap which is just soap but it<br>doesn't have a plastic package you know<br>it doesn't have to be a huge thing yeah<br>uh so I I've attended the festival for<br>the future I don't know<br>um how many people have attended that<br>from your schools it happens<br>um every year in Wellington and when I<br>attended it was 1800<br>and that's a great way that yes can<br>actually uh or young Enterprises can<br>actually promote<br>um their<br>um<br>activity or like um we had a few of like<br>we had shared these we had the CEO we<br>had a zero CEO<br>um have a panel there so it was a great<br>way to get views into it if schools can<br>actually<br>participate in that that would be that<br>would be really great like the app there<br>was not many of Commerce teachers but<br>they were ugly agriculture teachers that<br>were there and taking advantage of that<br>space so it would be really cool to<br>attend that<br>um festival for the future next year if<br>any of you guys interested<br>and so that's a great idea I had the<br>opportunity to attend festivals for the<br>future uh this year and first of all it<br>made me feel very old but secondly it<br>was awe-inspiring and we were lucky<br>enough to get some uh tickets from one<br>of the sponsors that we shared out with<br>some of our staff but also uh students<br>as well and I know they got a huge<br>amount of that being exposed to some of<br>the real sort of Business Leaders and<br>other and Community leaders and we all<br>came back challenge that's another great<br>example of where we could do some Focus<br>work with perhaps atom students if we<br>get that opportunity again in the past<br>um also just on that note I'd like to<br>promote two events which have had very<br>popular feedback from our students and<br>they've been called girl boss<br>yeah<br>um our students came back with rave<br>reviews it's in their own time October<br>school holidays great experience they<br>told me it was all on Zoom<br>um and business week<br>um which happens at<br>um it's north boys high<br>come on that is run I am not sure who<br>organizes it but it is a national event<br>and students come together for a week in<br>the July school holidays<br>April yeah and they always come back<br>buzzing from that event so just another<br>two ideas<br>great for sharing those I think this is<br>a really good opportunity and obviously<br>the work that's C to do as well to to<br>promote some of those things<br>um it's great that you can stay for<br>lunch I really feel that we need kind of<br>a photo over lunch of each of you or all<br>of you with your teachers who come<br>behind you I already saw I need to get<br>in a couple<br>um earlier and things but a really great<br>story of I'm really pleased that we've<br>been able to put a panel of uh local<br>school graduates who can talk about<br>their experiences<br>um Ava I'd like to particularly thank<br>you for being willing to be grilled by<br>both teachers and your lecturers thank<br>you so much and welcome<br>you know<br>my name is Jose as Karen said I am from<br>the future students team here at<br>Victoria University of Wellington<br>um so you would probably have seen some<br>of our colleagues they do a lot of Penn<br>University events as well as actually<br>reaching out to the various schools<br>talking about pretty much first round<br>visits scholarships accommodations<br>anything that will prepare them for when<br>they have to enroll for any degree that<br>they want to do at Victoria University<br>of Wellington myself in my role I've<br>only just started about seven months ago<br>and it's the first time that they've had<br>a specific recruitment person who looks<br>after just the faculty of Commerce and<br>the faculty of law so if you have any<br>questions about those in terms of the<br>degree structure as well as how to get<br>connected<br>I'll talk about a little a little bit<br>about<br>um how to get connected later on as well<br>but do feel free to reach out to me<br>um so The Bachelor of Commerce<br>um it's changed quite a bit since I was<br>a student here at the Victoria<br>University of Wellington and that was<br>probably in the last seven to eight<br>years<br>um so this is really just a quick little<br>spiel about how it is to be a bachelor<br>of Commerce student at the moment<br>um specifically for next year so this<br>could also change later on<br>now the three main things that I tell my<br>students and this is just for you to<br>pass it on maybe to your students next<br>year if they have any questions there<br>are many things that I want our students<br>to take away from our sessions is that a<br>bachelor of Commerce will usually take<br>around three years now that is not the<br>end or be all we are not very strict on<br>that three years myself included I<br>actually<br>um my degree my whole university life<br>took about six years and that could be<br>from various reasons to from changing a<br>lot of the times or maybe you're you're<br>a parent you're doing you're doing<br>University part-time and also there are<br>students who would also be working<br>full-time as they study so three years<br>is not the um not the deadline that we<br>give students however if students do ask<br>how long it takes we roughly say around<br>three years the second point is that no<br>matter what<br>um what you study if you are a bachelor<br>of Commerce student you have to take at<br>least one major and I'll go through the<br>different Majors that we offer so no<br>Bachelor of Commerce student can finish<br>the degree without selecting one major<br>from the Commerce subject areas<br>and the last thing is we have something<br>called the 7B com core and I'll talk to<br>you about that later on but the 7B<br>concour is pretty much the foundational<br>courses that we have<br>um at The Bachelor of Commerce and it<br>just helps set some students those<br>coming from different subject areas and<br>I'll also talk about that because it is<br>a personal experience for me as well<br>um and that kind of Fades into what<br>we've been hearing about is Should<br>students are students I'm supposed to<br>have that background knowledge from high<br>school and what what benefits it has<br>because certainly it would have would<br>have benefited me<br>um so the vehicle core they span out<br>from accounting economics fcom which is<br>fcom is pretty much um sort of a wrap<br>around Commerce government and law that<br>most of our students will take in their<br>first year we have information systems<br>so it looks at the business analyst side<br>as well as very low level coding<br>marketing management and Quan which is<br>the statistics for business so these are<br>courses that we tell students to take in<br>their first year specifically if they<br>don't know what they want to take so<br>myself I used to be a student advisor<br>and I used to guide students throughout<br>their degree my favorite question or<br>dilemma for a student coming in is if I<br>get a student who doesn't know what they<br>want to do but they want to do a<br>bachelor of Commerce these seven bcom<br>core courses allow them to kind of<br>sample the areas of studies that we have<br>to offer so they don't feel like they<br>have to make that specific Choice<br>straight away and they get to kind of<br>look into or peek into the subject areas<br>before committing later on however we do<br>have lots of students sort of chopping<br>and changing as their degree goes<br>because they get exposed to different<br>subject areas as well<br>um so that's a 7v compore like I said a<br>lot of our students will take them in<br>their first year however<br>um myself I kind of deviated from that<br>path I wish I did the 7B Chrome core I<br>focused on my accounting degree<br>um so I haven't properly explained my my<br>degree<br>um my degree to you I'm I did Bachelor<br>of Commerce major in accounting and a<br>minor in commercial law and I came from<br>paraparaumu college<br>um about 10 years ago anyway going going<br>forward so um I did mainly just<br>accounting I had a lot of different<br>electives thrown in there and I left<br>things like marketing and management to<br>my last year because you can do that<br>good thing is I could focus on<br>accounting the bad thing is I actually<br>really enjoyed marketing and management<br>and it was too late to actually add that<br>as a major or a minor at that point so<br>just a little tip for our students when<br>we do do those course advice for them<br>um so the bcom degree uh the best way<br>that I explain it to our students and<br>it's just to kind of demystify this for<br>you if you do have any questions in your<br>classrooms is that if you think of your<br>degree as a cup the first um third of<br>that cup is the 7B calm core<br>um usually in your first year<br>the second third would be that one major<br>that I mentioned about so every Bachelor<br>of Commerce students will need to take<br>that one major<br>um it can change throughout the whole<br>year as well in their first year now the<br>third is where things get a bit more<br>confusing for students so you can either<br>fill that third up with a second major<br>so you can do double major I just didn't<br>do that because I didn't want to over<br>commit<br>um but that was just a personal thing<br>you can do a few minors and that's a<br>good way for students who want to maybe<br>do different specialization but not<br>actually do all the seven or eight<br>courses in that second major they can do<br>a few minors instead to sort of put<br>multiple eggs in in their basket that<br>third basket<br>or some of our students will also choose<br>to just do electives and that's just to<br>fill in the cap with as much points that<br>you need so some of our students don't<br>actually want to specialize in a second<br>major we do encourage them to specialize<br>because might as well get something out<br>of it rather than just choosing random<br>courses here and there just for the<br>points but we are not very strict on<br>that because you know we understand that<br>some of our students do have varying<br>interests and we'd like them to put that<br>into the degree rather than outside of<br>the whole degree requirements so that's<br>how we structure a degree<br>um a bachelor of Commerce however don't<br>if a student asks us how do I how am I<br>supposed to remember all of this and all<br>the qualifications that I need we do<br>have the Student Success team<br>um so this is a group of of<br>professionals here based in the campus<br>and they are the ones that would look<br>through a student's degree hold their<br>hands throughout the degree and make<br>sure that they are always on track you<br>can see that I'm actually on there<br>that's actually not supposed to be me<br>it's my brother however I couldn't find<br>a photo because he's fighting you and I<br>thought we both have the same name might<br>as well just Chuck myself in there<br>um so that is not me there is another<br>Jose bucoy in this in this building<br>um annoyingly enough<br>I keep saying um our parents couldn't<br>afford another name so we just kept<br>makes it easier for writing your your um<br>names on things so the majors that we<br>offer how I simplify it for our students<br>um is that because the number one<br>question I get when I reach out to<br>students or see them at at course<br>planning is that is the course math<br>heavy and I tell them there are some<br>courses that are math heavy so these are<br>accounting Actuarial science data<br>science economics finance and Taxation I<br>don't tell them that it's exclusively<br>math because there is a bit of um of<br>theory in there as well intertwined<br>um Actuarial science we're the only<br>University in New Zealand that actually<br>offers Actuarial science as a bachelor's<br>major as well sorry an undergrad major<br>so if it is the route that people are<br>wanting to go so that is your your<br>finance and economic students combined<br>that they want to do Actuarial science<br>would be a good option for them and we<br>do reach out to them when they come over<br>for open day or various pan University<br>recruitment events<br>um and then the non-math heavy one are<br>commercial law Human Resources<br>Information Systems international<br>business management marketing public<br>policy and our favorite tourism<br>management shout out to Karen who is who<br>is still a lecturer currently a lecturer<br>sorry about that that was my bad<br>um but yeah so these are our 14<br>different Majors you can see that the 7B<br>com core that I mentioned earlier do<br>help them sort of reach into the other<br>14 because it is hard to make a decision<br>um at the young age that they're leaving<br>school so for them to be able to<br>actually witness the different areas of<br>Commerce would be quite important myself<br>when I was a student advisor usually in<br>the end of the first trimester or the<br>end of the second or the of the first<br>year in total I will get students who<br>have done the 7B com core chopping and<br>changing and switching to information<br>systems or marketing as a major because<br>they're able to actually explore that<br>and that is when those student advisors<br>myself included will be beneficial to<br>planning that change in their degree<br>now all of this major can also be<br>offered as a minor so if you didn't if<br>you wanted to do a major in accounting<br>but you didn't want to commit to a<br>double major in accounting and<br>commercial law and you want to expand a<br>bit you can do a major in accounting or<br>a minor in marketing and management if<br>you wanted to so all the 14 are made are<br>offered as minors and we also have these<br>four new miners that we offer<br>specifically the banking minor that is<br>quite new to next year so we'll have our<br>first cohort of students starting the<br>banking minor next year we have<br>Innovation and Entrepreneurship which<br>just definitely has mentioned about Dr<br>Josephine as well as business ethics and<br>sustainability management for those who<br>are lovely sorry loving maths and into<br>that they can do it one step further and<br>maybe do a double major in economics and<br>finance and then econometrics as well<br>that would definitely kill me by the end<br>of my degree but yes we do offer these<br>minor only subjects they're not taught<br>as Majors but they're there to<br>supplement any sort of degree and<br>they're also offered Outside The<br>Bachelor of Commerce as well so it just<br>allows them to kind of have that so to<br>answer some I think someone had a<br>question about how do we um how do we<br>introduce the practices of<br>Entrepreneurship and and all that to<br>people who have not studied The Bachelor<br>of Commerce this is a good way for our<br>miners to feed into that so we have<br>students from The Bachelor of design or<br>science or Arts adding in a minor in in<br>or or sorry Innovation and<br>Entrepreneurship or even minors in<br>marketing that does happen and we<br>support them the same way as well<br>moving on so<br>um I'm assuming most of you know about<br>the kelburn campus so that is where most<br>of our students will start out<br>um that is where our Bachelor of<br>Commerce Bachelor of laws in their first<br>year they'll be there with all the other<br>subject area students it allows there's<br>a few reasons why we do that so the<br>first reason is that it allows them to<br>sort of come to University this big new<br>environment such a big step for them<br>with the high school students that they<br>came with their high school friends it<br>allows them to build a connection before<br>they even have to venture out makes it a<br>bit more comfortable and the second<br>reason is actually something personal to<br>me is that it allows you to actually do<br>different things without having to go<br>from one campus to the other so for<br>example myself I did mainly science<br>courses my parents really wanted me to<br>be in forensic science or somewhere in<br>medical I have quite a quite a harsh<br>tiger mom if I if I have to repeat that<br>she was very much either you be a doctor<br>a lawyer or something in um something in<br>in forensics because they were really<br>into CSI somehow<br>so they were projecting their dreams<br>onto me<br>um after my first year of science here I<br>did biomedical science newly fainted<br>when I had to dissect a rat<br>um so clearly that had to that had to<br>change for me now in my second year<br>because I didn't reach out to Student<br>Success team or anyone<br>um I was supposed to go to a specific<br>pathogens course<br>I actually accidentally went into<br>accounting 130 because I didn't read my<br>timetable right and I was too awkward to<br>tell people to move because it was a big<br>lecture theater of 300 so no way was I<br>going to tell people to move when I'm in<br>the middle of the of the aisle so I sat<br>through an hour of accounting<br>um and then actually ended up really<br>enjoying it so in that that first two<br>weeks I was able to change<br>so that is um<br>it was it's good in a way where we're<br>able to chop and change that um and the<br>good thing is a lot of our courses are<br>taught in entry level the bad thing is<br>it did take me about a year to actually<br>get comfortable with the Bachelor of<br>Commerce I knew I wanted to do it but<br>because I didn't have that background<br>um in high school I didn't learn from<br>learn from our accounting economics and<br>business studies courses sorry subjects<br>in high school it took a while for me to<br>learn the lingo and to actually learn<br>the idea ideologies in The Bachelor of<br>Commerce and I had a lot of preconceived<br>ideas of what a bachelor of Commerce is<br>so it took a while I was actually doing<br>conjoint for that whole year before I<br>realized actually it's getting a bit<br>easier now but it did I did struggle<br>without having done any of my Commerce<br>courses in high school so just a big<br>plug and that is something that we're<br>thinking of doing for next year<br>providing more more Commerce based um<br>activities so we have school holiday<br>periods where we'll actually get<br>internal and external speakers we did<br>something similar for the best Bachelor<br>of laws however that did tie in quite<br>well with with government pretty much<br>being here in The Bachelor of Commerce<br>especially at Victoria University we<br>have the access to be able to actually<br>bring in the people that need to enlight<br>the students from high school so we try<br>to make that platform quite quite<br>apparent during high school but more on<br>that later on<br>um in your second year at capita I<br>already mentioned it before having it<br>great here in this specific campus means<br>that you have the<br>um the access it's easy for us to<br>actually get guest lectures come speak<br>in<br>um in an economics course or even a<br>finance course and it's just quite good<br>for being topical when people get to<br>network quite well as well so this year<br>alone we had the Ministry of Finance<br>speak to quite a lot of our our call I'm<br>sorry quite a lot of the high schools we<br>did we held it in the parliament because<br>again we just have that access that that<br>relationship with the courts and<br>Parliament it is quite easy for us to<br>get um well connected so in your second<br>year if you're doing a bachelor of<br>Commerce you'll be based here it does<br>share with we do share facilities with<br>the faculty of law as well so some of my<br>accounting lectures when I was in<br>accounting were held in the Old<br>Government building as well so um yeah<br>again we do run these School holiday<br>periods for them for our teachers to<br>kind of well not for our teachers for<br>our students to look at the different<br>options that we have and to also hear<br>from not just lecturers but also<br>students that have just recently gone<br>through that pathway<br>um<br>and I guess the last thing that I wanted<br>to mention really I'm studying here at<br>Victoria University of Wellington is we<br>do value<br>um the grades obviously we want you to<br>have we want our students to have the<br>A's and B's or C's like me in my first<br>year but we also do want to emphasize<br>the the importance of getting connected<br>with a student body so we have four or<br>five different sorry six different clubs<br>clearly didn't do accounting that well<br>six different clubs here at The Bachelor<br>of Commerce we have Victoria Commerce<br>students Society or VidCon as we call it<br>they are the main group here at the in<br>The Faculty we also have not Tara umanga<br>which is our Maori Commerce Student<br>Association we also have pixa which is<br>our Pacific island Commerce Student<br>Association we also have two other ones<br>business and Innovation Club Victoria<br>business Consulting Club but the last<br>one beta Alpha Psi it's mainly for<br>accounting students however it doesn't<br>you're not restricted to that this is<br>more an international<br>recognized Club so we before covid we<br>had some students who actually<br>represented Victoria University<br>um internationally we sent them over to<br>Europe so a really good way for our<br>students to network yes it is important<br>to go through University as um go<br>through your studies and and make sure<br>that you get the good grades but also we<br>emphasize sort of those interpersonal<br>connections that you make while you're<br>at Victoria University<br>um and again I do want to plug in I know<br>I just kind of skimmed over it but since<br>we have the time we haven't we don't<br>have the time never mind what I was<br>going to say is that the Student Success<br>team are there to help so a lot of the<br>times our our issues with students who<br>may have fallen off the track is that<br>they just don't reach out to us but we<br>are there to help the last thing we want<br>our students to worry about is how to<br>plan their degree when they're already<br>worrying about lectures tutorials and<br>homework yeah that's all for me<br>I'll be at lunch so if you want to get<br>connected we do offer those um in-person<br>School visits as well that Anita was<br>mentioning and we get in the teachers<br>and the external speakers for you and<br>it's all free as well<br>okay I can't believe we're about to<br>introduce our last speaker of the day I<br>will say a few people have mentioned to<br>me that they will need to leave early<br>feel free this is not a room you can<br>leave early like income without anyone<br>noticing because like an airlock but<br>just go with it you need to leave leave<br>when when you can but I'm sure you won't<br>want to once you've heard from Fong<br>talking to us about accounting and<br>finance education in a digital age<br>um is one of our associate professors in<br>accounting and she teaches Financial<br>Accounting financial statement analysis<br>finance and research methodologies on<br>our undergraduate and postgraduate<br>programs<br>um she is a member of both Kant and CPE<br>CPA office radius know that one by now<br>and um does research in a range of<br>different areas particularly in<br>financial regulation corporate<br>governments as well we were talking<br>actually also and also has just joined<br>the qmc uh board as well so um talking<br>it was nice to make the connection up<br>there um earlier as well so you've got a<br>your child daughter is very very young<br>so um a little bit before she might be<br>hits the the Commerce curriculum fully<br>but um but certainly but certainly some<br>ideas around particularly financial<br>literacy into the curriculum so<br>hopefully this last session will cover<br>but they also run their own business<br>especially my mom runs like an education<br>business as well so I came to I could<br>finish High School in Vietnam I came to<br>Australia I was unsw actually um the<br>same school with Weyland like um for my<br>um accounting I guess in finance and<br>economics degree and then I moved here<br>yeah and then um and now we already have<br>our call little family here because my<br>husband also afraid from high school<br>that he moved here in 2011 and we now<br>have a little girl who's now six year<br>one is when I go to college okay so a<br>little bit of background about like when<br>Karen um asked me about getting some<br>presentation for the Commerce teaches<br>them believe and I'm very excited<br>because I'm saying okay he's actually<br>didn't aligned with my own interest as<br>well because um I will go like it was<br>six but she's it's quite interesting<br>that the home we talk a lot about you<br>know what she want to do in the future<br>and she's very clear she was four years<br>old I want to be a fashion designer and<br>a musician however I'm very keen on when<br>I see I'm gonna go to see mummy's school<br>with a law school or a business school<br>I'm actually walking on visitors but I<br>would you know but she's a lawyers like<br>being a lawyer is quite attractive as<br>well and she's very clear I want to do<br>the thing I want to do I don't want to<br>work for anyone she's pretty clear that<br>I want to run my own thing you know I<br>want to have my own business so I think<br>you know Ming and I told her that okay<br>you can keep your interest about you<br>know color like um painting you know<br>fashion designing and all that kind of<br>thing and your music however if you want<br>to run a business what you're doing<br>Laura and it doesn't it's very important<br>and I try and convince that it's good<br>the counting is not boring finding is<br>not boring it's good to have the<br>knowledge in that area<br>okay sorry yeah yeah so sorry Karen<br>thanks so<br>so for today that I um just want to<br>um just I'm trying to be brief but I'm<br>trying to give an overview about the<br>ideas that how we can actually tackle<br>the issues of the education about<br>accounting and Finance in a digital age<br>so okay<br>so you can see that over the last I have<br>to say that back in two 2001 when I<br>started my undergrad study pretty much<br>all we learned about accounting and<br>finance is pretty from the book like you<br>know we don't have that much I think<br>it's the first time I was in Sydney that<br>we<br>you know I've learned to doing all the<br>Google search about I'm feeling lucky if<br>you're on a search for something but you<br>can see that over the last more than 20<br>years now things have changed a lot you<br>can see that you know the driving of all<br>the technology confirm and the full you<br>know the types of some of those firm and<br>now the rising of you know other new<br>technology like you know the they call<br>the the fan group like for example like<br>Facebook Facebook<br>um you know alphabet Google you know<br>Netflix you know you can see that all<br>that kind of so you can see that the how<br>digital Technologies has transformed or<br>impact on accounting and Finance in fact<br>you can see that you know the value<br>delivery and operational performance of<br>accounting and finance function has been<br>significantly transformed by the<br>advancement of digital Technologies and<br>now you can see that there's a lot of<br>emerging Technologies they're talking<br>about especially within the profession<br>like you know the charter accountant<br>like um CPA<br>um and also that you know if you talk<br>about Charter Financial analysts and the<br>ca might also Charter management<br>accountant in the program they're always<br>talking about how to actually educated<br>you know the the people making the works<br>for us about all the analytical Big Data<br>artificial intelligence like Ai and<br>robotic process automation like rfpo<br>okay now I'm just trying because I know<br>that your interest is more in educating<br>like school<br>students but I'm just trying to share<br>some ideas you know in a way that you<br>know why we're doing universe and<br>something that you can incorporate at<br>school at the same time so you can see<br>that you know how these are the<br>Technologies and have impact on<br>accounting and finding education and<br>education in particular because you can<br>see that the expectation from the<br>industry now regarding for accounting<br>and finance graded has become higher and<br>higher they expect them not only<br>understanding the knowledge but also<br>under node you know programming and also<br>the Technologies in order to to fit into<br>the workforce nicely or I can say<br>smoothly with the transition so you can<br>see that the accounting and finance<br>curricula has to be modernized to<br>prepare the student in response to the<br>demand from the industry is very clear<br>because otherwise you know if your<br>students only want to know to do the<br>bookkeeping the you know the the things<br>on the papers they won't be able to fit<br>with the new environment so the focus is<br>more on data analytics you know decision<br>making Strategic Management so<br>I'm just putting like um I'm just<br>wondering whether we can actually put<br>them the slide on also on that screen<br>also over here okay that's fine yeah<br>so um<br>so in the Technologies there's a lot of<br>Technologies like talking about software<br>you know they're one of the particular<br>popular one in Excel only people are now<br>talking about Tablo like using data<br>assess R now we're talking about the<br>python not talking about other<br>programming language like C plus or<br>xavar or machine learning for example<br>but you can see that you know we don't<br>want to scare a student away from that<br>kind of thing so say for example like<br>sometimes you can simply keep it Excel<br>and Tableau and maybe like a little bit<br>of python it might be good and you've<br>got the financial modeling process<br>automation data analytics data<br>visualization so however the basic is<br>still very important it's quite<br>interesting to see that you know how you<br>know we can't actually demonstrate a way<br>into using software and you know<br>technological tool without teaching or<br>helping the student to understanding the<br>bailing knowledge because in fact at the<br>end of the day it doesn't matter how<br>technology change it's more about human<br>brain like if you don't really get the<br>basic and we don't really know what we<br>want the machine learning or the<br>Technologies to help us we can't<br>actually do that<br>so like so weak the basically still<br>important like journal entries about the<br>bookkeeping about the nature of the<br>financial reports uh preparation<br>consolidation accounting issues like<br>Corporate Finance financial management I<br>just I'm not trying to pull out all the<br>topics that is for example but the main<br>questions here is actually how do we<br>have the good plan of the basic<br>knowledge and together with Technologies<br>so we don't drive student away because<br>sometimes if we actually overuse a<br>technology students might scare away<br>because not all of them actually fit to<br>do a silent degree engineering degree<br>you know like because some of them might<br>come with the you know they're more tend<br>to be more like um sociologies or didn't<br>know how we can actually keep a good<br>balance and they appreciate like the<br>balance between the basic knowledge and<br>also the Technologies and how we<br>actually can balance I'm trying to you<br>know I talk to Karen today she's trying<br>to use a wood boring but I put a bracket<br>like how we can balance between the<br>boring with the interesting ingredients<br>in the way that how we're doing the<br>teaching I have to admit that you know<br>over the years my teaching has changed a<br>lot I remember back that when I finished<br>my PhD I'm learning my way to doing the<br>teaching and also it's not until about<br>2007 16 2017 when I'm actually getting<br>myself into the mood that where I can<br>control about like have more control<br>about how I'm actually controlling the<br>materials and how I teach so I feel a<br>bit more about how I can incorporate the<br>material into the um you know into the<br>curriculum to how I teach and also how<br>to fit and to meet the requirement for<br>the professional program because you<br>know when we teach in accounting we have<br>to figure the requirement from the<br>application body like for example like<br>hands or CPA or a double acsb for<br>example I think they've got a specific<br>accreditation for our accounting degree<br>okay so just a little bit of information<br>about how to understand the business in<br>the digital age it's quite interesting<br>that if you look back many many years<br>ago like if you're talking about company<br>I'm just picking up a company like<br>let's say um in the US let's say General<br>Motors or you pick up um a company like<br>um<br>um let me warm up or Costco like you<br>know some of you have been in the state<br>like looking at the traditional company<br>like in the retail Industries or um you<br>know Supermarket chains so you can see<br>that it's very clear that how you can<br>see their assets liability I'm not<br>actually putting photos in like a<br>snapshot in there but you can see that<br>it's pretty much like if you look at<br>business like Walmart Costco or you can<br>look at a small scale in New Zealand<br>like um you know the footstaff New<br>Zealand or a new world countdown a<br>modelson for example you can see that<br>pretty much the assets at Brick and<br>Mortar they have you know their store<br>they actually have their inventories<br>there so it's pretty good monthly assets<br>but now if you're looking going to more<br>onto the digital age you can see there's<br>a lot of company that you don't see the<br>value in the assets as a record as an<br>asset so it's quite interesting that for<br>me normally when I design always a way<br>that I'm trying to help my student I<br>don't actually start with accounting<br>standard or the topics for the beginning<br>that I'm trying just to pick up and meet<br>our platform with one of them my<br>favorite company Facebook you know<br>because pretty much all my students got<br>a Facebook accounts and we have a<br>Facebook group for our class so people<br>are interested in the Facebook account<br>okay now when we look at the company<br>like Facebook for example you might be<br>able to see that okay so even in a<br>million so in about 165 billion well you<br>know it will be you know<br>the assets but you can see that based on<br>there they got cash account about 16<br>billion like 31 about marketable<br>security that was actually invest in the<br>market they got to count receiver only<br>14 million but you can see that their<br>property and Equipment you can see is 57<br>million and they got you know good<br>intangible assets you know they got<br>intangible assets here very small very<br>surprisingly that you know you know I'm<br>not sure you know we're about to tell<br>you what I said but to be honest my<br>question that I asked my student is what<br>is actually Facebook assets<br>how come the intangible asset is<br>actually so slow so small and now you<br>actually look at the bed they actually<br>have a great asset but they can't<br>capitalize it they can't actually record<br>in their<br>reports because actually we are the<br>assets we are the users right but how<br>they actually find the assets based on<br>the accounting standard they apply us<br>Gap so I'm just trying to explain to the<br>student that normally the company can<br>put recording assets on their balance<br>sheet if they can control they can show<br>that they can control and have the right<br>to obtain the return from those assets<br>but you can see that for Facebook users<br>and now you can see their problem right<br>now they can't control like you know<br>because if they want move on new<br>technologies and thing now people are<br>like depending on how they feel but<br>people might you know the users might<br>decide that okay they don't like<br>Facebook anymore they're leaving the<br>platform that is where they can see that<br>you know they can't report the asset but<br>they can see that in the new technology<br>firm like Facebook it's very important<br>that how you maintain that kind of like<br>a soft skill that how you actually<br>maintain the user then in the way that<br>they can maintain and get their return<br>and it's quite interesting that you know<br>I know that when you teach business<br>people talking about return on Equity<br>return on assets for example let's say<br>return equity like it will be you know<br>the net profit divided by the equity but<br>some you can break it down like you know<br>the most pocket divided by<br>um revenue and you've got revenue<br>divided by total assets and total assets<br>divided by Equity it's called the Dupo<br>analysis very traditional one back to<br>many many years ago but if you look back<br>at the Facebook model that particular<br>ratio analysis might not work might not<br>actually work because if you see that<br>net profit over revenues okay you can<br>see it but Revenue over the total assets<br>but with the total assets and Equity<br>there if you can't actually measure you<br>are set in a way that properly in here<br>is a lot of hidden assets that you can't<br>actually record it it's not going to<br>tell you about how they generate their<br>revenue it's very important to see the<br>business model<br>so I always start with some company like<br>this so students will see you know is<br>how why is important to understand their<br>business model and understand the<br>numbers now the next questions the next<br>example will be Netflix I'm away because<br>pretty much of every pretty much every<br>family got sign up for Netflix I'm also<br>using Disney as also as one of the<br>example as well but you can see for<br>Netflix the validatory assets here<br>44 billion but you can see that their um<br>okay and I've gone down to the um<br>content assets is actually 30 billion<br>it's actually the content assets online<br>like they actually rank like if you<br>divide it's pretty much about<br>70 of their assets or content I said<br>they're soft like it's not like it on<br>the platform but you can see that now<br>the company the same have the problem<br>like in Facebook like they compete with<br>the other platform you can see like<br>Amazon also have their own channel like<br>the other like Disney plus also have<br>their channel so we can see the<br>competing for the users then so it's<br>very important to actually in order to<br>understand and how to run business<br>properly they might want to understand<br>how the firm generate revenue and what<br>other factors they have an impact on to<br>their model now the next thing is quite<br>interesting that you know with people<br>always talk when they talk about<br>accounting and finding they're talking<br>about the bottom line numbers I'm more<br>interested into the top line numbers I'm<br>always thinking about you know the main<br>thing is more about Revenue you can't<br>earn Revenue doesn't matter how you<br>actually break down you can't even you<br>know dealing with you know net profit<br>would be the way how you manage or<br>expand and other like you know related<br>costs raise on Revenue but you see the<br>case for meta platform for example meta<br>Q2 sales decline one percent<br>but EPS actually dropped by 32 so they<br>actually moved the CFO to the new Chief<br>strategies officer role straight away<br>but you can see that you know the market<br>we actually will be talking about you<br>know accounting and finance so you can<br>see that they actually care about both<br>bottom line and and<br>pipeline bottom line numbers also but<br>also there's one thing that I didn't<br>include the um the slide in here but for<br>example if you look at the retail<br>industry let's say company like Walmart<br>they can have a like every one dollars<br>of Revenue they end up all we hear about<br>I think the year before is about 4.1<br>percent it's only about<br>of every one dollars they only have<br>about four cents for their net profit<br>but I think the year before was only<br>about 2.5 cents so you can see that<br>pretty much 75 going to the cost of sale<br>so it's quite interesting like if you it<br>is publicly available information you<br>can actually download the 10K report<br>equivalent to annual reports yeah to<br>show the student okay here's how they<br>actually work out for big firm but um<br>you know as it might keep student also<br>interest<br>you know in the media and the other<br>thing that I want to share that you know<br>case study approach it's quite<br>interesting that you know as a student<br>when I was in Sydney I had to admit that<br>even I did lore and a little bit of<br>Laura and accounting we have to read<br>accounting standard as a student I found<br>reading account incentives super boring<br>to be honest it's just my person of you<br>like when I was a student and even now<br>I'm still struggling through Reading<br>Accounting Standards let's say that fair<br>value accounting you know there's a<br>whole lot of fair value accounting and<br>also<br>um the accounting for financial<br>instrument like especially after the<br>global financial crisis people talking<br>about you know like you know how to<br>actually measure especially Financial<br>firm in the industry right for the banks<br>or all the financial industry like in<br>the financial industry like how you<br>actually understanding the nature of<br>financial instrument it's in for me I<br>found it's challenging because a hundred<br>of pages of standards and also would a<br>thousand pages of interpretations<br>so to see that how you actually<br>understand it and there's one of the<br>little example about accounting for<br>leases I remember back too many many<br>years ago<br>you know company is trying to avoid<br>putting their Assets in library on the<br>balance sheet especially company with<br>the within the airline industry for<br>example so I think the chairman of the<br>International Financial Accounting<br>standard always say I want to make sure<br>that when I'm still alive I want to make<br>sure that I can see the value or the<br>airline of the airplane the value will<br>put on the balance sheet<br>now I'm not actually using an airline<br>cases but I'm using Brita Briscoe<br>because most of my student actually has<br>been shopping at that particular either<br>Briscoe or Rebel Sport for example or<br>living and giving so I pick up the case<br>so before I'm actually talk to me<br>accounting policies I actually show them<br>the annual reports so you can see in<br>2018 before they apply the accounting<br>for research<br>the asset in 2019 for the lead one is<br>zero but when they move on to here it's<br>actually 266 million and you can see<br>that the um<br>they call the rise of use of the um of<br>the assets<br>and in the liability the same thing like<br>you can see that they have zero<br>liability in 2019 but they jump up<br>straight away to 278 million but you can<br>see it basically more on this store like<br>they actually leave their store in the<br>thing but now you can actually your<br>assets actually boost up by how much and<br>also the liabilities actually change the<br>whole model about how the company can<br>meet the requirement for you know assets<br>and liability ratio like we've actually<br>explain to the student about how they<br>manage their let's say about their<br>leverage and all kind of thing so as a<br>small change in the accounting standards<br>and also the application will get the<br>whole 10 and how you can view the<br>business by itself so once you actually<br>I show my student that they will be<br>interested in accounting for this<br>and it's quite interesting that the<br>accounting standard they only let the<br>company to choose whether they can show<br>a comparable<br>that like information for 2019 because<br>2020 the first year that they apply that<br>accounting standard is interesting most<br>of New Zealand firm are applying their<br>they don't actually show the 2019<br>numbers because they don't want to<br>create you know some kind of comparison<br>so it's quite interesting to see that<br>because I'm working on one of the<br>projects releases with xrv as well so we<br>are looking to receive how company<br>actually comply with the lead standards<br>so<br>and now another example how I'm going<br>for time because otherwise I don't want<br>it's okay yeah okay yeah yeah so for<br>example now people are talking about you<br>know Corporate social responsibility the<br>one a big deal like it's how it impact<br>and now you can see that you know over<br>the world people are talking about you<br>know how to make sure that you know<br>because the investor you know<br>stakeholders value about how firms um<br>you know like you know respond you know<br>now or address their social<br>responsibility<br>um issues for example so I actually pick<br>up a case it's quite important that you<br>know to show them the actual case study<br>so there's a case study that you know<br>I've actually found from the general<br>accounting educations is about social<br>responsibility and tax avoidance because<br>pretty much all my students know the<br>company and here's a case about you know<br>the in the UK that where you can see<br>that the Starbucks global company<br>they're doing quite well but the one in<br>the UK pretty much over the years they<br>hardly pay any UK test for the whole 15<br>year they only pay maybe one year they<br>pay the tax but other than that all the<br>time is losses okay and now they're<br>trying to challenge the K but this one<br>is a very nice K that I can introduce my<br>student to consolidation accounting so<br>I'm not sure about whether you're<br>familiar with the but it's quite<br>interesting that when you show that you<br>know in the past that if you work only<br>for small business you only have one<br>company but you can see that now<br>business the nature is different like<br>you can see that they have a lot of NDC<br>like business under the control of the<br>business and you can see that when you<br>read the account it's actually the<br>Consolidated account it's very hard to<br>see how the account is made up and it's<br>quite interesting that you can see that<br>there's a lot of intra group<br>transactions happening so that this<br>particular case very important there<br>because they talk about profit like<br>transfer like you know chance for<br>pricing also about how the Starbucks<br>using their intra company loan across<br>the border in order to avoid to minimize<br>it because they're trying to minimize<br>the profit in the jurisdictions where<br>the tax is high and they maximize The<br>Profit introducing whether tax is low<br>so that's the way they you know it's but<br>it's a very nice way to show the student<br>how to link this one to learn the basic<br>about consolidation accounting but also<br>link back to the software about social<br>corporate social responsibility at the<br>same time<br>okay in another example people are<br>always talking about especially in New<br>Zealand how you balance teaching<br>students in the for accounting and<br>Finance in public and private sectors<br>this looked like in over the years we<br>tend to just educate or train the<br>student toward the private sectors but<br>we seem to be ignoring a little bit<br>about the big part of the public sectors<br>for example that you can see in<br>Wellington it's very important that you<br>know pretty much that for graduates they<br>actually pretty much maybe have 50 of<br>them actually working for the public<br>sector<br>so there's one thing that I always want<br>to show them about the financial<br>statement of government New Zealand okay<br>can I actually ask a quick question how<br>many of you in the room here actually<br>try to read the reports of the our<br>oh now it's all coming out yeah so I<br>also asked my student that question they<br>don't actually have no ideas they say<br>don't do actually what do we actually<br>have an annual check for the government<br>and I say yes they do have like the and<br>they also have monthly Financial reports<br>as well and you can have and see you can<br>see that New Zealand is the only country<br>now we are leading the world in the way<br>that we got all the way from the<br>budgeting process<br>to the financial statement on the poor<br>accounting and also with the um with the<br>um the the evaluation process also based<br>on accrual accounting so what I'm<br>actually to show them is actually okay<br>I'm going to show them this one is next<br>shot for 2022. okay they just released<br>in October so you can see okay how's the<br>government have been doing the total<br>revenue 1641 billion explain 151 billion<br>and now you've got another gain on<br>losses based on their financial<br>instrument<br>the bed negative 16.9 billion okay and<br>now you see the all bigger is operating<br>balance people are gaining losses but<br>you can see that over the years we are<br>doing pretty well like in a way that<br>just ignore the fact that how we measure<br>assets reliability but you can see that<br>how we perform how much in the year<br>before covert is pretty good but 2020<br>you can see that there's a lot because<br>we spend a lot on the covet respond<br>program whatever you know you pay you<br>know all the wages and all that kind of<br>thing that's the thing if you need one<br>not too bad but for 2022 we feel better<br>than the forecast they still got the<br>forecast is actually higher like the<br>loss is higher but it is around here and<br>you've got a core Crown Capital cash<br>flow and you can see that you know I<br>show my students because they actually<br>see okay here you can see the the total<br>asset is 18.9 but you can see before the<br>core Crown Capital cash flow but you can<br>see physical assets only 3.5 something<br>you've got investment 3.8 cons you know<br>contribution to the New Zealand<br>superannuation fund 2.4 in advancement<br>nine point two six for example and then<br>you can see that here's the one you see<br>the non-financial asset physical asset<br>and you can see Financial assets drank<br>even more than 50 so you can see that we<br>are more driving by more you know<br>Financial Assets Now rather than the<br>physical asset so<br>and I always ask my student a question<br>what is a good example of the physical<br>asset from New Zealand government<br>if to anyone who actually look at the<br>like State highways and actually what<br>you can see that all New Zealand School<br>it's Consolidated in a financial account<br>so all the school buildings and all that<br>you know it will be under under the<br>assets except for University though<br>because University and um polytechnics<br>is under they trust that they put them<br>because for academic freedom they put<br>them through the Tec as the equity<br>investment they don't you know so<br>University and is not part of the<br>consolidation so they're not so the the<br>information you see from here is not<br>included University but but University<br>also appear as an investment in their<br>career account in the you know you can<br>see that you know because we still<br>receive Government funding so the<br>government still show the asset but<br>they're not Consolidated in the in the<br>in the whole you know financial<br>statement okay and now I move on to the<br>next about online resources there's<br>plenty of free online resources this day<br>and for my student I always tell them<br>just to go to Yahoo finance and Google<br>Finance<br>if you want to know about companies know<br>about something just go in there you can<br>see that in the tech they can show you<br>all the free the stock price they got<br>you don't need the results from you know<br>you have to pay for anything so if you<br>want to create a student projects about<br>understanding the business about a<br>certain firm or a certain firm in the<br>industries for example they can do it<br>themselves with all the publicly<br>and for just a little bit of from my<br>channel because that we are lucky that<br>because we are at University and the<br>university resource we actually pay a<br>lot of money to work for for example the<br>Bloomberg terminal for the Thomson<br>Reuters icon and so so we actually when<br>we do the teaching we're using the<br>Bloomberg market concept Bloomberg for<br>education and also we're using the<br>Thompson Reuters<br>um you know Analytics tool as well so<br>when we can actually teach our students<br>but this would be a great opportunities<br>in the long run that University can work<br>with school in order for us to create<br>material and then support school with<br>more updated information that can help<br>when in the teaching and learning of<br>accounting and Finance in the in the<br>current world<br>so I think it pretty much that is my and<br>my presentation so thank you very much<br>so it's time for a q a<br>happy is your answer and if I can't<br>Karen might be able to help<br>not if it's on economics I should just<br>say that or accounting or yes I can do<br>my bit of Commerce<br>um we have got some uh participants<br>online as well and so if you'd like to<br>put anything in the chat um please uh<br>please do and we can either pop your<br>microphone on or if you pop them on the<br>chat we're happy to uh read those out on<br>your behalf as well but um yeah just in<br>opening up the questions if you can use<br>the microphone on your table just so<br>that our online colleagues can hear your<br>questions as well but uh yeah any<br>questions or thoughts<br>stun them sorry just don't come into<br>silence<br>how did you clarify that one yeah so the<br>main asset for the government<br>in building<br>um we can just go back to um<br>we could either save everybody here but<br>I can if you're interested just go to<br>the treasury website download the annual<br>report and but this one is only a quick<br>summary but this one is only core Crown<br>Capital cash flow they're talking about<br>the core Crown one but if you go to the<br>annual report you might be able to see<br>the whole thing because you can see that<br>under the government they've got all the<br>because they Consolidated all the<br>government Crown entities all the<br>Departments and also there's a lot of<br>state-owned Enterprise like you can see<br>they'll be in New Zealand or Romanian or<br>Genesis energy also part of the also<br>there's Courier limited you know there's<br>you know it's within the Garment report<br>you know the you know Garmin report as<br>well so this one is already the core<br>crowns one yeah but this one because I<br>have a limited time so I'm not showing<br>you know 100 pages of the annual reports<br>yeah<br>questions<br>yeah thank you well robots take the jobs<br>of accountants I don't believe he's very<br>interesting question but I don't believe<br>so because I still believe that human<br>being create rubber so they can't<br>actually overtake but they actually can<br>help human beings to perform the tasks<br>all the repetitive tasks might be taken<br>away because you can see that for<br>example I just look at a little example<br>I um there's a shop down there sometimes<br>I shop there for a little girl they call<br>government they actually only over the<br>last few weeks they try to incorporate<br>everything online because in the past<br>when you actually shop there they can't<br>tell what is the stock like if you can't<br>find the size there they won't be able<br>to search on the internet to see what's<br>going on there but now it will last<br>people to try and incorporate into a<br>system where they can transfer stock<br>from one store to the other how they<br>actually link to the online store so I<br>believe that Robotech or some sort of<br>Technology can help them to incorporate<br>the system but they still need the human<br>being behind the scene because they<br>can't actually tell the program to run<br>the thing like let's say that you know<br>how to link the stuff with the same<br>products here with the same Tech linked<br>to one of the other is you still hit<br>your brain working on that<br>so I don't believe I think people's away<br>I think student always get into the<br>accounting they say okay I don't want to<br>do accounting because I might lose my<br>job in the long run but in fact it's not<br>yeah in fact that when it's the moment<br>even actually after covid-19 we the<br>companies you know in the industry and<br>also in the public sector they are so in<br>demand for accounting and auditors<br>yeah<br>so I hope that I have answered your<br>question yeah I found the same thing<br>with programming as well like for<br>example you can they say programming is<br>great to help you but in fact that I<br>still have to think like when I do my<br>research if you want to match this one<br>with this one you still have to doing a<br>small thing<br>in the math book before you actually can<br>write the code<br>because otherwise you know the program<br>will be able to help<br>yeah<br>so<br>I was I was just going to feed into that<br>conversation around the the robots that<br>that's um that's a really kind of one<br>that I know some of our professional<br>bodies are also grappling with we've<br>done quite a lot of work with<br>um cans on CP Australia who are are<br>really trying to sort of change that<br>profile of accounting and actually I'd<br>be really interested to hear what you're<br>thinking about you know are your<br>students coming with that perception<br>when they're looking to choose a county<br>in your courses are they even aware of<br>what accounting might look like into now<br>and into the future so I think it's a<br>really important<br>um question to raise it is trying to be<br>addressed uh lovely to love to hear<br>ideas again just pop the microphone on<br>you don't have to hold it you just pop<br>it in the middle and then uh online<br>um I am a trust accountant being a<br>chartered accountant for 15 years<br>have I done a pier now<br>I can't remember the last plan now I've<br>actually done<br>um I don't think from a professional<br>point of view we're ever going to get<br>out of<br>um<br>a robot because of the standards they<br>are<br>there is so much interpretation within<br>the standards that you have to have<br>someone to interpret the standards to be<br>able to apply it<br>um that's never going to go away and<br>different countries around the world<br>you're going<br>the standards aren't Unified<br>there are international standards but<br>even every country applies it<br>differently<br>so that standardization is not going to<br>happen because you're always going to<br>have someone<br>nowadays from my experience<br>bookkeeping no that's that can be<br>standardized<br>you add the advice for the business if a<br>business wants to come has a problem<br>they come to you<br>come to accountants or they come to<br>their lawyers more than likely they're<br>going to come to your accountants for<br>business advice do you as an accountant<br>you're more of a business advisor<br>than actually doing the numbers numbers<br>all that sort of thing can be done like<br>for example using a software like zero<br>or something like they can streamline<br>but there's always going to be<br>error and that's where you're adding<br>value is being able to pick up the<br>errors that<br>non-accountants actually put in<br>next we add value as accountants<br>so I've seen a shift in the 20 years<br>I've been accounted from yet the number<br>crunching to actually being an advisor<br>and actually adding value<br>and there's a huge shift now to the edit<br>value and that to me is a<br>a person that's more exciting<br>and that's how I sell it to the kids is<br>yeah you need to know the basic stuff<br>but are you<br>are you going to do it as a lifetime<br>thing now<br>you need to know it to be able to answer<br>the question but you you're going to be<br>the business advisor oh we've got a<br>comment from Sarah who's joining us from<br>uh Auckland um from Christian School<br>saying um and her her kind of um<br>perspective it's not so much the<br>students but it's hearing from the<br>parents about what of a waste of time<br>teaching accounting is because it'll all<br>be done by robots and that Sarah tells<br>them that financial decision making is<br>essential and that knowledge should be<br>valued but that she thinks that parents<br>who are not attached to that kind of<br>accounting Financial sort of information<br>world don't recognize the value of it<br>quite so clearly so another<br>um we've talked earlier in the day about<br>the kind of sections of parents around<br>our subject areas<br>and other teachers we have the added<br>main as well they came out by looking<br>into the future and stuff but they said<br>but only ever before attendance needed<br>in New Zealand or something I'm not<br>trying to went through our community and<br>we had a drop off in numbers around that<br>time and just in the media yeah<br>yeah the thing I always tell that my<br>students is that in the times I've used<br>an accountant I've had my own accountant<br>in the past I would never to draw a meal<br>book profit and lost account or a or a<br>balance sheet it was to tell me what<br>things I could climb back and what<br>should be going in there and have to<br>analyze how my way business was going in<br>yeah it wasn't for things like you were<br>stereotypes of course if you ever ask a<br>class majority of a picture of an<br>accountant and you did some interesting<br>results<br>um which is a challenge<br>um but secondly<br>um to what extent can<br>oh what am I thinking of here<br>um<br>yeah I think my main concern is around<br>stereotypes and stereotypes and what<br>sort of personality is do accounting I<br>hate to say that but secondly just about<br>every student I've come across is<br>I don't like maths and you're trying to<br>explain them that's not myths<br>and I don't know where that persists and<br>and you invested a lot I don't know what<br>sort of skills they need<br>University<br>I think it was great I think I'm just<br>trying to maybe I can share the point<br>maybe not from because I we always have<br>the argument in our school about you<br>know when students coming into our<br>program they they don't have enough met<br>skill and also they don't have enough<br>some kind of called The Literacy like<br>the writing skill also but I believe it<br>is more the role from the school also<br>when the student came through like to<br>learn but my belief is like if we still<br>keep on the way of teaching mathematics<br>in a way that we used to<br>you won't be able to get the student<br>going to you know to appreciate the<br>beauty of math<br>so I think it's now would be a more<br>applied I remember that you know I was<br>educated in Asia like in Vietnam back to<br>China I've learned a lot about math<br>until I was at high school but to be<br>honest I don't know what it's used for<br>not until actually during my first year<br>at unsw that way I know where the math<br>can be applied in<br>business by for example like in finance<br>for example like when you're using you<br>know we learn about all the you know the<br>um the square the parable this one here<br>is about how you're maximizing or going<br>to the minimum point or whatever but I<br>think I believe it's more about learning<br>through apply case it might be a bit<br>easier but for example like I remember<br>that when I was doing my the paper they<br>called the paper that I enjoy the most<br>is they call the apply modeling for fund<br>management so basically a lot of excel<br>skill in there basically the lecturer<br>only asked us that okay you guys pick up<br>100 company listed on the Australian<br>stock exchange and you're starting to<br>run a portfolio you can maximize doesn't<br>matter what theory you're using but we<br>want to see the if you know they call<br>the efficient Frontier that where you<br>can see that where you can minimize the<br>variant and maximize the return okay but<br>he wants us to do it manually not<br>through the programming because if<br>you're doing through the VBA basic<br>flavor you don't actually see how it's<br>going so we actually maximize every<br>single point and draw the line itself so<br>it might be a fun one like you can<br>create some kind of little thing for<br>your student to do and they can apply<br>the math and I think the other day that<br>my husband actually gave me one of the<br>link to a website they call the girl who<br>loved quote because we have a girl at<br>home and I'm always interested in girl<br>education<br>because we only have one girl in our<br>family but they she actually designed<br>quite a lot of things about design about<br>applying assign how you can using python<br>in other programming but in a context</p></main><footer style="margin-top: 2rem; background: #0001; padding: 2rem; text-align: center;"><p>We Are The University</p><ul
