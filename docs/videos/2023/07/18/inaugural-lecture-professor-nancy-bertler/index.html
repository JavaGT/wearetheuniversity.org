Subsequent IPCC warnings grew more urgent as evidence became clearer and understanding of the risks deepened. More than a century of uncontrolled burning of fossil fuels, unsustainable agricultural practises, and staggering land-use changes have caused global temperatures to now soar to 1.1°C above preindustrial levels, moving society from projecting climate change to experiencing the consequences. Climate change is affecting every region across the globe, incurring exorbitant costs and intolerable trauma to communities. <br>Antarctica—magnificent, vast, timeless, and elusive—plays a critical role in how Earth’s climate will evolve. <br>In this lecture, Professor Nancy Bertler discusses how Antarctica’s ice sheets revealed critical insights into our future and why the response is a matter of urgency for us all.</p><h2>Transcript</h2><p style="opacity: 0.9; font-size: 0.8em">Transcripts may be automatically generated and may not be 100% accurate.</p><p>foreign<br>a very well warm welcome to you all<br>colleagues students are broader public<br>Community to the inaugural lecture of<br>Professor Nancy Butler<br>an internationally recognized professor<br>of Earth Sciences from the Antarctic<br>Research Center here at tahiring awaka<br>Victoria University of Wellington<br>I'm Professor Margaret Hyland I'm Deputy<br>Vice Chancellor of research and it's my<br>pleasure to welcome you here this<br>evening<br>inaugural lectures are always special<br>there are opportunity to celebrate our<br>new professors to hear their passion for<br>their research and to learn something<br>new<br>um it's one of my favorite parts of my<br>job and tonight is extra special<br>um because it's my first time to<br>introduce a new professor<br>and I couldn't be more excited than to<br>be introducing Nancy Butler who's<br>somebody that I particularly respect and<br>admire<br>um in a minute in a minute I'll tell you<br>about some of the amazing achievements<br>that have led to her promotion to<br>Professor<br>um but I first wanted to just pull out<br>one in particular that resonates with me<br>and that's her role as director of the<br>Antarctic research platform so the<br>Antarctic research platform if you're<br>not familiar with it is a 49 million<br>dollar investment by government it pulls<br>together about a hundred researchers<br>from across the country from Seven<br>universities from four Crown research<br>Institutes<br>um and supports about half of our<br>research capability in this particular<br>area<br>I was in mba's Chief scientist when it<br>was being established and I think it's<br>fair to say there was a certain amount<br>of nervousness about getting it right I<br>think previous Platforms in other areas<br>have not quite worked the way they'd<br>expected them to and there was a<br>recognition that leadership was going to<br>be a really important part of success<br>uh leaders of this kind of large complex<br>collaborative Venture need to be more<br>than just highly respected researchers<br>they need to have the trust of many<br>different and sometimes warring research<br>communities<br>stakeholders and the funder and they<br>need to be able to pull these diverse<br>communities together to achieve some<br>pretty ambitious goals<br>in in other words they need to be<br>somebody pretty special<br>somebody like Nancy and I think the<br>success of the platform is a great<br>Professor bertner has been a part of our<br>University final since the early 2000s<br>completing her PhD in geology here in<br>2004. she's a cross-institutional leader<br>and is well known for juggling many<br>roles around alteador we share her with<br>JNS science where she is a principal<br>scientist<br>at the University as in the Antarctic<br>research platform her leadership has<br>been effective and invaluable she's<br>responsible for developing our ice core<br>program and research facilities through<br>her collaboration with gns for<br>developing our undergraduate course on<br>climate change that educates the next<br>generation of climate Leaders with the<br>tools to determine the future of<br>ourotearoa's community's environment and<br>economy<br>and for developing these leaders<br>directly and personally<br>having supervised seven Masters and 12<br>PhD students<br>Professor bertel is a trusted advisor<br>beyond the university as well<br>she regularly serves as a Scientific<br>Advisor for mphat delegations to<br>International committees and notably<br>forming part of the delegation to the<br>44th Antarctic treaty meeting last year<br>she regularly provides briefings and<br>presentations to ministers both<br>domestically and internationally<br>informing our leaders of the latest in<br>Antarctic research and she's chair of<br>the international science advisory panel<br>of securing antarctic's environmental<br>future<br>um it's no surprise that Professor<br>burtler is so highly sought after and<br>well regarded<br>as an early Pioneer in targeting and<br>interpreting ice core records from<br>Antarctic coastal regions her research<br>expertise is preeminent<br>she's focused on understanding<br>Antarctica's response to and its ability<br>to influence global climate change<br>very deservedly Professor burtler's<br>research Excellence has been recognized<br>several times over<br>she received the prime minister's<br>science prize wellingtonian of the Year<br>Science and Technology award and the<br>2016 sir sir Peter Blake leaders award<br>we are fortunate to have professor<br>bertler as part of our faculty here at<br>tahirangawaka unfortunate also to have<br>the opportunity to hear from her tonight<br>and the focus of Professor burtler's<br>inaugural lecture this evening is how<br>Antarctica's ice sheets have revealed<br>critical insights into our future and<br>why the response is a matter of urgency<br>for us all<br>Antarctica magnificent fast Timeless and<br>Elusive plays a critical role in how<br>earth's climate will evolve and its<br>people like Professor bertler who play<br>their own critical role in understanding<br>antarcticus<br>it's my pleasure to Welcome to the<br>podium Professor Nancy Butler<br>kotokatoa<br>the hunger fakahirahira taitafiti<br>introduction and so they could feel my<br>shoulders<br>buckling and the very nice things that<br>you said<br>colleagues and friends thank you so much<br>for coming today it's really lovely to<br>see you all here in this Wellington<br>evening<br>and I would like to start by pointing<br>out a couple very special people<br>I'm really proud that my mom CeCe<br>attends today's meeting<br>my mother is one of my superheroes and<br>most important role model<br>also my sister Shannon would have liked<br>to be here today<br>and she is a huge source of endless<br>inspiration for me and of course my<br>wonderful partner Dean who many of you<br>will know as well Lung Association with<br>Antarctica and passion for research and<br>sort of who has the ability to pull me<br>out into optimism if some of the future<br>today<br>we are very well familiar with the<br>concept of Standing on<br>the shoulders of shines and I think this<br>is normal in science we know that we're<br>contributing to a body of work<br>that those that came before us have<br>developed<br>and the nice mihimihi that the wonderful<br>Professor Sandy Morrison from waikato<br>helped me to put together acknowledge<br>those that came before us in the family<br>that we build around us to advance the<br>knowledge and to explore new knowledge<br>with having the privilege to be part of<br>the Antarctic Research Center<br>um really ingrains these values and I<br>would like to<br>um<br>highlight in particular<br>Professor Peter Barrett<br>Peter of course is the founder of the<br>Antarctic Research Center some 51 years<br>ago<br>and has instilled huge values that are<br>valid in the Antarctic Research Center<br>today<br>when I called Peter in the late 90s<br>while he was in Antarctica to ask him<br>whether it would be a good idea<br>to add an ice core record to the K<br>Province project that he was busy<br>leading at the time<br>The Logical answer should have been<br>that's ridiculous but Peter somehow saw<br>a possibility in this<br>and so Peter<br>along with Paul mayevsky from the U.S<br>Tim Nash and Alex Pine this remarkable<br>group of people<br>have encouraged me guided me and<br>supported me<br>to build the iscore capability in New<br>Zealand<br>of course as we started this journey the<br>founder became bigger and people on this<br>slide really made instrumental<br>contributions to allowing us to develop<br>the science to develop the capability to<br>have access to Antarctica and to get it<br>right<br>and really as this program evolved my<br>biggest sort of pleasure in this was<br>really working with the many many early<br>career researchers brilliant determined<br>and just so smart contributing in huge<br>ways of the knowledge that we have as a<br>final together developed and advanced<br>so I think like any of us when we give<br>talks we know that we're presenting on<br>behalf of a large<br>um community and so I just wanted to<br>share with you how humbled I am to<br>present on behalf this wonderful nice<br>okay to the talk<br>I thought I'll lead you through a<br>journey where I demonstrate how<br>important Antarctica is for us to<br>understand current climate change to<br>provide a Baseline and barometer to<br>which measured against how odd the world<br>has become<br>and then to explore how this changes<br>also affecting Antarctic as a climate<br>change victim in its own right but of<br>course<br>Antarctica's response has Global<br>consequences and it does because it is<br>also a major climate driver<br>and then really conclude on how we have<br>transitioned now to predicting climate<br>change to live in the age of climate<br>so as an ice core person I talk a lot<br>about ice perhaps more than other<br>antarcticians so I thought it would be<br>useful to just very Briefly summarize<br>the three major groups of ice of course<br>there's many more than those three<br>but there's an ice sheet so this is snow<br>that falls onto a continent and then<br>accumulates up to thickness of four<br>kilometers that slowly makes this way in<br>a slow Journey to the edge of the<br>Antarctic ice sheet when it hits the<br>ocean it starts to float and this is the<br>part where we call an ice shelf they can<br>still be over a kilometer thick but they<br>comfortably Bob with the tides<br>and then sea ice is frozen ocean water<br>that just freezes when a cold gets cold<br>enough to do so<br>we have the big Antarctic is a sheet and<br>the smaller brother the Western tactic<br>ice sheet<br>I'd like to take you on the journey with<br>the project that I have become very<br>entitled or not entitled that's really<br>the wrong word very close to and have<br>been privileged to be the chief<br>scientist for the last decade the<br>Roosevelt Island climate Evolution<br>project it's a huge collaboration many<br>nations are involved many institutions<br>and it's hugely interdisciplinary<br>we drilled an ice core from this<br>beautiful little flat pancake Rosewood<br>Island hit the northern edge of the Ross<br>ice shelf about a thousand kilometers<br>and the focus of this project was really<br>to understand like many other<br>researchers at the time and still do how<br>close the Western tactic eye sheet is to<br>irreversible collapse how soon we would<br>have to cross that path that threshold<br>to see very dramatic changes in sea<br>level rise for centuries to come<br>so when you travel to Antarctica you're<br>incredibly privileged of course<br>you come you jump out of this plane in<br>the middle of nowhere it's called it<br>smashes a little bit around the face as<br>you exit the plane and you get the sense<br>how how small you are how wonderful this<br>planet is<br>very quickly afterwards you do some<br>training you pack all your gear and you<br>end up in the field so this was our<br>camp at Roosevelt Island<br>we spent in total three years there to<br>prepare and drill and then Alex Darcy<br>mandeno very kindly spent a fourth<br>season cleaning up afterwards but during<br>those three seasons we spent 11 months<br>in the field you get to know your fellow<br>members very very well<br>and I think it's one of these places<br>that you add to your scientific skills<br>also life skills that are very difficult<br>to get in other places<br>you're not only the scientists you are<br>the mechanic<br>you are a flight air traffic controller<br>you're a medic your chef<br>you're sometimes the counselor and<br>sometimes they're to be counseled<br>I think that spending the time in<br>Antarctica with this amazing team gives<br>you some skills that are applicable in<br>many places in the world and helped me<br>to deal with some of the management of<br>larger projects hopefully in a better<br>way<br>of the work that we do as a scientist in<br>for an ice co-work for the ice core work<br>is really below the surface so this is<br>the drilling trench dazi mandeno is<br>operating the New Zealand intermediate<br>ice core drill this is one of three such<br>drills available in the world<br>and they produce this beautiful<br>Sparkling Ice course<br>to us they look like Tonga to others<br>them I just look like frozen ice cubes<br>but they're rich of information and they<br>really revolutionize the way we think<br>about the Earth system<br>while we were doing that work there's<br>also lots of other activities going on<br>for example here's a couple of students<br>that take a huge amount of snow samples<br>at the same time<br>but every so often the friendly camborg<br>team would come when the weather would<br>allow it<br>take our Tonga and bring it back to<br>scope base where it eventually would<br>make its Journey back to New Zealand to<br>the National High School facility at gns<br>science<br>they are international Partners would<br>come for this particular project that<br>came for three years every year for<br>three months and again we operated in 24<br>7 operation with 12-hour shifts and the<br>people in this image here work at -20 or<br>minus 30 degrees depending on the work<br>that we did<br>for 12 hours<br>for three months and I'm pretty sure<br>that the national chocolate consumption<br>in New Zealand went up during that time<br>period<br>so here's when we cut the core we<br>prepare all the pieces we do some<br>initial measurements and then eventually<br>that ice is being put next door into a<br>clean room facility where again we melt<br>the core and attach that melted to a<br>large number of instruments that measure<br>in real time gigabytes of data that Zoom<br>through back through time and tell us as<br>we melt the core already some of its<br>deepest secrets<br>at the same time it was attacking<br>thousands of samples some of which are<br>being analyzed in New Zealand and some<br>of being analyzed with Labs all over the<br>world<br>so having gone through this massive<br>effort what did we learn from these<br>baselines from these invaluable<br>opportunities to lengthen our<br>observations<br>well this is a figure that Peter and I<br>created a number of years ago but I'm<br>still very attached to it and so I keep<br>updating it<br>the top panel there shows you two worlds<br>the Northern Hemisphere during an Ice<br>Age covered with large ice sheets in<br>today's world with just a small<br>Greenland left<br>what is really interesting between the<br>comparison of those two worlds is that<br>the global temperature difference<br>between those vastly different<br>environments is just six degrees<br>so when we talk about future climate<br>change of one two three or four degrees<br>it is a remarkably large numbers these<br>are remarkably different climate systems<br>and Earth Systems that we're talking<br>about<br>I don't think I need to explain too much<br>about the actual graph that shows the<br>beautiful fostok ice core the last four<br>hundred thousand years of temperature<br>and then from the bubbles we have<br>released the samples to measure the<br>extra content of the atmosphere of<br>methane and CO2 concentrations and of<br>course we can see how much in sync the<br>temperature and the greenhouse gases is<br>which was one of the ways to demonstrate<br>the close relationship of the warming<br>that we see today from the greenhouse<br>gases<br>and of course in the right part of the<br>image we see that rapid increase in the<br>greenhouse gas emissions<br>um<br>and so what what did we learn from these<br>comparisons<br>well we learned<br>that methane has increased by a hundred<br>percent in the past 200 years<br>that is responsible for about 30 percent<br>of the warming<br>and that it has a short lifetime six to<br>12 years so when we switch it off<br>methane will be gone fairly quickly<br>CO2 increased by about 50 percent in the<br>last 200 years<br>over the last 11 years it increased<br>every year by about two parts per<br>million which is the fastest increase in<br>the last 65 years that we have a record<br>from measurements which means we're on<br>the wrong track we're still accelerating<br>on how on our emissions<br>during covet<br>for the first six months of 2020 we<br>actually had a 4.6 decrease<br>in CO2 we're made up for it at the<br>second part of the year<br>but to put into perspective of how big<br>the challenge is that lies ahead to<br>achieve the pairs agreement to limit<br>warming to 1.5 to 2 degrees we have to<br>reduce greenhouse gases by 45 by 2030.<br>since the next seven years we have to<br>find ways to have more or less our<br>missions and then of course come to Net<br>Zero by 2050.<br>in terms of temperature when we look at<br>these graphs the temperature increase<br>doesn't mirror the quick and dramatic<br>increase in the greenhouse gases and the<br>reason for that is that 90 to 96 percent<br>of the greenhouse gas warming is<br>absorbed by the oceans and about<br>two-thirds of that by the Southern Ocean<br>which really highlights the importance<br>in June 2023 so just a month ago<br>Global surface temperatures<br>exceeded 1.5 degrees of pre-industrial<br>levels<br>and the 4th of July<br>was the hottest day globally on record<br>of course these records were broken as<br>we just came out of a prolonged La Nina<br>phase we're now heading into an El Nino<br>phase and during El Nino the way what is<br>usually is somewhat warmer<br>so buckle up these records are likely to<br>so while ice core records are really<br>good to extend observation the<br>observational record because of their<br>tremendous resolution<br>and continuous nature<br>when we want to look ahead we actually<br>exceed the time of that is captured of<br>the variability that's captured in the<br>ice course to look to the Future<br>so here again this is a figure from the<br>ipcc that's a bit busy but please let me<br>talk you through it's a very interesting<br>graph<br>that shows the beautiful Epica is called<br>record 800 000 years of data at the<br>bottom we have temperature and at the<br>and then we go further back in time<br>millions of years and tens of millions<br>of years where geological sedimentary<br>records have added to our knowledge of<br>temperature and CO2 globally<br>when you now look towards the right<br>where we see the observations and then<br>the choices of our emission Pathways you<br>can see that with the CO2 concentration<br>the low emission future sort of Paris<br>agreement is still high in CO2 than at<br>any time during the ice course during<br>the last one million years we actually<br>have to go back to the mid pliers in<br>about three million years ago but where<br>CO2 was 400 parts per million<br>and if we go to higher Mission scenarios<br>such as the intermediate one the yellow<br>one or the high emission scenario the<br>red one<br>we have to go back even further in time<br>to the early eosine<br>so what does that mean those three<br>globes that are below that curve show<br>you the temperature distribution during<br>those times around the world we can see<br>2020 we already have a bit of warming in<br>comparison to pre-industrials or before<br>global warming started<br>the mid-pliocene again is quite a bit<br>warmer than that<br>and the early Hollis interest looks<br>scary<br>it's unbelievably hot and very extreme<br>in its temperature<br>so these reconstructions were incredibly<br>important to now inform verify and and<br>interrogate models that try to predict<br>the future and if they can represent<br>those paths well our confidence and how<br>they can predict the future increases<br>so on the right hand side you now see<br>the predictions for some of our choices<br>so at the bottom you see the Paris<br>agreement with a low emission scenario<br>and you can see 2100 is still a bit<br>warmer than 2020.<br>but 2300 actually is cooler again so<br>we're then starting in this scenario the<br>Earth can recover<br>if we're going with the high emission<br>scenario<br>the top panel you can see the 2100 is<br>warmer than the mid pliosine in many<br>places<br>but 2300 the Earth is continuing to warm<br>and so by 2300 the earth looks very<br>similar we're approaching conditions of<br>the early years in which are really very<br>different and I don't think any one of<br>us understands what such a world would<br>actually look like<br>so that's temperature and CO2<br>now let's look what that means for sea<br>level rise<br>again this is perhaps a graph that's a<br>little bit old by now from Andrea Dutton<br>and colleagues in 2015 but it's so<br>simple and so powerful that I'm still<br>very attached to it<br>this graph Compares CO2 concentration<br>Global temperature at various times in<br>the past<br>and seeks to understand its<br>relationships with sea level rise<br>so we can see that in the in that<br>current in the modern present we have<br>one degree warming<br>and we're trying to figure out where<br>we're heading with sea level rice<br>the last interglacial was a little bit<br>warmer than today about a degree woman<br>and today<br>CO2 was only at 290 80 parts per million<br>so way lower than it is today but sea<br>level was six to nine meters higher<br>already<br>if we go to one what we call a super<br>interglacious or slightly warmer<br>interglacial yet again 400 000 years ago<br>temperatures were one to two degrees<br>warmer than pre-industrial<br>and sea level was about 6 to 13 meters<br>higher<br>if we go to the mid-pliocene so two to<br>three degrees warmer<br>than sea level was about 20 meters<br>higher a number that Andrew has tried to<br>firm up<br>so of course now<br>in 2022 CO2 was 417 parts per million<br>which is about here and so it's<br>currently certainly the future that<br>we're heading for<br>so if we take all these baselines the<br>past reconstructions what do they tell<br>us about today<br>how different is today than from what<br>the natural world should look like<br>this is again a summary from the<br>International Panel on climate change<br>the ipcc but nicely summarized by the<br>World Resources Institute<br>and what's different is that CO2<br>concentrations are unmatched for the<br>last two million years glacial Retreat<br>is faster than at any time in the last<br>2000 years the last decade was warmer<br>than any period in the last 125 000<br>years<br>sea level rises faster than any prior<br>Century for the last 3000 years<br>the summer arctic ice cover is smaller<br>than at any time in the last millennium<br>ocean warming is faster than any time<br>since the last ice age<br>and ocean acidification is its highest<br>level of the last 20 26 000 years<br>so considering that our world is vastly<br>different than what it should be we can<br>now turn to Antarctica and see how<br>this is an image taken by once only from<br>the Korean Antarctic program at the<br>nansen eye shelf in 2014.<br>when I started my PhD in the late 90s<br>I certainly did not expect to see in my<br>lifetime liquid water running off an ice<br>sheet or a shelf in Antarctica and<br>definitely not in 2014.<br>so Antarctica is changing in many many<br>places<br>and we could talk about a lot of<br>different parameters including<br>The Rossi Marine protected area the<br>largest protected Marine area in the<br>world that is located in the Rossi<br>region<br>but I would like to focus on just three<br>parameters here is most loss CS changes<br>an Antarctic bottom water<br>because these are three parameters<br>with their changes<br>so we're starting off with ice Mass loss<br>this is a beautiful animation by the<br>grace satellite that measures elevation<br>changes from 2002 to 2020 and what you<br>can see in Antarctica here is these<br>beautiful rivers of ice<br>that are transcending to the ice shelves<br>and exiting Antarctica through the ice<br>shelves so when I start this animation<br>now<br>you can see the color change implicates<br>the elevation change red and yellow it<br>means that it's lowering blue is where<br>it's growing<br>but the scale is just from plus one to<br>minus four meters<br>and you can see that there's specific<br>areas where the ice masses is losing<br>very quickly and we're now in a time<br>where it has accelerated<br>where it's going fast and Fast and<br>particular in West Antarctica but also<br>in some other areas like the Antarctic<br>Peninsula and in around East Antarctica<br>here's a brief area where there's no<br>data and we're back to data and we can<br>if we now compare<br>these changes<br>was the underlying bedrock so I'm just<br>letting it run through again but explain<br>the bedrock in the meantime<br>where we have the brown and yellow<br>colors you have large mountain ranges<br>many of them buried by the ice sheet<br>above and where you have the blue colors<br>the ice sheet itself is actually<br>grounded below sea level at times up to<br>2000 meters below sea level<br>and you can see it's the blue areas the<br>areas where the ice sheet is below the<br>sea level where we see the largest<br>change<br>in the Antarctic<br>and the configuration of the ice sheet<br>in these places means that it's<br>susceptible to instabilities<br>and that's really worrisome because it<br>means once we have crossed a certain<br>Tipping Point where the ice has<br>retreated sufficiently<br>a self and reinforcing process kicks in<br>radiation accelerates and accelerates in<br>its loss until it's collapsed even if<br>we're in the meantime switch off the<br>forcing the greenhouse gas emissions<br>so this means that we can really commit<br>future generations for centuries to come<br>to sea level race even if maybe in 20 or<br>30 years time we're successful in<br>switching off our greenhouse gases<br>so in summary what are the Perils of sea<br>level rise<br>well to date we had 20 centimeters of<br>sea level rise<br>since 2006 that sea level rise is<br>dominated by the loss of glaciers and<br>ice sheets<br>but 2050 about 800 million people will<br>be affected by coastal flooding through<br>Rising seas and intensified storms at<br>the coast<br>in a lower Mission future so Paris<br>agreement type future<br>we still will see a total of 50<br>centimeter<br>sea level rise which is absolutely<br>locked into the system so it's something<br>that we need to mitigate and adapt to<br>in some places in New Zealand that turns<br>a hundred year flood into an annual<br>event in the last few months we got a<br>lot more acquainted to that sort of<br>scenario<br>in a high emissions scenario a high<br>emission future<br>more than one meter of sea level rise is<br>plausible by the end of the century and<br>of course we have these tipping points<br>if we pass these tipping points and we<br>believe that some parts of the Antarctic<br>Ice Sheets are approaching in this<br>threshold of irreversible collapse then<br>future Generations will pay the price no<br>matter what our actions are there<br>um beyond that triggering point<br>if you wanted to know a little bit more<br>what sea level vulnerability is for<br>particular Community you're interested<br>in or your own property or just<br>generally around New Zealand perhaps<br>check out the New Zealand zeros program<br>Richard and Tim leading this program and<br>this is an interactive map that is<br>really a tremendous resource where you<br>can zoom into almost property level to<br>see future projections on sea level rise<br>in in around New Zealand<br>so now I would like to move to Sea ice<br>not everyone thinks about CIS a lot<br>for us it keeps us awake at night<br>especially since over the last few years<br>Antarctic sea ice undergoes dramatic<br>transformation every year<br>during winter it doubles the size of the<br>continent and it reaches about 20<br>million million square meters in size<br>and then it shrinks to about 3 million<br>square meters in summer<br>all right<br>Antarctic sea ice is incredibly<br>important<br>for the ecosystem it's a habitat it<br>regulates the biological pump so where<br>organisms absorb CO2 and sequester it it<br>regulates nutrients<br>and it's a habitat for some of the<br>keystone species that maintain the food<br>web<br>in a physical function<br>CS regulates how much the atmosphere and<br>the oceans communicate<br>it limits<br>biogenic product gas projection and with<br>that the formation of clouds which is<br>hugely important and not well understood<br>how much it can protect or will make an<br>ice surface Mobile in a bone<br>it reflects incoming radiation and<br>therefore limits solar driven surface<br>warming something that we know really<br>well from the Arctic<br>it stabilizes ice shelves but with that<br>it also stabilizes the ice sheets that<br>sit behind these ice shelves<br>it's the formation of sea ice that<br>develops dense water and with that kicks<br>off the global ocean circulation<br>it's the engine machine that drives our<br>Global ocean circulation and with that<br>how heat is moved around the entire<br>planet and also how CO2 is being dragged<br>into the depths of the ocean Basin since<br>the quest that were at least taken out<br>of the system for hundreds of years<br>so it's incredibly important<br>with the Arctic we have come to see the<br>decline in Antarctic sea ice this is a<br>graph that just shows the Cs extent<br>since 1978.<br>in the Antarctic we actually saw a<br>slight increase that was mainly<br>dominated by a CIS increase in the Ross<br>sea<br>but something remarkable happened in<br>2016. in 2016 the Antarctic sea ice<br>suddenly disappeared in a very<br>significant way<br>in about 2021 we had hopes that it might<br>recover it was a little bit of a blip<br>coming at Big up but then in 22 it's<br>that continued to really crash to<br>further minimize<br>to give you a sense of how big this<br>change is<br>Antarctica lost in three years the<br>equivalent that the Arctic lost in 30<br>years so more or less in three years the<br>Antarctic caught up with all that cos<br>laws that we have observed so sadly over<br>the past 30 years it's a massive change<br>and while we understand individual parts<br>that cause some of that disappearance we<br>don't understand the trend we're really<br>puzzled by this very significant<br>turnaround in Antarctic sea ice<br>this graph ends in 2022 because 2023<br>isn't finished yet<br>but here's a figure that captures from<br>last week where Antarctic Seas is for<br>this year<br>so the colors show the time from 1979 to<br>today 2023<br>with the annual cycle of this remarkable<br>transformation of sea ice<br>with the summer law of about 3 million<br>square kilometers<br>heading into the winter where it reaches<br>more like sort of 20 but you can see<br>that the 2023 is well set for a new<br>Minima record that yet again we see a<br>stronger disappearance of the Antarctic<br>sea ice<br>to understand what that means we now<br>the sudden the ocean<br>is not just the top of water but it's a<br>very<br>um<br>intricate system of currents that are<br>driven by salt and energy differences<br>the engine for this conveyor belt that<br>moves these currents around is the polar<br>regions where dense water is being<br>produced<br>and drives this entire conveyor this<br>important the important message from<br>this slide in here is that if you change<br>one aspect of the ocean you cannot<br>expect that it doesn't communicate<br>through the entire ocean Basin because<br>it's so connected and it's more<br>connected in the Southern Ocean than<br>anywhere else because it is connected<br>with all the major basins around the<br>world<br>so now we look in more detail of how<br>this works the engine room so we're back<br>in the Rossi under the eye shelf where<br>CRS is forming in the front and the sea<br>ice forms it rejects really salty Brines<br>for UCS to cook spaghetti for example<br>they're quite edible if you were to try<br>to do the same with Marine water it<br>would be quite salty<br>so this means that under the sea ice<br>design the the water is even saltier<br>than it normally is and because it's<br>very cold and it's very salty it's heavy<br>and so it just sinks<br>and there's a lot of it and it Cascades<br>and waterfalls down the continental<br>shelf and it's the engine that moves the<br>currents around the entire Globe so<br>changes in Sears changes in the ice<br>shelf changes in the ocean vastly have<br>implications for the entire Global ocean<br>circulation<br>so how has it changed Antarctic bottom<br>Buddha as we call that from accounts for<br>40 of the ocean<br>Global ocean volume so it's an enormous<br>dial to turn<br>in the wedel region so the other side of<br>Antarctica<br>we've already observed a 30 reduction in<br>the formation of Antarctic bottom water<br>which is linked to CS changes since<br>1992.<br>it's really important to understand that<br>this is the lower limp of that Global<br>ocean engine and if we change that that<br>engine will change<br>and with it the uptake of CO2 which<br>could result in more CO2 remaining in<br>the atmosphere and also the distribution<br>of heat and where it goes into the world<br>overall the Southern Ocean has<br>experienced warming because it's<br>absorbed the temp the the warming from<br>that's in the deeper ocean the surface<br>ocean has cooled and it is cooled<br>because of all the Melt of the ice<br>sheets<br>and pouring this really cold ice water<br>from the from the ice sheets into the<br>ocean which actually led to a very<br>significant cooling of the surface<br>waters where that occurs it also has<br>freshened and again the same reason<br>because of the meld of the ice sheet the<br>flux of fresh water into the ocean has<br>reduced its salinity<br>we see an increase in acidification and<br>that is because of the uptake of CO2<br>but also because the ocean has gotten<br>warmer and with that has less capacity<br>to uptake CO2 and we see a reduction of<br>in oxygen because of the change in the<br>ocean circulation<br>so if I would have given that talk about<br>five years ago I would now have gone<br>into so what does that mean where are<br>over the last few years we've all come<br>to terms with it that we're no longer<br>just predicting the future but actually<br>the time of the age of sort of<br>consequences has arrived we are seeing<br>these are now images from New Zealand<br>this is like oh how very devastating<br>forest fire<br>of course we have also been very<br>familiar with the many tragedies around<br>Gabrielle<br>the human aspect of this trauma<br>but also more broadly the impact on our<br>economy the droughts and floods<br>the impact on our infrastructure was<br>Rising seas and the change in our<br>environment through slopes and changes<br>to the vegetation and<br>um<br>climate parameters through extreme<br>weather events<br>one very<br>abstract way of looking at this is<br>through numbers<br>and this is a figure from The Swiss<br>reinstitute the reinsurance that<br>monitored<br>globally ensured losses since 19 1970<br>in U.S dollars billion of dollars<br>inflation adjusted to 21 values and you<br>can see in this graph blue is for<br>earthquakes and tsunami green is weather<br>related and men are man-made disasters<br>and you can see that the green Mars not<br>only dominate this increase in insurance<br>but that it's a very quick increase in<br>the last few<br>decades<br>of course these are the insured losses<br>and so here is a graph<br>but it's just a company the Munich<br>greens reinsurance which shows total<br>losses and insured losses of weather<br>related events<br>so the yellow or orange graph here is<br>very similar again to the green bars and<br>the previous figure<br>and you can see that the total losses<br>that now include the uninsured ones are<br>rising much faster than they'd show at<br>once<br>we can look at this for New Zealand so<br>these are data from the insurance<br>Council of New Zealand since 2012<br>and you also can see<br>that extreme weather claims have<br>increased over this time period<br>of course we don't have 2023 on this<br>graph yet<br>but we know from those data that about<br>675 houses are people so one in seven<br>across New Zealand live now in an area<br>prone to flooding<br>72 000 people live in areas projected to<br>five percent of New Zealand properties<br>would face a insurance premium for their<br>flood risk of one percent of their<br>property value if it was properly<br>assessed for their for their property<br>which would mean ten thousand dollars<br>two percent of houses would face a two<br>percent premium so twenty thousand<br>dollars for one million dollar home per<br>year for flood protection this certainly<br>explains also the increase in uninsured<br>losses as well of course is the global<br>footprint of where these these damages<br>are most prevalent<br>cycling Gabriel is thought to be the<br>costliest southern hemisphere tropical<br>in April treasury estimated that<br>including the preceding floods in<br>Auckland they are difficult to keep<br>apart<br>lies between 9 and 14 and a half billion<br>and just last month<br>the Insurance Council of New Zealand<br>estimated<br>that the claims that they've received by<br>June which is over a hundred thousand<br>claims would accumulate about three<br>billion dollars of insured claims<br>which of course also leaves somewhere<br>any order between 6 or 11 billion<br>so we had a watershed moment we have to<br>decide what our future should look like<br>we cannot afford climate change<br>can we afford<br>not to do something<br>this figure of the ipcc resonated in<br>particular with my thinking about the<br>future and how we might demonstrate or<br>think about it on a personal level it<br>shows the temperature history from 1900<br>till 2020 and then it faces gives us<br>choices for the future<br>but it ties it back to a person and when<br>this person is born<br>so here you can see a person born in<br>1950 is currently 70 year old and is<br>already dealing with some significant<br>climate change impacts<br>however the person who is born now<br>or as a child right now<br>our choices in the next even just seven<br>years will determine the future of the<br>life and the livelihood of this person<br>so the very low and the lower scenarios<br>are the Paris agreements and you can see<br>that<br>by the end of it the warming actually<br>could stop and we could see a reduction<br>in temperatures again<br>for the intermediate and high emission<br>scenarios<br>the warming will not stop at 2100 but<br>will continue to rise<br>this figure also demonstrates that even<br>if we miss the Paris agreement<br>that we cannot stop<br>it is not just one threshold and<br>everything is lost it is a very<br>important threshold and we should<br>collectively work to achieve it with<br>everything that we can<br>but if we cannot achieve it the<br>intermediate scenario is still better<br>for that person than the high or the<br>very high so every reduction that we<br>achieve is worth it and if we can<br>achieve enough to stay below the air<br>Paris agreement then overall we win<br>um as Humanity<br>so I thought I'll finish on this<br>particular slide and bring you back to<br>Roosevelt Island<br>this was on a morning<br>um I think four o'clock in the morning I<br>went to read out the weather for an<br>incoming aircraft and I saw this rainbow<br>you can see bows in Antarctica but<br>normally they're white<br>and they're white because the atmosphere<br>is frozen so this picture has<br>tremendous Beauty and irony and sadness<br>all in one<br>because the colors in this rainbow<br>showed us that there's liquid water<br>droplets in the atmosphere and what an<br>irony here we are drilling to find out<br>how close the West Antarctic ice sheet<br>is to irreversible collapse well for the<br>first time we see liquid water at almost<br>80 degrees south in a cool part of<br>Antarctica that tells us that perhaps<br>we're a bit too late<br>and the future is coming faster than we<br>think<br>so the window of opportunity to secure<br>livable and sustainable future for us<br>are always rapidly closing the ipcc<br>warns us<br>to achieve the Paris agreement<br>we need to reduce greenhouse gas<br>emissions by 45 by 2030. and we need to<br>reach Net Zero by 2050.<br>it is<br>incredibly important that we try<br>everything we can to come to this goal<br>but it's all equally important that if<br>we miss the goal post that we do not<br>give up<br>one thing that we cannot afford is an<br>action the future that comes with it is<br>not acceptable and not affordable to any<br>of us<br>namahinoi<br>I'm Rob Mackay I'm the director at the<br>tipuna patio tier Antarctic Research<br>Center and it's my honor and privilege<br>to propose a voter thanks for Nancy's<br>Professor Nancy bertlers in Norwood<br>lecture<br>greetings also to Nancy's family her<br>mother and her partner Dean who we<br>many of us in this room as Nancy pointed<br>out also know through the Antarctic<br>Community it's our pleasure to have you<br>joining us here today<br>so in this inaugural lecture we've been<br>honestly here Professor burtler provide<br>an insight into Antarctica's ice sheets<br>the critical insights they reveal to our<br>future and why our response is a matter<br>of urgency we are living in the age of<br>consequences<br>from someone that knows Nancy very well<br>and I actually know and Nancy since she<br>was doing her PhD I was a master's<br>student here at the time what I think<br>needs to be emphasized in here is just<br>not only the fact that she can cover<br>this broad range of communication about<br>the impacts I mean climate change on the<br>global systems but also her fundamental<br>leaderships and achievements within her<br>specialized discipline of ice scoring<br>and we saw just how impressive that was<br>to the Roosevelt Island work<br>now a few years ago I followed a Nazis<br>footstep I applied for a fellowship that<br>she went for the Rutherford Discovery<br>fellowships and one of the key aspects<br>of that to get one of those Awards is<br>leadership and so I thought as you do<br>when you're doing an application you<br>look at a previous example and I took<br>Nancy's leadership page<br>and I have to say I was pretty<br>intimidated I pretty much put it away<br>straight away because there was no way<br>in how I was going to be able to emulate<br>those achievements they were very very<br>unique<br>um I couldn't even come close to it<br>so it was very clear you know Nancy<br>pointed out the start of her talk they<br>should stand on the shoulders of Josh<br>Giants<br>and<br>um you know I think nowadays and<br>particularly at that time even looking<br>at leadership document it was very clear<br>that people were starting to stand on<br>her shoulder to that point and now the<br>entire Antarctic community in New<br>Zealand is standing on her shoulders as<br>their leadership within the Antarctic<br>science platform and<br>so as a PhD student she came over here<br>she pointed out in the introduction as<br>Margaret that that<br>we didn't do ice cream in New Zealand<br>she took it on as a PhD shooter she<br>created this whole capability out of her<br>own hard work and vision<br>by 2004 she had just finished a PhD she<br>built an ice core facility out at gns<br>science I mean who does that one or two<br>years out from a PhD it's incredibly<br>impressive<br>she's since become a world leading<br>expert in high school and she has<br>recognized on the international stage of<br>this work leading major panels with the<br>scientific committee on Antarctica<br>research<br>and culminating in the Roosevelt Island<br>climate Evolution project she had 13<br>field Seasons under her belt and then<br>leads a 12 million dollar project in<br>Antarctica with nine different countries<br>and it was a remarkable success<br>she coordinates science at National and<br>international level as I said she's<br>director of that Antarctic science<br>platform that's a 49 million dollar<br>program for the entire country working<br>to solve some of the biggest challenges<br>globally and and place in New Zealand as<br>leaders in understanding Antarctic<br>so what we're seeing tonight is Nancy's<br>passion and Leadership and climate<br>change science and communication more<br>broadly<br>this is something she's always been at<br>the Forefront of even as she was coming<br>out of that PhD she had the vision to<br>set up the first dedicated climate<br>change course in the University<br>um you know this provides a<br>comprehensive view not just of the<br>science of climate change and as you saw<br>at the end of Nancy's talk some of the<br>impacts on the economy society as well<br>as sort of guiding how government<br>strategies might mitigate and adapt to<br>the threat of climate change which was<br>emerging at the time and now we're<br>living as Nancy says in the age of<br>consequences<br>so she used the vision her knowledge and<br>the connections to experts its ability<br>for her to find connections across<br>communities that is just so remarkable<br>and that was something she developed<br>that course very early on bringing in<br>experts from downtown from government to<br>talk to our students and train the next<br>generation of scientists policy makers<br>to to understand how to manage this<br>threat<br>so that's my privilege to offer this<br>photo thanks to Nancy she's provided an<br>example of leadership and scholarship<br>that in my view is the very definition<br>of what a professor should be and I<br>welcome you now all to join us in the<br>hunter common room for refreshments and<br>some<br>but first of all just ask you to have a<br>round of applause what was really a<br>foreign</p></main><footer style="margin-top: 2rem; background: #0001; padding: 2rem; text-align:
