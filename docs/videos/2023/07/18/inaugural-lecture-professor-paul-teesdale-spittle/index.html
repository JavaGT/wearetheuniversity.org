One of the most important aspects of this is the ability to store, use, and replicate information, such as the nucleic acid DNA that is passed down through generations. The central dogma, as envisaged by Francis Crick in 1957, noted that information can be passed from one nucleic acid to another (from DNA to RNA through a process called transcription), and from nucleic acid to protein (producing proteins from RNA in a process called translation). <br><br>In this lecture Professor Teesdale-Spittle takes a brief tour through the processes of transcription and translation, but specifically an unexpected mechanism that controls the very earliest phase of protein production in translation. We will see how a natural product found in New Zealand sponges can change the way translation is controlled and how in future this could lead to useful therapeutics.</p><h2>Transcript</h2><p

Teasdale<br>spittle my name is Nick Smith and I'm<br>the vice Chancellor and it's my huge<br>pleasure to be able to introduce Paul<br>in these sort of moments I get a list of<br>all the<br>incredible achievements of our inaugural<br>professors and the things that they've<br>done and and Paul's list is is no<br>different from any of the others and<br>it's impressive that it's long and I<br>will inflict quite a bit of it on you<br>shortly<br>but before I get to that point I wanted<br>to make some some personal comments<br>about Paul<br>I've just learned that Paul grew up in<br>Birmingham I already knew that he moved<br>Slightly North into his PhD in<br>Nottingham<br>but he has neither a Birmingham accent<br>or a Nottingham accent I think for all<br>our benefits he has this beautiful sort<br>and I think that's significant because I<br>asked him<br>um why uh he he came to artera and how<br>he came to to heading a walker he said<br>well I looked at the job and it sounded<br>kind of interesting<br>and then I thought it'd be an<br>interesting place to go and visit and<br>the interview would be fun<br>he was then I think significantly<br>disappointed to find out that the<br>interview was by phone<br>and it was the last interview that we<br>probably did by phone ever at that point<br>in time but I'd like to think that his<br>beautiful way of expressing things in<br>his BBC accent were important because<br>they have provided us with a very valued<br>colleague someone who's done amazing<br>things in this University<br>and someone who we're very proud to have<br>here I know in my first weeks as Vice<br>Chancellor at the beginning of this year<br>I assembled a committee and and Paul was<br>one of those people who would turn up<br>would simultaneously be reasonable and<br>forthright which simultaneously be<br>thoughtful and radical could speak truth<br>to power in ways that were incredibly<br>valued were doing and I have thought<br>since that there was no University group<br>or subject where Paul is not an enormous<br>asset<br>so following his academic his PhD at<br>Nottingham he then moved briefly to De<br>Montford University before as I've said<br>to making his way here into the school<br>of biological sciences and Victoria<br>University of Wellington he has ascended<br>through the academic ranks as first as a<br>senior lecturer and then associate<br>professor and now as a member of the<br>professoriat<br>he is quintessentially an<br>interdisciplinary researcher someone who<br>is sort of spanned across organic<br>chemistry biochemistry Medicinal<br>Chemistry pharmacology and oncology and<br>I think if you look at his research work<br>and I think what we're about to hear<br>tonight I think does Justice to that<br>renaissance man that he is able to<br>combine orienteering and in outside his<br>day job with Medicinal Chemistry with<br>what she what he does Within These Walls<br>he's an internationally recognized<br>expert he's been cited an enormous<br>number of times he's secured over four<br>million dollars of external funding and<br>has won many research Awards including<br>the Heidi prestigious prime minister<br>science award<br>he's also known for his active external<br>engagement engagement<br>he's a subject specialist uh reviewing<br>for major conferences and he's also<br>helped maintain important relationships<br>with the maligan uh Institute of Medical<br>Research and the Medical Research<br>Institute of New Zealand<br>he's made meaningful contributions in<br>the leadership space of the University<br>as an associate Dean academic<br>in the faculty of Science and has also<br>been involved in a whole range of<br>teaching and learning projects he's one<br>of the founding meaners members of<br>Athena and is the director of Center for<br>biodiscovery from 2 2015 to 2018.<br>what we're about to hear Paul talk about<br>I think will be fantastic<br>he'll take a brief trip through complex<br>biological processes of transcription<br>and translation he's going to look at<br>some of the really unexpected mechanisms<br>that control some of the earliest phases<br>of protein production which is essential<br>for all our lives and then we're going<br>to see in that interdisciplinary Spirit<br>how a natural product found in New<br>Zealand sponges can change the way that<br>translocation is controlled and how that<br>could lead to really future uses and a<br>whole range of innovative Therapeutics<br>it's my enormous pleasure to welcome<br>thank you Nick so uh Vice Chancellor on<br>a guests friends family colleagues<br>all others it's a real pleasure to be<br>here tonight and to see you here tonight<br>as well so thank you for that I'm going<br>to just slightly correct Nick's um next<br>introduction there sorry Nick<br>um I commented as we um as we were<br>sitting outside one of the wonderful<br>things about the the exhortations that<br>are given on these occasions are things<br>you you learn about yourself that you<br>never thought<br>um at one of those is is the prime<br>minister science prize so you're not<br>hearing from a New Zealand prime<br>minister's science Prize winner to night<br>time it's just me<br>so it's a great pleasure to be here and<br>um<br>I'm really delighted that at least one<br>of you came and especially delighted<br>that you all did my title tonight<br>bringing molecules to life was after<br>several seconds of deep thought about<br>the nature of where I sit in the<br>academic environment<br>and I ended up with a sort of a subtext<br>that I wanted to bring in about the<br>power and the value of curiosity and<br>holding on to that Curiosity as you go<br>through life as you go through Academia<br>and why I think we should instill it and<br>nurture it in our students so I'm going<br>to start there it's a little odd hobby<br>horse and then I'm going to move on but<br>hopefully you'll see that Curiosity<br>aspect has driven the the research story<br>that I'm going to take you through as we<br>go so um I did consider trying to find<br>pictures of my own children at a younger<br>age but those of you who've had younger<br>children or can remember being one of<br>those younger children will remember<br>being surrounded by questions the what<br>the why the how the when<br>they are we there yet and so on all of<br>those questions that deep search for<br>meaning and ideas and exploration of the<br>world<br>and that is a tremendous moment of<br>growth you see that in our youngsters<br>and then what happens when they come<br>here we do an awful lot of learn this<br>does this thing remember this this<br>statistic will be important to you<br>here's a piece of knowledge<br>um here's a feature we do things that<br>feel to me like occasionally we suppress<br>that inquisitive nature and I I just<br>pulled this up I something I was doing<br>in my uh part of my role was looking at<br>approving course outlines yay<br>um uh fellow associate Deans will know<br>some of the the joys of doing this and I<br>spotted one point I thought that's quite<br>a lot of Assessments and so I just<br>pulled up one student from one of our<br>programs who it turned out this student<br>was taking a course in three different<br>four different courses from three<br>faculties and this is the 52 items of<br>assessment that they're going to have<br>next semester<br>so this student is going to have<br>probably a hundred or more assessments<br>this year<br>and I wonder if they have time to ask<br>the questions<br>so I'll leave you with that thought and<br>I move on<br>to to try and<br>start you thinking about what makes me<br>curious so what makes you curious here<br>um you might just for a moment look at<br>somebody you can see around you and say<br>hmm I wonder about<br>girlfriend<br>and as you think and talk about this you<br>might have some some surface questions<br>like those aren't buses or how do you<br>park a bus on that slope but you then<br>might start thinking some deeper<br>questions as well the more you think of<br>just this image the more you might begin<br>to see in it and it's a launching point<br>for me for curiosity you might be<br>thinking about like what's the social<br>interactions between those sheep<br>um why there are rules and people are<br>not cheap I'm not following rules what's<br>going on here<br>um what are the colors why is the glass<br>green why is the paint blue what are the<br>materials what can we do what's what's<br>that wool good for what's the physiology<br>there's an energy flow here the sun is<br>shining on the grass the grass is<br>absorbing that energy that is being<br>transferred into the Sheep the Sheep<br>does some transfer of energy back to the<br>grass there's a there's a whole<br>connection of so much here uh and there<br>are so many different things you might<br>have drawn out your own curiosity from<br>for me one of the things that excites me<br>is understanding how stuff happens and<br>because of the nature of where I've come<br>from academically I have to understand<br>from a molecule-based upwards so<br>thinking about how the stuff we observe<br>around us the processes that drive us<br>can be emergent from the properties of<br>the molecules that make up living<br>systems so that is the bringing<br>molecules to life and that's the<br>Curiosity that I'm going to bring to<br>the next bits of my talk<br>before I go into my own research though<br>I wanted to just give a little case<br>study that we might all recognize some<br>part of to think about how molecules<br>interact in living systems and how there<br>is real importance in that interaction<br>being selective<br>in processes so I'm going to take you<br>through this there will be no test at<br>the end of this on your knowledge of the<br>Cascade relating to coagulation but what<br>you might do oh let me get to the um<br>laser pointer up<br>you see down at the bottom here blood<br>clot so this is why we haven't all bled<br>to death yet<br>um<br>and<br>at the base of this the clotting of<br>blood above that we have a protein<br>called fibrin that helps form some of<br>the the clot and that forms because it<br>gets chopped up by another protein so<br>this protein fibrinogen gets chopped up<br>makes Vibram and the protein that does<br>that chopping up is called thrombin okay<br>so you don't need to remember all of<br>this what I want you to think about<br>though is that I've told you about A<br>protein that chops up proteins<br>and if you know about proteins you'll<br>think about all of your muscles you'll<br>think about the workhorses of of our<br>biology the things that make stuff<br>happen in living systems and yet I've<br>got a protein here that chops up<br>proteins which if it was uncontrolled<br>and unselective would turn us into a bag<br>of amino acids<br>that would not be good<br>so<br>there has to be selectivity so how is it<br>that we can get blood clotting and not<br>just turning into a soup of amino acids<br>and I'm going to try and take you<br>through this from my view of how<br>molecules work<br>good luck<br>right what I've shown here up on the the<br>screen here is a surface of this protein<br>thrombin and it's color coded so the<br>color coding tells you about charge on<br>the surface blue bits are positively<br>charged red bits are negatively charged<br>and you'll also see in addition to<br>charge features it's got shape it's got<br>structure it's got cavities and<br>protrusions and these combinations of<br>cavities and protrusions and surface<br>properties give a particular point of<br>the protein<br>features that allow it to select what<br>other proteins it chops up so there's an<br>example here one of the the substrates<br>that trombring cuts in that previous<br>slide yeah<br>shown just as a molecular skeleton<br>and if we<br>um Dig Down Deeper look him closer zoom<br>in on the active site the place where<br>the cleaving up of this substrate occurs<br>you begin to see the surface features of<br>the Protein that's the red white blue<br>surface and how it matches lumps and<br>bumps that you can infer from the<br>skeleton I've shown you of this of the<br>substrate so there's points where<br>there's a cavity and there's another the<br>substrate has to have something that<br>fills that cavity and that's what gives<br>it selectivity all the way across this<br>long interface things have to be matched<br>the features of the substrate have to<br>match the features of the protein so if<br>there's a cavity in the protein the<br>substrate must put something in it if<br>there's a protrusion in the protein then<br>the substrate mustn't have something<br>there and that then governs which<br>proteins get bound and chopped up and<br>which don't<br>and I'll take you through one example of<br>this which is right at the very point<br>where all the clever chemistry of the<br>enzyme happens where it chops up its<br>substrate there is an interaction from<br>the substrate which is shown in white<br>um the the thrombin shown here in yellow<br>the sort of molecular detail of amino<br>acids of the protein and the the<br>substrate has this long amino acid with<br>a sort of finger-like protrusion that<br>sticks in to a cavity we'll see at a<br>moment in a moment and has a positive<br>charge at the end<br>so this amino acid arginine in the<br>substrate is the only amino acid that is<br>long and protruding and has a positive<br>charge at the end uh<br>it's not quite the only one it's the<br>best one for this and it meets up with<br>an amino acid that's negatively charged<br>from the protein so it's got this lovely<br>match of charge and positioning and we<br>can even dig into the surface I've shown<br>the surface we saw earlier and I've just<br>chopped away the front of it so we can<br>look in to the pocket and you can see in<br>this pocket it's just like the perfect<br>size the perfect fit so this this finger<br>of the Arginine amino acid is just<br>protruding down into that pocket filling<br>it and making that ideal perfect plus<br>minus interaction at the bottom and<br>that's just one of the many interactions<br>that's happening right across the<br>surface of this protein so why have we<br>not bled to death or turned into a bag<br>of amino acids because this protein<br>thrombin Cleaves up particular<br>substrates it picks out from all of the<br>25 to 100 000 variants of proteins that<br>make us up it picks out just a few to<br>chop because they have to have exactly<br>these features nothing else all right so<br>what we've just seen then is we can<br>begin to understand biological processes<br>big and important biological processes<br>from the molecular level upwards we can<br>think about the charge the shape the<br>features the interactions and how<br>complementarity of one thing to another<br>ensures that selectively one molecule<br>binds to another building up an assembly<br>that is functional<br>and so we begin to go from molecule to<br>biological process and that's what's<br>been my curiosity if you like all right<br>I'm going to take an aside because I<br>think you only want me to say molecule<br>electrostatic interaction hydrogen bond<br>and so on so many times<br>um in the talk so I thought I would just<br>break for a moment as an aside how did I<br>get here and I don't mean I walked in it<br>made sure I came in the right direction<br>Dave escorted me behind so I didn't run<br>away I'm meaning academically so um uh<br>you've seen a picture of me when I was<br>quite young this is me as a as a<br>teenager at school<br>um blessedly few photographs of me as a<br>child they uh their beauty of growing up<br>before that digital camera era I'm sure<br>I'm not alone in thinking<br>my parents really only could take a few<br>photographs at a time<br>um right so I made a few decisions as I<br>went along as going through school there<br>was only one subject I ever actively<br>chose not to do and that is biology at<br>the age of 14 where the first set of<br>choices I had before me Latin yes<br>biology no way<br>no way so<br>um don't do biology the next thing going<br>a year or two up and choosing what to do<br>at University I had two goals I set<br>myself in mind the first was my<br>grandfather did chemistry my father did<br>chemistry I'm going to be different<br>and the second was don't end up living<br>in Birmingham or London don't go in the<br>big city find somewhere else<br>okay well I've I'm very very<br>successfully not ended up living in<br>Birmingham or London<br>um but what I do now might be described<br>as molecular pharmacology that is<br>thinking about the molecular basis of<br>therapeutic agents what what they do how<br>they work how things interact as I've<br>just shown you how the cellular<br>consequences of those interactions play<br>out for therapeutic benefit so what I'm<br>saying is that chemistry I wasn't going<br>to do well I did do it at University and<br>that biology I decided was an awful<br>subject and I should give up that's<br>where I found my home<br>so um<br>right<br>so that brings me to the point where I<br>want to say something a little bit about<br>the research that I've been doing over<br>the years I've been absolutely blessed<br>to work with a whole number of excellent<br>people and be able to dabble in a range<br>of projects across a few disciplines<br>and I decided to tell you today about<br>just one of these which is the story<br>relating to a New Zealand natural<br>product called potato mean is found in<br>uh one of our native sponges at the Mike<br>Haley sponge and it's not found in every<br>sponge that you can find that is a my<br>Katie sponge which suggests that it's<br>actually produced by something else and<br>it's a bacterial bacteria that produces<br>it<br>but what I want to do on this slide<br>though is to recognize some people so<br>anything I tell you today has the work<br>of other people<br>rather than my own and pictures of<br>colleagues so Peter Northcote and Rob<br>Kaisers who are aficionados of natural<br>products<br>um Joanne Harvey who has been an<br>incredible collaborator for decades hmm<br>yeah and there's a absolute Guru of all<br>things synthetic organic chemistry<br>um so John Miller who<br>um was one of the first people I met as<br>I arrived here who dragged me into this<br>world of thinking about how natural<br>products work and<br>um determining mode of action Bill<br>Jordan Lee from pong who got me into<br>thinking and understanding the world of<br>proteomics and the way that the cellular<br>consequences of um of treatments with<br>things like bioactive compounds can be<br>interpreted Melanie um who if she is<br>here she's apparently sneezing I can't<br>hear sneezing so that probably means<br>she's still at home has brought me into<br>the world clearblastoma Gary who who<br>worked with us on this project with<br>synthetic organic chemistry Gary Evans<br>an animal of lamb who is one of the<br>least scary immunologists there are<br>there are a few<br>right and then really those were the<br>colleagues who have supported me through<br>the years but there are people as well<br>who actually did the work and I see<br>Veronica in the room here<br>um but there are many many others as<br>well so to them for anything I get wrong<br>now that's my fault<br>um and also to them in case they're<br>watching online and Veronica in the room<br>here I'm going to take your blood your<br>sweat to your tears and then just make<br>it sound quite small<br>um it's not anybody who's done a PhD<br>will know the Blood Sweat and Tears that<br>go into a a one sentence statement<br>all right and along the way we've been<br>funded and particularly in this area<br>funded by worldwide cancer research<br>Genesis oncology trust and the<br>university is supporting people through<br>scholarships so with grateful thanks for<br>that support<br>okay so a molecule you knew it was going<br>to come back so this is Peter mean<br>um it's this is its structure for those<br>of you who are more chemistry based<br>you'll see a macro dialide with a<br>thiazole and an extended polyunsaturated<br>alkenic side chain with a tertiary<br>aiming at the end for everybody else<br>it's a glorious little bit of structure<br>um it's Unique there aren't other<br>natural products that look much like<br>this<br>um it's a an interesting Challenge and<br>um<br>and it does things amongst the things it<br>does is kill sales so let me explain the<br>chart I've got here so this chart here<br>is showing you cell survival and as we<br>move from left to right we're increasing<br>the amount of Patia mean in the<br>treatment and cells go yeah yeah yeah<br>yeah yeah oh ah oh<br>and then they don't say anything you get<br>to a a concentration and all the cells<br>in your flask that you treated have died<br>and the concentrations where this is<br>happening are in a Range called the<br>nanomola range which means there's<br>virtually nothing there this is an<br>incredibly potent<br>toxic compound in a marine sponge and<br>I said that there was sort of curiosity<br>elements throughout my talk this is one<br>of these so Peter Northcutt who was uh<br>who discovered<br>back in the days when he was in<br>Canterbury<br>um he was struck by the fact that we<br>have Organisms that cannot move you know<br>the sponges can't fight off<br>um or run away from predators so they<br>must defend themselves in other ways and<br>his view was maybe there's a chemical<br>defense<br>and I wonder what that is<br>and when Peter went looking for what<br>that chemical defense might be one of<br>the compounds he found was patimi and<br>that sort of stuck around as being it's<br>a toxic compound for a while<br>we got a bit interested in it because we<br>realized that there was more going on<br>than just it kills things<br>um I'll just go back to that we really<br>wanted to think about what this was good<br>for this was something unique to New<br>Zealand it's a natural product that our<br>one of our sponges make that is not made<br>anywhere else or rather one of the<br>bacteria in our sponges make that is not<br>made anywhere else and I wonder if it is<br>good for something that's a little nod<br>towards this um<br>um some of you will know is his sort of<br>Catchphrase what's it good for<br>um when you look at that killing of<br>cells that I told you I've got some<br>numbers here low numbers mean really<br>really really potent to killing those<br>cells<br>and then you'll see there are two<br>numbers in red which are not low numbers<br>these are cells that don't apparently<br>mind if you treat them with pitiamine<br>and I've used the word quiescent<br>these are cells that are not going<br>through division<br>so we've got some cells which is going<br>through division regularly and if<br>they're going through a division they<br>really really really<br>do not respond well to pertaining the<br>time<br>but if they're not going through a<br>division<br>then they just keep surviving<br>what's going on there so there's a<br>question<br>but uh it does begin to answer the maybe<br>what is this good for because where is<br>an interesting therapeutic situation<br>where uncontrolled division of cells is<br>a bad thing and being able to kill cells<br>that are going through uncontrolled<br>division would be a good thing it's<br>cancer<br>so you have immediately here the<br>potential that we've got a window into<br>cancer because those uncontrolled<br>division that that is associated with<br>the development of tumors for instance<br>is going to be targeted by this compound<br>so<br>we have a beginning of a what is this<br>good for<br>but there were all sorts of other<br>questions that we might have had at the<br>time like why does it do that what's the<br>ecological benefit<br>how does it do that what's causing that<br>to happen along the side why if I got<br>this thing that's really really toxic<br>does the thing that produce it not die<br>I'm not going to answer that one tonight<br>I'm just going to leave you worrying<br>about it and then always the what is<br>this good for there's no point in in not<br>thinking about whether we got benefits<br>in what we do<br>to get to that we decided this was the<br>most important place to start how is it<br>doing it because if we understood how we<br>might be able to think about why and<br>what and some of those other questions<br>so the how question here was most<br>important for us<br>and so we did this hmm we made a mess on<br>a slide what this is describing is is a<br>process so we started by taking some<br>sales and just some normal culturable<br>cells that we this is the thing we do so<br>we grow up cells and then we burst them<br>apart got the protein contents out of<br>them and we went fishing I see Paul at<br>the back as a fisherman uh we went<br>fishing on the molecular level for uh<br>for proteins that bound to<br>um to our partium and when we did that<br>we went through a series of processes we<br>use Mass spectrometry to identify those<br>processes we double checked that the<br>proteins that we found related to the<br>activity we were seeing and so we've got<br>an answer and James Matthews who is<br>doing the work at that point I remember<br>quite well that moment he came down<br>having finished this<br>collection of complex experiments and he<br>said we've got a Target it's eif4a to<br>which I said the only thing I could<br>imagine saying at that point great what<br>is it<br>um as it happens neither James nor I<br>knew anything about eif 4A I'm imagining<br>relatively few of you here do as well so<br>I'm going to tell you haha this is the<br>the problem you have you see you've come<br>you're now a captive audience and only<br>Richards told me that he's going to go<br>and run away part way through right okay<br>so to get there I'm going to introduce<br>the central dogma which sounds like it's<br>some sort of religious thing<br>um the central dogma as I'm going to<br>tell you today<br>um<br>came about around the late 50s<br>associated with Francis Crick and<br>they were Crick was thinking about the<br>passage of information<br>and his idea was or their idea was<br>really information passes from nucleic<br>acid to nucleic acid so nucleic acids<br>are things like DNA which we think of as<br>like the blueprint of the cell and it's<br>got a a a friend that we'll look at in a<br>moment called RNA so information can<br>pass from DNA to RNA and information can<br>pass from nucleic acid to protein so<br>from RNA to Pro to proteins and we've<br>got names that we're going to give to<br>these two processes one the first one is<br>the writing across of sequence<br>information so writing across or<br>transcription of sequence information<br>from DNA to RNA and the next is the<br>translation of the nucleic acid code to<br>the protein code<br>so that's translation and crick's<br>definition here of information was<br>specifically about the sequence of<br>subunits so it's how one thing drives<br>the sequence of the next<br>so visually then<br>we have cells<br>yeah I told you Richard would run away<br>um I thought you'd wait till I really<br>offended him but right um in our in our<br>cells we uh there is a nucleus which is<br>packed tight with DNA amongst other<br>things uh huge lengths of DNA packed up<br>really knotted up tightly this DNA has<br>that blueprints that we hear people<br>describe the blueprint of light it's got<br>this lovely double helical type<br>structure it creates actually far more<br>complex structures than this but this<br>will work for us now but because of its<br>length you can't just take a bit of it<br>out and use it this blueprint is locked<br>up in the nucleus and you have to copy<br>bits out when you want them to be used<br>so that's this process of transcription<br>writing across into a shorter length of<br>nucleic acid and<br>that bit of nucleic acid this RNA<br>carries a message which can be taken out<br>into the rest of the cell and translated<br>and turned into proteins so it's called<br>messenger RNA mRNA<br>and that provides a sequence of these<br>protrusions you can see here which you<br>might notice not very similar to these<br>in the middle of the double helix of DNA<br>this is the sequence of the bases of a<br>nucleic acid which have slightly<br>different structures from each other<br>they are a code we often give them four<br>letters I'm going to show you some of<br>those in a bit the sequence of these<br>letters of these bases defines<br>the information content of this bit of<br>RNA and every three of those gives a<br>specific message that says translate<br>this into one particular amino acid like<br>that Arginine I showed you earlier in<br>thrombin so one particular bit of that<br>code will say put this Arginine in this<br>place in in from them okay<br>so I need to now tell you a bit about<br>RNA these are so many things you didn't<br>know you didn't want to know about<br>right so RNA is a bit different to that<br>beautiful double helix that you won't<br>think about for DNA so it's often<br>thought about as less likely to form<br>double helical structures it might be<br>single stranded it's relatively short<br>compared to the sort of meters length of<br>bits of DNA<br>it does have double helical bits so it<br>gets pairings up but it has regions that<br>are not as well so it has these<br>interesting complex structures and loops<br>and Knots and all sorts of things in it<br>it also has some sequence bits that are<br>really important to know about so uh it<br>has to say here begineth my message<br>um the in this case I've shown you a<br>code on a group of three bases Aug that<br>say starts here this is where the bit<br>that's going to make a protein<br>begins and then it carries on through<br>the chain with the sequence that will<br>code for the uh for the protein and then<br>at some point it has to take a one stop<br>don't just keep going stop here so it<br>has a stark codon and a stock codon and<br>it gets bits either end and in the<br>middle then between the start and the<br>start is stop is called the coding<br>region and this is the bit that governs<br>what specific protein is made<br>right so that feels like it's really<br>really important<br>and that's the bit I want you to ignore<br>I want you to look at this bit<br>particularly the thing that I'm going to<br>call the five Prime utr so before the<br>start<br>is some sort of sequence I've shown it<br>with a little Loop here but it could be<br>any structure any length some sort of<br>sequence which is not translated so it's<br>in the untranslated region so that's<br>what u t r stands for if I drop into<br>saying Phi Prime utr and the Fly Prime<br>just denotes which end<br>don't worry about why Richard will tell<br>you afterwards about the um the<br>numbering of sugars and why that ended<br>up being a five Prime anyway it's a a<br>bit that isn't part of the sequence but<br>is really fundamentally important in how<br>the transcript this bit of RNA is<br>managed<br>and we're finally getting to me being<br>able to get you to understand the<br>wonderful world of eif 4A so I'm going<br>to call it 4A because that's shorter<br>um<br>in that five Prime untranslated region<br>there might be knots and loops and<br>features that make it really hard for<br>the molecular assembly that makes<br>proteins to come in and clip onto that<br>transcript to this bit of RNA and then<br>start churning rounding and making the<br>protein<br>so if it's if this 5 Prime utr is full<br>of structure and Knots and complexity<br>then that transcript can't be used<br>and what 4A does is it melts away those<br>bits of structure so it dissolves them<br>away so you get a sort of like a nice<br>flat Landing Pad so that the molecular<br>assembly which is called a ribosome can<br>sort of assemble around the start codon<br>and start using this transcript to make<br>proteins<br>brilliant you now know everything you<br>need to know about eif4a and RNA and my<br>job is done but I'm going to talk anyway<br>so what happens then with patient<br>sort of inhibits it's actually a it's<br>sort of over activates but we're going<br>to pretend it inhibits eif 4A<br>and the reason that's important is that<br>these transcripts that have long and<br>really structured and knotty five Prime<br>untranslated regions have that for an<br>evolutionary reason<br>why after all would you try why would<br>nature end up creating a complexity that<br>needs to be resolved in order to make a<br>protein that a cell needs to be made<br>that doesn't make great evolutionary<br>sense unless we can think of some other<br>reason and the reason is that not every<br>protein needs to be made at the same<br>rate<br>there's all sorts of stuff in control<br>that controls what proteins get get made<br>but one of the last steps is this<br>initiation step and proteins where the<br>cell absolutely needs to have as many<br>breaks as possible on their unregulated<br>production<br>have these complex long structured<br>naughty five Prime utrs that really<br>really depend on the Assembly of<br>proteins that includes the i4a and these<br>include cancer promoting genes<br>so these are genes that you would not<br>normally want turned on if you want to<br>talk about why we have genes like this<br>Peter in the front row over there we'll<br>probably tell you about their importance<br>in developmental biology there's just<br>some friends of yours I suspect<br>somewhere in here Peter yeah so<br>um so the cell has these mechanisms for<br>controlling these cancer-promoting genes<br>one of these is the naughtiness of its<br>uh five Prime utr eif4a is really<br>important in in<br>untangling that knot in us so they can<br>be made when they are needed<br>okay which means that if we inhibit them<br>what is the process that we most inhibit<br>it's going to be the inhibition of<br>things that turn on and promote cancer<br>Ah that's good<br>so that helps us explain this so two<br>things are going on the first then is<br>that we can turn off cancer promoting<br>genes which means that some of the<br>survival benefits that cancer cell lines<br>might have inherent in them are suddenly<br>turned off so they become more sensitive<br>to to the patio mean and another thing<br>is that cells that are going through<br>division need proteins all the time<br>what's the next step of the cell<br>division oh I need proteins to do that<br>what's my next thing I need a protein to<br>do that so they're really respondent to<br>dropping off protein synthesis<br>so we've got a really exciting Target<br>for cancer we have a unique New Zealand<br>natural product that hits this target<br>and we're in a good place so 2005 it was<br>that we've uh James walked in and said<br>we found an eif for a I wonder what it<br>is<br>by about 2014 then<br>the global search for uses of that piece<br>of information<br>um drove more and more work less than<br>others on understanding that led us to<br>the this point of it's the sequence of<br>the bit of the transcript that's not<br>translated that's really important here<br>it's like the bit you don't normally<br>think about is the important bit<br>um and then 2019 a company in the US<br>called effective Therapeutics uh I've<br>been working with uh that as part of<br>this community of people working in the<br>eiff 4A inhibition World<br>um<br>driven by us back then and they've got<br>their their first compound zotovan here<br>Dr Tiffin sorry in uh clinical trials<br>it's exciting moment they promised that<br>they will have their trials wrapped up<br>the first couple of stages of Trials<br>wrapped up by September this year so we<br>hope well for them particularly those of<br>us who<br>um don't want eiffore to fall over as a<br>drug Target so we're hoping but so far<br>what they say of their own trials is<br>promising<br>we'll have to see what the real data<br>shows of course right so job done<br>we found a Target that's actually a<br>really exciting place to be it's not<br>often you get to find a new therapeutic<br>Target which has had a couple<br>um but uh sorry not the Richard who run<br>away<br>um who's still here yeah um we found a<br>cancer-specific benefit we've it's been<br>exploited we we have a problem is is has<br>a natural product we can get the odd a<br>milligram of it if we work really hard<br>that's not enough to treat<br>a person<br>or certainly not enough to treat many<br>people and it's not enough to do<br>pre-clinical trials clinical trials and<br>so on so is there anything yesterday<br>left to do yes<br>so in my remaining oh 10 minutes<br>let me tell you some of the where we're<br>going with this so the first one I<br>mentioned glioblastoma<br>um some of Veronica is in the third row<br>back here some of her work uh from a<br>year or so ago uh clearblastoma is an<br>awful awful cancer many of you may be<br>aware of it it's it's a killer<br>um it's<br>that the lifetime it once you've got<br>diagnosis is is<br>months<br>it's it's not long it may last out for<br>years but it's generally not<br>it's one of the trickiest treatments to<br>cancers to treat and when you treat it<br>it comes back and it comes back worse<br>usually<br>so we thought well we've got this really<br>exciting compound I wonder if it works<br>there I'm showing you again the<br>self-survival curves you can see it<br>looked like before you push up the<br>amount of potiamine cells fall over so<br>we can kill cell models at least<br>biblioblastoma that's a bit exciting<br>um and um the work Veronica spent um<br>spent a year on was was looking at what<br>are the cellular processes associated<br>with this<br>um<br>and we can we can pick particular parts<br>of the the cellular response to patio<br>mean and we can think about how that<br>interacts with the nature of the biology<br>of of glioblastoma but I'm not going to<br>do that for you now<br>because it's too much detail perhaps<br>but there are some things there are<br>places where all of that takes us so the<br>first is if we had enough<br>of the compound<br>just across the blood-brain barrier I<br>might just wasting my time thinking<br>about glute blastoma does it get across<br>the blood-brain barrier does it survive<br>a metabolic processes<br>um and what about a more realistic model<br>of glioblastoma you can kill cells but<br>it's not the same as treating the<br>disease so so there's definitely things<br>to be done there but there's enough to<br>make it exciting to ask some of the more<br>questions<br>the next one<br>um arose from a combination of ah<br>thinking about the nature of the<br>five Prime untranslated reason and also<br>from some examples in the literature<br>so for example<br>viruses use our protein making Machinery<br>to replicate they don't come with<br>protein making Machinery they get into a<br>cell and go please make this protein for<br>me well they don't please<br>it's more of a demand and we're<br>interacting with uh with this protein<br>making Machinery so it made sense uh for<br>somebody to get on and look at viral<br>impasse it turned out to be um<br>from some collaborators or some other<br>other people but pertaining impacts on<br>influenza and a whole range of other<br>viruses so there's something happening<br>there that's really important because in<br>the cell model that they're using here<br>that I'm showing colored spots off that<br>I'm not going to explain<br>the cells survive the virus is not<br>replicating so we are having an effect<br>below toxicity so we can do something<br>that's not killing things that's nice<br>and another thing you can do that's not<br>killing things is is relates to cachexia<br>so cachexia is muscle wasting and you<br>might think of conditions you might know<br>people who lose total muscle tone they<br>become thin or skeletal this is not to<br>do with the diet but is to do with the<br>condition that they are experiencing and<br>it's not well treated<br>and patermine at least in the mouse<br>model<br>prevents it so that's that's a<br>remarkably powerful thing and<br>particularly powerful is that the mouse<br>mice are healthy and happy and not<br>experiencing toxicity and the dosage is<br>really really low so we wanted to take<br>these two things and ask the how's that<br>happening sort of question because<br>how are we getting effects that are<br>beneficial without turning off all<br>protein synthesis and then killing the<br>organism<br>that would be bad antiviral that kills<br>virus ideal kills you not ideal<br>right so<br>we went back to thinking about the<br>structures of five Prime utrs some<br>simple<br>transcripts have very little structure<br>it doesn't really matter what you do<br>treating with pitiamine as long as you<br>don't put too much in then their<br>proteins get made and they get made and<br>they get made you need to have a really<br>high concentration to stop their<br>production and then when you do that the<br>cell dies<br>good<br>then you have some cells where some<br>transcripts which have these structure<br>loops and turns and Knots they're really<br>sensitive to disruption so if you begin<br>to lower the available functional amount<br>of this eifra protein then they can't be<br>made they can't be translated and so<br>their proteins drop out and that might<br>be some of what's happening with the<br>anti-cancer the antiviral world<br>but we were getting really effective<br>really low concentrations and we began<br>to think that partiramine and eif4a<br>picked out certain features<br>in this untranslated region and locked<br>on the 4A protein to a feature of the<br>untranslated region and that particular<br>transcript<br>is just couldn't be processed<br>and that could happen at really really<br>low concentrations so really low<br>concentration so Richard little who<br>spent years doing vastly more than I'm<br>showing here was able to show that<br>concentrations that don't affect the<br>cell survival in any way shape or form<br>that around four percent of the proteins<br>in the cells drop in abundance and we<br>think there's some feature of their<br>untranslated region which makes them<br>particularly prone to having foreign<br>lock onto it and then they are not<br>processed so they just disappear they<br>drop into a thing called a stress<br>granule and some proteins by the way go<br>up<br>um<br>that might be to do with the fact that<br>you've now got ribosomes going well my<br>transcript's gone what shall I do oh<br>I'll make more of that other protein<br>anyway not to worry about that what we<br>wanted to do was identify what the<br>feature of the<br>um the pi Prime utr was<br>Richard looked at a whole range of<br>structural predictions and a number of<br>other things that we could uh work on<br>and we came down to this information<br>um a cricks sequence information there<br>are sequence motifs which every<br>transcript that drop down and abundance<br>have and you see letters g and a quite<br>big here so these are the sequence<br>letters for guanine and adenine in the<br>the RNA code and if you get this long<br>stretch of these purine guanine adenine<br>bases in the RNA it's it's like a magnet<br>for the eif4a and it sits in that<br>sequence gets locked in place with<br>patermine and the the transcripts that<br>have this feature then drop out and that<br>is probably what's giving us some of<br>these<br>sub toxic effects which is great being<br>able to treat a disease without being<br>toxic is<br>very very useful so we've moved away<br>from cancer and we're starting to think<br>about other uses<br>um and we now know in the molecular<br>level how this is happening so we've got<br>a crystal structure of of eif 4A this is<br>color-coded the red for negative blue<br>for positive like I showed you earlier<br>but this is our eif4a protein just a bit<br>of its surface in gold is the RNA and<br>then the white skeleton is our pitiamine<br>and you can see how they sit snuggled<br>together making this combination of<br>things that that interlock<br>where they're held in position they<br>can't separate out and that bit of RNA<br>cannot be processed<br>and the selectivity that I've just<br>talked about from the sequence<br>selectivity is driven by all of those<br>interactions so how is the RNA<br>interacting with the protein how is the<br>RNA interacting with arpitiamine and how<br>is our partium interacting with the<br>protein these interfaces are really<br>where all of that selectivity and all of<br>the potential therapeutic uses is hidden<br>it's locked in that locked in that<br>interface Realm<br>so we wanted to think about how we work<br>on that interface and that we can't<br>change the structure of eif4a so that<br>can't be done we can't change the<br>structure of our transcripts well<br>there's many of them but we so they<br>provide a variety of features but we can<br>change the teaming so we thought we'd<br>have a look at that<br>and so we thought about the interfaces<br>the interfaces occur particularly across<br>this region which is down through here<br>across this region this long extended<br>region which is through here and our our<br>thighs older sulfur nitrogen containing<br>ring here<br>points into the the surface of the<br>protein and so we saw these as points<br>where we could tweak the molecule and<br>then tweak the interface tweak the<br>interactions and maybe change the the<br>selectivity and also along the way we<br>hope to make it a bit easier to make<br>Joanne<br>yeah so we had this great idea and we<br>actually did make something that was<br>quite easy to make we thought we would<br>take some pretty standard chemistry<br>steps try and simplify the molecule down<br>pick up some simple precursors these are<br>honestly relatively simple precursors we<br>can even just buy this bit which makes a<br>whole chunk of the molecule you just go<br>to the chemical supplier and say give me<br>some grams of that please so this is a<br>really quick way in and we decided to<br>use a reaction that makes a different<br>sort of ring it's still got five members<br>but this has got three nitrogens so this<br>triazole ring so this this reaction here<br>that is denoted qac copper assisted<br>azide alkyne cycle Edition is is a<br>become a a Workhorse in parts of the<br>chemistry biology interface it's been<br>known as an archetypal example of a<br>click reaction so it's that means it's<br>it's reliable it works every time you do<br>it in theory as long as you get<br>conditions right it's reproducible<br>um and it uh and it's applied in all<br>sorts of different contexts and we<br>thought great we can knock this together<br>with a click reaction we can buy this we<br>can make some other components which are<br>not too complex and we can put together<br>an analog of potiamine which we did it's<br>not very active it's about a thousand<br>fold less active than potato mean sadly<br>so we've overdone the simplification so<br>we decided to work on that think about<br>the things we had done that were a bit<br>different one was the this ring is<br>different so we wanted to go back to the<br>original nitrogen sulfur containing<br>Rings this thiazole here and and in a<br>dreadful miserviced to about three<br>people's Blood Sweat and Tears over a<br>combined weight yes<br>well perhaps so uh Tau<br>um uh Claire Sarah particularly working<br>on this this reaction we were trying to<br>recreate the benefit effects of the<br>click reaction using a gold Catalyst and<br>some oxidative gold catalyzed oxidative<br>coupling to get to the thiazole that we<br>wanted and we're able to get there we've<br>got this this beginning part we just got<br>to extend from a handle here now to<br>attach the the side shape the the<br>equivalent of this bit here and then<br>we'll have our next analog so that's<br>where we're up to synthetically the goal<br>being to get enough of this compound<br>that we can actually start looking more<br>realistically at therapeutic use and<br>also can we tune it for its selectivity<br>so what comes next here we need more<br>compound so we've got to make more<br>um<br>that will require the next Grant<br>application and and success in that next<br>Grant application we want to think about<br>whether we can tune the selectivity to<br>tune these things like the antiviral<br>activity<br>or the anticothetic activity<br>but one of the really interesting oh I<br>wonder where this will take us curiosity<br>moments is back through our central<br>dogma here DNA made into RNA the it's<br>not all DNA that's all simultaneously<br>copied there are messages that say make<br>this bit we need this bit to be copied<br>please use this bit<br>and the messages that help regulate<br>which bits are opened up and copied and<br>used and passed on for translation are<br>all driven by proteins<br>and what is it that we're affecting<br>we're affecting the production of<br>proteins<br>so<br>some of the proteins that we're<br>affecting the production of are The<br>so we've got this lovely regulate the<br>regulator thing going on which those of<br>you who are in criminology might know<br>more about than I do but we've got this<br>happening in the biological process<br>um<br>and in particular some of these really<br>powerful biological observations like<br>being anti-antiviral or particularly the<br>anticoclectic this turning off muscle<br>wasting<br>is feels like it's not some random<br>protein that we're impacting but like a<br>suite of coordinated proteins that are<br>involved in this condition<br>and are we regulating a protein<br>that changes the response of that whole<br>Suite of different proteins that are<br>associated with cachexia<br>and uh and so that is where we're going<br>now we've got evidence that we are<br>amongst the proteins here that we're<br>affecting at really low concentration of<br>things called transcription factors that<br>regulate this process of transcription<br>so that's where we're going now so<br>there's more questions more questions<br>and more questions and may there always<br>be more questions as long as they're not<br>are we there yet<br>all right so one of the things I<br>realized is I have a chance to do<br>something that you never have a chance<br>to do before in any academic talk and<br>that is along the way on any academic<br>Journal Journey there are people who<br>Mentor you and there are people who<br>inspire you there are people for whom<br>just the way they do things make you<br>think about what you're doing and quite<br>a few of you are here so thank you thank<br>you thank you<br>um<br>the people who influence the way you<br>were I approach the world this says some<br>of them but I've been surrounded by<br>great collaborators I've shown you a few<br>of them before in the patiamin story but<br>in other things I've done as well<br>there's been so many I've been lucky in<br>the colleagues that I've had in<br>biological sciences throughout through<br>Through Chemistry and throughout the<br>faculty of science who've<br>um as I said put up with me or maybe<br>enriched my time here over the years<br>it's been particularly particularly<br>valuable to me that what you have<br>contributed to my life<br>um talking of which<br>um I've got to mention family so Sarah<br>who back in 1987 probably had no idea<br>that she would be sitting here this many<br>years later so thank you Sarah uh for<br>for these two my son Simon and Allen<br>whose can-do attitude or at least can do<br>until broken attitude yes you do<br>um uh it is a continual inspiration<br>um I had no idea how they get so broken<br>um uh so the the those people who keep<br>me on the ground who deal with the fact<br>that I might turn up late and start<br>babbling nonsense thank you to you all<br>right and thank you to you for talking<br>for listening to me babbling nonsense to<br>you tonight it's been a pleasure to have<br>a captive audience thank you<br>thanks Paul you don't get to escape yet<br>nor does the audience<br>um<br>I'm Professor Dave Harper I'm the deputy<br>Pro Vice Chancellor of the faculties of<br>science health engineering architecture<br>and design Innovation and my role right<br>now is to and I'm delighted to do this<br>is to give the vote of thanks to Paul<br>for tonight's lecture<br>so to be promoted to professor doesn't<br>require just one thing you need to be an<br>excellent researcher you need to be an<br>excellent academic teacher<br>um and you need to show leadership in a<br>whole range of Engagement based ways and<br>so Paul as a leader in the faculty of<br>Science and the school of biological<br>sciences over the year you've shown<br>exemplary leadership particularly in<br>developing new programs and you've<br>helped keep the University at the<br>Forefront of innovative teaching and<br>learning NATO Roa uh tonight we got a<br>glimpse of your research and research<br>background<br>you've taught us one take-home message<br>which I<br>um I was about to say painfully was<br>reminded of the molecular biologist's<br>tendency to come up with the most<br>obscure names for things five Prime utr<br>EI f4a<br>um yes you reminded me of that<br>these are complex things things like<br>transcription translation to cellular<br>processes that Paul led us through in<br>terms of understanding<br>the take home messages at least my ones<br>were not necessarily the Obscure names<br>around these things but that<br>they help develop useful therapies<br>whether it's muscle wasting cancer viral<br>infections and in the state that we've<br>sort of become kind of focused thanks to<br>covert covers to blame for all sorts of<br>things on mRNA based vaccines you<br>reminded me tonight of the importance<br>and the ongoing importance of<br>biodiscovery the use of<br>natural products and their application<br>into cellular biology and Therapeutics<br>and that was a really important reminder<br>tonight<br>so with researchers like yourself<br>leading the way uh row isn't a very good<br>place to continue leading the world in<br>terms of drug Discovery and development<br>now for a personal note those of you who<br>have put put up with my inaugural thank<br>yous before know that there's something<br>coming<br>um I'm very pleased Paul made it here<br>tonight I'm pleased you all made it here<br>tonight but particularly Paul<br>um otherwise I've been in very empty<br>lecture but it I believe it was 23 years<br>ago more or less on this very same week<br>that you missed your welcome party at<br>the school of biological sciences so<br>when I walked into the Victoria room<br>before the first thing I said is thank<br>God you're here because it would have<br>been a very short evening so he turned<br>up tonight<br>now to understand what Paul has brought<br>to the university over the years since<br>missing his own welcome as to recognize<br>as the vice Chancellor mentioned he's<br>been a program director a director of a<br>cross-disciplinary research center ahead<br>of school an associate Dean and<br>occasionally an act ding ding<br>um and it's not just in his various<br>roles that he's epitomized academic<br>leadership but also his involvement all<br>sorts of random things he's a great<br>citizen of the University so he's been<br>involved in further developments of The<br>Bachelor of biomedical science<br>biotechnology goodness knows what other<br>programs in your role as associate Dean<br>numerous building projects including<br>close to ecology lab mcdermid building<br>to tokyarata<br>last year being co-opted by a particular<br>Deputy PVC into taking over discussions<br>on Wellington science city<br>um that was me by the way and even<br>agreeing to be sent to Vietnam to<br>promote our biotechnology teaching<br>program when his dean of the day me<br>again uh Sid decided I didn't want to go<br>so great citizen in terms of standing<br>stepping up and doing the things I<br>didn't want to do<br>um<br>I think one of the things that's made<br>Paul such a great part about vuw<br>Community is his commitment and<br>willingness to go that a little bit<br>extra<br>um one of the best illustrations I've I<br>haven't given enough already was last<br>year when Paul and I were in a<br>development professional development<br>session together and it was all on zoom<br>and the rest of us it was early winter<br>morning probably this time of year the<br>rest of us were because it was being led<br>out of the UK so it was in the middle of<br>the night for them<br>um we're all sort of in our bedrooms or<br>lounges and our jammies staying warm<br>Paul joined over Zoom with a phone<br>strapped to the front of his bicycles he<br>cycled into<br>the university in order to both partake<br>in the professional development session<br>as well as be in time to deliver as<br>lecture that's what Paul does<br>um<br>so however when I asked him what he<br>considered one of his greatest<br>achievements at Victoria he said nothing<br>like what you heard tonight or what I've<br>mentioned he said it was being able to<br>understand an entire Dave Harper me<br>again 10 minute monologue and then<br>summarize it in one sentence and I have<br>to admit over the years I've come to be<br>more and more comfortable with a<br>scenario in which I talk and I talk<br>until the word stop coming out to look<br>over to Paul<br>Paul looks at me he then looks at the<br>rest of the room and he says what Dave<br>really means is X and it's delivered in<br>one sentence I look at Paul I look to<br>the room and I say that's what exactly<br>what Paul says so that's that's one of<br>his best skills his superpower<br>um okay I'd like to close by saying that<br>we all know how important support<br>networks are Paul Illustrated some of<br>those that he's very thankful for and I<br>wanted to acknowledge Paul's networks<br>like his professional Network widen<br>varied thank you to your
