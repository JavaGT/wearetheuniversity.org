the University and I have<br>the honor of Hosting this very special<br>occasion this evening a very warm<br>welcome to all of you who gathered with<br>us in person here in the castle lecture<br>theater and also warm welcome to those<br>of you online both in the present and<br>perhaps in the future are catching up on<br>the video including greetings to Craig's<br>parents who are hoping are online live<br>but maybe catching up on the future if<br>that hasn't quite worked out so it's<br>great to see you all it's great to see<br>you all to because you're here on what<br>is a very special occasion<br>the fact that some of us at least are<br>wearing these robes underlying so it's<br>not a usual day in the University's life<br>those robes are indicated that this is a<br>special moment<br>we wear these robes really these days<br>the two main occasions are our<br>graduations when we celebrate our<br>students completing their academic<br>Journeys with us and at these inaugural<br>professorial lectures where we celebrate<br>our colleagues attaining the highest<br>academic rank in our institution so it<br>is a fantastic occasion to celebrate the<br>work the teaching the research the<br>these are special because they are a<br>celebration of the Core Business of the<br>University they embody and celebrate the<br>Endeavors that are the heart of the life<br>of our Institution<br>the scholarly Journey the creation of<br>new knowledge and the transmission of<br>that knowledge to students to colleagues<br>and to the interested public<br>so it is great that we have all gathered<br>here this evening to celebrate both the<br>outstanding scholar that professor<br>buntis and more broadly to celebrate the<br>importance of knowledge in our community<br>and of course the timing of this<br>Gathering is auspicious with the rising<br>of puaka mataliki it is a great<br>opportunity to look back and to take<br>stock and if any of you heard Professor<br>langi Mata MOA on the radio this morning<br>he said mataliki is about three things<br>reflecting on the past year and more<br>generally reflecting on the past and how<br>you've got to this point<br>taking stock where you are now and also<br>looking forward and that seems to be<br>very much in line with the culpaper of<br>an inaugural professorial lecture<br>so uh katsi I think that is enough for<br>me I will now hand over to Professor<br>Phil Bremer who's our acting DVC<br>academic who will provide a full<br>introduction of Professor<br>buntakoto tenata<br>it's my great pleasure to introduce<br>Professor Craig bunt<br>Craig is a proud Anonymous at the<br>University of otago<br>he completed a bachelor of Pharmacy<br>degree of honors in 1990 and a PhD in<br>1996.<br>Craig's PhD was on factors influencing<br>the micro encapsulation of bacteria and<br>his co-supervisors Dr David Jones and<br>Professor Ian Tucker will be well known<br>to many of us here tonight<br>after completing his PhD Craig worked<br>first as a research officer with<br>inter-egg a Veterinary pharmaceutical<br>company before accepting a role as a<br>senior lecturer and pharmaceutics at the<br>University of Auckland<br>this role was Then followed by a spell<br>as a senior lecturer a senior research<br>scientist at AG research before he<br>returned to Academia as a senior<br>lecturer in animal Sciences at Lincoln<br>University in 2015.<br>in 2021 Craig had the honor of being<br>appointed the inaugural professor of<br>Agriculture Innovation at the University<br>of otago<br>a position in which he has excelled<br>Craig's research focuses on the Livery<br>of biotic compounds and his scientific<br>contribution span Veterinary<br>pharmaceutics food science and<br>Environmental Management<br>as you will hear from Craig this evening<br>his research has led to development of<br>unique transform transformational<br>Technologies which have helped to<br>promote informal sustainability and led<br>to improved agricultural practices<br>Craig is the author of 60 peer-reviewed<br>research Publications he has given over<br>50 oral presentations and he has 16<br>patents including six granted in the U.S<br>Craig is on a number of scientific and<br>Industry advisory boards and has been<br>awarded many honors and distinctions<br>including an oecd's Fellowship in 2015<br>three Awards associated with the ideas<br>on an entrepreneurship challenge in<br>2011.<br>he was the waikato agribusiness<br>Innovation Awards Supreme winner in 2003<br>and in that same year he had a paper<br>recognized by the controlled release<br>societies for an outstanding paper<br>at the University of otago Craig leads<br>the egg vet controlled release lab which<br>researches agreement Veterinary<br>controlled release formulations<br>Craig is also a member of the universe<br>otago's food waste Innovation theme<br>which means it's food waste develops<br>reduction strategies applies innovation<br>technology Innovative Technologies and<br>works to modify producer and consumer<br>Behavior<br>this evening Craig will reflect on his<br>career in agriculture and pharmaceutical<br>sciences and discuss some of the work he<br>has carried out on controlled release<br>formulations Agricultural and Veterinary<br>implications<br>with a particular focus on the<br>development of Advanced Technologies<br>please join us me and welcome Craig to<br>or<br>Guru to O to our tokawiwi<br>nor Greymouth a hoe<br>call Robert<br>Lynnette<br>matua<br>toku wahini<br>thank you for coming out on what's<br>technically a Friday<br>so I very much appreciate it thank you<br>how do I go from Farm pH to f a r m<br>I'm a bad speller those of us who<br>remember School cert<br>in my defense I got 51 for school suit<br>English<br>somebody still corrects my grammar to<br>so I arrived here somehow in 1988 second<br>year of University I've spent a year at<br>Canterbury<br>couple of years before that at high<br>school I'd been to a careers night and<br>heard about Pharmacy that you could go<br>to university and get a degree in<br>Pharmacy and I wanted to do<br>pharmaceutics that sounded interesting<br>so I started on a career in in pharmacy<br>pharmaceutics<br>I've blanked out the names to protect<br>the innocent but we are in alphabetical<br>order that doesn't help trying to figure<br>out where I am<br>um some of us may recognize<br>Lloyd he's still practicing around<br>Dunedin hasn't really changed much just<br>the hairstyle<br>I have to thank Justin Now where's<br>Justin<br>towards the end of my first year in a<br>class being taught by Professor Mike<br>Roberts<br>he said over summer studentship if<br>anybody would like to apply you can<br>spend some weeks in the in the lab<br>working on a research project I had no<br>idea what a summer studentship was<br>and Justin was sitting next to me and he<br>just nudged and said we should we should<br>ask about this so we went up and asked<br>and we were the only ones who asked and<br>we got the positions<br>and that's where it started<br>so I got to spend a wonderful summer in<br>the lab experiencing research outside of<br>the teaching environment talking with<br>postdocs and PhD students we're up to<br>this point I had no idea who they were<br>and I got to see my my lecturers and and<br>Professor Roberts in a totally different<br>environment sitting down in the staff<br>room talking about science not an<br>assignment that's due next week or a<br>test or something<br>um so thank you Justin just right place<br>right time<br>um<br>when I had hair and curls<br>so I have to thank Professor Mike<br>Roberts wholeheartedly who sent me down<br>this pathway<br>Mike in the world of pharmaceutics is a<br>early<br>Trailblazer in in the field of<br>transdermal transdermal drug delivery<br>he's internationally well known<br>immensely respected and if you've ever<br>met Mike in person at no accident that<br>his photo is larger than the rest he has<br>an enormous man<br>but the most gentle kind encouraging man<br>you will ever meet<br>his advice while a student and years<br>later when I'd bump into him at a<br>conference on where you could take your<br>career and how to approach what you're<br>doing is just absolutely outstanding I<br>loved introducing my great students to<br>him whenever I could because I knew that<br>they would get something out of talking<br>with Mike because he always had so much<br>um<br>was new to otaga fresh out of Queen's<br>University Belfast<br>and what I'd done in the lab that a<br>previous summer with Mike grew into an<br>honors project with David<br>I didn't know it at the time I thought<br>that<br>I and some colleagues were keeping them<br>up late at night helping us write our<br>dissertations it turns out he's an<br>insomniac and it was no small it wasn't<br>wasn't really a we weren't putting him<br>out but he sat there with us and he he<br>walked us through the entire process and<br>he'd be there in the lab with us and<br>it'd help us talk about and figure out<br>how to solve problems or approach things<br>and so from that wonderful engagement<br>and an honors project<br>I thought I don't want to leave this so<br>I<br>didn't go out and register as a<br>pharmacist I wanted to stay in the lab<br>be very much a pharmaceutical scientist<br>but I've been benefited from<br>having had the clinical and practice<br>training I had to face while also<br>looking at pharmaceutics it's not not<br>just what a tablet looks like and how it<br>functions it's what's the patient<br>thinking about it how do they face it<br>and interpret it and what's this<br>medication going to mean to that patient<br>in terms of their quality of life now<br>you can apply that to humans but equally<br>to animals and equally to the<br>so with David I went into a PhD<br>with Professor Tucker who was newly<br>arrived as well from Queensland<br>and David went off and had a<br>conversation with Frank and thank you<br>Frank because David came back and said<br>right we're going to do something in<br>vaccines there's challenges and issues<br>around vaccines how well they work<br>and how often we have to give them to<br>livestock could we actually find a<br>better way to do it and so that's the<br>PHD topic I started looking at vaccines<br>is there a better way to formulate them<br>could they work better could we get rid<br>of having to give multi shots<br>we were asking those questions back then<br>it's very relevant today when we think<br>we're up at our third fourth booster for<br>covert wouldn't be great if we could<br>just have one shot there's been no real<br>progress in being able to achieve that<br>but that hasn't held back other<br>discoveries around vaccines<br>and so from 91 to 95 I worked on looking<br>at how I could put small bacteria into<br>tiny particles in the worst possible way<br>you could try to do it we didn't make<br>our life easy we thought if we could put<br>them into a little particle there was a<br>biodegradable polymer that had function<br>and form and other properties we could<br>gain some benefit<br>but the way to do that needed harsh<br>chemicals and harsh mixing could we<br>somehow protect the bacteria or find the<br>right sweet spot of conditions and get<br>the thing to function could the bacteria<br>survive the process there's far easier<br>processes we could have used but they<br>wouldn't have been able to deliver the<br>performance we were hoping to see with<br>the sort of material we were working<br>with<br>there's a scene<br>um in the movie Awakenings where Robin<br>Williams is being interviewed for a job<br>and has commented that he tried to<br>extract something from four tons of<br>earthworms<br>and<br>the interviewee says sister Robin<br>Williams character but that can't be<br>done and Robin Williams says yes but I<br>and I think that movie must have came<br>out came out around the time I was doing<br>my PhD or it will soon after and that<br>scene has stuck with me<br>and I thought how do I remembered it<br>right so I I looked it up recently and<br>rewatched it on YouTube and yes I<br>remember it exactly I know that now I<br>know now what not to do when trying to<br>get bacteria into these little particles<br>we constructed we wanted this shell<br>Arrangement and these little wee Pockets<br>here in which we would put bacteria<br>and we thought we came up with a system<br>where we could control how things<br>stuck to different materials that's what<br>the graph on the on the far side is<br>trying to show<br>and we thought we had a wonderful um way<br>of doing it but every time I put<br>bacteria in there they died<br>I had an assay that could quantify they<br>were dead there was definitely nothing<br>alive there so I always said I now know<br>my PhD I was in the lab from 91 to 95<br>but I had to wait another year to<br>graduate students used to protest a lot<br>more vigorously back then than today<br>and I couldn't graduate for quite some<br>time because students kept storming the<br>council<br>and every time they were going to<br>graduate their cohort of students the<br>meeting had to be disrupted and it kept<br>getting put off and I was getting<br>frustrated ah I'm not graduating yet I'm<br>not graduating yet can't get into 1997.<br>could the council just meet and please<br>not tell the students where they're<br>doing it<br>So eventually I graduated so my CV if I<br>look at dates and stuff like that it<br>still to this day in my office if I hear<br>a protest outside I start my first<br>thought is it's the students but lately<br>um so after my PhD I went straight into<br>an industry job I was very lucky<br>somebody who had been at University of<br>otago had had recently left to head up a<br>team for a company in Hamilton could<br>enter AG interag is a rather unfortunate<br>name we we have this Habit in New<br>Zealand of anything AG related tagging<br>the word AG on to it and the starter at<br>the end but you travel through parts of<br>Europe and they think you're from inter<br>because companies are often having the<br>the name AG after them it's the<br>equivalent of limited or something like<br>that so if I was in Germany I was always<br>from inter<br>so as it interact for about about a<br>decade<br>and<br>the team I joined was a small team with<br>quite a specific task and we were<br>looking at this product here<br>that's used to time to control when a<br>cow will go into heat so you can time<br>when you inseminate it and you can then<br>time when carving is so many months<br>later and you can time all that that up<br>with our Dairy cycle our grass-fed Dairy<br>system<br>so I was on the team that looked at<br>taking the version that was being<br>marketed mostly around Europe parts of<br>Asia and australasia and formulating<br>that in a way that would be more<br>acceptable for the regulatory<br>requirements of the US<br>we also looked at other versions for<br>sheep biodegradable polymers as well<br>this one's silicone another<br>biodegradable one and then one for pigs<br>the difference being anatomy and size of<br>and so the the colleague or the friend<br>the the boss the mentor who had left<br>otago about a year before I'd finished<br>my PhD was Michael Rathbone<br>and unfortunately Mike passed away last<br>year<br>and what we did at that company we could<br>not have done without Mike he was<br>somebody who went from Academia to<br>Industry and absolutely flourished<br>he could bring people together from any<br>discipline<br>it could bring people in a room together<br>and have a productive meeting and<br>everybody<br>get them on the same page and everybody<br>he would edit books prolifically and it<br>was a white to me it illustrates just<br>how<br>well he got on with people<br>very few people ever declined the<br>opportunity to contribute to a book Mike<br>would be editing this is just two of<br>something like eight he edited over his<br>career<br>ranging from Human oral mucosal so mouth<br>drug delivery<br>to Veterinary<br>and the people that contributed chapters<br>to these books were leaders and Industry<br>leaders in Laboratories around the world<br>they did not hesitate to engage with<br>Mike and I say again what we did that<br>would not have happened without Mike<br>so what we did was we took an existing<br>product<br>stylized here think of it sort of like<br>an IUD but for cattle and it goes into<br>the vagina<br>and then while it's in there it releases<br>progesterone a natural hormone at<br>controlled rate and that influences the<br>reproductive cycle<br>the version we started working on had<br>been developed by scientists at dsir and<br>and that developed it for many markets<br>but they needed a slightly different<br>version for the U.S market and so the<br>research we undertook took it from still<br>essentially a t-bar thing but to<br>and this this paper actually describes<br>the the research and the stages we went<br>we did a lot of typical lab work<br>formulation work and what we usually do<br>in formulation science change the ratio<br>of ingredients and and how we process<br>them and prepare them very much like<br>cooking what happens if you adjust to<br>this ingredient influence that one over<br>mix it under mix it what do you get and<br>so all of these graphs are showing with<br>the slopes is that if we change<br>something we get a change and we can<br>understand what that change means if we<br>apply formulation science so my<br>colleagues in formulation science will<br>know that if we increase drug load we<br>probably increase how much drug comes<br>out if we change the material properties<br>of the bulk of the material we'll<br>probably change how things come out as<br>well<br>so we did the usual increase how much<br>you have in there you'll increase how<br>much comes out you make it a harder<br>material it'll take longer to come out<br>that's the beauty of test tube work it's<br>easy to do it's there in front of you<br>it's usually predictable and then you go<br>into the animal<br>and so the figure on the left a flat<br>line is showing us nothing happened we<br>change things along the bottom axes but<br>this flat line here<br>everything we'd seen in the lab didn't<br>happen in the animal<br>turns out that wasn't a disaster with<br>what we knew from how it worked in the<br>lab and then started to figure out why<br>isn't it working like that in the animal<br>we were able to make something that<br>functioned exactly the same as<br>the earlier version the older version<br>and make a newer version for the US<br>market that had less drug in it<br>but still was able to obtain the same<br>delivery<br>so lesson same response that kind of<br>goes against the understanding of models<br>of how drug usually gets out<br>and so we realized we were working with<br>something different than expected novel<br>and non-obvious<br>so that actually allowed us to get a<br>series of patents around that<br>I was lecturing on these patterns today<br>actually to a class of Agri students<br>explaining what a patent is so we had a<br>period of exclusivity where only we<br>could make this product<br>here<br>and more specifically we had a product I<br>that was ideal for the US market<br>and so we took that through two U.S<br>registrations so approval to sell it in<br>the US<br>that was the late right at the turn of<br>the 20th century<br>and so up until that point this type of<br>product wasn't available in the US but<br>it's kind of interesting when you see a<br>letter from the FDA on their website<br>saying seize any packages on the Mexican<br>or Canadian border with the word<br>Hamilton and into AG on the packaging<br>so our products were on the market in<br>Mexico and and Canada but the US FDA<br>said no they can't come across the<br>border because it's not approved here<br>you have to uh season destroy but we<br>were getting our product prior to<br>approval into the us because a lot of<br>U.S researchers at universities were<br>using this to understand bovine<br>reproduction<br>and so it wasn't unusual to have a visit<br>all the way down to New Zealand by a U.S<br>researcher you might be going on to<br>Australia or Japan or somewhere visit us<br>in Hamilton and go home with the<br>suitcase full of these things<br>because they weren't importing them and<br>they would bring them back to a<br>university for a research purpose they<br>were allowed to bring them in they<br>weren't destroyed at the airport<br>what I meant was also that we had a lot<br>of U.S researchers who were very<br>familiar with this product knew how it<br>worked actually showed us how it worked<br>in the North American Market or North<br>American farming system<br>and that helped with registration and<br>also helped build a market before it got<br>there<br>and so this product here is is New<br>Zealand's first researched and FDA<br>registered pharmaceutical human or<br>Veterinary and in terms of the quality<br>of manufacture human or Veterinary is no<br>different<br>I joke if there's a zombie apocalypse<br>don't head to the pharmacy where<br>everybody else is breaking in for the<br>medication go to the veterinary practice<br>there's far more and the quality is just<br>and so taking that through to U.S<br>registration got the attention of some<br>very large companies and we ultimately<br>ended up becoming what's called a toll<br>manufacturer Pfizer Pharmacy they were<br>all emerging at the time took on that<br>product Soul distribution rights and we<br>continued to manufacture that in<br>Hamilton to this day it's manufactured<br>in Hamilton and exported all around the<br>world<br>for Pfizer<br>we were also had an agreement with<br>Pfizer to continue researching new<br>products new ways of doing these sorts<br>of things with Veterinary<br>Pharmaceuticals<br>so where previously we'd found that we<br>changed things in the lab and we put in<br>the animal it made no difference we went<br>back to the drawing board and we thought<br>could is there a way we could actually<br>still influence things that what changes<br>in the lab still does actually show a<br>difference in the animal and so we found<br>a way that we could change the<br>formulation put it in the animal and<br>we'd get a change in blood level with<br>the thing would actually work as<br>expected<br>normally these sorts of products you're<br>only aiming for this blood level that<br>this graph is representing down the<br>bottom here just this amount is fine but<br>we found we could double that five times<br>that<br>that higher level would have enabled<br>endocrinologists and and animal<br>reproduction scientists to try a whole<br>lot of different things or different<br>ways of treating animal fertility<br>but sometimes you find a way to do<br>something better but then you get asked<br>beer but can you still make it just work<br>exactly the same<br>um better isn't always wanted or needed<br>being better and being different can<br>cause all sorts of problems when it<br>comes to registration if you want to<br>register something register something<br>new that's a pharmaceutical that's based<br>on a previous type of product the<br>closest you can stay to that previous<br>product can just help in terms of<br>registration unless there's a dramatic<br>Improvement or better way<br>so we ended up while knowing we could<br>making something that worked exactly the<br>same as the previous product but this<br>one unlike the previous product is<br>totally biodegradable it will<br>undergo a breakdown in the environment<br>microbes will eat it and there'll be no<br>Trace left<br>the earlier devices made from silicone<br>it won't break down in the environment<br>it won't create microplastics but it<br>will be dug up by archaeologists in<br>about two thousand years wondering what<br>when you're in Industry you keep a close<br>eye on on the competition<br>this is a device produced by a company<br>again in Hamilton<br>that contained some complex Electronics<br>a way to retain in the animal and a<br>little reservoirs and valves and<br>solenoids and out and things to pump out<br>one drug and pump out this could<br>actually give a whole therapeutic<br>program a regime of continuous Dragon<br>shot here and a shot there over a week<br>and so you could put this in in theory<br>and then come back eight days later and<br>the animals at a certain stage in the<br>reproductive cycle<br>that was the theory it actually got to<br>Market which is great because then you<br>can go out and buy these things if<br>you're the competition you don't have to<br>wait for one to fall off the back of a<br>truck so we went out and bought a whole<br>lot of these started testing them maybe<br>within about two weeks knew more about<br>this than the company knew<br>um<br>about two weeks later they actually<br>recall all of their stuff from the<br>market it just did not work<br>they claimed it was because of this<br>retention device the way it's stuck in<br>the animal<br>we found that that was about the only<br>bit that did work<br>these complex Electronics totally<br>covered in basically Vaseline to protect<br>them just couldn't survive the<br>environment they were going into the<br>whole whole thing just failed and it<br>never functioned<br>and we thought that this is actually<br>over engineering<br>so we thought how simple can we make it<br>how much can you pair it back<br>we thought well<br>it was a technology we were aware of<br>that produced gas and a syringe to put<br>lubricant into an industrial equipment<br>so that you don't have to go along every<br>day and squirt with a grease gun<br>and so we started playing around with<br>that and we came up with a syringe<br>that has a tiny little gas generating<br>unit at the bottom there and you can set<br>it to go off at a rate that takes hours<br>days or weeks to just basically push a<br>syringe out then push on other Pistons<br>and give a dose of this and a<br>continuous something else so we're able<br>to show that this device could give a<br>continuous delivery of something and<br>also give a couple of pulses of<br>something else so you could start to<br>build in a whole treatment into the one<br>device the device goes in you don't have<br>to keep visiting the animal yarding the<br>animal and and treat it from a very<br>this while it's a simple device it was<br>incredibly expensive to do it's<br>injection molding you have to build a<br>mold or have a mold machined going into<br>a complex Plastics making machine to<br>make these components so just the<br>equipment to well not even the equipment<br>the mold to make this was like about<br>forty thousand dollars to and going in a<br>you know 200 half a million dollar<br>Plastics machine to make something that<br>ultimately probably would have the<br>ingredients the plastic we would have<br>wanted to have kept the cost quite low<br>so we sort of parked that one it's it<br>was probably functioning great it<br>probably could have been better or could<br>have been Advanced further but it really<br>wasn't going to replace how things were<br>used<br>but right around about that time<br>I met a student at<br>um<br>waikato who was interested in doing a<br>master's project<br>and he had previously been an<br>electronics engineer for the New Zealand<br>Air Force<br>and so he knew electronics and we'd<br>gained all this experience from these<br>devices and animals<br>and so we had<br>a syringe that's got a gas generator<br>pushing this piston the good thing about<br>it having the electronics inside the gas<br>generating area has been it's always a<br>positive pressure<br>stuff isn't going to leak into there<br>like the commercial one we've previously<br>seen<br>having come from the New Zealand Air<br>Force where there isn't really much of a<br>budget for anything every time<br>um<br>Peter said oh can I put this on it I<br>said yeah do that<br>what if I put this this on it yeah do<br>that so what started out as a project<br>just to control how this syringe works<br>we also had a radio transmitter on it<br>putting out a signal every 15 minutes<br>and asking if there was any other<br>devices there we had a motion sensor on<br>there we had a light sensor on there<br>Peter said wire light sensor is going<br>inside the animal I said if it detects<br>light we know it's fallen out<br>so we just thought what can we do<br>and this was off the shelf components<br>we could start to measure how active the<br>animal is you can time that up with the<br>time of the day and know if it's<br>sleeping or if it's moving more during<br>the day than at any other time of the<br>month and you can start to then<br>understand what Behavior the animal is<br>showing you can understand what stage of<br>the reproductive cycle it might be or if<br>so we also had this tied up and Linkedin<br>with one of the very early robot milkers<br>based up there as well where you could<br>actually have a closed system with a<br>robot milker is taking the data off<br>these things and understanding or<br>getting an under an interpretation of<br>what's happening with the animal and<br>then deciding whether this device does<br>anything or not<br>it's a good idea at the time was never<br>going to be cost effective we were<br>buying components off the shelf each one<br>of these were 50 or 60 dollars<br>but a lot of what this does<br>you can now do in an ear tag with a<br>little solar panel you can detect<br>movement of the animal you can use that<br>to interpret the behavior the condition<br>of the animal ID at who's it interacting<br>with with<br>quite cheap highly functional<br>Electronics<br>and that's about when I finished my time<br>at interact<br>and went on to other things and my time<br>at interact was was very linear we went<br>on from this and this and this and it's<br>quite encapsulated<br>then for my next three positions I<br>thought are they linear they're not they<br>often had bits overlapping they had<br>projects started here ended up being<br>finished there so I thought I'd bring<br>them all together if my PhD was I now<br>know what not to do then my time at<br>Auckland University was very much<br>featured by welcome to Pitt to pbrf now<br>pbrf is a thing where every academic in<br>the country every six years or so gets<br>assessed individually gets graded<br>and so I walked into a pbrf round having<br>never been in a pbrf round before<br>my colleagues were like oh you haven't<br>been at University you haven't been in<br>Academia<br>you're going to struggle to get a good<br>score and the pbrf is around measuring<br>the impact of your research and I<br>thought no that shouldn't mean that just<br>because I've been an academic I've been<br>an industry my research should be any<br>less impactful or have any less impact<br>and so I thought no you don't have to be<br>in Academia for your research to be of<br>Worth to be of impact so I put all the<br>stuff I've done in Industry into my<br>evidence and got an assessment and it<br>was a good assessment I had arguments<br>with the research office who are saying<br>no a paper is not the same as a patent a<br>paper is worth far more from a journal<br>than a patent is and I was going but<br>that patent was licensed to Pfizer it<br>doesn't that show impact so I felt like<br>I had to educate the research office<br>where in the guidelines does it say a<br>paper is worth more than a pattern we<br>got down to arguing they sent me the<br>list and they said here's the list<br>papers are at the top and I said nowhere<br>does it say that this list is a list of<br>priorities<br>so I have a um a passion to this day<br>about pbrf and understanding exactly<br>what it what it is which probably<br>explains why I'm on a tick<br>um sector reference group that's trying<br>to reframe and redesign the pbrf system<br>and I think the pbrf system is a good<br>system I might get right out of the<br>University by my colleagues for saying<br>that<br>but it actually helps you understand why<br>you're doing what you're doing<br>I then went to AG research for a bit<br>this is where threads start to come<br>together<br>I went into AG research which was very<br>much a corporate type model but not as I<br>knew it when I'd worked in Industry at<br>into AG we had a CEO that trusted us and<br>said<br>you're the experts you do this this the<br>CEO we think is a myth they do exist<br>Bill Thompson very much put a team<br>together and said I've hired you because<br>you're the expert you do it that's why<br>Mike was able to flourish and show what<br>he could achieve he had a team around<br>here that could do that with them at AG<br>research that's not the situation if the<br>funding model for universities is being<br>discussed and how it fails the<br>University Systems then and the CRI<br>Crown research institutes the funding<br>model for that is is absolutely<br>atrocious and devastating for<br>science and the people who work there<br>and I can say that now because I have<br>academic freedom but I could have never<br>said that when I was at AG research and<br>we'll get to another point about that<br>and then I literally moved across the<br>road from AG research<br>to Lincoln University into the middle of<br>a PBR ref round again having spent a<br>significant proportion beforehand not in<br>Academia and a new pbrf office at an<br>Institute where I had to re-educate to<br>them why commercial research is the same<br>in terms of impact as a publication in a<br>in a journal somewhere<br>what I went to look at at AG research<br>though and this is where threads start<br>to come together<br>was can we use microbes as an<br>alternative to agri-chemicals for<br>pasture Pest Control to help plants grow<br>better as herbicides and such<br>rather than chemicals use the the<br>natural<br>disease-causing organism or the<br>beneficial micro that helps a plant grow<br>plants can't grow without microbes when<br>people say soils in south of Auckland<br>are sterile and nothing grows there and<br>it's like there's Market Gardens you<br>just cannot have a plant grow if there<br>isn't<br>a microbe or the right microbes there in<br>the soil<br>this is grass grub it's a major pasture<br>pest in New Zealand<br>and it can be infected by this bacteria<br>growing on a petri dish here called<br>saratia<br>and it causes a condition called Amber<br>disease<br>so this black line through the grass<br>grow up here is its gut you can see it's<br>gut content when it gets infected by<br>saratia<br>the saradia stops the grass grub eating<br>and the grass grub will die and create a<br>little pool of nutrients for the sorata<br>to grow into so the serratia bacteria is<br>a predator of grass grub<br>and some natural microbe in the soil<br>these two exist or can exist or the<br>Cerati can't exist without the grass<br>scrub<br>but sometimes grass grow populations get<br>out of hand or soil sometimes are<br>missing that grass scrub you might have<br>had a soil that's not had a grass scrub<br>in there for a long time so the saradia<br>doesn't hang around because it's got<br>nothing to eat grass grub gets back in<br>and gets out of hand<br>a very early product to take this from<br>the lab or from manufacturing through to<br>the paddock was basically injecting a<br>liquid preparation a liquid culture that<br>needed to be refrigerated<br>it was full of problems<br>um had to be diluted with water if the<br>Farm's water was on Town Supply and it<br>was chlorinated that killed it this<br>product didn't work in the market partly<br>because we didn't know exactly how to<br>use these as alternatives to Agri<br>chemicals Agri chemicals are kind of<br>robust and idiot proof you can treat<br>them in a shocking way and they'll still<br>work when you put them out there put<br>this in the back of your truck during a<br>Norwest or in Canterbury for the weekend<br>and by Monday morning it's all dead and<br>you put it out there and you say oh it<br>didn't work of course it didn't work you<br>didn't treat it right<br>so when I was at AG research we were<br>taking these microbes putting them onto<br>surfaces onto zeolite which is a mineral<br>into granules and stabilizing them<br>keeping them alive and happy so that<br>they would be on the Shelf be more<br>robust than a liquid culture and you<br>could put them out there in the paddock<br>and and deliver this microbe as an<br>and while from my PhD I knew what not to<br>do it didn't necessarily mean I knew<br>what to do<br>why are microbe dyes and and doesn't<br>reanimate why what looks like a perfect<br>environment for it to survive yet it<br>doesn't is incredibly difficult to get a<br>get our heads around we can perform an<br>autopsy on an animal but how do you<br>actually figure out how bacteria died<br>so we would typically do a lot of<br>screening and what we're looking for<br>here is just anything that survives for<br>long enough and what we're looking at<br>here is a trichoderma which I call a<br>yeast but my colleagues who understand<br>trichoderma tell me off for that but<br>it's a it's a fungi that resides in soil<br>helps plants grow and help them survive<br>their environment they can impart<br>resistance to fungal attack they can<br>help plants access nutrients in the soil<br>and so if you have that microbe that<br>trichoderma on the seed<br>before you plant it then that seed will<br>germinate in an environment that has<br>these beneficial microbes around it<br>but it's no easy task to make sure that<br>that microbe is alive during storage of<br>the seed and planting and germination<br>so it's the same sort of thing we have<br>with rhizobia and clover or the right<br>microbe and legumes have those two<br>together and the legume the bean grows<br>and it's able to capture nitrogen out of<br>the air well if you grow a legume and<br>that rhizobia that microbe that helps it<br>do that isn't there then your legume<br>won't grow so we use these microbes<br>across agriculture<br>but the challenges<br>getting them to survive<br>this is a bit of work with PhD student<br>Scott who was at Canterbury at the time<br>and he was in our lab at AG research<br>and sometimes we get a result this flat<br>line means that we could keep this<br>pseudomonas ADP this bacteria are alive<br>at room temperature sitting on the shelf<br>for 10 weeks if we treated it this way<br>but if we did it another way it's dead<br>in two weeks<br>started to think maybe it's how moisture<br>is controlled<br>um<br>the materials we were using there one<br>was a New Zealand what's called zeolite<br>a clay mineral one was an Australian<br>clay mineral they're both the same class<br>and so is that AG research for about<br>four years putting microbes onto things<br>stabilizing probiotics for animal health<br>and also using microbes as herbicides<br>for controlling Thistle and things like<br>that<br>Scott after his PhD went off to the EOS<br>and he went to the USDA working on<br>formulations for wildlife control so<br>these are ways for controlling pissed<br>animals or improving survival and health<br>of endangered animals<br>I visited him at one point around about<br>2014 I think<br>and where he was at in Fort Collins in<br>Colorado<br>there happened to be a herd of bison<br>and these bison are part of a herd<br>that's been separated off from the Bison<br>Hood that's in Yellowstone which is<br>about the only one in the U.S of pure<br>bison<br>so it's kind of risky the only place in<br>the US where there are still bison is in<br>Yellowstone which is sitting on a<br>volcano<br>so there's an effort to create a second<br>herd of bison<br>somewhere else in the U.S and so they're<br>looking at creating one in Northern<br>Colorado Wyoming and so these are some<br>of the first bison cows that were<br>brought in to start to build up a new<br>herd I happened to be there at the time<br>when they were synchronizing them for<br>insemination and embryo transfer and so<br>these<br>bison here actually have a cedar in them<br>this thing I worked on<br>back in my industry days I go to this<br>site and I see that they're actually<br>using something we use here in New<br>Zealand for in our dairy industry<br>they're using it to increase the<br>population of an endangered species<br>that's tough to see that<br>I kept talking with Scott and the next<br>year I got an oecd fellowship and I went<br>back to his lab for three months so we<br>had a sabbatical in Fort Collins and I<br>happened to get back just as they were<br>carving<br>it's kind of nice to see the year before<br>something you've worked on as helping<br>bison get in calf and then you come back<br>in the next year<br>and you happen to be there when the car<br>the the Bisons start carving and you<br>arrive at work one morning and the News<br>cameras are all lined up because that<br>was a big news that was one of the first<br>pure bison to be birthed in that part of<br>the us in a very long time<br>so while I was there we were also<br>talking with other scientists at the<br>USDA the Department of Agriculture there<br>about you know ways of doing things<br>differently<br>and an issue with the Bison is they are<br>susceptible to a disease called<br>brucellosis and in Yellowstone they<br>require vaccination but we can't<br>vaccinate them with traditional darts<br>because that would be leaving bits of<br>plastic and needle lying around a<br>national park<br>so we started talking about well could<br>we use 3D printing to print a diet that<br>we load with a vaccine it's from a<br>biodegradable material so if you Misses<br>it's going to break down in the<br>environment but if you get it into the<br>animal there's not a bit of metal<br>getting into it as well so this became a<br>project with some people there but also<br>Ali safarden at aut and a couple of PhD<br>students worked on that so I always<br>joked when I had a 3D printer and people<br>would ask you know are you printing a<br>gun because that seemed to be the<br>standard question when 3D printers came<br>out and my answer was no I'm printing<br>with what I started to understand about<br>how we can stabilize bacteria better and<br>more importantly treat them better we<br>started applying that to food science as<br>well so minmin was a student at Lincoln<br>where we figured out how to make a<br>muesli where these flat lines at the top<br>a probiotic bacteria on a dry muesli<br>that doesn't require require<br>refrigeration so you can open up your<br>musically pour it in your bowl in this<br>the probiotic already you don't need a<br>probiotic<br>yogurt out of the refrigerator to to do<br>that you might not like or be able to<br>take dairy products so we could put<br>probiotics straight there on onto that<br>and stabilize it<br>that was it was a good bit of work that<br>minmin did and she also did a whole<br>range of taste testings of all all of<br>these types of products as well most<br>importantly we could put it on there and<br>probiotics only work if you're taking<br>live bacteria<br>Don will recognized this<br>I mentioned before about academic<br>freedom when I was at AG research I<br>looked at a product that was on the<br>shelf for animal health and it was<br>calling itself a probiotic and I looked<br>at it in the lab and there was nothing<br>alive in there<br>somebody had AG research when I<br>commented to them about that said well<br>you can't tell anybody about that and I<br>said what do you mean he said well our<br>strains of probiotic bacteria they're<br>using<br>you can't tell people that are now<br>putting a product out with nothing alive<br>in it<br>so when I got to uh<br>Lincoln University and colleague Malik<br>Hussein there started talking about I've<br>been engaging with this company called<br>Bible who wants to know what their<br>products like compared to others on the<br>market I said I know that one that won't<br>have anything in it and so we we did<br>some work so basically the green dots<br>are live bacteria<br>the red dots are dead bacteria and this<br>is just after two hours half of them are<br>dead<br>that's when you just leave a probiotic<br>sitting out there on the and exposed<br>environment these incredibly fragile<br>bacteria so we looked at four products<br>sold on the New Zealand Market as<br>probiotics for Animal Health<br>you know these three here have less<br>microbes in them than Dunedin tap water<br>there's practically nothing in there<br>only one product actually contained<br>large amounts of live probiotic bacteria<br>and I remember at a conference once I<br>presented this data and somebody from<br>company BC or D came up to me afterwards<br>and said oh I see you might have a<br>problem with our products I just simply<br>there's no legal definition of probiotic<br>so there's certain key things you have<br>to keep an eye out for does it State how<br>many live microbes are in there and the<br>more the better and the giveaway is if<br>they say at the time of manufacture<br>they only know what it was like when it<br>was back in the factory<br>just want to wrap up with a comment<br>about some work<br>recent more recent work what happens<br>when a material scientist like myself is<br>married to a historian who takes a<br>material cultural approach to history<br>and mentions that early explorers in<br>Antarctica we're using an Innovative<br>scientifically Advanced thing back in<br>the late 1800s early 1900s when<br>exploring Antarctica taking with them<br>dog biscuits we just think dog biscuits<br>dog biscuits were a scientific advance<br>of the age<br>and I just said well I wouldn't have<br>trusted anything the victorians made<br>and my wife who's the historian Joe<br>Haley said well how would we know he<br>said we could analyze it<br>but we can't destroy this this is a<br>historic artifact even though this is a<br>broken biscuit in the collection of<br>Canterbury Museum<br>I said well no we don't have to destroy<br>it we can use instruments here at otago<br>University we'll go down to here's a<br>good excuse for us to go down to Dunedin<br>we love visiting Dunedin and working<br>with Keith Gordon's group and Sarah and<br>Co and Jeremy aiming some spectroscopy<br>at bit of the dog biscuit getting an<br>understanding what they make these out<br>of<br>and yeah things that were<br>looking like bits of bone bits of bone<br>things that were bits of brown were<br>probably bits of meat think a cabin<br>bread with a hint of meat in it it was<br>still a scientific advance of the age<br>and was probably better than anything<br>else they were still feeding thinking<br>and so we published this and this<br>illustrates an issue you can have when<br>you've got a multi-disciplinary team<br>we've got historian material scientists<br>spectroscopist somebody understanding<br>animal science animal nutrition writing<br>a paper<br>we were lucky that we had an editor who<br>could understand what we were trying to<br>do the reviewers couldn't and many of<br>you will know what I mean by we ran into<br>problems with reviewer too<br>who wanted all that boring history stuff<br>out put into the appendix but no this is<br>very much a history paper using science<br>to just simply support what the history<br>was saying or how we were understanding<br>the history we placated them by putting<br>all the spectroscopy data and more into<br>and there was a lot of stress while<br>writing this paper because a husband and<br>wife don't always work together but this<br>is Georgia and Georgia has a fetish for<br>paper and she's a husky retriever cross<br>um they eat paper for some reason<br>and one day I had to say to Jill my wife<br>I'm sorry the dog ate my homework<br>I was working on a printed out draft and<br>I turned around and it was shredded and<br>I'll wind up and thank you so much I'd<br>like to thank the PhD students I've<br>worked with the postdocs the Masters<br>colleagues friends<br>from everywhere this this list is far<br>too short that there are so many people<br>I am sorry I've forgotten<br>I've had an amazing time since starting<br>here at otago moving off around the<br>country and coming back<br>and normally I I would have probably<br>have ended my talk here because I came<br>here in the middle of a pandemic<br>don't get involved in a new program at a<br>university during the middle of a<br>pandemic<br>but I can tell you something about what<br>we've done in the last two years to wrap<br>up so the two years I've I've had with<br>the program have been absolute blast<br>there's a lot of questions why is otago<br>doing stuff in ag that's Lincoln and<br>Massey well if you're going to be on a<br>farm or visiting a farm every day then<br>probably Lincoln and Massey if you're<br>somewhere else in the massive sector<br>that is agriculture in our primary<br>industry in a otago degree with some egg<br>in there is probably going to AG proof<br>your degree<br>so we're engaging with Farmers up in<br>ranfurly who are trying to get on top of<br>pasture pests and put in mixed species<br>pastures and being able to better stock<br>better look after their land<br>we've been at Field Days twice now and<br>nobody was shocked to seriously and what<br>surprised me most recently was how many<br>otago graduates<br>are already there at field days they're<br>already out in the sector our graduates<br>have done botany in geography and and<br>marketing they're already in the sector<br>we also had a great field trip last year<br>to one of the medicinal cannabis Growers<br>didn't sample anything we just had so<br>much fun that day we wore out more<br>recently talking with farmers who are<br>looking at regenerative practices those<br>who say will never change how we Farm<br>and recognizing that they don't Farm how<br>their parents farmed farming always<br>changes always evolves we find better<br>ways more productive ways but we also<br>are looking for ways that have less<br>environmental impact that are not only<br>better for the environment but also<br>better for the people who work or<br>associated with the sector as well so<br>I've had an absolute blast talking with<br>people down this way who are trying to<br>change farming practices reduce stock<br>numbers go to once a day milking doesn't<br>actually reduce your productivity it can<br>actually keep your productivity air as<br>it was might even improve it but you're<br>already moving down a pathway reducing<br>emissions and so these people have<br>already got on with this and started<br>anticipating things or knowing we needed<br>to change things before here walking or<br>ever came out they're already doing it<br>out there and engaging with these people<br>who then feed back into the research we<br>can do and help them understand what is<br>working and what isn't working has been<br>an excellent wonderful opportunity<br>I've also got to work with the first<br>cohort of students that went through the<br>program<br>what was great about a small cohort is<br>they tend to be very honest in their<br>opinions and understanding and in<br>interpretations and their feedback is<br>far better than any student appraisal at<br>the end of the year where they've got to<br>write things down when they can just<br>tell you straight to their face oh we'd<br>like to hear about this can you arrange<br>the speaker you can so with Connie and<br>Archie and Claire are our first<br>graduates who have done the major and<br>they're out there in the sector<br>and Archie's with ag research<br>Connie's with fonterra and clears with<br>silver Fern Farms they're not on a farm<br>every day or visiting every day but<br>they're somewhere in the agricultural<br>sector<br>so thank you so much and I'll I'll<br>finish there thank you<br>this is why<br>why the selection of<br>praying has the inaugural chair in<br>agricultural Innovation at the title is<br>so act<br>obviously if you look back in the<br>history<br>James mcgarden suggested that one of the<br>foundational papers for a degree<br>structure of Italian University should<br>be agricultural chemistry<br>that topic was dropped for the<br>succeeding 146 years<br>and it was a very low gestation which<br>which has been completely satisfactory<br>four years ago when we had the rebirth<br>of Agriculture Innovation out of town<br>and obviously this is especially<br>appropriate as an inaugural presentation<br>because an older presentation from a<br>novel Professor is about as authentic as<br>thank you<br>it's really more than words to listen to<br>me and assisting to me Amplified<br>so we are at a special stage and and<br>involving agricultural innovation in<br>otago was this very special development<br>which we applaud the university for<br>supporting as a new initiative<br>it was exciting because we obviously had<br>to make sure that this didn't compete<br>with existing agriculture programs and I<br>think we have succeeded in going down<br>that Avenue very satisfactory we're<br>living in a world where Innovation<br>especially in agriculture is critically<br>important<br>and it's critically important because we<br>have been so successful in developing<br>agricultural modalities<br>that some of them have become quite<br>destructive<br>and that is where the major the major<br>Target for the Innovation studies at<br>otago is looking at problems rather than<br>looking at more production or more<br>whatever so this is a very special time<br>and obviously along the way we have<br>caused very significant environmental<br>incursions which have been destructive<br>and hopefully I mean we have even<br>created a new epoch<br>a geologic Epoch called the anthropocene<br>and the anthropocene is the first period<br>known in human existence where what we<br>do affects the climate and possible<br>stability of our climate and our planet<br>so we have a responsibility<br>especially involved in University to<br>create an environment in which we we<br>look at solutions to these problems so<br>we are very excited that you have taken<br>the chair in agricultural Innovation we<br>believe your appointment is entirely apt<br>because all we have to do is to look at<br>the range of activities that you've been<br>involved with since agriculture<br>to make you ideally equipped to address<br>a whole lot of what diverse problems<br>which are presented in agriculture so<br>we're very excited if we look at the<br>range of things you've been involved<br>with<br>you've looked at formulation and<br>delivery around nutrition probiotics<br>contraception wool healing infection<br>control population control controlled<br>release of fertilizers<br>and you've targeted systems which range<br>from soil to Grass scrubs from Wildlife<br>domestic livestock and this is the whole<br>brief that we would expect to<br>have incursions into agriculture at all<br>sorts of different levels<br>so we're we're very excited we we<br>recognize the value of Applied research<br>and we think it's it's very important<br>you have 16 patents you have four<br>registered products that you have<br>produced with lovely names like<br>bioshield hug on base right<br>and the special cedar because Cedars are<br>very special in New Zealand parlance<br>because New Zealand has been a world<br>leader in<br>animal reproduction especially in<br>animals and that was initially found<br>around the cedar so we're very<br>interested in that so uh<br>that allows me to hopefully find the The<br>this is my second Duty and that is to<br>present you with this little token of<br>appreciation from the University<br>so thank you for presenting the lecture<br>and we hope that will bring you some<br>pleasure<br>I now have some very minor duties to<br>perform which are to thank the audience<br>for visiting and engaging today we<br>appreciate that very much and secondly<br>we would like to invite the audience<br>for Refreshments at the staff club and<br>for those of you not totally familiar<br>with campus go outside the main door<br>take a right turn and keep on walking<br>until you get up to the bridge and<br>that's the staff Club if you find any<br>older person wandering around going into<br>a building that's likely to be somebody<br>going to the staff Club<br>so thank you for your attention thank<br>you for your presentation it has been a<br>joy to hear the variety of your research<br>thank you</p></main><footer style="margin-top: 2rem; background: #0001; padding: 2rem; text-align: center;"><p>We Are The University</p><ul style="list-style-type: none; padding:
