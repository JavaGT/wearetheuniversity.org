of for a normal lecturer<br>uh curate Koto I'm John Hoskin I'm the<br>dean of science here at the University<br>of Auckland waipapa tamatara<br>and it's my very great pleasure to<br>welcome you to the inaugural lecture of<br>Vivian Kirk<br>scientists and other professionals such<br>as engineers and economists are always<br>interested in understanding how things<br>change over time<br>to enable them to develop models that<br>predict what will happen next in a given<br>situation<br>to construct such protective models they<br>turn to applied mathematicians such as<br>Vivian<br>to provide the more formalisms for both<br>expressing and testing their models<br>these models belong to the broad area<br>known as dynamical systems<br>they help describe phenomena such as the<br>spread of infectious disease principles<br>of robotic control or the physiology<br>underlying cell signaling<br>Vivian's case she has a particular<br>expertise in heteroclinic networks that<br>describe interacting cyclic systems<br>which can be used for example to<br>describe population Dynamics and<br>intracellular placed in calcium Dynamics<br>which can be used to describe house<br>cells send signals to other cells<br>Vivian obtained Bachelor of Science and<br>master of science degrees here at the<br>University of Auckland and then a PhD<br>from the University of Cambridge<br>after postdocs at Berkeley and Caltech<br>she returned to New Zealand to a<br>lectureship here at the University of<br>Auckland<br>Vivian has been active for many years in<br>supporting the recruitment retention and<br>development of women in mathematics and<br>in science more generally<br>as a past president of the New Zealand<br>mathematical society and a fellow of<br>that Society<br>since 2017 she has been associate Dean<br>doctoral in the factory of science<br>as Dean I'm enormously grateful for her<br>work assisting with the well-being of<br>our postgraduate students during the<br>covert pandemic<br>tonight Vivian is going to tell us how<br>to make good use of time I'm sure she's<br>developed some of that as her in her<br>role as associate Dean Vivian the floor<br>thank you<br>go to Koto it's lovely to see so many<br>friendly faces today in the room so<br>thank you for coming it's I've been to<br>quite a few inaugural lectures over the<br>years and one of the things that's fun<br>about them is that people often talk<br>about their Roots into whatever their<br>disciplinary area is and they look at or<br>talk about things that they did in their<br>childhood that kind of maybe gave a<br>steer to where they were going to end up<br>in their professional careers so I've<br>been to some biology talks recently<br>where there are these lovely stories<br>about exploring the back garden and you<br>know going on to have nice pictures with<br>plants and animals and other things and<br>and that makes a really nice part of an<br>inaugural lecture now that's this is a<br>problematic approach for a mathematician<br>so it's really rare for our parents to<br>have taken photos of us communing with a<br>mathematical object as a child and so<br>like many mathematicians and a really<br>important part of my development was<br>growing up in a home where Mass was seen<br>as fun and useful and where people were<br>not scared of mathematical calculations<br>but they just aren't photos to support<br>their speed of my childhood<br>and so there's a more serious<br>consequence of this lack of mathematical<br>artifacts that are recognizably<br>mathematical that's more important than<br>finding photos for inaugural lectures<br>and that is that it's quite hard<br>sometimes for people to to understand<br>what it is that mathematicians actually<br>do<br>so I thought I'd start off with a couple<br>of examples of<br>things that people might think<br>mathematicians do<br>so the first one that comes from my<br>colleague Eamonn O'Brien who's here<br>tonight who received a wonderful letter<br>a couple of months ago I'm going to show<br>you the letter you'll see how beautiful<br>it is I'm not sure if you can read it<br>from this I'm going to read out the<br>so it starts off Dear Professor O'Brien<br>mathematicians who work with large<br>numbers impress me no end how<br>extraordinary it must be to be you<br>and so far this is so good Eamonn is a<br>really impressive mathematician by<br>anybody's account okay but then the<br>letter goes on to be able to count out<br>loud to a trillion or even a zillion so<br>effortlessly<br>and so now the mathematicians in the<br>audience will be starting to Twitch<br>surely surely this is not what Eamon<br>does and also if he wanted to he<br>couldn't so counting out loud to a<br>trillion even at an unrealistic speed of<br>one number every second with no breaks<br>would take you 31 000 years so that's<br>not what Eamon does<br>and so then the letter goes on to<br>describe the author getting bored and<br>lost while trying to count to ten<br>thousand and expresses admiration that<br>world-class mathematicians can count<br>large numbers without getting lost<br>then the later finishes with and that is<br>why I have sent this to you to express<br>my admiration at your ability to count<br>so fast so much and so well<br>so that's a that's a lovely I think<br>that's a lovely letter I don't need to<br>tell you that this is not what Eamon<br>does he does not spend his days counting<br>out loud and I'm quite sure that the<br>writer of the letter didn't think that's<br>I didn't think that was the case either<br>but if all the numbers in the world are<br>known already and mathematicians don't<br>count them anyhow what is it that they<br>do<br>um so I've got a second example which is<br>based much more closely in reality<br>and this is um this is a photo of Alex<br>James who's a professor of mathematics<br>at the University of Canterbury and she<br>was one of the of the large covert<br>modern team at the center of research<br>Excellence to punaha matatini in 2020<br>and 2021 she reported being rung by the<br>prime minister's office about 6 PM one<br>evening in August 2021 and being asked<br>what if we found some covert cases with<br>no border links in a large family in<br>South Auckland how bad would this be by<br>the way we need to know by 7 30.<br>now there were many people involved in<br>covert modeling in New Zealand in in<br>those years including a few who are in<br>the room right now and I'm sure many of<br>them will have been put in similar<br>situations to this<br>um to this one that Alex faced but the<br>part I particularly like about Alex's<br>version is what came next<br>so Alex was in the middle of putting her<br>kids to bed or getting them ready for<br>bed when the phone call came in so she<br>ran her simulations while bathing her<br>kids and reading them stories and then<br>phoned the prime minister's office and<br>so the images brings to mind of a<br>mathematician doing something that's you<br>know really important but during that<br>really fraught bedtime hour as as rather<br>lovely I think<br>so these two examples of what<br>mathematicians might or might not do<br>really rather extreme ranging from this<br>tongue-in-cheek example of a suggesting<br>that method has just count bigger and<br>bigger numbers to a real example of a<br>mathematician having direct influence on<br>something that's quite important in fact<br>most mathematicians including me work<br>somewhere in between these extremes and<br>one of my aims tonight is to give you a<br>taste for the kind of mathematics I'm<br>interested in and what it is that I do<br>each day<br>so the area of of my work is called<br>dynamical systems and so loosely<br>speaking we could Define it like this<br>dynamical systems analysis aims to<br>understand the way something changes the<br>time and this this is very vague and it<br>sounds like a bid to take over the world<br>really because quite a lot of things<br>change with time and so hopefully the<br>examples that I give you will give you a<br>better indication of the um<br>of the general direction<br>so the the thing there's something that<br>we might be thinking about could be the<br>spread of of infectious disease like<br>covert or it could be something like um<br>trying to understand climate change and<br>these are both<br>um things that depend in really<br>complicated ways on a whole range of<br>factors that we might know something<br>about or we might not know very much<br>about<br>um but it's clear that we're really<br>interested in understanding how the<br>systems might evolve in the future<br>perhaps less familiar to you but closer<br>to my own area of research is this third<br>example about cell signaling so trying<br>to understand how a message is sent to a<br>cell or within a cell to tell the cell<br>to do whatever it is it's supposed to do<br>like<br>secrete insulin or make saliva or divide<br>or help a muscle contract whatever it is<br>that cell needs to do so these first<br>three examples are all things that you<br>you might recognize come from the<br>physical world there's also a whole<br>nother branch of<br>um of dynamical systems that's really<br>interested in in more abstract problems<br>so these might be they're something<br>that's just fascinating at least to a<br>mathematician just because it's<br>fascinating or it might be something<br>that<br>um it's just an abstract property that<br>that tells us something general about<br>the possibilities for time Evolution and<br>they might later be able to be able to<br>apply to a specific model and so I have<br>a foot in both camps sometimes I'm<br>interested in the and understanding the<br>behavior of a specific model to try to<br>explain some experimental data and<br>sometimes I'm interested in working with<br>these entirely abstract systems doing<br>fundamental Research into their<br>properties and I hope to give you some<br>examples of both of these<br>now if we back up a little bit and think<br>just<br>um for a moment about situations where<br>we're trying to understand something in<br>the physical world then before<br>mathematical techniques can be very<br>useful it's necessary to convert what we<br>know about the physics or the biology or<br>the chemistry or whatever it is into a<br>mathematical model and that's an<br>enormous step in many cases so writing<br>down a mathematical model takes a huge<br>amount of work for a model it's often a<br>collaboration between people who are<br>getting the data and people who are<br>turning it into into mathematics<br>um and and it's really important that<br>it's been done for instance if we want<br>to do some climate modeling and we<br>really want to say things about the<br>climate then probably we need to make<br>sure that we're talking to the<br>physicists and we get the physics right<br>and the climate model<br>and the amount of work required to get<br>to that stage of having a useful model<br>should really not be underestimated but<br>having said that I want to talk mostly<br>about what you do once you've got the<br>model so I'm not going to be talking<br>about the modeling process but about<br>what happens when we've got that model<br>so what kinds of information would we<br>like to extract from the model<br>ultimately we might want to use it to<br>make some predictions about the ongoing<br>behavior of the<br>um of whatever it is that we're trying<br>to model but prior to that dynamical<br>assistance people tend to do a lot of<br>poking and putting of the model to see<br>what are the general types of behavior<br>that can occur and how robust is this<br>model to various types of ways in which<br>you could perturb it<br>we might ask for our particular model<br>we're interested in what types of<br>solution are possible so would Solutions<br>increase would they decrease would they<br>be steady maybe they want to change the<br>time and be periodic so for instance if<br>we were modeling the population of<br>Snapper in the heriki golf we probably<br>want to know what's the long-term trends<br>is it going to go up is the population<br>a second kind of question that we might<br>ask is how does the behavior of<br>solutions depend on the initial<br>conditions that we put into our model so<br>for instance if we were modeling the<br>population of Maui dolphin is the model<br>prediction going to be<br>independent of well probably not going<br>to be independent of the initial<br>condition but is it going to be a<br>critically different depending on<br>whether we assume there's currently 50<br>dolphins or whether we've seen that<br>there are a hundred so what is the<br>critical population size below which in<br>this case Extinction is inevitable at<br>okay third kind of question that we<br>might be interested in in asking is how<br>does the behavior of solutions to our<br>model change with or depend on system<br>parameters we had a great example of<br>this in the um in the pandemic<br>and when we heard a lot about this<br>quantity R naught<br>I think lots of people heard about Arnot<br>and the thing about our naught it's the<br>average number of people that would<br>catch covered from one infected person<br>and if Arnold was less than one that was<br>great because that meant you know things<br>are kind of decreasing the spread of the<br>infection was slowing whereas if Arnold<br>was greater than one then I mean that<br>was a bad thing in the the number of<br>cases might change so if you had a<br>really simple model of covert then you<br>might have Arnold as a constant or a<br>parameter of the model and in that case<br>you can see that a qualitative change in<br>the behavior solutions might result from<br>changing that parameter<br>okay I've got another<br>um example of a slightly more complex<br>transition it might take so what you're<br>going to see now is a video of an<br>experiment done in the group of Stephen<br>Morris in Toronto so he does these<br>fantastic<br>experiments this one is going to show a<br>syrup or a liquid a viscous liquid<br>falling onto a moving trick so Stephen's<br>Canadian here against its maple syrup<br>but it clearly isn't maple syrup but<br>okay so good we'll see in a minute so<br>the the food's coming down and it's<br>falling on the track the track's going<br>quite fast so it's coming in a straight<br>line but now they're slowing down the<br>track and you see the onset of this<br>solitary behavior from a Meandering<br>pattern<br>and as the video goes on it's only a<br>minute or so you'll see the track slows<br>down and you get more and more<br>complicated Behavior<br>oh<br>foreign<br>okay so a change in the qualitative<br>behavior of a solution in response to a<br>change in parameters what we call a<br>bifurcation and bifurcation Theory or<br>the understanding of bifurcations is one<br>of the main things that that I'm<br>interested in my in my work as you'll<br>see a little bit later on in the talk<br>Okay so we've got three questions here<br>so what's the result of perturbing our<br>system or ignoring small factors in it<br>so Willa um<br>when we model something we frequently<br>have to make a choice about which bits<br>of the science we include so an example<br>of this might be a near Earth asteroid<br>if we were trying to model the motion of<br>an earth story we might choose to ignore<br>the effect of the outer planets maybe we<br>think they don't make much difference<br>and so the question a legitimate<br>question for us is what happens if we<br>add that back in does it change the<br>predictions of our model so how robust<br>is our model to these kinds of small<br>perturbations<br>and then the next question is<br>um a related one so which features of<br>whatever model we're looking at are<br>actually necessary for the particular<br>phenomena that we are interested in<br>um so to think about the cell signaling<br>model I gave you before cells are really<br>complicated much more complicated than I<br>know about I'm sure and you could<br>probably put thousands and thousands of<br>things into your model if you really<br>wanted to but for a useful model you<br>probably don't want that many things how<br>much can you exclude before the model<br>becomes useless so these are sort of<br>legitimate questions you might ask when<br>you are constructing a model or when<br>you're poking and prodding your model to<br>see how it behaves<br>so my main interests<br>um in within dynamical systems fall into<br>these two categories one is analysis of<br>specific models and these mostly come<br>from South physiology and then<br>extrapolation to related models and the<br>other area that I'm interested in is the<br>development of of new bifurcation Theory<br>so working out what causes these<br>Transitions and models as you change<br>parameters and so I'm going to tell you<br>about a series of projects that start<br>with the first one and then move into<br>the second one and see how these<br>okay<br>so this is a picture that illustrates<br>two points the first point is that my<br>statement earlier about it being hard to<br>find photos of small children in the<br>backyard doing mathematics is clearly<br>wrong at least in the case when your<br>mother is in mathematician so so these<br>are photos of my children taken quite<br>some time ago and they're standing in<br>front of sunflowers that we had planted<br>about three months prior to<br>um to the photos being taken so I'm not<br>sure what point I was trying to make at<br>the time but we plotted these sunflowers<br>and so this tall sunflower that you can<br>see on the right this is its growth rate<br>that we plotted over you know every few<br>days over several months I can remember<br>being really excited probably more<br>excited than my kids when I saw what<br>looked like sort of exponential growth<br>to start off with and then much less<br>excited when I realized that actually<br>I'd misestimated the vertical scale and<br>I had to stick another piece on up here<br>and that's what these yellow bits are<br>they're the sellotape from the extra<br>Extinction that I had to put on it<br>anyway whatever the reason I was doing<br>that such a long time ago nobody knows<br>but the photos do illustrate a more<br>important point that is important for<br>for the work that I do and that is that<br>that children and sometimes<br>unsurprisingly develop on different time<br>scales so on the left you've got a<br>four-year-old and a six-year-old and a<br>sometimes another four-year-old and<br>six-year-old are about between one and<br>two meters roughly probably one to one<br>and a half<br>um and they've got there by growing at a<br>maximum growth rate of about 10<br>centimeters a year<br>okay the sunflower is 12 weeks old it's<br>close to two meters and from those<br>measurements that I conveniently took I<br>can see that the growth rate is about 10<br>centimeters in three days so the<br>sunflowers growing 100 times faster than<br>um and so so we would say that that<br>sunflower and those children grew on on<br>different time scales now if we look at<br>the picture on the right this sunflower<br>was planted on the same day as the other<br>one so the photos taken the same day<br>same kids different sunflowers and you<br>see that this sunflower is twice as big<br>as the first one so it's clearly grown<br>faster<br>nevertheless the difference between the<br>growth rates of the two sunflowers is<br>much smaller than the difference between<br>the average child growth rate and<br>average sunflower growth rate so we<br>would say there's a characteristic time<br>scale for sunflowers in a characteristic<br>time scale for children and that won't<br>be a surprise to you you would be really<br>surprised if your kids screw 10<br>centimeters in three days<br>so but that's something that we can take<br>over these are different phenomena<br>children and sunflowers so it's not<br>surprising but we can see different time<br>scales in one phenomenon and so this is<br>an example of some data that comes from<br>a lab the herbison lab in<br>um at otago University it's quite old<br>data and they were interested for a<br>reason I'm not going to go into in<br>looking at electrical and calcium<br>activity in a mouse neuron and so what<br>you're seeing here is dual time series<br>that were taken so the two time series<br>are measured at the same time so they're<br>correlated and I'm plotting time along<br>the bottom and up here on the on the<br>vertical axis whatever it is we're<br>measuring the top time scale the top<br>Trace is showing electrical activity<br>within the cell so it's ions coming in<br>and out of the cell creating a current<br>and the the trace on the bottom is<br>showing the calcium concentration in the<br>cell and you don't need to understand<br>anything more about that to understand<br>my point so here on the right in this<br>little box is an enlargement of what's<br>in this box here and you can see more<br>clearly here I think that there's some<br>fast activity going on in the electrical<br>signal so you've got nothing much<br>happening then four sharp bursts and<br>then nothing much and then a bit later<br>nothing much for shut this and then<br>nothing much so that's happening on a<br>quite fast time scale at the same time<br>the calcium is slowly ramping up and<br>slowly ramping down and then doing that<br>so there's clearly two different time<br>scales going on here fast electrical<br>activity slow casting activity and in<br>fact I claim there's a third time scale<br>evident in the data and that's the long<br>gap between bursts of activity here so<br>whatever the model might be for this<br>it's got to have three time scales in it<br>if the data's got three time scales and<br>now we know from general theory about<br>dynamical systems that multiple time<br>scales can induce really quite complex<br>oscillations<br>um to occur so if you've got<br>oscillations in a system with a single<br>time scale it might look something like<br>this so this is a Time series I've<br>plotted from a mathematical model it's<br>not experimental and time is flooded<br>along the horizontal axis and then some<br>variable is always X for mathematicians<br>X is plotted up and you see it just is<br>changing in a regular basis it looks<br>quite like a time a tied chart you know<br>the tides out and then it's in and then<br>it's out in this sort of smooth and<br>regular way and that's typical<br>oscillations in the system with just one<br>time scale whereas if we have two tongue<br>scales then the the time series that you<br>see here is is more typical and so if<br>this were the type this would be weird<br>we start at low tide and then over the<br>next three or four hours the tide cret<br>synovit maybe quarter of the way and<br>then 20 minutes later it's full tight<br>and then the tide goes out again slowly<br>over the next six or seven hours and<br>then 20 minutes later in slow time so<br>that is going to feel different<br>particularly if you'd like to walk on<br>takeaway in the beaches I know John does<br>and so um you know it's a different<br>character to that oscillation and then<br>this third one here well this is really<br>bizarre this for the tide you'd really<br>be worried so this is another two time<br>scale model but you can see it<br>alternates fast and slow Behavior but<br>also tiny oscillations and large<br>amplitude oscillations so the message is<br>if you have multiple time scales in your<br>system you can see quite complicated<br>Behavior now the flip side of that is<br>that the analysis can sometimes be um<br>much easier if you have more than more<br>than one time scale but I don't want to<br>go into that because it's quite<br>technical<br>okay let's go back to the neuron data so<br>there was a PhD student in about 2008 to<br>2011 a Wen Duan who was given the job of<br>looking at the physiology behind this<br>neuron data in constructing a<br>mathematical model and so he did this he<br>did he did a good job he thought about<br>the physiology talked to various people<br>built his model with three time scales<br>and they needed some simulations on it<br>and these were his simulations and if<br>you compare the panel on the right this<br>one here with the panel down here which<br>is his model simulations you see he did<br>a pretty good job qualitatively so<br>there's some fast activity here in in<br>this variable this one goes up slowly<br>and down slowly and then there's a long<br>Gap in between so those qualitative time<br>scale features are captured in his model<br>okay so that's not all he did for his<br>PhD but you know he finished it that was<br>the kind of the extent he did the model<br>and the simulations wrote his PhD wrote<br>the papers and went off and got a job<br>somewhere else and I wasn't really<br>involved in his work<br>um but I was quite interested in the<br>result and the following questions<br>occurred<br>um to a group of us afterwards so first<br>of all one of the characteristics of the<br>time scale he's looking at is this<br>bursting behavior and we know from other<br>work that you can get bursting in models<br>when there are just two time scales and<br>so the question is did he really need<br>those three time scales or can we just<br>you know get rid of half of this model<br>and still get the same behavior<br>the second question is what is the<br>mathematical mechanism that causes the<br>best thing in the model and thirdly how<br>widespread is this mechanism does it<br>appear in other models that might have<br>nothing to do with mouse neurons<br>and so over the next<br>um<br>10 to 12 years we've set about answering<br>some of these questions as well as doing<br>other things and so when's work I think<br>as PhD thesis was 2011 after when came<br>another and really clever PhD student<br>ping Hyun Nan and she proposed she tried<br>to simplify his model and found it he<br>didn't she didn't make much progress on<br>the simplification but what she was able<br>to do was was construct what we call a<br>toy model which had the same bursting<br>Behavior but was you know much lower<br>dimensional much simpler in some ways<br>and so she constructed this and analyzed<br>it and did a few other things in her PhD<br>wrote her PhD and exited as PhD students<br>do and then we spent a couple of years<br>with a colleague in France Matilda Roche<br>thinking about the bifurcations of that<br>model so what happens if we fiddle it<br>around with and tried to change<br>parameters could we understand what the<br>onset of bursting was how did we get<br>from no boosting to bursting and that<br>was a you know a nice piece of work that<br>we finished there and then the most<br>recent part of this model is done by<br>another very clever PhD student Morgan<br>Morgan Mertens who's here tonight and<br>she's looking at an abstract version of<br>the bifurcation that we had identified<br>and trying to characterize it completely<br>so when she's done we're going to know<br>this is whenever you meet this<br>particular bifurcation this is what you<br>expect to see or you know this is one of<br>the possibilities that you might expect<br>to see and so what you can see from this<br>list is how we go from something that's<br>really quite applied trying to<br>understand some experimental data for a<br>very particular system to something<br>that's a contribution a novel<br>contribution to sort of that General<br>understanding of abstract properties of<br>dynamical systems<br>now what I want to do now is talk to you<br>about a project that went in the other<br>direction<br>so this is some much more recent data<br>that was obtained by some of our<br>okay and this is<br>um again it started that they're<br>measuring calcium in a particular type<br>of cell and you don't need to worry<br>about why they're doing it it doesn't<br>matter for the purposes of this talk but<br>what you can see is that there are eight<br>different Pat um panels on this slide so<br>they're measuring calcium in this cell<br>line called heck 293 and they have<br>genetically engineered eight different<br>variants of this for for their purposes<br>and so each panel that you can see is<br>one of the variants<br>and within each panel you can see five<br>Wiggly lines<br>so those five Wiggly lines are five<br>representative cells of that variant of<br>the of the stuff so there are 40 cells<br>up here<br>and um and then what I think you can see<br>is this kind of four parts to each panel<br>so let's focus on this blue one because<br>it's easiest to see there's a part at<br>the beginning and then there's a<br>different part and then a different part<br>and a different part and what they're<br>doing is they're exposing the cell to<br>different concentrations of a chemical<br>and what you can see is that the<br>behavior of the cells is different<br>depending on which bank they're in so<br>which variant it is and how much of that<br>external chemical is being applied<br>so then they sit about trying to explain<br>this with a medical model in the paper<br>they wrote this wonderful statement<br>representative traces were chosen to<br>represent the data set as a whole<br>okay and so here are these 40 40 bits<br>so the published data essentially what<br>I've shown you there plus some other<br>things showed us that calcium<br>concentrations either tended to so here<br>they're sort of sitting at equilibrium<br>value and here it's petering out to<br>equilibrium or you get these spiky<br>oscillations and what you can see is<br>that the frequency depends on the cell<br>variant and the concentration of the<br>applied chemical and so a model that<br>captured this was produced and the main<br>qualitative features of the data was<br>captured and model was validated and<br>they wrote a nice paper in nature<br>Communications excellent nice piece of<br>research<br>then we had a new PhD student who had<br>very sharp eyes and so this is Lloyd Lee<br>who's sitting at the front here and he<br>looked at the raw data so the data that<br>was published or the data that we've<br>made available was the stuff that I<br>showed you before but he asked for the<br>entire data set and what he found was<br>that in more than 10 percent of one of<br>the cell types or one of the variants<br>there was a different type of<br>oscillation this one that is shown here<br>so some spiky ones but then these broad<br>oscillations like this and what was<br>noticed is the original model couldn't<br>produce this kind of broad oscillation<br>now experimentalists seem to have a very<br>good intuition for when they can throw<br>data out you know maybe somebody tripped<br>over the wire or they did the wrong<br>protocol I don't know I'm not an<br>experiments I I don't know what's what's<br>gone wrong but there are lots of reasons<br>for throwing out data but we maintained<br>that this was not a good idea for this<br>data and we had the following reasons<br>for this we thought the data was<br>probably significant for these reasons<br>we had seen these broad spikes in at<br>least three other types of experiments<br>so different cell types and in three<br>different labs around the world so these<br>broad spikes were not just you know<br>somebody turned something off or on at<br>the wrong time<br>um secondly from work of yet another PhD<br>student benaz Romani and and others we<br>know that the mathematical mechanism<br>underlying these broad space is quite<br>different from the mathematical<br>mechanism underlying narrow spikes and<br>we know that the corresponding<br>physiology is different as well so we<br>thought this data was important and we<br>asked Lloyd to to construct a model and<br>he's done it so the new model has been<br>constructed it captures the broad spikes<br>and as a result of this as a result of<br>knowing from our general theory that<br>there was probably something significant<br>We Now understand more about the<br>underlying physiology so this is the<br>process going backwards starting with<br>our sort of theoretical considerations<br>and then having something to say<br>something nice to say about the<br>physiology<br>so what have we learned from this group<br>okay so there are three things here<br>first of all experimental Dieter can<br>sometimes be explained by the<br>development simulation model so it's not<br>news to anybody that's science that's<br>what we do<br>um the second one is more about<br>dynamical systems so a detailed<br>investigation of the feature of a<br>particular model might tell us something<br>abstract that's interesting and<br>sometimes it works the other way so the<br>abstract information that we have can<br>sometimes help us better understand the<br>experimental data and the third bullet<br>point is particular to this particular<br>project I was telling you about ask<br>those experimentalists for all of their<br>data and the picture there is really<br>just to show you sometimes what it feels<br>like we've got a little bit of a niche<br>market and and finding out and sorting<br>through other people's rubbish and<br>seeing if we can find something useful<br>um so so the examples that I've given<br>you here are sort of you know that's the<br>sort of bread and butter of them have<br>medical dynamol assistance that's<br>roughly how it works I want to turn now<br>to a different kind of dynamical system<br>this is one where we've seen change on a<br>really really slow time scale but it's<br>one that's dear to my heart<br>and so This Is the participation of<br>women in mathematics<br>I have a captive audience I'm going to<br>speak my mind<br>um and so<br>um so a little bit about the my history<br>of moving into mathematics so when I was<br>at school I don't recall noticing or<br>caring very much about whether who was<br>doing this in science at school whether<br>it was boys or whether it was girls it<br>probably helped that I had three pretty<br>assertive sisters and that my father was<br>a maths teacher and I was taught by a<br>really good female mathem physics<br>teachers in the senior school so like<br>early came after the University of<br>Auckland to do obesity in nursing<br>physics in the 1980s<br>now when I got here I discovered there<br>were no women at the University of<br>Auckland in mass or physics with<br>permanent jobs none at all<br>early in the 80s physics hired a female<br>lecturer and she arrived in 1984 and<br>mass hired a female tutor I've seen you<br>tutor in about 1985. so that was<br>progress but I don't remember having a<br>single woman teach me in all my years of<br>doing mathematics and physics at the<br>University of Auckland or anywhere else<br>now it didn't particularly bother me it<br>has to be said and I had a pretty good<br>time as a student I did bail out of<br>maths after doing my BSC and I became a<br>physicist and I did a masters in<br>experimental Nuclear Physics with Paul<br>Barker in the aura 2 facility which used<br>to sit where building 303 s's for those<br>of you who know who know where that is<br>okay now those of you who are around in<br>New Zealand in the 1980s might remember<br>so this was not a good time to announce<br>that you were a nuclear physicist<br>physicist so as a consequence of this<br>and some other reasons I decided that<br>now is time to change track and I was<br>going to move into dynamical systems so<br>that's what I did and I went to<br>Cambridge to do a PhD in the department<br>of Applied medicine theoretical physics<br>um at that time there are about 65<br>students in the in that department and<br>of them four were women<br>that was all there were no female staff<br>with University appointments there were<br>a couple that had College appointments<br>they have kind of a weird system there<br>but again there was no teaching of<br>mathematics by women or very little<br>I remember feeling quite conspicuous I<br>remember going to conference with about<br>100 people and 97 of them were men and<br>there were two quite senior women and<br>then there was me<br>and so then I went to the University of<br>California Berkeley and um and there<br>they did have a female staff member but<br>they were also in the middle of a really<br>acrimonious court case with a female<br>staff member or former female staff<br>member who'd been denied a tenure so<br>this was a really tense place to be and<br>to be thinking about participation of<br>women in maths then I went to Caltech<br>and those of you who know Caltech know<br>that it's a it's a special place but one<br>of the reasons it's special is not<br>because it has good gender<br>representation<br>so then I returned to Auckland and the<br>year before I came to Auckland there<br>were 31 academic staff in the combined<br>medicine States Department of which two<br>were women so this was real progress<br>used to be none and now there were two<br>however in that year there were three<br>by contrast 2023 is looking good we've<br>got 43 academic staff in maths alone and<br>15 are women and applied most of these<br>more women than men and outstandingly<br>last year there were more Melissa's than<br>David's so things have really changed<br>they've really they've really moved on<br>but I was interested in thinking about<br>the numbers and and seeing how this had<br>come about so sometimes it feels like<br>there are just so many women in the<br>master Department every time you turn<br>around there's another woman and so I<br>was interested in seeing whether there'd<br>been sudden growth or whether it had<br>been slow or whatever and so I got at<br>the University calendars and I looked up<br>the data and I bought it here for you<br>so this is the um oh just a caveat this<br>comes from the from the University<br>calendar and so when somebody arrives at<br>the University it can take a year for<br>them to appear on the calendar so you<br>know apart from that<br>um you don't we don't need to worry<br>about there's one other carrier I<br>suppose and that goes back to the letter<br>to Eamonn that I had at the beginning<br>about how world-class mathematicians can<br>count really large numbers of that<br>getting lost I failed that test I found<br>counting up to 40 really challenging<br>because I kept seeing names of people<br>that I'd forgotten about so you can read<br>that how you like but anyway what does<br>the data say the blue bars show the<br>number of academic staff and in<br>mathematics at the University of<br>Auckland over a number of years and the<br>red bars show the the women's stuff<br>um and so early in the 90s we had about<br>15 women in 2005 it's about 20 and from<br>2010 to 2020 it's kind of 30 to 35<br>percent so that's steady progress but<br>it's slow but if you extrapolate from<br>this and it looks pretty flat<br>so you know maybe it's never going to<br>get any better maybe we reached a steady<br>state now along the bottom I've made<br>some significant first so the first<br>lecturer was appointed in 1992 the first<br>senior lecture in 1999 the first<br>Professor appears in the calendar in<br>2012 hinker was actually appointed 2011<br>I believe but it took her a while to<br>arrive in the calendar and then the<br>first associate professor at 2014. so<br>it's really nice to see these stage<br>these these changes but it's staggering<br>to me that it took so long to hire and<br>then promote women in mathematics<br>there you go so the numbers are a head<br>count and it's really a rather crude<br>measure of what's going on but you can<br>get more neurons data if you have a look<br>so I compared 2010 with 2023. there's<br>the same number of women in both years<br>there's roughly the same number I mean I<br>think it's 26 in one year 28 on the<br>other and there we see some real<br>differences<br>so in 2010 half of the women or almost<br>half of the women in the department were<br>in teaching only positions and slightly<br>more than half were in research<br>positions that required research as<br>opposed to the men where there were 85<br>percent of the men were in these<br>positions that required research in 2023<br>it's moved so now we have three quarters<br>of the women doing research and um and<br>90 of the men but the really significant<br>change comes with when we look at the<br>seniority of the women so in 2010<br>precisely none of the women were at<br>remember there's 15 precisely none of<br>them were associate professor or<br>professor and there never had been any<br>it's not like they disappeared there had<br>never had been any in the department<br>whereas 45 of the men in the research<br>required positions were at those levels<br>in 2023 45 of the women and 56 of the<br>men are in those senior positions so<br>that's a really big change and over the<br>same time there will be similar changes<br>in the seniority of the women in the<br>teaching only positions and the men but<br>that data was not stored in the calendar<br>so I I don't have it<br>okay what else has been going on in that<br>time well there's quite a few people in<br>the audience that will recognize these<br>photos so this is what clear possible<br>likes to call hashtag wimps so this is<br>the women in the mathematical and<br>physical sciences and it's a<br>um it's a the pictures are actually of a<br>conference that we run but it's the<br>community of academic staff women in<br>these areas and the the Genesis of this<br>or the start of this is stutter Marston<br>conda who might be surprised but in 2006<br>he was leading the center for search<br>Excellence the New Zealand Institute of<br>medicine is application lesson suggested<br>that to a small group of us that we<br>might organize a conference for women in<br>mathematics and statistics and I can<br>remember at the time feeling really<br>quite grumpy about this actually I just<br>thought this was mad there were so few<br>women I thought we could just get in the<br>car and go for a long drive and we<br>didn't need to organize this conference<br>because we could have our conversations<br>in the car drive but we set about doing<br>what we were supposed to do and we<br>rounded up all of the PhD students in<br>postdocs and academic staff we could<br>find in New Zealand in maths and states<br>and there were less than 30 of them I<br>think and we organized the first<br>conference and it was great and we've<br>had 11 since then<br>um<br>um and and it was a great success so<br>um the photos here show you um some<br>activities that um that we've regularly<br>run at these at these workshops that we<br>have here we're looking very formal it<br>must be the first day because we're all<br>still in very straight lines and there's<br>some kind of activity going on I think<br>it's actually the welcome session but<br>there will often be a two-hour session<br>on something or other that people are<br>interested in this activity here is the<br>most popular one that we run we run it<br>every year and it's a sort of strategic<br>planning one where people think about<br>what their goals are over the next three<br>years and then in pairs they they put in<br>the little steps that are needed to get<br>them to those goals and then here is the<br>really important networking that we do<br>at lunchtime or morning tea time in the<br>beautiful surroundings at Thornton Park<br>so this is the slide for the sponsors<br>there's a less formal side to the<br>workshops as well and you might be able<br>to spot your favorite mathematician here<br>I'll give you a clue this one's Julian<br>Novak<br>some of you will know she was yeah and<br>this one I like particularly because on<br>the right here is Estrada and her first<br>that was the first ever professor of<br>mathematics in New Zealand and she's<br>involved in some role play I guess but<br>next to her is Marie Graff and if you<br>can see it on her knee as a small child<br>so this is quite a common feature of<br>these meetings somebody will have some<br>Child Care issue and they just bring the<br>child along and we accommodate them and<br>feature them in our skirts so the point<br>about these workshops is that they've<br>provided an environment for women to be<br>mentored and supported and to strategize<br>about ways forward particularly when<br>they've become a bit stuck and the<br>community that's fostered in these<br>annual meetings leaks over into the rest<br>of the year in a really nice way so I<br>don't think it's a complete coincidence<br>we don't have the data but I don't think<br>it's a complete coincidence that we've<br>seen substantial benefits in terms of<br>career development and success for the<br>participants in these workshops over the<br>years that we've been running them<br>so where are we now<br>we've got some positives and we've still<br>got some work to do so the positives<br>there's been a steady growth in the<br>number and seniority women academic<br>staff and maths at the University of<br>Auckland so that's really really good to<br>see<br>um a big part of this has probably been<br>the parental leave policies which have<br>really improved marketing now not<br>everybody's interested in Parental lead<br>not everybody has kids or likes kids but<br>for those that do have small kids the<br>change in the parental leave policies<br>over the last 25 years have been really<br>important for allowing them to keep<br>their careers going at the same time as<br>raising their young families and that<br>applies to men as well as women and<br>thirdly there's been some pretty good<br>institutional support for some of the<br>initiatives like the von pack meeting<br>that we run so thank you for everybody<br>that's made that possible however<br>progress is really uneven so<br>participation of women students is still<br>pretty low I just finished teaching a<br>post-grade course in dynamical systems<br>and there was not a single woman in my<br>class and that's not unusual for maths<br>classes at the senior levels so we've<br>clearly got something where we haven't<br>got it right yet we need to do some more<br>work there<br>secondly participation is much lower<br>elsewhere in New Zealand so there are<br>some universities that have similar<br>levels maybe 30 35 women but there are<br>some that are on 10 or in some years<br>struggle to have even one woman in their<br>in their Mass Department and it's also<br>lower in pure Mass compared with applied<br>medicine Mass education so this is<br>definitely more things that that need to<br>be done and finally just I just have to<br>put it out there harassment and sexism<br>in the workplace are not as uncommon as<br>they ought to be and so we all have work<br>to do there<br>so here is a challenge for you<br>the lack of diversity I think is still a<br>major problem<br>in a major issue for mathematics in<br>Auckland and in New Zealand and<br>elsewhere<br>and<br>um<br>I've talked a little bit about how<br>gender diversity is a has things have<br>changed on the gender front but there<br>are other areas where we really need to<br>to do more work so in particular I would<br>say that the participation by Maori and<br>Pacific peoples is really low in<br>mathematics and it needs to be increased<br>and I mean I'm not the person to be<br>advocating for this particularly but I<br>can see two reasons why this is really<br>really important one is that mathematics<br>and stem subjects more generally are<br>Gatekeepers for a very wide range of<br>rewarding and well-paid work and why we<br>exclude<br>intentionally or not why we exclude a<br>large proportion of the population from<br>these activities then there's a social<br>justice issue there so we need to be<br>thinking about that and secondly I<br>believe the discipline would be enriched<br>be much better we'd have more diverse<br>voices and perspectives and access to a<br>whole lot more Talent if we allowed or<br>made it possible or encouraged a more<br>diverse set of people to join<br>so um<br>so we've got work to do all of us<br>okay I um I haven't talked very much<br>about my role in administrative parts of<br>the University but as John said that's<br>been a big part of my life for six years<br>at least and I know some of you are very<br>closely involved with University<br>Administration in various ways so I want<br>to leave you within with a final image<br>there was I said earlier that I don't<br>have photos of me doing mathematics when<br>I was a small child but I do have this<br>one photo of me getting ready for a life<br>and so here it is<br>so I you know this looks like three kids<br>it looks like we're well some of us are<br>having fun in the sun but I see this as<br>a perhaps a metaphors stretchy convert<br>maybe a metal made of water some of the<br>complex relationships that develop in<br>universities so this child here has had<br>a great idea a brilliant idea and it's<br>busy in acting this idea<br>and this person here thinks it's<br>probably a pretty good idea it's<br>certainly funny and is encouraging and<br>this person here is thinking really is<br>that your idea of a good idea are we<br>really doing this and so each of you<br>will have your own ideas about how this<br>metaphor might apply to your particular<br>part of the University you know it could<br>be somebody's brilliant idea about<br>reorganizing the curriculum or<br>reorganizing your favorite academic unit<br>or service division or whatever it is so<br>no good lecture is complete without some<br>homework and my homework for you is to<br>think about how this metaphor might<br>apply to your situation in the<br>university and I see far too many people<br>nodding<br>um and then the last little bit about<br>this this picture that is not evident<br>from this is what you can't see which is<br>the photo was a setup I felt really<br>ripped off when I found out this many<br>years later so apparently my father had<br>seen the situation develop had rushed<br>inside to get his camera had come back<br>out and persuaded the two older children<br>to torment the younger one again so they<br>could catch it on fire now I can't see<br>any analog in the university for my<br>father's role here but maybe you can<br>okay so I want to wrap it up there<br>um and just say thanks to a few people<br>um so first of all many colleagues and<br>students have been fantastic far too<br>many to name<br>um everybody but I do want to pick out<br>one person in particular and that's<br>James Snead who couldn't be here tonight<br>and he has been a<br>um I would say an entertaining and<br>generous colleague over for informed and<br>a friend for more than 20 years so we've<br>taught courses together we've jointly<br>supervised many students we've written<br>papers in a book and we've had Grant<br>applications but the most important<br>thing is we've had many many cups of tea<br>and solved the problems of the universe<br>and the university over those Cups of<br>Tea so thank you to James and then I<br>want to thank particularly the the wimps<br>who have out enforced tonight here so<br>this is the women in mathematical and<br>physical science is that Community<br>that's been really good at supporting<br>each other and I've valued their<br>friendship and companionship over the<br>years and and then lastly I haven't<br>talked about my role in the doctoral<br>programs but one of the Privileges of<br>the last six years has been working with<br>people from across the faculty and<br>across the university<br>um to to grow the doctoral programs and<br>I found it really quite humbling how<br>much work people put into that and how<br>compassionate they are and empathetic<br>and working with their students so thank<br>you to all those people particularly the<br>doctoral advisors for their for their<br>work there last of all thank you thank<br>you all for tuning out tonight and I<br>hope you found something of Interest or<br>foreign</p></main><footer style="margin-top: 2rem;
