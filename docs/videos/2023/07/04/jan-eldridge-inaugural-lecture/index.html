hosking I'm dean of<br>science here at the University of<br>Auckland by papatoeto mataro it's my<br>very great pleasure to both welcome you<br>here to the university and to the<br>inaugural lecturer of Professor Jan<br>Aldridge<br>Jan is someone who never quite got over<br>the childhood fascination of the night<br>sky<br>however unlike most of us she turned<br>that passion into a career becoming a<br>highly respected astrophysicist<br>another Fascination she has retained as<br>you might have seen is science fiction<br>particularly Doctor Who with her Zoom<br>background featuring the inside of the<br>TARDIS and her promotion application<br>being introduced with a quote from the<br>good doctor I'm sure her biggest<br>struggle last weekend was to fit in both<br>the Royal Astronomical Society of New<br>Jan's research interests are binary<br>Stars pairs of stars that rotate around<br>each other and as she puts it sometimes<br>get in each other's way<br>when they do it creates some of the<br>largest explosions seen in the universe<br>Jan's Forte is to be able to predict the<br>evolution of every detail of a stellar<br>population from the evolution of an<br>individual star up to modeling galaxies<br>like our own to those at the edge of the<br>observable universe<br>this is done by using software she and<br>her colleague Elizabeth stanway have<br>developed called be pass for binary<br>population and spectral synthesis<br>software unique and including<br>interacting binary stars now used by<br>pretty much everyone working in this<br>domain<br>she's also an active astronomer looking<br>to support and further develop the<br>predictions her software makes through<br>observations<br>her work officers of the Hubble and<br>James Webb telescopes we're working from<br>home is mandatory not optional<br>Jan is also a dedicated educator having<br>taken a major role in developing<br>teaching of astrophysics here at<br>Auckland as well as having a hand in<br>readability redeveloping the physics<br>undergraduate curriculum<br>which is currently the academic head of<br>physics leading a strong and vibrant<br>Department<br>Chan studied Natural Sciences at<br>Cambridge before completing a PhD in<br>astrophysics at cambridge's Institute of<br>astronomy<br>postdocs and Paris Belfast and Cambridge<br>followed before we were lucky enough to<br>lure her here to Auckland as a lecturer<br>Janice transgender providing highly<br>visible leadership for others and<br>differently gendered communities<br>tonight Jan is going to tell us about<br>exploding binaries both stars and<br>Kira kotokato everyone haremain welcome<br>very much to um as John said my novel<br>talk and thank you John for those very<br>kind words I can now skip my first few<br>slides because I don't have to introduce<br>myself I of course always do but I do<br>then so yeah this is kind of interesting<br>because already on my slide I've got a<br>binary star and you might look at it and<br>you think it's only one star but when<br>you actually look closely most stars in<br>our galaxy and in fact in the universe<br>are binary stars and that's some of what<br>I'm going to be talking about tonight<br>um so as John said Professor Jen<br>Eldridge my pronouns are she her or them<br>they<br>um I'm an astrophysicist which just<br>means I do physics trying to understand<br>how the universe really works using<br>stars because it's their wonderful<br>experimental places that we didn't have<br>to build we can just study them and I<br>study exploding binary Stars while<br>exploding the myth of a gender binary<br>which is interesting because tonight I'm<br>nervous about this talk because it's the<br>first time I'm actually merging these<br>two things together into a single talk<br>I've talked about gender diversity and<br>including rainbow students I've talked<br>about exploding binary Styles but trying<br>to merge them together into one talk is<br>kind of an interesting thing so we'll<br>see how it goes<br>um it's an experiment I'm a scientist<br>right<br>so um and first off though we're going<br>to just introduce you know what's it<br>mean to be a professor what was my path<br>to being a professor then I'll get onto<br>the exploding binaries<br>um<br>and here is the one-year-old me in<br>rather fetching like red dungarees no<br>wonder I like the color red and you can<br>already tell that I'm a bottom Shuffle<br>and so how did this one-year-old become<br>a professor at the University of<br>Auckland and John's already told you<br>some of the story<br>um but the main thing is when I was<br>young I read far too much science<br>fiction and so we're talking about<br>things like Arthur C Clarke Isaac Asimov<br>and more recently people like Ursula<br>Guin and leki<br>because you know science is science<br>fiction is exciting you get to explore<br>the universe and go all around it and um<br>nowhere more in your academic career do<br>you become like Doctor Who when you're a<br>professor because you get to explore the<br>universe and unlock its secrets you then<br>get to also you know take people with<br>you as you show them how exciting the<br>universe is<br>and then you know you also get to try<br>and actually make it better<br>right<br>there's been problem with the<br>microphones don't worry so we've had to<br>get them fixed it's one of those things<br>you know and this is what happens when<br>you're a lecturer you just have to deal<br>with things going wrong you know a good<br>lecture it's it's you can have all the<br>plans planned out but when things go<br>wrong it's how you deal with them anyway<br>yeah so Doctor Who you know make things<br>better explore the universe<br>and uh yeah take people with you so this<br>inspired me in some ways because I love<br>the universe and actually when you see<br>it in science fiction especially in Star<br>Trek next Generation when I was growing<br>up it's like how you're trying to<br>understand and solve problems using<br>science to explore the universe<br>the other thing that's unusual about my<br>career path is actually not that unusual<br>today<br>so these are my first two computers the<br>ZX Spectrum 48k 48 kilobytes let's all<br>get excited right that's a thousand<br>characters 48 000 characters the program<br>the computer could store when we're at<br>petabytes today which is<br>um millions billions of bytes is how<br>much we sort of randomly think that's<br>how much YouTube stores on its servers<br>like tens of those kind of bites<br>and the amstrad CPC one through 828<br>so when I got the ZX Spectrum so our X<br>been Pro programming for 40 years<br>because you know these were none of<br>these nice graphical user interface<br>systems you had to program the second<br>you turned it on<br>and so as I've been going from my<br>academic career I've always liked<br>computers and this is why as my students<br>will tell you my coding looks ugly um<br>because I've been coding for so long and<br>I learned a basic<br>but it's given me an interesting set of<br>skills as I've gone through my career<br>which is the other reason I do numerical<br>astrophysics making computer models of<br>stars<br>Beyond this though it's also extremely<br>privileged to have like an extremely<br>supportive family they may not have<br>always understood what I was actually<br>doing when I was studying physics and<br>astrophysics but they've always been<br>there for me not just my mother and my<br>father my brother my sister but my<br>cousins aunts and uncle my grandparents<br>and um they they can't be here tonight<br>because they all live in the UK on the<br>other side of the world<br>but I just have to say you know that's<br>one of the reasons I'm here because they<br>were there to support me and actually<br>just go on the adventure because I was<br>the first in my family to go to<br>university which is quite<br>um was quite an experience and then also<br>when you think about it to then go to<br>the University of Cambridge in the UK<br>which is one of the Premier University<br>so it's a bit strange and all I really<br>knew about going to University was that<br>apparently students drank a lot<br>so you know there's a thing called<br>studying what's no sorry<br>um<br>but you know so you go to university you<br>do an undergraduate degree I very nearly<br>became a geologist but turns out I can't<br>write essays so I became a physicist<br>because maths and physics were more fun<br>um and one of the things for<br>undergraduates in the room is to note<br>that your friends that you're with for<br>undergraduates will last you forever<br>so um here we have uh Dave Matt Amber<br>Sandy Elizabeth and Maria and um you<br>know this every time I'm in the states<br>I'll pop in and I'll see Amber and Sandy<br>um because they're they're close enough<br>on the west coast we can all get to the<br>same place Elizabeth is my co-p primary<br>investigator on the b-pass project and<br>we still work together because we did<br>the phds in the same place<br>so your friends<br>um you need to be careful because you<br>um but also this group came together<br>because we worked together on our final<br>exam which was a general paper where we<br>could get asked anything on four years<br>of physics that we learned which is a<br>really scary exam so I'm never doing<br>that here all the students go yay<br>um but it was just like it's kind of<br>interesting to already form those groups<br>and those networks When I Was An<br>undergraduate but then when I went on to<br>do my PhD where here this is just I've<br>had my Viber so I'm extremely very happy<br>it is a lot much more lonely career I<br>still had like other students I talked<br>to and other people in our group but it<br>wasn't really that same sort of group<br>work that I had back when I was an<br>undergraduate but because I did get my<br>PhD and we got lots of other exciting<br>science done as John said I was able to<br>go to The Institute to astrophysic to<br>Paris apari for a year and then I went<br>to Queen's University Belfast for about<br>two years before being able to go back<br>and be a postdoc in Cambridge there is a<br>cat in this bottom right picture just<br>down here just down the bottom left<br>right if you can spot it<br>um<br>yes she was called new on which is kind<br>of right for an astronomy anyway we're<br>not having a departmental cat anyone<br>um I'm not feeding it that's why anyway<br>um but then yes as John said uh 12 years<br>ago now I was able to come to the<br>University of Auckland appointed as a<br>lecturer and so I've worked my way all<br>through the promotion boundaries to come<br>up being professor and a few months ago<br>John rang me when I was at a conference<br>in Melbourne<br>um to tell me the good news and it was<br>at a conference and I just had this<br>phone call and I had amazing news and I<br>wasn't there with my family so I<br>couldn't celebrate with them and I<br>couldn't tell anyone but I was able to<br>tell my students and so he went out for<br>a drink and so this is the other<br>celebration where now I'm the pi I can<br>take my students and we can celebrate<br>together and they it's actually<br>wonderful teaching this team because as<br>you can see we have a very large team<br>now in the b-pass project so you have<br>myself and Elizabeth as the pis the<br>primary investigators and then we've got<br>John Lin Heloise and Conor who are all<br>postdocs they're not all here somewhere<br>at the University of Warwick but then we<br>have our students down the bottom and<br>it's just one of the most things I most<br>love about being a lecturer is being<br>able to take students and teach them and<br>work with them and it's just a privilege<br>to teach these students and like see<br>them work together and it's like we get<br>so much done because somehow it's just a<br>nice team<br>um and yeah and so recently we've just<br>been joined down the Bottom by uh sure<br>I'm Erin and adip so they're still<br>studying with us but Max Petra Gareth<br>Sohan voucher and Shauna all close<br>hopefully to finish<br>um I look at Max going like look at the<br>clock away sorry I'm joking<br>but um so this is one leadership role I<br>do but as John said I've taken on<br>another leadership role and I couldn't<br>do this talk without talk mentioning my<br>colleagues in the physics department who<br>I now lead as the academic Department<br>ahead<br>and um<br>it's like going from being Doctor Who<br>with your students to being like Captain<br>Janeway in charge of the Voyager flying<br>around because it's a different level of<br>people<br>um you know but but we're not lost we<br>know exactly where we are in the galaxy<br>and we know exactly where we're going<br>um and it's a fantastic group of people<br>and um I could single out important<br>people who have helped me in my career<br>but the two people of course Richard<br>Eastern Nick rattenbury because we're<br>the three astronomers who have really<br>driven astronomy within the department<br>so that it's actually one of the<br>strongest programs today and also we<br>need to thank Sue and Citra today for<br>helping organize all the food and the<br>drinks<br>um and it's actually interesting when<br>you get into this leadership role of the<br>department you actually get exposed to<br>The Wider faculty team and you realize<br>there's so many wonderful people around<br>the university that actually help you do<br>awesome things and so thank you to all<br>of those people who are here because<br>I've seen you I'm going like oh they<br>will come<br>and this is why I'm nervous<br>okay<br>hopefully I've named everyone and<br>thanked everyone<br>if I've gotten someone I'm sorry your<br>specialty which is what the doctor who<br>says we're all special at some time<br>okay let's start with looking at<br>exploding binary stars and so far I'm<br>doing quite well for time and this is<br>kind of like why would you not want to<br>study stylus to explode right because<br>it's fun<br>but let's start by looking at some stars<br>and the nearest star which is something<br>to think about which is our sun<br>and you know sometimes we forget that<br>the sun is our star and you know um the<br>which is you know again it's just a nice<br>name to indicate this thing that is in<br>all of our lives and we sometimes ignore<br>it it was great to actually see it for<br>the first time in weeks today<br>but um so thank you son for coming<br>um but when you take it apart as an<br>astrophysicist you can take it apart you<br>can look down inside because we can look<br>at the surface now and we can actually<br>see sound waves or sun Quakes going over<br>the surface and we can peer into the<br>interior we can detect particles called<br>neutrinos coming from the very core<br>when the energy production is being<br>produced by nuclear fusion<br>and so in the core of the star if it was<br>just being if the sun was just being<br>powered by gravitational collapse it<br>would have a 20 million year lifetime<br>sorry<br>but because<br>um we know the Earth is four and a half<br>billion years old and it has to be<br>another energy source and so we know the<br>energy source for the sun is nuclear<br>fusion and in fact it's taking this is<br>where I like the fact that the chemists<br>use this lecture theater because now I<br>can point out the periodic table you<br>know we've got hydrogen in the top left<br>hand corner which is the simplest<br>element and when the universe was born<br>there was about 75<br>hydrogen and about 25 helium which is on<br>the other side because unfortunately we<br>didn't place the things wide enough that<br>you can<br>anyway<br>but yeah so the sun is taking four<br>hydrogen atoms or protons squeezing them<br>together to form helium and that<br>releases a tremendous amount of energy<br>nuclear fusion making heavier elements<br>from Light Elements gets more energy<br>than any chemical reaction like millions<br>of times more energy than you get from a<br>simple chemical reaction like when you<br>eat a snack or drink a glass of wine<br>right so you know if you could have a<br>nuclear fuel drink that would be out<br>powerful powerful<br>um<br>but in that reaction you release<br>neutrinos and there's about 100 million<br>neutrinos going through my very nice<br>fingernail right now<br>there's 100 million neutrinos every<br>second going through all your<br>fingernails and all your bodies and we<br>don't feel them they're ghostly<br>particles and they're extremely<br>difficult to actually<br>um to interact with<br>and so I'm actually introducing that<br>because we'll come back to how neutrinos<br>because eventually it will burn up all<br>up or its hydrogen to helium and it will<br>have a helium core in the center where<br>it's all pure helium it's not going to<br>be like helium blooms it's something at<br>the moment it's about 10 or 20 million<br>degrees Celsius so it's really hot it's<br>100 times denser than water and it'll be<br>even hotter and denser by the time it's<br>converted all that hydrogen to helium in<br>the core<br>and at that point something interesting<br>happens and so the sun will experience<br>in about five to six billion years time<br>a retrogigantism which is a great word<br>to spell right and so try and look it up<br>and you can use it in Scrabble and then<br>when somebody goes like what does<br>erythrogigantism mean it means the star<br>will become big and red and it will look<br>like this<br>now this is one of the very few images<br>of another star where we can resolve<br>surface details where you can actually<br>see hot spots and cool spots and it's<br>Antares which you can see in the night<br>sky or rehua and it's a red giant it's<br>actually a red supergiant because it's<br>that much bigger than a normal red giant<br>how big are stars well let's think about<br>how big the Earth is it takes 24 hours<br>to fly from pole to pole on a 777 on the<br>Earth<br>to play fly fly pole to pole on the sun<br>it takes a hundred days<br>on this star it's the size of the solar<br>system it's a thousand times bigger than<br>the Sun and so that's a hundred thousand<br>days to fly pole to pole or 275 years<br>these stars get big so yes the Earth is<br>doomed<br>but what's also happening at this time<br>is that helium core why the outer side<br>of the star has got big the inner core<br>is shrunk down and it's heated up and<br>it's heated up to 100 million degrees<br>Celsius and at this temperature we can<br>take the helium nuclei and smash them<br>together<br>quickly they'll go let's check the<br>periodic table if we take two heliums<br>together that's four so we get to eight<br>and so surely uh we must get oh hang on<br>let's look<br>it's oh it's brilliant yep yep so if we<br>take two helium together we get two<br>beryllium unfortunately when you stick<br>two heliums together to form brilliant<br>it's not stable it needs an extra proton<br>so it falls apart again oh<br>but they stick together for a fraction<br>of a nanosecond<br>and that's enough time when the<br>temperature is at 100 million degrees<br>Celsius for an extra helium nucleus can<br>come along and stick together<br>ah now they all go right so that's like<br>going to be six which is carbon<br>and they all suddenly go like whoa<br>because we're carbon-based life forms<br>so when a star is a red giant it's<br>actually mostly fusing helium to carbon<br>and when it's built up enough carbon you<br>can actually add an extra helium nucleus<br>onto that and you get oxygen oh<br>right stars make the elements for Life<br>way back 13.8 billion years ago the<br>universe was only hydrogen in helium<br>all the elements that we're made of in<br>this room that aren't hydrogen and<br>helium have come from Stars so we are<br>um so what will happen though is when<br>this<br>core has been produced and turned into<br>carbon and oxygen<br>all this surface material in the sun<br>will be actually thrown off and we get<br>things called planetary nebulae so here<br>you can see at the center the carbon<br>oxygen what we term white dwarf because<br>it's just a stellar Remnant it's the<br>ashes of the nuclear fusion of making<br>these heavier elements and that will<br>just cool down over the age of the<br>universe which is bad because all that<br>carbon oxygen is actually locked away<br>and it never comes out<br>all this other stuff though that's being<br>thrown off is rich in carbon and<br>nitrogen and again that's where the<br>elements in this phase where that<br>material comes out and then goes into<br>planets that then may evolve life forms<br>so stars like our sun have had to die<br>for us to have the carbon and nitrogen<br>now this is not the typical process for<br>both Stars<br>more massive stars can actually don't<br>stop at carbon oxygen Stars about eight<br>times the mass of the sun will go<br>further<br>and so if you go back to Antares I lie<br>this is not what the sun will become<br>this is what a massive star will become<br>something about 10 15 times the mass of<br>the Sun and it its Center<br>it's taking carbon and you know now we<br>play the jumping game on the periodic<br>table we go from carbon to neon neon to<br>oxygen and magnesium oxygen to silicon<br>and then there's a chain of reactions<br>all the way up to iron iron being the<br>most stable element in the universe<br>and so you can make energy by going from<br>Light Elements to heavy elements up to<br>iron and you can't go beyond that you've<br>got to put energy in<br>if you've heard of nuclear fission on<br>Earth where we take heavy elements like<br>uranium to make lighter elements that's<br>the opposite way but it's still taking<br>it towards iron where those are the most<br>stable elements and so you can't get<br>energy out when you get to iron<br>and so you run into a problem<br>because you have this core that's about<br>one and a half times the mass of the Sun<br>at the center of this star it can't<br>produce any more energy and so the only<br>thing it can do is collapse down and it<br>collapses down from something about the<br>size of the Earth<br>to something about 10 kilometers across<br>so that's like squeezing the sun down<br>into the Earth and then squeezing it<br>into Auckland<br>incredibly dense and it's basically just<br>one big giant nucleus of neutrons<br>and what happens when you do that you<br>release energy<br>you put you've actually taken all those<br>iron nuclei and you've got to release<br>more neutrinos<br>which actually release about as much<br>energy in a few seconds as the sun will<br>output in its entire 10 billion year<br>lifetime<br>yes that's a lot of energy<br>so those neutrinos which are going<br>through us right now actually interact<br>with the dense material around the star<br>and will explode the star but also<br>there's another way of getting energy<br>out<br>because when this star when this core of<br>iron collapses down it bounces off<br>itself and releases something else right<br>and what happens when something bounces<br>off something because it's a<br>gravitational energy that's being<br>released here right so I'm going to<br>demonstrate this by by translating<br>gravitational energy into something and<br>this is the energy that will actually<br>like explode stars as well as all those<br>neutrinos right you're ready this is<br>going to be it's not actually that<br>exciting<br>but I'll try my best right because I've<br>now got gravitational energy I've<br>climbed up on a chair<br>um I'm sure this is against health and<br>safety but<br>John close your eyes um and I'm going to<br>jump down and it will get translated to<br>some kind of other form of energy which<br>is actually what will explode the star<br>it's the same thing whereas I'm bouncing<br>off the floor the neutron star when it's<br>formed bounces off itself so we can<br>think right<br>there's a huge sound but actually the<br>ground would have got just slightly<br>hotter but it's that sound wave and that<br>heat that then gets thrown out into the<br>star and will destroy the red giant<br>leaving that neutron star at the core of<br>the star and actually if the star is big<br>enough it can even go further and form a<br>black hole now this is a stuff I was<br>doing for my thesis because it was<br>modeling those red giants because um<br>Steven smart had and Skyler Van Dyke had<br>done this really interesting<br>observational proposal where they<br>realized that in the early 2000s there<br>was enough of an archive in the Hubble<br>Space Telescope that you could actually<br>find when a star exploded which is in<br>the center here<br>the star before it exploded using<br>surveillance footage for example because<br>there was enough galaxies in the archive<br>and then you can actually go back later<br>and you can see the star is gone the<br>star has snuffed it it shuffled off its<br>Morton coil is an x-star it is no more<br>it's dead<br>okay<br>um all the young people I'm really sorry<br>that was a that was a joke for the old<br>people who remember Monty pythons<br>okay culturally mature people who<br>understood<br>but this is fantastic right this is<br>observational evidence that stars die<br>and it's red giants that explode<br>now these are both single Stars I've<br>talked about right which is okay but<br>let's look at a binary star let's look<br>at a binary star a kind of star that<br>would be a red giant but it's got<br>companion close to it<br>and so the star tries to become this big<br>red giant and of course it interacts<br>with the other star and the other<br>companion and that's when weird<br>happens<br>so this is the title slide and so if you<br>look in the optical this style looks<br>quite plain and boring it's just a very<br>bright nearby star it's probably<br>actually naked eye I'd have to check the<br>magnitude<br>but if you look in the infrared with the<br>James Webb Space Telescope I was really<br>lucky to be invited by Ryan Lau to go on<br>board and actually join his project<br>and this is Mission critical for gwst<br>this had to be launched to get these<br>observations of when these two stars<br>came really close together to be able to<br>um interact and the binary is actually<br>still too close to be resolved because<br>it's this blob but you can see what's<br>happened is the binary the two stars are<br>orbiting around each other and they're<br>eccentric so sometimes they're close to<br>each other and sometimes they're far<br>away and every eight years so that's the<br>period they come close together and<br>their winds Collide and they produce<br>these Blobs of dust carbon-rich dust<br>this is another source of the carbon in<br>your bodies coming from the binary Stars<br>and of course it then gets flung out<br>because everything's rotating and so<br>it's as if you're like throwing um<br>seed sowing seeds in a field and you're<br>throwing them out with your arm you get<br>these massive long dust shells<br>and so now I've said if they're<br>producing these rings every eight years<br>it's like a tree ring you can actually<br>work out what's going on on the star<br>over like hundreds of years as you count<br>those Rings back<br>and what's really exciting is we're<br>linking this to the dust that's produced<br>which is producing dust which could be<br>in some of the earliest galaxies because<br>you don't need<br>um<br>making dust and making all this carbon<br>material is easy in stars but it's a<br>problem getting it out into the universe<br>to form the Next Generation which is<br>which is tricky<br>so these are what happens with binary<br>Styles this is why they're exciting<br>because you get Evolution that's not<br>possible from the single star Evolution<br>you go away from your typical Red Giant<br>and this Evolution so basically every<br>massive star is in a binary and so this<br>is the most typical type of evolution we<br>expect for our massive stars that<br>explode in supernovae<br>so these are observations but what do I<br>do I I don't know what a telescope is<br>um I I have Observer friends who result<br>who reduce the data for me<br>um<br>but I make computer models<br>so I I like my stars actually look like<br>a bunch of numbers right that's all my<br>stars are and this is a great movie on<br>YouTube that's about 25 minutes long I'm<br>not showing the entire 25 minutes few<br>everyone goes but each one of these pair<br>of stars is one of the binary models<br>so making single star models is easy<br>because the only thing that determines<br>whether a star will become a white dwarf<br>or explode in a supernova is its initial<br>Mass<br>but if it's in a binary style system you<br>need to worry about the mass of its<br>companion and also it's orbit because if<br>they're close together they're going to<br>interact much earlier in their lifetime<br>than if it's actually much later when<br>it's much wider and so we actually have<br>to make<br>at the current count it's about a<br>quarter of a million models with the<br>Next Generation we're coming up to make<br>because we know we need to improve<br>physics we're looking at millions of<br>models and it takes in fact if you had a<br>single computer calculating all these<br>models we're looking at thousands of<br>years to actually calculate them because<br>it takes too long so involving them in<br>detail and when you look at all these<br>things it's all quite funny oh when is<br>this one star it means it's merged the<br>red flashes mean supernovae<br>um the blue flashes though are where the<br>binary system has actually gone through<br>two supernovas took two Stellar deaths<br>and we've got two neutron stars or two<br>black holes spiraling in together and<br>they'll eventually merge and do<br>something interesting which I'll get<br>onto later<br>um so yeah this is also I should put<br>some subliminal messages into here right<br>to hypnotize you all do<br>but it's inherently complex but using<br>this is the key to then trying to<br>understand stars and galaxies and<br>everything else which is what we'll go<br>on to now<br>if I can remember which pointer I've got<br>to use it no stop no we're going to sit<br>here now for the next 20 minutes though<br>okay there we go<br>no there we go<br>so I've talked about looking at single<br>stars now we need to think about how we<br>actually understand Stars we see in the<br>Galaxy so most stars are not born on<br>their own in fact no Stars Are Born<br>completely on their own stars are born<br>in families<br>and so this in New Zealand is at least<br>the best known family of stars there is<br>which is<br>matariki good okay you've all passed the<br>uh<br>New Zealand citizenship test 101. um yes<br>it's Matty Ricky or the Pleiades or<br>Subaru depending on which culture right<br>because the stars are above all of us<br>they link our cultures together because<br>we're all intimately connected to the<br>sky not only do we use them for<br>navigation and time telling and<br>storytelling we also are literally made<br>of star stuff<br>but matariki we can look at all these<br>stars because we know they're all the<br>same age they're all about 100 million<br>years old and so actually when we look<br>at our models we can say okay we try and<br>find this the one time we can get all<br>the models matching all those stars with<br>the same age<br>and the thing is the brightest stars are<br>more massive than the less massive stars<br>so more massive stars are brighter that<br>also means they burn through their fuel<br>quicker so they die first and so in a<br>few million years the brightest star<br>here will die and then there'll be fewer<br>and fewer stars and the Pleiades will<br>get fainter and fainter as we go<br>so that's cool we can do that with just<br>one star cluster but we want to go one<br>better than that we want to actually<br>understand entire galaxies so this is<br>Galaxy NGC 449<br>three four four four nine it's important<br>these little details<br>um and I've been part of a HST project<br>which is led by Alina Sabe called the<br>gulp project the Galaxy ultraviolet<br>Legacy program<br>astronomers love our own acronyms<br>and you can see here there's all these<br>stars and with the data from the Hubble<br>Space Telescope we have the luminosities<br>and temperatures for about eight hundred<br>thousand stars in this galaxy<br>and several others and this is a<br>starburst Galaxy so there's a young<br>burst of star formation in the different<br>galaxies we've looked at they're<br>different ages and different types<br>so how can we use the Stars to<br>understand the Galaxy I've said this is<br>a starburst so it's got to be bursty<br>with stars it's got to be making lots of<br>stars and we can see that<br>so we can then go in and use our models<br>with each one of those Stars<br>and we can say Okay so this star is how<br>old and you can see here I've color<br>coded this and so this is using our<br>Stellar models to understand<br>observations which reveals something<br>about that Galaxy and you can see in the<br>blue those galaxies are very very very<br>young<br>about 10 million three million years old<br>and then you've got this main majority<br>of green stars which are about 30<br>million years old and then you've got<br>other Galaxy other stars around now when<br>you then look at the image you can see<br>that these younger big cluster here<br>which is about here you know there's<br>also this faint fuzzy red stuff around<br>which tells you something about that<br>Galaxy it's like this must be something<br>to do with star formation because<br>there's still dust and gas there where<br>stars are being formed today we can't<br>see inside because there's all gas and<br>dust in the way but though the youngest<br>stars are almost must be hidden but this<br>enables us to understand something about<br>how galaxies evolve<br>by using the Stars<br>okay<br>so that's a quick<br>introduction to how Stars evolve and uh<br>yes everything else to do with stars and<br>now I'm going to start sounding a little<br>bit like a conspiracy theorist because<br>we're going to use these to understand<br>other things so I've said we can<br>understand galaxies and I'm going to try<br>and now bring together all the different<br>things right and this is kind of where I<br>am in my career now that people think<br>I'm starting to sound a little crazy<br>because it's like everything's connected<br>because everything is made of stars<br>you know and I had to include at least<br>so these are other images of galaxies<br>from another different type of telescope<br>different type of observations<br>but these galaxies are all too distant<br>for us to be able to actually resolve<br>individual stars but we can resolve the<br>light from groups of stars and if you<br>remember back to the previous image<br>stars of similar Ages were clumped<br>together<br>so actually we can actually work out the<br>age distribution of this galaxy we can't<br>see an individual star but we can say<br>okay this family of stars are probably<br>of a certain age<br>we can then look in these galaxies and<br>note that we actually saw some Supernova<br>explode<br>so we didn't see the star that exploded<br>in these galaxies and we can't study it<br>because it exploded it's dead<br>but we can go back and you can say oh<br>what this like family of stars around<br>that object how old are they can that<br>tell us something about the star that<br>exploded and the answer is yes we can so<br>I'm going to show you a science plot now<br>which is to freak everyone out but it's<br>you don't have to worry too much about<br>this axis up here this is actually how<br>much oxygen the star has which is<br>something to do with like how many other<br>stars have died and how much of that<br>material has gone into those Stars so<br>Stars down the bottom here are actually<br>earlier generations of stars they've had<br>fewer processed elements from other<br>stars and things up the top are like our<br>sun when it's actually been quite a lot<br>of extra material from other dead stars<br>going into it<br>and even then it's only like a few<br>percent of stuff that isn't hydrogen and<br>helium<br>the the colors here red and blue don't<br>matter too much but the y x axis here is<br>the important one this is the age<br>when we go on the left from a million<br>years these aren't a log scale for those<br>of you who've done the maths if not but<br>this is about a million years three<br>million 10 million 30 million 100<br>million years old<br>and you can see most of the stars that<br>explode in these supernovies so like<br>when these Supernova you're releasing as<br>much energy in a few seconds as our sun<br>will do in its entire 10 billion in your<br>lifetime the dramatic events they're<br>forming neutron stars<br>um they're in a cluster<br>you don't have anything very young<br>younger than about 10 million years when<br>you don't have anything older than about<br>40 million years<br>and if we actually then put on those<br>lines saying okay what's the mass of<br>these Stars producing these things<br>exploding or not you see that only stars<br>above about seven and a half times the<br>mass of the Sun explode in supernovae<br>anything below that becomes a white<br>dwarf<br>and then above about 20 times the mass<br>of the Sun there's very few supernovae<br>very few stars are actually exploding in<br>Supernova and that's a mystery and we<br>still don't quite know what the answer<br>is but we're pretty sure what's<br>happening here is when we get a<br>supernova we form the neutron star it<br>collapses it has that sound wave and<br>explodes the star above that mass we<br>form black holes<br>and the problem of a black hole is that<br>when it goes into it the star goes with<br>it<br>and we don't see any explosion<br>and we're trying now to find the stars<br>that just go disappear and we've seen<br>one of them<br>so this may not actually happen and<br>sometimes when you produce black holes<br>you do expose the star so this is work<br>we're doing but then we're kind of stuck<br>because now we go well Jen if you can't<br>see something you can't work out what's<br>going on because they're black holes so<br>what do you do<br>well we're really lucky that we can now<br>learn about black holes<br>which goes back to those blue flashes in<br>the video<br>because if you have a binary star that<br>has forms two black holes the gravity is<br>so strong their orbit decays and they<br>spiral in together<br>and will eventually release<br>gravitational waves because they merge<br>into one super sized black hole<br>the only problem is you need one of<br>these things<br>which is a gravitational wave<br>Observatory so this is one of the ligo<br>gravitational wave observatories and<br>there's two in the United States ones in<br>a<br>foreign Everglades with like crocodiles<br>and the other ones near a nuclear waste<br>dump<br>and the reason is you don't want humans<br>nearby because the frequencies of two<br>black holes merging is about like the<br>same kind of frequency that I'm speaking<br>at right that kind same kind of pitch<br>and so when they spiral in this is on<br>the right<br>um the first track we saw of two black<br>holes about 30 Terms so much of the sun<br>spiraling in together and you get a<br>chirp something that kind of looks<br>sounds like a whoop<br>um I'm not joking you can actually<br>visualize these and you can go on<br>YouTube and you can listen to the videos<br>but it's more fun for me to go whoop<br>um<br>and you want two observatories because<br>it's like having two ears you can work<br>out what direction they come from but<br>from these signals we can work out what<br>the mass of the black holes are and you<br>know these things don't produce their<br>light they're black holes the gravity is<br>so strong light can't escape so we need<br>to study the gravitational waves when<br>they're merging and actually it's<br>amazing what the collaboration has done<br>because it's the most difficult<br>measurement there is in science today<br>back in before 2015 this is all we knew<br>about black hole masses we could see<br>some black holes in binaries that were<br>gobbling up their companion<br>and so we could actually see them not<br>from the black hole itself but because<br>it was being fed by the other star<br>that's where we are today so the<br>gravitational wave observatories has<br>given us 150 black coal masses because<br>you have two that merge and you get the<br>one that's resultant<br>and so we've got this huge amount of<br>extra information<br>what can we do as a theorist well<br>there's there's black holes they've got<br>different masses we can weigh them and<br>look at the population and predict what<br>the population is doing<br>and we can do that with the same models<br>we understand galaxies and supernovae<br>and everything else right this is where<br>I start linking things together<br>conspiracy theory Style<br>and so you can see that this dashed line<br>is the observed distribution<br>there are issues here because it's it's<br>there are assumptions in that in that<br>distribution and you can see we kind of<br>get this peak that is about 35 times the<br>mass of the Sun but then there's this<br>problem that we're under predicting the<br>number of<br>um<br>black holes about 10 solar masses and<br>overpredicting the very light ones<br>the good news is ligo Virgo<br>collaboration is now on its fourth<br>observing run in the next year we'll<br>have a much better understanding if the<br>models are wrong of the observations are<br>wrong if the models are wrong it's great<br>I get to go and do new science and work<br>out what the difference is what physics<br>are we not including here do we need to<br>include<br>and of course this is work done by one<br>of my students so I'm not going to take<br>credit for it but it's kind of<br>interesting that we're trying to look at<br>all these things together<br>but can we go one better so if this is<br>from merging black holes<br>we don't see any light coming off those<br>so we actually have to worry about the<br>merging neutron stars which if you get<br>too Supernova in a binary and they merge<br>together we can actually see something<br>and we saw this and we detected it from<br>this galaxy<br>which is great because then you've got<br>the gravitational waves and the<br>electromagnetic light and so you've got<br>these two things that I've said are<br>quite separate and we can merge them<br>together to understand this one Galaxy<br>when we do that we discover something<br>interesting about these gravitational<br>wave events<br>they're coming from galaxies that appear<br>to be very very old billions of years<br>old tens of billions of years old but<br>the Galaxy sorry the universe is only<br>13.8 billion years old<br>so we're trying to actually measure<br>things across the cosmic history and<br>we're seeing them today<br>because now we have to actually think a<br>bit bigger right let's think really big<br>we can go back to the James Webb let's<br>not look at our galaxy let's look at the<br>edge of space so here this is the first<br>Deep Field image it took and everything<br>in this image apart from those things of<br>spikes are galaxies and if we zoom in we<br>can see near a faint fuzzy red blobs<br>they're galaxies somewhere between 10 to<br>30 well 10 to 12 billion years ago<br>and with the James Webb Space Telescope<br>we can zoom in we can see those galaxies<br>we can't resolve stars but we can spread<br>out the light to a spectrum<br>so we can try and understand the Stellar<br>population from looking at those<br>individual Stars<br>and this is actually Galaxy merger and<br>what we're finding is this links us back<br>to everything we're talking about<br>because the binary black holes we<br>observed are being made in galaxies like<br>this<br>they're pumping out photons which are<br>actually making the universe transparent<br>supernovae in these galaxies are making<br>the oxygen ion that we need for life<br>and there's dust being produced by those<br>binary Stars<br>and it's actually interesting stars in<br>these hybridged galaxies are explaining<br>everything we see in the universe around<br>us today<br>and they're all being explained by the<br>same models of stars that we use to<br>explain things like our sun and our own<br>little Galaxy<br>and that's kind of the link looping<br>backwards and forwards that we're<br>approaching now with all the<br>astrophysics we're studying today and<br>with the b-pass project we're able to<br>understand this because we're comparing<br>our models to all of this at the same<br>time<br>and we are finding problems but that's<br>exciting because we don't want to have<br>all the answers<br>okay<br>okay uh there is an exam later before<br>you leave<br>um<br>yeah<br>I mean I always like giving my talks<br>because I know there's a lot of<br>information but you know everyone's<br>going to get something different from it<br>at some different level and all I can<br>tell you right now is you're made of<br>Stardust and just it's a good thing we<br>don't have any black holes near us<br>because that would be bad<br>but let's go and look at binary gender<br>and so this is one reason why I'm a bit<br>nervous because it's also a personal<br>journey and it's you know I literally by<br>trying to work out who I am<br>have exploded the idea that binary is a<br>gender but this is not anything special<br>I do many people do this around the<br>world all the time<br>and you know so many of you have known<br>me for quite a long time and so this is<br>what I looked to look like<br>um fortunately I've now found a way of<br>hiding those gray hairs<br>without using a wig and you can see this<br>is an old talk when I was giving a talk<br>about the science fiction of gender<br>diversity or gender diversity in science<br>fiction back in Monash<br>I used to think I was gender fluid<br>non-binary somewhere in the middle using<br>them they pronouns but I've been on this<br>journey as I say because it's<br>complicated right I think we can all<br>agree I've just made it very complicated<br>how complicated the universe is and we<br>sometimes forget people are complicated<br>too we are naturally inherently a<br>complicated species<br>um and in and over time it's worthwhile<br>noting I mean if you really want to know<br>more about my journey and my story you<br>can just go to my Instagram feed right<br>and you can see that part of my journey<br>is actually trying to a work out what<br>hair color I like<br>but also like having really great nails<br>right and this is part of that journey<br>of just being able to try and work out<br>who I am and does this feel right<br>and it does and it's worthwhile noting<br>you know there's there's two people if<br>anyone's transitioning there's two<br>people you need to get on your site<br>right not just not just your doctor you<br>need to actually go and like find a<br>fantastic hairdresser so Katie's here<br>she can say thank you Katie for doing my<br>awesome hair today and um Francis who's<br>my beautician doesn't my nails<br>so together you know they're the two<br>most people that have helped me like<br>actually experiment and say this is the<br>way I want to look right and you know it<br>also gives me some great photos on<br>Instagram<br>um which is great yeah blonde is good<br>but you know it's just leaves a hair<br>terrible<br>so thank you Katie and Francis<br>right<br>actually think about what gender is now<br>this is a schematic representation<br>gender is hideously complicated and I'm<br>I'm not an expert but I'm gonna give you<br>some insight into maybe one way of<br>thinking about what gender is and a lot<br>of people think this is what gender is<br>right you have men and women tiny little<br>regions of just everyone's the same<br>right you know there's like one door or<br>the other you go through in the bathroom<br>right<br>but that's not true because we can see<br>that there is huge Variety in what is a<br>man and a woman right you don't actually<br>have to think too much about that so you<br>can make those spheres bigger and then<br>you can think well but even then it's<br>not really a two-dimensional right there<br>again even more ways of defining what a<br>man and a woman are and so you can try<br>and start treating them as<br>three-dimensional objects oh it looks a<br>but then we known as first genders and<br>non-binary people and so naively you<br>might expect to just link them and say<br>oh you're somewhere on this spectrum<br>between male and female<br>but then even that it's not just this<br>one-dimensional thing even then there's<br>structure inside between those two<br>extremes<br>but even that's not simple because then<br>you actually can think well beyond male<br>and female you can be masculine and<br>feminine but still in the other gender<br>and actually this is where it gets<br>complicated because you can see I've<br>already broken down my assumption<br>because it's not like you exist in one<br>place in this space right you can be a<br>cloud of behavior right or you can move<br>with time sometimes rapidly sometimes<br>slowly<br>and then maybe it's actually a Continuum<br>between them and then maybe you've got<br>to add in all the other genders because<br>I always talk about how you know people<br>are n-dimensional objects what do I mean<br>by that well you know we can think maybe<br>there's one dimension of going male to<br>female but then someone else can have<br>another understanding of gender and go<br>off in another Direction and then<br>another and another so whichever ways<br>you think how you interact with gender<br>and there will always be someone else<br>who interacts in a different way<br>and that makes us inherently complex<br>which I've tried to indicate here of<br>these colors<br>but the best way of actually<br>understanding it is something like this<br>with the uh the gender unicorn<br>yep<br>um yeah do you know which country has<br>the national animal of the Unicorn<br>anyone<br>Scotland yes sorry Tim they beat you to<br>it Scotland yes um<br>and so you can break down a person in<br>this way and so it's not like somewhere<br>in space you can think that you've got<br>these different parameters right you've<br>got your femininity your masculinity for<br>your gender expression your gender<br>identity which is what's on the inside<br>physical attraction is another thing we<br>can leave that outside of the discussion<br>for the moment but it is just as<br>important<br>um but then we've also got sex assigned<br>at Birth which is here a bit interesting<br>because they've split it down into just<br>female male and lumped all the other and<br>intersex connections together because<br>your sex your gender is how you interact<br>with people that's simplified let's not<br>get into the argument but your sex is<br>basically your reproductive capability<br>right and that's judged by when you're<br>born the doctor goes in five seconds boy<br>girl or we need to think about this<br>and um I mean sorry I shouldn't make it<br>so so intersex conditions are serious<br>right and um when you actually think<br>this is a great slide from um Scientific<br>American that shows us how complicated<br>we are<br>because<br>chromosomally normal female is on the<br>left chromosomally normal males on the<br>right and in the middle is all those<br>intersex conditions and we literally do<br>not know the exact number of people who<br>are intersex because when you're at the<br>edges of here you would still be<br>classified within the binary Sexes but<br>in the middle there's this huge range of<br>behavior that can actually lead to some<br>quite significant problems<br>and actually it's a wonder how our<br>biological systems being this<br>complicated actually leave 98 of us are<br>either end and put the other few percent<br>in the middle<br>um even sex is a spectrum even though we<br>lump everyone in the middle into this<br>intersex condition now I'm not into sex<br>as far as I know very few people do<br>right because we don't go and test out<br>chromosomes every Tuesday<br>um<br>but it's interesting and so this is<br>something that I I realized this morning<br>while producing this talk<br>when you're looking at the stars and the<br>universe<br>you know you know it's wonderfully<br>complicated and we're all made of<br>Stardust right<br>and because we're made of Stardust you<br>can realize that as Carl Sagan said we<br>are a way for the universe to know<br>ourselves know itself<br>right because we evolved after 13.8<br>billion years to try and understand it<br>the funny thing is we're parts of the<br>universe too<br>and so actually we need to try and<br>understand ourselves and actually all of<br>this talking about how sex is<br>complicated how gender is complicated<br>we're actually trying to understand<br>ourselves<br>and if you ignore some of the latest<br>research which unfortunately many people<br>do around the world especially people in<br>power<br>you're actually almost as bad as flat<br>earthers right because you're ignoring<br>the scientific and the medical evidence<br>that says gender identity is real and we<br>understand the biology of our systems<br>well that's a bit heavy I'm sorry<br>but you know it's it's at that level<br>where we are today it's quite scary to<br>be a trans person in the world can I<br>help you understand what it's like being<br>a trans person or gender diverse person<br>at the moment well yes I can do my<br>thought experiments with Star Trek<br>Star Trek so this is there's some really<br>good episodes um I have a much longer<br>talk where I look at many different<br>episodes and also where I look at things<br>like left hand of darkness by Ursula<br>Guin ancillary Justice by Anne Leckie<br>it's great whenever I actually do this<br>talk which I haven't done in a while<br>people recommend more books it's like<br>yes it's great<br>um but here the Enterprise goes to a<br>planet with the species called the Janai<br>who have evolved Beyond gender and so<br>everyone is androgynous except for a few<br>percent of people who want to still have<br>male female identities and they pursue<br>relationships and so Riker<br>Riker<br>when do you always get into these<br>situations and ends up having a<br>relationship with Sauron who wants to be<br>female and um of course at the end they<br>she gets found out and then she<br>undergoes conversion therapy effectively<br>to become androgynous skin<br>now this is actually quite scary right<br>because this is basically our society<br>through a mirror whereas today most<br>people have male female identities 98 99<br>of people and one percent are<br>androgynous or some other complex gender<br>diverse people<br>and so if you place yourself in this<br>Society where if you're discovered that<br>you're male or female you'll get<br>converted into being androgynous that's<br>a scary thought<br>but that's kind of where trans people<br>see the world is going especially some<br>countries at the moment<br>so it's always nice to think about this<br>it's also interesting to note that<br>Jonathan Frakes has pointed out that he<br>thinks Soren should have been played by<br>a man but then this was written in 90s<br>in America so yeah that was too far<br>so Jan you're going what can we do um to<br>help or like you know what's the best<br>way of dealing for Trans people and so<br>you be like Klingons<br>right now klingon's no honor<br>when they know about it and actually in<br>Deep Space Nine you could go on about<br>Jadzia Dax and gender diversity for a<br>long time because the true or<br>interesting there's these little<br>symbiote slugs that sit inside their<br>stomach and get passed from host to host<br>so the host dies and the slug comes out<br>and you get it put into a new person<br>and so uh Jadzia Dax used to be Curzon<br>Dax who was a man and Curzon had some<br>good buddies who who had some good<br>buddies who was Klingons<br>and you know they would do what Klingons<br>do fighting drinking and other things<br>and um Jadzia finds her friend Cole<br>who's a Klingon in the brig and goes<br>along and explains look I'm Dax and uh<br>call goes so what do I do and Dax goes<br>did how about give me a great big hug<br>and so call goes ah goes on my beloved<br>old friend<br>and uh tax goes well I'm Jazzy you know<br>now cool being a good trans Ally<br>realizes what he has to do<br>and so he switches to the new name and<br>correct pronouns and then gives gives<br>treats the friends just as they did<br>before and so it goes here my beloved<br>old friend and then they go off and have<br>adventures with fighting I can't<br>remember from his drinking there's some<br>Treasures it's a great episode right<br>and uh jazeer is interesting as in other<br>words and actually in the latest Star<br>Trek uh Discovery<br>um you know they've now got another true<br>character who's non-binary who's also<br>transgender and it's actually nice to<br>see that diversity that natural<br>diversity being shown in Star Trek and<br>Star Trek has always been woke<br>right and that's the thing that I didn't<br>realize when I was like six or seven<br>watching Star Trek and Doctor Who I<br>didn't realize I thought I was learning<br>about space but no I was learning how to<br>anyway<br>okay<br>um so yes just be like a Klingon be<br>honorable treat trans people the way you<br>do and you know if you need to have<br>conversation I mean so one of the<br>reasons I know I'm academic head and<br>I've been able to transition so smoothly<br>at work is because I guess some of my<br>colleagues have had words with each<br>other behind closed doors to make sure<br>people were nice to me and I thank them<br>I don't know if that's happened but<br>that's my assumption thank you<br>so um I'm toward the end of it now we<br>might have time for questions<br>um hopefully<br>um what's next right so hopefully I've<br>taken you a whirlwind tour of the<br>universe how exploding binary stars are<br>important I've told you a little bit<br>about my own Journey about gender and<br>trying to show that it is complex<br>because we are inherently complex beings<br>um but now I'm at stage I'm Professor<br>I'm academic head what do I do next and<br>I don't actually quite know<br>um so that's quite exciting to be at<br>because you know I've still got<br>hopefully touchwood<br>they're all going she's a scientist and<br>she's touching but she's superstitious<br>yeah well I'm human<br>what can I do<br>um so I don't know what I'm going to do<br>next and that's quite scary but also<br>interesting and also that's to do with<br>my own personal journey of my transition<br>where am I going to go next I don't know<br>I'm going to have great hair I can tell<br>you that much<br>um and so I'll finish with this almost<br>finish with this quote from Doctor Who<br>because it's a fantastic quote to try<br>and explain like how it feels like 80<br>transition but also to be at this time<br>when you know I could almost do anything<br>hopefully<br>and when 13th doctor came about and did<br>the speech so many people who are<br>transgender pointed out that it feels<br>this way because it feels sometimes that<br>right now I'm a stranger to myself<br>there's Echoes of who I was and a sort<br>of call towards who I am and I have to<br>hold my nerve and Trust all these new<br>instincts shape myself towards them I'll<br>be fine in the end hopefully but I have<br>to be because you guys need help not you<br>actual voice but I'm just saying<br>generally and if there's one thing I'm<br>certain of when people need help I never<br>refuse<br>so you know I don't know where I'm going<br>but it's going to be interesting I'm<br>also I know I'm extremely privileged<br>because I know I'm not on that Journey<br>alone I am very privileged to have a<br>wonderful partner and a wonderful<br>daughter who will help me explore the<br>universe and you know they're the most<br>wonderful pieces of Stardust I think of<br>there are in the universe I mean all of<br>you are pretty special but they are both<br>the most wonderful pieces of Stardust in<br>my life and it's kind of fun to know I<br>can go around explore the universe and<br>come back and spend my time with them<br>um because you know sometimes you do<br>need downtime and what's the point of<br>exploring if you have no one to share it<br>with<br>so yeah and I just like this picture<br>because it reminds me of the quote from<br>Lord of the Rings you know it's a<br>dangerous business photo going out your<br>door you never know when your feet might<br>take you and that's where we're going<br>into the future<br>so on that hopeful note I will take you<br>back to the binary style that will<br>explode one day so thank you very much<br>for listening I'd be more than welcome</p></main><footer style="margin-top: 2rem; background: #0001; padding: 2rem; text-align: center;"><p>We Are The University</p><ul style="list-style-type: none; padding: 0; margin: 0;"><li><a
