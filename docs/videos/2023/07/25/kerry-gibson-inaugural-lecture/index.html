Harry I'm the school<br>head of the School of Psychology welcome<br>to waipapato<br>the University of Auckland and to the<br>inaugural lecture of Professor Kerry<br>Gibson<br>as most of you will know the event was<br>originally scheduled for earlier in the<br>year but was abruptly postponed due to<br>torrential rain I am so delighted that<br>we've finally gathered and it's<br>wonderful to see such a great crowd here<br>the delay unfortunately has meant that<br>John hosking the dean of science is<br>unable to be here and do the<br>introduction so I'm going to read what<br>John had prepared for the original event<br>so Kerry as I'm sure you all know is a<br>clinical psychologist and a psychology<br>academic with an interest in the most<br>mysterious of things the minds of<br>teenagers<br>a primary focus of Kerry's work is youth<br>Mental Health<br>she set up the mirror project to capture<br>young people's experiences of mental<br>health and it's been called a Pioneer in<br>putting the voices and experience of<br>young people at the heart of mental<br>health research<br>her recent book what people want from<br>Mental Health Services was described as<br>a must read for anyone in the youth<br>mental health movement<br>this led to a large number of<br>invitations to present to collaborate to<br>advise and to influence policy and<br>practice<br>Kerry applied her school's skills in<br>this area to establish our own faculty<br>of science student postgraduate<br>wellbeing program when we had concerns<br>over the stresses of postgraduate study<br>as John says everybody is very grateful<br>to her for spearheading this valuable<br>work<br>Kerry has many other strings to her bow<br>with a considerable Corpus of work on<br>the risks and benefits to users of<br>antidepressants work on political<br>violence and Trauma in South Africa and<br>on sexual abuse and cults<br>the latter followed her experience<br>working with children who grew up at<br>Centerpoint and informed public debate<br>on the dangers of Cults leading to a<br>five-year stint on the trust supporting<br>former Centerpoint children<br>this is a Hallmark of Kerry's career not<br>only doing excellent research but also<br>getting involved and realizing her<br>another area where Kerry excels is<br>teaching<br>Kerry is a skilled teacher and<br>curriculum leader at aut she led the<br>development of the first professional<br>training program in counseling<br>psychology in New Zealand and has led<br>the clinical program here in a<br>three-year stint<br>her personal teaching is excellent and<br>has resulted in a faculty of science<br>Dean's award<br>her supervision is extraordinary<br>she supervised close to 50 doctoral<br>students to completion<br>Kerry began her career in South Africa<br>where she did a journalism degree at<br>Rhodes followed by an honors degree in<br>Psychology at Cape Town<br>several years later she did a master's<br>in Clinical Psychology and then a PhD in<br>Psychology at Cape Town and joined the<br>faculty there<br>she was lured to New Zealand in 2003 and<br>has worked at aut and Massey before<br>settling here at waipapatoma<br>she's been a key member of the School of<br>Psychology for the past 13 years<br>Kerry this is me speaking now<br>you are an incredibly valued member of<br>the school<br>you bring such sincerity and wisdom to<br>conversations and decision making<br>as Deputy head you helped lead our<br>response to the covert lockdowns<br>and with such careful and considered<br>attention to the well-being of our<br>students who were held by you throughout<br>thank you<br>tonight Kerry is going to talk to us<br>about what what young people can tell us<br>about the crisis and youth mental health<br>the floor is yours<br>except not quite because we're going to<br>people<br>foreign<br>foreign<br>well it's such a great beginning it can<br>only go down for me<br>thank you guys it was just gorgeous and<br>you're only supposed to make me cry at<br>the end<br>uh called Table Mountain te amonga core<br>Atlantic te Moana no kotirana tokupapa<br>Nori Africa tokomama ifanna Maya Africa<br>Tonga<br>um<br>um so I I am going to be talking about<br>youth mental health which is probably<br>why most of you are here given the sort<br>of blurb and so on but I did want to<br>start off saying a little bit about<br>myself and where I come from because I<br>guess as academics or clinicians we're<br>always sort of shaped by the places and<br>the people that we come from<br>um<br>so<br>I come from South Africa you probably<br>wouldn't have guessed from my accent I<br>don't believe I have any accent at all<br>but apparently other people do think I<br>have one<br>and I spoke in my pepe Harbor coming<br>from Cape Town which is a place that I<br>spent the longest time of my life<br>um not long because it was bad but was<br>just a long period of time<br>but actually I grew up in Johannesburg<br>and I I didn't put that in my paper<br>heart because it's actually actually a<br>lovely place and then Cape Town and and<br>I feel very strongly identified with<br>with Cape Town but joburg is also a kind<br>of a beautiful place in its own way it's<br>surrounded by gold mines and and all<br>sorts of you know old kind of toxic mind<br>dumps and so on<br>I'm not selling it I know but it also<br>you probably don't know is the largest<br>person made Forest Urban forest in the<br>whole world and it's full of trees right<br>across the city you see them of course<br>growing up in South Africa<br>um the beauty of the landscape wasn't<br>the major thing uh the major influence<br>impact of my life and for all of us who<br>grew up in South Africa in the 60s and<br>70s and 80s the defining future was<br>Apartheid and the horrors of apartheid I<br>was lucky enough to grow<br>in a in a fairly protected white suburb<br>um but apartheid also still continued to<br>touch my family quite deeply my mum had<br>come from<br>um slave and indentured labor ancestry<br>on the islands surrounding the coast of<br>Africa and under South African law she<br>was considered to be colored and<br>described as non-white she hid her birth<br>certificate her whole life with the<br>terror that she would be found out and<br>quite literally being found out in South<br>Africa to be not white would be to be<br>removed from the family and the place<br>that you lived and separated sometime<br>from your from your children<br>so apartheid I felt it there coming<br>through into my life as well my dad was<br>a very brave anti-apartheid newspaper<br>editor who fought the apartheid state<br>and challenged their census laws to try<br>and bring attention to the terrible<br>effects of apartheid and was frequently<br>harassed by Police and charged with all<br>sorts of things we was fired on in our<br>family our phone was tapped my father<br>used to put us on the phone as teenagers<br>to talk endlessly so that we would bore<br>um but it's to them I really owe a kind<br>of a commitment to social justice which<br>I hope has been a part of my work as a<br>psychologist<br>and now here are my my lovely people<br>sitting over there<br>um my husband Tom Fox and my son James<br>Fox sitting over there<br>um and they came with me to New Zealand<br>about 20 years ago now and that's my<br>favorite Beach over there and they're of<br>course are my favorite people sitting<br>under there<br>I'm very grateful to be here in this<br>beautiful country and although I'm very<br>committed to my home country I feel like<br>this places has been a home to me too<br>so I'm going to take you back a bit I<br>feel like a bit of a sort of back in the<br>old days but it is important for the way<br>that I become a psychologist when I did<br>my training in the 1980s<br>was at the University of Cape Town<br>and it coincided with a period of<br>intense political protests<br>that kind of ravaged the country or<br>wasn't the protest perhaps it were<br>ravaging the country and and rather more<br>the response of the state to the people<br>who were protesting I mean you've got a<br>little taste of it here in New Zealand<br>with the protests against the Springbok<br>tour in 1981 so thank you very much for<br>that<br>um we were very grateful and in South<br>Africa I was busy<br>um<br>in fact in terms of the the level of<br>State violence was was incredible<br>um between 1984 and I think it was 1990<br>over 8 500 people were killed by the<br>police in South Africa now those are not<br>armed armed soldiers those were<br>civilians in their streets and in their<br>schools and in their homes<br>um so I was becoming a clinical<br>psychologist sitting in a kind of Clinic<br>you know doing psychometric tests and<br>giving people therapy and<br>um while this was going on outside and<br>it was very visible the helicopters<br>would go over you know you hear them<br>overhead literally a few kilometers down<br>the road people were being shot I drove<br>through burning tires to get to work I<br>was beaten while I was you know walking<br>on a March<br>um visited by the police act at my place<br>of work<br>um so that it was really present this<br>kind of massive apartheid violence and<br>it sort of became very clear in that<br>time that you couldn't do Clinical<br>Psychology kind of sitting in a room<br>just working with this person in front<br>of you pretending that that stuff wasn't<br>happening outside and I like many others<br>in their period were kind of drawn to<br>play some part and to see if we could<br>change what Psychology was doing so that<br>it could be more relevant and helpful to<br>people<br>and my first job sometime was I worked<br>with some amazing people Leslie Swartz<br>from the University of Cape Town and<br>Chobani mandani who was the first black<br>psychologist in South Africa travesty<br>when you considered was the 1980s<br>already<br>um<br>and um my food first job was with<br>Giovanni mangoni working on something<br>called the political violence and Health<br>Resources project which was really a<br>kind of a research project but it was<br>also an activist project so we were<br>trying to support people who were<br>fighting against apartheid<br>and we were also trying to document as<br>well as we could the kind of political<br>violence that was happening at the time<br>and I learned many Essentials research<br>skills in including how to flee from the<br>police how to hide our our notes when so<br>when they're broken to officers they<br>wouldn't find them and how to breathe<br>during tear gas attacks I'm not sure<br>I've been able to use those Matson<br>simply<br>1990s an apartheid ended and we were all<br>very excited we felt that there would be<br>a whole new world for us and indeed<br>there was much of it was good but it's<br>also as the dust settled you had a sense<br>of the devastation that apartheid had<br>brought across the country the social<br>costs the economic costs and I was<br>working at the University Cape Town then<br>with Leslie Swartz um<br>trying to trying to see how we could<br>make psychology Clinical Psychology be<br>relevant for particularly for the black<br>communities who had suffered so much<br>under apartheid and obviously our models<br>were all kind of Western models they<br>didn't fit with a black people inside<br>various black groupings in South Africa<br>um and so we developed a particular way<br>of working which was in the language of<br>community psychology of the time which<br>was giving psychology away we were<br>trying to make our ideas available to<br>people community organizations who could<br>use them and adapt them and make them<br>more culturally appropriate and sort of<br>Empower them to be able to care for<br>their own communities and we wrote These<br>two books which I'm pleased to say are<br>still being used in South Africa<br>so I guess oh I wanted to say something<br>there it did leave me with two big big<br>sort of issues that I think have framed<br>the rest of my work in Clinical<br>Psychology at least I hope they have<br>because it was really a pivotal sort of<br>experience one is The Clinical<br>Psychology needs to recognize and engage<br>with the social causes of mental health<br>problems to recognize that people's<br>unhappiness is framed by the places and<br>the times that they live<br>um and their clinical psychologist<br>psychology if it's going to be useful it<br>has to be relevant and appropriate for<br>the people who need it most who suffered<br>most<br>fast forward to to New Zealand<br>um<br>I moved here and it took a little while<br>to find my peter than any migrants in<br>the room but it does take a while to<br>find your feet in a new place and so<br>much my work had been about apartheid it<br>was hard to see how it was going to be<br>kind of relevant here but I found myself<br>drawn to youth Mental Health<br>um I think for a couple of reasons one<br>is that I was doing quite a lot of<br>clinical work when I first got here and<br>working with young people and their<br>parents and I was experiencing a sense<br>of frustration at my inability to<br>properly connect with the young people I<br>was talking to I thought I was somehow<br>missing them I would be trying to<br>support them with the ideas that I had<br>but I didn't really understand their<br>world properly and and sometimes they<br>would kind of drift away from the<br>support I was trying to offer and I just<br>thought kind of kind of hit me quite<br>connected<br>the other reason was that I I was a<br>mother of a Teenage child sorry yeah<br>he's a delight but you know you had that<br>sense of worry as a parent and and you<br>kind of you think they're in this new<br>world and you're kind of trying to to<br>support them through it so I certainly<br>identified in that way with what with<br>with<br>um trying to support our young people<br>and then of course I wasn't consciously<br>thinking it but I was a troubled<br>Adolescent and that's me as a troubled<br>adolescent anxious and in those times<br>they didn't have a lot of support<br>available for young people and so I<br>didn't get any and that many of us<br>you'll end up trying to do some work to<br>address something that perhaps you<br>wondering how it's taking so long to get<br>there but it brings me to talking about<br>the crisis in youth mental health you<br>would have seen headlines and<br>discussions all over the place crisis<br>and youth mental health it's here in New<br>Zealand but it's also actually around<br>the world internationally these these<br>these this this particular phrasing is<br>making headlines<br>now I suppose the first question people<br>often ask me is well you know I'll be<br>imagining it it's just something with<br>concocting is it something the media are<br>hyping has you know<br>um<br>I actually don't think so it may not be<br>an immediate crisis of the moment but<br>it's certainly been building for a long<br>time and there's some very worrying<br>statistics on youth Mental Health<br>Patrick McGarry in a in a sort of in a<br>seminal<br>um<br>a special issue on youth mental health<br>and World Psychiatry quoted some<br>statistics that were very sobering<br>around youth Mental Health<br>50 of young people are impacted by<br>mental health problems by the age of 25<br>it's half of all young people and what<br>we know is that problems in adulthood<br>often first developed during during<br>youth<br>mental health problems account for 45 of<br>the burden of disease in the age group<br>14 to 24. so that's massive and early<br>research coming out it's hard to tell is<br>suggesting that young people have young<br>people's mental health has been impacted<br>further by by covert<br>here in New Zealand<br>we haven't got those large-scale studies<br>but we're very hopefully have the youth<br>2000 survey which is of high school<br>students and in their most recent study<br>2020 was actually that study was I think<br>done in 2019 at the survey 23 of of<br>young people reported significant<br>symptoms of depression and this was this<br>is really important but it was up 10<br>from 2012. a similar figure you may<br>think that's an anomaly but a similar<br>figure came out from a New Zealand<br>Health survey recently 23 of young<br>adults are suffering from high levels of<br>psychological distress in 2022 up from<br>five percent in 2011 2012. so it's a<br>massive increase we've had sort of<br>steady concerns about about new Society<br>here too<br>um and we know that New Zealand has been<br>at the top of the charts in terms of its<br>youth suicide rate amongst the OCD<br>countries nothing to be part of at all<br>most recently we've been second in the<br>list interestingly use suicide rates<br>didn't go up<br>um over the over the period of covert as<br>far as we know yet well I don't know if<br>we've seen the consequences yet<br>so if half of the the issue of the<br>crisis in youth mental health is the<br>um the statistics how widespread our<br>problems abuse mental health the other<br>half of it is well what are we doing how<br>are we managing it how we how are we<br>addressing youth mental health and I<br>want to say we're not doing very well at<br>all<br>our Mental Health Services are stretched<br>to their limit with very long waiting<br>lists we heard about that in the mental<br>health and addiction commission report<br>um that came out I think it was at the<br>end of 2018<br>but we also hear many of us who the<br>other professionals here but in we hear<br>anecdotal accounts are very long waiting<br>lists in our Mental Health Services<br>perhaps even longer than ever before and<br>um<br>but there's a hidden problem behind this<br>is that it looks like we just haven't<br>got enough services but actually there's<br>a problem that's been identified by<br>researchers prior to this particular<br>moment of Crisis and that is that young<br>people tend not to use Mental Health<br>Services professional mental health<br>services so estimates range from you<br>know<br>twenty percent of young people using<br>mental health services to fifty percent<br>of people using mental health services<br>now that's 20 of young people who've had<br>mental health problems using mental<br>health services that's not all young<br>people so that's a real concern and<br>people in the youth mental health<br>movement have argued that this is a<br>product of our services not being fit<br>for purpose that they're not set up well<br>to address the needs of young people<br>we see with us not only people not using<br>services but also when they're engaged<br>with Services quite quickly dropping out<br>and not getting the help that they need<br>so yeah so we we talk about a service<br>Gap<br>and I always say there's a service gap<br>which is exacerbated by a generation gap<br>um yeah you've got your lovely Baby<br>Boomers sipping their flat whites and<br>having a jolly good old life<br>and you've got your young people looking<br>a little bit teeth and stressed staring<br>at their phones and somehow this older<br>generation these seems out of touch with<br>with the Young Generation so much has<br>changed now I know every generation<br>there's going to be change between one<br>generation and the next and you know<br>kids adults listen to classical music<br>kids listen to rock and roll that's been<br>there for ages but there's been such<br>rapid transformation of sort of digital<br>communication technology and Rapid<br>transformation of the social and<br>political climates that people inhabit<br>that we really haven't caught up to<br>young people and we're not understanding<br>what exactly it is going on for them<br>what exactly is going on for them in<br>fact<br>um<br>when I speak to parents and when I speak<br>to clinicians that's exactly what<br>they're saying what is going on with our<br>young people like why are they feeling<br>so upset and distressed and unhappy<br>um<br>so you would think the most logical<br>thing to do if you were wanted to know<br>more about well you know how do you<br>reach young people today you would go<br>and ask them like well what's going on<br>with you why are you guys feeling<br>unhappy what's this about you know what<br>is it you need but there has been a<br>surprising absence of dialogue with<br>young people I have to say until<br>recently<br>um<br>and indeed young people often feel like<br>their voices aren't heard that they're<br>not asked about their own mental health<br>I think there are a couple of reasons<br>why young we don't we have taken so long<br>to try and engage people young people in<br>conversations about their mental health<br>one is that<br>I think it's this idea that you know oh<br>well we might find out about groups we<br>don't know but we were all young we know<br>what it means to be young we were there<br>and of course we came out of it all<br>right you know we're fine and so we<br>don't need to go and ask them what might<br>be different for them although of course<br>we're really missing<br>the major differences in being young<br>today compared to when we were young<br>I think there are also a lot of very<br>unhelpful discourses surrounding youth<br>if you read like newspaper articles and<br>things young people are often depicted<br>as being very<br>irresponsible risky you can't quite<br>trust them and also they're terribly<br>vulnerable and so there's this idea that<br>if you asked a young person about mental<br>health you know they were going to give<br>you some sort of irrational and helpful<br>answer or that they would be immensely<br>hurt by now I always find it utterly<br>amusing<br>um that that you would say to young<br>people oh I understand you know I'm<br>concerned about your mental health oh my<br>gosh didn't know I had a mental health<br>problem you know looking at you in<br>horror of course young people know they<br>have a mental health problem they're<br>talking about it all the time<br>um and finally there's another Insidious<br>thing that's prevented us from talking<br>to young people about their mental<br>health and that is that we have a very<br>poor history in my profession of talking<br>to people with lived experience or what<br>sometimes called consumers in our in our<br>view of things<br>um because people with mental health<br>problems well they can't really be<br>trusted to know what's good for them and<br>of course if you're a child or a young<br>person with mental health problem then<br>we definitely not going to listen to you<br>because you won't have anything useful<br>to say so all of that has conspired I<br>think to close down<br>um<br>conversations with young people about<br>so<br>we have started and I have to say<br>there's been a sea change in the mental<br>health Arena just literally in the last<br>few years where people are saying well<br>you know let's engage our people with<br>lived experience in in sort of Designing<br>programs and so on which is a brilliant<br>thing but it's very easy particularly<br>with young people to become tokenistic<br>about the way you approach this so what<br>you do is you kind of design some you<br>take an adult kind of version of an<br>intervention they put some nice sort of<br>Youth friendly pictures on it and then<br>you showed to some young people and say<br>what do you think of this nice thing I<br>did and I I'm always reminded of this<br>joke about the narcissist who says well<br>you know he's been talking at you all<br>night about himself and then says well<br>you know enough about me what do you<br>think of me and we have to be careful<br>that we don't do that with with young<br>people when we talk with them about<br>Mental Health<br>and I guess it was some of these ideas<br>that you know were kind of in my mind<br>when I started the mirror project so the<br>the the the the<br>um title middle Murrah project was<br>really supposed to be about holding up<br>emerge of professionals so that they<br>could see the way that young people<br>perceived them so we could get a sense<br>of how we were being seen<br>and the agenda of this project and it's<br>not a single study it's a series of<br>study but they they're kind of united<br>with a particular ethos and the idea<br>behind them is to try and open up a<br>space where young people can tell us<br>what they think about stuff they can<br>tell us what they think about mental<br>health what is it what does it mean and<br>tell us what they think about you<br>suicide they can tell us about services<br>but not yes I liked it and no I didn't<br>but what happened what was it like and<br>we looked across a whole range of<br>different Services<br>mental health services our cam services<br>School counseling text and telephone<br>counseling Thank You Youth line General<br>help seeking and kind of online support<br>and yeah kind of all the things trying<br>to capture people who use services but<br>also people who heavy duty Services<br>because remember that's the biggest<br>group that we don't know what they think<br>um and yeah when I wrote my book on this<br>I I said we had interviewed about 400<br>people and and probably now it's closer<br>to about 500.<br>um trying to get their view of things<br>and it's actually fascinating because<br>what I found it fascinating anyway<br>um you know when you're a clinician or a<br>researcher you you make yourself the<br>star of the stories that you write like<br>you know there was a young person they<br>were very vulnerable and I swept him<br>with my amazing intervention and did<br>this thing and they were forever<br>transformed when I heard young people's<br>stories they were the the heroes of<br>their stories they had the lead part and<br>occasionally a clinician would wander<br>into the into their bit of the stage and<br>sometimes helpfully and sometimes less<br>hopefully<br>um and I want to just acknowledge that<br>this work is done with a group of of<br>doctoral students and and honor students<br>that I've been working with and that<br>some of them over there and some of them<br>in the room which is great<br>um and I could not have done this work<br>without them because<br>um you may not have guessed but I'm<br>quite old and and and yeah they provide<br>that real kind of translation of what<br>young people were experiencing and also<br>many of them shared a sort of identity<br>with the young groups of young people<br>that they were talking to so that was<br>tremendously important so many of the<br>ideas that I'm talking about come from<br>them<br>since then I just want to acknowledge<br>that we're working on a number of other<br>research projects with a range of people<br>our Marsden funded research and<br>um a recent youth mental health project<br>and and also student mental health<br>projects are all of it related but not<br>strictly speaking under under the banner<br>tell us about youth mental health or<br>rather about the crisis in youth Mental<br>Health<br>I'm just going to give you a little like<br>a vignettes and and glimpses of of the<br>ideas that they came up with<br>um and the first thing I thought I might<br>look at was uh what it is that young<br>people call think causes mental health<br>problems now if you ask anybody what's<br>the cause of young people's mental<br>health problems today what did they say<br>oh it's social media now I felt<br>uncomfortable about that when I first<br>heard it but I read this meme that it<br>just seemed to really sum it up well we<br>don't have jobs or money and climate<br>change is destroying the world but<br>parents be like oh social media is<br>making young people anxious<br>and I'm not trying to forgive social<br>media because social media does have a<br>role to play and it's obviously got a<br>whole lot of malevolent influences<br>playing out there I'm not saying it's<br>not them but it's very easy for us to<br>literally blame the messenger blame the<br>the the the the the way that some of<br>these these messages that exist in our<br>society are being conveyed to young<br>people<br>and so young people spoke about their<br>distress sometimes they mention social<br>media but it was in a much way that was<br>very continuous with their life<br>experience so social media wasn't just<br>happening online it was happening in the<br>real world in a big way racism happens<br>in the real world and then is enacted on<br>social media<br>misogyny it's a saying the right-wing<br>stuff the terrible stuff it's in our<br>world and I worry that when we say it's<br>social media we want to make it somebody<br>that's not us and I think we need to own<br>so what did young people say was causing<br>their mental health problems and I'm<br>pulling out a few ideas here it's more<br>complicated than this I know and I'm<br>focusing of course on the social course<br>of mental health problems particularly<br>young people spoke about tremendous<br>pressure to succeed as though they they<br>felt a pressure to be exceptional<br>somehow amazing it wasn't okay to just<br>be okay and that is in terms of like<br>maybe academically exceptional but maybe<br>in terms of sport or maybe just all<br>around beautiful or like a lovely good<br>personal an exceptional kind of person<br>and it's of course particularly ironic<br>because I mean I have very limited<br>knowledge of quantitative psychology but<br>I know and they're bell curve like most<br>of us should be sitting right in the<br>middle because we are average that's<br>what average means and yet no young<br>person is allowed to be average anymore<br>it's interesting because we heard from<br>wealthy middle class people we also<br>heard from poorer Working Class People<br>saying exactly the same kind of<br>narrative about how they had to push<br>themselves so hard to be able to succeed<br>now some of them said well yeah it's<br>exacerbated by social media by um<br>kind of you know social comparison you<br>see on social media so that might be a<br>part of it but they also spoke about<br>their teachers and parents just pushing<br>them endlessly to do well to be<br>exceptional to stand out that the audit<br>culture in school it means that kids are<br>just evaluated all the time at every<br>turn<br>and so they struggled with that<br>spoke about loneliness now<br>lonels for young people seem to be one<br>of the worst kinds of feelings that they<br>could have that feeling of being either<br>on their own or simply feeling lonely<br>because there wasn't anyone around that<br>understood them<br>and<br>Jonah win talks about how belonging is<br>such an important thing for young people<br>that seem to belonging to a place and I<br>think it's harder to belong now I think<br>so in previous generations and I don't<br>want to idealize this because the kind<br>of belonging previous generations<br>offered was often very unhelpful you<br>belonged to your church you will you<br>know your parents worked at the same<br>company for years and years or you<br>belong to a geographical Community but<br>now things are so fluid and dynamic and<br>yes you could find<br>work really hard to find it find the<br>place where you belong and the people<br>who are for you<br>our second classes at this University<br>first year classes and uh you know<br>there's hundreds of undergraduates<br>sitting there and nobody talking to<br>anyone they're sitting there and they're<br>looking at their phone like this and<br>we've created a system of big<br>institution where you have these Mass<br>lectures where young people feel like<br>they can't speak to one another and you<br>just kind of feel that loneliness<br>lack of acceptance so this is a really<br>big one<br>young people are given identity is<br>really important when you're a young<br>person you know making yourself deciding<br>who you want to be and so on and our<br>world today seems to offer so many<br>opportunities for young people to find<br>an identity that works for them you know<br>with us in terms of their gender or<br>their sexuality or their culture or<br>their race or whatever it is that they<br>can belong to and that sounds like a<br>glorious story but it isn't true because<br>when a young person claimed an identity<br>they can also be subject to the most<br>horrific forms of abuse so their freedom<br>belies the fact that young people when<br>they take up possessions uh whether it's<br>being trans or whether it's being<br>homosexual or whether it's being<br>belonged to a particular wearing a hijab<br>they get hammered for that they get<br>attacked for that art and not just<br>online here in the real world we heard<br>horrific stories about kids at school<br>being subject to racism and so on<br>now when you ask people about youth<br>mental health and young people struggles<br>they often um<br>they're often<br>kind of<br>you'll hear some people saying probably<br>not you people here because you hear a<br>full lecture and you think oh but you<br>know there's mumbles of people like the<br>Jonathan hate kind of idea like oh young<br>people they're just so fragile little<br>snowflakes they can't deal with a bit of<br>hardship Etc<br>um<br>and I don't think that's true and I<br>don't think it's helpful I think young<br>people really really are struggling<br>they're struggling with loneliness<br>unacceptability they're struggling with<br>A continuous pressure to achieve that<br>there's something else which is toxic in<br>the mix and that makes it extra hard for<br>young people today and that is a sort of<br>a neoliberal idea that people have<br>choice that they can be anyone that they<br>want to be as long as they choose and<br>they're the best self and they try their<br>best and they go up and you can be<br>whatever you like not a lot of God and<br>write about this very thing and they're<br>right about how in previous generations<br>it was kind of like when on your<br>trajectory to adulthood you would stop<br>at different stations you could stop at<br>you know the station of school or the<br>station of University or the station of<br>marriage or family or whatever it was<br>that guided you whereas now they say<br>it's like you're in a car and you get<br>given you know the keys and that<br>somebody says go find your future go<br>find it it's up to you it's out there I<br>think even that analogy though is a<br>little bit misleading because many young<br>people<br>um don't have money for petrol for their<br>car the some of those young people don't<br>have a car and some of those people are<br>somewhere within a roads even where a<br>car could drive and what we've done is<br>there are no resources put behind young<br>people or very few and some of the<br>social welfare that we had in the past<br>in this country has been taken away and<br>yet be saying to young people we're<br>giving them the message well be your<br>best song You Can Be whoever you like<br>but if you can't be whose fault is it<br>it's your fault<br>you're the failure and I love this quote<br>from a a very insightful young woman who<br>said well you can be she said her<br>parents kind of looked at her and said<br>well you can be anything you want you<br>can be the Prime Minister and then turn<br>around and looked at her and said well<br>why aren't you the Prime Minister see<br>that's that's how it goes<br>Okay so<br>what do if if one side is what's causing<br>mental health problems and we really<br>need to look at those and how we are<br>perpetuating them as adults some of<br>those issues young people are struggling<br>with<br>but the other side of it is how we<br>supporting young people and is the way<br>that we're trying to support them<br>so what I'm going to do is just pull out<br>four key sort of messages the young<br>people gave me about what they thought<br>was really important for them in terms<br>of in terms of being able to use support<br>and feel that that could be helpful for<br>them and I guess what I'm thinking of is<br>these are the things I want and and are<br>they getting it<br>so one of the first things young people<br>wanted was to kind of be respected and<br>have their own kind of agency recognized<br>um to have some some say over what<br>happened to them in their lives now to<br>understand that you have to understand<br>that young people occupy the lowest<br>level of the hierarchy in society that<br>they told what to do at school they're<br>told what to do at home by their parents<br>they're told what to do at University by<br>their lecturers when they get their<br>first job they've told what to do by<br>their boss<br>they don't feel any power a young person<br>who's been bullied terribly at school<br>can't leave school has to keep turning<br>up every day a young person who's being<br>abused by a parent stays at home because<br>there's nowhere else to go<br>so they have very little choice and you<br>can imagine that when they come to get<br>some mental health support they are<br>worried that they'd last a little bit of<br>control that they have will be taken<br>from them and that's especially true for<br>people groups of young people in our<br>society who have been robbed by systemic<br>disempowerment of of of their sense of<br>power<br>um and so what happens when young people<br>into a mental health service well the<br>first thing is they don't often intrude<br>on their own choosing to go there they<br>have to go they usually get sent by a<br>parent and there's a whole lot of adults<br>have to sign stuff off for them to be<br>able to get any help at all<br>and then that first encounter in an<br>assessment session could easily be with<br>four adults and one young person in the<br>room and young people we you know<br>sometimes you have two clinicians and<br>often you have the parents or other<br>adults in the family there and I I want<br>to hold that the the whanau clothes but<br>some young people told us they just<br>couldn't find their voice in that<br>setting they were too scared to say what<br>they thought in this group of of adults<br>and of course the setting itself is<br>incredibly intimidating you know for a<br>young person where they're these sorts<br>of encounters on their associations<br>might be like going to the principal's<br>office or going to the doctors rooms or<br>hospital and now they're in a kind of<br>room that feels a little bit the same as<br>that and some of them even before<br>they're in for their assessment said<br>that they were Imagining the kind of<br>stuff they see on TV with a psychologist<br>in a sort of police interrogation<br>setting no wonder that they they are<br>frightened<br>and and and then when it comes to<br>decision making about what they want<br>they have very little say there too they<br>get told what's what's good for them<br>what kind of treatment is appropriate<br>and this young woman was somebody who'd<br>just been offered um antidepressants and<br>she didn't really want to take them and<br>she said yeah but how do you say to an<br>adult hey by the way I don't think<br>that's quite right yeah sometimes you<br>and then young people want to have a<br>relationship with somebody they don't<br>they don't want to talk to somebody they<br>don't know about this deep stuff that's<br>worrying them<br>um and there's a sort of a misconception<br>that young people are less relational<br>today that they are all kind of looking<br>at their phones<br>um but in fact I had the it was one of<br>the loveliest things about the research<br>I I did was just realizing exactly how<br>much friendship matters to young people<br>when they look at their phones they're<br>often talking to other people that's<br>what they're doing looking to their<br>phones looking at their phones and<br>and and and and friendship if anything<br>seems more important in this generation<br>than it was in my generation there's so<br>much bombardment of false friendship and<br>consumer interest masquerading and<br>friendship uh this even the idea of sort<br>of you know big groups of friends on<br>social media they were really skeptical<br>of all that they didn't think those were<br>friends their new friends were the<br>people that listened to you that told<br>your information safely that you can<br>trust and you have to get to know them<br>to know that<br>um<br>and what do we do in our Mental Health<br>Services well<br>we I know it's a a psychologist we've<br>been trained to recognize how important<br>a relationship is with somebody and if<br>you're going to do any kind of<br>therapeutic work at all but our systems<br>don't always allow us to do that so<br>you'll find a young person coming into a<br>first therapy session and they'll have<br>an assessment where they're asked all<br>about what the problem is with this<br>person that they don't know sometimes<br>that assessment is done by one person<br>and they find out all about them and<br>they talk or don't talk and then they<br>get sent to another person to do the<br>therapy and if they left the service<br>they come back and see a third person so<br>it doesn't matter who you see that's our<br>system works<br>um<br>I thought it was particularly bizarre as<br>I thought about the fact that you know<br>most of us have a GP we would like the<br>idea that we could keep this GP for a<br>decade or a couple of decades because<br>that's how much it matters to know the<br>person that you're talking to and yet we<br>think we can chop and change doesn't<br>matter who the clinician is that you see<br>that day understandably young people<br>don't want to talk in that setting and<br>they want an opportunity to grow a<br>relationship and to feel safe with<br>someone because as one person said<br>because no one feels comfortable talking<br>to a stranger about your problems<br>then they want to talk and be listened<br>to<br>um<br>so interestingly enough that young<br>people said that they thought they were<br>kind of getting a mixed message that<br>people were saying to them hey come talk<br>to us about your problems but if you did<br>go and talk to somebody like hey cheer<br>up or you know or no we don't really<br>want to hear about that or can't we fix<br>it<br>um and they sort of reference a sort of<br>a a kind of a culture of toxic<br>positivity this idea of like you always<br>have to be upbeat you know you've got to<br>manifest the life you want and all of<br>that stuff that young people feel like<br>doesn't get in space to just feel down<br>to just feel bad<br>um they also spoke about number eight<br>wire kind of mentality without using<br>those words but this idea that you you<br>can just fix things you you know if<br>you've got a problem you just need to<br>get on and fix it and we're very proud<br>of a number of why mentality here and I<br>I say it's a wonderful thing but only if<br>you're a fence it's not a good idea if<br>you're a person a young person<br>struggling with your emotions<br>um and so young people want a space to<br>talk now when they go into our Mental<br>Health Services we have uh constraints<br>on funding or<br>um and so we're looking for quick fixes<br>we're looking for things that work<br>instantly like don't take very long to<br>give somebody antidepressants now I'm<br>not saying antidepressants are unhelpful<br>but they're also a quick fix and maybe<br>you need therapy alongside the<br>antidepressants not instead of<br>necessarily but with it and we heard<br>again in the Mental Health commission<br>report that<br>um that the people wanted more talking<br>therapies they want to have access to a<br>therapy where they can talk something<br>out and be understood and make sense of<br>things<br>unfortunately sometimes our talking<br>therapies are also rather quick fixes<br>we've opting by and large for therapies<br>that focus on skills or quick strategies<br>or techniques so that we can kind of<br>move people on after the obligatory like<br>you know successions or whatever it is<br>and young people say and I have no<br>problem with those methods because<br>they're really good but if you can<br>balance them with a space for a young<br>person to just talk and find out who<br>they are and make sense of themselves<br>um so as one young person said what she<br>had struggled with is that you know<br>every time she went to see somebody<br>they're very quick to say this is what<br>you should do and I didn't have anyone<br>that would just step back and actually<br>listen<br>they also want to be able to access this<br>is the last of this<br>um access support in the moment that<br>they they needed it<br>so<br>um if this is a generation which are who<br>are used to you know you want to talk to<br>somebody hi you know like you wouldn't<br>dream of waiting until the next morning<br>I remember when I was making an<br>arrangement to see my friends it would<br>be like bring them bring them up and<br>young people don't like the phone ring<br>them up and say yeah shall we meet at<br>eight o'clock at the movie house<br>whatever<br>um and they would turn up there three<br>days later or whatever it was young<br>people don't understand that hey they're<br>like oh we're here now we're moving here<br>now okay we're here so what do we do<br>when they phone up for help and say can<br>I see somebody I need to see a counselor<br>a psychologist<br>um<br>we said we'll give you an appointment on<br>Thursday two o'clock next week one young<br>person said to me like why would I want<br>to see somebody on Thursday at two<br>o'clock next week when I'm upset now<br>like you just didn't get there<br>um so we kind of got this last century<br>kind of<br>um<br>Mental Health Service that's nowhere<br>near the way that young people are<br>operating today<br>um<br>and of course that's not the least of it<br>because in fact it's very unlikely that<br>they would get an appointment for<br>Thursday next week at two o'clock they<br>would be much more likely to get an<br>appointment for six months time for a<br>problem that they distressed about now<br>and I mean that is just a terrible<br>terrible thing it it risks the<br>well-being of our of our young people<br>and and sometimes their lives um and as<br>one young person said when they feel<br>like they're sit like that on a waiting<br>list with nobody being able to see them<br>they feel like they aren't worthy like<br>they don't matter<br>um so we're trying to find ways that we<br>can meet young people that we can<br>connect with them and give them help in<br>a timely way and we digital stuff has<br>been amazing for their ticks counseling<br>at youth line has been incredible for<br>young people you know in the night when<br>you're frightened when you're all by<br>yourself and you just need that person<br>there and then we heard lovely stories<br>when we did our research like a a young<br>woman on a bus being bullied texting to<br>get some help in that moment while she<br>was struggling a young man his parents<br>were fighting it was about to become<br>physical and he could just text and talk<br>with somebody about how to deal with<br>that we have this amazing technology at<br>our disposal and we're not using it<br>enough interestingly I don't think it's<br>a matter of just designing some apps and<br>putting them out there because the young<br>people still want that relationality<br>they still want their freedom to find<br>the thing that works for them and they<br>want that opportunity to talk or vent as<br>you call it online<br>so I think our Mental Health Service<br>looks a little bit like this<br>it was designed I don't know where the<br>car analogies come from I'm so not<br>interested in cars but<br>um<br>is it design loss<br>it's old it's falling apart it's not fit<br>for purpose we need something<br>sustainable it's probably not a car it's<br>a bus or bicycle but something that<br>works for young people where they can<br>access support that's appropriate for<br>them in the moment they need it<br>that it sounds like I've been saying<br>there's something wrong with our Mental<br>Health Services and I want to say that's<br>there are some fantastic pockets of<br>organizations and groups of individuals<br>doing amazing work with with young<br>people<br>um overseas we've got brilliant models<br>like headspace in in Australia and<br>jigsaws is like a dedicated<br>um a dedicated service for young people<br>that meets just the kind of needs that<br>I'm talking to you about here in New<br>Zealand we have youth line and I'm very<br>proud to say I'm on The Advisory Board<br>the Board of Trustees of that and I<br>think they're absolutely model<br>Organization for trying to engage with<br>young people in a way that works for<br>them<br>um Levar is great they are our youth<br>One-Stop shops but the big problem and<br>and even little pockets in you know Pro<br>Care and other organizations doing<br>fantastic things here but<br>the problem is there isn't a recognition<br>that young people need an appropriate<br>Mental Health Service and money to<br>support rolling that out you find<br>organizations struggling to cover the<br>basics for this fantastic work that<br>they're doing<br>so this is my last point before we get<br>to the end of the lecture<br>um<br>and I do want to say that as much as<br>um<br>as much as professionals we need to<br>change our mental health system so that<br>it works better for young people<br>we also can't rely on professionals and<br>services alone we all have a<br>responsibility to deal with mental<br>health<br>mental health is everybody's business<br>and youth mental health is belongs to<br>all of us<br>um<br>and I guess that there's been a<br>particular problem here in the extent to<br>which we as communities wrap around and<br>support our young people<br>um<br>for example of useless suicide is a very<br>good one for capturing<br>capacities we've had here now you would<br>have known if you've been in this<br>country for a long time if there was a<br>kind of a shift in the way that people<br>spoke about suicide and use suicide over<br>the decades that it used to be more open<br>that people used to have suicide<br>prevention training and stuff in schools<br>and that kind of pulled back on that and<br>there's a very strong push to<br>professionalize<br>conversations on suicide and on youth<br>mental health you know this idea that<br>that's a professional issue and only a<br>professional can help with this<br>um<br>in relation to Suicide I think it really<br>you can see the difficulties here I I<br>understand with that those decisions<br>were coming from they were coming from a<br>case of being concerned that suicidal<br>contagion if people speak about suicide<br>open if young people speak about suicide<br>opening in their networks well you know<br>it can kind of get out of hand and<br>actually maybe result in further suicide<br>but that seems to come from an age in<br>which people got their information from<br>television newspapers and radio and I<br>don't know about you but I don't know<br>any young person who gets their<br>information about anything from those<br>sources<br>and so<br>what we have is a situation where we<br>tightly controlling information about<br>suicide but in all the all the wrong<br>places because young people are talking<br>about suicide all the time and I had a<br>particular experience with my son when<br>he was at school somebody heard there<br>was a suicide act at his school and<br>um<br>and I heard about it from my youth a<br>young person I heard about it through my<br>Professional Network some two weeks<br>later and I I said to him you know did<br>you know about the suicide and he said<br>yeah not about for ages<br>who didn't know we didn't know we adults<br>didn't know and that actually came up in<br>not that particular example but another<br>one in in the data that in the<br>conversations that we had with young<br>people and and at a particular school<br>um they had closed down the conversation<br>on suicide being very cautious about<br>whether it would kind of run wild<br>through the school but of course<br>everybody had been on social media since<br>three o'clock in the morning talking<br>about it with one another and only the<br>school wasn't talking about it and this<br>young person said yeah the strategy to<br>close the conversation didn't work<br>people talked about the suicide anyway<br>everybody knew it had happened and it's<br>like people talked about it the only<br>people who didn't talk about it were the<br>adults<br>and I think that's a terrible shame<br>because we're missing an opportunity to<br>talk to to be in those conversations so<br>that we can guide them and have helpful<br>conversations about you suicide this<br>idea that we must control the<br>conversation is updated and unhelpful<br>and even in relation to other areas<br>where we feel like oh maybe I don't have<br>the skills or you're supposed to be<br>incredibly knowledgeable to be able to I<br>mean if you look at what young people<br>want they want someone to talk to they<br>want a relationship they want to feel<br>like they can go and choose the person<br>that they want to talk to these are not<br>hard things to offer them we could do<br>that stuff and we could take all of<br>these people us adults the teachers the<br>parents the the pharmacists who might be<br>there controlling the Met what<br>medication is for and we could help them<br>have proper conversations with young<br>people that that might help you through<br>um<br>so I'm right at the end now<br>good bang on time and I want you to say<br>some thank yous firstly I want to thank<br>the amazing young people that I we spoke<br>to all of us here<br>um who are just so creative and you know<br>so committed which given given that they<br>haven't had a very good deal so open to<br>helping us understand the problems and<br>working with them on how to solve them<br>and they had to be very brave off and<br>talking about deepest vulnerabilities<br>with adults they didn't know sometimes<br>um thanks to my colleagues in the School<br>of Psychology this is an average Tuesday<br>morning<br>we kind of How We Roll<br>um and particularly to my wonderful<br>clinical colleagues Clinical Psychology<br>colleagues over there who support me so<br>wonderfully and<br>do fantastic work with young people in<br>your jobs and in your work<br>thanks to my wonderful friends this is a<br>sort of a symbolic picture rather than<br>actual one because there's some of my<br>wonderful friends who aren't in this<br>Photograph but we swim together and they<br>they keep me sane they're called the<br>wild woman but also there's a few are<br>not wild women but I still love them<br>theory is Jenny's girlfriend<br>um and my sisters and my mum and dad who<br>said he passed in the last couple of<br>years but would have loved to be here<br>um yeah so thank you very much to<br>everybody</p></main><footer style="margin-top: 2rem; background: #0001; padding: 2rem; text-align: center;"><p>We Are The University</p><ul style="list-style-type: none;
