otago<br>Christchurch and on behalf of our staff<br>and the people that you'll be hearing<br>from today we want to offer you a very<br>warm welcome on this very very freezing<br>evening<br>uh the water that I started uh with<br>actually was not the waiter I intended<br>to start with but it's a beautiful<br>waiter I married into naitahu and it is<br>uh one of the songs my father-in-law<br>taught me<br>and it is about the moisture or the snow<br>falling upon Mount aoraki which it<br>seriously feels like outside tonight<br>right<br>but it actually symbolizes the knowledge<br>and at signposts the knowledge and<br>importance<br>of transgenerational information to<br>support the well-being of our komatua of<br>our parking care to arangatahi right<br>downtown so the most important things<br>about holder and aging well as our<br>ability to pass our knowledge to each<br>other for the wellness of our whole<br>community so I just felt that it was an<br>appropriate way to start this evening to<br>introduce you and welcome you to our<br>attitude the University of otago based<br>here in Christchurch and I'm I hope<br>you're as excited as I am to hear from<br>most amazing people that we have to<br>speak to us this evening and my favorite<br>book will be the exciting but<br>provocative questions you get to ask at<br>the end so without further Ado it's my<br>pleasure to introduce you to our MC for<br>this evening Laura Lee Mason who will<br>orientate us and introduce us to the<br>evening<br>foreign<br>Welcome to our wonderful rolleston<br>theater<br>to hear the first of four public talks<br>celebrate the University of otago<br>christchurch's 50th anniversary kiamal<br>we're going to be showcasing through<br>these talks academic and clinical and<br>seek knowledge for the sake of your<br>well-being and I think that's what many<br>of you have come here to perhaps learn<br>this evening<br>we've got a very busy hour ahead hearing<br>expert opinion on Aging well how to<br>achieve dignity brain health spark and<br>well-being in our older years how to use<br>it before we lose it how to harness The<br>Power of Positive Thinking to eat Smart<br>think smart and keep your mind and body<br>strong with a major theme that it's<br>never too early or too late to achieve<br>this and to adopt new principles and<br>ways of living as we live our lives with<br>as much Independence and dignity as we<br>can into the third age<br>we have four fantastic speakers for you<br>tonight all with Decades of experience<br>and geriatric medicine geriatric mental<br>health and geriatric nutrition<br>each of our four speakers Emeritus<br>Professor dick sainsbury Professor Tim<br>Wilkinson Lee O'Brien and Dr Matthew<br>Croucher will give a presentation and<br>this will be followed by a q a session<br>at the end depending on how much time we<br>have left<br>okay with that bit over I'll introduce<br>our first Speaker<br>Emeritus dick sainsbury Professor dick<br>he is a a man who's dedicated his<br>distinguished career to the care of<br>older patients and whose reputation as a<br>clinician of immense Talent skill<br>empathy and humanity is respected his<br>name has appeared on many many dozens of<br>published articles on geriatric health<br>and now in retirement he's also a<br>published author<br>he has a particular interest in student<br>teaching and has served a period before<br>he retired as a trainee intern<br>coordinator he's also been involved in<br>the examinating examination sorry<br>mentoring and supervision of<br>International Medical graduates he was<br>an elected member of the medical Council<br>of New Zealand for six years and a board<br>member of the New Zealand artificial<br>limb service for nine he's interested in<br>older people and literature and<br>completed his M.A thesis on older people<br>and aging in the fiction of Thomas Hardy<br>he has recently published a book as I<br>mentioned on older people in aging and I<br>think to export just a few of his books<br>along<br>tonight<br>um fantastic book I've read it it's just<br>amazing<br>he was president of the nzgs between<br>2002 and 2005 and Dick remains deeply<br>involved in helping out older kiwis<br>including sitting on the medication<br>advisory committee for Ryman Healthcare<br>welcome uh dick<br>Montana<br>people often ask me<br>well when exactly are you old and<br>they're expecting an answer for me to<br>give an answer in terms of years in<br>terms of a birthday perhaps they're<br>expecting 65.<br>because that's the being the traditional<br>retirement age and is the age at which<br>we currently get superannuation<br>perhaps they're expecting 75 because<br>that's the age in which<br>age-related services in the United<br>Kingdom have that's the allocated age<br>there perhaps they're thinking 80. well<br>I I don't like to think of age in terms<br>of years I think age in years is the<br>least important it's the easiest to<br>measure but it's the least important and<br>I consider that we need to think of<br>so I've got these two quotations here<br>the first from Henry Ford<br>you're old when you stop learning<br>whether at 20<br>uh you can be old and at 80 you can be<br>the second one is from Sir Robin day<br>who says the frequent Menace of old age<br>is it often imprisons its victim in the<br>departure Lounge of life now we don't<br>want this it's not a departure Lounge<br>it's not a type of Coral Club for the<br>long journey there's no free food and<br>drink for a start but we need to<br>recognize that this is bonus time these<br>are bonus years and they can be used<br>excitingly and productively and<br>and that's what we should be aiming to<br>do<br>so<br>here am I an old man<br>in a dry season<br>being read to by a boy<br>waiting for the rain<br>and I am what I am because of all the<br>forces that have acted on me every day<br>of my life<br>and I am what you see now is the the<br>almost finished product<br>and<br>but there are many of these forces and<br>they're very important in influencing<br>how we age and I've got four big ones up<br>there the first is chronological age two<br>years old a few years<br>now as I said before I think this is the<br>least important of the lot we're all<br>going to be eight uh 90 minutes older at<br>the end of this presentation than we<br>were before and we can't do anything<br>about that<br>the next one is biological aging which<br>is as old as your arteries and this is a<br>mixture of both genetics and disease we<br>can't choose our parents we may have<br>been born into a family where there's<br>premature heart disease or diabetes or<br>high lipids or whatever I can't do much<br>about that but we can modify lifestyle<br>situations to overcome that and Lee will<br>be talking more about diet later but of<br>course there's exercise not smoking<br>okay so if we can do something about<br>biological age in terms of it<br>sociological aging you're as old as<br>others make you this is a very powerful<br>one when I was aged 52 years I was<br>walking down a London Street and I Came<br>Upon A group of children playing<br>hopscotch and as I approached them I<br>heard one of them say we better stop for<br>so I looked around to see if I could<br>help Mr<br>I did<br>it was me so as old as others make you<br>and sometimes of course this is these<br>are the people that love you the most<br>who are saying things to you like I'll<br>do your Lawns for you Fred can prune<br>your fruit trees let's move you should<br>move into a rest time before it's too<br>late Etc<br>so just be very careful about one of the<br>things we have to learn to do is to<br>learn the difference between accepting<br>help that enables us to retain our<br>independence and and firmly pushing back<br>those people that want to to over cost<br>at us<br>and then psychological aging as old as<br>you make yourself well this is a very<br>powerful one and there are now many<br>studies that show that people who have a<br>positive attitude towards their own<br>aging do better than those that don't<br>and this is again important in the<br>context of isolation and loneliness and<br>depression and things which can be such<br>Dreadful things for older people so<br>how old you make yourself is is again<br>another powerful thing<br>okay we need to think and plan ahead and<br>here are some of the areas that uh that<br>we can think about first of all enduring<br>power of attorney<br>um you will be thanked by your family<br>your fun hour and health professionals<br>if you've got enduring power of attorney<br>and you get into difficulty suddenly<br>equally so if you don't have the<br>enduring power opportunity that can make<br>hard work for health professionals so<br>get a health a power of attorney<br>interesting that the legislation that<br>guides this which dates back to 1988 is<br>currently being reviewed by the law<br>commission so it's very likely that<br>new legislation governing this side of<br>things will be available at some stage<br>but of course last time they nearly got<br>it there there was an election and<br>things do tend to get buried by<br>elections<br>what if I become unable to drive well<br>that's a again we need to be planning<br>for that I very much like what they do<br>in Oregon when they do a driving<br>assessment they don't just say you're<br>failed off it they say you won't I'm<br>afraid you won't be able to drive again<br>but here are a here are the range of<br>options available to you to enable you<br>to maintain your mobility in other words<br>it's an enabling exercise rather than a<br>high tech uh<br>um Advanced directives these are we<br>could need people to know what our<br>choices are in terms of failing Health<br>when we get older not just the<br>relatively straightforward one of<br>cardiac pulmonary resuscitation which is<br>what do I want done if my heart stops<br>suddenly but more complex sort of things<br>should my heart failure get worse do I<br>want to be rushed in from my rest home<br>to emergency department or am I quite<br>content for them to try and manage it<br>here what if I get pneumonia when I've<br>if I've got<br>a neurological disease and so on and so<br>forth we need to be uh<br>articulate about what our what our care<br>wishes are<br>so that's ceilings of care<br>now<br>this just emphasizes that there are very<br>many ways of finding meaning and joy and<br>I'm not going to go through all of them<br>but I'm going to emphasize too<br>I'd like to emphasize those activities<br>that enable you to be social and with<br>others<br>so those are very very good<br>activities to to to help combat<br>isolation<br>and loneliness and so on so those sort<br>of things<br>but then right at the bottom write your<br>memories or a play about your life<br>experiences<br>now I have done many many award rounds<br>in my time where I've been told really<br>interesting things by a patient<br>and I've said to them<br>I hope you've got that written down<br>and almost invariably they say but no<br>one else will be interested<br>well I tell you you everyone is<br>interested your grandchildren is an oral<br>and um<br>and and written narrative are such an<br>important part of our lives and and and<br>uh and our aging so really do get it<br>written down<br>I'm spending a couple of interesting<br>things at the moment working with a<br>couple of people who've got dementia who<br>are beginning to forget and trying to<br>get their life stories down before it<br>becomes<br>too late so write your memories or a<br>play about your life experiences<br>okay the environment outside this<br>building there is a set of traffic<br>lights and the center of traffic lights<br>has got to cross now side<br>and when the green person comes up and<br>it says cross now it assumes a walking<br>speed of 1.8 meters per second<br>sorry 1.3 meters per second but the<br>average walking speed of a fit 80 year<br>old woman is 0.8 of a meter per second<br>so she's always going to be two-thirds<br>across the other thing before it changes<br>and you only need some Keen Merchant to<br>want to do a quick left turn and she's<br>in trouble<br>similarly in the 1980s and 1990s the<br>lowest step or the first step you take<br>to get on a bus<br>was eight centimeters higher than the<br>average step for a fit 80 year old woman<br>that's been corrected now and<br>but bus steps are lower and I don't hear<br>any young people complaining about the<br>fact that the bus tips are lower and<br>everyone has has benefited<br>so we need to think about the<br>think about the environment when I was<br>last in Rotorua which was in 2017 it was<br>the year that they<br>they declared themselves the first<br>Dementia friendly city in New Zealand<br>and I'm actually quite Keen to go back<br>there at some stage and see just exactly<br>what that that means<br>what what they've actually done about<br>making it a dementia<br>for a city<br>so I'll leave you with these lines from<br>Ulysses<br>kennison's dramatic monologue<br>which has many many memorable lines in<br>it and I've actually used all<br>experiences in Arch as the as the title<br>from this pardon is the title of my book<br>but here he see his old age hath yet his<br>honor and his toil<br>death closes all<br>something near the end some Noble work<br>of noble note May yet be done<br>and here was the example of Captain Tom<br>Moore aged 99 during the covert setting<br>out to raise a thousand pounds for the<br>NHS by doing the circuits of his house<br>on his Zimmer frame and he raised 35<br>million<br>our next speaker Professor Tim Wilkinson<br>is also a man of immense experience and<br>skill in the geriatric field as a<br>consultant geriatrician for over 30<br>years for jifada Aura Canterbury<br>formerly the Canterbury dhb of course<br>he's a published academic and an<br>academic clinician juggling multiple<br>roles he too is a Toyota a bit of a<br>treasure here at University of otara<br>Christchurch he's one of two of our<br>Deputy Deans on our campus and he's<br>currently acting dean of the otago<br>medical school so very busy man right<br>now he's also Deputy editor of medical<br>education section editor of BMC medical<br>education and a member of the editorial<br>board for focus on health professional<br>education and this australasian journal<br>of Aging amongst his numerous Awards in<br>2016 he received australasia's highest<br>honor for medical education and a<br>university of otago gold medal for<br>I've got one slide and one demonstration<br>to give you so just prepare yourselves<br>so like or not we would like to think<br>that as we get older we get better and<br>we get stronger<br>fitter<br>regrettably that's not the case and<br>sometimes we do lose some muscle<br>strength or our ability to do things as<br>well as we once did<br>now that's okay as long as we can<br>continue to do what we want to do but<br>there can come a stage where we get weak<br>enough that it only takes one thing the<br>last straw that breaks the camel's back<br>and so that can be a problem so we have<br>to think therefore what can we do to<br>keep strong to prevent that last straw<br>being the last straw or if that does<br>happen what happens next so there are a<br>lot of examples we could use of things<br>that get weaker as we get older but one<br>example would be muscle strength so when<br>we're younger if our quadricep strength<br>if I sit down on a chair<br>for my arms I can stand up reasonably<br>easily without too much problem now if I<br>were to get some arthritis or if I was<br>just less active than I once was didn't<br>do as much walking and so on those<br>muscles could get weak and so when I try<br>to get up from a chair I might have to<br>now use my arms just to help me get up<br>and that's okay so I'm still still above<br>the threshold that I need to be to get<br>up from that chair<br>but I might feel like actually I'm not<br>having a great day I'll just rest a bit<br>and look after myself and then the next<br>time you try and do it you try to get up<br>and think<br>oh<br>I could do that yesterday and then you<br>know you might just okay now I can do it<br>okay so you've got to that point where<br>you can just get up and it's it's okay<br>because if you can get up then you can<br>walk and you can keep strong<br>okay so you're down this position and<br>you get a very minor illness so it might<br>be might be a cold it might be pneumonia<br>if Sonic's this minor<br>urine infection and anything like that<br>can have an effect on your strength so<br>when we're younger if we got the flu we<br>would feel a little bit weaker but it<br>wouldn't matter because I could still<br>get up from that chair but if you've got<br>to that stage where you can only just<br>get up from the chair you might find<br>that if you get a very minor almost the<br>last straw that suddenly<br>okay<br>I can't right like it's odd I could do<br>that yesterday<br>so one of The Temptations is to think<br>well<br>my mother always said that if you're<br>feeling we're unwell go to bed<br>you might feel better the next day or<br>just have a rest and you might feel<br>better the next day and that's the Trap<br>because if I spend the rest of the day<br>let's say just sitting thinking<br>hopefully I'll get better tomorrow I<br>might not and in fact I'm probably going<br>to be worse tomorrow because I've done<br>less walking today than I did the day<br>before<br>now<br>uh someone might come along and decide<br>yes I've decided what your problem is<br>you've got this infection I'm going to<br>treat your infection and you should come<br>right<br>so I take some antibiotics or whatever<br>it's going to be and the infection goes<br>away and they're great now I should be<br>able to get up out of this chair<br>but you've had a day or two not doing<br>much and so why do your illnesses got<br>better<br>actually you haven't got stronger<br>and so you're going to need some help to<br>get up and the trap here is to suddenly<br>think well actually what did I expect<br>you know I've got older I knew this day<br>would come I knew that probably one day<br>I wouldn't be able to get up out of the<br>chair looks like today's the day and<br>that's we you don't want to think that<br>so what what needs to happen instead is<br>of course you need to have your illness<br>treated but you also need something to<br>get you more independent so you need<br>some kind of strengthening after that<br>illness to get you up again and that<br>could be physiotherapy it could be<br>exercises or whatever<br>so where why is this a problem well one<br>problem is in hospital<br>so if you're sick enough to get into<br>Hospital<br>there aren't that many there are more<br>beds aren't there than there are chairs<br>regrettably<br>and and you know places are much tidier<br>when people are on a bed<br>but it's a really bad idea it's a really<br>bad idea because if if you're if you're<br>just above that fold where you can only<br>just get up or and now you're just below<br>that just got that last straw<br>then suddenly being in bed is the worst<br>thing that could happen to you they<br>might be giving you very very good<br>treatment<br>fixing the things that brought you into<br>hospital but if you aren't keeping<br>active at the same time then you're not<br>going to get more independent and that's<br>so my key message here is that when you<br>get unwell or when other things happen<br>we have to try and try that little bit<br>harder to get to keep our strength up at<br>the same time try not to spend that time<br>resting in hope that it will get better<br>so how can we do that well you know it's<br>never too early it's never too late so<br>one way we can do that is try and keep<br>the strength up<br>before you get sick so that if you do<br>get sick and you lose a bit of muscle<br>strength it won't matter because you've<br>got yourself stronger so that's so use<br>it or lose it regular walking and so on<br>it will be good if you do happen to get<br>sick<br>try and keep active as much as you can<br>if you can't keep active then you might<br>need to get some help and here's the<br>next trap<br>it's very tempting when people are not<br>feeling well and the older and not able<br>to do things for themselves don't worry<br>I'll do it for you I'll I'll don't you<br>worry I'll get you that I'll do that for<br>you so so if I'm in in the hospital bed<br>can't get up<br>don't worry we'll wheel you where you<br>want to go we'll put you in a wheelchair<br>and we'll use where you want to go<br>that's being very kind well it's not<br>it's not being kind because I'm not<br>going to get any stronger so uh and it's<br>and you know we we want to be kind we<br>want to be supportive but actually what<br>help I need is not in a wheelchair what<br>I need is just someone to give me just a<br>little bit of help just a little bit so<br>that<br>thank you that's that's as much help as<br>I need just as much as I need to get up<br>and go walking because once I'm walking<br>I'll get stronger<br>so give me that much help not more than<br>what I need and not less than what I<br>need so that would be another another<br>message<br>so I've talked about muscle strength but<br>this principle<br>applies to other things as well we'll<br>hear about it later probably with<br>Matthew around the brain but also the<br>you know balance so as we get older<br>sometimes our balance isn't quite so<br>good<br>the best way of keeping your balance is<br>actually to use your balance so the more<br>you use it the the better it will be and<br>that that reduces your chance to Falling<br>bladder control could be another one so<br>you know you can have enough letter<br>control most of the time for most<br>purposes but if you got sick or<br>something then suddenly you might lose<br>bladder control so once again trying to<br>keep the things as strong as you can<br>while you're healthy because when you<br>get sick some of those things get worse<br>and if they get worse you'll start to<br>get into a bit of a vicious cycle<br>so<br>use it or lose it keep strong and if you<br>get sick and you find yourself not able<br>to do what you used to be able to do<br>don't let someone kill you with kindness<br>give them and let them give you enough<br>help but not too much help and that will<br>help you keep stronger in the older age<br>thank you<br>wonderful advice thanks so much Tim now<br>Lee O'Brien it is next up welcome to Lee<br>She's a registered dietitian currently<br>working in private practice here in<br>Christchurch she graduated from otago in<br>2003 with a bachelor in human nutrition<br>and then she got her post-grad diploma<br>and dietetics with honors she's many<br>published nutritional research papers to<br>her name with a particular focus on how<br>the low FODMAP diet affects the lives of<br>patients the role of nutrition and<br>dementia prevention and management<br>nutrition and malnutrition in the<br>elderly irritable bowel synodrome and<br>she's also an expert in the facts and<br>myths surrounding food and diabetes and<br>respiratory disease and COPD<br>Lee's also really passionate about<br>helping patients get better results by<br>combining personalized nutrition with a<br>contemporary dietary management approach<br>I just don't feel hungry or I don't<br>think I could eat any more I hear this<br>all the time when I go and visit<br>residents and aged care have lost weight<br>and they're right they don't feel hungry<br>why is that though it's not because<br>you've suddenly just got old it's<br>actually because it's the process of<br>Aging so when we're around about 28 30 a<br>body starts to change unfortunately and<br>we don't tend to notice that until we<br>get to our 40s or 50s but we<br>particularly start to notice it when we<br>get older so as we're aging a body is<br>losing muscle and we've heard our<br>important that is from Tim<br>but we're also gaining fat and that<br>change in our body composition changes<br>our metabolism and it actually means<br>that we become<br>metabolism slows down and we become less<br>hungry<br>and the problem with that of course is<br>that we still need to eat because if we<br>don't eat we lose weight and then the<br>problem with losing weight is we lose<br>muscle<br>and when we lose muscle<br>and Metabolism goes down and then we get<br>less hungry so it becomes a bit of a<br>vicious cycle<br>for our body needs less food when we get<br>older but we still need to eat<br>when we get older we actually need more<br>protein so this becomes a bit of a<br>challenge less food more protein so<br>protein are the foods that help our<br>muscles stay strong<br>and the importance around that is that<br>our muscles help our joints stay stable<br>help us stay on our feet help us stay<br>strong<br>so somebody over the age of 70 needs<br>more protein than anyone else of any<br>other for any other age group<br>and the really important thing about<br>that also is that the other sucky thing<br>about getting older is that our body's<br>not so good at absorbing some of their<br>you know the stuff from food there we<br>need to keep us healthy and protein is<br>one of those things so it's we're not as<br>good at taking all the protein from one<br>meal and absorbing it and getting it<br>into our muscles we actually need to<br>have protein throughout the day<br>so summer breakfast some at lunch some<br>at dinner breakfast is usually okay<br>lunch if you're anything like my dad who<br>would have a tomato sandwich and maybe a<br>cup of soup if he was lucky not so great<br>and dinner usually takes care of itself<br>so protein every meal time is<br>particularly important and then the<br>other thing that's really important to<br>help that protein get into our muscles<br>and to make our muscles stay strong and<br>to keep our metabolism up is exercise so<br>we know being active is really important<br>but being doing some sort of resistant<br>exercise a couple of times a week at<br>least helps our muscles also<br>so in New Zealand<br>we might think that the most common<br>foods that we eat to provide protein is<br>we get older as meat but actually for<br>our older age adults in New Zealand<br>bread and milk are the two main food<br>sources that keep us that provide the<br>bulk of our protein so when we get old<br>um<br>is not the time to be thinking about<br>doing any crazy diet low carb diet or<br>dairy-free diet because these two foods<br>provide a lot of the protein that we<br>need throughout the day<br>so enable protein but we also need more<br>calcium<br>so as an older person we need 25 more<br>than someone who's pregnant and that's<br>because like with protein calcium we<br>don't absorb it as much as when um when<br>we age we need it obviously for bones<br>and for our teeth but we actually need<br>calcium every day to keep our muscles<br>working and to keep our nerves working<br>so if we're not getting enough through<br>our diet guess where we get it from<br>our bones absolutely so one of the<br>things we can do throughout our lifespan<br>is try and maximize the time of our life<br>when our bones are zapping all the<br>calcium out of food which has pretty<br>much had teenagers uh child through<br>childhood through teenage years early<br>adulthood by the time we get to kind of<br>mid-20s onwards our bones don't absorb<br>the calcium as well any longer but we<br>still need calcium every day if we don't<br>get enough from what we're eating then<br>our bones will uh body will take it from<br>so in New Zealand older adults get a lot<br>of their calcium from bread<br>and from milk and also from cheese<br>so therefore also not a great time<br>between not eating those Foods or trying<br>to find Foods where you can<br>um get Pro get your calcium from<br>the other thing we need more of when we<br>get older is vitamin D<br>vitamin D is a bit harder to get from<br>food there's not many good sources of<br>food that are high in vitamin D so we do<br>need to you know get outside when we get<br>older which works and really well with<br>what Tim was saying also getting out and<br>being active walking around making the<br>most of the sunlight when we have it<br>a lot of people in New Zealand also a<br>lot of people south of Marlborough and<br>New Zealand probably going to have quite<br>low levels of vitamin D over the winter<br>time but as we age our body is not so<br>good at getting that vitamin D from the<br>Sun so if you're not spending a lot of<br>time outside or if you've been unwell<br>it's probably a good time to talk to<br>your GP about whether he thinks or she<br>thinks of vitamin D supplement might be<br>a good idea for you<br>so we need more vitamin D than our<br>Little Tots do who are growing their<br>bones<br>so the big take-home messages is that to<br>stay healthy as we age we do rely on<br>what we do when we're younger so when<br>we're younger we have those<br>opportunities to<br>um to fill our bones with calcium to<br>keep our muscles strong and be aware<br>that as we age we are going to be<br>needing a little bit less food than what<br>we do when we're older but that<br>importance of food that's going to<br>provide us with the calcium and with the<br>protein that we need more of when we're<br>aging<br>the other really important thing is that<br>there can be a bit of a downward spiral<br>that can happen really quickly like Tim<br>was saying when people get unwell or<br>they have periods of not being able to<br>get out of bed one of the first things<br>that go down is people's food intake in<br>those periods of time when you're not<br>eating so well<br>can really drive that muscle loss and<br>therefore have impact on your weight<br>so worrying about how we look it's not a<br>great thing to be thinking about as we<br>age we should be worrying about how we<br>feel and how how our body is is coping<br>I just want to illustrate this before I<br>leave with this little story about a<br>almost 100 year old that I met in in a<br>rescue a restaurant that I was asked to<br>go and see this lady yet she had been<br>losing some weight for about probably<br>about six weeks and so the nurses wanted<br>me to come and find out what was going<br>on so I had a wee chat to her gorgeously<br>lady she was about to turn 100. she<br>realized the dress that she wanted to<br>wear didn't quite fit and so she decided<br>to put herself on a diet<br>so I was quite relieved in a way<br>thinking okay well at least he's nothing<br>Sinister happening with her but the<br>reality of that was is that every day<br>that she chose to eat a little bit eat a<br>little bit less her body was taking a<br>hit from there so her 100th birthday<br>came and went she looked gorgeous of<br>course she got a letter from the then<br>Queen<br>um beautiful leaders from the cream back<br>then too and she proudly had to spend<br>her in her room but I was asked to go<br>and see her about two months later<br>because she was still losing weight and<br>what had happened was that initial<br>intentional period of wanting to lose<br>weight so she looked good was actually<br>having a bit of an um the negative<br>effect now where she had just lost her<br>appetite she just didn't feel like<br>eating any longer and it was a real<br>battle to try and get that weight loss<br>to reverse so<br>please don't be tempted when you're<br>reaching your 100th birthday to feel<br>like I need to fit into that dress I'm<br>going to cut out the calves today I know<br>that will help me lose weight no that's<br>not a good idea think of me on that day<br>and me pointing my finger at you going<br>no you must eat your bread you must<br>drink your milk and enjoy your food as<br>long as you can thank you<br>thanks so much Lee well our final<br>speaker this evening is Dr Matthew<br>Crouch and our Matthew is a clinical<br>psychiatrist of old age and Senior<br>clinical lecturer for both the<br>University of otago Christchurch<br>anti-farter or Canterbury he's a founder<br>and director of tifara or Canterbury<br>Psychiatry of old age academic unit and<br>leads the South Island Regional dementia<br>initiative Matthew received a specialist<br>training in Christchurch and Oxford in<br>the UK and his main academic interests<br>are Workforce training outcomes<br>measurement and better use of<br>antipsychotic medications on campus he's<br>responsible for fourth year medical<br>student Psychiatry teaching and Masters<br>course teaching in the Psychiatry of old<br>age he chairs at New Zealand dementia<br>Foundation has been a key driver for a<br>national dementia plan for Iota Row in<br>New Zealand Advocate strongly for<br>post-diagnostic support and generally<br>seizes every opportunity to speak out<br>about dementia and better medical and<br>caring support for those affected by it<br>foreign<br>thanks very much for the introduction<br>and security<br>I was so thrilled to hear that it's now<br>reached the state taking a treasure to<br>him but I I can't really claim to being<br>a treasure I've always thought that Tim<br>was a treasure but I am an old age<br>shrink which means that I'm a specialist<br>kind of from the neck up<br>and thinking about dementia as you've<br>heard from Laura Lee is one of the<br>things that I spend a lot of my time<br>doing and there will be more than one<br>person in this room that is kind of a<br>little bit interested in the question of<br>it could I prevent myself possibly from<br>developing a dementia dementia is kind<br>of a new cancer<br>thing that you really really don't want<br>and that you might be ashamed to tell<br>and that's Studies have shown not just<br>my opinion you know it's it's become<br>stigmatized and very feared thing<br>but I want to sell you on the idea that<br>dementia prevention is not what you<br>should be thinking about<br>not what I prefer to think about<br>promoting brain health is a much better<br>thing to think about and much more in<br>line with what we're talking about<br>tonight with healthy aging<br>and one reason why that's true is<br>because most of the method that I might<br>try and convince you about might help us<br>to prevent Dementia or to lower our risk<br>of developing dementia are actually<br>positive things that you can do they're<br>not things to avoid they're things to do<br>so they're positives that's one reason<br>why thinking about healthy brain aging<br>might be better than thinking about<br>dementia prevention<br>but it's also important because dementia<br>prevention stuff well it also works for<br>stroke prevention in the name it also<br>works for prevention in the main it also<br>works for Parkinson's disease prevention<br>in the main it's a kind of<br>group of behaviors and things that we<br>can do that are just great for our<br>brains so there's another reason not to<br>be thinking dementia prevention is sort<br>of a topic that we really need to focus<br>on in our own lives<br>actually it's pretty good for your body<br>too some of these same things are also<br>great cancer prevention diabetes<br>prevention they're just good for you<br>another reason why it's not so good<br>thinking about dementia prevention is<br>that it's really hard to maintain our<br>motivation to change our lives by being<br>scared of something<br>it's much easier to maintain some<br>positive energy to make changes in our<br>lives if we're trying to head for<br>something that's better<br>rather than avoiding something that's<br>worserer<br>also I think that focus on brain health<br>is really helpful because it means that<br>if I do cross the line and one day I<br>develop a dementia illness I don't have<br>to stop doing them because it's too late<br>it's never too late to do things that<br>can help our brain to be as as healthy<br>as it can possibly be even if I am<br>living with a dementia illness so I've<br>convinced you<br>all right let's think about all the<br>different things that are really<br>important brain health noting that these<br>are actually just important for health<br>and well-being in general<br>at the top of the league table are two<br>things it by his end diet and it's no<br>surprise that they're there I hope to<br>all of and from tonight's talk I hope<br>that we're becoming convinced they're<br>exercising diet are at the top of the<br>lead table<br>we've claimed it's never too early and<br>never too late so let's actually try and<br>think about some things that we could be<br>doing early in our lives<br>if we're just newbies at this aging<br>thing<br>and run through these five factors but<br>let's also think about things that it<br>would never be too late to be doing if<br>we're actually experts at aging sitting<br>in this room we've been doing the Aging<br>thing for a long time so let's run<br>through these and think so never too<br>early what about exercise well you've<br>heard a lot from from Lee in particular<br>about the importance of building up<br>reserves you know for our bones for<br>example so when we're young we want to<br>be as fit as possible and build up our<br>reserves well some of this is important<br>for brain health as well and one of the<br>key things is getting our cardiovascular<br>fitness as good as it can be when we're<br>younger but another very important<br>factor is educating our brain as much as<br>possible when we are younger we<br>shouldn't stop of course but when we're<br>young our brains are very plastic as<br>anyone who has tried to learn a second<br>or third language after the age of 25 no<br>it's a good deal harder than it seems to<br>what about diet well here I think the<br>main thing is to be building up when<br>we're young<br>habit of a balanced diet<br>moving away from a habit of a restricted<br>diet<br>when it comes to what's good for the<br>heart the key thing is that from midlife<br>on so from 30s on if I can generously<br>bring the 30 year olds into the audience<br>into middle life<br>it's it from that age onwards you're<br>going for your annual or your every<br>two-year well-person checkups with the<br>GP and you know what your blood pressure<br>is and you know what your cholesterol is<br>and you know that your sugars are in<br>good control and you know that all of<br>that is sorted so it's kind of like<br>picking up the Bonnet and having along<br>saying you're doing quite well you might<br>want to tweak that off you go it's doing<br>that for midlife and getting those<br>practices well into place<br>avoiding toxins if there was one I would<br>pick from early life it is cigarettes<br>General Health<br>I was to round up a group of 30 to 50<br>year olds and say there's one thing that<br>I'd really like you to concentrate on<br>with your General Health<br>because we can all understand really<br>Crook in any part of my body might not<br>be great for my brain an old age so we<br>get there but what what would the thing<br>be it would be to learn different ways<br>of managing stress more effectively in<br>your life<br>and as we all know it's not just about<br>me learning ways of dealing with stress<br>better sometimes it's about me learning<br>what's not putting myself in situations<br>which are undeniably going to stress me<br>out<br>sometimes you've just got to get out of<br>a bad situation and no amount of<br>meditation at six in the morning will<br>help you to cope with it better it's<br>just crappy and you have to stop doing<br>it<br>use it or lose it what would my what<br>would my message be to younger people<br>it's make sure you're socially really<br>it's never too late folks exercise<br>if you round up a group of 90 year olds<br>and take them literally to the gym<br>they will put on muscle mass<br>which they can see in the mirror<br>it's never too late this is good for<br>brain health and dementia prevention<br>diet<br>when we're getting into our third age of<br>life<br>we need to develop cooking habits that<br>we can do so those of us that are pretty<br>useless in the kitchen it's time to<br>learn how<br>and that we will do<br>we need to develop cooking habits that<br>we can and will do so buying Julia<br>Child's thousand page cookbook and<br>making our way through it is not the<br>answer but we need to find things that<br>we will actually do and we can actually<br>do so that when I'm now living perhaps<br>alone and I'm 87<br>that's not when I'm forced to be<br>learning how to put<br>and eat well<br>when it comes to the heart things change<br>when we're younger we're trying to get<br>our blood pressure down if it's high but<br>when we're older we're trying to hit a<br>sweet spot where it's neither too low<br>nor too high<br>so the emphasis changes a bit<br>toxins<br>what toxin would I most focus on in old<br>age<br>you might be expecting me to say alcohol<br>because at all ages in this country we<br>drink more than we need to but actually<br>men I'm going to say did you realize<br>that the main cause of head injury in<br>older New Zealander it's like it is in<br>younger new zealanders sports<br>dangerous driving and fighting it's<br>in terms of our General Health it's<br>about that repeated chicks with the<br>doctor I'm going to go and see my doctor<br>every six months now I'm going to change<br>I'm going to see my GP every three<br>months whether I need to or not because<br>I've got a bit of this and I've got a<br>bit of that and I've got a bit of the<br>other and why would I want any of those<br>to be getting a bit worse in a way that<br>might threaten my brain well the answer<br>is I wouldn't<br>and finally use it or lose it the<br>surprise here folks is<br>that when we are told Always by our<br>partner or family members that perhaps<br>our hearing isn't as good as it used to<br>be<br>or perhaps we're squinting just a little<br>bit more than we used to<br>the Temptation is to say but I can it's<br>good enough it's good enough I don't<br>need that hearing aid I don't need those<br>progressive lenses it's good enough<br>we now know that if you've got some<br>hearing impairment and if you've got<br>some visual impairment and you correct<br>them<br>this helps prevent your risk of going on<br>to develop dementia so there's another<br>reason ladies and gentlemen to be<br>attending to those things not just for<br>your hearing and not just for your<br>eyesight<br>my final message about the brain aging<br>is just to point out never too early nip<br>too late is to point out that<br>an approach in this country that you may<br>have heard of the whanau order approach<br>to thinking about health and well-being<br>is great for all of us<br>in the two words whanau and Order Health<br>and Family if you like to to think of<br>simple English translation<br>captures some of the essence of what's<br>good for all of us<br>easier to focus on staying as well as<br>possible than it is to focus on trying<br>to cope with a an illness once we've got<br>it and it's much easier to focus on<br>those things with the whole of the<br>family<br>backing us doing it together<br>then it is just trying to battle on and<br>we'd solve it's really never too late<br>because we'd all be doing it all the<br>time<br>and we solve that I need this diet but<br>you guys are having that diet I need<br>this exercise but you guys are you know<br>doing your own we'd actually be working<br>on these things<br>together there's a lot to learn from<br>thinking about a final order approach<br>ladies and gentlemen I've tried to tell<br>you<br>yeah instead of thinking about dementia<br>prevention I'd love you to think about<br>brain health promotion<br>I'd like you to think that it's<br>multimodal it's not one thing it's not<br>about Sudoku it's about a whole way of<br>living in a healthier<br>healthier lifestyle I've tried to<br>convince it's never too early to start<br>doing this stuff but also that it's<br>never too late and finally I've tried to<br>convince you that you should do it with<br>your family thank you very much<br>thank you<br>thank you Matthew gosh so much to think<br>about<br>we're doing well for time so I know many<br>of you will have some burning questions<br>for our experts here Alex here is going<br>to have a microphone to pass around to<br>anyone who wants to ask a question<br>and while you're thinking of one up<br>anyone got a burning one to start with<br>I can think of one start with one for<br>you Matthew seeing the menopause for 20<br>years how do you know not that I'm<br>asking personally or anything how do you<br>know whether you're getting<br>foggy brain from that or you're getting<br>early onset dementia<br>all of us will experience changes in all<br>parts of their body including how our<br>brains work<br>weren't we<br>I already have what I would consider to<br>be moments that I didn't have when I was<br>less senior than I currently am<br>although I hasten to add that I think<br>that my brain is pretty full now and it<br>wasn't nearly this full when I was 20.<br>and there are many causes menopause is<br>one or is it the stress that I'm under<br>or is it that I've just had covered or<br>what is it or is it that I'm 80 you know<br>what is the difference between a change<br>that I've noticed or someone else has<br>noticed with my memory and brain power<br>and the beginning of a dementia illness<br>there's a line in the sand between the<br>two which is very helpful and the line<br>and the sand is this is it affecting<br>and walking into the living room and<br>or trying to find the car keys and being<br>really annoyed that you can't find them<br>I assure you are things that my 18 year<br>old currently does but he his first<br>thought is not am I developing<br>Alzheimer's disease it's dead what have<br>so I just want to reframe it those are<br>not enough<br>if the cognitive changes that you think<br>are there are not affecting your<br>day-to-day function don't worry about it<br>but think about brain health stuff<br>anyway don't wait for the second and the<br>third time you've lost your cell phone<br>to think about brain health just do that<br>and then don't worry about the second or<br>the third time you've lost your cell<br>phone and I'll let you off the hook with<br>here this gentleman over here<br>can I ask you two questions<br>did they say quick ones one is for my<br>old family in another country in a<br>totalitarian regime well maybe<br>authoritarian but towards totalitarian<br>is it in regards to the positive<br>thinking they because they are under the<br>censorship they um they are afraid to<br>freedom of speech even you want to<br>promote freedom of switch wisdom there<br>they hate that discourse and they<br>believe that the<br>prosperity of the country is the<br>premises of the existence of family<br>so I think they are in the not healthy<br>way of thinking I'm trying to convey a<br>more lean well enlightened one but they<br>think I am the rotten one so it's kind<br>of in like a trap of the relativism trap<br>you know what I'm talking about<br>so I'm trying to correct that but it<br>seems that they're in the black house I<br>want to shed light into that but they<br>think I'm pointing poisoning themselves<br>so what should I do and my second<br>question is that um what would be the uh<br>Effective Thinking Tools or philosophy<br>wants to overcome the fear of death<br>not the process<br>but the the final state that I will<br>vanish<br>my ego will disappear eternally<br>yeah I was looking at him he was looking<br>at me fear of death well first of all<br>it's a natural human thing you know one<br>of the things that distinguishes humans<br>is that we can plan if we'll see the<br>future plan for the future remember the<br>past<br>and that of course gives us a lot of<br>strengths but it also makes us worry<br>because we can see what's going to<br>happen uh so that's it's part of being<br>human that we worry about what might<br>happen to us<br>I think my advice about uh planning of<br>thinking about death is is just to plan<br>um and and to talk to your relatives<br>about what you think a good death might<br>be<br>because not everyone's got the same view<br>about that<br>you know I've got quite a friend of mine<br>who said that I'd like to be like to die<br>by being shot by a jealous lover at the<br>age<br>um<br>but that may not be everyone's view of a<br>good death<br>but I think talking to your relatives<br>talking to the people who care for you<br>what would a good death mean for me<br>where would I want to be what would what<br>would I give up to keep alive what would<br>I not worry about to keep alive what's<br>what's it what is it worth it what's<br>worth it for me so that would be my<br>advice<br>yes I think it's the<br>you know the concept of conveying to<br>those around us just what what we see is<br>the best wave<br>to leave the Earth and I think<br>needs to be clearly conveyed one of the<br>things that does worry me is a situation<br>that I'm aware of at the moment where a<br>very elderly woman who has expressed a<br>desire to die<br>is in a terminal care situation<br>but despite her wishes because of<br>conflicting views of the family<br>she is being treated with antibiotics<br>for a temperature<br>which no one knows quite where it comes<br>from<br>and we've got the sort of this is the<br>sort of thing that concerns concerns me<br>the<br>confusion that can sometimes occur which<br>is all very much a matter of<br>communication<br>so obviously there's been the enactment<br>of the um<br>of David Seymour's Act<br>but<br>more than that I think we need to think<br>about<br>death in those people who are not having<br>assisted dying but who were just<br>pushing to pass away naturally we don't<br>get things wrong there<br>and<br>um<br>that an area that<br>sometimes traditionally<br>medical people or not MediCal people<br>Health people have been unable to<br>recognize the fact that the person is<br>dying<br>the<br>that the emphasis should change<br>now we should never use the Expression<br>cease active treatment<br>because terminal care are done properly<br>is very very active treatment indeed<br>continuing monitoring of symptoms and so<br>on and so forth so<br>it's not really ceasing active treatment<br>come on guys don't be shy over<br>yeah there were three topics I thought<br>you may have had some comments about<br>um and they are and if you've got some<br>quick comments now sleep<br>um meditation and fasting<br>um yes very interesting topics<br>um so I'll just briefly talk about the<br>fasting side of it I think the research<br>around fasting is pretty dicey to be<br>fair it it probably may be beneficial if<br>you started that practice of fasting<br>when you're much younger rather than you<br>know in your third age and think that<br>that might be a good time to start<br>something like that I think the risk of<br>doing something like that at that time<br>really puts you compromises your body<br>puts you at risk of<br>unintended weight loss which is<br>something we don't want to be having at<br>that age<br>um yeah so I think as we get older we<br>really should be thinking more about<br>less about restricting food and more<br>about thinking about food is is your<br>medicine what you can do to you know eat<br>well to keep your brain and your body<br>working well so um that's my bit on<br>fasting you said you wanna meditation is<br>something that I'm happy to speak to<br>um briefly and so from the science<br>perspective which is a not a great way<br>of thinking about meditation but<br>nonetheless meditative practices have<br>been studied and their outcomes have<br>been studied to a limited degree<br>and there's no doubt that some<br>meditative practices have scientific<br>proof If you like of benefits in terms<br>of General Health benefits and specific<br>benefits for the management of stress<br>and there's also no doubt that that all<br>of the major religious traditions in the<br>world include practices<br>um in their strands although not in<br>every<br>aspect of them but somewhere in every<br>major religious tradition there are<br>strong meditative practices so we could<br>look to culture in spirituality for a<br>different type of evidence that this is<br>a good thing in your life for health and<br>well-being that doesn't mean that you<br>all need to rush out and go to a<br>particular practitioner or a particular<br>Guru but you do need to find a way of<br>being in the present moment and bring<br>still these are healthy things but how<br>or just the mention of sleep brings us<br>to a topic which we really haven't<br>covered<br>and that is medication<br>and this is a major issue in<br>in older persons health<br>and in particular with sleep and<br>sleeping tablets and hypnotics and we<br>really want to stress that<br>the habit of reaching for a prescription<br>and giving hypnotic is is not<br>people are vulnerable to the effects of<br>these medications<br>and they contribute to force and so on<br>one of the things about medication is I<br>I should have had it in the planning and<br>that is the importance of regular review<br>of medication<br>now the three monthly review of<br>medication for older people particularly<br>those in Rest Homes and private<br>hospitals is all too often seen as an<br>administrative bore and sure<br>but it isn't it what it should happen is<br>that each medication should be looked at<br>and the following questions asked is<br>this medication still needed<br>yes no<br>and if it is is this dose still needed<br>because there are many medications where<br>if it may still be required but the dose<br>could be modified particularly peoples<br>so medication review is something that I<br>really should have put on my on my<br>planning slide<br>I'd add a third one free medication<br>what's it treating<br>you should everyone should be able to<br>answer that question and is it working<br>you know it's treating my blood pressure<br>my blood pressure is still high<br>so is your blood is it is this the right<br>pill is it lowering is this one are you<br>lower is your blood pressure lower with<br>this one or not would be a question to<br>ask<br>somebody down here is that right this<br>but exercises usually your legs how<br>important is upper body exercises for<br>women particularly<br>yeah I mean<br>the leg one is just an example but yeah<br>actually of course using everything uh<br>is keeping everything ticking over is is<br>good for you but there are two that are<br>particularly important strength and<br>balance because they are really good<br>ways of preventing fools and and the<br>trap that people can have is a feeling<br>that's wobbly or but or they've had a<br>fall<br>then the natural thing to do is to start<br>to avoid things avoid walking avoid<br>things that require balance and that can<br>set up that vicious cycle<br>pick one exercise it would be walking<br>because that gives you strength and<br>balance<br>thank you I just wanted to ask<br>um with respect to exercise should one<br>do it at home or would is should one go<br>um uh whatever whatever you like doing<br>but I think that what I would suggest is<br>is try and build it into your routine so<br>um I think like a bit like what Matthew<br>said as soon as you start making<br>something feel like a bit of a chore to<br>make to try and prevent something it is<br>a bit demotivating oh I've got to do my<br>exercises otherwise something will<br>happen<br>I I prefer to think of it like<br>um rather than get the newspaper<br>delivered why don't I walk to the<br>supermarket every day to buy the<br>newspaper or before I have my lunch I'll<br>make sure I walk around the block<br>something that build into your team<br>that's where you know a dog can be quite<br>useful to take the dog for a walk but<br>becomes part of doing something else it<br>makes it much more of a habit and then<br>of course because we are social beings<br>and having our social connection is good<br>so if you've got a friend to walk with<br>us even better because then you're<br>we just got time for a couple more quick<br>questions a gentleman down here Alex<br>thank you<br>I'm thinking about planning<br>and if you're planning and you decide I<br>do not want to be resuscitated<br>then how's the best way to relay that to<br>the medical fraternity so you are not<br>resuscitated<br>first of all with your GP<br>secondly when you come into Hospital<br>these days you will be asked what your<br>opinion is about that<br>people sometimes some people have what<br>they call<br>Advanced directives or living wills<br>which say<br>um<br>which specify not necessarily about CPR<br>but other but other things as well<br>and make sure that those that are that<br>are looking after you<br>um and know about this of course the the<br>the problem is the person that collapses<br>on the High Street because uh<br>automatically the people people will<br>will get will get started and unless<br>you've got something on a tattoo or or a<br>band or something like that people will<br>commence until the ambulance people come<br>but in hospitals and rest homes and<br>things like this you're very careful<br>these days to ask what people's opinions<br>are<br>as far as living wills are concerned we<br>just need to be a little bit careful<br>about those because<br>it's very difficult to cover every<br>medical contingency<br>CPR is a specific event you could say I<br>don't want that but but there are all<br>sorts of other sort of<br>scenario medical scenarios that people<br>come up with<br>and even if a person's got a living will<br>in the notes I've always taken<br>to them if they if they're able to<br>communicate saying I see that you've got<br>a living will in your notes you have<br>developed a pneumonia now<br>under ordinary circumstances we would we<br>would put up a drip and put some<br>antibiotics in but<br>um I see that does your do you still<br>hold to that view that that you've<br>expressed<br>you need to do need to check because as<br>well as<br>not being able to cover every<br>contingency people do change their minds<br>and there's an old Mexican saying that<br>the character of the ball changes when<br>it enters the ring<br>and so we do find people who've got<br>quite clear specific<br>examples of of advanced directives who<br>actually<br>go the other way when when it actually<br>when time actually comes so we we as as<br>house professionals we have to respect<br>that but I always discuss it again with<br>I mean I think the other thing I'd say<br>is is because you can't plan for<br>everything just talk to your friends and<br>relatives about what you think is<br>important to you because that'll help<br>guide so you know that in my life these<br>are things that I've always valued<br>really highly I've not cared about that<br>too much that can often help if you<br>can't make decisions for yourself just<br>knowing that sort of thing can help<br>people make what they think is the best<br>decision in your interest and just the<br>final thing<br>um you know I think our health<br>professionals are getting much much<br>better at asking people whether they<br>want to be resuscitated or not it used<br>to be quite a difficult thing you know<br>you know we just met you we're going to<br>do all the best we can to get you better<br>but by the way uh you know if you if you<br>happen to die suddenly what would you<br>like us to do you know there's a bit of<br>a mixed message going on there so there<br>has been a bit of a reluctance but<br>health professionals are much better at<br>tackling those questions now but what<br>would help is if if you wanted to<br>volunteer that conversation because that<br>would make their life easier it still so<br>don't be bashful about mentioning it<br>first<br>very good advice I think guys um one<br>more quick question one more question<br>okay so there's your microphone just cut<br>out there sorry so it was how often<br>should you get the Bloods done<br>yeah<br>anyone<br>yeah<br>depends<br>um I mean cholesterol doesn't change<br>that often uh so you know you when<br>you're young you'd probably want to get<br>it done but if it's okay you could wait<br>for quite a few years<br>diabetes doesn't come on over well I can<br>come on overnight but it doesn't tend to<br>come over on overnight as you get older<br>tends to creep up on you so I'm going to<br>go sort of roughly once a year but<br>that's probably when you're getting a<br>bit hyper need to be that frequent when<br>right um look that was<br>as I say if you've got an absolutely<br>burning question<br>um the chaps and Lee will be here for a<br>little bit longer<br>um before we all dish off but look I'd<br>like to very much thank all of you for<br>coming along I hope you've managed to<br>glean some good information about how to<br>use it before you lose it and um and you<br>know welcome the years that are coming<br>up with some renewed uh sense of<br>confidence and how you can self-manage<br>and retain Independence we've had some<br>wonderful advice and I'd like to thank<br>the very much<br>thank<br>um Professor Tim Wilkinson Miracles<br>Professor dick sainsbury Lee O'Brien and<br>Dr Matthew Croucher for their
