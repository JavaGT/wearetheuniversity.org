Although the response from Zespri, the New Zealand kiwifruit industry, and the government was swift and comprehensive, Psa almost destroyed the industry. Today, for most of us Psa is a distant memory. In this seminar I will explain why Psa was so destructive at the beginning of the outbreak and why today it is not a major limiting factor for kiwifruit production. Reviewing the different options available today for the control of Psa, we will evaluate the risk that Psa becomes again a major problem for the New Zealand kiwifruit industry. I will also present some of our research programmes which aim at the long-term control of this pathogen.<br><br>Joel Vanneste was involved in the New Zealand response to the Psa outbreak from the very beginning of the epidemic, working alongside Zespri, KVH and MPI. His laboratory worked on understanding the taxonomy, ecology and epidemiology of Psa in order to find ways of controlling this pathogen. Today, he is studying the spread of antibiotic and copper resistance in bacterial populations associated with kiwifruit plants and the role of the plant microbiome on disease incidence.</p><h2>Transcript</h2><p style="opacity: 0.9; font-size: 0.8em">Transcripts may be automatically generated and may not be 100% accurate.</p><p>um<br>and uh apologies first of all kicking<br>off yeah<br>um we had a few room issues here with a<br>room we had booked was already in<br>progress with the lecture hardly<br>rearrange rooms and um so yeah apologies<br>for the late start but we're very lucky<br>today to have Dr Joel The Nest from<br>plant and food research as our speaker<br>joelle's been working on kiwi fruit<br>disease he's a bacteriologist a flat<br>bacteriologist who's been working on<br>kiwifruit disease and specifically PSA<br>for many years now he's a very<br>distinguished scientist and won the<br>prime minister's prize for science<br>number<br>yeah um and so with our team and the<br>seaweed team has been doing some work<br>really lucky to have you all today I<br>will pass it over to him<br>okay<br>okay well thank you very much thanks for<br>the introduction and thanks also for the<br>invitation to come here to uh to taronga<br>to talk about something close to my<br>heart so I'm not serious<br>PSA which is a bacteria which we've been<br>working for many years<br>so and great also to have the<br>opportunity to come here to Tauranga so<br>because of course I work in Hamilton<br>and what happens when you come from<br>Hamilton to Tauranga you drive over to<br>kaimai and when you arrive in both<br>plenty in the heart of the Cupid<br>industry what you see you see this<br>no<br>oh it's not working sorry I have to stay<br>here you'll see<br>it's not working either<br>so<br>this is working no it's not working<br>sorry<br>um<br>yes okay so I have to try enough to stay<br>okay<br>okay oh yes yes thank you very much yeah<br>so so when you when you drive over the<br>Kmart in your life plenty you see that<br>sign<br>and if you know nothing about PSA<br>tells you PSA whatever it is it's scary<br>it is frightened it's something that's<br>frightening the industry and then you<br>look at the sign and you see all the<br>Moss and all the Likens they say well<br>clearly people don't care about it<br>anymore<br>it's over<br>it tells you well PSA whatever it was<br>has been solved it was yesterday's<br>problem and what I'd like to do in the<br>seminar is to see with you whether PSA<br>actually has been solved is it actually<br>yes to the storage<br>so what is PSA well KSA is a bacterium<br>that was first found in Japan in 1989<br>then in Korea in 1992 and Italy 1992 it<br>caused a number of symptoms on kiwi<br>fruits and the symptoms are quite varied<br>you have cankers with production of a<br>red exudite you have discoloration of<br>the tissue underneath the bark<br>you have production of Excellence which<br>is that that's a drop here you see so<br>this is bacteria pure bacter culture<br>coming out of the tissue because the<br>tissue are so full of the bacteria<br>you find that also on tissue which do<br>not show any of the symptoms you have<br>here a job of exudate on some flowers<br>you have birds that do not develop in<br>Spring<br>you have changed<br>and ultimately you lose your options<br>all those pictures were taken in Italy<br>in 2009<br>before 2009 you would not you would not<br>have found any of the symptoms<br>even though the pathogen had been found<br>there in 1992. and the question is why<br>which in 1992 and 2009 we didn't see any<br>of those symptoms in Key Food Orchard in<br>Italy<br>so clearly the the environment was the<br>same it was eaten Latina south of Rome<br>the genetic component from the plant<br>sorry it was the same genotypes it is<br>cultivar they were growing before so<br>could it be that the pathogen had<br>evolved that the pathogens somehow was<br>slightly different so we went to Italy<br>and got some some of the pathogen and we<br>compare them with PSA that had been<br>isolated from Japan and Korea or Italy<br>in 1992. to characterize those strains<br>we did what's called The Box PCR when<br>you have one primer that binds a<br>different area around your chromosome by<br>PCR you'll have a number of amplica on<br>different sizes and when you run them on<br>the gel you have a profile and that<br>profile will be characteristic of this<br>train or or a group of strike and doing<br>so we found that all the strains of PSA<br>from Italy after 2009 share the same<br>profile and that profile was different<br>from the one from Japan and Korea<br>when we sequence few genes that are used<br>in some necessary for taxonomy purposes<br>and that is the particular the CTS genes<br>we find that all those Trends from Japan<br>and Korea have the same sequence for<br>that CTS genes and all those Trends from<br>Italy had a different sequence two<br>differences so we call those trains<br>CTS Apple type A it was for Asia clearly<br>and the other one CTS popular type I<br>for each other<br>and it is really the strange from CTS<br>the product I that cause all that<br>destruction in italics<br>all that destruction in 2009<br>over all that started earlier it started<br>basically in 2008 when the only visible<br>sign of an upcoming outbreak was few<br>Leaf spots and shoot across Flags<br>so now in November 2010 when in New<br>Zealand we found Fury spots and few<br>nickels flowers it was whoa and we knew<br>it was PSL the question was then do we<br>have the Apple type they have in Asia<br>which might not be such a big problem or<br>do we have the Apple type they had in<br>Italy so we went and collected some<br>strains and did the Box pcrs we did<br>before so we have here the profile for<br>the students from Asia here the profile<br>from the strings from italish and all<br>those trains here were from New Zealand<br>and they can be into groups one group<br>here are the same profile as a<br>transformation and that was bad news<br>but then we had that group of strains<br>here<br>that are the profile which is different<br>from the one from Italy and the one from<br>Asia<br>and we knew that all those trains were<br>actually PSA based on the PCR uh<br>treatment we had we developed the<br>primary developed before so as far as we<br>knew this was all PSA now we knew that<br>those trains<br>share<br>would destroy your Orchards and<br>inoculated on young plants in the<br>Laboratories would cause a lot of damage<br>on the other hand those strains here<br>were found in an orchard where we didn't<br>find any other symptoms<br>and when you inoculate them in Plants<br>you barely could see any Leaf spots<br>so to differentiate those two groups we<br>call this group psav for virulence and<br>PSA lV for low variables<br>those Trends here LV seem to be I've<br>been found at that time only in New<br>Zealand so we were very interested to<br>know what other strains so we did a<br>little bit more work on them and doing<br>more work we find out that actually<br>genetically there were different enough<br>from psh<br>and the pathogensity was different<br>enough from PSA that actually they when<br>they they qualify to be a different part<br>V is PSA<br>it is actually one of the five biovases<br>because in PSA you can differentiate<br>based on geogenetics and other<br>characteristics you can you can<br>distinguish five different bio bar by<br>one two three five and six by over four<br>and all the strains you have in you oops<br>all the strains we<br>all the strains you have in New Zealand<br>belong to bio<br>three<br>and that's the biovar that has been<br>found also in Italy has been in France<br>has been found in Chile has been found<br>in China it is the biovar that's causing<br>a lot of trouble for the key food<br>industry around the world<br>however in New Zealand I think PSA has<br>spread faster through the industry than<br>in other countries and here on this<br>slide we have we have both plenty all<br>the little dots of different colors<br>represent key fruit orchards in red you<br>have the the outside of the area<br>affected December 2010 that's when we<br>discovered the beginning of the outbreak<br>and within one year by December 2011<br>most of both plenty was actually<br>infected by PSA<br>within few years<br>if you look at New Zealand and every dot<br>represents a key food to Orchards only<br>around fengary and the north of islands<br>that those two areas were only around<br>so why PSA spreads so rapidly in New<br>Zealand well the number of reasons<br>the first reason is actually<br>environmental conditions very favorable<br>for the organisms if you look here you<br>have the maximum temperature and minimum<br>temperature in Tauranga and if you<br>compare with Latina where they grow key<br>Foods in Italy or Matsuyama in Japan you<br>see they have very high extremely high<br>temperature and extreme low which we do<br>not have in New Zealand not in town<br>which means year round the climate the<br>temperature allowed the batter to<br>multiply or allows the bacteria to<br>establish and to infect so we have an<br>organisms here that can infect year<br>round<br>the other reasons why it went very<br>rapidly is that you have this continuous<br>Key Food after Key Food so once the<br>pathogens in there it finds you know a<br>fantastic terrain to to move and of<br>course<br>all that was with a narrow identity bass<br>because all those orchards are basically<br>two cultivars hot 16a the yellow fresh<br>cultivar<br>and Hayward the green fish cultivar and<br>these yellow flash duterte 69 is very<br>susceptible to peace<br>actually it is the one that took the<br>branch of the of the uh of the yard<br>if you look here at so that is actually<br>the area of hot 16h that was grown and<br>you can see after PSA came in each<br>points down and that of course the<br>production of 416a follows the same<br>curve the revenue and so it all follows<br>the same and you had all those those<br>headlines the paper 100 million disaster<br>uh uh gold key fruit exports halves this<br>was actually that dotted line excuse me<br>I thought that line here was actually<br>the prediction of how host dictionary<br>and yellow flash Clifford was going to<br>do in New Zealand and it was going to go<br>up and up and up and up except that<br>because they came in and win the the<br>show<br>now we do know that was in 2000 10 or<br>11. now we know that it is not quite the<br>case we know and if we follow the papers<br>you know that things have changed in<br>this in this uh headlines here you have<br>greens turns to gold for the spring<br>the cafe industry has come back stronger<br>for in the ravages of PSC disease I've<br>seen presentations that was a few years<br>after the beginning of outbreak where<br>people were super optimistic and you had<br>the slides out of the darkness<br>thank you to all who contributed to this<br>miraculous recovery<br>wow those are headlines<br>so let's look a little bit at how we<br>as soon as PSA came in New Zealand<br>zestri asked the question it was I think<br>an interesting question an important<br>question is there anything out there<br>that exists on the Shelf we could take<br>we could use to reduce this incidents<br>anything at all<br>yes and that was important to do and so<br>we did it and we did over 300 treatments<br>and we looked for either direct<br>inhibition of the pathogen or<br>elicitation means a process that makes<br>the plant more resistance to the<br>pathogen<br>over 30 treatments<br>and possibly at the end we didn't failed<br>many compounds that we didn't think<br>would be good at controlling plant<br>what we found we found antibiotic<br>streptomycin cassegromycin are very good<br>at controlling bacteria not a good<br>surprise<br>we found that uh copper what well not so<br>willing glass house experiments by the<br>way but in the field worked very well in<br>controlling PSA<br>and we found that Bion or ASM acetyl<br>um acipenza as missile which is sold as<br>active guards so part of the world as<br>Bion which is an elicitor also reduce<br>we looked at biological cultural agents<br>and although some of them were working<br>in general the resistance or the control<br>was not consistent enough for us to make<br>recommendation about those background<br>Solutions and it is not very surprising<br>because it was background religions were<br>selected for the ability to control<br>different pathogen on different crops in<br>different environments<br>but of course since then we know uh Phil<br>Elmer and civil Hall to developed this<br>uh this Oreo gold which is the<br>biological control agent which is a<br>uh just like organism<br>s<br>and so all those all those products are<br>now available for people to control PSC<br>and that represents I would say one of<br>the pillar of this miraculous recovery<br>the older pillar is actually the planet<br>by itself so Stephen Hawk spent a lot of<br>time phenotyping cultivars of kiwi<br>fruits I can get finances finances<br>delicious fruits and couple of others<br>and he developed a wood stem by your<br>asses<br>and he could rank all is all the<br>cultivars against that that bios index<br>in the same time people work in the<br>field develop a a field score and you<br>could rank all the all the objects by<br>that field score what what<br>is clear is that hot 16a the yellow fish<br>cultivar we had before PSA came in is<br>very susceptible Falls over very quickly<br>in the field and also uh with the stamp<br>your assay while gold three a new<br>cultivar that was in pre-commercial<br>Trials when PSA came in what China ended<br>flash yellow fresh gear Foods turn out<br>to be much more resistant in the field<br>and also<br>and that goes through represents the<br>second pillar I would say or that<br>recovery that allowed the industry to<br>so and actually there's a third pillar<br>to that recovery and that has to be the<br>IG if you want to control PSA in your<br>orchard you really need to have hygiene<br>means removing the symptom removing the<br>look and with three pillars when they<br>put together it allows people to grow<br>kiwi fruit and not to worry so much<br>about<br>um PSA as long as they follow the rules<br>now you need to put all that together<br>and this is something that has been uh<br>put together by kvhd with Divine health<br>so on the top you have here A whole<br>season of cured food going from blood<br>break to dormancy<br>and here all the product and when you<br>can use them so all the product<br>available in New Zealand today are all<br>those products which are copper based<br>products and you can use them most of<br>the year except during flowering then<br>you have better aside categoromycin and<br>streptomycin you can use only for a<br>virtual period of time<br>and then you have Oreo gold which is<br>called biobactericides which I think is<br>a fancy name for biological control<br>agent which is the same as<br>butresen and QB wax and you have two<br>compounds active guards and ambushes<br>which are two compound which do not<br>affect the pathogen but affect the plant<br>and make the plants more resistant to<br>infection<br>foreign<br>following all those all of those uh<br>using all those compounds and hygiene<br>and go three allowed us to move from<br>this picture<br>to this picture so this picture here you<br>have the decline of what 16a following<br>the outbreak of PSA and you see that<br>soon after gold 3 which is the name of<br>the device<br>zc002 uh<br>group and and and in few years<br>represented<br>all the yellow fresh Q Foods produce in<br>New Zealand and to a point where in<br>actual fact if you look here it is a<br>level of production or area being<br>planted which is what zestri would have<br>predicted or wanted to be at before PSA<br>came in so if you look at it it's a bit<br>like PSA which is represented by this<br>this pink area here in hindsight you can<br>look at PSS it was like like it would<br>work in the road so to speak you know it<br>floats down the the where we want it to<br>be with yellow fresh steel Foods it<br>didn't stop it<br>it's a it's a scary bump in the roads<br>because you know we didn't know whether<br>we get it out and very expensive as well<br>90 million trades equivalent that's a<br>lot of money right but in einsight it<br>looks like well<br>and and so this explained now that slide<br>with the toolkit which I which I just<br>talked about and that sungold which is<br>how the fruits from Gulf Street was a<br>season to are marketed<br>so<br>I say being solved is it just the<br>storage<br>I have to say if I were a grower I look<br>at those graphs and look at all the<br>products available<br>and I looked at all the problems I face<br>which is luchin in the winter means not<br>enough flowers in Spring<br>Lakes are Frost in Spring<br>nothing of people to pick my crop not<br>enough people to prune my crop to prune<br>my Orchards and then the consequences of<br>and I said well I've plenty of things<br>that seem to me to come ahead of PSA and<br>I'm tempted to say yeah well TSA is not<br>right there on my radar<br>and I understand that as a grower I<br>understand now as a scientist well I<br>have a different story<br>I'm not convinced that it is so I'm not<br>convinced it is just the story actually<br>I'm convinced we should not be<br>complacent<br>and with the CEO of Intel that said uh<br>success brings complacency complacency<br>brings failure only the paranoid<br>survives<br>I think it's probably important not to<br>be complacent let's look at the first<br>and the first tool we have today to<br>control PSA which is copper all those<br>Copper products they were used from<br>2011 by 2015 two teams in New Zealand<br>Irina Colombia and unamakanimasu<br>University Russell Poulter and Maggie<br>Butler in otago University independently<br>found some strains of Kissa that were<br>resistant to Copper<br>four years after we started to use it no<br>do you do not have time so we're<br>interested oh can we still control PSA<br>we those trains with with copper so we<br>went to the glass house and we did the<br>experiment and we have here 10627 which<br>is the strangest copper sensitive and<br>three strength are copper resistant and<br>those are resistant to the highest level<br>of copper so this is the strength with<br>most restraint you could find in New<br>Zealand and in the glass cells yes we<br>could control all those Stars whoever it<br>happens<br>but as I said copper doesn't work that<br>well in glass house so then we went into<br>the outside and we used some truck<br>plants and we asked the same question<br>can we control PSA Copperas and strains<br>of PSA using copper<br>and yes we can if you look at numbers<br>this spot on plant that were treated<br>with water this is copper was a<br>significant difference<br>but here it is where the good news stop<br>because<br>from the straw plant we analyze<br>each leaf spot and we ask for the<br>question<br>easily spots caused the bias trenches<br>copper resistant or strange copper<br>sensitive<br>and the result is that this is the ratio<br>copper resistant copper sensitive we had<br>in our water treated plants and in our<br>corporate treaty<br>so yes we are controlling the strengths<br>but we're increasing the racial copper<br>resistance<br>and why is that a problem you will say<br>well it is a problem because we have<br>here on this graph this camera you have<br>because of cupric ion cupric ion is what<br>kills your bacteria so the copper<br>product come in different formulation<br>but it's a cupric ion and that could<br>pick ion is released over time and so<br>you have the concentration and over time<br>it goes down<br>there's a level of of copper and under<br>which there's actually no effect in fact<br>the battery is quite happy because the<br>battery needs a bit of copper to survive<br>so if in your orchard you have copper<br>sensitive strains you kill your bacteria<br>from that point to that so doing all<br>that time your product is effective if<br>now you have a mixtures of copper<br>resistant and copper sensitive strain<br>and let's say for argument's sake about<br>the level of resistance is represented<br>here by this yellow line when the<br>concern of Capricorn goes beyond that<br>yellow line<br>you control only the copper sensitive so<br>you increase the local resistance to the<br>port Arabi normal copper sensitive in<br>which case you control PSA only in that<br>shorter period of time here so you still<br>control but your product is is effective<br>for Less longer for a shorter period of<br>time and if you think and at the time<br>that we're thinking I'll be smart I'm<br>going to use lower concept of copper but<br>many times if you do that well this is<br>what could happen you would have a lost<br>total or partial loss of control until<br>you cross that that line and then and<br>and only for that short period of time<br>unfortunately it gets uh<br>it gets even worse because both<br>um both team looked at comparison to<br>find out that the genes for couple<br>reasons for so copper resistance the<br>back is copper resistant if it can<br>capture the copper and eject it or trap<br>it and store it somewhere<br>okay all that requires<br>genes that produce enzyme and<br>approaching to do that job so those<br>genes have to be acquired and the genes<br>it's classic among uh bacteria<br>copperasins genes are very often all the<br>time carried by plasmid which is a small<br>uh element here that can move from<br>bacteria to bacteria those two bacteria<br>don't have to be even the same species<br>or the same genus<br>I don't think to multiply and they also<br>found that those copper resistance were<br>carried by What's called the ice<br>integrative conjugative elements you<br>have an element here so that strain<br>let's say would be copper resistant and<br>this one is not and in no time both of<br>them are copper resistance<br>that explain why copper resistance can<br>spread through population very rapidly<br>without the bachelor price it can spread<br>from one species to another horizontal<br>now you'll say well you know well it can<br>transfer but we still control it so<br>where's the problem well here's the<br>problem<br>this is this is a number of uh of of<br>strains we isolated in New Zealand all<br>from New Zealand all from Orchards<br>not clear fruits Orchards but the<br>different Orchards and and look at the<br>level of residual of the pseudonymous<br>hearing if you look at pseudonymous<br>Syria acting DJ PSA this is this trend<br>which is risen to the highest countries<br>of copper is here in that assay these<br>Trends can resist to 1.25 uh Mini model<br>but in other Orchard summer food Orchard<br>Bigfoot Orchards we found strains here<br>most probably those genes are also<br>carried by mobile genetic elements<br>plasmid ice that could move horizontally<br>and the question is<br>what would happen if those elements here<br>would move into PSA<br>could we still control those chains with<br>the level of copper using today<br>Injustice<br>and we don't know the answers<br>so far we haven't found and and kph and<br>is looking at it every year we haven't<br>found the strength of PSA which is<br>reserved to a higher cost of copper than<br>this one<br>that perhaps there is perhaps a very<br>good reason for us<br>biological reasons<br>but I don't know if nobody knows it and<br>so therefore this stage you cannot rule<br>out that one day we'll have strength and<br>result to a higher concept of copper<br>which means we'll be able to control<br>them with copper<br>so this is the digital conversation of<br>copper of the genes involved in Copper<br>resistance and so they're all copper<br>resistance cus and so and so forth but<br>embedded in them<br>you have those two Gene strb those genes<br>will give resistance to strepto mice<br>and in this case they embedded the<br>middle of the copper research genes but<br>in other cases they are on the same<br>mobile element a little bit further but<br>symbolic limits<br>so that means when when a strain<br>received one of those mobile element if<br>you use copper you give a selective<br>advantage to the strains with the copper<br>resistance genes at the same time you<br>give a res an advantage of the strange<br>type streptomycles<br>the others and so you cannot use<br>streptomycin later because your strings<br>so well<br>you say well we still have the elicitors<br>don't switch why don't we use elicitors<br>and get that plants hunting and being<br>resistant as much as you can while this<br>is work from uh from from and when so<br>you have a key food plenty that was not<br>treated and he went that was treated<br>with Asm on a regular basis week after<br>week and if you do that what you find<br>you find that your plant doesn't grow<br>nearly as well as the planet was not<br>treated raise raise a trade-off between<br>resistance and growth so you can't make<br>your plant resistant all the time<br>okay so that's one of the pillars that<br>looks a little bit more freakish than<br>you would like if you want perhaps a<br>good news about about that pillar is<br>that about classical mass in resistance<br>so far we have never found a strand of<br>PSA which is risen to category mice<br>on the downside we know that classical<br>machine resistance exists in New Zealand<br>instead of pseudomonas but you do not<br>know whether that resistance is carried<br>by mobile genetic elements and therefore<br>whether that resistance could be<br>transferred to pierce<br>so now let's look at the second major<br>pillar of of the miracle which is which<br>is gold three which is resistant to PS<br>so what happened when when a uh when a<br>bacteria comes in contact with with uh<br>with a plant cell the plants will sense<br>the prince of the bacteria and that will<br>trigger a serious signal that that tells<br>the plant versus bacteria would possibly<br>in Danger let's put some difference<br>is what happened and so that's bacteria<br>will not cause any any any disease and<br>in most cases most bacteria and most<br>plants do not cause disease disease is<br>the exception not the rule<br>so what does happen what needs to happen<br>for plants to for butter to be pathogen<br>well what happens is that the plant has<br>developed a system where they inject<br>into the plant cell some effectors<br>protein which disrupt either the sensing<br>or the signal transaction or the<br>response of the plant in this case the<br>plant is not responding and you have<br>this<br>so a bacteria can become pathogen by<br>acquiring genes that goes for the<br>difference<br>of course during Evolution the plant has<br>developed a system to protect itself<br>from those effectors and the plant will<br>has those resistance protein here that<br>will recognize presence and when the<br>planet recognize that risk or detect<br>represent effect an effector it will<br>start a very strong defense<br>and so in this case you will not have<br>disease<br>but what happened if your pathogens only<br>here which cannot cause disease would<br>lose the ability to produce the<br>effectors that are recognized by the<br>police<br>well what will happen is very simple the<br>plant will not recognize with an<br>effector it will not produce that strong<br>defense reaction and will be susceptible<br>and your bacteria is pathogen<br>so your bacteria can become pathogen<br>either by acquiring genes<br>for Effective genes or by losing some<br>effective Gene so that's a bit<br>counter-intrity intuitive in the sense<br>that you can gain a function by losing<br>some genes that's how it happens<br>and uh much Templeton and neuron MRI<br>who are working a lot on evolution of<br>PSA in New Zealand find actually that<br>this<br>this does happen<br>PSA is evolving in front of our eyes and<br>so at India argutouch is the Kiwi<br>bearing is resistance to PSA<br>however they were able to find<br>some some aguta with symptoms caused by<br>PSA they analyze the PSN they found<br>there's a deletion of those effector<br>genes we put those plants in a glass<br>house and I don't see it still but but<br>when we when we use the strength of the<br>deletion we had All Seasons or if you<br>put the water strains in these symptoms<br>that does just represent simply the the<br>fragment and it can be fragment that's<br>missing so<br>now those trains haven't taken over and<br>agrita is still risen to PSA because in<br>addition to being able to because they<br>have other problem in virulence and<br>multiplications and so forth but what I<br>think this signals is that if we cannot<br>check for granted that aguta is<br>resistant to PSA<br>why are we taking for granted that gold<br>3 is risen to PSA<br>we do not know the mechanisms of<br>resistance could it be that a simple<br>deletion would lead<br>okay so that's fine to talk about all<br>the difficulties and all the problems<br>with uh<br>with the miracle that the questions what<br>are we doing about it it's nice to say<br>well yeah very good question what are we<br>doing about it well actually a lot of<br>work is happening and I can't talk about<br>uh all the work<br>but I'll talk about some of it and<br>particular what could be doing a<br>collaboration with Walker to University<br>being here on the waikato campus I think<br>it's probably uh the investing to do and<br>so so we had a collaboration that<br>started many years ago with Michelle<br>princess Chris Battlefield Hills and<br>Lewis Dean with a PhD student at waikato<br>and the idea there was is there some<br>compound in seaweeds from Bay of Plenty<br>that could inhibit PS<br>so so<br>rather it is screening that was made of<br>a number of seaweeds extracts were made<br>they were characterized which we checked<br>uh in uh in vitro for inhibition of PSA<br>and we found a number of them that do<br>indeed uh inhibit PSA on that slide here<br>you have so visitor and the side and the<br>top side of the same leaf on this area<br>here we had PSA by itself and you see<br>the necrosis happening and here we had a<br>PSA with some of the civilian extracts<br>and absolutely<br>I know that collaboration I know the<br>system that this is with you Mary Mason<br>and uh Chris glasson we're there we're<br>looking at something different looking<br>at polysaccharide from all the seaweeds<br>and we're not looking at inhibition of<br>PSA we're looking at whether some of<br>those compounds could elicit a reaction<br>in the plant and make the plants more<br>resistant this is the very beginning of<br>the um of the of the project but at the<br>very beginning if there is already some<br>compounds here that when sprayed before<br>uh PSA reduce disease incidents the<br>great thing about about elicitors from<br>seaweed and polysaccharide is that it<br>would give now the organic food Growers<br>and elicitor because Bayan or actigard<br>cannot be used on organic on organic<br>objects and we know that the organic<br>sector is growing growing fast and so<br>therefore I believe there's a demand for<br>and so that would be the<br>uh that could become the answer<br>what else well so all that if you think<br>of it what we're doing here with another<br>project with with the joining us<br>Institute we're looking at biological<br>control agents and when we do there we<br>add more tools to the toolbox that's<br>what we're doing<br>in addition to that we're looking also<br>at novel ways of controlling creations<br>and it is where so on chigua is right<br>here uh comes in is this is so on you<br>recognize after Laboratories in Chengdu<br>in Sichuan yes and um<br>and so so uh suong was actually the<br>co-director of the Key Food Research<br>Institute in in the George laboratory in<br>Chengdu is from Citron so situan is that<br>Central part here in China<br>now we know that qfoot is not from New<br>Zealand<br>it's actually from China<br>it is actually a lot of the people are<br>coming from this area here in China<br>which is where initially regards we got<br>the the first few things<br>something that that struck me when um<br>when I when I went to visit in in<br>Sichuan is that if you look at the<br>Orchards they're hammered by piercings<br>this is a hong Yang Orchard completely<br>devastated by Jesus<br>all around that odd said you have the<br>mountains and the wild forest where the<br>cube fruits is growing you go in that<br>forest and you will not find piercings<br>so on went in that forest look for it<br>came back with thousands of strains not<br>a single one was pierced on a McKenna<br>oil with all the scientists from<br>Northern Western University spent six<br>months in the mountain went throughout<br>not just Sichuan shenshi where several<br>provinces came back empty<br>I have to wonder why what's happening<br>why you have so much you know because<br>I'm here and you have those disease and<br>nothing in the mount what's different<br>likely it can be just the the climate it<br>can't be so could it be that in actual<br>fact it is the macrobial environment<br>that would prevent peers and I'll tell<br>you quickly how we came to that<br>hypothesis years ago I worked with<br>Francesco Spinelli in Bologna University<br>we have a long relationship and you know<br>collaboration that's going for years and<br>and working together we found that if<br>you expose PSA to a supernatant in which<br>you had a lot of disagreeing there so<br>the backyard was gone but the sugar<br>metabolism left if you do that you find<br>out some genes<br>some genes like op Z5 which are involved<br>in the virulence are overexpressed and<br>the genes involved in Mobility are<br>overexpressed that tell you that PSA<br>communicate with all the PSA cells it's<br>called Quorum sensing and when you have<br>a lot of them together they know it<br>through clinical signals and they turn<br>on the veron's genes<br>we also we did that experiments now with<br>different organisms during a steering is<br>pseudonymous really flavor and<br>fluorescence which are<br>bacterial species you find commonly on<br>kiwi fruits and when you do that you<br>find that again<br>yes they respond to the presence of<br>those bacteria by turning on genes for<br>mobility and turning on genes for both<br>information and also some genes involved<br>in virulence<br>oops Yeah right there<br>so PSA communicates with its microbial<br>environment and in response to it by<br>turning on genes involves in virulence<br>now what would happen if we break that<br>communication well it was a very good<br>example of that this is another<br>bacterium it's effective bacterium<br>keratophorum that cause soft rod on<br>potatoes and when you let the<br>communication occur and you put your<br>picture back terminal and the potato<br>slice you have all these shrubs<br>you prevent communication<br>and you have nothing<br>so<br>could it be could it be that in the<br>mountain in situa and the rest of China<br>you have a macroflora that somehow<br>modify the communication of PSA in such<br>a way that PSA doesn't cause themselves<br>to answer that question with two on we<br>look at the microbiome of kiwi fruits<br>grown in Citron in an orchard with the<br>key food brand in the wild<br>and I'll show you just the very<br>beginning of of the um of where we are<br>this is brimming of the analysis it's<br>just one side it's one collected samples<br>from three different sites we're looking<br>at bacterial microbiome we're looking at<br>fungal microbiome we're looking at EP<br>fighter biome and the fat microbiome and<br>root Associated microbiome so six<br>microbiomes per plant so a lot of this<br>is just the very beginning but I just<br>want to show this because it is clear<br>when you look at this taxonomic uh plot<br>here that all the strains here or all<br>the microbiome from those planets here<br>that commercially grown are very<br>different from those that are in the<br>wild and one of the main difference is<br>right here it is a look at the diversity<br>we have in the wild kiwi fruit that we<br>lost in the commercially grown kiwi<br>fruit and we know that when we<br>domesticate a plant we lose diversity in<br>the microbiome<br>and we know that diversity in the<br>microbiome brings a lot of function to<br>the plants<br>and one of the question and now so that<br>so we started this really looking at<br>could we explain the fact that PSA is in<br>environment in China and we don't find<br>PSA in the white cure fruits in China<br>that was the beginning of the story but<br>now when you look at this what else<br>has been modified in the short amount of<br>time we domesticated kiwi fruit<br>the domestication of clear fruits might<br>have resulted in a loss of diversity<br>what else so with of course resistance<br>to PSA but recent spreads of a pathogen<br>to pests ability to deal with drought<br>ability to to deal with flooding what<br>else has been lost and once we find what<br>has been lost how can we bring it back<br>how can we use that microbiome to<br>actually allow people to grow the best<br>to refute in the condition in which they<br>are<br>and so this is just the beginning of the<br>uh of the study but I thought it was<br>very very interesting and very I'm very<br>excited by it<br>okay so uh I think at the end of my time<br>so I just before finishing I want to<br>thank that<br>most of the work I've talked I've talked<br>about and also flattened food research<br>through some creep programs they help<br>some of some of the work so thank you<br>very much to uh to this big kvh and<br>planted food people in my lab we did the<br>work daydre Janet Jenny and Megan<br>she has this student that came in my lab<br>and did some of the work I talked about<br>today Luca from bologna I'm in from<br>France Lewis from wakat University and W<br>Martinez from the in this institute<br>people from planted food research<br>attorney Kirsten Steve Matt and Gina<br>Raymond people from waikato University<br>let's not forget to get to the<br>university right so Michelle Chris<br>Murray and Chris are here people from<br>Massey University on a McCain and then a<br>lot of collaboration overseas long-term<br>collaboration especially Francisco<br>Spinelli we collaborating for more than<br>20 years together Jacqueline from the<br>John Ennis Institute Mariners Jack from<br>inora in France and so on uh Hugo who is<br>here we've been together since 2009 if I<br>recall well so of course at the end<br>we'll be a disclaimer for the<br>presentation and uh and otherwise I'm<br>um so I think we might just leave it<br>just an interesting time and this is<br>just a small token from us saying thank<br>you so much for coming over your<br>presentation thank you I'm sure if<br>anyone's got any questions uh they're<br>welcome to contact you yes absolutely<br>because by email there and anybody for<br>any question I'd be very happy to uh yes<br>thank you so much and thank you to<br>okay</p></main><footer style="margin-top: 2rem; background: #0001; padding: 2rem; text-align: center;"><p>We Are The University</p><ul
