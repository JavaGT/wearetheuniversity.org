Not-for-profit andpublic child care has priority. Has Quebec’s long-running program been successful? Will this initiative succeed in the rest of Canada? And how is Canada dealing with the barriers that exist to expansion for not-for-profit and public services? Gordon will talk about the successes and failures in Quebec and the rest of Canada. Sue will talk about the advocates’ response to the Canada-Wide Early Learning and Child Care Agreement, focusing on the creation of an organisation to support and develop public and non-profit child care in the province of Ontario.<br><br>Presented by: Gordon Cleveland and Sue Colley.</p><h2>Transcript</h2><p style="opacity: 0.9; font-size: 0.8em">Transcripts may be automatically generated and

of<br>education and also co-director of early<br>years Research Center we are very<br>pleased to host this seminar and see so<br>many of you and thank you so much for<br>coming and before we introduce our<br>speakers I would invite my colleague<br>amelissa Derby who is co-leading the<br>center really early years Research<br>Center with me to make one important<br>announcement and say a couple of words<br>thank you Oliveira and welcome everybody<br>to this afternoon seminar and Oliveira<br>and I are thrilled to have you all here<br>and to hear our two wonderful speakers<br>this afternoon and before<br>um I we get started with that I'd just<br>like to make an announcement about the<br>early years Research Center uh<br>conference which is coming up in<br>uh July Saturday the 8th of July<br>um it will be held at our waikato campus<br>in Hamilton<br>um we are currently in the throes of of<br>making sure or at least attempting to<br>hold a hybrid conference where we can<br>also place people online just to<br>um I guess enable people who aren't able<br>to be there face to face to join us so<br>we'll have an announcement more<br>information I guess coming out uh in due<br>course but for now save the date<br>Saturday the 8th of July uh the<br>conference theme is celebrating 30 years<br>of tifariki draft so tifariki is the<br>Early Childhood curriculum obviously in<br>New Zealand and it's had an impact not<br>only here but also in other countries<br>around the world so we're looking to<br>reflect on all of the um you know<br>incredible impacts that Jeff bariki has<br>had thus far and of course to reject on<br>where it might go in the future so<br>that's the conference theme more<br>information is coming up very quickly<br>but I just wanted to bring that to your<br>attention now and to have you met your<br>diaries with that important date the 8th<br>of July and I'll hand back to you now<br>Olivia<br>thanks a lot before we introduce our<br>speakers maybe just a few uh<br>housekeeping rules please keep yourself<br>commute unless you're you are asking<br>questions which is going to happen at<br>the end of the presentation the<br>presentation is recorded and we are<br>happy to share the recordings uh if you<br>uh get in touch with us and also there<br>is a chat box available for any<br>questions you would like uh our speakers<br>and audience to discuss after we after<br>we finished it presentation so uh we<br>today we have two brilliant speakers<br>Emirates associate professor Gordon<br>Cleveland from the University of Toronto<br>and sukovi from uh also who is president<br>of building blocks for child care in<br>Canada and I invite Linda Michelle<br>Professor Linda Mitchell to introduce<br>welcome to everybody here today<br>especially to yours too and Gordon uh<br>we're really pleased to have you both to<br>talk about the topic moving towards<br>Universal Child Care Christian Mark I<br>like the question mark and The Other<br>Side Story on what is happening in<br>Canada and your topic is really dear to<br>our hearts as many of us in New Zealand<br>and at the early years Research Center<br>are researching and advocating for free<br>Universal<br>good quality public and not for profits<br>Early childhoods Education<br>so we have a lot of interest in what has<br>happened in Canada and in Quebec and<br>responses to the federal government's<br>incentives to expand<br>not-for-profit Early Learning and child<br>care is as you call that<br>so we're really lucky to have you here<br>to talk<br>Sue has been involved in policy research<br>and advocacy for years for 40 years or<br>more she's played a really important<br>role also in major studies of child care<br>policy and programs in Toronto and<br>Ontario and much more besides<br>Sue is currently president of building<br>blocks for child care a charity<br>dedicated to the expansion of private<br>not-for-profit early childhood education<br>in Toronto in Ontario actually<br>and Gordon is Emeritus associate<br>professor at the University of Toronto<br>where he's taught economics for 25 years<br>and his research includes analysis of<br>costs and benefits of early learning and<br>child care and the ways in which<br>different oecd countries Finance their<br>programs<br>his examine determinants of quality and<br>child care factors affecting child care<br>workers wages ways of measuring<br>affordability which is really<br>interesting and so we've used a lot of<br>Gordon's work in advocacy ourselves for<br>Quality early childhood education and<br>particularly for teachers who are well<br>qualified and fairly recompensed<br>so together you bring that amazing<br>combination of sound research and<br>persistent and shrewd advocacy that are<br>so important in transforming systems<br>we regarded both as good collegial<br>friends of the early years Research<br>Center having visited here in 2017 when<br>amongst other things you Gordon<br>um met was Chris hitkins who was then<br>labor spokesperson on education that was<br>before the 2017 election and you spoke<br>at the early years Research Center in<br>that year and in 2019 so thank you very<br>much for being available and I'll hand<br>okay<br>okay my<br>internet's a bit unstable today so you<br>can let us know in the chat whether<br>there any issues and we can try and<br>adjust for that<br>um so<br>you can see my screen I guess it's okay<br>what I want to talk about is I want to<br>talk about both Quebec<br>and Canada the rest of Canada so Quebec<br>implemented<br>a universal Early Childhood system or<br>began to back in 1997 so more than 20<br>.<br>in Canada in the last couple of years<br>has put itself on the track towards a<br>universal child care system in the rest<br>of the country so these are very<br>interesting experiments to look at<br>Canada not very far along but Quebec<br>quite far along so we can learn a lot<br>from what's been happening<br>you know let's see if I can<br>get this okay so General picture on<br>Quebec<br>um it's got a strong<br>not-for-profit base to its services<br>there was rapid expansion in the early<br>years uh of the program which led to<br>significant problems which I'm going to<br>talk about<br>there are problems of equity and access<br>and Staffing certainly shortages of<br>Staffing<br>um but it's been found over time that<br>supply side funding delivers much better<br>results and it's now a permanent and<br>much loved social program no government<br>is now going to be able to take it away<br>because it is so much appreciated by<br>parents and families<br>so a story and outline for Quebec back<br>in 1997 Quebec and this is a<br>french-speaking province essentially<br>with about 8.7 million population about<br>420<br>000<br>uh children zero to four years of age<br>they began phasing a universal licensed<br>Care at five dollars a day so thirteen<br>hundred dollars a year not free but very<br>inexpensive at the time and it hasn't<br>changed that much it had at the time a<br>progressive and what they called an<br>independentous government so it actually<br>favored the independence of Quebec but<br>it was a sort of specific government<br>with a strong female ministers an<br>important part of the story and it was<br>in office until 2003 uh and it built a<br>system in which not-for-profit cpes and<br>that stands for Early Childhood centers<br>but in French were the Bedrock of the<br>planned system and they called it<br>educational child care<br>at that time there were only about 80<br>000 Child Care spaces available less<br>than 20 percent of the population was<br>covered now there's about 300 000 spaces<br>over 70 percent but the the growth in<br>spaces is a big story an important one<br>to tell which I'll get to so it now is<br>risen from five dollars a day but it's<br>still only eight dollars and 85 cents a<br>day or about twenty three hundred<br>dollars a year<br>in the fixed fee Services now I say<br>fixed fee Services because again this is<br>a part of the story The fixed fee<br>Services the five dollar a day initially<br>now eight dollars and 85 cents a day<br>we're the Bedrock of the system but a<br>later government established a parallel<br>system which wasn't fixed fee I'll get<br>to that in a minute but there was also<br>good maturity and parental benefits we<br>can discuss the details if you want to<br>and publicly provided before and after<br>school care for the same uh fixed low<br>fee<br>so you know really from 0 to 12 years of<br>age child care or early childhood<br>education available at five dollars a<br>day also with a year of good maturity<br>and parental benefits of you know a<br>basic good system of universal uh child<br>care<br>okay now it's not okay there we go so a<br>picture of the the growth and you can<br>see how it went from about 80 000 spaces<br>way back when in 1997 to about 300 000<br>spaces now if you took time to look at<br>this and I I'm going to have to move<br>quickly so you won't get to look at<br>everything you might want to drag out<br>the the the uh the copy of it the uh<br>the recorded copy later to look at it<br>but what you've got is a big growth in<br>the number of spaces but also a change<br>in the composition of the spaces so the<br>the real heart of the system are those<br>black ones at the bottom that those are<br>the center-based early childhood<br>education<br>uh not-for-profit centers but in order<br>to do the expansion they also relied on<br>family child care and that's the green<br>part of uh for that those columns and<br>then later on began to rely on<br>for-profit care or which is the the blue<br>and the purple<br>next so the ex the expansion after 2005.<br>so remember it started back in 1997 but<br>the expansion after 2005 was in<br>for-profit Services funded by tax<br>credits after 2005 the coverage was in<br>fixed fee services and it had risen from<br>as I said below 20 of children to just<br>about half of all children but then<br>this might sound affiliate your story a<br>new government comes in and the new<br>government has a different idea about<br>where things should go and over a few<br>years that new government a conservative<br>government its name was liberal but it's<br>actually conservative government and it<br>opened up an alternative channel of<br>funding a tax credit to pay parents<br>child care expenses but with no controls<br>on fees so instead of fees being<br>controlled at five dollars a day<br>there were no controls on the fees that<br>were charged and that of course<br>attracted the for-profit sector as the<br>chart shows you'll see it in a moment<br>after 2005 all of the increase in<br>coverage comes from the market-based<br>child care without fixed fees where<br>parents receive tax credits to help them<br>buy child care so almost all for-profit<br>and this was the biggest mistake in the<br>development of Quebec's child care<br>system<br>is all other kinds of uh child care and<br>then the yellow added on is those<br>um tax credit funded a child care<br>centers so you can see after about 2005<br>all of the growth really is in these uh<br>tax credit funded for-profit centers<br>so<br>one of the good things and this is the<br>role of academics which is a very<br>important has been very important in<br>Quebec was to do studies and they did<br>studies and I encouraged the the<br>governments to do studies on the quality<br>of child care and so this is the result<br>of one of those studies done in 2014 and<br>again it would take you a long time to<br>go through it might by useful but the<br>first two columns<br>are the cpes that's to say those<br>not-for-profit Child Care Centers and<br>the last two columns are the tax credit<br>funded for-profit Child Care Centers and<br>what this diagram shows you<br>is that the quality in the<br>I got to get rid of this thing here<br>disappear okay<br>um the tech the the quality in the the<br>cpes on the left hand side those<br>left-hand side two columns an awful lot<br>of it is good quality that's the green<br>um and uh not very much or acceptable<br>quality and not very much of it is of<br>poor quality or Fair quality but in the<br>for-profit centers much much larger<br>percentages in poor or Fair quality some<br>in good very very little in uh excellent<br>uh quality<br>um so you know this has had these<br>Studies have had an important impact in<br>turning around the views especially of<br>governments and others on what's what it<br>what it makes sense to do in terms of<br>of policy development over time so<br>what's part of the story here on the<br>quality difference in 2019 for instance<br>87 percent of those not-for-profit<br>centers met the requirement to have<br>two-thirds of Staff having educational<br>qualifications base basically a a<br>two-year college diploma it's actually<br>three years in Quebec because of their<br>education system but only 27 percent of<br>the for-profit market-based child care<br>services met this requirement so in<br>general it's now widely recognized this<br>dpes have Services a better quality<br>better working conditions for staff<br>better trained educators<br>so they're very strong positive effects<br>that are widely recognized from the this<br>move to a universal child care with its<br>difficulties huge increases in labor<br>force participation Canada was behind<br>the rest of Canada now it's in front<br>careful studies found that there was<br>about a 13 rise in labor force<br>participation and most of that full-time<br>strongest from others with higher levels<br>of education but still strong for<br>mothers with lower levels of education<br>so lower income than others and it had a<br>noticeable effect on family poverty it's<br>a very well-known uh Canadian Economist<br>um<br>did a wonderful study of the impact and<br>found that it more than paid for itself<br>in other words in essence if you take<br>the long run economic impacts of the<br>development of universal child care it<br>was a great bargain for uh Canadian<br>governments there are mixed effects on<br>children the children in those CPS the<br>not-for-profit child care centers did<br>fine but as you might expect<br>there were a lot of children in lower<br>quality services those family child care<br>and the for-profit centers were found to<br>be of lower quality and there was chaos<br>and and problems in terms of the rapid<br>expansion of services<br>this this is just basically trying to<br>tell you that<br>um there are some difficulties with the<br>service as it exists despite I will<br>argue a very strong positive effects so<br>here you have differences in Access by<br>level of income so this is in two big<br>cities one called lavala the other<br>Montreal in Quebec uh two of the biggest<br>cities in Quebec<br>um and uh it shows that lower income<br>families who were less likely to be in<br>the cpes the higher income families were<br>more likely to be in those better<br>quality not-for-profit centers it's a<br>recognized problem but it's a difficult<br>one to solve<br>um and it came back's child staff child<br>ratios are not good enough particularly<br>at the infant level if you look on the<br>left hand side there this is showing all<br>of the different provinces uh of Canada<br>and it shows the number of children<br>first F member for a one-year-old and<br>you can see that the Quebec<br>line that's the black one extends<br>farther than in all the other provinces<br>in other words the staff child graciers<br>are worse in Quebec for one-year-olds<br>and they're not very good for<br>two-year-olds either so that is a<br>continuing problem that has to be dealt<br>with in Quebec<br>the supply and demand situation for<br>child care in Quebec is really odd there<br>isn't any longer inadequate Supply as I<br>said it Rose from 80 000 to 300<br>000 and 300 000<br>um it is you know is covers seventy<br>percent uh and more of the number of<br>children in that age group so there's no<br>longer inadequate Supply demand and<br>Supply are approximately in balance in<br>fact there are still no empty Child Care<br>spaces<br>but<br>there are over 50 000 children on<br>waiting lists for space but that's a<br>space in the not-for-profit and fixed<br>fee Services empty spaces and<br>market-based tax credit funded services<br>and uh shortages uh waiting lists for<br>those in the not for profits<br>so the enrollment rates back in 2019 as<br>an indicator 96 percent in the<br>not-for-profit child care centers and<br>Below 80 percent in the market-based<br>services so what's happening is that<br>parents are voting with their feed<br>really they're voting with their you<br>know with where they want to go and now<br>the Quebec government has developed a<br>plan to convert market-based services to<br>fixed these Services over the next five<br>years so they're going to convert 56 000<br>of those spaces that were set up using<br>the tax credit system and said Ah that's<br>been a failure the parents don't want<br>that and the key there is that the the<br>the tax credit services did not have a<br>fixed fee the not the for-profits could<br>charge whatever they wanted and the tax<br>credit would try and keep up with it the<br>government raised it from time to time<br>to keep up with the rising fees parents<br>don't like that at all and they don't<br>like the poor quality in those centers<br>so those two things have driven parents<br>away from the tax credit funded services<br>and back towards the fixed fee Services<br>now that there is some space<br>um so this is a I I liked this quote at<br>the bottom this is the president of the<br>organization representing the tax<br>credit-funded services saying to to the<br>premier of The Province you you can't do<br>this conversion of our centers into<br>fixed fee Services over five years<br>you've got to do it right away and why<br>is that our child care centers are going<br>to disappear before they can be<br>converted our educators are leading us<br>our parents are leaving us for child<br>care at at that time eight dollars and<br>seventy cents a day only the walls will<br>be left<br>I thought that was very<br>telling about what was going on with the<br>market-based child care services in<br>Quebec so the balance sheet on Quebec<br>child care it's very popular it's part<br>of the national identity that parents<br>and children<br>are going to be well supported parents<br>now have made it clear they want fixed<br>fee child care where fees are Dependable<br>predictable and low they want child care<br>which follows regulations on quality and<br>qualifications and pays their staff well<br>so that the Staffing is stable and<br>parents don't want fly-by-night child<br>care Quebec side experiment with lightly<br>regulated demand side funded funding for<br>for-profit sector that sets its own fees<br>didn't work and so the struggle to build<br>a good child care system continues but<br>it's gone a long way we are<br>very long distance along the way to<br>Universal child care and we have a<br>system that cannot be taken away<br>in Quebec with very many other positive<br>aspects to it<br>okay so rest of Canada and I'm going to<br>try and finish in three or four minutes<br>but<br>Sue tell you the rest of the story but<br>okay so we're looking at the rest of<br>Canada<br>and we now have a huge commitment to<br>build a child care system from the<br>federal government why is that important<br>well the federal government actually in<br>Canada according to our constitution<br>does not have responsibility for funding<br>child care<br>it can if it wants to but it's never<br>wanted to before so now we have this<br>huge commitment to building a child care<br>system and based explicitly on the<br>Quebec model so the the federal<br>government in its budget said we're<br>going to build a child care system in<br>the rest of Canada based on the Quebec<br>model of the cpes those not-for-profit<br>Child Care Centers so the promise is<br>that by 2026<br>Child Care will be available in across<br>Canada for ten dollars a day and<br>predominantly in the not-for-profit and<br>public sectors so we we do have<br>for-profit child care those are going to<br>be grandparented in<br>um and they're going to be some<br>expansion of the for-profits but<br>fundamentally the expansion will be<br>predominantly in the not-for-profit and<br>public sector that was part of the uh<br>agreement that was set out by the<br>federal government<br>there is however a huge Staffing crisis<br>and it when you're trying to expand<br>rapidly that crisis becomes incredibly<br>important<br>um and there's not enough support for<br>the expansion not enough Capital support<br>Sue's going to certainly talk about that<br>um built into the agreements that have<br>been signed and now we have the<br>for-profits circling around there's a<br>lot of money being put in a lot of money<br>being made available all of a sudden all<br>kinds of for-profits that never had any<br>interest in child care before a want to<br>come in but want not to provide<br>Financial accountability<br>so a general story quickly on the<br>candidate what's called The canada-wide<br>Early Learning and child care system<br>um this came it emerged during the<br>pandemic female labor force<br>participation had fallen dramatically in<br>Canada there was a lot of spending going<br>on to boost the economy and we had a<br>female Finance Minister Christian<br>Freeland who said hey<br>this is the time where we've got huge<br>problems with women in the labor force<br>we need to provide the path back to the<br>labor force for them and child care is a<br>really central part of that path so<br>um<br>in in 2021 the federal government in its<br>budget announced plans to spend<br>30 billion dollars over five years and<br>10 billion dollars approximately go<br>annually ongoing to build a Canada by<br>wide system uh and that included<br>substantial amounts for indigenous Child<br>Care specifically uh explicitly<br>following the Quebec model<br>um but as I said the the federal<br>government doesn't actually have<br>jurisdiction in this area but it's<br>allowed to reach Financial agreements<br>with a province or a territory if the<br>provinces or territories are willing and<br>so that's the mechanism that was used<br>the federal government said we're<br>willing to give you a lot of money if<br>you're willing to spend our money in<br>this kind of way and that's the<br>predominantly not for profit and moving<br>down to ten dollars a day<br>so all of the provinces and territory<br>signed agreements and drafted what are<br>called action plans promising<br>affordability ten dollars a day<br>eventually uh expansion uh often to a 59<br>coverage rate uh in each of the<br>provinces and territories uh quality<br>promises on quality on inclusion on<br>flexibility and very importantly that it<br>would the growth would be predominantly<br>in the not-for-profit and public sectors<br>um just as a side note if you don't know<br>Canada well it's about 39 million<br>population there's 2.3 million children<br>zero to five years of age this set of<br>agreements all this money that we're<br>talking about applies only to zero to<br>five years of age it doesn't apply to<br>school age children once they've reached<br>a sort of compulsory school<br>um and if they did reach a 59 coverage<br>rate that'd be about 1.3 million 70<br>coverage which is what Quebec is now<br>would be 1.6 million and we've got about<br>750 000 spaces right now so what we're<br>talking about is a doubling of the<br>number of child care early childhood<br>education spaces that are available<br>um and the existing action plans will<br>only cover about a third of this so<br>we're going to be working on this for<br>um okay a couple of words about this<br>transformation to supply side funding we<br>have fundamentally been a demand side<br>funded system in the past that's been<br>the most important we had a Child Care<br>Subsidy system for a low-income families<br>and then some operating grants coming in<br>on the supply side to keep parent fees<br>from rising and so up until now it's<br>mainly been funded by parent fees in a<br>market system<br>um and and we've had substantial amounts<br>of not-for-profit care<br>transformation to a supply side system<br>requires major changes it requires fixed<br>fees this I would argue is actually one<br>of the biggest mistakes that New Zealand<br>has made we can talk about that if you<br>like but it has a supply side funded<br>system but it hasn't fixed the fees and<br>so fees have spiraled out of control in<br>New Zealand and certainly in other<br>countries that are funded on the demand<br>side but it requires fixed fees as<br>they've developed in Quebec operating<br>funding to cover legitimate costs and<br>cost variations wage and benefit grid<br>that operators must pay so you've got to<br>pay decent wages to keep uh<br>well-educated staff it requires serious<br>Financial accountability and Reporting<br>requirements again we can talk about<br>that but without those accountability<br>and Reporting requirements you don't<br>have a public system that is publicly<br>planned and publicly accountable you<br>need public planning mechanisms for the<br>expansion of supplies so the way in<br>which the supply expands is going to be<br>quite different in this kind of a system<br>it can be a mix of not-for-profit<br>for-profit and public operators but it<br>has to be completely dominated by an<br>ethos if not for profit and public<br>service<br>um so in the rest of Canada outside of<br>Quebec there are a whole lot of issues<br>one is the provincial territorial<br>jurisdiction it's a strength in some<br>sense because different provinces can<br>innovate and do different things that<br>are<br>good well designed for their particular<br>uh Geographic and population situation<br>but it's a big weakness because there<br>isn't political accountability so when<br>provinces and territories sign these<br>agreements in Canada<br>they didn't make an agreement with their<br>own citizens to do that they made an<br>agreement with the federal government so<br>now a bunch of them are wandering off<br>and doing things that you know really<br>violate either the spirit or the letters<br>of what they agreed to with the federal<br>government so there's slippage which is<br>important<br>um there's no federal and few provincial<br>territory plans or serious money for<br>expansion of not-for-profit and public<br>centers there's too much attention and<br>funding focused on the political win<br>which is the ten dollars a day<br>affordability which parents like and not<br>enough on transforming the system<br>um and there's not yet enough money in<br>high cost jurisdictions to finish the<br>job and as I say here there's the<br>circling of the Sharks for-profits<br>complaining about discrimination<br>advocating Choice lobbying like mad to<br>some they seem like a solution<br>we know from Quebec that actually uh<br>letting them dominate the system<br>in a big way is is a huge mistake and<br>not a solution it's something that will<br>be regretted anyway that's uh it for me<br>yeah all right thank you very much for<br>all um welcoming us to New Zealand<br>albeit virtually we'd much rather be<br>here in person because we love New<br>Zealand but for today it's going to have<br>to be uh on Zoom so it's very nice to be<br>here and see you all some of whom I've<br>met and many many I haven't so thank you<br>very much for inviting us<br>um as Linda said I'm actually now the<br>president of an organization called<br>building blocks for childcare and I<br>thought I'd talk a bit about why we need<br>this organization called building blocks<br>for childcare and really we established<br>it in 2005 when the liberal government<br>and that day made its first foray into<br>creating a national child care system<br>and unfortunately so what we realized at<br>that point was oh my goodness if we're<br>having a national Child Care System we<br>actually have to have a body that can<br>actually expand and public and<br>non-profit child care because if we<br>don't the um the corporate the child<br>care<br>operators will come in and basically<br>take over<br>and we uh we've always in our in the<br>advocacy movement and have always been<br>very strong proponents of public and<br>not-for-profit profit Early Learning and<br>child care<br>so in um 2005 as they say we did create<br>building blocks for childcare known as<br>b2c2<br>um but it was<br>um we have we we actually had a<br>conservative government elected about a<br>year later the first action of that<br>government was to cancel all the<br>agreements for the national plan and So<br>eventually b2c2<br>um had to sort of back off<br>and but when we received this<br>announcement from our finance minister<br>physio Freeland in 2021 we realized okay<br>we better get it going again and I think<br>that<br>um the reason we we thought we needed<br>this organization is because in Canada<br>the<br>um and I'll talk a bit about the history<br>about this in a minute but in Canada<br>we've been very obsessed with advocacy I<br>mean there have been a lot of feminist<br>socialists unionists and educational<br>reformers that have fought very hard to<br>expand and improve the quality of our<br>early learning and child care system<br>but the problem is we've never had a<br>service organization that has been able<br>to go out and actually create new<br>not-for-profit child care it's it's been<br>very<br>um uh it's been it's just been very<br>um occasional so that occasionally the<br>governments would have a bit of a<br>capital money that non-profits would get<br>or the municipalities would get a<br>windfall in some way or another and we'd<br>be able to expand a bit the<br>not-for-profit system but in general<br>it's it's not like a child care center<br>has the<br>um in has any interest in expansion like<br>our child care centers are nearly all<br>run by well not all but most of them are<br>run by parent boards and what do parents<br>want parents actually want good service<br>for their children while their children<br>are there they don't want their<br>directors or their staff to go out and<br>have meetings with with corporate with<br>potential corporate um<br>um Charities to actually you know do<br>expansion they really want their their<br>fees to be used to actually<br>um make sure that the childcare their<br>own children get good services so<br>there's a bit of a conflict of interest<br>in a way between developing<br>not-for-profit child care and<br>um and and an operating parent-run<br>Community Driven child care centers<br>um so that's a little bit of background<br>about why we set up because really they<br>don't know how to go about it so we<br>developed all these various<br>um programs and services that we thought<br>we we could help<br>to provide in order to be able to help<br>um local programs expand without them<br>having to take away a lot of their own<br>resources and and put them into<br>expansion<br>um<br>yeah so that's the the four major things<br>that we see ourselves doing is that we<br>would support all the agencies and<br>programs that are applying for funding<br>so helping them through all of that<br>process of risk assessment and budgeting<br>and financial management and<br>um getting your design together and<br>um getting approvals from government all<br>of that sort of stuff is is one aspect<br>of our our<br>um our agenda the second one is to help<br>expand existing programs from their<br>current enrollment to full operating<br>capacity and you're probably like us<br>during covet there was a huge shrinkage<br>of actual usage of childcare spaces and<br>so we're building we're still building<br>back that operational capacity so<br>helping with that is another feature of<br>our program and then thirdly we see that<br>you know we have a lot of programs about<br>65 of our programs in Ontario are in<br>schools so um there's a lot of capacity<br>in schools to be able to renovate and<br>retrofit to expand the existing centers<br>to provide more spaces and then finally<br>we are also there to help<br>um at Childcare centers to be able to<br>select<br>an architect do the design and to<br>construct and and to go through with the<br>whole construction process and I<br>probably should have mentioned before<br>why we think this is so important and<br>you think well why would you even bother<br>if it's just happily gotten the majority<br>of not-for-profit child care and things<br>are in the country I mean we have a<br>majority of not-for-profit charges and<br>things that seem to be moving along why<br>do you need to do this and the reason<br>really is because there is going to be<br>so much money in the system if we're<br>reducing parent fees down to ten dollars<br>a day<br>with with the government paying 80 to 90<br>percent of the operating costs that is<br>what attracts the um The for-profit<br>Operators to the honey pot and they will<br>swirl around because they see this as a<br>great opportunity to enhance profits and<br>so realizing this we figured this is why<br>we have to have an organization not only<br>that advocates for better better<br>programming better funding and so on but<br>also actually helps to get these these<br>programs up and running because the<br>demand is going to be so huge within a<br>few years now we're already seeing it<br>we're already in crisis I mean one of<br>our board members runs actually has a<br>um has 16 centers non-profit centers in<br>her area and<br>um there their waiting lists are already<br>at a thousand children on the waiting<br>list and<br>um you know they're just there's just no<br>way that those parents are going to be<br>to get that without<br>um without without a supply without an<br>increase in Supply so we see ourselves<br>as part of the solution<br>and um it's we're really an early<br>learning and child care expansion agency<br>and we're very much really like<br>something you probably have too which is<br>associations of co-op housing non-profit<br>housing social you know Community<br>um Recreation programs<br>Etc and our our mode of Opera modus<br>operandi is really about collaborating<br>and liaising with municipalities School<br>boards Child Care programs and community<br>and Indigenous organizations so all of<br>that is what we we are trying to work on<br>we have a very talented team we we when<br>we decided to set this up we realized we<br>can't just have childcare people in this<br>we have to have people who are really<br>experienced in managing expanding and<br>operating Early Learning and child care<br>programs we need to have Architects we<br>need to have people who've been in the<br>housing sector and have done a lot of<br>non-profit housing or co-op housing we<br>need<br>um you know even Educators we've got<br>Early Childhood Educators we also have<br>to make sure that we represent a diverse<br>and inclusive and the diversity and<br>inclusivity of our population and from<br>across the province as well as everybody<br>being very dedicated to non-profit and<br>public and I should say to Linda nowhere<br>not just about private expansion of<br>private non-profit all of us would<br>prefer public<br>but it's just that in in in this<br>particular uh conjunction it's it's you<br>know the public agencies are just being<br>assaulted they're they're not getting<br>any money they're feeling like they have<br>to privatize it's not a good<br>um it's not a good moment in history for<br>um for for us to to um to suggest that<br>all the municipalities take over and run<br>our early learning and child care<br>programs it wouldn't work in fact a lot<br>of them have already divested the<br>programs that they they once had<br>see so the context for this is and I'm<br>only saying this because<br>um it's been such an important part of<br>um the whole struggle such an important<br>part that the Prime Minister<br>acknowledged in his announcement about<br>the 30 billion dollars for the national<br>Child Care strategy he acknowledged that<br>this has come about because of 40 Years<br>of advocacy on the part of advocates for<br>early learning and child care and it all<br>started back in 1970 when we had a raw<br>Commission on the status of women that<br>recommended Universal daycare it was<br>called in those days and I just want to<br>make the point that language changes<br>over time so we don't like to get bogged<br>down on language you know daycare it was<br>once child care it then became so that<br>we made sure we took into account the<br>needs of Chef workers and and so on and<br>then we moved on to Early Learning and<br>child care to represent the facts that<br>our unified position is that the child<br>is always at the center of the struggle<br>but it's also really important for the<br>for the the whole system to be organized<br>in such a way that it allows<br>particularly women but families too to<br>actually be able to organize their lives<br>so they can work and so that we don't<br>see a backsliding of women's equality so<br>so we've got those two aims that are<br>very interlocked in our movement anyway<br>and the other thing that's always been<br>very fundamental is that is is the push<br>for founding and the push particularly<br>for direct operational funding on the<br>supply side as God would say as an<br>economist where we've always pushed for<br>it let's not have parent fees let's<br>let's make the government pay<br>so this this was one of the reasons why<br>this has been a very good move in Canada<br>that we've had this huge amount of money<br>and that it's gone to construct a system<br>the problem is that because it's so<br>politically popular to reduce the fees<br>of the parents right it meant that the<br>federal government<br>decided that they were going to put 80<br>for 88 of their funding into reducing<br>fees and only four percent into<br>improving the wages of of the of the<br>staff which are appalling in Canada<br>and also that there was very little<br>Capital Money In order to be able to<br>expand to meet and demand so you can see<br>we've got this we really have this um uh<br>dichotomy where it's great that we have<br>this money it's great that the parent<br>fees are going to be reduced and we're<br>going to have a fixed fee system but<br>without these other pieces it's not<br>going to work and so we're we are we are<br>part of the solution that we're building<br>blocks for childcare but we also<br>um recognize that<br>um there has to be continued advocacy in<br>order to be in order to challenge the uh<br>particularly The for-profit Operators<br>who are really swirling at this point<br>they are really making making a huge<br>noise about how they should be included<br>how parents should have their choices<br>acknowledge how they can do it more<br>efficiently how it's their very good<br>quality all of these things that um we<br>are trying to get away from because we<br>want a publicly funded system might<br>include some for-profits that we want it<br>to be publicly managed<br>um<br>so that's um I think that's I think God<br>went through this we had the strategy we<br>have the federal budget with 30 billion<br>over five years and 9.2 billion after<br>that continuing every year<br>the reduction of fees to ten dollars a<br>day<br>and um as I said it will create huge<br>demand which we're already seeing and um<br>the government has so far and they put<br>this in legislation by the way the<br>legislation has been tabled it hasn't<br>passed yet but they've got this in<br>legislation that growth in spaces will<br>prom predominantly be in the public and<br>not for profit sectors<br>underpinning all of our work in the<br>advocacy movements are the the the four<br>principles high quality<br>um<br>which really means for most of us highly<br>qualified staff that's how we see high<br>quality the way we would measure it is<br>mainly around the quality of the<br>qualifications of the staff<br>um a universality we're not a nation<br>that um like we're not a nation that<br>actually<br>leans towards targeting we actually<br>believe in Universal programs in Canada<br>we have a universal medical system we<br>believe that nobody should be able to<br>pay extra in order to be able to get<br>better health care because they're<br>richer we believe in Universal education<br>and 97 of children in Canada attend<br>public education schools right we<br>believe in a public you know libraries<br>and<br>um<br>uh of obviously old age pensions and<br>things like that so we have we're lucky<br>that we have this Universal kind of<br>perspective that we can carry forward<br>because otherwise I think we'd be ending<br>up having you know only a lot of child<br>care for poor kids and then we would be<br>segregating and it it wouldn't be so<br>good but as Gordon mentioned earlier we<br>still have to emphasize that the most<br>organized parents are still able to get<br>their kids into these programs much<br>easier than low-income kids so we still<br>have to make sure that we have programs<br>that are geared to making sure that<br>they're that these programs are<br>accessible<br>so affordability and accessibility is<br>another key of our key Unity principle<br>of ours<br>and by accessible we also mean<br>accessible to children with special<br>needs whatever they are making sure that<br>there are resources enough resources in<br>the system to pay for their inclusion in<br>in jailcast and affordability we seem to<br>have won that one but you know it may<br>result in problems but um that's that's<br>always been a key for us and then the<br>public or non-profit is the other major<br>principle guiding principle<br>so um yeah<br>um I think now that God and I would be<br>happy to answer questions if we have<br>enough time left<br>thank you very much<br>thank you so so much CEO and golden it<br>was really amazing to to hear all these<br>actually like stories from uh<br>kind of taking that Universal principle<br>to a childhood to also kind of facing<br>some issues that we have already don't<br>have like that sort of um uh like luxury<br>so I'm actually looking at a couple of<br>questions raised in the chat box and I'm<br>wondering would people who wrote those<br>questions would like maybe to read them<br>out or they would like us to read the<br>questions one of the first boss from<br>um David Cook<br>if I'm pronouncing the the<br>name right<br>well yes thank you very much and it's a<br>very straightforward question that Linda<br>Mitchell has<br>addressed for many years as I understand<br>ECE in New Zealand it's largely or<br>mostly uh private for-profit that seems<br>to me totally counter to the Quebec<br>okay<br>yeah<br>I'll try a a bit of that<br>um I mean you're asking the question of<br>course<br>um and it's it's not easy I mean in some<br>sense the starting point is to get<br>agreement or to<br>publicize to argue to suggest to get<br>governments to agree<br>that fundamentally what we're doing here<br>is we're designing a public service<br>that's what it is<br>if it's Universal<br>it is a public service it's delivered by<br>private operators<br>but it's a public service<br>okay now if you agree that it's a public<br>service there are a lot of things that<br>go along with that<br>so should it be the Australian example I<br>don't know whether kiwis love or hate<br>Australians but I'll give some negative<br>things about Australia here I mean<br>they've got a child care system in<br>Australia where the fees just keep going<br>up and up and up and up and every<br>successive government comes along and<br>says throw more money at it you know<br>hire subsidies for parents it's going to<br>be funded on the parent side but oh the<br>fees keep going up and we can't you know<br>it's it's a disaster<br>well yeah it's a disaster because you<br>designed it as if it were a market<br>service<br>you decided you can't control the fees<br>you can't set the fees because it's a<br>market and you've got to fund the<br>parents and the parents are then going<br>to pay for it and the parents then<br>become The Gatekeepers for how the<br>market works well I'm sorry but when<br>you're paying the majority of the money<br>from government the parents aren't a<br>very good gatekeeper I mean it's not<br>like a private Market I teach economics<br>right and I mean there's a lot of people<br>that say<br>that somehow or other this is a market<br>it's competition and that works<br>wonderfully and uh you know we're going<br>to get these wonderful results if we<br>fund on the demand side because we've<br>learned the theory of competitive<br>markets in our first year of University<br>well that theory doesn't apply to this<br>Market I'm sorry it doesn't apply to<br>this sector I mean in many ways which we<br>could discuss but but basically no it's<br>a public service that we're designing so<br>that means a whole bunch of things for<br>me at least it means yes you're going to<br>set the fees yes there's going to be<br>strong measures of financial<br>accountability they're going to be<br>strong measures of reporting there's<br>going to be a huge amount of government<br>funding that goes into it but we're<br>going to try and run it for the<br>interests of the children and the<br>parents who it's supposed to serve so<br>all of the decisions all the policy that<br>we set up have to be designed to make it<br>into a public service well once you have<br>that lens of a public service once it's<br>really accepted the lenses that public<br>service<br>the issue of for-profit becomes weird<br>like why would you you know now let let<br>me get this straight<br>and this is what I've argued in Canada<br>we can have for-profits in the child<br>care sector<br>but they need to accept the rules of the<br>game and the rules of the game are yes<br>we our objective is to deliver a public<br>service and all of the things that go<br>along with that and that means controls<br>on the amount of profit that you earn<br>and you know a financial accountability<br>and assessments of quality and<br>monitoring of the services you provide<br>and so on and that goes along with it if<br>you are willing as a for-profit operator<br>to accept those rules of the game then<br>you can join with the not-for-profits<br>and the publics in delivering the<br>service we don't want a majority for<br>profit because in general what happens<br>is they then begin to rewrite the rules<br>of the game but you know it it there is<br>a possibility of grandparenting in the<br>existing for-profits<br>um and and having them accept the rules<br>of the game and then that can work so<br>anyway that's that's the way I see it<br>thank you Gordon um<br>I I just add a couple of very quick<br>things I mean in terms of actions I<br>think that as God said earlier that the<br>fact that they did these quality surveys<br>in Quebec was very powerful because<br>um you know I mean what do parents know<br>often about quality they don't but if<br>you actually do studies that are well<br>publicized that show that the quality is<br>better in the not not-for-profit sector<br>that can go a long way to actually<br>beginning to make the case and the<br>second thing I'd say is that pushing for<br>this Bixby system is a really<br>interesting way to to to to separate the<br>top the top from the chat from the wheat<br>because you know then<br>um you'll find most of the for-profit<br>operators will not want that system and<br>um but governments can be persuaded that<br>it's much more beneficial to them<br>than it than um than the um the tax<br>credit way of doing things but I know<br>you have different anyway in New Zealand<br>but I I would argue for a fixed wait a<br>low fixed speed system<br>thank you<br>hmm<br>amazing amazing questions and a response<br>thank you so so much we have probably<br>time for one more question although in<br>the chat box we got uh<br>I think three four five different<br>versions so I'm uh uh like wondering<br>which one would uh the actually there is<br>not no name I think it is<br>you like just to ask one of these I'm<br>sorry we will be um like just dancing<br>probably one if you like just to pick up<br>maybe one<br>um sure I guess um well you know I had<br>quite a few questions but<br>um<br>perhaps uh answered a little bit by Sue<br>in her presentation but<br>um I I wondered whether the opening up<br>in 2005 to the the sort of tax credits<br>type approach and Quebec was about<br>um expansion not being fast enough in<br>the number of places from the<br>um fixed fee services and if that's the<br>case then what were the barriers to<br>growth um for those services<br>yeah maybe I'll say a couple of things<br>but it's entirely goes into Sue's<br>presentation which is to say yes the<br>barriers were<br>that's the not-for-profits it's not<br>their mission to expand in general<br>that's not their DNA right I mean they<br>don't think of expansion as the thing<br>that they're trying to do whereas the<br>for-profits say yeah how do I make more<br>profit you know my mission is to expand<br>so there it means that you do have to<br>provide a lot of uh support of the kinds<br>that Sue was talking about in order to<br>get over that barrier but but your<br>initial instinct is completely right<br>which is the the government argued that<br>the reason why they had to turn to the<br>for-profit sector was to expand Supply<br>quickly and they did expand Supply<br>quickly but they now are regretting what<br>they did so it's it's a it's a bad<br>bargain that they ended up with<br>so now the other thing that is<br>absolutely critical and<br>um we're facing now is the lack of<br>capital because of course the corporate<br>sector has access to Capital that's what<br>they are really is in investment houses<br>right whether it's in real estate or<br>financial uh or financial equities or<br>whatever and in the not the profit<br>sector banks are not interested in<br>funding us you know they just don't want<br>to do it they they they they don't think<br>we're a good risk they don't think that<br>um they don't like the public perception<br>of what have we failed we'd have to pull<br>we'd have to close down our non-profits<br>at the center there's just very bad<br>there's very few possibilities for<br>Capital expansion in the not-for-profit<br>sector which is why we're really pushing<br>the federal government to<br>um to introduce a program of um loan<br>guarantees either through a crown<br>Corporation or through a land trust or<br>just through an actual program where<br>they would give loan guarantees and then<br>we would be able to get the money back<br>through<br>um through up through good operational<br>um uh budgets right<br>um so that's that that is a huge problem<br>and then we're also exploring well is<br>there a way that we can put together<br>some kind of charitable Trust<br>that that actually can raise money for<br>Capital but that's down the road but all<br>of these things are huge in terms of<br>this this this this fight and if we if<br>we can't put them all together we're not<br>going to win<br>they're much more powerful than we are<br>so you'll have to wish us luck<br>um if I could just ask my final two<br>questions about the um I guess your<br>slide where you had the fixed fee<br>um services are less accessible or<br>low-income families are less likely to<br>access those Services than high income<br>families are you able to talk about why<br>that why that what the drivers for that<br>are or why that might be<br>yeah I think Sue alluded to it which is<br>you know we're talking about mechanisms<br>that really don't have anything to do<br>with the child care system in some way<br>they have to do with the way in which<br>society is right and so you know it's<br>powerful it's difficult which is you<br>know middle class parents they know<br>where things are and they're they're<br>also sure that they're gonna be in the<br>labor force off of the mothers are<br>whereas in a low-income family it's you<br>know might cycle in and out of the labor<br>force so you're not quite sure should I<br>move quickly to get a child care space<br>so the middle class families move<br>quickly they have good networks of<br>information they know the studies and<br>they say yeah the cpes are really good<br>quality let's put our kids in there so<br>that's the kind of thing that you're<br>fighting against so these are normal<br>mechanisms so you do have to then build<br>into the child care system ways to fight<br>against these normal tendencies in<br>society that's that's true but but the<br>mechanisms are really have to do with<br>yeah<br>another it's just something are those<br>are those services not located in those<br>communities or is that something that<br>might be a barrier as well or is it less<br>more just about the labor force<br>participation of Lord not particularly<br>because I mean one of the things about<br>middle class families is that they're<br>prepared to drive anywhere to get their<br>child care bad cause for one thing and<br>so if they can get their name on the<br>waiting list ahead of everybody else<br>then you know they can they can drive<br>one kid here and one kid somewhere else<br>I mean that's the kind of story you have<br>of parents going all over town in order<br>to get the best childcare or they're on<br>a transit route so it doesn't<br>necessarily mean I mean our government<br>is now actually targeted the latest<br>expansion spaces to Priority<br>neighborhoods but that doesn't mean<br>unless you and as you do a lot of really<br>priority targeting which we don't tend<br>to go into as I explained in Canada<br>unless you do priority targeting then<br>that's not going to do the trick it's<br>that we're going to have to have much<br>more proactive measures<br>um and I just wanted to tell the story<br>about um uh very quickly that you know<br>we have these alternative schools in our<br>public education system that are really<br>great and they're completely dominated<br>by middle class parents who know all<br>about how you go and queue up at eight<br>o'clock in the morning on on sept you<br>know the day of enrollment and they know<br>how to get their kids in and so on and<br>so forth it's no accident that they're<br>more organized to actually access it's<br>not that the others are excluded it's<br>just that as God says it's the way<br>Society capitalist Society really works<br>I let me just say one final thing though<br>because I had this debate with a<br>journalist<br>um which was who who<br>information about Quebec and said oh<br>well they have the low-income families<br>that the whole system in Quebec is<br>terrible if you do the comparison in<br>between the system and the rest of<br>Canada and the system in Quebec even<br>though relative to higher income<br>families low-income families in Quebec<br>have done worse nonetheless relative to<br>the rest of Canada where we had a market<br>fee system low-income families did much<br>much better in child care many many more<br>of them were in child care and gained<br>benefits from it so they they they're<br>not in the best child care in Quebec not<br>in as big numbers as the high income<br>families but again the comparison is<br>more yeah we got to do better in a<br>universal system in Quebec but that<br>Universal system is already doing much<br>better for low-income families even<br>though it's not good enough<br>mm-hmm<br>I think the problem too is that systems<br>are very complicated it's it's really<br>hard to<br>um now you narrow them down to a few<br>paragraphs to explain them all<br>especially when you have 13 provinces<br>and territories<br>um all of which have completely<br>different<br>um legislation and and policy actually<br>so it's hard to you know synchronize it<br>all<br>thank you thank you so so much<br>so many more<br>unfortunately we don't have more time<br>and what I would suggest probably is<br>that people were asking about maybe some<br>Publications or maybe some reports that<br>they can access<br>um and probably gain more understanding<br>about the system and probably<br>inspiration what we can do in the<br>context of New Zealand and in context of<br>our issues that we are facing which<br>actually are somewhat similar to to<br>yours in Canada<br>um yeah you can you can send questions<br>on to us I mean I I think I'm happy if<br>you share uh my email Sue might well be<br>as well<br>um you know for other questions or stuff<br>I I also have a Blog that I regularly<br>publish on and there's a bunch of stuff<br>on for profit and not-for-profit Child<br>Care on it you know most of it is<br>Canadian but some of it is in relation<br>to other countries I even did one on the<br>New Zealand funding system recently<br>but<br>you can share that the address to that<br>blog<br>so you already put a link to your<br>organization website yeah yeah if you<br>want to see more detail what we do and<br>we also have studies and reports and so<br>on that they're up on our website yeah<br>that would be brilliant and I think that<br>would probably uh address so many other<br>questions that people might ask thank<br>you all so so much for coming today it<br>was absolute privileged to have two<br>amazing speakers and so many uh amazing<br>questions and probably uh many more that<br>you couldn't address at
