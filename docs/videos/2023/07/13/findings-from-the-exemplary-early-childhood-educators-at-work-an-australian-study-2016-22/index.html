seminar<br>organized by the wilf Malcolm Institute<br>of educational research at University of<br>waikato my name is Olivera caminares I'm<br>senior lecturer in the division of<br>education and also co-director of early<br>years Research Center I'm very pleased<br>to host this seminar and see so many of<br>you today thank you so much for coming<br>before we introduce our two brilliant<br>speakers Professor Linda Harrison and<br>Professor Sandy Wong I would like just<br>to mention couple of house heaping rules<br>the seminar will be recorded and for<br>that reason please keep yourself on you<br>during the presentation you would if you<br>would like to ask ask any questions<br>during the presentation and open any<br>kind of question to discussion after the<br>presentation pill is please type your<br>questions in the chat box<br>uh so I would invite Professor Linda<br>Mitchell to introduce our uh two lovely<br>speakers and uh thank you so much Alinda<br>on really a very warm welcome to you<br>both I'm really pleased to be<br>introducing you for this seminar I think<br>the early years Research Center members<br>have had an especially collaborative<br>friendly productive relationships with<br>both of you and was your colleagues that<br>goes back over actually more than a<br>decade<br>um for when you were working at Charles<br>Stewart's University in Bathurst and<br>we've held reciprocal visits over the<br>years we've taken part in research<br>collaborations presentations publishing<br>Ventures and the topics have been really<br>diverse infant and toddler care and<br>education belonging and continuity<br>integrated said Early Childhood<br>provision and a few of us even dabbled<br>in your time use diaries that you're<br>going to be talking about today<br>um we didn't get as far as you got in<br>relation to our research with that but<br>it was very<br>um amazing to do it so Linda Harrison is<br>a professorial research fellow in early<br>childhood education at Macquarie<br>University she's Adjunct professor of<br>early childhood education at Charles<br>sturt University and Linda's research is<br>really highly regarded<br>um I think for the use of mixed methods<br>methodologies and really Innovative<br>methodologies as well<br>looking at current issues in Early<br>Childhood Education and Care settings<br>and I think your research Linda has<br>really influenced policy and pedagogy<br>not only in Australia but<br>worldwide and definitely in New Zealand<br>as well<br>so Linda has led investigations of<br>children's experiences of early<br>childhood education and child care we<br>don't tend to use that word now in New<br>Zealand child care<br>teach a child relationships systems<br>structures and processes that support<br>high quality Education and Care and the<br>Early Childhood Workforce and the impact<br>of early childhood education on<br>children's development<br>and then Sandy Sandy Wong is also at<br>Macquarie University where she's<br>professor and she's a research fellow<br>with good start early learning<br>and that's a large not-for-profit Early<br>Childhood organization in Australia and<br>Sandy is particularly highly regarded<br>for taking part in very collaborative<br>research not only with<br>practitioners but also academics<br>organizations and governments and really<br>wanting to make I think a positive<br>difference for Quality Early Childhood<br>practices<br>in early childhood settings so her<br>current work investigates Early<br>Childhood practices Workforce issues<br>educator well-being and the history of<br>early childhood internationally so I'll<br>hand over to both of you now and I'm<br>really looking forward to your<br>presentation<br>thank you thank you very much Linda and<br>Oliveira for inviting us and for<br>organizing this at a time that works<br>well for us as well as as for you<br>um we'd like to start by acknowledging<br>the traditional owners of the lands at<br>Charles Stuart University the veragere<br>nation and at Macquarie but guatematical<br>clan of a dark nation whose cultures and<br>Customs have nurtured and continue to<br>nurture these lands since the dream time<br>we pay our respects to Elders past<br>present and future<br>so thank you again for inviting us to<br>present on this project examining what<br>it takes to be a high quality Early<br>Childhood educator<br>we'd like to acknowledge the team whose<br>names you can see there on the slide<br>with special thanks to the research<br>assistants who helped us with<br>recruitment with data management with<br>preliminary data analysis and throughout<br>the study their insights and broader<br>contributions to what we discussed at<br>our regular monthly meetings<br>we also acknowledge the ongoing support<br>of our eight partner organizations<br>who've been with us since 2016 and this<br>study was extended because of covid<br>um to longer than it had originally been<br>intended<br>um so our our partner organizations<br>include providers of Early Childhood<br>Education and Care unions and advocacy<br>organizations all of whom make an<br>important contribution uh to the field<br>and of course we want to give special<br>thanks to the Educators who participated<br>in the project and without them well<br>basically we'd have nothing to tell you<br>today<br>so Sandy if you could just go on to the<br>next slide this just gives you an<br>overview of the presentation<br>thank you Sandy um<br>Sandy and I will team tag between these<br>these topics<br>um and as our specific you know<br>contributions and expertise to the study<br>um is best able to speak to<br>um at the end we hope to have as<br>Oliveira has said opportunities for<br>questions and your comments and just to<br>give us an idea of your thoughts as<br>we're going through it would be helpful<br>if you could write them in the chat and<br>they'll be monitored by Lindon and<br>Oliveira so that we can make sure that<br>we respond to to critical issues that<br>come up from you<br>so Sandy over to you for the first part<br>on background and problem<br>thanks Linda so what we thought we'd do<br>is um just start by giving you a little<br>bit of a<br>background to the context and uh what's<br>happening in Australia<br>um at the moment it's actually what gave<br>rise to the study but we we have a<br>problem at the moment in early childhood<br>education<br>um in uh terms of a crisis in early in<br>having Early Childhood Educators a<br>shortage but it's not actually a new<br>problem it's a problem that we've known<br>about for quite a while and it's what<br>really was the impetus for this study so<br>we've got a real problem with turnover<br>so back in 2015 2016 researchers like<br>our colleagues Sue Irvine and Karen<br>Thorpe identified that high turnover of<br>Early Childhood teachers and Educators<br>at about 20 to 21 and it's even higher<br>in our regional and remote areas so<br>there's a problem we turn over there's a<br>problem with retention and that means<br>that um that therefore the experiences<br>of the Educators in the services is<br>quite low so the the average tenure for<br>qualified Educators in their service is<br>only about three and a half years<br>and less than a third of Educators<br>actually have 10 or more years<br>experience so that means that um the<br>yeah the The<br>Experience within an organization is uh<br>within a service is not really there to<br>support the newer teachers coming new<br>teachers and Educators coming through<br>and just a little bit of um<br>explanation of that term I'm going to<br>use Educators when we mean everybody and<br>if we specifically mean teachers will<br>say teachers but the term Educators we<br>are meeting to Encompass educators of<br>all different the three different<br>qualification levels that we have here<br>which is a three qualification a diploma<br>and then the the three and four year<br>degrees<br>now so that we've got all these problems<br>but kovid really just exacerbated that<br>and many services are having trouble<br>filling permanent spaces and indeed in<br>getting casual staff when their staff<br>are off sick to try and get somebody to<br>come in and backfill those spaces<br>um they just aren't Educators around to<br>to fill those spots so we've got a<br>problem with retention and retention<br>and unfortunately it's not going to get<br>any better because we've got this<br>continual growth in early childhood and<br>that's going to be heightened by our new<br>labor governments pledge to greater<br>access for early childhood education now<br>of course we all want every child to<br>have access to early childhood education<br>that's not the issue it's just that we<br>don't have enough teachers to provide<br>that education<br>even our pre-election we um there was a<br>19 percent<br>estimated increase for the workforce<br>um and that the we're going to have a<br>shortage of about 37<br>000 Educators and which includes about 7<br>000 teachers by 2024<br>and I actually think it's going to be<br>much worse than that because these<br>figures came out pre-covered<br>now some people say oh well really what<br>all you need to do then is just get more<br>more students coming in to fill that Gap<br>well and sadly we've also got a problem<br>in attracting Educators into the field<br>and um there's evidence of a declining<br>supply of new Educators and teachers so<br>enrollment in tertiary education is<br>declining not expanding as it needs to<br>um and<br>um not not just that but then they're<br>not staying so they're coming into the<br>degree and then they're not completing<br>so we have an average of only 41 of<br>students enrolled in any Early Childhood<br>Program completing their studies it's<br>better in the vet sector<br>um with certificate three and diploma<br>Educators they finished about 60 of<br>those finish but for undergraduate<br>initiative teacher education programs<br>it's only about 51 so we're not going to<br>be able to meet that demand<br>so these are all problems that um our<br>colleague who was the original lead of<br>the program of the project The Early<br>Childhood exemplary Educators at work<br>project which Linda now leads but our<br>originally our friend and colleague<br>Professor Fran press<br>um was the one who sort of conceptual<br>initially conceptualized the problem and<br>what she alerted us to is this issue of<br>attracting retaining and sustaining<br>educators<br>so we what do we mean by that well<br>sometimes we attracting the wrong people<br>into the the sector<br>because there's sort of popular framing<br>of early childhood education as being<br>easy it erodes our capacity to attract<br>and retain the highly skilled Educators<br>that we need people come into the<br>profession thinking it's going to be<br>easy but those of us who work in the<br>sector know it's anything but easy work<br>um and underpinning that is that kind of<br>idea that uh working with young children<br>is easy work and it's natural for women<br>and it's maternalistic discourses<br>um so they come in with this kind of<br>idea that it's really easy and all I'm<br>going to do all day is play with<br>children and of course that's not what<br>we do all day we do play and it's<br>important but that's not what we do all<br>day and others come into the early<br>childhood education thinking it's going<br>to be like schooling<br>um and it's not early childhood<br>education has its own unique distinct<br>pedagogy and specialization like so so<br>if you're coming in thinking no it's<br>just I'm going to be a teacher that's<br>going to stand in front of a Blackboard<br>if those things exist anymore they<br>probably don't<br>um you would be<br>um sadly Mr Dakin<br>many come in because they love children<br>and that's fabulous you know you don't<br>want to come into this job if you don't<br>like children but it's not enough okay<br>coming in just thinking that you love<br>children is just not enough<br>so we're not attracting the right people<br>in we're not retaining them<br>um we're not<br>um preparing them appropriately for the<br>sector sometimes in our early charge of<br>teacher courses there are minimal<br>um content around it early years<br>sometimes people have dismal prac<br>placements and we lose them so we're and<br>then when they do come in we're losing<br>them to the early the school sector<br>um and because paying conditions are<br>better and who wouldn't<br>um<br>you know that we've got that to compete<br>with<br>and then when they're in we we have a<br>problem with sustaining them it is<br>highly complex work that early childhood<br>Educators do and it's getting more and<br>more so you work with children with<br>various qualifications various sorry<br>with Children of various ages and<br>abilities<br>Educators have various qualifications<br>the families sometimes have are facing<br>challenging situations there's onerous<br>legislation it's like running a small<br>business<br>um and you're not really getting the pay<br>at least they're not in Australia that<br>is commensurate to the work<br>and we're not looking after the<br>Educators properly<br>um we just don't give them the resources<br>in order to enable them to do their work<br>so that's kind of the background to this<br>study it's rewarding work<br>um and we know that high quality early<br>childhood education does make a<br>difference to Children's Learning and<br>Development<br>but sadly the opposite is also true poor<br>quality early childhood education is<br>detrimental to Children's Learning and<br>Development and especially to those that<br>are experiencing marginalization<br>and they're doubly jeopardized when the<br>early learning experience is also poor<br>and perhaps um their their challenges in<br>the home environment as well<br>and of course we can't it goes to be<br>sick we can't go without saying that<br>early childhood education is critical<br>it's a critical component of what is now<br>being called the care economy it's<br>essential work that keeps the nation<br>moving have you probably heard that<br>during covid<br>um but educate but it's not that sort of<br>magical thing that it doesn't just exist<br>on its own it's the Educators that<br>provide this early learning care and<br>education and it is the organizations<br>with which<br>um Early Childhood Educators work that<br>enable and sustain that work<br>so we really wanted to understand more<br>about well what is it that enables<br>um really high quality Early Learning<br>um for children that has the positive<br>outcomes for for them in terms of their<br>Learning and Development outcomes so<br>that's what kind of underpinned this<br>question<br>the the our study which and I'll just<br>hand over to Linda for this section<br>thanks Andy so if you just go on to the<br>next slide what this illustrates the<br>study design and the research questions<br>there we are okay so<br>um you can see here that there are four<br>driving research questions and they<br>fitted into the different phases of the<br>study<br>um and what it also illustrates is the<br>sequence we started at the top with um<br>phase one and then progressed through to<br>phase three<br>um what uh our use of a triangle<br>um<br>fits with is the number of uh of<br>participants so we started with a very<br>large number of participants in who are<br>we invited to complete the time use<br>diary we then reduced we selected from<br>that a smaller number to participate in<br>focus groups and then we went down to<br>the smaller number of case studies 10<br>identified case studies in some cases<br>the same centers had participated in all<br>three but we recruited at each stage of<br>the study<br>um<br>and the important part was that the<br>study kind of got although it got slower<br>in in Civic it got larger in terms of<br>complexity<br>but you'll learn about that as as we go<br>through<br>um so we just moved on to the next slide<br>we'll I'll start moving through some of<br>these different components the first<br>thing is is to think about the term<br>exemplary and how we then defined that<br>and how we ensure that the participants<br>were from exemplary centers and<br>therefore exemplary Educators so that<br>that sort of definition and rationale<br>can be questioned of course but that was<br>the way that we approached our<br>Recruitment and we recruited at each<br>stage of the study<br>using information from the Australian<br>children's Education and Care Quality<br>Authority or a sequel so they have we<br>have a regular quality assessment and<br>rating system in Australia that's been<br>in place since 2012 and all of these uh<br>ratings and assessments are recorded and<br>stored by a sequel uh at a national<br>level they all states and territories<br>participate all services under for<br>children under five participate if they<br>need or want to be able to access<br>government subsidies for their families<br>to meet the cost of care so it's pretty<br>comprehensive and<br>that allowed us to then identify centers<br>not only that it achieved exceeding so<br>the ratings are meeting the national<br>quality standard and then exceeding the<br>national quality standard and prior that<br>is working towards<br>um but we set a higher bar by saying<br>that in that in achieving exceeding we<br>wanted them to we wanted centers that<br>had achieved exceeding on all of the<br>seven underpinning quality areas<br>so just to give you the um the the<br>reality of that currently there's just<br>about a quarter of centers in Australia<br>that have an exceeding nqs rating but<br>nowhere near all of those centers will<br>have achieved exceeding on All Quality<br>areas and all seven they can be given an<br>overall rating with a specific number of<br>areas and specified areas that meet the<br>quality rating or quality area at<br>exceeding so we really are talking about<br>quite a specialized and small sample<br>but we really felt that that was the<br>only way then to find out what exemplary<br>education early childhood education is<br>like and what it takes to to sustain it<br>um so Sandy if you just go on to the<br>next one I'm going to speak about the<br>timely story findings that Linda's um<br>already mentioned was trialed and<br>thought of uh in at waikato and this<br>looks specifically at one question what<br>is the work and does does it vary across<br>qualification level and service types<br>so we just go on to how we developed<br>this method so Simon story methods<br>um<br>are um are traditionally from social<br>sciences and quite complicated they<br>either involve<br>um somebody writing a handwritten Diary<br>of everything they they've done during<br>the day<br>um and often that's by recollection at<br>the end of the day you think back and<br>write it all out line by line or you can<br>be doing it as you go or it tends to<br>involve somebody following along<br>observing someone and coding everything<br>that they do in um on a laptop or<br>something like that so either way it's<br>very intensive in terms of the demands<br>on the educator or the demands on the<br>researcher so we worked with um a<br>specialist in Time new story to develop<br>this app a smartphone app that would<br>allow people to complete a diary once at<br>the end of a randomly identified hour<br>and we asked people to do that just<br>twice today<br>typically time used Diaries gather three<br>lots of information what are people<br>doing where are they doing it and who<br>are they doing it with or who's there<br>while they're doing it and those were<br>the three parts of the time you Starry<br>that that we collected but the most<br>intensely<br>um one the most intense one in terms of<br>research was developing the categories<br>what are Educators doing and we did this<br>over quite a series of pilot work and<br>collaborative work and co-design work<br>with experts in the field<br>to identify these 10 categories that you<br>can see on the screen each category then<br>was broken down into subcategories<br>depending on the nature of the overall<br>category some had a large number of<br>subcategories some only had a small<br>number and each of those categories and<br>subclasses was then described<br>um with examples so the people<br>participating were given the kind of<br>information that would help them use<br>this time you Starry dot um smartphone<br>app<br>the next slides then show you a little<br>bit about what it looked like on the<br>smartphone so these are just quick<br>images of what it looked like and Sandy<br>you can just click through these so<br>um you've got a main category you choose<br>the main category and then within that<br>you choose the subcategory and then you<br>fill in how long you were doing that for<br>so an intensive hour has to be broken<br>down into a certain number of components<br>and six minutes was the largest<br>component that we could manage we<br>couldn't or the smallest component that<br>we could manage we couldn't go any<br>smaller than that and still fit it on<br>the phone and still make it meaningful<br>for people but<br>as you'll see later on people do quite a<br>lot uh in a six minute period<br>um so they would fill that in for each<br>activity and fill it in throughout each<br>of those fill in all the six minute<br>blocks how long they were doing it and<br>then they could also answer the next<br>question if they were doing a secondary<br>activity at the same time as the time<br>period they had just filled in and they<br>would do this the same fill in the same<br>information for that secondary activity<br>and that gave us a sense of multitasking<br>or when people are are basically doing<br>two activities within the same time<br>period either<br>um so if you just go on to the next<br>slide this is a sort of overview of a<br>summary of of what we found<br>um that gave us evidence of the<br>diversity of the work that people are<br>doing<br>um across those 10 categories the<br>intensity of the work how frequently<br>they were multitasking how long how many<br>tasks they did within an hour<br>and then we also looked at the<br>qualification levels and it was very<br>clear that no matter what qualification<br>all of those 10 categories were being<br>done by Educators during the day<br>so the next slide is giving you<br>um the actual image of what the data<br>looked like and and we'll I'll talk you<br>through this um because it's very pretty<br>but it's also quite complicated and<br>what we have here are the 10 categories<br>and each one is color coded<br>across a typical day<br>um this this summary is based on the<br>whole of the sample so 321 Educators who<br>gave us information for uh 6 36<br>000 entries of six minutes so a total of<br>about six thousand hours<br>um we analyzed it minute by minute with<br>a Time used diary expert analyst and<br>then she combined those into Columns of<br>15 minutes so when you look at this you<br>can pick a time of the day say for<br>example 9 15 or something between 9 and<br>15 and 9 30 and just look from top to<br>bottom and see on average overall<br>the amount of work that people were<br>doing in each of those 10 categories<br>so this showed us that all 10 domains<br>work or 10 categories were completed and<br>recorded across the day<br>uh for the whole for the sample as a<br>whole with overall averages of break<br>time about 12 and intentional teaching<br>about 10 of people's time and I'm just<br>going from the top down<br>being with children actually sorry I'm<br>um there's different colors so the being<br>with children is the larger one the<br>green that was about a third of people's<br>day the major part of of the day a<br>routine care emotional support<br>being less family communication<br>interestingly also still happening<br>across today organizing the room<br>planning and assessing and evaluating<br>Administration so you can see any<br>increases and the decreases of these<br>different activities during the day and<br>this summary slide here includes people<br>that worked in non-day care which is why<br>the time frame goes from seven in the<br>morning till seven at night but also and<br>preschool where the hours are are<br>shorter so some of the patterns are<br>reflective of the preschool participants<br>um but what this also shows us is that<br>educators are doing a lot of different<br>things every 15 minutes in each 15<br>minutes and by doing multiple things<br>there was this term that we you started<br>using of task rotation of doing<br>something for a very short period of<br>time and moving on to another and then<br>moving on to another and another<br>if we move into slide 19 then we'll just<br>look at some of the analyzes that we<br>conducted so first of all we looked at<br>whether there were differences in the<br>qualifications and whether work differed<br>by qualification<br>oops Sandy you got that<br>yeah okay so for some areas intentional<br>teaching uh stop development uh sorry<br>stuff yes stop development time like<br>professional learning time or providing<br>emotional support there was no<br>difference between qualifications as<br>Sandy said certificate level diploma<br>level and degree qualified teachers the<br>difference is where there were<br>differences were primarily between<br>degree qualified and certificate<br>qualified<br>and what we found was a degree qualified<br>staff spend more time in administrative<br>activities less time in just being with<br>children and less time in routine care<br>certificate qualified staff spend more<br>time in organizational tasks that's you<br>know tidying the room putting things<br>putting materials out and less time<br>planning and communicating with families<br>interestingly diploma qualified staff<br>were really in the middle of both of<br>those groups so they were similar to<br>certificate three staff in terms of<br>being with children and routine care and<br>administration and similar to degree<br>qualified staff in terms of<br>that time spent planning the time spent<br>organizing the room organizational tasks<br>and time spent communicating with<br>families<br>um the next part of this slide will be<br>about the task rotation so this<br>gives you a sense and they've said yeah<br>we've just got the graph there this is<br>the percentage of time the Educators<br>recorded their activities for each of<br>the number of changes of activity so<br>when they move from one activity to the<br>next so you can see the majority of<br>their entries in the time you started<br>were for six minutes or 12 minutes<br>very few of them had those longer<br>periods of doing something for an<br>um most entries were for that six or<br>twelve minute as I said and the second<br>thing we looked at was multitasking<br>which is the next part of the past so<br>what this is the green and the Orange is<br>showing you the number of times that<br>Educators filled in a secondary task so<br>even in those short periods of time the<br>majority<br>um were also suggesting that they did a<br>secondary task as well so overall we had<br>about 60 percent of entries also had a<br>um so just moving on to the next part<br>um sorry when we oh I won't go into that<br>I'm just saying that there was no<br>significant differences on on um task<br>rotation and multitasking for the three<br>different qualification groups so<br>regardless of qualification those graphs<br>looked pretty much the same for the<br>different participants<br>so now we look at the other thing that<br>was unique about the time you started we<br>were able to at the end of the hour ask<br>Educators how they felt about that<br>previous hour<br>and and look at questions about whether<br>that differed during the day so these<br>are the questions we were able to ask<br>about feeling rushed about satisfied<br>stressed and whether multiple demands<br>were made of them and these were rated<br>on a 10-point scale now typically when<br>you think about satisfaction people rate<br>that as a general impression of their<br>work whereas this is something we could<br>track hour by hour we could also track<br>it in relation to what people were doing<br>so this is quite General and summary<br>data that you're seeing here this allows<br>us the opportunity to do a lot more work<br>in terms of try to understand those<br>variations but in general what you can<br>see here is that satisfaction levels<br>were typically high and stayed pretty<br>high across the whole day that's the<br>black line at the top so ratings of<br>about seven or above on a 10 point scale<br>the yellow line is uh the feelings of um<br>being having multiple things asked them<br>and that sort of in the mid-range more<br>around four to five<br>um but again you can see the pattern<br>across today is very closely matched to<br>the other two lines which are feelings<br>of stress and feeling rushed so it it<br>vary by the time of day the ups and<br>downs by the time of day and we need to<br>look more closely to see if that was<br>tied to the sorts of things Educators<br>were actually doing in each of those<br>time slots across today<br>so<br>um I think I'm handing back to sandal<br>and she's going to take us on to the<br>second phase of the Sunday thanks Cindy<br>thanks Linda and what always amazes me<br>with the time you story is that um many<br>of you are probably thinking yeah well<br>we know that we know how we spend our<br>day but actually there was very little<br>evidence around how what educators are<br>doing all day every day in services and<br>now we've got the evidence and it it is<br>amazing evidence our time use diary<br>person had never seen such<br>um<br>rotation<br>um as so for example if I were to tell<br>you what I did all day I'd be sitting<br>down at the computer doing pretty much<br>the same thing whereas educators are<br>constantly changing<br>um so the time use diary is giving us<br>the evidence that says it's complex<br>multitasking work<br>so the next phase of the study then was<br>to we we took the findings from the time<br>use diary and we wanted to dig into this<br>a little bit more deeply and so we did<br>focus groups<br>um and the focus groups were with<br>Educators at each of the different uh<br>levels so we had focus groups of Center<br>directors we had focus groups of the<br>teachers<br>um and of the diploma qualified<br>Educators and the certificate three<br>qualified Educators as well and really<br>the focus groups had two major purposes<br>one is to kind of interrogate what we<br>said from the time found from the time<br>use diary and did that make sense to<br>them this kind of rapid changes in<br>activity the multitasking and what we<br>were a bit surprised about is these<br>really positive ratings for work<br>satisfaction<br>but the other level is to also dig down<br>into well what does it take to be an<br>exemplary educator now we know what you<br>do all day and we've got a bit of a<br>sense of what that work is what does it<br>take<br>um and so they were the two questions<br>so what we found and<br>all right and then those of you who are<br>Educators this is probably going yep we<br>know this is that the work is really<br>complex it's very diverse and it's also<br>intense but satisfying and that's what<br>makes Educators go back to work every<br>day um because they get personal<br>fulfillment from it so when we asked<br>educator that the folks group<br>participants around rapid change of the<br>primary activity so this kind of<br>constant changing the sense was that<br>well yes that's that's what we do but we<br>have to prioritize we're always thinking<br>what needs to be done next what should I<br>do first and second<br>um we also talked about multitasking<br>that's doing two things at the same time<br>um and Educators told us yeah that's<br>that's reflects what we do we're never<br>still we're always you know we're doing<br>at least one thing usually two things at<br>the same time<br>um but then there was this kind of yes<br>we really enjoy our work<br>um and mostly they told us this because<br>they uh actually they find you from a<br>different study I won't go into those<br>ones there<br>um but that they they really were<br>um so<br>um what were the some of the things that<br>impacted on this they told us that it<br>was about the age of the children<br>um the nature of the work was really a<br>it's literally about doing this constant<br>constant scanning constant changing it's<br>just what you do as an early childhood<br>educator but also there are many<br>interruptions in that work<br>um you might be sat with a group of a<br>small group of children doing a mass<br>activity but they're always also<br>thinking about the other three children<br>over here who are playing in the sand<br>pit so there's lots of things that are<br>going on lots of interruptions<br>um constantly people coming into the<br>service and<br>demanding many things of you families<br>wanting to know um you know about their<br>child where their sock is and to tell<br>you they're going on holiday next week<br>so lots of interruptions to the work<br>but people love their work<br>um they love their work these were in<br>high quality services they love their<br>work environment they love the<br>flexibility of their work and they were<br>really<br>um they wanted to stay in their job<br>because of the philosophy<br>so what are some of the factors then<br>that support that this idea that you can<br>um make early childhood education is<br>quite autonomous you don't have a<br>curriculum that tells you what you have<br>to do every single day<br>educators are able to prioritize and to<br>to decide what their day is going to be<br>like based on the needs of the children<br>and the interests of the children<br>things like teamwork leadership the the<br>communication between Educators teams<br>that have been together for a long time<br>have that's kind of seamless<br>communication where all they need to do<br>is kind of look at the other educator<br>nod their head or just do a little head<br>shake like that and they can really<br>communicate everybody knows they're on<br>the same page they know what they're<br>doing<br>of course there's that kind of passion<br>that we talk about as being an early<br>childhood educator but also an advocacy<br>arm for that that they really<br>um advocation for the rights of children<br>the ability to critically reflect<br>reflect on what they're doing<br>having meant opportunities for mentoring<br>and coaching and for other professional<br>development but particularly<br>professional development that's geared<br>to what they wanted<br>um and there were the conditions that<br>enabled that so things like having above<br>ratio so more Educators and they're<br>actually legally required staff models<br>that enable the spread of qualifications<br>having non-contact programming time was<br>critical these are all the kinds of<br>things that sustain the early the<br>Educators in these high quality services<br>as well as having professional networks<br>and relationships outside of the service<br>so you might think well are these are<br>these some of the factors that are<br>really and true for you that makes you<br>maybe you hunting out a service that<br>that provides you with these kind of<br>facilities and opportunities<br>so that was the focus group and um as I<br>said that was to help us to understand<br>the the time you started but also to<br>start to think about what is it that<br>enables this<br>um the the exemplary practice the third<br>stage of the first third phase of the<br>study was a case study and this was<br>where we really got in we were<br>absolutely privileged as researchers to<br>be able to go into these high quality<br>services and really spend some time with<br>the Educators to find out what is it<br>um so we did 12 case studies and we had<br>two visits the first visit was a three<br>was about a three-day visit or up to<br>three days that did get a little bit<br>changed during covid we had to do some<br>some things via um online but during<br>that first visit we got to know the<br>Educators we<br>um<br>uh implemented a particular survey that<br>Linda's going to talk to you about we<br>conducted interviews with the Educators<br>and essential directors we discussed<br>things we just had chats with them we<br>collected<br>um artifacts and by that I mean you know<br>maybe it was the picture of the roster<br>or how they'd set up their staff room<br>and we asked Educators to collect some<br>examples of things that they were really<br>um they thought uh reflected their ex<br>their practice<br>and just to be clear what we were<br>talking what we're talking about in<br>terms of exemplary practice is not<br>something whiz-bang it is what Educators<br>do every day it's the high quality<br>learning environments that they are<br>providing for children every single day<br>that second visit was a longer visit<br>um and we we kind of chatted back about<br>well this is what I was thinking from<br>the previous day we conducted more<br>interviews and then we did this thing<br>called shadowing where we followed<br>Educators as they went about their day<br>um and<br>um we talked to them around what we saw<br>and asked well can you explain why that<br>is why did you set the sandpit up in<br>that way why why did you um put the ease<br>away in that particular Corner what was<br>it that made you do that so that we<br>could understand the intentionality<br>behind what the Educators were doing we<br>of course just kept taking lots of<br>observations kept collecting more<br>artifacts and documents and one of the<br>really interesting things we did is when<br>we saw exemplary practice we documented<br>it we wrote it down and then with the<br>Educators we co-constructed<br>um what the of the practice looked like<br>and here's an example of what an exam<br>sample of exemplary practice now if you<br>read this it is just what Educators do<br>every day but it's also extraordinary it<br>is exemplary practice it's that kind of<br>constantly shifting from playing and<br>extending conversations and affirming<br>children<br>there would be nothing here that you<br>would go oh well um that's that's we<br>can't possibly do that this is exemplary<br>practice this is what Educators in high<br>quality services are doing every day of<br>the week<br>um Linda's just going to talk to you<br>about the findings from the sequel study<br>now<br>Linda<br>thank you Sandy yeah<br>um so it was interesting that we were<br>able to some of the questions that we<br>had<br>um about the supports for exemplary<br>practice had had already been studied by<br>a group of researchers in America and we<br>collaborated with them to use and adapt<br>this survey that they had used<br>um in it mostly in America so we adapted<br>it we tested it for Australians<br>um Educators and Sandy had a lot to do<br>with with that stage of the work<br>um so SQL is an online survey and we use<br>this in the in the case studies with all<br>the staff in the case studies not just<br>the ones that were identified<br>foreshadowing<br>um<br>and what SQL did really in a way was was<br>pick up a lot of the themes that were<br>raised in the focus groups that they<br>were already there in in the SQL<br>questionnaire so that they could be<br>explored numerically and also through<br>further comments in the case study sites<br>um so Educators completed the survey<br>during that those first visits and we<br>provided backfill so that they could be<br>paid to spend that time uh to do that so<br>the next slide has got uh the scores for<br>these different groupings<br>um of what contributed and some of these<br>things are exactly the same headings as<br>Sandy just showed you on the outline of<br>what came out of the focus groups around<br>leadership<br>um well-being job crafting Etc so the<br>score was a maximum of six and you can<br>see not surprisingly perhaps for this<br>sample of exemplary Services the ratings<br>average really quite high they were<br>either five or or or above or if below<br>only just below<br>um the top of the slide which seems to<br>have been cut off is um because I<br>probably accidentally moved it Sandy is<br>uh the First Column is the average<br>across the whole sample the second two<br>lines are the fact that we were able to<br>do this survey with participants before<br>um Colvin hit Australia then we had a<br>long Gap and when we went back we did it<br>with the other half of the case study<br>sites and interestingly the scores had<br>improved<br>um pre-covered to post covert and that<br>in itself is an interesting finding but<br>what I've showed in the middle column<br>there where there's three numbers in a<br>row<br>is the distinct is the difference<br>between qualification levels and just<br>like the time use diary that we found uh<br>that diploma qualified staff were the<br>ones that were<br>doing what teachers and certificate<br>staff were doing there were they were<br>really doing everything<br>um they are the ones that primarily had<br>the lower scores so it's interesting to<br>think about that and what it is that<br>we're asking of people with diploma<br>qualified<br>um staff and how they are supported<br>because clearly they are giving slightly<br>lower ratings of both their feelings of<br>support<br>um Sandy if you just go on to the next<br>one I think<br>these are just some of the quotes that<br>came up in the survey of what people<br>said about aspects of these different<br>components of teaching supports<br>um and job crafting<br>um and the next one is<br>um two other quotes there about<br>leadership and adult well-being so very<br>important aspects leadership came up<br>very very strongly as being what was<br>influencing so much of the other areas<br>of um of Educators work and how they<br>rated their work<br>so Sandy is now going to bring together<br>all of these case study findings into a<br>final summary<br>um<br>and I'll hand back to you Sandy thanks<br>Linda what I should have said is the<br>case study that we had a focus on<br>um three Educators per service one at<br>each qualification level but as Linda<br>said the sequel went to everybody but we<br>were particularly focusing on in the<br>case study on an educator<br>with a three qualification diploma and<br>teacher qualification in each of the<br>services that had been identified by<br>their Center Director as being you know<br>an exemplary educator and it was<br>interesting because when we started they<br>were a little bit<br>um bashful about about that oh I don't<br>know why I was chosen as exemplary but<br>um we working with them and reflecting<br>back to them what amazing things that we<br>were seeing that they were doing<br>um I think it built up a really<br>beautiful relationship between the the<br>participants in the case study because<br>we did see some extraordinary everyday<br>practices in these high quality services<br>so when we bring it all together<br>um what what's sort of the overall<br>findings from this is from the Fate the<br>the whole case study and so one of our<br>participants said oh it's the pedagogy<br>of everything it's everything it's not<br>just the intentional teaching with the<br>children but the pedagogy of the<br>relationships with families of<br>relationships with one another within<br>the context of the the larger work<br>environment these are services that<br>often went above and beyond um what was<br>required they had really intentional<br>practices but this was consistent<br>um across all educators<br>but the findings that I'm going to share<br>with you in a moment is important to say<br>like we didn't find one magic cookie you<br>it's not like if you all did this it<br>would work because it's not a<br>one-size-fits-all what's possible in one<br>site is not possible in another for<br>example we had services that didn't have<br>outdoor environments they had particular<br>um but they had they had uh managed<br>their indoor environment in a way that<br>really provided the children with high<br>quality learning so it's not it's not<br>we're not saying that everybody has to<br>do the same thing but there are some<br>learnings that we um got from the the<br>case study<br>and the first is of course that there<br>needs to be these extrinsic factors<br>there needs to be things on the outside<br>in the social political context and one<br>of those is of course the availability<br>of Educators this has affected um the<br>ability of all services to operate in<br>highways<br>there's also that need for the<br>organizational support whether that be<br>um the owner of a service or the board<br>of the service they all have to provide<br>the resources for the Educators to do<br>the work that they need to do there has<br>to be good governance<br>um uh Arrangements they have to be<br>working conditions that are supporting<br>Educators flexible Arrangements of for<br>their work and so on so things like when<br>the center director knows that the the<br>um the Educators child is going to be in<br>the school play they give they do some<br>flexible work around so that the<br>educator can go and see their child in<br>the school play so that kind of<br>flexibility<br>um having a shared vision and purpose<br>and really it was a particular kind of<br>philosophies like having an ethic of<br>care being socially just<br>um those kind or or having a particular<br>pedagogical approach that kind of tied<br>things together and in order for that to<br>happen there was purposeful Recruitment<br>and policies so people were really<br>trying to Target particular people to<br>come and work in their organization or<br>people with um particular views on the<br>child for example<br>it needs leadership absolutely critical<br>but there are leaders who are<br>compassionate who are fair who are<br>flexible but at the same time have high<br>expectations of Educators so they're all<br>those good things but they also expect<br>really high they have high expectations<br>of the educators<br>as well as leadership the teams that<br>work together so that there is trust and<br>respect there's a cohesion there's clear<br>communication they're the kinds of<br>things amongst a team that support this<br>high quality work<br>the kind of what Linda was talking about<br>in that kind of everybody's got a clear<br>role but there's a bit of flexibility<br>amongst what everybody does and then of<br>course there are individual factors<br>around the Educators so their skills<br>their knowledge their dispositions<br>um how articulate they were in<br>communicating<br>um what they were doing and why they<br>were doing it and being present with<br>with the children that was another<br>important point and of course having<br>physical spaces that enable this to<br>happen having a staff room where<br>Educators can actually rest and<br>recuperate after a morning's work having<br>resources and so on that are available<br>to support them in that work so these<br>are the kinds of things that enable<br>exemplary practice to happen it's not<br>all about the Educators it's not all<br>about the organizations it's at every<br>single level<br>okay so we know that so what do we need<br>is going back to that first question if<br>we want to sustain Educators in the work<br>going forward what do we need to do well<br>we actually need to prepare Educators<br>better<br>um and that's our job as tertiary<br>Educators we do need to help them to<br>understand the work so that they have<br>much more realistic expectations<br>um I think we also need to focus on<br>self-care<br>um and uh in our education preparation<br>courses and help people to understand<br>how to look after themselves because<br>there is an individual educator<br>responsibility<br>um care for grounding care not just for<br>the children not just for your for your<br>colleagues not just for the families but<br>also for yourself because unless you<br>look after yourself you can't do this<br>work<br>Educators employers have to provide<br>those safe workplaces that um and that<br>means also making sure that they're<br>supporting collegiality<br>um and and cohesiveness of a team<br>creating this clear articulated Vision<br>so that everybody can share in it<br>together<br>um they have the same philosophy because<br>they would and everybody working<br>um so a collection a clearly articulated<br>statement of the collective perspective<br>of an ethic of care<br>for educators included and one that's<br>grounded in socially inclusive practice<br>having those organizational contexts and<br>supports<br>um and the organizational context which<br>really prioritizes Educators and<br>provides them with those resources<br>collegial and mutually respectful<br>relationships and safe and supportive<br>organizational climates That's essential<br>so there are a whole lot of things that<br>um need to be done at the individual<br>level at the organizational level but<br>also we need to advocate for social<br>change at the sort of macro level at the<br>social context level and that means<br>um changing policies and creating<br>policies uh creating entry engine<br>policies that enable this work to happen<br>and we've got some work underway within<br>Australia that around Workforce<br>strategies and so on that are trying to<br>do that<br>so it's it's advocacy that leads to the<br>policies that guide the work and<br>conditions both at that sort of local<br>level at the national level and the<br>international level as well<br>the findings from our study the overall<br>findings are going to be shared in a<br>report hopefully by the end of this year<br>if not early next year it's called The<br>Shining a light on Early Childhood<br>Educators work project report and um<br>that will be available on our website<br>shortly<br>um I think that kind of brings us close<br>to the end of our presentation I'm just<br>cognizant that we have kind of<br>kind of not really left enough time for<br>questions and comments but um Linda and<br>I are available that's our email address<br>their<br>um addresses so you're very happy to<br>get in contact with us I think there<br>might be a<br>Oliveira are there some questions in the<br>chat that we need to address<br>they just thought uh so much elinda and<br>Sandy it was really amazing to hear<br>about this research and actually very<br>complex I would say research and I'm<br>pretty sure that many people would like<br>to to actually unpack so many aspects of<br>your research that's why we actually got<br>one uh question and I actually kind of<br>think given the time we can maybe<br>address this question and maybe open up<br>space for anybody who would like to uh<br>kind of directly ask the question so the<br>question in the chat book box was from<br>Sandra Collins thank you so much Sandra<br>and the the question was would you<br>Sandra like to read the question or you<br>would like me to read it yeah and<br>um oh sorry to sound or did you want to<br>raise it yourself no no I'm happy for<br>you just to respond thank you okay so<br>the question first verse two parts of<br>the question and was the amount of time<br>spent an intentional teaching or<br>surprise and that's obviously the report<br>from the crime you story which is the<br>average across a whole day and and<br>across all of the data that we got it<br>definitely was a surprise every time we<br>presented it and thank you for raising<br>it because it it certainly comes up a<br>lot people would have liked it to be<br>more<br>um but it is what it is<br>um and I think also you know it's<br>something that the definitions of<br>intentional teaching will have changed<br>from when we first developed our<br>categories quite some time ago<br>um<br>but in terms of the second half of your<br>question did we see intentional teaching<br>or a sustained shared thinking episodes<br>between Educators and children and how<br>important was that aspect I'll I mean I<br>certainly can say from the case study<br>observations that I did that it was<br>happening all the time and we asked<br>questions afterwards in terms of of<br>people's views about intentional<br>teaching and being with children because<br>the other one was well if you're being<br>with children isn't that being<br>intentional with the children so Sandy<br>I'll hand over to you just to fill in a<br>bit more about that<br>so the reason we had those two<br>categories two domains is because we did<br>a pilot study way back and there was a<br>clear different difference between when<br>an educator might be um in a in a<br>outdoor environment for example and say<br>it and they were using the words I was<br>scanning the environment or I was I was<br>sitting listening to the children and<br>then there was a very different kind of<br>well I intentionally set up this<br>learning environment so when we when we<br>designed the the time use diary they<br>they were distinct categories and that's<br>what the Educators wanted in the pilot<br>study they wanted to be able to<br>differentiate those two things as Linda<br>said I think as time has gone on<br>understanding around what intentionality<br>means rather than intentional teaching<br>is has changed<br>um but I think it's also important not<br>to downplay the being with children<br>because being with children is really<br>important<br>and what we have in those in that domain<br>is sitting is listening to Children<br>engaging with children so this is not<br>it's not something that is you know<br>you're just sort of sitting there and<br>and not doing anything it's actually<br>active being active with the children so<br>it always raises issues this kind of<br>differentiation but<br>I'm just thinking would anybody like to<br>maybe ask<br>one last question I'm aware of the time<br>it's always like time up but maybe one<br>more if anybody would like to share or<br>I might finish if nobody's got a<br>question I might actually sort of say<br>one of the things about this study is<br>there's a lot of things here that<br>everybody kind of goes oh yeah I know<br>that I know that but what we didn't have<br>at the beginning of this study is the<br>evidence we didn't have the evidence<br>around what Educators did all day we<br>didn't have the edu the evidence of what<br>it is to support this kind of work and<br>that's what this study contributes it's<br>the evidence behind what we probably<br>already knew everybody kind of knows<br>leadership's important everybody kind of<br>knows the collegiality is important but<br>now we've got some evidence around that<br>but these things are absolutely critical<br>if we want to provide<br>um high quality Early Learning but that<br>also that educators are sustained in<br>that work<br>um and and so we've just contributed<br>you know I would be surprised if anybody<br>looked at our results and went oh that<br>doesn't make sense to me that's not my<br>experience<br>um but it and yeah so<br>on that note maybe Sandy there is a<br>question by Kiri and thank you so much<br>Kitty for asking that because it's kind<br>of policy you actually mentioned it's<br>kind of not just individual changes also<br>organizational changing kind of<br>governmental kind of on the macro level<br>change so what specific policy changes<br>would you advocate for that my support<br>exemplary Early Childhood organizations<br>and teachers maybe that is the kind of<br>question to bring a bit more kind of<br>policy context in in place<br>I think we've probably all got our own<br>little our own favorites but for me that<br>it's<br>I believe that early childhood Educators<br>know what to do and know how to do it<br>but they don't necessarily have the<br>resources to enable them to do that work<br>and by resources I mean the working<br>conditions<br>um and the the context that enables that<br>work to happen and<br>um so<br>anything that what I would recommend is<br>things that enable the conditions so of<br>course pay and conditions are really<br>critical to that<br>um but it's also things<br>um like it<br>critical reflection is a corner is a key<br>part of high quality practice and if I<br>have never done a study where Educators<br>haven't told me that they they need more<br>time more time and we cannot give you<br>more time because there is only a<br>certain number of hours in the day but<br>what we can do is change the working<br>conditions to enable that to happen so<br>at the moment in in Australia we have<br>Educators get two hours a week to do<br>their programming I think we need much<br>more than that to enable high quality<br>programs so things like conditions<br>things like ratios<br>um I I and this this in the services<br>that we visited they tended to be above<br>ratio<br>so I think that's what creates the<br>condition so paying conditions are<br>paying conditions are absolutely<br>critical<br>um of course professional development<br>and all of those things are absolutely<br>critical<br>um but it's for me it's about creating<br>the conditions and and the things if I<br>had a magic wand the things I would<br>change would be ratios and programming<br>time<br>Linda might have a different View<br>well I I agree completely with what<br>you're saying Sandy<br>but also you know a lot of the things<br>that we've found about what contributes<br>to high quality practices and in<br>learning environments it's just not<br>necessarily be legislated<br>um but if you think about because you<br>know they depend on the the providers<br>and the kind of organization that<br>provides it<br>um not all of our case studies were not<br>for profits but most of them were and um<br>you know clearly in our sector when<br>we've got these National Quality ratings<br>we can see that the not-for-profits are<br>typically rated lower as a group as a<br>whole their their ratings tend to be<br>lower than the not-for-profits are<br>it's not as easy to say for-profits bad<br>not-for-profits good yeah and I know<br>Linda doesn't mean that um<br>there are some absolutely excellent high<br>quality for-profit services and some<br>really not so good not-for-profit<br>Services yeah<br>um so but you know when you are making<br>when you're when you're imperative is to<br>make money for shareholders I think<br>there is a problem there considering<br>that you know most of that money comes<br>from taxpayers anyway<br>um yeah<br>and I'm actually seeing people modding<br>uh it quite resonates with a lot of<br>other contexts including New Zealand I'm<br>aware of the time and we are slightly uh<br>taking longer than than actually but you<br>are getting a lot of messages people<br>thanking you really and thank you<br>subscribe it
