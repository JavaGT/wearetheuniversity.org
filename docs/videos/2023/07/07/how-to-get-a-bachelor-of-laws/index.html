the processes from application to timetables to the structure.</p><h2>Transcript</h2><p style="opacity: 0.9; font-size: 0.8em">Transcripts may be automatically generated and may not be 100% accurate.</p><p>Kia Ora I'm Jemima one of the program<br>advisors at the faculty of Law and in<br>this session we'll cover how the lrb<br>works<br>The Bachelor of laws is a four-year<br>program if stated full-time and can also<br>be studied part-time<br>we have two admissions into the Albee<br>program LLB part one for first year and<br>lrb part 2 for second year onwards<br>the lrb is taught at the city campus and<br>unlike other degrees has no major<br>attached to it this means that everyone<br>who earns a lb degree gains a broad<br>background in the law<br>this is the same across all New Zealand<br>law schools<br>one difference is that the University of<br>Auckland has the widest range of law<br>electives to choose from which include<br>corporate and Commercial public criminal<br>Family International and environmental<br>law so there are a variety of law<br>electives to choose from depending on<br>your interests and career goals which<br>students typically begin taking in their<br>part three and four of the degree<br>for those who want to practice law in<br>New Zealand you must complete a New<br>Zealand law degree or equivalent and<br>then take the professional legal studies<br>course before being admitted as a<br>barrister and solicitor to get into the<br>batch of laws part 1 students must apply<br>for The Bachelor of laws specializing in<br>part one and a landlord bachelor's<br>degree<br>this can either be the landlord degree<br>on its own or as a conjoint with law<br>a law conjoint has a higher entry<br>requirement so we recommend that<br>students interested in the conjoint to<br>also apply for the two degrees<br>separately as a backup option<br>in total you should have either two<br>applications or three if you're<br>interested in the conjoint<br>applicants who accepted unconditionally<br>into another bachelor's degree will also<br>be accepted into allerby part 1.<br>it is important that you consult student<br>hubs about the nun law bachelor's degree<br>you are applying for if you have any<br>questions about gaining entry<br>we normally get a lot of questions about<br>what the entry requirements are or what<br>rank score I need to get into law on the<br>screen you'll see the ncea rank scores<br>for all the single degrees available at<br>the University of Auckland as you can<br>see at the bottom of the table entry<br>into the batch of laws part 1 is<br>dependent on you gaining admission into<br>another degree program here at the<br>University of Auckland<br>so for example if you're planning to<br>study the Bachelor of Arts with the lrb<br>you'll need a minimum rank score of 150.<br>for more information for students<br>wishing to apply for conjoints studying<br>IB or Cambridge please see our website<br>for more information<br>the lrb does not have any required<br>subjects to be admitted into part one<br>but we recommend subjects that focus on<br>linguistic and essay writing skills<br>which are useful for stating law<br>subjects that promote your oral and<br>critical thinking skills are also useful<br>remember that you need to be admitted<br>into another bachelor's degree to be<br>accepted into Albee part 1. so you<br>should check whether the nun law degree<br>you are applying for has any required<br>subjects you must take<br>there are a variety of conjoint options<br>to study at the University of Auckland<br>with law<br>and this allows students to study two<br>bachelor's degrees at the same time in a<br>shorter time frame with a heavier<br>workload versus a double degree and this<br>is why there is a higher entry<br>requirement<br>so for example if you studied The<br>Bachelor of Arts and The Bachelor of<br>laws as two separate degrees this would<br>take seven years<br>whereas with a Bachelor of Arts and<br>Bachelor of laws conjoint this would<br>take five years<br>a conjoint program gives you the<br>opportunity to acquire wider knowledge<br>base and also broaden your career<br>opportunities<br>here's how to apply on the University of<br>Auckland website<br>auckland.ac.nz you'll see at the top of<br>the page and apply for admission to<br>study button<br>from there you can start your<br>application for admission<br>you will need to fill out some details<br>before you choose your program<br>once you get to the section where you<br>select your program type in the search<br>bar law this will bring up all the<br>different law program options you can<br>apply for<br>once you have selected your program it<br>should look something like this<br>on the screen are two different<br>applications<br>on the left you'll see an application<br>for the lrb specializing in law part 1.<br>on the right you'll see an application<br>for the nun law bachelor's degree you<br>also need to apply for<br>follow the prompts for the rest of the<br>application and the final step will be<br>to submit it<br>once your applications have been<br>submitted to your receive an email with<br>further instructions<br>this makes part of the presentation will<br>explain more details about the lrb<br>structure<br>a question you may be asking is why do I<br>have to apply for two programs if I only<br>want to study law<br>in your first year of the LLB students<br>are required to enroll in at least five<br>other non-law courses under the other<br>program along with three part one law<br>courses<br>this is because studying two disciplines<br>broadens the knowledge of all law<br>students and also gives you the<br>opportunity to lay down the foundation<br>for your other degree program if you<br>wanted to pursue it<br>the lrb combines non-law courses from<br>another degree one general education<br>course<br>compulsory law courses shown in dark<br>blue and law electives and this is all<br>in line with the New Zealand Council of<br>legal education requirements<br>if you are planning to study the law<br>degree on its own we do recommend to<br>complete the general education course in<br>your first year of study<br>na lrb conjoint degree structure you'll<br>see that students study the allerby<br>alongside the other degree<br>simultaneously<br>apart from The Bachelor of engineering<br>honors and advanced science honors<br>conjoints the law conjoint programs can<br>be completed within five years at a<br>heavier workload or five and a half<br>years at a normal workload<br>if you're considering more than one<br>major for your other degree please note<br>this may add courses and potentially<br>another semester of study<br>always consult student hubs about both<br>program requirements if you have any<br>questions<br>you'll also notice that the single lb<br>degree structure is similar to the<br>conjunct degree structure in the first<br>year<br>if at first you had no intentions of<br>pursuing a conjoint or you didn't meet<br>the conjoint requirements you can still<br>apply for it later<br>admission can be in the first year of<br>study or at any point of your degree so<br>long as you have not passed more than<br>270 points from either degree component<br>which is about two years of full-time<br>study and then admission into the<br>conjoint will be based on your GPA<br>as mentioned the lrb has two different<br>admissions<br>to get into LLB part 2 you need to pass<br>the law courses with certain grades such<br>as law 121g with a minimum B minus grade<br>or C plus for U tears to then move on to<br>law 131 and one for one<br>you'll also need to make sure you pass<br>your five landlord courses to be<br>eligible for part two so it's important<br>you do well in all your courses<br>don't worry we will have information<br>sessions in your first year covering<br>this<br>earlier I mentioned something called<br>Utes this stands for undergraduate<br>targeted admission schemes and is<br>available for eligible Maori Moana<br>Oceania and students from some Equity<br>groups<br>apart from the progression from law one<br>to one g to law 1319141<br>students eligible under these schemes<br>are also able to apply for admission<br>into lrb part 2 with these categories<br>for entry into lrb part 2 we have a<br>special GPA calculation and this is<br>called the law GPA<br>the main thing to note here is that the<br>grades for law 131 and one for one are<br>worth double<br>the overall average grade required for<br>selection to alloby Part 2 varies each<br>year depending on the number of<br>applicants we receive so it's important<br>you do well in all your courses<br>the entry requirements for alloby part 2<br>are subject to change each year<br>once you are admitted into lb part 2<br>there are no further GPA requirements to<br>remain in the program<br>on the slide is an example of how the<br>law GPA is calculated<br>the main thing to note is that 50 of the<br>GPA is from your law grades<br>again don't worry about the details too<br>much we do cover this in information<br>sessions in your first year of study<br>in the law school we have student<br>support advisors to provide pastoral<br>care during your journey with us and<br>their information can be found online<br>along with tutorials workshops and<br>Clinics you'll attend as part of your<br>studies there are also multiple<br>mentoring programs within the faculty<br>you may be a part of which is a great<br>way to meet others and have their<br>additional support<br>the law school also has a variety of law<br>student clubs and associations all with<br>their own academic and social events<br>some clubs even have their own space in<br>the law school which students are<br>welcome to use alongside study spaces<br>and the Davis law library which is a<br>great resource<br>I hope that you have learned more about<br>the Bachelor of laws and are confident<br>in making your application<br>should you have any further queries<br>visit student hubs
