observational<br>phenomena<br>Giovanni's case the more you subscribed<br>environmental phenomena interface<br>between the sea and blend these models<br>tell us how the boundary shapes how they<br>shapes not only the physical phenomenal<br>we see such as wave actions and sand<br>Woods a biological phenomenal assets is<br>very secret just provide interest<br>components<br>many of these models are highly useful<br>for example predicting a bunch of our<br>houses every underwater<br>scenarios our River and Easter Island<br>Banks collapse and what the current<br>flows are over time in Mysteries<br>however many also describe Pacific<br>such as how waves and sand interact on<br>the beaches create beautiful certain<br>these eight interactions have<br>similarities to help you with phenomena<br>such as food product Jazz there's some<br>things you have only works for this in<br>life<br>Geo blindly gained an engineering degree<br>after three years of scripts and they<br>can use it oh well I'm headed back to<br>Europe before the University of Kentucky<br>and Australia in 2015 removing them in<br>the player just came back to New Zealand<br>to take up a position here into this<br>time<br>it's perhaps appropriate for the first<br>time I met Giovanni after he arrived in<br>Auckland what's on tap with the Bridge<br>tonight Giovanni is going to tell us<br>about the rhythms of the shoreline<br>Laura good evening and Buona Sera<br>everyone<br>I had prepared some profound statements<br>that probably would have changed your<br>life but seeing you all here<br>well is he like saying thank you for<br>being here some of my mentors are here<br>and my New Zealand family is here so<br>this is absolutely fantastic and thanks<br>also to all my students and friends that<br>are<br>that are here it's it's great<br>okay we will get started and we start<br>straight away with a little experiment<br>that I made together with my friend Omar<br>we build<br>what is called<br>the chadni plate<br>and I will enjoy destroying your ear for<br>a few seconds<br>so this is a plate metal plate and then<br>Omar with his cello bowl is striking<br>some notes as he strike notes<br>the pattern changes<br>the what you see there in red yellow is<br>sand of different grain sizes foreign<br>was very simple during this experiment I<br>was pouring the sand on the on the plate<br>I can stop this I don't think I need to<br>destroy your ears any longer<br>but this experiment is very simple and<br>it shows straight away how waves<br>interact with sand to produce patterns<br>now<br>clearly this is not Jazz and with the<br>sound that Omar was making are not jazz<br>but we have patterns everywhere we have<br>patterns in the desert we have patterns<br>in clouds we have patterns on beaches<br>when the beach is exposed we have<br>patterns underwater<br>we have patterns in their stories with<br>vegetation we have patterns in waves<br>and we have patterns also on the<br>shoreline<br>what is going on what are those patterns<br>now there are patterns also in jazz<br>if you like jazz and if you like John<br>Coltrane it will not take long to<br>recognize this picture is the pattern<br>it's the circle of the fifth<br>famous pattern in Jasmine just there are<br>entire books written on patterns<br>but let's while you watch this picture<br>and these incredible pictures and please<br>notice that just for scale this is a<br>house here and here you see houses so<br>these patterns are sometimes really<br>really big<br>I want to just stop for a second and<br>think about what is a pattern<br>pattern yes it's something that has a<br>certain degree of regularity but really<br>our life is shaped by patterns<br>our life itself is a pattern from<br>morning to evening more or less we know<br>what will happen and we know what<br>happens during the week it's about<br>there's not a different scale we know<br>that on Saturday morning we will go and<br>play netball on Sunday afternoon we go<br>and play football well I don't go I take<br>there are patterns everywhere we look at<br>patterns in sea level change we look at<br>patterns in climate change we look at<br>patterns in population growth<br>I really wonder what life would be<br>without patterns I'm not sure we would<br>even be able to cross the road without<br>immediately recognizing what the pattern<br>of black and white stripes indicates<br>so there are patterns<br>and what is really surprising this is<br>that these patterns are a measure of<br>regularity<br>so we have to try to understand what<br>they mean because regularity in our<br>world is quite unique and if we do not<br>understand regularity it's difficult to<br>imagine how we can understand everything<br>else here are more patterns<br>and might take on patterns especially<br>when I see them on beaches is<br>I want to understand them if I'm not<br>capable of understanding why patterns is<br>so beautiful and so simple appear how am<br>I going to understand how a<br>evolves in 100 Year under storm waves<br>and sea level rise so let's start trying<br>to understand those patterns and really<br>there are so many patterns that are so<br>beautiful<br>one pattern I became I wouldn't say<br>obsessed with but the pattern that<br>certainly has played a lot a bigger a<br>big role in my career is definitely a<br>pattern called casps you can see<br>those Beach casps here I don't know if<br>you've seen them they do appear quite<br>regularly on a lot of coromandel beaches<br>the those casps you see those sequences<br>of what are called beachcast porns and<br>baymens and you can see that the water<br>is piling up in the embayments and<br>flushing out as a little jet<br>and the pattern next stands for the<br>whole Beach<br>let's look at it a little bit better and<br>just to give you an idea about scale<br>this is a person<br>and here is the beach Casp and another<br>and another incredibly regular<br>how the hell is it possible in a place<br>where we have waves coming in Breaking<br>currents sediment getting moved around<br>how is it possible that in this complete<br>messy environment we get regularity and<br>it's not like this beach in Sydney is a<br>unique thing here you can see another<br>one that is completely different again<br>for scale this is a person<br>and these are huge cusps much much<br>bigger with much coarser sediment and<br>again you can see that the flow of the<br>waves is concentrated in the embayments<br>and here are some more pretty<br>spectacular examples including I suspect<br>many of you have already recognized that<br>this is Hae<br>a hey beach with casps how do they form<br>people have tried to understand it has<br>become a little bit of a mystery I've<br>been trying to understand how do beach<br>cusps form why are they there why they<br>appear so often to<br>why is this pattern there and that's a<br>question that I<br>faced for quite a bit of time and I put<br>a lot of effort as you will see<br>so what I will do today is I will tell<br>you a little story about Beach cusps<br>because I think it relates to a lot of<br>things that I've done in my career it<br>explains my interest for patterns and<br>I will then give you another example<br>that actually looks more into the future<br>the things that I'm doing that are<br>really trying to address different<br>problems and really it's an Outlook at<br>what I will what I'm planning on doing<br>but let's start with casps we<br>start with casps because they're<br>amazing they're really beautiful and<br>because for a hundred years we haven't<br>been able to figure out why they<br>appeared<br>from the beginning of the past centuries<br>scientists have tried to put out<br>hypotheses explaining us why Beach caps<br>were there those those approaches those<br>hypotheses were completely nonsense but<br>it actually indicates the struggle of<br>scientists how is it possible we don't<br>understand something so regular<br>well at some point in the 70s and the<br>80s a group of scientists from the U.S<br>and Canada came out with an idea and<br>that idea is what I will call now the<br>established Theory because people liked<br>it they liked it a lot and it ended up<br>it made sense and it ended up in all<br>books and it's still in a lot of books<br>so what those scientists were saying<br>it's all about a certain specific type<br>of waves called Edge waves<br>now you've never seen those waves on a<br>beach because they're very difficult to<br>detect in fact we've been able to detect<br>them only once<br>in the late 70s and he's not even sure<br>that they were really there<br>but the idea was fascinating<br>you have those strange wave waves you<br>use if this is the beach you're used to<br>waves coming towards the beach those<br>waves they run along the beach it's a<br>completely different thing we don't see<br>them where are they<br>still if you solve the theory if of<br>waves if you look at the equations if<br>you solve them really carefully you can<br>see that those waves actually can exist<br>in theory under a lot of complicated<br>hypotheses so the idea is simple here<br>Edge waves<br>we assume that exists that they exist<br>and if they exist they will just imprint<br>themselves on the beach a little bit<br>what I'm like whatever and I did Omar<br>was striking with the bow the plate it<br>was generating some vibration some waves<br>and according to the pattern of this<br>waves the sand was settling at specific<br>spots and change you change the note the<br>sand goes somewhere else<br>so the idea is fascinating it's<br>supported by Theory we have to solve<br>complicated equations scientists love<br>that and as a result this theory was<br>accepted by everyone<br>it became a known problem<br>it actually became proof that scientists<br>we are smart we solve problems<br>now<br>all good or nice but really<br>a lot of people were actually thinking<br>but how is it possible that we see casps<br>all the time but those famous Edge waves<br>we actually don't see them<br>and when we try to measure them and<br>we've been trying to<br>nothing you don't see them<br>so what I did<br>and it might appear miraculous for you<br>that funding agencies give so much money<br>for this type of studies but<br>I went to the lab and I didn't go to<br>just small lab I went to the biggest lab<br>in the world<br>and started<br>building a beach because I wanted to<br>test these hypothesis is it really true<br>that this is what is happening<br>and here you're seeing we are building<br>the beach in a while you will see me<br>with a white shirt painting for those<br>and little by little<br>we develop yeah there I was<br>together<br>that was my contribution to the setup<br>but it's an important one and as you can<br>see now we're building a structure where<br>we are putting all the instruments<br>um it's a really big lab it's over 30<br>meters long in this direction and a lot<br>of cables and then the the technician<br>the head technician got crazy because we<br>were making too much messes we wanted<br>all of us out and finally the water<br>so now it's ready for the experiment<br>actually we put some random in inside<br>because we wanted the water to be<br>colored so we could see it better as it<br>went up and down the beach okay so this<br>is what you will see now but now I will<br>change rotation we will look at it from<br>above<br>okay here we go so we are running the<br>experiments with our pink water and you<br>can see the waves going up and down the<br>title sounds a little bit funny<br>monochromatic waves it only indicates<br>that waves are all the same one after<br>the other the waves are all exactly the<br>same same height same period and at the<br>moment you don't really see much you<br>definitely don't see that pattern now I<br>need your help because here if you focus<br>if you look carefully<br>can you begin to see some strange waves<br>beginning to develop some little pattern<br>there at the shoreline<br>because if you begin to see it now after<br>200 seconds look at it after 900 seconds<br>at this point<br>we were all going crazy<br>it's good we spent a lot of money during<br>this facility to build this beach yes at<br>least it worked<br>and so here are the famous Edge waves<br>now I'm tempted to ask do you go to the<br>beach and see those I haven't seen them<br>well<br>but we got we loved it and so we started<br>changing the waves to get them crazy at<br>some point my dream was to get the water<br>out of the lab<br>the technician was not so fond of this<br>it didn't quite like my idea but we kept<br>on we kept on preparing we kept on<br>shooting waves and develop and looking<br>at the pattern better and better really<br>good<br>and I have to say that this was a great<br>experiment when people heard in the<br>community that I was running this<br>experiment they came they flew in from<br>everywhere from England from the U.S the<br>most famous scientist in the field they<br>all came they wanted to have a look at<br>what was going on and they were ecstatic<br>when they saw this<br>hugs it was it was a great moment<br>but then I said okay but those waves<br>they look nothing like reality<br>waves are not the same in reality you<br>never see two waves that are the same<br>so what we did is okay let's run some<br>real looking waves<br>and all of a sudden you don't see the<br>pattern<br>also maybe some of you have noticed<br>but<br>on this beach there is no sand<br>and there's a reason why there is no<br>sand because sand causes dissipation and<br>with dissipation you actually don't end<br>up seeing those Edge waves<br>at all<br>so so walked so what says Miles Davis<br>it's the title of one of his most famous<br>students<br>so what this is beginning to get really<br>interesting for scientists because we<br>have a problem we think we have solved<br>it<br>but not quite yet what is going on and<br>so well what can we do we can go and<br>look at the field let's look at the<br>field there are there's 100 year of<br>people going out in the field and<br>collecting measurements and as you can<br>see from this figure what we try to<br>predict when we look at casps when we go<br>in the field we measure how far the<br>horns are of the beach casps what is the<br>spacing of the cusps and that's what we<br>try to predict with the theory and it<br>looks more or less okay more or less in<br>the sense that sometimes the theory<br>predicts that the cusps are 90 meters<br>but in reality they're 40.<br>so there's room for doubt<br>also the biggest evidence of the<br>existence of edge waves is actually this<br>picture taken in Canada close to Halifax<br>and here you can see the famous Edge<br>waves what they should look like<br>at least here when the waves break<br>but notice<br>this is as planner as it can be and it<br>stayed planner for the whole day<br>and we had instruments out there and we<br>couldn't measure anything that was<br>similar to Edge waves so<br>there's room for doubt and for a<br>scientist that's fantastic<br>but that's actually not what happened<br>people consider this figure on the left<br>that I published and I thought oh wow<br>that's saying that we should doubt<br>instead people thought oh that's<br>evidence that that's how it works<br>so all books now reports started<br>reporting about Beach cusps and<br>research on beach gasps almost stopped<br>because it was a problem solved it was<br>actually an example of how good we are<br>yes but at some point a group of<br>scientists started thinking<br>there is something that doesn't quite<br>make sense here<br>and so we came up with a with a<br>different with an alternative hypothesis<br>this hypothesis to those birds flying in<br>this shape in a minute you will see why<br>because<br>this approach is completely different<br>and<br>almost unexpected in our field that is<br>so dominated by Theory and by equations<br>now all of a sudden some scientists said<br>well maybe Beach caps this pattern or in<br>all patterns they do not appear because<br>of something else that has already a<br>pattern but they appear because of<br>interaction<br>because this is a complex system and in<br>this complex system the sum is more than<br>the components just like a really good<br>jazz group jazz band when they all click<br>together when they all play together and<br>it happens and you see they begin to<br>look at each other The Pianist begins to<br>move his head holding one time the other<br>ones they're holding a diff slightly<br>different it happens<br>and why is it it's because of feedbacks<br>feedbacks are really a key feature in<br>our life<br>feedbacks shape relationship shape what<br>we do every day just imagine a lot of<br>the arguments that happen for example on<br>a football field someone just hits<br>someone else that one rather than saying<br>okay it's nothing stands up and gives a<br>little bit of a push<br>and then the other one says oh you<br>pushed me you<br>and pushes more and then the other one<br>hits it<br>and then it keeps just growing and<br>growing and growing but this is also<br>about relationships it's about<br>everything it's about the way Miles<br>Davis<br>said I'm not so sure he said it but<br>that when music when Jazz really happens<br>it's because there are feedbacks there<br>are interactions and those interactions<br>they generate something that is more<br>than the parts<br>so how does it work for casps<br>well if we apply this idea of feedbacks<br>to casps you add the waves the<br>waves move the sediment the sediment<br>changes the morphology the morphology<br>affects the waves and I could go on for<br>a couple of hours but I will spare you<br>because then the waves affect the<br>sediment the sediment affects the<br>morphology the morphology affects the<br>waves okay<br>so-called broken record<br>so<br>okay but this is a little bit esoteric<br>no I mean with just those interactions<br>and then all of a sudden you get the<br>beach cast pattern it actually work<br>being Italian I decided that I would<br>explain you this with my hands<br>so imagine you have a beach imagine you<br>have just a plan or a beach<br>and on this beach there is a little bump<br>who knows why that bump is there doesn't<br>matter there is a bump let's accept that<br>it's not perfectly planner there is a<br>bump waves come up<br>they slow down as they run up the beach<br>they're carrying sediment<br>they find this bump what happens when<br>they find this bump<br>they slow down because there is this<br>slope so they slow down<br>as they slow down what happens the<br>sediment drops the bump gets bumpier<br>and do waves then they just go around<br>this bump they go back<br>towards offshore and as they go back<br>offshore they accelerate as they<br>accelerate they<br>a road sediment<br>the following wave comes and finds a<br>bump that is a little bit bumpier so it<br>will slow down a little bit more drop<br>more sediment the bump that was bumpier<br>becomes even more bumpy<br>and diverts more the water that as it<br>goes as it flows down accelerates even<br>more erodes the sediment you can see how<br>we are beginning to build cusps all<br>around<br>and that's why<br>it doesn't need any special wave it just<br>needs feedbacks<br>and that's exactly what happens with the<br>bluegies that you see here in v-shaped I<br>spoke with each of them and they assured<br>me that there was no agreement on<br>getting into a v-shape<br>there was no agreement on who goes first<br>it just happens it happens because by<br>flying in every shape they consume less<br>energy and so little by little they<br>interact and they shape like that so<br>that's our idea okay this is really now<br>we understand it but it's a bit<br>difficult to convince scientists just<br>with my hands<br>so I had to do something more I figured<br>and<br>hey it's a science talk I need a slide<br>and<br>solving these equations for the problem<br>of Cuts is too much of a nightmare<br>numerically computationally is too<br>difficult nobody can do it<br>so I asked that to Jazz<br>and and I decided to completely change<br>direction go in a different direction<br>let's not be complicated let's be very<br>simple let's build a numerical model<br>that<br>with some very simple rules almost is<br>capable of simulating what is going on<br>and the feedbacks that I'm talking about<br>so I built in the model this sort of<br>type of Beach<br>and<br>now this beach will rotate it and look<br>at it from above<br>that's what happens and this is the<br>launcher Direction offshore is down and<br>these areas where you will see the cusps<br>forming now those black lines that you<br>see are contour lines so lines of the<br>same elevation<br>appear it's higher than how down here<br>what we are trying to simulate is really<br>the development of those casps<br>but I have to turn the figure because<br>you will see them appearing like this<br>so let's have a look let's have a look<br>at this little movie<br>so little by little as time goes I'm not<br>showing the waves I'm just showing the<br>morphology as it evolves and where you<br>see this dark is because the it's Steep<br>and the contour lines are getting all<br>together and little by little you can<br>see that we developed these caspate<br>shape<br>let's look at it again<br>because there are some interesting<br>things that happen here you see two<br>small cusps they are too close into the<br>merge into one here is that there is one<br>that is too close to the other two and<br>so it ends up disappearing<br>and this one slightly moves so that the<br>spacing in the end is regular<br>and you can see that with this model<br>that was actually pretty simple we just<br>had a very crude representation of<br>uh waves<br>and sediment transport we managed to<br>reproduce Beach gasps<br>now I'll tell you straight away I didn't<br>convince anyone with this model everyone<br>hated this model because they said this<br>is too simple this is too simple we have<br>such beautiful equation to solve this<br>problem why don't you use such equations<br>well actually they knew that they<br>wouldn't use them because it's too<br>complicated the problem<br>but the model was there it was working<br>and when we tried to predict the spacing<br>of the cusps and compare it to the<br>measurements it was working well<br>okay so this is becoming the paradise<br>for a scientist now we have two theories<br>that are very different<br>but that<br>balls in some way are capable of<br>reproducing the phenomena that we're<br>observing<br>and there was a huge interest in funding<br>agencies at this point towards this<br>studies because it was really a shift<br>that we were causing books were written<br>that bad forms of All Sorts would happen<br>and would form as a result of something<br>else in the geology because of edge<br>waves and he said we said no we have to<br>look at those features at those patterns<br>in a different way they are the result<br>still nobody believed in anything but we<br>got a huge amount of money<br>to go on the beach with a bulldozer<br>set up as many instruments as we could<br>and measure everything while Beach cusps<br>were reforming you can imagine the<br>tension after smoothing the beach with<br>the bulldozer and waiting with the farm<br>will they not form<br>so let's have a look at this figure<br>so this here we have the long shirt<br>Direction here we have Crusher and<br>offshore is down and here you can see a<br>Casp here you can see another and here<br>you can see that we removed everything<br>we smoothed everything okay it's not<br>perfect it's not perfectly planner but I<br>invite you to get the bulldozer go on<br>the beach and try to make things planner<br>it doesn't quite work like that with the<br>tight running up still it was planner<br>enough for us<br>and as a result of this after a few days<br>here we go we have a nice caspet Beach<br>okay we have great data Giovanni now you<br>have to model it<br>so<br>I don't know how well you know me<br>but I think those that know me they do<br>know that<br>I enjoy Theory<br>I enjoy thinking<br>but going to the field and dealing with<br>the real world it's a little bit tough<br>for me<br>and Duke Ellington in this case came to<br>help because a lot of times I thought I<br>should just give up the real world is<br>just too messy I can just work on my<br>theoretical things and enjoy them I<br>didn't give up and in the end when I<br>started my model simulations with this<br>initial topography the the numerical<br>model after a lot of work ended up<br>producing this type of figure which is<br>not too different from what we have<br>actually measured<br>now I'm actually happy that I put all<br>this effort on this because actually<br>this did help<br>people finally started looking at the<br>problem in a different way<br>and in fact<br>we started working with a group of<br>scientists on a lot of other patterns<br>and we just turned around the way people<br>were thinking<br>we completely removed some accepted<br>theories and came up with new ideas new<br>hypothesis<br>so that's really good but where's the<br>Jazz<br>where's the Jazz in all of this so I<br>hope you will allow me from for a little<br>interlude<br>is there self-organization in jazz<br>because it's self-organization is this<br>word that we use to to to Define what<br>happens with feedbacks<br>and yes there is software organization<br>there are studies that shows how<br>musicians synchronize to improve the<br>effect of Swing<br>um but I personally think that just like<br>beach cusps are the perfect prototype to<br>study bad forms in jazz if we want to<br>study self-organization feedbacks the<br>duo is probably<br>the the the setting that best helps<br>to say it's another prototype really and<br>there are some amazing Duos in jazz<br>incredible ones double bass in piano or<br>Cecil Taylor on piano playing with Max<br>Russian drums there are amazing Duos and<br>every time I go and see a Duo and the<br>music is good and the music clicks I'm<br>always amazed by this thing that I see<br>the musicians are looking at each other<br>all the time they have a natural smile<br>once I asked after I do it to a drummer<br>Joy bear and I said what's going on why<br>do you laugh so much when you play he<br>told me you just have no idea how much<br>fun I'm having<br>I said okay<br>that's what I do so I'll try to model it<br>so let's<br>let's try to model an improvising it<br>Jazz door and with some very simple<br>roles it's impossible to to model the<br>complexity of a human being of two human<br>beings interacting making music<br>that's just too much<br>so let's simplify let's abstract let's<br>let's reduce into just two terms for our<br>equations one that indicates how much<br>the musician itself himself is herself<br>is enjoying the music<br>so this personal satisfaction that comes<br>from playing and I'm sure you do need<br>musicians shape because you don't want<br>to just be lost you go today did they<br>play the right note they just know what<br>they're doing they played enough and so<br>then there is a that feeling of I'm<br>playing and I'm enjoying the playing<br>then there is another term in these<br>equations that is about the interaction<br>between the two musicians how much the<br>music<br>is being fed by the interaction between<br>the two musicians now I know that a lot<br>of people here will hate this thing here<br>I know some will catch it straight away<br>others will have some problems with that<br>so I decided to simplify it and show it<br>in more<br>understandable terms we have our Duo<br>double bass player and piano player<br>and what I'm trying to see is how<br>their feeling how their enjoyment or<br>non-enjoyment changes over time<br>and for each of them it changes as a<br>result of the way they're playing how<br>much they enjoy the way they're playing<br>and how much they interact with the<br>other musician those equations are just<br>saying what those figures are showing<br>now together with my collaborator GAO<br>Yang Lee we decided to use the national<br>super Computing facility to address this<br>problem<br>can't think of a better use<br>and we started seeing some interesting<br>things for example if the musicians are<br>not enjoying it or not enjoying what<br>they're doing<br>that's the end nothing is happening it's<br>boring you can see all the arrows in<br>this figure they pull the point towards<br>zero zero nothing is happening no fun<br>you need to<br>believe in yourself you need to enjoy<br>what you're doing<br>then we have other cases this one is the<br>case that taking an analogy from some<br>work done by strogan's famous<br>mathematician we have two different<br>types of musician one is the egotistic<br>egocentric<br>narcissist one the one that only enjoys<br>his own music doesn't care about<br>interacting<br>and then there's the other one that<br>instead it's all about the interaction<br>what happens when these two musicians<br>get together<br>well not much they end up as you can see<br>from that black line they end up going<br>around in circle but they don't end up<br>in a steady state in some sort of<br>equilibrium where there is a lot of fun<br>so no that's doesn't quite work and then<br>we realize that actually maybe the<br>models needed some change we are<br>simplifying things too much because if<br>we let the musicians enjoy themselves<br>and enjoying the interaction the model<br>goes crazy too much fun ecstasy<br>Paradise but to a level that we felt a<br>little bit if mathematician is looks at<br>this they will say and are you sure<br>about this so<br>we actually changed a little bit the<br>equations and here you can see that all<br>the lines put these to the Lords this<br>near Vana place where the musicians both<br>of them are having a lot of fun the<br>musician is the musicians are enjoying<br>it and I'm sure the the listeners are<br>enjoying too<br>okay so that was a little example to<br>show that there was that there's a<br>little bit of self-organization there is<br>self-organization also in there are<br>interaction between musicians now let's<br>go back to beaches because today we are<br>talking beaches and I've been showing<br>you amazing pictures of beaches they're<br>fantastic just like these ones with some<br>incredible patterns<br>now but they're not always like this<br>in fact sometimes a lot of times and<br>what we will see more and more will be<br>beaches like this and this is what I<br>want<br>this is not a random place this is<br>whatever pretty close to where we are<br>this is before Cyclone Gabriel this is<br>after notice this is a slide the blue<br>slide here and here<br>the roots are exposed<br>this is the other side of the beach<br>so yes it's great it we do need to<br>understand we don't need to understand<br>processes but we also need to predict we<br>also need to understand what's happening<br>to our beaches and this brings to our<br>the second part of our of our discussion<br>today<br>because we need to predict and what can<br>we use for prediction we can use some of<br>those complicated equations that you've<br>seen earlier on I'm sure you're all<br>dying for me to explain what each of<br>those terms indicates<br>or we can use a completely different<br>approach<br>now here in the audience there's Malcolm<br>green and about 15 years ago we had<br>coffee<br>so I strongly advise you to notify with<br>him<br>and at some point I I said you know this<br>thing of machine learning 15 years ago<br>there was no chat GPT at the time<br>I said this thing of machine learning is<br>bizarre how can it be<br>Malcolm looked at me and said just do it<br>and so we see how it works and then we<br>add coffee and kept chatting two weeks<br>later he came into my office and said so<br>how is it going with the machine<br>learning and I'm like whoa so I have to<br>do it for real<br>and actually I did it for real and that<br>opened up an entire New Field of<br>research that that is now quite<br>important to me and that I think it has<br>a lot of promise<br>it's machine learning it's which is just<br>a branch of artificial intelligence<br>and machine learning is really<br>fascinating I took this quote from a<br>Nobel Prize not in physics not in<br>computer science science in economics<br>in 1978<br>Simone was already thinking<br>that yes we can generate machine that<br>improve themselves notice he didn't use<br>the word learning and probably learning<br>is slightly different thing but<br>programs computers that automatically<br>improve their performance that's<br>fascinating<br>I can see a future where I just stay in<br>bed<br>or I play the saxophone and try to<br>improve my pathetic musician skills and<br>in the meanwhile the computer improves<br>the performance yeah I like it<br>and in fact you probably don't I'm sure<br>you know that already machine learning<br>is shaping up your life<br>use Spotify use probably because of the<br>audience there's also a lot of people<br>they all use machine learning because<br>those they they are algorithm that they<br>can learn what you like<br>and so they can offer you<br>what you<br>think you like<br>well<br>not particular not a big fan of spotify<br>and but<br>I am a I'm a fan of<br>self-customizing self-learning<br>and if it works with Spotify<br>why shouldn't it work for beaches<br>so that's what I started thinking about<br>and nowadays I mean they can drive cars<br>it's questionable how they do it but<br>they can drive cars automatically<br>they can write essays<br>so<br>why shouldn't they do some other work<br>that I do that is like analyze beach<br>images for example or predict<br>characteristics that are important in<br>the near shore<br>well okay<br>let's do it and so first I'll show you a<br>couple of of simple examples of simpler<br>examples that are actually very<br>important because at this point we have<br>moved from patterns to trying to deal<br>with Coastal hazards like flooding or<br>erosion<br>now in the case of flooding we have done<br>some I think interesting work using<br>some techniques in machine learning for<br>example this one is called genetic<br>programming and we are trying to predict<br>how far the water goes up and down the<br>beach<br>and here you can see the performance of<br>a model good performances if you stay on<br>this line<br>of the most used model<br>and then this is the performance<br>of our machine learning predictors I<br>don't think there's much discussion we<br>and that's one now more recently<br>Charlene<br>Darling House worked on another key<br>component of coastal flooding<br>and this compound this again was a<br>little bit of a shocker because a lot of<br>people have tried look at all these old<br>models<br>trying to stay on that dashed line there<br>and then look at Charlene's models well<br>they're clearly much better it's clear<br>it's clear that machine learning helps a<br>lot and so it helps a lot<br>are doing something that is quite<br>now this is work that I love but what I<br>would speak today is something that<br>looks much more into the future<br>is what is called Deep learning probably<br>many of you have heard of it now deep<br>learning is a relatively new approach to<br>other type of algorithms for machine<br>learning and here I'm speaking about the<br>work that is going on right now on the<br>fifth floor of this building and it's<br>Eduardo Gomez that is<br>doing it and is<br>Eduardo is someone that can complicate<br>things so we get along super well so<br>deep learning is complicated and there<br>are different types of algorithm what<br>Eduardo did was he took one complicated<br>algorithm called convolutional neural<br>networks and he coupled it with another<br>complicated algorithm called The Long<br>shorter memory now these two complicated<br>algorithms they do slightly different<br>things one extract features the other<br>looks at temporal dependencies memory<br>within the system he put the two of them<br>together<br>and as a result<br>he developed the predictor of Shoreline<br>change now we're like here in New<br>Zealand because we have an incredible<br>data set from a beach in the coromandel<br>tairua beach we have all over 20 years<br>of measurements so we could use the<br>model we could use this data to train<br>the model<br>and what we see here in these figures<br>here is time and here is the shoreline<br>position<br>is the performance in black on both<br>panels you have the observations so the<br>measurements the real data and in blue<br>you can see the model of Eduardo here<br>you can see two more models in green and<br>brown that are the established models<br>the latest models that are available in<br>the literature and you can definitely<br>see that we also have quantitative<br>measures but the model of Eduardo is<br>actually doing a lot better<br>now one of those models<br>that we called spads for who knows<br>reason<br>is also been developed by us here at the<br>University of Auckland and so this gives<br>me the opportunity to speak because this<br>is all very fast but this is what I'm<br>doing now in the future two of what I<br>want to do and<br>I want to mention something that we<br>organized together with my research team<br>here here in Auckland<br>we start for the first time we decided<br>to organize a competition I called it a<br>non-competitive competition<br>invited scientists from all around the<br>world<br>all the famous modelers of the shoreline<br>beach erosion we gave them the data and<br>we told them this is the data of Tyra<br>Beach from 1999 to 2000 and<br>14<br>try to predict what happens in 2015 2016<br>2017.<br>this was again a radical change in the<br>way we do things in our community it's<br>not anymore about publishing papers it's<br>about really testing how your models are<br>working your capability to predict<br>and everyone in the end was competing<br>for this hat<br>and we had a fantastic time we also<br>generated really an entire community and<br>and the model that one was a deep<br>learning model<br>so already in there there was the seed<br>that what we are doing is the way to<br>probably look at the future and to look<br>at predictions because machine learning<br>works really well<br>now the music that you hear in the<br>background<br>uh you can see in playing<br>his hearing blue<br>now two years ago Keith Jared at the<br>stroke<br>no stews of his left hand and cannot<br>play anymore<br>probably my favorite jazz musician<br>so<br>together with<br>Michael friends colleagues from the<br>center of research the center of<br>research is a fantastic initiative from<br>the University of Auckland we have some<br>super smart people that help us with the<br>most complicated problems I abuse them<br>all the time<br>and I sat with them and we started<br>discussing I said you know when you<br>improvise in jazz just put things one<br>after the next at the time chat GPT<br>didn't exist<br>because that's exactly how chat GPT<br>Works Chan GPT is behind the Deep<br>learning model<br>and my colleagues here they said well it<br>should work you should definitely be<br>able to develop music to generate music<br>in fact<br>we realized that people were already<br>generating music with a specific Style<br>and so we try to generate music in the<br>style of Keith Jarrett and actually what<br>you're listening to now<br>the color has changed to Red this is<br>Keith Jared Jen music generated by<br>it's quite amazing a musician might<br>complain that the pedal is not done<br>really well<br>musician could complain that sometimes<br>maybe the machine learning algorithm<br>gets a little bit over excited and plays<br>but overall<br>there is little doubt that<br>machine learning is is quite amazing<br>it's it's really scary<br>apart from some instances I do struggle<br>to to understand if this is real kiss<br>gyroid or if it's<br>artificially generated very scary but<br>but this is also the future we have we<br>are dealing with the radian we will deal<br>okay<br>for a quick summary<br>of the things that I've been trying to<br>communicate with you<br>well on the left there are two quotes of<br>my two favorite jazz musicians<br>that<br>are part of the way I try to be a<br>scientist<br>but today what we discussed was the<br>presence of patterns there are patterns<br>everywhere there are patterns in jazz<br>there are patterns on beaches they're a<br>great excuse to learn patterns let's not<br>dismiss them we must understand<br>regularity before we understand what's<br>happening<br>and what will happen in the future and<br>understanding is important and I love<br>understanding but there comes a moment<br>when we also have to get the our hands<br>dirty and we have to deal with<br>prediction<br>finally machine learning and Jazz<br>some people they're not my friends they<br>say the jazz is dead<br>some people they're not my friends they<br>said that machine learning is<br>just the joke again<br>I think they're both here to stay and<br>they're both ears to shape out our life<br>I have little doubt about that now<br>before I really finish<br>I would like to to thank<br>a few people and I will really limit<br>myself to the<br>to the academic ones because otherwise<br>this will get to be and there are too<br>many friends here<br>so first of all I want to thank my<br>students<br>undergraduate postgraduate postgraduate<br>in particular because it's fantastic<br>that the person gives you three years of<br>his life to work together on a project<br>and it's fantastic to see<br>those Minds shaping becoming researchers<br>from the first year when they just<br>they're waiting for me to the third year<br>when they think that everything I say is<br>wrong<br>it's a wonderful It's a Wonderful change<br>to see<br>then I want to thank<br>David Huntley Albert falcus and Brad<br>Werner because they've been my mentors<br>as I grew up as a scientist from England<br>Catalunya and in the U.S three amazing<br>scientists that taught me to love<br>science to do science and to be honest<br>always<br>and then I didn't put the pictures<br>primarily because one of these four<br>people that I'm going to mention I<br>couldn't find a nice picture but they're<br>all here<br>and the first one the first one that I<br>want to mention is is Terry Hume who was<br>I guess my boss when I first arrived in<br>New Zealand<br>and I told him a lot of fact about my<br>research and Terry always looked at me<br>in silence always concluded very good<br>don't forget<br>there is the real world<br>and he told me three times with a<br>spacing of several years and so every<br>time he tells me that things I feel like<br>oh what am I doing here<br>and then Malcolm green I told you this<br>is how we push me towards machine<br>learning but he pushed me to always try<br>things that I was not that I thought I<br>was not able to do do it do it anything<br>crazy do it<br>and then there's Simon thrash<br>who was spent a ridiculous amount of<br>time trying to teach me ecology<br>ridiculous<br>and I have no idea why it's ever been<br>doing it because yes we did work<br>together but I don't think it was a<br>worth investment given the size of my<br>brain<br>but I admire his patients and I admire<br>finally I want to thank Karen Bryan<br>Karen Bryant is<br>my super friend and collaborator we have<br>written a lot of papers together she's<br>the only person I think in New Zealand<br>that can stand me for for long enough so<br>that we can develop full projects<br>together we have worked together for<br>more than 20 years we plan to work<br>together for the next 20 years without<br>Karen Brian I wouldn't be here probably<br>I can only thank her for everything as<br>she's done and finally I want to thank<br>all of you I thank you so much for being<br>here and for supporting me all of you<br>thank you very much it has been a<br>pleasure</p></main><footer style="margin-top: 2rem;
