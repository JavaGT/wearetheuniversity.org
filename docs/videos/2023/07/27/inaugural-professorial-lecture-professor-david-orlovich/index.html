I was also at<br>Primary School up the road that year a<br>little to the north of of<br>Monterey and suburb of all close<br>one of the things I remember about<br>Sydney from those days is just how<br>fascinating it is biologically and it's<br>certainly a fascinating place<br>botanically but I wouldn't say that it<br>was a place known for its vegetables<br>however David tells us that one of the<br>things that got him interested in plants<br>at a young age was his parents veggie<br>garden and he has a distinct early<br>memory of being amazed at how you could<br>plant a bean seed and it would turn into<br>a plant that produced a green bean just<br>like you could find at the supermarket<br>or the green Grocers<br>but out of great things sometimes arises<br>disappointment young David did not like<br>another Fascination was a rock garden at<br>primary school and Sydney is certainly a<br>great place for Rock Gardens with the<br>fabulous Sydney sandstone in abundance<br>and here he discovered that if you paid<br>attention to the growing conditions you<br>could get plants to grow<br>this interest in Plants LED naturally to<br>his BSC honors from the University of<br>New South Wales before he continued it<br>on to a PhD at the same institution<br>graduating in 1994. this was followed by<br>a succession of postdocs<br>he went down to Melbourne then up to<br>Queensland and then back to New South<br>Wales before we had the Good Fortune to<br>recruit David to a lectureship here at<br>the University of otago in 1999.<br>as we have already heard from Professor<br>Blakey promotion to full professor at<br>the University of otago is far from easy<br>and one must excel at each of the<br>academic domains of research teaching<br>and Professional Service<br>David has been a productive researcher<br>with more than 60 Journal articles and<br>book chapters to his name<br>his track record in attracting research<br>grants has been outstanding and he's<br>used this to advance our understanding<br>since 2016 he's used a New Zealand one<br>million dollar in-kind grant funding<br>jointly with the U.S department of<br>Energy's genome Institute a community<br>science program to investigate the<br>fungal evolution of fruit bodies and<br>truffle-like fungi these fungi also led<br>to a Marsden fund standard Grant as a<br>Prof principal investigator<br>David's interest<br>extends more broadly to plant fungi<br>relationships and has 2013 paper in<br>mycologia excited the global mycology<br>community<br>because he showed that fungal<br>colonization of the canopy roots of our<br>endemic Silver Beach provides an<br>unexpected means<br>for increased host nutrition that may<br>have functional significance in forest<br>ecosystems<br>one of the standout features of<br>Professor olivich's research has been<br>the involvement of his students<br>he has as we just heard supervised more<br>than 60 postgraduate students this<br>includes 20 masters of science students<br>and 11 PhD students and more than half<br>of his published papers have been<br>co-published with his students<br>this commitment to teaching and students<br>should come as no surprise because it's<br>in his DNA his mum Phil was a high<br>school English teacher and Dad Peter<br>Elektra in archives Administration and I<br>the focus of<br>Professor olivich's teaching has been<br>exciting student interest in all things<br>botanical<br>and a priority has been the incoming<br>students he coordinated the flagship 100<br>level paper by all one two three and its<br>predecessor for some 15 years<br>and just as he brings his students into<br>his research he brings his research into<br>the classroom and his students have<br>contributed to a collective biodiversity<br>survey using DNA barcoding and I<br>naturalist and in 2022 they discovered a<br>species not known to occur in New<br>Zealand<br>in 2005 he won an otago University<br>Students Association supervisor award in<br>recognition of outstanding postgraduate<br>supervision he was also nominated for an<br>outhousa teaching award in 2009 and then<br>again in 2010 and our division of<br>science is outstanding teacher award in<br>2020.<br>in the words of his students David has a<br>passion for amongst other things<br>carnivorous plants and the way<br>understanding these things leads us to<br>fungi<br>and another student said I love how<br>excited about he gets about his research<br>it has developed an interest in fungi<br>that I never thought I would have<br>evidently all roads lead to fungi<br>the third domain in which a professor<br>must Excel is service and David has been<br>head of the department since March 2017<br>and I believe David was the first head<br>of Department that I got to appoint as a<br>PVC and as part of the process the<br>members of the department were invited<br>to come and talk to me about who they<br>thought should lead the department and<br>every single person except possibly<br>David said it has to be David<br>and can I say that the Department's<br>judgment has proven impeccable David's<br>been an outstanding head of Department<br>not just for the way he's LED his own<br>department but for the way he's<br>contributed to the divisional leadership<br>team he has many qualities that really<br>come to the foreign in those<br>forums<br>needless to say David's passion for<br>fungi is reflected in his service and a<br>standout has been his organization of<br>the annual fungal foray a week-long<br>community science Workshop which brings<br>together professional and amateur<br>mycologists from all over New Zealand<br>and overseas David has been a<br>participant in this since 2000 and he<br>has led the fungal foray since 2002.<br>he regularly identifies fungi for<br>members of the public<br>and for those who are risk-averse when<br>it comes to the consumption of fungi<br>he's also been known to provide urgent<br>consultation for the medical community<br>treating patients hospitalized as a<br>result of their culinary habits<br>I'll finish there I think it's now time<br>that we hear from Professor olivich<br>himself to hear firsthand about his<br>interests and enthusiasms in all things<br>Botanical that have led to this<br>celebration tonight please join me in<br>welcoming Professor David olivich<br>foreign<br>um yeah thank you Richard and Richard<br>for that I<br>had the thing can you show you talking<br>about the right person but I guess you<br>must have been<br>um I do recognize bits of it so thanks<br>very much for that kind introduction<br>thanks everybody for coming<br>um<br>right I was going to make it all about<br>fungi but everybody said oh you've got<br>to tell him a bit of your origin story<br>as well so I'll do that but before I<br>start on that the I have to explain the<br>mushroom that I'm holding because when<br>you're a Mycologist and you've been that<br>for 57 I haven't been that for 57 years<br>but for a while people ran out of ideas<br>for presents and so for my birthday this<br>year I lifted the cover up and there<br>were three of these big wooden mushrooms<br>and I didn't initially exactly know what<br>I was going to do with them and I had to<br>confess I thought I said that's<br>interesting but then I got an email that<br>said you got to bring along a prop for<br>the photograph for this and so instantly<br>I realized they had a purpose so<br>um so that's good in the shirt I think<br>was a Christmas present so that's cool<br>so yeah as<br>um there you go there's me and that's my<br>primary school uniform um so I guess<br>that was probably<br>um<br>oh gosh 76 or 77 something like that<br>um but I did want to mention carnivorous<br>plants it has already been said because<br>um yeah I did I mean I had I would guess<br>I was interested in lots of things when<br>I was a kid but<br>um but the plants did really excite me<br>and that Bean's story was the the taste<br>of the green bean didn't actually turn<br>me off thinking that plants are just<br>incredible the fact that this little<br>seed can turn into a plant and you can<br>do stuff with it but the other thing was<br>that I do remember like carnivorous<br>plants were pretty exciting in the in<br>this time and they weren't you couldn't<br>just go to a nursery like you can now or<br>the warehouse and buy venus fly traps<br>and they're all these beautiful big<br>tissue culture things that are really<br>fancy<br>um but there was I do remember watching<br>a documentary<br>which was narrated by Vincent Price who<br>was an old horror movie actor really<br>Suave looking dude and and I actually<br>just found it on YouTube and I spent a<br>good 15 minutes watching it again today<br>and it's from about 1974 and there was<br>time lapse photographs of venus fly<br>traps and and I think that sort of stuff<br>really stuck in my mind that like plants<br>were cool enough but plants that<br>actually ate animals and moved and you<br>know that was like next level<br>and then yeah in high school in year<br>nine which would have been 1980<br>one of the science teachers Mr rosker<br>who was a really funny guy from the<br>country from Canberra senior South Wales<br>he got up and said at assembly if anyone<br>wants to start a carnivorous plant Club<br>then come along to the science labs at<br>uh<br>um at lunchtime and so this is like<br>amazing so stand up and God there must<br>have been 50 60 kids there and there's<br>no room and he came out of this hind<br>slave into the like foyer there and said<br>I'm not having a club with this many<br>people in it go away and come back on<br>Monday with five dollars and so we all<br>scurried off and could hardly breathe<br>that weekend it was pretty exciting and<br>with anticipation I turned up and<br>thankfully only about five or six<br>students came back with the money and we<br>formed the Sydney Technical High School<br>carnivorous plant club and you know<br>there was a a guy in Adelaide who was<br>selling plants by mail order and so we'd<br>all contribute money<br>um<br>and put in an order for these things and<br>then a week later they'd all arrive<br>wrapped up you can glad wrap and we'd<br>share them around and we'd just meet at<br>lunch times once or twice a week in the<br>science labs and sit around going how's<br>your plants going and are pretty good<br>how's your plants go it's pretty good<br>and<br>um and yeah the Mr Roscoe is a pretty<br>cool teacher though he was um one of the<br>he wasn't really absent minded but he<br>played the sort of um<br>absent-minded teacher you know and the<br>students used to kind of make fun of him<br>but it was his way of getting them<br>engaged which is<br>pretty cool and one of the things that<br>also happened was that the society for<br>growing Australian plants which is now<br>called the Australian<br>like Australian plants growing<br>Australian Plant Society I think<br>they organized a flower show which was<br>quite a big thing in Suburban Sydney at<br>this time and we got asked if our<br>carnivorous plant club would put on an<br>exhibition like have we had a few<br>display tables and so we all brought<br>them along and to be quite honest we<br>really stood out because a lot of the<br>plants we had were not native plants you<br>know the Venus Fly Traps are from the<br>Carolinas in the USA but no one seemed<br>to care we did have some native<br>Australian Sun years and the like<br>and through that we did that over for<br>several years I got to meet this guy<br>here Peter old as a grevillea expert in<br>Australia he kind of organized that show<br>and he won't remember me from a bar of<br>soap but it was just cool to interact<br>with these people and that were<br>passionate about plants and as it<br>happened one year our table were set up<br>next to the national parks Association<br>table and I didn't fully understand at<br>the time but this is a little bit it's a<br>group a little bit like forest and bird<br>a sort of advocacy conservation group of<br>people that are<br>that uh you know supporting national<br>parks in New South Wales and this guy<br>Gary shower was Manning his table and<br>they were planting little<br>um Acacia seeds wattle seeds and give in<br>vermiculite and giving him away to the<br>kids with a leaflet on how to grow them<br>and I thought that was pretty cool and<br>um I think when he went off to lunch I<br>just sort of manned their table for a<br>while and then he sucked me into join in<br>that Society for uh eventually which I<br>was in for many years<br>um and you know again it was just a<br>little thing but it just was gave me<br>exposure to this um sort of environment<br>of people that were interested in the<br>outdoors in um and especially in plants<br>and there was radio TV celebrities there<br>I never got to meet them personally but<br>some of the Australians will know Graham<br>and Sandra Ross are sort of TV type<br>gardeners you know I did actually meet<br>Don Burke at one of them before his TV<br>show became really famous backyard but<br>he's kind of been canceled now for<br>possibly good reasons so that's it so<br>yeah was a big thing and then in 1981<br>when I was in year 10 really<br>surprisingly big conference came to<br>Sydney which I didn't know much about at<br>the time but it was the international<br>Botanical Congress and this is a<br>a really big conference that's got like<br>thousands of delegates you know and in<br>1981 at Sydney University it was the<br>first time that had been in the southern<br>hemisphere<br>and it's a you know one of these multi<br>millions of parallel sessions and things<br>it's actually the conference where they<br>decide on any changes to the rules of<br>naming plants but that's probably not<br>why I thought it was that exciting at<br>the time<br>um but<br>um yeah the previous one had been in<br>Leningrad and so I was in year 10 deeply<br>into carnivorous plants and what<br>happened was that some technicians I<br>think or two staff Dennis Jacobs and<br>John peerman at the botany School in at<br>Sydney University organized the youth<br>program for that conference and it was<br>like a parallel session that school kids<br>came to from all over New South Wales<br>and<br>um it went from the Monday morning to<br>the Friday night and uh I didn't know<br>anybody that was you know any of the<br>other kids that were there but we all<br>did projects and I of course did a<br>poster on carnivorous plants and I took<br>a few of my plants alone and one of them<br>actually got on the TV which um which<br>was pretty exciting<br>um and they'd organized for us a lecture<br>series and they chose the speakers from<br>the speakers at the conference so there<br>were some really big names there and so<br>it was pretty good idea and I don't<br>think that um I've ever been to a<br>conference where I've been aware that<br>that sort of thing has has been done you<br>know it seemed like cool<br>um so yeah I do remember this guy down<br>the bottom there is John Pate who was a<br>Western Australian botanist he showed<br>some pictures of carnivorous plants so I<br>knew I was in the right place and we had<br>a lecture from Peter Raven who's a guy<br>who<br>write the first year textbook that we<br>still use here at otago biology of<br>plants so that was cool and he talked<br>about how you can get aphids to stick<br>their little styloid into the stem of<br>the plant and they focus in on where the<br>sugar is there's like where the phloem<br>is and then they blast the laser off<br>with a blast the aphid off with a laser<br>and then they can get the sugar out and<br>measure it I don't think it was his work<br>but he wrote The Textbook so you could<br>talk about whatever he wants right so<br>um and you know because I think that<br>this was such a big conference to come<br>down to the Southern Hemisphere and be<br>in Australia it was a bit of a landmark<br>moment for botany in Australia and so it<br>was quite cool to be part of that as a<br>school kid<br>um the Australian biological resources<br>study have been planning for a few years<br>to launch this series Sephora of<br>Australia and they launched the first<br>two volumes of that at the Botanical<br>Congress you can see Australia Post put<br>out a pre-stamped envelope with a first<br>day cover thing there and um yeah<br>funnily enough one of the students the<br>school kids that was there was this guy<br>here who I found on the internet<br>yesterday he's still alive<br>um called David Banks and he was maybe a<br>year or two above me at school and he<br>was an orchid expert and his dad ran an<br>awkward Nursery up in the Northeast<br>Northwest of Sydney and I think he<br>actually rented himself now<br>and yeah I knew all about carnivorous<br>plants seeing you fear a little bit<br>about carnivorous plans but maybe not<br>quite as much as I did but he knew a lot<br>about orchids and we went on one of the<br>field trips to karing guy Chase National<br>Park one after noon and that's where at<br>the days that was well known because<br>that's where they filmed Skippy the Bush<br>Kangaroo of course that's where they<br>filmed home and away now<br>or that area and yeah David could walk<br>along the track and I was following him<br>he'd go oh that's you know grevillea or<br>something or other that's Curry or<br>reflexor that's epacra's impression and<br>he could he knew all the Latin names for<br>all the plants and that was better than<br>me and I was pretty damn jealous I've<br>got to confess so<br>um so yeah I did get this exposure to<br>people who I thought were kind of more<br>impressive than I was and I needed to be<br>like that and uh David's gone on and<br>written his book on cultivation of<br>orchids and that's him in Wellington a<br>couple of years ago presenting the<br>Orchid of the Year award to this guy<br>called Merv in Wellington so<br>um so from my sample size of two people<br>that went to that we've both kept in our<br>area of vitamin which is um good<br>so<br>um<br>I'm probably gonna jump over a few<br>things here and go straight to my the<br>research that I did for my honors and<br>for my PhD and my main supervisor for my<br>honors mphd was Professor Ann Ashford<br>and as it happens and sister lives here<br>in Dunedin and her sister's husband is<br>Professor Dorian Owen from economics so<br>it was a kind of weird connection that I<br>didn't expect I was going to have here<br>um and from very early on in the<br>lectures that Anne gave she made<br>everything seem really exciting you know<br>much more exciting than it probably<br>really was I don't know she had this<br>sort of Brute Force excitement<br>enthusiasm about everything that she<br>taught and that was pretty motivating<br>and exciting my other supervisor for my<br>research work was Guy Cox and Guy worked<br>at Sydney University and I was at New<br>South Wales University one of the<br>advantages there was that if a<br>microscope broke down at New South Wales<br>I could just get in the car and I had<br>kind of free reign of both of the<br>electron microscope units there<br>um but yeah the underlying basis for the<br>research that was going on in the lab or<br>some of it anyway was that the that<br>fungi play a really important role<br>in mediating the communication or the<br>transfer of minerals nutrients water<br>even between the soil and the plants so<br>there's this saying that has been coined<br>for a long long time plants don't have<br>Roots they have mycorrhizes and the<br>mycorrhizae is this kind of symbiotic<br>organ that is a union between the fungi<br>and the plants<br>okay and so<br>um at the time where I was in Sydney I<br>mean this is a picture from nicotuma in<br>the Blue Mountains but much of the<br>vegetation you can see there is<br>dominated by eucalyptus and Eucalyptus<br>is one of the trees in Australia that<br>forms these mycorrhizal associations so<br>fungus root associations you can see<br>them in the picture there the colors<br>that you can see are the fungus growing<br>all around the outside of the root and<br>um in certain times of the year these<br>fungi that are growing there often<br>produce fruit bodies that you can that<br>come up in them you know on the forest<br>floor and these are mushrooms that<br>you're in toadstools that you might see<br>so<br>um so that's a sort of big picture<br>what's the fungi do for the plants well<br>the main thing that fungi do for for<br>these fungi do for the plants that were<br>sort of appreciated at the time is that<br>they improve the phosphate nutrition of<br>the plants especially in a natural<br>situation where Native soils are very<br>low in phosphate and those plants tend<br>to wouldn't do as well without those<br>fungi they may not be able to grow at<br>all if they don't have those fungi<br>associated with them so there's lots of<br>interest in understanding how plants<br>survive in the wild by understanding the<br>fungi that are associated with them<br>New Zealand is the same and I'll get on<br>to that in a moment um with our beach<br>Forest the fungus that I stated from my<br>PhD was this really ugly looking thing<br>called posolethistinctorius it was known<br>as a horse-dropping fungus so this is<br>the fruit body for it and I've got to<br>say you would tend to poke it with a<br>stick to make sure it is a fungus before<br>you pick it up when it's cultured in<br>Petri disha it's got a nice yellow<br>culture there a color there I've put<br>that species name in inverted commas<br>there because what it was called when I<br>did the work is probably not what it's<br>called now because there's been changes<br>there but I'm going to really summarize<br>my whole or part of my whole PhD in one<br>slide by just saying that the<br>traditional way of looking at these<br>fungal cells was to fix them with nasty<br>chemicals you know aldehyde fixative<br>stains look at them under the microscope<br>so you could see what was going on put<br>them in the electron microscope and<br>under the light microscope you see these<br>little red stating granules and we knew<br>that they contain phosphate so that's<br>where the phosph easy nice fungal cells<br>so frankly phosphate is going to go from<br>the soil to the plant via the fungus<br>that kind of understanding at the time<br>was that it must somehow be in those<br>granules okay but the trouble is that<br>these fungal cells have cross walls<br>every couple of hundred micrometers so<br>this whole palava with having to try and<br>get you get the granular moves along one<br>end of the cell to the next and then it<br>must break down and pass through that<br>the phosphate must go through the cross<br>wall into the next one gets passed along<br>and it didn't really make that much<br>sense and one of the so one weekend<br>really end my supervisor was like well<br>if he I was really questioning are these<br>things actually real you know I said<br>like sometimes when I prepare them for<br>the microscope I don't see them and<br>she's like we'll prove it you know if<br>you don't think they're real and you've<br>got to show what what's really happening<br>so one weekend I just sat there looking<br>at the fungus under the light microscope<br>while it was alive and you could see<br>that those cells didn't really have<br>those granules in them they're very<br>Dynamic the things move around the<br>vacuoles are passing connecting with<br>each other and disconnecting and<br>what I did was under the cover slip of<br>the microscope I flooded all the<br>chemicals that you normally do to<br>prepare them for the microscope and and<br>as I did that I slowly saw these<br>granules appearing and so we wrote a<br>paper basically saying that these<br>polyphosphate granules houses one way<br>they were called are an artifact of<br>specimen preparation you know and as it<br>happened we had another a postdoc in the<br>lab called Virginia Shepard who was<br>looking at the same organisms but she<br>was um looking at them with a<br>fluorescence microscope and she'd come<br>up to the lab with all it's saying she'd<br>just been down there looking at these<br>things and they had all these amazing<br>vacuoles that are moving around and<br>these little<br>um like strings of pearls and and<br>clusters of like Bunches of grapes was<br>another term she used to describe and at<br>that point I'd spent years getting<br>really good at electron microscopy and<br>it just happened that I had pictures of<br>all of these weird shaped things that<br>she was talking about in the living<br>cells so again we wrote some nice papers<br>together<br>describing this vacuole system and it<br>really was kind of big news when we<br>published that this sort of part of the<br>reason that people had missed all this<br>is because the specimen preparation<br>methods were pretty rough and dodgy and<br>and that really kind to gave this idea<br>that there was a a more sensible<br>workable idea for a pathway for nutrient<br>transport along the fungal cells now<br>I've gone into a bit of that detail<br>there just because one of our students<br>this year Edie Rogan is actually going<br>to have a look at another fungus with a<br>similar<br>question but she's not looking at<br>phosphate transport but nitrogen<br>transport because there is some evidence<br>that some of these fungi transport<br>nitrogen as well so that's kind of why I<br>wanted to show you that<br>um<br>yeah I guess I I this some of this stuff<br>I just did on the weekend under the<br>microscope was pretty simple stuff and<br>you do wonder when you do stuff like<br>that you think why doesn't anyone why<br>hasn't anyone else noticed that and<br>funnily enough when we wrote the paper<br>showing that these granules were an<br>artifact I came across a paper in French<br>from 1947 that said that midochromatic<br>granules are an artifact of specimen<br>preparation caused by the precipitation<br>of certain dyes so we actually only<br>rediscovered something but it was<br>something that had been not realized so<br>that's that the other thing is I went to<br>had a funny experience I went to a<br>conference in Belgium in the early 2000s<br>and I met a Polish Professor who said to<br>me that when that paper came out I was<br>the most hated scientist in Europe and<br>oh god really I didn't want to I had no<br>idea to be honest but she said that um<br>that it was because they were having<br>trouble getting papers published after<br>that if they'd use these methods for<br>electron microscopy you know and so and<br>she said to me that one of the<br>resentments was that they didn't have<br>the fancy technology that I had I can<br>tell you to freeze those cells to put<br>them in the electron micro microscope I<br>grew them over a bit of membrane filter<br>and in fact it was the stuff between the<br>membrane filters that stopped the<br>membrane filter sticking together<br>because someone said try the membrane<br>filters and I didn't realize what they<br>were talking about so I used the spacer<br>stuff I grew them over then I cut them<br>out and stick them on the end of a<br>pencil with rubber on the end of it and<br>bang them onto the the copper block that<br>was cooled with liquid nitrogen and it<br>was all homemade stuff so it wasn't high<br>technology but we obviously<br>um you know made it look like we knew<br>what we were doing so it was kind of<br>cool<br>and she did say oh but after having been<br>had the week in Belgium with her and you<br>know every beer as a party in a bottle<br>in Belgium it was like oh you're not so<br>not as bad as I thought you would be so<br>that was good<br>um Friday so I I just want to very<br>briefly mention that by the time I'd<br>finished my PhD<br>um you know all the field work I did was<br>going down to the constant temperature<br>and getting another culture here<br>subculturing and every six weeks I got<br>pretty sick of that so<br>um and it just happened to come up that<br>there was a postdoc at the University of<br>Melbourne to look at the development of<br>flowers in the mertesi the Myrtle family<br>which includes Peter Cara and rata and<br>Monica and karnica here and I didn't<br>know much about the mathasi I didn't<br>know much about the evolutionary biology<br>that was behind this I didn't really<br>know much about floral development but I<br>certainly learned it but what I did know<br>was that I was a good microscopist and<br>they really wanted someone to see to be<br>able to use a scanning electron<br>microscope and I should just put a<br>little interlet in there when I was<br>doing my PhD at one point my supervisor<br>didn't have any funding to pay for the<br>use of the Electoral microscope and<br>focusing on the pro Vice chancellors<br>here and and we worked out a deal that I<br>would demonstrate in the EM unit for<br>free and then in return for that I had<br>free reign of the microscopes and<br>honestly for all of the years that I did<br>my PhD<br>um I think my demonstrating was one<br>afternoon a year to the new honor<br>students and I could be in there at 1am<br>on a Saturday and Sunday morning you<br>know doing the X-ray analyzes and things<br>and I came out of it really well it was<br>a good deal it was very generous but but<br>I just can't help thinking that that if<br>this was a bit of a user pacing I don't<br>think I would have this expertise that I<br>have now right so it's pretty hard and a<br>lot of trial and error lots of failed<br>stuff<br>um you know yeah anyway<br>um so I got that job and then I um I<br>learned a lot of scanning electron<br>microscopy one of the cool things about<br>these flowers is the showy part is<br>you'll know this from pohutokawa the<br>show we party in this family are the<br>stamens often you know they're not so<br>much the pedals and<br>um<br>classification in this family is often<br>on the way the stamens are arranged in<br>the fam in the flower and yeah really I<br>guess the upside of what we kind of<br>discovered is that really it's when you<br>look at these little buds there's a tiny<br>Bud the thing I've got label with a K<br>are the sepals the green bits around the<br>flower a couple of petals there and then<br>the little stamens just starting to form<br>the the way the final flower turns out<br>is really a bit of a function of how<br>much space there is on the floral bud<br>when it's developing you know and this<br>really minor changes in timing can lead<br>to very different floral architectures<br>so that was pretty good fun I met lots<br>of really great people in Melbourne I<br>met I learned a lot about evolutionary<br>biology that I really didn't know so<br>much about so it was really rewarding<br>and in fact these photos are not from<br>Melbourne but when I came here I had a<br>my first PhD student with Steve belsham<br>and he carried on that work with some<br>um other groups of mercatious Plant City<br>included some of the New Zealand natives<br>as well so that was kind of cool but<br>really this is a good day in the office<br>and so<br>I was introduced to the New Zealand<br>fungal foray when I first got here and<br>I'll say a few words about that in a<br>minute but<br>um yeah I guess I have kept up the plant<br>work you know and it's good you can see<br>also with all the background I had while<br>I was sort of you know I was in a<br>position to be able to teach the basic<br>botany stuff and I could also teach some<br>mycology I could do the classification<br>Etc so it was pretty cool but yeah this<br>so this is David little in the middle<br>there who's in the audience here and<br>Andy Nelson on the in the red on the<br>right I think Andy hates the fact that I<br>keep bringing up this photo sorry<br>but for some reason I just thought it<br>was a nice photo that's at the Lake<br>Crystal Bell track which I think is just<br>south of Springs Junction in the uh<br>upper part of the north island and what<br>we do is really really just walk through<br>the forests in the right time of the<br>year which was often Autumn and look for<br>mushrooms that's it when we find them we<br>go yeah aren't they pretty and<br>um<br>if we have permission which we've been<br>lucky enough to for the much part of our<br>collecting well for all of our<br>collecting much part of the time that<br>I've been here then we will make<br>collections of those<br>um and then bring them back here and<br>study them but I know there's people<br>watching here and this was put on the<br>mushrooms of New Zealand photography<br>Facebook group there's people here who<br>are far greater mushroom photographers<br>than me and I just know that<br>you know in a way you don't have to be<br>like me and want to know what the name<br>of it is and you know to be able to<br>appreciate mushrooms people just like<br>like seeing them and like photographing<br>them and one of my friends his wife does<br>a is in a photographic group and she<br>said that fungi are always a top you<br>know topic for people wanting to um to<br>take photographs of and so if any of you<br>are interested in this then you know<br>there's mushrooms of New Zealand<br>photography Facebook page lovely<br>photographs beautiful composition they<br>never you know nice clean specimens OMG<br>idyllic composition that's what you know<br>that's pretty cool<br>um<br>Instagram there are some really good<br>fungus appreciators there there's an<br>account called fungi file with an<br>underscore that's actually<br>um Tess McBride who is a PhD student<br>here in the microbiology department and<br>her PhD was not on fungi at all she's<br>doing a postdoc on fungi now but she's<br>got this beautiful Instagram page with<br>the most incredible photographs she's<br>postdocking in Sydney now but<br>um so I've put those up just because I<br>want to acknowledge the fact that<br>there's lots of people out there who are<br>far better photographers than me and I<br>just tend to take photos with my iPhone<br>when I'm in the field and they're not<br>overly I don't know when I look at those<br>I think the fungi don't actually stand<br>out that well you know they're kind of<br>blending in with the background a little<br>bit but the advantage of taking a photo<br>on your iPhone is that it's got a GPS<br>tag so you don't have to forget you can<br>remember where it's from<br>and<br>um<br>I do try to<br>um you know get as many views as I can<br>you know there's nothing more<br>frustrating than getting a photo where<br>you just see the top of a mushroom and<br>you can't see what it looks like on the<br>underside so people who photograph fungi<br>know that you really in order to have a<br>chance at identifying it even to genus<br>you really want to see the top and the<br>bottom so that's why I've turned some of<br>these over and I've left some standing<br>there but the field photos I do find<br>um kind of they look a bit better but<br>I'm not as good a photographer as some<br>of the people watching here so I tend to<br>then once I've collected these I'll take<br>them back to wherever we're staying and<br>put them on a gray background with a<br>piece of glass perspex and take a<br>photograph with video lights on each<br>side four corners and<br>um<br>yeah I find that the lighting in these<br>it gives me a better ability to gives us<br>a better ability because I'm Andy<br>actually does a lot of the descriptions<br>of our fungi to be able to see all the<br>features that one might need to see to<br>be able to either identify it or if<br>we've determined that it's an<br>undescribed species and to be able to<br>write a description based on the um on<br>the photograph and in fact that green<br>one in the center left there is a<br>um but yeah I don't know there's a few<br>books that have mastering photos like<br>these but um David little coined the<br>term dead rat photos<br>um and let's say<br>um which makes me sort of feel like oh<br>they're not that good but because<br>they're laid out like dead rats you know<br>but it's kind of stuck actually now I<br>just thought oh we've taken the dead<br>rats yet yep so<br>um so I think they're kind of useful<br>maybe technical photos is the right way<br>to say it so then what we do is we will<br>take the dead rat photo maybe we'll have<br>a field photo as well make notes about<br>it this is one from 2014 from a place up<br>near Nelson<br>um we'll make a note of the plants that<br>it was associated with this is one of<br>these mycorrhizal fungi once we've got<br>the collection details a specimen number<br>photo number stuff like that and then we<br>put it on fruit dehydrator and the fruit<br>dehydrator will<br>um<br>basically shrivel it up and look<br>horrible after that like a dried<br>mushroom that you might find in a bag in<br>the supermarket the cool thing is that<br>if you dry them reasonably quickly like<br>on the same day that you collected them<br>and<br>um<br>and they are in good condition in the<br>first place then their DNA remains quite<br>intact in those specimens and you can go<br>in with some forceps and take off some<br>of the Gill tissue and rehydrate them<br>under potassium hydroxide on the<br>microscope slide and then the the<br>microscopy that you need to do on those<br>is totally fine and in fact doing the<br>microscopy from the dried specimen is<br>kind of the standard way rather than the<br>fresh just because then everything looks<br>the same so that's kind of what we do<br>then we type all that stuff into an<br>Excel spreadsheet save the photos we<br>will upload them onto eye naturalist now<br>so that's pretty impressive as he was<br>our naturalist people good on you wow I<br>wanted to intimidate the ones who didn't<br>by making them be the ones that put<br>their hands up so hopefully while you're<br>watching I'm going to get boring after a<br>while so sign up to I naturalist on your<br>phones<br>um it's sort of like social media for<br>organisms you know and you can put fungi<br>on there you can if I see a crane fly on<br>the bathroom when on the bathroom wall<br>when I'm just getting out of the shower<br>snap it sorry too much information<br>um and someone people identify them you<br>know moths all sorts it's really amazing<br>there's the GPS tag will allow it to be<br>located on a map<br>yep so it's pretty good got a scale in<br>there I will upload a field photo if I<br>have it one of the things is that if you<br>use a Creative Commons license on there<br>then then people can take those images<br>and reuse them on Wikipedia and if you<br>don't use that type of a license like<br>ccby then then your photo won't be able<br>to be used on Wikipedia and just this<br>year we had the botany 365 students<br>there's a few of them here today write<br>Wikipedia Pages for fungi that didn't<br>have Wikipedia pages and we were able to<br>troll our naturalists to get photos off<br>there which is pretty cool so there's<br>another 16 fungi on there that weren't<br>there a few months ago<br>um<br>right now this does can contribute to<br>distributional information because once<br>more than once two people have agreed<br>that that is the right identification<br>for that species then they'll get<br>uploaded onto gbif which is a global<br>biodiversity information<br>database and so that becomes a record of<br>where that organism grows<br>so yeah I mentioned the New Zealand<br>fungal foray I certainly wasn't around<br>when it started<br>um but I arrived here in 1999 and the<br>first one I went on was in 2000 we tried<br>to go to a different part of the country<br>every year that was just been in Rotorua<br>this year it was not on last year<br>because of covered<br>um next year the plan is for it to be in<br>the caramea area in the upper North<br>upper west coast of the south island and<br>what we do is we find a base somewhere<br>like a hall and we set up Trestle tables<br>with microscopes that's from 1986.<br>honestly nothing much looks any<br>different the microscopes are better now<br>I don't think the dress sense is any<br>different<br>and we collect in the mornings and we<br>will get a permit from Doc we'll have a<br>list of tracks that we can go to we'll<br>bring our collections back around<br>lunchtime and then spend time spending<br>time it's when I do the photographing<br>and making notes about them talking to<br>other people about what the hell this<br>fungus is that I've never seen before<br>Etc we generally have a day the middle<br>of the week where we have a day of talks<br>which is a mycology colloquium which is<br>a really great thing there's always<br>overseas speakers at that and really<br>enjoyable things students telling us<br>um yeah when we were up in Northland<br>that's a more recent one um this was at<br>open only area school and they let us<br>use one of their science labs you know<br>it was great and those four students up<br>there uh some there was a couple of<br>biology students where they didn't have<br>a biology teacher you know and so they<br>were doing the ncea online for that<br>which is pretty hard going I guess the<br>camera set up you know straight onto the<br>laptop<br>um there's Park<br>um who's one of the landcare scientists<br>who does a bit of the databasing<br>um<br>some of you might know Jerry Cooper with<br>his back to us there he's a prominent<br>eye naturalist user and probably New<br>Zealand's best mushroom identifier<br>um<br>and there's our group photo from the<br>Rotorua one and we were hosted by Scion<br>up in Rotorua which was a cool place to<br>visit and yet we have a fungal foray<br>flag<br>all right<br>so maybe now I'll get it a bit of the<br>biological stuff<br>um how are we going oh God they're not<br>bad all right so<br>um so yeah as you can see I've been out<br>collecting lots of fungi and trying to<br>understand what sort of diversity we<br>have here in New Zealand the beach<br>Forest there's lots of fighting at the<br>fungal foray about where we're going to<br>go and half the people like me included<br>want to go to beach forests other people<br>are sick of going to beach Forest why do<br>we have to go to beach forests all the<br>time and my reasoning is because about a<br>quarter of the species of fungi of<br>mushroom forming fungi in New Zealand<br>are associated with not the faga so<br>mycorizer with another figure so it's<br>pretty high success rate for finding the<br>sorts of fungi that I want to do<br>research on and the people have<br>estimated this was an old estimate 20<br>years ago now that about 20 only about<br>20 of the fungi that we find in New<br>Zealand overall have a name you know<br>I've been a known to science and so that<br>is something that kind of motivates me<br>to keep going and to collect more<br>specimens but if you do the sums in and<br>out of how long I've got left in my<br>working life it doesn't actually add up<br>so it may not be possible but it's um<br>sort of one of the things that is kind<br>of exciting to do so one of the things<br>when I get back from the fungal foray is<br>the people in the department will go oh<br>did you discover any new species and I<br>have to explain that it doesn't quite<br>work like that because you don't usually<br>pick it up and go that's a new species<br>suddenly I'm famous and I've got a<br>nature paper I wouldn't get nature paper<br>with a new species no one cares but the<br>truth is that these discoveries come<br>when you're sitting at home watching<br>Scotland Street and you've got the<br>laptop and some new sequence DNA<br>sequences have come in and suddenly you<br>can match up the collection you made<br>this year with one you might have made<br>in 2005 in ohakuni and another one you<br>might have made in somewhere else and<br>suddenly you realize that the DNA is<br>kind of United them all and that so<br>that's the exciting that's when you go<br>wow we've got something here this is<br>cool so the two parts of how we work out<br>whether we've got a species are we get<br>the DNA sequences and we make sure<br>they're all related to each other on an<br>evolutionary tree so that's this<br>monophially you know be a bit dodgy if<br>we made one species and the two<br>individuals were totally unrelated to<br>each other<br>unfortunately in the olden days before<br>they had DNA sequencing that happened a<br>lot so there's a bit of sort of tidying<br>upwork that we do and the other thing is<br>that you kind of hope that they look the<br>same and the predictive power of the DNA<br>analysis usually brings together<br>specimens that we forgot actually look<br>the same you know there's a blue one<br>with a white cap and suddenly you<br>sequence one and you look at it oh it's<br>got a white cap and it's blue so it all<br>makes sense so it's cool so that's how<br>we do it so one of the exciting<br>discoveries that um was kind of took a<br>little while to make this discovery<br>first one of our students Cecilia won<br>um<br>sequence this specimen here and it<br>turned out to have a different DNA<br>sequence from from the common one which<br>is actually this one at the top right so<br>he gave a talk about that and some of<br>the scientists in the audience<br>afterwards were like she's messed that<br>up you know it's not right you know it's<br>like oh I don't know she's very<br>methodical and she's nice what she's<br>doing so sure enough she was absolutely<br>right they're totally unrelated to each<br>other and in fact over the years since<br>then this really formed part of Andy<br>Nielsen's PhD all of these things are<br>quite unrelated to each other and for a<br>hundred years nobody had noticed that<br>um<br>they all gave him the same name at the<br>bottom left there quaternarius poor for<br>radius and so making a big phylogenetic<br>tree we were able to separate them out<br>quite nicely and it's not really obvious<br>because I've only put the purple pouch<br>fungi as we call them on the tree but<br>this one in the middle on the left here<br>for example it's most close relative is<br>these big brown mushrooms so and they're<br>all like that right so it's not like we<br>split up one purple thing into just to<br>make it annoying for everybody into six<br>different things right these are six<br>totally unrelated things that need to<br>have new names as a result<br>so we've done a bit of that some of them<br>have turned out to be very rare that top<br>left one's only known from the East<br>Harbor regional park near Wellington<br>others like this one on the middle right<br>from North and South Island quite common<br>Etc when we described the middle one on<br>the left there that one it was only<br>known from two collections up in the<br>golden Bay Area<br>and so you know that's something that<br>you couldn't sort of interpret as being<br>fairly rare or at the very least you<br>could say is data deficient we don't<br>really know how you know what to make of<br>the of the commonness of this species<br>so we've got a solution for that I'll<br>just mention that one of the other<br>things that I'm trying to do is to sort<br>of help people out by turning our<br>publications of these new species into<br>Wikipedia pages so you can kind of you<br>know the Public's got a more accessible<br>way of sort of being able to key them<br>out and it's quite easy to do that and<br>quite good fun and whenever I've got an<br>important deadline to do something that<br>I don't want to do I don't do it I just<br>do another Wikipedia page<br>um but one of the problems is that our<br>trips to collect fungi are so few and<br>far between once a year is not enough<br>and you know they come up when they want<br>to come up and if the weather's wrong<br>when you got there then you have to then<br>you won't see it right so what we've<br>done is adopted a technique that was<br>developed in Germany in the late in the<br>1990s where they buried little nylon<br>mesh bags in the soil and filled with<br>acid wash sand and you leave them there<br>for a few months and sure enough these<br>mycorrhea or fungi the fungi we're<br>interested in grow into the bags and the<br>DNA from those bags can often contain up<br>to about 60 percent of the DNA belongs<br>to these fungi we're interested in right<br>so it's actually enriching the sample if<br>you did that for the raw soil it would<br>be much lower fraction of those<br>interesting fungi and so then you get<br>the DNA sequences thanks to the Next<br>Generation sequencing you can sequence<br>everything in the bag we can then<br>compare it with other sequences on<br>genbank the big database and in this<br>case is a real sequence that we've<br>actually managed to match it back to 100<br>identical to one of my dead rat photos<br>so it's cool from the herbarium here so<br>you can pick and you know if you can<br>detect uh covert in Wastewater then<br>you're damn well can detect fungi and<br>soil it's the same sort of idea so they<br>win Laura van Galen came to us<br>um<br>that 2017 18 maybe<br>one of the things that she she came from<br>Tasmania she's now I'm doing a postdoc<br>in Switzerland and he's watching hi<br>Laura<br>when she came to us we said well<br>wouldn't it be cool if we could bury the<br>high falling growth bags all up and down<br>the country in Beach forests and Survey<br>there do they what's really The Wider<br>survey that's ever been done of the<br>environmental DNA of of these fungi that<br>we're interested in and she's such a<br>capable student she's just like yep<br>that's good it's actually buried over 4<br>000 of them she coordinated all the<br>field teams of helpers to do that and<br>every one of those yellow dots<br>represents 10 plots and at each one of<br>those plots there were five high falling<br>growth bags so some of them got dug up<br>by people who thought they were you know<br>the government or whatever but that's<br>fine and so then we sequenced everything<br>in there and I should say Laura's had a<br>lot of ecological analysis of this and<br>that's really her story that I'm not<br>going to tell you about she did find<br>some interesting associations between<br>fungi and their hosts and also fungi and<br>temperature and fungi and nutrients in<br>the soil too if I remember correctly but<br>this one that we this fungus that we<br>only knew from Golden Bay we thought<br>well where's that you know and sure<br>enough it's come up these are yellow<br>dots are where the samples were the red<br>ones are where we detected that fungus<br>and we're basing that detection on the<br>relationships in the DNA tree so you<br>know we can pretty confidently say now<br>that in fact where we thought it was<br>just based up in Golden Bay it's<br>actually down well growing in waipari<br>Falls as well so it's cool<br>as well as that we actually found little<br>clades or groups of sequences for which<br>there was no specimen no dead rat photo<br>it doesn't match anything so there's a<br>species that we know exists but we<br>haven't found it yet so this is giving<br>us a framework for being able to<br>discover things I got the gene 312<br>students last year to sequence some of<br>our samples from now flat which is this<br>place here just about an hour north of<br>Gore not far from Roxborough as the crow<br>flies we found these beautiful little<br>blue colored mushrooms with a brown top<br>we sequenced them we had a look at where<br>they actually came out in our<br>evolutionary tree and they actually we<br>found in the environmental DNA they're<br>dispersed all up and down the country<br>the south island and we also found that<br>it occurs in Tasmania we found a link to<br>a specimen in the herbarium well it's<br>actually in the Melbourne herbarium but<br>it's from Tasmania from a PhD student<br>there so they are currently on the way<br>here in the post and we are pretty sure<br>that this is an undescribed species and<br>we're going to describe it and it'll be<br>a species I'm expecting given the<br>monofila here that it'll be a species<br>that grows in New Zealand and Tasmania<br>so that's kind of how it works<br>um<br>that one that only grows up in the<br>Wellington area East Harbor Regional<br>Park its closest relative is a really<br>rare fungus it smells like rotting fish<br>only collected once from 19 in 1967.<br>nobody actually knows exactly where this<br>kohai bush and it's not the one near<br>Springfield for the 100th time<br>um is it's in the mount gray area we<br>believe it may well be Farmland now so<br>it's a it's the closest relative to this<br>rare thing in the north island so again<br>where did it occur we found it in one of<br>Laura's samples and it's a couple of<br>hundred kilometers away from where we<br>think this other site was and in near<br>the Mount summons car park so there's a<br>destination for a field trip to<br>ReDiscover this rare thing that we<br>didn't know really where it came from so<br>that's pretty exciting we're scraping<br>the bottom of the barrel there because<br>on our DNA barcoding<br>um it's only one base different you know<br>but I still think one nucleotide<br>difference is worth a field trip 100<br>percent<br>and we can you know this emanate a<br>muscaria the red fungus with the white<br>dots that's a bit of an Invader here was<br>introduced into New Zealand on Pine<br>assets spread through the South Island<br>on Pioneers radiator Roots it's quite<br>widespread in Beach forest and it's been<br>known to invade and potentially exclude<br>our native fungi so we can see where it<br>is it's all over the place<br>right and um so Sam lasham has just<br>finished his or finishing his Masters um<br>he took all of this environmental DNA<br>data for this big genus called<br>quaternarius and he tried to work out<br>well how many species actually are there<br>genetically even if we haven't<br>discovered them all yet and believe it<br>or not about 80 were undescribed which<br>is exactly what those people have<br>predicted 30 years ago so amazing<br>all right so there's a lot of work to do<br>but now we have a genetic framework<br>which is called just want to mention<br>that Daniel Monroe who's a great artist<br>from here in Dunedin I think based at<br>Port Chalmers use these fungi as a piece<br>for some stained glass which is in the<br>division of Sciences so I don't think<br>it's actually hanging up anywhere yet<br>but you can bug Richard about Barker<br>about that if you'd like to see it and<br>if enough people do it's stunning so if<br>you do that then that will be kind of<br>exciting<br>so just to sort of finish up sorry<br>um I will um just finish up by some<br>people are wondering well why are there<br>so many of these things that actually<br>look the same that aren't related to<br>each other and in fact there's a whole<br>lot of these fungi that look a bit like<br>mushrooms<br>um but they don't the Caps don't open<br>you know and we call them truffle like<br>fungi sometimes they have big stalks<br>other times they don't really have a<br>stalk at all why are there so many<br>colorful pouch fungi in New Zealand this<br>is a kind of a topic with lots of<br>discussion going on about it in North<br>America and in Australia these<br>truffle-like fungiers they're called<br>other Soul diet for some of the little<br>burrowing marsupials things like that<br>and you know like real truffles which<br>are animal dispersed as well people have<br>sort of considered this idea that that<br>mammals in some of these countries may<br>be dispersing less fungi in New Zealand<br>we don't have the grazing mammals except<br>some of the bats and Dr Ross beaver in<br>the mid-1990s proposed is that because<br>we have so many<br>ground-dwelling birds that sort of<br>replace the role of the mammals here<br>then maybe they are responsible for<br>driving the evolution of these but he<br>did also say in there that it could be<br>other animals as well<br>um one of the things that people have<br>suggested in the literature is that if<br>you're a truffle-like fungus then you<br>one day you wake up and you're in the<br>Poo literally and so um when the spores<br>germinate<br>um then they who are they going to find<br>they're going to find themselves you<br>know another Spore germinating of the<br>same from the same fruit body because<br>the animal ate it<br>on the other hand if you're a mushroom<br>then you're like an umbrella and you've<br>evolved to be able to disperse the<br>spores via the wind you know so they've<br>got a better chance of outcrossing and<br>so people have suggested in the<br>literature that maybe the Truffle light<br>Fundy are in bread<br>um but you know I gave a talk about 20<br>years ago and Bill Lee from landcare<br>asked me why are the mushrooms so<br>colorful and I go I wouldn't have a clue<br>don't know about that you know but then<br>yeah why are there truffles colorful<br>because of bird dispersal you know they<br>like the colors why are the mushrooms so<br>colorful don't they I don't know<br>um but we had this dilemma that's a<br>chicken or the egg thing because if the<br>animal is dispersing the truffles drove<br>them then by how did the first truffle<br>form you know because it didn't have a<br>disperser yet and then it kind of got me<br>wondering if maybe the animals are<br>eating the mushrooms too which they do<br>they're a good food source in the forest<br>then maybe some of those that tend to be<br>favored by animals maybe then kind of<br>um<br>tend to just keep getting eaten and say<br>they'll tend to become more inbred the<br>other thing is that in some mushrooms<br>there's been a study that showed that in<br>mushrooms that are self-compatible they<br>can mate with themselves if they<br>continually inbreed them and you know<br>what they start to do they start to<br>mutate and not really form proper<br>mushrooms and guess what they look like<br>a truffle like fungi right so I think<br>that kind of gets us out of the chicken<br>or the egg Loop by thinking well maybe<br>it started by consumption of mushrooms<br>by some sort of animal leading to the<br>evolution of the new species so um our<br>Marsden isn't really I'm trying to<br>untangle the question of how it all<br>happened in the first place but looking<br>at the genetic consequences of this and<br>I don't want to bore you with any of<br>that because it's been really hard<br>actually to okay<br>um<br>so I just want to leave you with this<br>message that these fungi are crucial for<br>our forest our beach Forest because if<br>you plant a beet seedling in a pot it<br>won't grow unless the the fungi the<br>fungi are present that can form these<br>associations in the root but beach trees<br>need to move around the country you know<br>in the last ice age people think that<br>all of the odd lamb was covered with ice<br>so there's no Forest there right only 15<br>000 years ago so people have wondered<br>well where the hell did all the Beet<br>trees come that cover fjordland now did<br>they come from the further north did<br>they hang around Dunedin or the catlins<br>and then move across after the climate<br>started to warm up I was lucky enough to<br>be involved in a project with Nick<br>Rollins and several students including<br>Ben Potter there John Waters Michelle<br>Knapp from anatomy and we did some<br>genetic testing on the silver Beech<br>trees and we found that those ones in<br>the southern south island are<br>genetically isolated from the ones in<br>the northern in the northern South<br>Island and so that does give a<br>suggestion that it's most likely that<br>fjordland was recolonized by the trees<br>that were hanging around near the coast<br>right in the last ice age<br>but the trees can't move without the<br>fungi all right and I've just told you<br>about the fungi needing to move some of<br>them need potentially need animals to<br>move if they're being dispersed by the<br>the the animals that are eating them<br>um and it's actually already been<br>suggested in the literature by others<br>that that is likely to be a three-way<br>relationship between the trees need the<br>fungi the fun you need the animals to<br>disperse them in the and the animals are<br>eating the fungi spreading helping the<br>fungi death spread which then helps that<br>provides the inoculum for the trees to<br>spread there's actually a parallel with<br>Wilding Pines and scientists at<br>Canterbury University showed that<br>introduce like possums and deer spread<br>the fungi that help the Wilding Pines to<br>spread so it could be good on the native<br>side and bad on the introduce side so<br>just um one of our students Tracy<br>McGovern is just finishing up her<br>Masters now she went up to oracanui and<br>they've been very grateful and we've<br>been really grateful that they've<br>allowed us to sample the poo of the<br>takahea that are up there and what JC<br>did when she did a postgrad diploma of<br>Sciences she tried to culture the fungi<br>out of there and believe it or not she<br>cultured mushrooms these things you know<br>so those takahe are around there<br>potentially eating whether it's<br>deliberately or not the spores on the<br>grass or deliberately picking off the<br>mushrooms and they're coming out in the<br>poo and they're viable and so so that so<br>that's evidence that these birds can<br>disperse some fungi that's actually a<br>wood rotting fungus but when we did the<br>DNA analysis of some of these drug<br>samples we also found DNA for<br>mycorrhizal fungi the fungi that are<br>growing on the eucalyptus trees up there<br>at oracanui so she's gone back now and<br>done a much more thorough study which<br>he's just sequencing all the results for<br>now so I just want to leave you with<br>this idea that<br>um<br>that<br>we're discovering the species of fungi<br>that are out there we've got the ability<br>to map them now we're interested in<br>understanding what the relationship is<br>between the the host of these fungi and<br>the and the fungi themselves some fungi<br>may be able to blow from the south<br>island up to the north island and back<br>again but others may not be able to so<br>we haven't really looked for patterns<br>there and we're interested in in<br>potential disperses of these things as<br>well so the take-home messages are for<br>the couple of people that aren't on eye<br>naturalist to sign up for it he is a<br>good license so you're sharing your<br>photographs if you like fungi then<br>embrace it and geek out and join<br>Facebook<br>our trees our fungi and our animals are<br>interconnected through space and time<br>okay they're all part of the important<br>part of the the picture there and the<br>fact is a lot of the animals that may<br>have evolved with our trees and our<br>fungi are extinct now so that's kind of<br>sad but I think that maybe is part of<br>the story there's a lot to discover in<br>terms of fungi and that means that when<br>you email me tomorrow with a photo of a<br>mushroom you found in the backyard and I<br>don't know what it is then it's not my<br>fault okay remember 80 unknown okay and<br>if you really enjoyed this and for those<br>of you that can come and study botany<br>and for those of you that just would<br>like a week away then come and join the<br>New Zealand fungal foray next year so<br>I'll just finish by thanking everybody<br>thanking my family thanking my<br>colleagues in botany and elsewhere in<br>the university and everywhere<br>um and most importantly thanking all the<br>students because I'm just the of coming<br>in with the enthusiasm and they're all<br>doing the hard work so<br>um yeah it's been quite a privilege and<br>thank you for uh to the university for<br>the honor and the privilege to be able<br>to Rave on for an hour like I have<br>thanks very much<br>uh firstly who are you oh call Matt luck<br>I'm a ho<br>uh<br>I was going to say firstly ten akoi<br>olivich so can we give it another round<br>um David it was a real honor to be asked<br>to come and say a few words on the<br>behalf of the botany department and<br>respond to your talk<br>um and I think everyone here will agree<br>that it's really easy to see why David's<br>been so successful in promoting the<br>importance of understanding fungal<br>diversity<br>is enthusiasm and obvious passion for<br>his science<br>is really inspiring<br>and it's contagious<br>and I myself haven't actually been<br>immune to that<br>when I arrived here in 2016 as a postdoc<br>studying forest trees I had no real<br>interest at all in fungi<br>but now after seven years working and<br>collaborating with David I can't walk<br>into a forest without thinking about<br>what species of mycorrhizal fungi are<br>tapping into the roots beneath below the<br>soil and actually my best<br>uh research outputs are now on the<br>fungal diversity of our forests so thank<br>you for opening my eyes<br>but I think for me one of the most<br>important aspects of David's research is<br>that it really highlights the critical<br>importance of taxonomy as a discipline<br>and taxonomy tends to get a bit of a bad<br>rap it's not the sexiest of the Sciences<br>um but it is critically important<br>because it provides the basis<br>for the for the for what which<br>um the rest of biology depends<br>okay and David I think you've shown uh<br>multiple times now and it did certainly<br>show tonight<br>um that by continuing to to catalog that<br>diversity and<br>um<br>even in these cryptic organisms it<br>really gives us new insights into the<br>ecology and evolution and the<br>conservation of our biology<br>so I think I think we owe you a<br>gratitude for maintaining the the cause<br>but you're more than just a researcher<br>like all good professors probably are I<br>think<br>um you're an inspirational teacher a<br>passionate science communicator and a<br>leader it's it's not an exaggeration to<br>say that students universally Love David<br>and I think that's demonstrated here<br>with so many of them in the audience<br>tonight<br>um David's been as Richard said David's<br>been nominated for multiple<br>undergraduate teaching Awards<br>um he's supervised over 60 postgraduate<br>students and been recognized for<br>excellence in his postgraduate<br>supervision<br>David also has probably the hardest<br>thing that he's done in his career I<br>suspect is uh be the head of the botany<br>department for the last six years<br>but he's managed to develop an inclusive<br>and a vibrant<br>departmental culture<br>for example I don't think there are many<br>Christmas parties where you go out to<br>the pub and the hit the hod and other<br>senior academics like Paul guy are both<br>in the band<br>I mean they're actually pretty good<br>and pretty much the whole Department's<br>on the Dance Floor by the end of the<br>night<br>so<br>I'm glad that's the only story you're<br>told<br>so uh he's also navigated the department<br>through some of the most challenging<br>periods of our time<br>and I think it is personal attributes<br>that that have made him such a<br>successful leader through those<br>difficult times<br>um despite his obvious brilliance<br>David is<br>always humble he's always personable<br>he's unassuming he puts people first and<br>he he leads with compassion and in fact<br>I think that this University would be a<br>better place if there were more people<br>like you around David<br>um without further Ado I'd like to thank<br>you<br>on behalf of the Department of Botany<br>and myself<br>congratulations Professor alvich thank<br>here's a small gift thank you yeah great<br>and I just needed to extend<br>um a welcome to everyone over to the<br>staff club for drinks and thank you all<br>for coming along it's a great turnout<br>yeah thanks very much<br>foreign</p></main><footer style="margin-top: 2rem; background: #0001; padding: 2rem; text-align: center;"><p>We Are The University</p><ul style="list-style-type: none; padding: 0; margin:
