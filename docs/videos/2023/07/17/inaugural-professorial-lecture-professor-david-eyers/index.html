professorial<br>lecture<br>tune<br>to the house that stands here<br>greetings may you stand forever but if<br>there's some doubt about that and there<br>might be some shaking or an emergency<br>please follow instructions of people<br>involved note with your exits are and<br>to those that have passed we remember<br>you may you pass into darkness<br>particularly we remember you at this<br>so greetings everyone who am I my name<br>is Richard Blakey I'm Deputy Vice<br>Chancellor for research and Enterprise<br>here at the University of otago and I'm<br>your MC tonight I bring apologies from<br>our acting Vice Chancellor Helen<br>Nicholson who would love to have been<br>by background and I and I work here at<br>the University I did use I think<br>probably a little bit without permission<br>our new uh our new<br>um name Marley name<br>otako faka ifuwaka which um I think<br>David you should take pride you are the<br>first IPL<br>in after this name has been officially<br>endorsed by a university Council this<br>afternoon it's a very historic day for<br>the University to have approved for um<br>for roll out from May 2024 but the<br>university Council agreed to today to<br>approve a brand and identity project<br>that incorporates and the accepting of<br>the gift from Nana fenua of the new name<br>otakufaka ihuwaka which translates otako<br>is the regional name but talks about the<br>the harbor and the um the currents that<br>flow in and out you talks about the<br>the bow of the Waka that pierces the<br>ways first and this being a a place of<br>many firsts including us being the first<br>University<br>um is a is a name that we accept with<br>pride for research it is also important<br>to know that research is that is at the<br>front of the Walker that pushes forward<br>the waves and allows others to follow<br>um<br>so welcome to you all<br>um<br>to the important people in our academic<br>party Professor Barker PVC Sciences<br>welcome Dr Mills here Department welcome<br>and particularly to David uh welcome for<br>this auspicious occasion we're really<br>pleased to also welcome members of the<br>university community members of the<br>public of uh city of Dunedin members of<br>uh from wider and further afield<br>particularly those who are joining us<br>online in real time or or through the<br>recording of This that will go up on<br>YouTube at some point and in particular<br>warm greetings to your special visitors<br>here today your parents Michael and<br>Kerry<br>tinakorua your wife Giselle and your son<br>Robbie who are here I hope you have a<br>great time and to those in your family<br>and friend groups who are joining us<br>online<br>um<br>before David talks uh Professor Barker<br>will give a more detailed introduction<br>but I'll just emphasize to you all here<br>today the importance that we place on<br>inaugural professorial lectures we get<br>dressed up for the occasion it's an<br>academic occasion to be celebrated<br>because promotion or appointment to the<br>professor at the University of otago is<br>a big deal we do ask a lot of our<br>professors and we do measure when people<br>apply for promotion to that rank those<br>applications against some stringent<br>criteria of requiring significant<br>leadership and competence against<br>teaching research and service and in<br>particular I want to acknowledge your<br>leadership David and the things that<br>I've very much appreciated is what I<br>would call leadership through<br>partnership that you demonstrate in your<br>research I I note your your research<br>supervisions are very very normally no<br>more than 60 percent to any one<br>individual you work with teams very well<br>and in terms of your service in<br>particular you you have contributed very<br>strongly to The e-research Advisory<br>Group to National leadership through the<br>national e-science infrastructure and<br>sitting on site on our I.T governance<br>board you provide great leadership and<br>it's a very collaborative set of<br>leadership that you provide before I<br>hand over to Richard Barker though I do<br>want to identify that it's great for me<br>to be here because we also share a lot<br>in common gender we share one alma mater<br>I I think we started here at the<br>University of otago in the same year but<br>also we're members of an esteemed<br>professional body the institution of<br>electrical electronic Engineers the IEEE<br>and that means the electrical and<br>electronic Engineers are a very special<br>breed because you cannot spell geek<br>without EE and so we are I'm really<br>looking forward to hearing what you have<br>to say so on behalf of the University<br>David congratulations please join me in<br>congratulating David on this<br>well-deserved promotion as I invite<br>Professor Barker up to give you a more<br>detailed introduction so well done<br>Professor Mills dinar friends and<br>colleagues tenakoto tenakoto tenakoto<br>katoa it is my great pleasure to<br>introduce our speaker tonight Professor<br>David Ayers<br>who comes from the soon to be extinct<br>Department of computer science to give<br>his inaugural professorial lecture at<br>the University of otago for those who<br>are not in the know about that<br>mysterious reference our University<br>Council in kyota to one of our<br>councilors present with us today<br>endorsed our proposal to merge the<br>Departments of computer science and<br>information science at the University of<br>otago hence the impending Extinction of<br>computer science as a department<br>as indicated by Professor Blakey David<br>was promoted to Professor in February of<br>this year and tonight we celebrate this<br>significant achievement<br>David was born in London and according<br>to the information that he gave me he<br>says he then moved back to Australia<br>which hints at some kind of pre-life<br>he was brought up in Sydney and I just<br>discovered and and the Beautiful<br>environs of Bondi Junction an area that<br>I spent a little bit of time growing up<br>in as well a delightful area and it was<br>in Sydney that he went to school or<br>school as they say over there and then<br>on to the University of New South Wales<br>where he graduated with a combined<br>first-class honors in engineering and<br>science majoring in computer engineering<br>dishonest degree led him back to the<br>land of his birth where he completed a<br>PhD at the University of Cambridge<br>graduating in 2006.<br>a member of King's College he was their<br>I.T consultant and webmaster during this<br>time<br>his PhD Was Then followed by a sequence<br>of research fellow appointments in the<br>University of Cambridge computer<br>laboratory that filled the intervening<br>years before he was appointed to take up<br>a position of lecturer in our department<br>of computer science<br>this lecture ship was taken up in 2011<br>so David's rise through the ranks from<br>lecturer to full Professor have taken<br>just 11 years which has been rapid<br>and really is a measure of his all-round<br>excellence<br>as we have heard from Professor Blakey<br>promotion to full professor at the<br>University of otago is far from Easy you<br>must excel in all of the academic<br>domains of teaching research and service<br>it cannot be any weaknesses and<br>Professor Ayers has truly excelled<br>David's research is measured by its<br>impact and by the regard of his peers<br>and here I'm going to draw heavily on<br>referee statements<br>to support in support of his application<br>to make this point these highlight that<br>he is a highly respected and significant<br>scholar particularly known for his work<br>in distributed systems<br>this work is highly cited with eight of<br>his published Publications receiving<br>more than 100 citations<br>many published papers and Academia sadly<br>to say don't get any so 100 is truly<br>spectacular<br>that we also saw or heard that his work<br>on operating system security has been<br>influential in the highly topical field<br>of security breaches which is of great<br>interest to us today<br>his safe web system was deployed to<br>protect databases within a cancer cancer<br>registry of the UK National Health<br>Services<br>we read that he was awarded an a rating<br>in the 2018 performance-based research<br>funding evaluation exercise which ranks<br>him amongst the best computer scientists<br>in this country<br>that as a research leader his wide<br>knowledge of computer science research<br>has allowed him to contribute to<br>research projects across a large number<br>of disciplines in ways that have enabled<br>many projects that otherwise might not<br>have been successful<br>David is also an excellent teacher and<br>for this introduction I decided to<br>follow the strategy of reading what<br>others have said about him and this time<br>I've chosen the words of his students<br>quote out of my two years at otago David<br>is easily the best lecturer I've ever<br>had he's concise but explains things<br>with a real enthusiasm for the content<br>he is teaching<br>David is a fantastic teacher he is very<br>quick to respond with a great reply on<br>emails<br>David's the best that was in caps so<br>that's for emphasis<br>so helpful when you need it<br>and you can tell he's genuinely<br>interested in the topics and my favorite<br>because I learned a new word<br>the only verbal chain gun I've ever<br>known<br>who can keep me interested for 50<br>minutes in a row extremely knowledgeable<br>extremely hopeful extremely nice guy<br>thanks David<br>in addition to providing an enjoyable<br>and entertaining experience for his<br>students David has also been a<br>curriculum innovator an illustration of<br>this is his software carpentry's<br>incubator work on use of Docker for<br>reproducible research which was the<br>featured incubator lesson in February<br>2021<br>software carpentries is a worldwide<br>organization sponsored by 70<br>universities and has recognition as one<br>of the worldwide instructors is<br>significant<br>in service to the professional community<br>Professor Ayers has been a member of the<br>board of directors for the New Zealand<br>e-science Institute<br>appointed because of his expertise in<br>e-research he's been actively involved<br>with strategic planning for rianne's the<br>research and education Advanced Network<br>New Zealand a high-capacity Ultra<br>high-speed National research and<br>education Network connecting New<br>Zealand's tertiary educations research<br>organizations libraries schools museums<br>to the rest of the world<br>his on the advisory Boards of the cyber<br>security research program and the<br>science for Technology Innovation<br>National Science challenge veracity lab<br>and was invited into their science<br>leaders program<br>he's been active in conference<br>leadership as co-chair of 2017's IEEE<br>conference on cloud engineering<br>and another major<br>ACM d e b s Congress in 2018 and was has<br>been on the program committees for more<br>than 120 conferences<br>in addition to this David is an<br>excellent University citizen<br>for the University he has chaired the<br>eras e-research Advisory Group since<br>2012. he has chaired the I.T portfolio<br>change Advisory Board since 2022 he's on<br>the project steering committee for cyber<br>security and for the otago digital<br>workspace and has been a member of the<br>otago research Information Systems<br>reference group<br>is active on the steering groups of<br>catchments otago and the otago Energy<br>Research Center and the last one I'll<br>mention which Professor Blake is already<br>referred to as David as a member of the<br>I.T governance board and that just<br>happens to be board that I chair and<br>from the chair seat I get to witness it<br>firsthand the enthusiasm engagement and<br>Enlightenment that David brings to all<br>of these activities<br>I think you've heard enough from me it's<br>now time to hear from Professor Ayers<br>himself and we're going to hear<br>firsthand about the interests and<br>enthusiasms that have led to this<br>celebration tonight please join me in<br>Dennis<br>it's an absolute pleasure to be here<br>thank you for the detailed introductions<br>which give us a good context of where<br>we're going next I'm just going to click<br>this thing and see where we go full<br>screen that will make me be able to see<br>it slightly better than what we had<br>before<br>um sorry we've got a technical glitch<br>here I'm on the wrong screen this is not<br>going to be that's better thank you that<br>was fixed by Magic so I figured that for<br>tonight with respect to technology risks<br>the way I was going to avoid any<br>failures was to print out my<br>presentation so because it's on paper I<br>don't need to rely on any of this<br>technology working for the whole 45<br>minutes however so far we're blowing the<br>central projector which is why we're<br>using the two side screens but<br>thankfully we have lots of fine ID<br>equipment in the university and so we<br>have these backups available to us but<br>again thank you for the introduction to<br>start this kind of event one might be<br>worried about the quality of one's<br>presentation materials and so something<br>I've considered thoughts about whether<br>or not there are errors on these slides<br>but of course to begin with well we do<br>have one which has already been alluded<br>to and that is that the department is<br>wrong because it's going to be made<br>extinct however this is a very promising<br>transition this is a time where we<br>actually get to combine multiple<br>departments who have a focus on<br>Computing at the University of otago and<br>grow into something which is bigger that<br>will have more reach going forwards in<br>the future so I might just clean that up<br>slightly and hopefully it's okay to<br>so this is an absolute pleasure for me<br>and I will move on to the actual<br>material that's not just about the title<br>page which is pretty good going because<br>we've already lost a minute or two<br>I've attended many ipls in my time at<br>the University<br>and as those ipls have rolled past I<br>have to admit my thoughts had actually<br>turned increasingly to the fact that I<br>might actually be here<br>and at first I had this kind of warm<br>feeling that by the time I was going to<br>stand in front of you I would have a<br>really clear research agenda and it was<br>completely obvious where my research was<br>going to go next<br>time passed and we got closer to the<br>night here this evening and I started to<br>have an increased level of panic that<br>actually there was just this gigantic<br>range of different things that I was<br>trying to juggle and that it wasn't<br>entirely clear where this sort of<br>research agenda was going to wind up<br>however in preparing for the IPL I<br>realized there are actually some running<br>themes in my research so there you go<br>preparation for these IPL events can<br>help you focus on your work but I must<br>say slightly nerve-wracking way to do so<br>however in talking about the trajectory<br>that I'm going to discuss this evening I<br>am taking one particular pass through<br>the work that I have had now this word<br>cloud in a cloud that I generated on the<br>cloud<br>is actually a set of all of the things<br>I'm not going to talk about this evening<br>so these topics are things where I have<br>taken extracts from titles of papers or<br>projects or general<br>um involvements that I've had with other<br>people and I'm very well aware that in<br>talking about the particular trajectory<br>this evening I'm not going to be talking<br>about a whole bunch of other Journeys<br>and so thinking about that I kind of<br>considered well that's partly why<br>tonight I'm not going to be naming a lot<br>of names in the course of the work that<br>I've done because to sort of focus on<br>naming some is going to end up feeling<br>like I'm neglecting so many others<br>everyone I've collaborated with on this<br>extraordinary range of projects I've had<br>the privilege to work with has been<br>extremely important as an influence on<br>me and I thank you all for all the<br>a Prelude<br>and this is slightly interesting Prelude<br>because I'm not 100 sure that all the<br>transitions are going to work smoothly<br>but like I said I've got my paper so it<br>should be okay how I came to have my<br>head in the clouds in the first place<br>so I will give a warning right now<br>particularly given you have this dual<br>sort of screen display that there is<br>going to be a lot of motion that's about<br>to get kicked off on these screens so if<br>you don't like motion avert your eyes<br>now<br>this completely gratuitous slide to<br>transition represents something which<br>I'm going to take you on a journey<br>around that involves<br>heads in clouds that transition<br>represents a kind of random construction<br>of a move from one picture to another<br>and there was someone I know who would<br>have found that transition absolutely<br>fantastic namely me because<br>I had at early days in primary school<br>this desire to program<br>this sort of random dot transition that<br>takes you from one picture to another I<br>wanted to just do one dot after the<br>other eventually it all accumulates and<br>you get a complete transition<br>and I knew basic the programming<br>language and I at the time thought that<br>I just needed time I found some<br>subsequent notes that actually show my<br>working trying to kind of determine how<br>to do this transition from one kind of<br>pattern to another programming this in<br>basic meanwhile the handball tournaments<br>and learning to spell were passing me by<br>and were things I would have to catch up<br>on later<br>you also notice that there's a little<br>bit of the engineering tendency that is<br>uh contained within this sort of picture<br>and I'm very pleased that I've passed<br>that on to my son it seems and I<br>apologize Giselle to you<br>um<br>what I will try to do now though is take<br>you a little bit<br>um if I can into my shoes as they were<br>there we go<br>so first of all I need to do a little<br>bit of tweaking that stuff is too high<br>resolution to be the actual Apple 2E so<br>these kind oops I'm not going to do that<br>multiple times this machine one of the<br>things I love about it is it is so<br>immediately accessible<br>it only has uppercase so apologies for<br>the shouty look of all of the<br>presentation of material we're going to<br>see here but what I'm going to do for<br>you is just cheat and load up something<br>which I've prepared earlier<br>this is an example of a program that I<br>would have known wouldn't have done what<br>I wanted but I'll guide you through<br>what's happening with this program<br>before we do that I'm going to have to<br>transition and just give you a little<br>bit of a passing shower of graphics and<br>maths that will kind of complete this<br>if you're going to draw dots on a screen<br>on these computer programs they're<br>numbered using rows and columns but of<br>course you can also number the dots<br>continuously across the rows and columns<br>so in this case what I'm showing you is<br>the low resolution Graphics mode as it<br>was called on the Apple 2E which means<br>for its time it has to be super low<br>resolution these days that has only 40<br>columns and so you can see that the<br>beginning of the next row numbers from<br>Pixel number 40 if you want to keep<br>counting and reading order<br>so that's important in terms of how this<br>program currently Works what is it doing<br>well I'm changing to the low resolution<br>Graphics mode in line 10 picking a color<br>I've got this variable called a that's<br>going to be the dot that I'm going to<br>change so I'm going to build this<br>program that changes from one thing to<br>another the number of squares I need to<br>cover is in the variable named NS long<br>variable names are good these days but<br>back here you didn't have a backspace<br>function so you use short variable names<br>for reasons it will become clear I'm<br>storing the next prime number above 800<br>and then between lines 60 and 130 I'm<br>doing a loop over all of the squares<br>that I might want to pick<br>we'll have a look here at line 70. what<br>line 70 does is this picks a random<br>number from zero to the number of<br>squares so I'm just going to pick one<br>dot after another to do our transition<br>lines 80 and 90 do corrections that we<br>don't need yet but I'll lead you through<br>that when we get there lines 100 and 110<br>convert that number dot into a row and<br>column location that we can plot but the<br>program is not going to do what I would<br>actually want also I'm only doing the<br>top half of the screen because these<br>things are so slow you don't want to<br>have to wait for this to finish and so<br>we don't need to<br>this is eventually going to not complete<br>this Square because of the fact it's got<br>this repeating pattern of random numbers<br>you'll get repetitions of those numbers<br>so it's not going to pick all of the<br>numbers you leave it running forever<br>that would be tremendously boring so<br>let's not do that let's stop this<br>program and apologies for the flashing<br>and let's go and get a little bit more<br>maths<br>so I'm going to introduce you very<br>briefly to the integer group modulo N<br>and you know again I'm supposed to be an<br>engineer so I'm probably stepping out of<br>my uh kind of area of complete daily<br>work but I think that we can agree we<br>all actually understand how to work in<br>the integer group modulo 7 through the<br>illustration I'm showing here if you say<br>it's Tuesday and I believe it is Tuesday<br>although it's been a bit of a blur<br>recently<br>you're going to sign Tuesday to be a one<br>and that's showing on the kind of<br>cyclical diagram on the right hand side<br>of the slide if I tell it to add nine<br>days well that's going to be a week and<br>two days so we move to Thursday now<br>you've wrapped around the numbers so<br>you've gone beyond the maximum count of<br>six but you make a correction to oops<br>sorry a correction to that number I've<br>got a gesture over here a correction to<br>that number that means that you end up<br>discovering that you've come back to the<br>number three<br>so this is something where it turns out<br>what we would actually like is a<br>generator of this group and so sometime<br>after primary school because I'm not<br>Euler and I didn't derive this from<br>first principles sometime after primary<br>school I discovered that this was<br>actually what I was after a generator<br>that would mean that you would end up<br>filling in all the different<br>possibilities of this set of numbers an<br>easy one for the days of the week is<br>what's the next day you keep doing that<br>you go around all the days of the week<br>but because 7 is a prime number you can<br>actually pick any step and if you go<br>Monday Wednesday Saturday and you skip<br>twos you'll actually complete all the<br>numbers as well so we're getting closer<br>let's try how this goes I'm going to<br>just say rather than picking a random<br>number I'm going to add some kind of<br>number like so<br>we're getting closer to what I would<br>want this is going to actually complete<br>all of the dots transitioning from one<br>thing to another but the problem is it<br>doesn't really look very random in fact<br>it looks really not random whether or<br>not it's aesthetically pleasing and I've<br>used up my credit for pronouncing that<br>word tonight whether or not that's the<br>case is up to your opinion but it is<br>going to complete all the dots in the<br>required time however there is another<br>piece of maths that we can use which is<br>that<br>you can also find generators that work<br>in multiplicative groups and what we'd<br>like to find is a generator for a<br>multiplicative group that gives you this<br>property of touching all of the<br>different days of the week if you like<br>than in our program here and it turns<br>out we can do that very simply if we<br>list them that's not going to work if we<br>list the program we need to remember how<br>to operate this thing if we list the<br>program what we can do is simply change<br>line 70 now to be that the new a is<br>equal to the old a oops no backspace the<br>old a times two that's not going to work<br>times two it's actually surprisingly<br>hard to type under this pressure now<br>behold<br>this function will touch all of these<br>dots and it will produce exactly what I<br>would have wanted in that Primary School<br>example eventually it still takes a<br>while because it's grinding through the<br>maths but we've found a generator that<br>works to produce all the different<br>numbers that fit within the prime number<br>set that covers the number of dots that<br>we need to actually complete this Square<br>so that's all well and good and clearly<br>I need to keep talking because otherwise<br>you might not believe me there's<br>actually going to finish but it should<br>actually finish soon except for the top<br>left dot because multiplication by zero<br>is a different case but I'm I have<br>enough typing ability here to be able to<br>fix that one just by completing our plot<br>there we go done right now thank you<br>thank you<br>what was the relevance of that you might<br>ask<br>I'm going to say there's two points of<br>relevance first of all<br>which numbers are generators of the<br>multiplicative modular arithmetic group<br>is actually hard to find and it connects<br>to cryptography so you know how many<br>generators there are because that's<br>results we have for mathematics for<br>which ones are generators is not<br>necessarily easy to find out so I knew<br>two because I tested it and two is the<br>first thing I tested which happened to<br>be a generator so that was good but this<br>is crucial for cryptography and that is<br>crucial for cloud computing because<br>cloud computing is always not where you<br>are therefore you need a link that goes<br>over an untrusted connection between you<br>and the cloud and so all of the data<br>needs to be encrypted people don't<br>remember this so much anymore because<br>it's very easy to do encryption but it<br>is a fundamental building block less<br>tenuously is the fact that I am showing<br>you an apple 2E operating on a MacBook<br>Pro so this is clearly not an apple to<br>me it's a lot lighter and smaller has<br>more colors on its display the point is<br>that we can take something that used to<br>be a piece of hardware and turn it into<br>a piece of software and that's crucial<br>so let me take you on a journey through<br>the lightning tour of computer security<br>and we'll also kind of bring up cloud<br>computing as we go<br>2001 this is the year we'll return to<br>for a number of reasons embracing<br>Information Technology there largely<br>involved steadily filling machine rooms<br>with computers<br>if you wanted to isolate two different<br>database systems the easiest way to do<br>it was to have two physical servers<br>air gap security so in other words you<br>have your database for your student<br>records management system your database<br>for your Finance system they're on<br>separate physical machines so if you<br>want to isolate more stuff you just buy<br>more Hardware<br>this was a time when e-commerce was<br>still a thing as opposed to just being<br>like Commerce which it is now<br>the problem is that the hardware is<br>often highly underutilized so those two<br>separate physical machines often going<br>to be operating at say 10 of their<br>maximum CPU use this is a huge waste of<br>resources because power wise computers<br>typically work here switch them on and<br>they start using an amount of energy<br>this is an amount of energy by the way<br>that gesture and if they get really busy<br>they use more energy and then if they<br>get less busy again they go down to a<br>sort of lower level of energy the point<br>is that you've got this base load and a<br>variable load that have to add together<br>in terms of what that computer is using<br>with energy now these numbers are<br>basically wrong now but they were right<br>at some point in time<br>there's more types of resources that get<br>wasted here with respect to this kind of<br>duplication of Hardware you're wasting<br>the energy to get these computers on<br>that aren't doing anything you're<br>wasting the equipment because you've got<br>multiple computers when you shouldn't<br>need that you're even wasting the<br>physical space I mean in general it's<br>just not a good way to work<br>virtualization enables cloud computing<br>so the key point is that my Mac can<br>pretend to be an apple 2E it does a<br>pretty good job<br>so the hardware in the Apple 2E is being<br>simulated by my Mac in software so we<br>take the physical computers and we make<br>them virtual this is the term<br>virtualization that process so what<br>cloud computing does for us is<br>virtualization at massive scale so<br>that's how it gets these economies of of<br>scale and the efficiency gains but<br>what's also important is that it's not<br>just enough to have virtualization work<br>for the cloud you also need security<br>what needs to happen is the cloud<br>service providers need to insulate<br>themselves from their clients and that's<br>because the clients need to be insulated<br>from each other<br>so Xeno servers near tourings rooms<br>around 2001 that was the time that I was<br>having the privilege of being able to<br>take happy snaps like this picture of<br>King's College uh over in Cambridge I'd<br>started my PhD and at that time the<br>University of Cambridge systems research<br>group were working on a thing called<br>Xeno servers so they're proposing this<br>system they can execute code supplied by<br>an untrusted User it's a security angle<br>and they can charge this user for the<br>resources consumed by the computations<br>that they're using so this is from a<br>1999 paper but you know sometimes it<br>takes a while to kind of build all the<br>software stuff so by 2001 they were<br>starting to have real impact with this<br>and what ended up happening was they<br>built a software system for supporting<br>the virtualization at high efficiency<br>and this has got to be an academic talk<br>because I've got a happy snap of King's<br>College and then a happy snap of great<br>research results from someone else's<br>research papers in the middle here but<br>what you see in these bars is that the<br>second bar from the black bar in each<br>one of those groups is the performance<br>of this so-called Zen hypervisor and<br>what you notice is it's very close to<br>the black bar the middle one is where it<br>does worse it's about 10 lower than the<br>black bar the other bars represent<br>things like the leading commercial<br>solution at the time and so you can see<br>particularly from the database workload<br>in the center the Zen hypervisor is<br>absolutely blasting away the competition<br>in terms of how efficiently it works and<br>it happened to be this great combination<br>of PhD research that came together to<br>make this at a perfect academic project<br>that had real academic and Industry<br>impact it kind of slightly passed me by<br>because I knew the people involved but I<br>was kind of looking at other things<br>although I did kind of get involved<br>peripherally with what was happening<br>with respect to Zen what was interesting<br>though is from the Zen system it was<br>noticed in terms of its impact by<br>another player namely this one so it<br>turns out that Amazon when they started<br>their cloud Computing platform actually<br>used cambridge's Zen hypervisor as the<br>way of launching the cloud so I really<br>ended up being down the corridor from<br>where the cloud actually started<br>Cloud virtualization is done by these<br>things called hypervisors and Zen is one<br>which was developed by that Cambridge<br>team but virtualization is interesting<br>because of the fact it supports security<br>so you can run this untrusted code<br>inside a virtual machine and you add<br>this extra slice of software protection<br>to make this work so here we have two<br>slightly dodgy looking clipart servers<br>running at the bottom as the hardware on<br>which we're running two operating<br>systems these separate physical machines<br>Linux and windows because virtualizing<br>Mac OS is possible but weird because of<br>Licensing and then you've got some<br>applications that run over the top of<br>that on server one and server two so<br>what we do this is just the case of a<br>two to one kind of factor we can<br>transition to a world where we slide in<br>the hypervisor between the hardware and<br>the operating systems and we can now<br>contain in these gray regions these<br>virtual machines<br>so the hypervisors in provided this<br>layer of protection but virtualization<br>actually isn't a new thing it's been in<br>IBM Mainframe since the 1960s it's been<br>around for a very long time I often joke<br>with students that one of the best ways<br>of picking the next huge thing that's<br>going to happen in Computing is you look<br>back 10 or 20 or 30 years find something<br>give it a new name and then bang you've<br>got the next big thing but that is<br>partly true because there are things in<br>cycles that change between<br>decentralization and centralization that<br>swing forwards and backwards with a<br>slightly different context but in this<br>case what was key was that the Zen<br>system was very fast with open source<br>and free and it put virtualization on<br>commodity equipment<br>however the cloud also has to track<br>resource use and this connects to sort<br>of one of the other Journeys that I've<br>been able to go on which has been really<br>interesting which is a lot of mileage<br>left which is tracking the provenance of<br>data so provenance described the origin<br>of data and if you think about it in<br>terms of art history it describes where<br>a piece of Arts come from you know who's<br>hence it's passed through that kind of<br>information provenance can enrich data<br>with context and semantics and that's<br>also true within computer science<br>contexts as well so two cases where you<br>come across use of provenance in<br>particular one is reproducible<br>computation so if you've got a climate<br>model that says everything is just fine<br>then you want to know how on Earth it<br>came up with that answer because it's<br>probably wrong so how do you track that<br>through provenance systems can kind of<br>give you an idea of where the<br>computation came from another example is<br>explaining bugs in software when<br>something goes wrong what happened how<br>do you figure out what that was that was<br>wrong and how do you fix it<br>this is important for security because<br>bugs in software you often have a kind<br>of security effect as well so this is<br>one of the Crossovers there there's an<br>emerging area which I'm really Keen to<br>look at more but which is only very<br>early days which is also looking at<br>labeling data for our indigenous data<br>sovereignty considerations so that's<br>going to be going forward it's very<br>interesting in terms of a national<br>impact of where Providence research can<br>go<br>so the research study that I've had the<br>privilege to share is in a topic called<br>whole system Providence where you<br>basically get a computer system to<br>explain everything that it's doing and<br>this was something where we we got to<br>make some several early results in this<br>space the challenge there is to avoid<br>getting flooded with irrelevant noise<br>because computers do billions of things<br>a second so if you get a record of<br>everything that's happening you can<br>easily flood yourself and another<br>admission I've got to make on this slide<br>I collect bugs software bugs<br>so there's a couple of examples here of<br>cases where I found bugs in software<br>that you can use provenance to track<br>down but I'll reveal the complete set<br>for discussion for example here you have<br>a password dialog box telling us that<br>the password is too long after I've<br>typed a single character into that box<br>that's also telling you that you've got<br>a maximum of 16 characters which is<br>probably broken from a security<br>perspective anyway for those of us that<br>have had the use of our old content<br>management system for the website then<br>this is an example of where it was<br>saying something was wrong the following<br>reasons and a blank list one of the ones<br>that I enjoy is this one from acrobat<br>where the software malfunctioned before<br>it even got to the point of saying what<br>the error was and so you're just seeing<br>internal programming code and it's<br>telling you sh bad news is coming okay<br>and the bottom examples here are where<br>the major Cloud providers have crashed<br>and lost some of my data so just to make<br>sure that it's clear that you know the<br>cloud isn't the perfect solution to this<br>so there's many challenges in terms of<br>cloud computing one aspect is that there<br>are so many different stakeholders<br>involved and so I've looked at some of<br>the cloud technology that's important<br>but there's a lot of human level<br>complexity that's important as well and<br>this is an area where provenance is<br>interesting because it allows a<br>connection between the human and the<br>technical so I spend a lot of my time<br>working with amazing researchers who are<br>buried down in the depths of some<br>operating system kernel you can kind of<br>look up the users that are far above you<br>doing the application things it's really<br>important to make sure that these groups<br>don't end up falling apart from each<br>other so Providence is where I'm looking<br>to kind of join that Gap together<br>so in terms of just the examples here<br>you see that you've got the cloud<br>service providers you've got the<br>companies that use the cloud you've got<br>the end users that then use the software<br>the cloud customers provide and all<br>these sort of things to do with system<br>administration and software developers<br>regulation get more complicated in the<br>cloud because everything is distributed<br>across multiple different organizations<br>and then you've got law enforcement who<br>want to know what's happening you've got<br>things happening across multiple<br>jurisdictions it all gets quite<br>complicated quite quickly<br>so when it comes to that what we want to<br>have is cloud data processing be able to<br>support this very Dynamic fast<br>Outsourcing of information processing<br>which happens but we need to be able to<br>do things like protect data despite the<br>fact it's traveling internationally<br>around and we also need to track how the<br>data is changing hands<br>well I often mention in fact even<br>today's Cloud lecture when we started<br>off the cloud paper today talking about<br>how the European Union has been a great<br>benefit to us all because Europe<br>represents a big enough chunk of the<br>technical population of use of software<br>it turns out that a lot of the things<br>that the EU do actually benefit everyone<br>an example with respect to handling uh<br>private data or personal data is the<br>general data protection regulation<br>that's been globally useful in terms of<br>protecting us from some of the things<br>that can go wrong with respect to sort<br>of big commercial impacts but there's<br>many more things the EU has up its<br>sleeve coming out with respect to the<br>digital surfaces act the digital markets<br>Act and the AI act not talking much<br>about AI tonight but it's certainly<br>another area where I've been being able<br>to join a journey in terms of looking at<br>Safety and Security and trustworthiness<br>with respect to that kind of Technology<br>so I'm going to give you a very quick<br>access control primer to describe where<br>some other aspects of security fit and<br>try to tie all this together<br>two main approaches that are applied for<br>security discretionary access control<br>and mandatory Access Control<br>discretionary Access Control was the<br>typical type of thing you'll get when<br>you're managing your own resources files<br>and folders on your own computer you're<br>the owner you get to say who gets to do<br>what with your data mandatory access<br>control on the other hand is where you<br>have something like intelligence<br>services to a multi-level security there<br>you have these rules that are<br>systematically applied to all the<br>participants and all the data items and<br>you can express those rules and enforce<br>them in a consistent way so for example<br>you can't send top secret records to<br>people that only have a secret label<br>likewise you cannot read top secret<br>records if you yourself only have a<br>secret label<br>these two types of Access Control appear<br>to be something that for example Donald<br>Trump has been confusing recently with<br>respect to record management but this is<br>the problem that we have here is that<br>mandatory access control is typically<br>less convenient which means we typically<br>don't use it however it usually provides<br>stronger guarantees and it's one of the<br>technologies that I'm definitely<br>promoting<br>but in addition to that and orthogonal<br>to the access control we also have this<br>issue of fine-grained security Now what<br>do I mean by that<br>security designs implemented in software<br>and Hardware are often engineering<br>focused and what I mean by that is that<br>the operating system design normally<br>ends up influencing how all these<br>concerns get written out in terms of<br>what the operating system can enforce so<br>an operating system's job typically is<br>to keep your applications and his two<br>applications left hand and right hand<br>that are kept separate from each other<br>now let's consider one to be your email<br>program and want to be a database of<br>Student Records or something like that<br>you probably wouldn't do email in your<br>database of Student Records anyway let's<br>go with that example for the sake of it<br>the operating system's job is to keep<br>these two things isolated from each<br>other<br>but the problem with that is that this<br>database is handling sensitive<br>information and ideally what you'd like<br>is that the records inside this database<br>are also protected from each other<br>but the operating system just sees it as<br>an application<br>what we would like is the ability for<br>the database to explain to the operating<br>system how to help it do its own<br>security because then we abstract out<br>the Security Management from the<br>database software and we can approach<br>that with a consistent way from the<br>operating system that's what I mean by<br>fine-grained security ideally we move to<br>a world where all data that the computer<br>is handling in software has fine-grained<br>security metadata so we understand<br>details about the meaning of that data<br>and can thus understand how to delegate<br>the enforcement to the operating system<br>and make this kind of work effectively<br>as a means of doing access control and<br>security<br>so the final thing that needs to be kind<br>of put into this mix is this notion of<br>security capabilities<br>what are capabilities well we know what<br>capabilities are but again this is one<br>of those things what does it mean in a<br>computer science sense how is computer<br>science taking this word and used it in<br>some way<br>capabilities in the computer science<br>sense are a description of the<br>embodiment of a permission to carry out<br>some action<br>now I quite like this because it becomes<br>a kind of unit of something that is kind<br>of separate from other types of data so<br>you can see it's got this ability to<br>have security metadata you understand<br>it's about something different from<br>normal data it's actually managing<br>security<br>it allows you to factor out the security<br>credentials as a different sort of data<br>in your software which improves the<br>separation of concerns in terms of how<br>you write your software so a database<br>Rider can just write a database that<br>does queries quickly they don't have to<br>worry about security because they're<br>able to factor out the management of<br>that security to something else now my<br>PhD thesis actually explore distributed<br>capabilities and I didn't really focus<br>on that being the case but this is the<br>thread that's starting to run through<br>what I've realized is is this research<br>Journey<br>what I was looking at there was over the<br>Internet over a network of systems how<br>could you do access control for<br>decentralized electronic health records<br>so we implemented a way of representing<br>policies for decision making in an<br>access control engine and that's all<br>well and good we explored whether or not<br>the policies that we could represent<br>were suitable for the types of health<br>record management that were necessary<br>but one of the problems that I would<br>love to fix and hopefully we'll get the<br>opportunity to fix is that the<br>enforcement of that security required<br>the software to kind of interact with<br>our Access Control engine so we could<br>answer questions about whether different<br>users in a system should be allowed to<br>do different things but one of the big<br>problems with software is that people<br>often forget to check the access control<br>rules and so you leave off calling the<br>access control engine and that means<br>that sometimes you're asking whether or<br>not a particular Security check occurs<br>and other times the software is left it<br>out which means you get security holes<br>in your software so what I would like<br>would be to strengthen the way the<br>enforcement can work and that's where<br>we'll try to join these bits together<br>this is largely bling Graphics you don't<br>need to appreciate all the details here<br>but it's an example of another iteration<br>of this journey down capability systems<br>that's leading me to where I am today<br>and here what I'm showing you is<br>capabilities within what I've called a<br>unique software engine and by using the<br>term unique what I mean is it's really<br>cool but nobody uses it but that's okay<br>because we didn't necessarily expect<br>people were going to adopt this one of<br>the difficulties was we built this<br>message passing infrastructure to allow<br>this kind of really elegant handling of<br>messages in a system that had security<br>metadata associated with them but the<br>big problem is that you have to write<br>all the software from scratch and who<br>wants to do that there's a lot of<br>software that already exists and it's<br>quite important to have a path from<br>what's term Legacy software meaning<br>today's software to use in new platforms<br>that come out so I do you find ways to<br>wrap security around something that<br>already exists and in this particular<br>example what we were looking at was<br>affecting what's called Dark pool<br>Trading<br>and it's a bit surprising that this was<br>happening literally pretty much in<br>parallel with the global financial<br>crisis I don't think it had anything to<br>do with us but this is an example where<br>we were looking at the labeling of data<br>if you're dealing with a stock exchange<br>and I'm going to go rapidly off my area<br>of expertise pretty quickly here but if<br>you're dealing with a stock exchange I<br>understand that concept you get buy and<br>sell orders I understand that as well if<br>you're a large Merchant Bank interacting<br>with that that Stock Exchange you'll<br>often get a large queue of buy and sell<br>orders that you're going to try to get<br>onto the exchange somehow<br>what we were interested in is showing<br>that as an example where we could use<br>this fancy security technology to allow<br>us to do things like match buy and sell<br>orders that were sitting within that<br>organization before they got to the<br>exchange without having to reveal who<br>the buy and sell orders actually were<br>for so we could deal with these software<br>components that had partial visibility<br>of a particular message and could do<br>intelligent and useful things without<br>needing any more information than the<br>limited focus of information they had in<br>front of them and this is a powerful<br>model because it means you can make much<br>more secure systems by putting these<br>sort of boundaries around individual<br>software components knowing the overall<br>design is going to cause the effect that<br>you want in terms of the net outcome of<br>the secure software<br>but like I said the difficulty here was<br>you had to write everything from scratch<br>so where are we now<br>we're moving now towards<br>um what I want to kind of conclude with<br>as this promising uh trajectory leading<br>forwards<br>typical enforcement in the modern<br>operating systems again work by this<br>idea you've got this all-powerful<br>operating system kernel that's managing<br>Security on behalf of the whole<br>operating system but the problem is<br>operating system kernels are full of<br>bugs and we know that because we get<br>software updates all the time this is<br>the type of thing that's getting fixed<br>when people realize there are problems<br>generally there's a rule that you will<br>have bugs in code for just a certain<br>number of lines of code there's a ratio<br>that almost always holds true and<br>operating systems contain millions of<br>lines of code so they definitely still<br>contain bugs even when those bugs are<br>being fixed<br>what we'd kind of like though is this<br>ability as I said to get these user kind<br>of processes like this database they<br>need to access privileges on a system<br>the security checks are often ad hoc and<br>this leads to this problem that you can<br>get these flaws as I mentioned from the<br>missing Access Control checks and one<br>analogy that only goes so far but I'm<br>going to run with it it's kind of like<br>having a complicated Road network if you<br>put kind of toll Gates sprinkled through<br>that road Network and we're talking<br>about really complicated Road Network<br>let's make it higher dimensional so it's<br>not even 2D but you've got all these<br>toll Gates you need to check whether or<br>not there's reachability down all those<br>different paths what would be would be<br>better for us is to have a stronger<br>partitioning of traffic so say Road<br>versus rail generally trains don't get<br>far on roads and cars don't get that far<br>on train tracks that's an example of a<br>kind of strong partitioning that we<br>would like to have where could we seek<br>to find that kind of strength of<br>partitioning<br>down in the CPU of these systems<br>so again we come to something which is<br>actually not a new idea it was done in<br>the 1970s but it's happening again<br>this concept of memory capabilities<br>memory capabilities are capabilities<br>that's security permission to do a thing<br>but they relate to access to data the<br>access to memory so you're controlling<br>access to the data that is in Ram and<br>they are controlled generally by the CPU<br>so this really means you can plant the<br>security down low into the hardware of<br>your system<br>and it means we can come towards a<br>joining of the different components I'm<br>talking about fine-grained mandatory<br>enforcement of the memory that is inside<br>all of your programs all the data there<br>this is absolutely ideal like I said<br>it's actually not a new idea it was<br>built in the Cambridge cap computer<br>which became operational in in 1976 also<br>the Apple 2E came operational around<br>that time and so did I in terms of<br>things coming operational it turns out<br>that the cap computer which nowadays<br>doesn't do very much I actually walked<br>past that almost every day that I was<br>doing my PhD work in the computer<br>laboratory and again this might have<br>been a bell ringing in the back of my<br>mind saying capabilities they're kind of<br>important they're actually your research<br>thing but I didn't really notice I was<br>going to go and have a shower after<br>riding my bike into the lab or whatever<br>the cap computer is an example of a<br>physical computer where every single<br>item of the memory of that computer has<br>additional security metadata included in<br>the hardware so every single data access<br>has Security checks applied and for a<br>security researcher that sounds great<br>but it is generally the point as I said<br>that we can move towards this fine grain<br>oh they're now coming back new CPUs<br>again the University of Cambridge have<br>been recently developing new CPU designs<br>with security extensions<br>in particular the project I'm referring<br>to which I'm certainly not directly<br>involved with but was again starting at<br>the time that I was going looking<br>somewhere else in the computer<br>laboratory Cherry the capability<br>Hardware enhanced risk instructions<br>design and because computer science<br>never have enough of those abbreviations<br>that abbreviation contains an<br>abbreviation namely risk so I'll quickly<br>go over what that is although it's not<br>particularly important risk is the<br>reduced instruction set computer so I<br>just included that for completeness very<br>broadly risk is why the new Apple chips<br>run very quickly and at very low energy<br>consumption compared to equivalent Intel<br>chips Intel has his legacy problem<br>they've chosen to support Legacy<br>Technologies because that's you know a<br>commercial decision for them whereas<br>Apple just like Chuck away any backwards<br>compatibility every time they do<br>something new and they're really winning<br>in this case because their new designs<br>can really strongly embrace the risk<br>design anyway that's just a way of<br>making computers go fast the Cherry<br>Point is that you get the ability for<br>your software to use cpu-enforced<br>fine-grained mandatory memory security<br>where this fits in terms of the cloud is<br>that recently I've had the privilege of<br>working with people Imperial College<br>London and this is fairly recent work<br>this in the last couple of years that<br>this has sort of really started coming<br>together we've been rethinking<br>virtualization for cloud computing so<br>we've come up with this way of using<br>capabilities to create a virtual machine<br>like abstraction but it's using memory<br>capabilities to do the security<br>isolation instead of the ways that<br>virtual machines typically work<br>otherwise and what this means is that we<br>can get strong isolation of the<br>different application components which<br>is what we want but we're also getting<br>to do it in a way that is safe and has<br>very efficient sharing of data between<br>these components so this is really<br>exciting and hopefully I get to tell you<br>more about that but before I conclude on<br>the research I want to talk about<br>another sense of having my head in the<br>clouds<br>Dunedin talking about settling here and<br>again Giselle and I when we first walked<br>up Mount Cargill we were about the same<br>place but we didn't even get to see the<br>fact there was a microwave Tower because<br>the cloud was even thicker at that time<br>time you can hear the wind winding<br>through it but we couldn't actually see<br>it so the setting in Dunedin the<br>community the sunny people and those of<br>you who are here tonight extremely<br>pleased thank you for being here and<br>also the people who are online watching<br>as well it's been wonderful to settle in<br>Dunedin I said the sunny people and the<br>sometimes sunny weather but the reality<br>is that dunedin's range of weather is<br>just great anyway because the weather is<br>so contrasting and so constantly<br>changing but how many places would you<br>have an environment where you could go<br>for a quick run at lunchtime and end up<br>600 meters above sea level looking out<br>over Dunedin<br>or indeed you can go home and end up<br>above the clouds entirely so you get<br>your choice between above and below and<br>the rainbows I guess are just where the<br>clouds sort of more around you in that<br>sense you get to I mean in my sense this<br>is a really something I very much enjoy<br>about the natural environment being able<br>to be sort of out having a bit of a<br>thinking break being refreshed by the<br>sleety hail and you know ducking the odd<br>flying tree branch but for me though to<br>continue actually seeing this wonderful<br>environment certainly recently that's<br>involved a fair bit of Ophthalmology and<br>that's another aspect where I am very<br>thankful for Dunedin it's been another<br>town in my sequence of towns that have<br>excellent ophthalmologists<br>to deal with which bits of the eyeball<br>can be replaced or removed or stuck back<br>on again and again and again which has<br>been the last kind of year and again I'm<br>very well aware that this has fallen<br>unduly in terms of inconvenience on<br>Gisele and Robbie with respect to this<br>but the ophthalmologist who I weren't<br>embarrass but who was leading my care<br>with respect to all of these different<br>repairs just represents so much of what<br>I enjoy about Dunedin he went Way Beyond<br>the Call of Duty on multiple occasions<br>it wasn't going to tell you the details<br>about but we're still really touching in<br>terms of just what was just assumed to<br>be what he would do to support you know<br>patients and the recovery that I've been<br>able to enjoy although of course I'd<br>also say that because I'm in for IDOC<br>again come November because we're going<br>to try to fix the right one anyway we'll<br>see how that goes<br>so Dunedin has given me a vast number of<br>opportunities for running around like<br>crazy which I very much enjoy both<br>physically and mentally so the<br>University of otago we've heard about<br>the teaching the research and the<br>service and I very much appreciate the<br>introductions there the scales of<br>collaboration local within the<br>department National and international<br>and in terms of life in general between<br>family and friends and colleagues<br>but the question you might ask voice I<br>hope you would would be what if you<br>plotted where I was<br>if I only got halfway to the next thing<br>I'm trying to get to in terms of this<br>particular triangle of sets of Threes of<br>things<br>we'll change that I can kind of answer<br>your question because I've got something<br>handy here already if we were going to<br>go and look at this particular program<br>I'll show you that now we're changing to<br>high resolution Graphics which is<br>comparatively higher but not<br>particularly High we're picking a color<br>where kind of putting in some<br>coordinates here line 30 we're going to<br>choose which of the particular things<br>the different endpoints I'm running<br>towards in this triangle and then we<br>make a couple of decisions basically we<br>said TX and t y of the target X and<br>Target y that I want to move to 70 and<br>80 those lines move me halfway towards<br>any of those particular targets and we<br>plot a point what do we get<br>well you get some dots that's the<br>problem with these machines is they're<br>so slow that the actual picture may not<br>emerge quite as quickly as you might<br>like but I can cheat because of course<br>there's not a real Apple to me so I can<br>just fast forward you to a state that I<br>saved earlier it's still going but here<br>we go it's a skip forwards a little bit<br>in terms of time and an interesting<br>property of these machines is they're<br>largely deterministic because I don't<br>even have a clock I don't even know what<br>the time of day is so I can teleport<br>them forwards and backwards in Virtual<br>machines without it being a problem<br>anyway this represents a fractal<br>triangle in a kind of slightly ugly<br>detail so I've got one here that's a<br>little bit more kind of vectorized the<br>point here though is that while I'm<br>extremely well aware of my kind of<br>finite time and the ability to run<br>between all the different interactions<br>I've had well it kind of feels like the<br>richness is the infinite circumference<br>that still can fit within that finite<br>area and again how could one find a<br>geekier way of saying thanks to all of<br>you than that but I'm not done I've got<br>a little bit more a bit more thinking<br>key formative experience is<br>again thank you to my parents it's great<br>to have you both here the academic<br>steering or nudging that was necessary<br>at various times my sister and her<br>family in Sydney and again all the<br>friends and family worldwide Giselle and<br>I have lived in Australia and the UK and<br>New Zealand and you know we've had<br>countless fantastic opportunities to<br>engage with wonderful people all around<br>the world and these people had really<br>lasting and very positive effects of<br>course on all of my experiences then<br>there's also more local to home as well<br>our caffeine fueled CST room not<br>necessarily everyone's completely<br>caffeine fuel but certainly I am and so<br>again I am very thankful to all the<br>interactions I've got to have in the<br>department because this has sort of<br>really been formative for where I've<br>been able to go so thank you again but<br>I'm still not done<br>in terms of the last fail or the most<br>recent phase of thanks that I would give<br>my world was certainly turned upside<br>down by this guy and of course this is a<br>sort of privacy preserving photo because<br>it's kind of like that's a baby which is<br>true but nonetheless this was a complete<br>revolution in terms of my life and I was<br>thinking there that like actually when<br>talking about this and the thanks that I<br>have for Giselle and Robbie are that<br>there was a slight possibility that I<br>might even get kind of emotional I don't<br>normally lecture about you know my<br>family so I thought that it might be<br>about now that it could be a time to<br>kind of consider a very useful<br>reflection of the essence of my<br>communication style that was provided to<br>me at one time by my PhD supervisor in<br>Cambridge<br>and so as a consequence of that I will<br>allow the next slide to Simply this is<br>my second last slide to stay on screen<br>for long enough this is another case<br>where I have kind of Applied a kind of<br>privacy preserving technique you can see<br>the Giselle and Robbie have legs and<br>that's about as much detail as you'll<br>pick out from this imagery<br>there's also the point down the bottom<br>which you can read and possibly use as a<br>talking point when we move to<br>Refreshments later on<br>but to conclude on the research front I<br>would like to say that as this day ends<br>and we look forward to the days that<br>come in future<br>cloud computing is going to have an<br>ever-increasing impact there's a ton of<br>different security and data data<br>provenance tracking challenges that we<br>still have but what's been really great<br>is to see that actually I think these<br>building blocks speaking as an engineer<br>are starting to fit together to show<br>that there is real promise in this idea<br>of taking fine-grained mandatory<br>security and actually being able to<br>apply it in really practical context for<br>cloud computing so I'm hoping that that<br>continues particularly supported by this<br>idea of the CPU memory capabilities that<br>I feel are going to be able to transform<br>Cloud security so on that note what I<br>can say one thing for sure is that I<br>thanks<br>Professor Barker do not quite Professor<br>Blakey tinakwe Professor ears pier<br>nakota and welcome to all the friends<br>and family gathered here today to help<br>celebrate Dave's tremendous achievement<br>of<br>um attaining the lofty ranks of<br>professorship<br>and for those of you don't know me I'm<br>uh Stephen Mills I'm currently head of<br>Department of computer science but as<br>we've heard I may soon have the<br>distinction of being the shortest lived<br>head of Department uh in the history a<br>record that can never be taken from me<br>um it's been uh and I also took up the<br>role at the start of the year and so<br>this is my inaugural inaugural<br>professional lecture closing and it's<br>the only one I'll have a chance to do at<br>least within the department and it's a<br>great pleasure for me personally that<br>it's Dave<br>I've had the great privilege of working<br>with Dave and teaching and research and<br>service<br>and all of my interactions with them<br>have been tremendous and it is so great<br>to see all of his hard work being<br>I was thinking about things I could say<br>about Dave I'm going to say some nice<br>things I'm going to say something uh<br>people always say nice things at the<br>moment so I'll start with something<br>um else which is about imposter syndrome<br>so imposter syndrome is the feeling you<br>get that you've just faked it to be here<br>and it's something a lot of academics<br>have the negative thing I'll say about<br>Dave is he triggers my imposter syndrome<br>apologies there are different types of<br>computer scientists some of us like what<br>you can do with computers some of us<br>like computers Dave likes both and he's<br>very good at both I just like what we<br>can do with computers so whenever he<br>starts talking about how they actually<br>work I think<br>I was also thinking<br>um<br>there's a lot of words I could use to<br>describe Dave but one that occurred to<br>me when I was sitting there that hadn't<br>really occurred to me before is Brave I<br>think Dave is a very brave man because<br>he has two characteristics which I think<br>you saw one is the ability to attract<br>technical glitches and bugs<br>there are things that happen to Dave<br>that don't happen to other people that<br>reflect the deeper in the workings of<br>computers the other one is his desire to<br>put live demos into all of his talks<br>I've also had the privilege of teaching<br>with Dave on a number of courses uh and<br>I'm always reassured when Dave's there<br>because I know I don't have to worry<br>about any of the technical stuff he'll<br>just sort that out even if it involves<br>some very lengthy what he refers to as<br>Yak shaving scripts in order to automate<br>various University Systems so he doesn't<br>have to click on anything<br>a Dave will quite happily spend a week<br>but as you've seen Dave's Communication<br>is excellent there are a number of<br>different feelings you have after an<br>academic gives a talk the most current<br>one is Con common one is confused and<br>frustrated<br>more positive ones that you can feel are<br>that person's really bright or I feel<br>really smart because I understood what<br>was going on and Dave has an uncanny<br>Knack of doing both of those last two at<br>the same time<br>and this is also something I've seen in<br>his lectures to undergraduates his<br>ability to explain complex things<br>in quite a lot of detail but in a way<br>that's accessible and understandable and<br>lets people take away their<br>understanding of that is truly<br>tremendous<br>in terms of research I've had the honor<br>to work with Dave on a number of<br>research Pro projects I've admired his<br>commitment to the projects and also his<br>ability to really get to the heart of<br>what the research questions are and this<br>insight into what's really going on and<br>what the key things to explore are I<br>think is what's LED Dave on his path<br>which as he feels it's Meandering but I<br>think it's always heading towards the<br>so there's a few other jobs I have to do<br>before we finish up and I've been warned<br>not to take too long Dave managed to<br>finish with 12 seconds on the clock<br>which is tremendous<br>um so my next duty is to present Dave<br>with a token of our appreciation for all<br>of his work and a reminder<br>and I'm reliably told to be down in the<br>air of this day and your promotion so<br>this is for you congratulations thank<br>you<br>okay<br>um I'd like to thank you all for coming<br>out and supporting Dave tonight and also<br>thank all the people who are watching<br>online or on recording<br>um I know that Dave has got connections<br>around the world<br>um and people are thinking of them who<br>can't be here today<br>um and so thank you to all of you for<br>coming along uh and thanks to Dave once<br>again for his IPL which has been truly<br>enlightening<br>and my final formal duty of the evening<br>is to invite you all to join us back at<br>the staff club for drinks and<br>refreshments uh to join Dave and again<br>celebrating his well-deserved promotion<br>kyota</p></main><footer style="margin-top: 2rem; background: #0001; padding: 2rem; text-align: center;"><p>We Are The University</p><ul
