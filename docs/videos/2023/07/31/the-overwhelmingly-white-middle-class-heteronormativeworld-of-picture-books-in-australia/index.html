One key way they learn about the world, both explicitly and implicitly, is through the literature shared with them by parents and caregivers. What is portrayed in those books is significant in shaping children’s self-image. This presentation reports on a study conducted with the support of a Freilich Project ECR Small Research Grant. <br><br>We investigated the representation of diversity in 96 picture books shortlisted in major children’s book awards in Australia in 2019 and 2020. We conducted a book audit through a critical theoretical framework. The study found that award winning books in Australia overwhelmingly portray white, middle-class, heteronormative viewpoints and ideologies. While the perspectives of diverse groups and identities were overall not negatively represented, they were instead largely absent and thus invisible. <br><br>In some books, the use of stereotypical and ill-considered images showed a somewhat superficial understanding of the ways in which images can promote authentic representation and inclusion. The outcomes of this study have implications for educators, policy makers, early childhood organisations, the publishing industry, and those providing higher education and training for early childhood educators.<br><br>BIO<br>Dr Helen Adam is passionate about promoting socially just and<br>equitable education. Helen believes, to achieve equitable outcomes, we need to challenge systemic inequities and support educators as they work for better futures for young Australians.<br>Helen advocates for culturally responsive use of authentically diverse and inclusive literature as one vehicle to break down barriers of prejudice and misunderstanding and contribute to equitable outcomes.<br><br>Helen holds a PhD from Edith Cowan University in which she investigated the use of culturally diverse literature to support principles of diversity in early years education. The outcomes and impact of her work have been published in internationally renowned journals garnering extensive international print and digital media coverage including appearances on Channel 7’s Sunrise and national news bulletins in Australia and New Zealand.

accurate.</p><p>hello everyone and look it's really<br>lovely to be sharing with passionate<br>people on a topic that's you know is<br>really Central to my work<br>um thank you for your lovely welcome and<br>acknowledgment Nicola and I'd like to<br>acknowledge too that I live and work on<br>the lands of the people here in the land<br>that we call Australia in the land that<br>we call Western Australia and I pay my<br>respects to the traditional custodians<br>of our land and of of your land as well<br>um so what I'm reporting on today is<br>um a study that I undertook with another<br>academic who just happens to be my<br>sister Sally Dr Sally Murphy who is<br>who's actually an Australian<br>award-winning Australian author herself<br>and this this particular article uh is<br>one article from the study and um this<br>has just come out if you subscribe to<br>bookbird at all through ibby this is in<br>the latest<br>um latest edition of ibby<br>so whoops and I'm just sorry I clicked<br>the wrong thing now I've just lost<br>something on another screen but that's<br>all right we'll come back to that okay<br>get you with it okay so<br>um so the the this study was supported<br>by the free Lich project which is spaced<br>at um Australian uh I think it's based<br>at Canberra university university of<br>Canberra<br>um and the free Lich project is<br>sponsored<br>um grants that investigate uh the<br>perpetuation of bigotry and Prejudice so<br>we investigated<br>um how Australian award-winning books or<br>Australian books May or not be may or<br>may not be promoting<br>um Prejudice and bigotry and and buyers<br>so we looked at the representation of<br>diversity in 96 picture books<br>shortlisted in major children's book<br>awards in Australia in 2019 and 20. now<br>one of the things that's important about<br>this is we were not my king doing this<br>study to make judgments about book<br>awards rather we use the book awards<br>um as a way of getting a a purpose of<br>purposeful sample of children's books<br>published in Australia in those two<br>years so while there are implications<br>for book awards this study is not about<br>um so much about whether book awards are<br>making judgments about books Etc<br>um but that was we used the the books<br>that have been listed in in several<br>major book awards in Australia as the<br>way that we chose the picture books for<br>the study<br>because and part of that rationale is<br>that it is book awards that are often<br>the used as the part of the Frameworks<br>or methods for librarians and teachers<br>and parents to purchase books so we<br>chose award listed books because they're<br>the ones who get more promotion they're<br>the ones that parents and and teachers<br>and Librarians hear more about so<br>they're the ones that are a bit more<br>likely to go into the hands of children<br>um and we conducted a book audit through<br>a critical theoretical framework<br>um which is sort of premised on you know<br>what are the messages you know<br>literature mediates messages that<br>children receive about themselves and<br>their roles and places in society so<br>um we wanted to look at what are the<br>messages what are the representation<br>um of how how children receive these<br>messages and there's been some<br>absolutely amazing uh people do this<br>work in the past Gloria Boutte I just<br>want to pay a little bit of tribute to<br>her<br>um she's an African-American professor<br>in in the University of South Carolina<br>and she's been very influential and<br>instrumental in the work that I'm doing<br>myself<br>so um<br>what we did we did the study we<br>collected all the information now as I<br>mentioned Sally the other academic is an<br>award-winning author so Sally's actually<br>going to be reporting on this her angle<br>of the study is from a white cisgendered<br>majority author how do the findings and<br>the outcomes of of what we've found in<br>the representations impact<br>on her work so I've written with with my<br>co-author who was the research assistant<br>on this project uh Yvonne urket we've<br>done the critical lens on the<br>representation and the messaging of the<br>books we've looked at race ethnicity<br>gender which is under preparation and<br>ability and inclusivity which is also<br>under preparation So today we're just<br>looking at the representation of race<br>um<br>in these books<br>okay so just a little bit of background<br>literature and I'm sure I'm I'm talking<br>to the the converted I'm sure I'm<br>talking to people who are very much<br>aware of of the importance but there's a<br>lot of evidence<br>um International evidence that<br>consistently showing that the<br>publication of children's books favors<br>um books portraying white middle class<br>heterosexual mostly male Man characters<br>and story lines<br>um<br>and you know there's a lot of evidence<br>that show particularly evidence from the<br>CCBC so that's the Cooperative book<br>children's actually should be CCBC but<br>anyway Cooperative children's book<br>Center<br>um in Wisconsin in in University of<br>Wisconsin in Madison they've been doing<br>um diversity statistics for over 30<br>years<br>um in fact the latest figures have just<br>come out so I got that in my inbox<br>yesterday but I haven't had time to look<br>at that<br>um and their work is referred to by<br>pretty much every every anyone who works<br>in this field<br>um and they they've actually they're<br>evidence that from them suggests that uh<br>children from underrepresented groups<br>are more likely to see dinosaurs or<br>rabbits as main characters than they are<br>to see a character from a background<br>like their own<br>now in Australia so in the US and in the<br>UK they have through the CCBC in um the<br>US and through Center for literacy and<br>primary education in London in the UK<br>they have this annual broad spectrum<br>reporting on the statistics in book<br>children's books you know where<br>Publishers send in all the books that<br>they've published in that year and these<br>groups have got the funding and the<br>resourcing to do these statistics now we<br>don't have that in Australia I'm hoping<br>I might be able to change that at some<br>point<br>um<br>but there are there are studies and<br>increasing studies particularly since I<br>started this journey or published my PhD<br>in 2019<br>um that's showing the books available to<br>young children in Early Learning Centers<br>are predominantly monocultural there's<br>very little authentic and contemporary<br>representation of diversity there was<br>one study I don't know if I've got that<br>one here oh yes there we go sorry there<br>was one study done<br>um<br>of award-winning picture books from the<br>early childhood category of the<br>children's book Council between and this<br>was cable and Tian who are Australian<br>academics and they looked at they went<br>back through the award-listed<br>um Early Childhood category from 2001 to<br>2020 and they found that while there was<br>an equal proportion of Maine sorry main<br>male and female characters they said<br>what we do not see are characters that<br>reflect Australian Society in their full<br>diversity of ability sexuality and<br>ethnicity so there are studies there is<br>an increasing amount of studies but<br>they're still mostly small scale<br>so we think that we like to we argue<br>that<br>um the representation of uh ethnic and<br>racial diversity is implicitly at odds<br>with um the United Nations convention on<br>the rights of the child and particularly<br>if the books are containing outdated<br>inaccurate or incomplete representations<br>of diversity then<br>misunderstandings and misconceptions<br>about diverse backgrounds can be<br>perpetuated and this is where it<br>contributes to Prejudice discrimination<br>and bigotry because young children learn<br>their attitudes towards races from as<br>young as three months of age they can<br>develop own race bias as young as three<br>months of age<br>but the same studies that have found<br>that have also found that you can<br>disrupt that uh development of that bias<br>even through picture form so this where<br>the books that children are exposed to<br>from a very young age can play a very<br>important part in the development of<br>their<br>um or the disruption of developing that<br>own race bias so it's just as important<br>for majority Greek children to be<br>exposed to diversity and authentic<br>diversity in books so that um<br>if I don't grow up thinking that white<br>white middle class is normal and they<br>develop those understandings and empathy<br>and<br>um Intercultural awareness from a very<br>very young age<br>so<br>um this this the um children's<br>CCBC in Wisconsin these were the<br>statistics that we used at the time of<br>the study that's why it's the 2018<br>um study they produce these fantastic<br>infographics and it's really important<br>to see<br>um what this what this means so<br>you've got some for white children so<br>I'm I'm sure most of you would have<br>heard of the um analogy of Windows and<br>mirrors but I'll quickly just describe<br>that again that was sort of coined by<br>Rude and Sims Bishop who's probably the<br>most um<br>seminal scholar in this field who<br>started<br>um really started making a push for<br>diverse literature back in the in the<br>80s and 90s<br>um and she refers to she actually refers<br>to Windows mirrors and sliding glass<br>doors but today I'll talk more about the<br>just the windows and the mirrors but<br>when children can see people like<br>themselves in books it's like a mirror<br>they get to see reflections of<br>themselves The Familiar their family and<br>as you can see in in here you can see<br>that<br>with 50 of the books published in in<br>2018 in the in the US<br>why white kids particularly white boys<br>could see themselves as superheroes<br>royalty<br>astronauts the bad guy all sorts of<br>things so multiple multiple mirrors<br>um<br>and then animals<br>27 now you might think well animals<br>don't need a mirror but here's the thing<br>research so studies that look at the and<br>and I use this methodology as well that<br>look at the viewpoints and ideologies in<br>animal stories often find the animals<br>that often you usually used as a proxy<br>for whiteness so the the activities the<br>dress the language<br>um the story lines are very often if you<br>if you said to myself right I'm going to<br>take the animals out replace them with<br>people they would actually be<br>white middle-class people so what you<br>actually have is 77 of these books are<br>mirrors for your white majority<br>um 10 African-American seven percent<br>Asian Pacific five percent latinx and<br>only one percent for First Nations<br>people<br>um so you know these are concerning and<br>while um there is hope these are<br>gradually changing and I'll show you<br>some more recent ones from CCBC in a<br>minute you'll still see this<br>overwhelming<br>um you know inequitable opportunity for<br>the majority to see themselves in<br>multiple ways and multiple<br>representations now I'll just explain<br>the notion of the window so with Windows<br>we look we'll look out we look through<br>we see<br>um other people and we learn from those<br>so<br>um when you read a book that reflects<br>something that's different to what your<br>own experience is it's like you're<br>looking through a window and this is<br>where we develop understandings and<br>empathy<br>um<br>of of difference and similarity so<br>windows and mirrors are very very<br>important and as you can see often the<br>white majority get plenty of of mirrors<br>but not so many windows<br>okay so as I said in um in Australia<br>there's no Road uh regular broad<br>spectrum reporting<br>um and we know that there's just not<br>enough<br>um that are reaching children the the<br>books that are going into Early Learning<br>Centers are predominantly Multicultural<br>and that's at direct opposite to what's<br>happening in the population you know<br>that we have in Australia over 25 you<br>know in most classrooms now are children<br>who were born overseas or their children<br>are born overseas we have a a growing<br>population from Asian nations from<br>African nations<br>um and so children are being deprived or<br>missing out on the opportunity to see<br>themselves represented and all the<br>benefits that go with that<br>so<br>um here's what we did I won't spend too<br>much time on methodology but<br>um I'll just spend a bit of it as I said<br>at the beginning of the study we chose<br>picture books that were included in the<br>lists for one or more of the following<br>Awards<br>um for 2019 2020 so notables list and<br>picture in early childhood and picture<br>book character categories for children's<br>book Council of Australia now these are<br>the biggest Awards in Australia biggest<br>children's book awards in Australia the<br>notables is is like the long list so the<br>way these Awards go they'll go notables<br>then they come to a short list and then<br>they come to winner and honor books so<br>we went for the notables so that we<br>could get<br>um the books that were sort of judged as<br>being those ones that are um<br>are likely to be recommended to to<br>parents families Etc we looked at the<br>Australian book industry Awards picture<br>book category the Prime Minister<br>literature Awards uh New South Wales<br>Premier League Awards Queensland Premier<br>Awards and the West wa premieres book<br>awards and of course they were all<br>around picture books so we came up with<br>96 and as I said before and I've covered<br>this before that we've used this<br>critical pedagogical perspective that's<br>implicit on how books mediate messages<br>that children receive about their<br>cultures and roles roles so<br>what I did was and this is what I've<br>done in my PhD study is I use we use<br>Bishops categories so I'm going to<br>explain those to you so Bishop developed<br>these categories in her work in the 80s<br>and 90s where she was looking at well<br>when we do have a book that has<br>representation or some kind of<br>Multicultural representation<br>what kind of representation is that so<br>she came up with three categories now<br>over over the time of her work she<br>sometimes has referred to the first one<br>as culturally neutral and sometimes this<br>Melting Pot this one is culturally<br>generic or socially conscious this is<br>culturally authentic specific or<br>conscious so the labels have been have<br>varied a little bit so I'm going to<br>explain each of those with examples not<br>from books in a study but examples from<br>um some of them examples from my<br>previous studies and some of them are<br>examples<br>um just to to demonstrate what is meant<br>by these categories now the reason I<br>like to use Bishops categories is<br>they've been around you know since the<br>80s and 90s and they've stood the test<br>of time so they've been adapted and used<br>by many academics they've been adapted<br>for studies into authenticity and gender<br>representation and gender diversity<br>they've been used by multiple multiple<br>academics and they give a nice what I<br>find when I work with teachers and<br>Librarians is they give a nice framework<br>for people to be able to pick up a book<br>and go okay there's there's diversity in<br>this book how do I know whether this is<br>authentic Etc and it really gives a<br>lovely framework so I'm going to talk<br>through those now now what I had to do<br>because this this is being recorded<br>um rather than have<br>um photos or images that I've taken from<br>the books I've had to go to the internet<br>and find these examples online so that<br>I'm because I I'm very conscious of<br>avoiding you know I've not breaching<br>copyright by taking photos of books so I<br>will be dragging things across Nicola<br>and I tested it out before<br>um and hopefully it will work now<br>um<br>with with these with these books<br>and then this is where I see how these<br>that the variation in terms work so<br>neutral and Melting Pot I'll show you<br>some two examples of this category so<br>the first one I'm just going to drag<br>across now<br>Nicola is that up nicely is that up<br>showing now<br>yes it is beautiful okay so this is from<br>a little book called<br>um Ben I think it's a visit to the<br>hospital excuse me for having the whole<br>screen showing there but if I go to the<br>large one it makes it difficult when I<br>drag it back across<br>um<br>and that's just as I was opening up this<br>morning that I got a little bit<br>surprised because and I'm going to have<br>to look at this later this illustration<br>which I use as the example has actually<br>changed so one of the key things I<br>wanted to point out to you is not there<br>anymore and I find that really<br>interesting so I'm going to look at when<br>this if this Edition was um was<br>published and and I might get back to<br>Nicola with what I find but I want you<br>just to have a look at this picture<br>first and<br>um have a look at representations of<br>racial diversity so just I'm going to<br>pause for a minute and let you have a<br>look<br>so hopefully you've noticed that there's<br>possibly it's possible that this this<br>nurse over here might be of Asian<br>ethnicity<br>but if you look closely you'll see that<br>there's one possibly two children that<br>are not white so they're there so we can<br>say there's representation in this book<br>but when you look a little bit further<br>um they are not they're sort of there<br>but they're just they could be taken out<br>so what how Bishop says she says<br>in culturally neutral Melting Pot the<br>the category the um the books are<br>essentially about something else so<br>taking that these characters out and<br>replacing them with a white character<br>would not change the story<br>what I find interesting is and I will<br>explain to this here in the original<br>book so if you can go find their 2005<br>book in your libraries folks go and find<br>this picture<br>in this one here this kid over here was<br>receiving a present so there was a<br>parent giving the child a present and<br>there was a a dark-skinned child here<br>with no visitors looking on<br>and there were more visitors in this<br>other picture and the the only kids that<br>didn't have visitors were the<br>dark-skinned children so it seems as if<br>the Publishers and the illustrators have<br>actually become more aware of this and<br>that these subtle messages that that<br>happen and I do believe happen<br>unwittingly I don't think for a minute<br>that um the illustrators are<br>deliberately doing this but<br>um so I know I'm giving you an example<br>here of culturally neutral but I'm also<br>using this<br>as a wow this thing has changed there is<br>another one later on<br>um I think it's here where I don't think<br>they've changed it just bear with me<br>here in the dining room now again I'm<br>going to pause for a minute and I want<br>you just to have a look you are looking<br>at the looking for the children with the<br>that are not white basically<br>so over here we've got if you look here<br>the children that are engaged and<br>involved in these pictures with the<br>adults are generally the white children<br>we've got a dark-skinned child over here<br>we've got one on his own reading over<br>here and even over here and again I<br>always say this could be me looking<br>overly critical to me this is almost<br>like well what's this oh my dear that's<br>vegetables I don't know if that's the<br>meaning but it's just very interesting<br>to see and look into<br>those deeper<br>messages that could be interpreted by<br>people who are watching these because of<br>reading these because<br>um<br>you know children yeah very young<br>children actually pay more attention to<br>the pictures than they do to the words<br>often and and they're often trying to<br>join those together so I think little<br>things like that we need to really look<br>at what are these books saying now I<br>will need to speed up a bit because I<br>spent I got so excited at the change in<br>that one<br>um the other type of story in in<br>culturally neutral Melting Pot this is<br>an example this is a fairly recent<br>publication in fact I think this was in<br>the study and this is called Maddie's<br>first day now if you took the people of<br>color out of this story you could<br>replace them with white and it wouldn't<br>change the story but<br>we have a people we have people of color<br>in the main as the main character and<br>also within this story The the father<br>here is uh the main carer the mother<br>goes off to work so what I'm trying to<br>illustrate here is that it's not about<br>these are good categories bad categories<br>Etc but interrogating what the stories<br>are so these books could be replaced<br>with white people and they wouldn't<br>change the actual story but the<br>inclusion of people of color actually<br>has it um provides those opportunities<br>for children to see themselves reflected<br>now the next category<br>is culturally generic socially conscious<br>now before I bring up the examples<br>in these at one end of this spectrum so<br>culturally well in both of these they're<br>usually written by mainstream authors so<br>usually written by a white middle class<br>authors<br>um<br>and they're written they're generally<br>written with for the majority<br>audience<br>about either about particularly at this<br>end about other cultures so I'll give<br>examples at this end of the spectrum now<br>um so this is from a series of books<br>that were interestingly published<br>when this first Australian early Years<br>Learning framework came out so around<br>2012<br>and they were written intentionally to<br>be able to give Educators the<br>opportunity to promote diversity now<br>so what they do is they reflect<br>children from diverse backgrounds and<br>I'm going to show you so I just want you<br>to think what you think about the<br>pictures number one<br>asking people where you come from is a<br>quite a fraught kind of a thing to say<br>in Multicultural societies because a lot<br>of people have lived in Australia for 20<br>or 30 years and or their whole life and<br>because of the color of their skin the<br>shape of their eyes their accent the<br>fact they speak more than one language<br>they're constantly asked where are you<br>from and it's a very very fraught thing<br>so I just have a little problem with the<br>title of the book but I want you to just<br>have a look we're from China we have<br>Dancing Dragons and you see this these<br>traditional stereotypical<br>representations<br>um now this one has a little bit more<br>contemporary representations but it's<br>like there has to be there almost has to<br>be these um<br>stereotypical kind of representations I<br>wish I could show you the Australian<br>picture which is the one I would use if<br>we weren't recording but it's got<br>um three children sitting on a on a<br>beach with the Opera House in the<br>background so don't even start me on<br>that because because and a koala hanging<br>over a tree<br>um but in the picture there's a little<br>Aboriginal boy and we know he's<br>Aboriginal because he's sitting on the<br>beach playing a didgeridoo<br>and then the two white children<br>um one's cooking a barbecue and the<br>other one is pointing at a sand castle<br>with that has a little Aboriginal flag<br>in it so it's almost so over the top and<br>what we often what I find often with<br>representation of uh First Nations<br>Australian is they are so often<br>positioned with a didgeridoo you know<br>with this Australian flag so it's like<br>it's this we have to we have to show<br>this so that's the notion of culturally<br>generic at the end of at the other end<br>of this category there's socially<br>conscious and so these books um<br>uh uh they had a socially conscious<br>message so you can see this this is an<br>absolutely beautiful book so again it's<br>not about making harsh judgments of<br>books you can see I I do have a little<br>bit of a problem with books that they<br>send to the Spectrum socially conscious<br>though they're usually written by<br>mainstream authors and they have this<br>socially conscious message so this book<br>is about two children of of different<br>ethnicities one likes to play with dolls<br>one likes to play with trucks it all<br>comes to a climax over arguing over<br>whether this this this doll can go in a<br>particular I think it's in a crane or<br>something<br>um it's a beautiful beautiful book it's<br>got nice messages about gender<br>stereotypes<br>um and this is what we call or Bishop<br>calls a socially conscious book<br>have a next category is culturally<br>authentic specific or conscious so in<br>these books these are books that are<br>usually written about uh by the by and<br>about the um the cultural race that the<br>book that the the main characters are<br>from<br>so um so it shines the light on the<br>journey and growing up as a member of<br>that culture and ethnicity and again<br>there is variation with them so at one<br>end we have stories that we might call<br>truth-telling stories so stories that<br>that talk about the history and<br>sometimes the challenges but of course<br>we don't<br>um First Nations groups and and<br>underrepresented groups have thriving<br>contemporary lives as well and those<br>stories are very important so that<br>brings me to the other books within this<br>category such as Maxine Beneva Clark's<br>the patchwork bike which is a story that<br>all children can relate to but it shines<br>the light on particular ethnicities and<br>their thriving cultural lives so there's<br>a lot of time giving you the background<br>to the categories so now let me tell you<br>what we found so<br>um<br>you can see here that we found<br>um<br>most of the books 33 of these books were<br>animal or other so again if you if you<br>look at at and there's no and I'm not<br>saying animal books animal stories are<br>are bad you know animal stories can<br>tackle sensitive topics<br>um their kids love animal stories they<br>connect with animals<br>um but if we're using animals as a proxy<br>for inclusivity as a proxy for saying<br>well I've got all these animal stories<br>so everyone's included we are not<br>increasing the opportunity for children<br>from underrepresentative good word<br>underrepresented backgrounds to see<br>themselves so<br>if you look we've got 19<br>um solely Caucasian 33 animals so again<br>if we add those together then we are<br>talking about over you know 52<br>um am I doing my maths right there 52 of<br>the books where they are those<br>mirrors for your white middle class kits<br>now when we go to culturally neutral<br>there's 25 so what we're seeing here<br>compared to my previous studies we're<br>getting if we look at these books here<br>around this side so 48 if I'm doing my<br>maths quickly and probably 48 do contain<br>representations of diversity so that's a<br>big shift compared to what I've found in<br>my previous studies but when we look<br>more closely we'll see that 25 of these<br>are culturally neutral so again they're<br>those books that include diversity but<br>they're not front center so the diverse<br>characters are usually background<br>they're Superfluous to the story but at<br>least they're there<br>um the cultural generic socially<br>conscious we've got six books and then<br>the culturally authentic seven which is<br>a a considerable Improvement on my<br>previous study now when I did a second<br>layer of analysis looking at the<br>viewpoints and ideologies in the book so<br>that's using I didn't explain that tool<br>but that's using the work of Gloria<br>boute to actually interrogate<br>the storylines the characters the the<br>messages<br>um the lifestyles what it shows is that<br>only that seven percent of authentic<br>authentic actually contain the<br>viewpoints of a non-majority cultural or<br>ethnic group so when we go talk again<br>about the mirrors then we're actually<br>talking 93 percent have those mirrors<br>for the majority group rather than only<br>seven percent for minority groups now<br>when we go to the minority groups<br>and break that down this is where we<br>look at the main character ethnicity and<br>you can see that there that for children<br>of color there's one book with an<br>Aboriginal main character there's one<br>with an Afghan main character and that's<br>set solely in Afghanistan there's one<br>with the Chinese main character there's<br>one we say Asian because we couldn't<br>determine the ethnicity so when you've<br>got classrooms full of children from<br>diverse backgrounds and there's one book<br>that might represent their background<br>that has the potential to present one<br>Viewpoint here we had we had to have a<br>category of people of color because many<br>of the characters in these culturally<br>neutral and culturally generic books you<br>couldn't actually tell apart from the<br>fact that they were characters of color<br>there was nothing else to determine or<br>represent<br>who they were or what their actual<br>ethnicities might be so<br>what that means for children is um<br>sorry I just find my spot here well I<br>just just lost my check a little bit<br>there<br>um what we have a little bit of a<br>concern with with this<br>um unidentifiable ethnicity so I'll just<br>go here where we couldn't actually tell<br>in this while it's positive you know as<br>I said it's positive that there is a<br>much more um diversity in these books<br>than has been seen before and this is a<br>growing Trend and this is positive news<br>I'm not trying to be completely negative<br>about things but lack of specificity of<br>characters of color<br>can imply a cultural homogeneity among<br>people of color and you know a couple of<br>these books were pencil drawings with<br>gray tones for skin color so we weren't<br>absolutely sure so we urge on the side<br>of saying we'll categorize these of<br>people of color and this may well be an<br>intentional Thing by the illustrators<br>because I or you know illustrators and<br>authors mainstream illustrators and<br>authors are very aware of this that's<br>why we're seeing this happening in books<br>and it is a positive thing that we are<br>seeing greater um<br>greater representation but when we're<br>coming to the opportunities for children<br>to see authentic representations it<br>becomes a little bit problematic we also<br>find that um<br>that in some of the books where there<br>were main characters of color the skin<br>tone was sometimes only marginally<br>darker than obvious Caucasian colors and<br>other Studies have found that<br>um characters of color especially child<br>characters are more likely to be drawn<br>with lighter skin tones than adult<br>characters of color and in general in<br>general characters color have lighter<br>skin tones in books than in real life so<br>these things are really important<br>um because while things are shifting<br>there is still it's almost like there's<br>hesitance within<br>um the creation of these books to be<br>authentic<br>um now on I'd like to note that we noted<br>the inadequacy of using terms like<br>people of color Asian Aboriginal and we<br>know that that may imply homogeneity as<br>well but this also highlights the Darth<br>of culturally diverse literature with so<br>few books containing cultural diverse<br>characters there's this risk of<br>stereotyping and marginalizing children<br>and this is particularly relevant for<br>First Nations groups now<br>We There are two books I want to talk<br>about today where we actually found<br>problematic representation now I want to<br>lead with this I am not saying I am not<br>a believer of book bands and I am not a<br>believer that these books should not be<br>put into the hands of children but they<br>should be used with critical Insight<br>um you know if you're following what's<br>happening in the US you know there's<br>some very concerning things about book<br>Banning and I am absolutely don't<br>believe in book banning at all but I do<br>believe in critical use of of books and<br>in the adults having conversations with<br>children so let me show you what I find<br>problematic the first one<br>is a lovely little book called why I<br>love summer<br>um it's a very nostalgic book I will<br>bring it up in a minute nostalgic book<br>and for a kid that you know Australian<br>girl that grew up in the 60s and 70s<br>it's my childhood you know it stays at<br>the beach it's Beach Cricket it's eating<br>ice creams and so on and the book itself<br>has a lot of diversity in it it's got<br>interracial families it just has this<br>wonderful show of diverse Society so my<br>my the the issue we found was not with<br>the story itself but it was actually<br>with the end papers which I'm bringing<br>across now now unfortunately it's a<br>little bit hard to see because it's a<br>YouTube link<br>but I want you just to have a quick look<br>and I want to point out due to time I<br>will point out if you look down here you<br>can't actually see the name it's an<br>Eskimo donut and you'll see here this<br>little representation of a First Nations<br>Inuit person called an Eskimo which is a<br>a highly offensive term or considered a<br>highly offensive term by most Inuit<br>people the representation of the happy<br>eternally happy optimistic<br>um a little Eskimo is something that is<br>very problematic in fact you know there<br>used to be a dessert called Eskimo Pie<br>in America that has changed its name<br>um you know that we've had so these<br>these kind of things into children's<br>book can be problematic because it's<br>promoting an outdated<br>stereotype that is known to lead to<br>misconceptions now other ones in there<br>things like chalk pants Berry bananas<br>this representation here is when I<br>showed this to some of my colleagues in<br>the US they were horrified because this<br>kind of representation here is often<br>used as a slur or a misrepresentation of<br>of African<br>um the diaspora people things like chalk<br>pants<br>um and then the sushi pole Aztec Frosty<br>that and I don't just we have when I do<br>these analysis I don't just go what do I<br>think I consult with people from these<br>ethnicities and these have been<br>highlighted by people from these<br>backgrounds as potentially<br>damaging a potentially harmful or that<br>can contribute to misunderstanding and<br>Prejudice<br>the other one is a book called and again<br>you know it's about that critical<br>understanding and use<br>the other one<br>um is a book called if I was prime<br>minister now it has each double page<br>spread has a different kid from a<br>different background saying if I was<br>prime minister I would do this and that<br>so on a lovely<br>socially conscious book<br>but here's the problem<br>in the page where they have an<br>Aboriginal child I'm Ben if I was prime<br>minister if I was prime minister I would<br>make sure that once in a while we all<br>get together for a corrobory now we're<br>Gravely concerned about the<br>representation here and I consulted with<br>academics in our karingal catagen Center<br>for indigenous research<br>um about this and this is is concerning<br>in that it completely misrepresents the<br>sacred cultural ritual of a corrobory<br>now a corrobori is a sacred ritual there<br>are some variations between different<br>cultural Aboriginal groups in Australia<br>but traditionally and most commonly<br>these are performed mostly by men there<br>are some female corrobories but they are<br>sacred dance and ritual they are not<br>campfires they are not toasting<br>marshmallows and they are certainly not<br>open for all of us to come along once in<br>a while for a corrobory it's very rare<br>for majority people to be invited to<br>corrobris so the misrepresentation here<br>is quite alarming because for the<br>children from the ethnicity for the<br>Aboriginal children in those classrooms<br>they're seeing something that is sacred<br>and special to them<br>misrepresented and for the majority<br>children they're potentially gaining<br>misunderstandings about our first<br>Nations people<br>so I'm very much aware that I'm running<br>short of time so I'll come back here<br>um and<br>yes this those ones so I want to sort of<br>finish that I've sort of summed up what<br>we found there<br>um and I've really talked about the<br>findings much that much of the way<br>through that the the implications for<br>this much of the way through that it's<br>really really important that uh firstly<br>on a positive note we're seeing this<br>increase but secondly it's very<br>important for um<br>for anyone involved in the publishing<br>industry as well to be aware of this you<br>know and as I said I think authors and<br>illustrators are very much aware of this<br>but Publishers perhaps need to work a<br>little more closely or with authors when<br>it particularly in relation to<br>representation of First Nations people<br>with some some Consulting you know and I<br>think we're having the voice to<br>Parliament referendum this year I think<br>there's a need for for people to be<br>looking for the voices and impacts of<br>groups if they're hoping to represent<br>them in their books and this is why it's<br>important to have those authentic books<br>written by the the groups themselves so<br>that we can put these into the hands of<br>children<br>um<br>and and also going back to book awards<br>it it does it is perhaps a little<br>concerning now these books did not win<br>the awards I don't know whether whether<br>this was picked up in the judging I<br>don't know<br>um but you know it's interesting to see<br>that<br>um that perhaps this there is a need for<br>consideration<br>um but I want to finish on a couple of<br>positive notes firstly<br>um this is a little story from one of my<br>my students from a couple of years ago<br>who'd done my children's literature unit<br>and she tutors a little Muslim girl and<br>after attending my classes she thought<br>I'm going to find a book an authentic<br>culturally authentic book about uh child<br>for the Muslim religion and she found<br>the book called The Rainbow hijab and<br>she read it to this child and that she<br>the little child was so excited and as<br>my student said I was confused and asked<br>if she had read it before because she<br>seemed so interested<br>and she turned to me and said I didn't<br>know they made books about Muslim girls<br>like me I think this really shows you<br>know this is a little girl nine years<br>old who'd never seen herself in a book<br>never seen her represented and these<br>things can be life-changing and that's<br>why it's so important to to get these<br>books to call for and Advocate the<br>increase in increasing diverse books and<br>authentic books in particular written by<br>and about the people of diverse culture<br>so that multiple books multiple<br>representations can be put into their<br>hands<br>um these are some positive signs coming<br>out from the CCBC where you can see that<br>there are gradual increases in this<br>particular representations they've<br>started looking more closely at<br>representations of lgbtq<br>um and I'll finish with Australia and<br>this was when last year's book awards<br>were put out that the head of<br>um<br>of the Australian book children's book<br>Council said that these Australian book<br>creators are responding to the thirst<br>for colorful powerful stories that<br>reflect our evolving eclectic and<br>beautifully diverse culture with their<br>sincere deep and reflective quality<br>voices and illustrate and prowess the<br>2022 cbca book of the Year awards are<br>truly a window to Australia's<br>contemporary culture excuse the typo<br>there so you can see that the<br>understandings are growing there's a<br>great cause for Hope<br>um but there I still think there is a<br>long way a long way to go and I I think<br>we celebrate the fact that most authors<br>are very aware of this and trying to do<br>something about it but also it is so<br>important that<br>um that we need the authentic diverse<br>authors voices that's the diverse<br>authors writing about their own people<br>that needs to be promoted more broadly<br>because it's those books that give those<br>authentic representations<br>so<br>um I will just finish this as me if you<br>want to look me up if you want to read<br>about my recent Fellowship children's<br>Fellowship Churchill Fellowship you can<br>um I'm on LinkedIn and there's blogs on<br>there but I'll stop there and um Nicola<br>if there's any questions or discussions<br>jump in and and let me know<br>thank you very much that was just really<br>really interesting<br>um and lovely to see you know the<br>developments since you'll work on your<br>PhD Helen<br>um I've got I've just reminded people<br>that if you have questions pop them in<br>the chat area I'm going to kick off by<br>just um I don't know if it's a question<br>or a reflection or letting you know that<br>um a little<br>um Nick and Chrissy who are here today<br>and I had a summer scholar who worked<br>with us last year looking at<br>representations of diversity in<br>children's picture books published in<br>New Zealand in 2022 so we're of course<br>listening very closely to to your<br>findings<br>um and um and I went and and so we<br>haven't finished<br>um and making doing the analysis um one<br>of the things we grappled with as we did<br>the analysis was<br>um was avoiding conflating skin color<br>and ethnicity and I wondered if you'd<br>had any comment to make on that yeah<br>yeah look I think that's a it's it's a<br>it's a kind of a fraught kind of area<br>you know when you start looking at at at<br>these areas and I think<br>um<br>that's why I I sort of in a lot of ways<br>um use the word race now we know that<br>race is a social construct you know and<br>that um<br>you know race races often has been used<br>and science has been misused for years<br>to you know to label people of color and<br>all based on skin tone or no shape or I<br>think you know and make judgment you<br>know inaccurate and false<br>representations of of what that means<br>but<br>um<br>that's why I sort of try and follow<br>Bishop because she's she sort of says<br>she uses<br>um skin color because it is the most it<br>is one of the most divisive is if not<br>the most divisive issue and I think I<br>still you know it's still just gobsmacks<br>me that you know we're in the<br>the the you know the the the New<br>Millennium and everything and and we<br>still have such Prejudice and bigotry<br>based on how someone looks but yeah um<br>to to go into ethnicity and culture and<br>so on there's so many different terms<br>around there so and when you're looking<br>at a book<br>um<br>and doing a study such as I've done<br>um I that's why I tend to for this study<br>to look at uh you know the the visible<br>features rather than<br>um<br>rather than specific<br>um ethnicities cultures Etc yeah<br>um I haven't I haven't got any questions<br>coming up so I've got I've got more<br>because I could just talk to you forever<br>I have got I have got something coming<br>up here we go so Candace um says thank<br>you this is so wonderful I look forward<br>to seeing the gender diversity findings<br>as my interest area as well do you think<br>diversity awards that are emerging will<br>help for example the Wilderness Society<br>Karachi<br>category and literature Awards and the<br>dance diversity Awards with Walker books<br>I think that they're I think that<br>they're important because they're<br>showing this this important<br>understanding<br>um and I think there is you know there's<br>certainly a step in the right direction<br>um<br>the only the only danger is that you<br>know is is if judging panel's goal well<br>they've got this diverse books have got<br>their special award we don't need to<br>consider that in<br>um<br>you know and and and put potentially<br>overlook<br>books um you know in in in the in the<br>more broad spectrum General Awards so I<br>haven't seen any evidence of that<br>happening I know in the children's book<br>Council Awards in Australia<br>um and that they have an announcement<br>for this year but the um the short list<br>is is you know increasingly diverse and<br>so on but you know I do think I do think<br>specific Awards certainly have their<br>place and certainly help to promote<br>um promote you know continue to promote<br>but again I'd be concerned if it just<br>became these Awards and these Awards<br>because that you know sometimes if you<br>if you have a particular label then it<br>can actually go well it's for these and<br>then there's the other so I think we<br>need to be careful of that<br>thank you<br>um<br>yes um yeah Candace is saying that<br>that's what I wanted as well it's a<br>balance isn't it yeah it is a balance I<br>I heard you talking about the need um to<br>and to encourage<br>and well if we're talking about<br>representations of indigeneity for<br>example as one of the examples of<br>diversity<br>um that that it's important well there<br>are a lot of Gatekeepers out there and<br>um one of the ways around uh to<br>encourage diversity is to ensure you<br>have diversity involved and published in<br>the publishing of books and I wondered<br>if you wanted to comment on that other I<br>I know you've got several um very<br>well-known indigenous Publishers of<br>children's literature in Australia I<br>wondered we've got<br>um mega bile books in in Western<br>Australia here based up in Broome and<br>they've actually just won a big award<br>for<br>um forget who it's with but they've just<br>won a big award for for being one of the<br>best children's Publishers<br>um so yeah I do think it's it's very<br>very important and I think uh book book<br>companies that are specifically<br>publishing indigenous books you know is<br>really fantastic but it is also<br>important and it is it is a growing<br>thing where um you know the more you<br>know you're more bigger bigger<br>publishing houses like Walker books and<br>so on uh Fremantle press is is very<br>frame how to press is is very keen on on<br>diverse uh publishing so it's it's<br>definitely growing but again within you<br>know I've seen other studies I haven't<br>done studies myself on the publishing<br>industry but I've seen other studies<br>where you know<br>um the publishing industry and a lot of<br>The Gatekeepers are also overwhelmingly<br>white middle class Gatekeepers and so<br>not necessarily replacing those people<br>but you know encouraging diversity in<br>every step of the the publishing process<br>and the voices you know the voices of<br>people is very very important um you<br>know I have read<br>um read cases of<br>um of of<br>underrepresented you know or you know<br>authors from specific ethnicities<br>writing or backgrounds writing books and<br>and submitting them and being told well<br>we really like your book but we've<br>already published an Asian book this<br>year you know and and the Asian book was<br>actually written the one they published<br>was written by a white author so you<br>know there's there's it is um<br>it's a tricky one because you know there<br>are some<br>um there was one fairly big name author<br>I don't want to mention their name at<br>the moment but earlier this year who<br>came out goes I can write about whatever<br>I want and you know I could be trans and<br>I can beat this and I can be black and I<br>can be whatever and you know it's like<br>yeah no one can tell an author what to<br>write about but the argument here is<br>um is that it's not just about the fact<br>that we need diversity in books we need<br>the diverse authors we're neither<br>diverse voices we need the authentic<br>experience and it's not that an author<br>can't do a good job of representing<br>someone else's story because that's what<br>fiction is but<br>um it's that the children the families<br>the communities<br>need and deserve their own stories and<br>for such a long time particularly with<br>First Nations peoples the stories have<br>been told about them<br>and by majority people so it's<br>absolutely critical that we have the<br>respect<br>to step back and give give these people<br>their platform<br>and their opportunities to be the voices<br>for their own communities<br>um you know so and on questions coming<br>in here yeah shall I actually bring<br>those in Helen or did you need to see<br>yeah yeah no that's fine<br>um Emma um Emma released and Marianne<br>just letting you know I've got all your<br>questions Emma asks I might have missed<br>it but in your sample Victoria wasn't in<br>there was there a reason how did you<br>I can't actually remember off the top of<br>my head why why and and it may well may<br>well have been it was it was sort of<br>like what are the biggest picture what<br>are the biggest book awards so I would<br>have to go back and make sure maybe I've<br>left that off but we looked at what were<br>the most the biggest ones within you<br>know in Australia so<br>um and you know a lot of those books in<br>fact most of those books were on one or<br>two of those different lists as well so<br>um so it could well be that all the<br>books that were on that list may have<br>already been in one of the other ones I<br>can't actually specifically remember off<br>the top of my head<br>um but yeah yeah okay renesa asks thanks<br>for sharing the data statistics I hope<br>they serve as a Meriter publishing<br>companies to support more diverse<br>literature I'm an Indian immigrant to<br>New Zealand now a children book author<br>and diversity equity and an inclusion<br>consultant who focuses on Multicultural<br>characters and my stories<br>so that's just a nice comment then<br>diversity you know yeah it's great so<br>fantastic that's very exciting yes yeah<br>Marianne asks about tokenism in books<br>some of the books I've read give me an<br>uncomfortable sense of trying to be so<br>correct they aren't enjoyable to read<br>and children really don't like them yep<br>um perhaps having diverse authors and<br>illustrators is the answer yeah and<br>that's absolutely true and you know<br>children are the best the biggest the<br>best critical critics of children's<br>books and you know in in my other<br>studies and in my PhD I talk a lot more<br>about tokenistic representation and very<br>often they are those culturally generic<br>books<br>um and they often have these characters<br>wearing traditional costumes or doing<br>traditional things or you know or or<br>it's just so so false um that they you<br>know you can see that is it is<br>tokenistic and you're right they're<br>they're not only harmful but<br>um yeah often children children can see<br>can see straight through them so I agree<br>with you there and yet diverse authors<br>and illustrators is the answer and<br>um you know books published always have<br>to be high quality you know they've got<br>to be great stories and so on but it's<br>it's very important that<br>um diverse authors and illustrators have<br>the platform and have the opportunity<br>um and that yeah so that's my sort of<br>main message there yeah although you<br>think you've got a lot of people in<br>support<br>um we've come coming to the end of our<br>time Helen so it just remains for me to<br>thank you very much on behalf of all of<br>us for taking the time to share your<br>work with us today it's really important<br>stuff you and I both know that and<br>everybody here knows that children's<br>literature is so powerful people always<br>underestimate it but it actually is the<br>a time when children are forming<br>attitudes<br>um yeah and as you say looking very<br>carefully at what is in what is in<br>pictures that adults sometimes Miss<br>um so yeah absolutely yeah thanks so<br>much for sharing on behalf of the wealth<br>Malcolm Institute for educational<br>research and the waikato picture book<br>research<br>um<br>um Institute I thank you very much and<br>um look forward to meeting you in person<br>soon um<br>yeah again it will be lovely there are<br>lots of thank yous and fascinating thank<br>you so much lots of lovely comments<br>coming through so thank you everybody so<br>much everybody the lovely comments all</p></main><footer style="margin-top: 2rem; background: #0001; padding: 2rem; text-align: center;"><p>We Are The University</p><ul style="list-style-type: none;
