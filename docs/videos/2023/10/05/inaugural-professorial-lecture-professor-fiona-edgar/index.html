of the good employer<br>obligation<br>This research reviewed the good employer<br>directive under the state sector Act<br>1988 on HRM Human Resource Management<br>outlining implications for practitioners<br>critiquing the importance placed on HRM<br>and the quality of the HRM practice and<br>assessing their contribution to employee<br>well-being<br>this has continued to be the research<br>thread throughout Professor Edgar's<br>academic career<br>after graduating with her PhD Professor<br>Edgar began as a teaching assistant and<br>a bright future doctoral fellow in the<br>department of management before becoming<br>a lecturer in 2003<br>she was then promoted up through the<br>ranks<br>to senior lecturer and then associate<br>professor and now full

management a role that<br>she continues in today<br>as already stated a promotion to full<br>professor at the University of otago is<br>not a step taken lightly you must excel<br>in all three areas of the role teaching<br>research and service Professor Edgar has<br>certainly achieved this over her career<br>as an academic<br>as a leader in research on human<br>resource management Professor Edgar<br>seeks to understand how the workforce is<br>best managed while at the same time<br>promoting worker and workplace<br>well-being<br>professors Edgar's research was some of<br>the first to acknowledge employees as<br>important HRM stakeholders and her<br>highly cited and award-winning research<br>has informed various stakeholders<br>including employers practitioners and<br>students<br>Professor Edgar publishes in the top<br>journals in her field and serves on<br>editorial boards as well as co-chairing<br>conferences<br>she has developed and maintained a wide<br>International collaborative Network in<br>which she has developed her HRM Research<br>into cross-cultural contexts<br>Professor Edgar not only excels at<br>research but is an experienced and<br>outstanding teacher<br>teaching across all levels Professor<br>Edgar's teaching is extremely well<br>received by students she is an excellent<br>communicator and innovator of teaching<br>material having received excellent<br>feedback and teaching accolades across<br>and throughout her teaching career<br>Professor Edgar continues to lead course<br>design and development and has been<br>instrumental in developing new programs<br>for the division of Commerce including<br>the development of the HRM diploma for<br>graduates in the distance master of<br>sustainable Business program<br>Professor Edgar has an impressive<br>supervision profile and I know as a<br>passionate supervisor of many PhD and<br>DBA students as well as mcom Embers and<br>MBA students<br>Professor Edgar's service commitments<br>have been wide and Reaching Across the<br>management department the division of<br>Commerce and the University<br>she has been the head of the Department<br>at which time she led a large Department<br>specifically around prioritizing<br>cultural competencies and developing and<br>implementing an equitable workload model<br>I can certainly attest to Professor<br>Edgar's very collegial Manner and<br>working with other heads of departments<br>and fellow colleagues and sharing ideas<br>and initiatives within the division<br>prior to taking on the head of<br>Department role Professor Edgar was the<br>associate Dean postgraduate for the<br>division of Commerce for three years in<br>which time she developed and led<br>induction programs for students<br>developed strategic imperatives for<br>post-grad students and commerce and<br>represented the division on a large<br>number of University and divisional<br>committees<br>Professor Edgar

professorial lecture<br>please welcome Professor Fiona Edgar<br>namihinui<br>okay<br>Fiona Edgar takawangawa Roto e<br>tomataranga bacaharare i warmly welcome<br>you here today to my inaugural<br>professorial lecture thank you Marie for<br>that very very warm introduction kind<br>introduction and I would like to thank<br>you all for joining me here on this very<br>so I would like to dedicate my IPL to a<br>special group of family and friends and<br>colleagues who are no longer with us oh<br>we're very supportive of my study and my<br>career and they would be very proud to<br>see me standing here today<br>so the first is my father who sadly<br>passed away just before my PhD was<br>completed so conferred so he passed away<br>during<br>um the examination process<br>the second person there is my favorite<br>uncle we all have a favorite uncle and<br>Bill was my favorite uncle I was the<br>first in our family to successfully<br>complete my study at the University and<br>my uncle was particularly loud and proud<br>about that<br>I also have a dear friend Bernie Hines<br>who passed away earlier this year from<br>cancer again very very supportive of my<br>career<br>and last and importantly this is Mary<br>Mallon and Mary was my PhD supervisor<br>Barry came to otago from the UK where<br>she had had previously a career as a<br>practitioner she was an absolutely<br>amazing person she was very energetic<br>very charismatic and she was very<br>quickly promoted through two Professor<br>ending up at Massey University in<br>Palmerston North<br>Mary was heaps of fun she had a love of<br>socializing she like Marie and others<br>also had a love of fashion and she is a<br>was a great loss to our academic<br>community so I know she would be very<br>so just in terms of the format of my<br>lecturer the first<br>um I'm going to talk to you about some<br>of my formative workplace experiences<br>because these have really underpinned<br>what I went on to research as an<br>academic of then present and overview of<br>the different research themes which I've<br>pursued during my academic career and<br>then I want to conclude by acknowledging<br>family friends and also colleagues who<br>have supported me throughout my academic<br>career<br>all right so in terms of background I<br>was a very late starter to Academia and<br>it would be fair to say that I am very<br>much an accidental Professor so<br>initially it was my close friend<br>Catherine who inspired me to take up<br>University study she had that neck of<br>making studying while raising a family a<br>very young family and working as well<br>look very easy of course that was very<br>deceiving it wasn't an easy defeat at<br>all and I'm pleased I survived it<br>when I look back and reflect on those<br>years now I couldn't have achieved what<br>I did without my mum<br>in the support of my daughters but more<br>on that later<br>so while it was Catherine that<br>encouraged me to study it was my early<br>work experiences an industry that really<br>ignited my passion for studying people<br>management and it was also these<br>experiences that went on to shape My<br>Views about employment relationships<br>between managers and workers in the<br>workplace so I just want to give you<br>some context as to what those work<br>experiences entailed<br>so I went into the workforce in the<br>early 1980s and one of my roles was<br>working in an administrative function<br>and a large home appliance manufacturer<br>that made ovens and dishwashers<br>I then moved on in the mid 1980s to work<br>for a large clothing retailer which is<br>all I'm doing very well today in the<br>head office and that organization also<br>had a warehouse function as part of it<br>and then in the late 1980s and the start<br>of through to the start of the early<br>1990s I worked for a large manufacturing<br>organization that made Taps and showers<br>this was however a very interesting time<br>for managers and for workers this was a<br>period in which the New Zealand economy<br>had become deregulated tariff<br>protections had been removed and<br>organizations were really struggling to<br>remain competitive and so they had to<br>think very carefully about what it was<br>they were going to do so that they could<br>survive and grow if they were lucky so<br>as you can imagine this was a very<br>tumultuous period for businesses and it<br>was a period which was characterized by<br>a lot of uncertainty and change both for<br>managers but for workers as well<br>and so in that first organization that<br>closed the second one relocated up to<br>Auckland and the third one had a series<br>of redundancies and then eventually<br>closed as well<br>so as you can imagine those experiences<br>made for some very interesting work<br>stories so in some cases I watched these<br>events from the sidelines and other<br>cases I was privy to the inner Circles<br>of decision making but although not part<br>of the decision making and in others I<br>was personally involved so just um to<br>give you some ideas of the things that<br>happened during one retrenchment<br>situation I can recall the union boss<br>I'm charging through a set of um<br>Swinging Doors into a factory setup and<br>ordering the workforce out onto the<br>street so he called them all out and had<br>them all um congregate on the street and<br>he did that with the union with doing<br>that to let the management of their<br>organization know that they were not<br>going to sit by and idly watch as<br>workers were losing their jobs<br>and that same organization there were<br>also incidents of sabotage with the<br>Machinery getting filled up with super<br>glue and whatnot so that there were<br>quite serious things going on<br>likewise in the retailing organization<br>that I worked with again in a voice to<br>lift management know that they weren't<br>going to set idly by with job losses on<br>the um near future or on the horizon<br>there was quite a lot of theft and there<br>was a gym located next door and people<br>from the gym would say you know is it is<br>it normal for all that stuff to be<br>getting fired out the back windows of<br>that organization and of course it<br>wasn't but you know I mean to<br>Management's um credit they turned a<br>blind diet to it anyway<br>on a more positive note I had the<br>privilege of sitting around the table in<br>one of the organizations as a<br>representative of the workforce<br>negotiating team well we negotiated the<br>redundancy for the organization that was<br>relocating to Auckland and so that<br>provided me with some very interesting<br>insights into managers thoughts I guess<br>and the thoughts on employees and also<br>just in terms of the employment<br>relationship<br>least positive however was or were my<br>experiences when I returned to work<br>after having children<br>so as a working mother I returned to<br>work I'm out of financial necessity and<br>this was at a time when not all embraced<br>the notion of working mothers so I found<br>that quite a challenging quite a<br>confronting time and I'm pleased to say<br>that as I watch my daughters and their<br>Partners manage the parenting roles and<br>work and balance their work and family<br>life that things have very much changed<br>and very much changed for the better so<br>it is very heartening to see that we<br>have come a very long way in that regard<br>so when Shannon my youngest daughter was<br>aged one I commenced full-time study at<br>University and one of the subjects that<br>I studied was management and there was a<br>lot about that subject which really<br>resonated well with my past work<br>experiences and I particularly enjoyed<br>learning about employment relations and<br>human resource management and just<br>because those two areas are integral to<br>the rest of my presentation I'll just<br>explain briefly they're Broad<br>underpinnings and what they refer to<br>so employment relations is a pluralist<br>discipline so it acknowledges that there<br>are different parties in the employment<br>relationship and sometimes those parties<br>have similar objectives and sometimes<br>those objectives um can come into<br>conflict with each other<br>so for example you may find in terms of<br>managers and workers that all both of<br>them both parties want good levels of<br>productivity and both obviously want the<br>organization to survive and be<br>successful<br>but in other cases you might find that<br>employees want High wages they want good<br>working conditions and this may at some<br>stages conflict with managers or<br>employers of organizations who may be<br>looking to maximize or optimize their<br>returns for shareholders so this can<br>lead to inevitable conflict and so given<br>the workplace experiences that I had<br>through that period of the 80s and early<br>90s<br>it was very much a perspective I guess<br>that resonated with me I I saw that<br>pluralism at play in the workplace<br>in the other discipline that I really<br>enjoyed studying was human resource<br>management and that's essentially<br>concerned with how managers manage their<br>Workforce so that their organization can<br>be successful and achieve its objectives<br>and so while I did not share the unitary<br>underpinnings of human resource<br>management what I did except was the<br>notion that you can have functional<br>areas selection training and development<br>Performance Management rewards and the<br>like and that if you implement those<br>practices in those areas effectively<br>then it will have some benefit to your<br>organization in terms of helping it be<br>successful<br>foreign<br>study and I moved into postgraduate<br>study I became increasingly interested<br>in trying to meld aspects of improvement<br>relations and human resource management<br>and to a view which saw both both<br>managers and workers getting something<br>out of the employment relationship so<br>that both could flourish in the<br>employment relationship<br>so it was the suggestion of in mcandrew<br>my PhD supervisor that I chose to<br>investigate whether we could regulate<br>for best practice and Human Resource<br>Management<br>and to this end I examined is Marie<br>kindly said section 56 of the state<br>Sector 8 which was an obligation to be a<br>good employer and just a note there that<br>that act has now been replaced with the<br>public service act 2020 and section 73<br>very much mirrors section 56 so so not a<br>lot has changed there<br>all right so just so that you know what<br>an obligation to be a good employer<br>looks like it is one where our chief<br>Executives working in the public sector<br>are required to have HRM policies and<br>practices that ensure that there is a<br>partiality and selection that the<br>working environment is a good and safe<br>one for employees that there is an equal<br>employment opportunities program in<br>place and that the HR import policies<br>and practices ensure that the aims<br>aspirations and employment requirements<br>of Maori ethnic minority groups women<br>and people with disabilities are<br>recognized so kpis are essentially put<br>in place with the performance of Chief<br>Executives measured against those kpis<br>which<br>right so<br>I PhD did effectively find that section<br>56 was effective<br>and it was significant in terms of<br>policy development and those legislated<br>areas and also particularly in the area<br>of eeo the outcomes were particularly<br>good for the public service<br>so yes I found that you could indeed<br>regulate for best practice in human<br>however whilst my thesis was consumed<br>with examining the notion that we could<br>regulate for HRM efficacy the main<br>contribution of my study was that I had<br>introduced employees voice into the data<br>collection process<br>so previously in terms of looking at HRM<br>efficacy or the effectiveness of HRM<br>policies and practices<br>we would go out as researchers and we<br>would use a single or singular data<br>source so we would ask HR managers to<br>comment on their HRM policies and to<br>comment on their efficacy<br>and so I found that problematic so along<br>with others as well it was a problematic<br>because we're effectively asking HR<br>managers to comment on their own<br>performance they put the HR practices in<br>place and we're asking them if they're<br>effective of course they're going to say<br>they are so we found that problematic so<br>our approach or my Approach<br>um was the view that if you want to find<br>out of HRM as effective or not you also<br>need to ask employees about HRM efficacy<br>so you need to ask employees about the<br>practices because if an employee finds a<br>particular practice related to Rewards<br>or training development recruitment<br>selection if they find it or they have a<br>negative experience with it then it's<br>likely that that practice is not going<br>to be effective in delivering what it's<br>supposed to deliver for the organization<br>so yeah so I guess the the main<br>contribution of that study was that it<br>introduced the employee's voice into HRM<br>data collection and assessing HRM<br>efficacy<br>so maintaining this emphasis on<br>understanding how employees can bless<br>best flourish at work my next research<br>thread focused around employees<br>well-being<br>in terms of employees well well-being<br>employee well-being and the emphasis was<br>very much on well-being as an end in<br>itself so we measured well-being looking<br>at job satisfaction commitment<br>engagement and we looked at it as an end<br>in itself<br>so you know can we facilitate employees<br>well-being whereas This research was<br>concerned with looking at the extent to<br>which employee well-being was not only<br>an end in itself but it was also a<br>contributor to the organization and its<br>productivity performance profit and<br>growth and so this was a view that our<br>researchers have referred to as Mutual<br>gains so there are mutual gains gains<br>for the organization and gains for the<br>employee<br>and also just another note there when<br>looking at well-being I'd reviewed a<br>number of government reports that were<br>written at the time and I generally<br>found that in those government reports<br>whilst they made you know a lot of<br>mentions in terms of well-being it was<br>primarily about the physical well-being<br>of employees and I wanted to broaden<br>that conception or notion of well-being<br>so that it also included our social and<br>So This research found that HRM did play<br>a key role in promoting well-being<br>outcomes and that these in turn impacted<br>our task performance which is our job<br>related performance and also our<br>contextual performance was those helping<br>behaviors that we can engage in in the<br>workplace to help our colleagues<br>so our finding of that connection whilst<br>that was important of more significance<br>and interest really was our finding that<br>different well-being outcomes supported<br>different performance at performance<br>outcomes<br>and specifically what we found was that<br>HRM systems could be designed to support<br>trust and happiness and that where you<br>look to support trust and happiness or<br>where HRM practices were designed to<br>support trust and happiness then those<br>were good or great contributors to<br>Performance so along with looking after<br>the job satisfaction commitment and<br>engagement of employees we encouraged<br>practitioners to also address the trust<br>and happiness aspects of well-being as<br>well<br>all right so as you can see by the<br>heading on the slide some of my research<br>could appear to be going down a rabbit<br>hole or a side alley and I confess that<br>some of my projects did start along<br>these lines because I personally found<br>the subject matter either topical<br>interesting or most likely both<br>but always as I investigated a topic it<br>always linked back to that HRM<br>well-being performance relationship that<br>I had built my research career on and<br>this was no different for the study on<br>alcohol<br>so alcohol consumption as you will<br>appreciates an issue that is often<br>covered by the media and at the time of<br>conducting this study there was<br>significant media attention that was<br>focused on looking at the societal and<br>Community issues that were manifesting<br>so as researchers we noted that whilst<br>there was a lot of attention focused on<br>the community and on society very little<br>was being said about what the effects<br>that this might be having in the<br>workplace itself and so teaming up with<br>my colleague Ian mcandrew and health<br>Economist Trudy Sullivan who is not only<br>a very respected colleague of mine but<br>also a long time friend and also my<br>former flatmate we developed a project<br>that looked at the impact of alcohol in<br>the workplace and there were three areas<br>that we focused on so we were looking at<br>behaviors we were looking at<br>foreign<br>so socially alcohol in the workplace can<br>be seen as a bit of a positive thing as<br>a social lubricant it can help with<br>collegiality it can help with Team<br>Building<br>so with this in mind we thought we would<br>collect insights and work stories from a<br>sample of nearly 200 New Zealand<br>employees about social events that they<br>had attended in recent years and these<br>work stories painted a picture which<br>suggested that the work social event was<br>so we found alcohol at social events was<br>being connected to a high rate of<br>concerning behaviors including such<br>things as giving people a shove a lot of<br>aggression and civility rudeness and<br>bullying sexual harassment and also at<br>the more extreme ends of the scale there<br>was physical and verbal assaults as well<br>so as a consequence of those findings we<br>sought to offer what we referred to as<br>some Sage advice for employees and<br>employers<br>so in terms of employees we suggested to<br>them in the media that they should know<br>their own limits and that they should<br>stay well within those limits<br>for employers we recommended that they<br>understand their obligations to<br>employees on work social occasions they<br>develop good policies to address those<br>social occasions and also really<br>importantly that they establish good<br>drinking um good drinking norms for<br>their employees so that these behaviors<br>don't get out of hand<br>and then of course we reminded everyone<br>attending work social events that those<br>events are really just an extension of<br>the workplace itself and so the same<br>standard of behavior is expected within<br>or at those occasions as we might expect<br>all right so I'm sure it comes as no<br>surprise to anyone here that alcohol<br>creates problems and those problems<br>result in significant costs to the<br>economy however the amount of that cost<br>may surprise you and this was what we<br>investigated in the next study<br>so the second project that came out of<br>the study was led by Trudy Sullivan and<br>aimed to quantify the costs of<br>alcohol-related issues in terms of<br>productivity<br>and as as a result of some very um<br>complex statistical analyzes that truly<br>generated we estimated that the cost of<br>employees drinking was leading to<br>productivity losses of around<br>1.65 billion dollars to New Zealand<br>organizations per year<br>interestingly some of that cost and<br>that's 1.65 billion related to<br>co-workers so it was the problems that<br>the stress and the disruption that our<br>co-workers experienced from someone<br>else's drinking behaviors so it's not<br>just the individual and their loss of<br>productivity it was the effect and the<br>impact that they were having on others<br>that was quite a significant contributor<br>to that figure that we have there<br>so our Hope was that<br>organizations might take note of the<br>significant cost that alcohol can have<br>on organizations and on individuals and<br>also because we spend such a lot of our<br>time at the workplace we hoped that<br>employers might make this a forum where<br>they could engage in education about<br>alcohol-related education for their<br>employees with the hope that that would<br>have some community and societal benefit<br>as well as of course benefiting the<br>organization as well and there is some<br>research which suggests that the<br>workplace is a beneficial forum for<br>making that sort of or undertaking that<br>sort of Education<br>so on a positive note recently in the<br>media there have been a few commentaries<br>around alcohol consumption and it would<br>appear that the drinking behaviors of<br>the generations coming behind us may not<br>suffer from some of the same issues that<br>the generations that<br>have<br>followed them<br>all right and then just one final<br>comment I would like to make about that<br>study it received a significant amount<br>of media attention so we fronted the<br>national radio news and also the TV news<br>and I would like to acknowledge the<br>great work they're in and Trudy both did<br>in fronting the media for that project<br>foreign<br>so as you can see from the study on<br>alcohol emotions are important so my<br>next research agenda turned to look more<br>closely at how employees emotions<br>impact our Behavior at work and to this<br>end I engaged with the positive<br>psychology literature so interestingly<br>there has been a lot of work in the<br>organizational behavior area and it is<br>focused primarily on negative<br>behaviors such as unhappy workers<br>stressed workers and the cost that those<br>behaviors have for organizations and<br>indeed there was a review conducted by<br>lutherans of the Contemporary psychology<br>literature where he found that there<br>were approximately 200 000 articles<br>published on the treatment of mental<br>illness eighty thousand on depression 65<br>000 looked at anxiety 20 000 on fear ten<br>thousand on anger but there are only<br>around 1 000 studies that had looked at<br>positive Concepts and capabilities of<br>people<br>so not surprisingly we agreed<br>um with that with the encouragement that<br>lutherans and others suggested and that<br>we adopt a more positive agenda so we<br>thought that was a good idea especially<br>given the findings from our previous<br>studies and so we looked at how the work<br>environment might impact our emotional<br>psyche<br>so our emotional states shall be aware<br>are quite malleable that means that they<br>can be changed or altered or manipulated<br>so given the premise or our premise was<br>that HRM might be able to manipulate or<br>change our emotional states at work it's<br>also an important thing to note that our<br>emotions have a contagion effect and<br>that means if you're positive or worked<br>it can have a flow on positive effect to<br>your colleagues at work likewise if<br>you're negative at work that can also<br>have a contagion effect and have a<br>negative impact on your colleagues<br>so the purpose of this study was to see<br>if HRM was a mechanism that employers<br>could use to promote positive emotions<br>amongst our Workforce<br>and we found that yes it was we<br>specifically found that where HRM<br>supports positive emotions then<br>employees are likely to reciprocate by<br>engaging in those helping behaviors that<br>I talked about earlier those citizenship<br>behaviors which are very beneficial for<br>all right so just um on a slightly<br>lighter note<br>I also<br>had a lock and conducted a study on the<br>emotion of Chardon Floyd<br>so this looked at Chardon freuda in the<br>workplace and they always say you should<br>study things that are of interest to you<br>and Chardon freuda as an emotion which<br>just fascinates me no end and why<br>wouldn't it if you just have a look at<br>this quote<br>unlike most things that light up your<br>ventral striatum Chad and freuda is free<br>it's not fattening and you don't have to<br>take your clothes off it can't hurt and<br>it might just make you feel a little<br>better<br>so what is Sharon Florida it is that<br>fruit of Glee we feel<br>when we observe another's Misfortune now<br>it is a pleasurable state right it's a<br>positive State please do not confuse it<br>with Envy which is when we observe<br>another's good fortune and envy as a<br>negative State and that can cause us<br>pain so it's it's a positive State<br>another caveat that I need to add in<br>here is that um<br>is not harmful and it only really<br>relates to minor misfortunes so if we<br>were thinking about work we're talking<br>about a colleague making a fool of<br>themselves in a meeting we are not<br>talking about a colleague being made<br>redundant or something more serious all<br>right so it is um minor misfortunes<br>so I feel the summation I'm not proud<br>that I feel it but it is something that<br>I can relate to so when I started<br>researching this emotion I suspect that<br>some of my colleagues thought that when<br>I said I experienced it they thought I<br>was experiencing it within the work<br>context<br>I want to make it clear that I wasn't we<br>do work in competitive environments<br>and it wasn't because of this that my<br>interest in this emotion was stimulated<br>so that said it is not beyond the realm<br>of possibility that we could find<br>ourselves working with a colleague who<br>suggests that while your research is<br>suitable for publication in those<br>mid-tier journals theirs is destined for<br>much higher honors<br>and it could be that when you hear that<br>their most recent submission to that top<br>tier Journal was disc rejected<br>you might feel a weeping of fruit of<br>Glee and if you did then that would be<br>Chardon Floyd<br>however that is not where um that is not<br>my Chad and freuda came from my love of<br>sport and probably the love of my<br>son-in-law<br>so he's a professional rugby player and<br>when he was competing for a spot in the<br>team I would secretly enjoy that moment<br>when a contemporary vying for the same<br>position as him would drop the ball or<br>they'd miss a tickle I would feel that<br>we sensiferatively so I would feel<br>shadow freuda so let's just be clear it<br>wasn't wasn't the workplace<br>all right so big to something more<br>serious with this study I was interested<br>in understanding what what impact the<br>Shannon Florida emotion might have on<br>our Behavior at work so competitive<br>workplace environments are fairly<br>commonplace today and that's an<br>environment where winning is valued over<br>everything else and often we will see<br>um colleagues pitted against each other<br>for resources or four managerial<br>attention or for status or wages<br>promotions and the like so in these<br>types of environments we would design<br>our HR practices specifically so that we<br>could elicit competition amongst our<br>employees<br>all groups of employees<br>and so the question I asked was do<br>competitive work environments encourage<br>the experience of this emotion and my<br>concern was that in these types of<br>environments we do encourage this type<br>of emotion then it might inhibit<br>employees from engaging in those<br>collegiality or those citizenship<br>behaviors that I've talked about earlier<br>and so that was the focus of this study<br>and the results showed that yes indeed<br>employees are cognitive that they're<br>working in a competitive environment or<br>they're also cognitive um the study<br>found if they're working in a<br>collaborative environment<br>they're aware of what particular HRM<br>practices are in place that set them up<br>we'll put them against each other<br>um but it what it didn't find was that<br>whilst it did Foster the emotion of<br>Chardon Freud amongst these individuals<br>that it's competitive environments that<br>emotion when it was invoked it did not<br>inhabit people or deter them from<br>engaging in organizational citizenship<br>behaviors so they still behaved<br>positively towards their colleagues<br>so this suggests that while the emotion<br>of Shard and freuda is Fountain<br>competitive environments neither it's<br>invocation or its prevalence appeared to<br>impede those collegial behaviors<br>so I guess after that I wondered well<br>what might be it play here<br>and just something that came from the<br>study was usually when we talk about<br>Chardon freuda and when we were looking<br>at behavioral manifestations of it in<br>the workplace the research suggests that<br>it will result in people calling out<br>others errors in front of other people<br>so making a fall of them in front of<br>other people or uncheek gossiping around<br>the water cooler or withholding their<br>own supporter information that I talked<br>about with collegiality however in the<br>New Zealand context what was interesting<br>was that the sample of employees for<br>this study found that those behaviors<br>were both unsporting and both an<br>appropriate and New Zealand workplaces<br>so that was quite interesting and I<br>thought it might be linked to um or it<br>might be worth I guess looking at this<br>in relation to the prevalence of the<br>tool poppy syndrome which is so often<br>talked about in the New Zealand context<br>of course that that is research for<br>all right so just the last section of<br>research that I'd like to talk to you<br>about is research which looks at<br>sustainable HRM<br>So This research is led by my colleague<br>Natasha I'm very very talented academic<br>colleague and it is with much pleasure<br>that I've been able to observe in recent<br>years and as a result of Natasha's<br>interest in this area that pluralism<br>which I talked about right back at the<br>outset being related to employment<br>relations is gaining and it's having a<br>Resurgence and it's very much now being<br>accepted because sustainable HRM and<br>sustainability recognizes that we have<br>different stakeholders in the workplace<br>and that these groups need to work<br>together for a common God<br>so it very much has a pluralist lens so<br>sustainable HRM reflects an emphasis on<br>environmental economic and social goals<br>and so what that means effectively in<br>terms of work is that employee<br>well-being is it's now it's a it's a<br>goal it's an objective that employers<br>necessarily have to promote within their<br>organizations alongside of their other<br>objectives<br>so one of the problems that our research<br>my research with Natasha has identified<br>is that there is a gap between what<br>we're finding in the research and our<br>ability to disseminate those findings to<br>the practitioner community so that is<br>one of our goals it's a work honors have<br>gone on my notes Here for us to find<br>ways to more effectively translate and<br>disseminate those research findings so<br>all right and then just um another issue<br>that we've um or question that we're<br>asking in relation to sustainable HRM is<br>who should be responsible for driving<br>the organization's sustainability of<br>gender and of course<br>um we think it's HR we think the HR<br>function is positioned really well to<br>drive that agenda however when you talk<br>to HR practitioners they're not so clear<br>that either they're positioned well or<br>what it might mean for them in terms of<br>driving their agenda so our study has so<br>far found that practitioners are unclear<br>I guess about what is sustainable HRM<br>what it means to them and how they might<br>drive that and their organizations so<br>there's a lot of work that's being done<br>around that<br>and they're not just um like to mention<br>here as well that this foray into<br>sustainable weight charium again as I'll<br>just mentioned as um motivated by<br>Natasha he's opened the door for several<br>and really interesting International<br>collaborations so I've worked with<br>colleagues linear Joe and Natasha for<br>writing a book chapter that looks at<br>sustainable weight charim and Australia<br>and New Zealand and also Natasha and I<br>are working with an international<br>research team based out of Poland in<br>all right so just um wrapping up<br>in terms of teaching I like to teach<br>through a pluralist lens so I've always<br>brought that pluralist lens to my<br>teaching so I've always tried to get<br>students to understand that need to<br>ensure that um as much as the<br>organization's objectives need to be met<br>the employees also have objectives and<br>we need to think about how we can<br>support those objectives in the<br>workplace<br>so if I was to be um asked what would<br>success like be like for me I would say<br>success would be of our graduates from<br>the Department of management emerged as<br>being socially responsible HR<br>practitioners so that would be something<br>that is something that I aspire to<br>all right acknowledgments<br>all right there are a few<br>in in and Allen so in was my PhD<br>supervisor both in and Alan were mentors<br>mentors I learned from the very best I<br>was privileged to work with both Ian and<br>Alan who combined provided our<br>department with what I can<br>confidently state it was probably the<br>leading employment relations programs in<br>New Zealand Public Service well actually<br>private and public service organizations<br>were after our students they head hunted<br>our students because those guys did such<br>a great job<br>they also had very dry sense of a very<br>dry sense of humor<br>um which could sometimes be a bit hard<br>to take<br>all right<br>um I would also like to thank Marie<br>Robin and Sarah so um they all hold Dean<br>Rose or have held Dean Rose within the<br>otago business school I'd like to thank<br>um Robin for having faith in our<br>department when I took over his head of<br>Department we didn't have any professors<br>and I said to Robin that as a department<br>we had agreed that an effective strategy<br>going forward would be to grow our own<br>we hadn't had a lot a lot of luck in<br>terms of recruiting and retaining people<br>so we thought growing our own might be<br>the best well I'm proud to be standing<br>here as evidence that that strategy has<br>been successful Sarah Walsh and my<br>colleague<br>also evidence of that so thank you I<br>couldn't have a better PVC Marie you're<br>awesome so thank you very much<br>research colleagues<br>um Alan in just Annie Natasha Adele<br>Trudy Elaine Yulia Connor Pola and there<br>are a lot more I could mention as well<br>but I just want to acknowledge<br>um acknowledge you there<br>okay and Nancy<br>um<br>a good department is hinged to its<br>academic support and Kay and Nancy were<br>two of the very best so their support is<br>crucial for making our lives easier and<br>for making us effective in terms of<br>delivering our research and our teaching<br>so I was very lucky to work with Kay and<br>Nancy and the team that we have now our<br>academic support staff do a fabulous job<br>Kay and Nancy I'm very lucky to still<br>have them as long-term friends as well<br>and that's really what work should be<br>all about it's a place where you should<br>have fun and you should make friendships<br>to all my colleagues from the Department<br>of management are past and future thank<br>you very much your collegiality is very<br>very<br>um<br>valued<br>all right so last I would like to thank<br>family and friends for their support<br>over the years<br>so my mother I couldn't have done this<br>without your help just get through this<br>mum gave up her job of 30 odd years to<br>help me out when I was appointed as a<br>lecturer and to a lecturer role in the<br>department she provided help she brought<br>up the kids she cooked the tea she did<br>everything so she was um you know<br>effectively a second mother in a<br>household and she was known<br>affectionately by everyone as Nana Joy<br>Kate and Shannon and Reuben Chewie<br>taharangi and Maya we're a team we've<br>always been a team<br>and so I'm so appreciative of all that<br>you've given to me over the years<br>my brother Brendan<br>thank you for all your support and<br>likewise my extended family Adam Rachel<br>Ben and Sophie<br>my best friends Catherine and Craig you<br>guys have always been there you've<br>always provided guidance and support and<br>a good laugh when we've needed it<br>and then last Alan just another note to<br>say um thank you very much I couldn't<br>have done it without you it's<br>um we often suffer from imposter<br>syndrome as academics and maybe<br>especially female academics Alan was<br>always one for dampening that down<br>getting rid of that um yeah and<br>elevating boosting our confidence so<br>thank you very much Alan um you've<br>always been there a great mentor as I<br>said yeah great partner so thank you for<br>thank you very much for joining me on<br>this occasion<br>foreign<br>Pacific greetings calls Sarah Taiko<br>angua well it's very hard to speak after<br>that and sum up Fiona's work in five<br>minutes before I invite you all for<br>you can relax now<br>um lovely to see your friends and whanau<br>here and Professor Alan as we knew him<br>lovely to see you again as well<br>um and it's also great to see friends<br>and colleagues from the Department of<br>management and um and across the school<br>as well as across the University thank<br>you all for being here to celebrate this<br>achievement today<br>so I'm delighted to be here today to<br>thank Fiona for her insightful lecture<br>which not only reflects on who<br>remarkable achievements thus far but<br>also at the end looks ahead for the<br>future for more to come which we know<br>there will be<br>the field of HRM has been an interesting<br>one and I did actually back in the day<br>teach um HRM for for a while and we<br>started off with that whole notion of<br>this identity crisis around HRM and so<br>often practitioners and academics are<br>not quite sure of the role that HRM<br>plays in an organization historically<br>the chef and personnel and Industrial<br>relations moved and indeed tried to<br>elevate the management of Human<br>Resources to senior levels in the<br>organization<br>however as Fiona has pointed out in<br>doing so the field became focused on<br>creating a much more singular set of<br>objectives in the workplace which meant<br>that HRM was working to clearly align<br>the goals of the human resources with<br>the goals of the organization that very<br>unitary position so this is quite the<br>opposite of Professor Edgar's work which<br>has been to recognize the plurality<br>I'm saying that word quite a few times<br>and I'm really worried how I'm going to<br>say it our voices and the workplaces<br>taking a pluralistic perspective her<br>workers challenge the dominant<br>unitaristic perspective on the<br>employment relationship<br>and acknowledges those conflicts and<br>tensions across different workplace<br>groups for example workers employers<br>community and society and seeks to<br>manage those tensions for the benefit of<br>all stakeholders it takes into account<br>broader social objectives of the work of<br>the organization and promotes Employee<br>Engagement well-being and participation<br>in the workplace which Professor eager<br>has looked at through her career<br>indeed Fiona's research aims to ensure<br>that employees views are heard and her<br>early research was recognizing those<br>employees as important organizational<br>stakeholders which has continued as you<br>see throughout her research career<br>Fiona's more recent work has focused on<br>sustainable HRM as an outcome of<br>adopting that pluralistic perspective<br>the increase in call for organizations<br>and businesses to become more<br>sustainable has meant that stakeholder<br>voices has gained much more traction<br>resulting in multiple voices and<br>perspectives being recognized and<br>acknowledged and the journey to become<br>more sustainable the role of pluralist<br>HRM can be essential in the creation of<br>Frameworks to both encourage and manage<br>those very different voices Professor<br>Edgar's research across well-being<br>commitment and employee voice has<br>created valuable knowledge to help<br>facilitate a more sustainable HRM and I<br>look forward to where this work takes<br>her next<br>congratulations Fiona on having your<br>work celebrated tonight congratulations<br>too for being the first woman to be<br>promoted to Professor in the department<br>of management your leadership is adding<br>to the plurality of professors in the<br>history of our department and here's a<br>and to continue in these celebrations<br>it's my pleasure to invite you all to<br>Refreshments at the staff club and we do<br>thank you very much</p></main><footer style="margin-top: 2rem;
