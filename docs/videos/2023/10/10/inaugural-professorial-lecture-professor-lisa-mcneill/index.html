students and master<br>of marketing students her supervi her<br>supervision is highly regarded among<br>students she was a Commerce Division<br>finalist for the ousa supervisor of the<br>Year award in<br>2021<br>having personally supervised with<br>Professor mcneel I find her to be an<br>extremely professional competent caring<br>and student focused supervisor and I<br>thoroughly enjoy supervising with<br>her professor mcneel's service com<br>commitments have been wide Reaching<br>Across the department of marketing the<br>division of Commerce and the university<br>as a<br>whole she has been as we've heard<br>associate Dean since of postgraduates<br>since March<br>2019 and in this role she provides<br>academic and administrative leadership<br>in all activities relevant

Professor<br>mcneel is actively engaged in the board<br>of Graduate Studies graduate research<br>committee otago scholarship panel<br>graduate student liaison committee<br>division of Commerce proposals committee<br>and the division of Commerce uh<br>divisional board and each of these<br>committees have very large<br>agendas not only is Professor mcneel<br>heavily involved in the University<br>Service but she actively contributes to<br>the community Through public lectures<br>and involvement in Industry initiatives<br>such as the judging of the young<br>Enterprise scheme and she is also a<br>College I have been fortunate enough to<br>work with Professor Lisa mcneel for many<br>years in the department of marketing I<br>have taught with Lisa supervised<br>research students with Lisa sat on<br>committees with Lisa and even run a half<br>marathon with Lisa but that is another<br>on Lisa is someone who who I have often<br>sought advice from and still do on a<br>number and variety of different matters<br>I have often picked her brain around<br>course advice for our students Lisa has<br>always managed to retain all relevant<br>information about course and program<br>structure and can answer any question<br>that you might have about a course path<br>for a student and I know that her advice<br>is always<br>correct this aligns with what I believe<br>to be an amazing skill that least has<br>which I'm always in awe of her ability<br>to retain and recite information when<br>needed it might be something like a<br>policy around a scholarship or<br>admissions for our students or the<br>required papers for a student wishing to<br>complete an LLB and a bcom or an article<br>that her PhD students really must read<br>or it might be something topical in the<br>media that day or a general knowledge<br>question Lisa knows it whatever it is I<br>envy that skill and I would love to be<br>able to retain even a tiny amount of the<br>information and knowledge that Lisa has<br>I don't know how she finds the time to<br>stay a breast of everything just as well<br>as she<br>does and I'd like to give you a small<br>personal example that has always stuck<br>with me and has us and hugely touched me<br>at the<br>time and I don't know if you remember<br>this Lisa but 3 years ago my son was<br>interviewed on Radio 1 and it was a<br>really big deal for us uh he was only 10<br>at the time and the interview happened<br>at 8:00 a.m. on Radio 1 so we were<br>pretty sure the only people that were<br>going to hear that interview were his<br>mom and<br>dad but no I come to work that morning<br>or after I dropped him off at school<br>after the interview and here's Lisa was<br>that mlin interviewed on the radio this<br>morning what a great interview I asked<br>her how could you have possibly have<br>heard this how do you know it he was on<br>the radio and she said well when Roman<br>and Ethan and I come into work and<br>school in the mornings we often listen<br>to radio<br>1 I was so<br>impressed but not at all surprised once<br>again Lisa you're all over everything a<br>hugely enviable skill a skill that I see<br>permeates and clearly enriches her<br>research teaching and delivery of<br>service roles and makes her an<br>insightful and astute colleague teacher<br>and mentor and I am now delighted to be<br>able to warmly welcome liser up to give<br>her a noral professorial lecture please<br>welcome Professor Lisa mcneel<br>namu<br>Co Lisa mcneel<br>towa thank you everyone thank you<br>Richard and thank you<br>Marie and welcome I appreciate your<br>willingness to come and give up part of<br>your evening and I really do hope that<br>you'll find something of interest in<br>what I promise will be a very brief<br>research so a trick that is often used<br>by authors is to start at the end when<br>writing a<br>story the theory is if you write the<br>ending first when you get lost you can<br>find your way<br>back I hope I won't get lost for your<br>sake but I am told that<br>audiences really do like destinations<br>perhaps because you're all thinking<br>secretly are we there<br>yet so the destination that we're<br>heading toward is my current research<br>we're not quite there yet but we will<br>get there with an overview of the path<br>that I took and some of the work that I<br>way when I came to otaga University to<br>study I had never been to<br>denen although I do have an older<br>brother who attended otaga University<br>previously and he had me very well<br>versed in what it meant to be a student<br>and live the student life here at<br>otago I do think that probably his<br>journey made my parents question the<br>wisdom of ever sending another child<br>here but here we are clearly they put<br>aside my first degree Was A Bachelor of<br>Arts in English<br>literature and I really should emphasize<br>particularly for my Commerce colleagues<br>here the luxury of gaining a degree by<br>reading novels and talking about<br>them for this absolutely wonderful<br>introdu ction to University<br>study I'm really indebted to the very<br>special teachers that we have here in<br>the English faculty at Oto both past and<br>present who put amazing time and energy<br>into the courses that they<br>delivered they fostered in me a lifelong<br>appreciation of various authors and<br>Poets from many different<br>disciplines classes by Professor<br>chacy Dr John Watson Dr John<br>hail and the wonderful Dr Bill Deans<br>will always be remembered as some of the<br>best that I have studied again apologies<br>colleagues toward the end of my<br>ba prompted by concern to have a real<br>job I started a<br>bcom I figured that having some skills<br>in writing would translate to Commerce<br>it was storytelling<br>surely and I have to thank Emeritus<br>Professor Jennifer black for encouraging<br>me along this<br>path some of those I knew from<br>Humanities likened this as a move to the<br>dark<br>side Professor Rob Lawson who's here<br>today was a very convincing course<br>advisor telling me that marketing was<br>simply the best subject that one could<br>possibly study in Commerce and that I<br>would have a lot of fun along the<br>way the photo there for those of you who<br>might remember is the infamous 300 level<br>staff I had some amazing marketing<br>Rob and they proved Rob the other Rob<br>correct on both<br>counts marketing really is the best<br>subject to study in Commerce apologies<br>friends from other<br>disciplines but I should say dark side<br>Vader after the bcom it wasn't my<br>intention to become an academic<br>but the opportunity of a PhD alongside<br>an assistant lecturer position seemed<br>like a good<br>one and here I really would like to<br>express my appreciation for my wonderful<br>supervisors Professor Kim Fam Professor<br>Sarah Todd and Professor Vivian<br>Shaw all of these were fantastic Role<br>Models fantastic mentors and wonderful<br>friends<br>I would like to pause here to mention<br>two special colleagues and friends who<br>are no longer with<br>us many of you will remember Dr James<br>Bishop I had the great Fortune of<br>sharing teaching with both James and<br>David throughout the years and I think I<br>can speak for our department when I say<br>that we all miss you we miss your<br>enthusiasm for students for marketing<br>life my PhD as Marie mentioned gave me<br>the opportunity to collect data in some<br>of New Zealand's primary export<br>markets and through its consideration of<br>sales and marketing tactics and food<br>retail opened my eyes to the inherent<br>complexity of<br>consumption in my PhD probably still<br>influenced by my<br>ba I was interested in how the sometimes<br>opposing objectives of retailers and<br>manufacturers were communicated and used<br>as sales tactics as convincing stories<br>within those<br>markets I was fortunate to receive<br>support from foner's predecessor new New<br>Zealand milk in accessing their key<br>Asian export markets looking at New<br>Zealand milk solids to explore this<br>issue it was also very fortunate to<br>complete a PhD having a wonderful time<br>in Singapore and Malaysia and China and<br>denen a central finding of my PhD was<br>that irrespective<br>of firm objectives and cultural<br>dissimilarity the basic drivers for<br>same while the rest of my journey is not<br>yet<br>history this interest in consumption<br>marks the start of the research Journey<br>that has led me here<br>today so let's begin by thinking about<br>my<br>research<br>in cira's novel The unbearable likeness<br>of being the metaphor of heaviness is<br>explored in relation to the burdening<br>down of our Earthly<br>lives nii suggested<br>however that the heaviness of life could<br>be either a tremendous<br>burden or of great<br>benefit depending on the perspective of<br>the<br>individual for some possessions are<br>inherently<br>burdensome for others possessions<br>represent a means to achieve their own<br>likeness of<br>being the majority of my research from<br>my PhD to date has focused on<br>understanding our relationship to our<br>possessions and what those possessions<br>identity<br>in Dante's poem the first part<br>Inferno represents<br>recognition in terms of my research this<br>represents a growing understanding of<br>the importance of possessions in the<br>lives of<br>people this phase of my research could<br>aply be termed food form and<br>fashion<br>what I found during this period of<br>trying to define the issue of<br>consumption and materialism as part of<br>identity<br>construction is that our things as<br>irrelevant as they might seem to<br>others have special deep and unique<br>meaning to us as<br>individuals often our Things become<br>artifacts of our very being taking on<br>physical consider the bride who can't<br>dispose of her wedding dress decades<br>later or your friend who holds on to<br>their school tie presumably because the<br>tight often identity Finds Its clearest<br>expression via our<br>clothing so it is a significant area of<br>interest for those of us who seek to<br>understand the construction of people's<br>identities through their<br>possessions<br>however to show oververt interest in<br>clothing is often derided particularly<br>in academic<br>circles for some an interest and<br>fashion is signaling the exact opposite<br>of<br>intellectualism so I use this ex C<br>from Katherine Mansfield's personal<br>letters as an<br>illustration Mansfield was known to be<br>passionate about dress both in her<br>writing and in her personal<br>life it would be a brave academic to say<br>that Mansfield lacked an<br>intellect and she did not appear the<br>fashion in any case no one who has ever<br>told me that to study fashion<br>consumption is frivolous for an academic<br>so hopefully not not<br>today identity Theory seeks to explain<br>the specific meanings that individuals<br>place on their identity and the<br>artifacts that allow them to express<br>themselves understanding how our<br>consumption of things contributes to a<br>sense of identity allows us to better<br>understand an individual's concept of<br>self and how they negotiate control and<br>display aspects of that self in a<br>nonverbal<br>manner here at otago I teach a course in<br>Innovation and<br>design design lead thinking are asks us<br>to fall in love with<br>problems to really understand a Market's<br>needs in design and Innovation being an<br>expert in Solutions is not as valuable<br>as being an expert in the problems that<br>necessitate those<br>solutions to some extent design thinking<br>is a good analogy to<br>Academia where we might spend years<br>defining a problem<br>Solutions in these papers which range<br>across a number of forms and categories<br>of<br>buying some insights helped me to<br>crystallize a research theme that seeks<br>to understand how individuals control<br>their<br>identity identity is controlled via the<br>social and symbolic capital of<br>consumption<br>so most of these papers sought to really<br>dig into why people consumed in the ways<br>did in a study of grocery product<br>choices consumers cited buying<br>well-known Brands when food was going to<br>be consumed<br>publicly but budget products for private<br>consumption unless the product was a<br>personal trick or a personal reward then<br>the most expensive brand is<br>preferred I should underscore the<br>personal here one participant in this<br>study talked of buying two tubs of ice<br>cream one a gourmet brand one a budget<br>brand and reversing the contents of<br>those tubs serving her family the budget<br>ice cream in The Gourmet tub and keeping<br>the gourmet ice cream in the budget tub<br>for her own consumption knowing that no<br>it in another study young home levers<br>used credit and debt Services<br>extravagantly when purchasing<br>nonessentials such as clothing alcohol<br>or even take away coffee as these<br>purchases were deemed necessary for good<br>mental<br>health mental health in this study<br>tended to cost participants upward of<br>$50 a week on<br>coffee and this was a while<br>ago indeed these consumers use the term<br>free money when describing their<br>personal overdrafts and bank loans that<br>they use to support this type of<br>spending of Interest these participants<br>place the purchase of groceries the<br>payment of rent and the purchase of TX<br>books at the very bottom of their list<br>spending prior research in consumption<br>tended to focus on compulsive or<br>impulsive overc consumption of<br>non-essential<br>products finding that the behavior<br>itself was largely<br>unreasoned and that abstract decision-<br>making<br>applied essentially that those were the<br>problem with non Cal consumption were<br>self-control what we found in these<br>studies is that non-essential purchasing<br>is often strongly tied to a reasoned<br>rational decision-making frame where<br>consumers have constructed a need-based<br>narrative that fulfills their identity<br>motivations to<br>illustrate consider the participant who<br>told<br>us I have a very very large number of<br>dresses like 21st kind of<br>dresses and every time I go shopping I<br>buy another one you don't want to be the<br>photos an interesting finding for me in<br>these studies was the enduring<br>connection between perceptions of the<br>physical self<br>and garment<br>Choice with fashion not just cited as<br>dictating how individuals perceived<br>their<br>body but our bodies restricting us from<br>moving between different identities when<br>to this wasn't A New Concept regarding<br>women but these studies showed evidence<br>of this as a growing concern for men<br>particularly young men<br>for example in a study of young New<br>Zealand<br>males participants noted the tension<br>that they felt as kiwi blokes who were<br>proud of high performance on the Rugby<br>field but then expressed dissatisfaction<br>at their muscular thighs and how they<br>couldn't squeeze into the skinny genes<br>for social situations that they felt<br>were expected of<br>them some some of these participants<br>spoke of wanting to have two separate<br>identities that they could move<br>between but being forced into having<br>only one and the unfairness of being<br>forced into that by their<br>bodies they struggled then to articulate<br>who they really felt they were or wanted<br>to be by being prevented from consuming<br>particular things in the way that they<br>felt they<br>needed<br>during this period one study in<br>2015 marked the beginning of my interest<br>in fashion as a central consumption<br>issue with respect to the sustainable<br>World working with a fantastic student<br>Rebecca we explored what people knew and<br>what they thought about the emerging<br>concept of fashion<br>sustainability<br>this paper was instrumental in<br>stimulating a research trajectory that<br>continues for me<br>today at the time there was not much<br>written on this topic<br>internationally so this paper filled a<br>gap in our categorization of fashion<br>consumer attitudes in a way that is<br>still useful<br>now a key finding of this study and one<br>that remains relevant<br>was the lack of consensus amongst<br>consumers on what sustainable fashion<br>actually<br>is some considered<br>fabric some considered the human cost of<br>production others the life cycle of<br>garments some consumers placed the<br>burden of<br>sustainability on<br>others some placed it on<br>themselves others expressed a strong<br>lack of interest in the issue or in any<br>Behavior change deeming the problem as<br>far less important than other<br>sustainability<br>folky in recent years we have come to<br>realize the true cost of<br>fashion fashion production is estimated<br>to make up 10% of the world's carbon<br>emissions<br>is a significant polluter of all forms<br>of<br>water and approximately 85% of all<br>textiles produced will eventually go to<br>landfill the United Nations environment<br>program notes that the worldwide<br>environmental impact of fashion is<br>currently greater than that of all<br>international flights and shipping<br>combined<br>the second part of Dante's poem<br>purgatorio speaks to the nature of vice<br>and virtue and moral<br>issues in this stage of my research the<br>topics are narrower as I focused on the<br>growing moral issue of consumption and<br>sustainability and what consumers<br>the question of consumption<br>reduction or rejection of<br>consumption is an interesting one for a<br>marketer where many of us have skills in<br>selling however if we consider consumer<br>Behavior as a response mechanism driven<br>by market<br>stimuli marketers are the people well<br>positioned to drive change regarding the<br>about in Behavior change research we<br>categorize measures designed to prompt<br>new or altered Behavior as hard or<br>soft soft measures might offer more<br>choice and more Alternatives in a<br>market hard measures attempt to directly<br>prompt change re-educating consumers as<br>part of that<br>process there is however significant<br>evidence that hard measures may not be<br>as effective as thought by those who<br>seek to implement<br>them for example in my work with my<br>colleague Dr Robert Hamlin where we<br>explored mandated nutritional labeling<br>on food<br>products we found that consumers would<br>treat the mere presence of a label as a<br>green light to purchase ignoring the<br>food in another work it became apparent<br>that there was a disconnect between<br>systems designed to manage perceived<br>overc consumption such as fashion rental<br>or ride<br>sharing and how consumers used these<br>systems such as the fashion renters who<br>pay little care to garments they don't<br>own shortening the lifespan to six<br>wees or the drivers who like the idea of<br>ride sharing as long as it's their car<br>they make the decisions and they're not<br>Norms in fashion research there was a<br>persistent belief that making better<br>quality harder wearing garments would<br>however in work conducted with<br>colleagues in Canada South Korea and New<br>Zealand we found that consumers were<br>motivated to hold on to care for and<br>repair or repurpose fast fashion if they<br>had fallen in love with the Garment and<br>it helped them to achieve or manifest a<br>particular<br>identity equally consumers were fast to<br>dispose of high quality garments if they<br>never really emotionally connected with<br>place the cost of so-called ethical<br>fashion garments has been cited as part<br>of the middle class luxury of embracing<br>sustainability the proponents of<br>credit-based systems that allow<br>consumers to purchase products in a<br>Payla fashion suggest that they can help<br>fill this Gap<br>however work we have conducted in this<br>area tells us that such systems tend to<br>promote excessive consumption among<br>young impressionable consumers often in<br>space at the end of the poem Dante<br>finally understands what he<br>sees he ties the idea of ultimate<br>Paradise the notion that ultimate<br>understanding might exist but we're not<br>quite there yet is I suppose what keeps<br>us researching and is Central to what we<br>academics my current research seeks to<br>highlight opportunities to increase<br>consumer understanding of what they buy<br>and how they use<br>it this would allow the consumer to make<br>choices that fit their personal value<br>structure and embrace their varied<br>consideration This research has shown a<br>spotlight on a number of areas where the<br>industry could serve consumers<br>better for example where we agree that<br>reducing the volume of textiles entering<br>landfill is<br>necessary there is also strong evidence<br>that some disposal of clothing is driven<br>by a lack of repair<br>maintenance professional garment repair<br>in New Zealand is expensive as are some<br>of the tools required to undertake it<br>such as purchasing a sewing machine<br>where community-based organizations<br>offer access to machines and expertise<br>and other<br>tools often these are not known about by<br>those who don't have a particular<br>interest in sewing as a<br>hobby where basic textile skills are<br>taught in<br>schools the focus tends to be on making<br>rather than repairing or<br>maintaining and education is limited to<br>Young children or to<br>females where some male high schools do<br>not offer or encourage textiles as an<br>all in terms of enabling consumers to<br>make better or at least more informed<br>choices the labeling of textiles is<br>largely unregulated and<br>confusing garment manufacturers can<br>effectively purchase a label that<br>indicates a non-relative<br>aspect of sustainability often only<br>Garment further garment<br>retailers can effectively invent their<br>own sustainability labeling and put it<br>right in the retail space in front of<br>mean where terms are broadly understood<br>by the market a retailer can label<br>something recycled for example when the<br>reality may be that the Garment is worse<br>in terms of overall impact than another<br>textile the good news is Media around<br>the world are equally as interested in<br>these issues today signaling a growing<br>social awareness of opportunities for<br>for<br>change the diversity of people's<br>interest in possessions speaks clearly<br>to the role of things as a psychosocial<br>mechanism used by individuals to<br>construct the self-evaluative outcomes<br>within which they are most<br>happy this is at the center of the<br>wicked problem that consumer Behavior<br>researchers grapple<br>with<br>Wicked problems do not have easy or<br>singular<br>Solutions and resistance to change is an<br>indicator of the social complexity that<br>lies behind why we as individuals buy<br>what we<br>buy where our self-esteem is<br>inextricably linked to a need to form an<br>identity or many<br>identities as well as make that identity<br>meaningful possessions signify our<br>ownership of the roles we create for<br>ourselves just as those who are<br>interested in fashion might have too<br>many<br>clothes so too might the academic have<br>too many<br>books so might the surfer have too many<br>purchases my current research does not<br>seek to tell people that they can't<br>enjoy their<br>things my co-researchers and I are<br>interested in how we can better equip<br>people with the tools they need to make<br>different<br>choices achieving the bearable weight of<br>being that nii suggested was integral to<br>life so here we are at the end that I<br>promised and I would like to turn to<br>some notes of<br>thanks firstly I would like to thank my<br>colleagues both current and past in the<br>department of<br>marketing I have been very fortunate to<br>make some very good friends in our<br>department and appreciate the help and<br>support of these colleagues along the<br>way some of whom are here<br>tonight when I started in the department<br>I believe we numbered almost into the<br>30s so I won't attempt to list every<br>individual because I really would not<br>want to leave any one person<br>out I want to thank my wonderful<br>here and past students who have worked<br>with me on many of these<br>projects thank you to my co-authors<br>particularly Dr Robert Hamlin and Dr<br>Rachel McQueen where our collaborations<br>tonight I would also like to thank my<br>family and friends from outside the<br>university for their ongoing love and<br>support heish Roman<br>Ethan I promise this is the one and only<br>attend lastly I would like to thank all<br>of you for coming along tonight K<br>everybody<br>tooto<br>C Rob Lawson<br>toku I've been asked as a former head of<br>Department to give vote of thanks for<br>Lisa for her excellent and absorbing<br>lecture this<br>evening I think it's delighted to do<br>this I was working out that it was<br>actually on my watch as head of<br>Department that Lisa will have been<br>first appointed to a position at at<br>Targo and so that makes it all a little<br>bit special I think uh to recognize that<br>she has enjoyed a whole academic career<br>here so tonight we ought to say thank<br>you uh to Lisa not just for this lecture<br>but for all the contribution she's made<br>to the university over the last 20 years<br>or<br>so it is clear that Lisa has established<br>a very strong International reputation<br>for her<br>work with many uh good<br>collaborations I did a quick U count up<br>and um I found over two and a half<br>thousand citations by other researchers<br>do her work which I think is pretty<br>impressive so well done<br>Lisa if there's one thing from tonight's<br>talk and from her work which I would<br>focus on and take away as a sort of key<br>finding just to um<br>uh substantiate what she's uh talking<br>about it's this relationship between<br>possessions and identity and how they<br>really become<br>synonymous and that's although most of<br>ree Lisa's work has taken place in the<br>context of fashion that's clearly a<br>lesson that we can take into other areas<br>for other people it may be food it may<br>be cars it may be<br>music but that's an important lesson to<br>realize because it helps explain when<br>possessions and consumption are so<br>strongly linked to Identity how Behavior<br>change becomes so difficult to<br>enact and why on many occasions<br>consumption can appear almost to be<br>self-destructive I like the reference<br>and the quote that Lisa made to the<br>about the lady with<br>a Wardrobe full of 21st<br>Dres in material how many dresses she<br>has there's no declining marginal<br>utility as we would get from other other<br>other theories and other subjects each<br>occasion requires a new identity or<br>reinforcement of an identity with a new<br>posess possession that's a different<br>reality from a lot of traditional<br>research<br>so on that<br>basis somewhere down here i' would like<br>to ask Lisa to accept a small token of<br>appreciation from the University for her<br>lecture</p></main><footer style="margin-top: 2rem; background: #0001; padding: 2rem;
