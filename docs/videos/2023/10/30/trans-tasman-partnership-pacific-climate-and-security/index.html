Q&A.</p><h2>Transcript</h2><p style="opacity: 0.9; font-size: 0.8em">Transcripts may be automatically generated and may not be 100% accurate.</p><p>fore<br>for<br>excellenc harinda suu the Australian<br>High Commissioner uh H Robin uh Deputy<br>Vice Chancellor<br>academic<br>gesp<br>everyone welcome to the University of w<br>we acknowledge the Mali King and we also<br>acknowledge those who have passed<br>recently who might be close to us we<br>acknowledge this event and those who<br>have gathered speak in this panel and<br>you<br>k<br>t thank you for coming today um I'm Al<br>gispie I'm the master of ceremony for<br>this event I'd like to welcome the High<br>Commissioner from Australia to New<br>Zealand you are very welcome it's great<br>to have you here uh my friends on stage<br>my colleagues members of the public it's<br>fantastic to have this<br>event we have been um trying to get this<br>together for for a while now and it's<br>taken a lot of effort I'd like to<br>acknowledge those who have helped bring<br>it together as<br>well uh in terms of health and safety I<br>have to go through a few things um one<br>Ian no vaping on<br>stage uh two with make sure that there's<br>no videoing being done apart from that<br>that which is authorized um I was told<br>if there's an emergency to go to gate8<br>which I think this is complete chaos if<br>it's an emergency go outside to the car<br>park because if you're all going to look<br>for gate 8 and the the middle of a time<br>like that it's just going to be Mayhem<br>um we aren't going to be there it's<br>going to be a good safe day the today's<br>idea is like a tasting plate of<br>principles whereby we've got the Her<br>Excellency speaking we have people who<br>are experts on climate change and on the<br>Pacific I know a little about security<br>and the idea being that a few ideas will<br>be thrown out and then there will be<br>discussion the talks will be quite quite<br>short between 5 to 7 minutes each and<br>then we will have questions and the<br>benefit of today is that we want the<br>interaction with the audience whereby<br>you can ask the experts what you would<br>like to know the process for the<br>questions is that we're using slido<br>which is this fancy device here which<br>you can use with your phone the<br>questions will then be put through the<br>computer and I will read them out at the<br>end um it's going to be short it's going<br>to be quick we're going to be done<br>within an hour<br>after we've got through the ideas and<br>the discussion we have got coffee and<br>truffles over here but hopefully<br>everything will be wrapped up in<br>principle by 1:00 and with that our<br>Australia<br>thank you all for being here today and<br>thank you to the University of wado and<br>Professor Gillespie for hosting this<br>session um uh I'm Professor white and Dr<br>hamy I'm it's a real privilege for me to<br>be at on this panel with you and I'm<br>really looking forward to the<br>conversation so I don't want to take too<br>much time uh it is my first I think<br>official visit to uh<br>Hamilton uh since my uh appointment even<br>though I've been here before I haven't<br>actually really spent much time which is<br>a terrible oversite now that I see what<br>a beautiful place this is um and in<br>traditional trans Tasman fashion I was<br>hoping to start off with some rugby<br>banter but Australia's now out of the<br>World Cup so possibly we can skip that<br>part I do wish uh New Zealand uh very<br>well in your contest at the<br>quarterfinals against Ireland on the<br>weekend though Lord look um uh Professor<br>glesby talked about the tasting plate<br>that we have before us and it is a very<br>wide range of issues um it's it's for me<br>a<br>reflection uh of uh something that's a<br>real feature of the relationship has<br>been very clear to me since I took up my<br>role as High Commissioner which is just<br>how deeply interwoven our two countries<br>are our historical links are<br>longstanding and definitely worth<br>celebrating the Anzac tradition<br>this year we're celebrating 40 Years of<br>the closer economic relations agreement<br>uh the 50th anniversary of the trans<br>Tasman travel Arrangement and 80 years<br>of mutual diplomatic<br>representation today I find there's<br>virtually no issue no policy no activity<br>in government or business or elsewhere<br>where Australia and New Zealand do not<br>connect in some way and it's fair to say<br>that that interweaving of our two<br>Nations actually has built a very deep<br>trust between us uh you know and this is<br>very evident I find that when we both<br>think about where we would who we would<br>turn to in a crisis it's always to the<br>other and that I think for me is the is<br>the evidence of that<br>relationship um so as a diplomat this is<br>I can think of very few relationships in<br>the world that are quite like this but<br>because it's so deep and because it's so<br>wide one of the challenges we face is we<br>find it sometimes very hard to<br>articulate what it's about what matters<br>what doesn't matter where do we put our<br>effort answer everywhere what do we<br>focus on everything so it becomes very<br>difficult to talk about or to describe<br>it and um so in July this year our two<br>prime ministers gave us a bit of a hand<br>they launched something called the trans<br>tasmin road map to 2035 very fancy name<br>but essentially what it does is it says<br>well if we were starting today uh in the<br>world that we fa right now and looking<br>out say 10 or bit more years into the<br>future given what we have as the<br>foundation in our relationship what<br>would we focus on and they they landed<br>on about five themes uh of things that<br>we would focus on and I think those<br>themes fit very neatly in the<br>conversation we're having today the<br>first first of those is uh on<br>sustainable inclusive and prosperous<br>economies so the economic relationship<br>has always been the backbone of the<br>Australia New Zealand relationship the C<br>being one of those but when you think<br>about the world we face today we're not<br>worrying about open markets and goods<br>trade so much between us what we're<br>worried about is how do we actually uh<br>tackle Rising protectionism of the world<br>together how do we deal with the<br>economic headwinds that we have how do<br>we restructure our economies to manage<br>with the challenges of uh climate change<br>so that we can meet our emissions<br>targets Australia for instance has uh<br>now upped our uh emissions reduction<br>targets we've legislated these to 43%<br>below 2005 Levels by 2030 uh that's<br>nearly double what our previous Target<br>was and we are working really hard to<br>push an uptake in renewable energy<br>generation so we can make that<br>transition to low emissions economy New<br>Zealand is doing likewise but these are<br>not straightforward transitions so<br>earlier this year we had both our<br>finance and climate ministers coming<br>together recognizing that climate change<br>is a very important economic issue and<br>looking at how we might uh tackle that<br>challenge together where can we share<br>knowledge how can we work on um low<br>emissions Vehicles procurement for<br>example together or how can we actually<br>drive the energy transition so those are<br>the sorts of areas where we're looking<br>forward into the the future in our<br>economic relationship that would be the<br>sort of thing we would look at the<br>second pillar is on security and<br>resilience and if you really think about<br>it both our countries are challenged in<br>different ways with changing uh<br>geopolitical and geostrategic<br>circumstances I mean given what we're<br>seeing in the world right now I think<br>that's not a not a controversial<br>statement but particularly what we're<br>seeing in our region with um a rising<br>geostrategic competition in our region<br>but also domestically cyber issues um<br>critical infrastructure protection<br>counterterrorism Etc there's a lot more<br>that we can do together to boost each<br>other's efforts in that respect the<br>world is not a place now where you want<br>to be an independent Standalone entity<br>you really do need friends and partners<br>and when we look around that value of<br>trust we have between us that's a very<br>valuable commodity and that is actually<br>what joins us the Third pillar so we've<br>had econ Economic Security the third one<br>is actually how we partner in the<br>Pacific and uh that's really where our<br>partnership comes into its own um we're<br>both Pacific nations with very<br>long-standing ties to the region but<br>what the road map uh recognizes is that<br>how we partner and how we behave in the<br>Pacific is as important as what we do so<br>we are really working harder both of us<br>together to listen to Pacific voices to<br>respond to Pacific priorities which is<br>partly why the Australian government has<br>also placed such a heavy emphasis on<br>climate but we're working also in terms<br>of um deeper uh infrastructure<br>investment uh reorienting our<br>development policy so that we can um we<br>can much better respond to specific<br>needs uh as they as they're needed and<br>of course uh as I've said climate change<br>is a very big part of that and and in<br>doing this uh in this kind of move to<br>focusing on how we behave I I I like to<br>think that we have learned a great deal<br>from New Zealand and how New Zealand<br>engages in the Pacific and it has also<br>drawn us closer I think to how New<br>Zealand approaches uh uh engagement with<br>the Pacific this has opened an<br>opportunity for us to work together and<br>of course the last two pillars are what<br>I call the foundational pillars one is<br>uh the fourth pillar would be around<br>protecting and advancing the rules-based<br>order values that we share democracy the<br>rule of law those are the kinds of<br>things that are really are the Bedrock<br>of our relationship and actually what<br>both our countries stand for and there's<br>a great deal of scope for us to work<br>together in that space and the final<br>pillar is actually probably the most<br>important ours is not a relationship<br>just between two governments ours is a<br>relationship between two peoples and I<br>always think that's beautifully captured<br>well what is the most important thing in<br>the world it is people it is people it<br>is people there are<br>700,000 new zealanders living in<br>Australia you are as much a part of us<br>as we are of you and uh in April this<br>year year our government announced a<br>direct pathway of to citizenship for uh<br>new zealanders who've been in Australia<br>for four years or more that means that<br>it's just very easy now to access all<br>the benefits of living in Australia for<br>those who have lived and contributed so<br>much to Australia for so many years and<br>that is actually in the end the very<br>deep strength between us and as we move<br>forward we're placing more emphasis on<br>connecting our indigenous people and our<br>first Nations people we're looking very<br>closely to New Zealand for the lessons<br>we can learn in developing those ties<br>and we've just appointed Australia's<br>first um Ambassador for First Nations<br>people to try to take our indigenous<br>Knowledge Learning awareness out into<br>the world because strengthening those<br>those connections has benefits for both<br>of us and has benefits for the world so<br>I'm just going to sum up there to say<br>you can see why these issues start to<br>really<br>matter because uh when we've looked at<br>where we can prioritize where we can<br>share our efforts to build ourselves<br>into the Future these issues that we're<br>talking about today security climate and<br>the Pacific are really at the heart of<br>where we think we can work today and so<br>I'll be very interested in the<br>reflections of uh um my colleagues on<br>the panel and look forward to the<br>you<br>okay um thanks for coming everyone I've<br>only got five to seven minutes so I'm<br>going to be quite quick apologies and<br>advances for some of the scary slides<br>um basically what I do I do two things<br>really I work in almost as a translator<br>kind of space I try and look at what the<br>hard science is telling us and the<br>disciplines that are related to science<br>and then think about what it means for<br>our policies our politics how we build<br>and how we live um so there's a<br>translation aspect and an action element<br>and I wanted to start off here with a<br>bit of a quiz question which is what do<br>these two images have in<br>common um I'll just let you think about<br>it for a second we not too long because<br>I've only got five minutes um the answer<br>is they were there were events so<br>extreme they both necessitated new<br>colors on the weather map so in<br>Australia we've got the it was over 50<br>degrees so we needed a new darker color<br>um and then in the one in in the US um<br>the previous weather map only went up to<br>15 Ines for for rainfall and then we had<br>a 30inch event which is just it's<br>incredible you know that kind of thing<br>shouldn't really happen and so we're<br>adap in some of our weather maps but how<br>much are we adap in some of our politics<br>is one of the the questions I want to<br>think think about<br>today second scary slide um is I don't<br>know how many of you been following the<br>news in 2023 but we've had an awful lot<br>of scary looking slides I was call it<br>the year of the y- AIS where we're<br>having to spread the axis length because<br>it's just looking so different from what<br>it should do so the one on your left is<br>global surface temperature so the<br>temperature you're feeling and for those<br>of you unfamiliar with these kind of<br>graphs it's it's Bally a northern<br>hemisphere kind of monthly Rhythm where<br>Rises over major in July and then comes<br>back down the red line is<br>2023 um the all the other Wiggly lines<br>are all the other years so you start to<br>get a sense of this year in particular<br>is looking quite different the next one<br>on on your right is Antarctic sea ice um<br>similar kind of thing Wiggly lines for<br>each year and you sted to<br>see things look slightly different than<br>they should do I think the key Point<br>here is that in a long time series<br>records should be broken both cool and<br>heat but not by that much you know it's<br>like running the 100 meters in 9.97<br>seconds then you go down to 9.94 and<br>then no by 91 but when someone runs it<br>in seven seconds you start to think<br>about well what what do we do now what<br>does this<br>mean<br>um the next slide I I wanted to talk<br>about is this is an inter one that's<br>just out a few weeks ago<br>this is every September really for the<br>last<br>150 years or so and it's all the<br>different climate models around the<br>world and and what they've been<br>measuring and you put them all together<br>in one graph and it looks like this and<br>you<br>see that September that's just gone is<br>the the Highline the blue on the right<br>so there's something happening with our<br>climate that it's been it's not<br>incremental and it's not linear<br>and then the other thing I try and do is<br>think about what what does this mean how<br>do we translate the science and think<br>about action and politics so this is<br>another slide that's that's um quite<br>recently out this is Canadian wildfires<br>there's also there wildfires in other<br>parts of the world we're going to hear<br>about surely but there's wildfires in<br>Indonesia right now all the lines at the<br>bottom are the annual Wildfire season<br>the red line is this year and it's still<br>ongoing um these figures can can look<br>quite difficult to get your head around<br>so um I added on the north island of New<br>Zealand just so you've got something to<br>put into context of how big these<br>Wildfire season is this year in Canada<br>we know Australia's had significant<br>problems with wildfires in the past<br>we've been through an alino phase sorry<br>Lino phase which has provided a lot of<br>extra Fuel and I know there's worries<br>about what it's going to look like this<br>time<br>around um and then I wanted to end on<br>this slide before I just have a few sort<br>of Clos in<br>points no one will have seen this slide<br>yet but it's a it's the slide that I<br>can't get out my head this year this is<br>um work that ockland Council were doing<br>on rainfall events so this is on the<br>bottom is time and on the top is the<br>depth of the the water course so we have<br>a big flood event say a one and two<br>event the water C goes up by this amount<br>of depth over this amount of time and<br>then you add on okay what would a bigger<br>event look like until we had the one in<br>a 100y year event and they were working<br>on this sort of late last year and then<br>they thought well if we're going to use<br>this as a planning tool how do we build<br>differently we know that's not right<br>because we know the climate's changing<br>so let's add<br>on the one in 100 event that we expect<br>in<br>2100 and maybe if we plan to that<br>standard we're going to be a bit more<br>future proof and we'll be protected so<br>they started to think about this and<br>putting it in their policy how they<br>build and how they develop and and then<br>January came along<br>and yeah that's was January this year<br>was way over what they predicted would<br>be the worst case scenario for<br>2100 how' you deal with that how do you<br>what kind of policies do you put in<br>place that can sort of recognize change<br>so I wanted to just sum up a little bit<br>and while that slides on the screen for<br>you to have a think about and I think<br>I wanted to end up with just three<br>questions the first is that change is<br>not linear and it's not incremental and<br>that's the point I've tried to make with<br>these slides today which means that it's<br>difficult to predict and if it's<br>difficult to predict it's difficult to<br>manage which means we need to be<br>precautionary um I was at a recent event<br>where someone was telling about some um<br>research they've been doing in in a in<br>the US on the west coast where they've<br>done a a shoreline Retreat plan for 2100<br>they took a few years to do it they h<br>these trigger points and then they had<br>one event and it was beyond the final<br>trigger point for 2100 and it's like<br>well why this incrementalism we've<br>thought about it's not serving as well<br>maybe we need new approaches and then<br>the second point I want to make is the<br>impacts are going to be uneven um and<br>they're going to be um affect some areas<br>much more than others and the Pacific is<br>one of those areas so there's an onus on<br>us to think about what this might mean<br>um and our responsibility is a neighbor<br>in this part of the world<br>and the last point I want to make is<br>around politics and and action so I've<br>been working in this space for about<br>almost 25 years now um and I remember in<br>the early days we used to talk about<br>well when we start to get more rigorous<br>science and when we start to get some<br>events the events will drive the<br>politics and the action and things will<br>happen but it's not necessarily panned<br>out that way you look at this what the<br>science is telling us at the moment and<br>the events and I've never seen the<br>science so loud and the politics so<br>quiet<br>and that's something that's a question<br>I've been mulling over why is that and<br>what can we do to change that and that's<br>one of the sort of questions I've been<br>mulling over professionally and<br>personally is what now what next so I<br>wanted to end their apologies for the<br>slides um you might coming out getting a<br>nice cup of tea and some biscuits um but<br>I thought it's useful context for the<br>kind of talks that are going to follow<br>okay thank<br>you<br>uh aloh aloha aloha mayak aloha no uh<br>Aloha May uh To Her Excellency it's so<br>nice to have you here thank you for<br>coming um bua vaka happy Fijian Lang<br>anguage week<br>everyone<br>Mahalo uh so um I guess uh I feel I feel<br>like my reflection is is gonna um is a<br>little different I found myself um as I<br>prepared for this conversation for this<br>taleno I found myself remembering things<br>and I was particularly thinking of<br>memories and particular memories um so<br>today I want to share uh three memories<br>with you<br>and I think there's lessons in these<br>memories uh for the trans tasmin<br>partnership um I'm going to use these me<br>memories as a little bit of a<br>provocation um but also an<br>opportunity um and and hope I I<br>hope um so the first memory is<br>wildfires uh the first memory is a<br>recent one uh it is of being back in La<br>Wahu Havi and August for funeral as a<br>kid even in August we often swam in the<br>rain um and it usually rains multiple<br>days it rained one day while I was there<br>and it was for a very brief time for<br>weeks before that our kanakam Mali<br>native Hawaiian Community here in aloa<br>had been watching the news uh waiting to<br>hear about family and loved ones on the<br>islands of Maui and the big island and<br>the big island was hardly recorded uh in<br>the<br>news we took in lives lost images of<br>burnt Banyon trees and significant<br>cultural places and uh the insensibility<br>of it all in laier people had stopped<br>watching the news it was just too<br>heartbreaking and some of the stories<br>were about hotels swooping in to ask<br>Hawaiian families to buy their land as<br>lahina was still<br>burning um and then uh reports that most<br>of the victims were the elderly and<br>children so where still was the<br>possibility<br>um that like the paradise fire in<br>California a few years before this<br>Wildfire was probably PR<br>preventable uh so uh it was a result of<br>months of climate related drought land<br>use changing from agricultural to<br>residential development the planting of<br>Highly flammable non-native grasses the<br>diversion of water from residential<br>neighborhoods to hotels and um a Cascade<br>of decision-making failures an email<br>from a family friend and educator in the<br>first few days simply said that her<br>school Community was broken now Hawaii<br>is not unique uh we have King Tides<br>happening in the Cook Islands uh we have<br>uh land loss in kabus and Fiji and of<br>course we've had that reference already<br>to these um you know uh once once in a<br>lifetime floods uh who knew once in a<br>hundredy year floods um that have<br>affected diasporic New Zealand Pacific<br>communities in South Auckland West<br>ockland and the east coast of the north<br>island so in all of this climate change<br>represents very Wicked challenges these<br>messy complex issues that have these<br>many different causes um they tend to<br>impact every uh aspect of human<br>well-being from Health to education um<br>to gendered rights um to housing to<br>employment uh food scarcity Vector born<br>disease um and gender uh violence are<br>just some of the things that um we've<br>seen in the last few years as a result<br>of climate change um at a fundamental<br>level they also threaten um territory<br>and the Very land that Nations have<br>fought for um to gain independence on<br>and therefore they threaten West failan<br>sovereignty um and the right to<br>self-determination of all<br>people so one of the first opportunities<br>that we have um and I don't want to<br>leave it all to our High Commissioner um<br>but as Australia and New Zealand um and<br>backing our diplomats um we have the<br>opportunity in this partnership um to<br>lead out on climate change and support<br>the legal efforts of Pacific people<br>seeking accountability in international<br>fora so we we have heard about the<br>desire to do that and we now have these<br>cases in international fora um to which<br>we can lend our voices uh we also have<br>the chance to model mitigation and not<br>expect Pacific countries to model<br>mitigation um but rather help them with<br>adaptation uh and to allow our actions<br>to speak louder than our words um and so<br>on and so forth so the second memory is<br>uh I'm going to call this Christmas<br>Island so right before World War II uh<br>my grandfather was a 17-year-old and he<br>ended up on a place called Baker Island<br>uh which is in the Phoenix Islands uh<br>which is part of kabus now um and he was<br>part of a group of young uh native<br>Hawaiian men who went with the US<br>Geological Survey um to actually<br>establish radio listening posts in the<br>Pacific um prior to World War II so uh<br>kbus uh and its exclusive economic zone<br>is still very strategically important um<br>it's one of the biggest in the world<br>actually um and uh one of the the<br>dramatic things that happened last year<br>was that kabus walked out of the Pacific<br>um Islands<br>Forum uh this little Nation said hey if<br>we're not going to get a seat at the<br>table we're not coming anymore um and<br>yet it's the strategically very<br>important uh<br>country so we also um had a chance to<br>visit with a parliamentary select<br>committee uh from kabus last year who<br>are going around the Pacific Rim looking<br>for advice on how to develop their<br>research<br>and data capability and their tertiary<br>education um and so we had an<br>interesting conversation with them where<br>they casually Let It Drop um that they<br>were talking to the Chinese and the<br>Chinese were willing to help them<br>develop um the infrastructure on<br>Christmas Island which is a mere two and<br>a half hours flight from Pearl Harbor um<br>and the chines were willing to do this<br>for<br>free uh now we can contrast that um was<br>something that I I witnessed recently in<br>Fiji and uh was over there for a<br>conference and during the week um on the<br>morning show a number of diplomats um<br>you know from far off places uh were<br>visiting Fiji and courting the Fijian<br>government uh one of those uh not the<br>top diplomats um uh but but a lower<br>level uh Diplomat uh from a superpower<br>um came on to announce a wonderful<br>opportunity for young people in Fiji<br>this was as a turned out a chance to<br>work a menial job at a US University<br>over the Christmas holiday period and<br>there were 15 total for the whole<br>Pacific region so that was how one of<br>our that is how some of our neighbors<br>are trying to counter um air strips on<br>Christmas Island and there's a big big<br>lesson in<br>that so this partnership which as we've<br>heard has a longer relationship with the<br>Pacific um has the opportunity not to<br>repeat some of those same mistakes um<br>not to ask kabus to exchange uh to make<br>the the hard choice between survival and<br>tokens um and we have the ability to to<br>be able to do that um so the final<br>memory I'd like to call dynamic<br>response the final memory is kind of a<br>conglomerate of many memories uh that I<br>have from the past few years and working<br>with Pacific um communities um both in<br>New Zealand and in the region and uh<br>this memory first includes a beautiful<br>Valley in on the island of Rarotonga<br>which is called taku V and this this<br>Valley represents um in Hawaii what we<br>call an aupa which is a human in nature<br>your<br>ecosystem um which is based on this idea<br>of social ecological resilience it is an<br>ecosystem that kind of hums along um<br>it's tended by human beings fairy turns<br>are doing their little dance in the air<br>there's poaw and Rose apples and you can<br>just eat them off of trees you can eat<br>you know lemongrass um from the ground<br>you're just eating as you go up this<br>mountain you can only hike um hike up<br>into this Valley and the water flowing<br>through it is Crystal clear and very<br>sweet to The Taste um on that same<br>island we had the opportunity to be part<br>of this huge stem conference uh I say<br>conference but it was really bringing<br>2,000 school children from preschool<br>where they were barely big enough to<br>look into our microscopes we had to get<br>an extra you know step for them because<br>they were so little um to high school<br>students and the whole purpose was stem<br>Workforce<br>Development so I have a lot of languages<br>like that I ALS uh memories like that<br>another memory I have is a recent<br>pacifican Medical Association conference<br>um where we heard from the only<br>psychiatrist in<br>Samoa who hikes up into the mountains<br>and goes out onto the streets to find<br>care for people but he is the only<br>psychiatrist in SWA and their health<br>Workforce issues part partially because<br>of Health Workforce mobility and um New<br>Zealand and Australia kind of attracting<br>Pacific workers is a real issue so we<br>heard about those things they're also<br>Beautiful Moments so again this<br>conglomerate memory reminds me of social<br>ecological resilience um and one of the<br>beautiful things about these systems is<br>that they're built um to have a dynamic<br>response to disruption things like coid<br>things like uh climate<br>change so the final opportunity for the<br>trans tasmin partnership is um to build<br>something with this partnership that's<br>like this Dynamic and abundant ecosystem<br>and I've really been cheered by by what<br>Her Excellency has has shared with us<br>this morning um so uh just as we've<br>heard an important part of this will be<br>working with indigenous communities and<br>people drawing on these legacies of<br>social eological<br>resilience and um and and and their<br>knowledge uh you actually don't last<br>very long in the Pacific on islands that<br>always had limited resources without<br>being very smart and very resilient so<br>um the the last two things that I'll<br>share is that thinking in terms of<br>abundance um May mean further con<br>conversations about the impact of the<br>cptpp um which is that fun but it's much<br>easier to say it as an acronym than as a<br>full treaty name uh but the cptpp to<br>which Australia and New Zealand are<br>Partners um we need to talk more about<br>the impact of that on Pacific<br>Nations Pacific nations are not a party<br>to this agreement that basically<br>straddles the Pacific<br>right um and it may also mean revisiting<br>the UN Declaration on the rights of<br>indigenous peoples and what it means to<br>our relationship building as we go into<br>the Pacific and as we treat um people<br>the way we're going to treat them so um<br>Aloha everybody um that's me but Mahal<br>kak um thank you thank you very much I'm<br>going to make four points and I'm going<br>to be speak quite quickly I'm going to<br>begin um I want my money back I if ID<br>gone to a fortune teller in the 1990s<br>and they said this is the future and<br>they said look Russia is going to be<br>really cool they're going to Cold War is<br>going to end we're going to be mates and<br>then then they're going to say China's<br>going to join the WTO and we're going to<br>globalize together and it'll be really<br>exciting and there's a peace plan for<br>the Middle East as well and then I wake<br>up today and I just think what what's<br>gone wrong and where we are today is so<br>different to where I was promised in<br>1990s because I thought we were going to<br>live happily ever after in this utopian<br>type of situation<br>but I get nervous sometimes when I turn<br>on the TV and I watch the illegal war in<br>the Ukraine I get scared when I watch<br>the tensions in the Indo Pacific over<br>Taiwan and China the rule-based order<br>the difficulty at the island building I<br>almost cry when I watch the barbarity of<br>the Middle East at the moment when I I<br>see the the sequence of war crimes where<br>the horror that we can do to each<br>other I Ian I was quite happy until you<br>started to talk today and and and<br>researcher you know and and I I see this<br>fear of the the the challenge of of<br>climate change I hear what Kaku is<br>saying about the Pacific as well the<br>here's the Wild Card what happens in<br>November next year with the American<br>election if you think it's crazy now<br>what could happen next you know so so<br>I'm so my first point we are in stormy<br>seas we are in a period of change there<br>was that point where we thought we would<br>live happily ever after that cannot be<br>taken for granted right now and so there<br>are storm clouds around us and they may<br>get worse my second<br>point we're not just neighbors we're<br>family and it's something think we tend<br>to forget is how close we are to<br>Australia and our relationship is our<br>formal relationship at at least 182<br>years that we've been working together<br>and um we can talk about trade and the C<br>the economic relationship C great but<br>that that came after 100 Years of<br>exchange you know our first trade<br>agreement was in<br>1895 our immigration I know there's a<br>lot of kiwis in Australia but there had<br>been parts of our history when there<br>were more Australians in New Zealand<br>than the other way around and I'm<br>hopeful it will go back to some other<br>way our sporting relationship which I'm<br>I'll be polite we can't talk about our<br>our our cultural relationship the<br>identity that we share the shared<br>identity you know apart our common love<br>of barbecues the that bizarre<br>embarrassment when you've got an<br>Australian flag next to a kiwi flag and<br>and we've even got the same antip and<br>greeting good day you know and if you<br>ever want to work out how close we are<br>to Australia live overseas and the<br>similarities you will see between our<br>people we forget when you're overseas<br>how how close we are so that's my well<br>and anyway hang on we are actually<br>mentioned no disrespect in your<br>Constitution as we're invited to join<br>the Australian Commonwealth when we get<br>R to write in our constitution we'll<br>make them an invitation as well to join<br>us but it it it's still there that that<br>Legacy our relationship is still strong<br>so that's my second point we're<br>siblings my third Point we've got to do<br>better in the Pacific we have to the the<br>the history of the colonial<br>Imperial terrible times in the Pacific<br>which I which I what what I see at the<br>moment going on in between first century<br>is no more than a reflection of the 19th<br>century of the competition between<br>superpowers vying for influence there's<br>the what happened in<br>1889 in Samoa there was almost a clash<br>between America and Germany and it it<br>didn't it we managed to avert it but it<br>ended up bad for Samoa Samoa got divided<br>between two countries and then there was<br>the those periods of Horrid<br>Administration including from our<br>country our Legacy is not great here but<br>then we had the World War I we had World<br>War II and it became a lake and after<br>World War II it didn't get the attention<br>that it deserved and it was neglected<br>and you get to the point today where the<br>dance card of the leaders of the Pacific<br>is so full they've got people coming<br>from China they've got people coming<br>from America they've got people from<br>Australia that's cool um they've got<br>people coming from New Zealand and you<br>know and we all watch fascinated whether<br>you know who's dancing with who Who's<br>got what inv vites who's been snubbed<br>you know who hasn't turned up to what<br>event and so from being invisible<br>popular and we have neglected them we<br>have neglected the Su we have sorry we<br>have neglected the Pacific Islands we<br>have not listened to their voice we have<br>not given them the respect that they<br>need understand their<br>independence right now the Pacific is a<br>wash with money which is just bizarre<br>because we've got to this point where<br>four countries in the Pacific are least<br>developed that's not poor that's very<br>poor that and that means when these<br>other countries come in and they say<br>here's a bucket load of cash and we s<br>like say you can't take that it's got<br>strings attached but on the other hand<br>New Zealand only gives<br>0.23% of our GDP towards Aid the UN<br>Target is 0.7 the Australians<br>0.19 and so we've got to do better<br>because we've got to think about the<br>security of the Pacific the independence<br>of the Pacific the economic development<br>of the Pacific and the threats of<br>climate change we we Australia New<br>Zealand we must cooperate we must be<br>principled we must be coordinated we<br>must do more is is my third<br>Point final point with the military<br>we've got to deepen our relationship and<br>and so we we're having this big big<br>debate um about whether we we should or<br>shouldn't join orcus and there's and you<br>can argue it both ways and it's an<br>important debate this debate started in<br>1887 that was our first defense<br>agreement with Australia 1887 and we had<br>this big issue about whether we were<br>going to buy five Cruisers Cruisers were<br>kind of like modern battleships they<br>were steam powerered and they had metal<br>plating pretty cool for the period<br>really expensive debate was how many<br>stay in New Zealand you know and<br>everyone cost us £20,000 big<br>bucks that's our relationship it begins<br>in<br>1887 our military actually that's that's<br>not complet our military relationship<br>actually begins here wakato 2 and a half<br>th000 Australian volunteers came to<br>fight in what were unjust and wrongful<br>Wars but it began here the Anzac Legend<br>began here and it's great that you're<br>here because there's a long history and<br>so it goes from the land Wars to the the<br>it was a Russian scar which is the first<br>one to World War to the B War to World<br>War I in gipo what a legacy what a<br>legacy wrong place wrong people wrong<br>time being shot at and we lost but but<br>we were together we we were together and<br>then we went through World War II and we<br>relied on Britain and Britain wasn't<br>there if we're honest the country that<br>saved us was America but before that<br>happened before we got the answers<br>treaty we made a deal in 1944 the Cambra<br>act where New Zealand has one defense<br>relationship only one and it's with<br>Australia and we are obliged to defend<br>Australia and Australia is obliged to<br>defend<br>us so now we say what happened in the<br>21st century because now that the world<br>is so different now that we've got these<br>threats that I mentioned at the<br>beginning I looked at I got uh Amanda to<br>draw up my thank you for my slide it's<br>fantastic um and it it's like a word<br>game and like you keep moving the<br>letters around and like an anac anac<br>Anis orcus and somehow we've dropped off<br>it<br>um two things one I've been trying to<br>get foreign policy into the New Zealand<br>election cycle but no one wants to talk<br>foreign policy we're all too focused<br>about the price of vegetables and<br>whether we should have mobile phones and<br>schools and other important things and<br>there's a lot of important stuff we got<br>to discuss but we do do not exist in<br>isolation we have to realize that<br>there's a much larger world that we are<br>connected to our friendship with<br>Australia matters whether we join orus<br>tier 2 New Zealand has no interest in<br>nuclear submarines the only submarines<br>new zealanders like our yellow ones and<br>apart from that we have to think about<br>what does the next generation of<br>Technology look like because we war is<br>changing and it's changing quickly we<br>cannot let our defense Personnel<br>wherever they are deployed not have the<br>best kit whether you're talking about<br>cyber warfare Hypersonic capabilities or<br>indeed even artificial intelligence we<br>need to upgrade that doesn't mean we<br>need to join orcus we may or may not but<br>we do need to have an honest<br>conversation about what the implications<br>of that are so that's my fourth point we<br>need to deepen our military connections<br>with Australia so my four point one<br>stormy seas ahead two family three we've<br>got to do more in the Pacific for we<br>need to upgrade our military capacity<br>thank<br>you so I've got um a collection of<br>questions which I'll read out and I<br>think it should be um<br>you can answer them as as you see fit<br>I'm looking at Ian because the first one<br>I think is potentially for Ian given the<br>scale of the environmental crisis what<br>Arrangements can we make to prevent<br>others from exerting undue influence<br>into Pacific under the guide of<br>providing Aid when it might really be a<br>debt trap or actually that's for all of<br>us uh your Excellency would you like to<br>go first can you repeat the question<br>it's a big one yeah a one given the<br>scale of the environmental crisis what<br>arrangement can we make to prevent<br>others from exerting undue influence in<br>the Pacific under the guise of providing<br>Aid when it might really be a de<br>trap yeah so we've been very clear about<br>uh the aid that we provide um so I think<br>really the short answer to that is to<br>keep doing what we have been doing but<br>doing it better so Australia and New<br>Zealand are by far the largest donors to<br>the Pacific we're also the donors that<br>overall tend to provide Grant uh<br>assistance Economic Development<br>assistance and climate assistance uh and<br>the climate assistance isn't actually<br>all that new from the Australian<br>perspective uh 10 years ago I worked in<br>the Australian government Department of<br>climate change and I was responsible for<br>climate adaptation programs in the<br>Pacific there's a lot of science uh work<br>that we've been doing then and we<br>continue to to do now um what we've been<br>what we uh need to recognize is for the<br>Pacific for all our anxieties about<br>geostrategic risk actually if you're<br>talking to Pacific countries climate<br>change is a security risk uh I had the<br>tuvalu High Commissioner talked to me<br>yesterday who said well one of the<br>things they're thinking of doing is<br>digitizing the map of tuvalu because<br>then when it goes under they'll have<br>evidence that the land actually existed<br>now imagine what it's like to be in that<br>space for your own Nation so um I think<br>continuing to support the Pacific we are<br>here we are actually physically in the<br>Pacific we are not from outside and and<br>demonstrating the value of what we can<br>deliver um uh and not getting into I<br>guess an un<br>unnecessary race to the bottom in a<br>sense of a competition between us<br>because in the end other players will<br>always be there um explaining the<br>distinction of what we can actually<br>provide versus what others can and<br>actually being a better partner because<br>that is the way you do it<br>actually okay yeah Aloha and thank you<br>for that um I mean uh so there is a lot<br>in that uh part part of what we need to<br>do is there's an image sometimes in the<br>Pacific of uh other countries riding in<br>on a white horse to help us without<br>listening and so um this this uh not<br>necessarily understanding conditions on<br>the ground and cultures especially<br>cultures um and so uh one of the clear<br>areas where um where you know a more<br>culturally responsive approach will help<br>is in things like gendered rights um so<br>across the Pacific uh we need more women<br>in political<br>office uh we need safer environments for<br>women uh climate clate change<br>antagonizes and um stir up all kinds of<br>things that aren't good for women um so<br>um but rather than going in with an ad<br>hoc project here an ad hoc project there<br>or you know and we see them all the time<br>we see rfps come through um from from<br>our government to do a project here a<br>project here um what we really need<br>though is systematically at every level<br>of government and at every level of<br>decision-making to have women right and<br>um and be able to work with local<br>cultures so part of that um is realizing<br>that some of these um biases and uh<br>discrimination within the law towards<br>women and some of these countries is<br>actually not<br>indigenous um it came with colonization<br>and so we actually have an option of if<br>we go back to indigenous models of<br>Womanhood um I'm not a second class<br>citizen in my<br>community it's the women you have to<br>watch out for my in my culture um but<br>but we have very old histories of queens<br>and high Chiefs and uh even women who<br>dedicated their whole lives to Warrior<br>goddesses and they started Wars and they<br>finish them so it's those kinds of<br>indigenous legacies along with things<br>like social eological resilience where<br>women have a lot of leadership in these<br>communities the W the people working up<br>and taku Vine a lot of them are women uh<br>right so those are we have these<br>opportunities to achieve things in this<br>indigenous way um which happens to be<br>good for human rights and all these<br>other things too so I've got a um a<br>question here that I and I will I think<br>give to you um climate change you posed<br>the question what now what what<br>next answer it<br>um I I I don't know um I think this is a<br>difficult thing is that we've tried a<br>lot of things you know there's a role of<br>scientists we're almost like a nearly<br>warning sort of system we sort of see<br>what's happening we study the<br>environment Global Environmental change<br>we then package this science up in<br>communicable ways we give it to the<br>political political class who then<br>decide what does this mean and how do<br>they balance those they we got political<br>questions around economy and societ and<br>so on and I think as an academic we've<br>done that pretty well I have to say I<br>think the global response to climate<br>change has been one of our best<br>scientific Endeavors in human history<br>from a standing start in the<br>1980s we collected information on Global<br>Environmental change which filled in the<br>missing Gap so politicians could act it<br>was unprecedented people from all around<br>the world collaborating different<br>disciplines different countries<br>um Pro producing these reports which<br>were<br>authoritative so the science isn't Laing<br>the science is clear we know what we<br>need to do um and then we've got the you<br>know the election on the<br>weekend um and sometimes I think you<br>know I do get frustrated with the nature<br>of politics but then you just think<br>sometimes we talk about government as<br>being them and government is not them<br>it's us you know if you speak to any<br>politician they take focus groups they<br>understand the Bell weather what's<br>happening and what kind of messages they<br>could in through and and so there's a<br>role for us to as Society to just be a<br>bit more louder because science has done<br>its job and now it's over to the<br>political class and communities to try<br>and make the case for J that this is<br>what we think is a priority rather than<br>some of the things that I I pushed in<br>there your Excellency within your and<br>tasman's discussions have there been<br>talks about establishing climate Refugee<br>laws either specific to specific Nations<br>or in general oh um you might be more<br>expert on or some of you might be more<br>expert on that than I um the um the<br>question of climate refugees and Refugee<br>laws comes up from time to time uh it's<br>a really delicate question and you may<br>also have a view because<br>as I just mentioned the tuvalu<br>example people are deeply connected to<br>their<br>place um and so when we really think<br>deeply about this where we've tended to<br>land up to now uh is to say uh what we<br>should try to do is to maintain place<br>and culture to the best extent we can<br>which really means a massive investment<br>in adaptation and actually taking action<br>on mitigation that's really how you<br>tackle the issue you'd want to um deal<br>with uh refugees if it came to that as<br>an absolute Last Resort uh and you know<br>God forbid that we get to that place but<br>um but if that were the case I would<br>imagine that Australia and New Zealand<br>would for the Pacific be the first Port<br>of Call um but it's incredibly complex<br>um it's an incredibly complex issue how<br>do you distinguish a climate Refugee<br>from any other kind of refugee and<br>frankly if people were in Strife uh I<br>just think no matter what the cause out<br>of the Pacific we would be out there<br>with our arms outstretched it's just the<br>way I just know it would go but my short<br>answer is the you<br>know we really need to do whatever we<br>can first to avoid getting to the point<br>of climate refugees in the first place<br>that's generally where the conversation<br>goes that's m um yeah I going have we've<br>only got we've only got three or four<br>minutes left can I please jump<br>in is that a question to I'll try to do<br>it really quickly um so so uh for in<br>instance in the refugee Convent<br>convention we really haven't tested the<br>non-discrimination Clause um where<br>clearly these people are being<br>disadvantaged at a level um that looks<br>like discrimination there are certain<br>group of people and they're almost being<br>singled out by climate change we haven't<br>tested that Clause very much in either<br>Australian or New Zealand law um the<br>other thing of course is that you're<br>entirely right when we talk to the kabus<br>community here in Hamilton they're not<br>exactly happy about being here they have<br>a thriving Community they love their<br>neighbors and they're contributing to<br>our community but that isn't option<br>number one that's not really what they<br>want they would rather be home having<br>said that um that same country has<br>already purchased land in Fiji they're<br>not they're not waiting around to be<br>refugees um but they're they're looking<br>to the next place and they're kind of<br>backing themselves um so I I just<br>thought I'd jump in there yeah mam uh I<br>apologize to not get into everyone's<br>questions I've got a long list here but<br>I've got two more I want to ask and<br>first MERS is to to the panel um how do<br>you see the importance of young people<br>and children whose present and future<br>depends on today's decision and you may<br>start the young people and children well<br>they are definitely they're absolutely<br>our future so one thing that does give<br>me heart you uh this has been a very<br>depressing conversation can I just say<br>we're quite happy I I I know I mean and<br>you thank you so much for topping the<br>listener but actually um what do we get<br>with young people and children we get a<br>view to the Future uh we get optimism we<br>get Innovation we get creativity and so<br>so actually maybe what we should be<br>doing when we talk about listening to<br>voices is listening to more Young Voices<br>as well because um they are the people<br>who are going to inherit the mess that<br>we seem to be creating we actually have<br>a responsibility to them and you know<br>when I all the years I worked on climate<br>policy uh it was always that line about<br>well what is the world you're leaving<br>for your children and your grandchildren<br>because that is actually what really<br>drives most of us that's my short answer<br>I think one thing to add is that we work<br>at a university we we see it in the<br>faces I teach on the bach of climate<br>change world's first Bach of climate<br>change degree here and I'm brought I<br>give a lecture and the one I'm brought<br>in for is when it gets emotionally<br>depressing they bring me in for a bit of<br>a Q&amp;A say how have you dealt with it and<br>then I I basically just it's almost like<br>a support group and uh I apologize<br>profusely at the start for the failure<br>of Our Generation other generations and<br>we talk about well what action can you<br>take because there's a bit of<br>disempowerment Into Climate Change<br>they're Global issues Global Gras what<br>can you do and I felt a lot of value<br>just putting time in the local<br>community um working with what you can<br>and the networks you can um to try and<br>and look at that change but I think the<br>other thing to think about is people<br>under 18 they even allow to vote um you<br>know in the election and how many people<br>would ask their children or children<br>what are the important issues for you<br>and how would you like me to vote in<br>this election the weekend yeah so for me<br>it's not an option to do anything but<br>hope and work towards that I have uh<br>four kids and five grandchildren with an<br>a six on the way so I don't have any<br>other options um however I feel the same<br>when I work with Pacific communities and<br>our local communities I actually feel<br>like there is hope there's something<br>called moral license right and and<br>that's the the pressure we put that if<br>you we can gain momentum in moral<br>license um we can put pressure on policy<br>makers and decision makers to do<br>something different we do that a little<br>bit with voting um but but we really<br>need to strongly uh I guess Express that<br>with our voting but in other ways too um<br>social media can do that other things<br>can do that but certainly our moral<br>license should be directed towards we<br>want things to be different we know that<br>we can do it we even know how we can do<br>it um but if we direct our common will<br>towards uh the strong moral license um<br>that is one of our Best<br>Bets one last
