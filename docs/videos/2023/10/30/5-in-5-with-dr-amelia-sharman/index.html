Shaman who is the<br>director of sustainability reporting at<br>external reporting board Amelia thank<br>you for joining us today would you like<br>to introduce yourself tell us a little<br>bit about what you do thanks Rebecca<br>thanks very much for having me so as you<br>said yes I'm director sustainability<br>reporting at the external reporting<br>board we are a small independent Crown<br>entity that sets reporting standards in<br>accounting order and Assurance in our<br>climate so we set those reporting<br>standards for both the public private<br>and not for-profit sectors so my first<br>question for you is what did you study<br>at University and how did it prepare you<br>for your current career I studied<br>geography so I majored in geography<br>minored in French uh for a Bachelor of<br>Arts and then I did a master of arts in<br>geography at the University of ockland I<br>think the key thing that geography does<br>is it teaches you about fundamental<br>concepts of processes and relationships<br>and when you understand the processes<br>and relationships underlying things then<br>you understand Concepts like<br>interdependencies and then you<br>understand Concepts like systems and so<br>I think that that was a fantastic<br>foundation for my career because I now<br>have to think about the<br>interdependencies and systems in terms<br>of how entities are thinking about<br>sustainability inside their business as<br>well as how they're communicating that<br>outwards you're the director<br>sustainability reporting at the external<br>reporting board for New Zealand with<br>such a high-profile role how do you<br>maintain a sufficient work life balance<br>the first thing I would say in response<br>to that is what Michelle Obama said<br>which is you can have it all but you<br>can't have it all all at once so there's<br>lots of things I think it IBS and flows<br>I'm really lucky I have a fantastic team<br>who I can rely on at the at the external<br>reporting board I have a great husband<br>who you know enables me to come away for<br>things like a week at the University of<br>otago I uh try really hard to actively<br>commute I think you know I cycle to work<br>it helps me get some exercise into my<br>day uh when it's really hard to fit it<br>in around the fact that I have a<br>three-year-old and a six-year-old so<br>it's it's a balance it's a Juggle you<br>don't always get it right um but I think<br>trying hard and great people around you<br>is is the way to do it and what advice<br>would you give to someone interested in<br>a career and sustainability reporting I<br>would say it's a wonderful thing to get<br>into it's a growing field it's going to<br>touch all sorts of areas from Finance to<br>risk to law to uh you know General<br>sustainability I'd say to them there are<br>a couple of fundamental things that you<br>need to understand firstly the language<br>get to grips with things like what is a<br>greenhouse gas emission you know what<br>does scenario analysis mean you know<br>what are the fundamental bits of and<br>terms that people are using when they<br>work in this field I'd also say<br>understand the standards you know from<br>places like the external reporting board<br>or in other jurisdictions and understand<br>the tools that underly some of this work<br>so what does it mean you know when you<br>are doing an assessment you know how do<br>you actually do that what are the tools<br>that you might use and the bits of data<br>and information and then finally I'd say<br>the most important thing is to keep in<br>mind the big picture what is this for<br>this is not just to provide information<br>it's actually to achieve change so I<br>understand that you have specialist<br>knowledge in climate change practices<br>what is the number one piece of advice<br>that you would tell every kiwi to do to<br>contribute to climate change<br>mitigation I think the number one thing<br>that every kiwi can do is to think of<br>one thing you know this the one thing is<br>not going to be the same for everybody<br>but to think of one thing one commitment<br>that you can do and then just start with<br>that it can feel really overwhelming to<br>think about climate change I I can't<br>change everything so therefore I change<br>nothing but maybe you can think about<br>shopping secondhand or you know reducing<br>the amount of meat or dairy that you eat<br>once a week or thinking about the way<br>you get around can you walk to this<br>place or can you catch the bus versus<br>you know taking your car so think of the<br>one thing that you can do make a<br>commitment get that habit embedded and<br>then you can think about the next thing<br>the other thing I would say is talk<br>about it talk about climate change it's<br>a real it's a real thing and people need<br>to know that we're all in this together<br>so I would say talk about it make it<br>part of your your active daily decision<br>making and lastly what is the most<br>rewarding aspect of your job I'm really<br>lucky that I get to go to work every day<br>and work with an amazing group of people<br>who all passionately believe in what we<br>do and I think that is the the number<br>one thing that is the most rewarding is<br>knowing that I get to use my experience<br>and my skills to the best of my ability<br>to make a positive change uh for New<br>Zealand and you know for for the country<br>and and for the rest of the world it's<br>it's really exciting to work when you<br>feel like you have a purpose and I'm I'm<br>delighted that that my work at the<br>external reporting board allows me to do<br>that thank you for joining me today<br>Amelia it's been fascinating to learn<br>about your career and your experience<br>and to gain a little bit of insight into<br>what a career and sustainability<br>reporting looks like thank you very much<br>for having me Rebecca it's been great<br>talking with<br>you</p></main><footer style="margin-top: 2rem; background: #0001; padding: 2rem; text-align: center;"><p>We Are The University</p><ul style="list-style-type: none; padding: 0;
