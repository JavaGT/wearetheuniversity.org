predated<br>Me by two years<br>so although I'm older than him like to<br>point out U so I've been teaching<br>research methods in the school for 22<br>years and I promise you I will not treat<br>this like a statistics class tonight I<br>promise you that um the goal is<br>basically to tell you a little bit about<br>the development of a statistical tool<br>that Rebecca and I have um<br>jointly created<br>and we think it's cool and we want to<br>share it with other people the story<br>really tonight is about how young<br>students come along they<br>absorb uh our curriculum even the<br>statistical and Method stuff and they go<br>and they run with it and they can get a<br>job with it and that that uh does such<br>wonderful things to my heart to to to<br>see that that's<br>possible so I need to set the St agage<br>and I want to talk a little bit about<br>why statistics in Psychology are<br>important and I feel like there's maybe<br>a slight need to convince you of that uh<br>fact um so I'll give it a go statistical<br>programs that we use are<br>tools all right and they're tools like<br>any other person would use a tool to<br>create something in our case we create<br>new knowledge we take uh data we gather<br>data and we analyze the data with our<br>tools to make something new from it and<br>we keep refining them the tools over<br>time so that we get better and better at<br>what we do so I'm giving you the example<br>here of the microscope the original<br>microscope you may not know this the<br>compound microscope was invented around<br>1590 at the beginning of the Renaissance<br>in the electron microscope which was am<br>major Advance occurred in the 20th<br>century and that<br>enabled great new Vistas to be opened up<br>with this new tool now I'm not promising<br>the same thing with our tool but it's<br>the same sort of process that we're<br>looking for so I want to argue that<br>better statistical methods help us<br>understand human behavior<br>better and<br>ultimately what we're doing in the<br>trenches analyzing data evaluating<br>interventions and and different<br>therapeutic techniques can hopefully<br>lead to Greater well-being which is the<br>goal of all of us in<br>Psychology so we built this new tool I<br>want to call it a<br>tool um and as a teacher when I when I<br>teach research methods and statistics I<br>fill in gaps in their<br>knowledge um but there's a bigger issue<br>which is about innovating in the field<br>of statistical<br>methods I'll just pause for a sec let<br>in okay so what I'm what I'm talking<br>about is that I don't just teach I try<br>to innovate Tools in uh in in creating<br>better statistical methods to analyze<br>our data so that's the vein that we're<br>working in<br>and I supervise honors Theses any given<br>year I probably do about two and Rebecca<br>came along with it about two years<br>ago something like that um and I pitched<br>the idea to her so I've been working on<br>statistical mediation and moderation I'm<br>going to show you a little bit about<br>that in a minute and I convinced her<br>that it would be a wonderful honors<br>project to develop a tool which would<br>analyze curval linear<br>relationships and she seemed interested<br>so we launched into this uh journey<br>together and the idea is to create a<br>readily accessible and easily used<br>program that can be used to uh quickly<br>generate new information and depicted in<br>graphs that you can copy and paste into<br>documents like like manuscripts that you<br>submit to a journal right and that's I<br>think that's a good thing to<br>do so on this slide I was just talking a<br>little bit about the psychology<br>curriculum what we ended up doing was<br>the outgrowth of a lot of development<br>within our school to improve and upgrade<br>the offerings in statistics and research<br>methodology now those aren't as sexy and<br>as learning about you know developmental<br>Psychopathology which I also do work in<br>or positive psychology which I also do<br>work in but it it's it's the backbone<br>it's it's the it's the foundation for uh<br>creating new<br>knowledge and in this journey I have<br>written a book and I've created an<br>online app application this it's called<br>mod graph and this is a screenshot from<br>the School of<br>Psychology website where it's<br>prominently featured<br>and hundreds of people maybe thousands<br>of people every year go to it and they<br>use it so what they do is they do an<br>analysis and then put in statistical<br>information and then it ends up<br>graphing um a statistical result like<br>this now I'm not going to get into the<br>details I don't think it's necessary to<br>do that but I just want to say<br>that I was very proud of this when I<br>created it at like 12 15 years ago and<br>it's seen a lot of<br>traffic uh in terms of academic<br>citations I'm over 400 with that which<br>is pretty good so for a a scientific<br>paper if you put it out there um you<br>want it to be read and cited so people<br>have picked this up and used it which is<br>school but it's becoming a bit dat I'm<br>aware of<br>that and I found the other day scanning<br>through YouTube that there was this guy<br>who had done a video on modra and I<br>thought to myself how outrageous that he<br>stole the name of my app and he put this<br>video out and I started watching it and<br>he never asked<br>me um so so I I I had to change my<br>attitude about my feelings about this<br>guy uh he did a pretty good job of of<br>talking about it I and I thought I<br>should have done that but I but I hadn't<br>anyway it's still being used out there<br>but it's<br>flawed because we need something that<br>connects data to the process of of<br>generating the graphs so it's all one<br>piece if you see what I'm saying and<br>that and you know MRA doesn't do<br>that so I've written a book on<br>statistical mediation and moderation<br>this is in the same vein<br>of trying to improve the field trying to<br>bring the field along convince the field<br>to adopt better<br>methods and there's a lot in this book<br>of course I'm not going to talk about<br>the details of it but most of what I<br>talk about is in the book is about<br>linear relationships so there's a um an<br>X variable predicting a y variable for<br>example in the simplest case I did touch<br>upon curval linear relationships but I<br>reached a decision point with that book<br>where I thought yeah I could do that I<br>was sitting at about 200 Pages at that<br>point and I said but it would double the<br>number of pages I I would have to write<br>so maybe<br>not so curbal linear relationships sit<br>next to linear relationships and they're<br>both pretty<br>big here's a a really quick graphical<br>depiction<br>of a positive linear relationship a<br>negative linear relationship and then<br>occasionally sometimes you get<br>data where it looks like the best<br>descriptor of the relationship between<br>the variables is curved and that's what<br>we generally refer to as a curval linear<br>difficult and if you look at the<br>literature as I have I do it every day I<br>I go looking for people who have<br>identified curval linear relationships<br>and want to want to study them want to<br>find them again and and new data and<br>what I've realized is that there's very<br>little uptake on this issue and it's due<br>to these four reasons so most<br>researchers don't think in terms of<br>these kinds of theories and predictions<br>so it's not the first thing they're<br>looking<br>for secondly they may not know how to<br>actually do the<br>analysis this there's a few tricky<br>things about it thirdly if they get a<br>result how do you generate a<br>figure over and over again in the<br>literature I see these terrible figures<br>people have almost literally handdrawn<br>them because there's no good way to do<br>it and then fourthly if you actually<br>graph it how do you interpret it there's<br>very little out there to help you<br>understand how to make sense of these so<br>it's a little bit of an<br>unknown Beast for a lot of<br>researchers there's one exception<br>which all of you know you may not be in<br>Psychology but you know this law it's<br>called the Y's dosin law which is that<br>the level of<br>arousal has this curaline your<br>relationship with the quality of your<br>performance so you know that as you're<br>getting ready for some performance<br>whether it's musical or athletic or um<br>something<br>else you you realize that you need to be<br>excited and and kind of revved up to do<br>a good job okay so you want to you want<br>to have a higher level of arousal in<br>order to do a good job but you realize<br>there's a point at which<br>it um bites back okay it works against<br>your your intent so you get over arous<br>and your performance goes down so<br>everybody talks about this this is the Y<br>yor dots andlaw dates dates back to 1933<br>from memory so it's been around almost a<br>hundred years people know this but yet<br>we don't have good me measures for<br>thing all right I'm going to give you a<br>quick example I'm going to wrap up and<br>I'm going to turn it over to<br>Rebecca uh I think the timing is working<br>here I want to give you a quick example<br>and she's going to pick it up and and<br>run with it so I've done a lot of<br>research on<br>mindfulness um which some of you<br>actually do so some of you may actually<br>be<br>meditators and you pursue this as a<br>contemp compettive practice I recommend<br>it it's a good way<br>to be in the<br>moment um in in an immediate sense but<br>it's also a good way for you to gain<br>perspective about how to how to live<br>your life in some very important ways so<br>you may have to invite me back to talk<br>about mindfulness because I love to do<br>that um but one of the things<br>that researchers on mindfulness like<br>myself uh are very interested in is the<br>inverse relationship with<br>depression so I have this<br>data that was<br>collected about almost 10 years 8 years<br>ago last year of 325 it's been a while<br>coule years yeah and I expected to see a<br>negative relationship between the level<br>of mindfulness and the level of<br>depression and self-report measures so<br>there was a measure of mind mindfulness<br>a measure of depression I expected to<br>see a negative<br>relationship so I ran a<br>regression it looks like this the key<br>number is right there which you can<br>probably not see<br>.61 that<br>is a big negative number indicating an<br>inverse relationship between mindfulness<br>and depression what that conceptually<br>means is across the range of people in<br>the sample the higher their level of<br>depression the lower their level of<br>self-reported dep did I say that right<br>the higher<br>mindfulness the lower their<br>depression so depressed people tend not<br>to be mindful mindful people tend not to<br>be<br>depressed I expect that we see it over<br>and over again and I'm asking you the<br>question here what do most researchers<br>do do when you get a finding like that I<br>can tell you what they do they stop and<br>they write it<br>up which doesn't sound like a terrible<br>thing<br>um this is a scatter plot of that<br>relationship the ffmq is the mindfulness<br>measure so this is higher level of<br>mindfulness depression on the Y<br>AIS the slope of the line that you see<br>there from upper left to lower right is<br>a strong negative relationship which is<br>what I'm talking<br>about and when you do a regression you<br>have a straight line that captures the<br>relationship we refer we refer to that<br>as a linear<br>relationship giving you the basics here<br>so Rebecca can run with it so what most<br>people do researchers when they get that<br>result is that that they would say<br>that's great I'm going to write it up<br>now and that's what they would<br>do I'm one of those annoying people who<br>come along and said tap you on your<br>shoulder and<br>go are you sure that's the best result<br>you or the most accurate result of the<br>data people don't like me when I do this<br>but I I try to do it in a helpful<br>way and it turns out<br>as Rebecca will show you in a bit that<br>the best and most accurate relationship<br>that we could draw between mindfulness<br>and depression is actually<br>curved so that's technically what's<br>relationship<br>okay and I get a little wordy here sorry<br>about that but what what I'm saying if<br>you read what I wrote is that it changes<br>your interpretation of what the data are<br>telling<br>us when you get a curval linear<br>relationship like that it it provides<br>additional<br>Nuance to that basic<br>relationship another way to say it is<br>that that first linear relationship the<br>straight line not very<br>accurate and uh we need we need<br>to embrace<br>the whole process of looking for these<br>kind of curval linear<br>relationships and I kind of stuck this<br>in right here but this is really to some<br>extent maybe the most important thing I<br>want to say tonight which<br>is understanding the nuances of data<br>like this have powerful implications for<br>treatment I'm not going to belabor that<br>point but it but whether you believe<br>that's true or that's true changes how<br>you teach<br>so okay so I I'm giving you another<br>graph I love graphs<br>sorry if it's too much but I'm I'm<br>superimposing the red line which is a<br>straight line with the blue line which<br>is curved and I want you to notice that<br>they are most different at the upper<br>left hand and the lower right hand<br>corner the distance right there is in<br>the world of<br>Statistics very<br>interesting and there's this technique<br>that Rebecca is going to talk about<br>called the Johnson<br>Neeman<br>test which<br>captures some important additional<br>information about the nature of that<br>curve in the<br>graph essentially what it does I think I<br>have an example of it right here what it<br>does is it tells you the point at which<br>the slope is flat in that curve most of<br>the curve is it's got this steepness to<br>it which is that negative relationship<br>but at some point here it becomes<br>flat that's interesting because it tells<br>you that the relationship between<br>mindfulness here and defici here<br>doesn't exist that it's a null<br>relationship right there so people who<br>are highly mindful there's no<br>relationship to their<br>important okay so this is why hopefully<br>I convince you this is why cover linear<br>relationships are important um most<br>people miss the cural linear<br>relationships because they never look<br>for them they don't look for them<br>because I don't have a good tool we now<br>have a good tool so hopefully our tool<br>will will fill this<br>Gap so Rebecca and I created this Tool<br>uh we came up with a name called<br>cat I love that name because you can see<br>the<br>data okay it actually stands for curbal<br>linear data analysis tool which is kind<br>of a mouthful but um<br>we're PR proud of it and we're now going<br>to switch<br>on<br>just reload that we just um get a few<br>first okay that's and you just need to<br>select<br>the<br>here<br>go<br>easy okay and this is<br>so okay um I'm flattered that Paul<br>described me as a young student um<br>than me come on that's true but um uh in<br>my relationship with um uh tery<br>education was sort of<br>nonlinear and um uh I um came back uh to<br>study after um you know a couple of<br>decades um and so my priorities and um<br>what I was doing were a bit different<br>than perhaps a um uh undergrad straight<br>out of um straight out of school so I'll<br>just sort of um and and that's kind of<br>fed into my interest in um uh engaging<br>in quite an ambitious uh project with<br>with Paul um and um uh with um sort of<br>uh yeah the the the course that I that I<br>took through through um my study in<br>psychology<br>um and how it links to um career paths<br>uh because I think that's something that<br>um uh that we're interested in talking<br>about today um so uh in choosing Um how<br>my degree was going to look and what I<br>was going to do I you know I was pretty<br>Keen to maximize my employment<br>opportunities um uh but um I also you<br>know had to take um some interests into<br>account um interested in um psychology<br>and um well-being um my first uh my<br>first round at University um I was<br>studying um doing a degree in French and<br>psychology and um uh I had a terrible<br>year and uh failed terms in everything<br>um actually failed everything except for<br>my psychology um course so when I came<br>back I thought um that this was probably<br>a good place to start um and um yeah I<br>really like the um data set uh of<br>well-being um measures that we uh use to<br>build uh this tool because um you know<br>it's not uh it's not an easy time for a<br>lot of young people it certainly wasn't<br>for me I think that um I probably um<br>produced quite different data the second<br>time around from where I did the first<br>time so um but I also um had the<br>opportunity to reconsider what I might<br>be good at um and um one of the things<br>that uh you know we've discussed a lot<br>is uh that people feel a bit allergic to<br>statistics and and they love data um we<br>love to talk about being data driven and<br>um uh making um good decisions based on<br>on data and the evidence but when it<br>comes to actual statistics the general<br>level of um knowledge and um it's face<br>it interest is pretty pretty low um and<br>um I didn't think I was interested in or<br>good at statistics um I that was one of<br>the papers that I failed my first time<br>round so um wasn't really that Keen on<br>um facing stat 193 again um uh but I did<br>it and I actually really liked it um and<br>then um with the psychology uh papers in<br>second year the um research methods<br>papers um bringing together the um<br>psychology and the statistics which I<br>discovered I quite enjoyed um uh was a<br>bit of a revelation so I um took a break<br>for a year from that my psych papers and<br>um did statistics and and um uh some<br>maths papers um which was a bit of an<br>ordeal<br>um to be honest um and a couple of<br>papers in um computer science so I um<br>did a little bit of learning to code um<br>as well um uh what interested me was how<br>differently um statisticians and<br>psychologists um sort of approached the<br>same things um and it was a little bit<br>confusing um uh<br>so as Paul's um already discussed um<br>nonlinear forms um in your data aren't<br>really something that um that is taught<br>in um in the psychology uh courses and<br>the research meth methods courses that<br>I've done<br>um and um uh but it was something that<br>we talked about in<br>statistics um we're taught to look for<br>them in um diagnostic residuals plots um<br>in Psychology we very rarely looked at<br>um the uh whether our data um sort of<br>fitted the um analyses that we were<br>using um Paul's mentioned a notable um<br>example in the literature of um<br>um nonlinear forms in in<br>um um uh in psychological data um but<br>while in statistics we're taught um to<br>look for nonlinear forms and to include<br>them as an option when fitting models um<br>when it came to interpreting them all<br>where were told was that they're<br>difficult to interpret<br>um and um so and and that was the the<br>extent of it pretty much um so I was a<br>bit dissatisfied with both sides of the<br>equation and um what I was getting all<br>around um uh here I've got um this is<br>just uh in case you wondered what I was<br>meaning about looking at um residuals<br>plots and um uh Diagnostics to um uh to<br>look at whether your data fits the um<br>the model that<br>you're trying to describe it with um and<br>if you're a psychology student you<br>probably haven't looked at very many of<br>these um uh which is a Pity um because<br>this is I'm not sure if this cursor will<br>um show up but this is one of the ways<br>that we might find some linear nonlinear<br>forms in our linear aggression um so you<br>see there's a curved line there um uh<br>which um looks like it could be worth<br>exploring um another thing um that<br>really struck me about the um<br>psychology um approach to statistics<br>is um a a real overreliance on um uh<br>some types of output um sort of<br>summaries of um uh of a fit um like our<br>coefficients and and an R squar over<br>Reliance on on the r squared<br>um<br>values<br>uh and um a lack of uh visualizing data<br>um so there's this uh really cool um uh<br>set of sort of um fabricated data sets<br>called the anscom quartet um which were<br>made in the um' 70s um to demonstr<br>exactly that's why you should always um<br>plot your data uh because um the output<br>for these four models uh is basically<br>exactly the same um so if you just run<br>an<br>analysis and harvest your uh results and<br>write them up um there's an awful lot of<br>stuff that's um uh going to be um uh<br>going<br>um<br>unseen um and um so we've got here this<br>nice little um nonlinear relationship as<br>well as some demonstrations of um uh<br>leverage points and and um extreme data<br>points um uh<br>so we sort of felt that there was<br>something I felt that there was<br>something that kind of needed to needed<br>to um change and um<br>Paul um came along with this uh lovely<br>um piece of research about um applying a<br>um Johnson non technique to uh to Cur a<br>linear effects it's something borrowed<br>from<br>moderation um<br>but we just um I'll give you a second to<br>sort of absorb this uh following on from<br>what Paul was talking about with linear<br>relationships um uh in linear regression<br>you've got your two predictors and are<br>multiplied together um and the<br>regression solution describes a curved<br>plane so you can see<br>that this is um a sort of 3D depiction<br>of um the relationship between<br>um with the quadratic effect um and this<br>is pretty impossible to interpret you<br>can understand it falls into the<br>difficult to interpret category um and<br>um this is<br>uh a<br>um this is<br>the output um that we might see from um<br>the<br>uh from from a a relationship of that<br>kind that we've just just shown there um<br>so the not quite sure how to move<br>backwards back to the previous slide<br>there there Arrow up uh so you can see<br>the<br>um that 3D curve there translates on a<br>2d plane into our um uh curved line here<br>the same relationship that we'll kind of<br>keep returning to between depression and<br>um mindfulness and you can see that this<br>interpret<br>um but it still doesn't really um uh<br>address the the point of where this<br>relationship Moves In and Out of<br>significance um uh it's really easy to<br>presume that um output like this that<br>has a um a nice P value um is going to<br>be significant across the length of the<br>relationship um uh but this is a mistake<br>um especially with um nonlinear<br>forms um and this is what<br>the the um Johnson non um<br>approach uh uh<br>addresses and um and we've helpfully<br>um the the point of um uh where it moves<br>out of significance which kind of makes<br>intuative sense because that is where<br>the uh the curve becomes flat the graph<br>to the left shows the simple slope which<br>is actually calculated using um the<br>tangent of the of the curve um and this<br>is the same relationship just shown in a<br>couple of different ways<br>here<br>um<br>before before um uh this uh before this<br>um applying this Johnson n approach to<br>um quadratic uh<br>relationships the best way that you'd be<br>able to describe the um slopes and the<br>way they move in and out of significance<br>would be um something like this uh<br>simple slopes<br>analysis um that you see here which just<br>takes three arbitrary values um of the<br>uh predictive variable and um uh<br>produces the um the values of the of the<br>slope there um which<br>is not very satisfying if you um have<br>data that skews to one side or another<br>you might miss the uh important points<br>um where the significance actually<br>changes um so that was what we um were<br>hoping to address by um creating a a<br>tool that would um that would allow us<br>to um perform these anes more simply um<br>so uh another thing<br>um that uh that's quite different in the<br>um approaches in Psychology and<br>statistics as the types of um<br>computational platforms that we use um<br>and in trying to uh replicate or trying<br>to build a um an analytical<br>tool um we initially looked to<br>create something that would work with<br>the<br>jamovi um uh statistical<br>platform um<br>uh and<br>um uh that was um I've got these a<br>little bit out of order I'm<br>afraid um uh that turned out to be um a<br>bit difficult um but um we had a um<br>Excel um macro uh that was created by um<br>uh Miller Strom<br>shamin um which performs these<br>analyses um a<br>um problem with Excel as a computational<br>platform is that it's not very accurate<br>and a macro like this is prone to uh to<br>we decided to uh use R and um shiny um<br>which is a um uh basically a way of<br>creating web apps um so yeah the Jovi<br>module um required development skills<br>that I didn't have which is something I<br>discovered about halfway through my<br>honors year<br>um um and and um realized that I needed<br>to um to Pivot and find a um better<br>approach or um also known as something<br>that I could actually do um and um<br>someone suggested to me someone in the<br>school of Statistics actually suggested<br>to me that um shiny would be the the<br>best way to do this so<br>um primarily um uh it's it's easy to<br>access and easy to share it's a web app<br>and um uh you know you can just um as<br>I'll show you in a second click on the<br>link and um uh and it will um you know<br>anyone anywhere can can um link into it<br>I can um access the app and use it on my<br>phone if I if I want to do that um and I<br>wanted to be able to<br>um bring<br>um diag notics to the center of the<br>analysis uh because a lot of these<br>techniques um are invalid if the um<br>assumptions of the analysis aren't yet<br>um and uh we wanted to encourage a bit<br>of playfulness and um<br>exploration uh in the data<br>um uh a lot of the um statistical<br>platforms um available are quite St<br>static um and um so we wanted to be able<br>to move uh in between analyses and um<br>swap variables in and out um to sort of<br>really um get get a feel for things now<br>I just need<br>to pop in<br>to right um so I'll just give you a<br>quick run through of the of the tool and<br>I think also um Paul might like to speak<br>to some of the relationships in the um<br>um uh and the data that we'll show you<br>um so once the app is um is open it's<br>pretty simple to link up to a um to a<br>data set and um it's broken into a um<br>series of different<br>um analytical approaches so we start off<br>with just basic um linear regression um<br>and<br>um we have um a data um uh data import<br>section here um there's a tab for<br>descriptives um uh which won't show<br>anything until I put some data in it's<br>um look at this relationship between<br>depression and mindfulness that we were<br>already<br>discussing um we have descriptives for<br>um<br>uh um looking at your data here's our uh<br>relationship that um the linear<br>relationship that Paul showed us right<br>at the at the beginning um and we have<br>some<br>Diagnostics<br>um then we move on to<br>moderation<br>um<br>which<br>might look a bit more like<br>this<br>um<br>analysis<br>um I think um um<br>uh I<br>should show the um importantly I'm<br>forgetting myself here this<br>um uh it gives us the opportunity to um<br>move from a standard linear<br>relationship that we see here um to a<br>quadratic<br>relationship um I should point out um as<br>I me to with the<br>um<br>uh our regression analysis is um Paul<br>had pointed out before we've got a um<br>you know the nice relationship that um<br>uh an analyst is likely to um take as a<br>um good thing and write up and move on<br>um but if we were to look at our<br>Diagnostics we can see that um curved<br>line there in the residual versus fitted<br>plot um and this might make you want<br>to investigate a quadratic form is the<br>kind of um uh use of the diagnostic<br>plots and consideration of um uh<br>quadratic forms or<br>pols um that uh we were taught about in<br>our statistics classes um and you can<br>see that the diagnostic plot has changed<br>and that the kink in that line has um<br>straightened out um and um this is a<br>much better fit to the data our<br>satisfactory finish up<br>because right<br>absolutely um that is is a<br>good<br>call<br>um<br>so just in terms of um uh opportunities<br>that we have um uh with our um tool for<br>for further development um Paul and I<br>are still working on this it's come<br>quite a long way from where it was at<br>the end of last year um and eventually<br>we will be um adding in some um more<br>interesting um<br>functionality um uh and some more<br>complex and more difficult to interpret<br>um uh curval linear forms<br>um uh such as um quadratic and linear<br>bilinear<br>effects and um quadratic and quadratic<br>bilinear moderation where which<br>um will be um uh I think do you think<br>fire hope um Okay cool so um just a few<br>things in in closing the um statistics<br>is heaps more fun with better tools um<br>and um data is um pretty cool when you<br>sort of get to um exploring it and<br>having a a sense of fun<br>um uh yeah statistical tables if anyone<br>remembers um looking things up and that<br>um uh wasn't a lot of fun um maybe<br>that's why I failed step 193 um the<br>first time um but also um quantitative<br>analysis skills are in high demand um so<br>uh it's worth kind of paying attention<br>and um uh getting a handle on these um<br>uh but without being able to interpret<br>them um uh you know it's not of great<br>use um my project um gave me lots to<br>talk about um in the in the job market<br>um I uh was joking with my boss before I<br>came down here that um uh that I would<br>say that um it gave me heaps to talk<br>about in my interview and he said um I<br>don't think you needed that to find lots<br>of talk about um so so there you go um<br>and um ongoing project it's um yeah it's<br>been great to have uh this to work on um<br>along with Paul and um yeah um we're<br>going to keep on plugging away at it um<br>that</p></main><footer style="margin-top: 2rem; background: #0001; padding: 2rem; text-align: center;"><p>We Are The
