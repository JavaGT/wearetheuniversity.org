Germany and um<br>was lucky to have been moving to New<br>Zealand 5 years ago only and to now be<br>part of the school of Psych ology with<br>lovely<br>colleagues um and um amazing<br>students here and some of them here um<br>ER<br>ER so greetings everyone my name is<br>Erica um as hwi said I um first met her<br>when I returned as an older student to<br>study um and at the time I was working<br>for Corrections and I was lucky because<br>Corrections decided that they needed<br>more psychologists Who would know why um<br>they offered to to um send some of us<br>off to train so um so I was one of the<br>first scholarship students I'd already<br>studied psychology<br>and my work um in the prison really had<br>raised a lot of questions for me around<br>what happens in terms of treatment and<br>Rehabilitation in the prison so it was<br>pretty easy going to University and and<br>having some idea that whatever I was<br>going to study I really wanted it to<br>benefit the people um that I had been<br>working with so um I got chatting to<br>hedwick I taed in her office and asked<br>she with supervised me you not long<br>arrived really had you um and one of the<br>things that I said was well that hward<br>would know know is that I'm very<br>passionate about um the role that trauma<br>plays in people's um trajectory in life<br>and particularly when that when part of<br>that tra trajectory inter interacts with<br>the um correctional system so you know I<br>said that's what I want to study that's<br>what I want to know more it's what<br>everyone needs to know more about and um<br>and I really hope that after we do this<br>little bit of research because it was a<br>masters not a PhD that it carries on and<br>I'm really um grateful to know that<br>hedwick has has kept that going along<br>with some of her great students so um on<br>would it go so if anyone's interested in<br>research speak to HW at the<br>end okay so I think I'm going to start<br>oh this thing isn't<br>it I don't do much of this anymore so<br>I'm like oh okay so um as I said I'm I'm<br>a clinical psychologist in the<br>Department of Corrections um and that<br>takes on sort of a number of different<br>guises so just briefly the bulk of<br>psychologists and the Department of<br>Corrections are employed in what we call<br>Psychological Services um and that's I<br>think around 200 psychologists clinical<br>psychologists and general practice<br>psychologists work um for the department<br>and they work and this is where I was<br>working um specifically targeting<br>Rehabilitation and offending Behavior so<br>it's not so much around mental health<br>although of course those those things<br>cross over but it is about how do we<br>help somebody to um to make some changes<br>in their lives and that occurs in a<br>couple of different ways it it occurs<br>through psych Services um psychologists<br>that are based in predominantly around<br>the country in community probation<br>centers um and they'll work with people<br>in the community but they'll also go<br>into the prisons and do individual based<br>work there lot of assessment work<br>including assessment for parole boards<br>um and and um and some treatment work as<br>well um but the demand is high so um<br>it's the psych Services as we like to<br>call it that um that that do that work<br>and they also offer group treatment<br>programs special treatment programs and<br>I'll talk about one of the units that I<br>used to work in um probably next<br>actually I'll just have a look oh yes so<br>they um they operate um special<br>treatment units around the country there<br>are six special treatment units two of<br>them are for sex offenders um and then<br>they have four for as a special<br>treatment unit for violence offenders so<br>the one at raka prison is called<br>tarang it's<br>approximately seven or eight months to a<br>year sometimes longer depending on the<br>person that's there and how long theyve<br>got to go on this sentence um and I<br>worked into F manaki Tanga for about I<br>think three or four years went and<br>studied and then went back for a year um<br>and so I just threw a couple of things<br>up on the board that I think were were<br>particularly interesting to me now the<br>top picture<br>I like to bring because it's perhaps<br>what somebody wouldn't expect to see if<br>they were looking at a photo of men in<br>one of the units that technically Kate<br>is to the most violent offenders in our<br>country and they're dressed in Tut and I<br>have great joy going around the prison<br>talking to people talking to men about<br>potential of doing a program like this<br>one and saying to them but you'll get to<br>do ballet just just for the reaction<br>which is generally like I don't think so<br>um but actually nine times out of 10 uh<br>they do embrace it I'm I'm pretty sure<br>the fact that the tutors that come from<br>the New Zealand Ballet Company actually<br>you know that they're probably um<br>spending time with them is probably a<br>big incentive but nonetheless I think<br>they gain a whole appreciation for the<br>work and the exercise and the strength<br>and fitness that goes into being ballet<br>dancers so um so into F Manara alongside<br>of the treatment that they're there to<br>do um the staff there are also looking<br>to provide other opportunities to have<br>experiences that may not have been a<br>normal part of people's lives prior to<br>coming to prison and so that can include<br>something like this high tea you can see<br>the little cupcakes sandwiches there and<br>there aren't many men um that come<br>through the violent offender units who<br>have had an opportunity to do something<br>like a high te with the teered plates um<br>and that particular High te was<br>conducted to raise funds for the New<br>Zealand Cancer Society um of which a lot<br>of the men had Fino members um that had<br>been affected by cancer therefore were<br>very keen to be a part of that um high<br>tea some of them served all of the<br>guests that came people had to pay for<br>tickets and we charged a lot too and<br>that was because it was all going to a<br>good cause and then some of the men just<br>participated and learned what it was<br>like to eat tiny little triangle<br>sandwiches and yeah it was it was a lot<br>of fun but those sort of seemingly<br>simple things um they're hard to<br>organize but they're very very valuable<br>in terms of um giving people access to<br>different<br>experiences um and then the other thing<br>I took from tar manak that I wanted to<br>share was from one of the newsletters<br>that came out from the unit which is um<br>I've put in the Square there the quote<br>that um I think someone had asked the<br>men what was their greatest learning<br>while they're at to manak and um that<br>was what they said and it it was very<br>appropriate to the topic today so so I<br>threw it on there but it sort of as a<br>whole kind of encapsulates what a place<br>like to Manar Tanga can do<br>um when it's operating at its best so I<br>was lucky to work there um quite some<br>time under psych services and then spent<br>a year in paliston North working at woi<br>prison Manu prison and in the community<br>for a year um in paliston North and then<br>returned back to Rima prison but to a<br>different role this year um and it still<br>astonishes me I think I was saying<br>before the talk began it's still<br>astonishes me enormously that mental<br>health the provision of Mental Health<br>Services is relative recent at least<br>locally in the prisons I couldn't say<br>over the whole country when Mental<br>Health Services might have started to be<br>provided I think it be it began with<br>something called improving mental health<br>or imh<br>Services um and so it started at<br>different times at different places but<br>in terms of having a a team that<br>specifically works on Mental Health<br>difficulties that arise in the prison<br>our team has been at WIA for two and a<br>half years two and a half years it's<br>it's astonishing so it's a it comes<br>under health so it's separate from Psych<br>Services which probably doesn't mean<br>much to most people but for me it's<br>great because I no longer have to always<br>be thinking okay how do we work on your<br>offending although again of course these<br>things cross over and my all my only job<br>is is how can I best support you to get<br>through whatever it is you're getting<br>through at the moment or trying to get<br>through at the moment so the ispt teams<br>the intervention support and prevention<br>teams our multidisiplinary teams that<br>were set up um and at the moment they're<br>based in seven prisons around the<br>country um and the focus our greatest<br>focus is on suicidality and self harm um<br>and the potential for self harm of which<br>the numbers are enormous um now I work<br>at raka prison and also one day a week<br>at adoh prison and we've long knowing<br>that those things were um particularly<br>prevalent in the women's prisons but<br>they are just as prevalent in the men's<br>prisons so that's our um that's our<br>siren I guess you might say that if we<br>get an email or a referral where it's<br>indicated that the person might have<br>been talking about um having some<br>suicidal ideation or engaging in self<br>Haring behaviors um we will try and get<br>there very very quickly but we can be<br>called for any kind of Mental Health<br>crisis in the prison um for people who<br>are very acute do they are housed um for<br>anything up to two or 3 weeks in our um<br>ISU um or our intervention and support<br>unit and<br>that's um um it's a place that that<br>perhaps at its best could function as a<br>respite but given difficulties with<br>resources and things it generally is a<br>place where people are watching you know<br>all of the time so I mean I guess it<br>prevents um self harm and suicidality<br>just because there's always somebody<br>watching people can be on 10 minute<br>observations and be looked at every 10<br>minutes just to make sure that they<br>haven't<br>um they haven't decided to take their<br>own life so um yeah so outside of the<br>isus we work right around the prison<br>like I said with anything from um<br>depression to anxiety a lot of<br>personality disorders I'm sort of going<br>to say that in ined quite I shouldn't<br>because I'm a clinical psychologist but<br>I did see a um a trainer um a very well<br>experienced person during some um<br>training on on working with trauma and<br>he said what is a personality disorder<br>but an ingrained way of coping with<br>trauma and I I think my experience would<br>say that that is absolutely correct the<br>different ways that it shows up are<br>ingrained ways that people survive some<br>pretty horrific<br>circumstances so yeah I I work in a<br>multi-disciplinary team ISP team there<br>are four of us and if you know anything<br>about the prison there are between 8 and<br>8 and 900 men um in the prison as a must<br>on any given day so four people to sort<br>of try and have some sort of handle on<br>the mental health issues of you entire<br>prison population can be tricky but we<br>don't just do it on our own because we<br>have we're a referal service as well so<br>I mentioned improving mental health<br>earlier um they are a very experienced<br>group of counselors that we can refer<br>people who are fairly straightforward so<br>not complex kind of cases maybe if there<br>is such a thing a simple case of<br>depression of course it doesn't tend to<br>work out that way in real life but we<br>refer them on to imh to have counseling<br>and then at the higher end of of acute<br>risk or acute experience of mental<br>health difficulty we we're working with<br>forensics and and referring to them and<br>we also tend to hold prisoners because<br>like the prison um forensics beds are<br>hard to come by and um yeah and people<br>who probably need to be in a forits unit<br>uh often waiting quite some time to<br>actually get a Bard um so that's at the<br>very acute end we sort of try and work<br>with the people in the middle but it's a<br>very big<br>middle um yeah<br>any<br>questions so um I just wanted to round<br>off I guess what I consider sort of this<br>introduction to the way psychologists<br>work in prisons but also how we the<br>various ways in which we might interact<br>with people who have a history of of<br>trauma by sharing a story um of a of a<br>man that I will call Chase and he gave<br>me permission to to to share this story<br>um and it was a story that struck me<br>because he was a great Storyteller I<br>like to think that I'm at least<br>descended from some good storytellers so<br>I'll do my best to give his story some<br>uh the honor it's due um I spoke to<br>chase about four weeks ago um we had<br>been asked to go and see him because<br>he'd been feeling pretty low he's based<br>in the high medium units so um they're<br>on the 23-hour day lockups and they<br>haven't had visitors in the prison for I<br>think three years R took a<br>prison um and he was really wanting some<br>help and he<br>when I asked him why um why now and and<br>what has has<br>um what the word inspired you I guess to<br>kind of put your hand up because it's<br>not something he said that he's done<br>often in his life he told me the story<br>about when he was on the outside um he<br>was in prison for a domestic violence<br>incident against his partner and he was<br>very honest about his responsibility for<br>his anger and how that played out in his<br>relationship but when he was telling me<br>the story he said that his his partner<br>and himself had um had words had more<br>than words everything had gone badly and<br>he'd ended up walking out of the house<br>and going and sitting out in the<br>backyard um and I think it was around<br>lunchtime but he was still sitting out<br>in the backyard on his own by about 7:00<br>in the evening and so his partner had<br>tried to coax him back into the house he<br>wouldn't come and so she rang his friend<br>and he said you really need to come see<br>Chase he's outside he won't come in I<br>don't know what to do so his friend kind<br>of bowls on over and walks up to chase<br>sitting in the backyard and says hey bro<br>what's happening and uh Chase just sat<br>there he said he didn't look at him he<br>just shook kept shaking his head and he<br>said I am just so angry all of the time<br>I Hate Everything I hate everyone I even<br>hate you and so the guy was just kind of<br>like rocking back and forth on his heels<br>um and he said the worst thing the very<br>worst thing is that I have no idea why<br>and um his friend was standing there and<br>there was silenced for a little bit and<br>then his friend said to him I think I<br>know why bro and um Chase sort of looked<br>looked up and looked at him in a bit of<br>surprise and he said his friend<br>literally took a few steps backward and<br>said childhood drama and he ran like<br>just literally<br>ran and CH said he got up and he ran<br>after him chased him for two<br>blocks finally got hold of him and when<br>he did get hold of me he said to him bro<br>why are you running away and he said<br>because I'm scared of you bro we all<br>are and that was the moment where he<br>knew something needed to change so he<br>didn't mind what it was he did how long<br>he would have to do it for he was just<br>determined that he needed to figure this<br>out this anger this hatred this thing<br>that he couldn't quite name but that was<br>having such a devastating impact on his<br>life um so here is kind of where I'll<br>leave my part of this and come back<br>later to talk about some research and<br>hand over to hwi to contextualize the<br>life of Chase and others<br>like than you but I think it's quite a<br>um good uh example of this um what we<br>probably sometimes don't think about<br>this relationship between people who are<br>on the offending side who commit um<br>crimes that they actually often times<br>potentially realize what's going on<br>potentially potentially not cannot place<br>it properly and then um when it then<br>comes to this um to another outburst of<br>of um of anger maybe in this case um<br>there is little to think about where<br>that's coming from because it's all<br>about this current situation only and so<br>um understanding this a little bit<br>better why that is and how these things<br>relate um is something that um yeah<br>definitely was inspired by Erica coming<br>into the office couple of years ago um<br>so when we think about um childhood<br>trauma and imprisonment<br>um there is um there are correlational<br>studies and it's quite a lot of um<br>knowledge that some people or that there<br>is a relationship between those two<br>things so uh and um media often<br>misportrayed in a in a in a bad way but<br>um their relationship with anything that<br>has to do with imprisonment anything<br>that has to do with a um uh decrease in<br>abilities to function in the society or<br>in relationships um um is seems to be<br>prevalent um and also any sort of<br>problems leaving leaving a situation<br>whichever that<br>is um when we think about those<br>relationships and I said um um just a<br>moment going to go correlation so that<br>means that we kind of often times think<br>of looking at two things at the same<br>time and just see do they occur at the<br>same time um and that doesn't<br>necessarily mean that they are causally<br>linked so what uh we need to or what we<br>can do to look at these um relationships<br>here for example is we can go to a<br>prison population and can actually<br>examine and ask people um did you<br>experience any sort of um childhood uh<br>trauma or childhood<br>maltreatment and then we can measure how<br>many people out of this population if we<br>go to one prison or to a greater<br>population how many of those experience<br>that and we can derive some numbers so<br>this is actually from um Erica's work<br>this these are actually quite High<br>numbers and you see also that the range<br>is quite large because it varies quite a<br>lot which type of prison and um country<br>you go to but in in this case this is<br>these are two New Zealand numbers from<br>different studies uh different places um<br>but we can then derive how many of those<br>people would at the moment that they are<br>in prison report that they experienced<br>Mal treatment when they were<br>younger so there's a couple of issues<br>with that in some ways you could say<br>well retrospectively thinking about that<br>so the and another way to look at that<br>um in a in a uh in a way that um lets us<br>think about it more and also causal<br>relationships is going to the general<br>population so there if you just go and<br>ask uh people in in a representative<br>sample of the general population who did<br>exp or we actually track if they<br>experience traumatic events during<br>childhood and then we follow them up<br>over the years later on um and um and<br>see who of those people committed an<br>offense who showed antisocial behavior<br>um who showed that not only once but<br>more persistently potentially and as you<br>probably are all aware of New Zealand is<br>Rich of many longitudinal studies and<br>the one that we can draw on for this<br>kind of topic most on is the denan<br>longitudinal risk study and there um for<br>example um you can they looked at<br>persistent uh criminal behavior and what<br>they found is that um Mal treatment was<br>experienced in 28% of those with<br>persistent uh criminal Behavior whereas<br>those with a low risk of criminal<br>Behavior they only experience Mal<br>treatment um um so um in 5% of them did<br>that did experience that so you see<br>there is a difference there in terms of<br>there's a relationship there but you<br>also see it's not 100% of course so it's<br>not like every person who experiences<br>Mal treatment in any ways will move go<br>on and um show some sort of antisocial<br>Behavior Uh the other thing is other<br>numbers and this is from a US American<br>sample um uh is that there's a almost<br>two point two uh Times Higher number of<br>arrests in individuals experiencing<br>childhood adversity in adulthood than in<br>those who did not um experience<br>that so this while this lower panel here<br>is some way of getting better idea of of<br>potential causal links and trajectories<br>which is quite interesting um we often<br>times study uh and look into prism<br>populations because we have there's a<br>higher prevalence already so we can<br>actually go and and look at those<br>specific um constellations Plus um it's<br>also interesting to see how that plays<br>out in this in this current situation<br>where somebody is in a more um intense<br>um living situation also in prison for<br>example um so when we look at these<br>relationships we also not want to oh now<br>we know well there's a higher risk so<br>what we want to also understand um the<br>mechanisms so why is that because only<br>if we understand why is it actually that<br>some for some people not for all of them<br>but for some people there's a<br>development and there's a higher risk<br>for showing antisocial Behavior after<br>such experiences why is that what are<br>the mechanisms because then we cannot<br>only of course we want to reduce Mal<br>treatment in the first place but we can<br>probably also work on what we can do to<br>help people on the way to not develop<br>this<br>Behavior so um when we think about<br>potential mechanisms um let's just have<br>a look what are those um how can we<br>describe these two phenomena that we're<br>putting here next to each other so<br>childhood Mal treatment and you'll you<br>heard us already using different words<br>there and this whole literature is quite<br>wide um quite varied in the ways of<br>terminology childhood Mal treatment<br>childhood trauma early life adversity<br>early life um um uh trauma there are<br>different words that capture also<br>different things so we need to always<br>for each study that is published out<br>there always look how did they operate<br>operationalize it what did they actually<br>ask and measure many of a lot of the<br>literature actually focuses on uh<br>physical abuse and uh sexual abuse um<br>some include also U physical um neglect<br>and emotional neglect emotional abuse um<br>but this is um this is then already<br>getting a little bit broader some<br>studies even include things like State<br>care or um other adversity in childhood<br>that can be also low socio economic<br>stats um and other um um parental U<br>problems um but the the the the focused<br>more focused research really talks about<br>um sexual abuse physical abuse emotional<br>abuse in<br>neglect when we think about<br>those um those kind of situations things<br>that people can young person can<br>experience you can already when we think<br>about what could be mechanisms you can<br>think about things that come to mind<br>immediately like well if I experience<br>this Mal treatment from a person maybe<br>if it's if it's a person that I know<br>somebody I trust I learn to actually<br>basically not trust that person so there<br>might be some things that go on in on<br>terms in terms of cognitive<br>mechanisms there's also something you<br>can imagine somebody as a child who<br>experiences these kind of um situations<br>um would experience a lot of anxiety in<br>that moment and our body is very good in<br>learning quite quickly from from from<br>fearful situations and so we can also<br>imagine how that actually impacts the<br>way that the brain works and the brain<br>and our body reacts to stressful<br>situations and this is kind of reflected<br>in what we see them when in the symptoms<br>in adulthood so the the huge literature<br>that is there talking about broader<br>symptoms and effects of childhood Mal<br>treatment lists a whole bunch of um<br>symptoms that can show up so depression<br>anxiety so this what we call<br>internalizing symptoms um uh PTSD in<br>some ways um but also aggression it also<br>uh effects on cognitive functioning um<br>and also um things like personality and<br>that's coming back to what it just said<br>earlier so there's um there's a lot of<br>there are a lot of effects here where we<br>can already see well there might be some<br>mechanisms that come through these<br>experiences on a cognitive side maybe<br>through some sort of the per the way<br>that personality changes or also the way<br>that the body actually<br>functions and and<br>um what we do know is that childhood Mal<br>treatment does lead to um higher<br>alertness um more um stress um like a<br>different way of reacting to Everyday<br>stressors as well um a different way<br>that the body um Works in terms of for<br>example things like hydrate variability<br>this is a um almost a measure of how<br>resilient a body is and therefore also<br>the brain<br>and um what we call this overall or can<br>call this is overarousal so people who<br>experience child M treatment tend to<br>show um a higher um alertness and um<br>PTSD as post-traumatic stress disord is<br>listed here as one one of the ways that<br>we can potentially grasp that with if we<br>want to with a diagnostic uh<br>entity um and on the other hand side<br>what we also know is that childhood Mal<br>treatment also leads to or can L to<br>maladaptive personality traits what do<br>we mean with those um maladaptive<br>because they're not helpful for a person<br>to um um to function in in in the social<br>context and these are um borderline<br>personality traits um these are um um<br>antisocial personality traits uh also um<br>Psychopathic personality traits um<br>hisonic personality characteristics that<br>are um leading to a lot of interpersonal<br>problems coming back to this anger this<br>the way that somebody is perceiving<br>other people and the the way they they<br>are perceived because of the way they<br>interact so this dysfunctionality in<br>interpersonal interactions and again you<br>can see already well that's not too far<br>from being aggressive or running into<br>problems um and um potentially<br>committing crimes that are related to<br>other<br>people and uh last but not least<br>what we also know is that Mel adoptive<br>personality traits actually have a a<br>link to treatment progress and so now<br>we're going to move into this thing of<br>this not only leads to behavior that is<br>antisocial but on top of things and this<br>is actually what brought Erica also uh<br>to this topic there is um that can cause<br>problems the way in the way that people<br>can follow treatment potentially that<br>was at least our question because we<br>know this from a lot the bulk of the<br>research in this area has been on uh<br>borderline personality traits where um<br>treatment um progress is often times<br>quite um difficult takes long takes um<br>um longer time periods of time that U<br>people need to be in treatment um and<br>can be much more of a roller coaster um<br>in comparison to some other um contexts<br>and so for that reason um we thought<br>that this might be actually something<br>that might apply here<br>too and um problems in treatment<br>progress can mean um getting into<br>trouble during the treatment with other<br>clients or in a group context um not<br>knowing where they go and just dropping<br>out um and just not completing the<br>treatment um and so bringing those three<br>angles together we were sitting there<br>like thinking oh maybe we need to just<br>look at this relationship between how<br>people actually are able to follow<br>treatment PR program like the one that<br>Erica was um working in um based on or<br>depending on what type of experiences<br>they had in the<br>yes<br>um so on the ground you know you can<br>have this idea that you want to know<br>more about trauma and and the and how<br>much trauma there is in the prison cuz<br>anecdotally you know anyone who's been<br>into a prison spoken with people in that<br>envir enironment know that a lot of the<br>people that we work<br>with have a lot of adversity in their<br>backgrounds um and it's a tricky area to<br>study because when you want to know<br>about somebody's trauma how do you find<br>that out do you send some researchers<br>into a prison and sit down with men or<br>women um they don't know you you don't<br>know them and in this oneoff situation<br>you ask them questions about the things<br>that hiwi had on the board earlier you<br>know there's a lot of issues with doing<br>something like that ethically there's a<br>huge amount of issues that you would go<br>in and gather that kind of information<br>and walk out the door with it under your<br>arm and leaving the person there to M<br>over the things that they perhaps talk<br>about if they've talked about it um so<br>there was a lot of thought that went<br>into actually capturing um capturing the<br>levels of um Mal treatment again picking<br>up what hwi was saying we tend to use<br>words interchangeably um that people<br>might have experienced and that was<br>where the idea came to focus on the Stu<br>programs the Stu violence programs and<br>that's because one<br>um the it's a it's a therapeutic program<br>it's a treatment program the men that<br>are there are there for a significant<br>period of time and over that time they<br>will build up a relationship hopefully<br>with the people that are providing the<br>treatment and in the context of that<br>relationship there is information that's<br>gathered in order to write treatment<br>reports and things at the end so the<br>information that we needed is already<br>gathered which means there is there's no<br>having to worry about going in and<br>asking really um<br>questionable questions of this very<br>vulnerable group of people so um we<br>decided to do it that way and of course<br>there are great things about that and<br>there are some limitations to that as<br>well so I looked at um all of the<br>participants that had been through St<br>programs those that had successfully<br>completed and those that hadn't um and<br>at the four um sites over a period of<br>six four years and what we came up with<br>was a number of 423 so it's a good siiz<br>number when it comes to research um and<br>we had the data um for these men um on<br>average when when we were doing the<br>research what we found is that the men<br>that come into the St um their average<br>age at the start of treatment is 33<br>years of age but that is skewed because<br>the majority are quite young under the<br>age of 30 um there's an ethnicity<br>breakdown there as well with 2/3 of the<br>population in the stops being mildy<br>um roughly a quarter Pia um under 10%<br>Pacifica and then that mysterious group<br>of other um we also gathered information<br>on on the on the offending that had been<br>committed and also um gang status a lot<br>of gang members coming through the dir<br>because it is targeting people who have<br>what we call a rock Roy score or a risk<br>of reoffending violently they get a<br>score and they are the ones that are<br>considered at the greatest risk so<br>that's anyone 7 and above<br>and their Rock Cy score will come and um<br>have the opportunity to do treatment<br>perhaps and it's a big perhaps so when<br>we did the research it's really<br>important to kind of note that the<br>results that we got really only apply to<br>people that are come through the St so<br>it's not like we can say this is true of<br>the whole prison population because<br>there's a significant number of people<br>in prison who um are there for crimes<br>that might not be violent they might be<br>repetitive um or recidivist um property<br>offenders or things like that so this is<br>for violent offenders specifically um<br>and also in order to actually go and do<br>this St to actually meet the entry<br>criteria to do a treatment program you<br>already have have to have ticked a few<br>boxes um to actually get there so for<br>example you have to have shown a period<br>of Behavioral stability within a prison<br>environment of around um at least 6<br>months and you have to have a low medium<br>security status now how do you get a low<br>medium secur security status by behaving<br>yourself in prison you know it's all<br>based on how many incidences you've had<br>how many times you've sworn at the<br>guards how many times you've been in a<br>fight so in order to actually just get<br>in the door you already have to be<br>having some ability to manage your<br>behavior in the prison so again our<br>results can't say anything about um<br>prisoners who perhaps who knows this is<br>total guess work have um masses of<br>amounts of trauma who actually don't get<br>to manage their behavior at all we don't<br>know they sit in<br>P prison in the maximum security unit<br>and they're released from that unit if<br>and when they're released so so chances<br>are um chances are that or we could<br>hypothesize it that the trauma or<br>exposure to traumatic events numbers for<br>them could be even higher still so this<br>is a specific group of men who have the<br>opportunity yes is that number right so<br>average of 67 previous<br>convictions<br>it is staggeringly<br>high well perhaps I imagine again that's<br>the average um but then the average of<br>previous convictions is very high as<br>well although you know you can get one<br>Court conviction and have about five<br>different yeah on yeah so<br>yeah so I mean there are quite a few of<br>the individuals that will come through<br>sentence<br>questions okay so so I was really um I<br>was really intent upon being able to put<br>some numbers though because it was<br>really hard to find numbers of how much<br>um exposure to adverse childhood<br>experiences or childhood Mal Mal<br>treatment there was um it's to try and<br>start to get get an idea of how high<br>this number is because um I have to say<br>that having done treatment in in a<br>number of different places with people<br>I've never sat down with somebody and<br>not and having perhaps over several<br>sessions heard their story um and know<br>what they've done I've never not been<br>able to see the through line you know<br>the way those things connect they might<br>not connect that way for everybody but<br>it makes some kind of crazy sense as and<br>it's not like completely out of the blue<br>and when it on the few occasions that it<br>is I have learned to stand back and say<br>h something's missing here here and<br>inevitably it is over over the course of<br>time you find out that for whatever<br>reason you didn't have the full picture<br>of um it always makes some kind of awful<br>sense so what we found in terms of types<br>of Mal treatment in the sample um and we<br>used is everyone familiar with the aders<br>childhood<br>experiences research fantastic so this<br>started in the states I don't know how<br>many years ago 20 where they started to<br>really put some numbers behind how these<br>experiences that people can have in<br>their early years really impacts a<br>person over their life and what they<br>found was that the higher the types of<br>Mal treatment that you're that you're<br>exposed to as a child the more likely<br>you were to have not just mental health<br>difficulties or difficulties with the<br>law but actually massive Health<br>disparities in terms of suffering from<br>cancer<br>diabetes everything heart disease you<br>name it the high the more exposure you<br>had the worse your physical health was<br>likely to be and of course<br>unsurprisingly your mental health and<br>your behavior in the community as well<br>so what we found of the 400 and<br>something or other men um that that we<br>ran through the research is that only 3%<br>had reported no experience of childhood<br>adversity<br>um and you could say or we will say that<br>um 58% have experienced for or more<br>different types of adversity like this<br>doesn't even take into account um how<br>long that adversity was was experienced<br>for whether you had multiple types just<br>whether you had exposure to that<br>particular<br>um that particular type of adversity we<br>actually extended in this study from the<br>um Aces at um to focus specifically on<br>um physical abuse sexual abuse and<br>psychological or emotional abuse as<br>hward was hwi was saying before um two<br>different types of neglect so we were<br>looking at neglect of the necessities of<br>life Ro over your head regular meals but<br>then we're also looking at neglector and<br>did did you feel that somebody had their<br>eye on you that you were loved and<br>valued in the home that you came from so<br>those were five of the things um and<br>then we added it in I think witness to<br>violence in the home and time spent on<br>and state care which seemed particularly<br>important given the Royal commission was<br>going on and huge number of um men that<br>were in the by Stu programs had spent<br>time and state care and it's not hard to<br>see that time and state care even in a<br>in a positive experience as some people<br>have positive experiences it's still<br>separation from a family um it's still<br>likely to have occurred in horrific kind<br>of circumstances so all of that you know<br>is included as as part of that traumatic<br>experience um so so the thinking was if<br>a person scored really high on this um<br>measure of exposure to these awful<br>experiences then potentially that would<br>make it more difficult for them well<br>I've already said to even access the<br>program but for the ones that did get to<br>access the program it was likely that<br>that would make it more difficult for<br>them to complete the program to see it<br>through to its completion to be<br>considered treated um and it would also<br>make it potentially that their progress<br>was not um it was not as sound as we<br>would like it perhaps to be<br>if they did actually manage to get to<br>the end so those were the hypotheses<br>would that be found to be true and the<br>way we measured it is we looked at two<br>different things again we're looking at<br>data that already exists so we had to<br>make the the best with what we had um<br>there's a a personality measure the mill<br>personality measure is what is given to<br>all of the men that come into the stus<br>and on that measure there is um a a a<br>group of items that are measuring<br>supposedly PTSD um so we took the scores<br>on the PTSD part of the Millen and um<br>and we compared that with um treatment<br>completion and how people went through<br>the program and then we also took their<br>um um what do you call it not the aces<br>score but the amended kind of Aces score<br>and and and had a look to see the higher<br>the number did that mean you were less<br>likely basically was the hypothesis<br>shown to be accurate um and what we<br>found was that there was a significant<br>um a significant impact of um childhood<br>Mal treatment as measured by that Aces<br>type um questionnaire on treatment on on<br>whether they actually were able to<br>complete treatment and how well they did<br>in that in that period of time I.E were<br>they considered to have made some real<br>substantial<br>changes um however the PTSD symptoms as<br>measured by the Millan um didn't show a<br>significant um interaction there and hwi<br>will talk a little bit about oh fact you<br>should probably talk very certain about<br>um where they went from there but those<br>were the results um for me I was really<br>pleased with the outcome because it kind<br>of supported what what I'd seen with my<br>own eyes and also gave a really good um<br>ability to argue that we really need to<br>start focusing we can't just say mental<br>health over here offending needs over<br>there that actually if we could help<br>people find ways of working with the<br>ways trauma shows up in people's lives<br>as an adult then they would be more<br>likely to be able to do the<br>rehabilitation and there for more likely<br>to to society with some chance of of<br>so<br>sorry and we actually did what Erica was<br>hoping we followed up uh and um um with<br>a follow-up study that basically is um<br>using the same data set um and Tasha<br>kushan um another Master student and<br>then looked into um one other component<br>um we were wondering if any of those um<br>maladaptive personality traits that I<br>mentioned earlier if they would have an<br>impact on this treatment completion um<br>uh uh outcome and we found um the only<br>variable that actually had a slight um<br>um relationship with uh treatment<br>completion were Psychopathic personality<br>traits but the other traits did not<br>relate to it and um the same thing for<br>treatment progress they even more so<br>that's basically the only predictor<br>significant ific predictor throughout<br>all of those models was uh childhood Mal<br>treatment so um what do we do or what do<br>we need to do coming from this and as<br>Erica said it points out this really<br>really strong relevance of to to address<br>this in some ways so the first thing<br>that comes to mind so well if people<br>come in coming in with into such a<br>treatment program highly selected and<br>they have this chance now and but we<br>don't really want to make sure that they<br>don't drop out and that they kind of are<br>able to complete the program because if<br>they drop out early that is other<br>research that has shown that actually<br>has gives them a worse outcome long term<br>if they would drop out so what can we do<br>to actually um um give them a better<br>better chance to um um succeed in the<br>treatment and so one thing we thought<br>well we need to know earlier in the<br>treatment program if they have such<br>experiences to uh address them early on<br>and to provide potentially additional<br>treatment for the traumatic experiences<br>before they actually move into the<br>treatment program that addresses the is<br>um the violent offending in a in a<br>bigger group context so what came from<br>here was um a a study a project that um<br>one of our current students Jinta is<br>working on um to ask actually the men in<br>the pre currently in the treatment uh<br>units who H who are partway through um<br>what they would actually uh like or how<br>they experience this process of being<br>ask asked about traumatic experiences<br>what what did it feel like for them<br>coming in getting asked by this Paka<br>woman uh younger than them uh um what<br>what their childhood was like um so how<br>it was for them and what they would how<br>they could imagine such a process to<br>happen how it would need to be um in an<br>early stage of the treatment to be asked<br>about this so it can be addressed so U<br>jent is currently working on figuring<br>out what the men um shared with us to um<br>then draw conclusions how that can be<br>changed in the treatment units and the<br>plan is that uh in one of the units of<br>the four across the country there will<br>be a change made to this process and<br>then we can compare it with another unit<br>where that change hasn't been made to<br>see if that has a better outcome for<br>people who go through the through the<br>program and um in addition to that<br>asking for new early experiences um I<br>think what kind of what what it points<br>out and what what I think well at least<br>this I'm probably on outside of of the<br>of AR um what is nice to see it's<br>sparked and helped this development of<br>seeing trauma to be an issue in the<br>prison system not only for women it has<br>been longer for women and for its own<br>right but this is that this is actually<br>a topic that needs to be addressed also<br>in in the main um I think that is coming<br>through and that's quite um quite good<br>and hopefully leads to more a provision<br>um okay so I think we have a couple of<br>um contact information here uh Erica's<br>email address as well some help lines if<br>you feel uh now this was a little bit<br>too much and you want to talk to<br>somebody please refer to those um and<br>now we are here for questions so<br>anything that you want to ask us and he<br>it</p></main><footer style="margin-top: 2rem; background: #0001; padding: 2rem; text-align: center;"><p>We Are The University</p><ul
