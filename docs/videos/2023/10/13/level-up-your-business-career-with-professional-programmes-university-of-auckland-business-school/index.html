school my name is Marco<br>oer and I'm the director of the master<br>of Applied finance and I teach a range<br>of undergraduate and post-graduate<br>courses and finance here at the business<br>school today I'm joined by some of my<br>business school colleagues we're going<br>to discuss the of apply Finance the<br>master of business management and the<br>master of business<br>analytics would you like to introduce<br>yourself hello everyone my name is Ina<br>pivin I am MBM digital marketing lead<br>digital marketing has been my playground<br>since 2009 in 2020 I joined the<br>University of Oakland business school as<br>a learning designer and digital<br>marketing lecturer and it's great to see<br>our programs were developed<br>growing hello everyone my name is is<br>zangi I am the co course lead for the<br>business analytics Masters program I<br>have been a part of the business school<br>for 8 years now and I have been working<br>in the area of business analytics<br>throughout that time for the young n<br>could you give us a bit of a overview of<br>the master of business analytics and<br>master of business management MBM<br>programs specifically designed for new<br>and recent graduates it's very flexible<br>study options so it's normally delivered<br>during evenings it has quarter based um<br>again study options and uh the beauty of<br>this program it's really skill-based and<br>Industry focused so we always work with<br>real organizations and our clients and<br>cstone projects always is a highlight of<br>the learning experiences it's for people<br>who would like to rescale upscale to<br>gain new knowledge move from one<br>industry to another so you don't need to<br>have necessarily a business background I<br>had students in my classes from very<br>different um with very different work<br>experiences and study experiences but<br>they all uh succeeded in gaining very<br>specific let's say digital marketing<br>skills so which definitely I believe<br>Advanced the career options and can you<br>tell us a little bit more about the<br>master of business analytics yes so it's<br>quite similar to the master of business<br>management really it is again a quarter<br>based program<br>it is designed to be completed across 15<br>months if you're doing it full-time and<br>the type of students who come in there<br>from various different Industries really<br>you do not have to be a business<br>graduate to enter into the master of<br>business analytics you can come in with<br>any type of degree an undergraduate<br>degree as long as you've done some<br>statistics course in your degree as well<br>and it's really catered towards<br>equipping students with the key skills<br>that they need to work as business<br>analytics professionals so it's designed<br>into two parts the first part is our<br>core courses where they will learn the<br>key Concepts all the key techniques that<br>they need to use data to inform decision<br>making they'll learn about how to Source<br>they learn about how to manage how to<br>clean that data they'll learn about how<br>to visualize it and how to tell very<br>engaging enriching stories with that<br>data which is exactly what the needs<br>right now a very applied program<br>absolutely and then it gets better<br>because in the second part of the<br>program then they have the opportunity<br>to select one of three Industries<br>because the specializations are in<br>marketing in um Supply Chain management<br>and also in fintech and there they get<br>to apply the techniques that they were<br>you learning in the part one and really<br>engage with real world data with real<br>world problems and help solve those<br>problems problems in their consultancy<br>projects working with companies and<br>we're also very excited about our newest<br>program which we're going to offer for<br>the first time this year so starting in<br>September which is the the master of<br>Applied finance and again there's a lot<br>of similarities with the programs that<br>you've discussed so terms of the master<br>applied Finance our aim here really is<br>to I guess equip students with all the<br>skills and knowledge they need to go out<br>and be successful in in the world of<br>finance and all sorts of different uh uh<br>roles within the industry and again<br>there's there's similar to your programs<br>there's two parts to it so in the first<br>part students will learn about the core<br>Finance skills and and some other<br>related areas so Corporate Finance<br>Investments Financial Risk Management<br>economics um and then in the second part<br>of the program they then have an<br>opportunity to specialize so choose an<br>area of specialization most suited to<br>their career goals so at the moment<br>we've got sustainable Finance which is a<br>a really rapidly growing area in finance<br>um and also Financial analytics and<br>again as part of that specialization<br>students will actually go and work with<br>a real company um as part of an industry<br>project we all know that we live in a<br>world of constant change and uncertainty<br>so how can our programs help our<br>students adapt to the future of work<br>it's a really good question I think our<br>approach as Educators should be not only<br>about what is happening now in in<br>different Industries right we also need<br>to provide some future forward ideas<br>future forward prospects for students to<br>consider for example in the context of<br>digital marketing last year our program<br>collaborated with the technology Hub at<br>the business school so students were<br>able to work with very advanced<br>technology such as AI augmented reality<br>virtual reality and it was quite<br>applicable to our client organization as<br>well because they designed a community<br>metav using V sets and presenting the<br>ideas in one of the metav communities<br>with which again probably too early to<br>tell that yes it's a way to go but our<br>goal as Educators to show the<br>possibilities to show students The<br>Importance of Being open to this new<br>technological developments we can't<br>ignore it including AI in ch GPT<br>everybody is buzzing about absolutely<br>and I think we can't ignore the fact<br>that data is like the lifeblood of<br>organizations these days and especially<br>with the way technology is advancing we<br>are just generating massive amounts of<br>data in every organization constantly<br>and the fact is this data is going to<br>drive organizations towards improved<br>decision making so every day if you want<br>to improve your competitive Advantage if<br>you want to improve your operational<br>efficiency if you want to provide more<br>personalized experiences for your<br>customers the answer for how to do that<br>lies in your data<br>that is being generated every day<br>through your transactions and that's<br>what we teach in the business analytics<br>Masters program as well how do you take<br>that data and how do you apply the<br>various analytical techniques to be able<br>to create and make those good business<br>decisions and the demand is not just<br>local it is global for business<br>analytics professionals definitely so<br>our program really does prepare our<br>students for a very wide variety of<br>careers which can be the highly<br>technical roles because the program does<br>teach that but also roles like<br>consultancy and strategic roles as well<br>yes so hiring prospects are looks really<br>promising absolutely and in know you<br>mentioned before uh of AI and GPT coming<br>on board I guess that was one really big<br>transformation that we've seen in the<br>last few years and and I guess um you<br>know companies have to adapt to it but<br>so do we in our programs right and so<br>absolutely it's a great Point very great<br>point and we were prepared because as<br>digital marketers you need to keep up<br>with current technological developments<br>it wasn't a surprise for us so we were<br>prepared so my message to my students<br>regardless undergraduate or postgraduate<br>so yes we deal with AI and AI just treat<br>AI as a just little just child this AI<br>tool is learning so we need to give ai<br>go language to speak good manners to<br>learn from so the sooner we do it the<br>better so and we are using AI in<br>different aspects of digital including<br>content creation data analysis but again<br>it's about showing students how to<br>properly evaluate the data generated by<br>AI so and find the common ground between<br>traditional let's say digital marketing<br>analytics tools and AI so but again<br>that's the future right so the sooner we<br>start preparing our students better yes<br>and I think just to add to that one of<br>the key skills that our students need<br>now is not really the core skills of how<br>to work with the data but more how do<br>you interpret the story that the data is<br>telling you because right now ai can do<br>that interpretation for you the<br>generating of the story it can be done<br>but interpreting it and bringing the<br>human aspect in that is what our<br>students are getting trending and those<br>are the kinds of skills that will be in<br>demand by employeers in the future as<br>well abely absolutely I think in terms<br>of the master of Applied Finance also<br>very similar and again I guess I come<br>back to the fact that the the program is<br>very applied and practical in nature so<br>you know it's when we teach the program<br>we're not trying to Simply teach<br>students the theories and the concepts<br>we actually want to go beyond that so we<br>our goal is to teach them how to apply<br>those skills so that they can solve you<br>know unique and new problems that that<br>uh that that that that they can use in<br>all sorts of different situations that<br>they they'll encounter in real life I<br>guess one of the ways that we try and do<br>that in the program is through our use<br>of Technology M so um just give you one<br>example so we have at the business<br>school the financial trading room um<br>which students will use as part of the<br>of the master of Applied finance and uh<br>and there they'll be exposed to real<br>world financial data that they'll be<br>using for all sorts of different<br>applications so I guess just really<br>trying to expose students to the types<br>of resources and data that they'll<br>actually encounter the best way to<br>we use as well very recognizable<br>industry tools like hops sport CRM Sim<br>Rush all-in-one plat visability platform<br>very specific industry tools and a good<br>point about let's say because I can talk<br>about digital marketing of course uh the<br>um one of the great point about the<br>course uh we have industry<br>certifications as well so it's not<br>necessarily what we cover in class only<br>it's you always have a chance to learn<br>more doing industry certifications to<br>support your career<br>prospects yes can you tell us a little<br>bit about the support services that<br>students have available at the<br>University uh we have a great support<br>system so students first of all can<br>decide which options to pursue it<br>fulltime or part-time again the choice<br>depends on your job commitment sometimes<br>it's quite difficult to make a choice so<br>it's good to have these people who can<br>help you to explain the benefits of<br>part-time or full-time<br>we have Library Services because some<br>students coming to us uh after a long<br>break softly speaking and they need<br>support with academic writing searching<br>for good resources for your assignment<br>so again support is provided it's quite<br>solid and it's very nicely established<br>throughout the whole program in class<br>because we don't have a large size<br>classes it's up to 60 70 students so as<br>a teach I also have a lot of<br>opportunities to help my students and we<br>have office hours we have zoom meetings<br>we have very informal conversations<br>sometimes after the class so one of the<br>important features of these programs are<br>the industry Consulting projects aren't<br>they so let's talk for a minute about<br>those so what about the uh Master bu<br>business analytics how do the industry<br>projects work there yes so uh our<br>students get to work with organizations<br>which will provide them certain data<br>sets and also will provide them with the<br>business problem that they won't solved<br>and we've worked with various different<br>organizations really ranging from very<br>large organizations such as uh nedex<br>which works in the risk commodity<br>markets for New Zealand and even two<br>small startup companies so one of the<br>very interesting projects I think that<br>was done just with the last cohort of<br>students of the business analytics<br>Masters um so the capital risk Market<br>that provider was actually trying to<br>Source some price prediction data from<br>an external supplier and they were very<br>reliant on that data set so instead they<br>wanted our students to develop a<br>forecasting and prediction model which<br>could with some development um this was<br>just a pilot project so with some<br>further development it would be able to<br>replace that need to rely on an external<br>supplier for that price prediction data<br>and that was very well received by the<br>organization when it was presented very<br>interesting yeah sounds great yes and<br>what about in terms of the the master of<br>business management any examples that<br>you can get us there sure um industry<br>projects are always a highlight of<br>learning experience students enjoyed it<br>the most because at the end of the<br>programs they have a chance to work<br>with um companies brief clients<br>organization brief we discuss this brief<br>before to introduce this brief to<br>students we identify the problem<br>students are going to work with again I<br>mentioned it earlier probably it's very<br>similar um to intership in terms of the<br>scope of the project so you have your<br>the problem you have the objective you<br>have goals and deliverables so we<br>discussed with the client prior for<br>example when we worked with St John the<br>key goal was to establish awareness<br>around the first aid program and<br>application mobile application so<br>students work on this issue and working<br>with different Target audiences and uh<br>the goal was to develop actionable<br>specific digital marketing<br>campaign um another example would be Eco<br>store the legendary eco-friendly<br>sustainable company in New Zealand so<br>the problem was was um it's not a<br>problem we had a several issues<br>marketing gaps so we worked with um and<br>the key goal was to find the way to lead<br>people to the website we st's website to<br>purchase their products on website<br>because retailers don't necessarily<br>provide the whole range of this<br>eco-friendly uh sustainable products um<br>and yeah it worked really well we always<br>have great feedback from our clients and<br>as I mentioned students enjoyed it the<br>most because this is the value and this<br>type of cooperation quite beneficial for<br>both the company and students very<br>exciting I guess an excellent way for<br>students to also prepare themselves for<br>for going out into the real world the<br>industry and we we suggest um to include<br>this project in the acvs to Showcase um<br>the capabilities and uh skills and<br>expertise because it's it's a again all<br>project they develop are doable<br>actionable implementable and has have a<br>lot of value yeah and again I guess it's<br>very similar as well for the master<br>applied Finance so we're already<br>engaging with a there a whole variety of<br>different entities and and companies in<br>the finance industry um who are<br>interested in in in having a group of<br>students working with them to to help<br>solve some kind of financial challenge<br>that they're facing so guess just to to<br>give you a few examples and it could be<br>something like a an internal Corporate<br>Finance related challenge that the<br>company's fac or it might be a might be<br>an investment related issue um involving<br>a financial services firm or a bank or<br>it could be something um Finance related<br>with the public sector entity as well so<br>I guess Finance is very Broad and then<br>there's a a whole range of different<br>types of entities and companies who are<br>interested in in working with our<br>students so so again an excellent<br>opportunities for for both the students<br>but also for the for the potential<br>employers to get a lot of Val<br>absolutely and now what advice would you<br>give people who are looking at<br>potentially studying a master of<br>business management<br>uh first of all I applaud you it's a<br>great choice MBM would be my choice if I<br>looking for again very skill-based<br>industry focused and future oriented<br>studies and the second uh and the advice<br>is about evaluating the study options<br>because we have we mentioned it all all<br>of us mention it we have a flexible<br>study options part-time and full-time<br>and sometimes students would like to<br>study full-time just to get the degree<br>quicker uh but it comes with all kind of<br>challenges so that's why I think it's um<br>quite important to have a honest<br>conversation with uh our program<br>administrators enrollment team to<br>understand what options available which<br>option works best for you if you have a<br>job if you have job Commitment if you<br>have a family and you want to have some<br>window to go for work so it's it's it's<br>important to have this conversation and<br>what about in terms of the master of<br>business analytics any particular advice<br>you'd give there well I think um what<br>inas just said about MBM program applies<br>to the uh master of business analytics<br>program as well again you must evaluate<br>the different options available and you<br>do have to make that decision of<br>understanding that there is this is a<br>big commitment that you are going into<br>it's 15 months of intensive work uh<br>requires a lot of time that you dedicate<br>into it so you do need to be prepared<br>for that and I think specifically from<br>the business analytics Master students<br>uh one thing I would say is you need to<br>be prepared to continue to learn because<br>we work with technology technology<br>evolves continuously the requirements to<br>analyze data will evolve continuously so<br>you need to be ready to address that<br>challenge you need to continue to learn<br>you need to continue to be curious<br>continue to ask questions and that's how<br>you will be able to provide value for<br>the organization as well so those are<br>two very important things that they must<br>continue to do I guess the only thing<br>I'd really add from my point of view is<br>just the The Importance of Being<br>passionate about the material right so<br>for the master of Applied Finance you<br>know if you're if you're thinking about<br>a change potentially going into the<br>finance industry you like a you're like<br>a fast moving industry you like to have<br>new challenges every day and you like<br>the excitement I guess the financial<br>markets then then it sounds like the<br>right program for<br>you the university offers numerous<br>scholarships to help Finance your<br>studies explore our wide range of<br>scholarships and awards by visiting the<br>University of Orland website and apply<br>deadlines the biggest difference between<br>MBA and MBM candidate is a professional<br>experience so simply speaking MBM um is<br>designed for people who are looking<br>for um entry level positions and they<br>are looking for specific skills<br>associated with um digital marketing or<br>strategic man management well and in<br>thank you very much for your time I hope<br>this session gave you some useful<br>insights into
