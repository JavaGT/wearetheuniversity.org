media in the New Zealand<br>2023 election uh and I will present some<br>new results from the New Zealand social<br>media study to you which I'm running as<br>the principal investigator and before I<br>show you the results I will give you a<br>little bit of background information on<br>how we collect that data uh and what the<br>study is about because of course data<br>doesn't fall from the sky and I'm not<br>making it up uh and so I think uh I owe<br>you a little bit of background<br>information on that first so how did<br>this project start um so first of all<br>this started out of a of the context of<br>a European project it's a comparative<br>project um and in 2019 ahead of the<br>European elections um European social<br>media Scholars started to collect data<br>on uh Facebook the German team also did<br>Twitter additionally they were analyzing<br>the campaigns of all parties um in the<br>countries which are participating in the<br>European elections uh and as you know<br>the European Parliament is in Strasburg<br>and that's why they called the project<br>campaigning for Strasburg and they had a<br>comparable measurement across uh All<br>European countries um so that they could<br>compare the Social Media communication<br>of the parties um after that across<br>countries so they thought this was very<br>successful um and so in 2020 they said<br>we are extending that to national<br>elections and they invited me for New<br>Zealand um meanwhile this is a project<br>that analyzes um national elections in<br>17 countries the first two for national<br>elections who were to join Were Us in<br>New Zealand as the New Zealand sub<br>project um and the israelian uh project<br>um and now they call it Digi world and<br>so there is a certain call of the<br>measurement instrument that I'm working<br>with that is comparable across countries<br>and elections so we can look at that and<br>of course there is also New Zealand<br>specific stuff uh in my uh data um<br>collection um that we are specifically<br>interested in here and so this project<br>was the New Zealand social media study<br>and we run it in the 2020 election for<br>the first time and since then we are the<br>only country in the world and the only<br>sub project who runs it permanently also<br>outside of election times so that's mean<br>that means I'm permanently studying um<br>the Social Media communication of all<br>parties and party leaders um um in New<br>Zealand also outside of election times<br>currently no other country does that for<br>that purpose we in 20202 founded the<br>internet social media and politics<br>research lab of which I'm the director<br>and basically the New Zealand social<br>media study it's it is its Flagship<br>study but of course we also do uh other<br>research uh around social media politics<br>and the internet um and so um what are<br>we doing in the New Zealand social media<br>study it's a partly computational and<br>partly manual media content analysis of<br>Facebook posts let me explain what that<br>means um so we are downloading with the<br>help of crowd tangle um the post of all<br>parties and party leaders outside of<br>election times monthly um and then we<br>analyze it uh crowd tangle is a Facebook<br>owned research company for which you can<br>um be accredited as a Facebook<br>researcher when you apply for that and<br>so we download all of that data and uh<br>analyze it um in election times we go in<br>weekly waves so that we are able to<br>basically live report during the<br>election we are always just one week<br>behind the election in our data analysis<br>so we download it the coders get to<br>analyze it I run the statistical<br>analysis and we usually put a blog post<br>out on the University's website then um<br>the study has a longitudinal cor so that<br>means on certain variables we collect<br>data over all waves that we are thinking<br>that we want to study over time that are<br>particularly important for us um on<br>others we are also able to on short<br>notice basically add other variables to<br>our codebook let's say when the freedom<br>Convoy protests were here in front of<br>parliament we added some variables on<br>that to our codebook to study that for<br>while but of course after that we stop<br>that again so we also have special topic<br>waves um and one month is always a wave<br>and in an election one week is a wave um<br>and so what we also do we allow buyin<br>for external clients um so uh for<br>example Greenpeace was one of our<br>external clients um they wanted to know<br>how the parties and the party leaders<br>are thinking about the environment<br>because they always running against the<br>same um uh kind of very strong attitudes<br>they think with their communication and<br>so whenever my coders had said post is<br>about the environment or climate change<br>they also went through a set of five<br>additional variables on behalf of Green<br>Peace like let's say does this post<br>state that the economy is more important<br>than the environment does this post<br>state that the environment is just for<br>our personal enjoyment so we do allow<br>external clients to buy themselves uh<br>into the study and we usually use uh<br>that money to reinvest into our research<br>again and enable me to run that study<br>longer because of course you can imagine<br>my student coders need to get paid so<br>they get an an hourly loan for doing<br>that the sample as I said before is<br>parties and party leaders um and we do<br>all posts of them um the manual part so<br>some variables we automatically um do<br>computational so we can get the number<br>of comments loves likes and hahas on<br>Facebook we can get that automatically<br>uh automatically know who the Facebook<br>page owner is what the data of the<br>Facebook post was so we don't have to do<br>that stuff but we have of course trained<br>as student coders to analyze things like<br>how negative is a post so if you have a<br>scale from very negative to somewhat<br>negative to neutral to um somewhat<br>positive to very positive um they are<br>basically rating that and they have been<br>trained on that for a long time using a<br>codebook which is a handbook with<br>written instructions of how these<br>concepts are defined what do we mean by<br>hate speech what do me mean by fake F<br>news what do we mean by a half truth or<br>negative campaigning so that they just<br>follow those rules in that codebook and<br>not apply just their subjective judgment<br>um but kind of follow like little robots<br>the rules that we have basically defined<br>on uh what that is and of course you can<br>disagree with me on the definition<br>because there's no right or wrong in the<br>social sciences but I have to be<br>transparent of course that's why this is<br>all uh written down in a codebook on how<br>we Define those Concepts and we can also<br>measure how good they are in the<br>agreeing so do they just apply their own<br>um subjective judgment or do they follow<br>the rules that we have written down in<br>that codebook but that we usually run<br>reliability tests um which check how<br>they agree so if we have a reliability<br>coefficient of 08 later that means that<br>in 80% of the cases our coders would<br>agree that what they are seeing here is<br>fake news um so that means there is a<br>certain common meeting ground between<br>them regarding that and that they are<br>that we have achieved that common<br>meeting ground because they are<br>following the definition of that Concept<br>in the codebook um so as I said the<br>interim results are published weekly and<br>a Blog on our website and um uh you can<br>look that up in the news section so<br>who's currently in our sample we have<br>reduced it a little bit for the election<br>because we are under a lot of time uh<br>pressure to go through that data in the<br>election so outside of election times we<br>analyze about a th000 posts per month um<br>currently um we had in the first two<br>week 1,000<br>555 posts and you have to think about<br>that the human coders have to go through<br>that and the codebook is about 30 pages<br>long so they go through that and it<br>takes them about six minutes to analyze<br>one post and those are currently the<br>parties that are in our sample and their<br>leaders if the leaders have an active<br>Facebook page that for example is not<br>the case in case of Hana Tamaki she is<br>just posting private stuff on her page<br>so we would just always Cote that as<br>non-political and so it's not very<br>informative for our purpose that's why<br>her leader page is not in there um the<br>leader of the nnp for example has a<br>closed Facebook page and so that's<br>private and we respect that and we can't<br>go get into that content so we are not<br>analyzing it either and Leon Baker is a<br>case for whom we only have his personal<br>page which at the same time is his party<br>page there is no separate party page but<br>for all of the others basically with<br>means we have a party page and a party<br>leader page so labor would mean Hipkins<br>and the labor party<br>and also no subsections of the<br>party<br>so um what about the volume how much are<br>they posting in this election um so we<br>uh in the first week actually had less<br>than we had in 2020 in the second week<br>uh we now have uh out done 2020 so we<br>have more than in 2020 um the party who<br>post three times as much as they did in<br>2020 is the act party and in particular<br>David Seymour so they have really<br>decided Ed that they want to run a very<br>active social media campaign um and so<br>David Seymour apparently has um the<br>ambition to become New Zealand's new<br>social media Powerhouse that in the post<br>adur area um so he is really on um uh<br>Facebook uh and very active there um the<br>other parties National is doing more<br>than labor um and the green party and<br>the Mari party are posting less but<br>usually uh we also see a lot of uh posts<br>uh and disproportionately high number<br>from Posts given how they are doing in<br>the polls so most of them are polling<br>under 1% uh in particular of the French<br>parties um but one of the reasons why<br>they are so active like the New Zealand<br>outdoors and freedoms party um on social<br>media is that they of course get less<br>coverage and they have less news value<br>uh in the traditional media and so this<br>is their channel to reach out to their<br>voters um so it's not surprising that<br>they post a lot of stuff uh on Facebook<br>and that actually from the New Zealand<br>outd and Freedom Party we see most of<br>the post but the number of their<br>followers is also much lower than of<br>course in case of Labor or national so<br>um the labor party I think currently has<br>around 300K followers um the national<br>party has something around 150k and the<br>New Zealand outter and Freedom Party in<br>comparison only has 30k followers so<br>they also reach a much smaller audience<br>um with what they are<br>posting so what about the political<br>topics um they are posting uh about um<br>not very surprising the political<br>scientists would say it's mostly the<br>economy it's the economy stupid already<br>Clinton's campaign manager in 1992 knew<br>that um so most of the Social Media<br>communication is about the economy<br>that's rational um for the parties<br>because um this is also the topic that<br>either ranks the highest among voters in<br>surveys or is among the highest ranked<br>uh topics usually um this is very much<br>also driven by the National Party the<br>national party is focusing much more on<br>the E econom even than labor is doing of<br>course makes sense because this pays off<br>for them in a certain way we are in a<br>cost of living crisis um and not<br>accusing the government of being<br>responsible uh for that would be<br>surprising if they are not doing that um<br>very often um the parties are also<br>emphasizing of course what we call uh<br>competence issues so issues they are<br>associated with associated with in the<br>eyes of Voters for being competent in<br>handling them for green parties this is<br>the environment for labor parties all<br>around the world this is usually social<br>issues so this is of course issues that<br>they um emphasize a lot in their social<br>Media communication to make them become<br>more Salient um and so um we see labor<br>for example also this is their second<br>most important uh issue um highlighting<br>Labor uh and social issues however the<br>economy is still number one for them<br>because first of all it's the the<br>Salient Topic at the moment H and<br>secondly it seems to be that the<br>national party is driving the campaign<br>agenda at the moment and that they are<br>following um we see other parties um<br>extremely high for example domestic<br>policy is for ACT um I think one of the<br>reasons for this is uh that National is<br>not covering it as much they are<br>focusing more on the economy this time<br>and so they have left a little bit of a<br>void for the ACT party uh in the system<br>and a lot of this is around the treaty<br>and co-governance um and they in their<br>opposition to that um so what about how<br>popular the candidates and the parties<br>are on social media let's look at Emoji<br>reactions um and don't make the mistake<br>some journalists make that they always<br>ask me if from that you can guess who's<br>winning the election you can't so um<br>first of all only the people who like<br>the parties follow them usually on<br>social media of course there's also<br>journalists uh among them uh who follow<br>that stuff there is me who follows<br>almost every party so I always hope that<br>not everyone thinks that I like some of<br>them but um it's for professional<br>reasons um but most of the people who do<br>that they actually follow them because<br>they like them um and so because this is<br>kind of a version of a modern yach sign<br>you in a certain way expose yourself as<br>a follower of that party if you do that<br>and that's why we see much less angry um<br>and sad reactions uh for um for for<br>luxon and Hipkins here H we see much<br>more likes and loves um so luxon seems<br>to be a little so his post seems to be a<br>little more popular uh with um uh<br>Facebook followers on his page than<br>those of Chris Hipkins but apparently if<br>the labor supporters like it then they<br>really like it and they directly love it<br>um but um there is not that much in<br>terms of how they will do in the<br>election that you can guess from that we<br>also found basically the same structure<br>for J ad Judith Collins in the last<br>election also mostly positive reactions<br>um so uh the same for labor and the<br>National Party um also a little bit more<br>likes for for the national party but<br>labor supporters if they are in they are<br>really in they love it um so what about<br>negative campaigning uh in in this<br>election um so we have heard very often<br>um that the parties have used this as<br>strategic move of course accusing each<br>other of growing dirty um so um the<br>natural party said that labor is running<br>the most negative Campaign Of All Times<br>um and that there would be very personal<br>attacks against Christopher Laxon on the<br>other hand labor said that's not true<br>there are a lot of attack acts against<br>us and they are very thin skinned uh and<br>it's actually worse what we are getting<br>um but that's a strategic move uh so<br>they they are both going negative of<br>course um but I will show you in a<br>second that overall it's still more<br>posit positivity um so let's answer the<br>question that Chris Bishop has raised<br>has um be kind become nasty on social<br>media so here we have uh the percentage<br>um of positive less negative posts for<br>the labor party and the national party<br>so if we um from the positive post<br>substract the negative posts and a post<br>can be both or it can be neither we get<br>the net positivity so how much<br>positivity is left there H and actually<br>it seems like the labor party uh 63% um<br>of their communication uh is net<br>positive whereas the National Party only<br>5.5% of their social Media communication<br>um is net positive I look all shocked<br>I'm not um because I would be shocked if<br>it would be the other way around so the<br>national party is the Challenger party<br>here um and the uh labor party is the<br>incumbent and what does an incumbent do<br>defend their record so they campaign on<br>a positive uh achievement they like to<br>say to people look this is what we<br>achieved give us three more years so<br>this this is a typical incumbent style<br>of campaigning um Challenger parties<br>they would not do their job if they<br>would not be attacking a government uh<br>and that is also a core task of<br>democratic campaigning um to actually<br>hold the incumbent accountable uh for<br>Stuff um and so National is actually<br>really doing their job here so this is<br>this is negative campaigning but not<br>necessarily a negative picture uh for<br>them so um it might uh tell us that the<br>accusation that labor is going harder<br>against them is not correct but it tells<br>us that they're doing their job as a<br>challenger party and as the opposition<br>they are attacking labor in a pretty<br>Fierce uh uh campaign um and uh so this<br>is what we are seeing here and it's a<br>picture that you see in elections all<br>around the world so this would not be<br>different for for any other election um<br>so what about Hipkins versus Laxon there<br>it's not as pronounced the difference<br>between the two but it's the same still<br>the same pattern so Hipkins is more<br>positive and luxon uh is attacking more<br>uh in the end um but why is the<br>difference not as pronounced um as for<br>uh the parties um so also a pattern that<br>we see all around the world is that um<br>high-profile people uh ministers and<br>others they leave it to their parties<br>the party leaders to attack and they're<br>not doing it themselves in case because<br>there's always a certain risk that stuff<br>can backfire so you leave it to the um<br>basically lower ranked people and to the<br>parties in the US they very often like<br>to Outsource the negative campaigning to<br>the political action committees the PS<br>so they run the most negative ads and so<br>it's clear that Christopher Laxon should<br>stay free of any kind of stains in that<br>campaign um in case something would<br>backfire an attack so they leave it more<br>to the party to attack and less uh to<br>him um so what about the main targets uh<br>pretty rational so National runs a very<br>rational attack campaign here so their<br>targets are of course labor Hipkins and<br>the New Zealand government um so this is<br>a challenger party going against uh an<br>incumbent but of course also the Mari<br>and the green parties potential<br>Coalition Partners uh get attacked um<br>and then there is a certain amount of<br>random others after that it Fizzles out<br>um what about the labor party um so<br>there we have again National and luxen<br>being attacked makes sense this is their<br>uh their direct competitor but also it's<br>not as rational as the uh parties attack<br>strategy so it's not such a clear attack<br>strategy there's also a random amount of<br>other people um that get attacked in<br>their negative uh posts so what are the<br>policy areas where's the Battleground<br>it's the economy stupid again um and so<br>they mostly attack each other on the<br>field of the economy a little bit on<br>domestic policies and transport and<br>infrastructure um but the main<br>Battleground in this election is the<br>economy um so this is where most of the<br>negative posts are<br>um same for the labor party um and so<br>this is also they attack mostly in the<br>field of the economy this might pay off<br>for National more uh in in in a certain<br>way if uh because this is the topic that<br>usually center right parties are<br>associated with as being competent in<br>the eyes of the voters for the labor<br>party it would be much more much better<br>if labor and social uh would be the<br>Salient topic um and this would be the<br>Battleground uh in this election however<br>negative campaigning is not necessarily<br>bad if you want to ask that so are they<br>doing democracy a disfavor there is<br>something called the demobilization<br>hypothesis um in uh political<br>communication research so for a long<br>time we thought negative campaigning<br>might effect turn out negatively and<br>people would not turn out um overall<br>there is inconclusive research results<br>on that and that could not be confirmed<br>in a meter analysis of all studies uh<br>that overall there is less evidence for<br>the demobilization hypothesis um so some<br>studies found that it leads to<br>mobilization others found uh that it<br>leads to demobilization can still be<br>demobilizing for for subgroups uh this<br>morning for example I had a conversation<br>with someone from Mari radio station who<br>says that Mari feel very um basically<br>demobilized uh uh and um tune out of<br>politics um if a lot of the fake news<br>are around and the negative campaigning<br>are around race based issues um which I<br>totally get um so this can still be the<br>group case for subgroups that this is<br>affecting them more than others um so um<br>but American Research has shown actually<br>that the biggest problem is when the<br>negative posts outweigh the positive<br>posts um so if we look at the net<br>positivity again and from the positive<br>post substract the negative post um then<br>uh what do we get overall so what's the<br>level of POS uh positivity across all<br>parties um it is pretty good it would be<br>bad if I would that line would be below<br>zero that would mean that negative posts<br>would outweigh positive posts um but<br>that is not the case overall we see<br>across all parties that still the<br>positivity is out weighing the<br>negativity um and that means there might<br>not be a demobilizing effect on turnout<br>in in that case um uh and so this is<br>even dragged down by some of the smaller<br>parties who show more negative um uh<br>campaign communication so the topic that<br>everyone is always interested in the<br>most uh is how much business<br>misinformation there's an end missing uh<br>do we see on social media you always<br>spot the types once they are in front of<br>you on the slides or when you have<br>submitted something to a conference of<br>course you see the types after that<br>that's the best way to find them um so<br>this is still the beginning of the<br>campaign that can still change over the<br>course of the campaign um so we have<br>measured fake news and Hal truth um so<br>um fake news are fully made up and<br>intentionally in verifiably false<br>stories uh when something is really<br>fully made up a post um and we have<br>measured Hal truth because we already in<br>2020 figured out that the New Zealand<br>parties are very often flying under the<br>radar of these full-fledged fake news<br>that we have seen for the Us and other<br>countries there is very often posts<br>where everything is correct just once<br>detail is a little bit dodgy over<br>interpreted highly selectively Chosen<br>and not fully correct so this is bending<br>the truth as I would say but not full<br>fake news so I show you the results on<br>that in a second um so that's why also<br>the half truth are higher because also<br>the established parties are engaging in<br>bending the truth now and then um but<br>the real fake news are not as high I was<br>very worried ahead of that election<br>because in 2020 we did not find much<br>fake news of over 3,000 posts we<br>analyzed in the last four week before<br>the election less than 20 were fake news<br>and less than 75 were half truth so that<br>was 2.5% back then but as I told you<br>before um I'm analyzing this constantly<br>so we more monitor that over time and<br>shortly before the election in around<br>June we were at 6% and so I was<br>wondering how this would look like in<br>the election but this is not the full<br>picture for the full election yet<br>because of course we are not there yet<br>so we are still in the data analysis but<br>currently we are standing um at not that<br>much Facebook like 2.5% so it's not too<br>bad and U more Hal truth of course and<br>let's look at who's spreading that stuff<br>um so in the in the first uh um uh part<br>of the election that we have analyzed um<br>we find is mostly for the part parties<br>under the freedom coalitions umbrella um<br>and it's very much driven by the New<br>Zealand Outdoors uh and Freedom Party<br>also by Vision New Zealand um there are<br>a few that might still kind of join that<br>club like andz loyal because we have<br>seen them in our data before uh<br>spreading a lot of that stuff and not so<br>much uh in the first part of this<br>campaign now I guess they were a little<br>bit busy with mourning that they had<br>forgotten to to um register candidates<br>um so then with spreading fake news what<br>do I mean by fake news here's an example<br>um so sue gr the leader of the New<br>Zealand outter and freedoms party for<br>example has spread the litter box hoax<br>that you might have heard about um that<br>is claiming that uh kids in schools<br>demanded litter boxes um because they<br>identified as cats or furries and this<br>is how far the transgender thing and all<br>the pronoun thing would go these days so<br>actually this is a hidden attack against<br>transgender people and it has been<br>debunked several times and that hoax has<br>been spreading from the UK but Sue gray<br>has raised it here and it has even H<br>gotten a poor principal of a New Zealand<br>School uh suddenly into the middle of a<br>media frany because he was accused by<br>them of having litter boxes in his<br>classroom and he said like no we don't<br>have any but uh this is the kind of<br>stuff that we code under fake news we<br>reserve that for very severe cases<br>because we acknowledge freedom of speech<br>um and so we do not likely um because<br>who am I to decide what the truth is but<br>there are still I think facts where we<br>can say this is simply false information<br>so we reserve it to that and we have um<br>voluntarily chosen to rather under than<br>overestimate fake news um so what about<br>full-fledged conspiracy theories how<br>much of that stuff is full-fledged<br>conspiracy theories it's the same<br>suspects um who are posting full-fledged<br>conspiracy theories um over the course<br>in between the elections we have also<br>seen a bit from New Zealand first on<br>conspiracy theories currently not we<br>will see if that changes when we have<br>fully analyzed the data um so what do I<br>mean by conspiracy theories I give you a<br>little bit of a taste again on what I<br>mean by<br>cursor<br>all right so why is that conspiracy<br>theory um for the simple reason oops um<br>that um basically they are addressing<br>some undefined globalists here um and uh<br>are not kind of telling us who these<br>globalists are they are very much um<br>against the UN since the um local<br>elections already and are spreading that<br>basically the UN is secretly ruling New<br>Zealand um and of course it's not like<br>that money from ordinary new zealanders<br>goes in any to kind of undefined<br>globalist bank accounts um so um what<br>are the targeted groups by the<br>disinformation uh post so I not mean<br>their targets but the ones that they are<br>reaching out to that they are explicitly<br>addressing that they try to be appealing<br>to so the audience they try to be<br>appealing to uh is very much a vaccine<br>skeptic it's the former Freedom Convoy<br>protesters and it's very conservative uh<br>voters um so they try to actually<br>reconnect to the height of their<br>movement which where the freedom Convoy<br>protests in front of Parliament and<br>tried to get those people to turn out<br>with I think doubtful success at the<br>moment because they are not doing that<br>well in the polls and of course<br>conservative voters why their stuff so<br>let me um uh close only three more<br>slides then I'm done and Ellie can take<br>over with half truth um and why this is<br>higher we also see this uh from<br>established parties all across the<br>political Spectrum usually so we have<br>found that all across the political<br>Spectrum in our data before in the first<br>part of the campaign we have found it<br>for some Hal Truth for National and act<br>and and their leaders but don't<br>overestimate that behind that are not<br>many incidents actually so the nend is<br>low so this is like four or six<br>incidents where we have found something<br>that was not fully correct in their post<br>but most of it was right and to give you<br>an example Again by what this would be<br>um coded so for example here we have<br>David Seymour stating that former<br>communist countries are now um richer<br>that we felt sorry for are now richer<br>than New Zealand uh and he points out<br>Lithuania there so first of all this<br>oecd data is not the latest oecd data um<br>there is a newer oecd data second this<br>is a highly selected indicator and the<br>GDP per work hour is actually an<br>indicator of Labor productivity and not<br>an indicator of the wealth of a country<br>New Zealand is still more wealthy than<br>all of the former communist countries<br>and it's also still much closer uh to<br>the US and Australia in the ranking of<br>wealth of countries um so this is kind<br>of an misleading interpretation of a<br>fact that of Labor productivity on the<br>other hand the national party here has<br>one um where it's correct that the<br>ministry for Pacific people has spent<br>that amount of money on certain<br>breakfast for stakeholders in the<br>Pacific Community so that's all fully<br>correct um but they are suggesting<br>basically that it's a campaign event<br>which was which had the purpose to<br>promote labor um M peace it was a<br>standard Ministry events and the Pacific<br>ccus of the labor party was one of the<br>stakeholders who was co- inviting so<br>there was actually um no reason to say<br>that or to suggest to people that this<br>was an event to promote MPS of the labor<br>party so these would be half truth most<br>of it is right but something is not<br>accurate um of course this is still<br>higher so um for the parties outside of<br>parliament than for the parties inside<br>of parliament um and that's it from my<br>side you can follow us on Twitter if<br>you're interested in the results from<br>this study um and also we have two of<br>our blog posts out already that you find<br>under news on Victoria University's web<br>page and there are two more following<br>one before the election still next<br>Thursday and one after the election<br>which is basically an overview that's it<br>from my<br>side I'm in computer science and the<br>first kind of weird thing is that there<br>should even be a computer scientist<br>talking about sort of political currents<br>of opinion leading up to an election<br>it's a weird thing but these days<br>technology is quite influential in the<br>way that information is spread around<br>the world and that's why I'm here I<br>guess so I'm interested in in this<br>general question and I've been asked to<br>talk specifically about the New Zealand<br>election that we're in the middle of<br>right now so I'll try and do that so<br>there's two systems that I'll talk about<br>um one of them is social media<br>recommended systems uh which is like the<br>way social media runs basically is<br>driven by technology is driven by AI is<br>driven by Machine learning and I'm going<br>to go into some of the trends that that<br>uh we know something about although we<br>don't know all the details um that seem<br>to have an influence on on the way that<br>information spreads around on social<br>media they're driven by<br>technology uh so yeah the idea is that<br>the the technology that runs social<br>media platforms has some sort of<br>influence uh on political communication<br>and on cultural uh sort of opinions and<br>on public opinion and political opinion<br>um and those might have an indirect<br>influence on using<br>through the influence that they have on<br>public opinion which leads to people to<br>support one party or another I suppose<br>ultimately um the other thing I'll talk<br>about uh which is the thing that people<br>mostly think about when they think of AI<br>in relation to political communication<br>and political currents of opinion is<br>these new things that arise that have<br>been here for a couple of years called<br>generative AI systems so for instance<br>chat GPT is the one that most people<br>have heard about uh and they can have<br>more of a direct influence but the short<br>messag is that we haven't seen very much<br>of of that kind of thing in uh in the<br>current election so social media is<br>where I'll start um I won't take too<br>long about this I've got time for<br>questions so most kiwis are social media<br>users and get at least some of their<br>news content from social media people<br>spend lot people who do use social media<br>spend large amounts of time on it I<br>think two and a half hours per day on<br>average is about the the right number<br>for New Zealand but I I might be<br>remembering it wrong I thought that<br>maybe Mona would have a better number so<br>I didn't put a specific number from one<br>I found it's quite difficult to find<br>Reliable statistics on this<br>um the point I want to sort of emphasize<br>is that social media platforms really<br>run on AI because when you're a user of<br>social media and you get a feed of<br>content for instance a news feed on<br>Facebook or something like that the<br>thing that decides what order you see<br>items in what comes first what's ranked<br>as the most important thing for you to<br>see is decided by a machine learning<br>algorithm it's decided automatically<br>that you know everyone has different<br>feeds and the reason why is partly<br>because they have different friends and<br>And subscribe to different things but<br>partly because there's a system that's<br>looking at what they're doing and<br>monitoring what they're doing working<br>out what they like what every individual<br>person likes and then trying to give<br>them more of the same right so let me<br>just uh flesh that out so a recom so the<br>thing that does that is called a<br>recommended system it's a pure machine<br>Learning System it's pure Ai and that's<br>the kind of that the petrol which makes<br>recommended which makes social media<br>platforms so popular they can customize<br>content to and you and you and that's<br>why people like to use them I<br>guess so what it does it monitors your<br>your behavior and your behavior let's<br>just pick one person let's say it's me<br>so watch is what I'm doing watch is what<br>I like watch is how long I watch certain<br>videos how often I hover my my moue over<br>some particular image how often I<br>comment on something or repost it all of<br>those things are engagement it it sort<br>of picks up on those things and learns<br>not about individual pieces of content<br>but types of content so the social media<br>recommender algorithm learning uh device<br>goes away and groups users into types of<br>user and groups content into types of<br>content and then says Ah that's sort of<br>person lik that sort of thing and then<br>it works out on that basis what to give<br>you next and that and so you prioritize<br>things in your news feed and a feed<br>about who you might like to follow and<br>all sorts of feeds so social media<br>algorithms have many<br>feeds so that would be okay but for the<br>fact that there are some interesting<br>kind of well documented<br>and slightly dodgy cognitive biases that<br>you might imagine push the recommender<br>algorithm to learn something about you<br>which you might not necessarily want it<br>to learn or you might not expect to be<br>it to be learning and I'll just mention<br>a few of those um so here's one that's<br>relevant to politics and I don't know<br>how this connects with what mono was<br>saying but political content that<br>contains high moral emotions whether<br>they're positive or negative actually<br>people like that people click on it<br>people disseminate it people forward it<br>people comment on it it's more engaging<br>and that stuff travels faster than other<br>stuff it's kind of interesting this is<br>you know data from a couple of years ago<br>it's very very well established<br>pre-registered studies good good<br>empirical stuff here's another one also<br>very interesting more I think by the<br>same group actually um anything which is<br>about the others politically you know<br>like them or something whether it's<br>positive or negative actually it goes<br>both ways people like to click on that<br>people like to look at it they like to<br>should share it it travels<br>faster okay why why are these things<br>true this is just this is cognitive<br>science right these are cognitive biases<br>there are certain things that get us<br>going and that make us want to engage<br>with certain sorts of content but you<br>might imagine that there are slightly<br>worrying consequences of this for the<br>overall ecosystem here's another one<br>false stuff travels faster than true<br>stuff this is a bit older but it's<br>pretty well established I think and why<br>is that maybe false stuff is surprising<br>you know like what the hell and so you<br>click on it but the recommender<br>algorithm doesn't know that you're<br>clicking on it because you're thinking<br>what the hell it just thinks ah user a<br>likes content B and so they give you<br>more of that and then you might start to<br>get used to it who knows so I'm being a<br>bit you know there's a cause the concern<br>here I'm I'm trying to sort of elaborate<br>for you um if recommender algorithms<br>learn from these cognitive biases they<br>might progressively push users in<br>certain directions which might not be<br>very good and you know you might explain<br>some currents of political opinion like<br>that now I don't want to go overboard on<br>this because we just don't know if this<br>is true or not we don't know we should<br>know and the only way of really knowing<br>is to get inside companies uh to find<br>out from the inside because they have<br>the best methods by far of doing this<br>but we don't yet have access however<br>there's been a new law passed in the EU<br>may have heard about the Digital<br>Services act um and it's specifically a<br>regulation about social media it has<br>specific obligations on the large<br>companies and the uh uh the the legis<br>sorry the um The Regulators in the EU<br>under this Digital Services act we're<br>going to have a lot of power to audit<br>companies and find out answers to the<br>sort of questions that are raised here<br>so we'll know more soon we don't know it<br>yet but I just mention all this because<br>it's a it's a potential influence on the<br>Dynamics of of discussions in politics<br>at the moment and we've heard from from<br>Mona about what the the party people are<br>saying but we don't know what everyone<br>else is saying that's not not part of<br>your analysis and so you just might<br>imagine what might be happen but we need<br>to know more is the basic thing here<br>regular policy makers don't know enough<br>about about this yet people is like<br>looking after the the health of<br>Elections don't know enough about this<br>and hopefully the EU will provide us uh<br>more answers and and our group uh is is<br>is the global partnership for AI is is<br>is working with EU Regulators to do this<br>so that's all I wanted to say about<br>generative AI tools sorry about social<br>media stuff it's like that's a concern<br>that we need to know more about and we<br>will hopefully find out more through the<br>the EU regulation that's in<br>place second thing I want to talk about<br>is generative AI tools I so this is<br>things like um this is this is a new<br>concern this this time around that we<br>didn't have last and I think that's why<br>lots of people have been asking about<br>this we didn't have chat GPT last year<br>we didn't have mid Journey last year but<br>just to give you an example so a text<br>generator like chat tb2 gbd which is<br>very available to people many people<br>have tried it out you can get it to<br>produce texts that kind of like that<br>present this information or present<br>lious kind of like scandalous content<br>about people and you can make them look<br>very good because it writes very well<br>and so it can seem to be something that<br>you'd find in a newspaper for instance<br>um so there there are guard rails that<br>you have to get over but there are lots<br>of jailbreaks that people can quite<br>readily learn about that allow people to<br>generate quite scarless stuff awful<br>stuff sometimes actually um if if they<br>put a bit of work in and certainly the<br>bar for producing this information um is<br>much lower than it used to be both in<br>terms of the amount of of content you<br>can create and also in terms of the<br>quality you don't need to be a good<br>writer anymore in order to generate<br>content which is quite high<br>level it's the same with image<br>generators so for instance mid journey<br>is is a well-known one you can type in<br>something saying I'd like you know<br>picture of Ali dressed in a clown suit<br>or a picture of I don't know Donald<br>Trump dressed in a clown suit or<br>something and bang you get it no problem<br>and so that is also a vehicle for a new<br>vehicle this this time around this this<br>election around for thisinformation<br>that's specifically to do with<br>images so there have been many concerns<br>including New Zealand but around the<br>world basically that democracies are<br>going to be destabilized by the new<br>abilities that there are to create<br>disinformation at industrial scales with<br>with tools like these um I would say in<br>New Zealand election there hasn't been<br>too much on this and just I mean I<br>haven't got chapter on verse but I did<br>talk just yesterday to a journalist who<br>had done a bit more kind of uh research<br>on this who' talked to the Electoral<br>commission who talked to the ASA and the<br>BSA and there was only one concern out<br>of all that that was raised and so I<br>think that's a reasonable sign of course<br>how would we know right how would we<br>know you know when you see a thing when<br>you see something on social media how do<br>you know whether it was written by a<br>machine or a person because the things<br>quite good at generating text now and<br>quite convincing and I'll get to that at<br>the end that's the point I'll finish<br>on I will talk about the one concern<br>that that you might have come across if<br>youd been looking at the news so there<br>was a little while ago back in May uh uh<br>the story uh from one news that uh that<br>National had used AI image generator mid<br>Journey that thing I was talking about<br>to produce some of its ads and this is<br>one of the examples so this is something<br>it was produced it's a picture of<br>specific healthcare workers um that was<br>generated by a machine not by a not by a<br>person these aren't real people<br>so is that okay um here's another one<br>there was a few of them so here's<br>another one using this not so this is I<br>think you would what Mona would call an<br>attack ad would that be an attack ad or<br>yeah attack yeah so very much appealing<br>to God there's going to be more crime<br>and something like that so that's<br>another one um and here's another one<br>that's another real one the interesting<br>thing is because this was done on Mid<br>journey and mid Journey uh if you're<br>using it you have to use this other<br>social media thing actually called<br>twitch and produce the images on that<br>and everyone can see them and so the the<br>investigative journalist from one news<br>who who who uh who reported this stuff<br>also found the user who was creating<br>these ads for the national part and<br>actually Danel party didn't originally<br>know about it but it's interesting to<br>see some of the kind of attempts which<br>were also a story in in one news about<br>that that were created I don't we have<br>the prompts here that we use to generate<br>these texts but here are some rejected<br>images so these are images that the the<br>person who was creating these ads by<br>machine was generating and say actually<br>we won't use that one we won't use that<br>one they're a bit weird or something<br>like that or here's a slightly weird but<br>a bit too over the top let's not use<br>that one here's another one rejected for<br>some reason here's a great one every so<br>often mid Journey just kind of spits the<br>dummy and giv you something weird um and<br>you can sort of look at this and you<br>could sort of trace the creative process<br>by which these pictures were made and<br>sort of refin and stuff which is what<br>you do um luxon had no idea this was<br>going on actually he denied it would<br>been used to start with because it was<br>like something you wouldn't expect I but<br>it's completely new all this stuff um a<br>national spokesperson acknowledged that<br>they had used AI to create stop images<br>and I think the issue here is that all<br>they're doing is you know shortcutting<br>the process of going away and finding<br>models and taking photographs or<br>creating imagery like they're saving<br>money and it was probably just one<br>particular contractor in the marketing<br>department who was doing this stuff um<br>so uh the um the the the National Party<br>spokesman said it's an in innoved way to<br>drive our social media so there was a<br>little bit of sort of attempt to justify<br>this um but they did want to use it<br>responsibly if they using it responsibly<br>they should have said that it was AI<br>generator I think<br>um luxon actually has a positive story<br>about this at one point because they<br>wanted to present themselves as the<br>party that was s of like the most Adept<br>at technology and the most sort of like<br>on on board with current affairs and<br>current current<br>technology um anyway there's a broader<br>step here I just want to briefly mention<br>before we go to questions which is that<br>AI can do more so it can produce video<br>content as well you can have fake video<br>footage footage of politicians saying<br>things you put words into the mouth of<br>politician and have them say things that<br>might be potentially worrying and<br>potentially very kind of concrete piece<br>of thisinformation we haven't seen any<br>of that all we saw with these static<br>images which really are a small you know<br>a small thing in relation to what would<br>be possible um and we haven't seen any<br>fake um newspaper reports or any fake<br>textual reports but again how would we<br>know but we don't think there are any we<br>think that if there had been some<br>someone would have noticed it um here's<br>the thing that I think is an interesting<br>one so if you're on social media and you<br>have the ability to uh to generate<br>content and you have the ability to<br>Target messages at particular<br>demographics or particular groups of<br>people uh then by combining those two<br>things you have really something quite<br>powerful in the area of misinformation<br>which we're not seeing yet but you could<br>see this and so I'm thinking like for<br>instance uh AI enhanced social media<br>targeting for politics that's something<br>that came up in in in cambrid analytica<br>a few years ago that was in 2013 when a<br>company gathered personality information<br>from Facebook users and then targeted<br>political messages at voters based on<br>their personality if they had high<br>degrees of introversion then you'd show<br>them this if they had high degrees of<br>openness to new experiences you would<br>give them this and so on so that's you<br>know okay potentially just targeting but<br>if you're targeting ads and also<br>generating misinformation you can Target<br>misinformation to people in very subtle<br>ways um which might be very<br>destabilizing I think but we haven't<br>seen any of<br>that yeah but if it was delivered on<br>social media it would would be hired to<br>detect I think that's the interesting<br>thing because um social media messages<br>that go out to ordinary citizens are not<br>easy to mon monitor even for people like<br>Mona who's who's able to monitor<br>publicly available news feeds but going<br>below the radar to individuals and<br>targeting individuals that's a lot<br>harder and more of a worry so that's<br>what I want to finish with uh it's it's<br>this sort of general question again just<br>a very general one in this election we<br>don't think so uh that AI generators<br>have have been at<br>all destabilized<br>but we need to be serious about this<br>issue going forward and and one thing<br>you could do I don't think you should is<br>is to ban the use of AI content<br>generation in elections but you could<br>also require disclosure of AI generated<br>content and that would be a more<br>sensible position to take uh the recent<br>review of New Zealand electoral law<br>which just came out in June didn't<br>mention anything about that that might<br>have been a missed opportunity um but in<br>any case how would you enforce a rule<br>like this and we've done a little bit of<br>work which I'll finish with which is<br>about how you can Ure en some<br>transparency about AI generated content<br>so this again comes from this group that<br>I I'm part of the global partnership on<br>AI I I lead a responsible AI project in<br>there which is specifically on social<br>media so we're thinking about<br>recommender algorithms and Har of<br>contact classifiers and stuff like that<br>but we also have a a suggestion about<br>generative AI safety and that is in a<br>nutshell that we need Reliable Tools for<br>detecting AI generated content what we<br>want is something which an ordinary<br>citizen could use or a social media<br>company could use incidentally to take<br>any piece of content they see and just<br>ask did it come from a machine or a<br>person or some mixture of those two we<br>would like that automated tool to be<br>available um it's actually very hard to<br>build that tool there are many tools out<br>there that claim to be able to do that<br>at the minute but they don't really work<br>and and our our suggestion our proposal<br>is that the only way of making them work<br>reliably is to get the companies that<br>make the generators to instrument their<br>generators to support um detection uh of<br>the content that their stuff produces um<br>so our our view is that responsibility<br>falls on the companies uh making the<br>generators for building detectors that<br>can detect the content of those<br>generators produce so in in the in the<br>in a nutshell here's what we suggest a<br>company that that's develops a new gen<br>AI system should be required by law to<br>demonstrate a reliable detection<br>mechanism for the content that that uh<br>system generates as a condition of that<br>system's public release and if you can't<br>produce that reliable protector and make<br>it available to the public then you<br>shouldn't release your model because<br>it's not safe it's not transparent so<br>that's had some traction actually so<br>we've had quite famous AI people um uh<br>support this and co-author the the<br>papers that we've written uh and it's<br>sort of been Incorporated by the EU<br>parliament in its amendments to the AI<br>that go specifically to um generative Ai<br>and it's actually been talked about in<br>the US Senate as well quite recently<br>again our co-authors were uh asked to<br>give evidence here in here in a in a in<br>a in a senate hearing which is a bit<br>like the movie Oppenheimer where there's<br>these Senators who saying asking about<br>you know some new technology and getting<br>the scientists to tell them about it and<br>say whether it's safe or not so I I<br>think I'll finish there um there are<br>some references to that stuff if<br>anyone's<br>interested</p></main><footer style="margin-top: 2rem; background: #0001; padding: 2rem; text-align: center;"><p>We Are The University</p><ul style="list-style-type: none; padding: 0;
