and here from a current<br>student and a recent graduate would you<br>guys mind introducing yourselves sure<br>Mike hello everyone my name is Sabrina I<br>work for fish and P appliances as MPI<br>manager I'm the current student of M7<br>coh thanks Sabrina I'm a delivery lead<br>and my name is yes the I work for<br>westpack New Zealand I'm a recent<br>graduate as well so what attracted you<br>to our MBA Sabrina that's a very hard<br>question<br>Mike well it's not I'm just joking so<br>first of all MBA is something on my list<br>since in my I guess early 20s so it's<br>something I need to do for my life um<br>second after working for about 10 15<br>years<br>I definitely feel like the continue<br>Improvement and a grow of my mindset is<br>um the key for keep growing of my career<br>and third Oakland University second to<br>now is my choice great thanks for<br>sharing Sabrina how about you yesh<br>thanks Sabrina yeah that's very similar<br>to saina's thoughts as well so as part<br>of my career development the MBA was<br>identified as a key Pace uh for me to<br>progress and move the other second piece<br>was the reputation that or university<br>had you know so it was second to none<br>and that really was a driving forc me to<br>be part of the NBA there cool thanks<br>could you tell us about the top skill<br>you learned in our NBA program and how<br>you've applied it so far yeah sure so<br>the top skill I've learned from the MBA<br>program is resilience so I realize<br>that's a skill I can use both in work<br>and life at work you know it's not just<br>about work sometimes politics uh if you<br>get up to a certain um level of your<br>career in life um you have a different<br>things happening in your life so<br>resilience is something that you need to<br>allow you to bounce back next day like<br>today I'm sitting here talking to your<br>mic literally a lot of things happen to<br>me already in life and work but I need<br>to sit here carry on my life put on a<br>positive attitude so this resilience<br>skill I learned from NBA I think it's<br>very very important thanks for sharing<br>how about yourself yes so what top skill<br>have you learned from our NBA and how<br>have you applied it as you can imagine<br>there's many skills you learn across the<br>NBA but the one that really stands out<br>for me was the entrepreneur<br>uh thinking and the reason why I draw on<br>that so much is because especially in<br>this day and age with so much ambiguity<br>it's how you navigate that but having<br>that constant approach of finding those<br>key resources advocating for them and<br>sort of driving forward you know with a<br>very optimistic view really has helped<br>us you know especially in work as well<br>as within the NBA great so sabrino which<br>part of the NBA Journey surprised you<br>the most I would say it's a support of<br>the NBA team and the teaching itself so<br>this two really surprise me a lot um I<br>work full-time I'm also a mom have a<br>family so initially I start my MBA<br>Journey fulltime after one quarter I<br>feel like it's a bit challenging for me<br>so I reach out to the teaching staff<br>they ultimately adjust my course based<br>on my scenario so I feel very supported<br>from this from this sense um from the<br>teaching facility itself the variety of<br>the course it covered it<br>really defines what is NBA it touches<br>every single point if you want to be a<br>CEO that that's a course you want to do<br>you need to learn I'm not saying that<br>you have to learn um have a NBA<br>qualification to be a CEO but definitely<br>MBA give you the potential of yourself<br>you know you can do it fantastic yeah<br>how about you yesh what was the most<br>surprising thing for your NBA Journey<br>one thing that really caught my<br>attention was uh despite the great<br>material and the thought-provoking<br>material was more around the networks<br>that were formed you know it wasn't just<br>networks from external parties but also<br>within the class uh as well or the<br>cohort so those sort of networks really<br>brought it to life as to really<br>understanding that content that was not<br>just taught in class but how did we<br>applied as well so that was one of the<br>key drivers for me there great Sabrina<br>tell us how you were able to balance<br>your career and other responsibilities<br>along with the NBA Journey right so in<br>my case Mike I feel like my company fish<br>and P appliances um really support me in<br>this sense like every Friday not every<br>Friday sorry every Friday I need to come<br>here for class they gave me um free time<br>just go do your study even it's Friday<br>whole day I still have the flexibility<br>from my um employer which I really<br>appreciate that and the second is the<br>support from my family so I would say<br>it's something I need to balance well in<br>terms of um duties at home and duties at<br>work so from this sense is more about<br>time management I would say after you<br>graduate from MBA you also master of<br>time management yeah great and how about<br>you yes how did you balance everything<br>so like as everyone would know it always<br>starts off with a good plan so the MBA<br>actually started for me almost a year<br>and a half ago when I was looking for<br>the courses and understanding which<br>university to select but also having<br>that family plan I called it which was<br>making family be aware that this is what<br>I'm committing to you know for this<br>period of time and the support and it<br>also applied to my work life as well<br>making sure my employeer was comfortable<br>with my Approach and the way we were<br>doing this and last but not least<br>reaching out to the University of Orland<br>staff and making sure we were support<br>along the way so those three facets<br>really brought it to life for me as well<br>great so tell us Sabrina how did the NBA<br>enhance your career uh right so I start<br>my new job three months ago at a fishion<br>p app lances I wouldn't say it's all<br>through MBA but it's definitely related<br>so that was um beginning of this year we<br>were doing a pro project group project<br>so one of the um students in our group<br>hey work for fish and P appliances and<br>the organization we going to study on is<br>fish and P appliances so one day I was<br>just browsing on their website looking<br>for some information then I got to the<br>career web page I realized oh that<br>sounds like me I applied I G through<br>three interviews and got a job so the<br>student was not involved at all in our<br>group he didn't even know until I almost<br>got my offer I was like Hey blah blah<br>blah uh I've got my offer we're gonna<br>work together so it it is through uh the<br>group project but I would say I probably<br>wouldn't look at fishion P or pl's<br>website because I I wasn't intentionally<br>looking for anything but somehow I bump<br>into this opportunities through our<br>group work then I look into this website<br>so it definitely helped me to change my<br>career change my industry and a step up<br>of what I do fantastic it's it's really<br>helpful congratulations thank you Mike<br>and I guess it's about exposing you to a<br>lot of different things you wouldn't<br>normally be exposed to day to-day<br>exactly those opportunities the doors<br>opened I wouldn't imagine I wouldn't<br>imagine through this course if I didn't<br>not take this course yeah yeah how about<br>you yes um how's the NBA helped with<br>your career so far so um what was really<br>promising was through that ambition and<br>drive I've expressed at work uh my<br>leaders actually saw that and they had a<br>chance through my learnings from the MBA<br>to validate those and give me greater<br>roles and greater responsibilities so<br>what that's meant for me is navigating<br>different roles U but also applying my<br>learning things and it's given me a<br>better exposure to the financial<br>services industry which would then in<br>turn will sort of support you know uh<br>future growth and future learning<br>opportunities for the organization and<br>myself yeah so I guess um being having<br>gone through an MBA you you pick up<br>these things and you just kind of sort<br>of hungry to use them and when you do<br>use them at work it gets you noticed<br>right yeah spot on and one one big<br>caller for me was it's not just applying<br>the tools that you learn or the tricks<br>it's how you apply it you know and how<br>you actually put them or integrate them<br>that actually creates benefit for the<br>organization and your customers in the<br>end yeah great so Sabrina could you tell<br>us what advice you might have for people<br>thinking about doing an MBA okay Mike my<br>advice is don't just think okay do it<br>you're gonna do it um I've heard a lot<br>of people saying to me that yeah I<br>wanted to do an MBA but then there's<br>always a but I mean what is but stands<br>for time commitment money I mean I'm a<br>mother I work fulltime I have family I<br>make my commitment to my MBA give me a<br>reason you can do it and um a bit on top<br>of that I actually did my bridging<br>course before I um start my NBA Journey<br>so it's definitely a commitment of doing<br>that but the thing is you're going to do<br>something in your life right don't let<br>other things hold you back time<br>commitment it's something you you can<br>manage it's like the water in the sponge<br>you keep squeezing you will have a time<br>that's what I did to myself I know it's<br>very harsh different personality maybe<br>but that's what I want I need to achieve<br>that so if you're thinking of doing an<br>MBA don't just think talk to your family<br>get their support talk to your employer<br>get their support then just do it<br>otherwise when you turn 70 you will<br>still thinking oh I wanted to do an MBA<br>just never happened so my advice is<br>believe in yourself just do it don't<br>just think just just do just go go for<br>it that's my advice Mike it's a big ex<br>dream yeah no that's great and and and<br>congratulations on you doing it and so<br>yeah that's fantastic how about you yes<br>what advice do you have for people think<br>about doing an NBA that's a tough one so<br>when I reflected uh or if I were to<br>reflect on it the key Point say no NBA<br>is created equally right so first of all<br>being very clear and concise on where<br>you want to go to and the University of<br>Oakland ticked all the boxes for me so<br>remember what you pay what you pay is<br>what you get that kind of thing but the<br>important aspect is the NBA Journey for<br>me I started off was more for career<br>development but when I step back and<br>look at it really it's been a<br>transformation Journey a very<br>transformative journey I would say and<br>for me that's brought to life you not<br>just alone you have a amazing cohort you<br>have amazing lectures and support that<br>go on for life it's the part of the<br>alumini ey that you form uh so those are<br>sort of the important aspects for me<br>that have come through but you know<br>similar to what um what was mentioned<br>it's take the leap because once you<br>throw yourself in Embrace every<br>opportunity you got and that's the only<br>way you're going to learn and grow great<br>thanks for<br>sharing even if you don't have a degree<br>or a good enough gpe in a previous<br>degree to enter directly there are<br>several options the first is a<br>post-graduate certificate in business<br>this is two courses over two quarters so<br>that's four courses in total as long as<br>you get the gpe at the right level in<br>that PG certificate you can come into<br>the MBA the other option if you don't<br>have a pre-existing bachelor's degree<br>from a recognized Institute is the<br>postgraduate diploma in business this<br>comprises two courses every quarter for<br>four quarters so that's a one-year<br>pathway into the MBA as long as you get<br>the gpe requirements in the postgraduate<br>diploma business once again you'll be<br>MBA in terms of financial support we<br>encourage students to discuss their<br>plans with their employer some employers<br>will provide time off so that a student<br>can attend class and do assignments work<br>in groups projects Etc sometimes an<br>employer will go for partial subsidy so<br>for example a student might pay the<br>first quarter and then the employer<br>might pay the second quarter and so on<br>and so forth and finally some employers<br>are really generous in that they will<br>subsidize the MBA fully for their<br>students we encourage students to talk<br>to their employer and please reach out<br>to us if they would like some advice or<br>tips and tricks on how to have that<br>employer you can study our MBA either<br>full-time time or part-time now we<br>normally encourage students to study<br>full-time first just to get a taste of<br>The Full Experience if it still proves<br>to be too much to juggle work family and<br>options the University of Oakland is<br>excited to launch in 2024 a remote first<br>MBA this means increased accessibility<br>Nationwide better sustainability in<br>terms of time saved fuel saved and money<br>saved by not having to commute into town<br>and finally flexible learning through<br>our remote first MBA this means studying<br>at your own pace in your own time but<br>still maintaining an
