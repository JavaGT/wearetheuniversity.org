at<br>the University of ockland business<br>school I'm associate professor Moren<br>Benson Ray and I'm the associate Dean<br>postgraduate research here at the<br>business school joining me today are<br>some current research students from the<br>business school and my colleague associ<br>Professor Fernando btran Rachel would<br>you like to introduce yourself please<br>thank you my name is Rachel M I'm a<br>economics my name is lar PhD candidate<br>in operations and Supply Chain<br>management and Fernando thank you I am<br>Fernando elran associate professor of<br>Information Technology at the business<br>school here at the business school we<br>have three research oriented<br>postgraduate programs firstly The<br>Bachelor of Commerce honors the bcom<br>honors which is done in two semesters<br>full-time and we offer that in nine<br>specialization subjects secondly the<br>master of Commerce the mcom and you do<br>that in three semesters a full-time or<br>you can Fast Track that in two and a<br>half semesters and we also offer that in<br>nine specialization subjects thirdly we<br>have the do of philosophy the PHD which<br>is normally done in 3 to four years<br>full-time and we offer that in 11<br>subjects all of these are Advanced<br>specialization degrees which build on<br>your earlier degrees the main difference<br>between them in addition to the T<br>courses that you take is the research<br>component so that's a research project a<br>dissertation or the thesis<br>Rachel can you tell us what Drew you to<br>the mcom degree and about your<br>background prior to this thank you so I<br>joined in the university in 2019 I did a<br>conjoint in banor of Global Studies and<br>The Bachelor of Commerce where I majored<br>in international relations and I studied<br>German European studies and for my bcom<br>side I majored in economics uh for my<br>Global Studies re research project uh<br>it's very similar to what I'm doing for<br>my master cus so my current research<br>build on that fantastic thanks Rachel<br>leru what Drew you to the PHD program<br>and what what's your background prior to<br>that I completed my undergraduates in<br>Sri Lanka after completing my undergradu<br>I went on to pursue my master's degree<br>in China after that I wanted to pursue a<br>PhD degree as well and I followed three<br>criteria I would say uh first one was<br>the country then the university and<br>finally the supervisor so New Zealand<br>Oakland University and my main<br>supervisor Professor David Rob and Dr<br>shoi ganguli they all were a perfect fit<br>for me to come to New Zealand for my<br>studies and the main reason for the PHD<br>was that I always wanted to do a<br>contribution in Academia in terms of<br>research and I always preferred to<br>pursue a career in Academia very good<br>thank you that's great so as you can see<br>from these examples our research<br>oriented programs um enable you to build<br>your career Pathways and benefit you in<br>a number of ways first of all they build<br>on your earlier study and take you to an<br>advanced<br>specialization and in that you develop<br>Advanced specialized knowledge in your<br>chosen field you learn career enhancing<br>research skills uh whether for um at<br>practical industry um employment or for<br>further study they prepare you for<br>advanced<br>qualifications as is the case in the PHD<br>they can really broaden your career<br>Pathways um taking you into management U<br>situations<br>Consulting um any business or government<br>roles Nos and into academic careers uh<br>over to you Fernando thank you uh can<br>you briefly describe what your research<br>is about and how it impact our<br>communities Rachel so um I'm studying<br>behavior and experimental nomics with uh<br>professor ananis chel and our research<br>is focus on the luck based and Merit<br>based inequality which is very very<br>important to our society because we know<br>that inequality relates to everyone in<br>the country and in the world and it's<br>not only that income inequality but also<br>relate to like educational side of the<br>society so it it's over just a business<br>content<br>I uh work in the emerging discipline of<br>circular economy uh in particular I'm<br>looking into use product takeback so<br>what do you mean by that we know<br>organizations keep selling products as<br>consumers we buy them and at the end of<br>the day we throw them away to landfill<br>so what I'm working on is how to get<br>organizations to take back those used<br>products in order to recycle them so<br>with the environment in interest many<br>organizations not just in New Zealand<br>globally are engaged in in this used<br>product takeback but it's not easy due<br>to the uncertainty of the returns coming<br>back to them so I'm developing some<br>tools to help uh retailers to use them<br>in order to um make sure that their<br>takeback process is optimized cost<br>effective and sustainable so my research<br>approach is practical whereas I'm<br>working with some of the organizations<br>like one of the major retailers in New<br>Zealand and also one of the global um<br>electronic equipment manufacturer in two<br>of the the projects so what we call<br>practice based research so I'm<br>collaborating with them after<br>identifying two of their problems that<br>are research worthy so I'm trying to<br>solve a problem for them and I'm trying<br>to generalize it as a global solution<br>where any retailer in the world could<br>use and also uh work on my PhD with that<br>that's amazing and what have been the<br>highlights of your degree course so far<br>uh course-wise and academic wise I think<br>we really have a a lot of great work<br>shops in within the faculty as well as<br>at the University as a whole because I<br>attended a few research based workshops<br>and they talk about how to do literature<br>review how to use other resource like<br>the library to find the resource that<br>you need I personally find it very very<br>useful especially for our research<br>students for master students in<br>particular because we just joined the<br>university as a research student and<br>very often we don't quite know how to<br>find a resource so that's why I find<br>this workshops really really use<br>that's great yeah what about you luru um<br>I can mention maybe two of the key<br>highlights U one of them is quite recent<br>where um I actually participated in a<br>research conference in in Paris like so<br>that I could couple up with uh some<br>academic meetings in the Europe region<br>and it was one of the major conferences<br>in my field PS<br>2023 and one of the perks of being in<br>Academia I must say and business school<br>always sponsor us the PhD students and U<br>encourage us to go participate in those<br>uh kind of conferences and the other one<br>is um so when it comes to my uh PhD<br>thesis it's a collection of three papers<br>what we call uh thesis with Publications<br>or with papers so it's not an easy<br>journey to get a a paper published so I<br>was able to get my first paper published<br>it one of the major journals in the<br>field so those are key two key<br>highlights as a PhD student at the<br>business school and apart from that I've<br>been able to participate in some other<br>competitions and case competitions and<br>uh events of that nature uh to uh get<br>some achievements that's great<br>wonderful uh tell us how have you found<br>uh working with your research supervisor<br>uh because I met Professor Anan chery in<br>2021 so I became one of his students in<br>his involved the course that he taught<br>and uh since then he provided many<br>insightful comments and knowledge<br>throughout even my bachelor studies and<br>uh he helped a lot from other research<br>project of mine and so now what I think<br>he um impact me the most is not only the<br>knowledge but also the passionate and<br>the compassion so passionate and the<br>time management skills as well it's very<br>very useful not only for my research<br>project itself but also for my whole<br>study as a whole and how about your<br>experience like yeah it has been<br>wonderful in summary my main I worked<br>the most with my main supervisor<br>Professor David Rob and I was one uh<br>lucky PhD student like I was lucky to be<br>picked up by him at the airport when I<br>arrived in New Zealand and even after<br>that uh he he and I have had a family<br>likee relationship like I've been<br>invited to his place many a time I've<br>got to know uh know his uh entire family<br>but apart from that when it comes to the<br>PHD supervision itself is very um caring<br>d detailed and he guides me all the time<br>to come to my achievements so I and also<br>I meet him every week or the most every<br>two weeks and um he has been a wonderful<br>supervisor and my second supervisor as<br>well very helpful to uh get my my Stones<br>achieved and uh to get my work done and<br>uh most important uh especially I have<br>had some uh down times with the coid<br>lockdowns I think many of my colleagues<br>as PhD students went through that but my<br>super advisers were really helpful like<br>emotionally as well to you know pursue<br>the PHD<br>career so thank you for sharing such<br>wonderful experiences and now let me<br>tell you from the staff perspect<br>perspective from my own perspective what<br>this experience has been about so as a<br>supervisor my work starts way before my<br>students arrive in New Zealand most of<br>the time they are international students<br>uh and engage with them on the email uh<br>just back and forth uh trying to find<br>what is it that makes them thck and uh<br>why they want to work with me and<br>finally after a long process usually<br>when they finally arrive uh we start a<br>series of conversations just like you've<br>been having with your supervisors<br>regular meetings but there's a very<br>special ingredient in all this is that<br>uh when you come from abroad<br>uh I do it as my my my uh mission to<br>actually try to bring the students the<br>student into the our environment not<br>just to deal with the student as one<br>more student but someone who's going to<br>spend with me three four sometimes five<br>years and that is very important in my<br>consideration from that moment the good<br>relation has to be established with<br>clear rules and clear activities and<br>everything like that but at the end of<br>the day is human beings getting to know<br>each other and having common passion for<br>something they are going to work for a<br>long time the university offers plenty<br>of support for our research students<br>especially when it comes to for example<br>research<br>commercialization through things like<br>the University's Center for Innovation<br>and Entrepreneurship and other services<br>so perhaps I can ask the students what<br>other Support Services have you accessed<br>as a research student here at the<br>University um of ockland Rachel first<br>okay so I think uh based on my<br>experience is I really really enjoyed of<br>the academic workshops and also like<br>that within the department of Economics<br>we have regularly scheduled uh<br>presentations we invite not only the<br>students but also some faculty staffs<br>and some uh other profession<br>professionals from outside the<br>university and we we invite them to give<br>presentation to share their experience<br>and to share their studies as well so<br>that's what I really really enjoyed<br>based on my experience so far yeah L<br>what about you yeah well um as a PhD<br>candidate there are many Services of<br>accessed so one of them is the services<br>provided by the library because um we<br>can book an appointment with them<br>whenever we want especially to get uh<br>some guidance towards how to uh look for<br>literature and there are many tools<br>available reference management tools and<br>other software that University have<br>subscribed to all the major software and<br>tools that we can use free of charge as<br>students and the school of Graduate<br>Studies organize a lot of workshops from<br>uh sometimes it may feel like a trivial<br>topic but for example how to work with<br>your supervisor like starting from<br>topics of that nature to more technical<br>topics like how to do a literature<br>review how to get a publication done so<br>I participated in more than 40 workshops<br>so far because I keep a record of all<br>the workshops I've participated in and<br>also uh because I work with the industry<br>I've uh received the help of uniservices<br>to draft some collaboration agreements<br>uh because I'm working on a long on some<br>long-term projects so apart from what I<br>mentioned like you name it there is a<br>support service that any student can get<br>in the University that's fantastic Mah<br>heru so um what advice would you have<br>for people who are thinking of pursuing<br>a a research oriented program or a PhD<br>here at the business school what would<br>your advice be Rachel uh I think<br>personally I have two advice first is<br>really use a good off use of a<br>university website because I think here<br>at University ofland we have a very very<br>detailed designed website that literally<br>contains everything that you need for<br>the program and in in details for the<br>supervisors and potential topics<br>everything that you you can find it on<br>the website so do have a good look at<br>that and the second wise is if you just<br>thinking about doing it maybe just reach<br>out and start early to reach out to your<br>pricers and reach out to your um uh<br>let's say the student wiers to reach out<br>to any stuff and they'll be happy to<br>help very good and lar your advice<br>please yes so I mentioned about my<br>criteria of PhD selection earlier so<br>when it comes to an international<br>student first you need to think about<br>the country country second the<br>university so the country quality of<br>life and things like that uh we don't<br>where there's no doubt when it comes to<br>New Zealand when the then the university<br>university of Oakland number one ranked<br>in New Zealand and globally within the<br>top uh but most important the selection<br>of your supervisor as Fernando mentioned<br>it's a long-term uh relationship like 3<br>to 5 years potentially so how to do that<br>so one of uh the few few things that<br>could be done like one thing is you need<br>to look up uh about the discipline of<br>your supervisor what kind of<br>Publications they have done what are<br>their research interest and whether that<br>discipline fits with what I'm interested<br>in that's one major thing but another<br>key thing is talk to your supervisor's<br>current your potential supervisors<br>current and uh former PhD students to<br>decide whether the supervisor is a type<br>of a person that you can fit with like<br>because personally I may have<br>preferences to uh guide me in a<br>micromanagement level or sometimes some<br>students prefer to be let alone to do<br>your individual work on your own so it's<br>better to uh clarify the expectations at<br>the beginning like especially when you<br>do the initial Communications with your<br>potential supervisor so then after you<br>uh start your PhD Journey uh it would be<br>a wonderful Journey all together once<br>you have Set uh things cleared such good<br>advice thank you all very much indeed<br>for sharing your experiences<br>it's certainly possible to study um in<br>our programs<br>part-time um I would say that it is<br>quite um a Juggle to work fulltime and<br>study full-time there are lots of<br>flexible pathways through our programs<br>and it's really best to get advice from<br>one of our expert advisors to see what's<br>best for you um we fully realize<br>especially in postgraduate programs that<br>you have to balance so many things when<br>you're studying so do get in touch talk<br>to an advisor and see what's best for<br>you but I will emphasize that we have<br>needs here at the University we offer a<br>wide range of scholarships and awards to<br>help support and finance your<br>postgraduate studies we really encourage<br>you to explore our scholarships on the<br>University website and be sure to apply<br>dates so to enroll into our PhD program<br>you don't necessarily need to have a<br>research master's degree you can join<br>the program with a taught master's<br>degree such as an MBA um but we would<br>ask you to do a short bridging program<br>to make sure that you have the research<br>training and the background to be<br>successful in the doctoral program I I'd<br>like to emphasize that we have flexible<br>pathways through the program and the<br>first thing to do is get in touch with<br>us and make inquiries about what pathway<br>is best for you thank you so much for<br>joining us to learn about our research<br>oriented programs and the PHD here at<br>the University of ockland I hope you've<br>gained insight about our programs and<br>their suitability for your interests and<br>career goals to learn more please get in<br>touch with us or visit the University
