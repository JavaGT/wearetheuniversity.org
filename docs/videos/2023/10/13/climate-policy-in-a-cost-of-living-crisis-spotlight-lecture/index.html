Catherine discusses predictions for 2050, particularly around food and water, and outlines the likely dire consequences if we choose business as usual instead of action. Alan discusses some innovative renewable/sustainable energy solutions to help manage the challenges we are facing.</p><h2>Transcript</h2><p style="opacity: 0.9; font-size: 0.8em">Transcripts may be

Victoria<br>University of Wellington that's a series<br>of uh lectures just short lunchtime ones<br>looking at different election policies<br>different topics today's one is on<br>climate um and I can imagine that when<br>this was chosen and sit down no one<br>really imagined what those climate<br>policies were going to be and maybe um<br>or maybe the lack of climate policies I<br>should say that's going to be we've got<br>policies um from some major parties<br>National in particular um saying they're<br>going to overturn the new offshore and<br>oil gas exploration we have act wanting<br>to get rid of the zero carbon act we<br>have Labor and National um wanting to<br>take money more than two billion from<br>the climate emergency fund right after<br>we've pretty much tapped it out for<br>responding to climate<br>emergencies um and so basically<br>everybody is wanting to try and play<br>down or not pay for climate policies uh<br>and so we thought that's an interesting<br>challenge um and what the so we're going<br>to have two people talking about today<br>so I'm irons I'm a law professor here<br>and I teach environmental law Head Court<br>climate change law um I've been looking<br>at um the deadlines that we need to meet<br>in terms of climate policies um for a<br>number of years and so I'll be talking<br>about some of the consequences of<br>business as usual and what we might need<br>to do in terms of climate policies um<br>and then I'm going to pass to Professor<br>Alan Brent from engineering who is going<br>to talk um give us a little bit more<br>hope um about some of the solutions that<br>we have so I'm going to stay back here<br>so partly we are zooming this as well so<br>now I'm in camera so I'm going to try<br>and stay in this one spot and uh and<br>operate Tech we will have um questions<br>afterwards there should be time for<br>questions and um there'll be you know<br>people here to hand microphones around<br>and things like that um so uh yeah keep<br>keep um hold of your questions until<br>we've both had uh sort of 15 to 20<br>minutes each so um the climate<br>voters or lack of climate voters in this<br>election recently it has been reported<br>that and with various um polls done or<br>voters um including asking their<br>political persuasion they said that<br>voters want climate action but they<br>don't want to pay for it right the<br>priority issues for voters in this<br>election are you see in the second um<br>picture there cost of living four times<br>that of climate change and below that<br>Healthcare crime tax cuts education<br>right um this willingness to pay no<br>willingness are you willing to pay even<br>10% more for petrol and electricity in<br>order to solve climate issues nearly 60%<br>no and the numbers um yeah it's always<br>been up high there's always been moreing<br>but even with climate crisis there's<br>made very little or the effects I should<br>say um of climate change that we have<br>been experiencing that isn't changing um<br>very fast so we thought it would be<br>important to look at well what if we<br>don't why are people people are<br>obviously worried about the here and now<br>and I think the here and now has become<br>so important so difficult you're just<br>being blinded to maybe what happens if<br>we don't so so obviously so if we don't<br>if we followed the climate policies of<br>all of the the major parties certainly<br>in the polls basically everyone except<br>the greens and the mai party the greens<br>and the mai party are the only parties<br>at the moment who want to maintain and<br>ramp up our climate obligations and meet<br>Net Zero by 2050 all right they so<br>they're taking what 10 perish of the<br>polls 10 to 15 so we've got basically<br>the majority of Voters not wanting to<br>pay so what if we don't meet Net Zero if<br>we don't reduce our emissions this is<br>how they have risen over the last<br>thousand years they will continue to<br>rise right so on the various different<br>models that climate scientists use to<br>predict what happens everyone's got a<br>different model they've got slightly<br>different predictions but this is the<br>one that's on the worst trajectories the<br>worst scenarios of not reducing<br>emissions which is what the current<br>policies with got so temperatures will<br>go up there's a range of scenarios by<br>for how much they go up but there's<br>certainly they're going to go up and the<br>question is at what time scale they're<br>going to go up so um under the current<br>and I'm calling business as usual that's<br>often used the term um then we're going<br>to be reaching 1.5 degrees as an average<br>by 2040 you might have heard in the news<br>that in June July we reached um some<br>parts of the world reached a 1.5 above<br>pre-industrial but that's not on the<br>averaging that they use to say we have<br>reached it as a globe right and over<br>over the a rolling average so we will do<br>that by 2040 for sure and and that's<br>even under low greenhouse gas scenarios<br>but if we will we will go above 1.5 by<br>2040 possibly two degrees under the high<br>emissions which is the ones we're<br>looking at so that's the issue when<br>people talk about what are these overall<br>predictions they're often averaging out<br>between low and high emission scenarios<br>so you have to go well if we we're<br>choosing policies that have high<br>emission scenarios let's look at the<br>model for that one um they're suggesting<br>with no decrease we'll see um doubling<br>CO2 emissions by 2050 and then doubling<br>Again by 2100 so that's three from 3 to<br>10 degrees Celsius hotter than<br>pre-industrial there will so I have to<br>move this there will be no ice at the<br>poles again all right we've got sea<br>levels Rising 66 m above current that<br>takes in most of civilization around<br>coasts around the whole world right now<br>that's not going to happen by 2100 it's<br>a slow melt for most of that and a slow<br>expansion but it will happen so it's in<br>then it is just a matter of the speed um<br>sorry so this is the zoom sorry I'm<br>being a bit useless moving this around<br>what's one of the effects of heat okay<br>just something that affects a lot of<br>people is uh food right pests we're<br>going to have less crops with food and<br>of course what I reason one of the<br>reasons I put this up here in New<br>Zealand what that means is everyone's<br>going to want to use a lot more<br>chemicals sry we have difficulty and<br>they're going to want to use stronger<br>and worse chemicals um and so we're<br>going to get drought that's going to<br>affect wheat it's going to affect all<br>the crops but one that people focus on a<br>lot is wheat because it's a staple of<br>the world food supply the world economy<br>um and so if up to 30% of global<br>production could seee simultaneous<br>drought between 2040 and 2070 that's<br>going to I'm not going to say collapse<br>the world food supply but it's going to<br>severely impact it um so we we've got<br>summaries with all of these eminent<br>scientific bodies commenting on<br>simultaneous crop failures the price of<br>food food shocks and Nutri and<br>malnutrition with developing tropical<br>countries likely to be hardest hit and<br>destabilizing financial effects around<br>the globe Charming right um that was<br>just temperature of course they do<br>interact with other matters such as<br>water water shortages again just a<br>headline here um could affect five<br>billion people by 2050 why do I choose<br>the 2050 number so often because it's a<br>little bit closer than 2100 a little bit<br>closer to home right within a lot of<br>people's<br>lifetimes um especially a lot of the<br>voters lifetimes even if not it's in<br>with the political cycle that five<br>billion that's an awful lot of people to<br>be affected by water shortages right um<br>and it's not just out in rural or<br>agricultural areas it's in it's in<br>cities um they've got suggestions like<br>this that a lot of the Cities will have<br>climate like London having a climate<br>similar to Barcelona lot Barcelona a lot<br>of London um people might quite like<br>that idea until they look at what goes<br>along with that right rainfall will be a<br>particular problem uh water shortages<br>protected to affect scores of cities<br>that are now in temporate climes is what<br>that one says um so outside the cities<br>but maybe also possibly in them the<br>Earth will start becoming a desert by<br>2050 is one of the quotes from one of<br>these scientific<br>summaries um half of all arable land<br>will be affected by salinization by 2050<br>right again remember these are the<br>businesses usual models the ones that<br>don't have climate emissions dropping<br>severely so it's only business as usual<br>um but if you take into account<br>population growth a quarter there will<br>only be a one quarter of the arable land<br>per person compared with 1960 levels<br>that we had today with the decline and<br>what's available and then the growth of<br>people so that that can affect um food<br>supply and security<br>generally so it's not the only thing<br>that gets affected obviously<br>biodiversity I'm not going to go into<br>all the predictions but of course there<br>have been those predictions right um and<br>this is the March 2023 or sort of 2022<br>and 2023 ipcc reports and they've<br>modeled species losses on the different<br>scenarios at different temperature<br>levels you will get different effects<br>right so at 1.5 at two at three at four<br>there'll be wider ranges um and wider<br>areas of not and much larger numbers of<br>species affected around the globe uh so<br>um we don't have time to go into all of<br>those but they will have not impacts not<br>just on species themselves with lots of<br>extinctions but also the ones that um<br>contribute massively to our current ways<br>of life um and of course I move that so<br>so just think of pollinators right and<br>so they're affected by what heat flood<br>droughts um in New Zealand<br>wind right they get blown away when the<br>when those um the strong nor westers or<br>nor easers come in so that can have a<br>major impact on uh what we take for<br>granted in terms of food both just<br>supply for our eles and then exported<br>trade um oceans another big they're a<br>huge carbon sink um and they will become<br>massively affected they're already being<br>affected and they're going to become<br>even more so and of course we have the<br>formal study looking at all of the<br>possible effects um here's one of the<br>charts from the ipcc in 2019 that you<br>can see it goes all the way from warm<br>water corals up to the Abyssal Plains<br>which are really deep and they'll be<br>affected at much higher temperatures<br>only much higher temperatures but you<br>know corals will be affected down sort<br>of one to two degrees right um so again<br>I'm not going to go into all of those<br>but you see these have been studied and<br>mapped we're not ignorant of them um but<br>what some takeaways of this just in the<br>simple language while warming May<br>disrupt 80% of the world's oceans by<br>2050 and fish will migrate right so that<br>means the fish we currently fish now in<br>those areas we fish will migrate um<br>ocean acidity we're going to have a pH<br>of 2050 um I don't know if I need to go<br>into the science but it's one of those<br>side effects of absorbing carbon dioxide<br>it makes the ocean more acidic um and<br>what's one of those just one example of<br>an effect is coral Rifts so you've got<br>the temperature and the acidification<br>the temperature might bleach them make<br>them die the acidification means they<br>can't regrow or softens them up so they<br>will decline by 70 to 90% with only 1.5<br>degrees we where that's locked in We<br>Can't Stop that so and virtually all of<br>them more than 99% will be gone within<br>two degrees and that's um some people<br>are saying that's that's almost locked<br>in it's very close certainly if we don't<br>decrease emissions it's going to be<br>locked in if we don't do our Net Zero so<br>oh what's this one um is this one sea<br>level rise move the move the zoom thing<br>sorry um so uh we've already had the<br>number of 66 meters that's over with all<br>of the worst scenarios over a few<br>hundred years<br>um but even from 2020 to 2040 this gives<br>estimates of the numbers of people that<br>will be affected around the globe by um<br>sea level rise so it's not as many down<br>in austral Asia but 52% interestingly<br>52% um I'm not quite sure oh no yeah<br>okay I'm not quite sure what that um I<br>can't remember what that's of I'm sorry<br>but anyway we've got most of it's not<br>around aloa but um it's going to be<br>causing Mass migration climate refugees<br>around the world so what we know this<br>was in 2014 um just from the a American<br>Association of the advancement of<br>science um uh climate change will have<br>significant geopolitical impacts around<br>the world contributing to Poverty<br>environmental degradation and the<br>further weakening of fragile governments<br>some of those fragile governments<br>subject to droughts and floods have<br>nuclear weapons um climate change will<br>contribute to food and water scarcity<br>and will increase the spread of disease<br>and may spur or exacerbate Mass<br>migration well that's just the summary<br>we have known that for more than 10<br>years um generally uh but um it is it is<br>people are looking at it more closely<br>now they weren't really looking at that<br>kind of possibility so closely back in<br>2014 it was just on the horizon now<br>people are looking what if we got 3<br>degrees by 2050 and there are modeled<br>scenarios that show that happening and<br>again those scenarios that involve<br>unabated emissions<br>right and tipping points because we<br>don't know where they are these are the<br>scenarios that will result from climate<br>policies that don't reduce them they<br>don't get to Net Zero by 2050 so this<br>lovely one human civilization could end<br>by 2050 due to the destabilizing<br>societal and environmental factors<br>caused by a rapidly warming Planet what<br>does that mean it doesn't mean people<br>will disappear they W it's just we won't<br>act in a civilized way towards one<br>another when we want water clean air<br>water and food and land to live on right<br>so it's is the Civilized aspect that's<br>going to end um so uh un Secretary<br>General Antonio Gutierrez summed it up<br>our action our world needs climate<br>action on all fronts everything<br>everywhere all at once and no matter<br>what it costs now there really what um<br>just on Wednesday this week uh he sumed<br>it up a little bit more<br>dramatically Humanity has opened the<br>gates To Hell by letting climate crisis<br>Orsen and that was the climate ambition<br>Summit and he's basically yes attacking<br>countries that aren't doing anything as<br>well as the fossil fuel industry so um<br>quite drastic and so or maybe I should<br>have I should have said so our climate<br>policies that we've got basically the<br>ones on offer all except for the greens<br>and the M party at the moment um are<br>part of this opening the gates to help<br>depressing um Solutions so yeah there's<br>the Doom Gloom it's what happens if you<br>do business as usual you open the gates<br>to heal so we can't do business as usual<br>what do we need to do we've got<br>Solutions um Alan Brent's going to talk<br>about most of them um so one that has<br>been looked at for a while um and this<br>is this is Yan rockstrom and his crowd's<br>solution having emissions every decade<br>that is achievable if we choose the<br>right policies that's doable engineering<br>wise um and you could say projectwise<br>it's just needs the political will to do<br>it uh the ipcc um slightly different but<br>it's very similar they've got one by<br>some numbers by 2040 but very similar um<br>that will cost Net Zero by 2050 that<br>will cost 50 trillion it says but the<br>costs in there are worse for not doing<br>it um but unfortunately voter support<br>for Net Zero by 2050 um has a very low<br>cost right we only have report for Net<br>Zero by 2050 um up until it adds only<br>for National voters $3 on a price of on<br>a 60 L tank labor $6 um act and New<br>Zealand first zero they are not willing<br>to pay anything to reach Net Zero but<br>not anything personally they want it<br>done by someone else but not the<br>government either because they shouldn't<br>be funded you can't trust them with the<br>money either so it has to be someone<br>else not the government not ourselves<br>but maybe what big business green voters<br>are the only ones at the moment who will<br>pay they haven't got MTI party on here<br>but you know maybe there weren't many in<br>that poll um so what kinds of policies<br>are people happy with um<br>insulation insulating homes and that's<br>not actually going to get us there but<br>um we don't like maybe reducing the<br>number of flights um not if it increases<br>the cost of flying by<br>20% definitely don't not people are less<br>happy with Banning Natural Gas<br>Appliances even though significant<br>greenhouse gas emissions from them and<br>we could do it with electricity um<br>problems with livestock limits problems<br>with Banning the sale of petrol cars<br>even though we need it and even worse<br>particularly for a large number of older<br>voters if you want to try and limit<br>their meat intake um which again they're<br>very animal um agriculture is uh has got<br>a lot of greenhouse gas emissions so um<br>that really leaves it open to what big<br>energy big trans support um and isn't it<br>lucky that we have at the moment um we<br>have Alan Brent who is a professor of<br>sustainable energy and we're going to<br>now hand this presentation over to him<br>good afternoon<br>everybody as says I head up the<br>sustainable energy systems group up to<br>Hill Wellington faculty of of<br>engineering uh so let's just revisit uh<br>what we basically all know I guess<br>um these next next couple of slides come<br>out of our F change<br>commission um they're a little bit<br>outdated but they sort of paint a<br>picture of of where we are and where we<br>need to focus our attention so this is a<br>snapshot of our carbon emissions<br>currently in the economy around 80<br>million tons of uh carbon dioxide<br>equivalents that that we release into to<br>the atmosphere every year and we know<br>agriculture is our our main concern so I<br>won't go into that debate what we need<br>to do there uh we know transportation is<br>a big issue for us be 20% and there Pro<br>seed all right so that's those are the<br>two main items that's that's keeping the<br>energy sector awake I guess uh is what<br>do we do with a part of the because<br>energy we we think about be pretty green<br>yes renewable electricity is about 85%<br>Renewables in in uh in the country but<br>really it's about 20% of our delivered<br>energy is actually renewable so we we<br>need to think about<br>Alternatives and it's this hard to aate<br>sectors that we need to address again<br>through the slide out of the uh out of<br>this document but our data transport is<br>not looking that bad we know have EVS<br>now driving on the road but we still<br>don't have effective solutions for very<br>heavy transport we haven't done much<br>about moving over to rail as an example<br>we know all the people sticking<br>themselves onto the roads here in<br>Wellington at the<br>moment government has had an<br>intervention on our steel industry that<br>was good but yeah there's a lot of other<br>process uh heat that we still need to<br>address in the economy so that's that's<br>acep of where we<br>are and I think what is also important<br>is that that we need to understand what<br>whatever we do here we're doing that in<br>in a global<br>context and we need to<br>rethink uh about growth all right so I<br>like putting this slide slide up because<br>this study was done in the year that I<br>was born right so it's it's now over<br>five decades that we've known<br>this we can't have indefinite economic<br>growth so having policies and<br>interventions that just thinks about<br>economic<br>growth it's not possible Right it speaks<br>to to what Katherine was just saying if<br>we keep focusing on economic growth in<br>the way we're doing it in in the in the<br>sectors well we're going to get to the<br>2050 Doom and Gloom end of civilization<br>right around about this time in the<br>beginning of the 70s there was also this<br>the two concepts of green growth versus<br>degrowth all right so green growth this<br>is from the United Nations environment<br>program basically says okay well they<br>still talk about economic growth there<br>but more emphasis on human well-being<br>and we need have this relative<br>decoupling so we want to use less<br>resources in what we do in the economy<br>and ultimately what we want absolute<br>decoupling we want to reduce the<br>environmental impact of what we do in in<br>the<br>economy uh I don't know if you some of<br>you participated in that debate a few<br>weeks ago up to Hill on green growth<br>versus degrowth<br>uh while the proponents of degrowth say<br>those green growth interventions aren't<br>going to do it enough we need to reduce<br>growth all right so we get to a more<br>stable economy that's within the<br>carrying capacity of our ecosystems but<br>provides decent living standards for<br>everyone right so we need to think about<br>interventions that bring us<br>there so we might have some economic<br>activity but it needs to be more stable<br>so what deth basically says is you<br>maintain a<br>decent standard of<br>living with reduced throughput in the<br>economy so we need to think about how<br>how can we may maybe achieve that I say<br>it's and right so it's not one or the<br>other I don't get into those debates<br>from social media and so on we need a<br>bit of both but what does that mean for<br>for the economy and we're already<br>starting to see it right so some some<br>Industries are Sunset Industries they're<br>shrinking and we see some Industries<br>grow and some of our Industries are<br>transforming think about Transportation<br>different modes of transportation as I<br>said before think about our energy<br>sector we are well except that some of<br>our parties are trying to bring back in<br>the the gas and so on<br>but we at the moment in in in the world<br>it's cheaper to go and build a solar<br>farm or a wind farm than it is to and<br>put in in a fossil fuels a simil plant<br>as an example all right so we need to<br>think about what what are the<br>opportunities of this transformation<br>that we're going to see<br>and what does it do for cost of living<br>perhaps we need to ask the question<br>because obviously as cther said that's<br>what's important for the voters so this<br>is uh how the energy sector tends to<br>think about it well some of it is what<br>how they're thinking about it some that<br>I've<br>added uh six years ago when I joined<br>here the energy sector was only talking<br>about the first<br>3DS okay so we we know we need to<br>decarbonize uh but we need to think<br>about<br>decentralization right so we don't want<br>big Power<br>stations sitting in central places and<br>then moving electrons around in the<br>economy necessarily digitalization all<br>right we have more more smart grids and<br>we we'll talk about<br>examples uh of<br>how um how we can utilize that Tech<br>better for the benefit of of of the<br>people we need to think about disruption<br>disruption is comes from exogenously so<br>in a globe there's new technology coming<br>that comes about how are we prepared to<br>absorb that technology or do we have<br>some<br>policies that create disruption<br>and what might those<br>be uh there's diversity because we we<br>thinking about diversity in in in the<br>population and and how energy is used<br>and the Democracy I've added right<br>because we need to think about equity in<br>in the country it's a just transition<br>right so whatever interventions we do uh<br>needs we can't leave any people behind<br>right so these are the sort of 6ds that<br>we sort of keep in in our head as<br>well uh the the energy world energy<br>Council has this energy trilemma uh<br>scoring looking at energy security<br>Equity as I said and environmental<br>sustainability now if you compare all<br>the countries in the<br>world New Zealand is sitting at number<br>eight so we actually pretty pretty good<br>but the devil's in the details right so<br>yes we are still dependent on importing<br>well we don't even have Mar Point<br>producing fuel we're just importing fuel<br>now directly right so and we still<br>heavily riant on<br>that uh we are moving towards<br>diversification of the electricity<br>generation we don't have storage so last<br>slide I'll end off I won't get into that<br>debate that's an hour debate about what<br>do we do for the dry here uh<br>problem uh but yeah so that storage is<br>is being addressed to some extent but um<br>it's it's it's still a problem for us<br>energy Equity that looks pretty good<br>because those those barographs are to to<br>the right so Sy access to electricity<br>but the<br>prices as Katherine said has increased<br>all right and what a lot of people in<br>New Zealand somehow doesn't don't want<br>to realize is that we have uh energy<br>hardship all right we talk about energy<br>cost<br>share we're fortunate that we are one of<br>those countries where a very small<br>percentage of the G of the GDP is<br>actually or out of the pocket of the<br>people is actually going towards energy<br>compared to other parts of the world but<br>increase uh which means you know do you<br>have enough money for for food<br>Etc<br>uh environmental<br>sustainability all I want to say about<br>that is you can't think about energy in<br>isolation because energy it's what they<br>call we call the food energy water Nexus<br>right because they also interact with<br>one another<br>uh so even though it looks sort of Rosy<br>there are a lot of aspects that that we<br>need to address going forward and this<br>is from from trans power from the tomoru<br>hiu report saying okay yes on the left<br>hand side we need to reduce those those<br>carbon<br>emissions<br>uh en to do that uh we're going to have<br>transformation but we're also going to<br>have population growth we're also going<br>to have they still think about economic<br>growth right so they don't see that<br>coing as we said earlier on so for that<br>we're going to need a hell of a lot more<br>electricity all right we're going to<br>need two to three times what we<br>currently have in the economy and by the<br>way the small dip there is just aluminum<br>smelter on the right hand side there and<br>that's not going away either<br>so we're going to need a lot more<br>electricity and for some of the<br>interventions that we need to<br>address uh some of those<br>hardbat sectors that I talked about<br>earlier on well we have movements we<br>have movements as an example in the<br>hydrogen space sticky Point much debated<br>on on social<br>media uh lot of hype okay because uh our<br>fossil fuel industry sees High hydrogen<br>as a great<br>side iting to for them to move into<br>right uh and this was just a a report<br>that was released earlier<br>this month I'm sure you must have seen<br>it in the media we have this new new<br>hydrogen Aviation Consortium thinking<br>about Aviation so as Captain showed<br>there people don't really want to fly<br>less uh the next barograph down was well<br>we don't want to pay more right so what<br>are our alternatives for Aviation<br>because Aviation is so important for for<br>for us in the economy uh we're reliant<br>on on International tourism and all the<br>rest of it but you all you're either put<br>in batteries or you go hydrogen or you<br>go sustainable Aviation fields and this<br>is what the schematic is showing over<br>here so this is what's sort of suggested<br>around what we call these green hydrogen<br>ecosystems uh and what I like about this<br>schematic it speaks to a concept that we<br>call industrial<br>symbiosis all right so you you don't go<br>and build a cement factory over there<br>and then you go and build a Refinery<br>over there you put the to one another<br>and you can actually exchange energy and<br>materials and so on between them so we<br>need to think think about these<br>industrial<br>ecosystems and we need to think<br>multiple energy well hydrogen energy<br>Vector but multiple uses so it's not<br>only about Aviation this<br>is um and the Christ Church aort is<br>involved in this as well uh it's<br>about as as the figure shows there<br>Logistics all right so you have fuel for<br>for for our very heavy Vehicles we can<br>have hydrogen as a storage option so<br>that's why the Enz battery project is<br>looking at at hydrogen for because you<br>can generate electricity out of that uh<br>as a bottom there speaks to the<br>industrial sosis again so we can have<br>biomass uh we can capture that<br>carbon electrically break that down to<br>carbon monoxide we have green hydrogen<br>and carbon monoxide that's what we call<br>a sin gas and from there you have a sin<br>gas refinary making any other chemical<br>products and so that you need in the<br>economy but it's not the silver buil of<br>hydrogen all right because the problem<br>with hydrogen is actually quite<br>inefficient depending on how you use it<br>at theend end you need a lot of<br>electricity uh and depend again<br>depending on how you're using it can be<br>as low as 20 % of the energy that you're<br>actually putting in on the one hand is<br>actually used in the economy right<br>so we need to think carefully around<br>building massive generation capacity to<br>to to to do<br>hydrogen speaking a little bit towards<br>decentralization side of things so we<br>need to empower<br>communities we need to empower<br>communities to produce their own<br>energy and<br>create their own little markets we call<br>it micro markets it's micro grid because<br>we have electrons moving around but it's<br>it's little micro markets all right we<br>have peer-to-peer<br>trading right I can sell electricity to<br>you and you sell electricity to me right<br>we don't even need a retailer in in that<br>in that system and we can utilize<br>multiple renewable energy resources we<br>can think about different vectors so<br>schematic in the middle is a study we<br>did for Stewart Island as an example uh<br>where we also thought about a FY power<br>that with hydrogen you can produce that<br>in my microgrid you can think about<br>organic waste materials Etc there's<br>multiple sources that you can<br>integrate<br>and what we saw now with with the<br>Cyclones going through again if people<br>can can generate their own energy manage<br>it themselves take responsibility for it<br>uh yeah they just become more<br>resilient and is more than micro it's<br>also about<br>nanog okay so it's about how you manage<br>buildings how do you manage your own<br>household these Technologies are now<br>available right we we have ai and<br>machine learning and all that sort of<br>stuff happening up up the hill that's<br>designing optimizing these systems and<br>operating these these kind of<br>systems and a good example is is the<br>Brooklyn is always used as as a global<br>example so it's not only about micr gits<br>for remote communities which usually<br>with micr GDs we start thinking about<br>Islands or we start thinking about<br>communities in rural areas it's micr<br>grids within<br>cities usually with with own generation<br>we talk about behind a meter but it's<br>behind a Transformer it's behind the<br>substation again we can have whole<br>suburbs that can start operating on on<br>on their own and linked to that is what<br>we now call virtual power uh plants all<br>right so if if you think about in New<br>Zealand I might have my figure figure<br>wrong 6 to 8,000 households with PB<br>panels and<br>batteries that's megawatts of a virtual<br>power plant all right they can<br>participate in the market and this is<br>what's what what Brooklyn is doing is<br>bringing different actors and<br>stakeholders into into play they use<br>blockchain technology to for for this<br>trading that happens uh Etc so all these<br>opport unities uh and Technologies are<br>there moving back to all right so we are<br>going to need some<br>centralized um generation okay because<br>we<br>can't well we might have not we might<br>not have the space to to to do things<br>maybe if you think about VI uni we sort<br>of limited in terms of what we can do by<br>ourselves and this was the generation<br>investment survey the concept Consulting<br>did for the electricity Authority last<br>year and it's happening all right about<br>80% of all committed and actively<br>pursued projects and I'm talking about<br>electricity generation 80% of those are<br>S<br>Farms all right in the order of meeting<br>our current generating capacity what we<br>currently Genera capacity that we have<br>in the country we're going to be doing<br>that with solar Farms within the next 5<br>to 10 years<br>all right and then we have offshore wind<br>and all of these also coming in into the<br>play but we need to be more smart how we<br>do this okay specifically around S Farms<br>as an<br>example we're not in Australia where we<br>have the big Outback and a lot of space<br>and fantastic Sol Sola<br>resource we are limited in terms of our<br>our land and we don't we globally this<br>is not a New Zealand thing only it<br>started off in Japan and Germany France<br>now in in the United States and some of<br>the countries in in Latin America as<br>well thinking about land<br>competition right we don't want<br>to uh give up our productive<br>agricultural land all right so we need<br>to think about dual uh land usage as an<br>option with our S Farms so we need<br>policy intervention to make sure the<br>industry does things<br>right okay so and this is this<br>technology is what people called Agri<br>Vol Tes so it's not only about livestock<br>I know you know sheep and beef and dairy<br>is is big for our country but there's<br>also other opportunities to the couple<br>of pictures on the left is Jack solar<br>garden in Colorado it's a 2<br>megawatt uh generating plants there and<br>you can see they're doing all kinds of<br>crops because some crops actually like<br>to be a little bit in the shade right so<br>we we just need to be more smart around<br>again this is integ<br>food energy it's about water retention<br>in the soil it's about protecting the<br>the crop in adverse uh weather<br>situations so having a bit more<br>realistic thinking about our land and<br>how to use it and our water systems and<br>again it sort of brings me back<br>to uh the microgrid uh integrating that<br>with the microG concept we making<br>Farmers more resilient all right so we<br>already have the Cherry Farm there SAS<br>Island where they brought in all the<br>electric<br>tractors uh there's hydrogen equipment<br>that's available now on the market as<br>well so we'll see this transition in in<br>in a farming community<br>and yeah we need we need to make it<br>possible for them one of the issues<br>around Agri voltaics as an example is<br>there's a limitation about how much the<br>farmers can actually participate in the<br>wholesale Market because our<br>infrastructure<br>at our distribution system level is<br>inadequate to deal with this massive<br>decentralization uh and and<br>generation and finally Storage Solutions<br>all right so as I said when we talked<br>about the trma we have a lack of storage<br>currently in in the system we know about<br>the dry years we know about leg Onslow<br>and a big debate around that and there's<br>a big 15 billion plus plus stack on that<br>and government obviously I saw the NZ<br>battery project send out an email this<br>morning so looking at an alternative<br>option of multiple Technologies although<br>there's more uncertainty with those but<br>the point with with with storage is this<br>is something that we are really not<br>capitalizing on in our country all right<br>and on the right so it's not only about<br>big storage we need that in order of<br>five terawatt hours to deal with the dry<br>years but again you can do it with the<br>decentralization so the where we on the<br>right hand side uh yeah that's a that's<br>one typical day uh of my<br>house right so I have a PV panels and<br>and a battery in there and what you what<br>we see there is the green line is how<br>much my battery is stored the blue is<br>what how much the PV is generating all<br>the day but the key thing that you see<br>there is my house isn't using anything<br>from Grid in the morning and evening<br>Peaks uh so if we if we start thinking<br>about policy intervention to make it<br>more possible for people to get into<br>this Market because it's quite expensive<br>and there's business models out there<br>and people supplying make them more<br>possible but yeah we need interventions<br>at the smaller scale and to to the larg<br>scale and and the technology is<br>there those are just a few what I could<br>do in 15 or 20 minutes uh there's a lot<br>more happening in the energy space it's<br>a really<br>Dynamic I'm more hopeful I'm a techn<br>optimist<br>so the technology is there we just<br>need H the willingness of our political<br>parties of IND industrialists they don't<br>like this whole degrow thing they like<br>the green things so we just need to<br>Collective effort and you can make it<br>that</p></main><footer style="margin-top: 2rem; background: #0001; padding: 2rem;
