interest and<br>options for change Max and I are going<br>to do a bit of a tag team today so in<br>fact Max is going to start so I'm going<br>to hand over to him now um and then we<br>will jump in and out over the next um<br>half hour or so and aim to finish within<br>maybe about 30 minutes so we have lots<br>of time to have a good corero at the end<br>K<br>Max well Koto um and hello to everyone<br>who's following this over Zoom as well<br>as um in the room itself and what Lisa<br>and I are going to be talking about is<br>based on re research uh that we did last<br>year um research funded through the<br>gamma endowment fund into political<br>party funding uh in Aro New Zealand uh<br>which we both did through our sort of<br>respective roles in the school of<br>and so that that work that we did last<br>year um produced a report called money<br>for something political party funding in<br>alur New Zealand<br>um and it involved us looking at<br>political donations through a couple of<br>means uh one was that we went out and<br>interviewed quite a few players within<br>the system um in order to understand how<br>the system of funding political parties<br>Works in New Zealand and what concerns<br>people within that system have about it<br>so we interviewed some major donors um<br>to political parties and we'll talk a<br>bit more about that in a moment we<br>interviewed Past and Present part<br>presidents and general secretaries MPS<br>uh one former prime minister uh several<br>fundraisers and political party leaders<br>as well and then on top of that uh we<br>ran a survey uh to get a sense of what<br>the wide New Zealand Public thinks about<br>the issue and a couple of focus<br>groups<br>and our interest in all of this um stems<br>from some concerns that I measure will<br>be pretty familiar people in the room uh<br>largely this is all part of the things I<br>guess you might call trading and<br>influence uh the various mechanisms like<br>political party donations but also<br>lobbying and political<br>appointments that uh people use to<br>further their own interests potentially<br>uh at the expense of the public good<br>however that's defined so people using<br>these mechanisms to potentially purchase<br>access and influence that isn't<br>available to the rest of us<br>and within that um there's you know a<br>couple of uh specific concerns um one<br>can be the is the individual access and<br>influence um that people can gain that<br>may come at the expense of others uh but<br>political donations also raise pretty<br>well-worn concerns about fundraising<br>imbalances so if one political party or<br>one side of politics uh can raise vastly<br>more funds<br>uh than others then the political<br>competition may not be held on a Level<br>Playing Field one side may have much<br>better chance of getting its message out<br>and winning votes than the<br>other um but that of course depends bit<br>on sort of the sums of money involved on<br>which point I'll hand over to<br>Lisa thank you Max so of course you know<br>we do want our political parties to be<br>well funded we want them to be able to<br>develop good policy and then communicate<br>that policy you know to anybody who is<br>interested uh and that is why in<br>particular we're we're really interested<br>in in these imbalances so the next<br>couple of slides I'm going to show you<br>uh are showing you where the large<br>donations have gone over the past two or<br>three years before I show you the first<br>uh graph just want to uh clarify that<br>the rules did change around uh<br>disclosure of large donations towards<br>the end of last year so up until the end<br>of last year donations over 30,000 had<br>to be disclosed within 10 days of them<br>being U provided that reduced to 20,000<br>at the start of this year so there is a<br>slight difference with uh the rules<br>around what is disclosed the figure that<br>I'm about to show you and I will show<br>you now uh just has the large donations<br>so these are the ones that are over<br>20,000 for this year over 30 ,000 for<br>last year and the idea here is that the<br>the numbers are specifically just for<br>what you will see for<br>2023 now it is an election year that<br>will not have escaped anybody in this<br>room uh so you do see more money going<br>into political parties in election year<br>however of course there was a very wellp<br>publicized fundraising campaign uh last<br>year for the national party that was<br>very visible and you can see that in the<br>figures that are here so 2022 which is<br>the the gray uh um Gray colored column<br>there uh National did very well last<br>year with their fundraising as well with<br>that deliberate um uh and visible<br>attempt that they had there but the<br>pattern that you see across the other<br>parties tends to be a wee bit more<br>traditional so lower amounts in<br>non-election years and then the larger<br>amounts coming in and election years so<br>uh just Also to clarify the reason why<br>we V only got the five main parties here<br>not five main parties but five parties<br>is because these are the ones that tend<br>to usually get the most amount of<br>funding so of course there are smaller<br>amounts going to the other parties but<br>this is where that the larger sums are<br>going the next uh figure that I'm going<br>to show you is just to show you the<br>imbalance that that Max referred to so<br>uh a little bit of color coding on this<br>P graph so looking at those numbers for<br>2022 and 2023 and again this is just the<br>large donations we're focused in on the<br>large donations because those are the<br>ones that are likely to perhaps you get<br>people the access that we heard about<br>when we were doing our interviews and so<br>on so you can see here over last year<br>and this year up until Wednesday last<br>week is when this count stops National<br>have got uh 47% so nearly half of those<br>large donations and active got 29% so<br>with those two parties on the right over<br>34s of the large donations are are going<br>there uh and then with the labor gr New<br>Zealand first they're getting 8% each so<br>we do have quite uh quite an imbalance<br>with their with where that money is um<br>is going now I'm going to hand you back<br>to Max now who's going to talk to you<br>about some of the key themes that came<br>out um particularly from the interviews<br>that that we did so<br>max yeah thanks Lisa and also just um<br>briefly on sort of the donations amount<br>um I mean even if you sort of zoom out<br>it's probably withth saying Beyond just<br>those very large donations and you look<br>at sort of the totals of all the<br>donations that are<br>reported uh you still see a very large<br>fundraising IM balance um since the 2020<br>election uh National enact have raise<br>something in the order of $13 million<br>across all the donations that we<br>currently know about uh and labor in the<br>greens probably in the order of<br>something more like $2<br>million uh that doesn't include um<br>donations of under $1,500 which don't<br>have to be disclosed except for the<br>anonymous ones and it's possible that<br>labor and greens fundraising of those<br>smaller amounts uh restores the balance<br>to some extent but no one we spoke to in<br>our research thought it made a huge<br>difference um in the greater scheme of<br>things so various kinds of imbalances<br>there um<br>so yes so one of the the big parts of<br>This research um is that we went um and<br>interviewed a number of people in the<br>system as I said at the outset and that<br>was motivated partly by of course a long<br>history uh of scandals and concerning<br>incidents surrounding political<br>donations in New Zealand uh which<br>includes uh donors to both major<br>political parties having citizenship<br>approved against the advice of officials<br>um in one instance a minister interfer<br>ing in a police investigation into a<br>donor um multiple instances of you know<br>donations being concealed or not<br>properly disclosed and a couple of<br>really big high-profile court cases uh<br>recently involving New Zealand First<br>National and labor all of which revealed<br>either um you know C well basically in<br>my view clear instances of the rules<br>being broken by what were in effect<br>donations being hit<br>uh from the public through various<br>mechanisms so we went and we spoke to<br>people um in the<br>system about what they thought about how<br>the system for funding political parties<br>works and they were unsurprisingly the<br>view that political parties do need to<br>be adequately funded they're an<br>important part of the political system<br>they have to be able to go out there<br>engage in the contest of ideas uh at<br>least in theory get their message out to<br>voters and all the rest of it um but<br>everyone we spoke to was agreed that<br>transparency of funding at least um was<br>essential however we also heard a lot of<br>concern from people within the system<br>that there were too many opportunities<br>to circumvent the existing rules um one<br>former political party fundraiser called<br>it an accident waiting to happen um<br>there was a very strong sense that with<br>the rules being relatively complex and<br>they're being opportunities to hide<br>donations for instance by splitting them<br>into smaller amounts so that they're<br>below the threshold where the donor's<br>identity has to be<br>disclosed uh and with the Electoral<br>commission having relatively weak powers<br>to look into any of this uh to the<br>extent that the system did function well<br>uh what we were told was that very much<br>relied on sort of the personal Integrity<br>of people in the system uh and if there<br>were people operating in it who didn't<br>have particularly high levels of<br>Integrity then there were V many<br>opportunities uh for<br>wrongdoing to occur<br>um the we you know we were were also<br>told that there was probably not a lot<br>of large-scale corruption although of<br>course whether the people would have<br>told us had there been any is is an open<br>question uh but certainly people<br>acknowledged the perception that there<br>was um and even then we certainly got<br>told about some pretty concerning<br>incidents um we heard more than one<br>account of political party leaders being<br>at public events and people coming up to<br>them literally with envelope stuff with<br>cash you know the sort of thing that you<br>think only happens in other countries um<br>now in both those instances the people<br>telling us that anecdote insisted that<br>of course they had dealt with us in a<br>very uh upfront and correct manner in<br>which they had sort of you know rejected<br>the attempt to hand that envelope<br>directly to the leader of that party and<br>it had been channeled through the you<br>know the the correct channels and all<br>that sort of thing but you know of<br>course that is the account that people<br>are going to give you uh when you're<br>talking to<br>them and then lastly um all the<br>particularly the donors that we spoke to<br>the the eight major donors who were<br>donors to all well across multiple of<br>major political parties they all<br>insisted that they didn't buy any<br>influence as as a result of their<br>donations but when we sort of pushed<br>back on that a bit it became clear that<br>they were certainly deriving some pretty<br>strong advantages um they were all very<br>clear to begin with that they donated to<br>political party because they supported<br>its goals and they wanted to see its<br>policies Advanced not just because they<br>believed you know they supported<br>democracy uh quote unquote which is<br>often the public description of wi<br>owners give um it's the description that<br>Paula Bennett always gives about<br>National Party fundraising for instance<br>so the donors were very clear that that<br>wasn't the case they weren't supporting<br>democracy quote unquote they were<br>seeking to you know Advance the an<br>ideological view that they agreed with<br>uh one of them said to us you know I'm<br>slightly far right as a business owner<br>so if a party doesn't you know believe<br>support business I'm not I'm not going<br>to donate to it um one donor also sort<br>of openly said to us well look you know<br>donation makes it easier to get a<br>meeting with a minister uh so very<br>clearly saying that they were buying<br>access now access is not the same as<br>influence but it's obviously a<br>precondition very hard to influence<br>people you can't get access<br>to um so there was that and there was<br>also um very very cozy relationships uh<br>that that were revealed in these<br>interviews so for instance you know one<br>donor said to us oh well you know of<br>course I don't get any influence from my<br>donations and we said well you must uh<br>you must get you know you must sort of<br>get into come into contact a lot with<br>with politicians and they said oh yes<br>well you know I'm in quite apart from<br>the fact that I live on the same street<br>um as John key uh when I was a labor<br>donor uh Helen Clark came around for<br>dinner a couple of times and now that<br>I'm an ex donor David Seymour pops<br>around quote for a chat about life<br>unquote uh and this was all said as if<br>this were all totally normal and natural<br>as if it happened to all of us you know<br>as if I'm sort of constantly you know<br>having Chris Hipkins asked to come<br>around to my house for and just sort of<br>fending politicians off with a stick um<br>and so the the the the impression we got<br>very strongly was of a not particularly<br>transparent world where<br>fundraisers and donors and party leaders<br>were coming into contact constant<br>contact with each other dinners at donor<br>houses fundraising events you know<br>auctions sitting together for long<br>periods at tables just this very strong<br>proc process of<br>socialization uh in connection and<br>frankly if that didn't lead uh to some<br>kind of influence then most of our<br>intuitions about the world would be<br>incorrect I think and on that happy note<br>I'll hand over to Lisa to talk about the<br>public<br>survey so uh moving from talking about<br>those on the inside to looking at the<br>views of those somewhat more on the<br>outside so what we did was uh around<br>about this time last year we did a<br>survey of uh around about a thousand<br>people uh just over actually um<br>nationally representative sample uh I<br>will just cev at what I'm about to show<br>you when I say nationally representative<br>sample is of course a lot of the<br>population are not very politically<br>involved and you can actually see that<br>coming through in some of the uh the<br>data that I'm about to share with you<br>but we had two main parts to this survey<br>so there was some requests for a general<br>View on donations and political parties<br>and so on and then what we did because<br>we were interested in state funding and<br>what people would think of State funding<br>we put forward um three options of<br>different state funding to see what<br>people thought about those uh so uh<br>we're not going to show you all the data<br>we just a very very small snapshot of<br>particularly the the part one data so<br>this is just to give you an idea of some<br>of the some of the questions that we<br>asked so uh first one and uh links quite<br>nicely to what Mex was just talking<br>about with<br>transparency uh we asked how important<br>were you know each of these things to<br>our respondents and the first one is<br>that parties provide information on<br>where their money is coming from so<br>transparency so on your left the the red<br>on your left in case you can't see the<br>little writing at the bottom uh the<br>darker red is when our survey respondent<br>said it was very important and the<br>brighter red is is where it was somewhat<br>important<br>the blue is where it's not really<br>important at all or just only you know<br>really not not a a small importance<br>small level of importance now I said to<br>you about the political uh engagement<br>you'll see there are a couple of gray<br>boxes in the middle so the lighter gray<br>is where people are neutral and then the<br>darker gray is where people are unsure<br>and I'll talk you through this as we go<br>through these questions but actually<br>some of the people in the middle there<br>either undecided or or neutral or unsure<br>some of these numbers are actually quite<br>big so let's start with transparency uh<br>over two over three quarters of our<br>respondents felt that it was important<br>that parties should provide some<br>transparency on where their money's<br>coming from and only 7% felt this was<br>unimportant and that very much ties in<br>with everything that we heard from our<br>other data source collection so<br>particularly the the focus groups and<br>the<br>interviews we then asked another couple<br>of questions about uh who should be able<br>to donate so we asked a question about<br>whether people living outside New<br>Zealand uh should be able to donate and<br>as you can see there uh less than half<br>just less than half said that that was<br>important another one that we asked was<br>whether only enrolled voters so in other<br>words natural persons should be able to<br>donate so specifically<br>um rolling out companies trade unions<br>that type of thing uh and again you're<br>starting to see relatively small amounts<br>of people thinking this or smaller<br>amounts of people thinking this was<br>important so just over 40% said that was<br>important but also note in the middle<br>they've got a large group of people<br>another 40% who are essentially<br>undecided on that one but interestingly<br>enough the amounts of people who are<br>saying these things are not important<br>are still actually relatively small and<br>then the last one we're going to share<br>with you of this type of question is<br>whether people thought it was important<br>that political parties essentially<br>should expand their base of of donors so<br>should raise most of their money from<br>smaller donors rather than larger donors<br>again around about a third of people<br>said that that was important but again<br>about half of them at this point in the<br>middle there with without without a<br>strong view on that<br>one and again as I said earlier I think<br>this just reflects the um the sort of<br>lack of political engagement whether it<br>you know a reasonable subsection of the<br>population so then what we wanted to do<br>is we wanted to get into the idea a<br>little bit more of State funding so we<br>asked a question about what's the right<br>balance for where political parties<br>should get their<br>money and the first one there's<br>basically the the um row at the top is<br>only private donations so 28% of people<br>said y should only be from donations<br>from uh<br>supporters and the other four in<br>red uh essentially allow for some<br>component of State funding just<br>different degrees of State funding so<br>the 3% at the bottom is only state<br>funding and then the other three in the<br>middle are you some balance between<br>private funding and state funding so if<br>we look at the uh the uh proportion of<br>people who were happy to have at least<br>some degree of State funding that comes<br>to about to 58% of our um respondents in<br>this survey and a relatively small<br>amount of people who were unsure with<br>this<br>one so then what we did is we gave our<br>respondents three policy ideas to think<br>about and we asked for each of these<br>ideas what people thought of them and<br>whether they would support them so here<br>are the three options and uh you know<br>some are more or less radical than<br>others so the first one the per vote<br>funding this is used a lot overseas to<br>fund political parties so pretty<br>straightforward by way of idea it's<br>after an election parties get funded<br>based on um amount of votes that they<br>get so um The Proposal that we put<br>to got one microphone on so um I don't<br>think any of our settings have changed<br>there we go seems to have sorted itself<br>out um so uh yeah so uh um $2 for each<br>vote up to a relatively lsh sort of<br>threshold and then a dollar for any<br>subsequent votes beyond that and the<br>idea of having it teered is that it do<br>doesn't overly Advantage the larger or<br>the incumbent parties with that per vote<br>funding usually what you see in practice<br>is a lump sum some sort of lump sum<br>provision alongside that we didn't put<br>that into our proposal here because it<br>was just we thought it would have been<br>just sort of overwhelming people with<br>with information so that was option one<br>as a really common relatively common<br>globally the second one is tax credits<br>so you probably familiar with the system<br>that we have at the moment for tax<br>credits for charitable donations so you<br>make a donation to charity and you get<br>33% of it back our policy settings that<br>we gave our respondents were based on<br>the system in Canada which works really<br>well for them uh and it's quite generous<br>the way they have their tax credit<br>amount setup so we uh pretty much copied<br>their policy settings for our proposal<br>here and the idea was that we um for a<br>donation of $400 to a political party<br>the political party would get the<br>$400 uh the uh donor would get $300 back<br>so it's a<br>75% uh tax credit and uh that's exactly<br>what they do in<br>Canada um in Canada it is tiered as well<br>so it's not not an unlimited amount of<br>money that you can donate and get three<br>qus of it back it's actually only up to<br>$400 Canadian dollars and then it abates<br>based on higher uh higher levels of<br>donation so we for each of these options<br>we did provide a a little bit more<br>detail but um not overly much we would<br>didn't want to overwhelm people and then<br>the third option here is democracy<br>vouchers and this was um one that Max<br>came up with but he when I say came up<br>with he didn't invent he um they do this<br>in Seattle in Washington it's Washington<br>state in the US and the idea is that<br>your um enrolled voters get literally<br>get given a voucher that they can then<br>pass on to their political party of<br>their choosing so we set this at a<br>relatively low amount when we were<br>putting this to our respondents we said<br>$20 uh because we wanted to keep it<br>within a sort of a costing threshold<br>that we were working with but in the US<br>uh and Seattle<br>they have they sent to their enrolled<br>voters four vouchers of $25 each so $100<br>so it is actually quite generous and<br>that way uh the um people can split it<br>they can send it to different parties if<br>they want so here is what our<br>respondents said in relation to each of<br>these uh so again pretty big numbers of<br>people<br>undecided but more people supporting<br>these options than not supporting them<br>in any Cas and in all the<br>cases tax credits surprisingly were I<br>thought it was surprising were the ones<br>that were got the most support per vote<br>funding was the one that received the<br>least which again I I thought was sort<br>of interesting I thought the pur vote<br>funding would have been the one that<br>attracted the most interest um and<br>democracy vouchers again given that this<br>would be reasonably radical policy uh<br>also received a reasonable degree of<br>support um so that was just some of the<br>findings um obviously if you do want to<br>read more about that it is all in the<br>report I'm going to hand back to Mex now<br>Mex is going to talk you through uh some<br>of the findings that we did because we<br>did a really comprehensive analysis of<br>what is done internationally uh and is<br>also just um which I think is quite<br>topical given that costings of policy is<br>all um all we seem to be talking about<br>at the moment we are just going to show<br>you how we costed out uh that proposal<br>for tax credits just so that it um you<br>could you can essentially see how little<br>it would actually cost to put into<br>practice thank you<br>Max yeah great thanks Lisa um I mean<br>it's interesting on that on that perote<br>funding being relatively less popular<br>than you might have thought I think that<br>might because we also did some focus<br>groups um which were're not presenting<br>the results of here and what came<br>through in that was a real concern I<br>think that smaller parties be well<br>funded um and that systems not overly<br>favor incumber and I suspect that even<br>with sort of per vote funding being<br>structured to try to push back against<br>incumbency that's still what people<br>heard uh that it would reinforce<br>incumbency so that might be what's going<br>on there<br>um yeah okay so a little bit about<br>International approaches to um<br>regulating political party Finance which<br>as Lisa said we did um quite a big<br>survey of the of 32 countries in the<br>oecd for which we could find re L good<br>data um and various findings sort of<br>come out of that um most oecd countries<br>require publication of the donor's<br>identity if they give over<br>$5,000 um at the time we were doing our<br>research that threshold in New Zealand<br>was<br>15,000 uh so we were you know reasonably<br>out of step with the OCD I would say uh<br>some the changes at least are referred<br>to at the end of last year the the<br>current government brought in has taken<br>the threshold for disclosure down to<br>$5,000 in New Zealand as well uh so<br>we're coming more on line with the OCD<br>um but there are still a number of<br>countries that require uh disclosure of<br>the donor's identity at lower levels um<br>you know over $1,500 doar say so there's<br>still certainly further we could go on<br>that um we're one of only uh a third of<br>countries in in our oecd sample so only<br>11 I think uh that allow unlimited<br>donations you can give as much as you<br>like to a political party and someone<br>has just given the National Party<br>$500,000 in one go uh in most countries<br>that would not be possible they set<br>limits uh those limits can be quite High<br>I mean some countries the limit is<br>$100,000 a year but in Canada for<br>instance Leisa has already referred to<br>Canada uh the limit is in the ballpark<br>of about<br>$2,000 New Zealand a year so you can<br>have very stringent limits on these<br>things and some count countries do and<br>they're obviously doing so to try to<br>restrict the opportunities for uh for<br>for purchasing access and<br>influence um New Zealand is also a bit<br>of an outline having no restrictions on<br>what type of entities can donate and<br>again Lisa sort of touched on this a bit<br>earlier um there's no sort of systematic<br>approach to this in the OCD but most<br>countries restrict donations from<br>companies or trade unions or both um and<br>we don't really do either of that so i'<br>would say that even with the changes<br>that have occurred since we were doing<br>this research we're still at the weekly<br>donations so<br>um in terms of what we ended up<br>recommending in our report money for<br>something uh we had five key<br>recommendations um the first was that<br>the threshold for disclosing donors<br>identity should be lowered to, 1500<br>um Loosely on the basis that there's no<br>evidence that donations below that<br>amount purchase access or<br>influence and people do have some<br>reasonable expectation of privacy when<br>giving small amounts to the political<br>party of their choice uh if you had to<br>disclose every donation to political<br>parties and you'd be Faithfully forcing<br>people to publicly declare their um<br>political allegiances if they wanted to<br>support that party<br>financially uh we recommend and that's a<br>recommendation that was essentially<br>endorsed in the the independent<br>electoral review panels interim report<br>this year we suggested capping the<br>amount you can donate in any given year<br>at<br>$15,000 uh to each political party uh<br>and the independent electoral panel this<br>year recommended well effectively<br>$10,000 so again same sort of<br>ballpark um we recommended the Electoral<br>commission needs greater powers to<br>investigate potential um wrongdoing when<br>it comes to BU donations we recommended<br>that only eligible voters should be able<br>to donate and lastly we made some<br>recommendations for State<br>funding um and just on that briefly<br>should say I mean this is a complex<br>question<br>because you know some people in the<br>public would probably perceive that we<br>don't have state funding of political<br>parties but in point of fact we do in at<br>least two forms uh there's the<br>broadcasting allowance every year with<br>political parties get between them<br>several million dollars uh for their<br>election<br>advertising<br>uh there's also quite significant<br>funding for parties to carry out their<br>parliamentary duties so quite large and<br>tens of millions of dollars allocations<br>in the budget for the leaders offices of<br>political parties to carry out research<br>and Communications and policy<br>development so on and so forth so<br>actually we already have state funding<br>of political parties in New Zealand the<br>question is<br>is how best to do it and sort of the<br>question we're focused in on here<br>is could we have a<br>system whereby there is greater State<br>funding for parties to carry out their<br>political activities so going out and<br>campaigning and talking to voters and<br>developing<br>policies that would compensate for<br>limiting the amounts that they get in<br>private donations which is obviously<br>what we've suggested so this isn't you<br>know sort of terenus stuff this is just<br>in addition to an existing system of of<br>um and so we again we kind of looked at<br>the Canadian system which just to recap<br>limits donations at $2,000 a year but<br>has very generous tax credit subsidizing<br>smaller uh<br>donations and really the the idea there<br>which I think is very sound is you're<br>trying to shift from a system whereby<br>parties rely on well the whole system<br>relies on large amounts from small<br>numbers of people<br>towards a system that relies on small<br>amounts from large numbers of people so<br>fitfully you want to design a system I<br>think where parties are well resourced<br>but they get that resourcing by going<br>out and engaging with the widest<br>possible number of ordinary new<br>zealanders and then because You' got<br>lots of people giving small amounts it's<br>much harder to exert influence for any<br>given<br>individual um and yeah so the average<br>donation in Canada is about you know<br>equal was<br>$275 uh New Zealand and<br>um the donations amounts sort of $7<br>million or so in a given year um and<br>it's equivalent about 30,000 donors uh<br>in New Zealand under this model um and<br>so then when we sort of pretty roughly<br>costed that you know we looked at that<br>model of you know you get up to 75% of<br>your donation back as a tax<br>credit um and looking at you know what<br>on average that would cost a given donor<br>and what the party would<br>receive you know using sort of various<br>assumptions that came out at a cost to<br>the state of around $7 million which is<br>also about where our estimates of a sort<br>of reasonable per vote funding system<br>would come out because we thought we<br>test that as well and the independent uh<br>electoral review again this year they<br>favored per votee funding and again<br>their costings came out very much in the<br>same ballpark as ours and so sort of the<br>underlying Point here has probably not<br>put too much stress on the Precision of<br>the numbers but is more that actually<br>how small a sum it would take to get rid<br>of big money donations and politics<br>effectively the pitch here is that for<br>about $2 per person per voter we could<br>have a system in which there are no<br>donations any donations bigger than<br>$115,000 um and political parties are<br>going out and getting their funding from<br>you know a wide range of ordinary new<br>zealanders or at least a subset uh of<br>that population so $2 per person to<br>clean big money donations and the<br>potential for Access and influence that<br>they bring right out of the system uh<br>which we thought was a pretty good deal<br>um and just in closing you I know that<br>liser and I finished up this work in<br>November last year but since then uh you<br>know we've only seen more issues around<br>donations Stuart Nash having to resign<br>as a as a minister for having shared um<br>confidential cabinet information with<br>people who happen to be his donors and<br>uh the National Party putting out press<br>releases uh in favor of companies<br>without well and claiming they didn't<br>know uh the people who put out the pr<br>claiming they didn't know that the<br>company that they were supporting in<br>that press release had also effectively<br>been quite a large donor uh to their<br>so these issues remain live ones as we<br>come into the general election next<br>much</p></main><footer style="margin-top: 2rem; background: #0001; padding: 2rem; text-align:
