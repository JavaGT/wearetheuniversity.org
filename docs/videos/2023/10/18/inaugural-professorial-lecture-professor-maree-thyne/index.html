you to this very<br>special occasion to celebrate the<br>promotion of Marie Ty to Professor<br>and these lectures are probably a<br>highlight of some of our weeks they're a<br>great opportunity for all of us to come<br>together and listen to our amazing staff<br>and gain an understanding of the breadth<br>of the research that occurs across the<br>university I'd like to welcome<br>colleagues students and friends from<br>across the university and those joining<br>us via the live<br>stream but I'd like to give a special<br>welcome to Marie's husband Nick develin<br>um her children mlin and Maisy her<br>friend Karen Bane and IUD NRA prit a<br>student of Marie who's with us from<br>Thailand so welcome to you<br>all we don't make it easy at TGO for<br>people to be promoted to professor and<br>in order to be promoted our colleagues<br>need to show that they're outstanding in<br>research teaching and service and also<br>demonstrate<br>leadership as you will shortly hear<br>Maria's clearly met these criteria<br>Marie's research focus is consumer<br>Behavior particularly recently tourist<br>behavior and Marie was talking about<br>social<br>distancing perhaps in a slightly<br>different context a long time before<br>coid arrived and um I'm hoping that<br>she's going to explain the difference<br>between social distancing and physical<br>distancing Marie's an expert in cruise<br>ship cruise ship tourism and I will<br>remember her in early<br>2020 having a ringing me up and having a<br>conversation about whether she should go<br>ahead with a trip on a cruise ship<br>gather data because of the risk of<br>coid thankfully she decided to to delay<br>the<br>project as well as being a great teacher<br>Marie has held various leadership roles<br>across the university and is now the<br>Prov Vice Chancellor of<br>Commerce congratulations Marie on your<br>well-deserved promotion we're very<br>fortunate to have you at a Target<br>and it now gives me great pleasure to to<br>introduce Professor Rob lawon who's<br>going to provide a formal introduction<br>tenot Oto K cor Rob lson toku<br>Ina I'm both delighted and privileged to<br>have the task of introducing Professor<br>Marie Ty to you this<br>evening Marie is an outstanding academic<br>and dear friend who I first met in<br>1996 she has a ba in English in<br>1994 and followed that with a post<br>graduate diploma in tourism with<br>distinction in<br>1995 in 1996 uh she came to work with me<br>and others on a uh public good science<br>funded uh research program that we had<br>looking at aspects of tourist behavior<br>and environmental and social impacts of<br>Tourism so we employed as a junior<br>research fellow on that project and<br>she'd been with us probably for a matter<br>of a few months or so and she put her<br>head around the door one morning and<br>said um Rob have you got time to answer<br>a few questions that I have and I I said<br>sure and she came in and really she only<br>had one question and that was how do I<br>job I might be paraphrasing slightly but<br>that that that's that's essentially what<br>you said and so it started um a uh<br>diploma a graduate diploma for graduates<br>in marketing and statistics the<br>statistics wasn't her first choice<br>really I I I don't think but uh typical<br>of of Marie uh if something needs doing<br>note of her personality without any fuss<br>it gets done so no complaints no no no<br>anything and uh of course the PHD so she<br>had some very clear ideas about her PhD<br>which I think I'm sure uh what she<br>wanted to do for that and they were<br>subject to some quite strong exter<br>external<br>scrutiny uh we wrote them up as an<br>objective for the rebid on the um on the<br>tourism research to the SC public good<br>science fund and they passed the<br>reviewers and the panel and we got full<br>funding for them and then we also<br>invited or suggested that Marie might<br>want to go over to Melbourne and present<br>a proposal to a at a colloquium for<br>doctoral students to a panel of<br>international<br>experts well um amongst those experts<br>there was a certain Professor Jordan<br>louvier who had a reputation for being<br>pretty tough and he was also the world's<br>number one academic in the application<br>of conjoint<br>analysis which was the technique that<br>Marie had chosen for her data analysis<br>for her PhD and quite a novel technique<br>in application in her area so I can<br>guarantee you that whatever nerves Marie<br>has tonight they're probably nothing<br>like the on she had had before that<br>colloquium presentation all those years<br>uh I want to just make a slight aside<br>here because all this seems Seems<br>wonderful and um it was and Marie sailed<br>through all these things brilliantly but<br>she did have one hiccup in her life at<br>that time which was the sad illness and<br>death of her<br>brother and uh that affected<br>everyone remarkably but I have to make a<br>comment that the fortitude and bravery<br>which Marie showed through those that<br>that time was absolutely amazing and it<br>didn't really deflect her she she was<br>amazing in coping with that so um a<br>memory for Matt I think and he would be<br>very<br>proud the PHD was completed in 2001 and<br>when she left left ataro to take up a<br>post at the abedine business school and<br>in that position she established an<br>active research record and started to<br>develop a series of international links<br>which is maintained and developed ever<br>since Marie returned to ataro as a<br>senior lecturer in 2006 and was promoted<br>to associate professor in<br>2011 since then she's taken time for<br>maternity and family as well as<br>continuing active<br>career and and was promoted to Professor<br>in<br>2011 the same year as she took on the<br>marketing and now as we've heard she's<br>moved to the position of pro Vice<br>Chancellor for the School of<br>Business a promotion to Professor<br>demonstrates excellent as as the vice<br>Chancellor said in all three<br>areas just EXA uh finding a few figures<br>behind that she's the author of over 100<br>Publications in journals books and<br>refereed conference proceedings a<br>quarter of those are in a or a star<br>rated<br>journals and she's also won several best<br>paper awards at<br>conferences and been invited as a<br>distinguished researcher to universities<br>in both Japan and the United<br>Kingdom and she's been active in passing<br>on that those skills by supervising a<br>dozen phds and countless Masters<br>students over the<br>years and as well as a research record I<br>have to make special mention of a<br>teaching a teaching is both research Le<br>and student centered and that's not<br>always an easy combination to<br>achieve and if you look at the comments<br>from student comments on their<br>evaluations they're littered with words<br>like enthusiastic superb communication<br>inspiring captivating attention holding<br>she teaches people how to think<br>critically and how to learn so she did<br>get my<br>job and and now she's got one which I<br>never aspired to at all ladies and<br>gentlemen I'd like to invite Professor<br>Martin to present her inaugural<br>professorial<br>lecture<br>Oto<br>Oto<br>sorry core Marie Taco<br>WIA core Michael too Mara core Judy Taco<br>fire nor Pleasant poo Nora Teno Teno<br>ten<br>well here we are welcome to my inaugural<br>professorial<br>lecture Vice Chancellor ten a professor<br>Lawson ten a thank you both so much for<br>the introduction um and for your very<br>very kind words Rob I don't actually<br>think I've got anything more to say and<br>probably take that as uh the fastest one<br>and carry on with our<br>evening to my esteemed colleagues<br>students friends and Fano a big thank<br>you for taking the time out of your<br>Thursday evening to join me here<br>today although I distinctly remember<br>telling you many of you that you were to<br>find something else to do<br>I would like to thank AUD for being here<br>tonight AUD lives in Thailand but<br>fortunately has been spending has been<br>just spending some time in Christ Church<br>so has traveled here today I was A's<br>tutor and lecturer 23 years ago and I<br>still get a Christmas card from him<br>every year that is an absolute honor to<br>have you here tonight thank you so<br>much well this takes me back to<br>preparing for my PhD<br>vior I must admit I wasn't too excited<br>about it I'm not sure how many people<br>are but Rob Lawson said to me in his<br>naturally encouraging way come on make<br>the most of it when else are you going<br>to get to walk into a room and just talk<br>about your<br>PhD I feel the same here 40 minutes just<br>to talk about me so I will begin with my<br>journey which includes many of you here<br>in this room I will then move to my<br>research which again includes many of<br>you here in this room and I will finish<br>with my words of thanks to many of you<br>here in this<br>room and unfortunately some who<br>aren't gosh<br>already okay I'm going to have to work<br>on that for the next few<br>minutes so to<br>begin I had what I believe to be the dis<br>in Fortune to grow up on a farm in South<br>Canterbury a beautiful area called<br>levels Valley which is very close to<br>Pleasant Point which is very close to<br>taru it was the farm that my father<br>Michael Ty was born on he named the farm<br>hanora Kil key hanora was the Christian<br>name of the first woman that we know of<br>who lived on the farm and Kil key is<br>where the times originated from in<br>County clear<br>Island<br>my parents owned the farm until they<br>retired in<br>2014 it was truly magical I rode horses<br>and motorbikes from the age of seven<br>drove tractors from 10 and our Land<br>Rover from the age of<br>12 I hugely value the upbringing that I<br>had it was tough the droughts and huge<br>interest rates of the 1980s made farming<br>very difficult and it was touch and go<br>as to whether we were going to be able<br>to hang on to the<br>farm fortunately we made it through and<br>I believe that the concepts of toughing<br>it out and stickability of values<br>instilled in me from a very young<br>age also the farming attitude if you<br>don't do the work there will be no one<br>there to do it for you really got me<br>through my PhD and<br>Beyond it is a get on with it work ethic<br>that I believe I still have<br>but farming is all about is also about<br>community and people growing up there<br>was always help shared across the<br>community everyone chipped in around the<br>busy times of tailing Lambs dipping and<br>shearing sheep and summer cropping and<br>bailing this sense of community has<br>always stuck with me the value of people<br>working<br>together some of my special farming<br>skills were recognized by our local<br>newspaper the Timaru Herald when I was<br>about<br>nine my children get into the ODT for<br>being the official dinosaur Ambassador<br>for the atago<br>museum or starring in a children's TV<br>program I made it into the<br>newspaper for riding a<br>sheep badly as you can see and if you<br>notice the next one tried desperately to<br>get<br>away<br>I probably always assumed I would stay<br>on a farm and my teachers at Pleasant<br>Point were certainly under the same<br>impression the majority of my school<br>reports detailing my aptitude for<br>socializing and farm Talk versus<br>applying myself seriously to<br>learning now mlin amazy you close your<br>ears this indeed is an example of do<br>what I say and not what I<br>do a couple of clanger fifth form school<br>reports year 11 are my particular<br>favorites my English teacher who was<br>surprisingly influential in my love of<br>English described me as bright amusing<br>lacks confidence in her own ability and<br>nuts and I think that any dean of a<br>business school would be proud of the<br>following from her fifth form economics<br>teacher<br>Marie is not particularly<br>able but has scored reasonably during<br>this<br>year the advice given from my school<br>guidance counselor in seventh form was<br>to either become a<br>hairdresser or triy poly<br>Technic so I pursued my interest in<br>people and love of conversation or just<br>talking<br>and went to oraki poly Technic I just<br>put a building up because I thought we<br>should move away from the reports<br>obviously and I went to oraki poly<br>Technic for a year in tamaru completing<br>a certificate in tourism and<br>Hospitality little did I know that this<br>certificate and the experience from it<br>would influence my career choices for<br>the next 30<br>Years many great things came out of my<br>experience at Ori but but two in<br>particular one a lifelong friend Serita<br>mu and the other was work experience the<br>work experience that I was fortunate to<br>get was a receptionist position at the<br>Hermitage Mount<br>C I ended up being offered a full-time<br>receptionist position and worked at the<br>Hermitage for nearly five months an<br>amazing experience and one that cemented<br>my passion for<br>tourism this was the beginning of the<br>1990s when our International visitor<br>arrival numbers had reached nearly 1<br>million by 2019 they had reached nearly<br>4 million and our largest Target markets<br>were Australia USA and<br>Japan The Hermitage as we know was a<br>extremely extremely popular stop for for<br>overseas visitors and in particular bus<br>tours from Japan and the<br>US I vividly remember an American woman<br>approaching me at the reception desk and<br>and asking me why we had so many signs<br>around the Hermitage that were written<br>in<br>Japanese she told me that if I had<br>wanted to go to Japan on a holiday I<br>would have done<br>so rather I've come to New Zealand and I<br>would expect the signs to be in<br>English this comment proved to shape my<br>PhD research half a decade later and<br>Beyond so February 1991 was decision<br>time stay at the Hermitage or be the<br>first in my family to go to<br>university I dived into the deep end and<br>moved down south shifting into Unico and<br>embarking on a ba English literature<br>inspired by my high school teacher whom<br>I drove<br>nuts the results of the first year of my<br>degree reflect a very good time had at<br>unicol and some excellent lifelong<br>friends<br>especially Betty and<br>Rachel my second year is where a corner<br>was<br>turned the lack of self-confidence that<br>my English teacher referred to was eased<br>through the behavior of one tutor that I<br>had for English 276 New Zealand<br>literature we had the Wonderful Lawrence<br>Jones as the lecturer and I had hether<br>Murray as my<br>tror fortunately this paper used the<br>plus system<br>which worked quite well for me uh and<br>when I nearly failed the first<br>assignment nearly failed Heather Murray<br>met with me and offered her help going<br>forward it certainly worked because the<br>next assignment I received from her was<br>an<br>A+ my first ever in my<br>life I still remember the feeling<br>obviously I thought I'd picked up<br>somebody else's<br>assignment but when I checked the name<br>here was someone who had helped me<br>believed in me and then approved of what<br>I had<br>done the confidence this gave me changed<br>what I believed I could do this single<br>academic had an enormous role in<br>shifting my own views of my<br>ability so finishing my ba with<br>significantly better grades than what I<br>started with fortunately by this stage<br>Professor Jeff kley had set up the<br>center for tourism and in the division<br>of Commerce and this Center offered a<br>postgrad diploma in tourism which is<br>what I did it was prominantly taught by<br>professor kley and also a relatively new<br>lecturer now Emeritus Professor Jurgen<br>noof and a very newly graduated PhD now<br>distinguished Professor James<br>H not only did I have ex excellent<br>lecturers but I also had some awesome<br>my dissertation for the diploma was on<br>carrying capacity of the Skippers Canyon<br>specifically perceptions that visitors<br>had of how other visitors the sheer<br>number of other visitors impacted their<br>experience of the Canon so the impact of<br>crowding on<br>experiences the findings much to the<br>relief of Henry vanes and AJ heckit<br>showed that there was little impact on<br>experiences mainly because people were<br>going to the canyon to do the Skippers<br>bunge jump and there'd be quite a<br>different experience if there weren't<br>tons of people there to watch you did a<br>bungee jump ever really happen if there<br>was no one there to see<br>it fortunately professor kley and his<br>colleague from the Department of<br>marketing were awarded public good<br>science funding for which they could<br>employ research assistance I returned<br>from a stinton Queenstown working in<br>hotels back to the university to start a<br>master's and take up one of the research<br>positions I worked on carrying capacity<br>projects with Jeff kley and a Fab<br>research team meeting my dear friend<br>Emma Holt and then I was moved into a<br>different project around resident<br>attitudes towards tourism development<br>Lawson I had never met Rob before nor<br>indeed anyone from the Department of<br>marketing but it was one of the most<br>fortunate things to have ever happened<br>to<br>me Rob became my primary PhD supervisor<br>and Sarah Todd joined the supervisory<br>team also I could not be more grateful<br>for the support of my supervisor team<br>they were awesome thank you Sarah and a<br>big thank you to<br>rob my supervisor head of Department<br>mentor and<br>friend you made me want to succeed and<br>you gave me the confidence to do so<br>I'm going to leave this one up there for<br>a while<br>though while doing my PhD and largely<br>encouraged encouraged forced encouraged<br>by Rob so that I might actually get an<br>understanding of marketing and some kind<br>of small grasp of Statistics I did a<br>diploma for graduates in marketing and<br>statistics one of the assignments I did<br>for the consumer Behavior paper I was a<br>student in involved interviews at the<br>atago Museum where I sought to<br>understand the deep-seated values based<br>motivations that visitors have for going<br>to a<br>museum I happened to talk to a fellow<br>PhD student about this small project I<br>was working on and she suggested I try<br>and publish it which I did thank you<br>inar not only was this a real confidence<br>boost whilst doing my PhD but it also<br>shaped much of my research in the future<br>I have natur naturally leaned to towards<br>qualitative research it's got nothing to<br>do with Statistics<br>or what could be better than having a<br>conversation and then analyzing it and<br>this article has become one of my most<br>cited<br>Publications the most important finding<br>in this study was the prevalence of<br>socially oriented motivations behind<br>visiting a museum being with friends and<br>family whereas traditionally a museum<br>visit had been linked to more<br>individualistic motivations such as<br>education and<br>knowledge the push for edutainment was a<br>large component of this paper the<br>entertainment encouraging Hands-On<br>experiences for families especially<br>children to engage with museums rather<br>than passively view static objects<br>consider the changes in the museums over<br>the past 23 years since this work<br>once I finished my PhD which we'll get<br>back to I was ready to explore Academia<br>and life outside of<br>ataro inspired by the only Scottish<br>people I knew and believing all Scots<br>people to be as wonderful and<br>enthusiastic for life as them my second<br>big thank you and shout out to my dear<br>friends Ken and Sandra Deans I moved to<br>abedine for a lecturing position at the<br>Robert Gordon<br>University I continued to publish from<br>my PhD whilst also developing new areas<br>of research in Scotland working with<br>colleagues at<br>rgu there was quite an advantage being a<br>big fish in a small like new University<br>Pond not only did the people of abdine<br>foolishly as it turns out pin their<br>hopes on this kiwi being a pro touch<br>rugby player but various Scottish<br>tourism policy and government groups<br>called for a New Zealand perspective on<br>tourism development vment in Scotland<br>recognizing the successes that we had<br>had through the 1990s and early 2000s as<br>a tourism<br>destination the input I had here was<br>significantly more successful than my<br>touch rugby<br>schools during my 5 years at igu I<br>helped set up and manage an organization<br>established to Aid the actioning of a<br>national tourism framework which was<br>developed by Scottish Enterprise tourism<br>knowledge Scotland the national tourism<br>board brought together tourism academics<br>around Scotland with the aim of<br>assisting in tourism policy through<br>knowledge transfer between academics and<br>Industry this was an excellent<br>experience and an example of town and<br>gown<br>partnership while at abedine I also<br>taught into the masters of marketing<br>program at St Andrews University a<br>fantastic experience of teaching to very<br>large Master's programs and a big thank<br>you to Jim Bell brandan gray and Rod<br>mcnorton who were teaching at St Andrews<br>at the time and managed to convince them<br>that they needed another atigo person<br>treading their<br>boards during a chat with Brendan he<br>told me that AO were looking to hire I<br>had been in Scotland at that stage for<br>five years I loved every minute of it<br>but felt that it was now or possibly<br>never to return home so I gave it a shot<br>I applied for position back in the<br>department of marketing and was hired a<br>big thank you to David Ballentine Phil<br>Harris Yuga off and a smaller thanks to<br>King<br>Deans he knows why so I returned to<br>atago in<br>2006 and I would like to take a moment<br>to send some araha to David and Jackie<br>Ballentine who are online just<br>now since returning to atago I have<br>taught across all levels and number of<br>subjects I love teaching interacting and<br>engaging with students playing my part<br>in their University experience and<br>preparing them for their place in the<br>world we have a challenge ahead of<br>us around what such engagement looks<br>like in an increasingly Tech dependent<br>world and a world with financial<br>pressures where studying fulltime is<br>increasingly becoming a<br>luxury certainly this environment is<br>very different from when I started<br>teaching as it is for most of<br>us but we have our students whom we can<br>learn from we have amazing students and<br>we are so fortunate with our USA<br>executive who are front and center of<br>the learning<br>environment one of the highlights in my<br>role this year has been working more<br>closely with USA and I want to take a<br>moment to acknowledge Quinton Jane for<br>all his Mahi and Leadership of ousa this<br>year so that's my journey Pleasant Point<br>denan abedine and back to denan all the<br>hot spots of the<br>world and throughout this journey is my<br>research and I thought I would just<br>focus on three main research streams<br>with you my PhD research which explored<br>the concept of social distance and<br>continues to feed into my research<br>projects today this research was<br>influenced by my time at the<br>Hermitage my research on museums and<br>literary tourism influenced by the study<br>that I told you about earlier and my<br>English literature degree and my<br>research on cruise tourism influenced by<br>the desire to go on a<br>cruise I embarked on my PhD in the late<br>1990s a time when sustainable tourism<br>was a Hot Topic research was progressing<br>away from sustain ability referring<br>mainly to physical and natural<br>environment to a focus on the social and<br>cultural impacts of Tourism and the need<br>to consider these When developing<br>tourism products much like what is being<br>discussed at the moment in the media<br>around the proposed terce airport<br>development it was finally being re<br>recognized although arguably over 20<br>years later still not being actioned<br>that sustainable tourism management<br>relies on the support of the host<br>community and that there was an<br>increased need to research residents<br>perceptions of the tourism industry and<br>tourism<br>development I argued in my PhD that<br>although research was shifting toward<br>including the host community and tourism<br>development the focus had largely been<br>on specific attributes of the community<br>members and how these might impact their<br>opinions about tourism for example were<br>they employed in theour tourism industry<br>how far did they live from the Tourism<br>Center and how long a resident had lived<br>in their area<br>for my thesis was driven by my<br>experience at the Hermitage with the<br>American tourists complaining about the<br>signs and Japanese and also media<br>releases around the type of tourist who<br>was visiting New Zealand at that time<br>and a demand through the media that<br>tourists should act and behave in the<br>same way as we do when in Rome or New<br>Zealand do as the kiwis<br>do so I embarked on a project<br>investigating the impact that the type<br>of tourist has on Resident attitudes<br>towards tourism<br>development incorporating a concept<br>taken from sociology social distance<br>exploring how the social distance<br>experienced with various tourist types<br>would impact upon the host community's<br>support for<br>tourism when I began investigating<br>social distance at this time it was not<br>a common term it had been used a bit in<br>sociology uh in the 60s and 70s and<br>earlier but not really in the 80s and<br>90s and certainly not in tourism or<br>marketing<br>literature the year 2020 saw a dramatic<br>Resurgence of the term social distance<br>but I and others argue that we've not<br>been using this in the correct sense<br>rather we were physically<br>distancing I understand how the term<br>came about a concern around social<br>Gatherings so distance yourselves<br>physically while you're socializing<br>which then probably got shorten to<br>social distance but social distance<br>actually refers to sympathetic<br>understanding the sympathetic<br>understanding that exists between people<br>and was often used in earlier literature<br>as a measurement of prejudice racism<br>ethnocentrism since there had not been<br>any social distance scales developed for<br>the context of Tourism and host guest<br>relations I embarked on developing such<br>a scale I also developed a conjoint<br>analysis experiment to manipulate the<br>nationality age and type of tourist so<br>whether they were a bu a sorry a<br>Backpacker or a bus tourist to determine<br>which of these factors to be most<br>important to tourist<br>preferences the nationalities used in my<br>research were United States Japanese<br>German and Australian presenting four of<br>the major International inbound markets<br>of the late<br>1990s the results of my thesis showed<br>that new zealanders felt more socially<br>close to us and Australian tourists than<br>they did to German or Japanese and that<br>residents who were less accepting of<br>Tourism development showed higher levels<br>of social distance especially to German<br>and Japanese<br>tourists the conjoint experiment<br>confirmed nationality of the tourists to<br>be the most important factor in<br>determining tourist type<br>preferences and what were the impacts of<br>these<br>results the research was disseminated<br>not only through academic Publications<br>but also through public good science<br>fund where recommendations were made<br>around inter marketing<br>strategies I recommended education<br>programs designed first for industry<br>members such as accommodation managers<br>and Frontline staff to be rolled out<br>through organizations such as kiwi<br>host one of my focus group participants<br>who I'd had was a motel owner who<br>admitted to giving only Asian tourists a<br>wiiz up as soon as they arrived to stay<br>in his<br>Motel he stated that because it's colder<br>here than their country when they go to<br>bed they open the door of the oven and<br>turn the the elements on<br>full the participant never suggested<br>that this might be dangerous rather just<br>a real pain for him because he had to<br>clean up the condensation in the<br>morning therefore when Asian visitors<br>arrived he proudly spoke about the wiiz<br>up he gave them of not to make a<br>mess I'm pretty sure it would not only<br>be tourists from Asian countries who may<br>have found his motel room cold and I<br>suggest in an installation of extra<br>heating or at least making sure the<br>visitor knows how to use effectively the<br>heating that is in place for example<br>instructions in their own language would<br>have been a better<br>solution adapting the product to suit<br>the customer advocated in traditional<br>marketing strategy for<br>years fast forward 15 years and a<br>visiting scholar uh Mari Yoshida who was<br>from uh Ritz amican University in Osaka<br>Japan came for a 12-month visit to our<br>department Japan was at that time around<br>2015 witnessing a dramatic increase in<br>inbound tourism and Japan's government<br>had expressed a commitment to developing<br>the international tourism industry<br>further preco most foreign tourists<br>visiting Japan came from other Asian<br>Nationals with the top visitor numbers<br>being from China then Korea and<br>Taiwan outside of Asia the larger<br>markets were USA and<br>Australia when we collected our data in<br>2016 visitor numbers were certainly on<br>an uphill trajectory and there was<br>little research being undertaken on the<br>Japanese residents and their views of<br>Tourism<br>development so myself Leo Watkins and<br>marioa adapted my social social distance<br>scale for a Japanese jaese context and<br>using a sample from across Japan we<br>measured the social distance perceived<br>between residents and tourists namely<br>Japanese Taiwanese USA and<br>Australian and then tested that<br>perceived social distance with attitudes<br>towards tourism development<br>generally we found significantly higher<br>Social distance with Chinese and<br>Taiwanese tourists and with higher<br>feelings of social distance came<br>significantly less support for tourism<br>generally in this study we argued for<br>government and Regional strategies to be<br>implemented to encourage positive<br>Japanese and visitor relations we<br>critiqued the example of the recently<br>published Travelers etiquette guide to<br>Hokkaido a pamphlet published and<br>distributed especially to Chinese<br>tourists to assist them to understand<br>the Japanese mind for a pleasant and<br>rewarding visit<br>the pamphlet points to sorry proceeds to<br>points and tips on how Chinese visitors<br>should behave around Japanese<br>locals whether that is you should speak<br>in a<br>whisper you should be punctual ensuring<br>orderly Q<br>behavior and you should have General uh<br>tranquil and tidy table<br>etiquette by following these tips the<br>haido public interest associ ation<br>promises that the doors will open to<br>many joyful and memorable<br>experiences instead we suggested<br>guidance could be provided for the host<br>communities especially those working<br>within the tourism industry around the<br>value and importance of understanding<br>the Chinese market and other visitors<br>and how to provide a quality experience<br>for these<br>markets such as the China toolkit that<br>was developed by tourism New Zealand in<br>2016 for businesses to understand and<br>cater for our growing Chinese visitor<br>Market I presented this research to the<br>Japan Society for marketing and<br>distribution and Industry members<br>certainly seemed aware of the ret<br>rhetoric being used and were actively<br>promoting a change in Focus however this<br>was in<br>2019 and now of course the marketing is<br>about just trying to get people<br>Japan the second research stream I want<br>to share with you combines my passion of<br>Tourism and<br>literature in 2006 anarie heed then a<br>lecturer at Deacon University in mbour<br>visited the tourism Department I ended<br>up working with amarie for the next<br>nearly 20 years until she retired from<br>her professor role at Victoria<br>University in Melbourne this<br>year amarie and I were especially<br>interested in literary museums and the<br>visitor experience in particular the<br>role that authenticity plays in the<br>experience authenticity has been<br>considered to be at the heart of a<br>museum and while there has been some<br>discussion as to whether museums ever<br>really present the authentic it has been<br>argued in the literature that<br>authenticity is a measure of Museum's<br>distinctiveness however in the context<br>of reduced funding and increased<br>competition today's museums are<br>challenged with a task of sourcing<br>preserving and presenting the<br>authentic tours instead may be staged or<br>completely scripted and objects<br>displayed might be replicas the ex<br>exhibitions can be virtual or the guides<br>dressed in Period<br>costumes the inauthentic has become as<br>much a part of the visitor experience as<br>the authentic<br>am Marie and I were interested in<br>understanding the processes by which<br>museums and visitors negotiate this<br>inauthentic we set our research within<br>two literary<br>museums 56 Eden Street the childhood<br>home of Janet frame in aaro and the<br>Katherine Mansfield house the birthplace<br>of Katherine Mansfield in<br>Wellington we found that visitors and C<br>curators together co-created the<br>experience that visitors have in both<br>museums it is the way in which the<br>attributes of authenticity are<br>communicated to visitors they are guided<br>to create the value from the museum<br>experience while both museums provide<br>very different experiences and rely on<br>different types of authenticity for<br>example most of the artifacts at 56 Eden<br>Street are authentic to the era that<br>Janet lived there but not to Janet<br>herself whereas the Katherine house<br>contains many many items owned by<br>Katherine herself the outcome for the<br>visitors appears to be very<br>similar visitors at both museums felt<br>close to the author and their life these<br>feelings were created through their own<br>knowledge past experience sense of<br>nostalgia and in some cases their<br>Devotion to the<br>author and it was co-created by the<br>curator and the guides where they off<br>where they off where they are often<br>sorry vital in developing and producing<br>a familiarity with the author an<br>understanding and sense of their<br>home whether this be through expert<br>storytelling or the provision of<br>artifacts visitors to both museums make<br>a connection with it visitors and the<br>curators work together to co-produce the<br>valuable Museum<br>experience Emory and I worked a lot with<br>the 56 Eden Street Trust focusing on the<br>role that the curators play visitors<br>don't need authentic objects to have an<br>authentic experience in the instance of<br>the literary Museum it is enough for<br>them to just be there to be walking<br>where Janet or Catherine had<br>walked one respondent at 56 Eden Street<br>stressed that for them it was a link to<br>Janet her family and her place we<br>encouraged the creation of 56 Eden<br>Street to utilize their own fandom of<br>Janet to build the experience for<br>visitors an easy task when people are<br>coming to the museum just to get the<br>sense of an author they admire as one<br>respondent put it I wanted to imagine<br>how it felt to be here I wanted to<br>somehow feel closer to Janet's<br>experiences by visiting the home she<br>lived in somehow experiencing something<br>of her life by walking through the rooms<br>she walked in to be in her home makes my<br>experience of Janet FR and her work more<br>personal I have more recently expanded<br>This research with my friend and<br>colleague Professor gritchen Larson from<br>Durham<br>University where we have investigated<br>the link between literary tourism and<br>place branding using the popular tourist<br>town of Hoth in the<br>UK howth was the home of the Bronte<br>family Emily Bronte of course wrote<br>weing Heights and Charlotte Bronte wrote<br>janer in this project we focused on the<br>role that atmosphere plays in the Hoth<br>destination brand and how it contributes<br>to the visitor<br>experience we found that the atmosphere<br>in and around Hoth has a significant and<br>multifaceted impact on visitors<br>experiences the weather built and<br>natural landscape play an enormous role<br>in setting the scene for visitors to<br>connect with the place and with the<br>brontes<br>the weing atmosphere provides access and<br>a sense of genuine connection to the<br>authors their work history and lives<br>resulting in a moving and embodied<br>tourist experience indeed the more wiy<br>and windy the weather was the better the<br>experience as one respondent remarked<br>top withens and the surrounding<br>landscape is so atmospheric we did the<br>walk on a sunny spring day but I bet<br>it's better in the<br>dark I bet you it's better on a dark<br>gloomy breezy day to get the full weing<br>Heights<br>experience another tourism experience<br>also heavily reliant on the weather to<br>ensure satisfactory use of the deck<br>chairs beside the pool is Cruise<br>tourism okay that was a terrible segue<br>but we are here<br>now the final major research strand that<br>I would like to talk to you about<br>tonight is my research on Cruise<br>tourism yes it is a hard life being an<br>academic the work I have put into<br>funding applications to get me on those<br>cruise ships fortunately has paid<br>off in 2008 58 cruise ships visited Port<br>Charmers and denan just 10 years later<br>this number had doubled bringing in over<br>238,000 passengers into denan in the<br>2018<br>season I was drawn to This research not<br>only through an interest of travel but<br>also it provided me the<br>opportunity to work with Dr James<br>Henry James was a seasoned Cruiser and<br>the City of dened was pretty desperate<br>to understand how they could manage this<br>growing<br>sector for those of you who knew James<br>you'll remember his vast and Industry<br>and Community connections and his<br>passion for people and a<br>chat so he of course became involved in<br>advising tourism Den Eden the the<br>regional tourism organization on the<br>growing Cruise tourism<br>industry James knew my interest in<br>tourism research and asked me to join<br>him what followed was a 15-year<br>involvement in the New Zealand Cruise<br>tourism<br>industry This research involved the<br>difficult task of undertaking a few<br>Cruisers ourselves to uncover the insitu<br>firsthand Cruise tourist experience<br>previously there was very little<br>understood in the academic literature or<br>within the industry on passenger<br>expectations of a sure experience most<br>Cruise literature had focused on<br>experiences passengers have on boarders<br>ship and the motivations for taking a<br>cruise literature had not focused on the<br>experience of being off the<br>ship but unsurprisingly the increasing<br>number of destinations in New Zealand<br>land that were being visited by ships<br>wanted to understand the product and<br>experience demand from these types of<br>tourists James and I were founding<br>members of The denan Cruise network<br>group made up of the of major tourism<br>operators across the atago area and I<br>remain a member of the group and lead<br>the development and dissemination of<br>research on the behavior of cruise<br>passengers This research has led to<br>tangible changes to the welcome received<br>by<br>passengers especially at PTO tago and<br>the understanding of the types of<br>experiences and products at this Market<br>would like to<br>access this was the welcome received<br>when passengers disembarked their ship<br>in Port Charmers in<br>2007 the information could be accessed<br>around Den Eden and Port Charmers was at<br>this small desk note the didy do an<br>a year later we had helped set up an<br>information site container which was on<br>port side for when visitors arrived so<br>small<br>steps and now we have wayfinding and an<br>entire warm and enclosed shed with Wi-Fi<br>where passengers can mingle with<br>volunteers and receive firstand insight<br>and information about their visit as<br>well as view collateral and available<br>for a number of attractions and<br>activities I have published on various<br>aspects of cruise tourism although not<br>sorry although all have been related to<br>the shore experience including<br>investigating the role that the crew<br>play and Advising passengers what to do<br>when they go ashore the barriers<br>passengers experience for visiting a<br>Port of Call and the decisionmaking<br>process that the passenger undergoes in<br>deciding upon shore excursions<br>but what I am most proud of is the work<br>that James and I have done with Cruz New<br>Zealand PTO tago and denen city council<br>and the opportunity to see real change<br>in the product offering and experience<br>passenger I am working on developing<br>This research stream further by<br>incorporating my interest in Resident<br>attitudes and tourism development and<br>I'm currently analyzing survey data<br>collected from across the m<br>to understand resident views of cruise<br>tourism urged by a strong return last<br>season of the cruise<br>industry and with that the enormous<br>negative sentiment expressed in the New<br>Zealand media the media messages<br>questioned the value of cruise tourism<br>the demand for cruise tourism in<br>communities and whether they deserve a<br>welcome at all and of course the notion<br>of cruise ships being super coid<br>spreaders preliminary analysis of the<br>data shows some positive perceptions<br>around job opportunity and increased<br>income for local people but common<br>concerns expressed were around crowding<br>competition for amenities and Facilities<br>pollution and<br>rubbish respondents were asked to rank<br>Cruise tourism compared to 10 other<br>forms of Tourism such as cultural<br>tourism business tourism visiting<br>friends and and relatives and sports<br>tourism and cruise tourism on average<br>ranked the lowest and least<br>preferred there is a lot of Mahi in the<br>industry needed around internal<br>marketing strategy and um<br>messages cruise New Zealand and Regional<br>tourism organizations need to work<br>together on developing messages which<br>positively frame the industry and<br>address or answer the concerns that host<br>communities have and then convince the<br>media to pick up and publish good news<br>stories but this is still working in<br>progress for another time and day and<br>not another<br>IPL and that was a Whistle Stop tour of<br>three major research streams that I have<br>been involved in over the past 20 years<br>and it's been awesome and I know that<br>there is a lot more to<br>come so Not only was the move back from<br>Scotland the right thing to do for my<br>career but it also proved pretty good<br>for the personal life sharing too much<br>information right<br>now but I had returned from Scotland a<br>single woman and what turned out to be a<br>man<br>drought all you heard on the radio in<br>New Zealand at that time was a woman in<br>their 30s is more likely to get run over<br>by a bus than they are to meet a man<br>that they will<br>marry I was about to break the news to<br>my dad that he could spend the wedding<br>fund that he had been saving up for many<br>years when my wonderful friends Mike and<br>Karen stepped in Mike swiftly set me up<br>on a blind date and the rest is family<br>story in the<br>making a big shout out to my very good<br>friend Karen who's been there with me<br>and for me all the<br>way and Mike for finding me a<br>husband so speaking of whom my<br>Foo Nick I would not be standing here if<br>it wasn't for you your support<br>encouragement and wise words oh and your<br>patience perseverance and indeed calm<br>loving<br>personality thank you

Human<br>full of life and love and who only saw<br>the good and the best in people he would<br>have been here today and he would have<br>been the first to have been making the<br>after dinner<br>speech my mother Judy for instilling in<br>me determination resilience and just get<br>on with her attitude for the love and<br>support you have always given to my<br>children they love Lov enna very much my<br>brother Matthew uh who was my rock and<br>my best friend uh we were two P's in a<br>pod uh and Matt did die of cancer in the<br>last year of my<br>PhD and my dad Michael who was the<br>president of my fan club it wasn't a<br>large Gathering um he was often there on<br>his own uh it was my dad who said that I<br>could do a PhD many years ago sorry and<br>when I returned to denan uh to do the<br>work as an<br>RA um oh sorry he encouraged me to do<br>the PHD now one of the last<br>conversations that I had with my dad um<br>was in 2020 and it was around applying<br>for this promotion he told me that it<br>was great and that that I had applied<br>and that I only had myself to thank I<br>told him that he was wrong and that I<br>had him to thank for all her support and<br>my dad died suddenly a couple of weeks<br>after that<br>conversation<br>me to put that up<br>earlier there you all are take it<br>in finally I would like to end with a<br>reflection on our role as<br>academics we are in a privileged<br>position where we have an opportunity to<br>change lives to change the perception<br>someone has of<br>themsel we can make a difference to the<br>life lives of the students who choose to<br>study here at the University of<br>atago we have the chance to give them<br>confidence and courage to go on and make<br>their Mark and take their place in this<br>ever changing world I know that because<br>it happened to<br>me Heather Murray Rob<br>Lawson Helen<br>Nicholson and many of you right here in<br>this room believed in me and made me<br>believe in my myself<br>Nora<br>namu well Marie what a great IPL thank<br>you so much it was really lovely to hear<br>your personal journey and your research<br>and the way that you wo them together<br>and particularly to hear that you like<br>many of us here didn't really initially<br>planed to go into Academia and that your<br>journey has been slightly Securus on the<br>way to get here but it was<br>fantastic I think the toughing it out<br>and get on with it at itude is something<br>that we all appreciate about you and and<br>it stick with you and it's obviously<br>being passed on to your children so<br>that's great um and I think the other<br>thing that came out was the importance<br>of what we do and the ability to enable<br>and Empower our students to be who they<br>can be in the future so thank you for<br>that and your research well obviously<br>you've published a lot but actually what<br>came out from your talk was the impact<br>that your research has had whether that<br>be in developing the national tourism<br>framework in<br>Scotland your role in developing the<br>social distance scale and how that's<br>affected marketing practices across the<br>world your work on<br>museums the role that curators have and<br>the factors that affect visitor<br>experiences that in itself would be<br>enough wouldn't it for a Professor um<br>but also then your role and your<br>research into the cruise ships and the<br>changes that you've<br>made in the experience for cruise<br>passengers coming to<br>denen and I think in a in a in a<br>university that we're um interacting<br>with our community and working closely<br>with them your work in with Cruz New<br>Zealand with the<br>DCC um and PTO tago is really something<br>that we should all aspire to so thank<br>you perhaps what's has touched me most<br>is your passion your warmth your humor<br>and the enthusiasm that have that you<br>have that really Shone through I can now<br>understand why your students love you<br>and why iard you made an effort to come<br>down from Thailand so<br>um yeah that really came through and I<br>think it reflects how your colleagues<br>view you both your colleag colleagues in<br>Commerce and those on the senior<br>leadership team so Marie we're really<br>grateful we're very fortunate and we<br>love having you in tago so thank you and<br>I have a small gift<br>here that you might know what it<br>is so once again please thank<br>you<br>and the only thing I have now to do is<br>to thank you all for coming and to<br>invite you all to come over to the staff<br>club for Refreshments where you can talk<br>with Marie and tell her how wonderful<br>she you think she is too so thank you<br>all and please come over to the staff<br>Club</p></main><footer
