accurate.</p><p>o in a Mana in the Waka tenakoto<br>tenakoto<br>Couture so my name is Nick Smith and I'm<br>the vice Chancellor after hittingawaka<br>Victoria University Wellington it's my<br>great pleasure to open tonight's debate<br>and welcome everybody here<br>the topic is education<br>and I think the role of education and<br>that topic is probably more important<br>for our country I think than it's ever<br>been we're at a time when technology<br>presents both an enormous set of<br>opportunities but also a huge challenge<br>in terms of how we digest and process<br>information and also the potential<br>inequalities that can be inadvertently a<br>result of that opportunity<br>we're at a time when our capacity to<br>balance the needs of today with the<br>needs of the future is increasingly ever<br>more acute<br>so perhaps most alarmingly from my<br>perspective we're also at a time when we<br>can struggle to have conversations about<br>issues<br>that don't result in often a very vocal<br>minority retreating to the polarized<br>extremes each claiming they're under<br>high moral ground<br>and it's for this reason that I think<br>it's really important that we have<br>events like this where we can bring<br>evidence and scrutiny to the discussion<br>and issues that our political leaders<br>are going to be grappling with for the<br>this University Victoria University of<br>Wellington to head angle Waka has a<br>really special role to play in that<br>exercise<br>as a university based in the capital<br>city with a long track record of leading<br>and hosting discussions on important<br>topics that will Define all our futures<br>we see this as our responsibility and<br>we're very proud to host these<br>discussions<br>but the key thing about any discussion<br>is that it's an exchange it's a debate<br>it's a challenge and it's for this<br>reason I want to thank all of our<br>audience tonight for not only tuning up<br>but in advance for energizing this event<br>important to that energy is going to be<br>your participation through our online<br>polling and I hope you've already got<br>your devices out and set up and also<br>that they're on silent you'll see the<br>screen link to their minty meter website<br>uh and the first question that we want<br>people to answer which I can already see<br>is going to be defining the University<br>strategy for 2024 and Beyond<br>but we're going to use that as questions<br>throughout the event and a number of<br>these questions are also going to be put<br>to our candidates so listen to the<br>prompts during the debate from our<br>moderator and the results will be<br>displayed on the screens around you<br>but just as importantly I also wanted to<br>thank our candidates for taking part in<br>tonight's debate it's I had these in<br>alphabetical apolitical order<br>but we've had some light substitutions<br>and so now they're just in random order<br>but I'm going to start with Angela<br>Roberts from the labor party<br>Minister tinnetti was not able to come<br>tonight but we have Angela who I've<br>described as a Renaissance politician a<br>secondary school teacher who has taught<br>everything from economics to drama we<br>have Chris Bailey from Acts who's had a<br>career that seems longer than I've been<br>alive he was a police officer for 14<br>years<br>and then trained as an English and music<br>teacher before 22 years teaching student<br>students with special learning needs<br>we have Tiano turinara from the greens<br>spokesman for education and Maori<br>development among other areas and in<br>Pacifica communities<br>Tiano is known for his work in the<br>education sector and climate change<br>advocacy<br>we have Penny Simmons from the National<br>Party<br>he was a former Chief Executive at the<br>southern Institute of Technology and is<br>widely credited with turning that<br>tertiary institution around such that it<br>was one of the exemplars in that space<br>and last but by no means least we have<br>someone who'll be known to many here in<br>the city of Wellington Andy Foster<br>former mayor of this country of this<br>city country that sounds good it's good<br>it's like not mayor of the country yet<br>that'd be very super City and uh<br>Wellington City councilor<br>unfortunately Natalia Albert from the<br>opportunities party is unwell and not<br>able to join us tonight but finally I'd<br>like to introduce our moderator for the<br>debate the man who is going to coalesce<br>ideas cajole our candidates<br>cut off people when they're going on for<br>too long but bring a sense of purpose<br>and that energy Mark Jennings he's the<br>co-editor of Newsroom and one of New<br>Zealand's most respected journalists<br>smart has worked in news since the 1970s<br>both here and in Australia he co-founded<br>co-funded co-founded Newsroom with Tim<br>Murphy and we're very grateful that you<br>can join us tonight as the debate<br>moderator can I have a round of applause<br>for both our candidates and for our<br>moderator<br>just<br>curricato everyone<br>um thank you very much nick uh and thank<br>you to Victoria uh for supporting<br>Newsroom you've been in it from the<br>start and we really appreciate that<br>um I think Chris and myself are fighting<br>to be the oldest person on the stage but<br>um<br>right so tonight<br>um we have<br>we're going to have a lively debate and<br>we're not going to stop interjections<br>because they are part and parcel of a<br>good debate but I have told all the<br>candidates that if anybody interjects<br>too much I'll be subtracting a little<br>bit of time from them at the end so<br>there will be a little bit of a price to<br>pay<br>some public service announcements first<br>um<br>many of you will be familiar with these<br>obviously if the fire alarm sounds then<br>we need to evacuate the building to the<br>nearest exit and gather on the Tim<br>beagle hole Courtyard<br>um if there's an earthquake and this is<br>something we don't have in Auckland so<br>this is new to me and we need to drop to<br>the ground get undercover and hold until<br>the shaking stops<br>and if there is an emergency uh please<br>follow the guidance of the University<br>staff<br>now we are live streaming this tonight<br>and so we welcome uh all the viewers<br>that are on the live stream<br>and as I said earlier we're not going to<br>be too strict but we are going to time<br>the opening addresses and we're keeping<br>those to one minutes<br>so I'm going to start by asking each of<br>the candidates to make an opening<br>statement it's one minute long in the<br>the topic if you like is what does it<br>take to make a great education system<br>and we're starting with anti-foster oh<br>well that's the first time I'd actually<br>hear the topic so thank you thank you<br>all for coming out uh tonight I'm not<br>actually going to follow that particular<br>topic I got about two hours head start<br>on this particular one and so I<br>apologize on behalf of Taylor arneel who<br>was supposed to be here to to be<br>speaking for this<br>um just by way background um this is the<br>University I went through I did both my<br>degrees here and also the pleasure of<br>teaching but it was a long time ago uh<br>he's not as old as he looks uh with<br>Chris at nalen college for a couple of<br>years before um a labor government then<br>persuaded me that I should get involved<br>in politics because I didn't entirely<br>like the way that they were doing things<br>that was Roger Douglas and David<br>longinko and it's a labor government<br>that's persuaded me again to get back<br>involved in politics which wasn't really<br>my intention and it's because there are<br>so many issues which we face in the<br>country at the moment things which are<br>not going in the right direction whether<br>it's education which of course we'll<br>spend most of tonight on uh whether it's<br>the health system Law and Order and our<br>economy and we're very much focused on<br>trying to get our economy right I think<br>one other message really is I think<br>there's going to be a change in<br>government it's just a matter of what<br>that new government looks like and we<br>will be very happy be working with<br>national and act to provide some balance<br>in the room and that's really what we<br>are standing for to try and change the<br>country try and fix some of the things<br>that are broken and that to give us the<br>country that we really need so thanks<br>all for turning out and thanks for<br>sharing your care<br>uh thank you Andy uh next we have Angela<br>and Angela a bit good if you were able<br>to stick to the topic and tell us what<br>does make it great oh I don't know what<br>stuff it was until then I said it okay<br>but none of us did<br>um great question and I think one thing<br>that we've learned from covert is what<br>covert did is highlighted the challenges<br>in the system and what does make it<br>great and quite simply we need adequate<br>resourcing in the right places we need<br>evidence-informed policy and we need to<br>be really clear that we are striving for<br>um or in collaboration and we need to be<br>striving for<br>removing the inequality of access to<br>making sure that our teachers are really<br>well trained and have great professional<br>development and collaborative<br>opportunities and we need to make it<br>affordable and accessible and it needs<br>to needs more in order to keep us at the<br>best as the best public education system<br>um thank you Angela<br>um next we're going to have Chris<br>thanks thanks Mike and it's great to see<br>so many people here 40 years ago I was<br>in my second year at University and uh<br>right well not right here because this<br>building wasn't there yet I wasn't<br>um and uh three years ago I was teaching<br>in a school and the reason I'm pretty<br>much sitting up here now is because I<br>wasn't uh wasn't happy with the way the<br>education of all of New Zealand was was<br>going I think we need to there's so much<br>so many issues at the moment I won't<br>list them now I'm sure we'll be covering<br>them over over the uh over the next hour<br>but we we need uh the way ax sees it and<br>the way I see it we need choice we need<br>to be able to to get buy-in from from<br>the kids from uh from staff from from<br>teachers teaching is the best job in the<br>world and it should be but so many<br>teachers I've spoken to recently in the<br>last couple of years are just unhappy<br>they just go to work and they just do<br>the job they they don't haven't got the<br>spark that that a good teacher really<br>needs to uh to improve the lives of<br>those kids so so a good a uh a good<br>future certainly we need a happy<br>Workforce<br>um and kids that want to go to school<br>thank you Chris penny thank you curatato<br>and thank you for the opportunity to be<br>here this election is all about the<br>economy our wonderful little country is<br>in 100 million dollars worth of debt<br>that's 11 sorry 100 billion dollars<br>worth of debt that's 11 billion dollars<br>that has to be spent each year servicing<br>that debt and you might say well what's<br>the impact on education that 11 billion<br>dollars of servicing annually is the<br>same amount that we spend in total on<br>our primary and our secondary schools so<br>it shows you the opportunity cost of<br>having that level of debt it also<br>impacts on our tertiary institutions<br>just as it impacts on each one of us the<br>cost of running a tertiary institution<br>is much higher now because of the rate<br>of inflation so the economy absolutely<br>impacts on what sort of tertiary<br>education sector that we are going to<br>have and so it's been heartbreaking for<br>me to watch the waste of money the<br>wasteful spending that has occurred<br>having run a tertiary Institution for 23<br>years being so careful with expenditure<br>to see wasteful money that should have<br>been spent on Frontline education is one<br>of the reasons I'm here tonight<br>um thank you Penny uh but look judging<br>from what the audience have voted I<br>would say that probably Angela's Vision<br>uh is is leading the way there<br>um<br>sorry it's me out here on the left<br>um there's always a gag about where we<br>make the lone endangeredu in the<br>wilderness<br>I'm going to give you extra time for<br>that<br>um yeah oh well um sure everyone<br>um uh first of all I'm not Timothy Paul<br>so well done if you got that number two<br>I'm not her dad<br>number three uh my child is my oldest<br>child who was about who is about the<br>same age as Tabitha was here during<br>tamatha's student presidency she was an<br>excellent student president of this fine<br>University and she will be a great<br>Member of Parliament for Wellington<br>Central so two tips for Tabitha<br>I also I'd like to do a big shout out to<br>all the student associations that put<br>into this people's inquiry into student<br>well-being what it showed to us and the<br>greens that our tertiary institutions<br>they needed to be they need to be funded<br>as a public good that's what they need<br>to be done<br>you're done we also need to deal with<br>student poverty because what we found in<br>this in this inquiry was that two-thirds<br>of students experience poverty and<br>hardship and that's why this election uh<br>the greens are pushing for an income<br>guarantee so a student allowance of at<br>least 385 dollars because when you're<br>broke and hungry you don't study well or<br>we also need to have rental controls<br>because that is a massive issue for<br>students as well because when we full<br>our tissue institutions with students<br>that's what makes these places vibrant<br>neural liberalism is a big failure we<br>thank you Tiano<br>um<br>so just going back to that question<br>that's sitting on your screens there<br>engaged citizens the ability to<br>understand communicate and collaborate<br>across diverse Society it's interesting<br>that that's come out on top the one I<br>picked has come out fifth<br>um it was innovators with the ability to<br>harness opportunities in emerging<br>Technologies<br>so that's um already uh I've only I've<br>made the first mistake and now I've made<br>the second mistake<br>um right<br>the fun the topic of funding came up and<br>I want to examine that first I I think<br>it is the really big topic that's<br>sitting here everybody basically has has<br>alluded to it<br>so if we<br>um if we look at what the current<br>situation is the universities have<br>argued that the funding model has forced<br>them to compete for students<br>spending up a large on marketing you<br>know radio television even the back of<br>buses so do do you agree that the<br>funding model has forced our<br>universities to compete I'm going to ask<br>both Angela and Penny this question<br>yeah I think um when you've seen this<br>government has committed not just to a<br>sort of a CPI increase but some<br>additional funding to help you to cling<br>on while there is a review because it is<br>I understand that<br>um but we need to review the model when<br>we've had a complete Reliance<br>haphazardly on oh we need more money so<br>let's just bring in more International<br>students we love our International<br>students but it needs to be deliberate<br>it needs to be thoughtful and we need to<br>make sure that the funding model is<br>appropriate and I don't think the<br>government should be stepping away from<br>its obligation to providing this massive<br>public good that is educating our<br>population and tertiary settings<br>so I think we've got a huge opportunity<br>to make sure that that funding review<br>reveals the problems and makes a<br>significant uh<br>structural is ambitious and makes<br>structural changes it's not just about<br>topping up it's not because like you say<br>topping up isn't enough it isn't just<br>about going oh well we'll just pick a<br>number of international students out of<br>the year and add that income we need to<br>be very clear about how we structure the<br>funding and and we've been government<br>and so you've been in government six<br>years<br>okay well let's just let's just hear<br>Angela uh first as to why her<br>government's done nothing in six years<br>and but I was in before this gig I was<br>in the education sector and I know the<br>impact that covert had on teachers on<br>students on institutions it was huge and<br>I know that shadow of covert still is in<br>the system today and I'm not saying oh<br>well we didn't do anything for six years<br>because but we had structural changes to<br>make across the system we have reformed<br>vocational education much to Penny's<br>delight<br>and and because we see the vision of a<br>national coherent vocational system and<br>we've looked at ECE we've had some<br>significant shifts in uh in our<br>schooling models around NCA and the<br>curriculum and it has been slowed down<br>it is not fast enough you're right but<br>and we've got more work to do but we're<br>so as someone who was dealing with the<br>amount of funding we had for the last 23<br>years I would love to be in a position<br>to say we can put lots more funding into<br>tertiary education but the reality is<br>that we have a hundred billion dollars<br>worth of debt and we have 11 billion<br>dollars that will go out of this country<br>okay we've heard that before penny<br>let's talk<br>so I think if you want to talk about the<br>tax cuts we do think that when people<br>are in a cost to living crisis they do<br>deserve to keep more of their own money<br>it's their money and they deserve to<br>keep more of that so the funding uh look<br>we have to face the reality that we're<br>not going to have a lot of money to put<br>into things but what we can do is shift<br>money from back office to front and so<br>we have seen 1200 1200 more bureaucrats<br>in the Ministry of Education we have<br>seen more bureaucrats in the tertiary<br>education commission and we need to be<br>moving that money to the front line of<br>our universities and our polydics we saw<br>200 million dollars spent on<br>amalgamating the polytechnics to make<br>them worse so there has been money spent<br>education money spent that should have<br>gone to the front line<br>thank you Penny um Chris do you believe<br>the university should be competing for<br>students I think that the our<br>um the funding needs our reform which is<br>which will be really great once that<br>review comes through but penny is<br>actually absolutely right<br>um the the we're in such a Dire Straits<br>in our whole economy that we just can't<br>afford uh just the the money tree that<br>the greens talk about doesn't exist it<br>doesn't and we need and we need just by<br>taxing just by taxing wealthy people<br>will not cover everything that they want<br>to that they want to cover so we really<br>it certainly needs a reform and and uh<br>and make it fairer absolutely<br>okay thank you thank you uh Tiano uh<br>your response to that I'll get a<br>response to a couple of things yeah uh<br>first of all we are the only country in<br>the oecd which doesn't have a capital<br>gains tax a wealth tax or stamp tutor a<br>combination of all three so the richest<br>uh 311 families in this country have the<br>accumulative wealth of 85 billion<br>dollars that is more than the poorest<br>2.5 million people in this country it is<br>more than timely for a wealth tax the<br>day the day this country<br>yeah and we can have all these things if<br>we have a fair attack system and I just<br>wanted to uh I wanted to respond to some<br>of the earlier questions and I want to<br>acknowledge the work of the tushy uh the<br>tertiary education Union here the<br>Students Association who put the<br>pressure on the government to give that<br>extra 128 billion dollars but noted that<br>that wasn't new money it was old money<br>so we need to make sure that we fund our<br>tissue institutions as a public good and<br>we can do that by supporting our<br>students by having an having an income<br>guarantee so they're not broken hungry<br>because who wants to come to a tertiary<br>institution if you're going to be broken<br>hungry anybody that's been poor<br>will tell you being poor sucks<br>okay we<br>can have a debate on poverty as well but<br>I think we need to just come back a<br>little bit to education Andy do you<br>think the needs do you support a funding<br>review<br>yeah look I think the model's clearly<br>broken and I think the point that's been<br>made that during covert the model broke<br>um and what you saw there is a lot of<br>people domestic students decided that<br>actually it was better with you know low<br>unemployment or whatever they needed to<br>do<br>I was to go and get a job and so you<br>lost a lot of students there and of<br>course that's students off the bottom<br>line if you like for a model which<br>relies on bums on seats and then of<br>course the international students who<br>couldn't come and so we saw that that<br>international student income also for<br>universities uh whittling away so that's<br>at the core of the problem and there are<br>three universities I think this is one<br>of those three universities which<br>particularly suffered from that so that<br>model doesn't work does the model of<br>competition between our universities<br>work no it's not a particularly smart<br>thing to be spending public money and<br>these are people who by and large they<br>want to study at a university<br>why are we marketing to those people<br>they're going to come to one of the<br>universities in New Zealand from a news<br>from a government point of view it<br>doesn't matter which one<br>so why are we spending money competing<br>against ourselves and we see that in a<br>lot of places around New Zealand where<br>we compete against ourselves rather than<br>actually we need to grow the pie and so<br>if we're going to give more money to<br>everybody the thing we actually have to<br>do is to grow the pie and sometimes some<br>of the initiatives that we were being<br>talked about here won't grow the pie<br>they might even shrink the pie and<br>that's what we can't afford to do so<br>economic so economic economic growth is<br>absolutely an essential part of this but<br>the funding model for universities we<br>think needs review because we think it<br>is not working and the other part of<br>that funding model too of course is we<br>need to make sure we support the areas<br>of Excellence so one of the things Nick<br>I look at this and I know you're doing<br>some really hard work here but they um<br>you know the effect for example in the<br>school of music is pretty devastating<br>and I know it's not the only part of the<br>of the institution here those areas of<br>Excellence which we can't really afford<br>to lose and the other part is the<br>research area which you also need to<br>support so I think an overall strategic<br>approach to tertiary education<br>University funding is really really<br>important I'm not sure we've got that<br>right at the moment and thank you so I<br>want to do a quick fire rounds so it's a<br>yes or no answer mainly<br>um<br>New Zealand has eight universities<br>is this too many for a country of five<br>million people yes or no starting with<br>you Andy probably<br>Chris<br>uh top of my head I would say no it's<br>it's worked well up until yeah<br>no it's about the same as Australia has<br>and ratios of population Angela<br>yeah it seems about right they've got to<br>be coherent though about what they<br>deliver Nationwide strategies<br>no okay agreement on that pretty much<br>okay I want to go to the next topic<br>about and tiano's already spoken at<br>length about this but I want to look at<br>student costs because<br>we do it I think everybody in this room<br>acknowledges that it is pretty hard for<br>students at the moment and I wanted to<br>use the example of Lily she's she's 25<br>years old and she's been working for the<br>past few years and wants to go back to<br>University in 2024 to do her master's<br>degree<br>she doesn't qualify for student<br>allowance and the maximum she can borrow<br>and I stress the word borrow for living<br>costs under the student loan scheme is<br>302 dollars<br>a week now that's barely I'm told Billy<br>enough to cover a one bedroom in a cold<br>Arrow Valley flat<br>sounds bad<br>um<br>so Angela<br>if we want students like Libby to come<br>back to University<br>is the financial support available<br>obviously the student allowance issue is<br>significant but there are uh there's<br>more than one way to help support<br>students and we've done that by<br>committing to<br>check a public transport to raising I<br>know that's a terrible thing and how<br>much you can borrow<br>the training incentive allowance some of<br>your fees being free<br>requiring warmer dry homes from<br>landlords building 12 000 public houses<br>means that we've got a slight<br>Improvement in housing Supply so<br>hopefully things will become more<br>affordable with regards to rent<br>we've raised the minimum wage by seven<br>dollars since we've been in government<br>and we have committed to increasing that<br>to a living wage and we have also<br>committed to removing the um the youth<br>rates so when you do go out and work you<br>are getting paid fairly so it is a<br>combination of things I think absolutely<br>student allowances I think we need to do<br>more work on how to make that possible<br>not just student debt but student<br>allowances I think we do need to keep<br>working hard on making that possible but<br>that's alongside all of those other<br>things there's no point in having a<br>student allowance if your rent's 400 and<br>you are sick because of the place that<br>you have to live in so I think we have<br>to attend to all of those needs it's<br>important thank you Tiano the greens are<br>as you alluded to promising students at<br>Universal payment of 385 a week<br>how did you arrive at that figure<br>uh well we we've got a whole Suite of<br>Suite of policies and if you go onto<br>greens.org.nz you could check them all<br>out but on top of our income guarantee<br>we're also pushing for uh we've got a<br>pledge for renters as well because<br>rental controls will help to get that<br>issue under<br>people have to get that wassue sorted<br>because when we put out that pledge to<br>our pledge to renters people sent in<br>photos of some of their rental<br>properties I saw one where someone had a<br>mushroom growing in the middle of their<br>room windows all of this all of this<br>sort of stuff we have normalized student<br>poverty in this country and it is not<br>acceptable it is not acceptable that<br>people should be living in poverty and<br>hardship like that that's why we need to<br>have control okay<br>um so the wealth tax wealth tax com uh<br>component um it's around about we've<br>also got other measures from there about<br>increasing the corporate tax rate uh<br>from 28 back to 33 percent as well which<br>which is where it was before the global<br>financial crisis as well also a bit<br>there on the trust tax just in case<br>people try to move their assets around<br>um and if you if you go to our site<br>we've actually got a tax calculator<br>where you can Chuck your details in and<br>see how much of it impacts you but we<br>are targeting the mega wealthy in this<br>country<br>penny<br>yeah can I just say targeting the mega<br>wealthy the latest country that put in a<br>wealth tax Norway put one in at 1.1<br>percent Which is less than half what the<br>greens want to put in they had such an<br>outflow of money and people their tax<br>take is now lower<br>Switzerland which has got a difference<br>don't think that that's going to be the<br>the<br>um Silver Bullet so look Penny can I<br>just ask you a question here that um<br>National says it wants international<br>students coming here and paying higher<br>fees to keep costs down for domestic<br>students<br>but haven't the University's got big<br>deficits and and this is not a reliable<br>income stream is it well I think<br>International students are important for<br>a range of reasons yes they bring in uh<br>Financial benefit but they also are<br>significant in terms of our own domestic<br>students being able to build those<br>relationships with people from other<br>countries our tertiary students are<br>going into a global Workforce they need<br>to understand different ethnicities<br>different backgrounds and for uh later<br>it's really important for us to have<br>those relationships of people in other<br>countries that know New Zealand<br>intimately and think well of New Zealand<br>so they're really important not just for<br>the financial contribution they also<br>bring a lot into our communities in<br>terms of part-time employment going into<br>areas of school shortage tourism<br>Hospitality caring so but you can't rely<br>on them to solve a funding<br>okay well they have they have been part<br>of the financial contribution to our<br>tertiary sector for many years now<br>probably over two decades and I think<br>they will continue to be that's probably<br>the same for most oecd countries so if<br>we are trying to make up the difference<br>of international students then that will<br>be a huge amount of money that would<br>have to be invested from the government<br>until I think around the covert but um<br>okay so Chris do you support penny in<br>this view that International students<br>can make up the the deficit I think it<br>certainly helps and and certainly not<br>just for uh for for universities either<br>for secondary schools I know have had a<br>marked<br>effect on on how they run as well I<br>think it's just um I mean being a<br>student is tough and and it always has<br>been and it shouldn't be as tough as it<br>is but it always has been<br>um just person my my personal experience<br>I I worked for two years out of school<br>and then saved enough money to come here<br>to this University and carried on<br>working working part-time jobs but uh<br>you know I mean yellow all you want but<br>this is just that this is just the truth<br>and and the the false economy that that<br>the the the the greens and labor talk<br>about they talk about raise the minimum<br>wage the minimum wage up went up 44 in<br>five years while productivity while<br>productivity went up seven percent<br>put food on people's I hope people do<br>economics 44 increase and seven percent<br>productivity that's just unsustainable<br>for businesses we must we must have have<br>the businesses doing well everyone's uh<br>um making a profit now that's a duty<br>word dirty word counter I know making a<br>profit so that they can they can pay<br>staff more and improve conditions<br>otherwise they won't that that's another<br>myth but that obviously um that is<br>perpetuating but we need a strong<br>growing economy if we're going to make<br>it better for students it's not okay<br>thank you Chris<br>um and the New Zealand first as a party<br>of old people what are they going to do<br>what are they going to do to help<br>students yeah I was going to say except<br>for me<br>um now Taylor who was going to be here I<br>think is in his uh early 20s so um he's<br>our candidate for welcome Central so I<br>don't think that's entirely accurate<br>Mark<br>um so what's the question we need after<br>the inside what are you doing what are<br>you going to do to help students with<br>the customer yeah look we think um the<br>it's important to have a student<br>allowance universal student allowance<br>and it shouldn't also I know your<br>examples over over 25 but under 25 that<br>shouldn't be linked to your parents<br>income uh particularly you know it<br>starts disappearing around what seventy<br>thousand dollars or something like that<br>we think and for a lot of people you<br>might not actually want to live with<br>your parents at that stage um and so<br>it's unfair to penalize people for that<br>either so so we think a universal<br>student allowance is important the other<br>thing we think is important in terms of<br>student loans is supporting the payback<br>of those student loans because what we<br>want is if we invest in people<br>we want those people to be investing<br>back in our country now it's really good<br>to be able to go overseas spend a bit of<br>time there would kind of like you back<br>um and and that means how about we help<br>pay off those student loans if you<br>invest that time those skills that<br>you've developed back in New Zealand<br>um why shouldn't we help you to pay off<br>those student loans so those are the two<br>big aspirations we've got there but I<br>would just make one other comment around<br>our economic performance because that's<br>sort of come up and different people's<br>got completely different views of it we<br>had the worst current account deficit in<br>the oecd in the last year the worst and<br>it wasn't close we were a long way<br>behind and that is effectively we are<br>borrowing our living standards of<br>somebody else who at the moment is<br>willing to lend to us and they charge<br>interest for that and anybody who has<br>got a debt with it doesn't matter<br>whether it's a mortgage or whatever will<br>know if you didn't have that you didn't<br>have to pay that interest you kind of<br>feel like you had a lot more money in<br>your back pocket but when you do have to<br>pay that and as I think Penny said you<br>know if we're paying as much in interest<br>as we are spending on the primary and<br>secondary sector uh primary and<br>secondary education sector it'd be<br>really nice if we weren't doing that so<br>we've got to fix those things if we have<br>a good economy we're much more likely to<br>be able to<br>um to afford all the quality Public<br>Services we want that includes education<br>includes Health all of those things but<br>we must have the economy working too<br>okay thank you Andy I want to have<br>another round quick fire round please<br>um the first Year's fees free policy yes<br>or no Andy<br>continuing yeah we we are<br>um we're not convinced that it is<br>effective and if we're going to do<br>anything though the other thing I would<br>say is that it's probably more likely to<br>be beneficial to be the third year<br>rather than the first year<br>thank you Chris uh we're a no we don't<br>think the fees free targeted has worked<br>for their very people that it was meant<br>designed for and we think the money<br>could be better spent elsewhere<br>yes we just think the cost of living<br>crisis is such that it's just not the<br>right time to be changing that<br>Angela yes absolutely this isn't about<br>who can afford it it's about reducing<br>the burden for a public good<br>and that was around uh the the funding<br>model we were talking about<br>International students yes uh what<br>covert exposed was the fundamental floor<br>in in that model that we treat<br>International students as the cash cow<br>and That Came Crashing Down uh when when<br>the borders closed um and so when Angela<br>does her review that needs to be sorted<br>out or whoever does the review that<br>needs to be sorted out that needs to be<br>factored in we actually need to be<br>supporting uh International students as<br>well because those pressures uh for<br>people when they come come from overseas<br>we need to have mental health services<br>we need to have all of those types of<br>services when people come here and we<br>need to make sure that they come here in<br>a good way and that they are supported<br>in the best way possible thank you I<br>we know that Maori and Pacific are less<br>likely to leave school with University<br>entrance in 2022<br>17.8 percent of Maori and 20.7 of<br>Pacifica students left school without UE<br>that compares to 41.7 and Pacquiao<br>students<br>um the data also shows us that when they<br>go on Maori and Pacifica students go on<br>to tertiary education<br>less of them complete that<br>I'd like to know from you each<br>um<br>what you're going to change to ensure<br>that Pacifica and Maori have an equal<br>chance of competing completing high<br>school and the option of going on to<br>further studies let's start with you<br>Tiana<br>I'm both Maori and Pacifica but it's<br>very personal<br>um<br>no issue issue for me as well we need to<br>have make sure that we have culturally<br>appropriate solutions for our Maori and<br>Pacifica students making sure that there<br>are Services both here in in the<br>universities as well and I remember as a<br>much younger person coming up here and<br>spending some time over at the maraisa<br>making sure that's there as well but<br>we've got to fundamentally<br>form the way that we deal with student<br>poverty so the way that we're doing and<br>doing that it's an income guarantee of<br>385 dollars making sure that we have<br>rental controls because many of our many<br>of our whanau that are renting is 1.4<br>million renters and many of them are<br>Maori and Pacifica so if you can make<br>sure that you take care of the whanau<br>and they're they're in houses that are<br>warm and healthy uh then that will that<br>that makes it easier for them to come to<br>places like this<br>um Angela what are you going to do to<br>get the access rate up so I think<br>there's two big pieces one is<br>um having been in a secondary school<br>teacher for a very long time that<br>intersectionality for our Maori and<br>Pacifica kids and poverty is significant<br>and you know we know from the from the<br>research about how that impacts on their<br>achievement so there's two bits we do<br>need to deal with poverty we need to<br>make sure that wages are good and we can<br>put food on the table and we have warm<br>dry homes and we make it possible for<br>parents to actually spend time at home<br>with their children so they can support<br>their learning and when life's here you<br>don't have a conversation about I don't<br>know philosophy right it's like who's<br>taking your little sister to school and<br>which person's taking a day off work<br>because somebody's sick so we need to we<br>need to tackle that poverty issue and<br>the second bit we do need to make sure<br>that our Maori and Pacifica students see<br>themselves<br>in our schools we have a lot to learn<br>from our wananga from our Kura yui and<br>karakaipapa and we have delivered on<br>things like the governance model for<br>wamanga and better support not enough<br>but more support for Kuda and I think<br>mainstream education still has a lot to<br>learn about how we include talmadi and<br>mataranga Maori in our system so these<br>kids are themselves and can succeed so<br>we feed them we give them a wander at<br>home we look up to be whanau<br>uh so Penny we've heard from the two<br>candidates on the left of you there that<br>it's really a socioeconomic problem<br>that's holding students back Pacific on<br>Maori students do you agree with that I<br>think it's about choice and I think it's<br>a shame things like the charter schools<br>were taken away because they gave Choice<br>with the child schools we've got we need<br>to have ptes we need to have<br>polytechnics we need to have wananga<br>where Maori and Pacifica students might<br>feel more comfortable first and smaller<br>institutions before going and so look we<br>just have to have a range of choice so<br>that there are Pathways that those that<br>want to go straight through into a<br>university can but those who want to<br>take a different pathway through a pte<br>through a Polytechnic through the<br>wananga so it's just having a range of<br>choice<br>Chris the word charter schools came up<br>there something that's close to ax heart<br>no absolutely and um the two two points<br>here<br>um I I quite agree with Angela we need<br>we need to build the economy and she had<br>just just said it we've got to have a<br>strong economy so that we can pay good<br>wages and all of that so I absolutely<br>agree and the other the other thing was<br>the charter partnership schools which<br>were so good for Maori and and Pacifica<br>and it was uh taken away by by the labor<br>government 17. and Angela will say it's<br>because of the civil rights movement in<br>1960 I've heard it a couple of times<br>before but it just means she hasn't been<br>to visit them hasn't seen the absolute<br>the work that these kids are doing is<br>absolutely fantastic and a a good start<br>and a in a uh a situation like that will<br>lead through to to secondary and then<br>um and then through to University these<br>and tertiary study I'm just going to<br>give Andrew a quick write a reply on<br>that did I look a little bit agitated<br>about it I do get very very animated<br>about this I've been um duking it out<br>with David Seymour for a decade and um<br>because a previous role I was a union<br> I think the affectionate term some<br>people use for me um when I was the<br>president of the ppta and some things<br>are really clear there is nothing I ever<br>saw in a charter school that isn't<br>especially it's like except for one<br>thing I will grant and I'll tell you<br>that in a minute especially given the<br>significant additional resourcing that<br>they had now the second thing yeah to<br>set up Capital wouldn't we all love some<br>of that<br>um but the the thing the only difference<br>is that a charter school can make a<br>decision to not choose a student<br>they can send a student away if they<br>don't comply with the high standards of<br>the charter school and they don't have<br>to bother if that kid never ends up in<br>another school the public system quite<br>rightly has an obligation to look after<br>our most vulnerable how often did that<br>happen how often did that happen now<br>never the other thing is I will he is<br>correct I had this conversation with um<br>Sue Ian Taylor the other day when he<br>said about ideology and Charter Schools<br>I said the evidence is clear<br>and we know where Charter Schools<br>started they started in the south of the<br>United States of America and a response<br>to integration this was about people not<br>wanting to have their children in a<br>particular school this was about<br>well he owned one so I had a<br>conversation with that Urban ewe<br>Authority about whether or not they<br>should be backing the Kura down the road<br>or whether they should have another way<br>another think about their resources and<br>what they did do was get involved with<br>your attendance service and back to the<br>akura we need to back our public<br>thank you Angela uh Andy your views on<br>this yeah well the same there are two<br>parts to that question the first part of<br>them is how do you get young people<br>through the school in the first place to<br>get to a place where they're actually<br>able to enter University so that's the<br>third situation and the second part of<br>the question is what do you do to make<br>the university attractive and accessible<br>and I just thought it's worth having<br>reading you some numbers there from the<br>Ministry of Education pilot in 2022 on<br>ncea and poverty absolutely is a really<br>key determinant because all students<br>reading 64 lowest decile 24 percent<br>um in uh in writing 34 percent<br>two percent<br>and in maths 50 56 10 so it's a massive<br>difference and those top those first<br>numbers were the averages the others are<br>the lowest DSL so the massive difference<br>in terms of poverty and where people<br>come from so that we absolutely do need<br>to support people who are in you know in<br>difficult learning environments poverty<br>is clearly a major a major issue for<br>more in Pacifica it's worse than it is<br>for um for the average okay but what are<br>you going to do about it is well we<br>shouldn't go on with the figures but we<br>need to know what you're going to do the<br>point the point there is I'm agreeing<br>with the speakers on the left that that<br>poverty is a real issue which we need to<br>to deal with<br>um how long do you want me to talk about<br>poverty no I want to know what you're<br>doing well so that that is a major issue<br>I think you've spent the wealth tax<br>um you're going to talk about it so so<br>the other part of it is once you get<br>people to University level and one of<br>the things which where you have been<br>always very very keen on is what we call<br>the first and family scheme and that<br>will be if you're if you come from a<br>family which some has not got people<br>who've got into University you haven't<br>had that that model to Aspire to you<br>give people a scholarship you give them<br>the support to be able to get them into<br>University and support them through the<br>university pay the fees to allow them to<br>do that and that helps people who are<br>coming from backgrounds which are<br>usually going to be really challenged<br>backgrounds economically or whatever it<br>might be to get into University and<br>better get through University and the<br>final point I wanted to make is it's not<br>just those um<br>those pupils who come from poverty<br>situations but it's also I think our NCA<br>system doesn't work for a lot of people<br>who have particular learning needs and<br>that's something which I think we do<br>need to support and we need more people<br>wrapped around more support wrapped<br>around those people I'm thinking of you<br>know for example autism I'm thinking of<br>those kind of situations where the<br>learning model the tuition model the<br>testing model and you've got to pass<br>those tests to get into University<br>doesn't work and that they might be<br>really bright bright young people but<br>they can't get those through those tests<br>because they don't work for them<br>thank you Andy I want to just go to<br>another quick fire question here it's a<br>it's an easy one should Toral Maori be<br>compulsory in school starting with you<br>Andy<br>no but we should certainly be<br>encouraging it very very strongly we<br>certainly need to be training more<br>teachers to be we need to be training<br>more teachers so that more there is more<br>available so it's a very very important<br>part of the educational curriculum<br>Chris yeah we agree<br>no but it should be up to an individual<br>principal School Board to decide that<br>no same reason it should be up to<br>individual schools<br>Angela<br>encourage support have the teaching<br>Workforce really ready to go and then<br>but if I can just quickly respond<br>because it kind of drifted off the last<br>one we were focusing on Maori and<br>Pacifica and what I would say to all the<br>all the educational leaders or the<br>tertiary education leaders in this house<br>is to walk with our people to deepen<br>those relationships with ewe hapu and<br>whanau walk with our Pacifica<br>communities deepen those relationships<br>and I know you guys are doing that but<br>we need to deepen those relationships so<br>we can make those connections with those<br>communities and create those Pathways<br>for our Maori and Pacifica communities<br>and for all of our diverse communities<br>into institutions like this it's so<br>important that commitment<br>um it has to be more than just words on<br>a bit of paper you have to feel it and I<br>would ask and invite everybody here to<br>to to think about that and to take that<br>on board<br>foreign<br>thank you we're going really well we're<br>really cracking through these topics<br>um to the next one the tertiary<br>education commission has done some<br>research looking at looking into the<br>future and it's it's discovered that the<br>career aspirations of 17 to 13 year olds<br>they found that the top choice for boys<br>and girls was Sports person<br>17 picked it well ahead of the next<br>option<br>I mean this might be good for the All<br>Blacks but it's not going to help us<br>find a cure for cancer or deal with<br>climate change<br>so I'm going to ask you each two<br>questions<br>first is what did you want to be when<br>you were seven<br>secondly what can we do to make today's<br>kids look beyond the football field the<br>netball Court Etc and aspire to be<br>future scientists environmental<br>Engineers for instance right we're going<br>to start with you Andy<br>um I wanted to play football<br>professionally<br>so I'm opening the model here but I<br>think the key thing is we've got to make<br>um the the all the different career<br>options things are going to make a huge<br>difference to our society going forward<br>we've got to make them interesting and<br>attractive I mean when you are that age<br>you don't actually know that half of<br>these things even exist so the first<br>thing you've got to do is you've got to<br>actually let our young people know that<br>those career options exist and there's I<br>mean how many different ways can we do<br>that you know you can go and take<br>children to visit<br>um some of the places that you know<br>scientific education I mean you know go<br>go around the malignant institute around<br>the corner for example you know if you<br>want to get them interested in sites<br>there's a heap of different things that<br>we can expose our young people to if we<br>want to get them inspired by those kind<br>of things and look at what we put on<br>television as well you know or or in any<br>of those those media that are available<br>to children and I put those things there<br>showcase them and say these things are<br>interesting these things are stimulating<br>and also you know okay the All Blacks<br>are our heroes they're a heap of other<br>Heroes as well you know who the the<br>young scientists who won when the<br>science um the Prime Minister science<br>award<br>that's my point we don't make them<br>Heroes and we should be making Heroes if<br>we make them Heroes people look at them<br>go wow that is cool I would like to be<br>like them when I grow up rather than<br>just seeing the All Blacks who I want to<br>grow up and look like<br>Chris did you um when you were receiving<br>did you want to be a Publican<br>jumper place Chris owns Nelson's best<br>pub by the way thank you oh thank you<br>Mike yeah it was great<br>um actually I think of him I did<br>actually start playing a<br>um the trumpet when I was uh seven years<br>old so I was probably aspiring to do<br>something along those lines<br>um but I I think uh at seven you really<br>just need to expose uh to to make sure<br>kids have the ability to to achieve what<br>they want to do you know by Reading<br>Writing experiencing all the the things<br>that Andy just spoke about I just know<br>that when I was 14 I knew that I wanted<br>to be a teacher and I I went home I<br>think it was an influence of some good<br>teachers and I thought they were really<br>cool people I that's what I want to do<br>so<br>yeah I think I think kids can be<br>influenced uh with with good role models<br>and Penny what's your view uh well at<br>seven I wanted to play hockey for New<br>Zealand so uh most young kids do want to<br>play top sport uh look and then I went<br>home to do a science degree so we've got<br>to expose uh children to science to the<br>stem subjects essentially and how those<br>stem subjects are such an integral part<br>of our um our careers and our economy<br>um agritech is such a big thing for us<br>and we should be world leaders in that<br>and well yet the humanities are<br>important but actually we do need a lot<br>more stem graduates so we have to face<br>that reality and we need to allow our<br>young people to see that they have<br>imported career outcomes<br>um Enzo I'm picking you would have<br>wanted to be a netballer<br>really so<br>good any<br>sideline cheering um I always wanted to<br>be an actor and I've kind of come full<br>circle I suspect in my character yeah<br>yeah so you know I ended up teaching<br>economics and theater and I guess that<br>combination would be called politics but<br>um<br>um I guess um we're seeing some<br>significant work of bringing um people<br>into classrooms I know there's some<br>great projects whether it's as<br>Industries like so when you go to<br>primary production they're understanding<br>if they want people to go into farming<br>then actually they need to bring those<br>Farmers into classrooms and there's some<br>great work going on but 18 you talk<br>about our heroes<br>actually we need more of those Heroes to<br>become teachers<br>because when you are confident and I<br>know this as a fact when you are<br>confident as a teacher you're excited<br>about the subject that you're teaching<br>because you know it and you're<br>passionate about it that is where a kid<br>makes a connection whether it's<br>philosophy or history or science or<br>drama or whatever it might be so we need<br>to encourage more of our heroes from<br>right across the curriculum into our<br>classrooms as experts to excite and<br>Inspire our young people whether it's<br>little kids right through to you know as<br>they're making decisions about<br>University or work<br>um I think that that's a challenge for<br>industry I've said to fund here I've put<br>up some great teaching scholarships<br>um so for me I think that would really<br>help<br>um<br>uh when I was seven I wanted to be a<br>librarian<br>I I really like books I still like books<br>but books read books long books um so I<br>used to spend a lot of time in the<br>library and I just think like when I was<br>growing up going to like second-hand<br>book shops or libraries they were like<br>magic places where you could you know<br>pick up a book and disappear and go<br>somewhere and and that and that kind of<br>thing and I just really liked how the<br>liberians would just kind of organize<br>all these different adventures and I<br>would kind of figure out try to figure<br>out how they would organize things and I<br>would often as as I got it became a more<br>competent reader I would like find<br>authors that I'd like and I'd just like<br>go through all of them as well so if<br>there's any Ursula Le Guin fans out<br>there<br>I'm one of them yeah thank you I'd just<br>like to go back to the question about<br>Terrell Maori in schools um<br>we were split up here but 82 percent of<br>you thought it should be compulsory I<br>think that's a really interesting<br>sorry<br>right we're going to do another quick<br>fire around here quickly<br>should first-year University students be<br>required to enroll in the paper about<br>climate change starting with you Tiana<br>oh my gosh I feel the pressure I think<br>it's I think it's a I think it's a good<br>idea yeah enough for sure I think it<br>definitely has it's an idea that has<br>Mirrors but we actually need to start at<br>school before they get here right and<br>there's also another piece in the I<br>think around Civics education because<br>when I went to school we didn't have<br>misinformation and disinformation and<br>and social media wasn't it wasn't a<br>thing where people could get caught by<br>the algorithms and down the rabbit hole<br>you go and then next thing you know<br>you've got even politicians being<br>climate change denials and so on and so<br>forth so I would I would I would support<br>Civics education within out within our<br>within our Cuda within us I think that's<br>a yes<br>lots of things we need to do Angela yes<br>or no on the climate change paper I<br>think it's really interesting them<br>because if you're going to have a<br>different lens across climate change<br>whichever part of the University you're<br>learning in and when you look at<br>something like the sustainable<br>development goals I think there's<br>potential for the bee to be a component<br>of climate change to be a part of any<br>degree and of course the humanities are<br>going to consider the issues differently<br>from science or you know whether it's<br>physics or whatever so that's the first<br>thing secondly I think that waiting<br>until University is too late we actually<br>have a fabulous New Zealand curriculum<br>it is under it is being refreshed and it<br>isn't just in science where we're<br>dealing with the climate change issue<br>but like you say in in English and media<br>studies talking about how do you<br>interrogate so you need some really good<br>scientific literacy but you also need to<br>be able to engage in in the in the<br>debate and be able to really interrogate<br>the evidence I'll remind a reminder that<br>no because I think the fastest way to<br>turn people off something is to make it<br>mandatory<br>Chris no I think once people get to you<br>uh students get to University they're<br>old enough to have opinions already<br>and finally Auntie yeah we would also<br>say no right I I think one one thing I<br>would say that is just to say just<br>imagine if it was compulsory and you<br>failed it was the way it was the one<br>thing that was stopping you getting your<br>degree now I'm not sure that was very<br>popular<br>um right we just keep on the quick fire<br>for for a little bit um<br>does it matter that languages are taught<br>at the University yes or no Andy yes<br>yeah language is a I mean we've just had<br>the conversation about today you know<br>it's a it's absolutely vital in our<br>country whether it's compulsory not<br>obviously we have a bit of a<br>disagreement but languages are a real<br>core part of what about German and<br>things like that well I mean I learned a<br>bit of German at this University as well<br>um that was my choice to do that<br>um I enjoyed I used it when I went<br>overseas as well I think language is a<br>really really important part of cultures<br>and I think people should have that<br>opportunity to be able to learn<br>languages<br>thank you Chris uh yes yes if the demand<br>is there absolutely<br>yes but do we have to have them at every<br>University possibly not<br>um Angela do you think Germans should be<br>taught here<br>well I think languages should be<br>accessible at every University is<br>Tiana<br>um I uh when I when I was at high school<br>I did calculus and I did statistics and<br>physics and stuff like that and I<br>dropped French I haven't used calculus<br>and all that other kind of stuff but I<br>ended up living in France for a couple<br>of years and their French would have<br>come in real Handy if I'd continue to in<br>return to do that like languages they<br>are the they are the windows to other<br>perspectives they're the windows to<br>other worlds I I think we should<br>celebrate our humanities celebrate our<br>languages being bilingual is awesome but<br>being multilingual is even more awesome<br>yeah<br>um just sticking with this theme a<br>little bit uh phonics or whole languages<br>I have not thought about this one at all<br>right she has that<br>okay so you wimped out of this okay I'm<br>going for the the union Thug<br>and obviously it's not a binary<br>conversation that's the words I was<br>looking for when you are teaching anyone<br>to read whether it is a child or an<br>adult whoever and you consider their<br>learning challenges and all the rest in<br>the world that they come from you have a<br>kitten that has a range of strategies<br>um the Arab there is better practice<br>um which we are starting to roll out in<br>schools and so it isn't a binary it<br>isn't either actually it's them plus and<br>um yeah okay penny is that<br>is that going to be a bit confusing for<br>teachers uh yes it is and I think that<br>teachers need to be given better<br>resources I think we have our curriculum<br>has left things too open and that's been<br>difficult particularly for young<br>teachers I think we need to have much<br>better resources and a tighter<br>curriculum to uh to assist so you know I<br>do trust them but I think they need more<br>resources more support right so you'll<br>be so stoked to vote for us and make<br>sure that we continue<br>to practice model evidence-informed<br>developed at the University of<br>Canterbury the resources for teachers<br>and significant professional development<br>to support them because for a few years<br>thank you Chris yeah again it should be<br>evidence-based and and it should be a<br>choice of a school principal in the<br>school board as to how they deliver that<br>and and the the the number of the number<br>of students that they get who want to<br>parents want them to learn like that<br>will well they couldn't have a short<br>appearance nominating what happens with<br>you'd have to have two teachers in the<br>classroom but no if they if they if they<br>knew that as one school focused on on<br>one style then and they didn't like it<br>they'd go somewhere else unless you're<br>in a rural community and you've got no<br>choice<br>okay okay okay we'll just we'll just get<br>an engine for 22 years we'll just get<br>Andy's view on Phonics thank you my<br>students I disagree but I don't know the<br>answer don't know which of the two of<br>them is better<br>um and um you know some of them might be<br>better for different different students<br>as well I would make the point though<br>that um<br>sometimes being able to go from one<br>school to another school is not that<br>easy as you know most of our schools<br>here certainly primary level I think in<br>the the area which I previously<br>represented every single one bar one was<br>zoned so that's slightly problematic<br>saying I don't like the way that this<br>school teaches but I then want to go to<br>the next school that is full and then I<br>want to go it just doesn't doesn't work<br>so right there's a challenge there right<br>we're going to take some quests some<br>audience questions shortly but I want to<br>have one final quick fight question with<br>you here you've all done tertiary study<br>what was the most important thing you<br>learned during that study starting with<br>I think probably it's the it's the way<br>to be able to research things to<br>um<br>to compile a set of evidence and then to<br>make an argument to weigh up the the way<br>up the issues that um on each side and<br>then come up to come to an argument so<br>it's not about a particular subject it's<br>more about being able to compile all the<br>the evidence weigh that evidence up and<br>then make a decision which is exactly<br>the way that politics ought to work<br>rather than make the decision before<br>you've weighed up the evidence<br>thank you Chris<br>um it's a tricky one I I think I um<br>realized that academic work is really<br>tough<br>um prior to coming to University I was<br>scrub cutting in the bush and<br>actually sitting up all night trying to<br>get a an essay done was just as tough<br>I think working in teams being able to<br>deal with the project together and<br>realize uh people have different<br>strengths and allocating different<br>strengths different parts of projects so<br>just realizing that you could come<br>together as a team and do something<br>really special thank you<br>I guess<br>um<br>I learned how powerful learning is and<br>how powerful it can be to be curious and<br>ask good questions<br>you should have been a journalist<br>uh Tiana<br>um good question<br>I when I when I when I went to<br>University uh took one of my lectures<br>was whanganui Walker so that was the<br>first time I was learning about to treat<br>your waitangi the land Wars and all this<br>kind of stuff you know 18 year old me<br>hadn't heard learned any of that stuff<br>in high school didn't teach us any of<br>that kind of stuff and the other person<br>who I learned a lot from was Jeannette<br>Fitzsimons I enrolled in environmental<br>science paper and she was our lecturer<br>and that's where I first learned about<br>like global warming and climate change<br>and you know the impacts of<br>deforestation and why it's so important<br>for us to have healthy oceans and those<br>kinds of things so it's those kind of<br>those kinds of great minds<br>and being able to access those those<br>people and their knowledge<br>which was I guess a beginning of a<br>lifelong journey of not just learning<br>but also action because once you learn<br>the ideas once I've learned from these<br>people that well okay now that I'm that<br>I should do something about it so the<br>way that that kind of shaped my whole<br>life's journey was really important<br>so thank you very much<br>um<br>right we've got a whole list of<br>questions from the audience but I'm<br>going to just<br>um because we're running a bit shorter<br>time now I'm just going to pick out a<br>few and the first one I'm going to ask<br>is from bromward wood she's an education<br>lecturer and she says recent data is<br>showing high school students are<br>selecting lightweight credits and<br>avoiding subjects perceived to be<br>difficult<br>is it time to reform in cea I'm going to<br>start in the Middle With You penny<br>yeah I think that we've seen<br>particularly in this last year where<br>retention rates have been particularly<br>low in the first year at University that<br>our school leavers are not particularly<br>well prepared for for tertiary education<br>so look I do think we will have to have<br>a look at NCA and whether it is fit for<br>purpose and particularly whether it's<br>fit for purpose For Preparing People for<br>tertiary<br>um Chris too many people taking<br>lightweight subjects yeah I do think<br>that has become an issue and and NCAA<br>certainly needs to be looked at<br>um one of X proposals and its policies<br>is to to get rid of uh NTA level three<br>input University entrance as the the<br>level three<br>um year 13<br>um qualifications so and addressing<br>addressing that very very thing you're<br>talking about uh Tiana<br>um two things<br>um I'd like to know what lightweight<br>means<br>um I mean no not all school students are<br>the same not everybody wants to come to<br>our media studies is one for you<br>we've done so well so maybe people<br>shouldn't take that um so there's<br>there's that there's that concern as<br>well making sure we have those the<br>diversity of subjects so that you know<br>the students can step into whatever<br>career pathway is good for them but also<br>I'm worried about churn<br>um so whenever we have you know when you<br>refresh the system then a new government<br>comes on and they want to refresh the<br>refresh and then refresh the refresh<br>that creates so much churn in the system<br>if you're going to do uh changes like<br>this it's got to be timed well because<br>what happens that it draws all the<br>resources out of the out of the system<br>and uh<br>curriculum experts don't grow on trees<br>you know like if you're getting people<br>to focus on particular particular things<br>and all of a sudden your group comes on<br>and they want to refresh it that means<br>all of that previous work is<br>going to have to be redone and then it's<br>probably going to be done by those same<br>people it takes up a lot of time and a<br>lot of resources when we actually need<br>to be focusing on some other issues so<br>uh yeah you always need to take a look<br>at at the system and and review things<br>but also timeliness is also I think an<br>important factor yep Angelo there was<br>some discussion before about the need to<br>I think from Penny to focus a bit more<br>on stem subjects<br>what's your view around this issue<br>are you talking about steam or NCA or<br>well<br>um I I guess these lightweight subjects<br>if we go back okay tell us what language<br>okay yeah so um I've been teaching I<br>just need to shout out to my former<br>students who are students of Victoria so<br>some of them do make it just saying<br>um you know who you are<br>um I've been around long enough that I<br>I've taught three lots of qualifications<br>in this country and NCAA is in the<br>middle of a refresh at the moment and<br>that is a response to equity of access<br>for students but it's also about I think<br>the idea behind the original NCAA was<br>about getting parity across Knowledge<br>and Skills it didn't matter if it was<br>around and in parity being quite<br>rigorous around whether it's dance or<br>physics right I used to have the segment<br>with my head of science about he says oh<br>my goodness how can you get six credits<br>for dance at level three when my<br>students are getting them and so I said<br>well you go and devise a three-minute<br>piece on Grief darling<br>um so that was a and that was a really<br>rigorous process that we went through<br>an interesting thing happened when our<br>previous government required an 85 pass<br>rate at level two and it incentivized<br>some really interesting behavior and<br>that there was a whole pile of credit<br>farming because we were told it didn't<br>matter what kids were coming out with<br>they just needed 85 credit 80 um they<br>needed 85 pass they just need to pass<br>so there was a whole pile of unit<br>standards<br>that hadn't gone through that rigor of<br>parity and so you did have kids going<br>off in the holidays and getting tweeting<br>credits and a unit standards course and<br>coming back and I go right we're going<br>to do a Manifesto policy it's going to<br>you know at a level two economics around<br>housing and it's going to take us most<br>of the term and it's only six credits<br>and the kids are going forget it so that<br>that was a hangover from the 85<br>requirement so um and one other problem<br>of course when we were seeking to give<br>parity to other<br>Knowledge and Skills was that we lost<br>the requirement to be able to be<br>literate enumerate as well and we need<br>both we need you to be able to<br>demonstrate your Knowledge and Skills<br>through creating a piece of theater or<br>conducting a science experiment but we<br>also need you to be literate<br>so removing the barriers to<br>demonstrating knowledge of schools on<br>one hand lost just letting them and<br>that's coming back I think we can't<br>ignore the fact that a lot of our<br>secondary schools are going to alternate<br>qualifications Baccalaureate<br>qualifications and particularly our<br>biggest school uh secondary school is so<br>we can't ignore that we have to look at<br>yeah look there's certainly some<br>occasions when people will say look this<br>one looks harder than this one so I'll<br>go for the easy one or the but I think<br>the key thing there is that<br>um we've got a real diversity of<br>different opportunities through the NCAA<br>program at the moment and absolutely we<br>would say you've got to do that you know<br>you've got to do those core Basics got<br>to have some of the skill there because<br>if you don't have those skills it's<br>going to be very very hard when whether<br>you're going to tertiary education or<br>whether you're going to the workforce<br>whatever you need those core skills but<br>we also need to make sure that the<br>education system is flexible enough to<br>allow people to train and to learn about<br>the things that actually interest them<br>and that work for them we are not you<br>know every one of us is different we all<br>have different aspirations we all have<br>different skills and the education<br>system should work for us and to the<br>extent that it doesn't and I I gave the<br>illustration before of me if you've got<br>some learning challenges the system at<br>the moment doesn't work and so it needs<br>to be more flexible so I certainly would<br>say support doing a review checking<br>things out holeless Bowlers is going to<br>be a problem them but sit and reviewing<br>it so we try and make sure that it works<br>because what we do want is we want our<br>young people to be able to say I've been<br>through educating the compulsory<br>education sector and I come out with<br>something and I feel like I've achieved<br>something because that's really really<br>important<br>thank you handy<br>um right we're going to closing<br>statements now and what I would like you<br>to address is this you're the education<br>minister of the next government<br>you're so optimistic thank you<br>what will be your two top priorities and<br>why but you only have a minute each<br>starting with you giano<br>top priorities would be ring controls<br>and an income guarantee so that students<br>don't live in poverty and hardship and<br>that will make it easier for them to<br>come to institutions like that I've done<br>it's just<br>Penny Simons<br>Simmons sorry<br>fixing the vocational education sector<br>it's just such a mess we're losing<br>valuable staff out of it and we are<br>losing our liaison with industry and so<br>we've got to get that back on track uh<br>200 million has been wasted already<br>another billion is being signaled to be<br>wasted on it over the next decade we<br>just can't allow that to continue<br>happening so that's going to have to be<br>the first priority do you have a second<br>priority<br>uh the second priority really is having<br>a look at the University system and just<br>seeing whether there is uh areas where<br>we perhaps should be rationalizing uh<br>areas to make sure that we don't lose<br>our capacity uh anywhere in this in the<br>sector but that we aren't trying to<br>replicate things with very small numbers<br>Chris your two top Rarities uh two top<br>priorities would be having a really good<br>look at the current Ministry of<br>Education and<br>making sure those extra were 2 500 there<br>are now over 4 000 people working there<br>making sure that that is actually good<br>bang for buck and and uh and sorting<br>that out the uh the second thing would<br>be reintroducing partnership schools to<br>to help those the the inequity that is<br>going on in in our in a lot of our<br>societies I was hoping you were going to<br>um Angela your two top priorities yeah<br>one of them is really boring um it's<br>finished the stuff that we 've got it<br>it's been really crunchy collaborations<br>really time consuming and it's messy we<br>need to finish curriculum refresh the<br>ncea reforms Grove we need to get on<br>with the um the review that we've<br>announced for tertiary funding<br>um so that's the first thing is finish<br>stuff and embed it because teachers and<br>tertiary and right through Early<br>Childhood are they've sucked up so much<br>change and we need to embed it and see<br>it through that's the first bit the<br>second thing for me I think we really<br>need to prioritize teacher development<br>so those who are in classrooms we know<br>that we need to support them to continue<br>to improve their ability to respond to<br>the greater number of diverse students<br>with different challenges and support<br>them to be better because we all want to<br>be better teachers there's room for<br>improvement to support them and teacher<br>training as well I think we need to make<br>sure that we're able to respond teachers<br>are able to respond to their students<br>it's important to do that thank you<br>Andrew<br>and I haven't talked to the minister<br>about that<br>and Andy if Winston Peters holds the<br>balance of power on Election night and<br>you're swept in and made minister of<br>Education what are your two top writers<br>education wasn't one of the ones that I<br>I put down on my list but never mind<br>um but I think the two key things the<br>first one of them is to try to make sure<br>that in the compulsory education sector<br>so primary and secondary school a that<br>our our children are at school and B<br>that they're learning the things they<br>need to learn so they come out of school<br>equipped to be able to take on whether<br>it's tertiary education or or going into<br>the workforce whatever it might be and<br>at the moment it's quite clear that far<br>far too many of our children are being<br>left behind and we can't afford that<br>that they are our future but they're<br>also their future and it's just there is<br>no way that we can afford to let people<br>behind so we want to make sure that<br>everybody is looked after in that way I<br>think the second one we probably is the<br>one that we we touched on at the<br>beginning which is the University model<br>and whether it's right for our country<br>at the moment and I think it's clearly<br>we've I think we've clearly had the<br>discussion that it is somewhat broken<br>and so looking at that how we how we fix<br>that and that's both the<br>um if you like that the teaching part of<br>it but also the um the research part<br>which is critically important to have<br>that country going forward as well<br>thank you very much that's the end of<br>tonight's debate<br>um congratulations to you all for doing<br>all right um Winnie and Jessica were you<br>yeah I think they can give me this<br>farewell<br>my name is Jess I'm the president of<br>users this year thank you candidates and<br>staff and student Community for coming<br>out tonight for a very spirited and<br>great debate and it's fantastic that<br>there's so many of us here today<br>what's the questions and reactions that<br>we have been seeing from our crowd<br>tonight I hope all the candidates today<br>understand the severity of the issues<br>that education is currently facing in<br>aotearoa and we hope that if elected you<br>take these issues extremely seriously<br>and whilst education typically isn't the<br>hottest election topic because of its<br>long time scales and the face of a three<br>election cycle it doesn't make education<br>any less important education is about<br>our long-term future<br>and tonight we'll spend a lot of time<br>hearing the candidates talk some of it<br>being the usual rhetoric some of it more<br>valuable and insightful but we must<br>remember that tonight is not really<br>about the candidates it is about us the<br>the future of education is not something<br>that we have no agency in it is not up<br>to the few people on stage today to<br>determine this for us and we must<br>unentalize any helplessness that we feel<br>and act with power and we are the ones<br>who have the power to determine this<br>future of Education in aotearoa with our<br>votes I'll quote it all with others and<br>other forms of democratic engagement<br>notably the power of Education that all<br>our Educators here today understand and<br>that transformational impact it has on<br>students and as voters we get to decide<br>who we entrust with the weight of<br>students Futures the half of our<br>institutions and the future of altero we<br>have a higher education funding review<br>on the way to ensure the funding model<br>can become sustainable and serve us all<br>and we all agree education is the<br>backbone of the society this review and<br>this long-term future of our country<br>cannot be used as a political football<br>and it will require our politicians to<br>so we expect you all to not just<br>electioneer for our votes in this season<br>but live up to a genuine commitment to<br>education to everyone here today we<br>design a future where education is<br>financially accessible where<br>institutions are well funded to provide<br>students with an education that not only<br>shapes individuals but caring can<br>communities concerned with contributing<br>to the common good so if you're elected<br>we urge you to stand shorter to Shorter<br>with us on the ground and to stand up<br>for Education alongside us<br>thank you candidates for making time<br>today and to everyone else here for<br>showing up showing people power for<br>Education voting opens on the 2nd of<br>October until the 14th of October and<br>there's also going to be a voting booth<br>right behind me here on campus and I<br>will now hand it over to assistant Vice<br>Chancellor Pacifica honorable Luana who<br>and very warm Pacific greetings to you<br>all<br>it is my pleasure to thank our MC Mark<br>and thank you to the candidates<br>Chris Bailey from the ACT party Tiano<br>from the green party Angela Roberts from<br>labor Penny Simmons from National and<br>Andy Foster from New Zealand first<br>thank you all for your spirited<br>contributions to the debate<br>putting yourself forward for political<br>office takes courage<br>wide and active political participation<br>is important and necessary for a healthy<br>democracy<br>democracy is fragile in this age of<br>misinformation<br>disinformation and 24 hour a day social<br>media scrutiny<br>this has been a robust and interesting<br>discussion<br>I hope that this debate has helped<br>participants and the audience of our<br>voters<br>to clarify their views<br>and will lead to well-informed policies<br>to ensure a strong future for tertiary<br>education our universities in aotearoa<br>New Zealand<br>I also wanted to thank the chancellor<br>the vice Chancellor staff and students<br>of teheringawaka Victoria University of<br>Wellington<br>we have all been going through a very<br>challenging time<br>and we need to maintain a dialogue with<br>government and opposition members of<br>parliament to ensure that our views are<br>part of political discussions<br>around the future of tertiary education<br>and our University<br>one thing we can all do is vote in the<br>general election and have our say on who<br>best represents us<br>representatives from the Electoral<br>commission are here if anyone wants to<br>enroll or has questions about enrollment<br>finally a big thank you to the<br>organizers of the 2023 election debate<br>the future of Education in our Terror<br>New Zealand thank you Tilly lover travel<br>home safely</p></main><footer style="margin-top: 2rem; background: #0001; padding: 2rem;
