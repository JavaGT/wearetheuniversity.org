font-size: 0.8em">Transcripts may be automatically generated and may not be 100% accurate.</p><p>um so yeah hi I'm Olaf deagle I'm<br>professor of additive manufacturing here<br>at the University of Auckland and I head<br>up the additive manufacturing lab within<br>the Center for Advanced Materials<br>manufacturing and design um So within<br>the additive manufacturing lab basically<br>I describe it as a giant toy room that<br>in which we make stuff so anything you<br>can imagine we can make here whether<br>it's metal whether it's food whether<br>it's Ceramics or Plastics we try to make<br>it as quickly and as efficiently as<br>possible um some of the interesting<br>Innovations in 3D printing particularly<br>over the last year or two um are some of<br>the ones along material so for example<br>we can now print in wood so using<br>sawdust and bio epoxy so epoxy made from<br>Liden which is another waste Wood<br>Products we can print entire products<br>that are reconstituted wood and it's<br>material that otherwise would go to<br>landfill or be incinerated so you're<br>taking waste material and you're turning<br>into something that's got a huge amount<br>of value that people are willing to pay<br>big money<br>for the project to make I guess<br>uh Maui instrument preservation so<br>effectively uh preservation of artifacts<br>um started with the University of<br>auckland's kyari so Michael steedman who<br>had a con shell trumpet that was a<br>family heirloom passed down from<br>generations and you know beautiful con<br>shell trumpet the problem is you<br>couldn't have kids playing with it<br>because if they drop it it's gone<br>forever um so that's how the whole<br>project started up where we took his con<br>shell up to the ockland hospital they<br>did a CT scan of it which gave us 3D<br>data and if you can imagine a conell<br>trumpet the spiral on the inside would<br>be almost impossible to get any other<br>way but once we had that 3D model we<br>could print him effectively<br>reproductions of his own uh con shell<br>trumpet and fully playable instruments<br>that he could now have kids playing with<br>so we've printed a bunch of those for<br>them um including full color prints and<br>nylon strong prints that you can pretty<br>much throw against the wall without<br>worrying about them breaking but those<br>are the ones you can give to kids<br>without worrying about them damaging<br>something precious so this is the<br>machine this is your powder so it's<br>nylon powder in this case so we spread a<br>layer of powder the laser comes from the<br>top and draws on it wherever the laser<br>hits it it solidifies and that platform<br>drops down so at the end this bucket is<br>full of powder with your parts inside<br>and we dig it out of the powder blow off<br>the surface powder and it's ready to go<br>with this technology there's always a<br>lot of ethical questions about and it<br>gets more so when it comes to cultural<br>artifact so really good example of this<br>is the trumpet that we're working on now<br>which is a 1 meter long trumpet when we<br>print it do we print it out of something<br>that looks identical in terms of the<br>wood texture of it in this case we<br>decided not to so we spoke to the ewi um<br>and we decided to print it out of white<br>plastic so it's not trying to replace<br>the cultural artifact it's just trying<br>to be something that can be used by the<br>general public because you don't want to<br>remove the value from the original<br>artifact</p></main><footer style="margin-top: 2rem;
