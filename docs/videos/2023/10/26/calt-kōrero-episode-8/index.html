name Nica Nicola oh<br>fantastic we got that bit right that's<br>awesome and what do you do Nicola so I'm<br>a senior lecturer in the department of<br>accountancy and finance I'm also the<br>director of the core which is the suite<br>of business papers that all Commerce<br>students have to take and I'm the<br>current New Zealand president of aans<br>which stands for accounting and finance<br>Association Australia and New Zealand<br>which is quite a mouthful which is why<br>we shorten it to a fans<br>back to you CLA who are you yeah who am<br>I I really don't know at this point um<br>Kiora<br>Coto G Talk winga I am the director of<br>student services student services is a<br>directorate that supports uh students in<br>in all manner of activities I might<br>actually list although I'm sure to get<br>one of these things wrong all the the<br>services that we provide because it's<br>quite broad so we have student health in<br>in the directorate we have um the<br>Proctor's office in campus watch we have<br>disability information and support we<br>have Rick Center and unipole we have the<br>career uh Development Center and the<br>social impact Studio we had the locals<br>program we have TOA tataka the Mari<br>Center we have the Pacific island Center<br>we have tari tafaro um who provide<br>sexual violence um support and<br>prevention activities I'm also the chair<br>of puia toku the student relief fund and<br>and I am the chair of the Sophia Charter<br>implementation group um which is around<br>making us safer North D Eden so I I'm<br>really excited to be here I have an<br>amazing team um I I really don't do any<br>work any you know any day of the week<br>but all my team does it for me but it's<br>really awesome to be able to talk about<br>the work that they do um because we we<br>provide I think some of the the best<br>pastoral care support that we can<br>possibly provide in any University<br>setting and I'm super excited um to talk<br>about that um okay so let's get on with<br>it I said that there were going to be<br>three topics and the first one was going<br>to be about Student Success um so I'm<br>going to uh open it up to uh either of<br>you actually what does Student Success<br>look like what does it mean what does it<br>mean to you um well for me cl it really<br>means students getting their opportunity<br>to to thrive and in a safe environment<br>to acquire knowledge<br>to pass hopefully um but to to gain life<br>skills as well it's it's the whole<br>student we need to be looking at not<br>just whether they do get that 50 or<br>above I think it's really critical to<br>look at success from a a very broad um<br>angle that would be my my first thing<br>that I'd want to say about that<br>Melissa so in the space we work in<br>success means different things to<br>different people for some students it<br>may be<br>successful for them to just get out of<br>bed in the morning and get to a lecture<br>um for other students it's the pursuit<br>of an excellent academic grade and then<br>for some again it's more about managing<br>their studies alongside their health<br>condition and establishing some support<br>networks along the<br>way yeah so that's quite a different um<br>definition I think to success than than<br>say the measures that we might be given<br>by Tec where it's very much metrics<br>about um how many people pass how many<br>people do we aain how many people<br>complete their their degrees and and I<br>think what both of you have I'm hearing<br>from both of you is about putting the<br>student at the heart of that and<br>centering them and it and it becomes<br>less I I obviously we're we're an<br>educational institution we want people<br>to pass um but actually sometimes it's<br>not the right time for somebody to be<br>doing um the degree that they're doing<br>sometimes they're not doing the right<br>degree um and so success could look like<br>transitioning from Dentistry to dancing<br>or it could look like going down to the<br>poltech and working out that actually um<br>you you'd rather be an arborist than<br>than a lawyer um I'd rather be an<br>arborist than a lawyer so I totally get<br>that one so um you know really about<br>taking I think what the student views as<br>what's important to them and taking it<br>kind of on the on on their own terms and<br>and and making sure that we check in and<br>ask them and not just believing that<br>that we know exactly what it what it<br>looks like and the path to success is<br>different for each of those individuals<br>yeah yeah yeah absolutely that sounds<br>like a massive job though I mean you you<br>you know as an academic you already had<br>a huge job in terms of um teaching<br>people and keeping up on research and<br>doing all the service that you you do<br>which I love like this yeah totally I<br>mean who's not going to love this this<br>is just awesome um but but you know you<br>know how do how do you manage that then<br>if we if what we're saying is actually<br>it's different for every student um<br>we're going to put the student at the<br>heart of that and at the center of it<br>now now it seems to me there's a lot<br>more things that you have to do in a day<br>than than just be an expert in your area<br>and keep up on your research and and do<br>res research informed teaching have you<br>got any thoughts about that oh I 100%<br>agree but it's about prioritizing I<br>think I think it's what's important you<br>know I I don't like the excuse of I<br>didn't have enough time because it's<br>it's not always true it's what did you<br>prioritize so if you prioritize student<br>well-being then you make time for it and<br>I think we have to do that as academics<br>or else we're not we're not doing um<br>doing them just I mean we're not there<br>yeah we have to be there for the student<br>yeah 100% and you've done some really<br>interesting research on on how to<br>support that space haven't you um so<br>you've you've researched into the<br>importance of belonging um would you<br>able to tell us a little bit about that<br>you may not be able to stop me okay like<br>I'm warning you I will get up and stop<br>you thank you so all my all my research<br>is around those non-cognitive aspects of<br>learning so what's influencing the path<br>to success is it um things like sense of<br>belonging so they don't feel like they<br>should be at University or is it<br>self-efficacy is it determination effort<br>motivation all of these things and<br>that's what really fascinates me so I<br>love digging into that and we know from<br>the research it's well established<br>across every discipline I can think of<br>um at high school University level that<br>belonging feeling like you belong will<br>lead to a higher chance of academic<br>success same as higher self-efficacy<br>will lead to a better chance of academic<br>mic success so these things are really<br>really important from an academic in the<br>classroom when I'm looking at my<br>classroom I need to think about those<br>things and whether the student feels<br>good and I think academics often<br>especially when we're dealing with large<br>numbers so I've got 400 exams sitting on<br>my desk waiting for me and when we look<br>at large classes it's it's very easy to<br>to look at the student students in<br>uniform and go well you're all the same<br>and to take some sort of preconceived<br>notion about what a student is<br>especially a first year student and it's<br>not always accurate my dad I was<br>actually talking with my dad about um<br>some of this cuz he used to be the<br>chaplain here at University of atago in<br>the<br>1990s he wrote a book on homesickness at<br>the time and I looked at it cuz he<br>shared it with me and it's so relevant<br>today even though we're dealing with a<br>different different set of students<br>we've got gen Z we've got Co postco<br>generation we've got<br>complications that well not<br>complications different<br>circumstances but everybody gets<br>homesick and not every student is<br>sitting in those Halls partying some of<br>them are sitting there miserable and<br>really anxious really stressed coping<br>with all sorts of things that we can't<br>even imagine so when they come to me and<br>they say I've got this problem I'm late<br>for my assignment or something and I go<br>oh they were just hung over they didn't<br>get a chance to do it and I dismissed<br>that I think that's a high risk in fact<br>it's 100% wrong so we have to look at<br>each student as they come in as an<br>individual that person may or may not<br>feel good and that is going to influence<br>the experience that they have in the<br>classroom it really<br>is yeah no that's great thank you and<br>and I just want to pick up on a couple<br>of things you said um you know the the<br>idea that that the students are out<br>there just partying and and as you say<br>having having a fun time I mean that is<br>part of what is the attraction um I<br>think for some students to Oto but the<br>otago experience it's it's a great<br>University and it's far more than that<br>and and I think um when you talk to<br>students you'll find out that loads of<br>them are absolutely not doing that<br>they're here to get education they're<br>here to try things that that are new<br>they are here to get away from their<br>families and you know at that age I<br>wanted to get away from my f I still do<br>want to get away from my family some<br>days so no I totally get that but but we<br>can I think make assumptions um<br>particularly if we kind of read um every<br>believe everything that we might see in<br>the media about about what the student<br>life and experience actually looks like<br>and I think that you know a lot of the<br>work that is done in student services is<br>really honing in on that sense of<br>belonging as well because<br>creating belonging in the classroom<br>super important but viewing the support<br>services as as an extension of your<br>classroom you know that's what I'd urge<br>everyone um to actually start all the<br>academic staff to start thinking about<br>how can we be an extension to your<br>classroom um we don't we only exist<br>because we are University and we're<br>enabling um students yeah to succeed and<br>and we have to be that team to mataka<br>for instance the Mari Center that you<br>know they they take co- Mar approach to<br>um to supporting the learning and the<br>pastoral care of of of Marty students<br>and there's some myths that we want to<br>bust around that uh for instance we have<br>the feel I think some students have the<br>feeling that they're not Marty enough<br>absolutely not the case you a papa<br>Mar you're Mar enough to come along and<br>join in to um to to to what to masaka<br>can offer and academics out there come<br>along and find out what they can offer<br>um and just one of the services that we<br>have but it's it's about actually making<br>an extension and creating a whole<br>Community for everyone centered around<br>the individual uh cultural needs um<br>pastoral needs um Health needs Etc super<br>important because every individual has<br>that set of experiences that have<br>brought them to here right now and two<br>students might ask me the same question<br>but they need different answers you know<br>and so I have to stop and really think<br>and not make assumptions because it's<br>dangerous yeah especially in your line<br>of of work Melissa I imagine that's<br>that's even more challenging oh the old<br>saying assumptions yes not good yeah<br>absolutely I think that is the the old<br>saying assumptions not good yes um so<br>Melissa you know thinking thinking about<br>um students and how how we actually make<br>sure that everyone is included how how<br>can we design our courses our support<br>the way that we interact with people to<br>ensure that we leave no one behind you<br>think yeah absolutely so in terms of our<br>built environment we're doing<br>exceptionally well um we're one of the<br>only universities to have a campus<br>designed for Access and Mobility policy<br>and the purpose of this is to ensure<br>that we're practicable um walkways car<br>Parks buildings grounds are accessible<br>to students and visitors with<br>disabilities and staff obviously um we<br>can guarantee that no student will ever<br>enter a classroom or teaching space that<br>isn't accessible to them and that's<br>thanks to the good work that our<br>timetables team does alongside us our<br>biggest area to harness is utilizing<br>principles of Universal Design for<br>Learning or commonly known as<br>udl um particularly important as<br>academics are creating and designing<br>courses so udl is an educational<br>approach that aims to provide all<br>students regardless of their ability<br>similar to what you've been talking<br>about Nicola um or their learning styles<br>with equal opportunities to learn and<br>succeed it emphasizes flexibility<br>multiple means of assessment engagement<br>and expression to accommodate diverse<br>Learners so a good example of this is<br>making lecture notes or recordings<br>available to students and a practical<br>application of that means that our note<br>taking team wouldn't then have to Source<br>note taking support um just for students<br>with disabilities so that comes at a<br>significant cost we um purchase notes of<br>around $350 note takers per year so in<br>an Ideal World and Universal Design<br>space we would just have lecture<br>recordings available for students to<br>watch without being penalized we've<br>heard of some people saying if you watch<br>this lecture more than once or twice<br>you'll be penalized so we'd like it just<br>to be that people can access the<br>material for as long as they need yeah<br>yeah yeah um that sounds great and and<br>it does sound like you know we then be<br>able to focus other kinds of support um<br>in a Better Way um Nicola do you have<br>any thoughts in terms of obviously just<br>thinking back through what happened in<br>Co and there was huge ex additional<br>burden on academic staff to be teaching<br>very quickly pivoting and teaching very<br>Qui quickly online and um working in<br>ways that might have been really really<br>new to them um and we're now in an<br>interesting phase because we we we've<br>seen a lot of the benefits from doing<br>that um for students and if we take the<br>student at heart of it with you know<br>thinking on okay well people are still<br>going to get sick the reality is they're<br>also um they're having to work more<br>hours than back in my day when I was at<br>University where I had the luxury of of<br>doing a bit of work in the summer and<br>and then really just concentrating on my<br>study but but now the reality is that<br>they're juggling a lot of commitments um<br>so without kind of imposing more work<br>more costs on on on um academics have<br>you got any thoughts about how we how we<br>best serve that individual student to<br>that's yeah it's a great question um I<br>think the the students these days I<br>expected coming out of Co to not want to<br>be in the classroom to still learn<br>online I haven't found that to be the<br>case um my lectures this semester were<br>really well attended and when I had to<br>go online because my son was ill so I<br>did a at home Zoom lecture they<br>complained they want that face-to-face<br>experience now that they've got the<br>opportunity to do it again however as<br>you say they are struggling to balance<br>everything in their lives and we've got<br>professional sporting commitments we've<br>got work we've got family obligations<br>some of these students have got family<br>obligations that take a lot of time um<br>and other<br>responsibilities so having those online<br>lectures enable them it also helps<br>International students to be able to<br>revise if English isn't their first<br>language so it it really does play a<br>role but I was just delighted that<br>students wanted to be face Toof face<br>again and I think that we should all<br>celebrate that and we're unique here at<br>ATO because we we do Embrace that and<br>encourage that and I think it's<br>wonderful yeah we see that a lot in the<br>um student health space as well students<br>can um get uh uh counseling mental<br>health support practically instantly um<br>online and um that they they tend not to<br>actually want to take it up they would<br>tend to prefer to wait a couple of weeks<br>not for their initial consult but maybe<br>for their follow-up um consultation to<br>see somebody in person rather than<br>online but I but I do also hear from<br>students and you will be hearing this a<br>lot about having having both modalities<br>avilable to them so they can balance<br>their lives and I think let's face that<br>students are more likely to turn up if<br>the content is engaging I mean every<br>single time for instance um if they'<br>known about this they'd be absolutely<br>filling the studio right now in they are<br>Town H Town Hall Town Hall YouTube is<br>going to go wild I can tell um this one<br>okay so Student Success then we've we've<br>talked a little bit um around various<br>different kinds of things it's academic<br>achievement but it's more than academic<br>achievement um it's about different<br>things for different students and and<br>taking the time to know their story and<br>um and and to try different things I<br>think then to to make them succeed on<br>the sense of belonging and self efficacy<br>if anybody online is wanting to talk<br>about tips and tricks or in the room I<br>would love to do that separately we<br>don't have time obviously today but<br>there are things we can do to really<br>lift and encourage that so yeah happy to<br>talk with anybody it's fantastic to see<br>you pimping your research like this<br>really endorse it pimp my research it's<br>a new show that's it pimp my research<br>it's going to be it's going to be huge<br>our careers really are going to be<br>taking off I can see that okay awesome<br>thank you very much the next thing I<br>said that we' talk about is pastoral<br>care in general um we keep kind of<br>mentioning it or you know alluding to it<br>um but but I'm really interested um<br>in why why does it matter what does good<br>pastoral care look<br>like one of you is going to have Melissa<br>throw me under the bus um good pastoral<br>care actually is about supporting the<br>whole student um and the spaces that<br>they're in I think where we're at we're<br>often uh working alongside students who<br>are in crisis um and for some they are<br>looking at withdrawing under exceptional<br>circumstances and that's tough um you<br>know you've potentially borrowed money<br>off your your family to come to<br>University and you're not doing so well<br>so suddenly you have that obligation um<br>to your family you are looking at<br>so-call being a failure um and then<br>getting yourself well to come back at<br>another point in time and I think for<br>some students my catchphrase is like the<br>university has been here for over 150<br>years it's not going anywhere anytime<br>soon um take the time you need to get<br>yourself well and then come<br>back I think the point is to get them<br>before crisis mode if we can and that's<br>where the role of the academic really<br>comes in because we have that face<br>to-face contact on a regular basis with<br>our students and we may be one of the<br>only staff members that you've ever kind<br>of talked to and so there's some sort of<br>relationship there and I think I mean I<br>used to have lines and office hours and<br>now I don't I get lots of emails and I<br>think emails are great but then you<br>don't get that vine of hey do you need<br>anything else here so I always encourage<br>my students I even though there's 400<br>and something of them I tell them come<br>and see me in office hours happy to have<br>a chat about anything if you need a bit<br>of a a pep talk getting motivated if you<br>want to talk about study skills if you<br>want to talk about the content that's<br>fine too but we don't have to um we can<br>talk about rugby league if you want I'll<br>I'll do some research before you come<br>but it's really important to have that<br>open door policy and actually tell<br>students what office hours are then they<br>feel like oh so I can actually just go<br>and see you cuz there's this real<br>barrier with lecturers up the front and<br>often with Support Services too there's<br>a barrier there that we need to kind of<br>break down and encourage students to<br>take that first step and then when you<br>see a hint of something as academics I<br>believe we should be saying hey are you<br>okay I think I think it's really<br>important to to know the support<br>services that are available for students<br>in the first instance and then be able<br>to pass that information on I've got<br>tissues in my office I have to replace<br>them regularly I'm sure I'm not the only<br>one it's important to take care of our<br>students is that just you crying or is<br>it the students both of us I have used<br>them clear yeah no fair enough totally<br>yeah no look that that that's great<br>thank you um and and I imagine that you<br>you do it really well but it's quite<br>hard to do isn't it definitely and I'm<br>not trained in this area yeah and I had<br>a student one time who came in and and<br>broke down in my<br>office uh talked about suicide and<br>inside of me I just sort of crumbled cuz<br>all of a sudden there was all this guilt<br>on me and I was like I'm now responsible<br>for this person's life what on Earth do<br>I do I sort of quietened that and I<br>thought it's not actually about<br>me clearly and talked with the students<br>said how can I help and are you aware of<br>the chapy the student health um<br>Counseling Service o USA you know just<br>started listing things and that cuz I I<br>think different Services fit different<br>people as well absolutely so it's having<br>that wide range but it's scary because I<br>am not trained in it and I have seen so<br>many students an increasing number sadly<br>with mental health issues from major<br>issues to minor um even just anxiety or<br>nervousness or post breakup or whatever<br>is going on for them and they just need<br>help yeah yeah and and it I think you've<br>um really hit the nail on the head it<br>can be really scary and it can be it can<br>be scary when it's when it's just your<br>job can't it Melissa yeah absolutely<br>yeah absolutely um um in terms of<br>challenges we Face providing the<br>Pastoral Care um in our space well how<br>long have we got really but um there are<br>always a number of challenges and as a<br>service we really do pride ourselves on<br>providing a tangible academic support<br>service where I guess we're building a<br>relationship and rapport with a student<br>so we don't cookie cut a support we work<br>with individuals to provide that<br>academic learning support and I think<br>that's what sets us apart from other<br>services around the country and that we<br>do individualize the supports we offer<br>it can at times be challenging um the<br>main University obviously had a slight<br>decrease in numbers of students but for<br>us this year we've experienced a 12%<br>increase compared with last year um and<br>at its peak we experienced a 20%<br>increase so thankfully that's settled<br>down a little bit now but in terms right<br>now um what's on top for me is the exam<br>period and we're tracking at 50% of an<br>increase compared with other years so so<br>that's big another challenge that we<br>experience and you've already touched on<br>it Nicola is the prevalence of mental<br>illness and I think that's significantly<br>worse since coid um and a final<br>challenge I would have to say would be<br>those staff members who don't believe<br>pastoral care is their responsibility so<br>I'm going to go out on a limb and say<br>that I believe it's everybody's<br>responsibility on this campus I agree um<br>and if you're working at the University<br>you should be invested in supporting<br>students or at the very least have the<br>tools in your toolkit to know where to<br>refer students too if you don't um want<br>to have that courageous conversation<br>with students and touching on that I<br>think it's our responsibility as<br>academics to get to know people beyond<br>your own little bubble um opportunities<br>like this I now know Claire and Melissa<br>a lot better they'll be getting phone<br>calls from me saying I've got I've got a<br>student you know and I need your help<br>but that that barrier that exists<br>between academic and professional let's<br>just get rid of it we are a team we're<br>all working together the point is to<br>help these students to thrive at<br>University and succeed in whatever way<br>that that is for them so let's work<br>together and the more you get out of<br>your office and talk to people the more<br>you realize that these systems already<br>exist these people exist these amazing<br>people who do fantastic work and we<br>should be all with working together yeah<br>it's a I think I mean I think it's great<br>advice um one of the things that strikes<br>me when you're when you're talking about<br>that um the idea of getting to know your<br>students better and and asking those<br>questions having those courageous<br>conversations um there's another side of<br>that um and and I think it's it's<br>something else that we can fall into and<br>that's around boundaries and how how to<br>how to give care and and how to be<br>involved in your students uh life and<br>academic development without actually<br>extending Beyond those those boundaries<br>knowing your own limits knowing your own<br>limits yeah super important apply your<br>own face mask first before helping<br>others yeah that's that's that's true<br>too um and and knowing that that there<br>are people who whose job it is to to do<br>this stuff and if you start thinking<br>about the support services and you know<br>I'd focused on on student services<br>support services but there are Services<br>Beyond um my directorate as well um<br>there's international student support us<br>USA student support do an amazing job<br>and have the benefit of being very<br>Allied and integrated into the<br>university but not being part of the<br>system so so that they're really good at<br>coming and and telling us when maybe we<br>should be doing things differently and I<br>think that's a really important check<br>and balance um so so having having us as<br>part of your your tool Bel um to say<br>actually I don't know what to do with<br>this person um and and maybe I'm getting<br>too close to them um you know I'm I'm I<br>don't know I don't know what to do about<br>their home their home life um hand it<br>over to us absolutely we do know how to<br>help with with those things and so I I<br>guess that would be the message that I'd<br>want everyone to to to kind of hear so<br>how can we get that message out to<br>academics and general staff me um people<br>like across the university that if a<br>student comes to you and you have a<br>relationship with them how do you find<br>out who to talk to how do we how do we<br>deal with that because I know a lot of<br>people especially academics don't know<br>who to ask so one of the things um you<br>know one of the in institutional<br>challenges that we have at the moment in<br>the Pastoral Care space it's it's<br>actually a challenge and an opportunity<br>we had the Pastoral Care code and and<br>the code um makes it really explicit<br>that that well-being and safety and<br>student support is everyone's job if you<br>have anything to do with a student it's<br>part of your job um and that could just<br>be saying you know hello as you go past<br>or selling them a pie it's all part of<br>our our job right um and and so one of<br>the responses that the university has to<br>the Pastoral Care code um and it's seen<br>in the learner success plan as well is<br>to say okay we need to we need to make<br>sure that the that the holistic student<br>supports that have are transparent<br>transparent to everyone students will<br>make this complaint as well it's one of<br>the big challenges we have I didn't know<br>that you existed um how how you know how<br>do I find out about you I just kind of<br>accidentally found out about you and<br>it's a wicked problem actually it's a<br>super hard problem because um we we have<br>a kind of uh put everything online um<br>and we'll get a response we want to see<br>more pamphlets put more pamphlets out<br>there we have a response um actually we<br>don't want your why you destroying the<br>planet with these pamphlets you know we<br>want to have it online and and and so<br>some of these things they just are<br>difficult and they will continue to be<br>iterative and we'll we'll continue to<br>work on them but as part of the learner<br>success plan as part of our response to<br>the Pastoral Care code um we're creating<br>uh a network for um all staff in the<br>University uh where we can we can<br>hopefully have everyone every single<br>department will have at least one person<br>who puts their hand up to be a part of<br>the Pastoral Care Network and and there<br>we can get into Target Training um and<br>making sure that at least somebody in<br>your department is really of with<br>exactly who to go to and what the what<br>the supports are CU it's awareness right<br>I mean most academic staff that I know<br>personally when I mention the Pastoral<br>Care code they're unaware of it y they<br>do not know that it's their<br>responsibility to<br>to a place you everyone um so under the<br>Pastoral Care code um we legally obliged<br>to train you on the pastal care code uh<br>so we'll be doing that some rolling out<br>some training next year and some of that<br>will be online some of that will be in<br>person and some of that will be through<br>through this network as well um and and<br>and that will hopefully clarify all<br>these things that that that we're<br>talking about another exciting<br>initiative that I'm involved in is that<br>the Ministry of Health um have fun us to<br>create a onstop uh well-being shop um<br>and we're going to be doing that uh with<br>a with a an actual space on the denan<br>campus but also doing it virtually as<br>well so that yeah so that we we make<br>sure that that people know at least<br>where to start out and student services<br>have a have an approach that is no no<br>wrong door so coming the daughter<br>anywhere coming to Melissa's service<br>she'll be you know moving you along to<br>Haka if that's if that's what's required<br>working with you know them over to uh<br>international student support etc etc so<br>I'm really hopeful for some of those<br>things sounds awesome that we that we<br>can actually do a little bit better um<br>yeah so I think I think we have some<br>challenges obviously but we also have<br>what I'm hearing is people willing to<br>work together excited at the<br>opportunities to do that and also some<br>some<br>responses uh I I think from the<br>University as well um making sure that<br>we keep checking in with student voice<br>yeah really mindful of the fact that<br>we're Super Lucky at Oto about how well<br>we get on with our Student Association<br>they do amazing work for students and<br>and we have really good relationships<br>with them as as well um so those<br>networks of of students too that can<br>happen in the<br>department you you will have the the<br>disability um um student you you you<br>have an Advisory Group don't you Melissa<br>you want to tell us about that sure so<br>um at atago we have the atago disabled<br>students Association so they came back<br>into being in<br>2021 I believe that was um and it's<br>quite ironic that they were stagnant for<br>quite a while um because our service was<br>actually founded by a group of<br>passionate students on campus in the<br>early 90s that was the disability action<br>group called dag at that point in time<br>um so they advocated for our service to<br>come into being which it did um and then<br>now aago disabled students Association<br>is quite active um as is the national<br>disabled students Association and we're<br>very fortunate we have two of atago<br>represent on the national disabled<br>students Association so it's quite nice<br>to see how they've gone on and<br>flourished from their advocacy at<br>ataro um our vision is actually to work<br>in partnership with students so we'd be<br>doing a pretty rubbish job if we didn't<br>value student voice um so we have many<br>mechanisms that students can feed in<br>whether it be through the quality<br>advancement review um surveys our own<br>individual uh satisfaction surveys which<br>we do track pretty highly on not doing a<br>plug for DS and how great we are or<br>anything but pimping D um yeah so they<br>generally track over the the 90% in<br>terms of satisfaction there's always<br>room for improvement and we do value the<br>feedback we get from students and we<br>weave their feedback into our planning<br>for the next coming<br>year great thank you um so we've talked<br>about some of some of the challenges in<br>for in the department for an academic<br>you I think I I I might just touch a<br>little bit more on on some of the ones<br>for for the institution wide actually um<br>as well and I mentioned the Pastoral<br>Care code um so the Pastoral Care code<br>we we're legally um required to adhere<br>to um and you know these things that are<br>compliance driven um Can often feel like<br>why am I why am I speak spending time<br>doing that rather than doing the doing<br>but actually my view is that this this<br>really helps us to put a framework<br>around some of the work that we do<br>already I'm really confident in the<br>excellent pastoral care that Oto gives<br>both academic and professional staff but<br>what I'm not so confident is that a<br>student can find their way to it so<br>easily so something like the Pastoral<br>Care code um is really helpful actually<br>for for giving us um some kind of motiv<br>a to really make sure that that things<br>are as transparent as possible and I<br>think we we can see that too in Pata um<br>and and as I mentioned earlier the the<br>the learner success plan as well um we<br>have high need students um we have low<br>need students we have next to no need<br>students we we just have people so we're<br>going to be needing to respond to that<br>we are we are having some difficulties<br>as an institution um in terms of of<br>Health Care provision um but the whole<br>system is is is having trouble and<br>actually look at the University I look<br>at the work that student health does and<br>we we're actually helping um prop up a a<br>health system that that's problematic<br>and this is one of the kinds of<br>challenges that we have as well I think<br>that that we see um work that that maybe<br>should be going on in in in the health<br>system system that we're doing and and<br>and that you know kind of poses a little<br>bit of a challenge too um we have a real<br>desire and a real need to close the gaps<br>for underserved groups we have<br>traditionally had a number of groups<br>disabled students Marty students Pacific<br>students um rainbow students uh first<br>and family first and family absolutely<br>Refugee students there are a bunch of<br>people that that we really need to think<br>about do we need to tweak the way that<br>that we do that and that will that will<br>serve as a as a challenge but I think I<br>think an exciting kind of challenge for<br>us to meet really um okay so in terms of<br>pastoral care and opportunities and<br>challenges is there anything that either<br>of you would like to add I think I've<br>said all I need to say I I just<br>encourage all academics to listen to<br>their students um watch their students<br>for signs of anything when they come to<br>talk about the content um just you know<br>if they look upset ask if they're okay<br>and and learn about the people that you<br>need to learn about like yourselves in<br>terms of being able to refer on uh if<br>you're working in isolation you're<br>you're really not doing much so yeah<br>important to learn and reach out<br>fantastic thank you Melissa and for us<br>we always love the opportunity to raise<br>disability matters um across campus and<br>with the creation of AO disability<br>action plan that's again coming to a<br>space near you very soon um that will<br>actually I I My Hope Is that more staff<br>on campus will be more disability<br>confident as I mentioned we support<br>around 2,000 students so we have 15<br>staff members um in our office so you<br>can work out the ratio yourselves I'm<br>not a mathematician that may be more<br>your<br>space Lots um so yeah we do need it it<br>does take a village to support students<br>fantastic so you know the third topic<br>that we were going to talk about was<br>working together but I think we've<br>actually really covered a lot of that<br>and I might just sort of sum it up it's<br>it's possible for academics and<br>professional staff to have conversations<br>about these things without killing each<br>other we've managed to do it for a whole<br>you know nearly 40 minutes now so it is<br>two on one though yeah that's right we<br>we like those I'm holding my own yeah<br>you are holding your own um uh you know<br>I I do think there are opportunities for<br>us to work work better together um<br>as long as we keep putting the student<br>at the center of things I think that<br>we'll we'll get there rather than<br>thinking about what we need and how<br>we've already always done things and and<br>what is it that works for for our<br>systems it's if you say what actually<br>student what what do you need and how<br>and how do we help you um I think we can<br>we can make that transition involving<br>students in decision making developing<br>empathy absolutely I think it's critical<br>yeah yeah um investing in systems we<br>haven't actually Ted about that but but<br>we do need some systems um you know<br>that's a challenge for the organization<br>as well to make sure that rather than it<br>just being relational which is really<br>beneficial um actually having some kind<br>of Fail Safe Systems um to to ensure<br>that that no one falls through the<br>cracks um as well um so I've got my<br>final question for you before we go to<br>questions um and answers which is um<br>what are you optimistic about in the<br>I'm optimistic that student numbers are<br>going to continue to rise I'm optimistic<br>that the tertiary education commission<br>is going to give us more than<br>$500,000 a year to provide the academic<br>support we do it actually costs us far<br>more than that but um it's yeah I mean<br>I've worked in a small charitable trust<br>and there's never going to be enough<br>money so it's about being creative with<br>what you have um I'm optimistic that<br>students will continue to smash through<br>the glass ceiling um they will continue<br>to thrive they will get<br>jobs and our disability action plan is<br>going to be fantastic brilliant thank<br>you Nichola what are you optimistic<br>about I'm I'm optimistic about<br>everything clear it's just kind of how I<br>am um I'm really excited about the<br>learning success plan I think that is<br>just amazing I love that we have put<br>that together and I am so delighted to<br>see how it's going to play out over the<br>next 6 12 months what I can do to help<br>help what my colleagues can do to help<br>because it it's just so fantastic<br>because it's student centered and trying<br>to help them succeed as individuals<br>which is what we've been talking about<br>today I'm also optimistic about lowering<br>that that gap between us I I really I<br>see optimism there I think it's an<br>opportunity for a taro to really blend<br>and work together again with the student<br>at the center brilliant thank you I'm<br>optimistic about that too um I think the<br>the more we talk the more we know about<br>the challenges each of us have but also<br>the brilliant work that we're all doing<br>as well um and and we can only improve<br>it if we're communicating and and and<br>and really working on<br>on on surfacing up the challenges um<br>being creative about them and and and<br>really actually making sure that we we<br>show the care to the students that we we<br>have for them on a daily basis um so now<br>I think we're having some questions oo I<br>can't<br>hereo thank you panel that's been um<br>fantastic so Clea I just want to touch<br>on um something that you commented on<br>about our systems so how do we track the<br>students who don't approach with a<br>problem<br>um so they're not making use of those<br>contact hours they're not coming to the<br>support services either because they're<br>too shy they're a bit shamed orth they<br>don't know it exists so um how are we<br>identifying those people who are falling<br>between the cracks and what could we do<br>to<br>improve in the area thank you Kate<br>that's a really good question um so this<br>is where I think we need to be thinking<br>slightly long term to to invest um in<br>in in systems to to make sure that we<br>can actually do that right now we we do<br>what we can in terms of um identifying<br>people but but we need a a learning<br>management system that that we can we<br>can find out about whether people have<br>actually accessed things um we need to<br>have um other universities have some<br>really kind of interesting uh approaches<br>using data and and information um within<br>the first 3 weeks have you checked<br>Blackboard have you um actually you<br>know looked at something having an early<br>assignment say um and have you actually<br>engaged in that um if if we had that<br>information and and we had uh a kind of<br>system that that that could have that<br>oversight for us then we could respond<br>to it currently we have things like the<br>academic warning project which um uh we<br>make sure that that when we know first<br>semester um that some somebody hasn't<br>passed half of their papers that we<br>contact them but other universities are<br>able and we are not yet in that position<br>um that we are able to actually identify<br>and much more early warning kind of<br>triggers for for for actually um for<br>actually identifying that and acting on<br>it can I add to that oh sorry Melissa<br>you go first um I think it's it's the<br>biggest challenge really the students we<br>can't see y it's uncomfortable to know<br>that there are students out there that<br>are struggling and they don't come to us<br>and we can't see them they are in their<br>halls in their Flats maybe they've gone<br>home um it really is the biggest<br>challenge for academics and professional<br>staff to identify those students and<br>identify them early I think that early<br>intervention is absolutely critical it's<br>really difficult when I'm dealing with<br>hundreds and hundreds and hundreds of<br>students to notice if one isn't there<br>and I want to notice but the students<br>who fail and are unengaged and not<br>turning up they are the ones that we<br>need to be focusing on and trying to<br>help but how is the problem so some of<br>that that technical stuff the technology<br>coming in is going to be so helpful it's<br>necessary and needed and important<br>absolutely Melissa um so for us at the<br>beginning of the year we will draw down<br>a list of every student who's declared<br>it enrollment that they have a<br>disability impairment or medical<br>condition and we'll send them an email<br>of introduction to our service we also<br>mentioned some of the other student<br>services um that are available on campus<br>as well we respect that not all students<br>who have a disability want to access our<br>service and some people just want um to<br>have it notified on their enrollment<br>that they have a disability and then we<br>won't see them at all others we may see<br>semi frequently and others will only see<br>um us at exam time when they need<br>alternative test and exam Arrangements<br>um some students may choose to go alone<br>for semester 1 they're away from home<br>for the first time wife from Mom and Dad<br>or their family Faro caregivers Etc and<br>then they realize at the end of semester<br>that possibly a bit of academic support<br>would have been helpful um let's face<br>that we probably all made some<br>pretty dodgy decisions and I have<br>learned the most from those dodgy<br>decisions so everybody has the right to<br>make mistakes and learn from those<br>mistakes and excess support when they<br>need it I've never made a dodgy decision<br>I might be about to make one now though<br>Tim you've got a question I have clear<br>as as dean of learning and teaching I<br>just want to acknowledge a really<br>excellent quor I I love everything<br>you've said and I I love the values that<br>underpin everything you've said and and<br>I appreciate and share the optimism you<br>have so thank you very much uh quick<br>question for you Nica um I'm I've never<br>taught a class of 400<br>can you share any of those tips or<br>tricks about how you Foster a sense of<br>belonging in a lecture to 400 students<br>sure so first of all it's<br>about me enjoying what I do I think<br>that's important because if I'm<br>comfortable and I'm sharing my passion<br>for accounting which is is a lot and<br>it's a lot to take on um it's it's it's<br>about first of all me being comfortable<br>once I'm comfortable and I'm developing<br>that rapport with them we get it's a<br>it's a live experience it's such a an<br>amazing thing to experience every cohort<br>is different and you get this this room<br>full of people and initially they're<br>just staring at you like that's like<br>prove yourself and you come in and<br>you're like hi and you're open and body<br>language is so key and it's that that<br>open and engaging and I love what I do<br>and I care about you and your success in<br>my course and let's do this together and<br>it's language like that that really<br>really helps so it's it's choosing the<br>language it's having the body language<br>it's it's loving what you're doing if I<br>walk in and hate what I do then my<br>students hate what I say and they don't<br>really like me or my subject and I know<br>it shouldn't be about<br>me whether they like accounting but I'm<br>the gateway to them enjoying accounting<br>and then feeling like they're part of an<br>accounting course that gives them that<br>little bit of belonging that they need<br>just for that hour to feel good so<br>that's a start you just do about selling<br>accounting to me and I'm not a numbers<br>person come to my course come to my<br>course we have so much<br>fun<br>fantastic we've got no more questions<br>then okay Zoom audience you've let us<br>down with no questions um but thank<br>thank you very much um from the studio<br>audience um I think then we'll we'll<br>leave it there I I know that you could<br>uh all listen to us for hours and hours<br>um but to make that happen you're going<br>to have to contact our agents um and and<br>I think that we're going to head it big<br>after this so being guaranteed<br>guaranteed um look I'd really like to<br>thank both um Melissa and Nicola um for<br>your wisdom and for your insights it's<br>been really good to talk to you today<br>about about this um you know it is it is<br>a topic that's close to my heart and I<br>think it's a topic that's close um to<br>many many people's hearts and we we<br>really need to keep talking about it<br>actually so that that we make sure that<br>we do this as best as as we possibly can<br>for for our students um I'd like to<br>thank the audience um and I'd also like<br>to thank the online viewers for your<br>questions uh I'd like to thank the<br>committee for the advancement of<br>learning and teaching for supporting<br>this Cordo series as well as the media<br>production team for making the magic<br>happen it's hard to believe that<br>together we have a combined age of<br>792 but through incredible technology we<br>look like half of it um look tune in uh<br>again for the next episode of C Coro or<br>just watch this one over and over and<br>over again until then no or<br>my<br>you</p></main><footer style="margin-top: 2rem; background: #0001; padding: 2rem; text-align: center;"><p>We Are The University</p><ul style="list-style-type: none; padding: 0; margin:
