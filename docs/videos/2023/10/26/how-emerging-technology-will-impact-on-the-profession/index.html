to be here when I see those<br>who've come before me and uh I'm I I<br>especially make mention of a Meritus<br>Professor the former Attorney General<br>and and I know what it's like to be an<br>attorney so Margaret Wilson The<br>Honorable Margaret Wilson thank you for<br>coming thank you to Norris Ward McKinnon<br>for the invitation to deliver this<br>lecture and for all that this firm has<br>done to further legal<br>education I acknowledge the faculty of<br>Law and W University for its support uh<br>thank you I also acknowledge W tyui iwi<br>and I'll digress a little for the last<br>10 years I've represented the crown in a<br>long running series of arbitrations<br>between waat tyui nahu and the crown and<br>the results of which are generally<br>private but sometimes public and there<br>have been a series of decisions and<br>agreements which both sides say have<br>been helpful to clarify the meaning of<br>their treaty settlements we're actually<br>up to round<br>nine uh not only their treaty<br>settlements but the relativity<br>mechanisms of in each of those now many<br>of you will know this but some might um<br>not that some of those decisions have<br>resulted in very significant payments to<br>e and there are only uh two e uh that<br>have these relative relativity<br>mechanisms<br>wui and<br>nahu and the process and the benefits<br>that resulted are testimony in large<br>part to the foresight in the commercial<br>Acumen of wo tyui in particular Sir<br>Robert mahuta and and one could write a<br>book on that that was the first historic<br>treaty settlement and as I say one of<br>only two that have this mechanism so<br>congratulations W tyui uh and my<br>respects to them my focus this evening<br>obviously is how will technology impact<br>on the law and the legal profession in<br>particular some matters which I think<br>are going to influence um uh immediately<br>and<br>significantly as solic general as you<br>heard from 2012 to 2016 I did have some<br>influence in bringing Crown Law and the<br>government legal Network into the<br>digital age and as uh you've heard since<br>2016 I've been at the bar but I also um<br>and my wife Katherine thank you has has<br>born with me I've been involved in three<br>technology startups two of which are in<br>the legal area if you know anything<br>about start startups you all know that<br>most don't succeed so it's a victory of<br>sorts even to remain in business so I'm<br>going to claim that Victory and one of<br>the things you learn rather rapidly is<br>very hard to change behavior and that is<br>so true for lawyers and the legal<br>system so with that theme of change uh I<br>wanted to focus on the digital strategy<br>that we've heard about Ono reca which is<br>the case management system that's uh<br>about to be rolled out and marama uh<br>which we've heard in previous lectures a<br>very important initiative uh in in the<br>uh particularly in the district<br>courts and along the way I'm going to<br>talk a little bit about artificial<br>intelligence you couldn't comment on<br>this subject without<br>it uh t marama as I said was the subject<br>of the excellent earlier lectures from<br>chief judge uh to Manu and Judge John<br>Walker and there's a lot in there that I<br>want to touch about so in Broad summary<br>I'm going to cover the digital strategy<br>I'm going to cover Tor reca and what<br>that might mean and I'm going to cover<br>how these might interact with te marama<br>and can they<br>coexist and fourth I'm going to touch<br>upon just some of the challenges that<br>arise from these transformative<br>initiatives so some of the challenges<br>obviously arise from the New Zealand<br>Bill of Rights Act uh issues relating to<br>Tia and I would say immediately I'm not<br>qualified and won't give a view on that<br>but I would like to raise some issues<br>which are obvious to me I want to talk<br>about artificial intelligence and I want<br>to talk about workplace pressure uh<br>which I think will be<br>relevant but my central point my thesis<br>is the digital strategy for the courts<br>is a marvelous step forward and that<br>teor reca I hope will be<br>transformational it is in my view<br>imperative that TOA is successful and<br>widely embraced but bear in mind of<br>course that paper's going to be around<br>for a long time<br>yet in in in my view it's critical to<br>the future of our court system that t<br>reca succeeds and if it doesn't work<br>then fewer and fewer people will obtain<br>Justice from the courts and more and<br>more will go elsewhere and I'll talk<br>about that a bit more I also believe<br>that t Rea and T marama are compatible<br>and can coexist and can strengthen each<br>other I note for completeness of course<br>that the proof of that will take many<br>many years to play out so like a<br>politician I can be as optimistic as I<br>like uh and I immediately acknowledge<br>that there are really big challenges<br>ahead for all involved toor reca will<br>not be all positive it will not be all<br>plain sailing in order for it to work we<br>all are going to have to change our<br>habits and we're going to have to<br>challenge<br>ourselves and one of the aspects I'll<br>comment on is that for lawy and judges<br>in my view it's going to involve<br>increased pressure at least until it<br>becomes second nature and I'll come back<br>to why so as we heard earlier just<br>coming to the digital strategy in late<br>22 Justice Godard who who leads this for<br>the Judiciary released a draft for<br>consultation he cons consulted widely uh<br>in particular with Al you know the<br>profession judges lawy<br>Etc uh in March as we've heard the Chief<br>Justice released the final strategy and<br>and in that Heron<br>said the Judiciary is responsible for<br>administering Justice through the courts<br>and providing just outcomes for all<br>people to achieve this court proceedings<br>must be simple accessible And<br>Timely well all of us know that is a<br>real challenge they heror went on to say<br>they must be conducted in a way that<br>enables all people to fully participate<br>in the proceedings that affect them<br>again a huge<br>challenge Heron said using technology<br>wisely has the potential to be<br>transformative technology will help<br>address the<br>challenges and went on to give examples<br>experienced by people with disabilities<br>people who are neurodiverse people who<br>have English English is a second<br>language and people for whom cost or<br>family and work commitments make it hard<br>to travel to<br>hearings so the digital strategy is all<br>about the judiciary's objectives and<br>guiding principles for the use of<br>Technology again in the strategy it says<br>the processes must be capable of<br>delivering just outcomes for all members<br>of our society and these words again in<br>a simple accessible timely<br>manner so what's the current state well<br>your honors here will know well and the<br>litigators here will know well it it it<br>may not surprise anyone to know that the<br>courts and most tribunals work with<br>paper files not all the white tongy<br>tribunal Works incredibly well digitally<br>um but you may be surpris surprised to<br>know that the official record of every<br>court is a paper<br>file all judges and all court lawyers<br>have experienced the difficulty of lost<br>files at a case not so long ago where<br>the district court and high court<br>disagreed about where the file was and<br>neither of them had it um so we've we've<br>all seen that uh in addition<br>participants are not able to see the<br>progress of a case<br>online you there's a lack of flexibility<br>to allocate resources because of course<br>the<br>file is in one court and it can't be<br>seen by<br>others and we have to remember and this<br>is not a criticism but the courts are<br>not focused on efficiency it's fair to<br>say courts and we all are struggling<br>with that and yet the district court and<br>the high court legislation<br>at least requires the Chief Judges to<br>ensure the orderly and efficient conduct<br>of the Courts at the same time they<br>don't get given the tools to do that uh<br>let me give you just some<br>examples um and because that's on a<br>massive screen I'll just see if I can<br>online um<br>just compare that data the number of<br>finalized criminal charges this is from<br>data and these all coincide with the<br>start of the district court when it<br>became the district court from the<br>magistrates court it's quite striking<br>that you and it I'll show you a graph in<br>a minute just to see those<br>numbers<br>there's a bit of a blip but generally<br>it's trending<br>down so from<br>355 350,000 roughly finalized criminal<br>charges down to<br>193 but at the same time the population<br>increases by more than 2 million in 1981<br>we had far<br>fewer magistrates judges far fewer now<br>we have 180 many of whom not all but<br>many are doing criminal work and it's<br>not because the courts aren't working<br>hard they definitely are the judges here<br>will um evidence that but the cases are<br>more complex they take longer they've<br>got more procedural steps and our system<br>efficient<br>so that is one aspect that's just the<br>criminal cases the stats for civil<br>matters unfortunately don't pay a better<br>picture in short people do not use the<br>district court very rarely use the<br>district court for ordinary money claims<br>its jurisdiction is up to<br>$350,000 now you imagine in a a matter<br>where you were owed<br>$300,000 and you literally cannot afford<br>to litigate that in the district<br>court you have what I would call a grim<br>Confluence of a growing need an<br>inefficient service no<br>disrespect an aging Workforce look at<br>many of us and an inability to<br>pay and so really we we we're staring at<br>the train coming down towards us and we<br>have to adopt digital systems and it's<br>easy to see if they're working properly<br>and it's a big of what they could do for<br>transparency for efficiency for<br>resilience for the carbon footprint for<br>just updating and keeping<br>current so the strategy addresses okay<br>well what do we want from this<br>um and it's got some guiding principles<br>as you'd expect core consistent with<br>core values consistent with core<br>constitutional<br>responsibilities judicial for example<br>judicial control of the information<br>keeping it separate from the executive<br>the<br>ministry people centered inclusive<br>reliable secure transparent flexible<br>implementable it's got to actually work<br>properly supported training Etc<br>datadriven based on proven Solutions<br>we're not going to build Ed ourselves<br>thanks so they're not really asking for<br>much are they the Judiciary here it's<br>reasonably<br>straightforward<br>um it's<br>daunting the demand is<br>daunting and Tor Rea which literally<br>translates as the sweet<br>flow and some of you litigators might<br>chuckle uh the current system has never<br>been described as The Sweep flow but it<br>should be that way so the Tor reca is um<br>and I'll come to a bit more detail but<br>fundamentally it's the digital case<br>management system end to end that<br>creates and maintains the court files a<br>fully digital document management case<br>management system and much more<br>obviously the portal to get things in<br>the assistance to manage it through the<br>process and then managing the output and<br>of course integrating audio visual Etc<br>and those are some of the other aspects<br>of the broad strategy remote hearing<br>technology we all know about that we<br>know how fickle that can be at the<br>moment great when it works terrible when<br>it doesn't reliable physical Network<br>infrastructure and the training and<br>support to deliver this<br>now forgive me for telling you uh those<br>who know this well you also have to<br>remember that this is being delivered by<br>the Judiciary and the ministry and<br>remember that Judiciary are responsible<br>for the conduct of the business of the<br>courts and the ministry are responsible<br>for funding providing and operating the<br>system so my sporting background says<br>okay well I'll I'll give you a sporting<br>analogy the Jud judges are the referees<br>on the field and they control the rules<br>of the game and they control how we<br>watch the<br>game but the ministry provides the<br>ground the stadium funds the security<br>the ticketing the catering the<br>broadcast and the technology to make<br>sure the game can take<br>place so nothing is more apparent than<br>the two work to have to work together to<br>deliver this<br>and therefore toor reca obviously is a<br>joint judicial and Ministry project the<br>procurement process started in October<br>of 2022 and it finished in August of<br>this year some may have seen it in the<br>media of the contract was awarded to DXE<br>technology who are a Microsoft partner<br>and will deliver Microsoft<br>Technology um there are two other New<br>Zealand compan companies that are<br>involved one of which I'm the chair of<br>which is<br>immediation uh it's a platform based<br>product so they're building uh<br>particular applications on top of<br>applications it from what I've seen thus<br>far it is immensely powerful but the<br>proof will be in the delivery the<br>ministry of justice of State the<br>estimated cost is around 170 million at<br>this stage it's a very significant<br>project and I'll come back to a bit more<br>but thinking about the strategy and just<br>what are likely<br>implications uh might just show you now<br>this is a little hard to read but<br>um this is the future state of of what<br>we're aiming for in the family<br>court and and if you focus on the top<br>line it's really about taking out the<br>paper and enhancing the process for the<br>user so you come on you you come into<br>the system on a portal you can get help<br>either by digital methods or or phone uh<br>you you follow step by step instructions<br>if you put in information once that's<br>all you need need to do it you<br>information other agencies can be joined<br>as necessary you can imagine in the<br>Family Court there is notifications<br>online of course depends if there are<br>email text uh provided but provided<br>you've got that digital case management<br>automated scheduling automated workflow<br>there's a lot in this Tech enabled<br>alternate dispute resolution and<br>Conference ing interactive wayf finding<br>including physical and then a hearing in<br>court which might be a hybrid might be<br>physical might be online and then a<br>determination entered in the system out<br>to the parties published in accordance<br>with the court rules and augmented<br>transcription<br>state<br>now of course that's going to be<br>incredibly challenging Judiciary Court<br>staff legal profession will need to be<br>flexible as they adapt and the ministry<br>is really going to have to develop its<br>capacity to support it depends on all<br>sorts of other branches of government<br>one of which is key the executive uh<br>sticking with this project through thick<br>and thin because it's going to be tough<br>KL crafer the chief Operating Officer um<br>in the ministry uh and I'm quoting him<br>said the project was the most<br>significant change in Court's history<br>and I'm quoting him again so we wouldn't<br>want anybody to underestimate how big<br>this is he said not just for court staff<br>this is the interface with the<br>profession with Judiciary for staff<br>police Corrections everybody now there<br>are some incredibly obvious challenges<br>and you you will have pied them one they<br>will be driving the car whilst changing<br>big parts of the engine and the wheels<br>possibly and we we know how hard and<br>I've said that it is to change habit<br>practice and the current status quo it<br>it takes a massive impetus a pandemic<br>for example to get AV hearings across<br>the line so and if you think of a lot of<br>the people that Mr cfer mentioned Court<br>stuff legal profession Judiciary uh like<br>me north of 50 we're not digital natives<br>this is not our uh it's not our um<br>ordinary<br>game in fact it's going to be incredibly<br>positive and will create a lot of legal<br>tech jobs for those are capable because<br>frankly no disrespect but I find it a<br>lot easier to get someone a lot younger<br>than me who knows what they're doing and<br>I suspect law firms the court will do<br>exactly<br>that and I'm not being flippen but let's<br>face it almost none of our generation<br>really understand how the technology<br>works I mean I myself don't know how my<br>fridge or my toaster works but I use<br>them every day and I'm satisfied they do<br>um and and it will be the<br>same the other pressure which I've<br>talked about is that lawyers know that<br>fewer and fewer senior lawyers are<br>willing to provide Legal Aid Services<br>and I I welcome my colleague Philip<br>Morgan KC who over the years has done<br>incredible service in this area and in<br>fact did a massive service for me as<br>solic general when I appointed him to<br>lead the Lundy retrial which he was<br>reminding me about and then I was sent<br>down to court to check how it was going<br>by the then attorney who was a little<br>bit nervous as they sometimes get I'm<br>not sure if you remember that Margaret<br>but uh sometimes they get nervous about<br>cases and that was just happened to be<br>one anyway but there are fewer and fewer<br>people who are like Mr Morgan casy and<br>are willing to do it and primarily<br>that's because it's extremely low<br>remuneration and the paperwork is<br>massive and literally paperwork you<br>might have seen the recent media about<br>the increase in self-represented<br>litigant in particular in the family<br>court I just show you<br>this the number of people representing<br>themselves in the family court has more<br>than doubled in the last 10<br>years more than<br>70% of civil cases in the district court<br>involved a self-represented<br>party and you can just see those numbers<br>is about More than<br>70% and that was<br>7,232 cases in that last<br>year um 72% involved a self-represented<br>litigon compared to much less 3,000 odd<br>less about 50% in<br>2015 um most lawyers and judges will in<br>a Frank moment and I'll be frank tell<br>tell you that self-represented litigants<br>are the ban of their existence they are<br>bad for our system in so many ways uh<br>I'm not saying they can't be there but<br>they're bad for our system because<br>ultimately they're not able to focus<br>they can't refine the issues they don't<br>know what's relevant and what is not<br>they cannot separate the emotion from<br>the issue and for all those reasons the<br>real problem is they take up much more<br>time than their case deserves<br>lawyers and judges are obliged to bend<br>over backwards and they do to help them<br>despite we know all of this most<br>litigant and person I'm sure are<br>reasonable people who can't afford a<br>lawyer some are unreasonable each<br>deserves a fair process but not to the<br>exclusion of other court users and this<br>is where the problem lies they take up<br>more than their fair share of the<br>resource and time of judges uh Court<br>staff<br>others so the the opportunity there for<br>technology is massive I probably don't<br>need to convince anyone of that<br>automation online guidance online<br>alternate dispute resolution and other<br>digital tools such as chatbots AI<br>automatic service referrals and other<br>useful prompts that's where we can make<br>huge advances and Tor reca has the<br>capability to do that uh I'm not saying<br>it necessarily will it has the<br>capability<br>um now there are many companies working<br>on this some of us have been banging on<br>about it for years uh for example in<br>Canada just by way of one example this<br>is the Civil resolution tribunal and<br>this is their process it's uh entirely<br>online for small civil matters and they<br>run through uh pretty pretty much an<br>automated<br>system they're using technology which T<br>reca will will bring it introduces much<br>more and may perhaps it's an opportunity<br>for us online assistance online<br>negotiation facilitation and ultimately<br>judicial decision<br>making and two of the companies I've<br>started in New Zealand of mediation and<br>agreeable are fundamentally about that<br>more affordable faster simple access to<br>high quality legal services and access<br>to Justice and really they're about<br>replacing physical attendance where<br>appropriate with<br>digital and of course and I'll come to<br>this in a wee bit more detail the<br>digital strategy doesn't cover<br>everything and the devil is in the<br>detail fundamental matters such as<br>teer fear hearing New Zealand Bill of<br>Rights Act requirements the limit<br>limitations the appropriate limitations<br>on AI usage and I'll come back a bit to<br>that these things need a lot of work<br>they need to be considered tested<br>refined<br>embedded a and fundamentally worked on<br>in partnership with the right people um<br>and just by way of example there's<br>mention of TI and the strategy but not<br>much in the way of how this is going to<br>be incorporated I knowe both the<br>previous lectures chief judge Tom Manu<br>and Judge John Walker they're excellent<br>lectures they they talk about<br>transforming the system reimagining the<br>system and also about<br>technology and Judge John Walker made<br>the very important point about the<br>tension between technology and<br>procedural<br>fairness uh the degradation of the human<br>connection when AVL is involved<br>and a best practice requirement for<br>substantive proceedings of kohi<br>kohi uh under the ti marama model and<br>that of course will be a feature an<br>ongoing feature but as honor said well<br>we need to weigh the benefits of<br>efficiency in a d Digital model against<br>the right to a fair process and a right<br>to physical presence and that's<br>undoubtedly so it's going to provide<br>an interesting tension but in fact the<br>courts deal with it<br>already obviously the one of the<br>fundamental principles of our justice<br>system is people must have a fair<br>hearing for criminal matters that's<br>section 25 of U of Bora the right to a<br>fair and public hearing by an<br>independent and impartial court and in<br>civil matters procedural fairness and<br>the right to the observance of the<br>principles of natural Justice<br>it's implicit obviously that fair<br>hearing or Fair trial is<br>guaranteed once Tor reca is implemented<br>we're going to see that tested I'm sure<br>are these processes substantively<br>fair but in my submission the courts are<br>already actually dealing with that on a<br>regular basis dealing with complainants<br>Witnesses Etc giving evidence by<br>alternate methods or evidence being<br>admitted despite but not being able to<br>be tested in the usual<br>way now the strategy also contemplates<br>in the longer term the use of AI<br>tools uh to provide and this is quoting<br>from the strategy to provide guidance to<br>parties on potential<br>outcomes to assist parties and decision<br>makers to identify relevant materials<br>and organize and analyze these materials<br>now that's already contemplated and I I<br>can uh say has been discussed in the<br>procurement<br>process um for<br>example IM imagine as a judge if you had<br>the ability to automatically summarize<br>thousands of pages of evidence and<br>Exhibits accurately the ability to sort<br>the documents into sequence grouping<br>chronological or otherwise there ability<br>to create a draft of a decision an order<br>a<br>minute and anyone who's used chat GPT or<br>bang or Bard will know both the power<br>and the limitations of those I mean I'm<br>sure many of you are using Ai and and<br>sort of laughing or or or liking what<br>what you get sometimes um<br>and in my view inevitably it's going to<br>be a feature of this process this<br>process is about the quality exchange of<br>information and exercise of judgment<br>parts of which you would think can<br>clearly benefit from large language<br>models and all they<br>offer and and I did it in preparation<br>for this saying to Bing well pretend<br>you're a judge with the arguments set<br>out below and write me a judgment<br>granting the application for the reason<br>set out in the applicants argument and<br>Bing duly does<br>it now Bing is a Microsoft product and<br>TOA uses a Microsoft platform Microsoft<br>applications so it's not hard to<br>imagine it will provide massive<br>opportunities but also massive uh<br>risks and some of the opportunities are<br>obvious of course the ability to work in<br>your preferred language when inter<br>interacting with the court<br>digitally uh<br>Tero Pacifica languages Mandarin those<br>are in the uh well I've I've seen the um<br>prototype uh and that's what they can do<br>um the availability of real time help<br>through chat Bots online guides pop up<br>uh you you all will have seen them in<br>help T automated forms automated and<br>this is incredibly powerful automated<br>work<br>allocation and rostering and<br>scheduling I'll come back to that but<br>working out who has time and which<br>quarters available and what AV<br>facility that takes a lot of time now<br>that will be<br>automated um and of course I've talked<br>about some other examples and I'll give<br>you a a frivolous example of there is a<br>lot more coming I'm not saying TAA but<br>technology<br>generally some of you may have seen that<br>meta Facebook have just uh announced the<br>release of their new glasses in<br>conjunction with<br>Rayban and you'll all know the Wayfair<br>as I imagine uh they allow for video<br>audio and realtime AI assistance for the<br>wearer so you can look at a document and<br>say meta what's that you can look at a<br>person meta who's that you can look at<br>uh a language or a written document meta<br>translate uh and think of the<br>opportunity for I immediately think well<br>what if you're a witness and you're<br>wearing that or a<br>judge uh real time translation AI<br>assistance for<br>questions how will the judge deal with<br>the witness who says yes I need to wear<br>these glasses because I have a cognitive<br>impairment I might try it as counsel<br>actually I'm I'm over 50 your honor the<br>brain I need these and how do you deal<br>with that it it's fascinating um and<br>they're available in the US at the the<br>middle of October us<br>us300 for those<br>glasses now coming back to the more<br>prosaic and mundan TAA I talked about<br>the vendor the vendor selected dxc which<br>is a Microsoft partner two others<br>company mediation and CYO it it's fair<br>to say it was an incredibly detailed and<br>rigorous process in my view from the<br>outside uh it will be an effective<br>partnership between Ministry Judiciary<br>and the tech companies it's it's an<br>absolutely massive project and extremely<br>challenging and in due course further<br>details will be released but we know<br>that it starts in the family court and<br>consultation has started about well what<br>are what are the principles that govern<br>it for<br>lawyers and I found it quite useful to<br>read through these and think okay what<br>mean first and foremost lawyers will<br>have to use<br>it and if you send something in by paper<br>or email it's not going to be accepted<br>barring exigencies I.E the systems down<br>but lawyers will have to use<br>it if you're<br>required to file a<br>document that is met by<br>providing the the<br>information to T reca<br>doesn't matter how many copies what form<br>or where if you put it in the system<br>that<br>does doesn't affect the right to pay the<br>fee I'm sorry but um a requirement to<br>serve a document will be<br>met if the person has said yes I I agree<br>except service or if they have a<br>lawyer so you don't need to serve you<br>need to put it on the<br>system you don't have to provide<br>information more than once you can just<br>confirm that it's<br>there signing<br>digital<br>witnessing potentially digital we'll see<br>but it's it's there and I'm anxious and<br>many are that these principles are<br>further developed and enlarged so that<br>we don't have to have forms behind glass<br>that they talk about or a replication of<br>the old procedures and the obvious is<br>the swearing of affidavits and<br>declarations so I'm AR I'm arguing and<br>I've made this argument to the powers<br>that be I'm not sure I'm very persuasive<br>at the moment but that affidavit should<br>be able to be sworn digitally uh one of<br>the companies I'm involved with<br>agreeable we we uh swear we witness<br>documents digitally they are encrypt Ed<br>with the photo of the person signing<br>them at the time with IP addresses Etc<br>and the lawyer who's certifying that I<br>have witnessed that doing the same in my<br>view that's good enough and I don't see<br>the need for deponents to have to go off<br>to a lawyer an independent lawyer and<br>front up to a person they've got no idea<br>you know really does it really add um<br>why can't we have a process where even<br>if it was recorded and it shows the<br>person promising that the information<br>they're putting in is true and the<br>lawyer or the registr saying well I've<br>seen their<br>identification and I've seen them online<br>saying that it was<br>true do we get more from doing it in<br>person I'm not<br>sure um I'll just check uh how we're<br>going for time do anyone have the time<br>readily<br>available<br>709 good well I I wanted to talk a<br>little bit about Tor MMA but I'll I'm<br>going to be incredibly brief um because<br>when the chief judge talked about T<br>marama he said that the district court<br>should be a place where all people can<br>come to to seek Justice no matter what<br>their means or ability and regardless of<br>their culture or ethnicity who they are<br>or where they're from his honor said our<br>ultimate intention will be to ensure to<br>the maximum extent possible that the<br>best available information is presented<br>to our judges to assist them to make<br>well-informed decisions about the people<br>who appear before<br>them<br>and essentially in his honor is<br>excellent and I recommend it to you<br>speech he said that all these reports<br>since the 1980s have said while the<br>courts are failing to understand those<br>who appear before it or who are affected<br>by the court business in essence and he<br>was talking about criminal defendants<br>Faro and victims are leaving the current<br>system feeling<br>unheard and unappreciated<br>now in my paper there will be a a lot<br>more difficulty but in my view it's no<br>overstatement that<br>technology can<br>assist and possibly get in the way of<br>almost every single aspect of TI Mar and<br>how may it coexist well it it's to deal<br>with the many dilemmas that we have of<br>people not being able to participate and<br>not properly being heard or understood<br>now<br>that comes down to fundamentally this<br>question about must<br>we tooh or can we work in a hybrid<br>sometimes for the right cases or online<br>for the right<br>matters and partly it comes down to the<br>question of is the court a place or a<br>service or both and I would submit it's<br>both and this was a theme from Judge<br>Walker and it's something that we've<br>seen for example experts in mediation<br>said you can't have a mediation without<br>people in the same room then came Co and<br>we had plenty of them um<br>so the chief judge talked about t Mara<br>and he talked about when people attend<br>the court they must enter through the<br>front entrance in a Mari context this is<br>similar to people gathering at the wahar<br>the front entrance of a<br>marai and he is on said I expect the<br>bilingual and we appropriate<br>multilingual greetings by all Court<br>staff and from the first time first<br>Contact is made it will be a natural and<br>appropriate development and of course<br>that's an important part but if you<br>think of the vision Chie of the chief<br>judge's Vision in modern pance that<br>could be for some people through a<br>website or a portal coming through the<br>front door in their native language<br>guided by timely plain language<br>assistance and then contributing to the<br>process or the hearing when and how they<br>want to all on a mobile device that is<br>what TOA will<br>allow in my view the courts are full of<br>the best legal brains we have and full<br>of<br>hardworking high quality court stuff but<br>we don't have to limit ourselves to<br>going there to see them<br>um there's no cogent reason in my<br>submission I set out some more reasons<br>for this that the aims of to MMA cannot<br>be met by different<br>methods of being hurt where<br>appropriate<br>um I've got some cautions which I'm<br>going to uh skip over uh I would say<br>there is a lot of controversy around<br>some things in the courts at the moment<br>section 27 report reports for offenders<br>and maybe uh we can achieve the original<br>aims of those is actually having people<br>heard by way of recorded video by way of<br>Av instead of these expensive time<br>consuming written reports I don't know<br>um in my paper I deal with some issues<br>around te hunger and obviously I'm not<br>qualified to talk on that but I'm just<br>quoting some of the academic research as<br>to how Tik might be incorporated and<br>essentially that's hard work now with<br>the people that do understand<br>it my final point and I'll finish with<br>this and hopefully it's not too Doom me<br>but the increased pressure uh at least<br>in the intermediate is is sort of<br>obvious we we're going to<br>see the ease of filing materials and the<br>ease of getting them available and<br>allocating them and all this and<br>allocating rostering and work um and<br>judges and I know having spoken to one<br>uh last week he said wow hang on so<br>we're going to see work just popping up<br>in our diary and then we'll have a link<br>and the entire file is there yep that's<br>right lists hearings other dates<br>automatic<br>populated and that's a little bit<br>frightening with respect um<br>and maybe we're going to see a less<br>downtime less space for the normal<br>activities that lawyers and judges are<br>involved with chatting to<br>colleagues maybe with audiovisual<br>digital we're going to<br>see slight more opportunity to become<br>isolated I don't know but<br>the system is data driven as you saw<br>from the principles you can measure<br>everything<br>so whilst there's going to be a lot more<br>flexibility judges might hold the<br>hearing<br>remotely and just one point coming back<br>to T Mara digital enables far less<br>formality that's what T marama talks<br>about I mean who amongst us hasn't<br>attended a zoom hearing with a mismatch<br>of bottom and top now and we don't need<br>to stand and bow in the digital world<br>and maybe it's right for some cases<br>anyhow my final point is just<br>that the<br>digital and many of us will experience<br>this is a more<br>intense environment in some ways it's a<br>more relaxed environment and less formal<br>but I don't know about you but when<br>you've had 6 hours in a digital hearing<br>you are tired and it is intense<br>so in summary and thank you for<br>listening to me tonight and for the<br>privilege of being here I'm a strong<br>supporter of the digital strategy and ta<br>reca I believe it can work well and even<br>enhanced tail Mama but it is<br>going to be a huge Challenge and we will<br>need to be patient open to change and<br>curious for it to succeed I'm confident<br>but I'm also a touch anxious so thank<br>you very much for having me<br>so this is the Q&amp;A section of the<br>evening that talk that talk<br>was I'm sure for many of you especially<br>it was for me<br>really set off a lot of a lot of avenues<br>of thought which I'm sure I'll be<br>thinking about for the days to come but<br>like to invite anyone who has questions<br>before I pile them with my own questions<br>too thank you Jesse um and thank you so<br>much for a very interesting lecture<br>indeed I I'm very fascinated by the idea<br>and I'm not surprised that it's here uh<br>I think this is expected that we would<br>go um digital at some stage in the near<br>future and it's excellent to see that<br>that that work is in prog<br>uh I have a comment a recommendation in<br>a question so my comment is that uh we<br>hear uh from parties going to the family<br>court for example about the experience<br>of engaging with the legal system where<br>some might find themselves totally<br>clueless as to what went on and why the<br>judge has made the decision they did so<br>there's been a study that's been done by<br>this<br>and that was the finding that a lot of<br>people go to the family court and they<br>don't know what has happened with their<br>case in the outcome that's my comment my<br>recommendation is that just like we<br>employ a flexy mode of learning at the<br>University of wo where we cater to to<br>students who are uh on site in the<br>lecture theater who are online listening<br>to the lecture live streamed and those<br>who have other commitments that can<br>listen to our lectures at their own time<br>so they have the flexibility of<br>accessing our service with these options<br>and I think it's a great way of moving<br>forward because that's where the future<br>is and that's what people want and the<br>demand is being met so I would recommend<br>a system like that where people who feel<br>the need to engage with the code system<br>in person get that option and those who<br>have other commitments that would like<br>to utilize the online system that they<br>can do that as well my question to you<br>is uh with sub<br>platforms some platforms are more prone<br>to cyber attacks than<br>others um if we are going to have this<br>digitized<br>system how are you going to ensure that<br>if there is a Cyber attack or something<br>that there is going to be a backup that<br>your system is going to be safe and<br>secure so that's my question thank you<br>oh thank you um<br>firstly um it certainly won't be me or<br>any<br>lawyer and it's a great question um one<br>often thinks about the security of one<br>your own laptop or your own and then you<br>think of the size and scale and power of<br>a company like Microsoft and you think<br>okay well how much must they throw at<br>the security of systems that they're<br>building now we all know that nothing is<br>is fail proof but Microsoft them<br>themselves are building a at least one<br>data center in Orland they already have<br>data centers around Australia and you<br>would imagine that there will be uh fail<br>safes and backups<br>around that I don't I don't know the<br>detail but I do know that the ministry<br>and the Judiciary and Microsoft and DXE<br>have spent weeks and months on exactly<br>that so we'll see it's it's something I<br>mean almost no one's immune the New<br>Zealand Stock Exchange you know went<br>down for days and some other very<br>high-profile companies have been is<br>those denial of service attacks think<br>worrying yeah I mean why C dhb had that<br>issue recently<br>comment Bridge offshore uh that will<br>impede with our privacy laws as well and<br>the parties need to be aware that their<br>data is being stored offshore so that's<br>something to consider as well yeah thank<br>you absolutely and the um um you know<br>obviously I can't go into the detail of<br>the procurement process but data<br>sovereignty was a very big part of that<br>so I'm pretty sure they have that<br>covered there also obviously T of<br>concerns about D Storage are those being<br>yeah well uh in my paper I touch upon<br>that the the T and aspects of that<br>and we'll see but that's something that<br>I would recommend people start thinking<br>about<br>it<br>presentation um it appears that one of<br>the challenges through Co for the<br>medical profession and all the delivery<br>of uh their<br>efforts um regarding assistance of all<br>types was that actually a large<br>proportion of those in need in New<br>Zealand have no access to digital<br>platforms to the extent that even a text<br>message is not going to reach them<br>because the phone changes they have no<br>data they have no phone they have no<br>access to the internet um what's going<br>to be do you anticipate put in place<br>said the justice is available to all<br>yeah it's a really good question and it<br>was uh a significant part of of the<br>process and I'm sure it will be an<br>ongoing essentially there's going to be<br>jewel processes because whilst lawyers<br>will be required litigant in person<br>won't be and the courts will be<br>available for in person and paper filing<br>at least for the foreseeable future but<br>what I do think will happen is that<br>courts will change courts will become<br>more digital with more hearing facility<br>and more help for people to complete the<br>forms or make sure they've got uh the<br>right<br>information uh the the other thing to<br>remember is the one thing about New<br>Zealand is MobileOne penetration is<br>extremely high we have something like uh<br>there's more connections more mobile<br>connections I think it's roughly 6<br>million connections to 5 million people<br>5.2 million people so whilst I agree<br>with you huge challenge mobile provides<br>tool any other further questions so if<br>you can wait for the microphone that<br>helpful<br>okay while you think I have a question<br>um as a one of the the key points of of<br>becoming a litigator is there's a real<br>apprenticeship aspect to it going along<br>to the lists and sitting and watching<br>more senior lawyers deal with their<br>matters is there a risk with the<br>digitization of that that we're going to<br>lose a real element of of learning on<br>the job for them lators<br>I I think that's right I mean the the<br>the the game will change uh and maybe we<br>learn uh as as many people do as as um<br>the university knows uh people will<br>watch their colleagues<br>online uh they may may be in the same<br>office they may not they may be in the<br>same room they may be miles away but I<br>suspect that the game will change it<br>take<br>time but you can imagine that some<br>judges would say well I don't need to go<br>to court to hear this<br>interlocutory or this preliminary or<br>procedural why do I need to leave my<br>office I said here you w log in teams me<br>done and more and more I suspect that<br>will happen in fact I don't actually<br>need to drive to court I've got a series<br>of list<br>hearings all around the country that<br>just popped up and um I can see all the<br>files I<br>can have the court staff wherever in the<br>country texting the c t texting the<br>parties the lawyers you're on now and<br>they come on it's not hard to imagine it<br>happens in some uh situations<br>already<br>thank you I just wanted to thank you for<br>very uh thoughtful and insightful<br>lecture actually and say totally the<br>digital strategies where we're going but<br>I wanted to just offer some<br>advice because you did raise it that<br>you're going to make sure this is for<br>the long term so therefore you're going<br>to need support not only from the<br>ministry of Justice but from treasury I<br>was the minister responsible for<br>digitizing all legislation so we could<br>all receive it online at no cost and my<br>regular meetings with the Minister of<br>Finance to get extra<br>funding um were um the most difficult<br>meetings I had and was very grateful<br>that Michael the late Michael cullin<br>agreed entirely but you do need friends<br>because it's not going to happen happen<br>as you said overnight and it can't it's<br>an iterative process and I should<br>imagine that the costings you've been<br>given are as accurate as can be foreseen<br>at this time but don't be surprised if<br>they increase considerably and that's<br>when you'll need those who are really<br>committed to seeing this through to the<br>long term thank you well thank you very<br>much and and and I'm sure those that are<br>responsible for delivering Microsoft DXE<br>and to a very small extent the other<br>companies in which I'm involved we might<br>sure anyone else<br>for<br>de<br>uh ye yes um I know that Justice gard<br>and other um Victoria mlin who leads for<br>the ministry have certainly been and uh<br>gone through some of the processes for<br>example the<br>UK uh I'm pretty sure they have gone to<br>the US and Canada also so I'm not sure<br>exactly where on those but with the UK<br>definitely so they are um they are<br>looking at those of course DXE and<br>Microsoft have delivered um similar<br>systems not quite the same but similar<br>in Queensland in other jurisdictions so<br>there are quite a lot of comparators<br>mediation the company I um am associated<br>with uh has uh um used its platform in<br>um in the US and out of the UK so<br>there's a fair bit of tech expertise as<br>you can imagine there and<br>comparison I note that you did<br>show a model of the Canadian system<br>which looked to be something to the<br>disputes tribe funeral over<br>there so I guess that leads me to my<br>question why the the Ki this off with<br>the disputes tribunal potentially been a<br>better standing Point yeah it's a really<br>interesting one and I you're best to ask<br>the<br>ministry um<br>because the I think there was a whole<br>Confluence of reasons it it<br>is uh it it's a really difficult court<br>that affects a lot lot of people and at<br>the moment it's pretty slow and you saw<br>those figures about self-represented<br>litigant it's also um sort of a<br>microcosm a bit of a test run for the<br>really big one which is the criminal<br>courts and the district court and it<br>sits a little bit<br>separately uh so and and there are other<br>factors I'm sure I just can't remember<br>them all but<br>logic to triing at first in the family<br>court for those and other<br>reasons take we've got time for maybe<br>one or or potentially two more the<br>back aloh everybody and thank you<br>Michael for um an excellent presentation<br>totally fascinating<br>kakahi teach at taping is sometimes and<br>I have a role here at the University for<br>Pacific people so I guess as you're<br>talking about going digital um and<br>thinking about some of um the kind of<br>requirements that we have in the family<br>court for in-person meetings where<br>people actually talk to each other to<br>work things out um but also thinking<br>about things like armad youth courts and<br>how those operate I'm just wondering um<br>whether you see kind of a hybrid model<br>possible and uh um you know some of<br>these courts where those person kind of<br>Innovations and advancements that we<br>made might still be preserved and<br>benefit from the digital Mahala thank<br>you thank you very much for the kind<br>comments I I I absolutely think that<br>hybrid will be the way it works and and<br>I I think it will very be very much be<br>up to the judge and the parties to think<br>how might this work best can we uh you<br>know is someone traveling from afar is<br>someone better in a different language<br>is is someone got work commitments and<br>you you can<br>imagine and in some senses that gives<br>rise to more pressure on the judge to be<br>sort of creative about what they're<br>going to do but I I think very much it<br>will in the early stages be hybrid at<br>most but in many cases proper trial<br>we'll still do exactly what we did but<br>maybe a few more people will join online<br>because of those stresses I<br>question I have a question<br>um<br>surprisingly I'm quite interested in in<br>the the AI element the large language<br>model element and a two-part question<br>how are we going to the extent that he<br>can comment how are we going to deal<br>with the with the ethics element because<br>everybody who's used um chat gbt knows<br>it can throw up some reasonbly<br>fabricated answers and as lawyers our<br>primary responsibility is one to caning<br>to the<br>courts and the second part of that<br>question is large language models the<br>way they built<br>necessarily to favor majority views and<br>how we're going to protect minority view<br>points and and realities using those<br>those are both excellent questions and I<br>wish I knew the<br>answers um but that's well above my pay<br>grade and capability I I think in the<br>strategy it simply talks about with<br>appropriate safeguards appropriate<br>limitations and ultimately the judges<br>control that information so it's very<br>much going to be judicial control I<br>would have thought and I would hope<br>because that's probably going to be the<br>safest<br>way thank you very much I'd like to ask<br>youan to just put your hands together<br>one more time but yes<br>you</p></main><footer style="margin-top: 2rem;
