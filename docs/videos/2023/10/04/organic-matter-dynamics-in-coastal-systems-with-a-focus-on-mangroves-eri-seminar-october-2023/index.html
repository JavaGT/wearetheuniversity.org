One essential part of our work is to shed light on the origin and stability of organic matter in coastal blue carbon systems. Only a sound understanding of organic matter dynamics in blue carbon ecosystems will help to design efficient management plans for coastal regions and enhance their climate change mitigation potential in the future. How mass spectrometry techniques as tools for molecular fingerprinting can be used to identify species specific tracers and decipher organic matter dynamics in mangrove-dominated systems will be demonstrated on the data acquired in a case study from the Jaguaripe River estuary, Brazil. <br><br>Mirco Woelfelschneider studied Biology at Philipps University in Marburg during which he worked on the microhabitat selection of the bio-indicator species Rhodeus amarus in the German river Lahn. After working at the Institute for Marine Biology in Italy, he switched his focus to marine research and studied in the master’s program on Tropical Aquatic Ecology. For his master’s project on identifying chemical changes in leaves of re-growing mangrove trees after logging he joined the Leibniz Centre for Tropical Marine Research. In his following doctoral studies and in the German government-funded project sea4soCiety, Mirco focused on shedding light on organic matter dynamics across coastal vegetated ecosystems.</p><h2>Transcript</h2><p style="opacity: 0.9; font-size: 0.8em">Transcripts may be automatically generated and may not be 100% accurate.</p><p>sha everyone thank you all for being<br>here today um we have a few faces here<br>in Tanga and also online so thank you<br>very much for joining today's ER<br>seminar and I would like to introduce to<br>you um a former colleague of mine Mish<br>Schneider he studied biology at the<br>university the Philips University barg<br>which is Central landlock Germany where<br>he studied I guess rivers and freshwater<br>systems<br>um or the biology therein but then um he<br>went to jilio a tiny little island in<br>Italy and he started diving so he<br>converted to the other side to the<br>Marine side and um where I met him was<br>during our masters at the University of<br>Breman in Germany in north where we did<br>the international studies in tropical<br>Marine ecology together and that's where<br>milu fell in love with the mangroves and<br>um um today he will also tell us a<br>little bit more about blue carbon and<br>Mangrove systems um he had extensive<br>studies in different parts of our<br>beautiful planet so I'm quite excited to<br>hear here about probably Brazil I think<br>today will be on screen um and without<br>further Ado I'm just GNA share our<br>presentation please let us know online<br>if there's any trouble I will make sure<br>to keep an eye on the chat as<br>well and once's done I'm happy to take<br>questions so hopefully we should be done<br>in about 45 minutes and if people have<br>time to say for a few questions we're<br>well all<br>right I hope that<br>you<br>can all see this and M over to you thank<br>you very much thank you very much n for<br>this very kind mention um I'm very happy<br>to be here it's really exciting and yes<br>so you can see already on the screen um<br>the title of the talk so it's about blue<br>carbon um Coastal vegetated systems and<br>especially their the organic metad<br>Dynamics and how to Trace them how to<br>better understand them and all of this<br>in a frame of one of our current<br>projects um the C4 Society project and<br>this is a super long title and I would<br>like to start actually at the end here<br>with introducing very briefly our Co<br>project um so C4 Society this is about<br>searching solutions for carbon<br>sequestration um in coastal ecosystems<br>and this is all about trying to make a<br>change um with current problems we are<br>facing in terms of high levels of carbon<br>dioxide in the atmosphere um yes and<br>this is what our main project is about<br>and I really like this because this kind<br>of binds together my interest of making<br>a change in a world a good leaving a<br>good impact and working with the Beloved<br>ecosystems you can see here in the<br>background already um so very briefly<br>why is this important I guess you all<br>know this you're all scientists<br>I um just want to quickly show this<br>again so we have a few different I hope<br>you can all see the cursor here um a few<br>different trajectories the red one here<br>is if we would just keep on going then<br>prediction say we end up around 4 deges<br>more plus um in global average<br>temperatures if current<br>policies the orange one down here<br>would take place<br>properly<br>um so that would mean we are around<br>plusus 3 degrees Celsius that's here is<br>um the climate convention from Paris<br>around about<br>2.5% and then down here we would near<br>kind of the optimal zero or even below<br>zero emissions um and for this we need<br>to reduce carbon emissions definitely<br>but to reach a stage here where we can<br>sequest the carbon again from the<br>atmosphere carbon dioxide remove it from<br>the atmosphere we would definitely need<br>something to assist us with this and<br>yeah this is where our big research<br>Mission comes into play this is actually<br>only half of it in the Marine realm we<br>also have a big Finance um support by<br>the German government which also looks<br>at the terrestrial part but this are the<br>six um projects which look into the<br>Marine area and they look at very<br>different various things you can see a<br>very Technical Solutions um introducing<br>CO2 in different rock types or changing<br>alkalinity in the water to sequence the<br>carbon dioxide um and then we have here<br>two more nature-based solutions this is<br>a mix of Nature and technology and here<br>is our project C4 society which<br>well focuses on carbon ecosystem in the<br>coastal<br>areas and what are we working with we're<br>working with C forests you can see in<br>the top left corner um or C bands in<br>this case then we have the glov mangrove<br>forests um which my strongest focus is<br>but we also work with seagrass Meadows<br>and salt marshes which are all in the<br>coastal region and<br>sequester um carbon in biom and also<br>settlements associated with these<br>systems and why are we doing this well<br>because if you look at this on the right<br>side here are three of the four systems<br>we're looking in and all the studies<br>have already suggested there is a very<br>um great potential compared to<br>terrestrial ecosystems in terms of<br>carbon storage um in the this case<br>annually per year but you can also see<br>that here was the big um variation here<br>indicated by the bars there is still<br>some research that needs to be done to<br>identify this bit better um here are a<br>few numbers to this which is one of the<br>outcomes of the literature research in<br>our project and there you can see that<br>among the<br>most um productive or effective ones are<br>salt marsh and mangr Forest but you can<br>also very clearly see here um which I<br>want to point out a little bit the big<br>range of data available at the moment<br>because there are actually only very few<br>measurements worldwide where ex<br>relations are based on so there is<br>definitely room to<br>prove but how is this happening now how<br>is organic matter um produced and then<br>also carbon sequestered in the systems<br>so it all starts with a plan in this<br>case show you exory from the mangra<br>system and these plans of<br>course um do photosynthesis or also the<br>algae and then they ose up CO2 from the<br>atmosphere or the water and then this is<br>Incorporated in a biomass over time this<br>biomass in this case as an exory delete<br>they will drop from our mangr here and<br>will fall down on the ground and be<br>eventually incorporated as autous um<br>particulate organic matter by sediment<br>slowly being deposited above them and<br>then Incorporated in state relatively<br>long time<br>SP but also there is then in the Marine<br>realm the tidal influence which not only<br>brings in<br>alus um particular organic carbon which<br>can be for SE leaves Al t or<br>whatsoever but it can also flush out<br>part of the autous in this system<br>produce organic matter into other<br>systems which are nearby or maybe even<br>very far<br>away what happens inside the sediment is<br>there are degradation processes taking<br>place we have microbial but also<br>physiochemical processes um which alter<br>the organic matter some of the part will<br>be transformed into dissolved organic<br>matter so chemical compounds which are<br>being washed out kind of similar if you<br>think about the little teabag you put in<br>your in the morning<br>maybe and then of course a part is also<br>released in the greenhouse gas emission<br>so all of this all this different paths<br>we investigate and see for society all<br>the different<br>steps but there is a trick to it so for<br>instance how do we manage to<br>differentiate between alus and aamus<br>organic carbon um this is often<br>important in terms of stability if<br>organic meta has traveled from way and<br>deposited it's already pre- degraded<br>versus the relatively fresh autous<br>organic matter which is then<br>Incorporated in the sediment and behaves<br>a bit<br>different traditionally um or in the<br>past often people use stable isotope<br>analysis for this which works in very<br>simple<br>systems um but it can be come quickly<br>very very tricky when you have very<br>complex systems where you have very<br>various different<br>um primary producers so the model then<br>and the calculations getting a bit<br>ify another problem is how the CO2 is<br>incorporated mangroves have a SE have a<br>photosynthesis pathway which is very<br>similar to terrestrial plants and also<br>some of the SE species can be hardly<br>differentiated um in some systems<br>between each other and then you have<br>this pool and can say okay this is maybe<br>Mangrove maybe terrestrial or maybe any<br>other organic measure and this is<br>actually where I'm working on in the<br>project and where I have been working in<br>the past on and this is what I want to<br>understand a bit better so how they<br>exchanges how the Dynamics is to maybe<br>in the future get a bit more yeah<br>elaborated um flux calculations for this<br>very complex Coastal ecosystems in which<br>we're<br>working and therefore I brought you a<br>case study and this case study took<br>place in<br>brail um the eastern part of the country<br>here on the coast there is the state of<br>Baya and the City of Salvador and right<br>next to it is an a of the jagoe river<br>you can see<br>here and what you can see here on the<br>map this are five<br>transects where I sampled along a<br>salinity gradient to try and see if I<br>can figure out which organic carbon that<br>c in system is from which source so what<br>you can see here on the map we have this<br>greenish Parts this is all mangra Forest<br>which is documented and also here um we<br>have in this part of the S3 area which<br>is connected to a bigger base system up<br>here we can find SE grasses which grow<br>there relatively<br>abund so what did I actually do I went<br>there and I sampled along the transects<br>along the salinity gradient and I did<br>this twice um once in the rainy season<br>Once in the dry season and in this study<br>which I'm presenting today I focused on<br>the upper 1 cmet of the<br>sediments and<br>then to get an idea about the organic<br>matter and have a the ability to<br>identify molecular markers to be able to<br>trace them in the sediment I also took<br>reference samples from 30 abundant um<br>plant species around the area certainly<br>the mangroves seagrasses but also micro<br>algae and um quite a number of<br>terrestrial plants which grow along the<br>river and then leaves and other material<br>also end up in the system of the<br>EST the samples then were simply freeze<br>DED and<br>mil and then in this case for the<br>particular organic matter analyzed by<br>parsis gas chromatography and mass<br>spectrometry which is an analysis which<br>um for those of you who might be not so<br>familiar with it enables us um for once<br>to not specifically extract a certain<br>group of chemicals for like liquid<br>injection chromatography but it burns<br>all the material in there and then the<br>gas is released from that um the pades<br>will be then analyzed in the gas<br>chromatography and later on it's coupled<br>with Mass Spectrum mat to identify the<br>weights of the ion masses of the<br>different compounds to get an idea which<br>compounds might be hiding behind<br>it so that's for the theory now what did<br>we<br>find and this is um a PCA plot here with<br>a brain Curtis and the similarity Matrix<br>in the<br>background and it shows us from our<br>different sources<br>which ones are close to each other and<br>which ones are a bit more away from each<br>other in terms of chemical composition<br>so what you can see here this big<br>triangular shape this are our<br>terrestrial plants here are macro algae<br>here are micrites which resampled up<br>River sea grasses down here and<br>here uh mangroves and this picture also<br>describes very nicely what often happens<br>with stable isotope analysis you have<br>quite an overlap here between<br>terrestrial plants and the mangroves so<br>when I saw this plot the first time I<br>was like well that didn't work as<br>planned so I cannot really differentiate<br>between<br>mangroves and terrestrial plants and<br>then I was like really oh man why did I<br>spend all this time of my life working<br>on this but then um on the bright side<br>okay I thought like let's look a bit<br>more detail into this and then I ran a<br>few analytical steps for this and um<br>then I could see that terrestrial plants<br>and sea glasses so rest plants here SE<br>grasses there can be differentiated<br>that's already cool it's however not so<br>easily possible for macrofit and<br>terrestrial plants which no surprise<br>they're relatively close to each<br>other then I thought okay let's have a<br>look for the mangroves and the<br>terrestrial plants and it actually seems<br>there is some evidence that it might be<br>possible if we look a bit more into<br>detail so I thought okay that's at least<br>a glimpse of Hope right and then the<br>mangr and the macro again they are very<br>easily distinguishable here and also the<br>SE grasses um were quite<br>different so I thought<br>okay maybe there's hope to somehow find<br>chemical markers to identify our<br>different groups functional groups in<br>this case of primary producers and then<br>I looked into the whole data<br>set identified which chemical compounds<br>or markers are specific for which of the<br>groups and this graphic looks<br>very<br>big but um don't worry about the numbers<br>so the important numbers are all the<br>five numbers are out here because this<br>are chemical markers which in this<br>setting which what I samp and in this S3<br>are markers which are highly unique for<br>only this functional group mangr<br>terrestrial plant casses micro Al and<br>micrites and then I got already a bit<br>more excited because it showed me that<br>the mangr in total the different species<br>there share 36 chemical markers which<br>are unique for them that means if we<br>find them in the<br>sediment then we can be pretty sure that<br>so and then I looked a bit more into<br>detail into this and split them up we<br>have three Mangrove species in the area<br>um one lagonia species one avenia<br>species and one ROP<br>species and you can see here that well<br>RoR for laang has by far the largest<br>number of<br>identifiers which is something but also<br>for karia and AR Shana<br>Shana we have a few markers which we can<br>um identify only for the species so if<br>we find either of these specific markers<br>which are highlighted in green up here<br>and the bar plot then um we can be<br>relatively sure that okay here in this<br>organic met pool whatever we analyze<br>filters sediments in this case which um<br>comes a bit later we have these um<br>species contributing to the organ IC<br>matter stock in this particular field<br>where we're looking at and this is<br>something really cool because this<br>allows us not only to go into groupings<br>of different um individual species like<br>for instance the mangroves but we can<br>even go down to the species level and<br>That Was Then something I was really<br>happy and excited about it and then I<br>thought okay so we find them in the<br>leaves do we find them in the siment<br>because if not then all of this is a<br>waste of time<br>so I looked into it and we actually<br>found them or I actually found them and<br>could identify them what you can see<br>here on the scaling this is a normalized<br>scale um so from what I found to what I<br>not found I just normalized it between<br>one and zero to make it a bit more um<br>visually understandable or more easily<br>understandable in the visual depiction<br>here and um yeah this is for the dry<br>season results and here I just plotted<br>for the sediment samples we took the<br>values from the normalized um<br>identification process of the 36 markers<br>and had a look which ones we can find<br>where as a bit of a side<br>note um here you can see that um these<br>Mangrove markers I pull them all<br>together what is hiding behind it is<br>that the majority of them are actually<br>from resof among which is for one not<br>surprising because they<br>have back here they have the most most<br>uniquely identifiable markers but also<br>mang is one of the most dominant species<br>in this area AIA is normally a fringing<br>um species or pioneer species in the<br>early stages of aggregation of sediments<br>in the area and aena Shana comes in<br>between and the climax stage of the<br>forest Is Res among the so that's how it<br>is but it also shows really nicely that<br>here where there is the main Mangrove<br>fringing area like up until here<br>transect three we have a little bit here<br>and a few single trees here on transect<br>FL you can see we have a very high um<br>value here for the identified markers in<br>this area and then it slowly Fades away<br>and already on the transex here transect<br>five we could not even find the markers<br>anymore which is interesting and which<br>kind of overlays with quite a few<br>studies of colleagues from our Institute<br>which said um if you go further off<br>shelf it's really hard to still Trace<br>back mangra organic matter and the<br>reason is probably because the Dynamics<br>strongly keep the organic matter in the<br>area depending on the tides the water<br>flow and it kind of sticks around close<br>by and doesn't necessarily travel as far<br>depending of this on the setup here of<br>your<br>system and then<br>when it comes to the rainy season you<br>can see a bit of a difference here and<br>you can see here due to the high<br>precipitation which happens not only in<br>the Hinterlands but of course also here<br>and flushes then with surface run offs<br>more organic matter into the system and<br>has a more um outflow of the rivers<br>riverine Parts here you can see that the<br>organic matter travels further out so<br>you can see here much clearer signals<br>Now where's the going down to transect<br>um four here even out and getting<br>stronger down here again transect five<br>we couldn't really find much anymore and<br>here transect five the North Point yeah<br>this unfortunately we couldn't recover<br>any sediment due to strong waves but we<br>assume that it's very similar to the<br>rest here that there is no more organic<br>matter found any so this was really cool<br>and<br>this can be done for all the other um<br>four different groups I identified with<br>different values but I want to keep it<br>for the mangr here because mangr is what<br>I love to work with so I thought<br>okay we keep it with here so I was then<br>really excited and this could be<br>potentially we still have to refine a<br>bit to get a a very nice index which can<br>be globally applied but this is the<br>first study to my knowledge which worked<br>on this so I'm pretty cool that it<br>worked so far it's still need some<br>refinement in the future but I think the<br>potential is pretty<br>cool so this is the one part if you<br>remember here we have now looked at the<br>parate organic but then the other part<br>is the dissolved<br>organic and this is also what was<br>studied by me there and here you can see<br>it was also sampled along the the five<br>transects here along the salinity<br>gradient but then I took further samples<br>here in the alra S3 part and then here<br>in the river very Upstream River part<br>where we have in the rainy season<br>definitely pure freshwater input in the<br>dry season sometimes you can get a hint<br>of seawat encroaching up here but<br>normally you would also maximum reach<br>cinity of one this are taken<br>additionally for the reference samples<br>you will see later on um which I come to<br>in a bit<br>and then the sampling strategy well it's<br>pretty much<br>similar along the transex along the<br>gradient and rainy and dry season it was<br>surface water taken for this study which<br>I'm presenting here and also<br>additionally environmental parameters<br>such as salinity dissolved oxygen<br>pH um yes then it's not so easy to um<br>get markers from let's say mang gr and<br>what I looked and specifically in my<br>study is what leeches out from mangra<br>leaves because mangra leaves if you have<br>been to mangroves already they always<br>float on the surface they go back and<br>forth being pulled out and pushed in by<br>the tights and there is like in your tea<br>in the morning material leeching out<br>right so this is what I looked at and I<br>created something which we often refer<br>to as mangra Leaf te so we collected a<br>bunch of mangr Le sen and mangr Le of<br>the different species put them into<br>distilled water to leech out and then<br>measured these as our reference samples<br>to work with later<br>on then um we analyzed carbon and<br>nitrogen which were um filtered and an<br>AC acidified in this case organic carbon<br>and nitrogen and then um we also ran it<br>through the Ft I RMS which is FIA<br>transform iron cycl resonance Mass py<br>this a big word it's um a process which<br>gives you a similar output to gas<br>chromatograph covered with mass<br>spectrometry but the measuring part um<br>of the cyclotron resonance um detector<br>here Works a bit different by<br>charged<br>um ions being resonated in a system and<br>then the by this resonance induced<br>electrical current being measured than<br>what actually is there and how strong um<br>the ionization works there coupled with<br>the mass spectrometry in the end you get<br>a really high resolution um output being<br>able to identify some formulas for the<br>at yeah same question then what did we<br>actually<br>find so here the plot looks different<br>and it's a bit differently depicted here<br>what you can see here are not the<br>reference samples this are the actual<br>water samples from the<br>S3 and I have cut this into two<br>different groups here on the left side<br>Legend is on the second part you see the<br>mangr French paths transects one to<br>three if you remember the more Upstream<br>part and on the right side the purplish<br>things this are um here and also here<br>these are the more Downstream areas of<br>the Esty where there is almost no mongr<br>fringing happening anymore and you can<br>see here they are very well<br>differentiated so you can see mang gr<br>Fringe not mangr Fringe dry and here<br>rainy season mangr French not mangr<br>French they are very clearly distinct a<br>bit better in the rainy season than in a<br>dry season but nevertheless you can see<br>the<br>differentiation and then what also<br>happen here in this plot um you have<br>different parameters which I took<br>Incorporated in this graphical display<br>here to see okay what can be seen or<br>what are differences associated with<br>this collection of different Spectra and<br>formula accumulated within the<br>semblance and one thing which um is very<br>unique for the mangr FR transa is that<br>we have a high dissolved organic carbon<br>level a high dissolved nitrogen level<br>and we have a lot of compounds which<br>suic components with double bounds um<br>so very stable actually components of<br>the um dissolved organic matter and we<br>have um aromatic components and<br>especially this sulf containing<br>components are a very good hint for um<br>process which happen in anoxic sediments<br>especially mro<br>Sim and then in the other transects<br>which are not so strongly mangr fringed<br>or not at all we have a strong<br>correlation with salinity dissolved<br>oxygen pH compounds with nitrogen which<br>is more um coming in from the ocean and<br>associated with cyop Plankton from F<br>from primary studies and then phosphate<br>and high hydrogen harb Generations<br>carb yes so this already was pretty cool<br>that you could see such a clear<br>differentiation between them um but then<br>I thought<br>okay can we then identify specific<br>traces for the mangroves which I leached<br>with the The Mangrove Le and if I show a<br>similar graph displaying the sources so<br>I differentiated here between the<br>mangrove leave Le the riverine and the<br>oceanic the oceanic was the outer est3<br>sample the rivine sample and the mangra<br>Lea Leach and you could see that there<br>is a certain pool for each which are the<br>outer numbers here again for each group<br>which are unique markers which could be<br>used later on this applies here for the<br>dry season 421 markers for the<br>mangoes and also for the rainy season<br>which are even a bit more<br>489 markers which we could identify for<br>the mangra Le to trace them later<br>on and<br>then one thing I have to introduce you<br>to are the indices we evaluated to make<br>it a bit more standardizable and<br>reproducible across the world if you do<br>a study in a different EST for instance<br>you have your<br>target components here in the upper part<br>which are<br>40 um Peaks we identify with different<br>characteristics very specific for the<br>mangr<br>Lea and then this will be divided by the<br>sum of the trace to be traced Target<br>groups and the reference Peaks which<br>come from the um island of stability<br>which is a study which was conducted in<br>2004 if I'm not mistaken and looked into<br>various Marine samples and identified a<br>group of<br>281 um molecular formulas which were<br>present in all Marine samples so with<br>this you can get a relativized index for<br>our MRA refuge and can apply this also<br>for other<br>samples um which you take on another end<br>of the world and then we thought okay<br>our colleagues also work on a similar<br>index for mangr po water derived markers<br>so we thought okay why not apply this<br>and make it a test and see what what are<br>the results are there similarities are<br>differences and this is what can be seen<br>here this for now is the mangr PO water<br>and you can see here the mangr PO water<br>seems to be strongest of course on the<br>upper three trans sets no surprise this<br>also um the PCA plots indicat that there<br>is a difference and then down here as<br>well it getting lower but it's even<br>washed out here into the arri and the<br>coastal Waters and traveling on one<br>thing which was a<br>bit yeah we worried about it in the<br>beginning but then we thought why could<br>this be we have the highest value up<br>here in the rine side and this we assume<br>is due to that we have um extensive<br>mroi areas here so this is um a grass<br>species which can also persist into<br>submerged areas and grow there very<br>strongly and this is very common here in<br>the upper relatively shallow part of the<br>river so there is also anoxic sediments<br>which similar to mangr have probably<br>similar signatures in terms of high<br>levels of sulur content and other Market<br>nevertheless it seems to be working<br>quite well you just have to be cautious<br>if you have other systems with similar<br>characteristics of area and then we look<br>At The Mangrove G and here you can see a<br>pattern which is actually actually<br>relatively similar you have a strong<br>strong points here in the upper three<br>transects and then less strong indic<br>values in the lower<br>parts and one thing which unfortunately<br>was not in the protocol to record I just<br>have pictures for this um we had<br>observations here that in this specific<br>areas here up on the left uh on the<br>Northern side here in the middle side<br>and here in the middle and North there<br>were always accumulations of mangr<br>leaves floating on the surface and they<br>went even out here to the outer Ester<br>and build this huge Meadows of floating<br>mangr leaves on the water surface we<br>have a picture actually where we take<br>samples right next to them and this I<br>would assume explains this very high<br>value outside in the EST which was quite<br>interesting for us because these<br>compounds are normally relative lab by<br>but you can see they are being<br>transported if the conditions are<br>matching to even in the coastal Waters<br>and then can there be used up by<br>microbes and fuel phyto TOS or<br>whatsoever this was in the dry season<br>and in the rainy season it's relatively<br>similar you can see here again like also<br>for the sediments in the rainy season<br>the organic matter in this case it<br>dissolved seems to be traveling further<br>outside of the EST seems to be pushed<br>more out because um just the river<br>runoff is higher and this is also<br>reflected here in<br>the index for our mangr Le KES and you<br>can see here that the values seem to be<br>a bit higher overall and this we assume<br>is due to the fact that of course the<br>runoff of precipitation here in the<br>mangra forest also flushes out mangra<br>leaves which then lead into the surface<br>proes so<br>yes what can we learn from this so why<br>is why do I find this so exciting and<br>I'm really happy about the study<br>um to enhance your two capturing<br>capacity we need to understand blue<br>carbon ecosystems and especially the<br>Dynamics there at the moment we mainly<br>consider only aous organic carbon being<br>stored in the sediment and ignore the<br>autous<br>part because we just simply don't<br>understand it to a extent that we can<br>really make precise calculations about<br>it um but to fully understand this we<br>definitely need um better tracing<br>capabilities of our um analysis and the<br>two methods I showed you or the two<br>approaches I showed you might be some<br>way to go in the future and can be also<br>applied to various other systems and<br>yes with um this method as I showed you<br>it's even possible to go beyond<br>functional groups you can even in some<br>cases go to species levels which I found<br>really cool because there are not many<br>um besides DNA or Edna techniques who<br>can do<br>that what in the end needs to be done<br>this method is more on the qual<br>qualitative part of the Spectra and to<br>make comprehensive calculations for<br>carbon flexes we are currently on the<br>way to refining this to a more quantif<br>quantitative um approach by combining it<br>with various other<br>methods and yeah that's what I'm doing<br>at the moment I probably will be doing<br>in the future and with that I want to<br>say thank you for your attention it's a<br>and<br>thank you very much M um we would like<br>to ask anyone if um yeah if you have any<br>questions either on Zoom or also here in<br>the room we're happy to take them now um<br>just before reing up is there any are<br>me yeah thanks um I was wondering about<br>the sampling your sampling strategy in<br>the P part that you um talked about how<br>it looked like you had many more samples<br>for the um for the terrestrial plants<br>than for all the others and then<br>actually also if you go a little bit<br>further into and that's reflected sorry<br>in the vent diagram that's reflected in<br>kind of like the specific markers for<br>that group right and actually if you<br>looked at the different individual<br>components it seemed like the sampling<br>depth was very well correlated with the<br>number of markers that you got um in<br>each of the groups and then going<br>further in if you look at this mangr<br>species you said the ROP species were<br>the most prominent in the area they were<br>also the ones that showed the most<br>markers I was wondering how do do you<br>have any idea of how deep you would have<br>to sample to kind of like reach a at<br>like a saturation point of where you<br>where you can say you've maybe sampled<br>all of the possible markers you'll that<br>that could be a good kind of like<br>indicator for sampling depth in the<br>future yes<br>so maybe let's let me go to the first<br>question um so there is definitely um<br>this queuing of the results by sampling<br>of course more terrestrial plants the<br>thing is for once we have the problem<br>that there are no more mangs in the area<br>so this is something we are currently<br>working on we have a huge variety of<br>samples taken from other parts of the<br>world which ideally we can incorporate<br>into this um but also this is something<br>where we say this is<br>besides a bit of the part of the<br>analytical method itself it's more the<br>qualitative because we haven't found a<br>good way to incorporate this into<br>analysis into our analysis to get this<br>unbalanced um results kind of leveled<br>and being able to then fully<br>quantify um the outputs that's why it's<br>at the moment more in a qualitative side<br>but this is definitely an issue we also<br>saw already and we're working on in the<br>backgrounds in our at the moment but we<br>have not found a<br>fully um<br>pleasing way to change that yet because<br>of course if you sample more you have a<br>greater variety so you might end up with<br>more um Parts more compounds which are<br>represented in a group where you have a<br>larger<br>s this is something we're working on at<br>the moment for the second question<br>um the Assumption I have or what what I<br>discussed with my colleagues and peers<br>on that is that the ropera<br>group um is a bit more distinguished<br>from many terrestrial plants in the<br>areas compared to the families and<br>higher hierarchical orders um of the<br>Lagoon karia and the avenia group so we<br>assume that there is more overlap<br>between these two groups in terrestrial<br>plants which then rule out these<br>possible chemical components as markers<br>for the<br>specific species this is also an issue<br>we're working at in the moment and we um<br>are breaking our heads like how you<br>would say it in Germany to figure out<br>how we could come up with an index<br>system for instance which revat or<br>levels this a bit more um to not scoot<br>this one or the other direction um<br>because<br>we um it's not that we have more Market<br>because res for is more abundant there<br>this is just how the system is but we<br>measured the same amount of Heats so<br>this shouldn't be an effect there um but<br>yeah so this is in a very early stage or<br>relatively early stage of method<br>development and there are still a<br>variety of things you can do if anyone<br>is interested I think our group and my<br>boss is very happy to have Brilliant<br>Minds around to discuss<br>this yes um<br>child yeah hi thanks uh mirle for a<br>great presentation so I have a I have<br>two magic wand questions right my first<br>question is if you had a magic wand that<br>gives you all the knowledge you need<br>what would that knowledge look like and<br>then the second magic wand is if after<br>that first magic wand has worked what<br>would that magic wand what would you<br>wave that wand with and and create<br>change what specific<br>allow um thank you very much CH for this<br>very nicely phrased questions so with my<br>first magic one I would definitely go<br>and Sample every single primary producer<br>on the world and analyze them ideally<br>within a day and not within a couple of<br>years um and then to get a very holistic<br>picture of what can be Markus really<br>effectively used for what<br>group um and then maybe this would<br>already rule out the unbalance of the<br>system but it would also maybe increase<br>it even more and then we would have to<br>see how to deal with it um the second<br>oneand if we would have this Baseline<br>knowledge I would probably wave it and<br>um make it a kind of compass to point at<br>the most effective methods to combine it<br>with to quantify it fully because um<br>there are a few detect ction limitations<br>in the<br>analytical um background which I didn't<br>go into more detail here with which also<br>limits us a bit on the<br>quantitative of our results there so one<br>option could be to combine it with I<br>don't know maybe stable isotope me<br>measurements and then get really<br>quantitative really comprehensive data<br>to be able to make Global calculations<br>and really understand the<br>system<br>I don't know maybe in the lifetime of us<br>we will achieve this by different groups<br>working together maybe it's still is a<br>magic oneand maybe we invent this<br>someday and then we can figure this out<br>um yeah and maybe just a more practical<br>thing is then the idea is what we also<br>have at C4 Society to then be able to<br>create um combined Coastal management<br>plans with different systems not only<br>looking at one system but for instance<br>mangroves produce organic matter it's<br>being flushed out and then a Cass metal<br>captures it stores it in their sediment<br>and then we have increased carb storage<br>so this are kind of future dreams which<br>go beyond the two ones I have maybe<br>would be a third one um but yeah I hope<br>that answers your questions child or<br>well Scot<br>question and then I see a hand from H<br>here yeah a couple of people sitting<br>around a table maybe is that you guys<br>good yeah um I don't know if I've got<br>the wrong end of the stick here sorry<br>but with your indices showing the<br>highest impact or the yeah the highest<br>influence from mangroves in that River<br>on<br>bit presumably that's far enough up the<br>river that you know it's not the<br>mangroves that are doing it so how do<br>you<br>know that the rest of it tailing down<br>as it gets closer to the<br>entrance isn't just a reduction in the<br>influence of the riveron instead of the<br>influence of the<br>mangrove if that makes sense yes that<br>definitely makes sense<br>um yes this is also being studied there<br>um I mentioned unfortunately don't have<br>the the graphs at hand right now I<br>mentioned that we also looked at total<br>dissolved organic carbon in the area and<br>one thing which further studies from one<br>of my peers showed um very early in the<br>two beginning of 2000s um showed that<br>mangr in areas where we don't have this<br>microfi grassy swamp areas up River um<br>excrete a high amount of total um<br>dissolved organic CED into the system<br>and with mixing plots which we<br>calculated or which I calculated which<br>hopefully will be published in a paper<br>by the end of the year<br>um you can see<br>that if you make a line between the<br>back so if you're calculate a simple<br>mixing model line between this riverine<br>spot and down here the the spot in what<br>we call the outer s which is maybe not<br>the very perfectly right term here um<br>but then you can see that especially in<br>this area you have a high input which is<br>not explained by<br>simple linear mixing down here from the<br>freshwater values down to the seawater<br>values but there is a very strong input<br>here in this specific area where the<br>mangr recite so this is<br>a indication a very strong indication<br>for us<br>that even though you have a similar<br>input by the system up here because we<br>assume it's also un oxic um conditions<br>similar to mangroves we have um a very<br>clear indication that there is even more<br>put on top of the mangroves<br>there and um yeah this is the this is<br>the thing what we're working as and we<br>hope we can refine with the traces here<br>if you have simple systems only mangr<br>present there that would not be an issue<br>at all and this is a place where this<br>index was developed but we applied it on<br>a more complex system here and then you<br>can see it's not perfect yet so we're<br>also working on it at the moment how<br>this target groups are assigned as high<br>level of um sulfur atoms in the chemical<br>structure and a correlation with um<br>bario if I'm not mistaken but our<br>colleagues in um work in the lab we work<br>together with so she correlated these<br>two factors and used the Peaks as Target<br>Peaks for<br>the um po water which have the highest<br>correlation with these two variables but<br>as I said this was more of a trial run<br>here and we have IND ation that it's<br>still working but in more complex system<br>like this here you might have to<br>carefully<br>rethink um what you're<br>question all right we might just take<br>one more question just to wrap it up<br>before one um Shamy would you like to<br>read it out or yes hi thanks so much<br>mirica for your presentation was very<br>interesting um very nice to see your<br>case study and results I have a question<br>that kind of pulls out a bit towards the<br>broader kind of blue carbon and carbon<br>marketing kind of space at the moment<br>and I have a question regarding the need<br>to understand this complexity of carbon<br>Dynamics in Mangrove ecosystems and<br>today's current practice of carbon<br>accounting for the carbon Market um so<br>my question is that blue carbon projects<br>already do exist across the world in<br>which there are carbon codes<br>and methodologies for carbon accounting<br>that exist um are you working with any<br>organizations or other universities or<br>firms to kind of implement your research<br>prati um your research and results into<br>the practice of um carbon accountings or<br>are you aware of any initiatives of<br>this yes so the clear answer is yes the<br>pro working with C4 Society what we are<br>studying there is<br>this what I presented there is just a<br>fracture of what we're doing in the<br>project we're doing much much more<br>things in there we are a group of 44<br>scientists and um eight institutes<br>across Germany Malaysia and<br>Colombia and this is the first phase to<br>get kind of a baseline from next year on<br>in August it will be the second phase<br>which is starting this is which is the<br>implementation phase um we had just I<br>actually just came from a workshop in<br>Malaysia before I came here where we had<br>a stakeholder Workshop where we started<br>to initiate a collaboration with them to<br>actually Implement um our findings and<br>on the same time validate these findings<br>in regrowing systems like replanted<br>mangroves replanted SE grasses and where<br>we can find it replanted Sal Marsh areas<br>or reated S Marsh areas um so this is in<br>progress and we have so far I think five<br>NOS on board um at the moment yes from<br>Colombia because the workshop was<br>already in May as I said in Malaysia it<br>was just a week ago so I came here three<br>days ago um and then we also have a<br>partner in Germany on board which is<br>called Fair grow which kind of<br>links<br>um local initiatives for instance for<br>replanting mangroves with um the carbon<br>market and then also investors sence<br>this so this is in<br>place it's happening already in the<br>background I didn't just want to talk<br>only about this project here but also of<br>science so this is happening and um what<br>is a problem or what we see as a problem<br>at the moment this carbon accounting<br>often takes only Al lotous material<br>which I<br>and and we try to um change that a bit<br>ecosystem um coastal areas which include<br>seagrasses s Mars and mangra for<br>instance together in one<br>area of carb or the the the capacity of<br>carbon sequestration seems to increase<br>and this is not captured by the current<br>systems at the moment and this is<br>something we try to work on with um the<br>work we're doing at the moment so<br>hopefully soon we will have the first<br>case studies to implement this and then<br>verify what we do<br>thanks so much for<br>answer<br>yes awesome thank so much for your<br>presentation and as a token of gratitude<br>from the environmental uh science<br>research institute we give you this<br>little coh which is like a little trophy<br>to take home thank you so thank you<br>everyone for joining um on zoom and also<br>in the room here um and yeah's details<br>are just on this last slide so feel free<br>to get in contact if you have any more<br>much</p></main><footer style="margin-top: 2rem; background: #0001; padding: 2rem; text-align:
