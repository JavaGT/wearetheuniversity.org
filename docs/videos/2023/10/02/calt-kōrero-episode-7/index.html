education; students dislike it; teachers find it to be educationally lacking; one would only contemplate OFDL as a last option. <br><br>The panel in this CALT Korero will bust the many myths that surround OFDL as they talk about the frustrations and challenges as well as the joys and the immense satisfaction that can be attained through teaching well-designed courses that meet student

carero<br>focusing<br>on dismissing the myths associated with<br>online flexible and distance<br>learning thank you those who are here in<br>person and of course for everyone who's<br>watching on Zoom um for the next hour as<br>I said we'll be discussing all things<br>distance online and flexible learning<br>and talking about some of the myths and<br>why they are myths and not truths um at<br>the end we'll allow time for some<br>question and answers people on Zoom can<br>can submit these at any time and the<br>studio audience will get a chance to put<br>their hand up at the end um so we'll<br>start by introducing ourselves and I'm<br>Kieran Pratt and I come from just down<br>the road at the College of Education and<br>I've been researching and teaching<br>online since 2000 Sarah thank you Karen<br>I'm Sarah car and I'm the director of<br>the doctor and Business Administration<br>in Commerce Division um and and we do<br>online in James thanks Karen K my name<br>is James Harding I teach in the theology<br>program I teach undergraduates and<br>postgraduates and all of our papers and<br>all of our supervision is available by<br>distance and finally to Brahman who's<br>joining us from Crash Church y everyone<br>um I'm the academic coordinator of<br>postgrad programs in pain and Pain<br>Management based in Christ Church and<br>I've been teaching exclusively on online<br>for 22<br>years thanks Ronnie okay so first of all<br>we thought we'd start by talking about<br>what are the actual myths that kind of<br>get talked about with regards as kind of<br>teaching and<br>learning my first thought is that um<br>teaching online is the same as what you<br>do in the classroom um definitely I<br>think it's a big myth because there's a<br>lot more preparation that we do um<br>there's a lot more work that you do to<br>just ensure levels of Engagement but um<br>I think the rewards are better<br>definitely y I think another of the<br>myths is that you can't replicate the<br>special environment of being in a<br>classroom online or by<br>distance and um on the one hand that<br>might be a good thing because perhaps we<br>don't want to replicate every aspect of<br>the inperson experience on the other<br>hand there are there are things that you<br>can do in the online environment and in<br>the distance environment uh which really<br>enhanced people's learning uh and that's<br>and and that's fantastic you know for<br>all sorts of reasons which we can<br>discuss yep y about you bronnie um and I<br>I've heard people say that it's not as<br>good for Learners or for teachers to<br>teach by distance and I think that's a<br>bit of a fallacy as well because we do<br>have great outcomes and really good<br>engagement and for me it's incredibly<br>rewarding<br>y I mean I'm teaching face to face this<br>year for the first time in probably a<br>decade right and I must say I'm really<br>enjoying it but I'm still really<br>enjoying my online classes and looking<br>back to going online semester one next<br>year so yeah yeah so one thing I've<br>heard is that students can cheat it's<br>much easier because you can cheat online<br>and I would argue that actually all my<br>my conversations with them are text<br>based and so I probably know my students<br>writing better than I would my any<br>inperson students where the first<br>writing I might be getting from them as<br>as the assignment so I think that's<br>completely wrong yeah and I think that<br>the one of the things that I find really<br>interesting with um with our students is<br>that we try to get to know them as<br>people first yeah so that when you are<br>actually um looking at their work you<br>can hear their voice almost and what<br>they're writing so that yeah we know who<br>our students are first as people and<br>students so it makes it much easier when<br>you're marking their work you go I<br>understand exactly why you're writing<br>that and saying that and it is them yeah<br>is one of the really important things<br>about uh distance teaching that you you<br>really do have to build up that<br>relationship with students and find ways<br>of encouraging them to build the<br>relationship with with one another um<br>and and that for one thing enables you<br>to um have a rapport with them as a<br>teacher and a learner uh but it it it<br>also means that you you get to you get<br>to know them you get to know their<br>writing style you get to know a bit<br>about the way they think and you get to<br>know quite a bit about what might be<br>going on on for them uh in in their in<br>their wider<br>lives that might be affecting their<br>learning yeah yeah and the idea of being<br>able to cheat applies just as much to<br>inperson<br>teaching does to to distance teaching um<br>the students in my groups tend to have<br>to do things that are applied to their<br>own living context their working context<br>and so I can learn a lot more about<br>their um I teach postgrad clinical<br>people um their online and their the<br>clinical practice is what's informing<br>their assignments and vice versa so we<br>can see really it's very hard to<br>actually cheat and really they don't<br>want to to learn that's why they're<br>doing the the learning yeah and it's<br>that's one of the advantages is that<br>we're teaching usually people who are<br>doing the paper because they really want<br>to do the paper not because it's just a<br>filler cuz that you know it was at 10:00<br>on the head and 11:00 on the same<br>building so it was easy to to go to B<br>kind of thing where a friend was doing<br>it which I've certain had before<br>absolutely yeah and and I think one of<br>the things that you said James was the<br>way we get to know our students um one<br>thing that we tend to do is that we have<br>an orientation right at the beginning of<br>the program and it's in person so<br>everybody comes and they spend a week<br>they get to know each other um and then<br>when you actually go into those weekly<br>lectures that are online and they're<br>synchronous the first thing we do is a<br>water cooler catchup so how was your<br>week and you know you can put them in<br>breakout rims and they have 5 minutes to<br>get back back in touch with each other<br>um and sort of get into this space but<br>it's that there is that sense of well we<br>know who you are we know the challenges<br>and you're in a space that's safe to to<br>share your challenges and stuff with<br>people who are on the same Journey as<br>you are yeah that helps yeah yeah that<br>helps a lot yeah we find that they're<br>learning off each other so much and so<br>while initially the conversations are<br>about me talking ultimately it's about<br>different students sharing their own<br>experience es and the cat and the dog<br>that also online and visit us that<br>humanizes the whole teaching learning<br>process for people I think yeah and I<br>mean I teach mostly asynchronously so<br>it's only if they request a synchronous<br>meeting that I actually kind of see them<br>either in person if they happen to be<br>Denon or via Zoom but we still spend the<br>first week making sure we get to know<br>them and we you know I actually put out<br>questions that they can answer so that<br>it's not scary yeah cuz you know<br>suddenly posting on a discussion board<br>can be quite scary yeah um but I also<br>get them to contact me and let me know<br>if there's anything going on in their<br>lives that I should know about as as the<br>lecturer and the person who's kind of<br>leading them through the course um that<br>they don't necessarily want everyone<br>else to learn because our students are<br>often mature yeah which comes with its<br>own issues including things like<br>children and aging parents and<br>complicated lives and it's just I think<br>it's important for us to know that so<br>that when they're asking an extension we<br>know what's been going on and you know<br>all that works having you know for mind<br>it's teachers so you know if eror is<br>coming then I know they're going to be<br>stressed their assignment is not going<br>to be done at that time yeah so yeah I<br>me the flexibility of distance learning<br>is actually one of the things that makes<br>those students able to come to us in the<br>first place um it enables us to reach<br>out to them and then to come to us um<br>where they simply wouldn't have the<br>flexibility to move to denen for three<br>four years and do their degree yeah yeah<br>yeah and our students are are all<br>clinicians so they're actively working<br>in in and applying what we're learning<br>together in their own practice so some<br>of our little tips for catching up with<br>people is be the half hour before we<br>start teaching we and we're teaching the<br>evenings really good time past fing<br>Feeding Frenzy so we talk about you know<br>what have you been up to and what is<br>that a glass of wine or is that a um hot<br>chocolate in that up there or maybe it's<br>a craft beer we don't care but we try to<br>get to know each other and and have that<br>relationship and try to see people as<br>whole people and that makes a big<br>difference to teaching and learning any<br>anywhere I think yeah yeah and I think<br>that kind of leads nicely onto our next<br>topic which is engagement which is often<br>seen as you know online students are<br>disengaged they do the minimum possible<br>to pass I think as you said once you you<br>build up a relationship with them um and<br>give them the option to apply what<br>they're learning to their own<br>context and engagement is not usually a<br>problem no no we find that um anytime<br>that we need something extra from our<br>students if we say well we we would like<br>to um have a guest lecture or there's<br>somebody visiting and can you zoom in<br>they're there they're really engaged<br>because you know you're treating them<br>like somebody who who's interested<br>you're making things flexible for them<br>yeah so you've given them that space as<br>you say you know they couldn't actually<br>do so we're making it accessible and<br>they'll bend over backwards to sort of<br>be engaged at a level much beyond what<br>most other students would be yeah y we<br>can use a lot of tools that are<br>available for distance learning that<br>aren't necessarily available in person<br>for example I've got material for people<br>who prefer to watch a video versus<br>reading a a research paper or we ask<br>even for assignment here do a<br>presentation um write a patient resource<br>does not have to be in a in an essay<br>format and that means that we've got<br>more flexibility for our new neurod<br>Divergent students um or people who<br>don't speak English as their Fus<br>language so I think we've got lots of<br>ways to engage students in their<br>learning that doesn't because we're<br>doing it differently we have that<br>opportunity to play with and experiment<br>with different ideas yeah I think we<br>have to be more deliberate and yeah yeah<br>and all the decisions we make about our<br>teaching because we know that it's<br>different and it would be easy for<br>students to kind of just disappear off<br>the face of the Earth so we kind of bend<br>over backwards and like far more than<br>you would in a in a you know oh yeah an<br>iners class y absolutely um you know you<br>can tell when a student sort of goes I'm<br>I'm not going to be available for class<br>today you okay are you okay you know you<br>sort of it's that Personal Touch um and<br>it means a lot to the students but you<br>can also with some of them they'll say<br>I'm traveling for work or I've got um a<br>big meeting the big boss is coming from<br>overseas whatever it is and you you sort<br>of you know that that's going to be in<br>pleading on their study but because we<br>record the lecture they can pick it up<br>later or there are other learning<br>resources as Bry says that you've made<br>available for them whenever they need it<br>so yeah we I think you're more<br>deliberate but the return the reward<br>from the students is much bigger that<br>way I mean we've redeveloped our entire<br>post-grid<br>program few years ago now but we<br>deliberately started with a paper that<br>we wanted all students to take that it's<br>called current issues in education but I<br>call it preparing for postgrad and<br>distance study because our students are<br>often coming back to study after many<br>years away and so we build in things<br>like how to participate in the online<br>discussions and how to get the most out<br>of readings and all those kind of skills<br>based things that you take for granted<br>when you kind of work and live in a<br>university or teach undergrads who are<br>who are getting it and living it but<br>when you're coming back to study after<br>10 years you've forgotten all of those<br>things so making it very easy for them<br>to engage and kind of scaffolding them<br>into the process I think helps too and<br>that's really important especially since<br>a lot of mature students they maybe<br>don't have um the sort of preparation at<br>school to go into University yeah you<br>know and uh so helping them to get into<br>the process of learning at University<br>level is really is really important um<br>and and you know we can find ways of<br>doing that um in distance learning yeah<br>and the technology helps us now I mean I<br>I think about 20 years ago when you<br>you'd have to prepare all an enormous<br>amount of material 6 months in advance<br>uh and then you know teach synchronously<br>perhaps but in an empty room with a row<br>of microphones now we don't have that<br>anymore we've got lots and lots and lots<br>of resources in terms of you know zoom<br>and micros Microsoft teams and and and<br>and the library has so much in the way<br>of electronic<br>resources um it it's actually become not<br>just easier but a real joy to to to<br>engage uh students um yeah yeah I think<br>the technology changes have really<br>enhanced um so like you um I I've used<br>the old microphone or hang on the end of<br>the telephone for 2 hours of teaching at<br>night not the most stimulating um of<br>things but now we've got we have so many<br>different ways to get students engaged<br>in in including breakout rooms and um<br>giving them to to watch us as we go<br>through how to access journals and and<br>the library as we demonstrate those<br>sorts of things we couldn't have done um<br>a few years back and now we can so I<br>found that really helpful most of my<br>students are are coming back to study it<br>would be at least a good you know know 5<br>to 10 years for for many of them and<br>they're squishing this into their spare<br>time so-called spare time but what the<br>joy is when they say that they're doing<br>it and then two years later they say oh<br>well you know bug has bitten me I'm<br>do yeah I think it's helped the<br>technology being able to have everything<br>kind of in one place yeah cuz I mean I<br>know when I started we had static web<br>pages we had a separate synchronous text<br>discussion thing that had to be written<br>in a special language you know so if I<br>wanted any to change any of my content I<br>had to go through someone who could edit<br>the web pages and then to get into you<br>know get anything else you had to tell<br>them go and find the library and go and<br>you know it was things got really<br>difficult whereas now they can get<br>everything from inside Blackboard I just<br>put links in and yeah they just they<br>live in there and pop out to where they<br>need basically and the really neat thing<br>with that is that the different<br>resources as bronnie said lots of people<br>have different ways of learning so the<br>ability to to find things for<br>neurodiverse Learners means that you<br>know we can go and sort of go actually<br>we'll use a video for this but some<br>people won't understand or get the video<br>as well as maybe if we put these<br>readings on that support the video so<br>people can look at different things yeah<br>and choose what works best for their<br>learning styles but we can do that in<br>the distance learning environment and<br>you can I love going around and looking<br>for new things it's like oh Ted Talk oh<br>this is a good one you know and so you<br>can be just throwing them things to<br>students all the time and like podcasts<br>that they can listen to in their<br>Oakland like some of the some of the<br>challenges though are are around Zoom<br>fatigue and I had one students say<br>especially during Co you know they were<br>getting Zoom fatigue but that's where<br>our rec recording the lectures are so<br>good they don't have to be there we<br>carry the discussions on inside<br>Blackboard afterwards or inside Echo 360<br>we have the tools and they're not hard<br>for our students to learn and when<br>they're engaged in that subject when<br>they're saying this is relevant this is<br>going to change how I work with people<br>that's when they start to use it and I<br>think that's our job as Educators is to<br>help students understand how they can<br>apply what they're learning why is it so<br>important why is it so<br>exciting that means that get engaged in<br>the learning process and I think that<br>applies whether it's distance learning<br>or in person but we do have that special<br>extra for distance learning because the<br>students are scattered around the<br>country um and they can start to hook up<br>with other students in their area that<br>they may never have NW doing the same<br>sorts of things I think that's a<br>wonderful Advantage for our<br>students that almost um opens the sort<br>of the question about you know with<br>distance Are we more agile perhaps to be<br>finding or teaching material that has<br>that impact because I know for us um we<br>ask our students you know what what have<br>you found that's been really useful um<br>students will come back and so say you<br>know what we talked about last week well<br>I did it at work and this is what<br>happened as a result of what we did and<br>so for for us it's like great we can see<br>that impact immediately um and to think<br>about because a lot of distance is done<br>in that professional space and it's for<br>people who are working<br>professionals we have an opportunity to<br>sort of think well actually what else<br>can we be doing where else can be we be<br>reaching other people that we're not<br>reaching now because distance is that<br>vehicle to do that um and you think it's<br>like throwing a stone into a pond you<br>know the ripples of what we're doing<br>yeah has a huge impact and um I use that<br>analogy to the students a lot and saying<br>we're just here allowing you to be the<br>stone um think about where where you can<br>take this next because it's not just<br>about this paper or the program that<br>you're doing but it's about your whole<br>life yeah and I think that comes back<br>again to that our deliberate thinking<br>about what we're doing and how we're<br>doing it and and why we're doing it<br>which I think bronnie you touched on<br>when you you talked about the technology<br>and keeping it simple being important I<br>know there's a temptation to go out<br>there and play with all the latest toys<br>but I want my students focused on the<br>point of what the course not on all the<br>latest toys though I do teach one one<br>class on teaching online so I do get to<br>play with some toys then so I'll come<br>and do your course<br>Jella please please<br>more but especially since some of our<br>students are maybe not used to some<br>other toys U this might be the first<br>time that they've engaged with the the<br>tools that we're using and so it really<br>is important to to keep it simple until<br>until everybody's up to speed with the<br>same uh the same technology we've<br>standardized our Blackboard Pages we've<br>got a postgrad template that we use for<br>our online courses so no matter which<br>paper they go into they know what to<br>look for<br>where there's variation within that but<br>you know the the General Baseline is<br>there so that they're not starting each<br>semester going gosh where is everything<br>yeah yeah if we can make it simpler for<br>the students that encourages that<br>engagement yeah definitely y yeah which<br>demands<br>yeah I guess that um some people sort of<br>think about when we went to online<br>teaching during Co um I've always refer<br>to that as triage teaching cuz literally<br>we were just triaging everything yeah<br>that's not true distance it's not<br>flexible it's not open it's that it's<br>not good it's not no it's not good so<br>yeah there is a demand we do have to<br>work differently yeah yeah yeah part of<br>that is is being as you said Karen<br>intentional about what we do um uh and<br>um on on the flip side of the of the co<br>situation it was triage teaching<br>certainly but one of the curious things<br>I found was that um students who for a<br>whole variety of reasons struggled with<br>being in class with other students uh<br>really came alive when they were able to<br>just be in their own environment uh at<br>home uh and take part uh through through<br>through the computer uh perhaps they<br>were just able to damage uh the<br>environment bit a bit more than they<br>would have been uh in in an inperson<br>class situation yeah I think anyone who<br>thinks doesn't think as fast as the<br>other people in the class yeah you know<br>something with with an asynchronous<br>element really helps them because it<br>gives them the time to absorb the<br>reading and really think about it and<br>come to their own understanding and then<br>go online and and share their thoughts<br>and read everyone else's and you know<br>continue that that growth cycle of<br>knowledge but you know in a class where<br>it's kind of look yeah you know you<br>don't have time to think yeah you're too<br>busy writing the notes or yeah<br>absolutely and that that sort of means<br>that we're opening it up again for the<br>neurodiverse people and I think from a<br>teachers's perspective we have to think<br>about all of our students will have<br>different learning skills and one of the<br>things that we do um in the first day on<br>the program is say to people well how do<br>you learn and we go through exercises<br>about learning about learning and trying<br>to identify their learning skills and<br>then we get them to sort of reflect on<br>how they're going to make most of the<br>learning process and then they can<br>inform us so that we yeah it's an<br>additional thought from our perspective<br>that's a demand on our time but it's<br>sort of going okay I've got three people<br>here who really want to to do things in<br>their own time well we record lectures<br>they can go back um for our Pacifica<br>students they find it really helpful<br>because they can do it in their own time<br>they they're there for the synchronous<br>and then they want watch recording a<br>couple of days later and do that just<br>that thinking rethinking about things<br>and they say that really helps that<br>cement their learning definitely there's<br>a lot of interaction I think between<br>this the Learners the students and and<br>us as teachers that um where it's really<br>Sy synergistic they'll say something and<br>we'll see how it lands and then I'll<br>respond to it in vice versa I think that<br>takes more time and it is really<br>demanding um just even preparing the<br>materials like I do manyi videos and um<br>Powerpoints and things that I I put the<br>quizzes on and things that does take<br>more time than if I'm just giving a<br>lecture but it offers me the chance to<br>see how that works for our different<br>students and for them to give me<br>feedback and then they can start to<br>think about how they might use those<br>same strategies for teaching and<br>learning themselves in their own<br>practice that is really exciting to see<br>but I I don't want to underestimate the<br>demands that distance teaching has on on<br>time um I do spend a lot of time on<br>discussion boards um emailing students<br>making you know reading their their<br>works and preparing for our teaching<br>sessions so that they um they can get<br>the most out of it and that means<br>there's a little less time available for<br>researching and writing up my<br>own projects and and juggling that is<br>not easy I'm not sure whether that's<br>just a feature of distance teaching<br>learning or whether that's just a<br>commitment to teaching as something that<br>is important in my job um I'd be<br>interested to see how that lands for<br>others in this Coro well that last point<br>is is really significant I think um it's<br>a commitment to teaching and and that<br>should be there OB allbe it in different<br>ways no matter whether we're in person<br>on campus or synchronously by distance<br>or asynchronously by distance the<br>commitment to teaching should be there<br>um no matter what I think that that's<br>really important to remember yeah<br>reflective practice isn't it reflective<br>practice exactly reflective practice<br>yeah I've actually found that being<br>involved in distance learning has um<br>changed my research approach so I'm now<br>researching much more my own practice so<br>I'm looking at how do we make sure that<br>our teaching is impactful how do we make<br>sure that there is sort of a a proper<br>recognition of different learning styles<br>how do we um support International<br>mature neurod dous students in this sort<br>of professional space so that's you know<br>it has changed the way I do my research<br>yeah and I'm really lucky in two ways<br>one because I teach all<br>asynchronously I've got so much<br>flexibility with my time<br>I can decide when I participate I can<br>you know I can juggle around things um<br>you know I can teach from conferences on<br>the wrong side of the time zone because<br>I just tell students where I am and I'm<br>going to be posting at weird times but I<br>will be still engaging and so it's given<br>me the flexibility to go to conferences<br>and things without having to worry about<br>Guest lectures or anything like that<br>which has been great um the other thing<br>is<br>that I forgotten what I was going to say<br>next my other oh the other Advantage is<br>of course I research yeah technology and<br>education and online distance education<br>and so my research area and my teaching<br>overlaps hugely and so I get to kind of<br>double dip so I think I've got more<br>flexibility you know more advantages<br>because of that so um I'm kind of an a<br>of you guys who teach in a different<br>space and a different topic and are<br>still working in this environment yes I<br>mean my area is um the Old Testament and<br>yes not much technology Hebrew texts um<br>long before there was any such thing as<br>Zoom or Blackboard but uh nonetheless um<br>I find that the uh the discussions that<br>we have in a distance classroom uh spark<br>questions and trains of thought that<br>really feed into my<br>research but they also encourage uh<br>students in the distance group to<br>believe that they can uh go into<br>research<br>themselves um because of course you know<br>they can do their masters and their PHD<br>by distance um<br>um most of our postgraduates are are<br>distance students and that creates its<br>own challenges yes uh huge challenges<br>sometimes um for for for the students<br>more I think than for the lecturers and<br>for for the<br>supervisors uh but there are nonetheless<br>those synergies between teaching and<br>research that you wouldn't otherwise<br>have um yeah especially informed about<br>about what is happening in in clinical<br>practice from my my students they're<br>keeping the um the reason why I'm doing<br>this work alive they give the examples<br>the lived experience examples there<br>clinicians dealing with systems and um<br>and and the complexities of of chronic<br>pain which is is my area and that means<br>that I've got more research questions<br>never short of research questions short<br>of research<br>funding but not questions um and and<br>like you our our students are are<br>thinking about things relevant to their<br>practice so their research questions<br>when they go on to Masters and in PhD<br>are really applied New Zealand based<br>questions um and that is exciting in<br>itself how how else do we have a<br>connection with our our communities um<br>unless we're really hearing what happens<br>in those communities so I I really<br>appreciate that for my my distance<br>teaching kind of nice to hear from the<br>coace rather than than just reading what<br>the research says and what the ministry<br>documents or policy documents say is<br>supposed to be happening yeah yeah yeah<br>and and doing supervision with with<br>people who saying well look I tried this<br>and look I had I have got all of these<br>locality assessments I have to to<br>complete for anyone who works with with<br>helpful no locality assessments of the<br>bane of our life and one student has<br>just had to do I think 45 different<br>locality assessments each one slightly<br>different you know and that's right<br>around the country um and that is that<br>is our reality as distance teaching<br>that's the kind of place that we work<br>where people's settings are so Vari so<br>different we have to be agile yeah and<br>not just around New Zealand know around<br>the world around the world yeah we<br>really enjoy the it's amazing the ideas<br>the um experiences the students bring in<br>I mean at the current cohort we're<br>teaching we've got students sort of as<br>Far West as the Middle East and as far<br>east as Eastern Canada and Argentina and<br>they're all in the zoom at the same time<br>so it'll be 7:30 over there and 8:00 at<br>night over there but it's the<br>experiences the knowledge and and things<br>just being able to engage with those<br>students and to think about what they're<br>actually doing and trying to achieve is<br>fabulous yeah yeah<br>yeah so what do you think people<br>contemplating or doing distance online<br>learning should be afraid of what are we<br>afraid<br>of I don't know it's um I don't think<br>they should be afraid yeah I think they<br>should embrace it as um uh a positive<br>and uh really um forward-looking uh<br>aspect of of the teaching that we do um<br>it's a way of of of bringing learning<br>that otherwise would have required<br>people to be in one place uh for a<br>particular period of<br>time is a means of taking that and<br>saying well no matter where you<br>are uh you can engage with with learning<br>uh and we will encourage you in whatever<br>ways we can to do it and you know we<br>have the technology and we have the will<br>to do it um and and that's great it's<br>just a matter of of doing the Outreach<br>and and connecting with the people who<br>want to want to be involved yeah yeah<br>one of the things I think is that most<br>of us got into teaching because we<br>wanted share knowledge yeah and share<br>our our understanding and and give<br>people the opportunity to be inquiring<br>and find out more themselves yeah and<br>this is a good vehicle for doing that<br>yeah because it opens up opportunities<br>for people who are non-traditional<br>Learners or coming from challenging<br>backgrounds to engage in a space where<br>maybe they would not have normally had<br>that opportunity and we can facilitate<br>that yeah and how how lucky are we to be<br>able to do that it's fantastic yeah yeah<br>yeah curiosity drives the me as a as a<br>an individual and also my students<br>they're curious they've got they they've<br>had a problem with the area of clinical<br>practice and they want to learn more and<br>that is what brings the life to to our<br>research to our learning to our clinical<br>practice and maybe that is what should<br>entice us to think um think about<br>distance learning that it is about<br>people in their own environments finding<br>their own issues their own problems and<br>working with us to develop solutions<br>that might be able to help them make a<br>change um if that's not what university<br>is<br>about what is you know and and I see us<br>having that connection with our<br>communities not just in New Zealand as<br>you say but right around the world<br>because we're bringing this little part<br>of university of Vago out there so<br>something about us in the way that we we<br>see the world um can get to be diffused<br>around around the world I think that<br>should be a not something to be afraid<br>of but something to be really curious<br>and to be openminded<br>about I guess what I'm afraid of is that<br>students will have a bad experience<br>either through a CO emergency teaching<br>situation or through a poorly designed<br>course which shouldn't happen at Taro<br>because we've got to go through that<br>whole process to make it you know you've<br>got to show that you're not just taking<br>your inperson class and recording the<br>lecture and calling it an online class<br>but you know one bad experience can put<br>them off this kind of learning forever<br>and I mean even the way the four of us<br>teach is very different um so I think<br>it's you know important to realize that<br>it's not one size fits all yeah yeah<br>yeah both in terms of what the lecture<br>is doing as well as what we expect from<br>the students yeah yeah Absol<br>absolutely the subject matter is<br>different the whole um pedagogy what you<br>know our theory about how people learn<br>what they're learning those are all so<br>very different and yet we can look at<br>what each other is doing and think oh I<br>could try that um those are some of the<br>cool things that I've just learned<br>through this cord already yeah and I<br>think the other thing is that people<br>even if they're they're not sure about<br>it that there's enough people who do<br>we're engaged come and ask yeah um you<br>know there there was I think the the co<br>was an opportunity for people to try<br>things and it opened people's eyes to<br>say well actually yeah it's it's not<br>what I'm used to but I think I can cope<br>with this so maybe there's time to sort<br>of say well have a chat find some people<br>sit in enjoy it hook to the distance<br>learning office workshops and networks<br>and things yeah yeah yeah and they a<br>mentoring opportunities so you know if<br>you're nervous about a distance teaching<br>or unsure about it then there are<br>networks that will enable you to work<br>with another uh more experienced uh<br>distance teacher um which benefits both<br>parties really yeah and the CM that I<br>absolutely love to totally rework a<br>paper that now the students are<br>absolutely loving um because we we<br>flipped it on its head it's been a<br>Wonder ful thing so we've got these um<br>the resources there sometimes we don't<br>know where they are or how to find them<br>but once you start make reach out and<br>ask questions and and ask for help<br>they're they're there yeah makes this a<br>really Dynamic area I think that's a<br>good place to kind of pause our<br>discussion and move to some of the<br>questions sure um I've got one from um<br>Sam who works in the international<br>student support in the international<br>office and they're interested in<br>supporting the pastoral care of students<br>and wondering how they that relationship<br>of academic support and providing that<br>level of Pastor here operates in the<br>online distinct space you know can it<br>get too much um and does it make it<br>harder to ask other areas of the<br>university to to get involved um I think<br>from our perspective because we get to<br>know our students um and there is that<br>element of pastoral care but you know<br>where you can draw the line um so it<br>there are there have been times where<br>you saying okay you're going through a<br>really difficult time what are your<br>opportunities and options now these are<br>the people within the university I know<br>can help so it's connecting them you<br>know you are as a distance student<br>they're only going to really connect<br>with one part of the university and<br>that's whoever they they see is their<br>their conduit within that program so you<br>are going to be that one point of<br>contact but knowing who to send them to<br>and at what point and you never take<br>things on that we shouldn't be taking on<br>um but it's saying well hang on a second<br>I know you should be talking to this<br>person or this person I'll put in some<br>calls you know sometimes you do try to<br>facilitate the conversation or to<br>connect to them because they they might<br>be reticent to go and ask for the help<br>they need but you facilitate that sort<br>of thing yeah yeah I know I've sometimes<br>asked the student if I can pass their<br>name on to the appropriate person like<br>Pacific island into or or or some like<br>that and said you know rather than you<br>have to reach out how about I reach out<br>on your behalf and they will contact you<br>and it just takes it takes me two<br>minutes to do that um but I mean I think<br>it's the same with our imperson students<br>they need Pastor here too and I think<br>perhaps they get missed especially if<br>you're teaching big classes do you<br>notice that someone's missing which<br>we've got records on zoom and in<br>Blackboard of who's been doing what when<br>so we can keep a better eye um but it<br>would actually be be nice to work more<br>with the international student support<br>people to talk talk with them actually<br>about how do we do it how how can we<br>work better with them because it's<br>something I hadn't thought of I think<br>it's really important actually<br>especially because it's important for us<br>to know where our our boundaries are yes<br>because um there has to be a limit to<br>what pastoral care we can offer directly<br>uh and it's really important to uh to be<br>able to have that facilitating role<br>where you can say well actually I know<br>this person in this office over here who<br>is really good at helping people in this<br>situation you know y yeah yeah one thing<br>we've also done is we've got one of our<br>staff members is a a trained clinical<br>psychologist and so we have a pastoral<br>care and well-being officer for the<br>program and that's open door um people<br>can make a time for a zoom conversation<br>at any stage and so that having somebody<br>within the program who has<br>that that support um and they can then<br>help with that conversation as well and<br>just one final question from online<br>before we move to the studio audience<br>thoughts on building connections and<br>teaching with students who don't have<br>English as a first language do you think<br>it's easier or harder in the distance<br>learning environment or in<br>person H I'm going<br>easier why when I contact them I you<br>know I always use if I if I know a<br>greeting that that you know if they've<br>used a greeting before I always make<br>sure I use their language but I think<br>just the time that they get and the fact<br>that if it's recorded they can go back<br>over it it just gives them the space to<br>actually work through that translation<br>process and but still participate in<br>discussions and things even if it's<br>taking them a bit longer cuz it's<br>another language I know we had a student<br>from Brazil who um came right through<br>our postgrad programs and did her<br>doctorate with us um where English was<br>definitely not her first language but oh<br>my goodness could she write beautifully<br>by the end yeah yeah CU sometimes the<br>in-person environment in a classroom can<br>be intimidating yes if you're not fluent<br>in the language the dominant language of<br>the of the class it can be very<br>intimidating to be there um whereas the<br>flexibility that distance learning<br>offers I think really does make it<br>easier um um not just all talking in in<br>distance learning we do lots of writing<br>and and I haven't done interpretive<br>dance but it may come it may come but<br>the the way the fact that when we have<br>some people who are really actively<br>involved in discussion and some who are<br>not and we because we can just do it<br>both verbally synchronously and then we<br>can do it<br>asynchronously means that if you are<br>somebody who's a little introvert or<br>English isn't your first language you<br>have a way to make your point or to to<br>bring your point across anyway so I<br>think we can handle it much more um<br>readily than it than you can in a in a<br>lecture type situation<br>particularly and say one final online<br>question it's given you what you said<br>about learning styles in NE diversity is<br>there a group of students that learns<br>better in<br>person I have got um one or two students<br>who said yeah I I think having done both<br>I think I like those classroom settings<br>and stuff<br>um and it also depends on whether they<br>like more of a a lecture delivery like<br>they want to be just receiving<br>information um they may not have the<br>confidence but whether that's just a<br>personal choice I'm not sure um I'd have<br>to have a I'd have to read up on that<br>it's an interesting one I know I've had<br>some students who say know they prefer<br>um you know having that direct response<br>and things and what I've usually<br>suggested is get a group of colleagues<br>together and just chat with them or you<br>know if if there's other students from<br>the class in the same city get together<br>an hour a week and and you know just<br>make your own class kind of thing and of<br>course they're always welcome to zoom or<br>or come in and meet me if they want to<br>especially talking about assignments and<br>things like that usually yeah but yeah<br>but some of them have set up Facebook<br>little Facebook group discussions and<br>chats and you know that's and they're<br>spontaneous and then they last after the<br>course is finished which is even better<br>so they're forging really good<br>connections can't accommodate anybody<br>really yeah our students each cohort has<br>an a WhatsApp group um which one of the<br>students will manage and I say it's a<br>good idea you need some people that you<br>can win about me too understand the<br>situation that you're going through the<br>coffee shop talk yeah absolutely that<br>that opportunity Network yeah that's<br>good so how about our student audience<br>sorry uh thank you panel this has been<br>uh fascinating what I'm interested to<br>know because most of your uh most of you<br>have raised the point of the approach of<br>teaching being quite relational and I<br>can see that you established these quite<br>connected relationships with your uh<br>students do they continue once the<br>course is finished I'll be interested to<br>know you know that would tell me yes<br>these are real these are real<br>relationships that have an ongoing<br>impact absolutely I can definitely say<br>from our end um so the program's been<br>going six years um we've had 25<br>graduates um they do come back um we've<br>got one who's guest lecturing um from<br>outside their professional role they<br>come in guest lecture um they very<br>active alumni um they come back and they<br>sort of we're in town shall we get it<br>together um and they keep the network<br>together between themselves as well in<br>this strong communication and for a<br>degree that's between three and six<br>years depending on whether they're<br>full-time or part-time it's a long time<br>for them to be building those<br>connections but they're very engaged<br>yeah definitely I found that especially<br>with our language papers because we um<br>we we teach sometimes two to three hours<br>a week so the students are and you are<br>in the same<br>classroom uh online for for that amount<br>of time each week so over a period of a<br>semester you built a pro relationship<br>with those students and and they've<br>built up a relationship with one another<br>and that tends to continue uh and it<br>tends to spark new um ideas and new<br>Ambitions for future<br>study yeah I definitely know that we<br>have really good relationships we have a<br>a Facebook group called The no no I<br>won't I won't reveal the name but it's a<br>it's a an interesting name and it it's<br>sort of points to the fact that we talk<br>about everything including pain because<br>Pain's our topic and it's been going now<br>for about seven years I think so yes and<br>we just add people people come in and<br>out of it as they choose and when we do<br>get together it's like we've never been<br>a part it's wonderful M mhm Y and<br>another chrisan yes is it<br>working yes it is working um you were<br>also enthusiastic about um about<br>distance teaching it's amazing and I did<br>distance teaching for many years as well<br>and I I found that the people who it was<br>people who had already been out had life<br>experience who were mature students is<br>that mostly the teaching that you're<br>talking about now is it mostly students<br>who have um kind of postgraduate papers<br>or students who yeah I'm just wondering<br>about that because now I teach a first<br>year paper and I'm wondering about you<br>know the transferring of some of the<br>things that you've talked about which<br>are so positive in the distance online<br>and the connections trying to see<br>whether some of that learning can be<br>transferred to a large first year class<br>that's face to face that is got quite is<br>quite a different environment I've got a<br>colleague who having experienced Co<br>times is now using online Blackboard<br>discussions in her first year papers and<br>has actually done I think she did a a c<br>career um where she talked about it um<br>but I'm very happy to put you in touch<br>with her if you want to talk about how<br>she's doing it but she's finding it<br>actually really deepened the the the<br>depth of thinking of her first year<br>students and that some who are not you<br>know participating in tutorials and<br>things are really active online so it's<br>definitely worth thinking yet we started<br>teaching theology by distance I think it<br>was in<br>1990 long before I I came here Paul<br>trilo was one of the drivers of that and<br>um and we've done it ever since and<br>that's been from first year all right<br>the way through so uh we have a few<br>students not very many but we have a few<br>students who who did our first year<br>papers and went on to do Masters and<br>PhD um and uh it's partly in theology<br>it's because a lot of our students are<br>are uh in Ministry either full-time or<br>part-time uh they have responsibilities<br>both in terms of uh work Ministry family<br>all sorts of things uh and so in a sense<br>they they they don't have a lot of<br>choice other than to take part in<br>whatever level they're studying at uh by<br>distance and so you just adapt it to uh<br>to the particular level that that<br>they're at uh and it works perfectly<br>well it's it's as enriching as it would<br>be uh 400 level or or Beyond yeah the<br>discussions that people have that really<br>make the learning quite deep um and I<br>studied a Facebook<br>group did I say social<br>media so I studied a Facebook group and<br>how learning was constructed by those<br>participants and we've I've drawn the<br>same principles across to the way that I<br>pose questions and the the discussion<br>kind of orientation on blackboard with<br>our our distance students and it's<br>exactly the same in watching different<br>viewpoints being expressed and finally<br>someone says oh so what you mean is and<br>they paraphrase it and put it into their<br>own language I think that's um that's<br>applicable across every learning stage<br>of course the more you dig in the more<br>different um opinions and perspectives<br>you get and people have to feel<br>comfortable to be able to do that so I<br>think that the distance learning part<br>helps to facilitate that comfort with um<br>we are on the same team we're<br>understanding one another even though<br>we've got different perspectives and<br>perhaps that takes a little bit of time<br>um compete with a first year paper<br>partly that's age partly that's the<br>number of people that are are involved<br>in the first year paper and partly it's<br>about learning how to learn and the<br>discussion is actually learning yeah<br>and I know we can keep talking about<br>this for hours but unfortunately we're<br>out of time so um first I'd like to<br>thank my panel members um who've been<br>here and I think we've had a really<br>interesting discussion I know whenever I<br>get together with other distance<br>learning people and talk I always take<br>away a couple of things I want to try in<br>my papers so we need to do more of this<br>um I'd also like to thank our audience<br>both in the studio here with us and<br>online on zoom and of course I really<br>want to thank the sponsors of this<br>series which is the committee for<br>advancement of learning and teaching and<br>and finally but not least a wonderful<br>media production team who's done a great<br>job of getting all this working and<br>taking as novices and making us not look<br>too silly tune in again for the next<br>episode watch out for when the next C<br>I</p></main><footer style="margin-top: 2rem; background: #0001; padding: 2rem; text-align: center;"><p>We Are The
