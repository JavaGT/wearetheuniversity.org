you all I am Tony<br>Balentine I'm the deputy Vice Chancellor<br>external engagement and I have the great<br>honor and pleasure of Hosting this<br>inaugural professorial lecture a very<br>warm welcome to all of those all of you<br>who have joined us here in our Castle<br>lecture theater this evening in person<br>and also greetings to those of you<br>joining us online either live or uh<br>watching the recording at some point in<br>the<br>future and my Mei I acknowledged uh<br>where we are the location where we are<br>gathered manaa who are obviously our<br>treaty partner acknowledge those who<br>have passed before and then returned uh<br>to the room greeting all of you but<br>especially G greeting Professor Russell<br>I greeted your family and friends as<br>well and I especially want to<br>acknowledge your partner noi and your<br>children Mina and Matthew I also part on<br>warm regards and best wishes from<br>Professor Helen Nicholson her acting<br>Vice chancellor who is unfortunately<br>unable to join us this evening inaugural<br>professorial lectures are important<br>events they're very special occasions<br>they embody and celebrate the<br>that are at the heart of the<br>university and its Mission the scholarly<br>Journey the creation of new knowledge<br>and the transmission of knowledge<br>created through research uh to students<br>to colleagues and to the interested<br>public these are events with a very long<br>Tradition at the University ofo right<br>back to our foundation professors in the<br>early 1870s they gave in audal<br>professorial lectures like us to student<br>to their colleagues but also to the<br>interested public so it is great that we<br>have maintained this tradition and it is<br>fantastic that all of us have come<br>together this evening to celebrate the<br>work of Professor<br>Russell but it is also a celebration of<br>the place of knowledge in making our<br>community uh I think that's enough for<br>me I'm very pleased to be handing over<br>to Professor day who offer a for more<br>noroot right tanoto CA uh welcome and<br>good evening everyone it's great to see<br>so many people here I'm C uh Katherine<br>day and I'm the deputy dean of the<br>school of biomedical Sciences it's my<br>pleasure to uh to to uh be here on<br>behalf of the dean Professor Lisa maton<br>Smith who unfortunately couldn't be here<br>but sends her regrads uh and so really<br>it's an honor to introduce tonight's<br>inreal professorial lecture or IPL by<br>Professor ruce Bruce Russell Russell I'm<br>G to get my words Tangled uh and so<br>Bruce as you all know is from the M<br>microbiology and Immunology Department<br>within the school of biomedical sciences<br>and it is really a delight we are very<br>lucky to have Bruce here in the ago<br>Community he hails from Queensland which<br>I think again many will know uh where he<br>completed his undergraduate studies at<br>James Cook University in<br>1994 and then he went on to complete his<br>PhD at the University of Queensland in<br>2001 um following his undergraduate<br>studies Bruce joined the Australian<br>Defense Force and he had postings to a<br>range of interesting uh uh locations and<br>I think some of these were tropical and<br>so while I think he had an exciting time<br>on a range of fronts this time in the US<br>not in the US in the Australian Defense<br>Force had a really big impact on Bruce's<br>career and he went on to complete his<br>PhD in uh tropical diseases uh at the<br>Australian Army malaria Institute while<br>in the Defense Force so there is a<br>significant period in the Defense Force<br>that really has had a huge impact on uh<br>Bruce's<br>career following completion of his PhD<br>in<br>1994 uh he then no 2001 he then went uh<br>and did or continued as postdoctoral<br>studies so first uh continuing on at the<br>Australian Army Mal malaria Institute<br>and then at the US National Academy of<br>Sciences but based in several of their<br>different labs and I think again<br>spending time in uh fairly tropical<br>places and Thailand and other places and<br>I'm sure he's going to tell us some of<br>that uh in his story tonight and<br>throughout his time really Bruce was<br>committed to advancing our understanding<br>of malaria with really a a huge focus on<br>improving diagnosis and treatment and<br>this meant that he spent a huge amount<br>of time uh in field Laboratories uh<br>really working with patients and<br>thinking about how to improve uh<br>diagnosis and outcomes for these<br>patients and his research has had<br>considerable impact and he's received a<br>number of awards during his time and I<br>was uh reviewing his CV before coming<br>tonight and one of the awards he was<br>designated as an alien of extraordinary<br>significance by the US Army uh Surgeon<br>General so I think not many of us have<br>had that designation so maybe again<br>he'll tell us tonight we'll see um so<br>post-doctoral study was followed by a<br>period uh as a research fellow at the<br>Howard Flory Institute and he worked in<br>the international Health laboratory in<br>Darwin uh for several years and then<br>from there he went to the National<br>University of Singapore where Bruce was<br>an assistant professor and continued his<br>work on uh malaria so a long period of<br>uh uh I guess building uh before he came<br>to otago in<br>2016 so from uh Singapore he came here<br>and uh really he's uh made a significant<br>contribution uh in research and teaching<br>uh since then but as well as before or<br>uh Bruce has a distinguished research<br>portfolio as we expect for someone<br>promoted Professor 120 Publications in<br>an H index of 41 so uh by a lot of<br>metrics doing really well but also<br>having impact so Bruce's work is highly<br>collaborative and he works with a range<br>of uh Partners in different centers and<br>I think this has been part Central to<br>much of Bruce's success and he's had a<br>lot of uh really good papers since<br>coming to Oto and I note there are<br>papers in nature microbiology and nature<br>Communications in recent years um very<br>high impact journals uh and it's a<br>credit to Bruce's uh I guess the<br>research caliber that he has been<br>producing all this T research takes<br>funding and Bruce has uh had some<br>success at getting funding from Gates<br>Foundation HRC mden uh these are all<br>tough to get the uh funding is tough to<br>get and uh it's again a good success so<br>research is not enough to be promoted to<br>professor and uh teaching is also that<br>uh something that I know Bruce is really<br>passionate about and has had a huge<br>impact both mentoring students and uh<br>taking leadership roles in courses and<br>and then actually just delivering a lot<br>of<br>lectures and so of particular note uh<br>Bruce was the convenor of sales 1 91 one<br>of the large hsfy papers from 2017 to<br>202 21 this was both a time when there<br>was curriculum review and coid Chaos um<br>so I think it's a credit to uh Bruce<br>that uh navigated uh this period and so<br>that's uh shows leadership and<br>commitment which was really important so<br>Bruce cons continues to inspire students<br>he teaches at first year uh and then he<br>teaches at a range of other levels and I<br>note um that Bruce has received a number<br>of awards from the oo medical student<br>Association uh really uh acknowledging<br>the quality and uh the pop I guess the<br>impact that his teaching is having<br>because it's not always easy to get the<br>medical students to think you're doing a<br>good job so again that's impressive so<br>um I really look forward to hearing<br>Bruce's Journey from to Professor of uh<br>parasitology and tonight's talk entitled<br>jungle fever so uh the stage is yours<br>Jay<br>it was about 11:00 at<br>night but I strolled on still with the<br>people suddenly on the left side of the<br>road there was a crackling amongst the<br>bushes all of us were<br>alarmed and in an instant<br>a<br>tiger pounced upon the first of our<br>party and carried him off in a twinkling<br>of an<br>eye the rush of the<br>animal and the crush of the poor<br>victim's bones in his mouth and His Last<br>Cry of<br>distress oh hi oh hi it involuntarily<br>echoed around all of<br>and then I not knowing what had happened<br>till I returned to my senses found<br>myself and my<br>companions lying on the<br>ground as if prepared to be devoured by<br>our<br>Jungle I find my pen incapable of<br>describing that Dreadful Mo that<br>our limbs stiffened our power of speech<br>ceased and our hearts beat<br>violently and only a whisper of the oh<br>high of distress was heard from us and<br>it was in this state that we crawled on<br>all<br>fours and then ran for half an hour like<br>an Arab<br>village after<br>this every one of us was attacked with a<br>fever and attended with<br>shivering within which deplorable State<br>morning although the<br>author of this and his com remaining<br>comp companions escaped the warm jaws<br>tiger it would seem that all of them<br>ended up with a<br>fever a fever which acted as a Harbinger<br>for probably something even more deadly<br>tiger<br>this Malaysian<br>jungle is handful<br>here breathing up the warm fumes and the<br>humid geosmin coming up from the leaf<br>matter around my feet and listening to<br>the cacophony of competing evening songs<br>of birds and insects<br>monkeys I had this ridiculous thought in<br>my mind what would happen if a tiger<br>came out and ate me of course a<br>ridiculous<br>thought yet this tickling<br>paranoia as I was certainly being<br>observed I was being observed by a<br>predators and here in 19 in<br>2019 I was invited by these in two<br>incredible scientists Professor<br>ying and Indra who's perhaps one of the<br>most foremost Medical entomologists in<br>the<br>world here we sat on our little<br>crates in this jungle one trouser leg<br>rolled up with a little torch and a<br>attack of the 3,000 mosquito species in<br>the world The enophiles Gambia mosquito<br>is perhaps the deadliest it carries the<br>fala<br>malaria only the female mosquitoes Gorge<br>themselves on blood they need that for<br>their eggs<br>the eggs are laid on Clear Water they<br>hatch into ly and then into<br>puper it takes about a week going from<br>egg to fully eclosed mosquito and here's<br>back to my leg in that Malaysian jungle<br>this mosquito hungry one has been<br>following me probably for an hour<br>focusing on the plume of carbon dioxide<br>coming out of my<br>mouth<br>many people think when a mosquito bites<br>you it's like a hypodermic neble being<br>pushed in and then the mosquito sucking<br>hungrily like a thick shake up up<br>through a straw but it's not the way it<br>is it's more like micro surgery Keyhole<br>surgery here the laum which is this<br>outer covering of the prosus can be<br>covers up these incredible nasty<br>collection of instruments six of them in<br>fact the outer two the maxil have razor<br>sharp and they vibrate at 15 Hertz<br>cutting through the skin like<br>butter then they used the mandibles to<br>pull the skin apart and insert the other<br>sharp<br>instruments the labam the labrum this<br>gutter shaped micro surgery tool draws<br>the blood up but not only that it has<br>sensors on it that can actually sense<br>the red blood vessel and it changes the<br>vibration to five Hertz to cut through<br>painlessly into the blood and the blood<br>is then sent up to the mosquito and it's<br>concentrated the water expelled out the<br>back and the red cells concentrated<br>in but this is the important point the<br>center the center tool the<br>hypx injects the saliva this saliva is a<br>cocktail of of antiseptic anticoag which<br>allows the easy flow of blood up into<br>the gut of the<br>mosquito but the actual<br>injection of the saliva is the problem<br>mosquito this infected anop mosquito is<br>currently injecting its saliva to help<br>this Blood come up through its<br>mouth but as you'll see<br>it's not only<br>injected saliva it's injecting malaria<br>parasites which we call<br>sporozoites these liver seeking missiles<br>are covered with a Shaggy protein called<br>CSP which acts as a kind of<br>countermeasure against the host immune<br>system only a few of these boros whites<br>make it out and into the blood maybe<br>about 10 most of them are sucked back<br>but of those 10 all of them all of them<br>liver their target the parimal<br>cells these liver parimal cells are<br>where they want to<br>go but to get there and to show their<br>complete disregard for our immune<br>system they actually use our immune<br>cells like Cula cells to actually burrow<br>through as a Gateway into our parimal<br>cells<br>and there it'll work through our parimal<br>cells killing a few cells no symptoms at<br>this stage for<br>us but then it will find its little home<br>and it will start to<br>multiply oh and what an amazing<br>is from one copy of the parasite to<br>30,000 in a week a again at this stage<br>these are growing in your liver you<br>won't have any idea there's no<br>symptoms eventually<br>though these 30,000 meos white burst out<br>of the liver cell and enter the blood<br>each one of those meites will never go<br>back to the liver it's a one-way Street<br>into our blood because these meizo white<br>protein uh parasites are actually after<br>and these are the juicy bags of<br>hemoglobin that they target C full of<br>protein that the parasite would use to<br>30 now an interesting thing is is that<br>most malaria parasites and certainly the<br>deadly fala malaria parasite isn't<br>particularly fussy with what type of<br>cell it invades it'll invade any red<br>blood cell at any<br>stage however I've spent much of my<br>career studying a not so deadly form of<br>malaria but an equally distressing one<br>that causes incredible burden right<br>throughout the world particularly in the<br>Asia Pacific<br>region and that's plasmodium<br>viac unlike falam and many of its kin it<br>doesn't like to in fact it won't invade<br>normal mature red cells it's after the<br>sites in fact this parasite will only<br>invade very young reticul sites and the<br>team of scientists that I've worked with<br>notably Professor Laurent renier benoir<br>maler Rees and way Hong we've worked<br>together on a number of important<br>projects trying to work out how the<br>malaria parasite one works out that it's<br>going into a reticular side or is this a<br>reticular side or another cell so we're<br>looking at not only the receptors on the<br>reticular side which made us actually<br>look really really closely at reticular<br>cytosis because in fact this process<br>from in the bone marrow where all of our<br>red blood cells are produced most of our<br>red blood cells are produced as an adult<br>um move right through this process<br>starting in the bone marrow and then<br>being squeezed out into the sinusoids<br>and in out into the blood<br>stream interestingly F we found that<br>plasmodium viac will only invade these<br>very young reticular sites importantly<br>we found that the very protein that the<br>our red cells used to<br>bring hemog uh iron into the red cells<br>which is the transferin receptor is<br>uses irrespective of what particular<br>cell a malaria parasite enters once it<br>enters that's when misery starts<br>occurring the parasite sheds itself of<br>remaining proteins around the outside<br>and creates a little bubble with inside<br>the cell from which it can can<br>comfortably uh start chewing up the<br>hemoglobin it will then start to export<br>a range of proteins to the cytoskeleton<br>of our red blood<br>cells causing the Red Cell to<br>become stiff and sticky most red blood<br>cells are very very deformable flexible<br>and can move through tiny micro<br>capillary<br>beds but the malaria parasite causes<br>these red blood cells to become<br>sticky and<br>stiff this<br>transmission uh scanning electron<br>microscope you can see an infected red<br>blood cell of plasmodium falum the one<br>that kills<br>people in fact it kills someone every 30<br>seconds still by the time the end of<br>this lecture about a 100 people have<br>died through the infective bite<br>parasite but becoming stiff and sticky<br>for the parasite in exporting all those<br>proteins and changing the red cell<br>causes a problem for the<br>parasite because every vertebrate has<br>this organ called the<br>spleen and the spleen contains amongst<br>other parts of its Anatomy the white<br>pulp there is the red pulp and the red<br>pulp is a mechanical<br>filter<br>this mechanical<br>filter basically sorts all of our red<br>blood cells every single one of us who<br>has a Spain still<br>um will all have all of our red blood<br>cells have to move from this side into<br>the splenic sinusoid Lumen and to do so<br>it has to squeeze through these one or<br>two Micron<br>gaps a cell of eight microns in size has<br>to squeeze through these little slits<br>and it kind of filters and tests each<br>individual red cell is it is it flexible<br>is it good if it doesn't make the test<br>if it can't make it through<br>here it gets retained on the other<br>side these cells are then degraded<br>destroyed and fagos by a range of<br>lucites that are found white blood cells<br>our immune cells that they're hungrily<br>gobbling up anything that stays and this<br>is a problem for malaria parasites if<br>you're a stiff and sticky malaria<br>parasite you can't make it through there<br>you're going to be retained and<br>concentrated here where the white blood<br>cells<br>are so throughout all my career and for<br>most of the lectures up until a couple<br>of years<br>ago this is the story I've been telling<br>students the spleen is a parasite trap<br>paraside<br>wrong some incredible work recently led<br>by Professor Nick Hy of the meny school<br>of health research in Darwin with um his<br>postto Stephen Co and our incredible<br>long-term collaborator Annie kangam one<br>of the most fabulous scientists I've<br>ever worked with and one of the few<br>papan women who are doctors and uh<br>academics working in the field<br>today and they found something<br>incredible they found that far from<br>being parasite hell a huge quantity in<br>fact over 90% of parasite biomass is<br>actually being concentrated in our<br>spleens a parasites seem to be having a<br>party in our<br>spleen which seems to fly against<br>everything we thought we knew how on<br>Earth Can parasites survive in the red<br>how infected red cells the malaria<br>parasite in fact all species malaria<br>species cover themselves with uninfected<br>red blood cells this is a process we<br>call rosetting malaria rosetting and you<br>can see the centrally infected Red Cell<br>here covered with uninfected red blood<br>cells my Brazilian colleagues Fabio<br>Costa and Lusa ook um and my Malaysian<br>colleague<br>WCHA and also my Singaporean colleague<br>luron renia we worked out<br>that these rosting parasites are<br>impervious to<br>fagocitosis it protects them from<br>osis malaria parasites cover themselves<br>in a coat of your red blood cells to<br>clearance of course up until now there's<br>been no fever there's been no straint<br>it's only when that red cell<br>bursts and releases all of the parasite<br>Pro<br>proteins parasite waste products<br>particularly<br>hemo uh that you will suddenly get that<br>fever that's when you get your fever<br>when all of those red blood cells<br>synchronously burst open and in fact for<br>many years that is how scientists and<br>doctors for as long as we have known uh<br>written down uh medical case reports<br>have described malaria in terms of that<br>periodicity<br>between fevers some malaria uh parasites<br>most of them have a 48h hour period<br>where it takes after the invasion of the<br>red blood cell to its bursting is 2 days<br>that means you have a fever every two<br>days some other parasites take three<br>days some monkey parasites like one that<br>is currently going right throughout<br>Malaysia and is killing lots of people<br>very quickly zootic type of malaria<br>period I've spent a lot of time trying<br>to work out how red blood cells and how<br>they've been affected how the reology of<br>these red infected red cells affect the<br>pathology of<br>malaria and with uh Nick Hy when I was<br>working with him in Darwin uh and this<br>amazing team of microbiologists Kevin<br>tan who's now the head of department for<br>microbiology in nus and uh CT Lim and<br>Lee Young uh of bioengineering in<br>Singapore we developed these<br>microfluidic<br>chambers that uh actually mimic what's<br>going on in the microfluidics and we<br>actually coated these microfluidic<br>Chambers in endothelial cells and<br>receptors so that we could observe<br>closeand and not only<br>that we actually took these<br>devices up to West Papa into Tima beside<br>patients up into the Tha Myanmar border<br>beside patients taking BL X Vivo and<br>looking at it and examining<br>it unfortunately this particular isolate<br>was from someone who passed away to<br>sample<br>and it's not going to<br>work anyway what this video<br>shows is red blood cells moving through<br>rosetting in directly from a patient and<br>literally clogging<br>up and causing incredible uh Downstream<br>blockage causing any kind of perfusion<br>Downstream of where the blockage occurs<br>um and causing the patient of course if<br>you have uh your brain infected with<br>circulation the subsequent effects are<br>horrific this patient who has given us<br>believe it or not managed to give us uh<br>permission to take this<br>photo um came in he was a someone who<br>had recently arrived arrived in Tima<br>he's a gold miner panning gold he'd<br>never seen malaria in Java but when he<br>came to Tima he was hit straight away<br>coma this is a touch Ando<br>period you'll notice this<br>bag this uh from a catheter urinary<br>catheter it's not blood it's urine these<br>red blood cells that are burst and<br>destroyed as they get ground up going<br>through their capillary systems causing<br>terrible hematuria my colleague uh sinw<br>uh who's an amazing ID doctor an<br>incredible in fact very interesting<br>story about Sin is that he came to denan<br>before me I think he worked on some<br>mathematical modeling with Steve duffel<br>and uh he also decided to go surfing<br>here<br>um but sin had a very deep deep interest<br>in looking at um how we could perhaps<br>use medications and other types of uh<br>therapies to improve the outcome<br>coma the best way is to give the person<br>Artis unate Artis unate is an incredibly<br>potent and it is currently the main stay<br>within 2 hours of treatment the patient<br>was responsive and was fine and he<br>quickly recovered and we were talking<br>with him very quickly afterwards this is<br>an incredible drug there's only a one<br>problem since 2008 this indestructible<br>drug that we thought we had is now<br>resistance and the resistance first<br>started on the Cambodian Thai border<br>and then it moved to the Myanmar Thai<br>border um one of my great Heroes is<br>Professor franois<br>noston who's a Oxford Professor but<br>who's really enters the hallowed Halls<br>of Oxford because he spends all of his<br>time living on the Tha Myanmar border<br>working with the people and doing his<br>very best to work out how we can deal<br>with drug resist distant malaria and to<br>it aside from the drug resistance that<br>we're starting to find creeping in<br>throughout the timear Border we're also<br>finding resistance to Other Drugs<br>including chloroquin which we use to<br>treat viac malaria that's that malaria<br>that invades reticul sites that I was<br>talking about<br>earlier these<br>uh<br>parasites are quite interesting in that<br>they also invade the liver but instead<br>of taking seven days to pop<br>out they're kind of like cats they move<br>when they want to and these parasites in<br>plasmodium viac will pop out at any time<br>that they we don't know when they will<br>pop out these dormant hypnoses that we<br>find in the liver of plasmodium viac pop<br>out from time to time and the problem<br>with that is that means we get relapsing<br>fever although it's not deadly this<br>incredible case study of a a pregnant<br>woman that we followed over a period of<br>200 days she had over nine reoccurrences<br>of malaria despite numerous treatment<br>protocols she had it back again not only<br>from relapsing but also because of drug<br>resistance<br>because we found for the first time<br>chloroquin resistance in this viac<br>parasite which had never been found<br>before much of this work I should<br>mention is uh run by this incredible<br>person a pure<br>Angel Rose mccre gives and gives and<br>gives and gives another Oxford<br>Professor very down toe self-facing<br>person who just wants to give to the<br>people<br>and do good work she's only interested<br>in doing work that helps women<br>particularly those who are pregnant with<br>malaria and um in way of helping Rose<br>I'm going to give her a bit of a<br>advertisement she's recently started up<br>a foundation if you are in the business<br>of giving some money occasionally to<br>Great foundations I highly recommend<br>Rose's Foundation she's an incredible<br>person and the work that she has done<br>has literally saved I I I would happy to<br>save tens of thousands of<br>lives<br>directly so this business not only are<br>we seeing relapses we're also seeing<br>chloric resistance chloroquin resistance<br>is important for viac falci malaria the<br>deadly one it's been resistant to to<br>chloroquin for since the<br>1980s we didn't think viac in fact there<br>was a lot of people out there who said<br>oh it's impossible for viac to become<br>resistant to chloroquin it certainly did<br>and we found this particular woman had<br>some serious problems with with<br>chloroquin that's a real problem because<br>chloroquin is a got a very long halflife<br>when you give someone chloroquin it<br>hangs around in the blood for many hours<br>many days it's got a half life of about<br>30 days which means<br>that when hypnoses are reactivated<br>within a 28-day period it means that the<br>chloroquin is still in the blood and it<br>can still hit those parasites that are<br>popping out again so when we have<br>chloroquin resistance to such a safe and<br>relatively useful drug particularly for<br>treating pregnant women and<br>issue my early years in the Army that<br>was one of the very first things I did<br>was working in banville Island trying to<br>work out how bad the chloroquin<br>resistance<br>was um and that involved a lot of<br>working with the local people it didn't<br>particularly like me very much because I<br>was Australian and Australians weren't<br>well- loved in burenville kiwis were<br>know but it was here that um I had<br>people people such as Kyle reichman who<br>developed the xvivo drug sensitivity<br>assay for looking at<br>viac um he invented it and he was my the<br>director of the army malaria Institute<br>Chin Chan was pretty much my first boss<br>in the Army Malia Institute an<br>incredible scientist who's still at the<br>um at the appointment at the Australian<br>Army and also with queenan<br>University and of course Rick price I<br>worked with Rick after I left the Army I<br>was also working on chloro and<br>resistance uh in Papa trying to work out<br>on what we really need though is a drug<br>that targets these dormant forms these<br>forms that pop out if you go overseas<br>and let's say you decide that you would<br>like to go and see the some marut tang<br>in Borneo and then you come back and<br>you've been infected with viac you could<br>be driving your car one day and all of a<br>sudden you'll start shaking and getting<br>very sick that's because these hypnoses<br>have just decided to pop out this is a<br>problem with viac<br>malaria and we need a drug that can<br>eradicate those the current treatment is<br>basically two weeks being treated three<br>days uh three times a day with primacin<br>it's a terrible regime and it's poorly<br>complied no one no one ever wants to<br>take that<br>so we want something better and that's<br>certainly what I was involved in in my<br>early again early time of my career we<br>started working with Mike edstein who's<br>a at this stage who's a lieutenant<br>colonel and major uh Dennis Kyle this is<br>at the Walter Reed where I first started<br>my work as a<br>postdoc but they wanted me to go out<br>into the field so I was still in the<br>Army at that time so I went out with the<br>Thai soldiers where we'd run the actual<br>drug assays and uh my job was there<br>taking blood off the tie troops to make<br>sure that they weren't getting sick from<br>this new<br>drug and this new drug is called<br>teenin<br>teenin um is a great drug in that we<br>only have to give one<br>dose instead of um multiple doses over a<br>couple of<br>weeks and it seems to work very well<br>well the only problem<br>is is that it's hardly a Panacea it's<br>about 60 to 70% effective at getting rid<br>of these dormant forms and the other<br>problem that we have is that<br>it's uh you can't give it to people who<br>deficiency you'll remember that terrible<br>picture of someone who was uh was in had<br>a coma due to falci<br>malaria<br>well the fact that we have Artis unate<br>resistance has caused quite an emergency<br>amongst the community it hasn't become a<br>World Health Organization emergency<br>unfortunately but it's certainly amongst<br>the malaria Community it certainly<br>is and we've decided that we had to<br>produce as many new drugs as possible<br>particularly to kill falci malaria those<br>ones stick in the brain and the kidneys<br>and the liver we needed something that<br>would clear it as fast and we did we<br>found this bindon a new totally new<br>class this work LED was directed by Ty<br>Deana but his inspired chemist Brian<br>Yung and amazing biologist Pablo biffany<br>uh we this this drug uh is now the<br>fastest acting antimalarial that we have<br>it affects basically the parasites<br>ability to maintain osmotic balance and<br>they basically pop this is a healthy<br>parasite up the top and the parasites<br>down<br>below um have been treated with the<br>spalone nitd 609 which is currently in<br>trials now I come to the very important<br>part of my talk as Katherine<br>mentioned um noted that I have many<br>collaborators and I've mentioned quite a<br>few of them as I've gone through my talk<br>but there is a special group of people<br>who have always been there to back me up<br>and to the younger members of the<br>audience or those early in your research<br>career it's really important that you<br>establish long-term mentors people who<br>are going to stick by you through thick<br>and thin and these are just a number of<br>many uh luron just an amazing uh<br>leader George sonunu uh basically rewr<br>half of rewrote half of my papers i'<br>send copies to George and he'd go<br>through and he has an amazing way of<br>looking at things Dominic mesier and<br>Carol sibi have been people who I've<br>never really worked much with but every<br>time I meet them they want to know what<br>I'm up to we keep correspondence from<br>time to time and every now and then<br>they're there<br>helping me with references and things<br>like<br>that but now I come to the<br>most important collaborator that I've<br>ever<br>had and has been Central to my<br>career name hasn't been put on any of<br>the other slides because I'd leave it to<br>embarrassed<br>all of the work that I've mentioned on<br>collaborator almost everything I've done<br>has been done with Dr Rosser and saan<br>rck and I say queen of culture here this<br>is rosarin or noi as she likes to be<br>called and this is adelyn CH I should<br>say Queens of culture because both of<br>these women manag to manag to culture<br>some of the most difficult to work on<br>malaria parasites to do any work in<br>malaria you need to be able to culture<br>the bug and it's very difficult with<br>malaria and these individuals car Adin<br>who's by the way an Naro PhD graduate of<br>mine I'm very proud to<br>say um was also trained by noi as she<br>trains all of the PhD students that come<br>through my lab and all of the Masters<br>and all of the all of the honor students<br>too<br>so who is<br>noi who is rosar and sanak well she's<br>one of these people who was lucky enough<br>to get their degree from a a king the<br>pipon and after her PhD noi produced<br>some of the most important work on the<br>pathopysiology of viac malaria her work<br>from her PhD was published in<br>infectious diseases and it's actually<br>still like one of the classic texts that<br>we look to to look for how things work<br>in this species of<br>malaria I thought it was a good idea<br>that we actually formalize our<br>collaboration and get married yes that<br>is<br>sorry<br>but noi uh noi continued to decide to<br>work with me through thick and<br>thin uh some of her work has been<br>amazing uh this work um this this figure<br>which is appears in a science journal<br>for the spend alones was work done by<br>noi figure one work done by her she's<br>World known for this particular type of<br>work<br>incredible this was the Lynch pin of<br>this paper we were given powder unmarked<br>bags by novad we had to go to the field<br>it and this work has been cited quite a<br>bit because it's hopefully going to be<br>the next big anti-malarial for<br>treating noi has published over 50<br>papers even some books on medicinal<br>malaria and<br>uh and it's not just all about promoting<br>her own particular interest as soon as<br>she got here she teamed up with two<br>incredible women uh elain Burgess and<br>Rosalie goldsworthy of penguin rescue<br>and since she's been here in ATO noi has<br>been responsible for the molecular<br>diagnosis rapid molecular diagnosis and<br>microscopic<br>diagnosis of penguin malaria which has<br>killed tens of healthy breeding par um<br>of penguins inago so when I was told<br>when I was going to New Zealand everyone<br>said oh there's no malaria in in New<br>Zealand well actually there is is's Aven<br>malaria and it's killing our little<br>yellowy penguins<br>hewis and uh a range of other native<br>birds that have never seen malaria<br>parasites<br>before I really have to thank first of<br>all noi because I wouldn't beat<br>literally I wouldn't be in New Zealand<br>if it wasn't for for for noi because she<br>was the one that handed me the Ito<br>newspaper clipping and said you've got<br>to go for<br>this um and I had one try it it and<br>didn't get it I tried again and finally<br>Clive let me through the door thank you<br>Clive and also Vernon Ward um I remember<br>the interview I had with with Clive and<br>Vernon and uh thank you for taking a<br>chance on me I knew you were a bit<br>worried about having a parasitologist<br>here Greg then took over as head of<br>department and I must say I uh Greg it's<br>thank you very much you're you're an<br>incredible leader and I'm really really<br>um sorry that you'll be heading back to<br>my home Hometown uh it's not just a loss<br>for for Oto it's a loss for New Zealand<br>Greg is one of the top three<br>microbiologists in this this country and<br>his his uh move to quut uh it will be<br>will be will be<br>hard um and also Emily uh Emily I Emily<br>is just always there directing things<br>along quietly working behind the desk by<br>know that so much that happens goes<br>through her hands and she keeps the<br>track going and she keeps going despite<br>negative comments and other things Emily<br>Emily I've made so many great friends<br>and colleagues at<br>atago um James James and I often pray<br>together thank you James for your<br>support Alex we often laugh<br>together um and thank you for the Cups<br>of Tea you're a great buddy to have and<br>you've really been a great mentor while<br>I've been here at at at the University<br>Muriel uh used to send me all of the<br>interesting emails when I first were<br>coming about what to wear and what not<br>to wear in in need it Remy thank you<br>very much Remy for joining my lab Remy<br>is incredible he's originally from Yemen<br>uh and he's just really built an amazing<br>research career he's got the only we've<br>developed the only cryptos peridium<br>culture lab in the Southern Hemisphere<br>and one of three in the world and it's<br>all done by Remy and his amazing<br>students Megan Warren and<br>Jen I don't know what I'd do without you<br>you have saved my backside so many times<br>thank you so much sorry for all of my<br>mistakes you guys are just amazing and<br>you really are at the heart of what what<br>this University is about which is an<br>incredible experience for students Megan<br>you put up with all of the bi security<br>stuff luckily I've got noi who's managed<br>to uh keep things ordered if if I didn't<br>have noi I know that I'd Megan would<br>want to kill me<br>within and just a few other people I'd<br>like to mention T thank you very much<br>tin tentin and I have been to Myanmar a<br>few times to do to look at a few<br>projects up there an incredible<br>colleague I also want to thank Alan<br>Clark and Chris Harry they're no longer<br>with us anymore but when I first came to<br>the department these guys I used to have<br>tea in the morning coffee in the morning<br>and little Breakfast Club they're just<br>amazing people you know their job<br>description was like this but what they<br>did was<br>this because they loved us they thought<br>we were family and so they would do so<br>much more than what was on the job<br>description I'm sorry to see them go<br>after SSL SSR or whatever it's called<br>that name which we shouldn't mention<br>and finally Alan Hughes who stepped into<br>Alan um things have been tough sometimes<br>here and uh before I arrived at this<br>University um I have a bookcase full of<br>Christopher Hitchens and Dawkin I was a<br>big disciple of theirs came to New<br>Zealand and uh become a Christian uh so<br>for those of you who are in your eyes<br>now saying oh no um I blame you guys<br>because I was a self-respecting atheist<br>before I came to this beautiful<br>country but um certainly uh these people<br>have been there at some of the tough<br>times we've lost people in our<br>department and these incredible people<br>have been there Rose Scott um runs a<br>family service for um that I bring my<br>children to first first month of every<br>uh first Sunday of every month at the<br>trinity Anglican church and uh last the<br>last service we had was a blessing of<br>the animals so all of the congregation<br>brought their animals dogs and we<br>brought our orphan Lambs this is my son<br>Matthew getting um just the beginning of<br>this month having our our lamb blessed<br>and I tell you what um I haven't felt<br>like blessing them when I'm getting up<br>at 6:00 in the morning to feed them I<br>feel like blessing them with no I won't<br>say<br>that so thank you very much um I'm I'm<br>very very glad to be here and thank you<br>all very much for coming along to my<br>talk uh ataga<br>university has two things that really<br>spoke to me one is it had the lifestyle<br>that I really desired when I moved from<br>Singapore and that was the thing that<br>really attracted me to this place was<br>the incredible lifestyle and the<br>incredible New Zealand people that I met<br>the second thing is I will say this<br>without any shyness at all this<br>University treats students like no other<br>university I've ever been associated<br>with the level of care given to<br>undergraduate and postgraduate students<br>at this particular University is<br>astounding and I am not shy at all to<br>say that because it's true and anyone<br>who works or teaches knows this to be<br>the truth so thank you very much and um<br>blessings to all of you<br>y thank you Bruce now I get to say a few<br>words so you can sit<br>down Oto ctoa and warm Pacific greetings<br>to you all<br>my name is Greg Cook and I'm the head of<br>Department of microbiology in Immunology<br>I thank you Bruce for your IPL tonight<br>um every time I hear you speak I I just<br>I've heard you speak a number of times<br>but I just get inspired your praise of<br>others is just remarkable you you<br>acknowledge everybody in the room uh you<br>are truly gifted if David atra even<br>needs a replacement I suggest that you<br>might have a role to play um so thank<br>you Bruce um perfectly<br>pitched so tonight we heard all about<br>Bruce's World leading research on<br>malaria sorry it took so long I think we<br>made you professor in 2020 and here we<br>are in 2023 but a few things got in the<br>way um evident in your talk tonight was<br>your your total passion and commitment<br>to basically studying malaria<br>development Diagnostics vaccine testing<br>in emic countries like<br>Malaysia um you know we should have huge<br>admiration for researchers like you<br>Bruce uh working at the cace of<br>infectious disease research very simple<br>Laboratories and you know I I'm not sure<br>I could sit in the jungle at night um<br>being bitten by mosquito and waiting for<br>a tiger to eat me so your considerable<br>bravery and I'm pretty sure Matthew you<br>probably weren't doing much on your<br>forth night because I think you know<br>Bruce really held our attention for the<br>whole 45 minutes um the panoramic scope<br>of your your work and recognition of<br>your achievements by the scientific<br>Community has been demonstrated by your<br>talk tonight um many outstanding<br>contributions to the field um I saw a<br>number of the papers coming up nature<br>science blood<br>pnas I mean you are very humble um you<br>know you are the person that has also<br>driven This research I admire you that<br>you pay you know respect to all these<br>other researchers which is fantastic but<br>you are also a major instigator of This<br>research and what's been really pleas<br>pleasing um as you said you know we we<br>were worried when you came here about<br>whether youd about to do malaria resarch<br>here but I think you've proven us all<br>wrong so congratulations<br>Bruce something that Bruce didn't talk<br>about um was that he has he was able to<br>Pivot his research to um other parasites<br>and and I think over the last few weeks<br>with the cryptos peridium outbreak and<br>in Queenstown Bruce is featured on the<br>TV and the radio and I think I think<br>this is a very exciting phase and and I<br>just wish the dvcr was here I wish the<br>vice Chancellor was here because I think<br>we need to support this research I mean<br>we can't let this research go under<br>because we can't get funding right once<br>we lose that capability to do this work<br>we'll never get it back so spoke to the<br>commissioner today the minister is going<br>to be contacting the university so<br>hopefully we can get some uh momentum<br>behind this and not only is Bruce a<br>world-class researcher as we saw tonight<br>he is an absolute tutive Force in our<br>teaching program and as you saw tonight<br>in any oration any talk any lecture I've<br>given passion excitement humor and<br>legendary Aussie storytelling right so<br>so thank you Bruce you you're amazing uh<br>my daughter did FAL signs and she said<br>you were the best lecturer by mile um<br>Bruce teaches at the peak of first year<br>health anxiety so he comes in right at<br>to death there where anxiety is through<br>the roof and I can tell you that Bruce<br>has a really calming influence on these<br>students you know these are 2,000<br>students they need a lot of pastal Care<br>and Bruce really is the calming<br>influence with that audience I think it<br>helps that you also tell them what is<br>going to be in the exam so um this is<br>probably this is probably something that<br>I need to do more<br>of yeah I know<br>so I want to thank your amazing family<br>um we saw tonight that noi in her own<br>right is a world-class research and and<br>Bruce thank you for acknowledging that<br>um so thank you Matthew and Mina for<br>sharing Bruce with us I mean I'm sure<br>some of those stories with the Tigers<br>must scare you when he's away um but<br>yeah an amazing researcher and and so<br>thank you Bruce so hopefully this<br>evening um was a fitting celebration to<br>you to recognize what an amazing<br>academic Bruce is um congratulations<br>Bruce and thanks for representing the<br>department and the university with such<br>distinction both on the local National<br>and international stage um I'm going to<br>miss you but I'm sure you'll come and<br>visit me in Queensland so thank you for<br>thank<br>good never been in such a dark elure<br>theater um Koto I'm Trish priest I'm the<br>acting Pro Vice Chancellor of Health<br>Sciences which is the part of the<br>university in which the biomedical<br>Sciences school and then the M the<br>department of microbiology and<br>Immunology sits I have a very short um<br>task you'll be pleased to know um but a<br>very pleasant one it's always one of the<br>great things about being in my role is<br>that I come to lots of these inaugural<br>professorial lectures and they're always<br>interesting they're not always as<br>dramatic as uh this one and um that was<br>really engaging and fantastic thank you<br>so much I've never been to any of your<br>student lectures but I can imagine um<br>that they're equally engaging um it's<br>always great to learn something more<br>about the work that people do here and<br>about the particular person who's um a<br>colleague leag in Health Sciences and so<br>this has been um a great one and uh not<br>at all not not um it's lived up to all<br>my hopes of going to a great IPL so<br>thank you so much Bruce and many many<br>congratulations my task is really just<br>to um ask you to when I finished give<br>Bruce one more round of applause and<br>then come and join him in the staff club<br>for refreshments and continue the<br>celebrations so once again thank you<br>Bruce congratulations and thank you all<br>for<br>coming</p></main><footer style="margin-top: 2rem; background: #0001; padding: 2rem; text-align: center;"><p>We Are The
