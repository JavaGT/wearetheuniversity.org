tanoto Tato<br>good evening my name is Ian McKinnon<br>Chancellor of Victoria University and<br>with Professor Pat Walsh and all at<br>Victoria University a very warm welcome<br>to this Chancellor's lecture and thank<br>you for<br>attending before introducing Sir Paul<br>Callahan let me first Express the thanks<br>of the university to the benefactors who<br>have made this evening possible and also<br>to the Wellington city council<br>particularly its events team I also<br>acknowledge the presence of her worship<br>the mayor Celia Wade brown other<br>counselors and the chief executive Gary<br>P and other offices of the<br>council the Deep green bunting about the<br>town hall is Victoria<br>University but that other bunting that<br>you see around here of wide ranging<br>colors indicates that this lecture is<br>taking place during the Rugby World Cup<br>the city council has been determined<br>that at this time<br>there should be a number of non-rugby<br>wellingtonians I'm wearing a Rugby World<br>Cup tie I might terminate this lecture<br>now um it's really what the city council<br>is determined to do is that there should<br>be these non-rugby activities so<br>wellingtonians and the many visitors to<br>our city can experience the variety that<br>this City offers and this Dimension to<br>that RWC is known as the Festival of<br>Carnival and encompasses around 145<br>exhibitions stage Productions Etc<br>throughout the city including this<br>lecture and the university wishes to<br>thank the city for making this town hall<br>available as its venue this<br>evening the vice Chancellor Professor<br>Pat Walsh and I also want to thank<br>Sheila Murray<br>the director of the development office<br>of the university and other staff of the<br>University including those in the events<br>office and Victoria University<br>Foundation for their contribution to<br>ensure the success of this<br>lecture Professor seul Callahan one of<br>New Zealand's most eminent scientists<br>and a world leading figure in the field<br>of magnetic resonance<br>Research In addition he is an<br>exceptional communicator in the area of<br>science as well as being a New Zealander<br>who is prepared to contribute to public<br>debate on a wide range of issues and<br>this evening a prosperous 21st century<br>New Zealand educating for the new tiger<br>economy following this<br>lecture if not already you will<br>appreciate why Professor Callahan is<br>held in such high regard and has been<br>the recipient of so many honors and<br>awards including that of Knighthood he<br>is a doctor of philosophy and a doctor<br>of science from the University of Oxford<br>a fellow of the Royal Society and a<br>fellow of the Royal Society of New<br>Zealand the Royal Society of New<br>Zealand's ruford medle in<br>2005 the Peter Blake medal for<br>leadership in 2007 the prime minister's<br>prize for science in<br>20110 the Kiwi Bank New Zealand of the<br>year in<br>2011 Plus various prestigous<br>International Awards including the<br>European Union Amper prize the first<br>non-european to win that award and the<br>gun Lon prize for ground baking work in<br>magnetic<br>residence he's also been the author of a<br>number of papers over 240 in fact and in<br>2009 wool to weter transforming New<br>Zealand's culture and economy this was<br>published outlining a vision of an<br>Economy based on science technology and<br>intellectual<br>property until recently he held the<br>position of inaugural director of the<br>McDon Institute for Advanced Materials<br>and<br>nanotechnology a cent a national Center<br>of research Excellence based at Victoria<br>University of Wellington he has also<br>been at the forfront of connecting<br>science and business founding magretech<br>limited a Wellington based company which<br>exports scientific instruments worldwide<br>for research in nuclear magnetic<br>resonance in Victoria University's<br>strategic plan a key strategy is that<br>the university must make a public<br>contribution a contribution to ensure a<br>better New Zealand<br>Society this lecture is further evidence<br>of that commitment bringing to the<br>public there are over 1,400 of you here<br>this evening without charge the ideas<br>and vision of a leading New<br>Zealander just as the University was<br>delighted to award Professor seul Kahan<br>an honory doctorate in December last<br>year we are now indeed honored that he<br>should be with us again this time to<br>deliver the<br>2011 Chancellor's lecture please welcome<br>Callahan<br>you<br>wellar I'm just astounded of this<br>turnout tonight I'm just delighted that<br>so many of you come have come along here<br>and I I just am trying to work out why<br>this might be and I think it it could be<br>something to do with a crazy title I<br>chose for this lecture of mine I mean<br>who could imagine the words prosperity<br>in New Zealand in the same sentence or<br>the idea of a tiger economy um this is<br>World Cup time we're all mad this is the<br>thing you see so I'm being a bit mad<br>myself tonight and of course we're all<br>crazily optimistic so you will find<br>there'll be moments of deep dark<br>pessimism during this talk but it's<br>going to finish on a wildly optimistic<br>note I hope so we're allowed to do this<br>because it's the mood of the country uh<br>I<br>of course have another theory it might<br>be because you've come along out of some<br>sort of a morbid curiosity what it's<br>like to hear a university Professor talk<br>about something they they know nothing<br>about um and so uh that's true I I'm I'm<br>used to saying things about topics I<br>know nothing about and I clearly know<br>nothing about economics so what can a<br>scientist say about that and uh I'll<br>have a go and you can form your own<br>judgment and but to start with I'd like<br>to say a little bit about scientists as<br>a breed and particularly cers and<br>perhaps a little an insight into the<br>thinking of cers so it'll help you<br>understand some of the strange things<br>I'm about to tell you of course we know<br>these famous scientists our two most<br>famous scientists erest Rutherford and<br>Alan McDon and they represent what I<br>call phase one of New Zealand science<br>you want to be a scientist get the hell<br>out of the place right go off and don't<br>come back because you cannot do<br>international science based here of<br>course it's not true there were people<br>doing science in New Zeal but to be part<br>of that International Community in those<br>days you you know when it was ship<br>travel you couldn't do it from here and<br>something happened to me in 1970 I saw<br>something remarkable I saw the first 747<br>aircraft was an Athens airport and it<br>just blew me away and I realized then<br>the world was going to change forever<br>for New Zealand that it would be<br>possible to travel from the Northern<br>Hemisphere to New Zealand in in 24 hours<br>and not take six weeks on a boat and so<br>some of us were crazy enough to come<br>back and try being scientists in New<br>Zealand and so this is what Phase 2 and<br>these are some wonderful New Zealand<br>sers the one in particular that I'd like<br>to draw your attention to is is the man<br>in the black and white picture on the<br>the bottom left a wonderful man called<br>Dan walls he was one of the most<br>brilliant physicists this country ever<br>produced he sadly died of cancer in 1999<br>and I thought well if Dan can do it I'll<br>have a go too and there are many of us<br>and I'll say some more about some of the<br>others there in a moment but these were<br>the kind this was the generation we all<br>got a bit of gray hair now but we<br>decided to come and try and be scientist<br>but do it from home<br>and we did the experiment and it worked<br>if you look at Publications coming out<br>of New Zealand if you measure the<br>scientific output of New Zealand per<br>capita we are one of the highest in the<br>oecd and here's a great thing we're<br>better than<br>Australia okay World Cup time we're<br>better than the United States in fact<br>we're better than heaps of places uh and<br>we actually improved a lot of over a<br>5year period or tenly 10 year period<br>from 1995 to 2006 and we improved more<br>the isans did so we actually do very<br>well we punch above our weight as we say<br>in scientific output but there in lies a<br>question which I'll come back to now let<br>me give you a bit of an insight about<br>the way scientists think we are strange<br>we're different than other people and<br>the way we look at the world Carl San<br>referred to the demon Haunted World the<br>idea of science as being a candle in the<br>dark this idea that somehow the reason<br>that science represents has dragged us<br>out of the pit of despair with<br>Superstition and so forth that the<br>Enlightenment is really driven by<br>science another view one that I like it<br>resonates with me is Lewis Walt's idea<br>that science is a means of overcoming<br>Common Sense most people say Common<br>Sense is a good thing but scientists<br>have no time for common sense whatsoever<br>we don't believe in it and if I say<br>things that sound absurd to you tonight<br>it's because I don't have any common<br>sense and scientists actually reject it<br>it's common sense that the Sun goes<br>around the earth I mean you go have a<br>look it does it every day right it's<br>Common Sense uh it's wrong that's the<br>problem and that's what science gives us<br>another way of<br>looking the way I like to look at it is<br>in terms of values because every Prof<br>work of life every profession if you<br>like has values associated with it these<br>are some of the values of science the<br>idea that we have an Evidence base for<br>decisions the idea that we don't have<br>peer review we say what do you think of<br>our word criticize me um we know that<br>nature is rational but it is certainly<br>not benign it is a not a nice cuddly<br>thing and you can you can know from what<br>happened in Christ that it can be<br>extraordinarily cruel we accept that in<br>science we know that about nature it's<br>not a sweet warm fuzzy thing at all we<br>are skeptical by Nature we're contrarian<br>and you'll see that in my some of my<br>opinions tonight what numbers mean is<br>terribly important what they don't mean<br>ideas and science are often complex and<br>we need to be able to express them<br>clearly uh and never fear knowledge<br>never fear knowledge it's always best to<br>know that's th those are some of the<br>ways that we look at the world you might<br>see some of those themes come through<br>tonight so I just like to take you<br>through the way in which science has<br>affected Humanity in terms of how we all<br>look at the world when Galileo made that<br>telescope and he looked up there and he<br>saw the phases of the moon he realized<br>what the circulatory motion of the<br>planetary system was that the Earth was<br>not at the center of the planetary<br>system uh he nearly came to grief with<br>the church over that uh he saw the moons<br>of Jupiter he realized that things were<br>not perfect simple spheres out there<br>there were other things going on that<br>Jupiter had these little irregular moons<br>that were going around it and so we<br>started to see the place of Earth in the<br>cosmos in a very different<br>way the the telescope when turned the<br>other way around became a microscope<br>when Robert Hook looked first under the<br>microscope he realized that the the<br>world of life that we as humans see<br>around us was only a very small fraction<br>of life that under the microscope you<br>could realize that a vast proportion of<br>life in fact the greatest proportion of<br>life is very strange and in most cases<br>unicellular whole new life was<br>discovered by looking down there and<br>Charles Darwin gave us a way of<br>understanding how life came about<br>through Evolution and natural selection<br>something that's very hard to come to<br>grips with as human beings because we<br>have this three score years and 10<br>approach to the world but of course<br>Evolution requires not thousands of<br>years not millions of years but<br>literally thousands of millions of years<br>and of course people didn't know how old<br>the Earth was and it was our own Ernest<br>ruford who if you look at the $100<br>banket if you ever get one tourists have<br>them but I never have them in my pocket<br>but you know there's a gold medal on<br>there that his Nobel Prize and there's a<br>a graph on there that's the law of<br>radioactive decay that he discovered<br>which for which he got the Nobel Prize<br>and he looked at the isotopic content of<br>the Earth's surface knowing their rate<br>of Decay and he worked out how old<br>planet Earth was and he came up to the<br>astounding result that it was thousands<br>of millions of years old and we know<br>that the planetary system that we live<br>in is 4.6 billion years old every<br>technique comes up with the same answer<br>and of course that's the connection back<br>with why life was able to evolve here at<br>such a period and then when Rosen<br>Franklin took this remarkable photograph<br>and uh in my view that photograph of the<br>top middle is the most important<br>photograph of the 20th century it's the<br>X-ray defraction photograph of DNA from<br>which Crick and Watson and Franklin and<br>um wilcoms another New Zealander were<br>able to work out the structure of DNA<br>the molecule of Life the thing that<br>drives all of life and that those genes<br>that are expressed in the DNA control<br>life through their devices which are the<br>proteins that they make and the protein<br>structure discovered first by Dorothy<br>hodkin has given us this Insight so we<br>see the molecular basis of life and all<br>of Darwin's ideas suddenly become clear<br>as to how this works and it's an<br>extraordinar beautiful story<br>and here's another great New Zealander<br>Alan<br>Wilson uh he was a professor at the<br>University of California Berkeley and he<br>realized there was another there were<br>two types of DNA in our body there's the<br>DNA of our the cell nuclei that we get<br>half from our father and half from our<br>mother but there's another DNA in the<br>mitochondria the little energy sources<br>in our cells an ancient bacteria that<br>incorporated themselves into eukaryotic<br>systems and that comes only from our<br>mother because sperm don't have mitoch<br>Condy but ovam do and only from our<br>grandmothers and only from our great<br>grandmothers and so they don't change<br>they only change through mutations so if<br>you look at two human beings on the<br>planet and look at any differences<br>through their DN the DNA and their<br>mitochondria it can only have come about<br>through the time that took place from<br>The Junction point of their common<br>Heritage and we look at all of humanity<br>we find we go back to a common female<br>ancestor probably about 150 million<br>150,000 years ago and uh that all of<br>humanity is connected we know where<br>Polynesians came from we know uh from<br>mitochondri da the connectedness of the<br>human race we are all one family we are<br>very very closely related It's a<br>Wonderful story that's what science<br>tells us and the modern version of<br>Galilea is to look out there with a<br>Hubble Telescope here we see in the<br>Eagle Nebula 7,000 light years from<br>Earth it took 7,000 years for that light<br>to get here great clouds of hydrogen<br>where stars are being formed we can see<br>the birth of stars and in this picture<br>here which is the most extraordinary<br>picture picture of the hble telescope<br>you'll see galaxies so distant it's<br>unimaginable and you see a little square<br>there in that picture and it's blown up<br>and it's blown up again and that object<br>is the most distant object that we have<br>ever seen the light from that object<br>took<br>32,000 million years to get to us on<br>Earth we are looking at something that<br>existed uh sorry 13.2 billion years ago<br>the age of the universe is only 13.6<br>billion years we can look right back to<br>the origin near the big bang with that<br>this is where science has taken us it<br>changes the way we think and these are<br>some of the things I spoke with Kim Hill<br>about on radio and we produced this book<br>together and um I'm not trying to<br>advertise the book but I'm just telling<br>you that it's an interest of mine to<br>that scientists get carried up in these<br>big picture questions and they they're<br>just wonderful and they're very exciting<br>but that's not what I've come here to<br>talk to you about tonight I want to talk<br>to you about phase three of New Zealand<br>science because I've told you the<br>cultural value of science but somebody<br>pays for science the tech taxpayer pays<br>for S science mostly in New Zealand and<br>so we have to ask the question what<br>impact does it make in our country how<br>can we as scientist contribute and of<br>course Peter Gman who you will all know<br>well as the prime minister's Chief<br>Scientific Advisor has an amazing impact<br>since he's had that role bringing<br>science to the attention of government<br>and he's done a fantastic job um just<br>I'll just mention a couple of others<br>Margaret brimble who is's a wonderful<br>organic chemist developing new um<br>synthetic roots to drugs new antibiotics<br>potentially uh could that could have<br>great value for New Zealand in the<br>future and Peter Hunter up on the top<br>left there who runs this extraordinary<br>Institute the phys own project and and<br>he's got 150 scientists working and<br>that's funded almost entirely for money<br>coming from outside New Zealand<br>investing in that science we're not<br>paying for it the rest of the world is<br>because it's so good and that<br>organization spun out many companies<br>that are employing scientists this is<br>where science is going in New Zealand<br>the contribution of course we know that<br>science has been important important to<br>New Zealand as a society in the economy<br>because we look at our Agriculture and<br>I've got a list there of things breeding<br>uh fertilizers top dressing uh the<br>electric fence all these things came out<br>of the engineering and science knowledge<br>of new zealanders that gave us an edge<br>over the rest of the world and have made<br>agriculture so successful the breeding<br>particularly uh people like Francis dry<br>and Jeffrey pin who have breeds of sheep<br>named after them I'm a physicist I don't<br>contribute to agriculture<br>but I want to ask the same question of<br>myself what can I do what can people who<br>work in these areas do to contribute to<br>New Zealand's economy and one of the<br>reasons I'm talking to you tonight about<br>this topic is that I got involved almost<br>accidentally because with some wonderful<br>colleagues and friends of mine we set up<br>a company um and again I'm not trying to<br>sell you anything because we don't sell<br>anything to new zealanders we only sell<br>abroad because we're an export company<br>selling high-tech products to the world<br>that's what magri does and it's the<br>start of something new and very exciting<br>in this country and it's employing<br>brilliant Young scientists and when I<br>see them doing that I get excited and I<br>see other people wanting to come from<br>the rest of the world to work in that<br>organization I think wow this is great<br>but you know I go to Cambridge<br>University I go to uh New York<br>University whatever what do I find<br>everywhere in the world I find Brilliant<br>new zealanders working in science<br>elsewhere and they don't know that it's<br>possible to do great things back home<br>and that's part of the story I want to<br>tell and so that's why I wrote Walter<br>Witter I got involved in how does how<br>does new Ze economy developed using<br>knowledge what are we all heard about<br>and it's wonderful software it's<br>wonderful Creative Design it's connected<br>with the Jackson movie industry so<br>important for the city and um I have a<br>particular regard for that company which<br>I'll I'll again refer to later so this<br>is the story I want to tell you and it's<br>a story we all know as new zealanders<br>it's the story of my lifetime uh and if<br>you're old enough you will know that New<br>Zealand was once more prosperous than<br>Australia it's absurd to say it isn't it<br>but we kind of felt sorry for for<br>Australians when I was a kid their per<br>capita GDP was less than the Australian<br>dollar was rubbish it was way less value<br>than New Zealand dollar and um more<br>Australians migrated to New Zealand than<br>vice versa now a great Gap has opened up<br>and you see that somehow there's a<br>relative decline now this is GDP per<br>capita gross domestic product per capita<br>it's a measure of prosperity and I'll<br>try to justify that idea of measuring<br>prosperity and wellbeing in a moment<br>you'll bear with me uh that's based on<br>an average of 100 the oecd the<br>organization of economic cooperation and<br>development and here we are from 1970 to<br>2010 you see the Gap there which is very<br>big now and the government has set a<br>goal to try to match Australia's per<br>capita GDP and I admire that I think<br>that's a worthy goal we have to know why<br>we want to grow Prosperity we have to<br>have a reason to want to do it and we<br>have to have a mechanism for doing it<br>and that's where we're all a little bit<br>puzzled and scratching our heads and so<br>I've been reading books on economics and<br>I've had some help from Economist<br>friends of mine as Paul you need to go<br>read Adam Smith The Wealth of Nations So<br>Adam Smith understood why the world<br>became prosperous once when we were<br>hunter gatherers we were all generalists<br>we all had to know how to hunt how to<br>gather the berries how to light to Fire<br>and do that but suddenly something<br>happened with industrialization where<br>people started to specialize and so one<br>person would do one task and other<br>people would do other tasks and that<br>created enormous efficiency gains and it<br>grew wealth in countries and the way<br>that that worked to allow that<br>specialization required<br>markets and markets are based on the<br>idea of trading and you can only do that<br>if you have property rights and you can<br>only do that if you have legal<br>Frameworks that protect those property<br>rights there has to be work ethic around<br>that I think we've always had that as<br>human beings and a lack of corruption to<br>make it work effectively and that's<br>fundamentally the necessary condition<br>for Prosperity if you don't have that<br>you can't be and that's why some of the<br>world it's just rich in resources and<br>much about Africa is like this doesn't<br>seem to manage that and countries like<br>Switzerland or Japan who have no<br>resources at all are incredibly wealthy<br>because that's the foundation and here<br>we excel in this in New Zealand and I I<br>want to talk about this because we had a<br>commission that was set up to look at<br>how we could grow Prosperity What's<br>called the 2025 task force it was headed<br>by a very clever man Dr Don Brash and<br>Don has presented this argument and he<br>here just a week ago he said I believe<br>the singest single biggest hurdle fac<br>economic future is creeping erosion of<br>property rights so he says we're not<br>doing enough Adam Smith we haven't got<br>it right and I just want to look at this<br>from an evidencebased you see there<br>outputs that measure property rights and<br>this one's called The Americans for tax<br>reform Foundation property rights<br>Alliance sounds pretty respectable<br>doesn't it you know that we are seventh<br>in the world in property rights we are<br>ahead of Australia wow we're ahead of<br>the United States we have fabulous<br>property rights we're apparently not as<br>good as the Netherlands but you know<br>we're up there with the top countries so<br>we seem to have property rights already<br>so what about what's our political and<br>legal rights like number two in the<br>world apparently number two in the world<br>are legal and political<br>rights well what about corruption we're<br>number one that's to say we are the<br>least corrupt country in the world and<br>we come out in that every single year<br>the least corrupt country I'm only<br>telling you things you already know<br>about New Zealand we're not corrupt<br>people are but that's what we are you<br>know Adam Smith would be celebrating us<br>now wouldn't he be think we're pretty<br>good um well maybe we're over taxed you<br>hear that don't you you've heard that<br>we're over<br>taxed well let me tell you something we<br>have the third lowest tax rate in the<br>whole oecd the third lowest there's our<br>green is income tax and the purple is<br>company Tax and by the way next month<br>company Tax drops to there again we're<br>lower than Australia um we we're lower<br>than the United States but long way we<br>have one of the lowest taxation rates<br>that is around of I'm not talking about<br>countries that are dirt poor I'm talking<br>about the oecd countries you yeah how do<br>you measure taxes you know because some<br>people pay health insurance okay let's<br>let's do it whatever way you like the<br>difference between what the employer<br>pays you and what you get in your pocket<br>we are third to lowest the Mexico and<br>Chile are only the Le least we don't<br>have all these clever things we just pay<br>tax we don't pay national health<br>insurance or whatever you know as part<br>of our tax a we a very simple way so you<br>know we have very low tax so when I hear<br>this stuff from 2025 who just say you<br>got to cut taxes you need better<br>property rights I'm saying I'm sorry we<br>already did it and that's obviously not<br>what it's about that is what's known as<br>the New Zealand Paradox it's called<br>people in the rest of the world refer to<br>New Zealand as the newal The Economist<br>as it is in Paradox we have fantastic<br>Adam Smith credentials but somehow other<br>our economic performance has been poor<br>and I want to come back to that because<br>it actually isn't quite as poor as you<br>might imagine and I want to show you<br>that but here's the point there's<br>something else in here and there are<br>other economists who say yes that's a<br>necessary condition for Prosperity but<br>it's not sufficient you've got to do<br>something else in the modern world you<br>have to innovate here's a book The play<br>on The Wealth of Nations by David Landis<br>the wealth and poverty of Nations and<br>Landis tells the story about Nathan<br>Rothchild Nathan Rothchild when this<br>portrait was painted in 1821 was the<br>richest man in the world and in 1836 he<br>died because he got a scratch and it got<br>infected and he died of<br>sepia the richest man in the world died<br>of septicemia nobody in the world today<br>no matter how poor should die of that if<br>they can get an antibiotic they can get<br>to a doctor or a hospital even in the<br>most desperately poor countries if you<br>can get an antibiotic so there's a sense<br>in which the richest man alive in 1821<br>is poorer than some of the poorest who<br>are alive today in other words we have<br>really gained all of us on the planet<br>apart from those in Desperate situations<br>in Somalia or somewhere like like that<br>at the moment uh even in their present<br>situation we live better in many ways<br>than people who were very riched earlier<br>on and so that's what Innovation does<br>that's what knowledge does it changes<br>the way we live so I want to come back<br>to this graph now and instead of<br>plotting it in terms of who how we<br>compare with the oecd I want to plot it<br>in absolute terms let's go right back to<br>New Zealand's history now of there's a<br>lot of graphs there and I I'm going to<br>unravel them for you but let me just<br>note there's a few countries here and I<br>want to show you this one this is Japan<br>what happened there oh dear there was a<br>war wars are very bad for Prosperity we<br>all know that right but look what<br>happened after the war now this is a log<br>graph it means that on a graph like that<br>a fixed growth rate would be a straight<br>line and you see suddenly the growth<br>Rage of man dramatically increased until<br>it got up to the rest of the world and<br>it kind of slowed down if you're behind<br>it's easy to grow look the Netherlands<br>got knocked around in the war they grew<br>very back very rapidly as well that's<br>the first point I want to M here's a<br>graph that shows growth rates of<br>economies over the period from 1950 to<br>1980 depending on GDP per capita in 1950<br>so the lower your GDP per capita just<br>after the war the faster you grew look<br>at that graph it's amazing the Richer<br>you were the slower you grew if you're<br>behind it's easy to get ahead great<br>first optimistic thing we're behind we<br>can get ahead all right got me okay so<br>now let's strip away some of those<br>things let's look at a few countries<br>here's New Zealand let's look at us we<br>start farming wow we're doing really<br>well we got Britain as a market you know<br>we're really prosperous with other<br>countries there's our growth rate<br>doesn't really change doesn't really<br>change the rest of the world starts to<br>increase but we don't until something<br>happens here and you can see from there<br>on we've grown at the same rate as the<br>rest of the world okay Australia's done<br>a little better but by and large it's<br>just that we did something too late and<br>we're growing again we're growing like<br>the rest of the world but we've got a<br>gap that's opened up and we need to<br>close it so so what happened and I'm<br>going to be controversial I'm going to<br>go out on a line on a limb here and say<br>what I think happened was it Britain<br>going to the common market that caused<br>our problem no we were in Decline before<br>that it just made it didn't help maybe<br>even turned it down slightly but it<br>wasn't some dramatic thing we were in<br>Decline for a long long time because we<br>weren't innovating we had a very<br>protected economy I know people say rude<br>things about the reforms that happened<br>in 1984 to 1990 but I believe they<br>transformed New Zealand into a market<br>economy they got one of the Adam Smith<br>fundamentals right it took some time it<br>was damn painful but after a little<br>while we started to pick up and off we<br>went and there we going we have had a<br>very fine basis for growth that is my<br>reading as a scientist not big an expert<br>on economics and I don't want to be<br>political about this but I do believe we<br>got to benefit from it so let me tell<br>you a little bit about my summary of New<br>Zealand and then we'll get into some the<br>problems and how we can deal with them<br>this is from Time Magazine you a't<br>better read that thing just to prove<br>that I got it Out of Time Magazine so<br>you get some evidence but here's some<br>things look income inequality we're 26<br>out of 33 that's of the bad we've got<br>very high income inequality um we know<br>about child poverty in this country<br>we've had a gap opened up between the<br>rich and the poor which is one of the<br>biggest gaps in the oecd that's<br>something that's very surprising to many<br>new zealanders uh you see that reflected<br>in many negative social indicators<br>whether it's obesity or child mortality<br>teenage pregnancy or imprisonment rates<br>here we are imprisonment we got one of<br>the highest incarceration rates in the<br>oecd very high level of incarceration<br>near the bottom in terms of that<br>negative indicator but there are some<br>good things as well our level of<br>democracy is very high on this measure<br>we got number two I think on the other<br>one I showed you but we know that's good<br>and here's a fascinating thing in maths<br>and Science and in Reading we are really<br>really good our kids are well educated<br>and I'll come back to that point because<br>it's a very important one for us but I<br>believe what holds us back is not our<br>incapacity uh through some fundamental<br>problem we've got everything all the<br>fundamentals are there we've got a great<br>education system it's simply in my view<br>because we're not thinking to do the<br>right things and that's the argument I<br>want to put to you tonight and part of<br>it is that we wallow in a mythology that<br>makes us feel good about ourselves but<br>much of which is fundamentally untrue<br>and some of the things I'm going to tell<br>you will offend in fact I will be<br>disappointed if people are not offended<br>by some of the things I say but at<br>different times I'll probably offend<br>different people so Y and it means in<br>the end I'll have offended you all but I<br>don't mind and I'm going to have a go<br>you see here's the first one clean and<br>green well you know the rest of the<br>world doesn't buy it we can tell<br>ourselves there but you can read what<br>the rest of the world says and they<br>don't believe it and some of you may<br>have seen John ke interviewed on by the<br>BBC on hard talk and it was you know it<br>was I felt sorry for him you know they<br>were showing them our Rivers were dirty<br>than German rivers and things like that<br>we have a problem and we need to face up<br>to it we have a serious problem our<br>daring which is a fabulous industry<br>which I adore and which I will explain<br>as being important so important to New<br>Zealand we've got to protect it and look<br>after it has a huge impact on our Rivers<br>our environmental index indices have<br>been dropping in the last few years so<br>the rest of the world's noticing that<br>we're performing more poorly we have a<br>real problem with water quality and this<br>has been pointed out to us we have in<br>this country a capacity for what I call<br>egregious hypocrisy I think we do<br>hypocrisy almost better than anyone and<br>I want to tell you why for all our<br>environmental problems we just love<br>telling the rest of the world what<br>terrible people they are we tell<br>Indonesians they shouldn't chop down<br>their rainforest and we shouldn't lay<br>our products in that got anything to do<br>with palm oil because you know it's<br>awful what they do their rainforest so<br>they're planting these palm trees and<br>rangang is having a rough time and you<br>know we shouldn't do it excuse me excuse<br>me what did we do we turned 2/3 of our<br>native Forest into greenhouse gas and we<br>put Farm we didn't put palm oil trees we<br>put grass and on the grass we put Rin<br>and animals to pump more greenhouse gas<br>out you know and we wiped out hundreds<br>of species of birds and and uh and and<br>other little creatures and we lecture<br>the rest of the world about what they<br>should do should we not have done<br>this how else would we have had any<br>Prosperity at all had we not developed<br>farming of course we had no choice and<br>poor countries do have no choice but to<br>use their resources and when we are<br>relatively rich as we are it is almost<br>obscene for us to talk to a poor compan<br>and say you should not burn your coal<br>you should not cut down your trees<br>because they look at us and they say<br>bloody Hypocrites and that's what we are<br>we need to grow up about this of course<br>there is a moral position to be taken<br>here if we don't like that they cut down<br>their trees we know what to do<br>buy the forest at Market values put a<br>covenant on and donate them back as<br>national parks that would be a decent<br>honorable thing to do but not to say we<br>discriminate against your products<br>because you're doing what we did 100<br>years ago that's outrageous that's my<br>view second our journalists look I I<br>apologize those who' have heard this<br>joke before but I'm hoping some of you<br>haven't heard this I love telling this<br>joke it's all about this boat it's<br>called the 80 girl and had a little<br>accident with a whaling boat in the<br>South Pacific Southern Ocean I should<br>say say last year know about it we all<br>got very sentimental about it poor old<br>Pete theun and all that stuff and it<br>used to be known as the Earth race ecobo<br>wonderful thing an ecob booat you see<br>and here's a lovely story written The<br>Herald every little drop helps the<br>planet well I I was astounded when I<br>read that because I'm a physicist and<br>physicist and Engineers have all heard<br>of Eco but it's really famous to us<br>because most of us have read a book by<br>this very well-known Cambridge Professor<br>you won't going to read that graph but<br>it's called sustainable energy without<br>the hot air and it's all about vehicles<br>and you see on this graph here is how<br>much fuel is needed per passenger<br>kilometer of a vehicle and here's how<br>fast the vehicle goes so bicycles are<br>just the best CIA is here tonight she'll<br>agree with me bicycles are great very<br>little fuel but they're not so fast but<br>if you fill electric trains with people<br>not in Oakland hopefully but um that's<br>even better right now our trains run<br>well so there we have that's even better<br>cuz it's very also efficient but it's<br>much faster then we come to really bad<br>things like buses is not so good uh<br>boing 747s are not good cars are not<br>good ocean liners are bad there's jet<br>skis don't we hate jet skis aren't they<br>the worst no sorry I've got one worse<br>for you you got it it's the Earth race<br>ecobo it is the greatest gas gazler ever<br>made ever designed by humanity and when<br>the Shon and Maru chopped its bar off<br>and sent it to DAV Jes Jones Locker it<br>did a magnificent service the world<br>environmental movement Now isn't that a<br>fabulous story didn't you love that<br>story and what journalists have written<br>that story our journalists just run over<br>every little drop go upes the planet<br>blah blah blah you know this we just<br>tell ourselves this crap don't we we<br>love it but um I'm sorry I'm a scientist<br>I'm mean and picky and I you know but<br>it's fun too isn't it anyway I want to<br>show you something else I know I'm going<br>to offend wellingtonians here this is a<br>picture of me this is an x-ray CT with<br>positron emission tomography in it and<br>what you do is you feed into the blood<br>vein radioactively labeled glucose fluin<br>18 labeled glucose and the if you got<br>cancer cells they love glucose because<br>they really got a high metabolic rate so<br>does your tongue and your brain and so<br>forth but you can recognize the tongue<br>and the Brain but if you get a nice<br>glowing Spot somewhere where you haven't<br>got a tongue or a brain or a kidney you<br>know you got a tumor and that's my tumor<br>right there big one big one wow that's<br>not very good is it well that's me<br>that's the way it was I'm very GL glad<br>to have found it I found a lot of other<br>tumors as well um Now where's that<br>radioactive material made just over by<br>the airport folks did you know about<br>that you won't find a sign they're not<br>advertising it there's a 16 million<br>electron volt accelerator there it by<br>nuclear reactions it creates this<br>radioactive material and it sends it<br>around the hospitals of New Zealand that<br>need that and just a little distance<br>away a few hundred meters is this sign<br>freeuse don't we do the crap don't we do<br>the crap well in this country eh oh but<br>look you know but it's okay look it's<br>for medical use it's all right and<br>anyway it's got only got a half life of<br>what 100 minutes so that's not so bad<br>wait a minute anyone got one of those in<br>their house I hope so it's got amorium<br>241 in there the half life of that<br>radioactive isotope is 432 years and<br>it's made from<br>plutonium in nuclear reactors in the<br>Northern Hemisphere or we're<br>anti-nuclear but we'll just we're happy<br>to have your stuff made in your reactors<br>ship it here we won't say anything about<br>it will detect smoke and will save lives<br>with it you see it's hypocrisy isn't it<br>and and our objection to this is really<br>spiritual one and I don't mind that but<br>let's be honest about it you see um<br>here's an example and if I haven't<br>offended any of you yet I'm I'm going to<br>get the last of you now there there is<br>no evidence that genetically modified<br>organisms or food have any problem<br>whatsoever there is no scientific<br>evidence you can find no we have a<br>spiritual objection to it we don't like<br>G because it's spiritually no problem<br>with that at all I don't I'm not<br>anti-religion I'm not at all however if<br>the Australian have a spiritual<br>objection to our apples which apparently<br>they do we go running off the World<br>Trade Organization the science the<br>science there's no scientific evidence<br>whatsoever there's any problem with Fi<br>light at all so we play the game when it<br>suits us but when it doesn't we do the<br>spiritual thing I don't mind just get<br>consistent will you please that's what<br>I'm saying this is adolescent Behavior<br>kids can do that but adults can't and I<br>think that's part of the problem because<br>until we're honest about ourselves how<br>can we Face up to child poverty how can<br>we Face up to the issues that are really<br>important in this country until we start<br>to be honest and that's all I'm asking<br>and um that's really part of the but a<br>little happy story that was me four<br>months later after a course four cycles<br>of a vas Arena capid of be didn't get<br>rid of a cancer but you know got bit<br>smaller and there in lies something very<br>interesting because this was a key drug<br>this is a monoclonal antibody very very<br>sophisticated you can't get that in the<br>health system in New Zealand why you can<br>get it in Australia free Canada free New<br>Zealand sorry we can't afford it I paid<br>$28,000 for that wasn't I lucky don't<br>want to be poor if you got cancer in New<br>Zealand does prosperity matter I make no<br>apology whatever for saying that in my<br>view and I feel passionate about that<br>Prosperity matters to new zealanders it<br>matters in our health system we can't do<br>the things we want to do we can't get<br>the child Cancer Specialists in<br>Wellington because we can't pay the<br>salaries we need for Consultants we<br>can't have the drugs we want and if You'<br>got someone in your family youve got a<br>child in your family you're suffering<br>from cancer let me tell you you care<br>about prosperity and I'm proud of our<br>houses it's wonderful and I know how<br>stretched they are and I applaud them um<br>but they need more resources we've got a<br>very limited infrastructure poor old<br>orlanders can't even make their trains<br>run properly oh did I say that before<br>sorry um anyway we got problems haven't<br>we you know we it's shameful we kind of<br>get embarrassed we just haven't SP us<br>look at we had to do a Welling way years<br>and years and years and we're still<br>trying to sort this problem out it's<br>embarrassing you go you anyone who<br>travels I've just been to Beijing oh my<br>goodness want to go to travel of<br>underground Railway there don't I'm not<br>saying we want to live like the Chinese<br>but boy it runs beautifully it's it's<br>gorgeous Hightech and so for Prosperity<br>that is and here's the thing that has<br>really driven it home to us the Christ<br>Church is a game changer for New Zealand<br>the effect of Christ Church is traumatic<br>for us the loss of life was just<br>terrible and the grief that those<br>families feel is really something but<br>the effect on our economy which affects<br>all of us in New Zealand is dramatic it<br>is two or maybe three times the effect<br>on our economy that Japan's Cai<br>earthquake and tsunami is on their we<br>are going to be paying for this for a<br>generation there are great opportunities<br>around what we will do with Christ<br>Church but boy Prosperity matters we're<br>going to need all the wherewith all we<br>can to rebuild that that's important to<br>us now there will still be some of you<br>who<br>say isn't happiness more important than<br>Prosperity it is and if you get more<br>prosperous don't you just damage the<br>environment more actually no here's some<br>evidence there's a lot of studies been<br>done on different measures in the world<br>if you're really poor you don't do much<br>to your environment you live in Balance<br>if you're a hunter gatherer and there's<br>a few of you it's okay as you start to<br>grow and industrialize you do New<br>Zealand pillaged its environment uh when<br>it was is very poor in order to get<br>Farming going but once you start to go<br>on the other side of the curve the more<br>prosperous you get the more you can<br>protect environment and zelandia this<br>wonderful facility we have in Wellington<br>which is a biodiversity protection<br>project costs money and we can't do that<br>unless we we have a Prosperity here's<br>what we could do if we were Rich we<br>could get rid of every damn posum and<br>muscle in the whole of New Zealand we<br>could do it it's been costed for Steward<br>Island would cost $50 million it is<br>possible to get rid of all the posss in<br>New Zealand if we had the<br>wherewithal that's what Prosperity makes<br>possible you don't have to have<br>goldplated TS you can do good things and<br>you can protect your environment so I<br>feel passionately that growing<br>Prosperity if you're wise enables you to<br>do good things to the environment and<br>here's another thing doesn't it create<br>more income disparity to get richer<br>strangely the evidence suggests<br>otherwise that's data each dot there's a<br>country in the world and as you grow<br>Capital GDP there's kind of an inverted<br>U and as you get more and more<br>prosperous you get to the Switzerland's<br>and the the swedens compared with say uh<br>the China China and the mexicos so if<br>you're in the sort of middle area you're<br>not so well off you have big income<br>disparities but as you get more<br>prosperous and you're wise you don't you<br>may be like the United States where<br>they're rich but have a very big income<br>disparity but you can be wise and you<br>can reach that Gap and you can do more<br>and that's again I don't think that<br>income disparity is something that<br>follows Prosperity so let me come to the<br>third problem with well look I know that<br>we have problems but at least this is a<br>nice country to live because we don't<br>have to too hard and we can all go off<br>to the beach and it's a jolly nice<br>lifestyle well let me tell you something<br>surprising you won't be able to see new<br>it on that graph you got to guess where<br>it is and I'll show you in a minute here<br>is how hard people work how many hours<br>work per capita 100 is the oecd average<br>and this is how much is made per hour<br>how much where your productivity<br>is you see the French don't work at all<br>it's is not true it says 70% only work<br>70% but I the Le look at their<br>productivity it's fabulous isn't it<br>great better than the United States now<br>this is a 2005 data and things have<br>changed a little bit uh in the I've seen<br>the 2008 data I haven't updated the<br>slide but what's happened to New Zealand<br>hasn't changed at all that's us well at<br>least we're not the hardest working<br>country in the O at least the icelanders<br>work harder than us I have no idea what<br>they do in Iceland but they do work<br>harder than us so the fact the idea that<br>we have a nice easy lifestyle forget it<br>in fact we all know why New Zealand do<br>get jobs and they go overseas cuz people<br>know they're well educated and they<br>bloody hardworking they are we are<br>hardworking but look at our productivity<br>Greece has passed us by you know what's<br>happened in the last few years New<br>Zealand's moved even further back we are<br>now I I I am lying I'm misleading<br>because there's two oecd countries I<br>failed to put on the graph there are two<br>countries with productivity lower than<br>New Zealand turkey and<br>Mexico isn't that<br>great well so that's our problem we have<br>low productivity and I believe that is a<br>personal belief of mine that that is a<br>choice we have made we are poor because<br>we choose to be poor now I do not mean<br>that in an offensive way to say that any<br>individual is poor it's the they're the<br>architect of their own Misfortune I mean<br>we as a nation me you all of us have<br>chosen to work in low income activities<br>generally speaking we don't have to do<br>that and I'll explain what I mean by<br>that in a moment but that's the B<br>problem it's productivity and that's<br>what we've got to get up so let me come<br>back to graph here and let's see how big<br>that Gap is cuz I want to put a number<br>on there the gap between us and<br>Australia I saying we have to be like<br>the Australians but if we take that as a<br>goal that would you know if we were as<br>well off as Australia we'd be pretty<br>well off we could definitely kill all<br>the possums and muss $40<br>billion us about 45 billion New Zealand<br>I'll say roughly let's say $40 billion a<br>year that's how much more we have to<br>earn and ideally through exports so just<br>remember that figure 40 billion okay now<br>you know I know the answer to that<br>people positively Wellington tourism<br>will tell you the answer to that we just<br>need more tourists and we got it well<br>let me tell you how much tourism earns<br>per year it's about 8 billion dollars a<br>year so we need about five times as many<br>tourists that would be great um be good<br>to have five times many tourists<br>Wellington we got that with the Rugby<br>World Cup but you know if you do the<br>Congo Crossing instead of having 600<br>people do it a day which is the current<br>rate on a good day you'd have 3,000 that<br>would be good or if for South iseland is<br>here instead of having 10,000 people<br>visit Milford Sound every week you have<br>50,000 right great we got it solved so<br>that's the answer we can all go home now<br>or pack<br>up there's something I want to tell<br>you our per capita GDP in New Zealand is<br>about $401,000 a year and how many jobs<br>are there in New Zealand full-time<br>equivalent jobs there's 1.3 million jobs<br>in New Zealand full-time equivalent so<br>if you do the sums it means that the<br>amount you need to earn per job to have<br>our current per capita GDP is 120,000<br>don't get excited that's not the<br>employees get paid that's what the<br>business has got to earn per job what<br>does tourism<br>earn 80,000 a<br>job what does that mean the more you<br>expand tourism the poorer you get now<br>this is obviously what I'm telling you<br>is obviously insane there's something<br>not right here is that I mean what<br>surely tourism is good it's great and<br>the reason it's great is it employs<br>unskilled people and that's why every<br>every country in the world benefits from<br>tourism it's basically bus driving bed<br>making now that's not in a derogatory<br>statement that's a worthwhile thing and<br>it's a wonderful thing to work in the<br>tourist business but you don't need a<br>University degree frankly and you don't<br>need to be a expert welder or something<br>like that or know how to do it you know<br>electronic pred circuit boards so it's a<br>low wage activity wine is $90,000 a job<br>again by expanding the wine industry we<br>cannot grow Prosperity the reason we<br>have tourism is that it provides<br>employment and IT projects us to the<br>world it it shows the rest of the world<br>who we are and it's part of our values<br>and we do it very well and and it's<br>important in New Zealand and the wine<br>industry tells the world how sophistic<br>headed we are and it gives us a<br>wonderful quality of life and I'm<br>immensely proud of our wines as I'm sure<br>you all are too but let's understand why<br>they're good for us it's not because<br>more wine makes us more prosperous it<br>makes us less prosperous so how do we<br>have any Prosperity at all food<br>manufacturing which is bigger new Ze<br>comes in just on the<br>average the rest of manufacturing is<br>quite a bit High but there is one<br>business in New Zealand that's<br>dramatically productive and it's called<br>the dairy industry and the dairy<br>industry brings in about $350,000 a job<br>now by the way these are my figures but<br>I had fellow Riley at business New<br>Zealand get his Economist to check them<br>over they basically agree um there's the<br>amount of employment there so I've<br>represented a total contribution to the<br>economy by the area so really we should<br>jump drop to our knees every morning and<br>you know praise the almighty for the<br>existence of fona because without deir<br>New Zealand would be desperately poor<br>and so we come to another solution which<br>is to grow Dairy and dairy brings it<br>about 10 billion a year so we need four<br>times as many cows and immediately<br>you're thinking wait a minute four times<br>as many cows what the heck are we going<br>to do where we going to put them and<br>what's it going to do to our rivers and<br>you would be right because we have<br>reached the limits for dairy we can't<br>take anymore our our our water quality<br>and our water sources are under stress<br>we can't grow that and so suddenly we've<br>become a country not like we've been for<br>150 years we become a country like<br>Singapore or Japan or Switzerland<br>without resources where we have to if we<br>to grow Prosperity start to do things<br>with our brains because we can't keep on<br>pillaging the resources we can't keep on<br>taking stuff out of the land because if<br>we do we'll destroy what we value in New<br>Zealand so I've made some fun about<br>environmentalism but I want to assert a<br>very strong green environmental theme<br>here which will come through in a moment<br>but there is another company I want to<br>draw your attention to it's only small<br>it's only 500 million a year not 10<br>billion a year but there's a few of<br>those companies and look at its<br>productivity it's almost up there with<br>fontia and there's no limit to the<br>number of companies like that we can<br>have very important<br>idea we think $350,000 a job's great<br>here's a table of jobs I don't expect<br>you to read it but that's in US Dollars<br>Apple computer 1.3 million us a job<br>Google $1 million a job Samsung $1<br>million us a job that's what goes on in<br>the world out there we don't have any<br>businesses like that in New Zealand<br>there is a level of productivity that<br>exists in the world in things like the<br>pharmaceutical industry and high-tech<br>manufactur on a large scale which<br>produce spectacular productivity and<br>here we have McDonald's great company<br>$73,000 a job New Zealand runs a<br>McDonald's economy we choose to work in<br>lwi income activities we should be<br>working in those sorts of activities<br>inste be working in those so that's the<br>point now you'll be thinking well look<br>this all sounds great but you couldn't<br>make computers in the Ze You' probably<br>be right and you can't manufactur the<br>because you can't compete with the<br>Chinese they're so efficient and they're<br>so cheap they're wages you can't<br>manufacture the biggest single component<br>of exports of the New Zealand economy<br>2010 is<br>manufacturing it is bigger than Dairy<br>it is way bigger than meat it is bigger<br>than tourism that's the single biggest<br>single component of New Zealand's<br>economy and exports is manufacturing and<br>a large proportion of that is what's<br>known as elaborately transformed<br>manufacturing most of this goes a lot of<br>it goes to Australia because of c and to<br>the rest of the world and some of it is<br>invisible to New Zealand for some very<br>interesting reasons but we can<br>manufacture all you have to do is make<br>sure that the product has a very high<br>value and a high profit margin<br>a very high knowledge content in other<br>words and there are varying degrees of<br>knowledge content you can make garden<br>furniture which is good you can make um<br>electric fences you can make uh Crystal<br>controlled oscillators you can make<br>nuclear magnetic resonance spectrometers<br>there's a whole value chain there and<br>the further you go up that value chain<br>the more you can manufacture in New<br>Zealand it's very interesting but what<br>drives that is knowledge and the<br>fundamental basis of innovation because<br>what I'm talking here is an Economy<br>based on innovation<br>is really about research and development<br>what you pay for in those products is<br>not the manufacturing cost and NR I<br>think as I recall our manufacturing<br>costs are about one quarter of our sales<br>price three4 of our sales price was the<br>R&amp;D that we had to do to make that<br>product it's the brain work and so R&amp;D<br>is the is the furnace that feeds this<br>and this is where we do very poorly in<br>New Zealand our rate of investment as a<br>fraction of GDP is one of the lowest in<br>the oecd both government black and<br>Industrial uh private investment way<br>less than the oecd average we're about<br>05% GDP is represent at $800 million a<br>year of government spending now I'm not<br>saying more government money would solve<br>this problem um it might seem a signal<br>that it's important but I'm not this is<br>not a clamor for more government money<br>really what we need is more investment<br>from business and part of the problem is<br>that it reflects the nature of business<br>I mean if you're exporting milk powder<br>you don't need a lot of R&amp;D and so<br>that's why we are as we are it's not<br>that industry is bad and they need to be<br>have a kick up the pants it just<br>reflects the fact that our economy<br>doesn't have enough of that um knowledge<br>based component in it how do we get out<br>of that vicious cycle how do we<br>encourage industry to invest for that's<br>a political question which I leave to<br>the politicians but it is important to<br>us that's the point I want to make and<br>the other problem is we have a terrible<br>terrible difficulty in New Zealand we we<br>screw up I think so often and it's<br>because we we we we get into sloppy<br>thinking and here's a little argument<br>I'll make and you'll hear it from<br>various people New Zealand is very small<br>true therefore we can't do everything<br>true so we have to specialize now I'm<br>terrified what the hell are we going to<br>specialize of oh you get the answer<br>we've got to play to our strengths play<br>to our strengths what are we good at<br>what we good at farming and we're clean<br>and green and things like that so we'll<br>do what could we add to F we could do<br>biotechnology we tried that 10 years<br>that was our proportion of investment in<br>biotechnology that's the United stat<br>states of precaution France Britain<br>Korea you name it but we went for it big<br>time it turned out that it didn't<br>produce much of an outcome and it wasn't<br>the fault of anyone in the that<br>Community it's just that it's really<br>hard to get biotechnology to go because<br>if you're making new products for<br>medicine for example like drugs and so<br>for you need to do big trials and it's<br>very expensive and there a lot of<br>investment and we didn't have the source<br>of investment capital and<br>so we've got another one now you hear<br>politicians talk about clean tech we<br>should do clean tech that's like<br>windmills we're going to be better at<br>making windmills than the rest of the<br>world why because we're clean and green<br>so we should want to right or maybe it's<br>Smart Foods we'll make Smart Foods now<br>the problem with this is that I'm a I'm<br>a one of those pesky scientists I like<br>to go to the lab and do a measurement so<br>I'll ask what are we good at in New<br>Zealand and that's the list you won't be<br>a to read that but it's you know if you<br>go to statistics New Zealand they won't<br>be able to tell you the answer to that<br>because they don't measure this it takes<br>a private company to measure what we're<br>producing in the knowledge sector and<br>it's called the tin 100 technology<br>investment net 100 you have to pay $250<br>to report produced by a wonderful man<br>called Greg shadah and that's his<br>business and he analyzes that part of<br>the interent economy from the biggest<br>down to the smallest that's the top 100<br>companies in the knowledge sector and<br>the two green bars there are the only<br>two biotech companies New Zealand<br>Pharmaceuticals and Douglas<br>Pharmaceuticals the rest are weird<br>they're making crystal control<br>oscillators for GPS and mobile handsets<br>they're making respiratory humidifiers<br>and sleep AP devices they're doing<br>digital special effects for movies well<br>we've all heard of that one that's what<br>they're doing and who would have guessed<br>that we' do those<br>things well it's not so surprising when<br>you think about it because I come back<br>to these two guys that I started with<br>why did we produce as our two greatest<br>scientists a nuclear physicist and a<br>polemist surely we should have produced<br>an earthquake scientist and a plant<br>scientist I haven't the faintest idea<br>why that's just the way it is it just<br>happened to the Quicky little place we<br>are we throw up these weird things that<br>we're good at it's just the way it is so<br>what I say is we will be good at what we<br>are good at and we should not be<br>prescriptive we should not think we<br>should put our eggs in clean tech or put<br>our eggs in biotech we should put our<br>eggs where the investors see good Market<br>opportunities because basically this is<br>made by brilliant entrepreneurs this is<br>not about clever scientists this is not<br>about CL Engineers it's ultimately about<br>brilliant business people because what<br>you have to do here is to do something<br>quite remarkable you have to lever off<br>the fact that we're a tiny country and<br>what that leads to is another Paradox<br>and the Paradox is this these are some<br>of our high-tech companies if you want<br>to be an investor in a high-tech company<br>ask them what they do and if it sounds<br>good don't invest in that<br>company what do I mean by that if it<br>sounds good to<br>you it may be sound pretty good to a lot<br>of other people in the world and the<br>world's a lot bigger than us we are not<br>going to make computers we are not going<br>to make flat screen television sets<br>we're going to do strange little niches<br>and here's where the advantage comes in<br>the advantage for New Zealand being so<br>small being 2% of the world's economy is<br>that the world's economy is 500 times<br>bigger than us and what that means is<br>there are little pieces of it out there<br>that are far too small for General<br>Electric Apple computer or Samsung to to<br>even bother<br>with and you grab a piece of that and<br>you're so tiny it can be really big for<br>you if you dominate The World Market in<br>respiratory humidifiers and sleep AP<br>devices as fish and pyal healthcare does<br>you've got a $500 million a year export<br>business employing 2,000 people that's<br>the name of the game you got to do weird<br>and you got to find the niches and that<br>requires entrepreneurial genius and<br>understanding of how to meld the<br>technology and skill and Engineering<br>skills to that market opportunity that<br>you've seen and that's the genius that's<br>needed and that's really the challenge<br>but the the great opportunity with these<br>companies is they don't produce<br>greenhouse gases they don't put nitrates<br>in our streams they don't require energy<br>they don't require land they don't dump<br>mine tailings on our landscape they are<br>completely environmentally benign and<br>there is no limit to the number of<br>companies like that that you could have<br>but there is an issue around why you<br>would have those companies that I come<br>back to well here's the thing I I<br>couldn't get the information from<br>Statics New Zealand they don't keep it<br>they'll give you stuff about how much<br>jke we export but they won't tell you<br>about this say something about the<br>thinking doesn't it but there's Greg<br>Shanahan's data unfortunately he's only<br>got five years of it that's our total<br>exports there's you can see that red<br>line looked like it's climbing faster<br>than the blue line and it is it's<br>growing faster well I'll tell you who<br>does measure our high-tech exports even<br>though New Zealand government can't<br>bother to measure it the World Bank does<br>and they have a definition of high-tech<br>which is really super Hightech it's you<br>know um ICT and pharmaceuticals and uh<br>uh Aerospace and so on so it's a smaller<br>part of than the 10 10100 list list is<br>but it goes for more years and look at<br>the slope of that it's shooting up it's<br>kind of you know a few ups and downs on<br>the way the average rate of growth of<br>that super high-tech area for New<br>Zealand small as it is only a few<br>hundred million is 11% perom and our<br>economy has been growing at 3% perom for<br>a long long time time that's what<br>developed countries do so it's it's<br>getting bigger and bigger it's happening<br>it's happening people our kids don't<br>know about it their parents don't know<br>about it but the people running these<br>businesses know about it and they're not<br>telling you and they're not telling you<br>because they don't need to because they<br>don't sell a damn thing to new<br>zealanders it's all sold offshore it's<br>invisible and it's weird so why would we<br>know about it except for one and that's<br>wetter because we all go to the movies<br>now here's another bit of science attack<br>my friend Shan hindy Professor Shan Hy<br>done an analysis of that 10100 and he's<br>plotted on a log log graph of the<br>probability of finding a company above a<br>certain amount of export per year versus<br>the number of companies and it sort of<br>goes into what's called a straight line<br>and when a physicist sees a straight<br>line on a log log graph we get very<br>excited we say it's a power law you<br>think what does that mean I'll tell you<br>what it means it means complexity it<br>means interconnectedness it means<br>ecosystem that's what it means it means<br>self-organized criticality it means you<br>got a complex interconnected system and<br>I'll give you some examples earthquakes<br>are like that a whole of the Earth's<br>crusted interconnected there's the Graal<br>earthquakes how many earthquakes do you<br>have what's the problem of an earthquake<br>above a certain size in Christ Church<br>they have lots and lots of<br>earthquakes many smaller ones a fewer<br>larger ones there's a slope there see<br>it's the same graad this is tree<br>diameters in a Colombian Forest<br>rainforest an ecosystem what it's<br>telling you is you can't have the big<br>ones without the small ones they know<br>that in Christ Church you get after<br>shocks you can't have big trees without<br>small ones as well you can't have the<br>big companies without the little ones<br>the whole thing is an ecosystem we need<br>more of these little companies feeding<br>in more startups don't just focus on the<br>big companies look at the whole thing<br>that's what the numbers tell us they<br>have profound insights as to how we grow<br>it and so the big companies are the ones<br>that bring us a lot of money and if we<br>take the top 10 of them it's 3.5 billion<br>a year and remember that figure I asked<br>you to remember 40 billion we're to 40<br>billion so instead of 10 of these<br>companies we need 120 well let's say 100<br>now we've solved the problem for New<br>Zealand 10 of those 100 100 companies<br>not 10 it's have 100 if we had 100 we'd<br>have we rded the Gap we've done nothing<br>bad to our<br>environment um and we've got something<br>quite remarkable which is sustainable<br>for the future and what does it take it<br>takes 100 brilliant entrepreneurs<br>we're a country of 5.4 mil million<br>people wait a minute I thought we you<br>know 4. no no no there a million livers<br>overseas I'll come to them in a minute<br>okay can we find 100 people please I<br>think we can I know we can but you know<br>our kids don't know about this because<br>we're not telling them about it because<br>these businesses are invisible and I<br>think this is the problem if we started<br>to think right if we started to think<br>this is what we do in New Zealand clean<br>and green yes that's why we love it here<br>we've got to do more of that we've got<br>to protect our environment more but<br>actually we're<br>smart but then why would those<br>businesses stay in New Zealand once<br>they're successful fona is stuck here<br>because the lands here but why is<br>fisherman pel here why don't they move<br>to San Diego or Shanghai why don't they<br>move to Sydney they'd be closer to their<br>markets and is it because there's more<br>investment Capital here no more R&amp;D<br>money available no more graduates from<br>University no there is only one reason<br>those companies can be here the only one<br>I can find and tell me if there's<br>another one<br>and that's it it's because the people<br>who are the creative engines of those<br>companies love living in New Zealand<br>they say stop it I don't want to live in<br>Sydney I want to live in New Zealand and<br>that's why they're here and so the key<br>to Growing the sort of business is to<br>make New Zealand a place where Talent<br>wants to live and there in lies certain<br>consequences because creative talented<br>people don't want to live in gated<br>communities with poverty and crime on<br>their doorsteps they do care about the<br>environment we know this in our own<br>company we recruit brilliant people from<br>Germany United States they come here<br>they love trout fishing they love<br>mountain biking they love the outdoors<br>they love New Zealand andv but they love<br>the society as well and if we don't get<br>the importance of social justice of good<br>schools of a decent Health System of<br>Safe Streets and a pristine environment<br>then we don't understand the business<br>plan for New Zealand because that's what<br>it's got to be and if you have that as<br>your mission statement there are certain<br>consequence I'll give you one<br>example Rodney HRA terribly excited<br>after earthquake he look we can do it<br>now we get away with let's going to dig<br>up all the national parks because we've<br>got a crisis and they'll let us do it<br>and we can you know we can get hundreds<br>of billions of dollars well you got a<br>bit excited was about 60 billion all<br>together under the ground maybe<br>somewhere some maybe some of it's the<br>National Parts but if you have a<br>business plan like the one I'm talking<br>about you're not interested in $60<br>billion at the cost of all you hold deer<br>you after 40 billion a year sustainably<br>for the future and I thank you I don't<br>look I don't wish this is not about<br>politics and I've got nothing against<br>people who have different economic<br>theories but it's just a business model<br>because if we don't get it right people<br>won't want to live here we won't attract<br>our best and brightest home we won't<br>attract uh the clever and capable and<br>talented people in the world to come and<br>live here now there are challenges for<br>us about if we grow Prosperity get that<br>income disparity dealt with and I want<br>to say something about that in a moment<br>and I would be remiss with the chancelor<br>president and the vice Chancellor if I<br>did not mention the essential role of<br>universities all this not just Victoria<br>University I might add even Oakland<br>University perhaps even Oto University<br>they do and you see one of the things<br>you find about these great Innovation<br>cers the world you go to Boston you go<br>to R darham the Research Triangle area<br>of North Carolina you go to the B San<br>Francisco Bay Area you go to Cambridge<br>University where I'm currently on leave<br>at Trinity College you see these giant<br>science Parks the reason that it hums<br>there is that people go to Great<br>universities they love the experience<br>they love the quality of life in those<br>places cuz Boston's a wonderful place<br>place to live and so is the Bay Area and<br>they don't want to leave they just stick<br>around and they start companies and<br>there's this vibrancy about it because<br>universities create a kind of a life to<br>a place and they provide Regional<br>leadership they act as a hub they bring<br>International people in the movie<br>industry does that too so I'm not just<br>claiming that you know the university<br>does<br>that my cousin was in a bar the other<br>night she that's Orlando Bloom over<br>there it was too it was James n but<br>they're in the same you know this is<br>Wellington this is it you know we got<br>the Roxy Theater you know I got a friend<br>lives the bay are says there's nothing<br>like Lighthouse Pon or the Rox SE<br>anywhere in the whole San Francisco Bay<br>Area nothing we've got some fabulous<br>things here this is a place where Talent<br>wants to live that's what makes<br>Wellington a vibrant place we're so<br>proud of but universities are a part of<br>that um dear that's some news from last<br>week you know we got a good I'm sorry we<br>need to look after our universities<br>that's really important uh but there's<br>something else as well we have to take<br>responsibility as scientists I showed<br>you a graph before that said our public<br>application rate is one of the highest<br>in the world this is our patenting rate<br>one of the lowest there is a culture<br>problem in New Zealand science we the<br>science Community have got a problem we<br>too many of us are stuck in phase two<br>we're stuck we trying to get the best<br>Publications the best journal to prove<br>that we can do international science in<br>New Zealand well I'm sorry we've already<br>proven that we've done that experiment<br>it's not even interesting you can what<br>can we do to make science valuable for<br>this country so we have to start<br>thinking about intellectual property and<br>it's quite consistent with being able to<br>be openly publishing in fact pening<br>makes it more easy for you to speak<br>about these things so I think that's a<br>proof that we have a culture problem and<br>part of this is to address to my own<br>fellow scientists how they can<br>contribute it's not just about signing<br>companies it's about how they can<br>contribute to using our resources<br>protecting our environment and all the<br>knowledge that scientists have<br>contribute to the life of our country I<br>want to say something else about<br>education and I have that word on my<br>title<br>education in schooling I mentioned we do<br>very well we did not always do well in<br>1990 we were somewhere on the upper end<br>but not at the top end of the oecd<br>that's the P of maths and Science school<br>the oecd uses that's GDP per capita 1995<br>countries had got better Korea had<br>massively improved and the biggest<br>Improvement in GDP for Capital and<br>prosperity occurred in the countries<br>with the high score from secondary<br>schooling secondary schooling is<br>absolutely vital to prosperity and<br>here's the great news New Zealand in<br>2006 is now one of the highest in the<br>oecd we have a fabulous school system in<br>New Zealand you'll hear it knocked all<br>the time we have a fabulous school<br>system in New Zealand all right it's one<br>of the great secret the rest of the<br>world knows this that's where we are now<br>we have no excuse not to improve our<br>performance we will improve the<br>performance in our<br>economy however there is an issue there<br>there is inequity and the inequity in<br>our school system is if you break it<br>down by ethnic group you find that Pacar<br>and Asian are well above the average in<br>science maths and reading but Mari and<br>Pacifica are lagging behind and we have<br>to address that Gap because there in I<br>believe lies the fundamental cause of<br>income disparity New Zealand we have to<br>do a better job at providing true<br>educational opportunity for all our<br>young people and not just for a few and<br>yet what do some schools do they say we<br>don't offer the NCA we offer the<br>Cambridge International exam that's what<br>they say why do they do that is it that<br>there's something wrong with our<br>education system in New Zealand no it's<br>actually one of the best in the world<br>the problem is we don't educate our kids<br>to see a future here and half them leave<br>us and never come back and what is that<br>message that we send to our children<br>when we say we don't bother with New<br>Zealand exams we do the mother country<br>exam what are we telling them it's a<br>no-brainer to me we've got to stand up<br>and grow up and see the real problems<br>and face them because the great tragedy<br>of New Zealand is there's migration from<br>New Zealand and the dark arrow is<br>graduates from universities of all the<br>countries in the oecd we export more<br>graduates per capita than any single<br>country 24% of our graduates leave New<br>Zealand and do not come back 50% of the<br>kids who come out of medical school<br>leave New Zealand and do not come back<br>you can travel the world and your<br>children will be there and they part of<br>our enormously talented diaspora because<br>they haven't seen their future here and<br>that is a the real tragedy and that's<br>the educational problem that we've got<br>to address how do we create<br>opportunities and this is why I love<br>this man because this man should be in<br>Burbank California he's a fruit cake<br>just like Jackson they are here why<br>because they're passionate nutcase new<br>zealanders who say you know where I am<br>I'm in Wellington come and see me I want<br>to be here that is enormously important<br>because these people are true Global<br>players and they've chosen to do it from<br>here and I'm so proud of young new<br>zealanders who guard Bo and do well but<br>it ain't hard to do well in New York<br>when you're well educated and<br>hardworking or in London or in Tokyo but<br>Take On The World from New Zealand and<br>succeed that's a real measure of success<br>and those are the values we offer should<br>be offering to our young people and what<br>is the real opportunity it's that you<br>can make a difference and I say to<br>people who are part of our diaspora in<br>New York you might be surrounded by br<br>people and it may be very stimulating<br>but you will never change that Society<br>come back to New Zealand and you will<br>not be surrounded by a lot of other<br>brilliant people you will have to be the<br>one who provides leadership but boy you<br>will make a difference and that's the<br>message that I think we need to give to<br>our young people the real opportunity to<br>fulfill yourself in New Zealand as the<br>chance to make a difference to your<br>country and I think that's a marvelous<br>opportunity and it's not just about<br>science it is about the creative sector<br>it is about uh the movie industry it's<br>about fashion it's about our quirky<br>design it's about all sorts of things<br>like clothing but it's got to be smart<br>and it's got to be the best in the world<br>and it's got to be what the world wants<br>to buy I want to finish with a reason<br>why this country will succeed it's a<br>dark and dangerous world out there in<br>many ways there are problems looming for<br>the world but in those fundamental areas<br>we are extraordinar well-placed we have<br>ample Water Supplies we have renewable<br>energy we have an ability to deal with<br>global climate change because we have<br>multiple climatic regions we are robust<br>in that regard we have excellent<br>education and best of all we have a<br>civil society we are nice to each other<br>here our politicians are nice to each<br>other believe me it's worst he store in<br>the world we are a nice country who<br>wouldn't want to live here if we make<br>this a place where Talent can Thrive<br>it's an optimistic view but it's one my<br>old dad would have loved because he was<br>an optimist about everything except one<br>thing and that was my Rugby plane and I<br>want to tell you when I was 12 he said<br>to me Paul I'm never going to watch you<br>play rugby again cuz I find it too<br>humiliating and he was right but I also<br>learned to respect those who can play<br>rugby so I want to finish with this go<br>the All Blacks thank<br>PA ladies and gentlemen the vice<br>Chancellor professor Pat Walsh will<br>extend our appreciation to Professor<br>support<br>Callahan thank you Chancellor and thank<br>you Paul for that inspirational and<br>thought-provoking<br>address occasions like this which are<br>relatively rare when we get get together<br>to reflect on where we need to go as a<br>nation and what our priorities need to<br>be to get there are instrumental in<br>helping us choose a better future<br>there's no out that Paul has told us a<br>compelling story this evening he mixes<br>insights with dare I say it common sense<br>and Science and explains it all in such<br>a way that lets us sit back and say well<br>of course that's what we need at<br>Victoria University students and staff<br>benefit from Paul's wisdom and years of<br>experience as a professor a teacher a<br>mentor and a science communicator and<br>I'm delighted that we were able to offer<br>you all the opportunity to hear his<br>analysis and be be inspired by his<br>vision for New<br>Zealand and we are delighted that you<br>attend it Victoria Prides itself on<br>being integral to the capital city we<br>serve we're a
