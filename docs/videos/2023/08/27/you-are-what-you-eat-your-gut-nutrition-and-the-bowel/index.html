the<br>University of otago Christ chch it's<br>indeed my privilege as Dean and head of<br>campus to welcome you along uh some of<br>you look a little bit familiar maybe<br>have attended some of our earlier um<br>public lectures and it's a real pleasure<br>that we have you along this evening um I<br>tried to think of a waterer about gut<br>health and there's not a lot um and so<br>but what I do love about this particular<br>waterer and some of you uh may have<br>heard it before sorry may have heard it<br>before is that it actually comes and it<br>says Fina food is the blood of the<br>people but the welfare of the people<br>lies in the land and I'm really really<br>excited about this evening and our<br>amazing lineup that we have for you um<br>and I promise it we'll be more like<br>Oprah and less like Dr Phil uh in<br>relation to our how evidence um has<br>developed and how these amazing people<br>that we're going to hear from tonight<br>actually contribute to us understanding<br>that real connection and a holistic um<br>approach to uh our gut health and<br>to I was going to say moving forward but<br>it's a little bit inappropriate in the<br>current context but and to really<br>understanding our own ho water and<br>moving forward that with that so again<br>just on behalf of the University of<br>otago Christ Church uh welcome uh no<br>myay we hope you have an enjoyable uh<br>evening we're very excited about um<br>um uh not just what will be presented<br>but what you're going to ask of our<br>staff and we we're looking forward to um<br>exciting questions that will take this<br>cop up up further so without um further<br>Ado I'd like to welcome um introduce you<br>this evening to our MC uh and our<br>Laur thanks Su Oto to welcome everybody<br>to this the fourth and final of our<br>public talk series to celebrate kial the<br>University of Oto Christ Church's 50th<br>Anniversary showcasing our excellence<br>work seek knowledge for the sake of your<br>well-being and that's very apt tonight<br>and probably what's brought many of you<br>along in recent years there's been an<br>explosion of international research<br>relating to gut health with Revelations<br>that our gut is far more important to<br>our overall health than was previously<br>known and that we are in fact what we<br>eat and that as you'll hear we are<br>probably we are apparently more gut um<br>than human which is a fascinating<br>concept clinicians are also seeing<br>increasing numbers of patients<br>presenting with diseases of the gut IBS<br>Crohns colitis um bow conditions and<br>also colon and gut cancers with more and<br>more public awareness growing mercifully<br>but also more and more patients<br>presenting 20s 30s and 40s um with some<br>of these cancers which is a cause for<br>concern tonight you'll hear the word<br>microbiome of fair bit the gut<br>microbiome being the collection of<br>genetic material from the microbes in<br>your gut around three million genes<br>digesting the fiber from your food<br>shaping your immune system and helping<br>protect from pathogens you'll also hear<br>how important and vital diet is to these<br>gut microbes we have three as sus has<br>mentioned highly respected researchers<br>from this campus here to talk tonight<br>Professor Richard giri Dr Katherine wall<br>and Professor Frank velle all recognized<br>leaders in their field and in the<br>Forefront of the latest research into<br>gut health<br>internationally um we'll be shortly<br>hearing individually from all three<br>following this there will be a Q&amp;A<br>session with what time we have left and<br>we welcome um nice quick and um<br>pertinent questions the um speakers will<br>be here afterwards very briefly if you<br>want to come down and ask a question of<br>them uh yourself more more personally um<br>for a short amount of time Professor<br>Richard Gary now he's a graduate of the<br>University of otago receiving his<br>medical degree 1995 and qualifying as a<br>consultant physician in 20 4 he's a<br>professor of medicine here on campus has<br>just recently stepped down after five<br>years as the academic head of our<br>department of medicine and is a busy<br>consultant gastroenterologist at tiata<br>Ora Canterbury waha Christ CH hospital<br>he's published and been cited in<br>hundreds of research papers and has a<br>strong clinical and research interest in<br>inflammatory bow disease irritable bowel<br>syndrome and nutrition his IBD research<br>has included the epidemiology of IBD how<br>common it is and who gets it as well as<br>IBD genetics and clinical<br>outcomes he's the previous medical<br>director of the New Zealand nutrition<br>Foundation he's a medical adviser for<br>Crohns and Colitis New Zealand a trustee<br>of the gut foundation and a member of<br>the International Organization for the<br>Richard thank you so much for that uh<br>fantastic introduction can everyone hear<br>me okay it's being projected great so<br>thank you once again for that fantastic<br>introduction it's great to be here this<br>is a really important moment for me I<br>was here as a medical student a long<br>time ago uh I came back to do my PhD<br>studies here and now I'm employed here<br>so I don't know what's left after that<br>there probably a hole in the ground<br>somewhere where I'll end up when uh my<br>life's my life's all done so it's really<br>great to be here tonight with great<br>colleagues to speak on uh on the gut and<br>um tonight tonight we're going to talk<br>about you are what you eat and to do<br>that I'm going to start by by<br>introducing the three of us myself I'm<br>professor of medicine Katherine W who's<br>a dietitian and she's also um a research<br>fellow here at the University ofo and<br>Christ church and then Frank felle col<br>colal surgeon and professor of surgery<br>so what what I want to do is set the<br>scene for what the gut looks like when<br>it's normal I'm going to take you on a<br>bit of a journey all the way through uh<br>we'll talk about the things that can go<br>wrong Here There and Everywhere we'll<br>talk about the microbiome and a little<br>bit about food but the real food experts<br>Katherine who's a register dietitian and<br>she'll start talking about food with<br>regards to how it can impact on health<br>and disease and how we can use food to<br>make us not just uh healthier but also<br>to to treat disease as such and then<br>we're going to finish with Frank frelle<br>and he'll be talking about Bale cancer<br>the microbiome and how that fits in back<br>in with diet so what I want to start you<br>with is talking just a bit about the<br>healthy gut so I want to take you on a<br>journey it's a journey that I don't get<br>to do often the whole way just part of<br>the way here's a journey from the bottom<br>of the Bell going up through the colon<br>this but sort of interesting the colon<br>it's not too bed you see there the<br>beautiful Hol folds and the blood<br>vessels looking quite cool but then<br>we're going to get to the really<br>exciting bed in a minute we're going to<br>pop down into the seeum and then we're<br>going to get into the small intestine<br>the small intestine is so cool it is<br>amazing during the surface area of the<br>small intestine it's the size of a<br>tennis court all the vli there that<br>increase that surface area it's pretty<br>amazing then we come out of the small<br>intestine go up into the stomach the<br>stomach's like a food a food um Blitzer<br>like a making a milkshake just mixes<br>everything up and we go up through the<br>esus and out it comes and there we go so<br>I usually when I do colonoscopy I just<br>get to go part of the way not the whole<br>way like that but there we go so as a<br>gastrologist people think well do you<br>just spend all day doing colonoscopy do<br>you just walk around all day with one of<br>these things and uh and uh poke it in<br>different places and try and see what's<br>going on and generate photos like this<br>so this is a colonoscope this is one I<br>watched it earlier if you want to pass<br>it around um so um so that's how we<br>that's how we examine the Bell we have a<br>good look around and we use endoscopy a<br>lot to to look at what's going on in the<br>Gap okay so here's the gastrointestinal<br>trait sorry it's a bit of an awkward<br>thing to pass around it's I should have<br>just seen given something a bit smaller<br>uh so this is the gastrointestinal tra<br>and this is the different places where<br>we can find abnormality so at the top<br>we've got the esophagus so this is the<br>bit that gets food from your mouth to<br>your stomach and some of you will know<br>about reflux or that burning you can get<br>in behind your chest that's indigestion<br>that's when the stomach acid comes up<br>into the esophagus also cancer can can<br>occur there as well<br>we've got the stomach next so that's<br>where that uh the acid and enzymes mixes<br>with your food to break things down from<br>Big molecules or big areas down to small<br>molecules that makes something called<br>Kim and Kim's what leaves your stomach<br>to be digested further down and we know<br>about stomach ulcers in that area we<br>know about helicop pylori and stomach<br>cancer as well as the small intestine<br>sort of my favorite as as I've alluded<br>to that's where we can where we absorb<br>digest and absorb food nutrients it's<br>also where we uh where people can get<br>celiac disease and Crohn's disease you<br>will have heard about before jenal ois<br>for example then the bit at the end the<br>the the the colon is where people can<br>get colon polyps coloral cancer ulcer of<br>kaleidos for example so the range of<br>different things going on Liz you KN<br>know what you're doing with that don't<br>you it's one of the endoscopy nurses<br>here so that's<br>good okay so so that's all good and well<br>but where do you where do you what do<br>you want to know what what's some sort<br>of a big take-home message from tonight<br>well these are the things as a doctor<br>that I start to get a little bit worried<br>about if patient come and talk to me<br>about it makes me think I need to be<br>thinking about what other tests do I<br>need to do so just look at this list<br>because it's sort of important I think<br>Frank's going to touch on this a little<br>bit later as well so these are what I<br>call the red flag symptoms the symptoms<br>that make me a little bit concerned so<br>if you lose weight like that's usually<br>quite good for someone like me We I need<br>to lose a bit of weight but if you're<br>not trying to lose weight and you lose<br>weight unexplained no good need to go<br>and talk to your doctor okay if you get<br>uh if you're older and the definition of<br>older um changes every year I get older<br>but if you're over if you're if you're<br>over 50 and you have a change in your<br>bell habit then you're going to need to<br>go and see your doctor your GP be a to<br>discuss that with you if you've got a<br>family history with there's a few people<br>with bell cancer or IBD and you get a<br>change in symptoms go and talk to your<br>doctor if you have bleeding from your<br>bell it's never a good thing it may be<br>okay a benign thing but go and talk to<br>your doctor and finally most symptoms<br>that we worry about less go to sleep<br>when you do and wake up when you do in<br>the morning but if you have gut symptoms<br>that keep you awake overnight not<br>because you're worried because it's s or<br>you're going to the toilet go and see<br>your doctor doesn't mean you need a<br>colonoscopy it just means you need to be<br>assessed and then we can work out where<br>we go from there if you want to learn a<br>bit more about that the gut Foundation<br>have got some stuff outside know you're<br>normal which is a good way to think<br>about<br>things one of the reasons we're we we're<br>worried about gut symptoms is that<br>people can develop Bell cancer or<br>colorate with cancer and Frank's going<br>to speak a lot about this later this is<br>this transition we see from Little pops<br>like little warts that can grow over<br>time to become cancer and what we want<br>to do ideally is identify these early<br>because we're seeing more and more cases<br>of bell cancer at an early age and we<br>seeing it a bit more often in women now<br>than we used to as<br>well so that's all good and well but<br>actually it's a bit more complicated<br>than just a tube it's a bit more<br>complicated so not only do we have this<br>tube but we've got this amazing<br>population that lives inside us and as<br>as Laur Le mentioned earlier we're<br>actually more microb than we are human<br>if you up all the cells in our body<br>there's more bacterial cells fungi which<br>aren't cells uh protozoa uh all those<br>things more cells more cells of more<br>more microbial cells than there are<br>human cells that's a symbiotic<br>relationship so we do something for them<br>and they do something for us we provide<br>a pretty cool hotel they they live<br>inside us they get to do their thing but<br>for us they do all this amazing stuff<br>they digest food they make energy they<br>create vitamins regulate the immune<br>system the the uh glucose homeostasis<br>all of those things happen with the<br>microbiome inside us so it's such an<br>amazing thing that that's going on right<br>there the symbiotic relationship and<br>what's more each one of us has got a<br>different microbiome it's about like our<br>our fingerprints each one of us is<br>different and what that means is that<br>potentially that variability that occurs<br>between one person having this<br>microbiome and another one having a<br>different one may potentially influence<br>health and may also potentially<br>influence disease and certainly at our<br>group here we're doing an enormous<br>amount of research trying to understand<br>those links between how things are on<br>the inside what that fingerprint looks<br>like and how your how your um your<br>health is is otherwise<br>so I tell people now that you know we<br>know about the heart and the lungs and<br>the Brain you they're pretty easy and<br>boring the gut really complicated but<br>actually the most important human organ<br>now I think isn't even human that's the<br>microbiome inside us because as we learn<br>more and more about the microbiome we<br>can then start to understand how it can<br>impact what's going<br>on so you thought that was pretty<br>complicated you got this tube called the<br>gut then you got this huge microbiome<br>inside you but actually it's even better<br>so people like to say that inside your<br>gut there's a second brain but they're<br>wrong because as a guest andrologist I<br>know this is your first brain and that's<br>your second brain up there so the<br>important brains down here so you've got<br>this tube you've got these microbes<br>everywhere and then you've got this huge<br>neural network inside your gut which is<br>going to do all sorts of amazing things<br>so if we take your gut and we slice it<br>in half like this and make a picture you<br>can see those yellow networks of nerves<br>that are traveling all through the gut<br>now those nerves can sense what's going<br>on inside the gut they can the<br>microbiome can talk to those nerves and<br>tell them what's going on and they can<br>be B directional information from your<br>brain to your gut that that that that<br>happens and when I talk to patients who<br>have IBS I often say they sh my age<br>remember when you're waiting for um to<br>go into school SE and half the half the<br>half the class went to the toilet well<br>some of them were going because they<br>were going to cheat right under there<br>things and the rest were going because<br>they had IBS and that that nerves was<br>going down and causing those symptoms<br>that's a normal reaction but for some<br>people it's about over over the top so<br>all the neurotransmitters in your brain<br>they're all in your gut most of the body<br>serotonin you know it's not in your<br>brain it's in the gut the gut is where<br>it's<br>at okay so we're going to move on<br>quickly now to inflammatory Bell disease<br>so inflammatory Bell disease is where<br>the guts the gut has become inflamed so<br>here we can see two videos hopefully<br>they'll work on the left Al of kidus you<br>can see that's not like that that video<br>I showed you before and on the right<br>Crohn's disease you can see there's<br>ulceration there's narrowing for Crohn's<br>disease and this this affects probably<br>about 4,000 people in Canterbury uh<br>we're doing research at the moment to<br>look at that and these conditions uh<br>We've looked at over for a long period<br>of time in Christ Church and we've<br>noticed increasing rates very high rates<br>of inflammatory bow disease in<br>Canterbury so here we can see a graph<br>not not too many graphs from here<br>tonight but this is rates of IB of cron<br>disease around the world new diagnoses<br>and the the black line the de black line<br>is in Christ Church or can we've got<br>high rates around the world they're all<br>coming up to that now we believe based<br>on Research that Angela Forbes is doing<br>one of my PhD students that we probably<br>have about 1% of the population with IBD<br>in the next five or so years so who do<br>you know about Cron and clus a lot of<br>people will have in this room there<br>should be people probably bit enriched<br>in this room because people with gut<br>problems won't be more likely to come<br>but a lot of people with IBD all right<br>so that's IBD becoming more common but<br>still not super common what about IBS<br>IBS is where you get abdominal pain with<br>diarrhea or constipation or both and uh<br>the gut looks normal but it doesn't work<br>normally now has anyone been to Bristol<br>here yeah okay so it looks pretty Co<br>I've never been it's got a bridge and a<br>harbor the reason I love Bristol is<br>because the Bristol St chart so why why<br>use why<br>use why use similes and adjectives to<br>describe your poo when you can actually<br>use numbers it's much much more sense so<br>the Bristol Soul chart a fantastic way<br>of describing what's going on and as a<br>gastrologist when someone comes in and<br>tells you their type of sto using a<br>number I'm really a priest it's pretty<br>cool but in saying that the art Artistry<br>around similar metaphors is also quite<br>good so either way is fine but there are<br>ways that we can just describe what's<br>going on with that gut and aif B<br>syndrome it's really common affects one<br>in six men one in nine women there's a<br>lot of it out there and this is uh this<br>is causing abdominal pain diarrhea<br>constipation and that's something we<br>really focusing on with regards to diet<br>not just inflammatory B disease but also<br>arital Bale syndrome and in fact in this<br>space we've done a lot of work with the<br>microbiome trying to understand what's<br>going on in phebe henan a PhD student<br>graduated a year or two ago is basically<br>been to reclassify iral Bell syndrome on<br>the basis of your microbiome your<br>responses and other things going on on<br>your body so that now we've got a much<br>deeper understanding which we hope will<br>subsequently leave lead to better<br>treatments so I just want to leave you<br>with this thought uh you know the gut<br>sounded pretty simple straightforward a<br>bit of a tube that starts here and ends<br>somewhere down there uh you don't think<br>about it too much you just put food on<br>one end and then go to the toilet every<br>so often with the other but but actually<br>it's way more complicated there are more<br>bacterial cells microbes in your body<br>than there are human cells you've got<br>this whole brain that's much more<br>interesting than this one down here and<br>they're all working together and diet is<br>the thing that actually modulates what's<br>going on so I want to hand over now to<br>Katherine who's going to talk about diet<br>in much more detail and thank you very<br>much just a question um just a question<br>of you Richard that cerb our rate being<br>so high why why are we so high spent the<br>last 20 years trying to work that one<br>out um so I think I think it's a<br>combination of things I think firstly<br>the study we did was very thorough so we<br>looked very hard so I think we found<br>cases where maybe others hadn't in their<br>population I think also that uh it<br>appears that that a lot of the increases<br>in IBD you get worldwide occur with<br>urbanization so with urbanization you<br>get changes in diet yeah more processed<br>foods uh all those sorts of things which<br>Katherine will be a to speak about as<br>well so with those changes in diet it's<br>probably one of the things that changes<br>your microbiome your microbiome then<br>interacts with the gut immune system<br>which usually is pretty relaxed and<br>chilled about those bacteria all of a<br>sudden it gets really upset and starts<br>to fight and then you get inflammation<br>going on so I think that um if you look<br>all around the world now the rates are<br>going up and the really scary thing for<br>me is if you think about places in the<br>world that are less uh less uh um<br>urbanized uh less westernized uh they've<br>got enormous populations and they so<br>Asia Africa and they're becoming more<br>urbanized and if you see the rates of<br>these diseases go up the total number of<br>people is going to be very large so<br>interesting okay that's wonderful thank<br>you Richard um Dr Katherine W now<br>Katherine's um both an experienced<br>gastroenterology dietitian specializing<br>in the care of people with inflammatory<br>bow disease and a research fellow in our<br>campus's internationally recognized<br>gastrointestinal unit for translational<br>studies now she obtained her PhD in<br>nutritional therapy for Crohn's disease<br>here at this campus and completed<br>post-doctoral research in diet nutrition<br>and inflammatory bow disease at K's<br>College in London alongside her own<br>research Katherine supervises student<br>research in the fields of nutrition and<br>gastrointestinal diseases and disorders<br>and particularly IBD her current focus<br>is on understanding the relationship<br>between nutrition and gut inflammation<br>and her Ambitions I understand are to<br>improve New Zealand's access to and<br>awareness of scientifically supported<br>nutrition and foods to optimize gut<br>health I'm sure Katherine will tell us<br>you<br>one so thank you very much um for the<br>opportunity to speak here and I'm<br>excited to have uh my husband and two<br>children in the audience and this is the<br>first time that they've seen me speak so<br>that's um<br>nerve-wracking um so as a dietician I<br>translate nutrition science into food<br>recommendations so nutrition science is<br>um the study of the new nutrients that<br>are in our food or the lack of nutrients<br>in some of the foods um in modern<br>society and the impact that that has on<br>our<br>house often when um people find out that<br>I'm a dietitian it's usually in a social<br>function like we had earlier and the<br>first question they ask is oh is what<br>I'm eating good for me so I can don't<br>worry I'm not assessing your nutrition<br>intake when we're having a social<br>conversation um but in regards to my<br>children I am counting the number of<br>fruits and vegetables that they're<br>having in their lunch box and how many<br>they're having um at their dinner each<br>night so I thought maybe we'd start by<br>doing a little um hands up um exercise<br>to assess whether or not you all in the<br>audience are eating your fruits and<br>vegetables so I'd like you to raise your<br>hand if you think that you eat um two<br>serves of fruit a day so serve is like<br>what you can fit in your hand<br>capped two or more oh my gosh that looks<br>like almost 100% well um you're not the<br>normal um New<br>Zealander so New Zealand asks every year<br>in the New Zealand Health survey um how<br>many servings of fruits and vegetables<br>do you eat and in 2021 2022 only 50% of<br>adults um said they ate two or more<br>servings of fruit each day and three qus<br>of um children at their recommended uh<br>one serving a day so you yeah you're not<br>normal in that respect so how about<br>vegetables the current recommendations<br>are five serves so it used to be three<br>but we know that vegetables are really<br>good for our health so it's been<br>increased to five um a serving is sort<br>of cup two hands or like a cup of salad<br>or half a cup of um cooked vegetables so<br>raise your hand if you think you get<br>five and it includes potatoes<br>maybe not fried potatoes but includes<br>doesn't um so that was maybe like three<br>quarters so again you're you're very<br>abnormal um only 10% of New Zealand<br>adult population eat five or more<br>sewings of vegetables and what I think<br>is really alarming is that less than 10%<br>of our children are eating two and a<br>half servings of vegetables<br>um and the reason why this is important<br>is that we know that our fruits and<br>vegetables are really good sources of um<br>dietary fiber um which helps to feed um<br>our gut microbes it's also really good<br>sources of vitamins minerals polyphenols<br>which are those color which gives fruit<br>and vegetables the color um and these<br>will have anti-inflammatory um<br>effects so dietary fiber isn't just one<br>thing but as you can see in these um<br>pictur pictures this is just a sample of<br>six different types of dietary fibers<br>and our main sources of dietary fibers<br>um uh well dietary fibers only occur in<br>plant Foods um and fruits and vegetables<br>you can see here have um the covering<br>off four of these different types but<br>also our grains um nuts seeds um legumes<br>lentils all of the plant foods are what<br>provide us with our dietary fiber and<br>what we're really aiming for is<br>variety because eating a variety of<br>different plant Foods is going to give<br>us a variety of different dietary fibers<br>in feed different um microbes that are<br>living in our<br>gut um so sort of moving on from that we<br>can use food to um treat gut symptoms as<br>Richard alluded to so here at the campus<br>we've done um quite a few studies<br>looking at how we can use food uh to<br>treat<br>constipation um um and one study that<br>we're involved in was a study done here<br>but also in Italy and Japan where we<br>gave people either two green kiwi fruit<br>or the equivalent um fiber in the form<br>of psyllium husk the cium husk is um a<br>type of fiber it's most commonly known<br>as minam musil um and is a um is<br>available on prescription to treat<br>constipation comir at the supermarket so<br>in this study um what we found was that<br>eating two green kiwi fruit um was as<br>good as um having cium husk and that it<br>resulted in one more complete<br>spontaneous bow motion which is like the<br>gold standard for a season constipation<br>per week so if you ate two kiwi fruit<br>you were more likely to have one more v<br>motion each week which is quite a big<br>deal if you only go once a week now if<br>you don't like<br>if you don't like dring kiwi fruit it's<br>okay because we also did a study with<br>gold kiwi fruit um and it has um similar<br>effects but how you know how does it<br>work so this is a picture of one half of<br>the bow which Richard has introduced and<br>kiwi fruit Works in multiple different<br>parts of the gut so it works in the um<br>sto stomach to help with digestion to<br>help with um<br>um um gastric emptying so there's also<br>um Sone and our groups also looked at<br>can K fruit upper GI symptoms um and<br>there is a role there as well um kiwi<br>fruit also works on the small<br>intestine um and helps to increase<br>increases the time that increases the<br>speed at which it moves through the<br>small intestine which helps with um um<br>increasing B motions and then it also<br>works in the large intestine helps to<br>draw water in to make a softer fluffier<br>Veil motion um and also changes the gut<br>microbiome um and also changes the um<br>com the compounds that the gut<br>microbiome produces to have um<br>anti-inflammatory effects so Works in<br>lots of different ways compared to<br>taking in a supplement for such as a<br>celium<br>husk um I'm particularly interested in<br>we can use food to treat um inflammatory<br>bowel disease so um my PhD was looking<br>at using um food or lack of food to<br>treat inflammation and Crohn's disease<br>so in my PhD ask people to stop eating<br>all food um which sounds quite radical<br>and and instead have all their nutrition<br>in um liquid form in the form of oral<br>nutrition supplements so I as people to<br>maybe drink of these 200 mil cartons a<br>day um for eight weeks is a treatment<br>for<br>inflammation so a little bit not<br>everyone's up for that um and what we<br>found was that um this treatment which<br>is commonly used in children but I was<br>using it in adults um helped to reduce<br>the symptoms of inflammation their gut<br>symptoms um reduced reduced markers of<br>inflammation in the blood and in the<br>stool um and also altered the<br>composition of the gut microbiome so we<br>think that that changing the composition<br>of the microbes in the gut also has a um<br>important role in the anti-inflammatory<br>properties of the<br>treatment after this um I thought well<br>you know getting people to just have a<br>liquid diet was a bit hard maybe we<br>should also investigate a treatment that<br>includes food so our most recent study<br>um we looked at using um the liquid diet<br>again but also a food-based diet for<br>people with crohn's disease who needed<br>to go and have surgery to remove um part<br>of their<br>vow um and so in this study um you can<br>see those six Foods there um and the<br>main difference between this and a<br>liquid diet is that these foods are<br>actually um quite high in dietary fiber<br>um which is kind of the opposite of the<br>liquid diet which contains no dietary<br>fiber in the plant<br>Foods um in the diet contain high<br>amounts of pon um they also contain a<br>high amount of something called<br>resistant starch and they're there to um<br>have an effect on the gut microbiome and<br>in the study um we found that actually<br>the liquid diet um or the food-based<br>diet um help to reduce the inflammatory<br>markers other Studies have shown that<br>they've um both had similar effects on<br>the gut microbiome um and this is<br>something that we use for in clinical<br>practice before people go for surgery to<br>help to reduce their um inflammation and<br>nutrition um but in our group we also<br>look at you other foods to treat GI<br>symptoms so we've um done studies um<br>looking at reflex diarrhea<br>constipation um bloating and if you look<br>if you looked at the stands beforehand<br>you could see that we currently<br>recruiting people for um a manuka honey<br>study um a milk study and we recently<br>finished a bread study where we added<br>dietary fiber so we're really interested<br>in how we can use food um as treatment<br>um not only in adults um but also in<br>children um and also in older adults as<br>well so sort of the take-home messages I<br>think you know based on our we survey at<br>the start you're all doing pretty well<br>with your fruits and vegetables um but<br>the rest of New Zealand I think me this<br>is our sort of healthy food um guide um<br>and what we're really trying to<br>encourage people to do is eat a variety<br>of of Whole Foods rather than um highly<br>processed foods which tend to dominate<br>our supermarkets at the moment because<br>we know that um Foods in their um most<br>simple form contain more dietary fiber<br>more um micronutrients more<br>phytochemicals all of which have health<br>benef whereas our foods that have been<br>through<br>tree processes have less of these um<br>compounds and are digested very<br>differently to when we're eating real<br>foods and so I just thought I'd finish<br>with um this um quote varieties the very<br>spice of life that gives it all its<br>flavor and I think when we're thinking<br>about health and variety it's not just<br>variety of food that we're eating but we<br>know that if we eat a variety of plant<br>foods that that then results in a more<br>varied gut microbiome which is<br>associated with Better Health and lower<br>disease that's wonderful one thing with<br>the kiwi fruit study and other studies<br>you're<br>doing with drugs like we hear drugs like<br>laxol and drugs like that we hear that<br>over time they can do harm if you take<br>them too often<br>is is it looking is any International<br>research pointing to the fact that<br>things like kiwi fruit might take over<br>and we may not need to have those other<br>drugs that the doctors prescribe<br>us um well I think there's definitely we<br>can use food instead of some of these<br>drugs um and one of our PhD students has<br>just finished looking at constipation in<br>a um Residential Care setting um and<br>well actually she was looking at<br>diarrhea and the Residential Care PE<br>setting and found out that many people<br>with diarrhea prescrib lots of laxatives<br>and a side effect is you know people<br>with constipation were provided lots of<br>laxatives and a side effect was diarrhea<br>whereas if we were implementing more<br>food-based treatments we don't get those<br>same side effects right okay all right<br>very good thank you Katherine now<br>Professor Frank felle in zom is an<br>exceptionally busy man he's a choral<br>cancer surgeon and a professor of<br>coloral surgery here at the University<br>of OT chuch he was the first professor<br>of coloral surgery in New Zealand in<br>2000 was head of this campus's<br>department of surgery for 13 years until<br>2019 and has been editor and chief of<br>the New Zealand medical journal since<br>2002 alongside numerous other fellowship<br>and advisory roles now Frank has<br>hundreds of Publications and<br>peer-reviewed journals to his name and<br>led breakthroughs and identifying<br>potential causes of non-hereditary bowel<br>cancer most recently he led the research<br>team which discovered links to Bow<br>cancer from a bacterial toxin carried in<br>the gut this discovery means that people<br>can be screened for the bug and perhaps<br>a life-saving vaccine um could be in the<br>offing um which would be a world first<br>um in the future he was also the first<br>surgeon in the country to start a<br>service for advanced pelvic malignancy<br>um he's been and continues to be a<br>strong public advocate for B cancer<br>screening um I know that from my days as<br>a television reporter I'd ring Frank and<br>he'd always be happy to to give us a<br>good quote for things like that he's<br>always been right behind it which is<br>wonderful um and he's also very much<br>cares about the safe delivery of<br>surgical treatment for new zealanders<br>and he's never shied away or speaking<br>out when he needs to if he feels that<br>Health Care delivery's being a bit<br>suboptimal which we could argue it is uh<br>perhaps in some areas right now can't we<br>um Frank services to health were<br>deservingly recognized recently with as<br>being named an officer of the New<br>Zealand order of mirit<br>fr<br>it's always difficult being the last<br>speaker in the series because by now<br>your minds will be getting a little bit<br>fuzzy and a little bit<br>tired one advantage of being the last<br>speaker of the series is that I've<br>actually added up the number of people<br>here and worked out that 10 of you will<br>have had Bale cancer or will get Bale<br>cancer in your lifetime if you're the<br>average n<br>gr that just brings it home this is a<br>real<br>thing I want you to just think for a<br>moment now and I want you just to<br>imagine that you're in that little room<br>where you can contemplate<br>things and as you stand up and look to<br>tidy up what you've done you see<br>this when you go away and then spend<br>some time on the internet and says what<br>does beding my bow and having diarrhea<br>what could be the<br>possibilities and inevitably after a<br>series of Investigations a you end up<br>with this a diagnosis of B<br>cancer and you can't help when you get<br>to this point but ask yourself the<br>question what did I do that gave me this<br>how did I end up with B<br>cancer I don't have the answer for that<br>but I've got some stories to tell which<br>hopefully might point in the right<br>direction but like many things of<br>science I can tell you what I think but<br>it's not always turns up of time to be<br>the truth it's just what my impression<br>of the truth as it is<br>today so there are many new zealanders<br>who have made their their Story of B<br>cancer public knowledge these are some<br>that have been in the media in the last<br>little while that have drawn attention<br>to the fact of what's happened to them d<br>hwood as you're probably well aware has<br>been very public about his situation at<br>the present time stage four B cancer Joe<br>McKenzie uh likewise was she passed away<br>a couple of weeks ago from Bell<br>cancer uh I don't think Richard<br>headley's been too too uh backward and<br>coming forward uh he stepped right up<br>and has has made it very public about<br>the experience he's got as have others<br>that are in this group<br>here so Bale cancer to give you an idea<br>kills more people in New Zealand each<br>year than breast cancer and prostate<br>cancer<br>combined B cancer kills five times the<br>number of people they die with motor<br>vehicle accidents each<br>year this is a worldwide problem this is<br>not just a new Zeal issue and these are<br>people that have had bow cancer that you<br>will know of the Queen Mother Audrey<br>hiitburn Ronald Reagan in fact I<br>colonoscope Ronald Reagan when I was in<br>the<br>States but the ze's always been very<br>proud of how it achieves things with<br>Australia well this is one thing we<br>shouldn't be that uh proud of we did<br>definitely up in the top group there<br>with Australia but what's really<br>interesting over the last 20 years we're<br>drifting down our Cancer's become not<br>so popular it's a bit like the All<br>Blacks not making it through the first<br>round of the World<br>Cup so these is a bit confusing this<br>graph behind you but the black lines<br>that go with with with bars on them that<br>is our incidence rate that's the rate of<br>Bale cancer per 100,000 and you can see<br>over the last 20 years that's been going<br>down the blue line going up is in fact<br>the total number of bow cancer cases in<br>the Z per year and it's increased<br>dramatically that's because our<br>population has increased and our aging<br>of our<br>population one thing that is different<br>though is that as their incidence rate<br>has fallen for the total population the<br>rate of B cancer in people under 50 has<br>increased now this is the next slide<br>which looks very similar to the last<br>slide but incidence one is the black<br>line so that's falling over the popula<br>over the whole population but the blue<br>line of those people under 50 and you<br>can see how dramatically this is taking<br>off in the last 20 years this is not a<br>New Zealand alone phenomena we've done a<br>study comparing Sweden Scotland and New<br>Zealand so New Zealand has overall a<br>decreasing rate Scotland has a very<br>stable rate of bowel cancer in the<br>population and Sweden has an increasing<br>rate as people return to their<br>original diets and in all populations<br>which have different Trends all have the<br>same in those under 50 increasing I feel<br>quite relieved I'm actually outside of<br>that age group as are I suspect most of<br>you so why do people get Bale cancer is<br>it just bad luck well there are some<br>risks there are some genetic inherited<br>conditions there are some chronic<br>inflammatory conditions but the vast<br>majority of cases are what we call<br>sporadic that means we don't have a clue<br>so is it just a random event I don't<br>think so things happen for reason and<br>this is what I want to talk about so<br>give you an example that this is not<br>bowel cancer this is stomach cancer so<br>stomach cancer has now been shown often<br>to be due to a bacteria called<br>helaa and this was put together by a<br>couple of Australians from Perth who no<br>one believed for the first 10 years of<br>their research they just keep getting<br>declined people wouldn't let them<br>present at their meetings they wouldn't<br>publish their papers eventually they got<br>the nail Bell prize for their<br>work so these these two here Barry<br>Marshall and Robin Warren they showed<br>that helaba causes gastric<br>cancer from Perth what they showed is<br>that you get an infection or you may<br>have an infection from a very young age<br>and over time that that causes an<br>inflammatory response that leads to a<br>genetic change<br>but over time the bacteria change in<br>your colon so by the time the cancer<br>comes the bacteria that started the<br>whole process have gone because the<br>wrong it's a wrong<br>environment luckily we have a researcher<br>here Jackie Keenan who is been involved<br>with a lot of research with with<br>helicobactor and when I started<br>proposing the concept that bow cancer<br>could be the same she draw drew my<br>attention to the fact that the that<br>helor has a first cousin that looks very<br>similar and and that's called<br>bacteroides fragiles and it makes a tox<br>some of it makes a toxin that's very<br>very similar and has similar effects so<br>we started studying this in more detail<br>and that's what really interesting is<br>that<br>Hela and has been around since we used<br>to live in groups of about a 100 people<br>so this is a really primitive bacteria<br>that lives inside us and we don't mount<br>an immune response so we can get about<br>and do its activities without our immune<br>system recognizing it's there<br>bides fragiles and as and helico are<br>very close in the way they behave they<br>both make a toxin and they both we don't<br>remount much of our immune response to<br>either what happens is early on the we<br>think that the bacteroid is fragil<br>starts starts a change makes a toxin<br>that that causes something called causes<br>some inflammation that leads to a<br>genetic change that with time and as you<br>see on this graph as the as a as a<br>bacteria the the bacteria that causes<br>the<br>difference causes the change and the it<br>makes the uh polyps that alters the the<br>mucus and it Alters the environment that<br>bacteria can live in so they die off and<br>different bacteria love that mucus and<br>necrotic thing of a Cancer and so they<br>come more localized there so we took a<br>group of people and looked at them 15<br>years later so they're all in their 40s<br>no family history normal colonoscopy<br>and we took we took biopsies of the<br>colon and put it away then we had some<br>earthquakes and other stuff to fill in<br>the time and then we got to the other<br>end and we went back and colonoscope<br>them again to see what happened what we<br>found that if you had this helaa if you<br>had this factorious fragiles entoto<br>toxin producing then you were very<br>likely to have a premalignant lesion and<br>if you didn't have it you weren't likely<br>to have<br>it now what we also found was that some<br>people got Bale cancer that didn't have<br>this bacteria and that got us thinking<br>and it wasn't until I was sitting in<br>Boston listening to a lecture about a<br>paper that was about to come out of<br>nature that I suddenly dawned on me that<br>we're thinking of bow cancer is wrong a<br>wrong way B cancer is not one disease<br>it's a accumulation of different cancers<br>that we recognize as one thing like<br>saying you got a car there's a big<br>difference between having a Lamborghini<br>and having a morus minor and Bell cancer<br>is the same you get some that grow big<br>and don't spread and some that start<br>from a small very small age spread<br>quickly so it's a variety of different<br>cancers they biologically quite<br>different and so we there's a<br>classification for molecular subtyping<br>of cancers and then we started looking<br>at this in regard to could this bacteria<br>caus one molecular subtype of B cancer<br>and that's where we we hit gold so to<br>speak we've also found other bacteria<br>now that seem to be linked to other<br>types molecular subtypes of Bale<br>cancer why the is important is that we<br>believe that the Lumen what's inside<br>your b as was talked about by Richard<br>that the feal matter has has these<br>bacteria in it then you have a lining<br>called a mucus layer which is like a<br>protection best way to think of it is<br>like having a big condom right through<br>your colon that stops what goes through<br>getting into the bow wall and causing<br>damage but that somewhere between the<br>toxins made by the sto and that bow wall<br>that something damages that mucous layer<br>something puts a hole in your condom and<br>the toxin gets<br>in so what we think happens is that some<br>foods make more toxin they drive it<br>that's red meat that is processed food<br>and that's particular some types of fat<br>they cause the the type of bacteria that<br>particularly<br>etbf uh we know that he really makes it<br>go crazy and make makes more toxin we<br>also know that other things turn off<br>that toxin production things like fiber<br>things like vegetables and<br>fruit that we've heard about so that's<br>how the mechanism but what we don't know<br>is what damages the mucus and that's<br>what we've been looking at lately so<br>what's really fascinating I'm sorry<br>about those people under 50 but the real<br>increase in those people under 50<br>getting bow cancer is really interesting<br>because it's different there an<br>alteration into the epidemiology means<br>there something happening in the the<br>environment that's driving this because<br>the risk factors for early onset B<br>cancer are not the same as late onset B<br>cancer this this is not driven by red<br>meat consumption and it's not driven by<br>by not eating your fiber these these<br>there's something fundamentally<br>different and we think the driver for<br>this is damage to the mucus that's<br>that's altering it so the toxins being<br>produced but now there's more holes in<br>the<br>condom so one one suggestion has been<br>that it's the sugary drinks and there's<br>a one paper out suggesting that that but<br>that was only in females they couldn't<br>prove it in males and I'm sure males<br>drink as many sugary drinks as females<br>so I have some doubt about that as a as<br>a as something that will stand<br>up we do also been looking at where the<br>microplastics might be because<br>microplastics work as a as a bridge<br>across that mucus layer and it could<br>well be the microplastics that are doing<br>this and we've just recently published a<br>paper suggesting that it could actually<br>be and you don't get a choice about<br>whether you choose microplastics you<br>don't go out and say I'll have some<br>microplastics with cream please it's<br>it's it's emic and everything you eat<br>you can't get away from it everything<br>you eat and everything you<br>drink and this would that would reflect<br>the way it is over the world this is not<br>a New Zealand issue this is a worldwide<br>issue so what do I think what I think at<br>the moment It's a combination of the<br>bugs the host and probably the host<br>mucus particularly and what you eat that<br>combin that comes together that drives<br>Bell<br>cancer thank<br>you just a just a question for Frank<br>before he sets down and we will have a<br>Q&amp;A in a second um with with the B<br>cancer um um with the younger with you<br>said microplastics we've heard talk<br>about um hormones being being pumped<br>into chickens we've heard about s of<br>selenium in our soils all sorts of<br>things over the years um and as you say<br>they're different than the younger and<br>the older patient um what's your gut<br>feeling what your got feeling about why<br>younger patients are coming to you more<br>and more well what do you think is is<br>there one key thing I I think what I<br>said that I think it's something's<br>damaging the mucus layer that if you you<br>see these young we're doing a we got<br>someone studying this at the moment and<br>we've got quite a big research project<br>looking at early on set B cancer and<br>we've also part of a large group of 56<br>hospitals around the world putting data<br>together to try and work this out and<br>it's not because more genetic abilities<br>have suddenly appeared in the world this<br>is an environmentally driven cancer so<br>something's changed in the environment<br>now when you start to look at the diet<br>of young people it's healthier than<br>people that are 30 now eat healthier<br>than I did when I was<br>30 so it's and you know there's less<br>alcohol consumed despite what you think<br>there's less tobacco smoked they<br>generally less red meat eaten Now by 30<br>and 40 year olds than there was by<br>generation before I remember working in<br>a shearing gang when I was young we used<br>to have some cold meat just was lying on<br>the tables we went out to do the first<br>run of the day and we'd have some cold<br>meat sandwiches we'd have meat for lunch<br>we'd have meat for afternoon tea and<br>sandwiches and we're bound to have meat<br>for dinner yeah so it's the whole world<br>is is changed now and it's sort of young<br>people don't consume that much red meat<br>and so all the conventional risk factors<br>have gone out so something's altered<br>that and we do not know what it<br>is obviously the proposal that<br>microplastics might be is a proposal we<br>don't know but there's a lot of<br>circumstantial data and we've now got a<br>a method how it might actually work but<br>it's still very early on on this it's<br>still you know it's a research paper<br>it's it's up for discussion not not<br>proven do you think there will be a<br>vaccine one day against well depends I<br>think there are other ways you might<br>deal with it but which involves some<br>genetic manipulation which is very<br>unpopular in New Zealand but we'll get<br>to<br>that all right right okay we've now<br>going to move on to a Q&amp;A session and<br>we'd like um questions from you guys you<br>must have some burning questions um to<br>think about I've got one to start the<br>panel off we're in an election cycle of<br>course very soon um we're going to be<br>bombarded with not only hoardings but<br>all sorts we're hearing all sorts of<br>political pictures for uh new policies<br>at the moment if you the three of you if<br>there was one policy in your particular<br>area of gut health you would love to<br>fight aura or the government to bring in<br>what would it be something to do with um<br>regulation in Foods maybe Katherine or<br>Frank screening or Richard what do you<br>think two thanks<br>um I'm not even sure going to vote for<br>the or anything else um so I mean to me<br>I think um uh optimizing people's<br>opportunity to eat fresh food simple<br>unprocessed food uh and making that<br>affordable um in some way I think that's<br>going to get back to the very basic<br>building blocks of where you would go<br>from there many different ways of doing<br>it I'm not going to say which one I<br>would in favor but but I think that<br>um is this one working<br>yeah um I think that to complement that<br>maybe um something more in the public<br>health space um I don't think there's a<br>lot of knowledge of what um healthy food<br>looks like and how to prepare it um so<br>something around that how how can we<br>educate more people um maybe in schools<br>maybe a nice Public Health campaign<br>instead of um advertising McDonald's not<br>a sugar tax or a limits on salt or<br>anything um well I mean is sugar really<br>evil or is artificial sweeteners evil<br>you<br>know that puts a lot of power into maybe<br>the food companies okay great I think<br>they got two quite be greedy intake<br>twice what you offered um one is I think<br>screening needs to move down I think<br>what we're using for screening at the<br>moment was based upon the way things<br>were the epidemiology of B cancer is<br>altered and we need to drive screening<br>down and so I think we need to be<br>screening the general population 45 and<br>groups to<br>40 so I think<br>secondly instead of just fencing at the<br>top which is what we're talking about<br>here we we need to do something about<br>how we treat cancer once it happens and<br>I think the present model does not work<br>we do not deliver as good of care as we<br>should and we should be thinking about<br>Comprehensive Cancer Centers like all<br>Australian states have already moved<br>there and we are a long way we're 20<br>years behind where the world is for<br>cancer treatment and it's about the<br>organization of that but that's beyond<br>food yeah it was a tough question but<br>you all answered it very well okay um<br>somebody yes uh Peter walk to Richard<br>um um please uh tell me how the gut uh<br>appetite yeah so I mean that's been the<br>Holy Grail clearly for uh for diet<br>companies and everyone else for a long<br>period of time so epti has got many<br>different ways of controlling it of of<br>controlling a lot of them are hormonal<br>um and uh and plays part of a role the<br>the the stomach itself doesn't have a<br>large microbial population as you<br>progress from the rectum proximately you<br>get fewer and fewer bacteria to the<br>point that Frank made earlier with helic<br>back to Polar is one of the few bacteria<br>that can that can live in the um in the<br>uh in the stomach in animal models where<br>you take mice that are genetically<br>predisposed to grow fat uh OB OB mice a<br>knockout mice if you um if you uh<br>transplant the microbiome of uh skinny<br>people into those mice they don't get<br>fed and vice versa so that would suggest<br>that the microbiome can directly<br>regulate either energy consumption<br>glucose metabolism those sorts of things<br>to do that now that's all good and well<br>but feal microbial transplant which is a<br>treatment for some conditions probably<br>isn't something that most people want to<br>go and do uh and for some things in life<br>it's better to give than receive um<br>maybe this is one of them I don't know<br>but but what I would say that that if<br>you think about the microbiome and ways<br>you can change it your microbiome is<br>pretty stable unless you throw a whole<br>lot of antibiotics at it you get a<br>significant change in diet so if you if<br>you change your diet significantly your<br>microbiome will change quickly but when<br>you stop that diet it will often go back<br>so the it's got a memory your microbiome<br>it will often flick back to to where it<br>was so I think that that um that uh fmt<br>is a as a treatment for various things<br>maybe something that that is done more<br>frequently in the future I've got<br>colleagues overseas who<br>give fmt via L tablets which are it's<br>all inside there or maybe it's something<br>in the microbiome that we can work out<br>what the secret factor is and then<br>distill that out and work it out but<br>with such complexity in the microbiome<br>with you more cells there more genes<br>than there are in the body getting to<br>that point can be challenging for<br>example in some donor studies on<br>inflammatory Bell disease some studies<br>are negative they go back and they look<br>at the donor and there's clearly some<br>super donors if you got the golden<br>donation uh you did much better than if<br>you if you got a donation from someone<br>else but they don't know what it is<br>about those people so so um so how does<br>the G change change appetite clearly the<br>microbiome has a role from that the<br>animal data I don't think people are<br>having microbiome transplants yet for<br>obesity they probably diet would be the<br>best starting point some of the new<br>drugs that are now on the market the<br>type two diabetes are being used as well<br>so there suppose evidence around that I<br>me um did Frank or cine did you have<br>that about that those drugs you know we<br>hear a lot about OIC this OIC drug that<br>all of Hollywood's on and what have you<br>anyone<br>um I'll just comment that you know the<br>the drug works by making people feel<br>nauseated and really full and sick and<br>that that sounds really unpleasant and<br>that if you eating um to enjoy at least<br>some of your food that that would take<br>all the joy out of eating and you know<br>that that is also part<br>health comment on this not be interesed<br>what the panelist thing but I had I have<br>a daughter that lives in O she rang me<br>up she was PR some antibiotics and she<br>says when long got the antibiotics that<br>cost $5 and the pharmacy tried to sell<br>me something called probiotics for and<br>they wanted<br>$75 for that<br>no my impression of probiotics is that<br>that for most of the time that we get<br>this your your own gut will correct it<br>we've done studies looking at probiotics<br>to see whether Carri just return to B<br>habit after colonoscopy that me you know<br>basically colonoscopy you've EMP the<br> out and new is forming and<br>making sure you get the ship that you<br>had before um and so that that sort of<br>happens and the idea was that probiotics<br>might get you back to the normal food<br>that you had but it made no difference<br>and uh so I always I left more we looked<br>at this and we looked at it for<br>diabetical disease and a few other<br>things to see what made any difference<br>it<br>doesn't there may be a roll for it but<br>you have to remove the colon for it to<br>have a roll so people have pouches had<br>the remove maybe a but in I don't think<br>think<br>I mean the probiotic thing I think<br>is I mean I think it's it's such a good<br>story and if it was true it just be<br>wonderful it yeah no no no so so the<br>problem also is that people say I'm on<br>probiotics you know that's good that's<br>not saying I drive a car is it a<br>Lamborghini or is it you know they're<br>all different they're all completely<br>different bacteria and while they've all<br>got the same characteristics and that<br>they can go through your gut to the<br>colon and do those things I of people<br>you need to do a n equals one trial<br>because there'll be no because there's<br>no pharmaceutical money behind it<br>they'll never do a proper clinical trial<br>so what you have to do is you have to<br>take them for a while see if you're<br>better stop them see if you're worse<br>take them again see if you're better and<br>if very clearly there's a temporal<br>relationship for you that you feel<br>better on them then you should take them<br>but you shouldn't just take them because<br>they sound like the right thing to do so<br>I think it's like lot lots of things in<br>medicine we don't have most any evidence<br>for most for a lot of things in medicine<br>that are not not sort of in main core<br>medicine I always say to people it<br>doesn't mean they don't work it just<br>means that you need to be very careful<br>about you contining to take things<br>because they say well could they do any<br>har well we don't know could they do any<br>har they hurt your wallet so you they're<br>expensive so you got to think about all<br>of that together I think before you<br>commit<br>something looking at the numbers the<br>trillions of bacteria in the colon in<br>the old 50,000 bacteria they come with<br>the probotics or<br>whatever my thoughts are my calculations<br>are it's a bit like getting in the sea<br>and having a p and expecting the sea to<br>change to to<br>happen hi it's Katherine yeah hi<br>Katherine louisy when you were showing<br>your um fruit and vegetables and you had<br>grains in there as well and<br>legumes I've always been brought up that<br>you eat a wide variety my mother lived<br>to 98 she drove to 96 so that's good<br>Testament but these diets like keto<br>where they take out all your<br>it yeah I think that's a um interesting<br>question a lot of um Fair so keto<br>involve is one of those um they're all<br>focused on taking out a lot of things<br>and really stripping back the diet to a<br>few number of foods and what we know is<br>that when um we have a really diverse<br>and varied diet that that promotes a<br>more diverse and varied gut microbiome<br>and as Richard mentioned um when you<br>have a significant change in diet you<br>have a significant change in microbiome<br>and a lot of the um diets that are<br>really protein heavy um change the<br>composition of the gut microbiome to one<br>that is more associated with an with an<br>pro-inflammatory<br>profile and so there hasn't been a lot<br>of research on um on keto but if we take<br>what we do know it may be helpful for<br>temporary weight loss because any diet<br>that um that is designed for weight loss<br>will resolve in weight loss if you<br>follow it um but it may be having<br>long-term consequences on on other<br>health so variety spice of life y a<br>everything I think the side effects<br>probably of um the keto diet longterm uh<br>tricky too as this gentlemen oh sorry<br>you you go first Madam um part of my<br>question's been answered was about<br>probiotics fermented food was the rest<br>of it kombuchas Keers cell<br>krauts just repeat that question<br>again so the question was about<br>fermented foods and do they have a role<br>in promoting heal kind of similar to<br>your probiotics fermented foods um have<br>specific strains of bacteria that<br>um uh grow and during that fermentation<br>process so when we have a look at the<br>gut microbiomes of people who say have<br>been drinking a lot of cafa we see that<br>cafair bacteria in their gut<br>microbiome so it does the um strains in<br>the in the fermented foods will<br>establish themselves in your gut if you<br>continue to eat<br>them um and there have been some studies<br>looking at when you have large amounts<br>of fermented foods um can that help to<br>reduce inflammation say inflammatory<br>bowel disease and there are some studies<br>that are suggesting that that might<br>happen but kind of similar to um eating<br>a variety of foods I think we're going<br>to get more benefits if we eat a variety<br>of fermented foods so previously kind of<br>every culture had a fermented food that<br>characterized it whereas now we have<br>access to a whole range of different<br>fermented foods from many different<br>cultures um and so I think that if we<br>can Embrace some of those into our every<br>day diet that may actually give us more<br>health benefits um and also they taste<br>really<br>good and I'm all about you know flavor<br>of food and enjoying food um but they<br>can have side effects so if you eat um a<br>lot of one particular fermented food<br>then you may get um bloating and<br>discomfort so like anything like a<br>little bit of lots of different things<br>gut we just r running out of time just<br>as gentlemen right in the middle of the<br>middle there because you've had your<br>hand up a while just a very final quick<br>question and don't uh forget that um you<br>can come down and ask questions<br>afterwards if you've got a burning<br>issue um have there been any studies on<br>whether or not sedentary behavior is<br>linked with gut<br>health it's a difficult one to tease<br>apart because if you think about uh an<br>urbanized life people doing office jobs<br>and it's you don't just get one of those<br>variables without many of the other<br>variables that you get with<br>westernization if you compare exercise<br>versus no exercise for um for uh<br>inflammatory Bell disease and other<br>things like that I don't think there's a<br>signal there but again it's really hard<br>to tease that because people who<br>exercise tend to also have other habits<br>that may be seen to be healthy so I<br>think it's hard to tease it apart so I<br>think sedentary LIF s probably goes with<br>changing diet changing a whole range of<br>things interestingly when I when I did<br>my pH years ago we looked at<br>inflammatory Bell disease having a<br>vegetable garden at home was protective<br>and childhood if had a vegetable garden<br>you can say well why was that well maybe<br>that you had a house that had a garden<br>so you're outside more you running<br>around more you were in the dirt W maybe<br>it was what you ate so it is very hard<br>to tease many environmental factors<br>apart one of the only ways to do it is<br>with a prospective study so if we got<br>everyone in canbury age zero and<br>measured everything on them then watch<br>what happened over their lifetime maybe<br>we work out some things over time but<br>they're very difficult studies to do<br>those so this is a great one in Christ<br>Church based here at the school that I<br>think they spoke on last last last last<br>session but um those days are hard to do<br>but I mean there are other things that<br>are bad for a syy lifestyle with regards<br>to cardiovascular health and and<br>certainly exercise can change a<br>microbiome but whether we know if it's<br>for the benit for the good or bad I<br>sure um I'll just add to that um we do<br>know that activity um and excise exer is<br>really good for helping the gut to move<br>um and so if someone's suffering from<br>constipation um would be promoting daily<br>walks if you're suffering from bloating<br>sometimes that movement can help just to<br>move the gas out um so from a gut<br>function perspective activity um is is<br>an important part of um having optimal<br>gut function um but yeah and nothing<br>else in terms of what<br>Rich yeah definitely there's some<br>evidence out there for B cancer that<br>being active reduces your rate of<br>getting B cancer but as Richard implied<br>that there is um it's hard to to<br>separate it from other factors because<br>people that exercise regularly have a<br>healthy diet Etc but there is some<br>belief that uh and also uh when you're<br>more overweight you your out comes of<br>for so you're more likely to get it more<br>likely to do worse so there is but the<br>separate that out as Bridget said you<br>need need a perspective study but from<br>what we know retrospec yes but there's<br>also a real Wellness type Factor just<br>moving away from all this the exercise<br>definitely makes people feel feel better<br>helps all right um we could probably go<br>on but we're going to have to hold for<br>um for time um sorry madam you may like<br>to come down just afterwards and ask a<br>quick question but we need to wrap it up<br>there for time reasons um just to<br>mention you'll have noticed that this is<br>being filmed uh this talk will be up on<br>our University of otago Christ j website<br>in about a week or so um alongside our<br>other three talks which are already up<br>there the first one was on Aging well<br>the second one on medicine and surgery<br>of the future and the third one a for<br>night ago was on adolescent health and<br>raising mentally resilient teens so just<br>a reminder if you had somebody who<br>couldn't make it tonight um give it<br>about a week and um the production team<br>will have given us a video we'll have it<br>up there and you can enjoy it and share<br>it around um that's what we've got time<br>for as I say the the panel will be here<br>for a little bit um but thank you all<br>very much for coming now Mii kak ano um<br>stay well and safe thank<br>you</p></main><footer style="margin-top: 2rem; background: #0001; padding: 2rem; text-align: center;"><p>We Are The University</p><ul style="list-style-type: none; padding: 0;
