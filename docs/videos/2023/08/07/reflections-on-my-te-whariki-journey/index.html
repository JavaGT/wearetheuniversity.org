make<br>a short recording about some of my<br>experiences with the Friday key<br>Journey began back at the beginning when<br>I was part of The Advisory Group for the<br>draft to fightiki<br>much later I became a member of the<br>reference group for the New Zealand<br>curriculum that was published in 2007<br>and I was one of the writers for the<br>update of tafariki 2017.<br>currently I'm a member of the curriculum<br>voices group for the refresh of the New<br>Zealand School curriculum bringing an<br>early childhood perspective to that work<br>and I'm part of the quality whakapai<br>maths team<br>as we all know and are celebrating today<br>was launched in 1993 in draft form<br>and published in final form in 1996<br>being New Zealand's first Early<br>Childhood curriculum<br>as we know the Early Childhood<br>curriculum was envisaged as a Friday key<br>a woven mat with the principal strands<br>and goals providing the framework for<br>diverse settings to weave their<br>curriculum<br>in 2007 when the school curriculum was<br>Rewritten we were really Keen to ensure<br>there were strong links with definiki<br>at that time it was decided that the<br>best way to do this was to show the<br>alignment between the strands of<br>tafadiki<br>and the key competencies at school<br>this diagram comes from the school<br>curriculum document<br>as many of you will know much of my work<br>has been around the transition to school<br>and although this alignment was<br>promising in practice it didn't always<br>work terribly well<br>I ended up drawing this which was<br>showing that the alignment provided a<br>potential bridge between the two<br>documents but the strength really<br>depended on the connections being made<br>by teachers both early childhood and<br>school teachers<br>they were the ones building the bridge<br>in 2017 when to fightiki was updated<br>the principal strands and the vision<br>remained the same<br>it also remained a bicultural and<br>bilingual document<br>with the two pathways<br>however you will have noticed that the<br>the Friday key diagram was changed<br>as it notes in the document the coffee<br>symbolizes the start of a journey that<br>will take the traveler Beyond the<br>Horizon<br>it's still a weaving of principles and<br>strands but look somewhat different<br>this was actually an exciting<br>development<br>now when the documents opened at the<br>place where the two parts of the book<br>meet it can be seen that the Friday key<br>is unfinished with the loose strands<br>still to be woven<br>this acknowledges the child's potential<br>and their ongoing educational Journey<br>and makes linking Early Childhood to<br>school much easier<br>the new opening to tafari provides a<br>very different metaphor for continuity<br>to what we had previously now it's seen<br>that new learning is woven into the<br>existing fighter key rather than a<br>bridge needing to be provided between<br>tafadiki and the New Zealand curriculum<br>there's greater recognition that the<br>Realms of mana and the five strands of<br>tafariki are a basis for Learning and<br>relevant across the lifespan something<br>that personally I feel very passionate<br>about<br>so when we think about connecting Early<br>Childhood to school definiki has a<br>section on Pathways where tables are<br>provided to show some of the ways in<br>which the key competencies values and<br>learning areas of the New Zealand<br>curriculum can be woven onto the<br>learning outcomes of defiliki the tables<br>also show the weaving on for the Maori<br>these tables serve as a starting place<br>for exploring curriculum Connections in<br>more depth and are intended for both<br>here's an example from one of the tables<br>this one being for the Strand belonging<br>manafenora you can see on one side the<br>learning outcomes in the middle and<br>acknowledgment of the weaving<br>and then examples from the New Zealand<br>curriculum that might be woven on to<br>belonging<br>you can see not only the key competency<br>participating in contributing but also<br>learning areas of social sciences and<br>science<br>these tables are not intended to be<br>exhaustive but just a place that<br>with 2017 Safari key much more support<br>was provided online<br>I've shown here the pathways and<br>transitions section which I was part of<br>developing and there are lots of<br>resources there for making those<br>connections<br>for the first time in 2017 to fight a<br>tki website with lots of other resources<br>and now we find ourselves moving to a<br>refresh of the New Zealand School<br>curriculum<br>tomato will be released in term three<br>there's already three refreshed learning<br>areas<br>and other ones to be developed<br>it's really important I think that those<br>of us in early childhood are aware of<br>and connected to and potentially giving<br>feedback on the school curriculum<br>here's the draft which is available<br>online<br>it's a very different document to the<br>current nzc and well worth exploring in<br>some depth<br>you can see here although this the text<br>might be a bit small to read the<br>whakapapa of time<br>it shows the diagram and all the pieces<br>and as well worth going online and<br>exploring<br>this is also a page from the to my tire<br>Hall<br>acknowledging early childhood<br>as a beginning with children being<br>confident and curious learners<br>and then through the phases of the<br>curriculum<br>it will be interesting to see<br>whether I went to mataya is in final<br>form<br>whether the the tables into fightiki<br>need updating or whether they still work<br>given that the learning areas and the<br>key competencies will still be there in<br>it's an exciting time in education and<br>not only do we have the new school<br>curriculum there's also the gazetting of<br>tofadiki<br>so in April this year there was a new<br>notice about the parts of tafariki that<br>are now mandatory and this now includes<br>the learning outcomes<br>if you go online and explore you will<br>see that centers are required to meet<br>this new standards in May next year<br>there's quite a lot of thinking to do<br>about which document or which part of<br>also at this moment in time we're<br>exploring the common practice model<br>which was released in draft form<br>recently<br>you can see here that to Friday key is<br>referenced alongside the New Zealand<br>curriculum as being part of the what to<br>teach and the common practice model<br>the actual document here the common<br>practice model<br>doesn't say a lot about early childhood<br>and that's because for us<br>the common practice model really will<br>come through in the call fittifaka Pi<br>resources<br>so you can see here a note from the<br>online materials saying that we're<br>working with kayako on call fittifaka<br>pie to strengthen formative assessment<br>and teaching practice for foundational<br>learning into Friday key<br>so the common practice model will guide<br>teaching and learning appropriate at<br>different phases of learning with<br>different components such as coffee<br>whakapai for early learning<br>that are to be within the bicultural<br>inclusive and holistic framework of<br>so where to from here 30 years on<br>I'd love to be with you and able to<br>discuss some of these ideas and points<br>and other things that I'm sure have come<br>up through the day<br>but I wanted to finish with a few<br>questions to ponder on<br>what might the changes to the school<br>curriculum mean for links with to Friday<br>key<br>are we ready for the May 2024 changes<br>arising from the gazetting of tafadiki's<br>learning outcomes<br>and how will the coffee pie resources be<br>embedded into the Friday key<br>I hope you have some good discussions<br>and I look forward to talking with some<br>of you some more about these issues and</p></main><footer
