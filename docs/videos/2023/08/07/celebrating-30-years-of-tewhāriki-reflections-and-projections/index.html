This was not imagined when the University of Waikato, on behalf of Margaret Carr and I, negotiated a contract during 1991 with the Ministry of Education to develop national early childhood curriculum guidelines.<br><br>The idea of such guidelines was not something the early childhood sector wanted. Moreover, the long and difficult negotiations with the Ministry were challenging because, in collaboration with the Kohanga Reo Trust, we proposed a bicultural framework. There were no curriculum blueprints to follow, and the likelihood of the document that became Te Whāriki gaining ECE cross-sector approval and political sign-off was not assured.<br><br>But here we are! My 'Journeys with Te Whāriki' include stories of the people, pedagogy, research and politics, including the crossing of geographic and school sector borders.</p><h2>Transcript</h2><p style="opacity:

education in New Zealand and<br>worldwide<br>during Helens and Margaret Margaret's<br>early curriculum development work they<br>may not have any such 30 Years<br>celebration of Stephanie kidraft<br>yet here we are today gathered to<br>celebrate this 30th anniversary<br>is entitled Journeys with the fariki<br>1990s<br>yes sorry we've been um recorded twice<br>greetings everybody and thank you for<br>the very warm welcome<br>um<br>30 years is a long time and so it is<br>almost unmanageable so this is a seminar<br>about the party key but my presentation<br>on Journeys with tahaliki has a<br>diversionary introduction now we seem to<br>have<br>I don't want that on at all I want both<br>should we click this<br>padded<br>so I want to<br>um slideshow<br>yeah so the problem we're having what's<br>happened for some reason the audio is<br>doubling<br>um<br>apologies for this so we thought right<br>okay<br>because we can abandon<br>it just helps us speak directly through<br>cool this is nerve-wracking<br>is the yes<br>so can I start<br>all right so well I was going to say<br>that my Journeys with Farley key have a<br>diversionary introduction<br>um and we've already been diversioned<br>once by technology but I've got I want<br>to put on my historian's hat here and<br>possibly a reminder that jafarlik is<br>only a capsule in time and created out<br>of the rich traditions of earlier of<br>Early Education from the past<br>and I pers I have a large collection of<br>historical images of young children<br>actually I understand there's still one<br>or two sitting up in the corridors up<br>and up there which I put up many many<br>years ago<br>um but I've I've got 18 19th century<br>etchings and photographs from the late<br>19th century however art is very rare<br>almost non-existent<br>and I want to show you three paintings<br>from earlier times in a montage of<br>photos and this painting that I've put<br>up here is it's unveiling I bid for it<br>in an auction about six weeks ago<br>sitting in lassan at the opposite end of<br>the country online to a Dunbar Sloan<br>auction and I got it unseen<br>but I just looked at that and that is<br>the title of a kindergarten playgrounds<br>there is no other painting I am aware of<br>in this country that depicts has chosen<br>to depict a kindergarten place as the<br>what the artist wants the artist was in<br>aucklander<br>um quite well known in her time for<br>watercolors of coastal scenes around<br>Auckland and bunches of flowers<br>beautiful Bunches of flowers and there<br>were several levels of beers in the<br>auction I tried to find out from the<br>estate that it came from a little bit<br>more information but have not been<br>successful<br>the unfortunately there was somebody<br>bidding against me and I hope it wasn't<br>somebody in this room<br>I didn't tell anybody there were several<br>people I really wanted to tell but I<br>found and I thought no they might want<br>it<br>but somebody did and I had to pay a bit<br>more than I expected but it wasn't<br>outrageous<br>so this is an interesting painting here<br>I believe it is an Auckland kindergarten<br>but I cannot work out which one I<br>believe it's 1950s looking at the or<br>late 1940s it's no later I don't believe<br>but if you look at the equipment there<br>you look at the dress of the children<br>there<br>um I think that's what states it the um<br>I think it's um I think the painting<br>itself is I I've had a look at a at a<br>photograph album I have of Auckland<br>kindergartens in 1949 the coal growth<br>Constance Coral Grove got given and a<br>photograph album which had um<br>since the photographs of every<br>kindergarten and operation at that time<br>about 12 of them so it wasn't a minute<br>and the architecture doesn't quite match<br>it because that is not purpose-built I<br>don't believe but it has a veranda and<br>not many people were purpose-building<br>kindergartens at that stage but I can't<br>haven't yet found it but I will keep<br>keep hunting because I would like to be<br>able to name the kindergarten and<br>probably it will depend where it<br>eventually goes because although I'm<br>having it on my wall for a while I think<br>it should go somewhere else at some<br>stage but this image is rich in<br>curriculum symbols many of which what<br>you could see embedded into far leaky<br>but there are key aspects of tafarliki<br>which are not apparent here but it's a<br>wonderful characterization of the<br>possibilities of outdoor play<br>cooperation between children and<br>non-interfering teacher which I think is<br>delightful here there's not a whiff of<br>intentional teaching here at all<br>oh the intention is that the play<br>materials are the curriculum so this is<br>it's official unveiling<br>um and I've actually got it at a an art<br>um curator Hazard at present who's going<br>to reframe it because it wasn't the<br>framing and everything was in very poor<br>condition but I was very nervous coming<br>back to New Zealand to see it because I<br>had bid for it unseen and you don't go<br>bidding for paintings unsee so this is<br>this is my find<br>but here's another one<br>some of you who have a school background<br>May recognize the book fair<br>it's got a very interesting Hamilton<br>Connection painted by Dora Rydal who<br>spent many many weeks in Fairfield<br>infant classroom as it was called at the<br>time to draw the paint the pictures the<br>images that would go in the little<br>reader the first ready to read reader<br>called going to school and she did a<br>couple of those very first books the<br>very first New Zealand aotearoa reading<br>books for very young children in the<br>country<br>and she just didn't do it out of her<br>imagination she did this from live<br>images of children<br>the her the daughter of Dora Rydell<br>actually is Anne Smith<br>um and so that that is another rather<br>nice connection<br>but the first decade of my career was<br>spent as a junior school teacher in<br>different times at the tail end of a<br>progressive era where we enacted the<br>belief in our Junior classrooms that<br>children learn through play and<br>Discovery and it was deemed such an<br>important aspect of the Junior School<br>curriculum it is what we did when the<br>children arrived at school right through<br>at least till morning tea time by the<br>end of my teaching time I ran an all-day<br>play activity classroom and the children<br>learned to read they lent their numbers<br>in amidst at all<br>um<br>but it was about laying it was seen to<br>lay the social and intellectual<br>foundations for the day's activities and<br>it celebrated in the government's<br>reading book of going to school it's<br>playful and again there is no teacher in<br>sight which is I freaking find quite<br>interesting on some other Pages the<br>teacher is there but in you're in this<br>it actually was quite controversial<br>because this was she painted about 1959<br>I think<br>um<br>or I've said 1960 here and when it was<br>released the books were released a<br>number of classes still actually weren't<br>operating there classes like this and so<br>there was a lot of debate as to the<br>mismatch between what was happening in<br>some classes and what was supposed to be<br>happening but this was supposed this was<br>Junior School teaching<br>now I'm going to return<br>um I showed this image several years ago<br>at a at an nzdi Ministry Hui on<br>celebrating curriculum taking to far<br>leaky to school was the name of my<br>presentation and I'm going to return to<br>this later but the playfulness has been<br>lost<br>um for several decades but is in a way<br>being rediscovered<br>um<br>my third image<br>I had recently been appointed as<br>professor at Victoria University<br>and I was having a holiday in Nelson and<br>went to an art exhibition and saw this<br>painting<br>ever I didn't care what it cost it cost<br>me a thousand dollars I didn't care what<br>fund that was going to come out so it<br>came out of my purse first but<br>eventually Victoria University paid for<br>it and unfortunately when I left<br>Victoria University I had to leave it<br>there and I was but it is up on the wall<br>at Victoria University but this there is<br>an oil version of this painting um which<br>was owned by Judith Duncan the late June<br>of Duncan but here we have this<br>wonderful image of the creative arts<br>again no adults in sight<br>serious art the children are serious<br>artists<br>um and so it all says something about<br>curriculum prior to tavarlik<br>my final set of images is a collection<br>of photographs the Auckland kindergarten<br>Association in the 1970s 80s put<br>together a sort of a training collection<br>of slides and I've been through them and<br>I've just pulled out the Slime a<br>sampling of the slides on their outdoor<br>play prior to tafarlinki this is a<br>delightful wildness the paint's off the<br>paper<br>it's on the windows it's on the walls<br>the water's everywhere the children are<br>climbing on everything there is no<br>safety plan here<br>oh<br>there's a riot of color and junk in an<br>environment<br>and the environment has continually<br>changing the view was that children<br>should have control of their environment<br>what's too far like he needed if this<br>was going on why did we need to follow<br>linky I wondered whether these children<br>were having a lot more independent fun<br>than what we now allow children the<br>adults are mainly absent I did actually<br>find I think there is an adult sort of<br>in the background of one photo down<br>there but they certainly were not<br>the curriculum was being enacted through<br>the environment and its materials<br>not that the teachers were not busy but<br>one of the things that tafar aliki did<br>do has done is reposition the role of<br>teachers and I'm particularly so in the<br>refreshed version but like these like<br>the fariki these images just capture a<br>capsule in time<br>of Early Education a snapshot of<br>curriculum and action and while tafar<br>league is capsule stretches over 30<br>years and has been enacted across a much<br>wider stage and very diverse settings<br>there is still a before curriculum<br>before tafar leaky curriculum story and<br>we shouldn't forget it and we have still<br>yet to write the post to fardiki<br>curriculum story and I think we it is<br>probably time to start thinking what<br>that might be and who's gonna whose pen<br>is going to do it because it will happen<br>at some point<br>but my first version has ended and so<br>let's start the type of Reiki Journey<br>these got added in once I got my<br>painting you see<br>so officially<br>Journeys with Jafar leaky for my journey<br>I have not got any new slides I decided<br>to call slides from the many many<br>presentations I have done that<br>illustrate some of the significant<br>signposts in this journey and it's a<br>privilege again to be speaking at the<br>University of waikato it is the<br>birthplace of where tafariki<br>um 31 years ago over several days where<br>it was basically burst<br>with the curriculum working group<br>those about four days I think it was the<br>four principles and the broad framework<br>of Mana was determined at that point<br>now there have been many Frontiers in<br>the and many Footsteps in this tafariki<br>journey<br>including all of you here<br>and I think I would have to say you have<br>stepped far more what steps than I have<br>done and so I see this as a collective<br>Journey but this presentation is just<br>weaving my sort of little way through it<br>I was at Ground Zero<br>for the birth but after its release I<br>have not been a Frontline soldier of<br>defiliki I have been involved in teacher<br>education but I wasn't really teaching<br>curriculum courses I was mainly doing<br>history and policy<br>I have been a researcher for a short<br>while I've tended to Chronicle the story<br>be a policy voice do some of the<br>international work<br>but<br>in the follow-on presentation today in<br>the later presentations I think we'll<br>see a much broader weaving of the<br>various Journeys up to Farley King<br>now<br>this<br>the next step in our journey having the<br>curriculum group here at waikato I don't<br>um and we came out with that very broad<br>framework was to sell the idea then<br>elaborate well what might this mean in<br>practice we didn't know at that stage<br>now the notion of a weaving with many<br>possible patterns had been mooted by<br>Margaret she was using the terms warp<br>and weft at the time in a European<br>fashion and it was tomity he said this<br>has got to be afarliki<br>and it happened at that stage<br>and<br>this was the overhead transparency which<br>we were using in those days that I put<br>together to illustrate the idea<br>this was not by that stage we knew a<br>curriculum where one size fits all the<br>notion was this notion was extremely<br>difficult to negotiate with the Ministry<br>of Education<br>but it was a weaving and this has become<br>a very long journey but 30 years on<br>we're still weaving it<br>in new colors patterns but at some stage<br>again I say there has to probably start<br>a new weaving<br>an ish at issue and at post to far leaky<br>times will we who weaves it but we can<br>see in this image here I've got the free<br>and this was<br>um I might do a different collection of<br>images if I was doing it now but that's<br>this personal Journey with tafariki<br>has<br>um with Jafar aliki of Margaret and<br>myself<br>is just one of many but it's a set<br>alongside a much why other people and a<br>much wider reaction and I've just quoted<br>and Smith who's one of many many people<br>who made really interesting and great<br>statements about tafariki she's been a<br>great friend of mine but more<br>particularly she was one of the key<br>Advocates and supporter of tafariki from<br>the start<br>and part of the survival in those early<br>years of tafariki in difficult political<br>times was due to people like am<br>who in various high-level policy forums<br>defended it against opposition<br>so quite rightly to faridiki has been<br>the Catalyst to Lively debate new<br>conversations and new research which in<br>so before I unpack my journey a bit<br>further I'm going to take another bit of<br>a diversion because I want to<br>acknowledge this place and its people<br>which to me is part of my defaulty<br>journey<br>10 years ago I spoke at the opening of<br>your research center at the invitation<br>of Margaret and acknowledge the<br>beginnings of my academic Journey<br>that began as Hamilton Teachers College<br>in the 19 mid 1980s when the world was<br>changing for early childhood education<br>and there's some people I can see here a<br>few who were part of that change<br>Child Care was transferring into<br>education I had come out of the world of<br>child care battles which are still<br>ongoing<br>a three-year qualification for early<br>childhood education had just been won<br>not just for kindergarten which should<br>be battling for years but to include<br>Child Care the before five policies were<br>being formulated not to get released<br>and they were about equity for children<br>under five and opportunities for women<br>so these were very heady times and I<br>spoke about those at this that was my<br>front slide<br>now<br>some years later<br>I wrote about my arrival to Hamilton<br>Teachers College the occasion of writing<br>this and I've included a short statement<br>from it and I'm going to read that<br>statement<br>um was when the Department of Education<br>at Victoria University was demised and<br>merged with Hamilton with Wellington<br>College of Education now as you can<br>imagine people have been through these<br>things there were a lot of sensitivities<br>and so the um<br>Wellington the Victoria called faculty<br>of Education published a book and<br>invited some of the people who had been<br>part of that faculty to write a chapter<br>and so I wrote a chapter and I called it<br>my unlikely career because I began as a<br>junior school teacher that I would<br>finish up and you know as a professor<br>was not foreseen and wrote the story and<br>part of the story I wrote was about<br>coming here to waikato well to Hamilton<br>teaches college and I'm going to read<br>you what I wrote it was in 1987 I had a<br>one-year-old daughter then and I met a<br>scholarly soul mate and I wish Margaret<br>was here I would be able to we would<br>both grin at each other a kindergarten<br>teacher Margaret Carr also recently<br>appointed to Hamilton Teachers College<br>win the three-year Early Childhood<br>qualification was introduced in<br>something akin to Aku<br>she and I we took the lead abandoned the<br>ethos of the existing kindergarten<br>qualification lifted out basically and<br>created a qualification with strong<br>political pedagogical and bicultural<br>underpinnings the result was a<br>standalone Early Childhood degree<br>outside the realm of teacher primary<br>teacher training influence and that's<br>part of the story and in this degree I<br>established a paper on the history and<br>philosophy of Early Childhood that<br>became the Forerunner of discovery of<br>Early Childhood it was from teaching<br>that course I thought we've got a book<br>here and my students did such a lot of<br>work finding the material<br>and it combined my scholarly interests<br>political Endeavors and this course<br>because this became the Catalyst for<br>many of my books that followed when I<br>applied for the job which was advertised<br>at Hamilton Teachers College the year<br>after Margaret I was given instructions<br>from a colleague at the University who<br>was going to referee me his name was<br>David Mitchell<br>and he said to me his advice<br>do not mention that you are writing a<br>doctorate that will not do you any<br>favors this is Hamilton Teachers College<br>do not mention that you worked in child<br>care that will do you no favors at all<br>because the college here only did<br>Kindergarten talk about being a primary<br>school teacher<br>do not on any condition mention that<br>you've been involved with the Union<br>and so with most of my credentials off<br>the shelf I went along<br>I did not realize that Marisol walk and<br>some of you may remember her she became<br>the first CEO of the Ministry of<br>Education but at that stage was working<br>in the Auckland education board as a<br>senior person in this new<br>shift of child care into education<br>she had given riding instructions to the<br>senior inspector who in those days used<br>to sit on all the interviews for people<br>being getting a job and a teacher's<br>college so the senior inspector was<br>sitting there one of about eight men<br>there were no women in the interview<br>there was no Early Childhood person in<br>the interview anyway they must have<br>taken note and I got appointed<br>now this was not an easy beginning for<br>Margaret or myself because she had been<br>appointed the year before as the very<br>first kindergarten teacher into their<br>kindergarten training program it it<br>didn't have kindergarten teachers<br>running it before then so so we sort of<br>teamed up we felt like we were two<br>so when Margaret and I were here in our<br>junior staff positions The Early<br>Childhood Program was significantly<br>framed by the school subjects so you had<br>Early Childhood maths Early Childhood<br>music Early Childhood art Early<br>Childhood science those were the courses<br>and within the Early Childhood courses<br>there weren't very many there were they<br>were framed by the activity so I used to<br>run a course that had three weeks on<br>water play two weeks on blocks one week<br>on um<br>jigsaw wasn't on and on it went<br>so we had the opportunity to create new<br>spaces for early childhood education<br>within a university education<br>institution because we were merging<br>it was Prem the Department of Education<br>as were most in New Zealand were framed<br>around psychology and Child Development<br>there was no early childhood education<br>much so to speak unless it was in that<br>paradigm<br>these waikato Hamilton Teachers College<br>initiatives where the trial runs for us<br>for what became tavariki<br>that shifting the Paradigm even within a<br>university context it was possible we<br>did it<br>that invading and colonizing protected<br>tertiary spaces could be achieved here<br>anyway and I was fortunate at the timing<br>of my academic career to be on a wave<br>that made this possible for me here then<br>at Victoria then at otago<br>sadly the landscape has shifted in<br>recent times and the spaces that we<br>created are being closed and removed<br>but my tafari key journey is absolutely<br>embedded alongside this journey of early<br>childhood education into Academia<br>now here at waikato is also where I<br>forged some long-term academic<br>Partnerships and friendships I want to<br>pay tribute to and my great colleague<br>Sue Middleton who some of you might<br>recognize here are three of those images<br>we had a bit of a catch up yesterday we<br>keep in touch<br>but Sue Middleton was working on her<br>doctorate and was the only female<br>academic in the Department of Education<br>it was some years later that these<br>pictures were taken as us young things<br>as we were then were unbeknown to us<br>then actually climbing the professorial<br>ladder but no one then would have<br>believed it or predicted that it was<br>possible and probably we didn't either<br>but we did it but if you look there<br>there's Alison Jones hey Morris Matthews<br>Jane Ritchie myself and Sumer daughter<br>and our publisher<br>or<br>as our young thing sort of publishing<br>our early work<br>um which was supported hugely here at<br>so let's go back to the tafar aliki<br>journey<br>we don't have much of a pictorial record<br>of the process and it is such a shame<br>but alongside Consulting with and<br>selling the idea of tafariki with the<br>sector<br>the most important group<br>the most powerful group we realized was<br>the ministry of education's own Advisory<br>Group who Margaret and I in our I'll say<br>this for Margaret dazzling early year<br>younger years just look at us uh<br>briefing<br>we were actually hugely fortunate at the<br>composition of this group this is a<br>who's who of early childhood and in some<br>ways we had put together our own working<br>groups and we had deliberately left some<br>people off because the ministry there we<br>knew the ministry had to appoint people<br>to their working groups and these were<br>some of the suggestions and they picked<br>many of them up and so we have have here<br>Helen burnstone from Wellington College<br>of Education Marion Suter from<br>Palmerston North we have Sarah to only<br>who was um working in the Union at that<br>stage<br>um<br>Douglas from here and<br>um Carol Hamer who was an early<br>childhood person in the ministry so for<br>this draft we were we were it this is<br>the group interestingly the minutes of<br>that Ministry of Education group have<br>and it's very interesting seeing all the<br>comments as<br>other people gave advice and comments<br>but really they gave us brilliant<br>support<br>and we would never have got it through<br>the system without that group of women<br>actually supporting it within the<br>so<br>having survived Ministry scrutiny and<br>convincing the minister Lockwood Smith<br>that this indeed was a curricula was a<br>bit more difficult but again we were<br>indebted to to Marisol walk CEO of the<br>ministry but it's significant that the<br>ministry did not launch to fariki on the<br>release of the draft centers<br>it was seen as so little of significance<br>was attached to the document or they did<br>not want to draw attention too much<br>attention to it I don't know but there<br>was no they just posted it out to<br>but it was pretty<br>um politically fragile<br>why was it not called a curriculum I<br>mean Lockwood Smith would not allow it<br>to be called a curriculum this with the<br>minister because it didn't look like one<br>but it did get published but there were<br>two independent launches of the 1993<br>draft and one was here the first was<br>here at waikato Wolf Malcolm who the<br>center Research Center is named after<br>was a keen educationalist keenly<br>supported our contract had really<br>um<br>negotiated hard ball with the Ministry<br>of Education on that contract it took a<br>year to negotiate and we got everything<br>we wanted financially as well as some in<br>every other way he said he wanted to<br>launch it if the ministry wasn't going<br>so the university launched that<br>curriculum so tomity until he came up<br>and we had a great launch<br>but it um the other the second launch<br>was by secure the Union<br>and not the ministry and I want to<br>acknowledge the ongoing role of the<br>union and it's lovely to see you here<br>Jeanette um secure and later ncdi<br>they're protective and supportive hand<br>was instrumental first of all and<br>Margaret and I bidding for the contract<br>it was clear Wells who rang me after<br>attending the minister at the meeting in<br>the in the minister um the meeting in<br>Wellington of Early Childhood<br>organizations where the ministry<br>announced that there would be a<br>curriculum and there was concern about<br>it she rang me and said listen this is<br>going on because I really didn't know<br>what was happening down in Wellington<br>and she said would you consider putting<br>a group together and bidding and I sort<br>of goat I said just a minute as I walked<br>down to Margaret's office and said I've<br>just got clear on the phone and this is<br>what she's asking Margaret also gulped<br>and I said look I I'm going to contact<br>the kohangalaya trust and so that's how<br>it started it was with the union and<br>they said we will support you every inch<br>of the way if you will put in a bid and<br>they took a crucial role in keeping the<br>sector together<br>this became a journey that was hand in<br>hand with the profession and unlike the<br>the development of the school curriculum<br>all the examples in the early documents<br>came from the profession<br>so the opening statement at the<br>conference it was um was the Journey's<br>start and I'll read you what we said I<br>think I was the one not first doing<br>doing the talking at the first part of<br>our presentation then Margaret took over<br>occasion is most timely and coinciding<br>with the release of tafariki to centers<br>this week so I've been posted out in the<br>workshops today we will be suggesting<br>ideas for beginning to use the document<br>it is you as practitioners notice we<br>don't call them teachers who will decide<br>whether the curriculum can be made to<br>work for children or whether it remains<br>a glossy production on the Shelf well it<br>did stay on the shelf in some places<br>it's most fitting that the union has<br>taken the lead in setting up this<br>conference and that so many people<br>working in early childhood have have<br>traveled to a conference that is not<br>about wages and conditions or bulk<br>funding which was huge at the time or<br>the election<br>Grim as those things might be but have<br>come to listen debate talk learn about<br>Early Childhood curriculum and most of<br>all be thinking about the children we<br>work with and that was the beginning in<br>of the Union putting its hands around me<br>now us<br>so just a few more pictures I did find<br>from the start Margaret and I did many<br>joint presentations then we started to<br>do was we couldn't always be together<br>and we started our separate Journeys<br>ones nationally and one's<br>internationally<br>I think our first travels began in 1993<br>just as it was launched<br>and we took it overseas fairly nervously<br>to begin with and that we were taking<br>sort of to get affirmation we'll just<br>sort of say oh it's okay but maybe you<br>should because we knew it was only a<br>draft<br>but the opposite happened it seemed to<br>people became hugely interested in this<br>notion of tafariki Crossing Borders<br>began very early through the 1990s later<br>1990s 2000s we could name a number of<br>countries some of whom actually profess<br>um at the beginning of their curriculum<br>document will pay tribute to tavariki<br>the language of belonging become a<br>belonging well-being contribution<br>started to infiltrate other documents<br>and the notion of a framework rather<br>than the content seemed to shape a lot<br>of thinking but that was we had no idea<br>that would happen<br>so this is Margaret and I I don't know<br>where we are having dinner in some place<br>you know as we did<br>1995 I said farewell to Victoria and<br>this is sort of one of these poignant<br>photographs I'm being the team here took<br>me down to Victoria and this was my<br>welcome at Victoria and I'm um and I'm<br>talking to Margaret at this official<br>welcome and she's looking rather<br>mournful and I think we're both in tears<br>but um<br>but a new collaboration began Margaret<br>was by then starting to work on her<br>learning stories and myself working with<br>nzc uh and I'm parallel with Margaret we<br>began some work on teaching stories but<br>the curriculum is a political text and<br>the historic image below is one that<br>others will have seen is the 1996 launch<br>this time it's the prime minister is<br>suddenly launching it and they're<br>calling it a curriculum that has been<br>noticed around the world they're using<br>this no World Club wow and it's the<br>prime minister in the Beehive so the<br>shift was quite dramatic<br>however<br>we were deeply concerned about some<br>aspects of the original conception of<br>tafariki had been lost<br>the Pacifica curriculum had been pulled<br>out<br>the home-based curriculum had been<br>pulled out and same with children with<br>special needs these have all had their<br>own Journey Through the original draft<br>the separate exemplars were all lost on<br>the other hand the broad pedagogical<br>principles had survived untouched<br>and it would have been political suicide<br>but to far leuki if we had not supported<br>it and so it's one of these pragmatic<br>compromises sort of made for the greater<br>good but all through this journey<br>we've many of us have had to sort of<br>decide how far do we go before we say no<br>and how far do we pragmatically support<br>so this is one of my favorite pictures<br>this was taken 2013 I think it was again<br>soon after the conference here we<br>decided to that the tafariki papers<br>needed to be get into the timber library<br>and so I came up here and Margaret and I<br>spent several days we also knew that<br>somebody was watching the work the uh<br>the one of the little offices where they<br>were all stored and we might lose them<br>if we didn't do it fast so we cataloged<br>the whole lot and it was a real trip<br>down memory lane<br>one of the most interesting collection<br>of papers there were some great big<br>sheets of paper that tomity translated<br>the concept of Mana<br>onto<br>um while we Margaret who has neat<br>writing took notes on it and these big<br>sheets of paper of what these big terms<br>meant are in the Turnbull library now<br>really interesting to look at but all<br>the feedback we got<br>um everything is there and so that is us<br>so this is the only four photograph of<br>four of us and I've often reflected on<br>the kind of role we played in fronting<br>tafarliki because in the school<br>curriculum<br>processes that have happened over the<br>years the writers have been under the<br>radar in many cases being kept under the<br>radar and we<br>wouldn't allow ourselves to be kept<br>under the radar because we we it was<br>just a different way of working but<br>here we are we're you know<br>it's I suppose that from the early 90s<br>and later with our back room involvement<br>in the later versions I've often wonder<br>and Peter Moss is somebody who um<br>somebody who's reading I I I've always<br>admired his writing but he's quite Stern<br>on people he calls policy wonks<br>who shape education policy and its<br>documents with the promises of new<br>technologies and I've often wondered oh<br>gosh will we policy walks and I went he<br>was at a seminar in London once where I<br>put I put this to him to what extent did<br>we buy into it<br>to shape the government's agenda<br>because we were doing this were we doing<br>this at the bidding of political power<br>Brokers at the time of new right<br>economics and agendas were we framing a<br>politically acceptable agenda for<br>children and childhood did we compromise<br>too much were we silent on too many<br>things and as academics do we as<br>critical conscious stand outside The<br>Fray and critique or do we enter the<br>arena and I suppose at this stage<br>Margaret and I entered the arena with<br>all its constraints<br>and have a go at challenging the<br>discourse and in this case I think we<br>did it but there were many compromises<br>but we did try and create a new language<br>so throughout the journey the document's<br>been packaged in various ways the words<br>and the details have changed and there's<br>been many pins political and pedagogical<br>interests of how to go<br>and it's various versions and dropped<br>but what has been consistent<br>and why Margaret and I and Tilly and<br>tomity have supported each version is<br>that the original principles and strands<br>and goals have remained unchanged almost<br>word in fact we did basically I would<br>use the word written or put nicely<br>that if these were changed it wouldn't<br>be too far leaky and Safari he couldn't<br>be you know that it would be you'd have<br>to be something else so they've stayed<br>it's not coincidental though the Journey<br>of tafariki over the past three decades<br>has sat alongside the transformation of<br>teacher education and a journey towards<br>professionalization and the early<br>childhoods in the early childhood sector<br>in terms of qualifications the vision of<br>a fully qualified professional sector<br>still not realized was implicit in the<br>original document that was developed so<br>we had this thing we have to position it<br>in that<br>domain<br>but in language that is accessible by<br>many people who would not have be<br>trained in early childhood and so that<br>there is a<br>the political landscape now some of you<br>will have seen these slides before as I<br>said I've just<br>had a fish through my big collection the<br>political landscape and the backdrop has<br>shifted across the time frame of time<br>frame of defarity I don't have one of<br>the national government that was in<br>power at the time<br>but government interests in childhood<br>have been framed by shifting<br>philosophical and political views about<br>the role of government and if we see<br>is that Minister of Finance<br>with the baby and this is around the<br>time the free Early Childhood policy was<br>announced back in<br>1997 it was introduced that's a 1994<br>budget picture<br>and that was the the newspapers take on<br>what had happened with free Early<br>Childhood being announced but then we go<br>into a Nash 10 years war of a national<br>government where um the only babies the<br>ministers would hold were the vulnerable<br>and the other baby he's saying I don't<br>don't you know how much you'll eat he's<br>not mine you keep it you know and so<br>this is um<br>um mothers and babies and now we've had<br>the labor government and I'll talk a<br>little bit more about that later which<br>came in with aspirations child<br>well-being and more child-centered<br>policy child poverty we've got question<br>marks as to how far then how successful<br>we've also had a number of documents as<br>an historian I try to understand the<br>deeper context of policy there's a sense<br>of before and after to far leaky but I<br>suggest we should think of before and<br>after the 1989 reforms that created an<br>integrated policy infrastructure<br>tafariki followed in the after Martha<br>before five prior to this there was<br>minimal interference in the plays of gov<br>of childhood by government<br>they were pedagogical understandings in<br>kindergarten and in place Center they<br>were developing pedagogies that were a<br>catalyst reshaping our understanding of<br>curriculum Marley immersion embodying<br>tradeo and tikanga a curriculum of care<br>in child care and including infants and<br>a philosophy of inclusion for children<br>with special needs and very fledgling<br>Pacifica the notion of a Pacifica<br>curriculum and that was very fledgling<br>these were both established and fledging<br>understandings but the various policy<br>documents we've got here over the years<br>some have been in tune with tofaioluki<br>but some have been philosophically<br>absolutely Out Of Tune so if we look at<br>the agenda for children amazing agenda<br>for children it is a policy-framed realm<br>the vulnerable child and targeted<br>funding<br>an outputs versus rights of children<br>women Equity across the education system<br>and most recently we've had the<br>government's promises around investing<br>in infrastructure turning the tide we'll<br>come to that picture good intentions I<br>think have been mired with support<br>implementation yet tafariki has served<br>through it survived it somehow it's<br>managed to clutch at all of them<br>and another person I would like to just<br>add her voice to it these were comments<br>written 10 years ago<br>but the Farley key during the time<br>became part of the Everett everyday<br>language of early childhood and she says<br>one of the functions this is Joss saying<br>one of the functions of tafariki has to<br>provide a rallying point<br>for the profession in the face of<br>political change<br>which again I don't think we had<br>anticipated it has since been another<br>book come out but that's 10 years ago<br>also in 2013 a number of things happened<br>that year the government hosted a<br>conference for its oecd partners<br>it was also 20 years since the release<br>of the draft of tafariki<br>this at the member countries asked the<br>New Zealand government this is the<br>national government to have the<br>conference around safariki which I don't<br>think was something the ministry<br>actually had expected it would do but<br>they did it<br>and<br>I was privileged to speak from an<br>historical perspective on the 20-year<br>Journey with tafariki and the roller<br>coaster we had been through in terms of<br>policy and pedagogy I was very mindful<br>though I was speaking at a showcase<br>International audience I wasn't up there<br>trashing it but it had been a roller<br>coaster<br>reflected on what Marley meant from um<br>what um safaric he meant from a Maori<br>perspective and their words capture<br>the powerful aspiration statements about<br>tafariki as as a Maori a tapestry of<br>life<br>available to anyone and everyone in New<br>Zealand and the world<br>at the time in my presentation this is<br>what I said<br>we are currently at a Crossroads with<br>tavariki we are still traveling with<br>tavariki one of the things that New<br>Zealand as a whole has done is invest in<br>time and I think that is probably the<br>most important thing other countries<br>which develop curriculum after us have<br>developed other ones dumped them moved<br>on all sorts of things we haven't we<br>have kept stayed the course<br>but we also know I said we can do better<br>now this was in the beginnings of that<br>lead up to the idea that there should be<br>a new curriculum or they didn't use the<br>word refresh then but tafaruki was being<br>discussed<br>we were in the slow lead up as I said to<br>what became the refresh but an important<br>moment<br>this event was hosted by hekia palata<br>who was the new minister of Education<br>she was stunning there it also helped<br>hugely that she was the niece of tamati<br>and Tilly who made their pitch very<br>strongly there so in a sense despite her<br>political Persuasions on that we had a<br>sense that topology was in good hands<br>um so we are indebted actually to her<br>that we gotta refresh and not a new<br>curriculum because it was certainly on<br>the cards now I'm going to if I can do<br>it this enzy I want to come back to the<br>union<br>it has been nzdi who at 20 years of age<br>and this was the new curriculum the um<br>the not the draft of it put out the<br>celebration video<br>I'm only going to show you a little bit<br>because of time but it's got some<br>thinking and comments from people at<br>that stage much of it still resonates<br>oh dear and it goes back if you've got<br>it<br>okay<br>vegetate too long we'll leave it<br>um<br>okay let's just put it okay<br>nice<br>okay<br>um it's it's a Pity we can't see that<br>because it's actually got Margaret<br>speaking and myself speaking<br>um about<br>the beginnings of tafari key so some of<br>the stuff I was going to tell you about<br>how it happened is on that video however<br>I do have copies of it and if anyone<br>would like to see that and we might be<br>able to put it up um on Zoom for later<br>because it would be nice to see that<br>that also means in another video clip of<br>um will not be shown either but never<br>mind<br>um<br>let's just move on then<br>um<br>let's fast forward then to 2017.<br>this was how to fardi key was announced<br>by government I mean I was godspec to<br>see that this is you know this is it did<br>uh they called it World leading Early<br>Childhood correction or rather Bland the<br>policy walks that had their hand on the<br>pin<br>um is in a subtle but not to scare away<br>and to get consensus I personally it<br>actually says that it's um<br>I think it's too ambitious this actually<br>says that a well-constructed curriculum<br>is essential to ensuring children have<br>the best start in life I think that's a<br>bit ambitious I think it's a bit<br>idealistic to say that the curriculum<br>itself makes changes<br>um it's more that it can be however a<br>springboard to enactment it all depends<br>however on the infrastructure that<br>um surrounds it<br>and certainly<br>we have issues with the infrastructure<br>we have a very different scene now to<br>what we have in the early 90s a<br>significant upgrade in qualified staff<br>and the substance of qualifications but<br>this time it was Minister Paratha who<br>launched the curriculum the updated<br>curriculum with a Grand Occasion not at<br>the Beehive but the Ministry of<br>Education and I was asked to speak on<br>behalf of Margaret of myself Margaret<br>was overseas<br>the process had actually been pretty<br>challenging<br>there were many pins at work on that<br>refresh<br>with multiple agendas<br>and the people who really knew what they<br>were doing or saying often didn't get<br>got their pin rubbed out and didn't get<br>their essay in the reaction to the early<br>drafts was not good we four had been<br>appointed to an Advisory Group but we're<br>very much at hands off that Margaret and<br>I I think put together about a 30-page<br>document critique the first draft we saw<br>but<br>what was intent were the principles and<br>Australians do<br>and in the event I think we did get a<br>document we could work with<br>um I think I think we certainly did I<br>mean we all might have liked to have<br>seen something different or something<br>but the there was some adjustment to<br>those early drafts but although this was<br>an interesting times because at this<br>very same time<br>the Ministry of Education was<br>considering signing up to an oecd assist<br>International assessment project<br>comparative that would have totally<br>undermined to far leaky and a number of<br>us protested and Margaret did a lot of<br>work in this very very strongly and so<br>very carefully at that launch where I<br>had everybody who was anybody in the<br>ministry in front of me<br>I raised the issue and talked about the<br>risks to the new tavariki and I added<br>some sensible ones in but finished up<br>one of the risks would be if the<br>government signs up to the oecd now<br>we're very pleased when they didn't<br>um fortunately<br>okay<br>more recently<br>we offer okay I've been interviewing<br>teachers and teacher educations who work<br>or our students with trilita Maya home<br>and I've written a book in celebration<br>of its 60th birthday<br>which is down the bottom there it's<br>still being type set but they've got the<br>cover<br>over some of the story over one of the<br>stories that I wanted to canvas<br>in this book was the refresh to farting<br>because it was particularly looking at<br>the last decade<br>and I've just selected three comments<br>now there were many many comments it was<br>not a bad news story but I think they<br>were interesting just to sort of see<br>well what is the sector feeling about it<br>and those of you out there will have a<br>much more data on this but I've just<br>selected three which I've put into the<br>book I didn't want to love the new<br>tafari keeper because I was attached to<br>the old one<br>but I think it's now fantastic it builds<br>up on what we've had before a document<br>actually can make a difference and it's<br>really pleasing to hear that but lots of<br>things have been going on this is all<br>the political stuff and even our best<br>teachers don't have time for<br>professional learning now and this was<br>after covert our understanding and<br>implementation of tafariki is suffering<br>because of that and I think we've been<br>through some tough times another one<br>this was a center up in whangarei the<br>new curriculum was very clear about<br>being bicultural it was easy to use and<br>understand although it took us a while<br>until that time and that time actually<br>was just a few months previously<br>um it was put on our Shelf<br>the old tafari key wasn't a living<br>curriculum for us these were young<br>teachers who were you know this but the<br>old tafariq was sort of 25 years ago<br>this is another generation these were<br>young teachers and it really woke me up<br>this comment we're now more connected<br>that's because it was new and we<br>unpacked it together<br>the language feels more like us and the<br>other one<br>it's a disappointment<br>after almost a 30-year Journey with<br>tafariki there is the intention of a<br>bicultural curriculum but how much are<br>we actually seeing out there in the<br>Early Childhood Services there are still<br>lots of excuses while people incentives<br>are not further along in their Journeys<br>so just a little bit of a sampling<br>following the launch of the refreshed<br>tafari key the political landscape<br>dramatically changed and this was from<br>my slide pretty soon after the election<br>um into what I then called you political<br>times and this was a 207 yet 2017<br>presentation these times were actually<br>unexpected and unplanned for in many<br>ways when we look at the labor party<br>policies summarized above which at that<br>stage just a few months after they had<br>we can see though that it was mainly<br>about reinstating losses it wasn't<br>actually pushing us forward very much it<br>was about recapturing what had been<br>taken away from us and five years on we<br>are disappointed<br>even with what had been you know the<br>reinstating of what we had lost but that<br>was my slide from the time<br>in 2018 I was asked to present to the<br>institute for Early Childhood studies at<br>Victoria University<br>and<br>I had just written the Third Edition of<br>politics in the playground it hadn't<br>actually been released at that stage<br>um and I put up my final statement that<br>I wrote in that book which is now came<br>out 2019. it feels like we're waiting at<br>the crossroads I've said that before I<br>know Positive Directions have been<br>signposted but the degree of political<br>result to implement the recommendations<br>or turn the tide and this is perceptions<br>Frozen<br>forcefully is not assured<br>there is much competition for government<br>resources from the other education<br>sector groups under review or in<br>negotiation much more rests on the<br>government's ability to deliver and win<br>a second term in office so in the<br>consistency is all before covert but<br>already I was saying will he turn the<br>tide<br>or is it going to be a trickle<br>now there are some of us you know there<br>are a number of us in the sector many<br>here who wanted to move the policy<br>further forward Beyond just reinstating<br>what we had I was a member of the<br>Strategic plan reference group as was<br>um Linda here and I'm trying to think<br>was there anyone else in the audience<br>here a member of that group but<br>I can remember<br>recipients coming into that group and<br>somehow I got the job of asking him the<br>hard question saying Minister do you<br>really mean us to turn the tide is that<br>what you're looking for and we were<br>talking about<br>um<br>profit and private Enterprise a whole<br>range of things and he said because we<br>said looks not much point<br>us sitting here turning the tide for you<br>giving you a blueprint for turning the<br>tide if you don't really mean it can you<br>win it in cabinet<br>yes be bold he says<br>we were weren't we we put up all these<br>very bold papers they never got into the<br>final draft ever<br>um this was the issue<br>whoever there were opportunities<br>the abolition of national standards<br>literally within a week of the<br>government being the new government<br>being formed ncdi<br>was very pleased as was many of us but<br>it was nzdi again that took the lead<br>and later the Ministry of Education<br>joined in to host Six National Hui<br>around the country celebrating our<br>curriculum<br>and I was asked to speak on tafariki now<br>I think I was expected to talk about<br>you know telling people about safariki<br>and I thought well bother that we've<br>been telling people about the firework I<br>don't know how many years let's take it<br>further and Margaret and I had tried to<br>take it further on several times<br>um unsuccessfully we tried with the<br>refresh<br>so this is what I said in the talk we<br>have the possibility of making some<br>pedagogical shifts in early years<br>schooling and I don't want to miss the<br>boat I'm looking at the culture and<br>pedagogy of early years schooling and<br>there's a Continuum of possibilities we<br>could do<br>we could redress the mismatch of the<br>transition processes between early<br>childhood education as a school<br>national standards have had a<br>destructive impact and a destructive<br>reach into Early Childhood centers at<br>the other end of the Continuum I'm<br>proposing that we take the framework of<br>tafar aliki and we move it into the<br>Junior School<br>there is no mismatch between the school<br>curriculum but it does require a shift<br>in Thinking by teachers about children<br>learning and assessment for your<br>children<br>there was a great there was a great lot<br>of Cheers came up in my some of the<br>audiences I thought wow I'm winning this<br>I later found out those were the tables<br>with all the Early Childhood people<br>cheering away<br>however there was quite a good reception<br>from junior class teachers I there was a<br>lot of feedback people being in contact<br>with me later so saying how do we start<br>this how do we do this in my<br>presentation I said politically we could<br>win this<br>the issue would be the ability of<br>teachers in junior classes to implement<br>it very few<br>remember the time when Junior classes<br>ran playful programs a large percenter<br>of teachers only know about National<br>standards and I showed the audience my<br>classroom from 1974<br>um Brooklyn School five-year-olds we<br>were not a well-equipped classroom but<br>these children played for the day<br>they came in and we did all sorts of<br>things<br>um the little girl right down the bottom<br>there is actually composing music we had<br>some chime bars and we had the alphabet<br>letters equivalent to the chime bars and<br>they would make up pieces putting the<br>alphabet letters together and play their<br>chime bars and music then they would<br>perform it for the class or they would<br>do it the other way they would play the<br>chime bars and then write down put up<br>the cards for their music these were<br>little five-year-olds you know<br>um it was a you know some of the best<br>times in my life I also showed the slide<br>this is a minister of Education in 1944<br>addressing the education conference in<br>the war which determined there would be<br>a new Early Childhood policy after the<br>war preschool policy which brought in<br>kindergartens particularly<br>um but also that all Junior classes it<br>is about playing now we have not had a<br>minister say anything like this since so<br>I decided this was going to be stated at<br>the conference nothing short of a<br>revolution has taken place in the infant<br>room during the past 20 years it has my<br>full support we must all agree that the<br>infant room the learning of formal<br>intellectual schools is of secondary<br>importance<br>would you get a minister daring to say<br>that nowadays what is of supreme<br>important this is the young child should<br>be healthy happy should learn to work<br>and play with other children that his<br>mind has should be kept Lively eager and<br>full of wonder and that is what the<br>policy 1944 the minister was saying<br>should be in Early Education<br>Wendy and I<br>um and I can't I won't be showing this<br>just a brief explanation I've had the<br>privilege over I was for three years I<br>think it was as a judge<br>I would say from West 2018 of the prime<br>minister's teaching excellence awards<br>and we have had the privilege of seeing<br>the most amazing<br>schools Early Childhood centers<br>secondary schools across New Zealand<br>and I was going to show you an Exemplar<br>from one of them now in in the judging<br>you you can't get to every school that's<br>up as a finalist but there was a couple<br>there was one that Wendy and I did make<br>sure we got to and it was an interesting<br>one because this was a school that a<br>primary school over in um Napier Henry<br>Hill school I will name it because it<br>won the award and it was a school that<br>had framed its whole curriculum around<br>athology now<br>the what doesn't mean to say that they<br>weren't children weren't learning to<br>read and thus but we said that's us we<br>will visit it<br>and of course they were a little shocked<br>when we could they they hadn't expected<br>I think two experts and tavariki to turn<br>up and look at the school but this was a<br>school that actually was living in a<br>very challenging neighborhood there was<br>Guns there was gang neighborhood<br>children were they had to deal with<br>trauma and so they framed their school<br>curriculum around a peaceful curriculum<br>yoga character<br>sensory experiences really interesting<br>work with the way they handled food<br>self-managing schools children being<br>inducted into self-regulation learning<br>about their brains but the rationale for<br>the whole school they use the language<br>of tefaliki there was not one mention of<br>the school curriculum now that won the<br>award you know and so this is really<br>interesting waimara's school was a<br>Junior School<br>started during national standards to<br>take on board to fardiki it sent their<br>teachers out for once a fortnight<br>to train an early childhood centers over<br>18 months<br>and they came back absolutely enamored<br>so they shifted the whole Junior School<br>curriculum around Safari I put my hand<br>up to see that I went with a secondary<br>school principal so it was really<br>interesting to bounce off ideas and it's<br>quite useful to have somebody from the<br>secondary teaching Bachelor you know<br>back your support when you were trying<br>to negotiate who's going to win the<br>award but in they when you talk to them<br>they make a wonderful statement in this<br>um YouTube saying we do not expect or<br>want children to come who know how to<br>write their names we're not interested<br>whether they can write their names we're<br>not interested whether they can count<br>all their colors if they can fantastic<br>it doesn't interest us particularly what<br>you know what numbers they know then<br>they list what does interest them and it<br>is totally the language of tafariki and<br>so it was a brilliant example of a<br>school that totally shifted the outcome<br>of that was once those children went<br>into the senior part of the school they<br>weren't prepared to give up their play<br>so every classroom right throughout the<br>school had a junk area in the classroom<br>they had creative play going on all time<br>children were allowed inside or outside<br>every classroom was equipped with blocks<br>right up to 12 year olds and so this was<br>the so there are some interesting things<br>happening however<br>I don't think we've had a revolution<br>what we've had is permission<br>that schools can do this and I'd love to<br>see a revolution but my last slide<br>is<br>where did I put it<br>all right must be somewhere else never<br>mind<br>the whole context I think I just want to<br>focus on is tafar leak his survival is<br>about<br>um what extent<br>the infrastructure is into you know the<br>issues of infrastructure is interwoven<br>with tafari king and the implementation<br>of it uh here we go I think I might have<br>it here it was one of two things I<br>um<br>and I don't think this you know this<br>journey can't be separated from the<br>policy Journey which has lurched<br>alongside tafariq he shaped it sometimes<br>hinted it it has also enabled it<br>it's constrained at two<br>but the pedagogical work yes must<br>continue but unless we win more on the<br>political front we're always swimming<br>against the tide I suppose<br>so our action plan is languishing<br>the movement on pay parity we've had but<br>it's imperfectly implemented underfunded<br>and the recommendations over ratios are<br>not even on the horizon<br>we've really gained anything for early<br>childhood education ever since I've been<br>involved without making a noise<br>and this year we have been making a<br>noise but it still needs to be louder<br>United but making a noise is not only<br>about politics it's also about pedagogy<br>the early years or the years when young<br>children find their voice are listened<br>to and the most important years of a<br>person's life they gain a voice<br>so this is the story of my<br>um latest book which is a celebration of<br>tunita Maya ho 60th Jubilee originally<br>the New Zealand Association of child<br>care centers it's also written in<br>celebration that Sonja Davies will be<br>100 years old this year the<br>organization's Advocate and founder who<br>taught me personally in our days of<br>setting up the Early Childhood workers<br>union and many others about founding our<br>voice and how to use it to political<br>Advantage so thank you for the<br>opportunity to speak and tell a story<br>and just to say again I still feel my<br>story is very much a backroom story a<br>journey<br>the front line is where everybody out<br>um Helen it's always such an amazing<br>pleasure to listen to you talk and for<br>me who's been around for all the two<br>things and a lot of other people so if<br>it's brought back so many incredible<br>memories but I think also for all of us<br>it's been really insightful you know the<br>new things we've learned and the<br>thoughts that we've had so thank you so<br>much<br>um<br>I think you talk with such Flair and<br>your images are absolutely wonderful and<br>also in human it really brings things to<br>life<br>so we heard about the pre-curriculum<br>times and the footsteps and also your<br>generosity and um appreciating all the<br>people who walked the Journey of Titanic<br>so it's been a great pleasure and I want<br>to say that I was working with the<br>combined Early Childhood of union Nevada<br>right you'd have been at that conference<br>line yes and I thought we were the ones<br>who launched it I didn't know why Qatar<br>had got in before us no you got waikato<br>were a little bit later I think so<br>because you launched it the week it went<br>out the sentence<br>I should have done them the other way<br>around<br>so you and Margaret spoke then of your<br>concerns about the new seamless<br>education past and I'm approaching from<br>you you said we have to we may have to<br>watch out for any unplanned and<br>unwarranted invasions from the north<br>the skull curriculum and the South<br>parent's first time<br>it's a kind of pincer movement dividing<br>the Early Childhood Services<br>and I think<br>um what I love about you is you're such<br>a fearless and bold Advocate and there<br>are still battles that are ongoing so I<br>think it's really fitting that you're<br>talking here at this early years<br>conference<br>um I really wish Margaret was here too<br>I'm hoping she's listening on me I know<br>she's not well today and she wanted to<br>be here but you too you and Margaret are<br>the University of waikato people who we<br>feel immensely proud of and I think you<br>with other people have changed the face<br>of early childhood education in aotearoa<br>and internationally so thank you very<br>much<br>foreign<br>this<br>is<br>oh what a roller coaster right well I<br>think about the images but it's all very<br>difficult<br>that's great<br>this is the Run of waimara school's<br>personal agency<br>well I think the reason one of the<br>reasons I want to put my run up on the<br>uh<br>have teachers that I've worked with<br>forever because with the teachers at<br>creatine stay so I've worked with some<br>of my colleagues for 22 years now and um<br>some of them for 10 to 15 years you know<br>around 10 years<br>possibly is when they might leave<br>because they've found a new life the New<br>Horizon to explore some of them going<br>into primary school and uncommuting<br>play-based programs yes that<br>anyway<br>um so you can see that enmeshed in all<br>of this<br>principles<br>there's empathic relationships ethical<br>engagement multiple stories told or<br>restored shifting learner trajectories<br>the interconnectedness of of everybody<br>in this diverse community and yet the<br>uniqueness of each child and each person<br>as well<br>um we were a dialogic community we<br>talked Lots<br>and um we viewed learning as lived<br>experience<br>inside is social context and place and<br>time so I love the child Maori concept<br>of the past and forming the present into<br>a future<br>and mixing all of that up together<br>so<br>we realized that there are many possible<br>stories<br>and research Choice they've made so this<br>means that the pathway chosen here is<br>contestable and it's a choice made in<br>the full knowledge that other narratives<br>exist that there are alternative but<br>we're prepared to fight for them because<br>it's so important to us to make sure<br>so<br>um my epistemology is positioned as a<br>narrative Inquirer<br>um as a co-constructed Unreal unraveling<br>a story<br>um<br>because this resonated with the ethos of<br>this study<br>um and a girl<br>um I checked that I really like views<br>that relationship is the heart of living<br>alongside a narrative inquiry in the<br>relationships form the Nexus of this<br>kind of inquiry space so this means a<br>narrative tuning inside a relational<br>research community<br>um one of the narrative streets that<br>came through the research was the view<br>that<br>um in community really does learning<br>happen in isolation from others<br>and we all see learning this connection<br>uh as we do we begin to understand how<br>relationships must envelop and protect<br>each child's growing identity as a<br>learner their manner their Modi and<br>their wider<br>so these ideas<br>part of the narrative teachers and<br>families relation um the ideas that they<br>offered and children's views of<br>themselves so what we found is as we<br>begin to begin to write these stories<br>um families began shifting their views<br>for example a learning story written<br>about the way<br>little three-year-old at least actually<br>when he started could use real tools and<br>a learning learning center for feedback<br>from his parents was that they stopped<br>by plastic toys on his birthday and<br>bought real real talks<br>so and you know there was that way of<br>Shifting<br>um the conversation but also we listened<br>to the families and we put their voice<br>into that story well so hearing that um<br>that<br>um Blake was his name because in terms<br>of the<br>um the ethics<br>families and teachers were offered<br>anonymity but nobody chose to use it<br>because the learning stories are credit<br>based and they celebrate learning and<br>that's why we put the time and effort<br>into writing it now I<br>um one of the things that came up from<br>you Helen is by remembering right that<br>um<br>that there isn't much time<br>now given to people to do this kind of<br>thing well I think and you talked about<br>the infrastructure being there<br>um I think that is about being a good<br>and making sure that the things you<br>value actually at our given the time and<br>when we use learning stories as a way to<br>think about professional process I call<br>an attorney evaluation there's both<br>evidence then we can get rid of a<br>hollandstone<br>in 2000 I went down to an assessment<br>Court<br>of course in Dunedin and I heard that<br>kindergarten teacher was writing for<br>every single one of their children and<br>those days 45 children in the morning<br>and 55 in the afternoon<br>and I came back and talked about it with<br>our teachers through the people we can't<br>possibly do this for all of our children<br>because it too much work you know maybe<br>we can only talk<br>time and then we realized<br>that we have to make this<br>um just<br>socially just<br>every single child<br>entitled to hear about the learning that<br>they were immensely interested and I<br>accusative Tech to use<br>automation's interests anymore because<br>they think it's gone but<br>and people can say oh yeah they're<br>interested in dinosaurs well actually<br>they're not necessarily they might be<br>interested in sitting next to the<br>childhood's interest but they're<br>interested in friendships so thinking<br>about the dispositional underpinnings<br>that go follow children's lives and<br>thinking too about um<br>the working theories that they had<br>and that they were the two main learning<br>outcomes from the original<br>let alone the 117 what year but the two<br>essential ones for this were those and<br>so that makes me worry about<br>um when Hero Comes<br>and says we want to know how you're<br>implementing the 20 outcomes from<br>society<br>sure are you kidding me<br>anyway that's another story for another<br>day<br>um so<br>um<br>so let's get stuck into a child's toys<br>so I'm not sure how much time we've got<br>oh okay sorry I've been rabbiting once<br>yeah okay so this is the story written<br>for Kira and<br>um it's called<br>um it's the story is called<br>um from her words when I look back at my<br>learning stories I remember all the<br>things that made me a great learner<br>and the whakatoki that is embedded in<br>and oh sorry<br>um so what happened here was that she<br>was having a little bit of trouble<br>figuring out<br>um what<br>um<br>what to do because she got stuck when<br>she was trying to make a book you can<br>see who they're on the top figuring out<br>how to make a book and um and her<br>teacher Molly said to her well do you<br>remember when you got stuck last time<br>and we wrote a learning story for you<br>and um she said yeah maybe we could go<br>back and have a look at that and see<br>what you did and so um she was quite<br>happy with that idea so she they went<br>over and got her portfolio and somebody<br>says in the story that she thought that<br>it would be that<br>um<br>they would just look at that particular<br>story but she wanted to come back and re<br>and read the whole thing and so I<br>actually see very easily<br>um<br>from the notes there<br>exactly she said so just see if I can<br>find it on my computer<br>um yeah<br>um so Molly says Pierre you had a plan<br>and with this you tuned into your Henny<br>narrow your mind with a steadfast flow<br>after Gathering the resources that you<br>needed to make your walk you sit down<br>and begin to persevere with bringing<br>this plan into action and undertaking a<br>creative plan more often than not you<br>are making surprise uncertainty and<br>challenge<br>today was no exception being a<br>resourceful learner that you are I<br>watched as you began to tackle the<br>problem from different angles and these<br>are her words this is still too tricky I<br>need some help<br>I remember a time and well he said I<br>remember a time when you had a very<br>small plan should we look at your book<br>and see how you conquered this Challenge<br>and achieved your learning goal yes<br>that's a good idea secure<br>um I thought of showing you the story<br>curious perseverance but you decided to<br>start at the beginning and together we<br>visited all your learning stories you<br>Revisited your stories of great pride<br>and it seems to me that this was a<br>moment that nurtured your manner here<br>you here are some of the things you said<br>yes I can do hard things when I try<br>really hard when I keep persevering I<br>know what to do when things get tricky<br>wow of course barely four-year-old<br>should be able to know this about<br>herself so reflective and when I look<br>back at my learning stories I remember<br>all the things that make me a great<br>learner and with this you change to your<br>plan and continue to tune into your<br>Henning Arrow bringing your creative<br>plan into fruition<br>so<br>only way children get to be able to use<br>these words is to hear them<br>and when teachers talk about this<br>dispositions about being a creative<br>learner finding really big goals that<br>are tricky but not giving up you know<br>those are the kinds of things that<br>change children's views themselves<br>so this is a story about Lucas now<br>and um it says Lucas grows his<br>connection to Tiana healing now this is<br>a story about going out into the forest<br>as you can see uh and<br>um<br>the teachers set the scene with the<br>story<br>um and<br>what I really loved are the the working<br>theories that come out of this so<br>um Lucas had been closely inspecting<br>that for a little while and when he told<br>me look at this it's ready it's ready to<br>pull off and the log is still steadily<br>decomposing and has become very soft we<br>chatted about decomposing with everyone<br>offering events of knowledge Odin<br>thought it would be microbes now the<br>reason she she um he knows about<br>microbes is because his mother has a<br>forest for the growing flowers so she<br>will have been talking about my friends<br>so you know it's very socio-cultural um<br>children know and what they're<br>interested in<br>um<br>Lucas said can I hear this tree<br>breathing<br>Lucas wondered as he put his ear up<br>against a taurine Moon his attention<br>turned back to the log he'll turn back<br>into swell I think Tony mahuta may have<br>been on Lucas's mind and as we off as we<br>often chat about how the trees are his<br>children Lucas pointed at some young<br>seedlings and he lives right over there<br>he died he can turn back into soil and<br>Piper talked about insects living here<br>Lucas looked around and quietly said a<br>beautiful Forest over there now I know<br>that a few days later I came along found<br>and saw the sandpit and it had all of<br>these big tree trunks standing up in<br>I hadn't seen what had happened when I<br>asked the teachers it was Lucas saying I<br>want to build the forest and so lots of<br>children help us and mind you there were<br>no leaves on these interests they were<br>all staring together<br>um so I just I probably running out of<br>time<br>so you get the idea I hope but what<br>we're trying to do is really embed<br>language culture and identity into these<br>learning stories so that children get a<br>very real sense about what it is we<br>value and we we're<br>raising the bar in terms of the way we<br>talk with families we don't talk down<br>these are stories that will last<br>forever<br>for these children<br>and so we want them to know that<br>the important things<br>that we're observing and we want to<br>share so look and<br>books is Maori shifted as he immersed<br>himself in this deep state of smoke<br>that's what being asked in uhuri does to<br>Binghamton into nature<br>and he was awake alert creative<br>energized and attentive<br>he was settled calm and imbalanced<br>Lucas's life Essence and why to have<br>flourished with potential ideas and<br>connections always always listening to<br>children and<br>um and following in a responsive way<br>based in relationships totally engaged<br>in in safariki<br>you might want to compare that with<br>setting IDP goals ahead of time for a<br>beginning of the term which is becoming<br>a flavor<br>what happens in early childhood<br>currently which is very disturbing Trend<br>I think<br>because outside of the child outside of<br>the context of learning<br>a plan is being made which can narrow<br>um teachers perspectives and miss the<br>essence of what it means to live and<br>work alongside a relationship with this<br>child so very very sad<br>um<br>um so I'll step to the end<br>so in terms of my research<br>and this is what made me want to<br>continue on to do a PhD although<br>sometimes I hope I hear them<br>but the selection of A Narrative<br>Approach meant that this thesis did not<br>result in the quantifiable mission<br>of learning story impacts however<br>measurable results would be inconsistent<br>with the tafariki socio-cultural concept<br>of complex learning<br>complex learning requires complex<br>assessment strategies to support learner<br>self-efficacy and doing interviews how<br>they could keep improving in them so I<br>love that learning stories help to be<br>really reflective but actually it's<br>what's happening and on around inside<br>our settings and outside of our sittings<br>that Infuse children<br>with these ideas so of course in<br>partnership with families<br>um<br>so all I can say is that I really hope<br>that instead of<br>wheezing learning stories into a format<br>um into a pre-designed idea of what<br>could happen in a short space of time<br>that actually you can free The Wider<br>from within you and be true to yourself<br>and true to the children that we're<br>responsible for<br>nurturing their learning identities now<br>and into a future life where<br>where we know not what that might<br>so those dispositions and working<br>I'd just like to thank the rain for her<br>amazing presentation and apologize to<br>the technical issues so I acknowledge<br>that we didn't start the session about<br>10 minutes late so what I'd like to do<br>I'm sure you have some questions if I<br>get you to come over here Lorraine we<br>can take a couple of questions while<br>invite the whanau from going to come<br>down and get their presentation set up<br>we've got to try and do it that way<br>if you'd like to come and enjoy the<br>session if you need to go to another<br>so does anyone have some questions we'll<br>arrange I realize we're in a moment of<br>change<br>today<br>if you would like to catch up with<br>Lorraine you're welcome to do so<br>very much um sort of really profound<br>thoughts for learning stories and some<br>future insight into comments<br>um so this this is um huana<br>um<br>uh and they're going to give us a little<br>introduction and talk about their<br>presentation<br>um I<br>I'm a lecturer here at the farijuana and<br>I was also the researcher supporting our<br>whanau here from<br>Rotorua so we're right by the airport<br>and I'm also fortunate to be a graduate<br>of that kohanga di also pass pass the<br>um everybody my name is Tori erlich I am<br>foreign<br>kindergarten as well as<br>um<br>kindergarten and we've been working on a<br>project together and that Linda's been<br>leading and so we we presenting some of<br>our quarter door that came from that<br>project but being a conference about<br>Tiffany we wanted to sort of align some<br>of the alpha card or with Tiffany as<br>well and so we hope that what we have to<br>share today will perhaps give you<br>something to think about in terms of<br>manatangata that's our focus and sort of<br>sharing some of our forcato that has<br>come from both our journey but also our<br>foreign<br>and it's that notion of weaving together<br>a Tota a rope<br>um and weaving together groups of people<br>and we've done that<br>atokawa through connections with the<br>fenua so I think they sort of go hand in<br>hand when we talk about manatangata<br>there's also this connection with the<br>fenua<br>it speaks to us and in terms of the<br>mokopuna about opportunities and<br>experiences to learn about their<br>whakapapa to make those connections with<br>their friends as well as the whanau<br>fanui hapu<br>to have opportunity to connect with<br>but what I really like about<br>um<br>this statement is the bit around the<br>part of<br>um for want of a translation it speaks<br>to to me in us about<br>um the Oneness of or whsano and what<br>that looks like truly looks like and so<br>I've got this paharakiki here which was<br>at my Nan's footy and it really needs to<br>be untended to but anyways<br>um but uh looking at the paharakiki in<br>that Oneness and it's how it's all<br>and weaving together<br>um alfano altoda it's<br>our practice has always been about<br>visiting uh the tribal in Max or vowel<br>and it started very early on<br>um as we would go and visit our marai<br>and those trips took us many places it<br>took us to kahura nakimurai and kahunanu<br>we've been up north<br>um we've been yeah we've been everywhere<br>um<br>but after while it evolved to wanting to<br>connect with our Mona our<br>um and so that's the journey that we've<br>been on together as a whanau<br>um unfortunately when covert came along<br>that all stopped and<br>um<br>so the tlri project that we've been<br>working on<br>was an opportunity for us to reconnect<br>with practices<br>um that we had been doing among with our<br>whanau in the past and so this is sort<br>of where we've got to at this point with<br>I This was um one<br>it really why Edward and<br>um so at kohanga we always start off<br>with<br>um<br>so an extension of that is our project<br>we have today and<br>um with this project and so we focused<br>on one for this<br>um and so this is just one of the ways<br>we work with the children to learn the<br>whakapapa<br>so here we have<br>um<br>the pakiki the older children and<br>Juana's group<br>and there we've gone to mawal<br>to experience<br>I suppose the wairua and to see the<br>Flora the fauna to smell the ocean need<br>to visually see the aqua of the manga in<br>the surroundings and so this is in the<br>extension to here pipiha is visiting the<br>manga and and seeing the Moana<br>uh just the collective participation of<br>the tamariki feeling<br>the wairua at MOA and looking and<br>hearing<br>um walking the funeral visualizing the<br>purako the stories that we've shared<br>with them and giving them the children<br>giving the children the confidence<br>um to move from one learning environment<br>so and prep for our hidinger<br>so this is<br>um<br>2022 in August<br>so just in preparation<br>we focused on all the purako the stories<br>and that pertained to Tauranga mobile<br>um<br>and from those stories we<br>learned the wyatta that famous in<br>Tauranga into that area<br>um learned the connections of the mini<br>ewe through the navigations of the Waka<br>and creating collages or creating<br>um<br>yes<br>so this is our one of our our first<br>visit to mobile<br>um so here we have a local guide<br>um that's and he was able to share with<br>us the history of mobile<br>in the extensions of the connections of<br>other tribal<br>affiliations to that area<br>or he shared a hell of a lot there was<br>heaps<br>and<br>you said so on top of that there was<br>also the sites of significance he shared<br>with us and sites of interests<br>um<br>about that area not just the manga but<br>the area and further out and we couldn't<br>even pinpoint we was pointing to so just<br>imagine that<br>um so if that's how we felt our kids<br>felt the same so it was quite a little<br>bit daunting trying to figure out<br>where's wataniwanuku it's over there<br>somewhere<br>but um that's another hiding and for us<br>um so he<br>pointed out this area and this is um the<br>tip end of matakana Island<br>and it was really interesting so we took<br>on borders caught it or about this I'm<br>saying because it spoke of Patsy<br>and so the kids love hatipati yeah we<br>all do<br>um but in his<br>sharings with us he spoke of hachipatu<br>seeking<br>a man of tainui descent and his name was<br>um<br>so hence why hatipati was after him uh<br>inside this is where<br>Roma T passed in the name of the area is<br>panipani<br>so that was a really nice shearing from<br>this<br>and then also talking about the captain<br>of The tainui Walker<br>um<br>and<br>they have navigating his walker<br>um between these two the Mania in the<br>island<br>and<br>pushing over an old lady<br>and so that's how the kids uh<br>hearing the story oh this old lady got<br>pushed out of the Walker why crackies<br>but but then there's lots more to it you<br>know it makes you think<br>um you know what really happened so it's<br>a lot of thinking and a lot of learning<br>a lot of history<br>and so being able to connect<br>kainuiwaka coming through<br>and their connections to mobile<br>as well as and their connections<br>tomorrow<br>so weaving all of those eweed together<br>helped um<br>all of us parents and the children find<br>the connection with each other with each<br>of us<br>so it started off being a project<br>focused on Juana and who<br>people who a papa who links<br>and get it<br>reflected on all of us because we were<br>all involved in that<br>um so after the hiding uh well that<br>somebody went back to kohanga with fire<br>Heather and they were able to add to the<br>artwork things that they had seen on the<br>hidinger<br>um matakana appeared on the artwork but<br>prior to that it was just the Mona in<br>the the beach and then the water wasn't<br>at fire and then after the visit<br>matakana appeared the Waka appeared as<br>well as the the puppy bed and that was a<br>sort of a point of uh oh I guess for the<br>ewe anyway wanting to dread the<br>yeah yeah and so<br>um that was interesting for the<br>tamarakian for the whanau as well<br>and so from that point on it was sort of<br>building more Corridor in terms of and<br>building off of what mature Des had<br>shared with us in terms of the pudako<br>um<br>and so the second visit back to my wall<br>gave the tamariki an opportunity so we'd<br>taken that all pre-pakiki this time we<br>took a few a few more tamariki some of<br>whom were from the the group below that<br>or pupaki care so that they were given<br>an opportunity to now share what they<br>had learned about mobile<br>um and so it was really nice to be able<br>to go back and revisit these same<br>um spaces that mature this had showed<br>them but also explore new spaces so this<br>time they were adamant some of them that<br>they would go up to the tea of the Mona<br>and there's lots of lots that sits<br>behind that which we<br>um spoke about yesterday and we sort of<br>have to unpack about the significance of<br>making it to the city to the top of the<br>manga<br>um but we wanted to share this little<br>um<br>is this going to work<br>oh hang on it's doing something<br>night<br>Sports<br>perfect<br>um so another thing that happened after<br>the second hidinger was the appearance<br>of this tamariki that went on these<br>hiding and we we got together and hit a<br>hiding her<br>um so firstly I'll talk about the<br>connections between our mokopuna<br>um it's really exciting and interesting<br>for our tamariki to learn about their<br>their and where they're from and it<br>really helps to create stronger<br>relationships between them it gives a<br>sense of belonging and it really<br>um it helps them to relate to each other<br>one of our parents spoke about how<br>her Tom Mighty was able to recite her<br>own pepeha but also Juan as people have<br>because of the research in the rangaho<br>and all the Mahi that altamariki had<br>done prior to going on this hidinger and<br>at home she'd get mixed up<br>about<br>um mobile um no call MoMa and she would<br>even though that was not true she was so<br>confident in her in herself that MOA was<br>hermonger and perhaps it was because of<br>the strong connection she was able to<br>make through her friend Juana<br>um<br>these connections really helped to<br>you know<br>it it<br>builds our mokopuna's confidence and<br>their self-esteem<br>um they know then that they are really<br>valuable and valued member of their<br>kohanga whanau<br>um I'll talk to the connections between<br>our parents so being able to partake in<br>these hiding along with our tamariki it<br>not only strengthens the relationships<br>between us and our tamati or our<br>tamariki but it helps to strengthen the<br>relationships that we have with our<br>other whanau<br>um we get to know each other we can make<br>we can<br>um find out oh you know maybe you're one<br>of my cousins because there's definitely<br>a lot of those connections<br>um and it helps us to understand that oh<br>sorry get to know each other a bit more<br>get to know the people who are helping<br>to nurture and raise our tamariki<br>alongside us as well<br>connections<br>foreign<br>to them they it's it's essentially like<br>another Mirai or Mariah<br>and when we're able to strengthen our<br>connections<br>um<br>it helps also to strengthen our kaupapa<br>as a kohanga<br>and we're all working together in unison<br>in order to create or or reach the best<br>um tribal connections<br>um so a lot of if not most of our<br>tamariki at our kohanga they have strong<br>whakapapa links to tearawa and in some<br>cases<br>we have tamariki who who don't who<br>up at two other areas so to be able to<br>to go outside of the Ottawa and<br>visit another area was really special to<br>them and I'll just share something for a<br>connection that I made personally for<br>with my for my daughter<br>um through because we knew and we had<br>learned about Juana's whakapapa who Pepi<br>on matakana<br>um alfano went back to our marai in um<br>and while we were looking around alfano<br>urupa I saw the ingwaifano McMillan and<br>uh tirangi hohiri which is Juana's marai<br>so I instantly made the connection came<br>back in and we found that even though my<br>daughter doesn't whakapapa tomorrow she<br>still has a connection to to her friend<br>and you know we can continue to to make<br>connections with the other tamarike as<br>well<br>um connections through loss<br>for the majority of our parents there<br>was a huge sense of loss<br>um in connection to whakapapa<br>a lot of them grew up without Maori<br>without knowing<br>not having a strong link to where<br>they're from so for them to be able to<br>participate in and see the benefits of<br>these hiding for their tamariki growing<br>up in Maori<br>it inspires them to go and to learn make<br>those connections themselves in order to<br>support their tamadiki even more so and<br>it's really a journey that it's not only<br>for automatic although they are the main<br>focus of all of our Mahi it's a whole<br>whanau Collective working together and<br>it's a massive Journey for all of us as<br>well<br>um spiritual connections it's this one<br>for me is quite a hard one to explain<br>because I don't it's not something you<br>can necessarily see it's a feeling<br>um it's an energy A vibe if you will<br>um but prior to the second hidinger Alta<br>mariki they were very excited very happy<br>to to be going back to my wall and once<br>we got there the<br>they were just very very settled I<br>noticed that my daughter she wasn't very<br>verbal on the hidinger but<br>she it wasn't because she was tired or<br>bored or anything it wasn't more that<br>she was absorbing her environment the<br>tire and and really taking in the<br>information that she had already learned<br>at kohanga<br>um it sort of added another dimension<br>so that's us but I guess at that point<br>we wanted to share is the way that we've<br>um that we see that Toyota and that<br>we've woven it together and it's not a<br>total that we see<br>um just down and then our kayako<br>alongside each other but the um our<br>whanauer there they are woven together<br>in many ways that overlap and create a<br>strong sense of what a strong<br>environment<br>can be recognized and so we hope that<br>they are a little kohat to you all and<br>and perhaps it might be useful to you in<br>does anyone have a few questions or a<br>um thank you so much Hannah thank you<br>also kindly appreciate it I was having<br>private stress over there<br>now our last presentation if you wanted<br>to go to the other stream now would be a<br>good time you've probably just<br>contributed welcome coming<br>um and our last presentation for this<br>particular stream is online<br>so we're just taking one moment for the<br>issues in this room and we're very<br>thankful for the ICT team for coming and<br>working through all of that with us<br>we're thankful for the two presenters<br>who went before<br>um for all their hard work for the<br>sharing of their stories that is deeply<br>deeply appreciated uh our last presenter<br>in this stream I need to hold it closer<br>sorry our last presenter in the Stream<br>uh Monica Cameron karen s Aspen and<br>Penny Smith<br>um they're they're going to be sharing<br>by Zoom so this may take us just a<br>moment to get together they're on the<br>zoom now we're just gonna<br>get that on the screen<br>um so they'll be sharing from there and<br>we might need a minute just to make an<br>uh okay Monica Karen and Kenny<br>um when you're ready yes you can share<br>your presentation and<br>um<br>get underway I think we're<br>I think we're nearly there<br>are they sure<br>oh okay<br>yeah oh<br>and oh yes remember to unmute very<br>important<br>can you hear us<br>we can hear you fantastic awesome uh<br>um we'd also just like to acknowledge<br>our colleagues Penny Smith and Tara<br>McLaughlin who are not able to be with<br>us today but who have been key members<br>of this uh the project that we're going<br>to be sharing with you and we just want<br>to acknowledge them um and uh sorry they<br>can't be with us but trust that we'll<br>um so it's my pleasure to just offer a<br>brief introduction to the project that<br>we're sharing on today<br>um this the Genesis of this program was<br>a few of the uh sorry this research was<br>a few years ago now as we uh looked to<br>the introduction of the of the refreshed<br>to fatiki uh we both uh our team all<br>work in initial teacher education we do<br>much of our Mahi is around encouraging<br>student teachers into safariki and using<br>it as an effective uh part of their<br>teaching Journey<br>um and we were really curious as part of<br>that role to to understand how teachers<br>that we were the teachers in the sector<br>were making use of tafariki as part of<br>their teaching journey and how there<br>might be a shift sort of post the<br>refresh we were really curious about<br>what it might bring about so we<br>established a project that collected<br>data in the immediate<br>um immediate period of time before the<br>refresh was released to the sector and<br>then we have been back this year to<br>collect data again several years post<br>the refresh implementation to see<br>whether there may have been shifts in<br>practice shifts and viewpoints shifts<br>and beliefs over that period of time we<br>are also hopeful though you never know<br>we're hopeful that in another five years<br>we might be able to go back and go<br>through this project again in the same<br>way and to see further shifts over that<br>um that sort of 10-year period we think<br>that would be really really interesting<br>and really valuable<br>um we started from the position of just<br>how much of a um Tonga we saw to fatiki<br>as being and really wanting to capture<br>that and to get an understanding of how<br>teachers were using this document this<br>Tonga and implementing and we're<br>implementing to fight as part of their<br>daily practice and also to try and get<br>an understanding of how teachers were<br>constructing their understanding of<br>curriculum<br>um how they viewed curriculum how they<br>enacted curriculum what they believed<br>about curriculum all sort of formed the<br>foundation of This research and so what<br>we're presenting today is just a very<br>small Snapshot from the 217 and 2023<br>data we'd like to acknowledge that we<br>literally only received the 2023 data<br>within a very short period of time so um<br>there wasn't the opportunity to have yet<br>dug deeply into the start room we look<br>forward to doing so and and in coming to<br>further presentations and Publications<br>that really do a deep dive into the a<br>wonderful data we've collected but this<br>is just a quick look on top of our<br>initial pass through in this trends that<br>we're seeing Kyoto we hope you enjoy<br>this<br>is<br>so in terms of having<br>um a bit of an overview of what we did<br>we sought to<br>um replicate the studies across the<br>different time spans and we started by<br>identifying a range of different types<br>of Early Childhood Services so mixed<br>stage under twos in kindergartens and<br>organize and set up interviews as an<br>integral part of that so talking with a<br>teacher and a leader in each of those<br>six um see things that we started with<br>alongside of those interviews we also<br>collected photographs<br>um of the indoor and outdoor<br>environments when children were not<br>present is through the evidence of<br>curriculum and how it impacted on the<br>environment that children had the<br>opportunity to engage with the<br>photographs that you'll see through this<br>presentation come from the most recent<br>round of data collection and highlight<br>some of the ways we were able to see<br>curriculum in the environment and<br>alongside the interviews and photographs<br>we also collected a range of documents<br>from the services involved that<br>highlighted<br>um the ways in which they shared<br>information about curriculum as a team<br>but also with parents whanau and Kim<br>unity and as part of that examples of<br>assessment as a way of<br>um<br>Gathering data about how assessment was<br>not only shared with families but it<br>also was informed by curriculum<br>as I said so in 2017 we had six sites<br>and we looked to replicate by going back<br>to their same six sites uh for what had<br>planned to be a 2022 data Gathering but<br>as you all know covert has um had a long<br>tail and had um impact and that wasn't<br>going to work for a number of of the<br>settings who'd participated the first<br>time but they were very happy to um to<br>do so this year so the data was<br>collected um in the earlier part of this<br>year and we approached those same six<br>settings<br>um but one seating chose not to<br>participate this time and one of the<br>settings had actually closed down so<br>we've ended up in the 2023 data set with<br>four settings and we replicated uh the<br>data collection methods and so those<br>have stayed the same but it's also<br>important to note that while we stayed<br>with the same six settings that<br>transferred into the four and they had<br>been Staffing changes within those<br>settings as well and those um<br>are going to be interesting to track and<br>so you'll see later on in the<br>presentation there's uh quotes there<br>from sitting one leader 2017 and 2023<br>for example but they're not actually the<br>same person it's the same position same<br>setting same position but different<br>people so that's going to be something<br>for us to unpack as we um delve further<br>into that data<br>so<br>um and of course data analysis<br>um we'll be using a range of tools in<br>that space But predominantly thematic<br>analysis and there's Karen um indicated<br>earlier the focus here is on um sharing<br>interview data along with some<br>photographs<br>um and the preliminary analysis of the<br>so I I get the opportunity to talk a<br>little bit around the question of what<br>is curriculum in our interview we we've<br>been talking with the teachers and<br>leaders we asked them to define and<br>explain for us what their understanding<br>of curriculum meant and we explored<br>um as Helen so beautifully talked about<br>the idea of curriculum and curriculum<br>framework and those sort of how that<br>terminology reflects how it is viewed<br>but<br>um so we got an understanding of of what<br>teachers really thought curriculum was<br>and we put a couple of quotes there that<br>we've drawn from across the data sets<br>for you to engage with<br>but what really was the narrative truth<br>that ran through both sets of data is<br>this idea that curriculum is a holistic<br>experience which seems so true to the<br>idea of tafariki and that um curriculum<br>is really that sense of everything that<br>happens in a newly childhood<br>um setting just about every teacher<br>referred back to that that wholesale<br>experience of coming into that service<br>and what that meant for for children<br>um we're looking at the 2023 data that<br>that same emphasis seems to have<br>continued on<br>um and what's really interesting is this<br>idea that curriculum is really something<br>that has become embodied in this idea of<br>local curriculum as well so something<br>the curriculum is living in breathing<br>and embodied and enacted rather than<br>being something that is just<br>intellectually<br>um explained or or noted it is something<br>that's really deeply inherent in who the<br>services are the people that are there<br>the community that is there that really<br>does create this embodied holistic<br>curriculum experience<br>um as can be seen in the quotes you see<br>those words holistic embedded integrated<br>uh come through really strongly<br>so throughout there's this confirmation<br>of of curriculum being seen as<br>encompassing and reflective of<br>everything that takes place in the daily<br>um life of an early childhood setting<br>um but we did see a shift in 2023 that<br>we're going to pick up on a little bit<br>later towards a shift in the um<br>understanding of the role of the teacher<br>in intentional teaching sitting<br>alongside that holistic play-based<br>so something that we were really<br>interested in is we're teachers<br>knowledge of tafatiki had come from<br>and when we looked at the original data<br>he we could see that teachers talked a<br>lot about their knowledge developing<br>over time as they had engaged with the<br>curriculum and I think that was<br>something that Helen noted in her<br>keynote earlier that we've had this<br>curriculum for 20 30 years now and we're<br>in other countries have changed<br>curriculum modified significantly<br>whereas in here in aotera and New<br>Zealand we've had the same consistent<br>curriculum that teachers have had the<br>opportunity to um really get to know and<br>to hopefully embed in their practice<br>they felt that they were very<br>um familiar with the content and they<br>identified their colleagues as being a<br>source of knowledge and helping them to<br>understand tafariki and for some teams<br>they acknowledged that there was real<br>strength in that continuity of safariki<br>and that it brought them together and<br>gave them a shared focus and an<br>opportunity for developing shared<br>understandings<br>but it was also important to note that<br>um there were<br>alongside their opportunities for what<br>Wenger calls dysfunctional communities<br>of practice where by teams may not know<br>that there were other ways of engaging<br>other ways of doing things because<br>um it becomes a little bit insular for<br>want of a better word and so what we<br>could see happening is some of the<br>questions we asked about<br>um<br>were<br>about<br>um the refresh so when we collected this<br>data everybody knew that a refresh<br>curriculum was coming there had been<br>some pld locally which teachers had<br>engaged in and so we asked them about<br>you know what do you think of the<br>opportunities here and some of what came<br>through was that opportunity to come<br>together and to learn and to learn from<br>a wider a wider group<br>and it does appear that um when scanning<br>the 2023 data and that just using<br>engaging with the refresh document has<br>again been a primary way of becoming<br>familiar with its content and as Helen<br>talked about earlier and it the refresh<br>version wasn't just on the Shelf it was<br>a new document it had come out and so<br>people teams and individuals were<br>unpacking it looking at the content<br>looking for similarities and looking for<br>differences<br>and what most participants did note<br>however was that there were few<br>opportunities to engage in sustained pld<br>that were focused on the refresh<br>document so while some had engaged in<br>their online pld that was available at<br>the time others reflected that they were<br>still looking for more pld in this space<br>and remembering that the starter was<br>collected almost six years after the<br>refreshed version had come out<br>but yeah that sense of uh an opportunity<br>to talk and collaborate and share<br>together it was something that um<br>participants<br>um really appeared to value<br>and when we looked at how to fight has<br>been implemented and teachers and the<br>participants in this study we've spoke<br>very very positively about safariki they<br>saw it as an important guide for<br>informing their day-to-day practice with<br>tamareki and they valued the curriculum<br>as a framework that supported and<br>acknowledged children and that shaped<br>their connection to family whanau and<br>Community as well<br>what was really interesting was that so<br>much of the participants understandings<br>of tafariki did appear to be implicit<br>and taken for granted and so when we<br>often initially asked interview<br>questions there would be some quite long<br>pauses at times as teachers in the<br>participants in the study tried to think<br>about that because so much of this um<br>that stance that Karen talked about<br>earlier of the curriculum being<br>everything and all the experiences and<br>the interactions with people places and<br>things<br>and those were all seem to be in a<br>living enactment<br>um but at times that became quite hard<br>to put into words they talked about it<br>we just do it and so then putting that<br>into words at times was a little bit<br>more difficult and they also<br>acknowledged that there is so much<br>strength within the scope of tafatiki to<br>allow for the diversity and that is<br>present within our communities and<br>within the different range of service<br>types in the sector<br>um but there was also<br>um space in which attention could be<br>created due to their um diversity where<br>it became really hard<br>um to know what effective curriculum<br>implementation might look like because<br>it was so varied for each different<br>setting<br>I<br>of notes many of the participants in the<br>study spoke positively of the refreshed<br>version and they talked about it been<br>much easier to navigate and the color<br>coding of the different sections the<br>inclusion of photographs for example and<br>but that they also really um appreciated<br>the more detailed information around the<br>roles and responsibilities of kayako<br>um<br>we seem to also be seeing um some<br>evidence that teachers are engaging with<br>the document as a whole in all of those<br>sections<br>um rather than just prioritizing the<br>strands and goals which we did here<br>quite a bit of in and the first round of<br>data collection we are thinking that uh<br>given the recent gazetting of the goals<br>and learning outcomes of tafariki that<br>that might be a trend that we continue<br>to see a bit more of over the coming<br>years<br>and given the research background that<br>some of our team had we were also really<br>interested to explore<br>um how teachers were navigating the<br>ideas of play-based learning and<br>intentional teaching and how those um<br>interconnected and the nature of um the<br>teaching and learning relationship that<br>was taking place we were really curious<br>to explore that<br>um when we first went into the the first<br>round of data collection uh pre-refresh<br>there was not a strong sense of an<br>articulation of intentional teaching<br>coming through particularly though when<br>you probed it was quite clear that it<br>was happening um it just wasn't perhaps<br>made explicit or verbalized in that way<br>it was quite clear that teachers were<br>describing very intentional practices on<br>their part but maybe not articulating it<br>within that particular lens and with<br>that um with that fear still you know<br>commented on that that risk of not<br>wanting to take over children's play or<br>not wanting to to cut across or to be<br>too adult directed the risk of moving to<br>something like National standards or<br>moving to the more didactic teaching<br>that might be seen with older tamariki<br>so<br>um in comparison and the data that we've<br>collected for 2023 we can see that<br>language of teaching coming through<br>quite a lot more strongly in the data<br>that we've collected which does reflect<br>its repositioning I think in the refresh<br>document where the teacher's role isn't<br>articulated a little bit more in the<br>place of intentional teaching has been<br>sort of highlighted and being part of<br>the narrative that's starting to build<br>still very much though we really want to<br>affirm still very much situated in as an<br>interplay at an intersection of play and<br>intentional teaching as being part of<br>Rich co-constructive experiences of<br>sustained shared thinking of<br>um that rich pedagogical understanding<br>of what it means to enact curriculum and<br>that really has come through a little<br>bit more strongly in the 2023 data<br>um they were much more explicit<br>references to um to intentional teaching<br>strategies uh to supporting inclusive<br>education and strategies to supporting<br>Learners with additional needs<br>um<br>and still that sense so coming through<br>that was quite clear in the 217 data of<br>teachers wrestling with their role of<br>try of wondering how to conceptualize it<br>how to understand where they might<br>position themselves on that Continuum<br>um and how to see these things how to<br>not lose the essence of play and freedom<br>and exploration investigation while<br>still also honoring the role of of<br>teachers and what they bring to the<br>um<br>and we are seeing that in that we can<br>note a really um really reflecting those<br>shifts that um Helen phrased so<br>beautifully earlier with increasing<br>sociocultural lens and an increasing<br>cultural lens as well coming to be on<br>shifting away from like traditional<br>developmental trajectories perhaps more<br>to much more<br>um detailed socio-cultural lenses and<br>how<br>um learning in relationship with people<br>places and things was becoming even more<br>so as Karen's just talked about the um<br>on the previous slide<br>we acknowledge the developing<br>understandings of intentional teaching<br>and that how they have supported<br>teachers to further and develop their<br>own understandings of their role in<br>supporting Children's Learning it's<br>really important to note that across<br>both data sets teachers still prioritize<br>the importance of play and the role of<br>child agency but can increasingly see<br>themselves in co-constructing<br>um within an alcohol relationship with<br>Learners<br>um<br>at this point we think that this<br>suggests a growing awareness of the<br>influence of socio-cultural theories and<br>the active role that teachers should<br>play in supporting children's learning<br>it also appears that um there is an<br>increasing recognition of teachers the<br>teacher's role in supporting um identity<br>language and culture as well as more<br>inclusive practices this more explicit<br>guidance for kayako um that is included<br>in the refreshed version and we can see<br>for some participants has supported them<br>to develop their understandings and to<br>change their practices but um is this<br>always the case less so for others<br>um evidence of this is potentially shown<br>when um comparing the quotes two of the<br>quotes we have here on the screen the<br>blue quote from a teacher in 2017<br>um which<br>describes a much more child lead and<br>perhaps piagetian informed role for the<br>teacher compared to the the two quotes<br>here from 2023 which demonstrate<br>um for these teachers and much more<br>they're seeing themselves in a much more<br>active role in supporting Children's<br>Learning<br>so as we bring the session into a close<br>as you'll be glad as we head towards<br>lunchtime we have bringing it to a close<br>we wanted to identify some of the<br>changes and challenges that we are<br>briefly seeing and and look forward to<br>exploring in more depth<br>um first of all we just want to<br>reinforce the Deep respect and I'm going<br>to use the word love that people do have<br>for tafariki and that was really evident<br>in our data there's a positive sense out<br>there generally around the refresh and<br>that it has been re-energizing<br>um it was I did find it surprising some<br>of the interviews to hear how people had<br>sort of really come to take the original<br>version of the photo he somewhat for<br>granted that had become sort of just on<br>the disk and maybe not utilized in you<br>know in regular practice whereas having<br>the new version had drawn them back into<br>the document and as you'll see in the<br>quote from setting four uh the teacher<br>who's been teaching for well over 30<br>years talked about her original<br>um document had no notes or anything in<br>it whereas the new version was filled<br>with highlights and Post-it notes and so<br>forth so it wasn't interesting analogy<br>we also want to acknowledge that in the<br>starter collection that teachers had<br>been in survival mode for a large period<br>of this time with particularly through<br>the covert and the lockdown experiences<br>we end and Beyond we know that there are<br>so many pressures on our sector that<br>have teachers really in in survival mode<br>in many ways and so that has<br>implications uh for engagement with<br>curriculum and we acknowledge that there<br>are still calls out there for genuine<br>interest in sustained pld that will help<br>services to really engage with the full<br>scope the depth and the breadth of<br>tafariki as this robust<br>um really complex document<br>um challenges that seem to persist will<br>be for teams to continue developing<br>effective communities of practice and I<br>would like to pick up here on a point<br>that Helen Heller noted which was to<br>fighting was intended for a fully<br>qualified teaching uh star you know<br>teaching that's what I'm looking for<br>teaching Workforce thank you<br>um and and that isn't the current<br>climate and so we are having Services<br>who are navigating both qualified and<br>unqualified staff to bring them together<br>to find to find unity in that document<br>and in their teaching so we remain<br>challenges around building those<br>effective communities of practice<br>um our recognition that<br>um of the longevity of tafariki and what<br>that means when you've had teachers who<br>may have been working in that document<br>for 25 years and then moving into the<br>new document versus for example our<br>graduates coming out from our programs<br>who have only ever known potentially the<br>refresh document and what that means is<br>they navigate their communities of<br>practice just and then as we look<br>forward it's around questions around how<br>what resources might sit around to<br>fatiki and what around assessment and<br>planning and all the other dimensions<br>that really take to fatiki and use and<br>build on its foundations to really guide<br>practice in other domains as again as<br>Helen said there were many areas<br>originally that we<br>tafariki was intended to address that we<br>now might need to look to supplementary<br>work to also to marry alongside so that<br>continues I think to be a maybe not a<br>so some takeaway messages that um we're<br>confident in that we see across the two<br>data sets is that tafariki is seen to be<br>guiding all that happens<br>um in early childhood education settings<br>here in aorturo New Zealand both back in<br>2017 and now in 2023 it is viewed as a<br>tonga for the Early Childhood sector and<br>is valued for its bicultural foundation<br>that it sets up for each and every Early<br>Childhood service teachers appear to<br>appreciate the revision and the<br>increased accessibility of particularly<br>the learning outcomes and noting that<br>the revision down to 20 was much more<br>manageable and accessible for teachers<br>teachers were able to talk broadly about<br>to baraki and but at times we're less<br>confident and explicitly describing how<br>it is implemented in their daily<br>practice<br>affirms the relational pedagogy that is<br>deeply embedded in early childhood<br>education here in aotearoi<br>um whilst also acknowledging that<br>challenges remain in balancing a childly<br>curriculum with the need to engage in<br>intentional teaching and these appeared<br>and this appeared to be a challenge that<br>was really forefronted for our<br>participants<br>uh despite the appearance of some<br>progress in relation to understandings<br>of intentional teaching this was not<br>necessarily consistent across all<br>so what next uh for us is we need to<br>move Beyond preliminary data analysis<br>um and analyzing the 2023 data and so<br>that we're then in a position to more<br>accurately<br>um compare that with the 2017 data<br>we're also hopeful that maybe in 2027<br>who knows that we might be able to go<br>out and collect data again to see where<br>our state of the sector and curriculum<br>is at that point<br>um and I imagine that Helen as a<br>historian would be happy about that that<br>we would capture this progress over time<br>and of course like is always the case<br>with research more dissemination and<br>more publishing and we've recently had<br>an article published in the waikato<br>Journal of Education<br>um around<br>the 2017 data with a focus on the<br>interviews and we need to bravely boldly<br>step into some analysis of the documents<br>and the photographs which for us is a<br>little bit out of our comfort zone and<br>so we need to get on and do that as well<br>as creating spaces to compare and show<br>how teachers implementation of<br>curriculum has changed in those<br>intervening years<br>so any questions I'll stop Shia that<br>yeah<br>if you'd take any questions or let<br>I think everyone's digesting<br>but um if anyone's got some oh keep<br>forgetting about this if anyone's got<br>some questions for these love lovely<br>people<br>um you would be able to find them on the<br>zoom and and message them throughout the<br>afternoon because I know sometimes it<br>takes a few minutes to Think Through<br>what's been presented<br>um thank you to our presenters and to<br>all of those who presented in the Stream<br>and thank you for everyone's quiet and<br>respectful attendance we're going to<br>stop now and go for<br>um<br>share screen<br>nine screen one uh<br>family time<br>so<br>you got all this right yep yep<br>cheers<br>I won't bother redoing your presentation<br>because it's in there<br>because<br>when we did it in suddenly yours was in<br>there<br>when they<br>there's a few more people coming in but<br>I think we just get started<br>at least maybe get the introduction<br>going<br>culturally<br>we've got people online totally yeah<br>okay<br>um<br>um<br>oh photos Sydney Harbor Bridge so this<br>is the last time we did this<br>presentation it was though you were<br>there weren't you ah in suddenly yeah so<br>that's why that's there anyway so um we<br>acknowledge the target defender of Todo<br>in terms of this presentation<br>um<br>I have to apologize or pay tribute to my<br>colleague Marion Decker who's on a<br>sabbatical in Europe at the moment in<br>the middle of the Paris riots<br>um we normally do this as a tag team<br>though<br>um bear with me if<br>um if we don't if it doesn't work so<br>yeah I always put lots of photos of Mo<br>of mohaw today and another one<br>um just to situate<br>um most of our most of our Kindergartens<br>so our um education for sustainability<br>Journey will cover<br>um these points so we're tracing the<br>Journey of the former what used to be<br>called Tauranga region kindergartens and<br>because there's no such thing as<br>Tauranga region we thought we'd better<br>come up with a new name<br>um but since 2008 focusing on the<br>expansion of the project beyond the<br>original two activists kindergartens to<br>the whole organization involving<br>um the Enviro schools movement now<br>called the tomata foundation our local<br>Regional in our local Regional Council<br>it references the challenges and<br>opportunities for children features<br>whanau and the com and our and Community<br>Learning our interactions with the<br>almari notably engaged with manafinua in<br>developing local curriculum which<br>acknowledges<br>and the encouragement of teachers and<br>children to be agents for change<br>and the challenge and challenges of the<br>status quo and also just briefly our<br>plan to become power<br>we call the power project to become<br>energy self-sufficient so just a little<br>bit about who we are we've up to 1300<br>plus children in 25 kindergartens and a<br>home-based Education Service we operate<br>in the coromandel and the Bay of Plenty<br>and our most southerly kindergarteners<br>is in murappara that we reopened after<br>being closed by our neighboring<br>Association<br>um and I think they love us down there<br>but they quite every time I go down<br>there again it petted well looked after<br>um so<br>um we're not for profit community-based<br>charity<br>um but we have bicultural relationships<br>with local ewe um based on the Treaty of<br>waitangi policy and uh taiwariki<br>um we have 100 qualified teacher<br>Workforce in ratio positions uh and<br>early learning we aim to have early<br>learning Partnerships with parents and<br>whanau<br>um<br>we like to think that we provide<br>authentic learning experiences with the<br>space and there was a comment on from<br>our recent era reviewers to say how huge<br>our grounds are I'd like to see them<br>bigger actually but<br>um there we are they're bigger than some<br>other places where it seems modern<br>centers are um pretty much at the at the<br>at the regulatory minimum<br>um but we aim in building<br>self-confidence Independence and<br>development individuality amongst our<br>um recently translated as the nest for<br>the the strong-heartedness for the young<br>um which I think is pretty was the<br>Gifted To Us by one of our um komatua um<br>uh when we when we changed our parking<br>our name as well<br>um<br>um so just briefly uh this PowerPoint<br>these are the rationales that we base<br>our our philos our um program on<br>um UNESCO a couple of comments from<br>UNESCO Julie Davis who's a um uh<br>lecturer or last I heard she was<br>hopefully still a lecturer at um<br>Queensland University and<br>um The Guiding principles of uh Enviro<br>skills empowered children sustainable<br>communities learning for sustainability<br>with Maori perspectives and respect for<br>diversity of people and cultures<br>so just very briefly our values aroha<br>being the best we can be and for the<br>good of children I won't go through the<br>Mana manaki Tanga and welcoming and most<br>recently in in respect of our journey we<br>added<br>um well I can't remember when but it's<br>reasonably recent it wasn't part of the<br>original package<br>because we recognize that that should be<br>a value if we're going to have education<br>for sustainability<br>um program<br>um uh we're blessed to work in beautiful<br>environments we honor papatuanuku and<br>with respect and dignity for now and<br>future generations and the reason the<br>natural world's in this because this is<br>the presentation done in Sydney and they<br>wouldn't have known what he was so<br>um<br>yeah that's a poster<br>or Banner that Enviro schools did for us<br>um that sets out our our journey we've<br>got it on the walls of our office and<br>there is a banner that you can hang but<br>every time we've tried to take it to a<br>lecture theater and stuff we can't find<br>anywhere to hang it on I don't seem to<br>have those they've the old days you had<br>coat hooks or something they're hanging<br>on but um I'll I will talk about that so<br>2005 two kindergartens joined the two of<br>our kindergartens joined the Enviro<br>schools in 2009<br>um soon after except I'll take some<br>responsibility for this soon after I got<br>there and hey what if we're doing it<br>such a good job and two why aren't we<br>doing it across the whole organization<br>so in 2009 the board it's a governance<br>policy adopted a policy for education<br>for sustainability they give it some uh<br>chutzpass some strength<br>um and was reflected in the um the<br>Strategic plan of 2010 to 2015.<br>um<br>in 2015 we managed to get two green gold<br>Reflections which is the highest status<br>or value that in Enviro schools and oh<br>there's various but some places two<br>teachers attended conferences and we<br>ended up talking to the<br>um Bay of Plenty Regional Council Who<br>provided us with with funding to run<br>some of our programs we have<br>relationships sorry strategic approach<br>we're on to okay cool got it<br>um so we have had a strategic<br>relationship with the Bay of Plenty<br>Regional Council particularly with<br>Academia particularly with this<br>institution you some of those were here<br>earlier Linda's worked with<br>umui kindergarten we've had previously<br>Jeanette's Kelly's work with papamoa<br>kindergarten and what else oh and the<br>home-based our home-based service as<br>well so and we've and um you know who<br>did the Avenues who was the who did the<br>Avenues one Jane Jane white did the<br>Avenue study Avenues kindergarten study<br>on on the language of<br>two-year-old yeah we're gonna get there<br>right because sometimes you say under<br>two the language of two-year-olds in in<br>the kindergarten environment so we see<br>it as actually taking a strategic<br>approach that it's within teaching and<br>learning but it's also within our<br>building so we've run programs across<br>the kindergarten all our kindergarten to<br>ensure that they're best they're making<br>best use of electricity and we're<br>necessary we've got more switches on<br>because you know in the old days you<br>walk there you turn the lights on<br>the whole place is you know and they<br>might not be not a child in the end but<br>the whole place is blazing with light so<br>putting switches on where you can you<br>can monitor it um has has improved our<br>electronic usage when we when we look at<br>our environments you if you come in<br>you're more than all more than welcome<br>come and have a look at advice you won't<br>see much plastic you won't see many<br>boxes<br>um because what we believe is a natural<br>natural environment having said that if<br>we've already got them we're not just<br>necessarily throw them out we make use<br>of them until they die and you will see<br>I think those big slides which<br>are really cool and you can't get them<br>other than in plastic so if you get them<br>in Wood probably cost you about it's not<br>particularly sustainable so<br>um it also appears it's a it's a focus<br>when we come to our policies and<br>procedures and as and as a professional<br>learning budget specifically<br>um for uh and borrow schools we have two<br>facilitators that we've trained as part<br>of the Enviro schools toymata foundation<br>and our partners as I say ewe uh LT is a<br>local territorial authorities<br>um we have a company called<br>sustainability options I've worked very<br>closely with us they're a not-for-profit<br>company which is pretty cool<br>um<br>and also other local groups such as the<br>Pacific Islands Community Trust and<br>we've established our new Pacifica<br>kindergarten in association with them<br>and then katikati the local Community<br>Trust sustainable Community Trust in<br>terms of I'll tell you a little bit<br>about the program that they've developed<br>up here but since this is a discussion<br>about how are you here better we better<br>just do about a couple of connections<br>um<br>so in the 2000 and sorry the 1996<br>version the only thing and this is I<br>suppose one of the one of the positives<br>about the review<br>um was that the only thing I could find<br>about<br>um<br>if you like about education for<br>sustainability was knowledge about<br>physical and spiritual significance of<br>the local community so we were quite<br>happy in the old olden days to hang<br>ahead on that but in in since 2017 I<br>think there's been a there's been a bit<br>of a sea change about education for<br>sustainability so you'll find free<br>statements like I could find there might<br>be more<br>um making connections between people<br>Guardianship and environmental<br>stewardship so I think the the move<br>towards uh education or sustainability<br>across our culture uh has been reflected<br>in in uh in the in the curriculum and<br>supports very much supports the work we<br>do so just on to some stories really<br>cool hopefully they'll find them cute<br>couple Marco's kindergarten a bit of a<br>shame that's called Pub Marcus got a<br>name before I got him it had a much more<br>we've got to pop a mark in the garden as<br>well so a lot a kilometer away the<br>papamoa coast kindergarten regular<br>excursions to the beach at papamoa and<br>there's a photo of them at the beach and<br>they found this drain there and it had<br>some pretty ugly colors stuff colored<br>liquid coming out of her so<br>the children were a bit concerned about<br>axles their Beach where they swam in the<br>you know went with their whanau and<br>families in the weekend and so um the<br>teachers there said well what are we<br>gonna what are we going to do about that<br>and so they checked out the grates and<br>the drains and there's a an old photo<br>this is quite an old story that um<br>Caroline Derby this is now at another<br>kindergarten who's moved on but<br>um they checked out the drains they went<br>um oh I'll go back I'm gonna go back one<br>and they what they did was they said in<br>the with the help of the teachers they<br>wrote to the council they said we want<br>to do something about that drain it is<br>not appropriate that that colored stuff<br>that looked really you know noxious was<br>coming out of what was a storm water<br>drain so they with the help of the<br>teachers they wrote to the council and<br>interestingly I think it was possibly<br>because it came from five you know four<br>or five worlds but the council we were<br>going to do something about that we<br>don't want the kindergarten coming down<br>on us so<br>um<br>um they did something and there's a<br>picture of the children seeing that the<br>truck that that's the truck that came<br>along that cleaned up the with a crane<br>um and they cleaned up the uh the drain<br>so so the next photo there it is it's<br>all nice and clean with the guy from the<br>council explaining to the teachers and<br>the children about what they've done so<br>it was not a it was a environmental<br>project that the children engaged in but<br>was also an opportunity for them to<br>provide advocacy for the for their<br>environment for their environment and<br>for the obviously for their environment<br>um generally<br>moving on to<br>um this is kavikari kindergarten uh it's<br>also I'm pretty sure it's a green a<br>green gold kindergarten under Enviro<br>schools and they had a regular Excursion<br>to a nearby pack which had a walkway for<br>what they what they decided what they<br>decided was or they should plant some<br>fruit trees<br>and I think they've planted a couple<br>hundred or something I mean some of them<br>have died and been stolen and all the<br>rest of it but<br>um over time and so it's becomes not<br>only is it beautifying the environment<br>but it becomes a resource for the<br>community as well so parents and whanau<br>will come along when the fruits ripe<br>hopefully they'll share it around and<br>don't rip it all off but um the the<br>kindergarten and the and the parents so<br>uh have been engaged in in developing<br>they call it the Cutty<br>Kathy kaiway not quite politically<br>correct<br>um for those that were here earlier<br>there's the Moa hikoi that's undertaken<br>by our<br>um well not here or in the other room<br>um by uh Mona Mona manganui kindergarten<br>um<br>another example is up in whangamata<br>our most northern kindergarten have been<br>in part of their excuses they've been<br>going to the local hour and again I've<br>been noticing that<br>um well not as clean as it could be and<br>I did hear<br>one of the Hui this morning about the<br>tunnel being the Guardians of the hour<br>and so part of their uh kaupapa is to is<br>to feed and assure that the tuna uh are<br>well looked after fed<br>Etc and therefore they can act as<br>Guardians for the<br>um<br>for the hour<br>uh<br>and then and then also further up in in<br>um and for the younger and this just<br>shows what you you can do this is<br>probably not something you'd find in<br>many home-based home-based services that<br>they stay at home what they don't they<br>don't stay at home up in in whitianga um<br>one of the home-based Educators provides<br>some udakawa leaves floated from her<br>neighbor's place and so in the in the<br>area they started planting the<br>bohutakawa in a in their and again in<br>the walkway and you'll see there that<br>it's been been labeled The Inspired<br>Creek because not only have they planted<br>them and actually they're looking pretty<br>tall now those ones yeah<br>um but they they maintain that that area<br>as well<br>um 30<br>um 30 of the car was uh were planted and<br>have been and have survived up until we<br>did this presentation<br>and that's it<br>any questions or comments<br>that was that was really quick the<br>Marion Marion would be more loquacious<br>yeah and I mean yes and to be fair we've<br>missed out other stories that some of<br>our other places do for the for the sake<br>of time yeah well I'm very I'm I'm very<br>proud of uh work that our our teachers<br>do and<br>um it's one of the features one of the<br>um what should I say one of the features<br>we look for in terms of when we employ<br>new teachers that they have that<br>disposition for the environment<br>um<br>or or an openness to it let's put it<br>I yeah sorry and yeah Mr Mr did the<br>PowerPoint about the power project come<br>up no sorry right I'll just very briefly<br>then say<br>um after we're done<br>um made our places as efficient as<br>possible with electricity well so what<br>next<br>so<br>um and we were lucky that trust power<br>which no longer exists unfortunately<br>trustpower had a system where you could<br>if you generated power you could<br>transfer it to a buddy I think this I<br>think it's still operating I think I saw<br>something in my last power bill but now<br>that's with Mercury I don't know how<br>long that's going to last so we took<br>advantage of that and we've invested<br>we've currently got 10 kindergartens<br>with solar panels on the on their roofs<br>and those 10 kindergarten support<br>another<br>in kindergartens with the generation so<br>um we aimed part of the plan was to be<br>uh Power self-sufficient by 2025 but<br>um be fair to say the the<br>Bayer plenty Regional Council over<br>recent times have cut the amount that<br>they're putting into the environment and<br>that's we haven't got the same access to<br>and Tech now of course Tech don't own<br>any trust power she don't know Tech does<br>our energy consumer trust over in<br>Tauranga they don't now own trustpower<br>so they don't have the same commitment<br>to get to supporting electrical<br>um but oh sorry I'm back in the camera<br>um so supporting Electrical uh Hardware<br>so those those changes are a bit<br>problematic for us yeah<br>yes<br>yes<br>so an example would be<br>um<br>come on<br>you've been there<br>no<br>sorry oh gosh so it'll come to me of<br>course but anyway as an example so we<br>have a small kindergarten OTA Morocco<br>which is in the far east as far east as<br>we go in our and<br>um as a result of the connection that<br>they have with the local Mirai there<br>we've we've held<br>um uh we had a two-day Enviro school<br>session held at their Mirai where they<br>were able to present their re what are<br>they doing the re<br>replanting the uh the hour to clean it<br>up essentially so that was part of the<br>collaboration and we had about 30 or 40<br>of our teachers turn up in their in<br>their non<br>require non-required time to attend that<br>Hui over two days and it was a noble<br>Mirai as well we do see as part of our<br>commitment to the toy Mata Foundation<br>that Maori perspectives should be<br>incorporated into the Enviro schools<br>movement and we ran a not a repeat but a<br>uh out and back of Welcome Bay<br>um where where I don't have to say I<br>didn't go to that one where where<br>teachers discussed Maori perspectives<br>and bringing them into the Enviro<br>schools frame yeah so the answer is yes<br>actually<br>we<br>um<br>we operate<br>my<br>no other other than other than we<br>operate our Fleet of vans that um<br>particularly now low socioeconomic areas<br>a fleet when I say Fleet I think it's<br>three or four<br>thinking<br>I can't remember the others this<br>Britain and<br>one other so that that actually does<br>take does take traffic off the roads by<br>by operating event I know it's petrol<br>ah<br>yeah yes because the answer to that yes<br>we have<br>um what's the right word everybody's on<br>a different Journey so yes we have three<br>as I say three green goals so that's the<br>top of the Environ schools pile and we<br>have some and I can't remember the<br>number there might be five they have no<br>no commandment or virus goals having<br>said that with the policy that we have<br>in terms of education for sustainability<br>requires certain actions on their behalf<br>the the Enviro schools<br>um processes sort of sit on top of that<br>um uh bypassing the policy it does give<br>us as As Leaders the right to be able to<br>go what are you doing about recycling<br>what are you doing about your power<br>um we would prefer that they were coming<br>on board and some of we've had I think<br>we've now got three or four of the new<br>of the non non-toy Mata Foundation one's<br>actually coming on and they're now have<br>done the bronze reflection so and it<br>might be another couple so it is a<br>journey yeah<br>is that way yeah yeah yeah<br>oh yes<br>okay<br>right oh<br>last<br>station before the<br>scenery<br>okay<br>um well see I've already jumped ever no<br>uh call Wendy Lee a hoe<br>foreign<br>I'm absolutely thrilled<br>um<br>with anticipation actually to share this<br>work somewhat nervous today I have the<br>privilege of sharing with you a glimpse<br>into the captivating narrative the<br>dynamic life of learning stories as we<br>delve into this presentation I want you<br>to imagine yourselves joining me on a<br>visual Expedition some of the slides<br>will unfold like a video I had 200<br>initially as well I don't any longer I'm<br>offering you a window into a world<br>teeming with imagery through these<br>glimpses I hope to provide you with a<br>broader perspective of the remarkable<br>Journey we have embarked on<br>however I acknowledge that our time<br>together<br>oh<br>outside<br>of the just the marshmallow that should<br>be good in Jesus Haley I'm not very<br>competent at the mouse no I don't know<br>if he does<br>click on there before you do it then you<br>okay let me see if I can get this mouse<br>yeah but this is<br>okay<br>so however I acknowledge that our time<br>together is limited and it's just short<br>just a little more maybe than 20 minutes<br>I can only scratch the surface of this<br>vast and ever-evolving Landscape of<br>learning stories but I am committed to a<br>capturing the essence and vitality of<br>learning stories during our time<br>together<br>I'm delighted<br>um and that to do this week but I'm a<br>little bit sad that Margaret can't be<br>with us because she certainly had hoped<br>to be here today and was very much<br>looking forward to the day<br>the wisdom and insights I've gained from<br>Margaret are measurable I feel an<br>immense responsibility to honor her work<br>at every opportunity that presents<br>itself Margaret's Journey has shaped my<br>journey and her influence has been<br>profound and I'm deeply grateful for all<br>that I've learned from her I'm driven by<br>a passion to uphold the Integrity of the<br>work and to share its transformative<br>potential with Educators in kayako from<br>aotearoa and Beyond<br>that which is nurtured blossoms and<br>grows<br>we have much to thank this amazing group<br>now if you<br>um look at I mean all of us know the<br>word that Margaret Helen Tilly and<br>tamity have done and the consultative<br>process was extraordinary the gifting of<br>the principles strains and metaphor by<br>Tilly and tamity and the deeply<br>thoughtful sociocultural frame of<br>belonging well-being exploration<br>communication and contribution was what<br>made this curriculum World leading and I<br>believe has been unmatched and processed<br>in consultation anywhere in the world<br>so let's take a look at a closer look at<br>this diagram which offers a glimpse into<br>the rich historical background that<br>shaped the development of learning<br>stories and as you can see it reflects<br>the sheer intensity of the work that<br>unfolded during the early stages of this<br>incredible journey involving a multitude<br>of passionate individuals one pivotal<br>project that emerged was the project for<br>assessing children's experiences it was<br>Margaret who secured the contract for<br>this groundbreaking Endeavor aiming to<br>explore how assessment practices could<br>align with the newly introduced fariqui<br>curriculum it was a shared understanding<br>among everyone involved that without<br>addressing this assessment issue we<br>would miss out on fully embracing the<br>benefits of this transformative<br>curriculum Margaret's remarkable Journey<br>took her through five distinct into five<br>distinct settings each offering a unique<br>context for her research she worked with<br>to help Congo real a child care center a<br>kindergarten a home-based setting and a<br>uh<br>here is a glimpse into the research<br>project in the kindergarten setting<br>which is the one I was involved with and<br>these are some images from The Great<br>Gate project<br>took place at insole kindergarten it was<br>about real work a real project no no<br>nothing ever when we talk about play<br>bass and all the powerful things inside<br>fatigue this was very visible inside<br>this part of the project<br>that this would for instance in this<br>context it would result in a new gate<br>for the kindergarten<br>throughout the project all were<br>encouraged to write narrative as they<br>observed children at Play<br>out of this work came the assessing<br>children's experiences in early<br>childhood this was the research report<br>and this was followed by a very<br>successful Resort that some of you will<br>recognize with a similar title<br>I'll always remember that moment when<br>Margaret came back to the group and<br>shared what she had been reading<br>everyone's observations and narratives<br>and she exclaimed I know what I'm<br>reading I'm reading learning stories it<br>was truly inspiring and we shouldn't<br>underestimate the significance of the<br>bringing together of tafariki and<br>Margaret's PhD focused on learning<br>dispositions it was a powerful<br>combination that sparked a whole new<br>understanding and approach to assessment<br>in early childhood education the concept<br>of learning stories resonated deeply<br>with us as it encompassed the essence of<br>Children's Learning and Development<br>honoring their unique dispositions and<br>strengths it was a turning point that<br>set us on a transformative path shifting<br>our mindset and practice towards a more<br>holistic and meaningful approach to<br>assessment<br>many of you will recognize this<br>framework and the contribution it has<br>made to Bringing understanding to the<br>underlying pedagogical principles<br>involved inside tafariki<br>then in 2001 Margaret wrote this book<br>which would be a seminal piece of work<br>on assessment and as she said in the<br>book when we began I think the<br>practitioners and I wanted to seize the<br>notion of assessment shake it around a<br>bit turn it upside down and find<br>something that was part of enjoying the<br>company of young children<br>let's go back 30 plus years when the<br>assessment culture and early childhood<br>education was negative deficit and<br>focused on endless document<br>documentation that had little to do with<br>curriculum and planning to support the<br>shift in learning stories a humorous and<br>Powerful movie was created by Julie<br>killick the film entertained and<br>delivered a message of change<br>highlighting the importance of valuing<br>children's strengths and adopting a<br>holistic approach to assessment it<br>became a catalyst for transforming<br>assessment practices sparking<br>conversations amongst educators<br>the first major development post safariq<br>was ketu autopi and involved a wide<br>range of people in advisory roles<br>coordinator roles and of course<br>the first trance resulted in nine books<br>we worked on this project for a decade<br>the first nine books on completion a<br>blessing was held in Trevor Mallard and<br>none of us should forget the impact that<br>he had on the Early Childhood sector<br>During the period where he was a<br>minister of Education<br>media here's Mariana who's now 21 years<br>old<br>um handing over ke towards Pai to Trevor<br>Mallard during the blessing this is<br>Margaret's granddaughter<br>Trish Nelly and Doreen launda with a key<br>Ministry of Education people involved<br>and here Margaret and I was Trevor<br>Mallard as co-directors<br>teachers and kayako contributed hundreds<br>contributed there was a total of 177<br>pieces of assessment and documentation<br>used in the project but hundreds and<br>hundreds more were sent to US during the<br>project<br>following the celebration we worked with<br>professional development providers<br>we then went out into the regions and<br>finding more intensive incentive work<br>was carried out<br>all the while the vision was nurtured by<br>the Ministry of Education who regularly<br>held to Hui tupu to keep the vision in<br>view encouraging the providers to work<br>collaboratively<br>how things have changed the project<br>culminated in 20 books on assessment<br>when the concept of assessment for<br>learning was framed as noticing<br>recognizing and responding it sparked a<br>transformative shift for many teachers<br>in kayakor it was like a homecoming a<br>return to the essence of what when they<br>entered teaching teaching profession in<br>the first place to Revel in the joy of<br>children's company and to be their<br>Curious companion genuinely interested<br>in their unique voices those were<br>exhilarating times we encouraged<br>teachers in kayako to release their grip<br>on Rigid planning and instead be fully<br>present with the tamariki and where they<br>Embrace this approach something truly<br>magical unfolded in those moments<br>connections were deepened insights were<br>gained and authentic learning<br>experiences blossomed it was a reminder<br>that the true art of teaching lies in<br>the ability to truly see hear and<br>respond to the Wonders that unfold<br>please hit the right button here is some<br>of the original documentation this was<br>written more than 20 years ago by Julie<br>all the while being totally responsive<br>to terminus deep curiosity about vacuum<br>cleaners and electricity a response of<br>kayako in action or Vicky when she wrote<br>about pihikiti and added a response to<br>the mother in her own language which<br>would be more poetic and Maori this is a<br>warm greeting to you and your son<br>pikikitty my heart is filled with joy to<br>listen to your son speaking about<br>papatuanugu he is a brave child to<br>embrace this language and customs<br>learning stories are not just confined<br>to a single learning story they embarked<br>on and they they have embarked on an<br>extraordinary Journey encompassing a<br>whole philosophy of documentation let me<br>fill you in on some of the exciting<br>range of narratives it entails first we<br>have the classic learning stories<br>capturing the unique journeys of<br>individual children then we expand our<br>Horizons to group or Community stories<br>celebrating the collective experiences<br>in within a group setting we also<br>Embrace stories that from home inviting<br>families to share their perspectives and<br>contributions to their child's learning<br>and of course we honor the most<br>important voices of all the child's<br>voice their thoughts ideas and<br>Reflections bring the narratives to life<br>there are also welcome stories warmly<br>inviting children into the learning<br>environment we value the power of the<br>family voice providing a platform for<br>families to express their insights and<br>aspirations and share their stories<br>um teachers stories reflect their<br>profession personal lives and their<br>relationships helping to build a<br>stronger community of Learners so<br>learning stories are not just a singular<br>tale they are a rich tapestry of<br>narratives that weave together the<br>voices and experiences tamariki whanau<br>and kayako together this documentation<br>creates a comprehensive and vibrant<br>picture that truly captures the essence<br>of learning and growth<br>a window into a response from a whanau<br>written after the story written by a<br>teacher called your special Tyler Karen<br>um dear<br>um Dean um the grant this is the<br>grandfather of the child he responds<br>what a thoughtful account Karen thanks<br>for sharing us with us but I'm not going<br>to share it all I'm just going to share<br>at the end of it<br>look into the Tonga and you will see<br>Tyson there this is him explaining where<br>his green stone came from the shape<br>signifies Tyson's creativity passion and<br>energy the marble coloring holds<br>prouder's Blended Maori European and<br>nuean Heritage his strength and courage<br>his compassion and empathy are the<br>rigidity and texture of the ponamu the<br>Tonga is special because<br>makes it so that's what you call<br>connection<br>and then in 2017 responsibilities to<br>refresh to fariki strengthening the<br>bicultural curriculum and obviously<br>others are talking about that<br>Margaret Carr and brown and Cowie<br>developed this logic model that outlines<br>the concept of consequential validity<br>this model illustrates the process of<br>building a learning community and<br>fostering con continuity in order to<br>support the development of competence<br>and lunar identities these outcomes are<br>significant in and of themselves it is<br>in my opinion a very real view of what<br>is happening in well-functioning early<br>childhood settings around the<br>documentation of learning stories<br>a learning story that captures and<br>brings to our Maori lens by a parkour<br>teacher in this case Catalina this is<br>what it looks like in the portfolio no<br>time to share<br>these stories<br>taste<br>these stories woven into the fabric of<br>the Early Childhood Center setting<br>children sharing their stories<br>engaging in their learner identity<br>over more than two decades we have<br>shared the work of learning stories in<br>many countries I will just give you a<br>brief window into China Germany and the<br>USA very brief<br>some countries we've worked with on<br>long-term projects within settings for<br>example in China I will share a little<br>window into some research I carried out<br>with a group of Chinese teachers from<br>various regions of China just a little<br>of their commentary when when thinking<br>about the impact of learning stories in<br>their settings<br>after learning and writing learning<br>stories what we found was a time of wow<br>a child's strength a change in mindset<br>and we found a competent and capable<br>learner so those loved self-confident<br>imaginative little painters poets<br>Architects small mathematicians small<br>scientists have appeared before us it's<br>a revolutionary change I like it a lot<br>or<br>someone else after writing learning<br>stories I'm curious about children and<br>about what they do every day I<br>understand children more they're also<br>more willing to tell me their thoughts I<br>trust them more and I believe they are<br>competent Learners rather than that I<br>have to teach them everything I become<br>more willing to give them more time and<br>space they constantly surprised me with<br>the and their potential is endless<br>we have worked in many cities in Germany<br>and now have a strong Collective of<br>passionate practitioners who are leading<br>the work in this country but just to<br>show you a little of um<br>the work of zolder who was originally<br>teaching in Teachers College in teaching<br>student teachers retired and then began<br>working refugees but she realized these<br>refugees were not receiving any success<br>when they came to applying for jobs so<br>she started writing learning stories<br>about these young men and this is just<br>like like a little window a tiny window<br>into one of the stories with some of the<br>visual visuals that were inside the<br>story and here's a little of the sort of<br>thing she was saying<br>now<br>now you are visiting a technical college<br>with German as a second language your<br>class teacher informed me that you are a<br>good pupil she described you to be such<br>as we know you in the refugee camp you<br>make friends easily you are friendly you<br>take good care of yourself and others<br>you are attentive and you are reliable<br>for you school is your job your chance<br>for a future well what happened was they<br>started getting jobs through the use of<br>these stories<br>and finally the USA<br>matches happening across New Year's Day<br>but I want to share the work of<br>particularly associate professor Annie<br>white from the California state of<br>University Channel Islands<br>work started in California state Channel<br>Islands in 2009 Elizabeth Quintero came<br>to a keynote on learning stories in<br>England and was inspired by the work and<br>subsequently she began integrating the<br>work into Early Childhood department at<br>this University the book on this these<br>are some of her books so you can see<br>that she was already deeply involved in<br>a culture of of story and that book<br>story and learning in early childhoods<br>is where she really begins to Explore<br>because of this work Annie white who had<br>already become passionate in learning<br>stories had been here on several visits<br>wanted to work at this University<br>and so I I've obviously got no time to<br>go through this entire timeline but what<br>I want to do is just show you some of<br>the work that's been done in this<br>University and how the work of learning<br>stories has developed inside this<br>learning story I think it will give us<br>some quite a an interesting point of<br>reflection<br>in the first instance for instance the<br>students experience write these sort of<br>experiences of writing their own stories<br>um as when<br>around what who they were as a child<br>um students on practicum begin to<br>experience the power of stories written<br>by local teachers because they are also<br>the student lecturers are teaching the<br>teachers in the community about learning<br>stories this learning stories was<br>written for a homeless family and<br>challenged assumptions about the<br>homeless when four family members<br>responded to the learning story<br>this is an incredible program a special<br>course of paper called my story based on<br>the learning story framework which can<br>be taken up by any student across the<br>full University where students write<br>deeply about their lives and think about<br>their future using the framework the<br>story The analysis what did I learn<br>about myself the third part what am I<br>um here is Barbara's story for example<br>the story honors diverse lived<br>experience social and cultural capital<br>relationships with peers and<br>acknowledges the important people that<br>have influenced identity their identity<br>here are some examples or some reasons<br>that students write learning stories to<br>exemplify their Public Service Learning<br>their Community engagement and family<br>and School interviews<br>and they are also used in the students<br>final assessment where the learner<br>writes a final assessment report and the<br>lecturer the University staff respond to<br>it<br>obviously one of the places that's made<br>um The Learning stories visible across<br>the globe have been the books Margaret's<br>book on assessment has been translated<br>into other languages here are examples<br>from Italy Japan Denmark and China<br>likewise these books have attracted<br>translations this book included the work<br>of both learning stories and planning<br>stories<br>there have been chapters and books about<br>learning stories<br>fabulous affirming statements by people<br>like Professor Mary Jane Drummond from<br>Cambridge University who said the New<br>Zealand model of learning and assessment<br>and the narrative method as narrative<br>method at its core have I believe<br>enormous impact for educators in other<br>places in adopting the dominant metaphor<br>of story in place of the tape measure or<br>long jump educators are committing<br>themselves to taking the child's<br>Learning Journey seriously as a process<br>in its own life with its own life in<br>living landmarks or Tom Drummond who<br>writes so beautifully on his website a<br>learning story engages listeners in an<br>adventure of childhood enlivened with<br>our own humanity and heart become a<br>Storyteller and share your voice<br>or Deb Curtis and Margie Carter we<br>particularly favor the approach for<br>assessment that is used in New Zealand<br>with the tool referred to as learning<br>stories and hope it becomes widely used<br>in the USA<br>other people are writing their own books<br>on learning story Sabella Hess in<br>Germany wrote the first book but she<br>came to New Zealand had deep<br>collaboration with Erp before she did<br>this the youth Institute wrote several<br>books culminating in what was referred<br>to as the yellow Bible but that is<br>definitely another story more recently<br>Cornelius schreider has written a book<br>focused on learning stories<br>Professor Cato from Kamakura Women's<br>University in Japan has written books of<br>how others in Japan Jane Jail from China<br>has been involved in writing three books<br>on learning stories Jane has been my key<br>translator my work in China and finally<br>The Fabulous work in the USA written<br>about learning stories and teacher<br>inquiry groups reimagining teaching and<br>assessment in early childhood education<br>oops I'm going to go past those sorry<br>learning stories make learning visible<br>strengthen relationships build identity<br>of the learner Engage The Family Support<br>transitions evolve into planning stories<br>and stories of interest and contribute<br>to accountability grow a community of<br>Learners embed into an evaluation or<br>action research integrate professional<br>learning and provide opportunities for<br>appraisal and opportunities for all to<br>contribute<br>so just in finishing off crafting<br>impactful learning stories means that<br>you will forever be woven into the<br>tapestry of children's lives I have no<br>doubt that many of the stories teachers<br>in kayako have penned will be passed<br>down through the generations with these<br>tamariki reading them to their own<br>grandchildren just imagine the<br>incredible Legacy and lasting impact of<br>these narratives carrying the essence of<br>their experiences and growth in those<br>cherished moments as the pages of these<br>stories are turned and the words come<br>alive once again the bond between past<br>and present between kayako and Luna<br>remains unbroken it is a testament to<br>the power of our words and the profound<br>influence we have in shaping The<br>Narrative children's Journey so as we<br>all embark on the beautiful task of<br>writing learning stories remember that<br>your words have the potential to<br>transcend time and touch the lives in<br>ways you may never fully comprehend your<br>stories will be cherished and treasured<br>forever connecting you to the hearts of<br>those you have nurtured along their<br>learning path so write stories that make<br>a difference recognize the Privileges to<br>enter children's lives in this way this</p></main><footer style="margin-top: 2rem; background: #0001; padding: 2rem; text-align: center;"><p>We Are The University</p><ul
