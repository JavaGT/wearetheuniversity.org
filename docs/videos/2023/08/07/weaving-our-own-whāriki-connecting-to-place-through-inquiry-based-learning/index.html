research<br>um colleagues today<br>Research into inquiry-based learning I'd<br>also just like to point out that we've<br>got two about<br>the centers here as well today so we'll<br>have to do some introductions after this<br>so it's pretty exciting<br>um we're also doing this in a hybrid way<br>just to complicate things<br>um so some of our research team are<br>online today<br>um so online we have got Joe Perry Mary<br>Liz broadly and also fee mcalevy okay<br>and then I will just pass you on to<br>um<br>looking forward to some interesting<br>discussions<br>foreign<br>so we're going to begin today with some<br>pre-recorded slides from our colleagues<br>online and then we're going to finish<br>like in the 21st century is increasingly<br>complex rapid technological<br>advancements and Global responses to the<br>sustainability are having a<br>transformational impact on education in<br>all sectors these conversations are<br>impacting on how we view childhood<br>learning and our roles as kayako current<br>literature suggests that the skills and<br>dispositions required to navigate an<br>increasingly complex World include<br>developing creativity communication<br>problem solving skills and global<br>citizenship amongst others<br>developing these skills in response to<br>real world problems supports even the<br>youngest of tamariki to understand their<br>environment and their role in it however<br>McLeod and geodielo argue that childhood<br>must not be viewed as a preparation for<br>the future but that child should be<br>situated as being present in their own<br>place and time<br>Safari key aligns with this view<br>aspiring that all children become<br>competent and confident Learners and<br>communicators healthy and mind body and<br>spirit secure in their sense of<br>belonging and in the knowledge that they<br>today we are presenting our current<br>research exploring inquiry-based project<br>learning in early childhood education<br>and aotearoa there are multiple ways of<br>describing this approach including<br>investigations Project work inquiry and<br>enrichio Emilia as project zazioni which<br>translates as flexible learning<br>the wide range of terminology describing<br>this approach was likely due to the<br>Myriad of influences that have shaped<br>teachers thinking<br>for the purpose of This research<br>we have created the term inquiry-based<br>project learning as a broad term to<br>Encompass all of these approaches<br>consistent across all these<br>interpretations is the positioning of<br>both tamariki and kayako as active<br>participants in the learning process<br>this approach allows the time and space<br>for tamariki to explore their local<br>environments discovering answers through<br>collaboration as children represent<br>reflect on and discuss their thinking<br>the emphasis of this approach places on<br>collaboration is particularly important<br>as this Fosters into subjectivity the<br>capacity to listen to others and the<br>ability to appreciate and accept diverse<br>points of view<br>whilst developing the skills attitudes<br>and dispositions critical for navigating<br>the 21st<br>century<br>has been recognized globally for a<br>spicultural framework and the way it<br>offers key principles for curriculum<br>development without prescribing a<br>particular approach the ability for each<br>setting to weave their own curriculum<br>has given kayako and aotearoa the<br>autonomy to choose to incorporate<br>inquiry-based learning into their<br>teaching<br>the curriculum suggests that being<br>curious posing questions developing new<br>ideas testing them evaluating and<br>linking them to previous knowledge and<br>experience is how tamariki create<br>meaning<br>the five learning strands all align with<br>the principles of inquiry-based project<br>learning however it is the well-being<br>strand that particular is particularly<br>relevant to this presentation the Strand<br>emphasizes that tamaruki should<br>experience responsive environments that<br>support the development of self-worth<br>identity confidence and enjoyment<br>together with emotional regulation and<br>self-control<br>further tafariki recognizes that<br>understanding who you are and where you<br>come from assists tamariki to become<br>grounded in who they are and as a result<br>better equipped to navigate change<br>the two tenets of working theories and<br>learning dispositions woven throughout<br>tehariki are both valued with<br>inquiry-based learning approaches some<br>of the reflective questions for kayako<br>in the 2017 version of the curriculum<br>also align closely with inquiry for<br>example Hamad kayako create and model a<br>culture of inquiry amongst children<br>and what opportunities exist for<br>children to participate in longer term<br>product projects that support the<br>development of their working theories<br>what the curriculum does not provide is<br>guidance on the pedagogical processes of<br>initiating or sustaining inquiries with<br>tamariki<br>would be the need for further guidance<br>surrounding how to initiate and progress<br>collaborative inquiries with tomodiki<br>that has led many early childhood kayako<br>and alterior to study the international<br>discourse on this approach<br>it was in the 1980s that the work of the<br>infant and toddler centers and<br>preschools of Reggio Emilia became<br>world-renowned for their social<br>constructivist approach to education and<br>captured the attention of Early<br>Childhood kayako in this country<br>this approach positions children as<br>Citizens in their own right and aims to<br>teach children what it is to live in a<br>democracy<br>a key aspect of this approach to the<br>long-term investigations tamariki and<br>kayako engage in<br>the project approach conceptualized by<br>cats and chard has been another key<br>influence on teachers thinking in this<br>context<br>whilst examining these ideas can have<br>deep value for kayak or particularly in<br>provoking them to reconceptualize the<br>images of learning tamariki and the role<br>of the kayakor<br>it has also been argued<br>that the potency of the international<br>discourse could potentially overshadow<br>localized theories philosophies and<br>approaches and of particular importance<br>indigenous voices and priorities<br>there is in fact a long history of<br>inquiry and inquiries here in aotearoa<br>this history begins with Maori as Tana<br>tafinua who have been inquirers since<br>the beginning of time<br>Maori Tracee genealogies back to time<br>the epigenic ancestor who went on a<br>quest to find knowledge of how to live<br>in the world<br>that feat set a precedent for the<br>pursuit of knowledge and inquiry for<br>subsequent Generations<br>thus from a Maori worldview<br>whakapapa encompasses inquiries<br>inquiry-based learning as people seek an<br>understanding of their interconnected<br>relationship with<br>the natural world<br>and how to nurture strengthen and honor<br>I'm going to discuss the aims of the<br>study whilst inquiry-based project<br>learning is now an established approach<br>in early childhood sector near Terra<br>little research has been conducted on<br>how this approach has been interpreted<br>in the context and in particular how<br>both International and localized<br>theories and ideas about inquiry have<br>shaped Early Childhood teachers<br>practices here<br>This research aimed to address this Gap<br>it's sought to understand more about the<br>range of influences that shaped how<br>kayaka work in this approach and what<br>aspects of these influences have been<br>impactful the research has also examined<br>differing interpretations of inquiry<br>space learning play out in the classroom<br>and what it means for children's<br>learning<br>to follow on we'll just talk about the<br>study<br>design this project is underpinned by<br>our bioecological and social cultural<br>theories which recognize knowledge is<br>constructed and is influenced by a<br>complex web of contextual perspectives<br>and Associated histories the<br>mythological framework draws Upon A<br>Narrative inquiry which supports the<br>values we hold for the stories of the<br>Early Childhood teachers and the<br>communities collaborating and this<br>research phase one<br>comprise a qualitative questionnaire set<br>out to all Early Childhood centers<br>registered on the National Database of<br>ECE Services phase two has involved<br>working with a small number of<br>purposefully selected Services across<br>airtr we aim to capture a diverse range<br>of cultural and physiological<br>perspectives across the range of<br>geographical locations we are currently<br>immersed in this phase but have so far<br>completed data collection at six centers<br>at each setting we have<br>conducted a semi-structural interview<br>with teaching teams and observed a<br>current inquiry we're in the midst of<br>the world now so phase one findings with<br>63 Early Childhood centers that<br>responded to phase one<br>and within the questionnaire so it was a<br>survey questionnaire that was<br>qualitative and within the questionnaire<br>we had a question on theoretical<br>influences and the settings talked about<br>with theoretical influences the main<br>influence being Reggio Amelia<br>the second well-being predominantly<br>project approach and the third one was a<br>small number of participants<br>who just shared sort of aspects around<br>inquiries that were immersed in<br>matarangimara and turfariki and<br>socio-cultural theories<br>the values evident<br>inquiry-based project learning approach<br>share not not really things that are<br>unique to us within the teaching<br>profession in in New Zealand but but<br>they bring about sort of the the depth<br>of how we're able to Through The<br>Inquirer is Foster deep learning<br>um and that's that's been seen to<br>develop higher socio more emotional<br>competences and the metacognitive<br>capabilities of children so turmerica<br>agency relationships<br>dispositions are all evident through<br>laws inquiry<br>projects and the inclusive nature of<br>those is actually quite profound because<br>children are able to move in and out of<br>projects projects<br>invested as their interests to determine<br>several challenges were identified from<br>across the case study centers<br>and one of the one of those sort of kept<br>coming through and that was about<br>support for new team members so if<br>you've got new people joining your team<br>who weren't familiar with inquiryness<br>project<br>ways of doing and ways of being<br>some teams have developed specific<br>um<br>Frameworks and models that were there to<br>support other<br>new team members as they joined other<br>challenges were not always knowing how<br>to progress an inquiry over time<br>and I don't think that's dissimilar to<br>teaching in general but but sometimes<br>you know with those projects it was<br>about<br>asking those questions as a team as well<br>not always knowing the next steps and<br>again we've got the similarities coming<br>through but those next steps part of<br>those were being discussed not only as a<br>team but with with those children<br>involved in those inquiries<br>and again we've got similarities coming<br>through that it's well known that our<br>profession is time poor<br>so with sort of the impact of covered<br>and everything else as with inquiries<br>there they've you know sort of suffered<br>from from issues just around how<br>projects we documented and how they<br>could be made more visible but also<br>challenges around<br>um teacher time and child ratio and<br>resourcing<br>some examples when settings were asked<br>to share examples of practice and if<br>anybody's interested the next<br>presentation is going to go on to share<br>a center working with the inquiry-based<br>project approach but what we were<br>finding with General responses were the<br>what the law class curriculum and we've<br>heard about that this morning from from<br>the first um from one of the<br>presentations from the kindergarten was<br>very very prominent in those inquiries<br>so it was almost that Central sort of<br>focus as well so connecting to local<br>place and making connections to<br>bicultural practice that was naturally<br>sort of embedded within those projects<br>um so some preliminary findings our<br>teachers are learning about inquiry<br>predominantly through International<br>materials you know we've got access to<br>the world now so those International<br>materials not only through attending<br>workshops<br>um are actually are actually there<br>online as well<br>um but what's really striking from that<br>is that centers are developing their own<br>pedagogical approaches to support<br>inquiry learning in in their own context<br>so it's just we've got that depth and<br>we've got that meaning happening<br>um and again you know our current<br>inquiries we've you know we're here to<br>celebrate hurricane<br>um again you know inquiries are just<br>smothered you know in into for Ricky<br>that's part of of what's Happening as<br>well<br>so<br>um so so we've found that all six<br>teaching teams have spent considerable<br>time developing the pedagogical<br>approaches and there's some similarities<br>and some differences at each set in a<br>core group of kayak have been working<br>together for several years allowing for<br>really deep pedagogical discussions and<br>that has shared um sort of you know<br>they've got those shared understandings<br>as they're emerging<br>um so again that means just just moving<br>through teaching teams have spent time<br>on deciding theoretical ideas that<br>underpin their arms Center work in<br>theories so that's been part of that<br>um and they've developed pedagogical<br>processes that have been sort of you<br>know refined over times as well so<br>there's nothing static in any of that<br>the change the change in things as they<br>go<br>um two settings with larger teams little<br>doves and daises have developed clear<br>guidelines<br>um which support clerical through the<br>process can establishing inquiries and<br>progress in those inquiries as well and<br>they found that you know such a<br>framework really really helps not only<br>in those teachers feeling that they've<br>got a place in those inquiries but you<br>know the the ongoing opportunities for<br>for tamariki as well<br>um and again sort of the international<br>discourses have come into to supporting<br>their approaches alongside their own<br>their own context<br>um<br>so just to run through quickly<br>um some of the centers we've worked with<br>so so all of the inquiries that we<br>observed already had a connection to<br>place in varying ways so for example<br>um we looked at little doves in Auckland<br>which had two-year-olds looking into the<br>Curiosities of acorns<br>um daisies was an early childhood in<br>Education and Care Center in Wellington<br>where they were looking into Notions of<br>community and then we've got Little<br>Pumpkins who and when we was visited<br>them were looking exploring children's<br>working theories related to outer space<br>I'm going to talk a bit more about their<br>process after this<br>um<br>this is an example from toy or Hawaii<br>Center in Tauranga and so they are<br>overarching inquiry has been focused on<br>local connection to local place for the<br>last three years and so more recently<br>the kayako and tamariki have been<br>exploring their<br>um their local prodako so Helena the<br>head teacher says that the local<br>curriculum is really important to us<br>that's really important that children<br>know where they come from and the<br>stories the stories of their place and<br>she gave an example of where the<br>teachers had had shared a product that<br>didn't really relate to the area and the<br>children weren't really interested but<br>when they ended up discussing moo<br>children became really engaged and we<br>did have a little video but seriously<br>said we'll skip that so there's a little<br>video if you want to see it I'm sure we<br>can see it they can you can play it<br>through the slides<br>um yeah and this is an example from<br>pakaranga Baptist kindergarten and so<br>they've also been looking exploring<br>connections to local place for several<br>years and children here had been<br>theorizing about the creatures that<br>might live in the local history and and<br>in response the cargo introduced their<br>um who fell in love with the tech<br>who's which is now known as a premier<br>Basin and so this really captured the<br>interest of of one tomato and they ended<br>up making a plan to create<br>um<br>and they work really intensely to<br>realize this plan and they had this<br>inquiry into this product that carried<br>on over several weeks and they ended up<br>even making a stop-motion film around it<br>so I'm gonna that was a very quick thank<br>you right sure it was a bit so well<br>um another Center that we worked with is<br>Remo kindergarten it's a pseudonym and<br>they were beginning their Journey with<br>inquiry and so they decided to do this<br>by dedicating time every day to visit<br>their local naheri and what was really<br>fascinating for two of us were in the<br>center researching was watching the um<br>the children slow down through that<br>opportunity to go to at the same place<br>every day over time they became really<br>familiar they took on leadership roles<br>they took on the role of being quite<br>yakitanga and they slowed down and began<br>to use the visual arts particularly to<br>draw pictures of the Bush and the<br>discoveries and take digital photographs<br>right discussion<br>so the inquiries we have observed have<br>demonstrated how this approach supports<br>tamariki to learn about how to work in a<br>group listen to each other share ideas<br>and work collaboratively to solve<br>problems as they engage in these<br>inquiries they're developing many of the<br>skills and dispositions to navigate<br>their lives and learning we see that<br>inquiry-based project has the potential<br>to challenge kayako to readdress their<br>roles and position themselves as<br>co-researchers and collaborators<br>alongside tamariki as they learn the<br>kaiko participating in this research<br>strive to honor children's ideas and<br>working theories as a core aspect of<br>their shared inquiries we argue this<br>approach provides a shared focus and<br>sense of purpose that every member of<br>The Learning Community can contribute to<br>each day we think this is particularly<br>significant given the complex challenges<br>both families in early childhood<br>teachers and the sector are currently<br>navigating<br>we've discovered that the impact of<br>prioritizing collaborative inquiry<br>results in unhurried time for tamariki<br>to explore and develop working theories<br>in kayako were supported to observe<br>closely and to respond sensitively to<br>Children's ideas I'll hand over to you<br>through the inquiries we observe we have<br>seen Heritage communities working and<br>wondering together about what konga can<br>be found in their place researching the<br>histories and stories of their place<br>considering what connections can be made<br>as they explore the places surrounding<br>these sitting and thinking about how<br>they can contribute to Cuba people said<br>there is a big emphasis an employer<br>inquiry-based project reading on<br>um you know whakapapa<br>um based proteins so as such I've jumped<br>a few lines but as such we suggest that<br>when this approach is combined with the<br>focus on place it has the potential for<br>both karaku and tamalaki to deepen your<br>understandings related to the unique<br>relationship that Maori have with the<br>funeral and cultural practices and<br>preferences as come for funerals<br>so<br>um but there are some wonderings so some<br>of my wonderings like whilst we see<br>these narratives collected off roots are<br>Wanderer and offer Rich possibilities<br>for conceptualizing curriculum that<br>honors the ideas of communication values<br>their interpretations<br>and the possibilities and we also<br>recognize that there are many<br>complexities in play here and that this<br>is a pathway that must be navigated with<br>care<br>so I've just sort of we also see a need<br>for all moving Parts in education sector<br>to be thinking in in this space and<br>including the ministry if any Ministry<br>people here<br>um initial teacher education providers<br>Early Childhood in all the sectors of<br>Education to work more cohesively in<br>order to navigate these completes things<br>and develop the capacity of kayako to<br>share information resources so we've<br>kind of got these questions you know I<br>don't have the answers but I've got<br>wonderings we've got wonderings how can<br>Early Childhood guard against<br>interactions that reproduce an imagined<br>partnership between Maori and pahijika<br>where teachers and students enacted by<br>cultural narrative that maintains<br>lopsided Notions of partnership that<br>Advantage for advanced par here group<br>interests<br>what role can inquiry-based project<br>learning play in upholding by cultural<br>expectation expectations and the<br>commitment held by Tiffany who benefits<br>from inquiry-based Project learning and<br>how do we know and those are examples of<br>how kopapermani Theory can go during<br>your practice just as a little example<br>of what it can do and what are our next<br>tips and I'd like to finish by just<br>talking about our the title for the<br>slide<br>itera this is a concept I gained from<br>it's about standing before the sun to<br>face the day and in so doing you receive<br>all the nourishment you need to be vital<br>so if we stand before tifaraki in the<br>same way to guide us in our practice we<br>can continue to seek out Innovative<br>approaches unique and contextualized to<br>our bicultural heritage open to new<br>confidence for Christians actually<br>um there are two questions online so<br>I'll just start with those somebody asks<br>the six participating EC services in<br>phase two are they all kindergartens<br>Early Learning Centers are there any<br>it's a really good question and I think<br>um one of the challenges is that we were<br>conducting This research throughout<br>covert which I wouldn't recommend and<br>I'm really I think as a team we're<br>incredibly grateful for the settings<br>that did open their doors to us and<br>allowed Us in because that took courage<br>and also a lot of excitement for the<br>position so we're really grateful but we<br>we're still we're still looking for some<br>reason<br>actually very hard and there's more of a<br>statement that we as Educators need to<br>break down those barriers of holding<br>their knowledge and strategies to spread<br>the strategies which work and helping to<br>adapt things to our own content and<br>dynamics of assuming of teachers we need<br>to share together thank you for sharing<br>this and somebody else's awesome<br>presentation thank you<br>um we realized when we decided we would<br>like to get really courageous and submit<br>some abstracts to this conference that<br>one of our participating centers was<br>located<br>here's a really special history with<br>this institute<br>so we thought we would invite them to<br>present their Journey with inquiry-based<br>learning and we're very keen to do that<br>at some point I actually have just been<br>at the<br>Otero New Zealand art educators<br>conference for a week and we presented<br>with daisies down there as well it was<br>really I think you learn so much more<br>from hearing the stories of incredible<br>practitioners<br>um so it's my delight to be able to<br>introduce Lee and Michelle from Little<br>Pumpkins<br>um to tell us their story<br>foreign<br>foreign<br>I'm currently the company manager for<br>Little Pumpkins Early Learning we have<br>two preschools one in tamahiri and one<br>in Glenview and so um we're just going<br>to share with you one of our projects<br>so how our journey began into<br>inquiry-based learning or what we call<br>Project work<br>in 1994 literally one year after<br>tafariki was published as a draft<br>document I was here at waikato<br>University<br>um doing my Early Childhood teacher<br>training and during my time here I was<br>introduced to the original Amelia<br>schools in Italy and I was very very<br>interested and so I went on to become<br>the manager at Glenview and then the<br>company manager for the for little<br>pumpkins and in 2009 I had the<br>opportunity to go to Melbourne with<br>Reggie Amelia auchira New Zealand to do<br>they do a a sort of a conference and you<br>can visit lots of different Early<br>Childhood centers and schools over there<br>and I've actually been twice I'm about<br>to go for a third time<br>then we decided when we came back that<br>we were going to from then on send two<br>of our kaiko every year to Melbourne and<br>in 2014 Michelle went<br>so our approach in our preschools is<br>very heavily influenced by the Reggio<br>Amelia philosophy we use environment as<br>third teachers and provocations so for<br>us this means a really aesthetically<br>pleasing environment we're set up for<br>small groups<br>provocations have very carefully set up<br>to provoke new ideas and theories we<br>have set criteria for provocations<br>literacy mathematics science the Arts<br>bicultural and Multicultural lenses<br>we look at the image of the child as<br>capable curious and we also explore the<br>hundred languages for us this means<br>having listening to children and<br>understanding that they have multiple<br>ways of expressing themselves<br>we use the pedagogy of listing in our<br>team which means listing for children's<br>questions and children's theories<br>we're prolific documentaries we document<br>and it is everywhere in our environment<br>on the walls throughout our portfolios<br>and in our own personal inquiries<br>we use a tiamori world view and we use<br>to fighter key as a base as well and we<br>have very strong links to our local<br>curriculum<br>so when we started doing our inquiry<br>work we really didn't wear Project work<br>we really weren't really sure what we<br>were doing but we had a start but over<br>the years this is the areas that we<br>or tamariki<br>we see their individual strengths<br>because it comes from a child's question<br>they naturally develop and collaborate<br>into Engineers you'll see the manager of<br>the group emerge the mathematician the<br>artist the social organizer it comes<br>directly from the children and it allows<br>them to have a safe space to share ideas<br>and theories and it builds confidence<br>because in our Center there are no wrong<br>answers<br>we celebrate diversity<br>for kayako it means that we allow them<br>to fine-tune their listening and<br>observation skills<br>it allows us to use our knowledge of<br>children's development and it builds<br>teachers intentional learning strategies<br>we spend a lot of time on intentional<br>teaching strategies<br>it allows us to document as learning is<br>unfolding and it becomes a really fun<br>they can participate as much or as<br>little as they feel comfortable<br>it gives a link between the center and<br>their home because a lot of the<br>conversations come back from home and a<br>lot of the conversations from the<br>preschool end up back at home and so you<br>have new ideas and theories coming out<br>so it's a real extension of Home in the<br>the process<br>so what we do is we listen out for the<br>child's question in fact this week<br>um a child asked a question called<br>in heels dance position was this week's<br>question so what we do is we come<br>together during our staff meetings and<br>we brainstorm all the possibilities and<br>opportunities then we at this point<br>decide on the teacher's research<br>question because we also research<br>alongside the child the children<br>then we go around our environment and we<br>set it up as as with different<br>provocations then we document and we<br>listen out for those new questions and<br>we use those questions to quickly change<br>direction<br>so I'm going to hand over to Michelle to<br>go through a project called Do Dinosaurs<br>hang upside down which ended up becoming<br>a study on perspectives<br>so this is uh this is one of our very<br>early projects that we that we did<br>initially it was a bit of a practice<br>uh this is Adam so Adam asked this great<br>question as he was using his teenager to<br>imitate dinosaurs stomping and hanging<br>in all sorts of things and he asked us<br>you know do dinosaurs hang upside down<br>and when you know you know and we knew<br>that that was a great question so do<br>dinosaurs hang upside down<br>we talked about how we could find out<br>through books<br>but they also decided to use Google<br>Google to Children 10 years ago was<br>pretty cool pretty cool thing and<br>getting into the office was also a<br>pretty cool thing to do so three<br>co-reach researching with them we<br>learned quite quickly that dinosaurs do<br>in fact hang upside down and our<br>tamariki asked to represent their<br>that's also featured in all this upside<br>down talk and we discovered that the<br>long tailed bats or the Pika Pekka live<br>in our local Gully system<br>which we visit quite regularly it's just<br>down the road from us and we connected<br>still within the animal kingdom our<br>tamariki made a connection between bats<br>and monkeys and decided to build a<br>rainforest we discovered that<br>rainforests had layers and through their<br>developing social skills they<br>collaborated<br>discussed theorized and finally<br>and at this point we realized that<br>animals they realize that animals would<br>see things differently from the Treetops<br>the idea of perspectives inspired many<br>um our tamadeki wanted to see themselves<br>upside down so we did that<br>car could decided to give tamadiki a new<br>perspective of Mahi toi by drawing<br>underneath the tables<br>there was paper under here<br>um optical illusions involved both<br>upside down and right side up<br>showing that different perspectives give<br>different pictures or points of view<br>we looked at reflection<br>we used mirrors which allowed even our<br>very young people to explore depth<br>perception<br>we investigated inside out when we<br>deconstructed an old DVD player to see<br>yoga was really a feature of our<br>curriculum Back Then and Now tamariki<br>recognized that many upside down poses<br>we planted and we talked about<br>vegetables that grow above the ground<br>and vegetables that grow under the<br>ground<br>we planted Tomatoes upside down<br>planted in CD cases<br>and the vocabulary the children we're<br>using included lots of prepositions so<br>we made up a game where we also injected<br>a little bit of Terry or Maori into that<br>tree<br>we would ask children questions to hear<br>their theories we asked what would<br>happen if the world was upside down<br>some of their answers were the ships<br>would go to the moon the Eagles would<br>fly backwards<br>the clouds won't grow because they can't<br>grow down and the Ducks would fall down<br>we used mirrors to see above us by<br>looking down<br>and that year we hung all our Christmas<br>trees from the roof<br>that's just a real quick snapshot like<br>that project went for six months and<br>this we've just picked out a few little<br>things here<br>this shows a map of of how we move<br>through the project so every jump was<br>triggered by some sort of springboard<br>such as a children's Christian or<br>wandering through co-research and<br>provocations and the movements we have<br>met here<br>are yeah just that they're a small part<br>of what we did really and sometimes it<br>went down out back and up again yeah we<br>just follow what they decide they want<br>um projects and those birthdays were<br>documented in scrapbooks<br>this is Leah who's<br>um she's three and a half now and she's<br>the last of eight who have come through<br>little pumpkins<br>so she as she finds you I know and in<br>the pages of our pukapuka it allows us<br>not only make connections to home but<br>also to revisit the learning she's<br>so our documentations evolved quite a<br>lot so between 2014 and 2018 we did a<br>lot of scrapbooking Michelle did it and<br>it had a huge amount of benefits because<br>they would sit on side on the on the on<br>the shelves for the children and the say<br>the tamariki could just revisit their<br>learning and um but the barrier was that<br>it was very very time consuming so in<br>2018 onwards we started to use story<br>Park<br>um the program inside that to document<br>all their learning and this had huge<br>benefits for us so the benefits were<br>that we could layer Publications over<br>the top of our documentation so now our<br>um<br>was always a feature right throughout<br>documenting<br>Uma<br>yeah but the barrier the barriers you're<br>using that is that it's not as<br>accessible to tamariki and whanau and<br>the reason for that is we can make it<br>accessible but we also have our own<br>Reflections inside there so the teachers<br>will share articles and our Reflections<br>for our for our growth Cycles as well<br>so I'll just give you a little snapshot<br>I won't go into too much depth into this<br>but this is how we document<br>um now this was actually after covert we<br>decided to go right back to basics again<br>and look at our regimelia inspired<br>philosophy because we had a lot of new<br>team members this was just last year<br>yeah<br>just different ways we used Toyota<br>it just allows you if you look at that<br>we've got different every piece of every<br>time a whanau came into the center we<br>recorded it as well and had photographed<br>so it's really um pages and pages and<br>when you print it it's a lot of work you<br>can just see and we set it up quite<br>different differently some years it's<br>set up differently depending on what our<br>focus is and what our goals are depends<br>Fun Works here somewhere<br>so just to finish off we've got a little<br>whakatoka here that we think applies to<br>us as a team it had a taco TOA itetoa<br>so we we basically work as a team and we<br>learn from each other and we all make<br>mistakes and we all you know we<br>backtrack and come back around again and<br>we're very fortunate that we've worked<br>together for a very very very very long<br>time and we've got our little Glenview<br>Center's only got 31 tamariki<br>predominantly Maori Pacifica English is<br>second language or children with um<br>special needs and all of our kayakoa<br>qualified teachers and we work together<br>yeah we've got one way too long with us<br>20 years I've been here 13 and you've<br>presentation<br>was really super interesting and online<br>that people are saying amazing learning<br>experiences come by<br>time I just think it's amazing really<br>that<br>um today has been that collaborative mix<br>of<br>um you know sector people from right<br>away from diversity first teaching with<br>children to to tertiary and our future<br>teachers Etc universities and we've got<br>the very real you know reason as to<br>where we're all you know together even<br>and so I think we see an inquiry<br>from teachers perspectives and from the<br>research is just yeah they just saw them<br>and credit to Michelle and Wayne is an<br>amazing job yeah we're only here we're<br>only here you because some of your<br>overview<br>they actually think we had to go and<br>share what we were doing with the rest<br>of the community<br>so we were like uh and they're not<br>really okay<br>and for us as well Sarah's been the lead<br>in the project Sarah probably and she's<br>just been absolutely you know it is<br>Sarah's background passion and<br>everything else so it's been a pleasure<br>to be part of<br>to see the actual projects<br>one of the things we found we found's<br>research is what incredible work is<br>happening Who start not everyone knows<br>about it and that's really propagation<br>so I think the next step for our<br>research is to really make this visible<br>and share this with Early Childhood<br>teachers all across anterior yeah I had<br>a problem with my students with The<br>Graduate diploma students they have a an<br>assignment where they have to they've<br>done a project and then they need to set<br>up in their Center during their customer<br>session a provocation<br>and but some of them come and say oh no<br>our Center doesn't allow us to do<br>provocations<br>and my students have to do a full<br>inquiry based and um okay<br>so yeah that's um that can be a real<br>barrier<br>will have a responsibility for uh I<br>think everyone's got their own<br>provocation space they're responsible<br>for<br>but it's just a shame that the centers<br>who don't see that this is obviously you<br>don't see the value of it at all<br>Instagram<br>I have a I have a question so with<br>regards to provocations<br>until Maori how do you provoke<br>if the knowledge if the provocation is<br>coming from the tamariki how does and if<br>the children do not have prior knowledge<br>in that space how do you incorporate<br>until Mari view around the Mahi that you<br>do how does that come a lot of a lot of<br>our most of our children do have<br>knowledge of town Maori because that's<br>that's what we teach in our invite<br>centers<br>oh in our everyday<br>um<br>lives as you know there's lots and lots<br>of psychology practice with me<br>um that question can Hills dance came<br>from uh tiao Maori<br>that's where they came from does it come<br>from the child or does that come from<br>the what you is Clay Aqua Brigham so<br>we'll set it up as a provoke an idea and<br>then we'll listen to the children's<br>questions so this little um<br>aiti has said you know your eel's dance<br>we did a lot of like we went<br>um we were fortunate we did to detour my<br>heart but um tour of waikato but one of<br>the challenges was to get out and go and<br>explore our local area and we went down<br>because we're right by with the bridges<br>coming across so we found out that the<br>hungy um<br>I think the food pets were being dug up<br>and yeah all the waterways around us<br>were used as<br>um like a fridge so they used to build<br>their pataka in their streams to keep<br>the car cold technology there even we<br>knew that they used to eat the picker<br>picker that we now you know endangered<br>I used to smoke them out of the trees<br>and eat them<br>um yeah we connect to our<br>um our local curriculum as much as we<br>can anyway<br>but you've got to find me a key person<br>in the community that can give you the<br>information<br>yeah<br>but if you're in a very pucky house<br>center that would be even harder to<br>connect with Taiwan<br>so Julie and I are curriculum leads with<br>the Ministry of Education here in these<br>three rounds to the country so<br>yeah yeah yeah we work predominantly in<br>spaces where we where there are high<br>Maori and not I think your Grandview uh<br>yeah so we we're in dying grade there<br>we're literally<br>um taking time because we are on we're<br>located or we've got five hectares of<br>land but it's not ours it's actually<br>least land from transit New Zealand So<br>eventually one day it's going to be a<br>road<br>um but and we know there's a bridge<br>coming through we didn't know whether it<br>was going to come straight through us or<br>whether but it's being built food so<br>we're safe for about another decade but<br>um yeah so it's tiny with 31 children<br>it's we're literally a<br>are dying we have six staff and we're<br>all qualified too so we'll do seven<br>because we've got parts<br>thank you I think that makes a<br>difference in terms of<br>how well you moved together and the<br>knowledge that the theory behind the<br>knowledge yeah that's a big difference<br>we've gotten due during the over the<br>years we read that by Cold Friday 10<br>years ago but algorithms project we're<br>very fortunate Emily is quite fluent now<br>as well so our very first project I<br>think would sparked my own interests was<br>we had a whananui built from recycled<br>remu from Hayes Pettit actually one of<br>our dads built in the kids thought it<br>was a bus shelter oh yeah and we were<br>like we need to do some work around<br>benef<br>Amy's involved to Future teachers you<br>may be employing to anybody else have<br>you sort of brought it together somehow<br>well at the Scrapbook which is my car I<br>knew I should have bought it shows that<br>journey and shows the shifts all the way<br>through and sometimes our projects don't<br>end up being what they think they are I<br>think the one after that we looked at<br>sustainability that we looked at there's<br>only so many ways to recycle right so we<br>looked at cultural sustainability social<br>sustainability and environmental<br>sustainability and that ended up being a<br>project on Holden guys because of the<br>way we followed the children you know<br>that's the way it should be so totally<br>yeah yeah but through the scrapbooks<br>were great I love them but a lot of work<br>and you've got to gather stuff over the<br>year in one place and put it all<br>together at the end uh was we can show<br>them our story pack stuff but likely<br>seeing a lot of our professional so our<br>professional growth Cycles are also<br>linked to our projects and PD is<br>targeted to the project for the year<br>um<br>yeah so there's a lot of teacher stuff<br>yeah a new clients were coming in<br>they're linked into it so they get<br>access to it but alsano it's really<br>documentation on what what we're talking<br>about so they get it through the<br>portfolios<br>you know any celebrations we have over<br>the year whatever's on the wall we're<br>trying to keep rocks on the walls up to<br>date and current so our families know<br>what's happening<br>yeah but we don't do the script books<br>like we used to they were my favorite I<br>would much rather be doing them but I<br>think with the expectations of<br>implementing so many different<br>Publications now with your workers every<br>publication we've managed to find a way<br>to now implement it into our projects<br>yeah<br>like you mentioned that<br>um some students going out it's not what<br>we do at our Center and just kind of<br>what you've said to us it's really<br>obvious that it's not necessarily<br>what I guess the question is you know<br>what's being done or what could be done<br>to support the growth of those practices<br>and that rich people do that you guys<br>have tapped into because I'm thinking if<br>I'm a new cable coming into a center I<br>have to account there I can learn about<br>how it effectively works but that's<br>obviously not happening everywhere right<br>no that's why we as a research team are<br>thinking about develop developing<br>resources and Publications that are<br>really going to support Geico here to<br>make those connections to tavariki and<br>my cultural apprentice and<br>commercialized curriculum because that's<br>what we've found is that inquiry is<br>being used as a vehicle to connect with<br>space in place<br>um so but there's just not a lot out<br>there so if you need the people the<br>people in the places like there's<br>nothing like learning from a person like<br>we all get books about how often do we<br>Implement what we read books into<br>practice<br>into the identity centers we've got all<br>qualified teachers and really good<br>ratios and we've actually at both<br>tomahiri and Greenville we've been<br>together a lot a lot of our fire<br>clubbing together long time like well<br>over a decade and then we've got a few<br>new grads that have come in as well and<br>I just they just love they just lose<br>and so they got really good Role Models<br>but I think if we had a total change of<br>you've got to get people up to speed and<br>it's a lot of energy<br>with everything else on top and I think<br>that comes through in degree programs<br>you know like that's where it needs to<br>really start is within the degree<br>programs next year they'll get their<br>okay well um it's time to now go through<br>to the other room for the plenary center</p></main><footer style="margin-top: 2rem; background: #0001; padding: 2rem; text-align: center;"><p>We Are The University</p><ul style="list-style-type: none;
