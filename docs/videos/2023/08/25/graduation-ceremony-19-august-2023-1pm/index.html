stand<br>foreign<br>on our call on the public orator to<br>present a candidate for an honorary<br>degree<br>thanks<br>foreign<br>foreign<br>when judge Wilson Isaac stepped down in<br>April this year as chief judge of the<br>Maori land court and chair prison of the<br>waitangi tribunal you could be mistaken<br>into thinking that this might have been<br>the opportune time for him to finally<br>put his feet up<br>but for judge Isaac<br>retirement meant finally being able to<br>concentrate on the career of his dreams<br>he is now a farmer<br>where he Revels in the fact that his<br>cattle are not as demanding as people or<br>the crown<br>despite enjoying a legal career that has<br>spent almost 50 years judge Isaac was<br>never interested in studying law he<br>arrived at the University of otago to<br>complete a Bachelor of Arts majoring in<br>education to pursue a career in teaching<br>following in his parents footsteps<br>at the end of his his degree he decided<br>he wasn't ready to go out in the real<br>world and found himself enrolling in a<br>bachelor of laws instead<br>but law was never intended to be a<br>career option<br>studying at University to complete his<br>LLB enabled the freedom for judge Isaac<br>to maintain his side hustle job as a<br>professional Meat Hunter and seafood<br>diver<br>this is not an unsurprising small<br>business<br>Enterprise for him given his East Coast<br>tribal roots and upbringing that include<br>both Inland and Coastal ewe connections<br>his heart lies and hunting Gathering and<br>providing for others<br>when judge Isaac finished his LLB he<br>returned to the east coast and started<br>working in the Gisborne Law Firm<br>focusing specifically on Maori landlord<br>and family law<br>values instilled in him from both sides<br>of his whanau worked well with his legal<br>practice<br>being able to work through the same lens<br>as as mainly Maori clients meant judge<br>Isaac quickly earned their trust<br>his love of farming hunting and Diving<br>made him more relatable to his clients<br>he spent time with people socially<br>hunting on their land with them and<br>helping their horses with their horses<br>this act of whakafanongatanga building<br>trusting and meaningful relationships<br>with people has been the key to judge<br>Isaac's success<br>growing up amongst his father's suhoi<br>people in waimana on the edge of the<br>udueda forest there was never a sense of<br>land loss within his whanau they have<br>always been in full control of their<br>land and they have never left that area<br>however a lot of the land is<br>underdeveloped under-resourced and<br>unproductive Maori land which means the<br>economic prosperity of his people had<br>been severely compromised<br>when the opportunity to become a judge<br>in the Maori land Court presented itself<br>in 1994.<br>judge Isaac found himself in a position<br>to be able to better support whanau to<br>achieve their land aspirations<br>not an easy task when the Maori land<br>Court which is this country's oldest<br>court is part of a government system<br>that Informer iterations was used to<br>deprive Maori of their land<br>thankfully that's no longer the role of<br>the Maori land Court<br>the focus is now to promote the<br>retention utilization and development of<br>Maori land and that decisions made about<br>Maori land are fear and balanced<br>this has been the driving force behind<br>judge Isaac's lengthy stay in the Maori<br>land Court<br>is it it is a tension filled an<br>emotionally charged space<br>there has the potential to split whanau<br>apart<br>but judge Isaac's kaupapa was and still<br>is quite simple<br>to help Maori and to help Maori lend<br>when he made a decision though he was<br>able to walk away but the whanau<br>remained and they had to continue<br>working and living together<br>the judge Isaac was committed to making<br>sure that land owners are empowered to<br>resolve disputes that enables the land<br>to be better cared for because if the<br>land is healthy and prosperous so are<br>its people<br>in addition to judge Isaac's work in the<br>Maori land Court he has also been a<br>member and chair of the waitangi<br>Tribunal<br>he has presided over the mohaka Ki<br>ahuderi inquiry the northern South<br>Island inquiry and National Park<br>District inquiry the freshwater and<br>geothermal resources inquiry and the<br>Napier hospital and Health Services<br>report inquiries<br>despite having retired he is still the<br>presiding officer for the Maori military<br>veterans inquiry and the inquiry into<br>remaining historical claims<br>and as if there was not enough work to<br>do in aotearoa judge Isaac is also a<br>judge of the high court of newey and the<br>high court of the Cook Islands<br>there's absolutely no such thing as<br>retiring in tiaumori<br>service to whanau HAPO and ewe is a 24 7<br>lifelong commitment<br>but as Maori that is what we are born to<br>do<br>I'm told that recognition of the<br>significant contribution judge Isaac has<br>made in the legal profession<br>through the awarding of this honorary<br>doctorate does not necessarily sit<br>comfortably with him which must present<br>a huge inner ewe battle<br>I'm sure his ngatipuro slide is wanting<br>to shout it out to the world<br>his two hoi side is saying<br>is sitting back looking pretty and<br>foreign<br>judge Isaac I'm reminded of the words of<br>a waiter world famous singartipuro when<br>I think of the impact of your work your<br>commitment and the seeds of

chancellors<br>Mr mere<br>professors doctors distinguished guests<br>to you all<br>and thank you otago University for<br>bestowing<br>this honorary doctorate of the law upon<br>me<br>I am truly honored and humbled<br>by the award and the acknowledgment<br>that I have received today thank you<br>but really this day is not about me it's<br>about<br>or you guys down there<br>all the graduates who who are here and<br>who have worked so hard<br>to achieve<br>as I said earlier the Pinnacles of your<br>studies<br>well done to you all and congratulations<br>um<br>you've got to be extremely proud of your<br>endeavors<br>now when I was asked to make this<br>I was only given 20 minutes I've used up<br>but I tried to remember the graduation<br>speeches<br>when I graduated<br>here it seems like a lifetime ago it was<br>in 19<br>73 in 1976<br>uh and really all I can remember from<br>those graduation addresses<br>was that they were far too long<br>and um with respect to the speakers a<br>little bit boring<br>and really I couldn't I couldn't wait to<br>to get out of here and get back down to<br>the gardens Tavern<br>to celebrate with with a number of my<br>um now I know the gardens Tavern is long<br>gone and so is the Bowling Green so is<br>the cook<br>um but I doubt whether the student<br>otago student culture has changed too<br>much since that time<br>so I'm going to keep a brief<br>and I just really want to leave you with<br>three simple and I think important<br>messages for you to take out into the<br>big wide world if you wish<br>now I want to introduce these these<br>messages to you<br>proverbs<br>the first<br>is taken from<br>whangarei School the whangarei school<br>and as many of you will know whangarei<br>is on the east coast of the North Island<br>it's the home of the Whale Rider<br>and in later years the home of suderica<br>Delhi who probably had a hand at writing<br>the small motto when he was younger<br>the<br>says this<br>is<br>translated it means strike to the<br>horizon<br>be the best that you can be<br>so reach for the horizon<br>and your aspirations<br>and strive to achieve them<br>another whakatoki in a similar vein<br>foreign<br>pursue Excellence but should you stumble<br>let it be to a lofty Mountain<br>so when you get out into the Big Wide<br>World don't undersell yourself<br>keep following your dreams<br>and striving to achieve your aspirations<br>as Nelson Mandela once said winners are<br>dreamers who never stop dreaming<br>so graduates cut a fewer and that simply<br>means go for it<br>or if you were a warrior fan up the<br>uh<br>I'm not a Warriors fan by the way<br>but I am high<br>and strike<br>the next message I want to leave you<br>with is set out in the words of this<br>whakatoki<br>this whakatoki was<br>given to me<br>um<br>which is in the heart of the weather<br>and um it goes something like this<br>is<br>the dog returns to his vomit<br>do not return to the mess you have made<br>in a similar put the next of Toki<br>gives a similar message and it says this<br>is<br>the flounder does not return to the<br>mother it has stood<br>so graduates learn from your mistakes<br>and move on once you have learned that<br>lesson and it was interesting to hear<br>Eddie Jones<br>the Australian coach<br>talk about his team after they were<br>beaten by the All Blacks down here at<br>foresight Bar Stadium<br>a couple of weeks ago<br>and after that defeat<br>Eddie Jones said this<br>we've got a devastated group of men in<br>here<br>but if we learn from it it will be the<br>most potent lesson<br>so you can draw your own conclusions<br>about the analogy with the PhD<br>but the message that<br>Eddie Jones was giving was loud and<br>clear<br>learn from your mistakes and do better<br>next time<br>the final message that I have for you is<br>translator that means<br>sustenance gained from one's own hand is<br>the best and the most enjoyable<br>so find a job or vacate or vocation<br>that you enjoy<br>and you will get true satisfaction from<br>it<br>on the flip side of that if you don't<br>enjoy your work<br>uh your days in the office will be<br>extremely long and unrewarding<br>so if you follow your dreams and if you<br>find your dream job<br>it won't be a chore getting up in the<br>morning and going to work<br>and I can quite honestly say<br>after 29 years on the um Maori land<br>called Finch I never had any issues with<br>getting up in the morning<br>so I want to leave you with this<br>whakatoki from ngatipuro<br>I'm told that<br>that was penned
