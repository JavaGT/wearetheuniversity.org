otago alumnus who is now chief<br>steward of our nation's Health System<br>Dr Diana safety's illustrious career in<br>public health saw her accept the mantle<br>of director general of Health at the end<br>of last year<br>when you consider doctors have faithi's<br>work ethic and dedication that led to<br>this achievement as little one that she<br>holds this vital position<br>after graduating from otago with a<br>bachelor of medicine and a bachelor of<br>surgery in 1991 she traveled and worked<br>overseas before returning to otago where<br>she worked in the department of<br>preventative and

words of a former colleague<br>oncologist Professor Chris Jackson She's<br>a once in a generation intellect and a<br>foreign<br>I hope you can see me over here I'm here<br>Chancellor Vice Chancellor members of<br>the University Council distinguished<br>faculty and staff parents families and<br>friends and most importantly graduates<br>it's a huge pleasure to be with you here<br>today I have so much affection and<br>respect for the University of otago it<br>was of course a formative place for me I<br>was a student here as you heard I was an<br>academic and head of Department here and<br>all three of my children went to<br>University here with one still here to<br>be fair that might be because they<br>pretty much grew up thinking there was<br>in fact only one University in New<br>Zealand<br>as I sat down to think about what I<br>would say to you today I started<br>reflecting on my career to date the<br>journey from medical student to doctor<br>to academic to Professor to chief<br>executive and now to director general of<br>Health I want to try and find some<br>common threads that I could share with<br>you that would genuinely impart my sense<br>of wonder which can basically be summed<br>up with the words how on Earth did I end<br>up here<br>the journey has been extraordinary<br>exciting terrifying unexpected and a<br>huge privilege<br>but I would certainly be lying if I said<br>I had it all planned out I could say to<br>you things like anything is possible and<br>and sees every opportunity that comes<br>your way both are true but it may be<br>that you've heard those things before<br>and you're not entirely sure what they<br>mean in a you know practical sense I<br>certainly didn't when I was sitting<br>where you are now<br>so I thought some more what was the<br>Common Thread that was there in the<br>panic I felt as a second year med<br>student going into my anatomy exam<br>feeling like I wasn't properly prepared<br>that everybody almost certainly knew<br>more than I did all accompanied by a<br>free-ranging sense of anxiety that I<br>might fail<br>the thread that was there when I was a<br>junior doctor standing in the corridors<br>of Palmerston North Hospital at 2 A.M<br>with three urgent pages and quick<br>succession summoning me diametrically<br>different directions feeling like I<br>didn't know what to do with anxiety that<br>I might make the wrong decision and the<br>consequences were nothing less than life<br>and death<br>the three that was there when there's a<br>new lecturer here at otago standing in<br>front of a class completely conscious<br>that I very much did not know everything<br>and worrying about getting something<br>wrong or not being able to answer a<br>question or worst of all being boring<br>the three that followed me as a<br>professor to a table around which a<br>committee of global experts contemplated<br>how health systems work and how we could<br>make them better what on Earth could I<br>contribute from Little Old New Zealand<br>quite a bit as it turns out<br>the three that was still there when I<br>first stepped into the public service to<br>set up the brand new cancer control<br>Agency New Zealand's first with the aim<br>to deliver better cancer outcomes to all<br>new zealanders while a pandemic was<br>looming and the world was going into<br>lockdown<br>and the three that is very much still<br>here every day as I face challenges that<br>have no obvious solution but required<br>decisions and actions as director<br>general of Health<br>so I got to thinking what was it about<br>that thread what was the common feature<br>and I came to the realization that it<br>was both as simple and as powerful<br>as being uncomfortable<br>being uncomfortable disguised itself in<br>many ways maybe I don't know the answer<br>maybe I don't have the experience maybe<br>I will fail maybe I'm not enough maybe<br>I'll get it wrong but it was there<br>humming away in the background sometimes<br>barely Audible and sometimes shouting<br>loudly in my ear<br>as I thought about this I thought about<br>the most satisfying moments in my career<br>they were always preceded by a period of<br>feeling uncomfortable<br>the more I thought about this the more I<br>thought about the possibility that being<br>uncomfortable might actually be a<br>superpower<br>admittedly it isn't as cool as being<br>able to fly or being invisible but a<br>superpower nonetheless and helpfully it<br>is one that we can all use<br>let me explain if you are feeling<br>uncomfortable You Are by definition<br>working outside your comfort zone when<br>you're inside that comfort zone you are<br>generally confident that you got this<br>it's not too hard you know your stuff<br>and it's it's all pretty relaxing you<br>can stay there and life might be pretty<br>easy but it also might be pretty boring<br>but if you operate just a bit outside<br>your comfort zone you're by definition<br>feel uncomfortable and let me be clear<br>when I say operating outside of your<br>comfort zone I'm not talking about doing<br>a spot of neurosurgery when you're a<br>trainee intern I'm talking about being<br>in that place where you feel challenged<br>maybe a bit nervous and we have to when<br>you have to really think about what<br>you're doing it's when you start hearing<br>those internal voices saying maybe I<br>don't know the answer maybe I don't have<br>the experience maybe I will fail maybe<br>I'm not enough maybe I'll get it wrong<br>but here's what I wish someone had told<br>me being uncomfortable doesn't mean any<br>of those things it's not only okay to be<br>uncomfortable it may be the very best<br>thing to be because if you were<br>operating in that sweet spot just<br>outside your comfort zone it's where the<br>magic happens and the superpower kicks<br>in and the really weird thing is you<br>probably won't even notice<br>because what tends to happen when you're<br>operating in that space just outside<br>your comfort zone is you get comfortable<br>there so you naturally take a step just<br>a bit further out then one day and<br>faster than you think you look back and<br>realize that you're comfortable doing<br>things you never thought you would be<br>I've spent a lot of time feeling<br>uncomfortable and I've had an exciting<br>stimulating and at times unexpected<br>career to date but I want to be really<br>clear I didn't do it on my own I had<br>brilliant mentors colleagues friends and<br>teachers who were there to catch me if I<br>fell some of whom are in this room and<br>to whom I am forever grateful you need<br>those people when you're sitting outside<br>your comfort zone value and cherish them<br>anyway I thought about this concept<br>about being uncomfortable the other day<br>when I was sitting at the table with a<br>prime minister on one side and the<br>Ministers of health and Finance on the<br>other discussing the highs and lows of<br>the health system reforms and I had<br>another one of those intense moments<br>where I found myself thinking how on<br>Earth did I end up here<br>my answer may have been anything as<br>possible sees every opportunity but<br>really it's as simple as getting<br>comfortable with being uncomfortable<br>then let the magic happen good luck and<br>I can't wait to see how you change the<br>world<br>thank you very much Dr safety for<br>speaking to us today at the University<br>we're grateful you've retained such<br>strong ties to the university and set us<br>your children uh so if I could ask the<br>audience to join with me and thanking<br>you once again<br>on behalf of the University Council<br>thank you again for celebrating with us<br>today<br>to those who have traveled long<br>safe travels and stay well<br>I'd also like to thank the vice<br>Chancellor Professor Helen Nicholson and<br>her academic and professional staff at<br>all of the University's campuses<br>throughout the country for their<br>outstanding contributions to ensuring<br>our students experience a top quality<br>and enjoyable education<br>and thanks also to the members of Staff<br>who have organized and run today's<br>graduation so smoothly please join me in<br>expressing our appreciation to our staff<br>to you who have graduated or received<br>diplomas I offer the congratulations of<br>the university on your new status and I<br>welcome you to its full and permanent<br>membership<br>I charge you by the common bond that now<br>unites us to cherish the good name and<br>reputation of the university and to<br>strive for the advancement of knowledge<br>and the extension of understanding<br>I trust that in your different vocations<br>your lives may be fruitful of good to<br>yourselves and to to those among whom<br>the academic Anthem gauri yamas will now<br>be sung the words are printed inside the<br>back cover of your graduation booklet<br>please remain standing after the anthem<br>as the academic procession<br>foreign<br>foreign<br>same here<br>foreign</p></main><footer style="margin-top: 2rem; background: #0001; padding: 2rem; text-align:
