Bryson I'm the dean of the<br>Wellington School of Business and<br>government or iriki here at uh Victoria<br>University of Wellington tahirangawaka<br>and we've got a wee bit of a change of<br>plan this morning we're going to get<br>underway immediately<br>um because<br>um the minister The Honorable Grant<br>Robertson has to fly to Auckland<br>emergence<br>urgently so he has to leave at 11 45 so<br>we thought we'd get straight into it he<br>will speak for a couple of minutes and<br>then we'll go straight to your questions<br>um and uh you may or may not be aware<br>because you may have been traveling here<br>but there was an incident a shooting<br>incident in Auckland this morning on a<br>construction site which<br>it was an isolated incident as contained<br>but the minister needs to get up to<br>Auckland earlier because of course FIFA<br>football is kicking off uh at the end of<br>the day in Auckland and so he needs to<br>smooth the waters so I will immediately<br>hand to um The Honorable Grant Robertson<br>the Minister of Finance<br>um so that we get underway make the most<br>greetings everybody<br>um thank you Jane uh very much for that<br>introduction and I really do apologize<br>to you uh for the change in Arrangements<br>that we've had to make today as Jane<br>indicated not all of you will have<br>caught up with this but unfortunately<br>this morning there was a shooting in<br>order and two people uh died and a<br>number of people were injured during the<br>incident that took place uh uh near the<br>britamart train station in Auckland<br>which is a very busy area as I'm sure<br>you'd imagine it's also the area where a<br>number of the teams who are<br>participating in the FIFA Women's World<br>Cup are staying including unfortunately<br>the Norwegian team who are playing<br>tonight as well as being the Minister of<br>Finance<br>um I have the honor to be the minister<br>of sport and Recreation and I've spent<br>the last three years working with an<br>amazing group of people to organize the<br>biggest sporting tournament that New<br>Zealand will ever see in the form of the<br>FIFA Women's World Cup and so as a<br>result of that I need to get up to<br>Auckland as soon as I can just to<br>support some of the people who have been<br>affected by this and work our way<br>through the game which is going to take<br>place later this evening uh it's a<br>terribly terribly tragic situation<br>particularly with the loss of lives and<br>some injuries to the police and others<br>who were there as the First Responders<br>so obviously my heart goes out to them<br>normally I would now get into a<br>presentation about the budget and run<br>you through some slides and talk you<br>through all of the the things that I<br>wanted to get across about the budget<br>but in the interest of the time that<br>we've got and the fact that so many of<br>you have come and I want to say thank<br>you for doing that we're going to go<br>straight into the questions there is a<br>risk that if you don't ask any questions<br>I'll revert that to the original plan<br>which won't I think be the best use of<br>our time<br>um so I'm very happy to take questions<br>when you ask a question if you could<br>just tell me your name and the school<br>that you are from uh that'll start our<br>beautiful relationship off together so<br>who wants to be first<br>awesome<br>why wasn't it could you say yeah so<br>um just to give people context we<br>haven't followed along so in this budget<br>we increased the trustee tax rate to 39<br>cents to match the top rate of personal<br>income tax when we lifted the top rate<br>of personal income tests in 2021 we were<br>concerned that uh that we didn't know<br>enough about the structure of trusts and<br>who would be affected by lifting the<br>rate so while a lot of trusts are used<br>by people with a lot of wealth to be<br>able to manage that wealth there are<br>also a significant number of trusts that<br>are used to look after for example<br>disabled people orphans children and so<br>on and so we weren't completely<br>confident in 2021 that we had the system<br>in place to be able to make sure that<br>those people weren't affected but others<br>who might be Sheltering income and<br>trusts uh were so we made uh we asked<br>the Inland Revenue Department and the<br>treasury to to look at and monitor what<br>happened with trusts and what we saw was<br>about a 50 increase in the number of<br>trusts being registered after we lifted<br>the top personal rate so there was some<br>pretty obvious behavior that was<br>happening now what we've done is we've<br>created a law where there's an exemption<br>if the trust is for a disabled person so<br>we've created that card out which means<br>we're now confident to make sure that<br>the trust rate and the top tax rate<br>should income tax rate should be aligned<br>almost every other country in the world<br>has that alignment and obviously that's<br>the question that you could shelter your<br>income and not have to pay so much tax<br>but the reason we didn't do it was we<br>didn't have all of that details sorted<br>then now we do<br>good question good to start on a good<br>tax question at the beginning<br>other questions I'll start pinpointing<br>people so if you've got one<br>there were a few that were sent in by<br>schools<br>why are they operating allowances for<br>Budget 2023<br>which was 4.8 million greater than for<br>the next three years which was 3.5<br>million for each of them yeah so just as<br>IU understands it so when we set our<br>budget each year we set what's called an<br>operating allowance that's the new<br>spending that we're going to do in the<br>coming year or years uh on top of what<br>we already do and the question was<br>around why is it at 4.8 but the others<br>are at 3.5 billion two there's a lot of<br>reasons for the two that I'll highlight<br>are we did have to increase that<br>operating allowance largely because of<br>the arrival of the Cyclone of cyclone<br>Gabriel and the Auckland anniversary<br>weekend floods so when we're the budget<br>process for next year begins in the<br>August of the previous year so the<br>budget process for Budget 2023 began in<br>August 2022 so we go a long way down the<br>path of working out what our priorities<br>are how much money we think is available<br>we've given the other indicators and<br>goals that we've got and we get to the<br>December and we produce a thing called<br>the half yearly update which gives what<br>we indicate we think we're going to do<br>in the budget between that update in<br>December and when we gave the budget in<br>may we had New Zealand's second largest<br>ever natural disaster so that's what<br>Cyclone Gabriel was the only one with a<br>bigger impact was the Canterbury<br>earthquakes so we had to reject the<br>budget and so that's why we increased<br>the allowances in order to be able to do<br>that to support people through both the<br>emergency and then the recovery and the<br>rebuild the second point is we've sent<br>those allowances in the future years to<br>enable us to get back to a budget<br>surplus now many of you will know that<br>during covert the government had to<br>spend a lot of money to support people<br>through coven through things like the<br>wage subsidy scheme the extra funding<br>for the health system and so on and I<br>think that was the right thing to do and<br>I think it served New Zealand well but<br>spending at the level that we were isn't<br>sustainable for the long term and so the<br>next years will require us to be very<br>fiscally disciplined and part of that<br>discipline is setting ourselves that<br>allowance at their 3.5 billion dollar<br>level because our judgment is that that<br>will allow us to get the books back into<br>Surplus over a few years and meet our<br>other targets including our debt targets<br>so it'll be a challenge and I've been<br>issuing that challenge to my colleagues<br>that the next few budgets are going to<br>be pretty tight<br>would be strong we'll come to someone<br>else before we come back to you my good<br>sir<br>how about someone from some pets down<br>uh thanks gonna say<br>um I'm Johnny from Saint pets in<br>silverstream<br>um one of the big things in the budget<br>this year was uh scraping the five<br>dollar fee for prescriptions<br>um and I'm just wondering what the<br>government is doing to address the other<br>barriers to accessing Healthcare<br>um like GP charges upwards of 50 or 60<br>dollars for example it's a really good<br>question so while a lot of publicity<br>obviously went around uh scrapping at<br>the five dollar prescription charge<br>um that is a fraction of the health<br>budget um it was about 160 million<br>dollars a year and the health budget is<br>billions of dollars uh AF at least<br>getting on to 20 billion dollars a year<br>so<br>um it's a small thing but it's something<br>that you know we promoted and that the<br>media got into uh the whole point of the<br>health reforms that we have put in place<br>so that was getting rid of the 20<br>District Health boards from around New<br>Zealand and collapsing them down into<br>Health New Zealand to photo order and to<br> out to Iowa the Maori health<br>authority<br>um the the point of getting those<br>organizations together was to create a<br>more effective and efficient system of<br>delivery but also to start shifting<br>resources more towards Primary Care like<br>GPS and So within our system at the<br>moment we have a system called the very<br>low cost access scheme which enables<br>people on low income to be able to get<br>to the doctor for 10 to 15 dollars<br>rather than that 50 or 60. the biggest<br>issue around primary care and around<br>almost every other part of the health<br>health is Workforce so we simply don't<br>have the GPS that we need and so you've<br>got a commitment within the budget for<br>an increase in the number of doctors<br>that we're training and increasing the<br>number of nurses that we're training<br>alongside that we're lifting the pay of<br>those nurses including practice nurses<br>who work in GP clinics to make it a more<br>attractive career and then finally in<br>the immigration system we've opened that<br>up so more nurses can come into the<br>system more doctors can come into the<br>system so there's a big investment in<br>primary care and The Wider Health System<br>Way Beyond the five dollar prescription<br>charge<br>yes<br>yes<br>um I'm Victoria from socrat do you<br>believe that the five dollar<br>prescription fee will actually stick on<br>the budget in the next coming years uh<br>um uh yeah look um it'll be very<br>interesting to see what happens in the<br>immediate aftermath of the announcement<br>uh the opposition Finance spokesperson<br>said that uh if there was a national<br>lead government that they would put the<br>charge back on so their position then<br>got slightly fudged a few days later<br>when I think the National Party worked<br>out that it was quite a popular policy<br>so it'll be interesting to see what they<br>do<br>um I think it is really important with<br>something like that that there is<br>consistency<br>um for the pharmacies themselves I think<br>that would be important as well as for<br>uh the patients and those who come to<br>pick up prescriptions I mean we this<br>policy wasn't when we just sort of<br>invented out of thin air it's actually<br>partly based on a study undertaking<br>Point another University uh into into<br>the reasons why people don't pick up<br>prescriptions and that study showed that<br>about 130 000 new zealanders each year<br>don't pick up their prescriptions<br>because of the cost and while 5 might<br>not seem like much to you if you're<br>picking up say four prescriptions and<br>it's 20 bucks and you've got other cost<br>pressures in your life often that<br>doesn't become the priority uh the other<br>problem with that is that if people<br>don't pick their prescriptions up they<br>end up getting sicker which means they<br>end up arriving at an emergency<br>department that's already overstuffed<br>with people and end up causing further<br>costs within the health system and<br>getting sicker so it was a policy that<br>we saw was doing uh was fulfilling more<br>than one goal it was helping ease the<br>cost of living but it was also helping<br>deal with some pressures in the health<br>system so we're absolutely committed to<br>it<br>it's a really long way out per person so<br>I'll fill in with a little bit of how<br>foreign<br>from St Mary's College and I would like<br>to ask are there any other ways to<br>combat inflation apart from Raising<br>interest rates that's a really good<br>question uh so<br>um again just to sort of give people the<br>broader context of the question which<br>I'm sure you've all been learning about<br>so the responsibility in New Zealand for<br>keeping inflation between one and three<br>percent sits with the Reserve Bank The<br>Reserve Bank is independent of the<br>government they make the decisions they<br>make in particular about the official<br>cash rate themselves and that is the<br>tool they have been given in order to be<br>able to manage inflation there's<br>actually a really interesting debate<br>going on globally about whether or not<br>the use of an official cash rate is the<br>best way to manage inflation and in fact<br>really what inflation looks like<br>nowadays so in New Zealand we we measure<br>a thing called the Consumer Price Index<br>and the Consumer Price Index is<br>literally a basket of goods so there are<br>it's the cost of particular products the<br>whole way we spend and we buy is<br>changing and while this is a simplistic<br>example the way we shop for clothes is<br>completely different now to what it was<br>20 years ago and so if you're thinking<br>well what's the cost of something in a<br>shop that could be very very different<br>from the cost of something online it's<br>just one example it's a much bigger set<br>of things that we measure in the CPI so<br>there is a really interesting<br>conversation to have on on whether or<br>not we're properly measuring inflation<br>but that is their tool we do have a role<br>as the government alongside<br>um cash rates in terms of what we do<br>because obviously as the government<br>we're one of the biggest Spenders in the<br>economy and so we want to make sure that<br>we're spending wisely and well but in<br>ways that don't and necessarily<br>exacerbate inflation so there there is a<br>factor in our thinking and it was a<br>factor in our thinking in this budget<br>what the budget documents show is that<br>the treasury expect inflation to get<br>down to four percent around the<br>beginning of next year and then down<br>into that Target band in 2025 and so<br>we've tried to contribute to that I<br>mentioned before that the amount of<br>spending is starting uh to come down and<br>those out year budgets that's another<br>way that we can help in terms of making<br>sure inflation's managed new zealanders<br>generally<br>um it would be good if new zealanders<br>looked at their savings rates for lots<br>of different reasons that's another way<br>that if the money is staying in savings<br>and rather be than being spent that um<br>then that helps to bring inflation down<br>as well and so initiatives like<br>kiwisaver and so on are really useful<br>for helping people see uh the benefit of<br>that to themselves but also not have<br>that money being spent in the economy<br>right now<br>a whole lot of other things that would<br>be helpful making sure that we had<br>really reliable supply chain routes so<br>that Goods don't cost so much coming<br>into the country as well and that's been<br>a really big issue uh post covert<br>um and so making sure we've got a<br>diversity of where we're getting<br>products from and so on all of that<br>helps make sure that we keep costs like<br>meaning yes up there I think yep in the<br>middle there<br>um I'm Sophie from Wellington girls<br>college<br>um I was just wondering why a capital<br>gains tax wasn't implemented this year<br>and if you think one ever will be<br>I hope you've been following the news<br>and you might know the answer to that<br>question so<br>um in terms of this budget we considered<br>a number of different tax options uh the<br>conclusion that the cabinet made was<br>that given that we're living in very<br>very uncertain and volatile Economic<br>Times as a result of covert the war in<br>Ukraine and so on that this wasn't the<br>right time to be making a really big<br>shift in our tax system uh we have over<br>the past few years made some changes<br>that go in the direction of a cgt so<br>we've got a thing called the rights line<br>test which basically means if you buy a<br>property and then you flip it within 10<br>years you have to pay tax on it which is<br>a similar concept but a shorter term in<br>term rather than a permanent thing like<br>he'd have with the cgt we obviously did<br>consider that and what's on the public<br>record is that I did quite a lot of work<br>around a thing called a wealth tax which<br>is another version of trying to look at<br>how we text across uh the bases of<br>income and Assets in our society so most<br>other countries in the world as I'm sure<br>you know have some form of text that<br>looks like this historically New Zealand<br>hasn't and one of the things having been<br>in politics for a little while now I can<br>tell you is it's quite hard to get<br>something in it's much easier when it's<br>already there but there is some issues<br>in some areas that I think in the future<br>we do need to work on to make sure that<br>that all forms of income and all forms<br>of assets are at least considered fairly<br>so there's plenty of work still to do in<br>that space But in terms of this budget<br>the decision was made that now just<br>wasn't the right time for that and<br>certainly not the right time for<br>unfunded tax cuts when there's so much<br>pressure on funding health and education<br>we'll go back to Wellington College<br>hello my name is Joe honowsky from<br>Wellington college and I wanted to ask<br>that considering especially these<br>uncertain times is there any certainty<br>in the continuation of investment into<br>projects to expand and develop<br>um public transportation infrastructure<br>such as the projects like let's get<br>Wellington moving yeah especially in the<br>long term yeah I'm a really good<br>question so also an opportunity just to<br>talk about the two kind of different<br>parts of the budget so operating<br>expenditure is the stuff that we spend<br>day to day to run the government capital<br>expenditure is the money that we spend<br>on assets on things that are going to<br>last uh that are there to build<br>infrastructure and public transport is a<br>really good example of that so the<br>budget contains a number of initiatives<br>in this when it comes to let's get<br>Wellington moving<br>about<br>odd or four years ago now we as a<br>government committed a chunk of money it<br>was about four and a half billion<br>dollars to let's get Wellington moving<br>but one of the peculiarities of the way<br>we fund transported in New Zealand is<br>that there's a mixture of people who are<br>involved in that funding so it's not<br>just us it's also the greater Wellington<br>Regional Council who run metlink as you<br>would know it and the Wellington city<br>council now it creates some real<br>peculiarities<br>one one Council runs the bus service<br>another Council runs the bus stops<br>and it does create quite a few problems<br>at this point the greater Wellington<br>Regional Council and the Wellington city<br>council have not yet identified how they<br>are going to fund their bit of the Fall<br>Let's Get Well into moving program but<br>the design work on it has carried on<br>you've probably seen that equally we've<br>got big projects in other cities in the<br>public transport space particularly in<br>Auckland so the city Rail Link is well<br>into its construction phase and there's<br>some money within the budget to support<br>the design of Auckland Light Rail which<br>is a big light rail network across the<br>Auckland area but public transport is a<br>shared funding commitment between<br>central and local government that has<br>uh hi I'm lucky Wesley Smith from HEBs<br>um does the government have a plan for<br>the future regarding combating inflation<br>through the supply side like changing<br>business confidence uh and<br>competitiveness<br>yeah I mean there's a whole lot of<br>things that contribute to not only the<br>reduction of inflation but actually<br>having a sustainably growing economy and<br>one of those is having a business<br>community that is uh supported to be<br>able to generate wealth and generate<br>jobs<br>um when I think about what we went<br>through during covert you know about 23<br>billion dollars was spent supporting<br>businesses to be able to stay in<br>business and stay competitive<br>um we found out some really interesting<br>things and most of you will know that<br>about 75 of the businesses in New<br>Zealand are what you'd call small<br>businesses so<br>um less than 50 people within the<br>business as you listen 20 people on that<br>definition and a lot of those businesses<br>had absolutely no online prisons at all<br>and which is kind of remarkable today<br>and so we've invested quite a lot of<br>money in supporting companies to be able<br>to go online and be able to kind of<br>improve their competitiveness we also<br>obviously as a country invest in in<br>things like skills and training and<br>getting people into the workforce who<br>are going to be more productive research<br>and development<br>infrastructure and transport but even<br>things like free trade agreements which<br>we've signed a couple of just recently<br>with the European Union and the UK all<br>help our companies be able to export as<br>well in terms of business confidence<br>well the good news is that it's getting<br>better the bad news is it couldn't have<br>got much worse<br>um because we clearly have been in a<br>really really challenging period it's<br>interesting when you dig into the<br>business confidence statistics you often<br>find and it's certainly the case at the<br>moment businesses are quite confident<br>about their own business they're just<br>worried about the why that environment<br>so we've just got to keep working on<br>making sure that we do get that<br>stability and the government does it by<br>bringing inflation down as well as the<br>uh just going back but with the budgets<br>planning to be kept at 3 billion for the<br>coming years well the after effects of<br>covid-19 and Cyclone Gabriel for example<br>uh be able to be covered with this or<br>will most of it be solved by next year<br>sorry I just missing part of that<br>uh with like the after effects of<br>covid-19 and cycling Gabriel with the<br>budget being reduced to 3.5 billion for<br>next year will this be able to cover the<br>after effects or was most of it planned<br>to be solved by then<br>yeah no it was the last by the equation<br>that it won't be solved by then um these<br>are very big impacts on everything from<br>schools through to roads through to the<br>way in which<br>um Orchards operate anything you can<br>think about so no it's a long run uh<br>thing we did commit in this budget<br>around about two billion dollars for the<br>Cyclone recovery so that will deal with<br>quite a bit of it but it won't deal with<br>all of it what we did do in the budget<br>was we created something called a<br>national resilience plan and for me this<br>is something I've been working on for a<br>couple of years now we spend a lot of<br>money on roads and Rail and hospitals<br>and schools as we're in housing as we<br>should about 70 billion dollars over the<br>next five years has been allocated good<br>for that what we haven't done such a<br>good job of is thinking about how do we<br>make ourselves more resilient to the<br>effects of climate change and the<br>examples you get of that is there's a<br>road in the coromandel state highway 25A<br>that's been washed out twice in three<br>years and we've just kind of gone to<br>rebuild it back in the same place rather<br>than doing that this fund is about and<br>not just there but lots of other places<br>looking for Solutions that'll actually<br>be resilient to the effects of climate<br>change and actually trying to get ahead<br>of that as well with some of the other<br>work we might do on building stop banks<br>for to stop floods or shifting roads or<br>making more resilient Rail lines so that<br>fund it's got six billion dollars in it<br>initially that was allocated in this<br>budget for the next three or so Years<br>it'll firstly go to the areas most<br>affected by the Cyclone but then we want<br>it to start to do that job of building<br>that resilience so we're not chasing our<br>tail all the time on there so that would<br>be the place to look for where that<br>money would go they're separate to the<br>3.5 billion dollar operating allowance<br>which is much more just the day-to-day<br>spending<br>I will take one more who wants to be the<br>last<br>are we going to try and have someone who<br>hasn't had a question<br>um I'm Luca from St Mary's<br>um when he is going to pay teachers more<br>so we don't keep losing them and it<br>affects our learning that's a good place<br>to be in isn't it<br>um yeah I'm not I'm not going to do the<br>um because some of your teachers are in<br>the room I'm not going to do the uh<br>negotiation with them right now except<br>to say that uh there is a process in<br>place to uh to come to a resolution<br>there's a fairly big chunk of money on<br>the table I recognize that teachers like<br>everybody else have been up against it<br>with uh the cost of living increasing<br>I'm the son of a teacher<br>um I recognize the importance of the<br>role and so I'm really hopeful that<br>we'll come to a resolution I'm really<br>pleased that getting into term three<br>um we've got ourselves to the place<br>where we're in that space and not in<br>what we had before but I agree with you<br>we've got to make sure we pay our<br>teachers well folks I'm so sorry that I<br>have to leave I hope you'll understand<br>why um I did bring these along Jane<br>which is um a really cool fold out of<br>the budget that looks like this<br>I will leave you Jane to work out who to<br>give them to okay thanks everybody<br>okay everybody I'll keep you captive for<br>okay if if we can just have have your<br>attention for a couple more minutes uh<br>and then we'll we will finish a bit<br>early for you I hope that doesn't<br>discombobulate your teachers too much<br>um so usually I do this before Grant<br>speaks while I have you truly captive<br>but I'll do it afterwards now going we<br>had to adjust for his timetable but<br>great to be able to get some of them<br>anyway<br>um<br>so I just wanted to<br>introduce you to the Wellington School<br>of Business and government<br>um as a capital city

The<br>Beehive<br>um and in this slide you can see one of<br>our professors um Ella Noy standing um<br>up to his knees in our water on the<br>Wellington Waterfront now he's an<br>economist and he researches and teaches<br>about the economic impact of disasters<br>and climate change<br>um and that's what makes us wee bit<br>different as a business school and means<br>our students gain sort of a valuable set<br>of skills that prepare them for<br>interesting and productive careers<br>because we combine both business and<br>you're on the Puppeteer campus at the<br>moment those of you that are
