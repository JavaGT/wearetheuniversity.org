These ideas are taught in university business schools, leadership programmes, and reflected in popular books written for managers. While influential, these ideas often bear little resemblance to what theorists originally wrote.<br><br>In this lecture, Professor Todd Bridgman will explain why he’s spent the past 15 years myth busting management. He argues misrepresentations contribute to organisational dysfunction and damage, and understanding how and why this happens creates space for alternative ways of learning about and practising management. Given the pressing environmental, social, and economic challenges facing the world today, Professor Bridgman will share why we need to think more critically and creatively about people, organisations and how we work.</p><h2>Transcript</h2><p style="opacity: 0.9; font-size: 0.8em">Transcripts may be automatically generated and may not be 100% accurate.</p><p>you are a cat or well this is this feels<br>very strange this this feels strange for<br>a lot of reasons this is I've lectured<br>in this room so many times but it's it's<br>nothing like uh tonight I assure you<br>it's I've I don't usually wear this gown<br>or even a tie first time lecturing a tie<br>um I normally have probably a tenth of<br>the the attendance in this room so<br>that's really unusual but it's great I<br>actually this is what it used to be like<br>when I came here 15 years ago teaching<br>an undergraduate class which was full<br>like this and just the energy<br>um yeah it's amazing it's different now<br>because of online learning and recorded<br>lectures but it's great to I think<br>probably have one last experience of<br>lecturing in front of people<br>um<br>it's a different lecture because uh I'm<br>not going to ask you any questions about<br>the content there's no test or exam at<br>the end of it<br>uh you're not allowed to ask me<br>questions either so that this is an old<br>school lecture uh it's old school<br>because I'm going to read this<br>uh so I have prepared my my uh words of<br>wisdom or not and I'm just going to get<br>on and read it and um<br>hope that you stick with me along the<br>all right I am actually going to weave a<br>little bit of personal stuff as well<br>because<br>um those experiences that I've had have<br>kind of led me to the research that Mike<br>very kindly introduced before I feel<br>very lucky to be a University academic<br>because we're encouraged to teach and<br>research<br>and I can't see what I'm reading what<br>we're passionate about my research is<br>personal and it's also political<br>not in the sense of political parties<br>political in the sense of Desiring<br>change that we should stop perpetuating<br>these myths of management that we should<br>teach management differently at school<br>University and in management and<br>leadership programs in the workplace and<br>most importantly of all that we should<br>do management differently now I realize<br>that is a very Grand ambition more<br>realistically I hope we can pause and<br>reflect on some of the taken for granted<br>Common Sense views of what good<br>management is<br>I was very interested in business when I<br>was young firstly because of my brother<br>John who's here tonight<br>who launched a small business making<br>covers for musical cassettes and then my<br>brother-in-law Simon who got me<br>interested in the share market this was<br>the mid-1980s and I had great fun with<br>my father Barry who's in the front row<br>here<br>buying shares in high-flying companies<br>like Chase Corporation and judge court<br>and they're not so much fun watching<br>them Crash and Burn following the 1987<br>market crash in my sixth form year or<br>year 12 as my kids would know it I was<br>chief executive of our school's young<br>Enterprise company which rang ran a Tuck<br>Shop and produced School crested<br>umbrellas and sweatshirts and here I am<br>in this shot with sir Alan hellaby at<br>the awards presentation in November<br>1989. alas I would not become the Tycoon<br>of tomorrow<br>when I left school I had no interest in<br>going to University somewhat's my<br>parents surprise I think having been put<br>through an expensive private school<br>education and performed well<br>academically I'd studied journalism at<br>school I'll liked writing and I liked<br>the pressure of deadlines so I enrolled<br>in the journalism course at Auckland<br>Institute of Technology and 24 weeks<br>later I merged with my certificate in<br>journalism and a job as a reporter at<br>the total times I was young still 17 and<br>moving away from home to a town where I<br>knew nobody seemed a big step<br>it was 1991 the employment contracts Act<br>was being introduced undermining the<br>power of trade unions and the economy<br>was in deep recession<br>Minister of Finance Ruth Richardson<br>delivered her so-called mother of all<br>budgets cutting the welfare state and<br>introducing user pays the start of her<br>reforms not so fondly known as Ruth in<br>Asia<br>paid now and they certainly weren't then<br>cash but I was grateful to have a job at<br>the end of my journalism course I was<br>the only one of 25 graduates to have<br>found one<br>less than two years later having told my<br>parents that I had no interest in<br>attending University I enrolled at the<br>University of Auckland and moved back<br>home and I've been at University ever<br>since<br>foreign<br>business and involved in a bachelor of<br>Commerce I also enrolled in The Bachelor<br>of Arts majoring in political studies<br>growing up my parents had been active in<br>their local National Party branch<br>that was exciting because from 1975 to<br>1984 our local MP Robert Muldoon was New<br>Zealand's prime minister and here he is<br>celebrating election night 1975 with his<br>wife Thea and my mum sitting in the<br>front row in the front row here as well<br>in my business courses at University I<br>was starting to have some serious doubts<br>about what I was learning<br>in marketing my textbook said that<br>marketing exists to satisfy the needs<br>and wants of consumers it seemed to me<br>that marketing didn't just satisfy our<br>needs and wants it helped create them<br>and through advertising convince us that<br>we should satisfy those needs and wants<br>by purchasing the product<br>I bought the marketing textbook at the<br>second hand shop and intended to sell it<br>there at the end of the course<br>it wasn't an opportunity on that course<br>to debate the definition of marketing I<br>just had to memorize it so I started<br>writing my critique of the material in<br>the margins of the textbook<br>it helped relieve my frustration and<br>probably naively I thought I would<br>in my study of management what I was<br>learning didn't explain very well my<br>experience at the topple times<br>the textbook was written by Stephen<br>Robbins an American<br>and and the world's best-selling<br>textbook author the book's message was<br>that the employment relationship is a<br>consensual one that owners managers and<br>employees work together to achieve a<br>common goal that being a productive and<br>profitable organization I could relate<br>to this perspective because in taupo we<br>had a competitor newspaper the Topo<br>Weekender all of us at the Topo times<br>wanted to be number one<br>but Stephen Robbins textbook did not<br>speak to other parts of my work<br>experience<br>within three weeks of starting at the<br>Topol times I was caught up in an<br>industrial dispute<br>the company that owned us independent<br>newspapers limited wanted to reduce the<br>annual entitlement annual leave<br>entitlement for new staff from four<br>weeks to three<br>I was told by colleagues that I should<br>join the Union<br>which I did I learned a valuable lesson<br>from that experience well I shared with<br>the paper owners the common goal of<br>trying to be the best newspaper in town<br>we also had interest that collided<br>shareholders understandably wanted a<br>better return on their investment and in<br>a recession where unemployment was high<br>management had decided that was best<br>achieved by reducing the working<br>conditions of Staff as a rocky reporter<br>I felt in a powerless position arguing<br>with the owners of a publicly listed<br>Corporation I was grateful I had the<br>Union on my side<br>my management textbook at University 700<br>pages long<br>did not once mention the word Union it<br>showed no light on that real world<br>experience of work<br>the textbook assumed that the goal of<br>managers was to maximize profits to the<br>owners<br>this created with me because I got to<br>know well the manager of the taupo times<br>Kevin Webb and that dispute over our<br>annual leave I knew Kevin was conflicted<br>he had a director from head office that<br>he was expected to implement yet he knew<br>this would make a staff who he cared<br>about worse off<br>it annoyed me that in my management<br>course there was no opportunity to<br>debate these ideas the assignments were<br>all about what managers should do to<br>maximize productivity and profit in one<br>assignment I argued there shouldn't be<br>the objective the market said that I<br>hadn't answered the question and I got a<br>low grade<br>this created a dilemma for me because<br>because I was very concerned about<br>getting A's<br>I soon worked out<br>that if I stayed within the ideological<br>boundaries of the field I would get high<br>grades<br>now for some of you describing a<br>textbook as ideological might be a<br>controversial claim aren't textbooks<br>based on scientific research aren't they<br>Stephen Robbins the author of my<br>undergraduate management textbook gave a<br>revealing interview when he was asked do<br>you see your text boxes propaganda do<br>you see them as ideology and here is his<br>response<br>I see my boxes supporting an ideology<br>but of course all textbooks sell in<br>ideology organizational behavior books<br>for the most part support a managerial<br>perspective this reflects the market<br>Business Schools we need to genuflect<br>the gods of productivity efficiency<br>goals Etc we reflect business school<br>values<br>in my political studies courses I also<br>learned that staying in the ideological<br>Lane pay dividends but in those courses<br>it was helpful if I positioned myself as<br>left-wing in the sense of believing in<br>the important role by government<br>to constrain Market forces<br>one of the skills I honed at University<br>was working out the ideological views of<br>the lecturer and fitting that back to<br>them in assignments<br>it got me the a grades I desperately<br>wanted but I didn't like it I didn't<br>believe a university education should be<br>about socializing students into a<br>particular worldview one of the reasons<br>I became a journalist was I love the<br>idea of the media as the fourth estate<br>holding those in authority to account<br>and here I was at University and had an<br>authority my lecturers and my course<br>here is section 268 of the New Zealand<br>Education and Training act the<br>legislation that grants universities<br>the ability to confer degrees and charge<br>fees I wasn't aware of this legislation<br>when I was a student but it nicely<br>captures what I expected University to<br>be about<br>section 268 lays out the distinctive<br>characteristics of universities what<br>makes them different to other providers<br>in the tertiary sector polytechs wananga<br>private training establishments<br>I've highlighted in bold two points<br>the first<br>the principal aim of universities is to<br>develop intellectual Independence to be<br>exposed to a wide range of perspectives<br>to use those perspectives to generate<br>different ways of understanding the<br>world and to think critically about the<br>strengths and limitations of all<br>perspectives and ultimately to form our<br>own judgments to get an education to<br>learn how to think not be told what to<br>think<br>now it's the second point in bold<br>universities in New Zealand and we are<br>unique in the world for this have a<br>legislated requirement to accept the<br>role as critic and conscience of society<br>to do research and develop expertise and<br>to use our relative Independence as an<br>institution within Society to hold those<br>in power to account in our teaching in<br>our research and intervention in the<br>public Arena it it's a similar idea to<br>the fourth estate role of the media that<br>attracted me to journalism<br>it's also important to know what is not<br>mentioned in this section<br>there is no mention that the distinctive<br>role of university is to train people<br>for jobs<br>that's the role of others in the<br>tertiary sector a training is what I got<br>studying journalism at Polytechnic I<br>learned how to type how to take<br>shorthand how to interview and how to<br>write a story so that on my first day at<br>the total times I knew what to do it<br>wasn't an education I was never invited<br>to consider the role of Journalism in<br>society or other deeper questions there<br>was no scope to form independent<br>intellectual judgments<br>the distinction between training and<br>education shapes how I teach management<br>I don't sit about to train students how<br>to be managers<br>that's not to say I don't want my<br>students to get good jobs I'm trying to<br>develop generic skills that employers<br>find valuable analytical skills critical<br>thinking communication and creativity<br>and developing those skills through the<br>study of management<br>so what has all this got to do with my<br>research<br>the textbook I reacted against as an<br>undergraduate student 30 years ago is is<br>all the world's biggest selling textbook<br>today<br>Robin's management textbook is now in<br>its 20th Edition<br>and while it is updated with<br>contemporary concerns and current cases<br>at its core it hasn't changed much it<br>still assumes that the purpose of<br>studying management is to be trained to<br>be a manager it still looks from this<br>managerial perspective and it is still<br>trying to socialize students into a<br>singular and narrow ideological view<br>what Robbins calls business school<br>values and that still annoys me so for<br>the past 15 years working with my<br>colleague<br>here at the School of Management Stephen<br>Cummings together with collaborators<br>here and overseas including some<br>excellent postgraduate students I've<br>dedicated my research time to busting<br>myths about management ideas represented<br>in these textbooks<br>management is a young field it's not a<br>real academic discipline like psychology<br>sociology or philosophy<br>to gain academic credibility it has<br>created a history filled with famous<br>names from other disciplines Adam Smith<br>from philosophy Max Weber from sociology<br>Kurt Lewin and Abraham Maslow from<br>psychology to name a few none were<br>writing about management yet their ideas<br>have become foundational theories of the<br>field of management<br>sadly their ideas have been<br>misrepresented they've been taken out of<br>context twisted and filtered through<br>business school values these ideas that<br>be a little resemblance to what those<br>theorists wrote concern how to mote and<br>motivated lead people organize work<br>develop culture and transform<br>organizations they shape how we manage<br>staff and how we are managed by our<br>bosses I argue these myths of management<br>serve us poorly contributing to<br>dysfunction and damage in our<br>organizations we can do better than this<br>we can teach management differently and<br>I want to start with a simple but<br>important distinction between history<br>and the past<br>a conventional view of history is to see<br>it as a factual objective account of<br>what happened in the past why it<br>happened and who was important in making<br>it happen<br>I take a different view defining the<br>paths as events that have occurred and<br>history as a story or Narrative of those<br>past events<br>the past cannot speak for itself history<br>is our Connection to the Past the<br>producer of History must make decisions<br>about which events to highlight and<br>which to relegate to a minor mention or<br>are meant altogether which people to<br>give prominence to and which to exclude<br>the point is that we can create many<br>different histories of the same past<br>histories are subjective not objective<br>those who get to produce history are<br>influential they shape our understanding<br>of the past<br>in my research I treat management<br>textbooks as histories of management<br>textbook authors and Publishers make<br>decisions about which people and their<br>ideas to include and which to leave out<br>they represent those ideas in particular<br>ways they shape our understanding of<br>what management is and they shape<br>therefore our expectations of how we<br>will be managed and how we will manage<br>others<br>one of my earliest projects with Steve<br>was to contribute to a bait to a debate<br>about why there are so few genuinely new<br>ideas and management<br>we argued that our field is limited by<br>its history<br>we surveyed the most highly regarded<br>journals of management and business<br>history to examine the geographical<br>locations they focused on WE coded more<br>than 2 000 articles and produced this<br>map of the world to represent the data<br>as you can see two anglo-giants the US<br>and UK dominate Australia New Zealand<br>just about hold their own while Africa<br>Asia and South America shrink to slivers<br>this picture of where management ideas<br>comes from tells only part of the story<br>two African-American colleagues of ours<br>Leon prito and Simone Phipps have shown<br>how the contributions of<br>African-American men and women have been<br>almost completely excluded from<br>the same has happened in this country<br>with the contributions of Maori largely<br>excluded<br>independent newspapers limited the<br>company who owned the Topol times is now<br>called Stuff the popular News website<br>two years ago they issued this apology<br>to Maori they acknowledged their<br>newspapers were started by European<br>settlers and written for those settlers<br>they reflected their worldview promoted<br>their interests and in doing so<br>disadvantage Maori for example they<br>perpetuated the myth that Maori knew<br>nothing of trade and business until it<br>was bought here by pakiha despite there<br>being a thriving Maori economy before<br>Colonial settlement<br>this is the limits of History our view<br>of the past is limited by the histories<br>that we have they show no understanding<br>not just of the past<br>but the present and possibilities for<br>the future but thankfully if we accept<br>the distinction between the past and<br>history then history is not fixed for<br>and that's what I did with Steve and<br>these two colleagues from the UK in this<br>book a new history of management that<br>had quite possibly the least diverse<br>I guess I was slightly younger in my<br>hair at that time slightly Browner but<br>that's about the only difference<br>the source of embarrassment now actually<br>well the book got some excellent reviews<br>some traditional management historians<br>were not fans<br>I think they missed our point that we<br>were offering a new history of<br>management not the new definitive<br>history that should replace theirs<br>we wrote the book to encourage others to<br>write histories from places and people<br>excluded from the conventional history<br>of our field are pleased to see that six<br>years later there are researchers around<br>the world doing that work they are<br>changing that map of the world I showed<br>earlier<br>my own contribution to this broader<br>project is to focus on management<br>textbooks exploring the origins of the<br>most well-known theories it's not<br>heavily theoretical or intellectually<br>sophisticated I actually describe it as<br>academic journalism<br>one of the things that journalism taught<br>me was to think carefully about who your<br>audience was and how to engage them I<br>want my research to be widely read I<br>want it to make a difference I want to<br>make it difficult for textbook authors<br>to keep publishing management myths so<br>the research works like this<br>select a well-known Theory analyze how<br>textbooks present it compare it with<br>what the theorist actually wrote develop<br>an explanation for how and why those<br>misrepresentations happened and explain<br>why it matters<br>published in a well-ranked academic<br>Journal but don't stop there promote the<br>work shamelessly on social media<br>cultivate relationships with General<br>journalists in the mainstream media in<br>the United States who want to write<br>feature articles and send the research<br>to textbook authors make it hard for<br>them to ignore it<br>now in the overview of this lecture I<br>mentioned lots of theorists whose work<br>is misrepresented Adam Smith Frederick<br>Taylor makes Faber and Abraham Maslow to<br>ensure we have time for food and drink<br>afterwards I won't talk about them all<br>I'll focus on the area of leadership and<br>change these are two big topics in<br>management and it's the area where I see<br>the most damage caused by management<br>myths<br>the foundational theory of change<br>management is Kurt lewin's unfreeze<br>change refreeze model of organizational<br>change<br>Lewin one of the world's most famous<br>social psychologists died in 1947.<br>if you haven't heard of Lewin don't<br>worry I think you'll be familiar with<br>his idea the theory states that<br>organizations are hard to change they<br>tend towards a steady state the task of<br>leadership is to unfreeze them to create<br>an understanding that change is<br>necessary that requires a vision and<br>skills to overcome those who are<br>resistant to change once the change is<br>implemented the leader needs to refreeze<br>the organization so the change becomes<br>the new business as usual<br>this project started with a conversation<br>with Steve we both taught the model for<br>years but had never been able to find<br>lewin's original writing on it<br>to cut a very long story short despite<br>being a prolific writer Lewin only ever<br>wrote one paragraph on change as three<br>steps and it wasn't about organizational<br>change<br>one way to illustrate the myth is<br>through French and Bell's popular<br>textbook organizational development<br>the fifth edition says Lewin introduced<br>two ideas that have been influential<br>since the 1940s changes three steps and<br>has force field analysis<br>but they made no mention of changes<br>through his deaths until 1990. they<br>didn't mention it before then because it<br>changes three steps was developed in the<br>1980s more than 30 years after lewin's<br>death the model makes assumptions about<br>leaders and followers and about the<br>nature of change it reinforces the<br>heroic portrayal of leaders as highly<br>skilled powerful people who can change<br>organizations according to their desire<br>the model assumes that change is<br>necessary and in the best interests of<br>the organization it also implies that<br>only leaders can see the Need For Change<br>other employees can't and are likely to<br>resist it the change Leader's job is to<br>overcome this resistance to drive the<br>change down through the layers of the<br>organization<br>Lewin was a psychologist not a<br>management theorist<br>although he was involved in one major<br>study of corporate change<br>this study concluded that change was<br>most successful when those affected were<br>meaningfully involved in designing and<br>implementing the change rather than it<br>being determined by a small group at the<br>top of the organization<br>I think Lewin would be horrified by<br>seeing his name attributed to this model<br>so why was a model developed by others<br>decades after lewin's death misleadingly<br>attributed to him<br>a new field of a new subfield of change<br>management where organizations are<br>transformed by senior Executives emerged<br>in the 1980s to challenge the field of<br>organizational development which had<br>humanistic and Democratic Values<br>this new subfield of change management<br>needed a history to give it credibility<br>Lewin one of the 20th Century's most<br>respected social sciences was the ideal<br>Choice change has three steps seemingly<br>common sense<br>academically proven and relevant to<br>managers it ticked all the boxes<br>providing just the kind of content that<br>management textbooks were looking for<br>so why does the myth of lewins change as<br>three steps matter it matters because<br>it's the foundation of many modern<br>change models including the most<br>well-known John cotter's eight steps for<br>transforming organizations<br>it supports a whole change management<br>industry where experts are brought in to<br>unfreeze change and refreeze<br>organizations<br>the model reinforces what has become<br>taken for granted Common Sense ways of<br>when I teach leadership I start by<br>asking students about the difference<br>between leadership and management<br>leadership they generally say is about<br>having a vision Charisma inspiration<br>courage self-confidence and strength of<br>conviction management is about<br>compliance process giving orders and<br>formal Authority<br>management textbooks reinforce this view<br>have a look at this diagram from a<br>best-selling textbook note how it<br>creates a binary distinction between<br>leadership and management<br>see also the value judgment that it<br>places on leadership and management<br>leaders are seen in a positive light<br>confident seizing opportunities and<br>making things happen the descriptions of<br>managers are negative they are<br>threatened by new situations and wait<br>for things to happen<br>when I show this diagram to students I<br>ask them who would you prefer to be a<br>leader or a manager unsurprisingly with<br>this description nobody wants to be a<br>manager<br>this diagram is from a textbook called<br>management<br>in the School of Management<br>it's a curious feature of management as<br>a field of study that had it it has<br>evolved to a point where it denigrates<br>the very occupation that bears its name<br>managers according to this<br>representation are losers<br>so let's summarize the picture of change<br>and Leadership that we learn from<br>management textbooks<br>change and leadership are interconnected<br>leaders are people who create change<br>in contrast managers can't or won't<br>change<br>should be implemented on organizations<br>from the top down leaders create the<br>vision for others in the organization to<br>follow<br>let's now look more closely at a<br>foundational theory of leadership and<br>then I want to say a little bit about<br>probably the most influential leadership<br>Theory today is transformational<br>leadership created by political<br>scientists James McGregor Burns in the<br>late 1970s<br>Burns through his historical analysis of<br>American presidents distinguished<br>between transactional and<br>transformational Leadership<br>he was sick of transactional politicians<br>who engaged in Port Barrel politics<br>effectively buying votes and campaign<br>contributions with Promises of subsidies<br>or new infrastructure<br>Burns wanted transformational Leaders<br>with visions of a brighter future that<br>transformational leadership was for<br>burns moral leadership because followers<br>choose their leaders he says ultimately<br>the moral legitimacy of transformational<br>leadership is grounded in conscious<br>Choice among real Alternatives that's<br>his emphasis<br>remember Burns is a political scientist<br>candidates articulate their visions and<br>those who are voted in are held<br>accountable at the next election for<br>their performance<br>informational leadership is in essence a<br>democratic process<br>Burns's Theory had little impact in<br>political science but has had a huge<br>impact in management studies<br>transformational leaders are heroic<br>inspirational figures whose visions of<br>the future inspire employees resulting<br>in employees working harder being more<br>committed to the organization and<br>ultimately generating higher levels of<br>performance<br>transformational leadership is a theory<br>of politics translated for business<br>but one critical aspect of the theory<br>got Lost in Translation conveniently and<br>quietly forgotten by those who<br>introduced it to management studies<br>the Democratic essence of the theory<br>that the moral legitimacy of<br>transformational leaders comes from<br>being voted in by the people they lead<br>when I ask people what they value most<br>about living in this country many will<br>say democracy<br>so why don't we extend this to work<br>we love living in democracy yet we spend<br>much of our week at work in some form of<br>dictatorship<br>of course there are arguments against<br>more democratic organizations<br>employees usually don't have an<br>ownership stake in the business and<br>therefore shouldn't be trusted with a<br>vote they might vote in leaders who will<br>give them pay Rises or go easy on them<br>or they don't know enough about the<br>business and its environment to choose<br>the best leader<br>my proposal for more democracy at work<br>might sound a little crazy but let me<br>point out the damage and dysfunction<br>that results from these myths of changes<br>three steps and transformational<br>Leadership<br>to prove oneself as an organizational<br>leader today you require a vision for<br>transforming it you have to make your<br>mark<br>many organizations are damaged by<br>transformational leaders appointed from<br>outside the organization to implement<br>their Grand Vision they generally don't<br>understand the organization they<br>alienate the people who know it well and<br>they don't stick around long enough to<br>see their changes through in short they<br>are not accountable to the people they<br>lead and words they get their next job<br>on the basis of having transformed the<br>last organization they were at<br>irrespective of the success of those<br>changes they use the organization as a<br>stepping stone on their career path<br>the organization and its people get<br>walked over<br>I've taught many MBA students some of<br>whom are here today and thank you so<br>much for coming<br>and I've experienced it myself they have<br>experience that I've experienced it I<br>don't blame these transformational<br>leaders they were it seem to me good<br>people they were just doing what they<br>were expected to do they were just<br>enacting what we Define strong<br>leadership to be<br>we'd be better off thinking again about<br>what strong leadership is and thinking<br>again about its nonsensical assumption<br>that change is necessarily better than<br>the status quo<br>I've talked so far about theories that<br>are brought into management studies from<br>other disciplines and how they get<br>twisted and filtered through the<br>ideological values of our field but I'm<br>also interested in theories that are<br>relevant to our experience at work yet<br>don't get included in management<br>textbooks<br>I learned about Stanley milgram's<br>classic obedience experiments studying<br>psychology as an undergraduate conducted<br>at Yale University in the 1960s<br>participants in Milgram experiments<br>thought they were taking part in a study<br>on the effects of punishment on learning<br>they were given the role of teacher and<br>ordered by a man in a white lab coat to<br>administer electric shocks to a learner<br>strapped in a chair<br>beginning at 15 volts and increasing<br>after each incorrect answer to 450 volts<br>the studies were designed to see how far<br>participants would go before refusing to<br>obey<br>the results surprise Milgram with 65<br>percent continuing all the way to 450<br>volts<br>how could such extreme levels of Cruelty<br>by Otherwise decent people be explained<br>Milgram theorized that as obedience to<br>Authority<br>in the debrief after the experiments had<br>finished<br>participants said they were not<br>responsible<br>the man in the white lab coat was to<br>my social psychology textbook celebrated<br>Milgram and those who disobeyed<br>Authority<br>it takes great courage as we can see<br>from this famous image from Tiananmen<br>Square in 1989.<br>social psychology teaches us that we<br>that we are particularly susceptible to<br>the dangers of authority at work<br>sometimes we're asked to do something by<br>our boss that isn't ethical for example<br>it's hard to say no we put at risk our<br>chances of promotion and maybe even our<br>job<br>curiously by management textbook was<br>full of social psychologists like Kurt<br>Lewin who I've discussed already<br>but it didn't include Milgram<br>why not<br>after all milgram's experiments are<br>regarded as the most famous social<br>research I've published this year<br>compares the coverage of milgram's<br>experiment psychology so<br>in Psychology and management textbooks<br>Robert Barron has written both<br>best-selling textbooks in both Fields<br>his social psychology textbook devotes<br>many pages to Milgram he went to high<br>school with milgram's niece and writes<br>about the dismay he felt when she told<br>him about her uncle's experiments<br>Baron's career took him from psychology<br>into management<br>the coverage of milgram's experiments in<br>the first edition of his organizational<br>behavior textbook in 1984 was a copy and<br>paste from a social psychology textbook<br>yet in the second edition Milgram was<br>gone and he wasn't mentioned in any<br>subsequent Edition<br>so I contacted Baron to ask why<br>I see it in your psychology book you say<br>we must learn about the dangers of<br>obedience to Authority especially at<br>work<br>you say it as our duty to disobey<br>Baron explained that the reviewers of<br>the first edition said that Milgram was<br>off Target for management that it didn't<br>fit within the field of management so he<br>followed their advice and removed it<br>this crystallized everything that I'd<br>experienced as a student back in the<br>1990s and all my research on management<br>textbooks for the past 15 years<br>academic Fields have ideological<br>commitments<br>social psychology has an ideological<br>commitment to self-determination and<br>resistance to Authority milgram's<br>experiments validate this<br>but they do not fit with the ideological<br>commitments of management studies what<br>Stephen Robbins caused business school<br>values<br>management textbooks want students to<br>obey their bosses not disobey them<br>management textbooks say they want to<br>teach students to think like a manager<br>but by excluding Milgram I argue that<br>you're really wanting to socialize<br>students to be compliant employees<br>why does this matter our organizations<br>need employees who are prepared to<br>challenge people in authority<br>that is really hard to do<br>because for most of us through childhood<br>adolescence and into adulthood in the<br>home at school at University and at work<br>we are encouraged to respect authority<br>figures and be compliant followers and<br>we generally get rewarded for this<br>we can't expect employees to go against<br>the grain and speak up we must cultivate<br>organizational cultures that encourage<br>the focus of my research is how we teach<br>management to students<br>I started this lecture by talking about<br>my experience as an undergraduate it<br>didn't explain well my own experience of<br>work at the Topol times and I didn't<br>like being socialized into business<br>school values<br>it wasn't for me what a university<br>education should be about<br>30 years later I still draw on that<br>experience to inform how I teach<br>management today I don't use a<br>best-selling textbook to teach my<br>students I use this book<br>which I wrote with Steve Cummings<br>it's not a bestseller<br>I teach Management in a way that I wish<br>I'd been taught at in a way that is<br>consistent with the distinctive<br>characteristics of universities and<br>Shrine and legislation<br>to cultivate intellectual independence<br>by exposing students to radically<br>different ways of thinking about<br>organizations and Society from free<br>market capitalism to Marxism<br>to teach students how to think<br>critically by encouraging them to<br>critique their textbook my book<br>like I did as an undergraduate and to<br>encourage students to be creative to<br>draw on their own experiences of work<br>and management ideas from their own<br>places and cultures<br>hopefully my manage my obsession with<br>management textbooks isn't merely an<br>academic exercise<br>if we can teach management differently<br>and those students take that knowledge<br>with them into their careers maybe we<br>can over time do management differently<br>so what changes would I like to see<br>I would like organizations to be less<br>like calls we're challenging your boss<br>it's taken as a sign that you care and<br>are courageous<br>not a sign that you're a problem<br>employee<br>I would like organizations to be more<br>democratic to make our experience of<br>work genuinely empowering<br>empowerment is too often a management<br>buzzword that has been stripped of any<br>meaningful sense of handing over<br>Authority<br>I would like the people trusted with<br>leading change to know the organization<br>care about the organization and stick<br>around long enough to be accountable for<br>the success or failure of those changes<br>I would like leaders to implement fewer<br>change initiatives<br>it would help reduce change fatigue and<br>cynicism the two most prevalent<br>responses to change<br>I would like top-down change to be the<br>exception rather than the norm<br>we can change organizations from the<br>bottom up one illustration of this is<br>how organizations are adapting to the<br>fluidity and fracturing of gender<br>the people driving those changes are our<br>young people and they're doing it from<br>the bottom of the organizational<br>hierarchy<br>organizations could listen more to their<br>young people<br>it's easy to think with age comes wisdom<br>and that we all these know best but I<br>have the privilege of teaching young<br>people and they understand better than<br>us the challenges we Face especially<br>climate change<br>now I want to finish that where I<br>started with the distinction between the<br>past and history<br>the lesson is that we can write many<br>different histories of what has happened<br>in the past<br>the history I've crafted in this lecture<br>is one where I was destined to do this<br>research<br>my experiences at the topal times my<br>responses to the textbooks I studied in<br>Auckland one led to the next it all<br>fitted together perfectly<br>articles published in highly ranked<br>journals and the odd book or two along<br>the way it's a great story<br>I could have crafted a different history<br>I could have talked about being so<br>lonely both in Topo and at Auckland<br>because I didn't go to with my friends<br>to University straight from school<br>I could have talked more about being an<br>insecure overachiever striving<br>desperately for the highest grades to<br>feel good about myself<br>I could have written about the Imposter<br>syndrome I felt as a new PhD student at<br>University of Cambridge or about the<br>struggles I had a few years coming after<br>a few years after coming to Wellington<br>totally mentally and physically drained<br>by raising four kids amazing four kids<br>with Maria<br>getting my research and rejected by<br>Journal editors who saw no merit in it<br>it was too journalistic they said<br>I'm ending with this because I don't<br>want to leave you with the impression<br>that it was smooth sailing or that I<br>always knew what I wanted to do with my<br>career<br>there's been doubts and tough times<br>along the way and in those moments it<br>helped me to know that others had gone<br>through tough times as well<br>for many years I didn't know where to<br>focus my research I've ended up a<br>management historian of sorts despite<br>having having never taken a course in<br>history at school or at University<br>finally a few words about the future of<br>the University<br>many of you will be aware of the<br>financial crisis facing this University<br>and almost all others around the country<br>there's a lot of causes covert the loss<br>of international students a broken<br>sector funding model that hasn't kept up<br>with inflation<br>but it's more than a financial crisis<br>it's an existential crisis that forces<br>us to confront fundamental questions<br>about our identity and purpose what do<br>in my application for the head of School<br>of Management role earlier this year I<br>was asked to outline my vision for the<br>school in a seminar to staff<br>the irony was that I just finished a<br>paper critiquing the idea that leaders<br>but I needed one obviously<br>so I see it let's do this<br>we don't talk enough about this because<br>the university education has been<br>progressively commercialized and<br>commodified<br>students are encouraged to think about<br>their education as a financial<br>investment that they need to generate a<br>return on universities are encouraged to<br>think about their degrees as products<br>that can be sold to Consumers<br>if we the university continue down this<br>path we undermine our case for<br>government funding<br>we need to remind government that this<br>is what you require us to do and that<br>requires your investment<br>Beyond finances we're also facing a<br>crisis about what we teach<br>given the development of artificial<br>intelligence tools like chat GPT<br>I reckon we have to prepare our students<br>to do what AI tools can't to understand<br>and respect different views to be<br>critical reflexive and creative thinkers<br>to be human basically<br>the good news is that this is our<br>mandate<br>to educate students and be educated by<br>them<br>for all of us students and faculty<br>together to develop expertise and use<br>that expertise to address the social<br>economic political and environmental<br>challenges that we collectively face<br>I'd like to acknowledge Professor Todd<br>Bridgeman<br>acting Provost Professor Mike Wilson and<br>all of you a huge circle of guests from<br>all walks of life here tonight<br>the university and particularly the<br>Wellington School of Business and<br>government is proud to host you all for<br>this treat of a lecture and the<br>celebration of Todd's well-deserved<br>professorship<br>I'm Professor Jane Bryson I'm the dean<br>of the welcome School of Business and<br>government or iriki and I won't even<br>begin to speculate about whether a Dean<br>manages leads or models for a moon I<br>suspect I muddle through nor in what<br>fashion but the lecture we've just heard<br>clearly prompts all of us<br>to reflect on what we do how we do it<br>why we do it and the alignment of our<br>actions with beliefs and values about<br>how we would prefer to be treated at<br>work and in life<br>it's my distinct honor and privilege to<br>propose the vote of thanks tonight to<br>our colleague Professor Todd Bridgeman<br>Todd is a very hard act to follow so<br>I'll be brief<br>and really I can do no better than quote<br>from the beginning of the letter I wrote<br>to the promotions committee when Todd<br>applied for promotion to Professor<br>it said freely and without recourse to<br>Todd Bridgeman is the real deal<br>he is a dedicated thoughtful and very<br>talented academic researcher teacher and<br>leader yes I use the L word<br>and an excellent colleague to all<br>Wellington School of Business and<br>government and the university are very<br>lucky to have them on the staff<br>I would add particularly as today he is<br>not getting any younger today is Todd's<br>and there's inaugural lecture Todd's<br>taken us on a very personal journey of<br>what has motored motivated him to<br>question received wisdom to expose<br>underlying assumptions and ideological<br>drivers which have filtered and<br>distorted the intent of the work of<br>researchers such as Maslow Lewin Taylor<br>Burns Viber Smith and others<br>not only does he bust myths but he<br>aspires and models better management and<br>workplace practice in his teaching and<br>in his own management<br>as a faculty we are a group of six<br>schools covering a host of disciplines<br>focused on Commerce business and<br>government<br>by our very nature we Embrace a range of<br>disciplinary perspectives and we bring<br>those to bear on examining the<br>responsibilities and challenges of<br>organizing ourselves as communities and<br>societies<br>of how we generate and distribute<br>resources of how we value and treat each<br>other and our activities and<br>contributions<br>what Todd has so ably highlighted<br>tonight is the embedded ideologies that<br>can drive our perspectives<br>such that even the well-intentioned<br>person can end up unintentionally<br>perpetuating an ideology<br>through myths passed on and on<br>until they are accepted as definitive<br>Todd is a critical management scholar<br>and through his craft he shows us that<br>we need to be thoughtful<br>to interrogate the driving values and<br>assumptions underpinning theories views<br>and practices<br>and that we can all do this as Educators<br>as researchers as workers as Citizens<br>members of communities that we wish to<br>be fair and to thrive<br>so as the only thing standing between<br>you and the opportunity to get on with<br>that and the opportunity to celebrate<br>Todd's great inaugural and his 50th<br>birthday I invite you to Refreshments on<br>the mezzanine floor which you can access<br>out the doors and up the central<br>stairway or people sitting at the top<br>can access out the back there<br>um and I say to<br>toddwe thank you and congratulations on<br>becoming a professor of a certain age<br>let's show our congratulations once<br>again</p></main><footer style="margin-top: 2rem; background: #0001; padding: 2rem; text-align: center;"><p>We Are The University</p><ul style="list-style-type: none; padding: 0; margin:
