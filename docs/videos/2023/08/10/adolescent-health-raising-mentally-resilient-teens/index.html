Professor<br>Suzanne pichummer and I get to welcome<br>you on this very cold night and to what<br>I hope is a little bit warmer of a<br>lecture theater<br>um the waiter that I begun my the<br>evening with is one that many of you may<br>be familiar with it was written by<br>hiddenly<br>Melbourne and it's about the<br>kahikatia tree and what I love about the<br>kahika Tia tree is that as it grows it<br>has really really shallow roots<br>and so they grow in groves so that their<br>Roots intertwine and strengthen each<br>other so that the only way that they can<br>survive as trees is to be clustered<br>together and to be intertwined<br>and um I think it's really relevant to<br>our discussion this evening about<br>rangatahi hawora a youth house and the<br>importance of us as a village<br>working and supporting and strengthening<br>aurangatahi so that they can really<br>flourish and the environment that we are<br>creating for them and that they have<br>aspirations for themselves and I'm a<br>little bit biased to say that out of the<br>three Public Health lectures we're<br>presenting this may be my favorite and<br>not just because these people are<br>amazing but also as a child psychologist<br>I think I have a personal bias I'm just<br>going to declare that now<br>so once again just on behalf of our team<br>welcome it's amazing to have you<br>alongside us this evening we promise<br>that it'll be fun entertaining educating<br>no pressure<br>um and I uh my husband said tonight and<br>he'll tell you that my dream as a 15<br>year old was to be on the Oprah show but<br>I am guessing this is the closest I'm<br>ever going to get so I'm living that<br>moment up so welcome and it's worth<br>great pleasure that I'll now introduce<br>you to our emcee for this evening the<br>thank you<br>foreign<br>thanks very much Suze beautiful singing<br>again<br>I'm the communications advisor here at<br>the University of otago Christchurch and<br>welcome everybody to what I hope is<br>going to be a wonderful night as Sue<br>said a bit of fun bit of information<br>something to set us all on our way as<br>parents and grandparents of course this<br>is a third of our fourth public talks to<br>celebrate kiamal the University of otago<br>Christ which is 50th anniversary and<br>we're here to celebrate our clinical<br>academic and research expertise<br>foreign<br>guide our work I'm sure that's the case<br>for all our experts here and what they<br>do every day<br>but also here as parents we all know our<br>children are all different very much so<br>and I know that more than most I've got<br>five three of my own two stepchildren<br>and a lovely blended family<br>um<br>as I've always seen right from the<br>beginning there's nothing more one thing<br>about child rearing it's unrelenting in<br>its relentlessness<br>every single day<br>um and another saying you're only as<br>happy as your unhappiest child<br>that's something I've always lived by<br>really and I think a lot of you might<br>understand that with children whether<br>they be happy one minute anxious the<br>next<br>upset disappointed thrilled you go<br>through the whole gamut of emotions with<br>them<br>all wonderful experts here tonight<br>who are going to talk about a wonderful<br>array of parenting issues some of you<br>may be facing or if you're Educators May<br>well be in your teaching environment as<br>well from vaping to fad diet to more<br>serious issues with diet in terms of<br>eating disorders<br>attends Mental Health social media sleep<br>issues like that which part of every day<br>having a team<br>we'll hear fiercely from Professor Tony<br>walls associate professor Jenny Jordan<br>associate professor Philip pattamore<br>Professor Richard Porter and Dr Jenny<br>Manuel<br>after their presentations if we<br>depending on how much time we have left<br>we'll have a quick q a session where you<br>can fire a couple of questions at the<br>experts if we run out of time they will<br>be hanging around for a few minutes<br>afterwards if you want to pop down and<br>say hello okay let's begin well Tony<br>walls Professor Tony walls is the head<br>of the campuses Department of Pediatrics<br>and a consultant pediatrician at tufata<br>or a Canterbury specializing in<br>infectious diseases his research<br>interests include the epidemiology of<br>childhood infections Bone and Joint<br>infections in children as well as<br>childhood vaccinations to prevent<br>serious disease Tony is an advisor at<br>pharmac and the health Ministry on<br>childhood vaccine matters and is<br>convener of the fifth year Medical<br>School teaching program here on campus<br>here in Pediatrics<br>he's also co-director of the recently<br>established research for children<br>aotearoa group which has brought expert<br>researchers together from across the<br>motto to enhance child research and Tony<br>will now very briefly just to start us<br>off as a short introduction to the<br>evening tell us what our research for<br>children aotearoa is all about<br>thanks very much Laura and good evening<br>around everyone it's lovely to see the<br>crowd here on a cold Christchurch<br>fantastic<br>so as a pediatrician I guess the first<br>thing I have to say is that I don't know<br>any more than most people about<br>teenagers<br>so I'll be relying on these guys the<br>experts<br>I'm going to talk mostly about our<br>research program as I'm kind of<br>representing the pediatric department<br>I really do and I won't really wanted to<br>just I'll be very brief but I want to<br>talk about research for children of<br>Terror<br>almost a year ago to the day we had some<br>beautiful singing In This Very lecture<br>theater with Professor pitama included<br>starting the Journey of our research<br>collaborative research for children<br>altered<br>we've had some great support across the<br>university and across the community and<br>this is a collaborative that brings<br>together not just our University but<br>other institutions across Canterbury and<br>across the rest of the country that are<br>interested and dedicated to Children's<br>if you're all ticked up you can go to<br>our website you guys will remember<br>covert where you just had to scan in so<br>if you want to get your phones and have<br>a look you can see some stories about<br>the research that we've been doing<br>we're committed to a lot of different<br>things including promoting Pacific and<br>Maori young researchers coming through<br>our latest appointment in the department<br>is a young Mighty woman who's returning<br>to New Zealand in a year or so to set up<br>her research<br>we've had the last two years we've had<br>young Pacifica researchers who are doing<br>projects as they go through med school<br>and hopefully we're sitting the scene<br>for developing some really talented<br>researchers to come through<br>the other thing I just wanted to briefly<br>touch on is uh the the youth Hub some of<br>you may be aware that this has been<br>built in Christchurch at the moment uh<br>just off on Salisbury Street and Dame<br>Sue Bagshaw who's a member of our<br>department is one of the key people in<br>setting all this up it's it it's an<br>absolutely fabulous looking facility<br>it's going to bring together youth in in<br>Canterbury and many of the different<br>agencies instead of reaching out to them<br>we'll be able to come to where the young<br>people are<br>it has a number of different<br>um<br>aspects to it there's going to be a<br>limited amount of short-term<br>accommodation for young people who are<br>just getting off the ground getting<br>their feet together I think<br>getting things sorted there's going to<br>be representatives from education from<br>lots of different agencies that support<br>the youth in the community<br>and we had a Hui last week involving Sue<br>and her team and our team looking at how<br>we can embed a research program for<br>development into the youth Hub and work<br>together with all the agencies that are<br>working with our youth<br>figure out what's going to be best from<br>so I'm going to pass it on to my<br>colleague soon but I just thought I<br>would chuck up a quote First for you<br>and have a quick read it sounds a bit<br>old and I was wondering if anyone could<br>tell me<br>give you a minute or so up the back<br>there<br>it is Socrates<br>so we want to be positive<br>and from an adult perspective I think we<br>could say we've been misunderstanding<br>teenagers for more than two and a half<br>thousand years<br>and it's about time we got it right so<br>I'm going to hand back to Laura Lee now<br>thanks so much Tony that's wonderful<br>associate professor Jenny Jordan's going<br>to speak now now Jenny's a busy clinical<br>psychologist and has been an<br>investigator and therapist in a series<br>of randomized clinical trials evaluating<br>different therapies for serious mental<br>disorders including Eating Disorders<br>depression and post-traumatic stress<br>disorder related to the Christchurch<br>Quakes she was part of the research team<br>that developed specialist supportive<br>clinical management for anorexia nervosa<br>now Jenny's current research focuses<br>very much she's a co-lead investigator<br>in the New Zealand arm of the Eating<br>Disorders genetics initiative edgy it's<br>called now it's the largest genetic<br>investigation of Eating Disorders ever<br>performed worldwide<br>this is a large and very major trial and<br>its results will be groundbreaking for<br>clinicians parents and teens struggling<br>with a very real and debilitating issues<br>so<br>um before we talk about eating disorders<br>we need to acknowledge the Spectrum from<br>normal eating to disordered eating<br>through to the more famous eating<br>disorders of anorexia nervosa bulimia<br>and binge eating disorder and I think<br>most people will know about the<br>characteristics of those so I'm going to<br>focus on the ones maybe you don't know<br>about which the first one is Big urexia<br>it's an interesting name and this is not<br>actually even an eating disorder it's a<br>body dysmorphic disorder and it affects<br>young men who perceive themselves as Way<br>Too Thin and that they need to bulk up<br>and so they're often doing bodybuilding<br>using protein supplements and they're<br>actually at risk later on of using um<br>innovate steroids and getting into all<br>sorts of unhelpful eating behaviors<br>um the other ones are Alfred wouldn't<br>restrict the food intake disorder this<br>is something that normally occurs in<br>infancy and some of you may have had<br>fussy eaters is toddlers<br>for many people that's uh condition they<br>grow out of but for some it's very<br>severe they can become very restrictive<br>when itching and they can have major<br>physical consequences but it can occur<br>at other ages too it can occur in um<br>throughout the lifespan and but it's not<br>driven by fear of weight of being too<br>fat it's driven by fear of sensory<br>characteristics of food or fear of<br>might be vomiting afterwards or actually<br>just not having an appetite and<br>orthorexia has been in the news lately<br>that's uh where people start focusing on<br>healthy eating take it to clean eating<br>and then they start dropping food groups<br>and it becomes very unhealthy indeed and<br>can be fatal<br>so who gets an eating disorder short<br>answer anyone can get an eating disorder<br>the stereotypants young female<br>and certainly the other people who turn<br>up for treatment but it's most important<br>to realize that males get it as well in<br>gender diverse and ethnic non-binary<br>sexual orientation young people have<br>much higher rates of eating disorders in<br>minorities ethnic minorities in New<br>Zealand Maori and Pacific island have at<br>least as high in perhaps even higher<br>rates of Eating Disorders but it's under<br>recognized<br>um so why should we worry about fed<br>diets<br>you can see a lot on the right here some<br>of you may recognize them may have even<br>indulged in them at times so they always<br>promise Quick Weight Loss don't they<br>um and but they're always extreme<br>restrictive unbalanced and unsustainable<br>they don't have a scientific basis<br>there's no scientific basis for the<br>grapefruit diet as far as I'm aware and<br>actually most importantly they can be<br>dangerous<br>the good news is most people can't stick<br>to diets in fact it's a very profitable<br>industry but um<br>the fair trading act should come into<br>account there really because greater<br>than 95 percent of people will not be<br>able to sustain diets and bad news is if<br>you do yo-yo dieting over your lifetime<br>you end up putting on weight<br>but most important in this context can<br>signal an emerging eating disorder<br>the other risk factors for eating<br>disorders and young people are these<br>kind of activities now they're great<br>activities but they have risks as well<br>so there are many activities in that<br>first group like dancing and gymnastics<br>and so on that have a really high focus<br>on appearance a certain look<br>the clothing is always quite<br>um figure revealing in this lots of<br>mirrors and things like that too so the<br>scrutiny that people come under is quite<br>high and sensitive body image and some<br>the ones at the bottom seem to have our<br>weight categories so people have to stay<br>with them a certain weight and often<br>people engage in really unhealthy weight<br>control behaviors to stay within their<br>team<br>this example is uh<br>a really good example of the kind of<br>imagery that young people are exposed to<br>it's a wash with imagery like this that<br>promotes a thin ideal that promotes they<br>call it finsbro and citro inspiration to<br>lose weight until it gets it<br>and young people gravitate to websites<br>listed at the bottom here the ones that<br>have been noted and research that have a<br>really high proportion of appearance<br>focused websites<br>Facebook's a lot more diverse but it has<br>some sites in their little bit toxic<br>and this is how it affects young people<br>so what we have at the top is really<br>high exposure to this appearance Focus<br>content<br>in people young people will look at that<br>and internalize that thin Western ideal<br>of what what beauty looks like or what<br>um what is attractive and then they<br>engage with those sites so the sites<br>encourage them to engage by posting<br>comments posting selfies and uh<br>what happens is as people do that they<br>start to<br>get consequences of their mental health<br>consequences so first of all they do<br>it's exacerbated by this um<br>really toxic cognitive process called<br>comparison so they do upward comparisons<br>so they look at images and think I'm not<br>as pretty I'm not as um rich I don't<br>have an interesting life like that<br>person I'm not good enough<br>and then they that leads them to develop<br>appearance contingent self-worth so they<br>have to look good or they don't feel<br>good<br>and there's really good evidence that<br>staring at those sites being gravitating<br>on those sites leads to negative<br>feelings every time they do it body<br>dissatisfaction and low self-esteem<br>and because they're feeling so bad they<br>follow the advice on those sites and try<br>to make themselves better by dieting and<br>engaging in things like excessive<br>exercise<br>and so that's how it circulates and then<br>it's made worth by the social media<br>algorithms which of course whatever you<br>look at gets feedback to you and so at<br>first<br>um so what can we do about it it's a<br>little bit depressing but actually the<br>good news is there's some really good<br>prevention programs coming on they don't<br>have very strong effects but they do<br>have effects for people who are at risk<br>so they are called media literacy<br>programs so they teach people how to<br>dissect the content that's on there and<br>with a more scrutiny<br>um so they do reality tips they'll show<br>them photos of this one here that's been<br>photoshopped you can see but there's<br>also use of filters<br>um and of course it's all curated like<br>most of us don't post our ugly photos<br>online we only put the best ones up<br>right<br>um and it's that's like<br>maximized on YouTube all of those sites<br>they teach dissonance they teach people<br>to challenge the idea of the thin idea<br>why should the all of the world look<br>like within Western<br>images and promote counter views on how<br>we should value ourselves that's not a<br>bad appearance<br>so it's about teaching resilient coping<br>and they also talk about<br>um educating people on how those sites<br>work like you know what's what's in it<br>for the influencers of course they want<br>the attention but they're usually<br>peddling some product at the same time<br>and the social media companies make<br>money out of this so that's quite<br>important<br>Adventure so what can you do as parents<br>um<br>one really important thing is promoting<br>body acceptance<br>so for ourselves for our kids for our<br>pets eat family meals together there's<br>lots of good reasons to do that that are<br>about communication and so on but also<br>keeping an eye on what they're eating or<br>not eating<br>just being interested in their lives<br>and I think having these really good<br>open conversations about the internet I<br>see China's trying to limit it to two<br>hours per night for a kid that don't<br>won't work here will it but actually<br>discussing what it's like what they go<br>to what they see and how to perhaps<br>limit use to leave time for getting<br>involved with real life not just your<br>internet friends<br>how to avoid toxic sites if it makes<br>them feel bad leave it alone<br>and having this intentional focus on<br>going to good sizes heaps of great stuff<br>on the internet that will make people<br>feel good that will build self-esteem so<br>in most of all encouraging a healthy<br>skepticism<br>and so in that light I've just found a<br>favorite site of the week<br>lifefaker.com so we could all go there<br>and do this instead of going through the<br>hassle of living your perfect life you<br>can just get the photos<br>thank you very much<br>foreign<br>thanks so much Jenny well um now time<br>for uh Philip pattamore so Phillips<br>recently retired as associate professor<br>of pediatrics at the University of otago<br>Christchurch here and also as a<br>pediatric respiratory and general<br>specialist at tiffata Ora Christchurch<br>hospital his research interests are in<br>childhood asthma epidemiology the<br>effects of tobacco smoking and vaping on<br>children and young people and the<br>clinical pathology of cystic fibrosis is<br>currently engaged in a high school<br>vaping study looking at the impact on<br>students of an educational video about<br>vaping examining student attitudes and<br>expressed intentions towards it and the<br>emerging results from that study are<br>very interesting and Phil will perhaps<br>be able to share a little bit of how<br>that's going so far he's been an<br>advocate and lobbyist for Tobacco<br>Control and smoke-free issues on behalf<br>of the Pediatric Society of New Zealand<br>and also doctors for healthy trade<br>Phillip<br>getting older so<br>oh<br>thanks so I'm going to talk about<br>e-cigarettes<br>a lot of smoke and hot air<br>um breathed about e-cigarettes and um<br>they were first patented in 1963 the<br>first person to invent them invented<br>them to try and help people give up<br>smoking and that's how they snuck under<br>the radar into New Zealand originally to<br>help people smoke smoking but of course<br>now with a commercial Market they're<br>marketed as a creation product in a<br>wildering variety of devices<br>colors<br>and e-liquids<br>and flavors<br>they're marketed<br>with or without nicotine and some of the<br>nicotine content in some e-cigarette<br>liquids is<br>and e-cigarettes have<br>really risen in an age where smoking<br>amongst year 10 students this is Ash<br>year 10 data since 1999 has fallen down<br>to very very low levels Headmasters were<br>saying there's very few students smoking<br>but vaping has become a problem and has<br>replaced it and you can see the figures<br>there<br>so this is regular smoking and regular<br>vaping<br>well<br>the coil in an e-cigarette is a metal<br>coil and as it heats the liquid<br>some heavy metal Chrome and other<br>chromium and other heavy metals are<br>leaked into the liquid and we know these<br>are in Trace Amounts but you would get<br>exposed to heavy metals repeatedly again<br>and again and again for long periods of<br>time we know they ate and they have<br>harmful effects on cells some<br>carcinogenic potential<br>there are agents including the base<br>liquid can cause inflammation in the<br>Airways and that can make<br>children cough there's a large study in<br>Korea showing that it was vaping was<br>associated with a significant increase<br>in coughing and also in worsening asthma<br>so Airway effects from inflammatory<br>agents and there's a lot of a lot of<br>those flavorings got into e-cigarettes<br>because they were approved by the FDA as<br>flavors for food<br>now that may seem logical to it doesn't<br>quite to me as a respiratory physician<br>if you think of a peanut in your stomach<br>and a peanut in your Airways it's two<br>very different things your Airways are<br>not designed to have foreign substances<br>breathed into them and they react quite<br>violently to oils and a number of the<br>they are probably less harmful than<br>tobacco how much less harmful is Way Up<br>For Debate<br>Public Health England estimated based<br>basically on a show of hands among<br>so-called experts was five percent<br>as a New Zealand study estimated 30<br>percent is harmful of cigarettes and<br>somewhere in there we don't know the<br>long term<br>um<br>toxicity of this but they are certainly<br>not harmless so if a smoker is seeking<br>to switch to vaping they're seeking to<br>reduce the harms and that's the whole<br>base of the so-called harm reduction<br>approach to quitting smoking and those<br>people who deal with adult smokers swear<br>by e-cigarettes instead of getting<br>people off<br>smoking<br>but if you're a non-smoker taking up<br>vaping you are adding to your risks and<br>you're gaining new risks that you didn't<br>so there is one risk that we know quite<br>a bit about<br>because it was in cigarettes and that is<br>nicotine itself<br>now nicotine is in E-Cigarettes it's<br>also in so-called heat not burn devices<br>and<br>e-cigarettes and nicotine is a very very<br>addictive substance it's one of the most<br>and it leads to addictive behavior if<br>you miss if you are addicted to it and<br>you miss your smokes and that's what<br>Headmasters up in the country they<br>complain about people meeting the<br>classroom because they have to get their<br>next day because they're so heavily<br>addicted and the car keeps still and<br>they're disrupting the class<br>and if you're addicted to nicotine<br>and you're using nicotine product again<br>and again and again over months and<br>years you're going to get repeated<br>exposure to whatever else goes on in the<br>alongside the nicotine which is those<br>heavy metals those inflammatory things<br>and so repeated and cumulative exposure<br>goes along with addiction<br>privilege to other addictions so<br>nicotine turns on<br>something in the brain the reward center<br>which seems in many studies to promote<br>Promenade other elections Clinic Alcohol<br>and it affects mood and concentration<br>and judgment<br>particularly in the developing brain we<br>understand<br>there's another factor and that is<br>behind<br>nicotine is Big tobacco now most of the<br>nicotine and e-cigarette comes from the<br>tobacco industry there are a few uh<br>initial companies that started with<br>synthetic nicotine most have come from<br>tobacco farming<br>and the tobacco industry has got wholly<br>on board with the e-cigarette phenomena<br>they've supported it they've even<br>supported the idea of harm reduction<br>tobacco smoke-free world there's an<br>organization in Europe by Philip Morris<br>make marble cigarettes for a smoke-free<br>world but they're still making<br>cigarettes in fact they're increasing<br>their production of cigarettes and they<br>love e-cigarettes why because nicotine<br>is keeping people addicted to nicotine<br>and that just saves us all their<br>products and they have been deceptive<br>and irresponsible socially irresponsible<br>they work for a profit motive not a<br>health motive I have this huge social<br>and economic cost of tobacco farming<br>which you never hear about but the World<br>Health Organization the United Nations<br>have been talking about these for years<br>so what is being done well there is<br>legislation<br>um on the books for regulations on on<br>sale and marketing B cigarettes so new<br>vape shops will be unable to open up<br>near schools that doesn't stop the<br>existing vape shops near schools generic<br>flavor descriptions<br>maximum nicotine strength to try and<br>discourage the use of single use and<br>disposable Vapes and a requirement for<br>removable batteries and child safety<br>mechanisms<br>but the government many of us feel could<br>be doing a lot more restricting vaping<br>sales to specialist vape shops or<br>Pharmacies with compulsory training and<br>vaping and quitting<br>and indisposable Vapes altogether<br>removing all but a few basic flavors<br>these things seem obvious to some of us<br>and compulsory education in schools<br>about vaping<br>what can parents or concerned young<br>people do the first thing is to listen<br>and keep communication all open<br>so<br>you listen to each other listen parents<br>listening to teenagers and teenagers to<br>the parents there's no point in starting<br>World War III over this<br>many young people have Vape are aware of<br>The Unwanted effects and many of them<br>admit that they're addicted they don't<br>want people hammering this again over<br>their heads they were told this was a<br>safe product when they tried that they<br>were curious so be kind<br>oh<br>and be open about the potential risks<br>but use felt Hammers If you're going to<br>don't overstate the risk there are worse<br>things believe it or not a teenager can<br>do they could start World War Three<br>and quitting vaping is essentially about<br>quitting nicotine addiction so far we<br>don't have any specialist Vape quitting<br>services but quitting is just like<br>quitting smoking talk to your GP and<br>your practice nurse smoking cessation<br>Services Quitline and nicotine<br>replacement therapy they need lots of<br>follow-up encouragement and don't give<br>up on them don't give up on yourself<br>keep those lines of communication open<br>and be kind<br>so e-cigarettes seem to be on the<br>direction to both smoking and smoke-free<br>and it's made for a lot of confusion<br>thank you<br>thanks Philip I wonder if you turned<br>that on for is it still going<br>got a quick question your study you're<br>doing in the schools the Phillips got a<br>PhD student he's supervising doing a<br>study in schools on vaping what some of<br>the early results that young ones are<br>telling you<br>we're hearing a lot about young people<br>who who want to stop vaping we're<br>hearing a lot about people who who feel<br>addicted and that they can't control it<br>they they know it and they want to<br>actually come off<br>have had a little pilot study that told<br>us most teenagers were not getting Vaped<br>from vape shops they were actually<br>getting them from friends and family<br>which<br>means that regulations about vape shops<br>on their own<br>are not necessarily going to stop young<br>people getting hold of Vapes but<br>actually a lot of young people are<br>crying out for help and they're not<br>getting it from the government<br>interestingly enough government does not<br>seem so far as far as I can see to be<br>listening to the young people's cries<br>for help on this matter<br>and I think too you know Australia not<br>so long ago have changed the legislation<br>haven't they to uh you've got to go to a<br>GP if you're<br>um<br>to get a vaping prescription for if<br>you've got to be older as well and none<br>for under 18s it's something that<br>perhaps uh interesting was an election<br>coming up none of our parties have so<br>yeah okay well we're going to step now<br>to sleep in those sorts of issues and<br>hear from Professor Richard Porter<br>Bridges ahead of the campuses Department<br>of psychological medicine at Miami sorry<br>that's it here I am back again Richard<br>Porter Richard's the head of the<br>campuses Department of psychological<br>medicine as well as being the director<br>of the mental health Clinical Research<br>Unit he's more than 200 published papers<br>to his name his main research interests<br>are in the treatment of mood disorders<br>trials looking at proposed treatments<br>for the likes of depression anxiety<br>bipolar as well as ECT therapy in its<br>use he's conducted multiple studies into<br>the neurobiology of mood disorders and<br>cognitive impairment excuse me and is<br>now conducting studies on cognitive<br>remediation and mood disorders he's a<br>consultant psychiatrist specializing in<br>the care of adults with intellectual<br>disability and he also sees patients<br>with treatment resistant mood disorders<br>thank you Laura Lee and thank you<br>everybody for coming out this evening<br>could I start with a quick poll how many<br>of you have teenagers in your homes at<br>the moment<br>many how many of you have had the<br>experience of getting up at three<br>o'clock in the morning to go to the Loo<br>and you see a little of light or<br>glow coming under the door<br>quite a lot how many of you don't let<br>your teenagers have their phones in<br>their rooms at<br>night and of course you all realize<br>that's the biology of the body is set on<br>a 24-hour Rhythm because that's how how<br>the world works and it's really<br>important and it's not just sleep that<br>works on a 24-hour Rhythm you see<br>multiple things<br>work on that sort of Rhythm at the<br>moment you have your highest blood<br>pressure in the day<br>Jenny and Phil have tried to soothe you<br>a little bit but it is the fact that<br>your blood pressure is likely to be<br>highest if you want to beat your<br>teenager at table tennis wait till they<br>have woken up at 1pm and play them at 2<br>30 in your your coordination reflexes<br>are best<br>um melatonin is the hormone that's most<br>important in this system and it begins<br>to be secreted around about nine or ten<br>o'clock at night and Rises during the<br>night and then settles in the morning<br>and what what sets this circadian rhythm<br>well it's light pretty much that is the<br>most important thing and we see so I'm<br>being blinded Now by this screen in<br>front of me that's white light and it's<br>a combination of all the colors of light<br>in the visible spectrum<br>but the light that is most important is<br>blue light that is what entrains the<br>body's circadian rhythm<br>and there's only one other thing that<br>you can alter to do with circadian<br>rhythm and that is having a regular<br>social routine and so what you do at<br>regular times each day<br>actually also helps to entrain your<br>rhythms of breakfast at seven lunch at<br>12 whatever you do on a regular basis<br>and if you don't do activities on any<br>sort of regular basis that's losing the<br>opportunity to entrain your circadian<br>rhythm<br>and it works very simply blue light<br>comes into the eye hits the retina goes<br>through a couple of parts of the brain<br>to signal and blue light very<br>effectively suppresses the secretion of<br>melatonin<br>so if you're exposed to Blue Light in<br>the evening and at night your<br>melatonin's Switched Off<br>but when you're exposed to light in the<br>morning you go out you go out and Silent<br>sunlight immediately that's suppressing<br>the Melatonin so that it's accentuating<br>your circadian rhythm no melatonin<br>during the day a good secretion during<br>the night<br>and that works well in most<br>circumstances but<br>it the world isn't perfect and here<br>we've got trimsa in Northern Norway<br>midday in the middle of winter and it's<br>dark<br>and we've got a satellite shot of the<br>U.S in the middle of the night and you<br>can see the main cities on the East<br>Coast here you can see Los Angeles you<br>can see Donald Trump's legal office here<br>um so you know that it's not ideal you<br>get countries where there is a very<br>little sunlight in the winter and a<br>whole lot in the summer and we have this<br>issue with artificial light and of<br>course the problem that you all know<br>about the problem of excessive screen<br>time this is Buddy<br>editing my slides for me<br>and so a screen like this is emitting<br>large amounts of blue light at exactly<br>the wrong time of the day if your teens<br>are using their screens in the evening<br>their cell phones their their computers<br>television screens are emitting large<br>amounts of blue light potentially<br>turning off melatonin secretion<br>and is that a problem well I don't want<br>to overstate this you know you've all<br>got teams who are going to bed at two<br>o'clock and then waking up at one<br>o'clock the next day and most of them<br>will be all right but phase delay and<br>sleep loss are on average associated<br>with problems with mental health and by<br>phase delay I mean going to bed very<br>late and then waking up very late so<br>your phase is not<br>entrained to the normal daylight hours<br>and of course if you're going to bed<br>very late and you're sleeping very late<br>you can't get to sleep and you're living<br>in a the society we live in you've got<br>to get up the next morning to go to<br>school and essentially what you've got<br>is equivalent to jet lag your your body<br>is not set on the rhythm of what you<br>actually have to do in the country<br>you're living in<br>and that is associated both of those<br>situations again I don't want to worry<br>you but it is associated with conditions<br>like depression like low mood and we see<br>this cycle this vicious cycle of having<br>some sort of sleep problem or phase<br>delay and it may be to do with stress it<br>may be to do with screen use<br>and then mood lowering and of course<br>someone with low mood doesn't cope as<br>well so perhaps at school they withdraw<br>a bit they don't engage so much with<br>their friends or they're a bit irritable<br>and that then can lead to interpersonal<br>stresses but difficulties in their peer<br>relationships which are difficult anyway<br>for teenagers and stressful<br>and that then leads to further sleep<br>loss because they lie awake worrying<br>about it or being even more active on<br>social media in the night because they<br>can't bear the thought that everyone<br>else is communicating and they're not<br>and so that can lead to this vicious<br>cycle<br>so to get a little bit more positive<br>what can we do about it what can we<br>reasonably do it about it I Echo Phil's<br>point that you you can't just go in and<br>just you know tell your team what to do<br>I've tried it and it never worked for me<br>so some real Common Sense things so try<br>to have something like a regular wait<br>time now in school time it's it's going<br>to be set but maybe try and have it on a<br>Saturday as well so that it keeps going<br>for at least six sevenths of the week<br>and in the holidays well maybe 10<br>o'clock on most days within half an hour<br>rather than two or four<br>and try to keep that as regular as you<br>can<br>some sort of routine that involves<br>Morning Light you know the best thing is<br>Morning Light so from Saturday morning<br>sport is a great way to keep that going<br>at the weekends walking to school of<br>course but even if in the holidays you<br>just sit some tape a table up on the<br>patio and the breakfasts out there<br>that's better than nothing<br>have an anchor point in the day so set<br>the social rhythms at least once in the<br>day there's some sort of family activity<br>maybe it's tea time maybe your work<br>shifts and it's really difficult but<br>think of something that you can do with<br>your kid at a set time you when kids at<br>a set time each day<br>have that discussion about screen use<br>in the evening in particular and try to<br>come up with a time where the last<br>screen use is you know my daughter all<br>she always had she was doing an<br>assignment she was late it had to be in<br>by midnight she couldn't do it off the<br>computer because it was all on the<br>computer so it was always a reason why<br>it had to go on Beyond nine o'clock but<br>you know do your do your best<br>and a very simple thing you can do is<br>put blue blocking filters on screens<br>I'm not going to tell you how because<br>you just ask your teenager they they all<br>know how to do this Google it it's the<br>first thing that comes up very easy<br>thing to do blue blocking on screen so<br>um very simple tip<br>if we take this in mental health we take<br>this really quite seriously because in<br>more severe mood disorders it is an<br>important factor and this is cindola's<br>psychiatric hospital in Trondheim in<br>Northern Norway and they've built One<br>Wing of the hospital actually becomes<br>blue blocked between 6 and 6 30 each<br>night and then it it's that reverses in<br>the morning and this is what it looks<br>like so the blinds have come down Blue<br>Block the lights are blue blocked any<br>electricians in the audience<br>thing you could wire your kids rooms up<br>to do this but there is a there is a<br>simpler way of doing this<br>and that is to wear these<br>so this is this is blue blocking glasses<br>so now<br>I can see you but there is no blue light<br>entering my retina but I can still see<br>and I can still interact<br>um perhaps not the trendiest thing and<br>your your kids may not want to wear this<br>on a first date<br>at rollerkin which is where they all go<br>I'm told for first States these days<br>um but you know the concept of of orange<br>tinted glasses is not new and so there<br>are some Role Models here there's Lord<br>do you know who this is<br>you need to get with your kids a little<br>bit it's loyal karner who's a rapper and<br>but do reassure your kids that it's if<br>they wear orange glasses their hair and<br>eyebrows don't necessarily turn the same<br>color<br>oh<br>so I'm sure you were worried about buddy<br>but don't worry we've come up with a<br>solution for that and thank you for<br>listening<br>thank you<br>thank you very much did you never know<br>they might take on uh take off uh these<br>teens they might like those you never<br>know maybe in their Christmas packages<br>um now we're going to have a listen to<br>Dr Jenny Manuel Jenny's a senior<br>lecturer in the in the department of<br>Maori indigenous Health Innovation or<br>mihi here and also the department of<br>psychological medicine so she has<br>post-grad teaching responsibilities in<br>both departments the subject areas<br>including Hawa Maori the nature and<br>extent of mental disorders and mental<br>health nurses she has an active<br>supervisory role with Masters and PhD<br>students here on campus as well now her<br>research interests include Maori mental<br>health and Equity improving Service<br>delivery for people experiencing severe<br>mental illness and early psychosis she's<br>a principal investigator on a study<br>evaluating a peer-led acute service for<br>severe mental illness and she also takes<br>a lead role in a major hrc-funded Grant<br>a project investigating Pathways to<br>First psychosis and outcomes for Maori<br>rangatahi now Jenny is also a trained<br>therapist and involved in clinical<br>trials for mood disorders<br>so my job tonight to talk about their<br>old parenting in building mental<br>well-being and use and Adolescence when<br>I said to my daughters a few nights ago<br>that I was going to do a talk on parents<br>and my artist who's my best work she<br>said oh you're gonna be really good at<br>that Mum and I said I think so and then<br>my middle child said to me I think you<br>need to keep practicing parenting before<br>so yeah I think it makes me perfectly<br>qualified to talk tonight about<br>parenting<br>so we know that adolescents and teens<br>that feel attached and connected to<br>experience with all their whanau have a<br>better ability to regulate their<br>emotions and have us healthier<br>development<br>um and but attachment parenting really<br>needs to be tailored to their age and<br>their developmental needs so I just want<br>to briefly mention two things in regards<br>to that so first of all adolescents and<br>teens are going through this huge shift<br>in terms of their their identity<br>development<br>and and what we more commonly probably<br>call an adult um in terms is the sense<br>of cell so sense of self is how we feel<br>about ourselves it's how we perceive<br>ourselves in relation to others in the<br>world it's how we think others perceive<br>us it's also about uh self-image and our<br>ideal self so who do we want to be in<br>the future<br>um and there's also some major stuff<br>going on in terms of their brain<br>development and I don't have time to<br>talk about that tonight but I think in<br>really simple terms what it means is<br>there are emotional thinkers and because<br>they're emotional thinkers that means<br>that they still need their input and<br>guidance from us even though they they<br>they're acting like<br>and so touch on those things a little<br>bit as I go through<br>attachment piriting or attachments<br>theory has got a really strong evidence<br>base but it's largely been developed in<br>Western Sciences so I think it's just<br>worth me noting that when you hear hear<br>this evidence you need to adapt it to<br>your own values your own beliefs your<br>own culture and also your natural<br>parenting instincts and bringing<br>yourself as a natural parent to that<br>relationship<br>Okay so<br>the aim is to create a sense of safety<br>for The Adolescents or team that's the<br>role of the parent not to be a therapist<br>or a health professional but to to to<br>create a sense of safety and there's two<br>essential ingredients that adolescents<br>and teens need to get that sense of<br>safety the first is being emotionally<br>responsive towards them and then the<br>other is to have boundaries and we need<br>to I want you to imagine these are like<br>scales so that we need to balance these<br>two things now if we're getting that<br>right then the outcome should be they<br>feel connected to us<br>and we know they've been being connected<br>to us means they're better able to<br>regulate their emotions if we're doing<br>it in an age-appropriate way then we're<br>fostering a sense of autonomy which is<br>really important part of that brain<br>development they're going through so<br>giving them the opportunity to make<br>decisions and make mistakes<br>so I'll come back to this and and<br>practice practical terms about what this<br>might look like but first of all I just<br>want to talk about what happens when we<br>tip the balance one way or the other<br>um so in this what's commonly called as<br>the jellyfish parenting style is when we<br>go really heavy on the emotional<br>responsiveness side to the point that<br>replicates their emotions or that we<br>start to problem solve for them and then<br>we might go light on boundaries or<br>hands-off boundaries<br>now this is a dynamic that I used to see<br>a little bit in and teen adolescence<br>mental health so he's a teenager that's<br>really suffering from some nasty<br>depression or anxiety or having a really<br>difficult time now the context of that<br>is really multifaceted there's lots of<br>different reasons why that might be<br>occurring but what often happened would<br>be that the parents would respond in a<br>way that they would be distressed for<br>their team and what they would do is<br>they have a tend to multiplicate their<br>emotions or to problem solve for them<br>but then the Adolescent or the therefore<br>doesn't really get the opportunity to<br>learn how to regulate their own emotions<br>there's no sort of responsibility for<br>them to do anything different so it kind<br>of this regulation tends to remain<br>the parent might respond with again<br>doing more problem solving but after a<br>while when there's no shift in the<br>dynamic is fatigue and it can actually<br>even lead to sort of purine to all child<br>resentment and anger and what you get is<br>more often is polarization which is the<br>opposite to what we want which is<br>connection so so<br>um<br>this this type of parenting even when<br>our Mentor even when our teens aren't<br>feeling well as an isn't quite the way<br>to address that<br>so what happens when we flick the switch<br>the other way so this is when we lack<br>the emotional responsiveness and want<br>and then we go heavy on was it emphasis<br>on rules and control and consequences<br>some of the negative side effects of<br>this type of parenting<br>um<br>that can lead to adolescents and teens<br>um doing what we call internalizing<br>emotions more which means suppressing<br>their emotions they're not learning what<br>the emotions are or processing them<br>they're just trying to hide them down<br>and that can actually cause issues<br>especially later on in life in terms of<br>relationships but not knowing how to<br>express emotion properly<br>it can also cause<br>um often with a style of parenting can<br>come sometimes like an implicit or<br>explicit<br>um degree of criticism about you can't<br>make these decisions on your own or<br>you're getting this wrong and you're<br>that's sort of more of a punishing style<br>of responding and actually when we think<br>about them having this developing sense<br>of identity about who they are they can<br>take on some of that negative messaging<br>in terms of their density that they're<br>developing<br>and I guess the third major side effect<br>of this<br>um parenting would be that we their<br>brains are developing in a way that they<br>are learning to to problem solve and<br>when it does come time for them to need<br>to make decisions<br>neglect the confidence because they<br>haven't really had the exposure of being<br>so what we're really aiming for is<br>what's commonly called as authoritative<br>backbone parenting and so combining the<br>toes so they balance each other and<br>that's what creates the sense of<br>security<br>um so so an emotional responsiveness of<br>helping them desculate the emotions<br>validating their emotions is really<br>useful tool and also just showing<br>interest and showing interest and having<br>spending time with them so they feel<br>connected to you<br>um<br>but when we are delivering boundaries<br>for adolescents and teens we need to<br>also do it with negotiable so they have<br>that sense of developing autonomy so<br>let's say for example your teen you've<br>caught them they've they've you found<br>out they're vaping<br>um and how so how might this apply<br>um you see how am I going to be<br>emotionally responsive to my team when<br>they've done this thing that's you know<br>not quite right try and take it from the<br>perspective try and think about what it<br>was like for them and what might have<br>been the context to watch The Vaping<br>occurred I mean I would probably say in<br>something naturally like I remember when<br>I was a teen how hard it would be to say<br>no to my mates so starting the<br>conversation in an emotionally<br>responsive way helps de-escalate their<br>emotions and also means that they're<br>probably better prepared to hear the<br>information that might help them make<br>better decisions<br>the boundaries is a wee bit tricky in<br>this sense because you can't lock down<br>the lungs you can't lock them down or<br>you might give it a go<br>um but but you can't really do that and<br>so the boundary is more about<br>um talking about how it's not a safe<br>thing to do and asking them you know how<br>might you manage this differently if you<br>were with your friends again how might<br>you be able to be in a bit of a position<br>so<br>but I the thing about this is this is<br>kind of the general dress this is what<br>we want to do but the reality is is<br>everybody to do parent in this way is<br>dependent on a number of things their<br>capacity to do this is depending on a<br>number of things for example the type of<br>attachment parenting we got I know in<br>the 80s when I was being parented I<br>don't think emotional responsiveness was<br>really part of my parents dialogue<br>they did a great job you know but um<br>yeah I don't think it was part of their<br>dialogue so it's not something that<br>comes naturally to me and I think the<br>other thing is what about all the<br>stresses that are going on in our lives<br>you know if I'm incredibly stressed at<br>work or I've got heaps going on I have a<br>tendency to go home and go down hard on<br>the boundaries and go more authoritarian<br>with the kids<br>um<br>um I guess it's a therapist occasionally<br>I had that I have the old thought that<br>one day one of my kids might even be<br>gated by they can have their Corridor<br>with your theory first it's actually<br>it's it's actually there's some good<br>news is that what we're aiming for has<br>been a good enough parent doing this<br>stuff some of the time because when we<br>actually stuff it up we're actually<br>providing them opportunity to learn<br>about actually what the natural<br>conditions are of Human Relationships<br>and that is the messiness of human<br>behavior that we bring to the table and<br>so we're not aiming to do this perfectly<br>every time we're just trying to do our<br>best<br>um and and actually what there's that's<br>why there's a bit of a catchphrase that<br>comes with this is that that is why<br>imperfect parenting is actually perfect<br>for parenting<br>short everybody<br>wonderful thank you very much Jenny okay<br>we've got a little bit of time left for<br>a q a session now<br>um now I'm sure some of you have got<br>some questions for uh our panel anyone<br>want to go<br>um my daughter went and bought a pair of<br>glasses and they said they see the blue<br>blue light blocking would that be real<br>or like do they have to be orange to<br>work<br>I mean that there's no um<br>standard you know that said that people<br>have to be tested the glasses have to be<br>tested by<br>if you so the ones I've got are<br>particularly unfashionable looking but<br>they are genuinely blue blocking and<br>they do have to have some wrap around<br>function otherwise light gets inside and<br>they just look like um they were quite<br>trendy looking but they said blue light<br>blocking glasses and they were clear in<br>color and I just laughed yeah that's a<br>joke but she bought them anyway and she<br>wears them sometimes and I'm thinking is<br>that bad for her eyes do they are they<br>not real like I think many glasses<br>probably block some of the blue light<br>but to get a really good effect it<br>should be ones that genuinely block out<br>the entire blue light spectrum<br>and then I perhaps should have said<br>wearing them from six or seven at night<br>Cura I had a question with regard to<br>vaping if it's been around I think you<br>said since 1963 in New Zealand or in<br>general is there any data from that or<br>is it entirely different product now<br>the the data<br>on long-term use I mean although that<br>was invented way back there it didn't<br>come into widespread use<br>anywhere in the world until<br>I think the um<br>just before 2010<br>so and even even then we've got very<br>limited data until about 2015 we saw<br>where the First Data we had in New<br>Zealand because people didn't even know<br>to ask about it in 2015<br>and so there there is no long-term data<br>we've had smoking since Walter rally<br>Rick was Walter rally<br>studies and doctors in the 1950s so what<br>is that that's uh 70 years<br>to study the effects of smoking we've<br>had probably five to seven years to<br>study the long-term effects of vaping<br>and even then it's been a it's been an<br>uptake during that time so so we just<br>don't have we don't have data even<br>what we have I should say is animal<br>experimental data<br>and tissue data so tissue exposure so<br>that's the the level of experimental<br>data at the moment and some<br>surveys like have been done career which<br>have asked students to report on<br>symptoms and seem to have found<br>relationships but studies on tissues do<br>shows in many cases similar inflammatory<br>effects to exposure to smoke tobacco<br>smoke and studies and animals have shown<br>similar but not quite as great effects<br>as tobacco smoke but on the same kind of<br>I have another sleep question what's<br>your thoughts about teenagers napping<br>during the day and the impact that might<br>thanks for that question<br>I mean it's<br>is fairly clear that if if you sleep for<br>more than 20 minutes or so in the<br>daytime that is likely to have an effect<br>of on sleep at night<br>there's also a lot of very good data for<br>the beneficial effects of<br>short Maps during the day and my boss in<br>Newcastle was used to say 17 and a half<br>minutes that's the maximum you should<br>I think it's difficult to be that exact<br>but you're not not longer than half an<br>hour<br>now this is another question on vaping<br>um just in regards to the research<br>you've been doing with the school<br>children<br>I was just wondering how prevalent is uh<br>vaping on social media because you don't<br>see advertising you I haven't seen<br>movies yet like you know used to see<br>people smoking movies I haven't seen<br>that so is that really prevalent to have<br>you done in research because I myself<br>haven't seen but then again my interest<br>is probably different from the interest<br>of my child so I was just wondering if<br>it pops up a lot and that's how they<br>target<br>the younger kids yeah it is prevalent on<br>social media but it probably targets<br>certain profiles I suspect I don't use<br>social media myself so I don't I don't<br>know to be honest but um but I know<br>there are a lot of research studies<br>about the social media advertising of<br>vaping and it is heavily advertised on<br>I've just got a sleep question<br>um I was wondering what your view on the<br>Melatonin taking melatonin supplements<br>as either for adults or teenagers<br>I mean the first thing to note is that<br>it's not subsidized in New Zealand as a<br>prescription medication except for<br>children under the age of 18 with<br>autistic spectrum disorder<br>um<br>and I can see why that is because<br>many people might find melatonin to be<br>helpful in various circumstances and I<br>certainly find it incredibly helpful in<br>jet jet<br>um<br>and I think there are a lot of people<br>who might find that taking exogenous<br>melatonin actually does improve their<br>circadian rhythm and their sleep<br>um you can of course buy it on the<br>internet<br>um but the the amount of melatonin may<br>not<br>correspond to the amount of melatonin in<br>the pharmaceutical materials<br>potentially<br>in New Zealand so I personally find it<br>very useful<br>but it's<br>problematic to prescribe it because it's<br>so it's expensive and the products you<br>can buy we don't know for sure how much<br>uh guys we're going to have to wrap it<br>up there but look the um the experts of<br>professors associate professor doctors<br>they will
