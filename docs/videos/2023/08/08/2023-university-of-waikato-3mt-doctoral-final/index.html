in<br>we acknowledge our occasion that we've<br>been gathered here tonight to hear from<br>some wonderful participants and those<br>completing their PHD studies and also<br>what they'll share we acknowledge our<br>kaifakawa our judges and also my<br>relation<br>who carved the Tonga that's given away<br>um well at last after rehearsed Souls<br>after the Heats and the hype we are here<br>at the 3mt finals so hooray call Linda<br>Johnson<br>I'm your MC for the evening and when I'm<br>not emceeing I'm a professor of<br>geography and assistant Vice Chancellor<br>sustainability here at tafariwananga or<br>waikato so a huge thanks to all of you<br>who have come to support our finalists<br>here tonight your support means a huge<br>amount to the finalists and to all of us<br>here as a community<br>I'm really have a keen interest in this<br>competition because like you all I love<br>to hear about what is happening with<br>these inspiring PhD candidates<br>and also like you I'm an aura of the<br>power of presentation so these three<br>empty finalists they showcase our PhD<br>stars in their ability to communicate<br>ideas engage and prompt the audience you<br>to consider new ways of researching in<br>their fields<br>so I was recently reminded how the power<br>of presentation can communicate ideas<br>and grab the attention of many people<br>when I was at the movie Barbie<br>so how many people here have been to<br>Barbie a few hand years hands up nodding<br>it is sweeping the world<br>um so part spoof part fantasy part<br>Barbie doll<br>virtual Museum I have to admit I was<br>skeptical about going to see it<br>um I never had a Barbie<br>as a child I was given a doll but didn't<br>want to play with it<br>but at the moment to the movies I went<br>and it was as much ironic as iconic my<br>favorite characters were the outcasts<br>weird Barbie and Alan<br>um who of course saved Barbies from<br>patriarchy<br>let's see that if that continues at the<br>end Barbie spoiler alert for those who<br>haven't seen it Ops for gender affirming<br>surgery so this seems like a movie for<br>everyone I was really delighted so the<br>power of the movie then is that it<br>operates as a vehicle for discussion of<br>many gender and power themes and tonight<br>we may not have anyone speaking about<br>Barbie<br>but the power of our 3mt presentations<br>are that they too operate as vehicles<br>for the discussion of groundbreaking<br>research<br>and new ideas<br>so before we get to their presentations<br>I'd like to First welcome our professor<br>Karen Karen Bryan the dean of school of<br>now<br>tenakoto tenakoto tanakoto katoa welcome<br>to the thesis in three and we're in the<br>playhouse again fabulous last time we<br>were small people wouldn't want to come<br>out and we were in the smaller room and<br>this is way better don't know if our<br>contestants will think it's better but a<br>proper stage is fabulous<br>so I am the Dana of tamata karenge the<br>scholar graduate research and if you<br>don't already know who you who we are we<br>look after the 660 odd doctoral students<br>at the University<br>well of course with their supervisors<br>and their families who really do the<br>Lion's Share of the work<br>so Linda introduced by a movie and I too<br>like movies<br>and last weekend I went to see the movie<br>Oppenheimer which I really enjoyed and I<br>enjoyed because I felt it was an Ode to<br>Being an academic it really tried to<br>bring those visions that inspired those<br>researchers who were at The Cutting Edge<br>of physics<br>and I guess what<br>um I found most interesting was upenheim<br>heimer's best skills were not his<br>academic prowess<br>and if you read his biography you'll<br>actually find he was quite<br>mathematically sloppy and well and he<br>actually couldn't stick to one idea very<br>well<br>but what he was really good at was<br>communicating and inspiring others to<br>succeed and that's of course what he<br>became known for leading the Manhattan<br>Project<br>but there's one great scene in the movie<br>where he starts teaching relativity in a<br>new class at Berkeley and at that stage<br>no one knew about relativity so it was a<br>bit odd and he only had one student<br>enrolled in this class and then cut a<br>little bit later in the movie and his<br>his room is packed out because he<br>managed to make people believe<br>relativity was important he really could<br>communicate<br>anyways back to us so part of the work<br>we do in the school involves delivering<br>a doctoral program which helps students<br>to develop their school skills not only<br>succeeding in their doctoral<br>qualifications but also skills that will<br>help them to go on and work in for an<br>example research government the<br>corporate environment not-for-profit<br>organizations or actually any role that<br>they choose<br>and of all the skills that they need to<br>develop communication skills are the<br>most important if we can't communicate<br>and explain people the significance of<br>what we do and why we do it and the<br>value and the outcome of our research<br>then our research will never see the<br>light of day<br>so the three-minute competition is about<br>the art of communicating research to an<br>interested but not necessarily<br>specialized audience<br>it's also for us about celebrating the<br>exciting research that we're doing with<br>our PhD students and the PhD students<br>are doing at the University of waikato<br>it is our pleasure to present this<br>research to you tonight<br>the 3mt is not just a waikato event it's<br>a global competition it originated at<br>the University of Queensland in<br>Australia and 2008. I don't know if<br>anyone remembers 2008 but that was a<br>year of incredible droughts in Australia<br>I actually went to visit Brisbane at<br>that time and all through Brisbane they<br>hadn't planted any of the gardens there<br>because it was a drought<br>and to conserve water the residents were<br>encouraged to time their showers and<br>many people had this three-minute egg<br>timer fixed to the wool of their<br>bathroom<br>the the then dean of the University of<br>Queensland graduate school noticed this<br>and thought well<br>on what can be achieved in three minutes<br>and the idea of the three Mt competition<br>was born<br>the year after it was promoted around<br>Australian and New Zealand universities<br>and that's when waikato first became<br>involved and since then they have sent<br>we have sent winners to of our<br>individual competitions at each<br>University in the trans-tasmin 3mt<br>the competition is now held at over 600<br>countries and institutions across 59<br>countries worldwide<br>and in 2016 we brought in a select<br>number of Asian universities and it's<br>now called the Asia Pacific 3mt<br>competition<br>the rules are the same all over the<br>world we don't like them<br>because it's hard the candidates have<br>three minutes to Captivate the audience<br>and give them a general understanding of<br>what research is about they're allowed<br>one slide and it has to be static and it<br>should be pitched to a non-specialist<br>but intelligent audience that's you guys<br>each presentation will be judged by a<br>panel of academic and non-academic<br>people looking at the areas the three<br>areas of judging comprehension<br>engagement and Communications<br>so now I'll hand you back to our MCA<br>Professor Linda Johnson who will<br>introduce you to your judges and explain<br>the details in a little more detail but<br>before I do I want to thank you all very<br>much for coming we are delighted to host<br>you back in the playhouse and we are<br>really uh really want to hear from our<br>10 students that are waiting nervously<br>back backstage who are studying for the<br>highest academic qualification it's<br>possible to obtain<br>I'd also like to thank our advisors at<br>the school of graduate research and the<br>events team they've put a lot of work<br>into planning this managing all the<br>communication training and competition<br>Heats that we've got thank you to our<br>very honorable judges<br>very appreciative that you've taken the<br>time and thank you once again and I hope<br>you enjoy the evening<br>fabulous so I it's really my pleasure to<br>introduce the judges to you they are on<br>a table in the middle of the room there<br>we have parikhafia McLean and Pari Cafe<br>is chief executive of criminal cases<br>review commission she's held executive<br>roles at counties Monaco dhb<br>and chief executive of waikato tainui<br>has been an advisor for three prime<br>ministers<br>also Pari kafia has a master's degree<br>from social science here at the<br>University of Waco she's also a<br>distinguished alumni of our University<br>so thank you so much for being here<br>our other judge Dr Mike scarsbrook Mike<br>is a science manager at Regional<br>Regional Council we're here manages a<br>team of 30 dedicated environmental<br>scientists<br>and during his careers worked for niwa<br>dairy NZ fonterra now waikato Regional<br>Council very much interested in the<br>effects of Agriculture on New Zealand's<br>Rivers thank you so much Mike for being<br>here and doing this important job and<br>our third judge is Rachel Africa Africa<br>and is here with us tonight is Pacific<br>Tongan salmon and Nati AWA descent and<br>Rachel's governance is underpinned by<br>values of Integrity Goodwill and<br>excellence and strategically influences<br>and encourages diverse discussions to<br>build to bridge build for purposes of<br>socio-economic prosperity for<br>communities businesses and government<br>for Global impact so we're really<br>delighted to have such excellent judging<br>a judge's team with us tonight thank you<br>so much for giving up your time to this<br>is here from the school of graduate<br>research hold your hand up right there<br>you'll see that Heather has um actually<br>has an iPad and keeping the time of<br>course is vital for this competition so<br>the contestants can see the time they<br>can also see and when there's 30 seconds<br>to go there'll be an orange card that is<br>held up and they'll know how much time<br>they have left so thank you so much for<br>doing that really important job<br>um here's how it works we will have at<br>the end of tonight we'll have a an<br>overall winner<br>uh the winner gets one thousand dollars<br>and a beautiful trophy which we'll<br>discuss when we get closer to awarding<br>that the runner-up prize uh 500 for the<br>runner-up and also you'll see in your<br>program and there'll be a big screen<br>display of a QR code there's a People's<br>Choice Award so when we go into<br>intermission please choose the presenter<br>who you would most like to receive the<br>People's Choice Award you'll have about<br>20 minutes to do that in the<br>intermission and also our people online<br>can do that as well so do put in your<br>you your<br>requests for who you would like to see<br>that to go to<br>the competition will run this way each<br>finalist has three minutes and as we<br>count down to that they'll be right in<br>front of our timekeeper<br>at the end of three minutes as as Karen<br>said the uh presenter has to stop<br>speaking or risk elimination<br>for this time when people are speaking<br>do make sure double check your phone is<br>off now and no movement if you can help<br>that between while people are presenting<br>there'll be times to talk after the<br>presentation is over and because judges<br>will need some time to write their notes<br>between each presenter please feel free<br>to Talk Amongst yourselves<br>so that's how we'll do it and I'm really<br>excited to get this underway<br>so for<br>um what we'll do now is that I'll<br>introduce the first finalist and then<br>after they speak I'll introduce each<br>other one following them when they leave<br>the stage the next one<br>so the student to remind you will speak<br>for three minutes we'll probably get<br>through each student each presenter<br>about around six minutes so let us begin<br>with the presentations this is why we're<br>here<br>okay so our first presenter is Jessica<br>leov<br>and Jessica will be right as hanging<br>right in the wings right now so she's<br>what do you think you can see if you're<br>inside the womb<br>I ask because we're actually in the dark<br>when it comes to understanding how our<br>vision develops during pregnancy<br>for my research I work with fetuses I<br>study how they engage with their visual<br>world and what that can tell us about<br>our abilities prior to birth<br>now if you're going to study Vision<br>usually look to eyes and eye movements<br>good news fetuses have eyes but they are<br>slightly inaccessible<br>so how do we do it<br>well I use 2D ultrasound and that's what<br>you're looking at today this is a 2d<br>ultrasound of a fetal head<br>let me orientate you<br>we're looking at what we call the<br>transverse section so it's a bird's eye<br>view and we're coming down through the<br>top of the layers to about here<br>the two black circles you can see<br>they're the fetus's eyes<br>and within the eye where the red arrow<br>is pointing is a white dot that's the<br>fetal lens now I get really excited when<br>I see this because as the fetus moves<br>its eyes around the lens moves too<br>this means that I can track in real time<br>where a fetus looks<br>and how long they look at something for<br>and I use this and I give fetuses a<br>little bit of a light show<br>I present lights in different patterns<br>and orientations to the maternal skin<br>which goes through to the fetus and I<br>record how they respond<br>my experiments ask questions like if I<br>present a light to the side of the<br>fetus's face do I see more eye movements<br>than if I present it in the front<br>I can ask about their preferences<br>defeaters is prefer to look at certain<br>patterns more like faces or different<br>types of movement<br>I can even ask about memory can fetuses<br>remember where I've presented a light in<br>the past and will they look there again<br>in the future<br>taken together I hope to build a<br>comprehensive picture of fetal vision<br>why well our knowledge of this area is<br>embryonic<br>and if I can work out what typical<br>responses are it means I can also work<br>out what atypical responses are<br>and that's really important for the<br>medical field for early interventions<br>ensuring the best possible Health<br>outcomes for our Pippi<br>as a developed mental psychologist it's<br>so exciting because I'm getting to see<br>the origin story of vision<br>what are those foundational building<br>blocks that we have that we use to<br>understand sight<br>by shining a light on fetal visual<br>perception I have another piece of the<br>puzzle that helps us understand how we<br>grow into the amazing complex human<br>thank you so much Jessica we'll give<br>judges some time<br>and almost difficult to go first but we<br>are underway and we're getting the next<br>one ready so we'll just wait a few<br>okay well I think we can go to our<br>second presenter<br>I'm delighted to welcome Christian keep<br>me ye to Kimmy to the stage uh Christian<br>is speaking to music and science<br>improving student engagement through ART<br>first scenario<br>you are fighting in the Russian<br>Revolution at the beginning of the 20th<br>century<br>and the rate operator near you is<br>playing with his antennas<br>and making weird sounds out of them<br>some years later the same operator is in<br>a lab extracting the same weird sounds<br>out of a gas meter<br>it doesn't take long for him to start<br>playing classical music pieces with his<br>newly invented instrument the theremin<br>the first electronic instrument created<br>played Without physical contact you just<br>with your hands in the air<br>if you ever heard and knew your spooky<br>sound out of a sci-fi horror movie from<br>that'sothermia<br>second scenario<br>you are a teenage student in a<br>developing country<br>with one of the poorest responses to the<br>covet pandemic like Brazil<br>you have spent the last two years locked<br>at home and with all your social<br>interactions taking place online from<br>Friends<br>to school<br>during this time there was no Prospect<br>of when it would end or when you receive<br>a vaccine to protect yourself from the<br>virus that took almost 1 Million Lives<br>of our compatriots<br>then<br>we can arrive at the third scenario my<br>research<br>I brought this exotic instrument the<br>theremin to reach these students and<br>increase the engagement in science and<br>art<br>12 encounters were held with four<br>classes of 20 students between 13 15<br>years old and data was collected before<br>during and after the after these<br>meetings with interviews focus groups<br>and my own reflective Journal<br>the students experimented with the<br>instrument and even without any prior<br>music training they were able to play<br>with it due to the close relation that<br>therein has with image gesture and sound<br>they told stories using their own<br>creative capacity in the out of this<br>world sounds of the theremin and<br>composed their own music using<br>alternative music notation this colored<br>one here in the corner<br>then we built our own Optical thurmonds<br>but the fun part is they were divided<br>into three groups and each group learned<br>how to make a third of the process<br>so when they were abroad altogether they<br>had to rely on peer-to-peer teaching and<br>learning to have their own instrument<br>built<br>and at the end of the workshops all<br>students were able to bring their own<br>instrument home in perfect working order<br>so this is what my research is about<br>improving student engagement through ART<br>and electronics thank you<br>thank you Christian right<br>further judges are working hard<br>each of these topics are so interesting<br>well I'd like to welcome to this stage<br>Rebecca Connor Rebecca is speaking<br>tonight about the effects of management<br>on the welfare and behavior of captive<br>kiwi<br>a few months ago my phone started<br>blowing up with messages Rebecca Rebecca<br>have you seen the news<br>after quickly confirming that the world<br>chocolate Supply was okay and that sir<br>David Attenborough was still with us I<br>found the article everyone was pointing<br>me to<br>powder a kiwi at Miami Zoo was being<br>handled and pet under bright lights and<br>New Zealand was ballistic<br>all credit to Miami though because as<br>soon as this was brought to their<br>attention they immediately stopped the<br>encounter<br>apologized and committed to building a<br>new home for powder with a nocturnal<br>enclosure<br>the Department of Conservation is now to<br>provide a copy of the Kiwi husbandry<br>manual to All American zoos holding kiwi<br>which means I have to get a move on<br>because my research focuses on trying to<br>fill in some of the blanks that our<br>current knowledge and understand and<br>leave within that very manual<br>you see<br>animals in captivity simply don't Thrive<br>if we don't get it right<br>their health longevity breeding success<br>and overall well-being can all suffer if<br>we get it wrong<br>and when it comes to Kiwi our national<br>icon and much love Tonga<br>there's a lot that we simply don't know<br>the first part of my research involved<br>conducting a survey of 23 facilities<br>from here and around the world asking<br>about how they looked after their kiwi<br>what I found was variation especially<br>between nocturnal houses for example<br>kiwi would fit anywhere from Once to<br>three times a day<br>temperature ranged from 12 to 24 degrees<br>Celsius<br>and lighting vary between<br>is it that dark Blobby thing and I can<br>see it's whiskers<br>what we need to know is what works best<br>for kiwi and what environmental and<br>husbandry variables they prefer which is<br>the next part of my research<br>my study is measuring the behavior that<br>kiwi are performing in nocturnal houses<br>around New Zealand<br>this includes exactly where in the<br>enclosure key we are spending their time<br>as well as their responses to<br>environmental and housing variables like<br>lighting levels sound levels feeding<br>frequency and visitor Behavior<br>these results will give us a much better<br>understanding of what conditions are<br>best for kiwi in captivity<br>this will feed directly to into<br>improving the Kiwi husbandry manual<br>resulting in better well-being and<br>Welfare<br>for our captain of kiwi both here and<br>around the world including<br>powder<br>hope people are keeping keeping their<br>okay we're ready for our next speaker<br>our next presenter<br>is William alouche William is speaking<br>tonight about low-carbon regenerative<br>houses powered by trees and plants<br>towards circularity in the construction<br>thank you<br>does anyone know or remember Lego blocks<br>know these little toys that you can use<br>to assemble and disassemble structures<br>well I believe that they can be key to<br>address the current environmental impact<br>of our construction sector<br>because today our buildings consume four<br>out of five of the most energy intensive<br>materials and they generate about one<br>third of the world's waste in other<br>words our buildings contribute massively<br>to global warming even before they are<br>built and since they are not designed<br>for the ReUse or repair of building<br>components I eventually the recycling of<br>building materials well they generate a<br>lot of waste and that's why through my<br>research I aim to develop my own Lego<br>Blocks made from low carbon and<br>recyclable materials and that can be<br>used to easily assemble a building that<br>we can deconstruct later on when we need<br>to<br>my research methods involve using<br>computer simulation to assess if plant<br>and wood-based materials that are<br>renewable as well can be used in the<br>structure of the building instead of<br>current synthetic building materials and<br>once I have found my technical concept I<br>will be able to prototype my self-made<br>Lego blocks to assess experimentally the<br>assembly disassembly potential<br>but why am I so interested in plants or<br>biomass in general<br>well we do have the Technologies today<br>to extract natural fibers from plants<br>and engineer them into strong recyclable<br>building materials and wood is naturally<br>ideal for construction because of its<br>low density High mechanical properties<br>and the potential for it to be reused or<br>recycled into something useful but what<br>I find most interesting with plants or<br>biomass is that during its growth it<br>captures CO2 from the atmosphere that<br>can be locked away in buildings for a<br>long time and I am particularly<br>interested in fast growing plants such<br>as a straw or hemp or flax that can<br>capture significant amounts of CO2 just<br>like Timber but it does so in a very<br>short time a few years a few months even<br>and that can have an immediate effect on<br>global warming but if we want to achieve<br>these environmental benefits we have to<br>keep the biomass in use as long as<br>possible and that's why I also research<br>how we can design our building<br>components to be assembled in a<br>reversible manner<br>just like fitting them together like<br>Lego blocks and once we do that at the<br>end of the building's life well we can<br>easily separate the building components<br>and the building materials to reuse or<br>recycle them independently<br>and the carbon that was stored in the<br>first building life can be stored again<br>in the next building life and the next<br>and the next<br>so yes I still find inspiration with my<br>favorite childhood toys<br>but don't worry I will not go after<br>really good blocks after this thank you<br>all right we're ready for our next<br>speaker<br>um delighted to welcome Amber Bell to<br>the stage Amber Bella speaking to the<br>title heavy metal pollutants and honey<br>honeybees you probably don't realize how<br>much of an impact these cute little<br>creatures have on your everyday lives<br>approximately one-third of Global Food<br>production relies on animal pollination<br>with a significant portion being done by<br>The Humble honeybee<br>unfortunately in the past couple of<br>decades honeybee Colony loss rates have<br>rapidly increased and it's important<br>that we determine the causes to try and<br>mitigate them<br>an understudied cause is the effect of<br>heavy metals on honeybees<br>Metals occur in the environment through<br>natural processes but human activity<br>also plays a major role<br>cadmium from superphosphate fertilizers<br>copper fungicides in Orchards and lead<br>from the era of leaded fuels are just a<br>few examples<br>Metals don't break down and these end up<br>in the nectar and the pollen the lbs<br>forage to take back it to feed the hive<br>potentially causing adverse effects to<br>the health of the entire colony<br>so for my research I wanted to answer<br>three questions<br>one in New Zealand what metals are<br>getting into our hives<br>I will collect and analyze the metal<br>content of B's and B products from hives<br>across the waikato and the surrounding<br>regions<br>two if these metals are ending up nlbs<br>where are they accumulating<br>and three how are these Metals affecting<br>the health of our individual bees and<br>therefore the health of our entire<br>colony<br>to answer these last two questions I<br>will take newly emerged bees into the<br>lab and feed them with sugar Solutions<br>laced with various Metals at<br>environmentally relevant concentrations<br>food consumption and mortality will be<br>monitored over a 20-day period after<br>which I'll take the bees bodies and<br>analyze them to determine where these<br>metals are accumulating such as the head<br>or the abdomen<br>further analysis will be carried out to<br>see if this accumulation is affecting<br>specific cellular processes within those<br>areas of the body<br>I will then these methods will give us a<br>better understanding of the mechanism by<br>which these Metals affect the health of<br>individual bees I'll then carry out the<br>similar experiments but with entire<br>colonies to see if what we observe in<br>the lab matches with what we might see<br>information beekeepers will be better<br>informed on the risks of heavy metals to<br>honeybee health<br>which may influence things like the<br>choice of Hive placement may be away<br>from areas of heavy traffic or decrease<br>the use of agrochemicals in the hive<br>vicinity to hopefully keep our bees<br>happy healthy and pollinating thank you<br>wonderful thank you Amber thank you very<br>much<br>foreign<br>lovely all right we're ready for the<br>next thank you so our next speaker is<br>David try David will speak about from<br>heat maps to hypergraphs visualizing<br>language data in aotearoa so thank you<br>David welcome to the stage<br>it's no secret that we live in a<br>data-driven society information is<br>everywhere and visualizations are<br>extremely helpful for finding meaning in<br>the madness<br>they can Aid comprehension communicate a<br>message or influence decision making<br>crucially they often lead to insights<br>that would otherwise be missed but<br>here's the rub there's no one chart type<br>for visualization technique to rule them<br>all the best visualization to use in a<br>given context depends on a variety of<br>factors including but not limited to the<br>type of data its size structure and<br>complexity<br>my research focuses on developing<br>visualization techniques for two<br>specific kinds of data categorical data<br>as shown in the heat map on the left<br>and set-based data as shown in the node<br>diagrams on the right<br>when I say categorical data I mean<br>variables like ethnicity which have<br>distinct categories Maori pakihar Etc<br>rather than numeric values<br>because I'm a linguist at heart I wanted<br>to apply these techniques to language<br>analysis but bear in mind that the<br>techniques can be generalized to<br>categories and sets from any domain<br>business science sport you name it<br>the heat map on the left relates to<br>Maori language use on Twitter this was<br>before the Elon Musk Administration<br>among other things it shows us that<br>Maori language tweeters tend to be Maori<br>female and based in New Zealand<br>but what makes this heat map special<br>well unlike other techniques which<br>aren't very scalable it's designed for<br>handling lots of categories I created an<br>interactive heat map Explorer which<br>allows you to change the mapping of the<br>data and perform statistical tests<br>I'm interested in visualizing not just<br>the speakers of a language but also what<br>they say<br>in one study I analyzed sets of Maori<br>words used in newspaper articles this is<br>where the three note diagrams come into<br>play<br>in the first diagram which has been<br>simplified two loan words are connected<br>if they co-occur in one or more articles<br>the second I'm sorry however this<br>network only shows pairs of loans not<br>the potentially larger sets of loans in<br>each article color is used to encode<br>extra information in this case number of<br>words<br>the second diagram preserves the says<br>while also showing how often they occur<br>and the third diagram<br>provides breaks down the sets in<br>relation to the colored attribute these<br>visualizations highlight that Maori<br>loanwords tend not to occur in isolation<br>if you use one you probably use many<br>I'm passionate about creating powerful<br>visualizations that help users to<br>uncover hidden meaning because data plus<br>visualization equals insights thank you<br>hmm<br>foreign<br>wonderful we're ready for our next<br>presenter I'm pleased to welcome Yu<br>Zhong Zhang to the stage Yu Zhong is<br>speaking about mobility of urban<br>diversity policy between rhetoric and<br>reality welcome you John<br>when I was 10 years old I spent a year<br>in aotearoa New Zealand I formed a lot<br>of good memories but I still faced<br>challenges as an outsider in society<br>I was once bullied at school for being<br>Asian<br>I remember how sad and shocked I was<br>this experience as a young migrant<br>became deeply embedded in my identity<br>and it sparked my interest in the<br>experiences of migrants around the world<br>particularly in South Korea<br>Korea considering itself as an<br>ethnically homogenous country opened its<br>door to migrants only since the 1990s<br>now to deal with growing Urban diversity<br>Korea often refers to the policies of<br>other countries<br>in 2020 ansan a city with the largest<br>migrant population in Korea adopted the<br>Intercultural cities program<br>launched by the Council of Europe it<br>aims for social inclusion of migrants<br>through their daily interaction with<br>local people<br>currently it has over 100 participant<br>cities around the world showing the<br>power and mobility of this policy<br>well when we think about how policy<br>ideas travel we often assume that a<br>policy's reputation will guarantee a<br>smooth transition in a new context<br>but the reality is a new policy often<br>undergoes unexpected twist as it gets<br>translated into a new context<br>to investigate the implementation of the<br>Intercultural cities program in ansan I<br>conducted critical discourse analysis of<br>key documents as well as its interviews<br>with local stakeholders<br>I found a notable gap between rhetoric<br>and live reality<br>whereas ansan actively promote itself as<br>an Intercultural City the local people<br>weren't aware of it<br>so why does it happen the program was<br>adopted shortly before the local<br>election which influenced how it was<br>framed in ansan to attract to voters<br>politicians try to portray the current<br>status of the cities in positive Ways by<br>emphasizing the city's connection to the<br>European cities program<br>so the focus was on publicly announcing<br>we are endorsed by the Council of Europe<br>as an Intercultural city which did not<br>involve sufficient discussion with<br>different local stakeholders<br>so what does this research tell us<br>imagine if you wanted the house<br>renovation but only ended up with a<br>paint job<br>we need to look into the context and the<br>implementation process when introducing<br>a new policy thank you<br>all right we're ready for our next<br>speaker<br>I'm pleased to welcome Larissa cough to<br>the stage Larissa is speaking tonight<br>unveiling Hidden Truths the hunt for<br>defects with thermal thermography<br>welcome Larissa<br>who is driven walked or cycled across a<br>bridge today<br>my daily commute takes me across a Steel<br>Bridge one very similar to Victoria<br>Bridge<br>have you ever paused for a moment<br>wondering what's happening behind the<br>coating okay maybe that's an engineer's<br>thing to do why<br>well we know that rust can affect most<br>metals and eventually lead to failure so<br>we paint parts to protect them but<br>Coatings aren't foolproof and rust can<br>form behind the Paint heading out of<br>sight and Gamma noticed until it's too<br>late for repairs so what if we can find<br>a way to detect it earlier and fix the<br>rust before it becomes a problem and<br>that's where my research comes in<br>I use what is called thermography it's a<br>non-invasive way of inspecting a pup for<br>defects like rust or cracks it only<br>needs a small heat Source like a camera<br>flash and a thermal camera<br>downslide it's pretty slow since you can<br>only inspect a small area at a time<br>you'd have to do over 30 000 individual<br>tests just to inspect one of those<br>artists in the photo sounds like a lot<br>well I thought so so I'm developing a<br>different method<br>to allow for quicker inspection of large<br>structures like Bridges and planes<br>you might think come on Larissa easy<br>just put the camera on a robot and scan<br>across the surface wow two problems with<br>that firstly we need a more concentrated<br>heat source<br>so think back to your childhood of using<br>a magnifying glass and the sun to burn<br>holes and paper and we can use that idea<br>to concentrate the Heat<br>second problem<br>how much data do you think you're going<br>to have to store and look at to do 30<br>000 tests a lot but that is what<br>currently happens in industry a highly<br>trained operator has to sit there<br>analyzing every single image mistakes<br>are bound to happen and it all costs a<br>lot of money the result only critical<br>areas are inspected and often the<br>effects are missed but here's the<br>exciting part I have a solution using<br>over 2 000 data sets I've developed an<br>algorithm that can autonomously detect<br>corrosion on the Coatings even better it<br>can tell you exactly how much corrosion<br>there is<br>now I'm not done with what I want to do<br>but initial tests using a curved mirror<br>to concentrate the heat a moving sample<br>and my algorithm look promising and they<br>have been able to detect and quantify<br>the slice of defects so on your way home<br>tonight take a moment to notice all the<br>structures we encounter like the bridge<br>so many of us drive across every day<br>well the building we're in and think<br>about her filmography in my research can<br>help detect problems early and keep all<br>of us safe thank you<br>brilliant<br>all right we're ready for our next<br>presenter Rachel barbich Crawford Rachel<br>will speak to the title effects of<br>environmental and behavioral factors on<br>fish swimming performance and passage<br>success Rachel welcome to the stage<br>imagine you're 40 weeks pregnant you've<br>just gone into Libre and your<br>contractions are getting closer together<br>you're racing against time to reach the<br>hospital<br>as you're on the road you come face to<br>face with a giant boulder there is no<br>getting around this roadblock you're<br>stuck with nowhere to go<br>this is the fate of our freshwater fish<br>many of our fish must fight against<br>man-made roadblocks as they migrate<br>Upstream<br>one of the most common roadblocks are<br>culverts which pipe rivers and streams<br>under roads<br>culverts can create fish passage<br>barriers like the one in a slide<br>preventing fish from completing their<br>life cycle<br>there are millions of fish passage<br>barriers around the world leading to<br>population declines and even local<br>extinctions here in New Zealand over<br>half our River network is practically<br>inaccessible to our native fish<br>in order to remediate these barriers and<br>create healthy ecosystems for fish and<br>humans we need evidence-based Solutions<br>one of the key pieces of information we<br>need is to understand the water velocity<br>that a fish can swim against<br>essentially how fast can they swim which<br>is where my research comes in<br>understanding the swimming ability of<br>migratory white bait bullies and Eels<br>I do this by placing them in a fish<br>treadmill where I adjust things like<br>water speed and temperature<br>I'm also examining how things like<br>behavioral factors such as schooling and<br>environmental factors such as<br>temperature influence swimming ability<br>one of the biggest takeaways for my<br>research so far is that swimming ability<br>is highly variable<br>not only did we find significant<br>differences in swimming ability between<br>species we also found significant<br>differences within each species<br>indicating that not every individual<br>within a species is able to swim at the<br>same speed<br>this is a problem because most of our<br>Solutions are designed to the average<br>swimming fish<br>to put this into perspective imagine<br>you're in a group of students racing to<br>catch the school bus home but only the<br>fastest 50 percent of you will be able<br>to make it on that bus leaving everyone<br>else behind<br>this highlights the need to design<br>solutions to the lowest common<br>denominator we would never leave behind<br>fifty percent of our students so we<br>shouldn't leave behind fifty percent of<br>our fish<br>we know that most of our fish swim<br>faster and some swim slower<br>but most solutions are designed to the<br>average swimming fish<br>if we only do this then half of our fish<br>are stuck at the bottom of a culvert<br>unable to complete their life cycle<br>leading to potential population collapse<br>here's some food for thought if we don't<br>notice when we're swimming driving over<br>a stream then a fish shouldn't notice<br>when it's swimming under a road and<br>that's why fish passage matters thank<br>you<br>wonderful thank you Rachel thank you<br>we are now ready for our last presenter<br>our last finalist<br>um please welcome to the stage roshanna<br>Cameron uh who is speaking to the title<br>exploring bullying against University<br>teachers in Pakistan a corrosive<br>workplace issue welcome Roshana<br>good evening<br>so workplace bullying what is workplace<br>bullying workplace bullying breaks heart<br>lowers morale decreases the drive and<br>passion and the confidence to do<br>productive and meaningful work<br>so what is bullying bullying encompasses<br>workplace harassment in all form from<br>verbal abuse physical intimidation to<br>social isolation<br>statistical data shows that workplace<br>bullying is a common phenomena worldwide<br>with the highest reporting cases in<br>America 40 percent UK 38 Brazil India<br>China 28 26 24<br>however with respect to Pakistan there<br>is a positive research on the topic only<br>37 Studies have been conducted in the<br>last 20 years with respect to educative<br>air facing bullying at tertiary level<br>my research is a bicoditative research<br>focuses on the perspective<br>experience and coping strategies of<br>teachers who have encountered incidents<br>of bullying in their professional life<br>the existing research shows that the<br>victim deals with the phenomena on<br>individual basis and the role of<br>organization is missing to address this<br>the research is further going to<br>highlight some of the reasons why there<br>is a scarcity of research on the topic<br>one being the pulley the taboo attached<br>to this topic<br>people are reluctant to talk about their<br>bullying experience with the fear that<br>they will be considered weak and<br>incompetent another reason is the<br>patriarchal culture that is prevalent in<br>Pakistani Society<br>we men are given more importance than<br>women and women are often not taken<br>seriously when they are reporting cases<br>like this<br>The Limited empirical data on workplace<br>pulling with respect to Pakistani agis<br>is a clear indication that we need more<br>serious research to understand this<br>corrosive workplace issue my research is<br>an important step in addressing this Gap<br>in knowledge and developing effective<br>interventions to prevent and address<br>workplace pulling in Pakistani heis<br>thank you<br>well thank you so much Roshana we've<br>come to the end of the presentations of<br>the finalists but I'd like<br>all of the finalists to come back on the<br>stage together<br>pop back up on the stage and we will<br>and we'll have and Roshana is coming<br>um<br>so please join with me to<br>um<br>celebrate<br>foreign<br>well done everyone it's been really hard<br>for me not to talk about your talks in<br>between each one because I wanted to<br>interact with all of the topics so thank<br>you so much for delivering such<br>wonderful presentations and when I watch<br>them come down and sit down you could<br>just feel the anxiety melt away they<br>just sunk into their seats and<br>congratulated each other when the the<br>next speaker came back to sit down so<br>I'm really delighted<br>um I bet you're really delighted that<br>it's all over at this point so well done<br>another round of applause I think<br>okay<br>so let me just explain what will happen<br>now shortly we'll go to a have a have a<br>break intermission so<br>um what will happen during the time we<br>have but before coming back is that you<br>must vote as for the People's Choice<br>Award so don't forget to scan the QR<br>code you can find it in the program uh<br>it's right there also for people who<br>don't have a phone or have flat battery<br>or whatever it is there is a school of<br>graduate research person ready to help<br>you to do a manual vote so no one is<br>Left Behind in terms of voting for The<br>People's Choice<br>and you'll have about 20 minutes from<br>the break before we close that vote for<br>you so please get onto it as soon as you<br>go to the intermission<br>we also have there's the cash bar is<br>open of course and the there's some<br>refreshments there as well<br>and while you're out having a break our<br>judges will be working hard<br>on their notes and deliberating on the<br>winner and the runner-up oh I'll run out<br>we actually are very good for time we're<br>a bit ahead of time but I will I will<br>let you go and have a break so um do be<br>back here by about quarter past eight<br>would be fantastic please relax enjoy<br>the facilities and come back and then<br>we'll we'll start our second part off of<br>this evening with a presentation by the<br>Masters thesis winner so uh poppy will<br>poppy Romero will be giving a<br>presentation before we go on to do the<br>awarding so thank you everyone for your<br>attention and we'll see you back here<br>foreign<br>foreign<br>thank you<br>foreign<br>foreign<br>foreign<br>foreign<br>foreign<br>foreign<br>foreign<br>foreign<br>foreign<br>foreign<br>foreign<br>foreign<br>thank you<br>foreign<br>foreign<br>foreign<br>thank you<br>foreign<br>foreign<br>foreign<br>foreign<br>foreign<br>foreign<br>foreign<br>foreign<br>foreign<br>foreign<br>foreign<br>foreign<br>all right well we are at that exciting<br>part of the evening the judges have<br>deliberated they have made their<br>decisions<br>before we hear what their decisions are<br>I'm really delighted to be able to<br>introduce the Master's thesis winner and<br>the Master's thesis winner is Poppy<br>Romero and she has spoken and this is<br>what she won on above ground restoration<br>and urban green spaces can it promote<br>human and Wildlife Health by influencing<br>their mic<br>microbiomees so I welcome poppy to the<br>stage to give us her master's thesis<br>presentation the winning one thank you<br>over half of humans now live in cities<br>which cover less than three percent of<br>Earth's surface<br>cities are usually established in areas<br>of naturally High biodiversity rich and<br>Native species that are now exposed to<br>anthropogenic factors such as<br>fragmentation and exotic species<br>introductions<br>I'm investigating how restoring soil<br>biodiversity in urban green spaces can<br>promote human health<br>an urban Green Space is a complex<br>ecosystem found largely below ground<br>that sustains plants animals and<br>microbes<br>your local City forest is an example of<br>an urban Green Space<br>emerging evidence suggests that exposure<br>to soil biodiversity Within These Urban<br>green spaces can promote human and<br>Wildlife Health by influencing our<br>microbiomes<br>if that's true that would suggest that<br>restoring Urban green spaces with the<br>goal of enhancing soil biodiversity<br>could have positive profound effects on<br>the health of people living near these<br>restored forests<br>however the development of soil<br>biodiversity following above ground<br>restoration is poorly understood<br>as are the pathways through which people<br>are exposed to that biodiversity<br>so I'm contributing to the development<br>of our knowledge by studying how animals<br>and microbes in the soil respond to<br>Urban restoration across aotearoa<br>to do that I'm using soil samples taken<br>from a set of sites across the country<br>that share similar environmental<br>attributes but span a range of different<br>ages we call that a Chrono sequence and<br>having one to take samples from is<br>fundamental because they can be used to<br>understand ecosystems and measure their<br>critical characteristics<br>our results will inform important<br>guidelines for Designing above ground<br>restoration plantings that will support<br>diverse soil microbes important for<br>supplying that beneficial microbial<br>exposure for humans and Wildlife and<br>aotearoa<br>and by investigating that I plan to shed<br>light on the often overlooked black box<br>of below ground biodiversity which might<br>be critical for promoting the health of<br>humans in our cities<br>David Attenborough once said nature<br>wants determined how we survived now we<br>determine how nature survives<br>let's reframe that we do still rely on<br>nature to survive so we must now figure<br>out how we can help nature help us thank<br>you<br>wonderful we can see why she's a winner<br>that was brilliant thank you poppy thank<br>you so much and now I'm going to invite<br>people to the stage so I'm going to<br>invite all of our contestants tonight to<br>come to the stage<br>um contestants who we've heard give<br>their wonderful talks and also I'd like<br>the judges to join us on the stage and<br>whatever uh<br>phuketu the stage as well so<br>um<br>so what we'll do is<br>um the the judges all have different<br>roles here and the first judge will be<br>giving some overall feedback and also<br>announcing the People's Choice Award<br>um and then the second judge will<br>announce the runner-up and then before<br>we announce the winner tonight<br>uh we will ask wedemu to speak about the<br>Tonga um that is the award the professor<br>John D McCraw award so I welcome Mike up<br>to the stage to the mic to tell us a<br>little bit about your overall<br>Impressions thank you before announcing<br>it's been an absolute privilege to be<br>here tonight to listen to next<br>generation of our researchers I really<br>believe that that research is a service<br>to our community whether the developers<br>the custodians of the knowledge of our<br>communities and we we serve our<br>communities through the the information<br>that that we provide to help address<br>problems of today and tomorrow I was<br>really impressed with our group of<br>researchers here I think they have<br>really epitomized through the m3mt how<br>you communicate technical information<br>and really valuable information in a in<br>a very short amount of time<br>um it was a very difficult role for<br>um we judges to come up with uh the the<br>winner and the runner-up I think there<br>was only half a point<br>um separating so very very close and I<br>really do thank all the all the<br>finalists for their great presentations<br>tonight<br>but I will start with a presentation of<br>the People's Choice Award which you<br>lovely people and folks online have<br>voted for and tonight the winner of the<br>doctoral competition 2023 People's<br>Choice Award is Larissa cough<br>congratulations<br>and our the next judge who is going to<br>announce the runner-up<br>I invite Rachel to the mic to do that<br>thank you Rachel<br>one Pacific greetings it's wonderful to<br>be here this evening thank you for the<br>opportunity<br>um to be one of the three judges<br>um this evening<br>um as we're deliberating upstairs<br>um as you heard it was only by half a<br>point<br>but I would like to say congratulations<br>to all of you who were very brave and<br>courageous to be here this evening I<br>brought my 14 year old son who goes to<br>St John's and he's preparing for his<br>speech and so I'm sure he learned a lot<br>this evening<br>so without further Ado I'd like to<br>congratulate<br>Larissa cough<br>there's a runner-up of the scene thank<br>you<br>congratulations Larissa on that<br>runner-up award<br>um and please whatever it would be<br>wonderful if you could speak to us about<br>the award<br>here<br>but now I have to go to a movie and<br>educate myself what a Barbie is so um<br>either way look it's a pleasure to be<br>here tonight and to acknowledge the the<br>hard work of the students at our PhD the<br>crib of our crop<br>just reflection on the late professor<br>John mccrawal<br>Professor McCraw was the foundation<br>professor of his Sciences here at the<br>University<br>and we spark quite a close Association<br>and friendship because he's one of the<br>very few professors at the time he knew<br>how to bridge Mata rangamari and science<br>together<br>show you the lens of their Sciences<br>so and so Professor McCraw and I for<br>many many years we looked at the geology<br>of this of our region we looked at the<br>traditional Stone sources and things<br>like that soils and I do miss them<br>but the trophy that is there is a their<br>exec replica of one of the British<br>museum I'm quite tempted to take that<br>one to London and bring back their the<br>real one<br>they were low<br>um but but the symbol of the tikiwanda<br>was something that was held at very high<br>esteem than our traditional schools of<br>learning uh<br>and that was usually just held by the<br>tohunga ahuruwa<br>that was the the most learned of our of<br>our ancient ancestors and various realms<br>from astronomy if science<br>knowing everything about the environment<br>and about the tire<br>so<br>so without further Ado that's uh this is<br>the John mccroll uh Memorial trophy<br>there and again not really in uh<br>thankful to be here tonight to present<br>this trophy kyotato<br>thank you so much it's wonderful to have<br>you here and<br>um but I won't keep us any longer I'm<br>going to invite parikhafia to come to<br>the mic and announce our overall winner<br>for tonight's 3mt finals<br>foreign<br>Ty doctoral competition for 2023 on<br>behalf of<br>now judges were really delighted and<br>honored to welcome you Rebecca Connor<br>foreign<br>foreign<br>what an amazing event a round of<br>applause again for all of the<br>contestants<br>congratulations all of you for giving<br>such wonderful presentations and being<br>here at this at this stage and<br>delivering so well to us we've really<br>been treated to incredible research and<br>wonderful communication so thank you so<br>much I extend a big a huge thank you<br>also to our judges thank you very much<br>for also being here and doing the job of<br>of that difficult job of deciding who<br>the winner and the runner-up was or is<br>and we know that you're very busy people<br>but I think Mike as you mentioned at the<br>start it's a real honor to hear this<br>work and this research that's happening<br>thank you<br>I'd also<br>um really like to thank all of you for<br>being here tonight for supporting your<br>person or your people for being<br>supervisors or whanau or friends what<br>whatever your role is we can't get to<br>this high standard without all of you so<br>uh so that leaves us with uh just some<br>closing remarks and closing karakia and<br>a big thank you from me again to all the<br>work that's gone in particularly from<br>the school of graduate research to get<br>this running it's a big event uh with a<br>big events team so thank you to to all<br>of you as well and thank you fetu for<br>usually I'll just say the karakia but<br>I'm going to say one thing<br>I'm a graduate of the management school<br>today Papa and also of to putting a<br>faculty of law notice none of them made<br>the finals anyone from my schools<br>I don't know if that's because the law<br>is just boring and it's very hard to sex<br>up accounting or economics or things<br>like that but uh I'll be talking to the<br>respective Pro Vice chancellors to see<br>what's what's going on in my schools but<br>um no what a enjoyable enjoyable evening<br>um<br>foreign</p></main><footer style="margin-top: 2rem; background: #0001; padding: 2rem; text-align: center;"><p>We
