visibilizing<br>student voice and decolonizing education<br>at otago<br>I'd like to give Rachel and Kim an<br>opportunity to introduce themselves<br>before we get into the substantive<br>discussion this afternoon so Rachel Tina<br>uh<br>um<br>called kangoms temuka could grade 2<br>so just by way of introduction and<br>letting people know what we're going to<br>be doing this afternoon I'll just<br>explain a little bit about this cult<br>corridor<br>we three are going to be talking a<br>little bit about the research project<br>and its potential implications for<br>University teaching for our learning<br>spaces our architectures our<br>relationships with each other<br>there's also a few reflective questions<br>that you would have come across when you<br>were registering for the session today<br>and so later on we will have some time<br>for Q a to reflect on those questions or<br>to respond to anything that might come<br>up both from here in the room and for<br>people who are watching online<br>there's also a QR code in the room and<br>later there'll be a link to a QR poll<br>sit in the zoom chat<br>there's a question that Kim and Rachel<br>have asked us to contemplate today<br>they are wanting to know how we might be<br>feeling about the prospect of<br>decolonizing or re-indigenizing<br>education at otago<br>so at some point in the discussion I'll<br>ask the folk behind the scenes to make<br>that QR code live<br>and then we'll keep talking and you can<br>get on there and give us some of your<br>thoughts<br>so by way of getting started then I'd<br>really like to just hear in general<br>about the project and so I think of your<br>answer in turn that'll be useful so Kim<br>I'd like to know what was the project<br>and how did you how did you come to it<br>so uh Rachel and in fact all three of us<br>teach on education studies papers<br>and in those ways that you the greatest<br>thoughts happen in the kitchen we're<br>having a chat one day about our<br>respective papers I was working on a<br>lecturing a paper on global citizenship<br>education and Rachel<br>and we were talking about conversations<br>in the classroom focused on<br>decolonization and um<br>the how inspired students were in their<br>conversations when given the opportunity<br>to talk about matters that they see feel<br>here so Rachel I'll hand over and then<br>we had we were having a look I call them<br>the caputi conversations and uh we're<br>talking about I with the titirito<br>waitangi course said I teach about<br>education at the college and we saw some<br>synergies across what we were were doing<br>and some of the aspects that I were<br>talking about<br>could you know could be included in and<br>comes and and we ended up talking about<br>decolonization in our process too<br>because if you're looking at titirito or<br>waitangi and if we're looking at aspects<br>where we're thinking well what does<br>partnership and relationships look like<br>then how do we decolonize ourselves<br>first to get to that thinking and that<br>feeling about what that would look like<br>in action and so um yeah well then we<br>decided well that would be also great<br>course wouldn't it where you combined<br>what we were we were talking about as<br>well so that's how it kind of started<br>and then we made the application<br>great so um so you work with students<br>um can you tell me what your research<br>question was and what did you actually<br>do with the student participants okay uh<br>so the research question apologies to<br>people watching in what ways do students<br>experience a higher education that is<br>respectful of titirito waitangi and<br>monofinoa relationships and Partnerships<br>at otako<br>and so we took uh we were in I guess<br>inspired by hepuapua which Rachel will<br>talk about later in the Colorado which<br>is a it is a power sharing approach<br>to working and and taking that we drew<br>from corpori so we took a Wanaka<br>approach seeing our interactions with<br>students in a Wanaka space a space for<br>thinking for sharing for debate<br>discussion and we also uh Drew from<br>photo mapping so that's a participatory<br>action approach and we used Instagram<br>for that platform<br>and so we had also a colleague who's no<br>longer at otako Dr Yasmin Abdul Aziz um<br>so<br>she's now working at the University of<br>Toronto she joined our team as a um<br>research fellow at assistant research<br>fellow and she was a sort of a bridge<br>between ourselves and students across<br>the university initially we were<br>thinking that our project would work<br>with education studies students because<br>they come from all departments<br>but word on the kumara vine got out that<br>this project was going ahead and Yasmin<br>was receiving inquiries from people all<br>over the show<br>so we went back to cult and ethics and<br>asked to broaden expand it uh you know<br>our participant range which they were<br>happy to do<br>and uh yeah no we got about 60 was it 66<br>68 thank you students from across all<br>the different departments in the<br>university and the group we go gosh that<br>would be wonderful to teach had some<br>amazing you know they were obviously<br>there because that was they're<br>interested in that topic and they were<br>interested in being there because of the<br>experiences that they had had<br>um at this University so that's why I<br>think it made it quite exciting for us<br>to find out and talk about their results<br>I would say all right and and I'd like<br>to come to what you've learned soon but<br>um I think the elephant in the room<br>first of all we're talking about<br>decolonization but it's a big question<br>right yeah so um I'm wondering if you<br>can give me your elevator pitch about<br>what what you think the colonization is<br>or how you make sense of this idea of<br>decolonizing<br>okay so um<br>the what started our conversation so is<br>that I was using some work by George<br>sefer day a Ghanaian indigenous scholar<br>whose research has looked at<br>specifically the higher education<br>environment and so that perspective sees<br>decolonization as dismantling<br>structures and systems which maintain<br>power privilege<br>um value in particular knowledge systems<br>and in particular hands it also<br>questions the whole nation of personhood<br>and you know how certain bodily forms<br>certain<br>um<br>impairments and disabilities became less<br>than human and so it's a very inclusive<br>approach to thinking about the world<br>we're in in addition to ethnicity<br>culture Linguistics and so it is a it's<br>the broadest sense and that's where our<br>conversations and the synergies over<br>that so Rachel adding to that so my<br>influences<br>um is from Moana Jackson and he has now<br>passed but uh just wonderful speaker you<br>know the ability to walk her down walk<br>down the road and think what you're<br>going to say and have your themes and<br>all sorted from going on a walk is<br>incredible for the rest of us have to<br>write things down but from for more From<br>moana's perspective it's looking at<br>um re-modification and in that sense so<br>putting Marty back into the space so for<br>if you're going to say deconalize<br>something then you're actually centering<br>uh colonization itself again or the<br>Western Europe pain perspective goes<br>into the center instead of it being<br>about well what is it that the titiriti<br>or waitangi wanted us to know or why was<br>it put in place and that's because this<br>has become a colonized space so we're<br>trying to put Marty back into the center<br>and enabling us to be<br>reclaiming the right to govern ourselves<br>in our own land so the rakatira taka<br>aspect of decolonization is really<br>important for me so it's not just a<br>space about looking at what we do here<br>but what we do for Maori in this space<br>too uh yeah and that's um did you want<br>head input into this particular document<br>and and so does a few others and it was<br>talking about if I'm talking about<br>space but that is a sphere at the moment<br>that is very small<br>so if we're wanting a joint sphere which<br>is where the titirito or waitangi or the<br>remodification of the spaces they're<br>where we joint and work together in a<br>partnership space is still very very<br>small and then you look at the car one<br>Tonga space<br>is huge okay that's that's kind of<br>governing us so that's where we are at<br>the moment so the invis to change that<br>space and what that looks like so that<br>you would have the rangatiratanga spear<br>you'd have that beautiful middle spare<br>we're working all together and the<br>government sphere so it's Equitable<br>across so I think about<br>colonization you know decolonization is<br>reimagining that space we're imagining<br>what it would look like for us and how<br>it could work and um one of Jackson's<br>done a lot of work in that space which<br>is<br>um I find really interesting about what<br>it would look like sound like feel like<br>if we change that space hi and that<br>canutis take me back you use the term<br>remodification and and I've written a<br>note to myself about<br>um re-indigenizing so re-modification<br>re-indigenizing yeah same idea yes<br>similar but it's if you saved<br>modification if you're adding on to the<br>reindigenization then yeah the focus is<br>on<br>um Marty and centering us again in that<br>space okay so it's not just about<br>working with<br>um non-madi to uh bring ourselves up<br>into that space Marty have actually been<br>colonized as well so we we've got our<br>own work to do we're looking at<br>ourselves and so we need our space where<br>we can uplift what we are doing because<br>at the moment if I think of my own<br>um for us we'll end an education itself<br>we've got a new curriculum that's coming<br>out that is asking for hapu aniwi to be<br>involved<br>but at the moment we've got our own<br>whanau members that don't actually have<br>access to that information within our<br>own hapu so a remarification would be us<br>looking at ourselves first in assisting<br>our own whanau members to have all of<br>this information Etc so they can be<br>comfortable rather than someone else<br>telling them when they're in an<br>education space<br>so we've got all that's that's kind of<br>works in with the reindigenization by<br>modification for us too all right so um<br>although I think I hear what you're<br>saying is that there's work here for<br>tangata in terms of decolonizing so I<br>might have some work to do as a parkour<br>New Zealander<br>and there's work for tangata I I and and<br>then over time there might be work for<br>us in Partnership yeah and Professor<br>Wally tour calls it as a you know Levi<br>Strauss actually one plus one equals<br>three<br>because we need to strengthen ourselves<br>first so you're yeah I would agree with<br>that um<br>okay so now to bring us these ideas back<br>to your project<br>so what did your student participants<br>say to you about their experiences here<br>at otago<br>um yeah and the promise I'm saying<br>promise of decolonizing<br>well I mean it was voluntary<br>participation so you know in recognition<br>that we may<br>have attracted students who are asking<br>for more all right<br>um and what they were reflecting on so<br>we gave them a provocation frame based<br>on the work of George sephorday and<br>including<br>aspects for students to consider about<br>takatufenua and<br>um<br>as well and and so it<br>when we worked with students we found<br>that there were aspects of their<br>knowledge where they<br>'ve and their experiences where they<br>felt strong they felt strong in<br>recognizing examples of oretitaka so<br>article 3 Equity or seeing a lack of<br>oretitaka and equity<br>they<br>they felt strongly about having their<br>identities validated<br>within this space and not always<br>experiencing that but they also<br>experienced<br>um knowledgeable at teaching and<br>learning and I think Rachel you were<br>wanting to talk a bit more about that I<br>was um when you said oriti Taco I was<br>thinking about equity and<br>um so we're not just we're talking about<br>inclusive education here and um getting<br>rid of lots of isms genderisms for a<br>start and and students seeing themselves<br>in our curriculum that we teach the<br>other thing I was thinking about came<br>when you were mentioning that is the<br>words<br>some of our students didn't actually<br>know what that meant so they had a<br>little bit of trouble answering that<br>question because that's not part of our<br>curriculum here across the university<br>and we know that because they wrote that<br>down yes in their notes and told us it<br>was in their recordings yes and we<br>listened because they were doing group<br>work and so we could walk around the<br>room and hear what they were saying but<br>yeah and the microphone picked up a lot<br>of their conversations which<br>kind of lead us to think well that's not<br>part of this place yet<br>and if we think about are we going to<br>talk about the difference between place<br>and space we will get down there I'll<br>leave that absolutely yeah yeah I mean<br>one of the things that students remarked<br>on across we had we worked with students<br>across three Wanaka so one was a zoom<br>one according to a uh on campus and um<br>consistent across all three were that<br>students do encounter Educators<br>academics who are they feel are doing<br>this work decolonizing and attempting to<br>honor<br>umari but they felt that this was often<br>in smaller papers that not many students<br>took and not many students attended even<br>though they signed up for it and so um<br>and where and they did also remark on<br>the<br>yeah and and they felt that there were<br>some tokenism another problem that<br>students identified was<br>um sometimes<br>their their Educators be it a tutor a<br>teaching fellow they didn't specify our<br>lecturer and might talk about cultural<br>competence but they're not demonstrated<br>almost sometimes in the same session<br>right so they saw contradictions but<br>they also saw what they felt was they<br>decolonizing and attempts to re<br>re-indigenize their education yeah and<br>there was a concern that where papers<br>were available that did have that<br>content that there were very small<br>numbers of students attending those so<br>there was a concern that students could<br>graduate from here without learning<br>anything about that type of information<br>so yeah that's what I mean they would<br>have that would have been great class to<br>work I mean once what somebody made a<br>comment that we um<br>we're fearful that we we live here in<br>exactly the same places when we arrived<br>when it came really hardly decolonizing<br>yeah<br>yeah I because I guess we're all<br>well we're in the education provision<br>yes uh we uh beholden to a set of<br>Professional Standards and a code of<br>professional responsibility that really<br>centered waitangi yeah<br>um so I guess we're all<br>um trying to work on ourselves as<br>members of the teaching profession in<br>that way<br>um so<br>more and more people are talking about<br>this in everyday life so I guess there's<br>a<br>there's a expectation on the part of the<br>students coming through that they will<br>be able to engage with us around these<br>kinds of questions right and that brings<br>um we're bringing out something out as<br>something else else out that is<br>sometimes these conversations are<br>difficult to have oh why absolutely and<br>so people avoid having uh difficult<br>conversation type content uh in their<br>teaching because I mean that's the skill<br>set that we need to have perhaps you<br>know training and or something is that<br>it's okay to have those kinds of hard<br>questions being asked and not shut down<br>our students want those kind of<br>conversations they were telling us in<br>their feedback as well that that's<br>really how do they learn these things<br>how do they change their thinking or<br>develop and their critical thinking and<br>critical reading uh in the in their<br>courses if they can't and I discuss<br>these kinds of things and people aren't<br>afraid it's kind of scary work but we<br>need to go there yeah come by<br>well<br>um I guess having listened to some of<br>the research data from the students now<br>seems a good time maybe to open that QR<br>code and to post that link to the QR<br>code poll question in the zoom chat so<br>the question that Kim and Rachel have<br>asked us to think about is<br>how do we feel about decolonizing and<br>re-indigenizing our places and spaces at<br>this University<br>for those of you who are tuned in let's<br>hear from you we'll come back and look<br>at the poll in a few minutes<br>and so put some thought into that<br>question if you would and we'll keep on<br>talking<br>um<br>one of the things we wanted to talk<br>about today was this idea of place and<br>space and I think Kim you've got<br>something to<br>say to us about this in terms of the<br>university and decolonizing place in<br>space so can you start by telling us<br>what you mean by that and then get into<br>it<br>yeah they are tricky um Concepts placed<br>in space and and the photo mapping part<br>of our research our students to<br>capture in photos examples around the<br>University where they could see<br>decolonization in action or<br>um<br>colonization and students felt very<br>comfortable about place<br>you know the physical<br>our textural place of the university and<br>it did have cultural narratives of this<br>place<br>although some aspects of the cultural<br>narratives were not necessarily<br>and so there were some differences in in<br>their cultural narratives<br>um but it became apparent that perhaps<br>what we were asking with the photo<br>mapping wasn't entirely clear especially<br>when we think about the space of their<br>education what they feel see<br>hear do how they act how they see<br>themselves<br>validated within within this place that<br>we call a site of Education okay<br>and so um we we talked about putting<br>provocations onto Instagram to to to<br>assist people's thoughts and one of the<br>provocations is on this screen around<br>the um questions about your reading list<br>because a reading list is a space of<br>knowledge<br>um and it's not neutral and so um we put<br>these questions up we developed the<br>questions that are oh quite common<br>critical literacy questions and we we<br>put them up and put it onto Instagram<br>and then we got<br>um students sending us<br>um things they were reading things that<br>they felt reflected diverse authors or<br>things that they felt were<br>um platforming<br>and theomori matarakumari Maori<br>perspectives<br>and things that weren't<br>and so this kind of provocation seemed<br>to work well for that photo mapping<br>aspect of our research and again helped<br>us to you know feel hopeful that there<br>are colleagues who are doing a lot of<br>Mahi in this space all right so so what<br>kinds of things did you learn from the<br>students<br>um I just want to talk about the place<br>in the space yep no so<br>if that's all right there you go<br>um so if we if we're talking in terms of<br>colonization when we think about a space<br>it's like a blank canvas so you come in<br>it's there's no history there's no<br>um yeah put on to the land or thinking<br>about this place is with its cultural<br>narratives all the the people that live<br>here already so I think<br>yeah we're not a blank canvas and I<br>think that's the biggest difference<br>between a place and a space and so<br>um some of the I think come you did a<br>great job of showing or fuel and um our<br>river which were in this building<br>actually<br>um and how that has changed over time<br>and when we've got another beautiful<br>Logan Park um just down the road there<br>and we've got another hour that goes<br>under the ground so the you know the<br>place has been changed so it's about<br>putting back our<br>stories and our students knowing about<br>this place so if we look at the clock<br>tower which is an interesting one we've<br>got students that thought that that was<br>built by a taranaki prisoners that were<br>kept here but the area the land<br>underneath was prepared and things like<br>that so we've got histories about this<br>place which our students don't know<br>about yet and so it's about for me it's<br>about putting those stories so that<br>becomes a place and not just a space<br>where our students know the um<br>of this area in this place and who is<br>monofinoa and who are the ewe that<br>import into this<br>and at the moment we yeah many of the<br>students were unable to do that so we do<br>have a little bit of work I mean I<br>forgot struggle to do some of that<br>absolutely yeah so all right<br>so what was that so what did we what did<br>we learn from yeah that's right well did<br>you have anything to share with us about<br>what you might have learned from their<br>yeah<br>um so students want to graduate<br>Global Citizens who have a critical<br>perspective and a sense of<br>giving back<br>and that and that's what they want to be<br>fostered within them during their time<br>here whether it's three years whether<br>it's longer but to be Global they need<br>to know where they are yes exactly right<br>yeah like this yeah and they also yeah<br>and place based and problem-based so<br>hence why that that you know the<br>difficult conversations having that<br>information<br>and they wanted uh yeah we've got we've<br>talked about the difficult conversations<br>but if we all talk about the um yeah<br>they want conversations about racial<br>assumptions stereotypes discrimination<br>bias tokenism you know gender and white<br>privilege you know what does that mean<br>um and they they did see that in some of<br>their<br>academics and Educators and they saw<br>that amongst themselves right as well<br>right but in an ad hoc kind of way<br>um yeah ad hoc but they you know they<br>felt within the student Community they<br>also experience discrimination and um a<br>greater need for<br>cultural awareness cultural<br>responsiveness and ethical Behavior too<br>so you know as a place of Education we<br>have a lot of money to do but there are<br>people out there already doing it and<br>interestingly some of the you know what<br>they're asking for<br>problem-based learning place-based<br>learning future focused learning for us<br>from an education field those practices<br>those philosophies have been around for<br>a very long time so we're not asking<br>they're not asking for a reinvention of<br>the wheel and you know that that gives<br>us some hope because we can look back to<br>what has been done which is high quality<br>work<br>that respects<br>um respects all involved in the learning<br>process and it exists oh yeah and very<br>cleverly wanted us to expand our views<br>of what an education who an education<br>educator is so that may mean that you've<br>got people from the community that come<br>in it's we're not just the Educators<br>here because we have a philosophy at<br>this University about creating critical<br>thinkers Etc but those critical thinkers<br>are also out in our community yeah and<br>so we need to yeah demystify the role of<br>our community as part of the university<br>and Community is integral to place based<br>yeah<br>problem-based learning<br>uh well I'm sitting here my mind's<br>willing<br>um in terms of uh<br>what could someone like me who works in<br>the University teaches students Works in<br>education studies uh<br>what these ideas might mean for me and<br>what energy or new energy I could put<br>into my teaching so I guess I'm pretty<br>Keen to hear what you think this cult<br>study might might contribute to our<br>thinking around<br>um<br>about advancing learning and teaching<br>well this I'd like to congratulate you<br>on your use of today almadi because for<br>me the key part of what does it mean for<br>us is you know as Educators is actually<br>using and our students saying to the<br>almadi being used<br>um and I think that's something that<br>you've worked on over time it's not a<br>quick fix but it's actually students<br>seeing us progress with our use of tadel<br>Maori and across spaces not just in our<br>classrooms but in wherever we are<br>wherever they meet<br>so for me it's looking at our cultural<br>markers across the university and our<br>cultural markers and our own course<br>content and<br>um so it's moving beyond like bilingual<br>headings but it's actually what Dil<br>money do we use in our sessions in any<br>curriculum area and I'm talking even<br>languages Etc so um yeah cultural<br>narratives so for us<br>um<br>is the key word that can used earlier on<br>so what Mighty content is in every<br>single session that we teach and not<br>just the Maori week as we called it a<br>before so the integrated curriculum and<br>integrated nature of our curriculum and<br>we know that our students are coming to<br>University very soon we've got a brand<br>new curriculum being created so and it's<br>called timataya so how are we including<br>that information that our students are<br>going to be coming in with how are we<br>including our fluent speakers of today<br>almadi and our whole university<br>environment how are we catering for<br>their diverse needs of our students so<br>if we're going to decolonize that space<br>we're going to see more<br>um<br>waitangi articles application of our<br>articles so that we know what to do and<br>we are ready for our students that are<br>coming from our new new educational<br>environments yeah I think that's quite a<br>good<br>um pointer for me in terms of<br>thinking about two treaty principles as<br>soon as you start talking about<br>so as soon as we start talking<br>matarakamari this is where it gets a bit<br>um difficult for me yes right because I<br>don't want to appropriate knowledges<br>that aren't mine to appropriate but they<br>kind of are because I am tangaturity and<br>I've lived here forever so you know<br>um I think maybe starting big at that<br>principal level might feel like a safer<br>way to to proceed<br>and I know that in the education system<br>all told where timatayahu is rolling out<br>this is a big question around the place<br>of matarakamari and how we upskill our<br>teachers Early Childhood through primary<br>and secondary school and let alone here<br>in tertiary studies right<br>um yeah so I think<br>I thank you for coming to 3D principles<br>there probably to elevate my thinking<br>deal with my anxiety a little bit about<br>recolonizing that which I sh which I<br>need not to and that's where<br>um that's probably why we asked<br>everybody the question about how do you<br>feel<br>about this you know implementing this<br>you just remember that because<br>um<br>I think we'll get the people behind the<br>scenes might be able to put something up<br>um on the screen<br>uh<br>okay so I guess<br>um<br>let's have a look at some of those<br>responses uh Kim and Rachel<br>um what since can you see what sense can<br>yeah<br>I obligations expectations<br>um and I'm looking at uh International<br>staff<br>embrace you know there's<br>for those who wish to learn real Maori<br>and panel film universities needs to<br>encourage yeah<br>um I know that I can speak from College<br>of Education I know that we feel that's<br>really important so we have a course<br>that fits in will people work in peers<br>they fit it fits in with their working<br>day<br>so often we're really busy as you know<br>as Educators we don't often have time to<br>go to that extra course at the weekend<br>or at night so I know that with paitata<br>that we've been thinking about how to<br>what does this look like then what I was<br>going to suggest that classes that are<br>available at different times for the<br>almadi and also for staff as soon as you<br>come in to this University then to you<br>know what a framework that says if we're<br>going to be titiriti led then new staff<br>coming into this environment need to<br>know what that might be what that might<br>look like all right all right and from<br>this question here about how can we help<br>people who are coming in with no support<br>and guidance I really want to put on the<br>table what is it the ionization of<br>tangaturity relations and really to<br>think about what it means to be<br>tangaturity I mean this is a yeah three<br>years ago or never have never have<br>talked about that<br>um as a as a identity category as a as a<br>way to think about partnership so I<br>think we could do a lot of work there<br>that's for sure yeah all right and I'm<br>loving that we're down the bottom there<br>I can see I'm talking about the feeling<br>uh exciting all right so for me<br>um if you're<br>yeah if we're looking it's got to be<br>hopeful all right so you can't it can be<br>quite disheartening in a sense sometimes<br>if you don't have that sense of hope or<br>ways of working you know proud as<br>another one I'm looking at the emotions<br>here as well and even our College even<br>our emotions have been colonized so<br>we're taught to be happy and I've did<br>some research and it's our education<br>fault really that we've been teaching<br>students about well-being and feeling<br>okay all the time and but we haven't<br>been talking about the hard stuff and<br>the valid emotions of anger and<br>um feeling upset and despair and you<br>know which can colonization has caused a<br>lot of that trauma we should say<br>something I'm reading in yeah some of<br>these comments<br>it is sort of I guess a sense of<br>isolation and I think there is the ways<br>for it are collective<br>um and I think that when we<br>we do need to look at our professional<br>development<br>perhaps we need to look outside of the<br>university to take models from elsewhere<br>such as communities of Learners as a<br>professional development model as as<br>opposed to again the one-off workshop or<br>the three three hours of the<br>introduction<br>waitangi which is meant with the best<br>intentions but will not turn you into a<br>uh imagine imagine if you could just<br>Wanaka if there was just a space that<br>was just forever ongoing and when you<br>came up when I came across um crikey I<br>don't know what to do in this situation<br>that there was a a group a place a space<br>where we could just have that<br>conversation on an as needed basis just<br>in time learning right yeah you need it<br>when you need it and so yeah and I think<br>that would help with being brave that's<br>another way of looking at that sort of<br>information to take that step<br>um and once you have those conversations<br>that can give you a sense of belonging a<br>where you are learning and in this<br>together it makes you<br>um yeah do more I think yeah<br>um I'm thinking you ask the students in<br>your study a question like this how does<br>the how does decolonization make you<br>feel for the indigenizing<br>um can you see any kind of connection<br>between what the people who are watching<br>are saying and what your students said<br>to you you can see the same<br>um<br>compulsion to learn yeah because that's<br>for me that's really reassuring and not<br>wanting to diminish the sense of<br>frustration that's other other<br>colleagues here are feeling<br>um but but also that people feel this<br>need to learn no and um that's what we<br>got from the students and I'm loving the<br>sense of urgency yeah with this as well<br>yeah but also now we've got a framework<br>where that can be actioned so the<br>university is kind of at that stage now<br>yes through and vision 2014 2014.<br>there's kind of our documents are now<br>giving us a framework we didn't have<br>that before but now we have but it's the<br>actioning and the way with that well<br>there's going to be perhaps the hard<br>stuff so I'm just going to read out a<br>couple of them<br>get a finish of what they had so um<br>hopeful uplifted appreciative discomfort<br>disappointed frustration<br>sadness happy validated and valued and<br>excited so yeah that's why I picked out<br>some of those words that we could see so<br>our students are feeling a little bit<br>like some of you are feeling which is um<br>lovely to be able to see and I'm just<br>gonna this a student said it's good that<br>we have the study which shows strong<br>presence of colonization that affects<br>and harms Maori Pacifica lgbtq Plus in<br>other groups need to have other advocacy<br>and structures which dismantles these<br>discriminatory structures which is<br>awesome isn't it<br>so they're wanting those conversations<br>so they can unpack it so they can notice<br>it I think noticing is a very good<br>behavior to him as well because if it's<br>habitual you often don't notice yeah<br>what's around<br>um it seems to me that<br>um a big part of the decolonizing<br>re-indigenizing kaupapa is about<br>partnership<br>and I know paitata is advocating<br>partnership approaches to research with<br>monofinoa<br>um so what did you learn about doing<br>partnership based research through this<br>project that might help inform that<br>Vision well<br>um<br>I mean we worked in Partnership from I<br>from from the offset and it was about us<br>having quite honest conversations with<br>that one another<br>um<br>if we felt something needed to be uh<br>also Advanced having that and having<br>those conversations and justifying it<br>was actually quite straightforward for<br>us because I think we come from an<br>environment where you work as a team<br>um and<br>um we we approached it with a sense of<br>humility that we could both got things<br>to gain from this process<br>um and so I think Honesty right humility<br>and<br>um constant cut it all I you cannot<br>underestimate how valuable a quick<br>conversation can be cup of tea and lunch<br>you can have those conversations that<br>you were saying that we often miss out<br>on because we're too busy so it's making<br>uh those times available because that's<br>where the huge learning can happen and<br>you can say it in a safe space so for me<br>one of our key ideas was a Wanaka<br>approach that this is a safe place for<br>you to express<br>as part of Maori values how you are<br>feeling without being afraid that you're<br>going to do something wrong yeah so if<br>we look over blown away at how much<br>students told one another as strangers<br>you know given that we invited students<br>in into the research and we started with<br>and then the kai and sharing of Kai just<br>put them at ease and they good they'd<br>already grouped themselves so not with<br>people they knew people they'd never met<br>and they were having these very personal<br>very emotional conversations and a<br>willingness to be open with one another<br>and we feel an enormous amount of<br>responsibility from<br>hearing their voices creating this with<br>with the team creating this audience for<br>their voices and now our responsibility<br>is to enact I mean something like this<br>but it is a long-term project of course<br>and I think there's a slide here<br>so brings it into reality yeah yeah so<br>it's kind of like when we're talking<br>about all these emotions<br>so that um we need to validate our ones<br>that are feeling uncomfortable feelings<br>and uh can we talk about a pedagogy of<br>discomfort there's a lot of information<br>and it says a good thing<br>so we have to prepare ourselves for that<br>and it's not a quick fix hence why would<br>I was<br>um looking at that long-term time-wise<br>it's not something that's going to be an<br>instant uh action it's a it's an action<br>over time perhaps and if you're looking<br>at that screen there you've got to have<br>a little bit of comfort with I love that<br>but uncertainty<br>um you've got to have discernment and<br>patience<br>and a little bit of humor doesn't go<br>amiss<br>about the ups and downs that we will<br>have in this journey and when we<br>decolonize this space<br>I know that as a Maori academic member<br>that when we bring out documents like<br>paitata Etc or you know changes and<br>names that we're we're sent an email<br>saying if there's anything there's any<br>discomfort or any concerns that are<br>affecting you through conversations that<br>are head around this University please<br>make contact because we take this<br>seriously so yeah as Marty we do take<br>this seriously as these other way we<br>need to move forward so in that sense of<br>that partnership it would be quite nice<br>on that journey to not have to have that<br>statement being said to us<br>that that is just part of the usual way<br>we move forward and work together not<br>something unusual or different but just<br>the way who we are so for that to happen<br>you've got to have stamina you've got to<br>not be overwhelmed<br>um but maintain that excitement for the<br>seeking of success and know that change<br>can happen because when it stays the<br>same it's not exciting I think it's we<br>talked about this before the corridor<br>today and it's about anticipating that<br>we might not see the end of the journey<br>no because you know as we move forwards<br>as a motto what decolonization<br>modification remodification<br>reindigenization will look like will<br>evolve and you know it's accepting that<br>it you know for our careers and thus far<br>I have<br>Endeavor to be a critical<br>pedagogist my whole teaching career and<br>I'm still not there and it's it's it's<br>about constantly reflecting and<br>evaluating and having those difficult<br>conversations about your own practice<br>and then having them amongst the umida<br>well come Rachel thanks for bringing<br>this um celt quarter or two fruition<br>um I think it's probably time for a bit<br>of q a I'm sure folk here in the room uh<br>might want to have some comments and<br>questions and there are some questions<br>coming in from online as well so we've<br>got a few minutes to uh have a bit of a<br>conversation so um we have some runners<br>in the room here with microphones so<br>please don't if you've got a question<br>wait till you get the microphone so that<br>people who are online can hear you<br>um and I guess let's open the floor for<br>discussion<br>okay I have a question online not<br>something I prepared earlier I promise<br>um so this is about keeping the<br>conversation going how can interested<br>people keep the corridor on this topic<br>going Beyond this forum Beyond this<br>cultural<br>and it's very good question<br>um<br>I don't do things I mean I would I would<br>flick that over to hcdc actually because<br>that is part of their role but not<br>necessarily I mean I think that there<br>have to be informal<br>collectives that can move this forward<br>because when you were talking about<br>as and when you need it sometimes those<br>more informal mechanisms are<br>more Nimble I I am in terms of their<br>organization yeah I think we have enough<br>communication systems within this<br>University that anybody who would like<br>to join that group could put something<br>out there and ask and the staff<br>Communications about who would like to<br>come and get together and I know these<br>are a lovely deal Maori group that meet<br>there's lots of care you know in Cafe so<br>why not like you were you mentioned this<br>already actually as a solution a cafe of<br>where you get together and and have<br>these kinds of conversations about what<br>to do but um yeah also I like your<br>suggestion there come because yeah<br>higher education than hcdc these courses<br>where those kinds of things could be<br>part of the content<br>I know that this cultural capability<br>in the pipeline courses that are coming<br>available in our critique of that was<br>just to make sure that we have<br>our own conversations as part of those<br>cultural capability courses so I think<br>the conversations can continue like that<br>and I'm sure those conversations will<br>continue because we're going to be a<br>titi-led university then you can't avoid<br>that to me I and I guess they have to<br>come from multiple directions right so<br>people on courses but people in programs<br>but people and departments and in<br>divisions and I so it's got to come from<br>from both directions and our students<br>are very good at getting together<br>and making their own you know Societies<br>or whatever groups so they get together<br>themselves so um why can't we do that<br>and I think there needs to be more space<br>for student voice and in this because<br>it's it's a fair point how can we<br>continue this court at all but the<br>question is should we be having this<br>coordinate or exclusively as Educators<br>and staff without<br>it's an awesome way of beginning<br>because that's the other side of the<br>um so anyone in the room any questions<br>wait for that microphone<br>uh thank you very much very<br>thought-provoking it's question uh from<br>three very wise<br>um<br>very sincere I really really enjoyed<br>that and I think it's we're all<br>grappling with these challenges it's so<br>great to hear the student voice coming<br>through yeah um today I'm not sure what<br>my question is entirely but<br>I guess I would like to ask the three of<br>you how are you envisage things if we<br>use the markers of 2030 and 2040 that<br>we've sort of sit down as an institution<br>how do you see things with the lens that<br>we've been looking through today in<br>terms of decolonization you know how<br>maybe you can answer it in terms of how<br>you see your teaching in 2030 or 2040 I<br>like the the idea I think it was Rachel<br>sort of said about<br>it's not just me being the expert<br>anymore I'm bringing this person in from<br>the community and they're speaking on<br>this<br>thing<br>um as Kim knows you know in my own work<br>one of my things I will bang on about is<br>half of our research outputs literally<br>have a padlock on them so that<br>people in the community can't access it<br>what is it so what does this mean<br>looking ahead into the future you know<br>how maybe you can put your roast into<br>Spectacles on and that's possibly or or<br>be as blunt as you like but so what what<br>does the future look like well I don't<br>need to put my rose tender glasses on uh<br>Richard and I don't need to even<br>envisage<br>10 7 or 17 years hence although that<br>will be where my moko are here and I<br>would expect they will have expectations<br>of everybody but I already work uh well<br>the colleague we have we made a<br>commitment to each other about three<br>years ago that we would teach together<br>foreign<br>and so<br>um despite the fact that that being a<br>more of an encumbrance perhaps on<br>workload models and stuff we actually<br>front up the classes together<br>we teach side by side uh we Wanaka<br>mostly our classes are smaller that's<br>easier to do in that particular class<br>but<br>um<br>I've done that here I did that at the<br>University of Canterbury as well<br>with my Maori colleague in the education<br>department there<br>and we're just that our teaching that<br>way despite what the institution<br>expected<br>so I think<br>um<br>that's what I'd like to see more of but<br>we need to have systems in this place to<br>account for that so that people can feel<br>like they can commit to that kind of um<br>partnership approach to teaching of I've<br>I've benefited from it immensely it's<br>been extraordinary<br>yeah<br>I know I'm probably the same I actually<br>really enjoy working with someone else<br>hence working with come in I taught to<br>Del Mari at Canterbury University to<br>national teacher education students<br>there and we always talked together and<br>we worked around like you said worked<br>around the system so if the system is<br>not working for you<br>then you can be creative within the<br>system<br>so hence that's a start it would be nice<br>if we didn't have to keep doing that but<br>I think that's a really good way I don't<br>know whether it's answering your 10 or<br>30 years<br>that's actually a topic that I ask on my<br>course what will it look like what does<br>a tea tree tea or waitangi partnership<br>and relationship look like for you and<br>what would that look like in the future<br>and because it's not around us it's<br>actually a really hard question because<br>they can't Envision thing because we<br>haven't seen it because of colonization<br>so actually picturing that is a really<br>tricky thing and I think that's<br>something that we're going to have to<br>Grapple with for me it's easy for me<br>it's actually rakatera taka and working<br>towards what the titiritio or waitaki<br>waitangi<br>waitangi partnership should look like<br>and if I worked towards that that's um<br>we have that in our legislation then for<br>me if that's what it was envisaged to be<br>that's what I'm hoping that teaching<br>will look like and I do get disappointed<br>if it doesn't<br>so yeah I mean this is a resilient model<br>of Education it's been around hundreds<br>of years and<br>um<br>as Rachel says it is hard to re to<br>reimagine it but for me<br>future focused education<br>doesn't necessarily take place here you<br>know in a room for 50 minutes or an hour<br>and 50.<br>um it it can take place<br>within the community and but there are<br>you know we have to be conscious of<br>capacities within communities but<br>um there is also moving at a pace of<br>partnership rather than the pace of what<br>somebody the most powerful wants<br>um so I think it is about moving away<br>from the structures that constrain<br>people<br>and and recognizing that there are all<br>people skilled as Educators and always<br>have been<br>um you know we're quite good at<br>reproducing ourselves but it doesn't<br>need to be that way and that learning is<br>problem-based is Place based and does<br>Foster a a sense of<br>citizenship not for<br>self-improvement but for Collective<br>Improvement and that that's where I<br>would be going<br>as far as runaka involvement just one<br>word of caution we are a small number of<br>people who are working incredibly hard<br>so that's why we need<br>actually to support and do and work with<br>that information and share what we have<br>but not without<br>engagement with drunaka first so that'll<br>be the the key note that I will finish<br>off I see we're nearly there I I yeah<br>look it it does look like we're coming<br>to time so I think we will um we will<br>draw a line under it there<br>um I'd like to thank you both Rachel and<br>Kim for your thoughts and your<br>provocations<br>from this research<br>um thank you to the audiences both here<br>in the room and online<br>um for your for your thoughts and<br>questions your comments<br>um I'd also like to thank the committee<br>for advancement of learning and teaching<br>for supporting this cultural series<br>funding your project too of course<br>um and as well as the media<br>production unit for their work with us<br>today getting us ready and their great<br>job and helping us helping bring this<br>all together I think it's only fitting<br>to finish with a whakatoki because we<br>are in this for the Long Haul um whanau<br>and I think I'll just finish with<br>Matthew while<br>come here</p></main><footer style="margin-top: 2rem; background: #0001; padding: 2rem; text-align: center;"><p>We Are The
