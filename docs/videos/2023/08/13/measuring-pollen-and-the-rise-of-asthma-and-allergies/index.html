font-size: 0.8em">Transcripts may be automatically generated and may not be 100% accurate.</p><p>um so the idea of This research came<br>about about 18 months to two years ago I<br>was talking to one of few of my<br>colleagues based in Australia uh we were<br>talking about allergies eye allergies in<br>particular<br>um and they have multiple sites where<br>they have these traps<br>um however in New Zealand at the time I<br>didn't know that there are no traps<br>pulling traps available so initially we<br>we thought okay let's look at the what's<br>happening to the eyes so I look at us<br>inflammatory cells that are in the eye<br>when their allergies there was allergies<br>so we came together I think a timing of<br>the research was around late 2021 I was<br>looking at what causes or has led to<br>asthma attacks within New Zealand and<br>Poland is one of the um data points that<br>we're wanting to look at and again<br>that's when I realized that New Zealand<br>doesn't actually have its own pollen<br>data stream the process each week is we<br>have to make sure that we change the<br>pollen sample on time because each time<br>the sampler only lasts for seven days so<br>it's really important that we can<br>capture the pollen within that week and<br>change it on time so every Tuesday<br>morning before 9 30 we have to make sure<br>that we get to the pollen sampler on the<br>roof and change out the pollen trapping<br>tape so that we can replace it with a<br>new one just to make sure that the<br>pollen that we get doesn't adhere over<br>the previous week's pollen otherwise we<br>lose all that valuable data<br>um the job<br>Museum roof because this was the exact<br>location<br>of 1988 Poland Shop collection when it<br>was done for a few months six months as<br>I remember<br>um so we thought it'll be fitting to<br>um just do it at the same location and<br>see how Poland has changed over the<br>decades at this point and it needs to be<br>the location needs to be the site needs<br>to be at certain height and not<br>surrounded by building so we need to and<br>this is an ideal Place talking Museum<br>roof so yeah<br>um the analysis of Poland can be really<br>useful in understanding not just the<br>pollen count but of course overall<br>health<br>um so as I mentioned what there is over<br>the decades the Poland timing the season<br>timing has changed the severity of this<br>Poland has changed speaking for an<br>asthma point of view so our recent work<br>we know that asthma attack rates are<br>increasing in New Zealand and that is<br>something that I'm particularly<br>concerned about we know in the last<br>decade we have seen about a third<br>increase in asthma attacks and<br>particularly large increases in our<br>Mario and Pacific communities and we<br>think with climate change and we have<br>seen that with the flooding and the<br>changes in temperature for example that<br>these changes have changed the types of<br>pollen that we see and the types of<br>plants and material that are around<br>Auckland and New Zealand area and I<br>think that could definitely have an pet<br>on people's allergies and that is<br>something that we really want to find<br>out with this pollen collaboration with</p></main><footer style="margin-top: 2rem;
