to meaning<br>to name<br>um<br>EMC for today we've got Athena tahana<br>Clark and Dr Rebecca Kittle and our<br>other two speakers today<br>also to colleagues from The Faculty of<br>Lawley University members of the public<br>here all in the Overflow room or via<br>streaming or watching in the future<br>wider colleagues and final of Professor<br>the recipient of the 2022 University of<br>otago distinguished research medal the<br>highest honor that we bestow annually<br>welcome<br>um I've written first apologies from our<br>acting Vice Chancellor Professor Helen<br>Nicholson although it looks like it<br>wouldn't have been a seat forward anyway<br>with the attendance with God who I know<br>would have loved to have been here today<br>uh had schedules permitted but it is<br>traditional for the deputy Vice<br>Chancellor for research to officiate at<br>the drn uh middle lecture as it is the<br>DBC research that chairs the panel that<br>makes the selection<br>my role therefore is to tell you a<br>little bit about the award before I hand<br>over to Professor Andrew ekatoni as the<br>chair of co-chair of tepo Tama Maori to<br>more formally uh introduce Professor to<br>you all<br>um plan and should you all agree by<br>acclimation at the end and<br>I will also have the privilege of<br>formally presenting you the middle and<br>after some acknowledgments from your<br>Dean uh Professor Shelley Griffiths<br>so for the distinguished research medal<br>our given that you're on the faculty of<br>law we better go to the regulations they<br>state that the recipient will be chosen<br>for their outstanding research<br>achievements sustained contributions to<br>the research environment<br>impact on the academic disciplines and<br>or communities with which the research<br>has been engaged and serviced of the<br>University<br>outstanding research achievement can<br>include the discovery and dissemination<br>of new knowledge<br>or the development of Concepts that lead<br>to significant advances<br>sustained contributions to the research<br>environment can include leadership of<br>significant National and or<br>International research activities<br>sustained a mentorship or development of<br>researchers and outstanding service to<br>Emi government industry and other<br>Community Partners<br>impact can include the adoption of<br>research findings in disciplinary<br>thinking uptake of research and policy<br>industry eweek and other community<br>settings or implementation of research<br>by practitioners of the field<br>service might include how your work has<br>supported the University's guiding<br>principles including honoring the treaty<br>partnership sustainability social<br>responsibility academic freedom I say<br>all of those things because I'm sure<br>that many of you will know and we will<br>see today that professori has left all<br>of those attributes at the highest<br>standard so is the most Discerning<br>recipient<br>the middle also comes with an invitation<br>to present a public lecture Hawaii which<br>is why we're here today and a modest<br>brand to support research related<br>activities of the recipient and I think<br>there are some posters and other other<br>collateral around us that jacinta has<br>applied some of that modest ground<br>funding<br>so um as a major award unlike others<br>like let's say the Nobel Prize we are up<br>to three Awards can be made in any one<br>discipline in any one year we have to<br>select one recipient across all of the<br>disciplines from from the University<br>um<br>where we have to balance overall career<br>long scholarly and Community achievement<br>with discrete world-changing discoveries<br>that are often sufficient for some of<br>those<br>scale of the exercise into context we<br>have about 1600 academic staff at the<br>University who again are eligible for<br>nomination<br>and we've been making this award since<br>about 2004 so there's about 60 to 20<br>people in this very exclusive Club<br>representing about one percent of our<br>Academy<br>consider also that to be appointed to an<br>academic or research position at the<br>University of otago that's also highly<br>selected we typically create more than<br>100 applicants for any one position<br>another one the same selection and<br>finally even gaining the academic<br>qualifications to be eligible for a<br>naked in a position is about another<br>further one percent exercise although I<br>should note if they didn't have to put<br>into Dunedin New Zealand's smartest City<br>about two percent of the population are<br>PhD qualified<br>hints we are here to recognize the one<br>percent of the one percent of the one<br>percent so jacinta today you are<br>officially the smartest person in New<br>Zealand smartest and most beautiful city<br>so on behalf of the University uh please<br>accept our congratulations on being our<br>now you've

wearing<br>a great honor for me to introduce<br>um<br>it's such a privilege to be here I'm a<br>proper intimidated usually I'm<br>interviewing politicians and people that<br>don't really know a lot about the Treaty<br>so<br>quite rich and I came down from Auckland<br>last month people said where are you<br>going I said I'm going to Dunedin they<br>said gosh why I said well um this very<br>brainy Professor is getting a very flash<br>award<br>um so I just want to acknowledge<br>um uh jacinta's parents and whanau<br>because it must be a thrill watching<br>their daughter received these

the<br>other academics in this room<br>you you lend us your expert expertise to<br>legitimize things that we know<br>instinctively and that we know uh<br>represents the value of matora namali<br>you know you you do the hard yards you<br>put it all together you pull it together<br>you develop a body of research which is<br>then utilized by activists and and<br>policy makers communities and and<br>journalists and and people that really<br>want to make a difference so thank you<br>for all of your Achievers and and this<br>achievements represented in this room<br>I just I just have to mention that she's<br>quite an organizer so she's got this<br>whole thing lemon and look she's got a<br>ticking bloody Clocky<br>I don't know mess so it's just you know<br>it doesn't mean you're being amazed I'm<br>just gonna flower here<br>um but I just want to begin by teasing<br>out the importance of Maori research<br>okay so you you'll push for a bilingual<br>bicultural Legacy and that aligns with<br>activity or wait I mean obligation so<br>you're an advocate for a by Jewel legal<br>education uh that's the first time I've<br>heard that word when I read that that<br>reaffirms the existence of two<br>legitimate forms of law which I as a law<br>student who graduated last century<br>struggled to even find Regional so could<br>I ask you where your starting point is<br>do you start at the Maori<br>how do you approach things<br>um<br>we're enjoy walking here at the heat of<br>like pocatapu with beautiful mountains<br>and the forests and knowing that it was<br>the night at home glaze but not seeing<br>these stories their<br>um the importance of that place to go to<br>her which was like the whole it's the<br>whole Center to the whole economic<br>resource but in Idaho with the PO namu<br>and so on so I don't know I've seen a<br>lot of gifts and missed opportunities<br>from a really young age and it carried<br>on into my into my education coming<br>through<br>well all of high school actually I<br>really do read Miranda and fifth form<br>which my daughter Ariana's sitting here<br>um is what is it what is it now yeah<br>yeah now year 11 will be fifth forms it<br>was the first time I had read a Maori<br>author and that was looking for minor<br>and then Patricia Grace and so<br>and that moment has really stayed with<br>me so I've been always trying to find<br>and place myself in that talmadi<br>perspective and to bring that<br>perspective with me and all of my<br>studies and all of my approaches to life<br>because as you said in your experience<br>of going through law school we didn't<br>really feature in the law curriculum<br>um and even though we've got our final<br>stories of disposition from lands that's<br>a deliberate use of that colonial law<br>from or from an authorous and don't<br>cover from the 1860s onwards and they<br>are very important part of who we are<br>and how our contestation with the<br>aotearo and New Zealand legal system<br>and that didn't appear in the curriculum<br>and so I don't know I've been surrounded<br>by incredible amazing people and seeing<br>those opportunities for change has been<br>easy because there's so much to do<br>so I remember the very first Holiness<br>lawyer Bowie Joe Williams and I drove<br>down from Auckland and we're kind of<br>talking about I<br>was going to be one of those radical<br>things within my life totally disrupt<br>the system transform it or are we going<br>to Brown it up so we didn't know what<br>was going to happen so we got to that<br>meeting<br>oh lots of debate looked like it was<br>going to Brown up and uh so I I didn't I<br>didn't go back<br>um so I I went and did something else<br>but<br>um there's quite a big decision to<br>decide where to place yourself within a<br>system that has you know institutionally<br>and historically being antagonistic<br>towards Maori so how did you how did you<br>decide where you place yourself and just<br>stay inside it<br>thank you for recognizing that because<br>of his thing it is very very hard and it<br>continues to be very hard for Maori<br>um right from the beginning we've got<br>this amazing 10 opened by kutaki um so<br>Kristin Maynard an amazing Maori um law<br>student back in 1993 from Nancy<br>came and set up a board for us as Maori<br>law students and that's what I kind of<br>fell into in my arms you know wrapped<br>around to this beautiful group of Maori<br>students and we would go to yeah we<br>would get in the like the shuttle van it<br>would drive from here like all the way<br>up to kitty kitty door it was mostly<br>just a group of women in the van and<br>we'd be arguing and looking all sorts of<br>Dramas taking place<br>but you know it was so formative in<br>those experiences of crossing the theory<br>and staying at<br>um the title profile putaki alumni who<br>had graduated a year or two before us<br>and so<br>I I've come into something that had<br>already been created and really felt<br>that that warmth in that support I was<br>very lucky in the appointment<br>um it was Professor Richard Sutton who<br>appointed me into the law faculty role<br>and recognized I was on my own as a<br>Maori scholar and the law faculty and he<br>buried deliberately gave me about the<br>first six weeks of my job this kind of I<br>don't know to me it felt like an<br>unlimited budget um to really get with<br>this deliberate attitude to travel<br>around all the other law schools and<br>spend time with the Maori Law School<br>Scholars there and so I just had lots of<br>opportunities to be weaved into that<br>fabric of Maori supports<br>Society was already up and running by<br>the time I came through law schools<br>always really appreciative of the you're<br>such a young thing aren't you now the<br>first time and last time I was with<br>jacinta was at the Auckland writers<br>festival and so I've curated four<br>sessions and I thought well the most<br>radical piece of writing that emerged a<br>couple of years ago was here poipua it<br>was written in in a couple of months and<br>it generated a huge uproar and some of<br>the worst reviews I've ever seen One<br>reviewer from papakura said it was<br>separatism by stealth that was Judith<br>Collins<br>another reviewer actually it wasn't<br>Richard parkour Slam in it there was a<br>reviewer a Napoli one who used the words<br>a palace coup by the Maori caucus<br>leading to an ethno state that was a<br>a food reviewer slammed it as a<br>deliberate plan to create a separatist<br>Peters<br>the critics slam people were putting the<br>rest of us thought what what an end is<br>in this thing was uh it was slam for its<br>pernicious pathways<br>but<br>didn't just pop out of anywhere<br>uh how did the body of existing Maori<br>research and form their report<br>as significantly so we talk all about<br>drivers for hip hop which was a group of<br>nine of us<br>um five Maori four Pacquiao some of the<br>some of them were government officials<br>that were on there was it challenging<br>that part<br>not amazing everyone on there was<br>absolutely committed and amazing to see<br>something<br>um incredible that we could do for our<br>Theodore particularly leading into 2040<br>the 200th year of assignment to a<br>waitangi and how we could take the<br>drivers from all that incredible work at<br>the waitangi Tribune or all the amazing<br>work of Maori Scholars over you know<br>decades and decades you know since the<br>signing of tearsaletia white onion<br>particularly the ewe leaders for the<br>commitment interconstitutional change<br>with one a Jackson and Margaret tomato<br>and the designing of mountains a few<br>years before so<br>um it's all the submissions into<br>government we went through<br>um you know all the aspirations also<br>maybe we could change our country so<br>could I just ask you to clarify what was<br>the what was the point what was the goal<br>what was the vision the vision was and<br>this was deliberately given to us by the<br>minister of Maori Affairs at the time<br>was to create<br>um to create a pathway the start of a<br>plan for how aotearo and New Zealand<br>could become compliant with the United<br>Nations Declaration of the rights of<br>indigenous peoples and titanicia<br>waitangi at that time when we came<br>together in 2019 was it we were supposed<br>to come out as the first in the world to<br>create an action plan for our country to<br>actually start to put into realization<br>something that we'd already committed<br>ourselves to internationally with that<br>United Nations declaration the rights of<br>indigenous peoples Canada has now met us<br>to it they did US quite quickly after<br>that<br>so were you surprised at the response<br>yeah we were frustrated<br>um that the whole thing became<br>politicized it also caught up we<br>finished that work we were given about<br>10 weeks it was all on top of our day<br>jobs I'm looking at my Dean here<br>and so it was an incredible amount of<br>work that we did on over a very short<br>period of time it was supposed to be<br>released at White honey day in that<br>February of 2020 covert was starting to<br>build up and then it got caught up on<br>Covert it never then got released<br>properly and and so it became a<br>political news really which is a real<br>shame because it is a road map we took<br>all the indicators that was that were<br>already sitting within government around<br>how we could move in the next 18 months<br>to two years to five years 10 years and<br>take us through to 2040. they're amazing<br>initiatives in the year around but one<br>of them was wouldn't that be neat for us<br>as a country to be able to really know<br>that Ewing boundaries are where we live<br>and how we move from one takiwa one<br>lucky one area into another one that we<br>know that where we are living where we<br>are residing<br>um and I thought well we thought you<br>know there was a lot of incredible and<br>uh as part of here for the real image of<br>the airport was starting off with these<br>um Spears and recognizing that there's<br>this big sphere of karawanatana where<br>the colonial government the crown today<br>dominates in making all of our decisions<br>for us here in Antioch New Zealand so<br>that's our covenant Hemisphere and<br>there's a really tiny little red dot<br>foreign<br>and then there's this growing sphere<br>where a joint management where we are<br>coming together for decision making is<br>still very small and the idea was to<br>shift those images of those spheres to<br>2040 where we have a decreased<br>carwanatanosphere and an increased<br>1010mosphere<br>trying to<br>achieve something that our ancestors<br>committed to back in 1840. So what's the<br>relationship between here puapua and<br>matikumbai very close relationship we've<br>built on that so matakimai is incredible<br>work from 2015 by Moana Jackson Margaret<br>Mutu the Constitutional change it was<br>work that they um spent years and years<br>traveling around Old Head Island New<br>Zealand I think it was like over 350 Hui<br>engagements and that document marketing<br>my six out six options for<br>constitutional change royalty at all in<br>New Zealand so six different ways we can<br>grow that tinodana sphere<br>um yeah and so we we took that whole<br>idea and then tried to put together a<br>it's interesting isn't it because you<br>hear talk about people going we need a<br>national debate around the treaty uh or<br>co-government or something uh we've been<br>having it right since forever you know<br>but so you set up these these models<br>um I mean when I listen to you talk and<br>and the work that's been done I just<br>think how often and it's kind of<br>reflected in<br>um in one of your um books here too is<br>that the the use of imagination and<br>creativity and dreaming isn't really<br>encouraged a lot there's a lot of kind<br>of<br>you know this is the Counterpoint this<br>is the positive Counterpoint like Martin<br>mine here they imagine a different way<br>of doing things aren't they<br>they do it I think<br>um being Maori being on them that eye I<br>think is always those opportunities to<br>to rethink to reimagine and to know that<br>we can do things better and Auntie at<br>all we can create more respectful<br>relationships that are going to be<br>inspiring and amazing for all of us as a<br>country and I truly believe that is I<br>think that's what particularly as I'm<br>looking around at many of my colleagues<br>there's potomamadi Ahmadi epidemic staff<br>caucus I mean that's what excites us<br>that's what we talk about all the times<br>around how we can build on our ancestral<br>knowledge to create pathway sport that<br>are going to really<br>we're really going to make this country<br>make sense for all of us<br>so it must be challenging to keep your<br>optimism up<br>because she's a perky type isn't she<br>honestly I mean you know why don't you<br>just I mean yeah I believe you<br>so I'd like to just pick up on Arnold's<br>comments and talk about the importance<br>of environmental legal research<br>um to transform environmental laws so<br>National Parks from two foot into I've<br>got a sort of a bit of an interest in<br>that just tell me why you started to<br>focus on that earlier on well I think<br>that comes back to growing up and going<br>walking dead and you know my dad<br>speaking many times you know up there in<br>those parks and that's how we grow up<br>and I love being in those places as well<br>and I came into<br>um my law job in 1999 and I was told I<br>needed to do a masters of law I didn't<br>really know what that was and I think<br>well I need to do it on National Parks<br>because I want to spend time in National<br>Parks I didn't really happen but I and<br>would also the year before the nighttime<br>had just been elected and it's the most<br>incredible statute for recognizing the<br>night at home relationship with the<br>mountains and the rivers and the lanes<br>and to me that was a real Catalyst<br>moment for thinking right we can now do<br>something and the conservation Act of<br>1987 is a section four that that<br>explicitly states that the Department of<br>Conservation must give effect to the<br>principles of the Treaty of waitangi if<br>there is that mandatory commitment to<br>give effects to the Treaty of waitangi<br>that had already been in place for more<br>than 10 years when I came into this<br>topic of wanting to write to my Master's<br>thesis and I hadn't really seen that<br>significant change take place in the<br>department of conservation other than<br>the treaty settlements that will come<br>and throw and that's still the case now<br>we're now like 40 years on we would<br>think that the Department of<br>Conservation was being managed in like a<br>biocultural by lingual<br>um way and it's and it's not and so I<br>found that quite astounding that you can<br>have this legal commitment but then it<br>can be watered down and I really wanted<br>to understand how<br>our treaty could have been watered down<br>when there was such a strong commitment<br>to it and legislation and so that was my<br>Master's thesis and it was really<br>exploring what we were going to give<br>effects to tier to be killed waitangi<br>what would our national parks look like<br>and then that led me on to do my PhD<br>which continued that whole examination<br>of<br>reimagining the national parks<br>from an indigenous perspective and took<br>me to Canada and working with<br>hallucinations peoples in their national<br>parks as well Anthony just out of<br>curiosity ever many pieces of<br>legislation now which have that nothing<br>in this act the way inconsistent with<br>the principles yeah it's a whole raft of<br>our legislation across<br>Health transport environment all now<br>require decision makers to have some<br>level of regard to titolito but that<br>strongest<br>the strongest direction is still in that<br>1987 conservation act to give effect to<br>there is no way to work around that<br>decision makers are told they must give<br>effect to it the principles of the<br>Treaty of whitening but still it's being<br>watered down consistently through policy<br>and Court decisions because is it isn't<br>it that that we're principles that's a<br>problem<br>part of the problem yeah and I think<br>also it comes back to how far our courts<br>wish to go how far our department of<br>conservation wish to go in in realizing<br>the opportunities to recognize the<br>practice of General in the places I've<br>been also interested in the national<br>parks is it's a third of our country so<br>these places really matter it's the<br>third of the lands of aotearo in New<br>Zealand among there our mountains our uh<br>they are encased Within These National<br>Park boundaries and people like in<br>Canada the First Nations who are to talk<br>to where they've been excluded from<br>their ancestral lands they'll talk about<br>um they're being this like this glass<br>this whole glass Corridor put up that<br>they could see into those ladies but<br>they couldn't actually go into them they<br>couldn't practice who they were and it's<br>very similar to here<br>how did your interest then move to Maori<br>rights to the water<br>um<br>that was a deliberate conversation with<br>tedron Idaho<br>um back in the 2000s<br>um I don't know wish there and I don't<br>even see it uh watching more work to be<br>done with rights to freshwater<br>responsibilities to freshwater<br>particularly following a lot of the<br>resource management case law and so some<br>of the work that I did then was I<br>examined all the cases where Maori had<br>to take an Acclaim through to like the<br>environment Court we might be were<br>arguing this for example a commercial<br>developer<br>for farmers irrigators<br>how to hold Harvey whether they're<br>wanting to<br>hello to put stuff into water or take<br>things out of water so I looked at all<br>of those cases and Maori were<br>consistently even though the courts<br>would recognize Maori arguments they<br>were always being what they called<br>balanced doubt by other consumers in the<br>resource management act and it was it<br>was very convincing and looking at like<br>a case study of about 25 of those cases<br>I think Maori only once two of those<br>cases and they were just a tiny tiny<br>little bookcases that would fundamentals<br>of another Clinton anyway and so why are<br>Maori consistently losing in the port to<br>emalia always there arguing<br>perspectives and the resource management<br>act requires decision makers to have<br>regards to not just the treaty but also<br>kaitiakitana and to the recognition that<br>our waters are in surrounding a tongue<br>so how can we have that legislative<br>framework and still have decision making<br>that's working against Martin<br>because people think Nadia are<br>stakeholders yeah it's just to be<br>consulted yeah yeah so the recognition<br>of Owen and manga having a legal<br>personality was quite groundbreaking<br>um could you explain to me<br>the the nuances around that<br>so this is some of the work that came<br>out of my PhD and drawing on other<br>people's work as well I was thinking<br>about how can we move forward as a<br>country<br>um we might when we've got that we're at<br>loggerheads around ownership the crown<br>wants ownership Maori want to ownership<br>and so it developed a kind of this kind<br>of Mesquite team scale Spectrum around<br>if we're going to recognize actually<br>we would be embracing my audio ownership<br>but also recognizing that the crown is<br>not going to go there and then create<br>all these bottom lines for you we win<br>their own Treaty of white honey<br>negotiations<br>and one of those bottom lines is like<br>Department of Conservation Lanes cannot<br>be returned to England<br>Waters cannot be rivers lakes cannot be<br>owned by Maori their own you know so<br>there's all this kind of legal stuff<br>that you've got to work through and so<br>trying to think of well what some other<br>options and so drawing on um Christopher<br>Stone a professor in the US in the 1970s<br>he worked with scottries extending and<br>then the U.S perspective he was thinking<br>about if we can give our trees our rocks<br>um our forests standing in the court if<br>they can have their own legal<br>personality and their own legal<br>representation then we can ensure a<br>voice for nature and I was interested in<br>that and thinking about it in a Maori<br>context I wasn't interested in<br>necessarily a voice for nature but I was<br>interested in how that<br>however it's coincides with the Maori<br>world view that we already see the<br>leaves and Waters alive they already are<br>our ancestors so if we could think about<br>using a concept of legal personality<br>that's already used in law and it's used<br>in a more of a commercial kind of<br>context companies can have legal<br>personality so it's something that the<br>legal system was already familiar with<br>can we take that idea put it to the<br>environment but make it make sense<br>Ramadan perspectives<br>and so on they developed that into their<br>treaty settlements but it's because I<br>don't know if it's necessarily where<br>they would have went to first it's the<br>crown<br>the crown endorsed it because it<br>neutralized the ownership of sheep<br>um and so it's it's the crown<br>accepted it because we're now saying<br>that okay the crown doesn't Target we're<br>just gonna hit this middle ground and it<br>goes so would there have been a way to<br>resolve the proportion thing yeah<br>absolutely in the portion of seabed that<br>was a real moment in my career I'd only<br>just started in 2001 that the case the<br>court of appeal case came out in 2003 so<br>it was only a few years into my career<br>it was a hard time it was such a hard<br>time being married being married at the<br>University here seeing the country react<br>to a court of court of appeal decision<br>in that way was heartbreaking for us in<br>the huge lost opportunity that we missed<br>as as new zealanders to know the<br>manafinoa of our area to you know it was<br>never about stopping new zealanders from<br>going to the beach it was an appalling<br>part of our political history and how<br>politicized it was you know the<br>government was producing or they've<br>still got them these policy documents of<br>young white kids not being able to be on<br>the beach that they're not going to get<br>access to the beach it was as it was all<br>being profiled that Marty were going to<br>be stopping people from existing the<br>beach and that's not even the definition<br>of the portal CB the portion of seabeds<br>that laid this either permanently or<br>temporarily under salt water so that's<br>elections are very triggering for Maori<br>if you don't know that and we're heading<br>into it again just mentioned Law and<br>Order about 10 million times and you'll<br>be right so you'll see that this award<br>here will open up even more avenues for<br>the country and the university sectors<br>to understand and value<br>um that that what Maori research has to<br>offer this country I mean you you're<br>representing a lot of that yourself to<br>deal with crises what what kinds of<br>crises do you think Marty research can<br>address and how uh a whole lot all of it<br>so so in terms of the climate crisis the<br>biodiversity crisis our Mental Health<br>crisis our poverty crisis the<br>homelessness crisis all of that primary<br>descriptive is interconnected it's it's<br>all stemming from this disconnection<br>from us from us as humans from the land<br>and when you have unwellness in the land<br>you're going to have unwellness in the<br>people it's all interconnected and I<br>think Maori research can really show<br>that came really powerfully demonstrate<br>that interconnection until we get that<br>connection<br>worked out and we're going to continue<br>on having these crises one after the<br>other and I'm looking around this<br>amazing Maori researchers in this room<br>and throughout the whole country that<br>have so much to offer this country and<br>tools of solutions going forward and we<br>just need to be braver numbers our<br>country to really listen and hear what<br>our Maori researchers are saying and<br>it's echoed in indigenous networks<br>overseas and caused two very familiar<br>to come to the stage and she's going to<br>discuss with us how jacinda's research<br>has influence the development of the law<br>and the courts<br>Athena is a former law student of<br>jacintas and Pastor by puttake<br>otago's Maori all students group she's a<br>current<br>otago representative on dehuino Maori of<br>aotearo a former research assistant of<br>jacintas and now a lawyer at Anderson<br>Lloyd and part of the team that<br>represented rocoa in high court and<br>Supreme Court cases that in part relied<br>on jacinta's Research in 2022 no my<br>ademai afina<br>um<br>thank you Moana for that lovely<br>introduction that makes me sound a lot<br>more impressive than I feel like I am<br>um thank you all social center for the<br>opportunity to speak it was amazing<br>amazing occasion celebrating Body<br>Research<br>I first met jacinta is as a law student<br>at otago<br>and there weren't many modern<br>researchers at the time that we had<br>assigned readings from and it was very<br>refreshing to see<br>a mighty voice in The Lord of gray at<br>the time which wasn't a huge amount of<br>time ago<br>um I've been had the opportunity to work<br>with jacinta in my senior years working<br>on some of that Resource Management law<br>after looking at her historic Maori<br>customer intake and considering how<br>resource measure of legislation<br>should be amended to reflect the treaty<br>more<br>and during that time I was able to get<br>first-hand knowledge of as we all see<br>today the genuine passion that jacinta<br>has for pushing the law in a direction<br>that<br>that was mighty<br>and outer lower New Zealand is a whole<br>but it was really in my transition from<br>a law student to a lawyer where I truly<br>saw the benefit of the Maori voice in<br>the Maori voice can help um explain why<br>Tiffany is relevant<br>how it is relevant the principles that<br>are relevant<br>and the weights that can be placed on<br>those individual brands<br>Maori research in writing now Underpants<br>many submissions made to the court<br>by lawyers who summed which are<br>qualified some<br>not So Much<br>by way of a specific example which is<br>provided an affidavit for my colleagues<br>and I on a judicial review proceeding<br>which was coincidentally brought by the<br>I think the first point that came out of<br>that was that was and speaking with<br>jacinta and piatta my colleagues and I<br>quickly realized that our approach to<br>how we practice law actually needed to<br>change<br>they wanted to fulfill one affidavit<br>from the both of them if you're joined<br>every day but as opposed to two<br>individual which<br>we told you sometimesa was unusual and<br>not how things were supposed to be done<br>and they came right back at us and said<br>no that's like an individual affidavit<br>is not how it's supposed to be done your<br>role<br>and I think that helped us understand<br>that<br>according to<br>is<br>a tonga that should be shared by many<br>not held by one<br>and emphasize the importance of joint<br>responsibilities for the research<br>content that we have today<br>and this speaks to the fact that the<br>work currently being done doesn't just<br>reform the law itself but also how we<br>practice the law<br>the content that they created with that<br>joint affidavit commented on how<br>specific aspects of taking are applied<br>in the judicial review proceedings and<br>built on evidence provided by our<br>counselor<br>they work provided guidance through the<br>high court and then the Supreme Court in<br>the appeal and both judgments were<br>informed by the researchers just under<br>amakyata had done and referred to their<br>lawyers are increasingly leaning on Body<br>Research to inform arguments to the<br>court as I said some of us are qualified<br>and some of us are not<br>um over time there will be a cognitive<br>shift that's already started and that is<br>occurring in how the courts apply to<br>care and then that will follow through<br>to Parliament hopefully<br>the affidavit was also considered by the<br>law commission and its work to examine<br>how tipanga is expressed in the courts<br>so in providing the evidence for us just<br>entering the how to have actively helped<br>him preserve the Integrity of TK number<br>which ultimately is our goal in<br>presenting this country still cool<br>it also helps implant its place in<br>Australia's legal landscape<br>it's invaluable and ensuring that the<br>knowledge is accessible to all within<br>the legal system from law students all<br>the way through to Supreme Court judges<br>jacinta's commitment to furthering the<br>law has encouraged and is by me<br>personally from my time in law school<br>through here today<br>the school was very well researched to<br>Center<br>foreign<br>must be lovely when you see your<br>students come through<br>they pop up out the other room and then<br>focused and fabulous oh it's one of the<br>most amazing parts of the job like being<br>an academic is one of the most I just<br>think it's just incredible and one of<br>the most amazing things is that you're<br>part of a student lives and we've got<br>Library students here and other law<br>students here as well and that you're<br>seeing them at that real transformative<br>moment in their lives where they're<br>coming into a study of law that I don't<br>really know if it's for them where it's<br>going to take them and yeah you're part<br>of their lives and you continue to be<br>part of their lives and their careers as<br>they go forward out into the adult world<br>and so yeah it's an amazing job<br>seeing like a FEMA and what she's<br>achieved in name on the um you know on<br>the court proceedings for the Supreme<br>Court like that's like a real coveted<br>position to be as a lawyer and she's<br>already made that only a few years out<br>into her career it's really cool well<br>she had a pretty flesh Professor the<br>anxiety man I sort of think of a couple<br>of professors that were at Auckland uni<br>when I was I went through I'm always<br>emailing them and<br>them picking their brains so um yeah big<br>shout out to all their professors<br>in terms of the importance of Maori<br>research to um to the nation now at<br>and that's really I know it's a very<br>significant but could you explain to us<br>the role of that organizational entity<br>yeah so now is the New Zealand commodity<br>Center of research Excellence it was<br>established back in 2002 by Linda wa<br>Smith and Michael Walker and at the time<br>there was only less than 10 was it 10 I<br>can't remember the 2002. about 10<br>centers of research Excellence across<br>the whole country and that was that<br>incredible Vision back there in the<br>early 2000s that of course one of these<br>centers should be a Maori Center of<br>research Excellence where all the<br>scientists Health scientists in<br>particular were really bidding or that<br>that position that kudos to be a center<br>of research Excellence rotary at all of<br>New Zealand and Linda and Michael and<br>all those who work with them<br>um<br>and their whole Vision was so convincing<br>and so needed for Auntie and I in New<br>Zealand they were successful and since<br>then pretty much every Maori researcher<br>across the country has benefited from<br>his<br>um it has had this huge vision of<br>knowing that it has to build up the<br>infrastructure of the tertiary context<br>we have to like back then Linda Wai<br>Smith will talk about it was probably<br>about<br>um five or six Maori who were principal<br>investigators of researchers we talk<br>about them being able to all squeeze<br>into like one of those red telephone<br>boxes and so we had to build up the huge<br>infrastructure of<br>um you know the phds the Masters PhD<br>students coming through to build the<br>journals and the whole peer review<br>system and we're going to publish our<br>work we had to build all those<br>International connections so this<br>enormous amount of work began in Arizona<br>2012 by now<br>and all of us as Maori researchers have<br>benefited enormously from what's being<br>achieved and I was really fortunate<br>um to be part of the rebuilding process<br>because once you have a center of<br>research Excellence you don't have it<br>forever every six years or so you have<br>to convince the government that they<br>need to reinvest into your senior and<br>then at that time lots of other groups<br>across the country are also saying but<br>hang on my group is really important I<br>need to be a center of research<br>Excellence so it's a big it's a big<br>um academic battle<br>at the highest order really<br>um and now High has come through a<br>number of those big birds and I was one<br>of them back in 2005.<br>and yeah incredible opportunity to be<br>able to know well Maori research across<br>the country and across all the<br>disciplines and see the influence that<br>we're having as Maori across the whole<br>spectrum of research was an incredible<br>incredible opportunity are they all<br>so yeah we've got co-directors so from<br>two different universities as a<br>university of Auckland University of<br>otago when I was there now it's now that<br>co-hosting is between the University of<br>Auckland and University of waikato<br>um but it's a group so now<br>incorporates all of the universities the<br>eight universities across a number of<br>the crown research entities around<br>research institutes ewe research groups<br>for big museums Tim Papa and the<br>Auckland Museum today also do a lot of<br>research there so this big coming<br>together with 21 partners of you know<br>these three entities all working towards<br>bringing together their Maori<br>researchers to inspire and build the<br>networks for our Maori students to<br>succeed in the tertiary context and<br>that's the really neat thing about a<br>center of research Excellence is that it<br>is fixated on building the capability<br>and capacity of researchers and so we're<br>able to really invest in and Inspire our<br>next generation of students to come<br>research and knowledge yeah so very<br>closely so all of our Maori researchers<br>are embedded in Maori communities just<br>naturally and who they are and what they<br>wish to achieve and like authors like<br>you know it would be similar to tell you<br>why Smith who wrote decolonizing<br>methodologies is like our blueprint for<br>how we do research and she you know and<br>what she says entirely makes sense to us<br>but we must do research that is useful<br>to our Maori communities and so<br>everything that we are doing is working<br>with Maori communities<br>for Maori communities<br>um<br>so in this beautiful book here which you<br>think thankfully gave me last night<br>which I missed<br>um<br>during its release but it's just<br>stunning in in the ends<br>which is I guess<br>um co-authored by many academics who<br>talk about their experience in the<br>various institutions<br>um and often very isolating<br>um how is<br>um now play supported them or this how<br>does it helped transform their kind of<br>experience well it's given us that<br>connect work and so while I've got two<br>amazing Maori colleagues now for 20<br>years of my career as the lonely only<br>Maori and I look around at many of our<br>Maori academics and really still are the<br>lonely only Maori in their academic and<br>so nanpai helps gives us that place to<br>come together nationally and to support<br>and Inspire one another and so this<br>particular book here which is a<br>beautiful book invested um<br>and to the Royal Society<br>enabled us to bring together the stories<br>of about 20 Maori researchers across a<br>whole range of disciplines you know like<br>zoology ecology quizx<br>economics history so the whole a whole<br>range of<br>um disciplines at the University sector<br>and to demonstrate incredible success<br>that audio achieving even though they<br>don't have within their departments the<br>infrastructure all the support<br>necessarily for them to succeed as Maori<br>those departments will have the support<br>for them to success to succeed as for<br>example a legal scholar but not as a<br>Maori legal scholar or a Maori<br>geographer and so on and so we asked our<br>Maori researchers to like talk from the<br>heart share with us what it is that is<br>inspiring you to stay in Academia to<br>continue to research and what is it that<br>you are trying to achieve with your<br>research and it's this incredible<br>celebration of what can happen when we<br>do Embrace Maori Scholars within the<br>tertiary sector do you have like an<br>annual Hui where you get everybody<br>together<br>yes we do and um I mean covert has kind<br>of um<br>interrupted that over the last few years<br>but even just this morning or what is<br>happening in this room today is can we<br>quote on us over Maori academic staff<br>caucus from Accra which includes Maori<br>epidemics across this Dunedin campus but<br>also University of otago Campus of<br>Christchurch and Wellington to be able<br>to all come together so that's at an<br>otago scale and the Navajo de Mayo<br>Antonio makes that happen across the<br>whole country and we do we come together<br>and we have conferences we had fun I<br>know right eye we host a big<br>International Conference every two years<br>that bring in the incredible indigenous<br>Scholars from overseas<br>what's a particular piece in here that<br>um oh wow I need to speak to any one of<br>these stories I'm looking at Anne-Marie<br>who's sitting over here who's profiled<br>really beautifully<br>um in this book we've got more who's our<br>Super Famous New Zealander now there's<br>so many people in there whose faces are<br>recognized but still half of them I<br>don't and I celebrate there because it's<br>just so amazing just seeing all these<br>different people I really love Jane<br>kitson and her story I'm down there in<br>invercargill I'm working in you know<br>ecology and so on and how she's really<br>tried to bring forward a night of her<br>perspective into her discipline and the<br>Sciences<br>um yeah look this and Marie<br>uh yeah this is so nice it's a beautiful<br>it's a beautiful book and it is an<br>optimistic book Because as I said before<br>people talk about reimagining and<br>dreaming transformational stuff so<br>um the other thing that I was I was<br>really Blown Away by and I and I looked<br>at the that stand thing downstairs with<br>all the different box sizes<br>which is a an extraordinary collection<br>of work which represents<br>150 books<br>um stunning books I was counting them<br>trying to figure out how many more I<br>needed to buy to get the whole lot which<br>um could you I mean were you surprised<br>at how many amazing books are out there<br>yeah<br>but again at the University of Auckland<br>17 and and weeks of the first time<br>formerly Now power to matamatanga was<br>hosting the governors the directors of<br>the Royal Society which were about to<br>leader to the 150th celebrations and so<br>we're looking to do something together<br>and kind of naively say oh how about we<br>just got together a selection of Maori<br>books and we can celebrate it and one of<br>the one of the motivating purposes for<br>that is that we were hearing<br>um sort of comments that oh Marty are<br>new to writing Maori are just new to<br>research and so on we're going well hang<br>on you know Maori have been writing for<br>over 200 years in the English language<br>so incredibly accessible to everyone in<br>New Zealand how come we don't know about<br>these books um as new zealanders as<br>Maori these are very much well-loved<br>books<br>um and so we that whole initiative came<br>together to bring together 150 Maori<br>books and we continue to do incredible<br>celebrations<br>um around Titania one of our greatest<br>passions is around these boxes and we<br>are working now with the Publishers of<br>New Zealand around republishing a lot of<br>these books that are out of print so<br>over about the next 24 months you're<br>going to see incredible packages coming<br>out from the Publishers of some of these<br>books that have been really hard to find<br>and accessible for a long time and we've<br>created we're going to give away a<br>couple of creators and this incredible<br>quiz so it's 150 questions that lead<br>into each of these books and look at a<br>couple of giveaways can you be on my<br>team because you can get mercified<br>but do you like wandering oh no this is<br>so we are very deliberate around this<br>this is just an entry into all the<br>incredible Maori work that exists out<br>there it's just the sample and you need<br>to know this work and you need to know<br>all of the work of Maori that's been<br>going over you know for 200 years of<br>Maori writing we are going to this as a<br>list that ran from the that ended up<br>into tweet at the end of 2017 and so<br>we're going to release the next five<br>years another Tweety box we're still Mr<br>Angela won hello originally we've had<br>her and I still kind of debating exactly<br>which books are going to go on it's<br>obviously it's very contestable you know<br>once um do go through a peer review<br>process but we still have people run up<br>or email us and say why wasn't our book<br>on that list now<br>um of course well I think it's just<br>fantastic I just absolutely love it and<br>it's wonderful seeing a lot of those<br>books particularly a lot of the older<br>ones I've never seen before on display<br>downstairs now you're also on the boards<br>of Tijuana<br>so you're kind of a busy person<br>um these institutions provide other<br>significant spaces too don't they for<br>um to grow research and on that note I'd<br>like to invite Dr Rebecca kiddle as a<br>director of new Maori researcher at one<br>on<br>just say a few words<br>um and before I introduce you properly<br>just advise you that at two o'clock we<br>will host a local launch of Tijuana<br>Research Center<br>um<br>so<br>um Rebecca<br>is<br>the director of the research center at<br>Tijuana she has a background in Urban<br>Design and Maori idea to she holds a<br>milestone Grant title making all two at<br>all places the politics and practice of<br>urban Maori Place making she's also a<br>member of<br>matanga where um Becky and Jacinda first<br>week when Rebecca was designing a very<br>cool board game<br>oh I want this decolonizing the city<br>um<br>thank you for this um honor of speaking<br>today is<br>um auspicious occasion<br>um unfortunately that board game cost<br>about 500 a pop to make so we haven't<br>rolled it out yet<br>we've been waiting for a bit more<br>funding but we will come to you first<br>one and once we go<br>um so I'm is is one has already seen I'm<br>the director of to Manoa a new rangaho<br>center to Juan Manuela I first knew of<br>jacinta's work when I was working in<br>Environmental Studies at Victoria<br>University<br>um and her seminal work really provided<br>the inspiration for my teaching as I<br>taught on a postgraduate program uh<br>entitled Maori resource management at<br>the time and her articles really became<br>key reading for the students a new media<br>interviews offered a really<br>um easy into some quite complex kopaka<br>um around things like personhood that<br>we've already talked about today and why<br>um and I would use one interview of<br>who's with rnz on the thorny issue of<br>who owns water is the basis of a class<br>debate to get students thinking<br>critically about Maori rights totidity<br>and Resource Management so thank you<br>jacinta for um for that teaching<br>material<br>um so so her work has been influential<br>across the country in classrooms across<br>the country<br>as an early career Maori researcher I<br>remember it may senior centers has<br>already been seeed through now<br>and was immediately struck by her<br>generosity and supporting my own<br>research aspirations and people have<br>mentioned this earlier but I really want<br>to acknowledge your support of young<br>Maori academics of all of all<br>supporting this board game that<br>originally was<br>entitled The decolonizer but we felt<br>like that might be too there not too um<br>worrying for people<br>um<br>now apply for which Jacinto was the<br>previous director has been an important<br>Catalyst for many of us if not all Maori<br>researchers across the country has<br>already been stated<br>um and the great thing about napai is it<br>transcends those institutional<br>boundaries that we're often stuck in<br>profiling Maori research happening<br>across the country and drawing together<br>like Minds to support in total commodity<br>research and mighty researchers located<br>in sometimes quite hostile mainstream<br>environments<br>book which actually includes one of my<br>team Dr Morty who McDonald<br>um<br>was really drawn from again jacinta's<br>desire to to promote the work of Maori<br>researchers across the country<br>her own research doesn't resile from<br>difficult and contentious issues as<br>we've already heard rather she works to<br>Forefront Maori understandings Maori<br>writes and push for justice for thymo<br>haponili and Maori communities across<br>the country and that kind of leadership<br>is the is the leadership that those of<br>us coming up behind are really grateful<br>for<br>um<br>we all know that Maori researchers<br>across the country<br>in the academy are often lumbered with<br>triple labor and what I mean by AAA that<br>labor is having to be expert in our<br>disciplines uh needing to push for real<br>change for our people<br>and being the knower of all things<br>Mighty for Pacquiao<br>and jacinta has traveled that difficult<br>in tiring Road deeply<br>uh finally her desire to see the<br>acknowledgment and value of Maori ways<br>of knowing is being critical and a shift<br>in thinking that has led us to lead to<br>the creation of a number of Maori<br>collectives across the country including<br>to Manuela hokura and there's some from<br>the team here today and and others from<br>the waimana<br>so we're really pleased to come and<br>celebrate with you to Center<br>three of your children want to pop up in<br>say something about your mom I mean you<br>know you've done some research on here<br>yeah but you can meditate on that you<br>can meditate about it<br>um so<br>It's a Wonderful celebration it's very<br>uplifting to come along here and hear<br>about because she's actually a lovely<br>person too hey you know like you can get<br>all these brainy clever people and then<br>you think oh I don't really want to hang<br>out with you much but she's the kind of<br>person that you want to hang out with in<br>fact I went to dinner with them last<br>night with all these Brady people all<br>these professors they're all quite<br>normal that's what I like it's not it's<br>lovely and you know we're dealing with<br>big big issues here so just to conclude<br>um I want you to save the world but<br>before that<br>um I something that struck me in some of<br>the work that I've done I did a um a<br>documentary series called the<br>negotiators and we looked at uh seven<br>key treaty settlements Through The Eyes<br>of keep negotiators like tatipano Reagan<br>and Sir Michael um Cullen and there was<br>this lovely lovely part<br>um and 1990 Queen Elizabeth came up to<br>waitangi and I hope a bunch of us<br>um were again<br>anyway<br>um I always remember Reverend<br>um or Bishop whakawihui Virgo you know<br>he was talking away and we were all<br>trying to drown him out and then he kind<br>of Switched and he he was just really<br>and then the Queen the queen said and I<br>I would like to do the Queenie Voice who<br>said<br>uh we are strong enough and honest<br>enough to learn the lessons of the last<br>150 years and to admit that the treaty<br>has been imperfectly observed<br>what an amazing statement imperfectly<br>observed a little bit of an<br>understatement<br>still fabulous<br>fabulous now you've suggested that<br>aotearoa has reached a maturity where it<br>is ready to undertake the transformation<br>necessary to restructure governance to<br>realize<br>there now opening their hearts and Minds<br>to like a loving a book like this so<br>learning material to um<br>learning where to<br>embracing more of who we are as Maori<br>and what it means for us as a country I<br>could see a real shift happening across<br>the country in it I really believe this<br>is our greatest hope we've got some<br>really good structural systemic change<br>that has happened we've got the country<br>now committed to Timon or DIY<br>we've got the country we've got the<br>whole um conservation program now as<br>recognizing te thail like Department of<br>Conservation here's this whole motto is<br>you know thriving papatula and we've got<br>some real significant shift that has<br>happened and we just need to follow up<br>behind that really strongly with this<br>enormous wealth of knowledge of what it<br>means to be Maori and what we can<br>contribute to this country and you know<br>I I think we're ready I just can really<br>see it I just um there's this quote that<br>sits in this book and it comes from the<br>late Michael Walker and he wrote this<br>quote I'll read it to you in a moment<br>but he he wrote this back in 1975 and it<br>was an introduction to an Incredible<br>Book<br>the world moves on three months were<br>familiar with that form it's a great<br>book so Michael King writing the<br>introduction to that book was a<br>collection of Maori writers for Park<br>years with a little previous contact<br>with Maori Tango new educational<br>opportunities have with the<br>establishment of Institutions such as<br>Urban Mara and Polynesian radio stations<br>present an opportunity to participate in<br>what one writer has called a<br>psychologically Rich culture from work<br>for more than one or worked for 100<br>years Europeans have taken nothing but a<br>few placements and a great deal of<br>plunder and so that was written back in<br>1975 and while I would probably say the<br>10 years ago I hadn't seen much change I<br>think we have seen change now and we<br>have to build on that and we just have<br>to<br>um keep going in terms of celebrating te<br>awami and what it means to go onto a<br>Mirai and I think if we can get more new<br>zealanders on tomorrow they will just<br>see the incredible opportunity at the<br>beginning of this year we took our<br>260 law students onto otako madai for<br>over 50 of them it was their first time<br>going on to emirai and at the end and<br>now you know always remember this male<br>students standing up in tears and saying<br>I never knew it would be like this or no<br>matter this has changed my whole outlook<br>I've been so welcomed here this day and<br>it was just an incredible moment and the<br>more moments we can get like that are<br>going to change our country<br>okay so should we just we should just<br>block out all the all the the noise<br>which is come you know coming at us and<br>hold on to that so where are you going<br>to focus your energies now because<br>you've done a few things here<br>what's left to do<br>oh the big thing that we've been working<br>on is the recognition of our first law<br>stikama as part as as the first laws of<br>aotearo in New Zealand and therefore<br>what does that mean for how we teach law<br>and how we practice law and out here at<br>all in New Zealand and we've created<br>some real structural change there uh<br>governing Council that sets the legal<br>curriculum has agreed from 2025 it will<br>be compulsory and all of the sex law<br>schools across the country to teach<br>tikanga as the first law of Ontario in<br>New Zealand you know that's a huge<br>significant shift and um you know and so<br>yeah there's still a lot to do when I go<br>back to the heart of those national<br>parks there's still an enormous amount<br>to do with the year I still see beam<br>encased in a very or mostly you know<br>still a monolingual monocultural huge<br>carowanatanosphere operating over those<br>national parks so there's still a lot<br>more to do<br>and how we care for our mountains and<br>our rivers and the more that we can<br>bring our people into caring for those<br>mountains and rivers the more um healthy<br>and well we can always as a country<br>so<br>um we're nearly at the end of our<br>celebration I'm going to invite<br>um your dad more on to say a couple of<br>weeks no I'm just going to go over to<br>you too and<br>um but there's two book giveaways<br>so this is the book where you look under<br>your seat<br>and if you've got a little sticker then<br>you're a winner if you haven't that's<br>I'm gonna have to move her out of this<br>goal and signature another school<br>so that's been the whole life<br>with the movement to the other school<br>didn't help<br>yes<br>um so I think you just sent it for all<br>your beautiful work I think we better<br>it's time for a while to isn't it okay<br>that's where you block pop up links uh<br>let's sing a song this is one we might<br>all know and I'm going to let you know<br>that something else happens after this<br>okay<br>so useless<br>yeah let's sing poor DNA okay we know<br>their mother what Gusto okay<br>foreign<br>and if you don't know it's 150 years<br>first I want to thank Moana for coming<br>and honoring deceptive today and<br>honoring us<br>for those of us for a certain age<br>as part of a soundtrack of our lives<br>and today's I got to
