not be 100% accurate.</p><p>and thank you for attending my<br>presentation at this conference I've<br>been watching this morning and it's a<br>very big uh speakers to be following<br>after<br>um so my presentation is titled hakiroto<br>hakiwajo<br>uh which I'm using now breathing breathe<br>out<br>um and it's about our bicultural kidneys<br>experiences implementing hemapuna to<br>tamati<br>images<br>uh so my<br>um I'm very close to finishing my<br>Master's thesis I hope it's currently<br>um in there I'm just checking the<br>references list so<br>um hopefully I'll submit it in a week or<br>two<br>um and this is a basic sort of overview<br>of what I've been learning<br>um and how it's worked within our Center<br>so<br>um my research is centered around<br>answering the question how can kayako<br>utilize himapuna to promote emotional<br>competence and two to five year olds in<br>a bicultural ECE setting<br>um I answered this question<br>by using the self-assessment tool in<br>himapuna alongside interviews a pld team<br>Hui and a 10-week focus on emotional<br>competence<br>This research occurred in a kindy with<br>the pseudonym to Monaco<br>used throughout<br>um this presentation covers just a<br>little of this journey and it was kind<br>of hard to decide which parts to share<br>so I've gone back to himal Puna to guide<br>this<br>so how does this uh relate to uh talks<br>about tafariki<br>um<br>Builds on the strong Foundation set by<br>tofariki it was created to work with our<br>established curriculum and makes it<br>straightforward to follow and<br>incorporate into the Mahi we are already<br>doing<br>it can be seen as a way in which<br>tafariki continues to evolve<br>herban Puna supports both emotional and<br>social competence however my research<br>focused on the emotional section<br>the document was made to dip in and out<br>of and supports kaiko in a range of<br>behaviors<br>the self-assessment tool in the back<br>allows teams to assess where they<br>currently sit in terms of Social and<br>emotional competence and for my research<br>the participants completed the emotional<br>section of this at the start of the<br>research We've Ended some interviews<br>and then 10 weeks of focus and then we<br>um though all kindergartens were<br>supplied with copies of humapuna I<br>couldn't find research around how often<br>it is used and how it is used<br>um and I can only assume from my<br>experience<br>incentives I've worked at that at times<br>we've struggled to find the time and<br>expertise to really dive into this even<br>though we know it's incredible and it<br>holds<br>um so much knowledge it can be hard<br>amongst our other commitments to make<br>sure we are honoring this document<br>um so my my goal over time is to find<br>ways to support my team in the teams of<br>my cluster to to be able to use the<br>learnings of homapuna um easily<br>so what is emotional competence<br>um hamar Puna defines this as including<br>understanding what we are feeling and<br>why we are feeling it as well as<br>appreciating how others may be feeling<br>and the impact of our actions on them<br>it also includes responding to our<br>feelings and expressing them<br>appropriately and when the feelings are<br>strong or difficult to manage in ways<br>that can help us calm down and feel<br>better<br>um and the document breaks us down into<br>the following three sections which I<br>will go through<br>so the first section looks at<br>supporting children to understand<br>Express and regulate their emotions so<br>through understanding and expressing<br>expressing their emotions tamariki are<br>then able to start to regulate them<br>so hamar Puna talks about<br>self-regulation is the ability to<br>control our feelings thoughts and<br>behaviors so this is shown in things<br>like impulse control problem solving and<br>perseverance<br>um and Springer's book The<br>socio-emotional Learning in the brain<br>they show that the only way we can<br>access this emotional brain is through<br>self-awareness<br>so they looked at an example about anger<br>um so if people become if we become<br>angry a reactive brain releases cortisol<br>the stress hormone and we go into fight<br>or flight response<br>if we are able to be a bit more aware<br>that we're starting to feel angry or<br>that something might be triggering us<br>we're better able to then redirect these<br>feelings so<br>because if we're aware of how we feel<br>our reactions can move from that<br>amygdala response to the prefrontal<br>cortex and we can think a bit more about<br>how we react and not just blindly go for<br>it<br>um<br>this is why supporting tamariki to<br>understand Express and regulate can make<br>such a huge difference<br>um and Siegel and Bryson's book the<br>whole brain child they used two models<br>to explain these ideas so a lot of you<br>may have seen<br>um these so the upstairs and downstairs<br>brain shows that if we come our initial<br>downstairs or limbic region by thinking<br>about how we feel we can move upstairs<br>to our prefrontal cortex and use a bit<br>more awareness in how we react<br>um the flip your lib model shows that<br>the prefrontal cortex at the top can be<br>overridden by our lumbric system in<br>times of stress so if the limbic system<br>reacts and it flips the lid<br>um<br>so being able to deal with all this<br>emotional stuff through emotional<br>regulation means tamariki are less<br>distracted and more able to focus<br>concentrate and succeed<br>the second part of hermaphroa's<br>emotional section is helping children<br>build resilience in a sense of<br>self-worth<br>um so this relates to dealing with<br>emotion difficult emotions and difficult<br>circumstances<br>some turmeriki have obviously a very<br>different environmental conditions to<br>each other which can kind of tip the<br>balance of how they are able to to cope<br>and research shows that resilience<br>enables people to protect themselves and<br>cope with change in order to maintain<br>their emotional balance<br>goes on to State their confident<br>children with good self-esteem are more<br>resilient and able to manage their<br>emotions because they expect to be able<br>to cope and succeed<br>so when tamariki have that knowledge<br>that kaiko Cinema is capable they can<br>take on new challenges with resiliency<br>and research shows that a resilient an<br>environment that can build resiliency<br>includes<br>free play Risk trust a sense of<br>belonging where Tomodachi are able to be<br>seen as capable incompetent<br>the last section is providing positive<br>guidance during heightened emotions so<br>as we all know at kindergarten and for<br>ourselves<br>times all the strategies and plans in<br>place are not enough to prevent tamariki<br>getting into emotionally heightened<br>States in fact Hema Puna reiterates that<br>getting into these levels is natural and<br>without it many learning opportunities<br>could be lost<br>stating emotions are natural and<br>necessary and always an opportunity to<br>highlights the importance of knowing<br>kamariki and the factors that may<br>trigger their strong emotions<br>the resource reminds kaiko that during<br>the peak of Behavioral challenges isn't<br>the time to step in I'm sure you've all<br>um been in these these experiences and<br>that that is a time to wait and support<br>strategies to prevent the behavior<br>escalating can be taught later and it's<br>important to keep in mind that teacher<br>responses in such situations are<br>grounded in maintaining the manner of<br>the child preserving the trust<br>relationship and supporting the child to<br>um so the next three slides we'll look<br>at how how that kind of basis of<br>hermaphuna<br>um was used and what came through in the<br>research<br>so for nongatanga relationships form a<br>really large part of tafariki and to<br>mapuna and the existing research around<br>supporting emotional competence<br>um with this quote from McLaughlin it<br>I'll ask any teacher in early childhood<br>and they will tell you that<br>relationships are at the heart of their<br>pedagogy<br>the importance of relationships was seen<br>in both phase one and two of the<br>interviews though the depths of how<br>these relationships promoted emotional<br>competence increased over the 10 weeks<br>um the findings showed that the better<br>we know<br>the more we can support them and the<br>more we can have confidence in their own<br>abilities to cope without us<br>um phase two also showed the importance<br>of two kind of Tina relationships with<br>participants talking a lot about how<br>pameliki were then able to support<br>um to support each other and their<br>emotional competence<br>uh the next part is intentional teaching<br>so this is the second big theme<br>um over the 10-week study period<br>participants actively made changes in<br>the following areas to promote emotional<br>competence<br>um and from the the Pod Hui we had at<br>the start the kayako<br>um participants in the team were able to<br>look at how this works for them which is<br>a really big part of what we did I<br>didn't come in with any intentions it<br>was completely blank slate and everyone<br>was able to work at ways that were<br>authentic um to us setting and to<br>themselves<br>um so one of the the first part is<br>fariki so um our mat time our fariki<br>which is held before lunch and then at<br>the end of the day we have<br>um tulfar which is Samoan for goodbye<br>which is kind of a smaller<br>key<br>uh so over the 10-week period<br>um each participant made the decision to<br>actively add techniques to increase<br>discussion around feelings and promoted<br>ways in which to calm our bodies<br>um during this time the Coco slowly<br>started to add new aspects to our usual<br>routine and by the end of the sessions<br>and continues now<br>um they always begin with hakiroto<br>hakiwajo which now the tamalikia are<br>modeling for us so when we sit down to<br>fariki they know that that's where we'll<br>begin<br>um and I'll show you a resource that we<br>used at the end<br>um giving tamariki the skill and the<br>empowerment to be able to do it by<br>themselves appears to have cemented it<br>into Monaco practice<br>uh Leslie romerker highlighted in her<br>work that Maui Built leadership<br>responsibilities over time and showed<br>how tamariki can do this too through<br>learning mentoring sharing and taking on<br>responsibility which we've really seen<br>in this setting<br>the knowledge built in this time was<br>also seen to support Behavior outside<br>with participants noting that they could<br>refer back to what had been learned<br>earlier in the day<br>um<br>focusing on the breath and studying<br>these sessions calmly was an intentional<br>Choice made by the participants through<br>engaging with himapuna<br>so mariki feeling calm and these<br>sessions then also had the effects of<br>them being able to contribute and feel<br>more manner over time at fatiki<br>the current uh the next part is feelings<br>so<br>um that I can see you're feeling<br>frustrated I can see you're upset that<br>kind of codero built over time<br>um which Builds on the findings<br>um and the literature which show that<br>vocabulary plays a really huge role in<br>the promotion of emotional competence<br>um through increased use of feelings<br>talk and a focus on adding new words in<br>both English and today Maori the<br>participants in the study reported they<br>were more confident in tamariki being<br>able to at least attempt to solve<br>um the current study shows that whilst<br>participants reported the youth feelings<br>talk frequently in Phase One this<br>increased in phase two and all four<br>participants felt that they used their<br>kind of feelings talk more but also with<br>more<br>uh background to it knowing why they<br>were doing it and actively increasing<br>that<br>um and the findings suggests that these<br>changes also brought more today or Maori<br>to the Forefront particularly in using<br>um the next section is teamwork<br>so mahitahi we looked at how we<br>supported each other and the first phase<br>was more about being able to ask each<br>other for help<br>um but whereas in the second phase the<br>reflections talked a lot about<br>consistency of the team supporting each<br>other and really role modeling for each<br>other in the tomaliki so in the<br>relationships<br>we have with each other how the kayako<br>was speaking to each other we're<br>witnessed by tomaliki as well<br>um<br>I am also found that that some of the<br>participants were thinking more about<br>their own emotional competence<br>which really helps when we get into<br>things around co-regulation<br>um and obviously the sector faces a lot<br>of stress at the moment and probably has<br>always<br>um that working on our own emotional<br>competence really helps in role modeling<br>and supporting ourselves<br>um resources so we added quite a few new<br>resources which I'll show in the final<br>slide<br>um which I made sure did sort of double<br>duty was today on Maori until Maori<br>Concepts alongside emotional competence<br>um the book KTP Hickory and kyota were<br>huge hits<br>um and the tamariki were able to take<br>those and interpret them through ART<br>um and as you'll probably all know a lot<br>of things that we started out doing the<br>tamariki took in ways that we didn't<br>imagine<br>um which has been really amazing<br>um finally the environment so the<br>teaching environment incorporates both<br>the physical space and the resources<br>within it and the way that that space<br>feels<br>um the data gathered throughout the<br>study showed that was the physical<br>environment was considered prior to the<br>study the focus on it increased over<br>time<br>the way the tuacana room was set up was<br>mentioned as a way to listen potential<br>triggers<br>which could lead to emotional<br>dysregulation so things like having<br>resources set out that we know tamariki<br>is interested in that help them feel<br>calm and set them up really positively<br>for the day through their goodbye to<br>their whanau and that they start on a<br>really high note of success<br>um the above findings coupled with<br>participants indicating an increase in<br>self-regulation correlates with the idea<br>that children are more able to<br>self-regulate when they're engaged in<br>free play that they are directing<br>themselves<br>um the way the environment felt was also<br>reflected in the findings<br>um the feeling of overall calm<br>um was highlighted<br>and also from relievers who didn't know<br>the study was happening so it was kind<br>of a unforeseen bonus that that people<br>that didn't know what we were doing were<br>witnessing that things were changing<br>um when tabaliki are more regulated the<br>environment in turn becomes calmer<br>creating a cycle of positive emotional<br>competence promotion in the space<br>the changes seen in the environment<br>through engaging with homapuna build<br>upon current research and add further<br>weight to the statement by time that<br>responsive environments in a respectful<br>teaching practices support children who<br>have a sense of control over their own<br>learning<br>um and I've included a quote here that<br>I've really struggled with in my thesis<br>because it's so long but it's so hard to<br>break it down<br>um and it feels really important to what<br>happened so one of the participants said<br>in the final interviews when we say that<br>it's embedded here I think it's really<br>going to stay this way for us it's hard<br>to go back and I go back to that time<br>again because it's really a forum where<br>we can celebrate learning in the space<br>of emotional competence<br>and it's an area where we can get that<br>to a kind of Tina relationship to be<br>framed where we can praise our children<br>the older children and give them rewards<br>for helping the younger children<br>but it's also a space where the younger<br>children can see how the older children<br>are behaving and how they<br>um so the last of these three sections<br>um so we know that tomadikia born with<br>certain characteristics but we also know<br>that learning and growth in terms of<br>emotional competence is possible<br>so engaging with hermaphuna the<br>participants were able to see real<br>change in the way they promoted<br>emotional competence<br>the data showed an increase in feeling<br>of calm in the space in an increase in<br>confidence for both tamaliki and kayako<br>changes we've seen throughout throughout<br>the room and in various areas of play<br>and changes took place which helped<br>kayakotable bicolical awareness and<br>teach through a bicultural lens so this<br>is the results of the<br>um the self-assessment tool that's in<br>the back of hamapuna so there's three<br>sections down the side are what I've<br>been talking about<br>um in in them<br>in that assessment you can choose<br>emerging partly in place or embedded<br>and you can see that the participants<br>moved from phase one to phase two where<br>they felt all of those things were<br>embedded in our practice<br>uh<br>uh Somalia so<br>um the setting already had a very strong<br>um obsession with Maui<br>um and this came through pretty quickly<br>in terms of emotional competence so<br>um we were quite lucky that this was<br>already a really established<br>um<br>a way of learning in the in Etsy Monaco<br>and that the tamariki play as Maui they<br>read Maui they act<br>out stories all day long<br>um so linking the qualities of Maui was<br>quite easy and natural over time<br>um for the participants<br>um and so we started to hear comments<br>like I'm brave like Maui<br>um<br>um one one participant said I had really<br>a bit of a wild moment at that time<br>when a kayako said oh how do you think<br>Maui would feel<br>you know so incorporating this<br>Maui story that they love it's really<br>um<br>the next part is a little bit about what<br>can we do so from all of this learning<br>thank you<br>um what can we do with this how can this<br>work<br>um in with what we're all already doing<br>the the foundations of tafariki<br>um so I hope what we what can come of<br>this<br>um is that hermaphroa is such a wealth<br>of information and they're focusing on<br>it is really worthwhile<br>um and I appreciate how hard it can be<br>to fit this in alongside everything else<br>we are doing<br>um but the foundations are really<br>already there<br>um and laid out it aligns so closely<br>with tafariki so things through<br>relationships so Corridor which is<br>obviously already happening all of the<br>time we're talking we're building<br>relationships with our tomariki and our<br>whanau but doing that with a little bit<br>of a lens of emotional competence how<br>did you feel when that happened I could<br>see you were excited those kinds of<br>things<br>um<br>the uh feedback to whanau so that really<br>changed for us<br>um in terms of how we were feeding back<br>things that had happened during the day<br>so kayako were able to talk about<br>emotional competence in a way they<br>didn't feel confident to do before<br>um so feeding back about their day oh<br>so-and-so told me that they were feeling<br>sad because of this had happened or they<br>were really excited about this and just<br>slowly building it into feedback that<br>was already happening<br>um praise and pride which already really<br>huge<br>um and a lot of this links also to the<br>incredible years<br>um<br>teaching<br>um using praise was already really huge<br>but building on it and talking about<br>um there was a lot of comments from<br>participants things like you know I'm<br>sure you can do what you've oh no I'm<br>sure I I know you can do it you've done<br>it before remember how great you felt<br>when you achieved this so helping<br>tamariki persevere to build through<br>things and really building that prize<br>their praise and their Mana<br>um so that they can continue doing that<br>and feel capable and know that we know<br>they're capable<br>um intentional teaching so feelings talk<br>which happens a lot<br>um but just building on it and using it<br>um with each other in the team has been<br>really great<br>um building on interests so obviously we<br>quite often are already building on<br>interests we're using provocations we're<br>bringing in new resources<br>um for interests but those can often be<br>linked to emotional competence<br>um the mindful purchasing of resources<br>so you're buying things anyway how about<br>things that link to tell Maori that link<br>to emotional competence that promote<br>Corridor um between tamariki<br>um planning assessment and documentation<br>um wasn't a huge focus of my thesis but<br>it came through anyway in that learning<br>stories about confidence about Mana<br>about taking risks we're building<br>um and those things were linked into<br>documentation a lot more than we'd<br>um so in conclusion through this Mahi<br>um it's hope that Clark can see that the<br>foundations for promoting emotional<br>competence are already there<br>changes therefore do not need to be<br>overwhelming or at the expense of other<br>Mahi in order to make a big difference<br>may even find like in the study setting<br>that this foundation and focus on<br>emotional competence may even start to<br>change the way the sitting feels and<br>allow more joy Manner and emotional<br>awareness to shine through<br>uh This research shows<br>that changes don't have to be Monumental<br>to make a Monumental change for our<br>tamariki<br>um and finally I've just shared a few of<br>the resources that we used<br>um a couple of pukapuka that I used a<br>lot was the whole brainchild and social<br>emotional learning in the brain<br>um with the tamariki Kiora which is<br>Sharon Holtz so a song and a um<br>the song is also on Spotify and it has<br>been played quite a lot<br>um in the setting<br>um with kayako and tamariki adapting it<br>so it talks to a variety of members of<br>the whanau<br>um<br>and the tamariki and Coco have been able<br>to adapt and use their names so Kiora<br>Michelle ketepi and the tamariki were<br>then able to respond<br>um KTP Quay at the bottom<br>um illustrated by uh Nelson karkel<br>um was used a lot and it inspired a lot<br>of of Mahi at the art table<br>um the wooden hand at the top<br>um we got from a website called chip of<br>nature<br>um and it is designed so that you can<br>weave your fingers through the grooves<br>but we had one and we had 30 tomato key<br>who wanted to use it<br>um so at fatiki we now when we We Begin<br>in and out as we move and then the last<br>one a really big breath<br>um and now the tamariki uh the dangatera<br>they lead this at the start of um fariki<br>and the last one is from Little People<br>Big emotions which unfortunately I<br>didn't know until after I'd finished but<br>we have ordered these beautiful posters<br>and<br>um cards recently which you can get in<br>English<br>um there's an English version of<br>bicultural bilingual Vision in a today<br>version so we've gone for the today of<br>vision<br>um which comes with<br>um two really beautiful big posters with<br>um a range of emotions and a range of<br>calming strategies that we're sitting up<br>in the in the classroom so that's me<br>um<br>so now it's time for any questions<br>um also if there's not many questions I<br>thought it's really nice to hear what<br>other other kindergartens other settings<br>are up to in terms of emotional<br>competence<br>thank you so much Michelle um it's<br>it's really exciting to hear that you've<br>just about got over the line with your<br>submission<br>achievements thank you<br>fantastic<br>has anybody got any questions that<br>they'd like me to relate to Michelle so<br>she can hear a little bit more clearly<br>if I am related from here or any<br>feedback that you'd like me to pass on<br>to<br>I just wanted to say thank you for<br>sharing your research on the learnings<br>of uh here mapuna document and<br>reinforcing that centrality of<br>relationships and really exploring and<br>intentional teaching you know you don't<br>it's it's really drilling down in what<br>we do and and and how that impacts on<br>our children and some beautiful<br>strategies we've shared as well<br>um Catherine's uh just popped up on our<br>chat and she said Kiora Michelle I<br>really appreciate the resources and it<br>sounds like great research and I'm<br>really looking forward to reading your<br>thesis I think that'll have a few hits<br>on our um on our website when you get<br>that uploaded<br>thank you yeah it's it's so strange and<br>I'm sure a lot of people here know<br>you're sort of working and uh you're<br>alone and you're writing all this stuff<br>and and the participants know about it<br>and it's this is the first time I've<br>shared it with<br>sort of an unknown audience I guess so<br>it's really nice to hear something<br>exciting<br>get Maui to be such a central figure in<br>your Children's Place you're smiling<br>knowingly yes I I don't know how we<br>um we we've always hit the pukapucka<br>with heads<br>um and I didn't share um there's a<br>website we wooden wonders<br>which you can buy Walker with Maui and<br>his brothers tamarama and tada<br>um our kindergarten I'm incredibly lucky<br>was set up with by cultural intentions<br>so a lot of my he's been done before me<br>um<br>but a lot of it came from<br>Reading Maui Legends<br>um and over time the tamariki wanted to<br>act them out they they just became<br>um part of our play we use Jace to<br>patu's uh Jessica has<br>um Maori mindfulness so it's yoga<br>through Maui stories which is incredible<br>um which I also should put in my slide<br>um and through that the the tamariki<br>move their bodies to tell the story<br>which inspired them into role play<br>um and since then about a year and a<br>half ago they've never stopped<br>um they use the playground equipment as<br>Walker they make ropes constantly<br>someone's always the Eco<br>um so yeah it's just a lot a lot of
