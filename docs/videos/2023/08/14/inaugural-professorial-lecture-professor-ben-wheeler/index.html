host<br>and opening this evening's IPL when<br>we've come together to celebrate their<br>career and to reflect on the research or<br>Professor Ben Wheeler<br>so a very warm welcome to all of you<br>here on this very cold uh Dunedin<br>evening so a warm welcome to all of<br>those gathered here in person<br>um and also to those of you who are<br>joining us online both live and in the<br>future and a very special greeting being<br>to you to your family and to your<br>friends<br>um it is great that we're all gathered<br>together and just before I get into a<br>couple of opening Reflections I want to<br>convey both the best wishes and the<br>apologies of Professor Helen Nicholson<br>our acting uh Vice chancellor who<br>unfortunately can't join us this evening<br>but you wanted me to pass through her<br>best regards on to you these are very<br>special events the fact that we've come<br>in wearing our robes and we have some<br>resplendent robes in the front row is an<br>indicator that it is an event out of the<br>ordinary<br>we wear our robes really these days no<br>longer do academics at least at the<br>University of otago where our robes for<br>undergraduate teaching<br>we reserve them instead for special<br>occasions for example the graduations<br>when we celebrate the culmination of<br>students academic Journeys and at these<br>events at ipl's when we come together to<br>celebrate the most distinguished of our<br>academic peers<br>these are particularly important events<br>for us as a university community Because<br>We Gather to celebrate the work of a<br>colleague who has uh through sustained<br>work as a teacher as a researcher and a<br>member of our academic community<br>achieved the very highest levels and we<br>come together to celebrate this<br>scholarship their research and their<br>service<br>these occasions are special really<br>because they embody and celebrate<br>those Endeavors that are at the heart of<br>the University if we think about what a<br>human University is about it's about<br>researchers about teaching and it's<br>about the functioning of us as a<br>Scholastic and academic Community the<br>scholarly Journey the creation of new<br>knowledge and the transmission of<br>knowledge to students to colleagues and<br>to the interested public are our key<br>vocations and that's what we're<br>celebrating this evening<br>so it is great that we've all come<br>together at the end of a busy day on<br>this cold evening to celebrate both the<br>outstanding scholar that Professor<br>wheeler is and more broadly we've come<br>together to celebrate the importance of<br>knowledge and shaping and informing our<br>communities<br>these are also special occasions where<br>we get uh to join with our colleagues<br>and to listen to them to reflect on the<br>past on their journey to this point to<br>reflect on their current work and<br>perhaps look a little bit to the Future<br>as well so we're very much looking<br>forward to hearing your Reflections<br>um this evening Ben so um katsi enough<br>from me I will now hand over to<br>Professor Barry Taylor one of the people<br>wearing a resplendent Rover fantastic<br>quarterway who will provide a fuller<br>foreign<br>it's my pleasure to introduce Ben I was<br>told no more than five minutes but I've<br>actually worked with Ben I've just<br>worked out for approximately 20 years so<br>summarizing 20 years of working together<br>um right well will not take longer than<br>five minutes but<br>the summary of His academic career I'm<br>an issue starting when he first<br>graduated in medicine<br>2001<br>and then<br>he did his house surgeon registrar years<br>in Blenheim to a large degree and then<br>um<br>he decided to specialize in child health<br>and did his registrar training which<br>comes next both in Dunedin where I first<br>remember him and then he also had a<br>stintesso a registrars in Christchurch<br>and back in um also in Rotorua<br>um having<br>achieved Fellowship of the Royal College<br>australasian college of Physicians as a<br>general pediatrician he was appointed<br>here as the senior lecturer in 2009<br>and at that time<br>it was pretty clear that he also wanted<br>to be a pediatric endocrinologist so he<br>took one of his sabbatical years to<br>actually go to Sydney and spend a year<br>in further postgraduate training in<br>Pediatric Endocrinology<br>and achieved that during that sabbatical<br>year so he's dual trained in both<br>general medicine and in pediatric<br>um he was appointed as associate<br>professor in 2018<br>and then this year he's having his<br>um reviewing his CV<br>he's got 117 peer-reviewed articles I<br>note the first one was actually in 2005<br>when he was actually a registrar here in<br>Dunedin and my name's on that paper as<br>well as David wreath who's also a<br>professor in the department<br>um<br>and uh in the course and and that was<br>sort of his first one and then there was<br>a slight gap for two or three years and<br>then from 2012 onwards there's been a a<br>rapid increase in the number of papers<br>totaling at the end of last year 117<br>um<br>he has acquired greater than five and a<br>half million dollars worth of Grants it<br>took me quite a while to add them all up<br>and um<br>and has uh supervised five PhD students<br>his teaching has been mainly focused on<br>final year medical students attending in<br>their training intern year and he's sort<br>of looked after that group of students<br>really uh almost since you arrived here<br>as a senior lecturer and<br>I think that's sort of like the brief<br>summary I do want to actually just add a<br>wee bit more about what<br>sort of person being is so<br>um the first thing that comes to mind<br>when I think about Ben and and is really<br>his Supreme ability to collaborate uh he<br>has managed to collaborate with people<br>that I could never collaborate with and<br>that's a challenge some people are<br>actually very good but have opposing<br>views and Ben has the ability to<br>actually connect involve them in the<br>research and have a common aim and<br>you'll see this demonstrated I think in<br>the in the the rest of the lecture the<br>amount of collaborative work that he's<br>been doing is really very impressive and<br>getting teams to work together across<br>sometimes quite difficult boundaries<br>such as hospitals in in some opposition<br>um and yet he's able to go in behind get<br>a collaboration when actually many other<br>people I can't manage that that includes<br>me<br>um<br>so this is prime one of his prime<br>characteristics he's a quick and very<br>effective writer I supervise his PhD<br>and he was such a quick writer that I'd<br>in fact I've never had a PhD student who<br>wrote so effectively and relatively<br>quickly once the data was actually<br>collected<br>he's done some impressive work with<br>Community organizations and has been<br>politically active and lobbying for<br>greater Equity especially in terms of<br>access to some of the technology that<br>we're going to hear about shortly<br>um it's certainly been from my point of<br>view revolutionary to sit in the<br>diabetes Clinic with him especially over<br>the last five to ten years and see what<br>a ginormous difference it made for<br>children in this city with type 1<br>diabetes what previously you just coped<br>with and hoped that they'd grow up and<br>be able to do things well now the<br>technology has allowed us to do things<br>that I thought I would not see in my<br>lifetime so I'm looking forward to<br>hearing a bit more of this<br>in the coming lecture over the covert<br>period I think one of the<br>characteristics I noted was that he<br>brought his dog to to work and sat<br>underneath his desk and I see that today<br>there's a big controversy about other<br>people bringing their dogs to work as<br>well especially in Wellington<br>um<br>it's been a great pleasure to have been<br>to have been taking over the work that I<br>originally did in pediatric<br>endocrinology and diabetes and to see<br>this research in that area which has led<br>to such an enormous change in how well<br>our people are<br>I'm sure we're going to hear more about<br>this in the near future and I'm looking<br>forward to listening to Ben's inaugural<br>oh well uh tinakoto Tina Koto tinakoto<br>katoa call aurangi<br>called takapo a Toronto kopakaha England<br>Scotland to ewe called bin wheeler Taco<br>wingler so greetings greetings greetings<br>to you all<br>um this is a talk that differs in style<br>from anything really I've ever given so<br>you'll just have to bear with me as I<br>navigate that but really great pleasure<br>to be here with you all and you know<br>those of you who are able to come<br>tonight which is wonderful and those who<br>were able to see it come on the live<br>link and those uh who maybe watch it on<br>YouTube at another time so um really<br>great to celebrate this with you all but<br>particularly I'm seeing if any of my<br>team made it they've been ah yes I've<br>been driving from invercargill after<br>recruiting and training people all day<br>today so I'm glad I'm glad you made it<br>uh so great to share that with with you<br>all but really it's work that I that<br>I've done but also um work that really<br>represents all the people that I work<br>with and many of the projects aren't<br>even uh led by me so really is a very<br>much a collaborative effort<br>um I guess a special thanks to all my<br>family<br>um my friends my colleagues my<br>department<br>um and I I'm hoping to share with you<br>the journey through my clinical training<br>through some of my academic work and I<br>guess what I'd really like to highlight<br>as any success I've had has been through<br>uh friendship uh collaboration and<br>teamwork and I guess anything that's<br>positive that's happened to me really<br>reflects that that teamwork and the<br>friendship that I've you know been able<br>to build with many people which has<br>really made that possible so that that's<br>a message I'd like to you know to come<br>across from my talk today and I guess<br>because of the friendship and all the<br>people I've worked with it's been<br>incredibly fun so I guess as it's been<br>fun and we've enjoyed doing that it's<br>made the work very easy so to be pre you<br>know to be productive and collaborative<br>in that sort of environment<br>um uh you know it's very easy and I<br>guess I think the university and the<br>hospitals you know who've made that<br>happen for me I'd like to thank all the<br>mentors and people who've looked after<br>me and there's been many of those and<br>I've stumbled at times and they've<br>helped you know put me right and and<br>I'll thank some of them over um the talk<br>but I apologize to anyone I've uh left<br>out and any of my collaborators who I<br>don't mention it's just squeezing<br>everything into 45 minutes it's quite<br>hard and then most importantly I'd like<br>to think the main collaborators in my<br>life who I or my family<br>um and um and I'll I'll give you a<br>little introduction to them too<br>so<br>um this is the people I live with so my<br>daughter Charlie is sick today so so<br>she's home and then so suddenly My<br>Father Richard he's looking after here<br>and Sam so uh but I have my mother<br>Margaret here so that's lovely we all<br>live together and these photos just<br>share a few of the things that we enjoy<br>uh doing but we're quite into football<br>and soccer so we've enjoyed the World<br>Cup uh recently and there's a shot from<br>us at a phoenix game in Auckland from<br>the World Cup also a special mention to<br>Charlie who's unwell but she's my sort<br>of conference buddy and so from the age<br>of seven when I've done an invited talk<br>somewhere she's usually come with me and<br>this is a recent one to Korea here that<br>I think it's pronounced the Duong Cafe<br>which means the Poo Cafe and um and we<br>we had quite enjoying our coffee out of<br>our toilet there<br>a special mention to my brother and his<br>family to my adopted Sister Anne who's<br>in the UK who can't be here and then<br>also a big thank you to the children in<br>my life who are here<br>um so an Angela my partner so Olivia<br>Bella and Nathan are here and this is<br>some of our adventures and and and<br>there's sort of quite a connection to<br>the ocean so lots of the things we do<br>around the ocean so I'm looking forward<br>to that we've got some diving planned<br>for next week on holiday so so that's<br>um<br>some of the team may not thank me for<br>this photo I did warn them when they<br>sent it to me it was likely to end up in<br>a talk I really wanted to thank my<br>wonderful research team who really<br>um you know we come up with ideas and<br>then they make it all happen uh and so<br>the the lift photos there are of um<br>Alyssa Shirley pip yongwin and then<br>another one below uh from Timaru so<br>that's them and invercargill in a hotel<br>lots of recruiting and training<br>um around the country I think Melissa's<br>been in Auckland Wellington Timaru<br>invercargill<br>maybe Christ should or all in the last<br>two or three weeks as we try and rush<br>through recruitment to get to keep<br>things moving for for one of the trials<br>we're doing so so amazing work surely<br>has been to pretty much all of those<br>places as well uh but that's them in a<br>hotel<br>um and that was never meant to be shown<br>but it has been so uh but but there's a<br>much nicer one there including Carla who<br>did has done lots of area training onto<br>technology<br>um and is now in the dhb<br>um really a special mention to Shirley<br>who's in both those photos she's in one<br>of the orange masks at the very back<br>um but she's been with me right since my<br>appointment at otago working with me and<br>you know everything we've done we've<br>done together and and I probably owe her<br>about half my PhD but everything else as<br>well so so thanks Shirley<br>so um this is where I'm from I'm from<br>rangiora in North Canterbury I grew up<br>there I went to school there and this is<br>a an early photo of me I found going<br>through mum and Dad's photo albums<br>um but this is sort of an early part<br>from this very early age there were two<br>things I wanted to be one of them was a<br>doctor and so very thankful that I was<br>able to to go on and do that that was<br>always my plan and it just sort of<br>happened<br>um but I also wanted to be an astronaut<br>doctor and so that's me and my spaceship<br>getting ready to go to Mars<br>and they end up become a pediatrician so<br>I'm not sure if there'll be much work<br>for a pediatrician in the first Mars<br>Explorations but uh<br>um Charlie my daughter is spending two<br>weeks at um the NASA space school next<br>year um so you know maybe there's hope<br>just sort of talking Barry mentioned<br>training and and I've trained in<br>numerous places<br>um starting for Nelson mulbread District<br>Health Board and Blenheim um and and my<br>first sort of important mentor of my<br>career and someone I'm still in regular<br>contact with was Kian Dawson he was a<br>professor of child health and Pediatrics<br>he sort of semi retired in to Blenheim<br>for the last few years of his career but<br>it had an illustrious career around the<br>world as a professor and and I guess<br>because of that he he took me under his<br>wing and encouraged me to do pediatrics<br>he got me doing the diploma of child<br>health through the University of otago<br>which I now teach in<br>uh and then even years later I came back<br>before I did my specialist exams and he<br>set up a whole mock exam for me and I<br>you know drove to Blenheim and and he<br>examined me and and helped get me ready<br>so um he's been incredibly generous to<br>me and this is a photo of him and his<br>lovely wife Murray and and I still do<br>some Endocrinology work for that upper<br>part of the south island and I whenever<br>I'm there I love to see him so a big<br>thank you to him and he's an animal uh<br>he loves animals and so they travel<br>around the world and this is a shop from<br>Madagascar I believe<br>so I came to Dunedin to do my pediatric<br>basic training and this is just a lovely<br>photo here that I found in our<br>consultant office that we share and and<br>it's um with all the registrars I<br>trained with at that time and and it's<br>um just nice to see there um Kalahari<br>who's on the right she's a pediatrician<br>with me now in the hospital and so you<br>know we've spent a lot of our career<br>together but also in the middle was Lisa<br>Edmonds who's a neonatologist a<br>pediatrician and an academic here at the<br>University as well so of that cohort two<br>of us have ended up coming into academic<br>pediatric practice so you know I've been<br>very lucky to have people like that<br>around me after Christchurch I went<br>after Dunedin I went to Christchurch I<br>also spent three months in invercargill<br>over various periods of time and and was<br>very much looked after by Paul Tomlinson<br>who's recently retired from there but<br>also allowed us to recruit and became<br>fully involved in all their trials so<br>you know very supportive the final photo<br>there is from Sydney where I did my<br>fellowship in endocrinology and and that<br>was a wonderful time<br>and and there were many people there who<br>looked after me and and I guess I'd like<br>to thank in particular<br>um my children's Mother Susanna who you<br>know I dragged around all of these<br>places and and been enormous support to<br>me over the years as well<br>um then I came back to Dunedin<br>um and this this is Barry mentioned this<br>is my first uh publication 2005. this is<br>my first ever clinical trial I had one<br>participant<br>um and I only David wreath could come up<br>with an idea like this but the pharmacy<br>helped us they made Placebo and where<br>they cycled in and out in this clinical<br>trial this photo here when I asked David<br>for a photo for my talk of him is what<br>he sent me<br>um when I when I laughed and told him no<br>please send me a proper one he sent me<br>this<br>uh with the title this is me in my<br>formal work clothing so uh uh so there's<br>David<br>um but but he really did all the hard<br>work and helped me and in fact probably<br>my first half a dozen or a dozen papers<br>um David who was an author on them and<br>really looked after me the patient in<br>the study in fact I saw at the age of 20<br>in my clinic and discharged them to GP<br>care just a month or two ago so that was<br>a nice sort of as I just put the slide<br>together if any of my managers are here<br>I have transferred them into adult care<br>now<br>it's quite hard to to send people away<br>sometimes and so I returned to Dunedin<br>and<br>um in all fairness it was probably a<br>gamble giving me an academic role I had<br>two Publications at that time<br>um and I guess it just you know<br>reflecting on that there's been a lot of<br>work in the last 10 years to now you<br>know be around 120 or more Publications<br>so we've done a lot of work in a lot of<br>Trials and<br>um you know it's been a lot of fun but<br>but Barry and John Adams the dean at<br>that time you know they were very<br>generous to me and they they you know<br>clearly you know had some faith that<br>things would work out and and and I<br>guess I better not speak too soon<br>there's a few more years to go yet but<br>uh but it's been a very positive time<br>and that's Barry there of course and my<br>other PhD supervisor Lisa Halton from<br>Human nutrition who um you know really<br>they guided me through this work but<br>again my second clinical trial we ever<br>did now now pretty much we do clinical<br>trials all the time but uh was part of<br>my PhD and was around vitamin D and bone<br>health and and through pregnancy and<br>lactation so you know we're still doing<br>some work and that I have one PhD<br>student in that area now<br>um but really that just set the stage<br>for us to go on to do more and more<br>clinical trial work<br>and and most of that's now in diabetes<br>you know which is really my main passion<br>and and it's the most common we are one<br>of the most common chronic illnesses in<br>childhood and of course it carries<br>enormous harm to those with it if we<br>don't manage it well and just these<br>photos highlight just from around the<br>time and ceiling was first discovered a<br>hundred years ago what diabetes was like<br>and of course at that time all children<br>with that or adults who developed at Bay<br>or died and of course the these photos<br>here very near death right on the edge<br>of the discovery of insulin and then<br>once they were given that insulin you<br>can see Health restored but you know<br>these photos I I always I'm always<br>interested that happiness is not<br>restored in these photos<br>um and and so and that's really how<br>things went you know this clearly we<br>thought things were solved at that point<br>but there's a lot more to it than that<br>and I really like these photos this is<br>um uh Banting McLeod Beast colip uh the<br>four men who discovered insulin and were<br>awarded the Nobel Prize for that amazing<br>Discovery it was a summer studentship<br>for<br>um for um<br>best the medical student so they they<br>basically discovered insulin over a few<br>months in the summer things aren't quite<br>as easy in research now but<br>when he finished with this he planned to<br>cure cancer but that never quite worked<br>out but the other thing to learn from<br>these photos is that photo there there's<br>three of them there and the Cloud's not<br>in the photo that's the only photo in<br>existence with more than two of them in<br>the photo and they fell out almost<br>immediately didn't speak to each other<br>and in fact ended up in different<br>locations incredibly quickly and and I<br>guess there's the lesson and their<br>wonderful Discovery and their<br>achievement but I've always very<br>carefully taken that lesson around there<br>how their collaboration failed and and I<br>guess again the importance of friendship<br>uh you know and and teamwork and all the<br>work that we do<br>and and in the first child whoever<br>received insulin that's Leonard Thompson<br>and again they celebrated that but at<br>the age of 27 he died of complications<br>related to his diabetes so really just<br>hammering home how important diabetes<br>was as an illness and then I've got a<br>modern case this was referred to me from<br>one of my adult colleagues but in fact I<br>had looked after her as a child<br>um you know 18 now diagnosed at three<br>on injection therapy multiple times a<br>day but with severe needle phobia and<br>she's this number here the hba1c that<br>just reflects the health of her diabetes<br>and her normal would be 20 to 40 and her<br>number's been persistently sitting you<br>know many times that and this is a quote<br>out of the letter from her<br>endocrinologist unfortunately I felt<br>rather powerless talking to her so<br>basically this is a person who's stuck<br>they're experiencing enormous burden and<br>they've not been able to shift and so I<br>guess you know one of the questions for<br>me when we were thinking about research<br>it came quite naturally is how do we<br>take people who are in this position and<br>then find a solution for them or try and<br>find something so these are the most<br>interesting people to me the ones who<br>aren't doing as well how do we find<br>something for them<br>and just to highlight how bad this<br>problem is that she's not alone<br>um these two graphs the left one with<br>the blue bars this is from Australia and<br>New Zealand and this one over here is<br>from America but the red line represents<br>our Target which we know helps prevent<br>complications and early death from<br>diabetes but these numbers here show the<br>average achieved glucose control across<br>the lifespan and and basically there's<br>this peak deterioration and Adolescence<br>and young adults but at not a single age<br>do we meet the targets that we set that<br>we know prevent complications and this<br>is American data even more Bleak this is<br>our Target here the red line but you can<br>see miles above that are where our young<br>adults and adolescents sit and so this<br>really worries me and and 18 of the<br>children uh in in Australia and New<br>Zealand combined meet the Target that we<br>said and only 10 percent of the of the<br>young adults and The Adolescents so you<br>know and we're miles away with<br>traditional therapy from where we should<br>be<br>even more worrying this results in an<br>early death so this is data from<br>Scotland where people who are diagnosed<br>with type 1 diabetes under the age of 20<br>on average loser leaving to 13 years of<br>their life and you can see that they're<br>at the bottom uh another way of looking<br>at that as people without diabetes 76<br>percent of men and 83 percent of women<br>make it to the age of 70 but those with<br>type 1 only 47 of men and 55 percent of<br>women achieve that so clearly our<br>outcomes with conventional therapy<br>aren't even close to where we would want<br>them and unfortunately for type 2<br>diabetes their story is even worse so it<br>doesn't get any better<br>and if you're diagnosed before the age<br>of 10 between 14 and 18 years of life<br>are lost on average you know from these<br>big data sets so again we need to do<br>better<br>and this is I guess where our research<br>has come in and I'm just part of that a<br>small part of that<br>um very collaborative<br>um lots of friends New Zealand wide and<br>I guess Beyond and we're really<br>interested in sort of cutting-edge<br>diabetes technology and that mostly is<br>around glucose sensors and artificial<br>pancreas or automated insulin delivery<br>and I'd like to thank here as we've<br>begun those collaborations it's begun<br>locally and then spread out from there<br>but even within our department Professor<br>Barbara galanders in the frontier you<br>know working with her in our very first<br>projects as we started to get all of<br>this going colleagues from Pharmacy I<br>see Hesh is here but um you know who<br>I've become great friends with hish and<br>Natalie from Pharmacy<br>biostatistics without without them we<br>would greatly struggle with what we're<br>doing in particular Andrew Gray and Jill<br>Hazard have been involved in many of our<br>projects and Sierra is here from Human<br>nutrition who was with us right at the<br>beginning of our trial work as well<br>postdoc with us are now and now moved<br>into human nutrition<br>so and I guess our industry Partners so<br>we're partnered with a lot of our<br>funding comes from industry but without<br>their support the gear costs so much<br>without their support we just can't do<br>this work you know HRC can't even buy<br>the equipment that we need<br>um and and they've become invaluable to<br>what we do and many of them have become<br>our friends and so we have lots of<br>contact with them and we plan and share<br>the same goals and then uh moving south<br>north down in particular associate<br>professor Craig Jeffries in Auckland<br>um who we do do many of our trials with<br>either him leading or me leading or<br>someone else leading but there's always<br>somebody<br>um same thing with associate professor<br>Ryan Paul and the waikato<br>professor Esco Wiltshire and Wellington<br>associate professor Martin de Bach in<br>Christchurch and again the the five of<br>us and and many others have been doing<br>all this work together and we cook up<br>lots of these ideas over coffee or<br>dinner or year or lots of Escape rooms<br>and uh they're done at all the meetings<br>and conferences we go to and and there's<br>just some of them I managed to dig up a<br>few photos but they've been a lot of fun<br>and again it all started with pretty<br>humble beginnings and our and our<br>diabetes sort of tech area and we've<br>been doing descriptive things around<br>outcomes and things with technology but<br>this was sort of the beginning of things<br>and this was actually led by Esco<br>Wiltshire<br>um with an otago Medical School<br>collaborative Grant so again just<br>highlighting that some of these smaller<br>grants the ones that don't carry<br>overheads don't<br>um aren't glamorous they sometimes help<br>launch things and get everything<br>together and if we strip all that layer<br>of funding out only those like me now<br>will continue to succeed and they're the<br>ones below won't ever get that chance so<br>we need to be very careful but this is a<br>dual site study investigating<br>sleep which we brought in with Barbara<br>and Dawn from from Wellington continuous<br>glucose monitoring a cardiac function<br>which was one of esco's real passions<br>and it was a new collaboration with<br>Barbara which has gone on Barbara and<br>I've done loads of studies and and<br>sleep's been a big part of all our<br>technology studies going forward but but<br>Sierra was able to be appointed with<br>that money for a few years and really<br>got us going<br>and it's about glucose monitoring I<br>really love this slide this is just<br>highlights that we've been doing glucose<br>monitoring for hundreds of years I'm<br>quite pleased this isn't how we do it<br>now<br>um uh and um but I also really like the<br>slide because<br>um we traditionally many of my<br>colleagues still do a lot of fingerprint<br>glucose testing and really I I think of<br>that as pretty much the slide I think we<br>get a little bit of a laugh when we look<br>at this I think we'll think with horror<br>how we used to finger prick people to<br>get blood and really even now I think<br>for people who have access to it you<br>know it already is assigned to the<br>history books to some degree<br>and and this is continuous glucose<br>monitoring so we can put a little<br>filament under the skin that gets<br>changed every seven to 14 days and we<br>get the data continuously onto mobile<br>phones or watches<br>um you know and and there's been a whole<br>range of studies and and and I see<br>Shaker in the audience an<br>endocrinologist and one of our PhD<br>students but he's been doing work in the<br>Syria Mona Shelley and then Brooklyn and<br>Mimi who've done lots of work in this<br>area but I haven't even put all the<br>studies but but there's been numerous<br>ones there and we've been very lucky to<br>have we've had six PhD students over the<br>last few years and they're just many of<br>them just starting to finish out now but<br>it's been very positive<br>I I particularly mentioning um Sierra's<br>original study here<br>um this was the first study where we<br>really looked at young people who were<br>failing or you know really struggling<br>with traditional therapy and we also the<br>first of those trials where we recruited<br>from not only in Christchurch but we<br>recruited from Wellington Christchurch<br>and us and a little bit beyond as well<br>so we were starting to stretch out here<br>and it's um you know published in one of<br>the top diabetes journals but what we<br>really discovered here is is<br>um<br>when you looked at people who were<br>really struggling they were very diverse<br>but this was the first of our studies<br>where without even trying over 40 of the<br>study people had come to us were Maori<br>and Pacific so it also highlighted to me<br>that you know everybody in New Zealand<br>was interested in the skier they would<br>wear it and we could get success with it<br>they loved the skier they their burden<br>reduced but what we couldn't show as it<br>made any difference so in this if you<br>just monitored them with you know<br>looking at their glucose numbers it<br>didn't turn into didn't translate into<br>getting healthier and so we really<br>um<br>one of the things we saw there is people<br>couldn't afford the gear so this is just<br>um both Shaker and Mona have done some<br>really cool slightly quirky work we're<br>using the DIY movement there's this<br>whole movement and diabetes where very<br>very clever parents mostly they hack<br>into gear that exists and they create<br>all sorts of clever ways to make<br>continuous glucose monitors or even<br>artificial pancreases and they've been<br>extremely clever and in fact they<br>brought out the first systems so that<br>was a movement led by people with<br>diabetes not by Academia but here's a<br>Mona doing a trial of a cheaper way to<br>to make continuous glucose monitoring<br>essentially in your backyard with a<br>Bluetooth transmitter sending to data to<br>your phone to your watch sending it into<br>the cloud and then it comes down from<br>the cloud and then parents or Partners<br>can follow the data wherever you are in<br>the world so again as we push it harder<br>and harder hopefully price comes down<br>and this becomes easier to access<br>worldwide<br>and and I guess there's been a bunch of<br>these systematic reviews and<br>meta-analyzes we've had people do this<br>as another part of Mona's PhD but I<br>guess we're probably one of the few<br>groups where when we write these it's<br>our studies that are often in them and<br>this is a collaboration here with with<br>Jill Hazard and Barbara helping us with<br>the methodology but um but people from<br>America and England as well<br>I put this one especially this is<br>another one of these again there's only<br>five studies on this sort of Technology<br>done but one of them's ours but I I've<br>put this here um because it's a new<br>collaboration with China and young ones<br>here and and um she's funded from China<br>to be with us for the next 18 months<br>doing work and it's been really great<br>and we're looking forward to a lot more<br>the slides just enter entering us into<br>automation so this is probably the most<br>recognizable sort of form of automation<br>this is a Tesla self-driving vehicle you<br>know these are on the road now and and<br>it uses all the same things that we need<br>to use if we want to automate someone<br>with diabetes so you take uh the engine<br>so the thing that drives the car you<br>take cameras all around other sensors<br>they work out what the the world that<br>the car is traveling through and then<br>you need a powerful computer with an<br>algorithm that processes all of that<br>information and helps the car go where<br>it needs to go<br>and I guess when we're doing trials the<br>main aim is we don't want this to happen<br>and unfortunately we haven't had that<br>happen uh but you know the these cars<br>that self-drived are the safest vehicles<br>on the road but whenever this happens<br>there's enormous kerfuffle about how<br>terrible uh automation must be so um we<br>need to be extremely careful because we<br>could set the whole movement that we're<br>part of back you know numerous years if<br>something goes wrong but what how we do<br>it is uh we have an insulin pump that<br>continuously infuses and ceiling into<br>the body we have a continuous glucose<br>sensor that's replaced every seven to 14<br>days that sends glucose levels through<br>to the pump and the pump has a brain or<br>a phone has a brain and it decides uh<br>the answer enable does it go up does it<br>go down does it stop and we can help try<br>and keep people in much healthier<br>glucose levels<br>so this is our first automation trial<br>only uh only published uh uh I I've got<br>the date on it wrong that's a little bit<br>earlier than that<br>um this is a collaboration between otago<br>medical school and in our us team uh<br>this led to regulatory approval of the<br>system which is you know probably one of<br>the most used systems in the world<br>um so that's data out of University of<br>otago Christchurch and otago that was<br>led by my colleague associate professor<br>Martin de Bach his connections with<br>industry helped you know get get that<br>coming<br>and we had 30 participants each from all<br>around otago Southland 30 around<br>Canterbury and and this we these people<br>because it was a regulatory study<br>um they're very healthy already so so<br>these are not people who are struggling<br>but already and those people by<br>automating them you improve the time<br>they spend and healthy glucose by around<br>three hours per day<br>and what was really interesting to me is<br>the is the younger ones the young adults<br>the ones who are a bit more challenging<br>we improved the ear glucose control by<br>around three and a half hours per day<br>you know extra three and a half hours in<br>the healthy range than they were<br>spending before<br>you can sort of see what happens this<br>this pink shaded area is when you<br>automate somebody and in particular the<br>power comes overnight you drive them<br>down into very healthy glucose levels<br>essentially levels as if they didn't<br>have diabetes but during the day there's<br>always a bit of chaos and it's a bit<br>harder to really get that same control<br>but we it's getting better and better<br>uh<br>I've just wanted to put Mercedes of<br>study in here<br>um Martin as her primary supervisor but<br>with me is one of her secondary<br>supervisors and again recruiting from<br>Auckland South into a randomized control<br>trial HRC funded<br>again all all of these systems do great<br>no matter which system you pick you<br>always improve the health of people who<br>are wearing them but in this one here<br>the control arm only 15 of people reach<br>the diabetes targets that we know are<br>safe but in this device 60 reach the<br>targets we see it but also I guess just<br>highlighting and celebrating with<br>Mercedes it's not very often that you're<br>a PhD ends up with a New England Journal<br>a medicine publication you know one of<br>um this is work that Alyssa and I and<br>the team have been doing in Dunedin<br>otago South and Christchurch<br>um again putting those same youth that<br>we took from Sierra's original study not<br>the same people but very similar group<br>um putting them probably one or two are<br>the same people maybe<br>um putting putting them onto the syst<br>onto a new system that automates their<br>diabetes and so again you can see here<br>um after three months taking people<br>basically who really struggling with<br>traditional therapy not even close to<br>meeting Target but after being on those<br>systems their their time and the target<br>range improves by around 40 percent<br>absolute and what that means is there's<br>over nine no almost nine and a half<br>hours per day extra time and healthy<br>diabetes healthy glucose range so<br>um you know this is all very fresh data<br>so I don't know what it does to<br>long-term complications but it's must<br>have an enormous impact and we've even<br>seen some eye healing and things like<br>that amongst some of these people so we<br>think we can not only sort of hold<br>things but maybe we can start to reverse<br>some of the difficulties they're having<br>and there's a really life-changing for<br>these people<br>and of course that's lead on to funding<br>from lions from otago Southland diabetes<br>charitable trust from<br>Starship Foundation who funded our<br>Auckland site<br>um from even an individual family the<br>Bowen family and that's led to this<br>trial running nationally again from the<br>north to the very bottom of the South<br>hence the last few people recruited<br>today in invercargill so so over the<br>last couple of months we've recruited 80<br>people Nationwide into that study and<br>and clocked up a few ear points for<br>Alyssa and Shirley<br>and but Lions have been the big founder<br>of this and and lots of help from the<br>Edgar diabetes and obesity Research<br>Center as well<br>but basically this is I'll give you a<br>few personal touches from these studies<br>just to get a feel so again this is back<br>to myself terrible needle phobia not<br>achieved any healthy diabetes her entire<br>time that she's been involved with us<br>enormous financial hardship but again<br>after three months she's well in Target<br>for the first time ever in her life you<br>know loving the system she's kept us<br>running now for well over a year and<br>what you see when you do this and you<br>can see in particular she's 75 percent<br>of the time in the healthy range now<br>where before she maybe was five percent<br>of the time and what happens overnight<br>is essentially it's like she doesn't<br>have diabetes and I think we'll push<br>that out beyond the night so over time<br>things are still much healthier in the<br>day as well but I think that's where<br>some of the healing will will start to<br>occur as well I hope<br>and you can see here again these sort of<br>beautiful nights so these people you<br>just tell them you don't need to worry<br>anymore go to bed you wake up your<br>glucose will be in Target and in this<br>there's a technical malfunction which<br>this sometimes is uh that that's exactly<br>what will happen<br>you can see there on that bottom day in<br>fact she's spent 87 percent of the time<br>and target range again a person they<br>would have spent maybe five percent at<br>the most before coming into a study<br>and and here's uh one of the young<br>people I've learned the most from uh and<br>we still you know he's still in one of<br>our extension phases he's been on this<br>device for over a year well over a year<br>now but um he's been really cool we've<br>learned a lot he's 22. he's the most<br>unhealthy person with diabetes when he<br>came into a trial I think I've ever seen<br>I don't think there's a trial anywhere<br>published with such unhealthy diabetes<br>there's just no way anybody would ever<br>put someone like him into a trial<br>um he was super Keen he turned up he was<br>always there<br>um and uh he he's never really had a<br>number anywhere close to being healthy<br>basically that number sustained over<br>five years so unhealthy you can't<br>measure it in our point of care testing<br>you have to send him to a laboratory for<br>every assessment<br>and of course he must be extremely high<br>risk for early complications and death<br>and so this is his data here but<br>basically we're in the system now for<br>well over a year he's been completely<br>trouble free<br>after six months as hba1c goes from 170<br>unrecordably high now just slightly out<br>of our Target but very very close he's<br>put on you know many kilos of 80 you<br>know had malnutrition really difficult<br>as here was growing back<br>um I thought about wearing one of these<br>machines myself<br>um<br>but but automation saved his life<br>there's no doubt and he's been able to<br>run on it the key thing is how do we<br>keep him on it you know how do we afford<br>to to keep him going<br>this is a slightly more selfish look at<br>it this is diabetes Camp so you know<br>I've had the pleasure of being involved<br>in those for numerous years I don't run<br>them I just turn up and help but Jenny<br>rains Ruth Thompson they they deal with<br>the hard work but my kids have been<br>coming to these since they were age<br>three so they just get dragged around<br>with me when we do things there's my<br>daughter Charlie in the middle there<br>um there's me<br>only in the South would there be sort of<br>guns and bows and arrows but I think<br>that's a pretty unique southern camp but<br>here's a person on one of our trials<br>automated the numbers are largely in<br>single digits and I basically don't have<br>to do very much for the entire Camp<br>here's someone here on a traditional<br>insulin pump already technology but no<br>but not automated and I'm working pretty<br>hard constantly through the day fiddling<br>with their food and their settings and<br>changing things so<br>um you know these systems reduce burden<br>as well they create some food and with<br>the take and and you and and Technical<br>challenges but they definitely<br>um<br>um<br>and here's a few quotes just as I wrap<br>up<br>um you know here's a nice one doing so<br>well on the machine changed from<br>struggling to focus at school to<br>achieving the top student<br>I quite like this one here my favorite<br>moment from The Trial was she casually<br>remarked me one day I forgot I had<br>diabetes today<br>um<br>these one this is an adult just you know<br>saying it was as close to a diabetes<br>holiday as I've ever been able to<br>achieve<br>and then there's these sort of really<br>sad ones again just see looking into<br>appearance uh understanding and worry<br>about their children you know worried<br>about coming into the bedroom finding<br>them not awake or not not conscious so<br>being on these devices provides quite a<br>safety net for that<br>and with that we've become quite<br>interested in equity and I guess one of<br>the first studies we did on pumps I<br>looked at it all I was presenting it at<br>preventive and social medicine and one<br>of their seminars and and it was quite<br>clear that I think of the 170 people on<br>the pumps that were taken from Tauranga<br>South for this study I think there was<br>one person who was non-newzealand<br>European in it one one person was Maori<br>and and I cheated afterwards with Leanne<br>Parkin and she said oh well we could um<br>look into that more so we did a study<br>with her that she lead and then we've<br>gone on to do some other work in this<br>area and this is just another one here<br>um with Laura Lai<br>um just highlighting that<br>um people of New Zealand European uh<br>despite this being publicly funded uh<br>you know two to three times more likely<br>than Maori or Pacific or Asian people to<br>access and ceiling pumps and if you look<br>at it by socioeconomic deprivation again<br>despite being publicly funded if you're<br>in the least deprived quartile far more<br>likely to get than those in the least<br>deprived and if you look at continuous<br>glucose monitoring which is currently<br>not funded in New Zealand those effects<br>are even more exaggerated they're fairly<br>brutal<br>and so clearly you know over time access<br>to the T we've I think we've clearly<br>proven that the technology is the gold<br>standard way to manage diabetes but<br>Equity is now the big issue and and<br>we've been trying to fight with pharmac<br>for how to achieve that<br>this is quite a cool study again from<br>Mercedes and Martin that I had the<br>pleasure to be part of but again just<br>highlighting that if you put technology<br>on people it evens out ethnic<br>disparities so this nice red line here<br>as we are the European glucose<br>controllers doesn't really matter about<br>the numbers but if you look here if you<br>finger prick are Maori and Pacific<br>glucose controls miles behind this is<br>all New Zealand children in the starter<br>but if you put them on continuous<br>glucose monitoring it evens out that<br>disparity so Maori in fact have pretty<br>much identical glucose control if<br>they're using this gear so so I think<br>the key thing is how do we get it onto<br>everybody<br>and I guess that's led to advocacy and<br>again a bit like the Kemps I'm just sort<br>of a person who gets dragged along so<br>it's diabetes New Zealand it's all the<br>people with diabetes who are advocating<br>for this and it's never been the doctors<br>who have led this the sort of movement<br>and it's the same in cancer you know um<br>doctors can speak about these things all<br>they like but you've got to mobilize<br>people with the condition to help<br>Advocate but this is from a meeting at<br>Parliament that was sponsored by you<br>know diabetes New Zealand lions and and<br>organized and run from the Edgar<br>diabetes and obesity Research Center so<br>really strong advocacy from all of them<br>I'm just a speaker here but you're<br>meeting all these lovely people who are<br>really living that whole journey and and<br>fighting and and this is us at<br>Parliament recently at the health select<br>committee again fighting for continuous<br>glucose monitoring and again here that<br>vary in the middle CEO of diabetes New<br>Zealand and people like Ruby a person<br>with diabetes that they're doing all the<br>hard work but but without that advocacy<br>um we're you know it's very hard to move<br>forward and and I guess the good news<br>being this is um July 2023 pharmac<br>finally listening to all of that and<br>I've just summarized it all in one slide<br>but but I'm now putting out a request<br>for quotes for for funding that and<br>we're very hopeful that that'll be<br>funded by early next year<br>I think that's pretty much uh the end<br>really but just sort of a long journey<br>uh and<br>um hopefully many more projects and<br>Escape rooms still to come uh but really<br>a big thanks to family friends<br>collaborators mentors who all in in this<br>journey with us you know whether it's<br>lead from us or lead elsewhere to our<br>local Team all here and just made it but<br>it's particularly to surely you know we<br>we share everything that we've done and<br>all the wonderful participants in our<br>study you know there was one study where<br>we recruited 60 people for an artificial<br>pancreas trial in one month uh in<br>between Christchurch team and ours so<br>you know the people with diabetes who<br>come into these trials are just so<br>enthusiastic and and I think all their<br>thank you<br>well um I have the the pleasant and<br>possibly the easiest job of saying thank<br>you to Ben for<br>um both you know what he's told us about<br>tonight but also for his contributions<br>um to the department and uh and to the<br>country and I guess I have a personal<br>thank you to Ben as well because uh when<br>I first arrived in Dunedin which is now<br>about five and a half years ago<br>um uh we were coming for family reasons<br>I didn't have a job to come to in in<br>Dunedin we didn't know exactly how it<br>was all going to work and uh Chris<br>Cowell who uh Ben didn't actually<br>mention my name but was actually my boss<br>at Westmead Children's Hospital in the<br>area I was working in he said look you<br>should go and you know look up Ben<br>Wheeler and have a talk to him because<br>you know he's uh you know he's really a<br>good guy to know and and we met up in<br>the fix<br>and uh and I've since discovered uh a<br>whole lot of things that actually Ben<br>and I share in common<br>um we<br>have fathers who started off as<br>Ministers of religion and ended up as<br>psychologists<br>um and we we start we we both obviously<br>were at Children's Hospital Westmead for<br>for some period of time we both<br>um had<br>you know a start to our academic career<br>after we'd already started our our<br>clinical career and and just very<br>recently I discovered that Ken Dawson<br>was a link because you've been mentioned<br>about Ken Dawson as a mentor and I said<br>Ken Dawson now that there's a lot of<br>Candor since but was that the Ken Dawson<br>who was at Westmead in the 1990s and in<br>fact I remember Ken coming from<br>Christchurch he was at Westmead and he<br>went to the UAE and he came back to<br>Blenheim has been said and I talked to<br>Ken last week he unfortunately isn't<br>able to be here because he's had knee<br>surgery recently but um one of the<br>things that Ken said to me was well you<br>know Ben Wheeler he was there in<br>Blenheim<br>um in as an intern and almost you know<br>within a few weeks of his of him coming<br>I could tell this was an exceptional guy<br>and I really encouraged him to uh to<br>work in child health and he said well I<br>had to really fight for him to be<br>allowed to sit the DCH you know because<br>he was only in his second year and<br>people were doubtful but according to<br>Ken I can't independently verify this<br>but according to Ken Ben actually topped<br>the DCH in that year as a as a second<br>but uh but I've certainly so I've<br>personally been very grateful to Ben for<br>um you know the uh the help that he gave<br>me in terms of of you know being able to<br>connect with the Pediatric scene in<br>Dunedin and I've got a couple of slides<br>that I just wanted to to show do I just<br>click on these<br>yeah<br>John okay<br>um someone was going to load these<br>slides for me but I can't uh looks like<br>they didn't tag them on so I have to try<br>and find them somewhere<br>otherwise I'll just have to tell you<br>what they said what they said<br>um there's a bit of a shame because<br>there's something special that I wanted<br>to show you so I was assured that they<br>were being loaded but anyway<br>um maybe we'll have to send them send<br>them round later but I I wanted to uh to<br>highlight<br>both what what Barry opened the the<br>offering on in terms of just the scale<br>of Ben's achievement I was looking at<br>the the progress from you know 2009<br>through to his PhD in 2018<br>and through to um<br>where we are today and and and uh like<br>Barry and Ben I came across the first<br>paper with the end of one trial and<br>noted that the New England Journal paper<br>um which of course is uh is a goal that<br>many of us never reach it is in fact<br>um the most prestigious medical journal<br>in the world not just one of<br>um and uh and in fact that was that was<br>97 patients so so so and it was Ben's<br>100th paper I think if I was counting<br>correctly<br>um so there are some uh yeah there are<br>some there are some impressive numbers<br>in there and the the thing I was I was<br>hoping to show you but I'll have to send<br>it around separately was a a great word<br>cloud that we got together<br>um from the people in the department who<br>are asked to provide<br>um<br>uh one to three words to describe Ben<br>and<br>um and one of the ones that should have<br>definitely featured strongly<br>um uh but it's featured strongly in the<br>in the in the talk is Modesty because uh<br>Ben has consistently told us how he<br>really did nothing it was all these<br>other people uh but in reality if you<br>look at what's been achieved and what<br>has happened uh it totally wouldn't have<br>happened without Ben<br>um and so it has been an enormous<br>contribution from him personally<br>um one of the things that Shona said to<br>me in the email was it was a bit tough<br>because we didn't get a lot of repeat<br>words we just got so many different<br>words<br>um and uh and a couple of the ones that<br>really that really stood out were<br>encouragement and<br>um and approachability and while that's<br>getting up I will do the final<br>job for the thank you which which is to<br>present Ben with a thank you from the<br>University for all his contributions<br>thank you very much<br>so<br>um hi I'm Professor Neil gimmel and I'm<br>the acting Deputy Pro Vice Chancellor<br>for Health Sciences so I actually do<br>have the easiest job of the evening<br>um so my job is literally just to thank<br>you for being here and being part of<br>what I think has been a particularly<br>special evening I want to thank you Ben<br>for what I thought was a wonderfully<br>delivered IPL the this word cloud really<br>reflects many of the things I was<br>thinking as I listened to you<br>um modest or humble was one of the words<br>that came to mind uh understated but the<br>compassion that you show for your<br>patients and your desire to use research<br>to deliver better outcomes I think was<br>very admirably demonstrated tonight so<br>congratulations and thank you<br>um<br>I'm also mindful that you love escape<br>rooms and I was also mindful that you<br>were celebrating what I thought was<br>quite a fantastic score on your escape<br>room Triumph but you've also escaped<br>from this IPL and what I have to admit<br>is uh quite record time based on some of<br>the ones I've seen recently so<br>congratulations on that so without<br>further Ado I invite you to come across<br>to the staff club for refreshments and<br>to continue the conversation and</p></main><footer style="margin-top: 2rem; background: #0001; padding:
