background<br>actually while they had these little<br>conversations anyway they were talking<br>about uh karakia and they were getting a<br>bit annoyed with people having a tick<br>box cutter here not nothing pertaining<br>to what the the cope up of there who he<br>was and you know this journey is full of<br>lessons and this is one of them because<br>I said to my daughter oh<br>oh could you write us a kind of care for<br>our own trips to Miles and she went ah<br>no<br>okay so um she said off you go and do<br>your work<br>find out what you want to say what do<br>you feel what are you trying to say why<br>are you saying it then you know do your<br>work and come back to me you know I<br>might give you a hint so we did that and<br>this is some of the um first of all we<br>talked to the children and this is over<br>a period of time and these it was<br>actually after the idea of<br>personification and you can see that<br>from the accordion or from the children<br>they'd already got that idea of<br>personifying mold they did it so easily<br>much better than we did and then we had<br>a corridor with our teachers about what<br>we we really wanted to say and again it<br>was after a considerable about of<br>learning that we did so<br>so I tried to put it together in my very<br>basic knowledge and then I took it back<br>to my daughter and she was very happy<br>this time and helped us come up with<br>our color care that we can use today<br>and I like this color here mostly<br>because it really clearly<br>has our status of friends that we're not<br>trying to be anything we're not trying<br>to claim ownership we're there for the<br>generosity of talking to fenwa and we're<br>to do two things<br>you can this is just an example of how<br>the children have personified well these<br>are the some of the statements that they<br>have made and that we've heard on their<br>Journey<br>you can see you can feel I think<br>from the care and the love that they<br>feel From This Moment<br>part of our um<br>what Dean asked us to do with karakia<br>now we have a authentic karakia<br>uh the part of the mole<br>revitalization was one of these<br>beautiful carved rocks at the Puna that<br>we had a care in and again an example of<br>how this<br>developed was being in the right place<br>at the right time we were at this place<br>and a couple came up and they were going<br>to cut it here and they were using the<br>water to whakanua and we weren't doing<br>that we were just saying karakia so you<br>know just a cheeky person<br>can you explain to the children what<br>you're doing and why you're doing it and<br>they were lovely and they did and then<br>from that moment we also used the water<br>to or you know so the first time<br>the children like just giving themselves<br>a wash because it was not a normal<br>practice for them but now I think it is<br>in the beautiful thing here is that um<br>this is part of her practice now in<br>Normal open kindergarten settings<br>oh there we go<br>the other part she features quite a bit<br>here<br>connecting to the environment is that we<br>often get children just to sit and<br>listen and feel<br>and these are her words<br>what can you feel brother<br>I can either buddy<br>uh another aspect which is quite<br>enjoyable is the tanifa<br>now there's not a traditional story<br>about Italian power in this place this<br>is a hole at the top of the stream we go<br>to waikapu waipatukahu<br>and it's formed because the good old<br>settlers came and stuck a pipe at<br>another<br>where the stream was in the water went<br>down<br>and it's left us<br>whole here but what I like about this is<br>that the idea of tanifa is in the modern<br>day narrative it's just the normal part<br>of their life and just a couple of weeks<br>ago she took me over and said see Nana<br>these Stones here<br>honey first Footprints so you know it's<br>true<br>so when we go on these outings<br>the um<br>what we've found is often that the most<br>challenging children<br>can really do very well when we go on<br>these outings<br>and although from time to time kayakor<br>have been tempted to say gosh this could<br>we're worried they're going to run away<br>we're worried that we're not going to be<br>able to manage let's not hate them<br>we don't do that we always take them<br>and we just manage ourselves so that<br>that child gets the best opportunity to<br>um to be the best self on the<br>um<br>yeah wobbly rocks make the brain and<br>body work harder and that's something<br>that we can give them when we're on<br>outings that we can't give them an out<br>kindergarten setting<br>um it's interesting to see you think<br>children are confident but they're on<br>Flats<br>there's a lot to contend with and it's<br>it's a great challenge<br>these are some of the challenges<br>and that that bridge that um I think<br>from years ago<br>um that's covers Bridge actually and<br>that's being named that for a long long<br>time<br>this is our biggest challenge uh fiscal<br>challenge for the children when we're<br>only asking it's on the the side of the<br>manga and it's it's quite a challenge so<br>we've got some rules there for<br>everyone's well-being so<br>you're not allowed to overtake someone<br>when you're walking along that track<br>is really the rule and a kayako will<br>stay under the bit the bit where you<br>might slip off we've got someone there<br>and children only very really slip off<br>and whilst whilst they say we're<br>teaching strategies for safety so we go<br>if you're feeling wobbly get down low<br>hold the tree roots so they've got some<br>it's not about fear it's about Mastery<br>and how you'll Master it but it's also<br>not about it's not the goal of the trip<br>and it's there's no gold star for it and<br>if today you feel like walking with me<br>along the base track do that and that's<br>so these These are literally just some<br>of the ways that because they've got<br>more space and because we're not rushed<br>and that's a very strong part of the<br>culture of these outings we're not<br>so this time in space and it's very<br>familiar because the 10 oldest kamariki<br>go every Fortnight and then one goes to<br>school so then the next one comes along<br>so we've always got a really capable<br>the children love<br>and last year November our whole<br>teaching team went up to the Natural<br>phenomena Workshop weekend<br>and a bunch of our kayako went to a<br>workshop about making kawakawa Barn<br>so that's gone into our learning and<br>then when we came back we made it with<br>the children but taking care we didn't<br>take kawakawa from the moment do we<br>because we don't take anything from The<br>Milner<br>so we made the kawakawa the children<br>made it and then was able to get that to<br>whanau<br>oh okay<br>um other things that we've done is<br>encouraging art while we're there so<br>it's right in the place and this is just<br>a new thing we're adding new things on<br>all the time really so that was very<br>successful when we'll we'll do it again<br>and this was some of the other things<br>was going to go through here he made a<br>collage one day well actually it wasn't<br>one day it was over a series of times to<br>pick the two Darko of our Mona<br>that was huge we've only got one big<br>wall that we would ever put stuff up on<br>and that's got pride of place<br>and also encouraging the children's<br>Voice through making them to take their<br>own photos while they were there<br>funny enough there's a lot of photos of<br>us<br>we've done a lot of work after<br>discovering glass eels at waipa to<br>kakahu<br>and then at natural phenomenon we<br>attended the tenure back workshops and<br>she's got a beautiful story about the<br>tuna and protect the hour because this<br>is our home it's an eight minute<br>story that you act out and uh I'm<br>passionate about tuna I'm Nai tahun so<br>tuna really matter<br>and we uh very shortly going off to<br>Wetlands<br>and we want to just give that sense of<br>kaitiakitanga and caring for not just<br>flash canals that run through Modern<br>developments but understanding the<br>purpose of wetlands and to the food<br>cycle<br>okay<br>we pay attention to the place named<br>Centurion Maori children oh yeah we've<br>and one other thing we've done is just<br>creating a space for children to revisit<br>their Journey so this is a book about<br>all the things they have seen<br>while they're on there and you can see<br>there's lots of discussion going on<br>this is the um<br>as part of the research Linda and<br>interviewed four of our whanau and these<br>were the some of the things that they<br>had said so you can see it's um<br>it's influencing our whanau and why do<br>and also they've made with a whanau help<br>they've made these uh caught away that<br>represents the purako of mole<br>um just really important here to<br>acknowledge I was talking about how we<br>learned things<br>and I think one of the key things that<br>we have done is making sure we're in the<br>right places so we go to things even<br>though it might be hard<br>I might have to juggle ratios we might<br>have to take away a little bit of<br>non-contact and we don't get much<br>um and we've we've learned from people<br>around us and I want to acknowledge<br>Thatcher here is a very famous person a<br>navigator and he was in we were just<br>there at the right time really and he<br>got stuck with these two and three and<br>four-year-olds on a trip to Rama I don't<br>think he was envisaging that but that's<br>what he got and he was very lovely and<br>explained about all the different um<br>that we could go to next door was an<br>opening of a park and we went oh yeah<br>okay we'll go to that too and the<br>children had to sit and listen and one<br>of the children they talked for a really<br>you know<br>but you know it was I thought it was a<br>great experience for them a lot of um<br>Park our children they don't have the<br>experience of going on to manai and<br>listening to if I called it or want more<br>tear tear and everything that goes with<br>it and during that we learned about the<br>eels being the kaitiaki of the queen we<br>didn't know that so again right place<br>right home<br>yako has been a a window to<br>um laitarangi that we have<br>and this is fire Stacy who's come on our<br>trips with us so that's lovely too and<br>that all all adds to our our knowledge<br>and in the integral person here is Dean<br>flavor chairman of the mole trust he has<br>no idea I think how pivotal his call it<br>all was and somehow I wanted to show him<br>but we'll get there well actually can I<br>just say about Dean if you want to write<br>this down<br>um on a u k a h a news yesterday there's<br>a piece about people going tomorrow and<br>to facing the um place names that are<br>written and it's only the place in 180<br>or Maori that have been debased so a u k<br>this has been a journey eight years in<br>the making in earlier years we stumbled<br>by good luck to meet up with people such<br>as Jake Thatcher who gifted us with<br>nuggets of gold adding to our knowledge<br>of Moa<br>the arrival of Linda Mitchell<br>the researchers and the teacher research<br>and leading initiative we were<br>challenged to connect consult and<br>consider the views of tangatura<br>once received it was our job to<br>integrate their values into our practice<br>I also didn't I don't know why it's not<br>there we need to strongly<br>thank Catherine rolleston our head<br>teacher for leading this with passion<br>and determination and taking us boldly<br>into places we did not want to go and it<br>would not have happened without a<br>and uh succinctly this is some of the<br>changes we think we have made over the<br>time<br>um<br>our hiding are no longer just a walk in<br>the fresh air we feel like we have<br>connected<br>thank you so much for sharing the<br>stories of your very precious place and<br>especially the ones of the children<br>they're really beautiful thank you so<br>much how they View and invis envisage<br>their space and where they belong and<br>everything that you do and all together<br>as a community is just fascinating and<br>beautiful you get goosebumps you hear<br>their stories it's gorgeous thank you so<br>much we've opened it up to um the people<br>here for um questions<br>um on chat I did get a comment on Chuck<br>that says that it was such a Dreamland<br>to um your journey that you've shared<br>and it was amazing to see your journey<br>in the photos the photos were really<br>powerful in in conveying everything that<br>you've been talking about today so thank<br>you for sharing that any questions from<br>thank you<br>is anyone out there doing anything like<br>this<br>perhaps you were inspiring a lot of<br>people to start from Monday<br>I think I I truly believe y'all<br>The Key to Our Success has been going to<br>places<br>instead of putting ourselves into places<br>that we could easily say oh no nothing<br>more is too hard anymore<br>we've got warning tea to consider<br>I think I think it's beautiful though<br>you know your stories are you you're<br>you're the narrative's the beginning as<br>well for your Center and and how that's<br>extended through<br>um the things that are passionate not<br>only for the children but for your team<br>as well thank you and I think everything<br>that's that's there just just really<br>shows that and I think you mentioned<br>time as well teachers and things like<br>that I mean time is is ever demanded<br>isn't it so I think having that you know<br>real determination and that<br>um you know that sort of um will and<br>want to to to bring those experiences to<br>the forefrontal forward to Children and<br>Families is credit two years I mean to<br>say that when when the children start<br>with us they'll often talk about and<br>their families will often talk about<br>going to the mount<br>and we change that we we very<br>deliberately change that so by the time<br>the children leave they and their far no<br>correct which is great just last week<br>the child came into and said are we<br>going to Mel out here I mean<br>yeah bye-bye<br>that's it because I hear Bad<br>pronunciation out there in the community<br>um<br>pick up 10 others probably and maybe<br>there are others I can't I got that have<br>regular excuses of our kindergartens<br>you've been keen on probably I could I<br>could name now<br>um well I have noticed a trend not not<br>so much but from what I hear across the<br>sector is that uh<br>the ministry requirements around<br>Excursion for now making<br>um people go we can't bother anymore<br>because because of the extensive<br>three-page form<br>having to fill out I mean and I know<br>health and safety is being prepared when<br>you see that when you see the benefits<br>that you've got here I think this should<br>be a balance should at least be a<br>balancer<br>one little quick question on chat that's<br>just popped up<br>um it's from Mary we are in danger of<br>losing it it will be built on we are on<br>a mission to save it to any advice<br>discussions</p></main><footer style="margin-top: 2rem; background: #0001; padding:
