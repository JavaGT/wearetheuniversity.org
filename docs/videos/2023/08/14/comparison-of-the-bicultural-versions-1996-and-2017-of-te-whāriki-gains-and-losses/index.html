am a fourth<br>generation parking High New Zealander<br>I've been in education for around 58<br>years used as a primary teacher and then<br>an early childhood<br>I'm now pretty much retired um just<br>finishing up a couple of students Theses<br>but I've continued to maintaining just<br>in early childhood education<br>iniquity and gender and this is a very<br>much a worthless progress so just that<br>we've been a background about<br>1840 by the indigenous<br>um and the crown and it is the basis of<br>the bicultural curriculum<br>um as we have enacted it through<br>tofaniki EC was the first sector to<br>explore and embrace the bicultural<br>curriculum and the process of developing<br>the first national Early Childhood<br>curriculum as we heard from Helen today<br>was very much in close partnership with<br>Maori which was unusual back in the late<br>80s early 90s<br>and I noticed on practicum visits to<br>students how much their students and the<br>associate teachers struggled to<br>implement them by heart doctor Academy<br>and that became the basis of my doctoral<br>research which I started officially<br>around 2004 with actually working with<br>symptoms<br>and it's still prevalent today Australia<br>and as we saw from Helen's presentation<br>the struggle is still there as somebody<br>noted in the review of the refresh the<br>faraki<br>so this was you know this is what led to<br>my doctoral research and I looked at the<br>and specifically at the principles and<br>streams in like hello I too have a kind<br>of a yearning for the very first draft<br>in 93 which did include<br>Pacific special needs<br>um and yeah I have a real yearning for<br>that um and my copy got borrowed and not<br>returned and I you know<br>but I was part working for barnardos at<br>that time so we started you know<br>implementing the drought and trialing it<br>out and then when I moved to the organ<br>College of Education crash<br>um we continue that Journey<br>so this is a comparative study so I took<br>the work that I've done looking at what<br>is there in the baraki in the<br>1996 version what was there that<br>actually had anything to do with the<br>bicultural curriculum so what what were<br>we actually be indicted to implement<br>and<br>and so I analyzed that and now I've just<br>gone back and looked at that and<br>compared the 1996 with the 2017 and<br>developed at that second table of um<br>aspects of the vicultural curriculum<br>and I looked at the structure of both<br>documents<br>so initial findings according to the<br>Ministry of Education to Fargo is the<br>aspiration for children the bicultural<br>structure principles strands and goals<br>remain the same but the updated version<br>includes a stronger focus on bicultural<br>practice the importance of the language<br>cultural identity and the collusion<br>inclusion of all children and I wanted<br>to see if that was actually accurate<br>so my investigation and comparative<br>reflection notes the addition of color<br>and the photographs do enhance the<br>readability of the document and<br>illustrate many of the ethnicities of<br>children now attending Early Childhood<br>Services and I thought that was you know<br>a real gain I think the use of the word<br>kayako is a work of addition to sort of<br>encompasses the many roles that adults<br>in An Early Childhood Center<br>the theoretical underpinnings of the<br>2000 version have 17 version they've<br>expanded to include the Copa Amari<br>though I noticed that that comes last<br>like<br>if we really<br>be really committed to bicultural I<br>think we need to put Toreo first because<br>the indigenous language that was here<br>first and Maori is the add-on or the<br>sometimes translation and to me it<br>should have been the same with the<br>theories if we're truly committed to<br>that by cultural then Copa Amari<br>theories should have been forefronted in<br>the discussion on the theory that<br>includes the socioculture of vygosky and<br>Bruno as well as the retaining the<br>bronch from Brenner the biological<br>Center and the wrongful rental one is<br>also rather enhanced brought from Bruno<br>including his later work on the<br>inclusion of time and the Chronos<br>section chroma section<br>um<br>I think it's probably a better move to<br>have a section for Colorado<br>um<br>rather than kind of adding it almost as<br>an afterthought in the 1996 version<br>you know you had the English strands and<br>then you'd have something for gamma Rayo<br>so yeah in fact it's probably not for me<br>to decide whether it is a better version<br>having the two separate but that is<br>you have to be I feel very mindful<br>one of the things I did when I did my<br>doctoral research was to have a Maori<br>advisory committee to guide me through<br>the process of what I was doing for fear<br>I trample where I shouldn't be and so<br>I'm mindful of the lessons I learned in<br>that process very reminiscent of what<br>you were talking about yeah just as I<br>saw oh and I'll come to the end<br>okay<br>so the foregrounding of the third of<br>your waitangi at the beginning rather<br>than three to three does<br>provide that useful framework but it's<br>no longer woven through the principle<br>and strands<br>so I think it would have been nice to<br>have headphones<br>more than nice I think it's probably<br>essential<br>after the<br>after the page overview of the treaty<br>it's rather ignored and was noted by<br>scared and Richie that the treaty is not<br>mentioned again in safariki until the<br>paragraph towards the end of the<br>document which links it to the school<br>called the Killer<br>and and given that it's because of<br>fertility or waitangi we have a<br>bicultural curriculum that does seem to<br>make it<br>less important than it is<br>the structure of the far care in 1996<br>was represented as a flat power<br>structure with player one end English at<br>the other the 2017 one I think<br>privileges English by putting it first<br>with the torreo afterwards<br>but the use of color does enhance the<br>depiction of the falcon<br>so you can see all the way I'm<br>struggling and I'm a bit excited about<br>some of the changes and struggling with<br>some of them and not sure we've got that<br>by cultural balance<br>um<br>right yet and I don't think we have we<br>had item 96 and I don't think we've got<br>so I've done a little bit more analysis<br>and I looked at spirituality in<br>particular because what I what came from<br>my doctoral research and I collected the<br>data with um three Early Childhood<br>centers<br>one was a kindergartener and what was<br>then a rural area to teach a<br>kindergarten in a rural area or city<br>rural area one was a mixed age range<br>center<br>um<br>and the owner had two or three centers<br>so I I was looking for a corporate<br>center but after about nine months of<br>being turned down by the corporate<br>centers I gave up on that<br>um<br>and the third one was a center connected<br>to a hospital<br>right in the inner Center and that was<br>the segregated<br>so you had your under two zero over twos<br>and your<br>um<br>year threes and fours and quite separate<br>rooms and I worked with the baby so I<br>then had that kind of a spread of the<br>kindergarten which then was only threes<br>and three and four-year-olds the babies<br>the under twos and the mixed range that<br>covered a bit of everything but was very<br>and spirituality when that research came<br>out very much as lacking it was where<br>teachers shied away from it they didn't<br>know what to do with it<br>um and so their way around it was really<br>just ignore it<br>I don't think that's changed from what<br>you were saying in your talk uh yeah I<br>can see that that's still understood<br>there's only one statement that is<br>exactly the same from the 1996 and 2017<br>and manure on belonging knowledge about<br>the features of the area of physical and<br>or spiritual significance you see<br>there's an awe there to the local<br>community<br>it is situated in the learning outcomes<br>in 1996 and in the Learning and<br>Development in 2017 so pretty much the<br>same eight statements on spirituality in<br>96 and in 2017.<br>five in 2017 and 2 and 96 are about in<br>terms of physical emotional cultural<br>spiritual so it's kind of an add-on<br>um and five in 1996 and three in 2007 on<br>holistic development which again I think<br>is<br>kind of an add-on what's also missing in<br>the English version overall<br>not so much spirituality is the<br>depiction of the bicultural curriculum<br>in action which if you look at the<br>photos in the Maori flip part there's a<br>lot of photos that depict the curriculum<br>in action which I think would be really<br>useful<br>in the English version<br>in the English because they're not<br>versions of each other they're different<br>curriculum but in the English group<br>so that's just listed some of the<br>just that are there showing children<br>actually enacting the bicultural<br>curriculum<br>and there's the references so<br>the questions<br>comedy to do anything that was perfect<br>you know because this is an ongoing<br>research I'd be really interested to<br>hear what you have to say in fact I'm<br>going to come and sit down I feel I<br>don't actually like me<br>I much prefer that this<br>thank you for sharing this study this<br>comes from Tahira Afrin who's on your<br>line she says thank you for sharing this<br>to me I noticed that your game list does<br>not have the relevant whakatoki that was<br>added in 2017 version it adds to the<br>bicultural lens throughout the document<br>which is again what is your thoughts<br>around this<br>okay so I haven't got to hear a lovely<br>thank you for going there and can you<br>email this thing<br>um<br>I've missed that completely innocent so<br>thank you for that I will go back and<br>is it helping your bicultural I think<br>that's why we went to if I've come to<br>fast because we could Escape<br>why I'd be very interested to hear if<br>anyone in the room has had any for card<br>or around the change of the pattern of<br>the father King and also<br>what people's thoughts are about the<br>inclusion of kopapamani theory making it<br>much more explicit that there is a<br>theory-based set us to drive the way we<br>interact with Tamara kimadi now<br>I love the publication that you've<br>completed I don't think so when you say<br>that the verdictions with my teachers in<br>the field I don't think it's understood<br>and<br>um I think we could do with professional<br>development that helps us frame<br>help them help us understand them to<br>sorry I'm talking yeah no no I do thank<br>you okay the inclusion of the cup of<br>Maori aspect<br>Theory only opens<br>the door to what is out there and I<br>think that there needs to be more I'm<br>pleased it's there but it's only sort of<br>opening the door to say hey look there<br>fantastic<br>um<br>yeah but it at least it's under I<br>suppose</p></main><footer style="margin-top: 2rem; background: #0001; padding: 2rem; text-align: center;"><p>We Are The
