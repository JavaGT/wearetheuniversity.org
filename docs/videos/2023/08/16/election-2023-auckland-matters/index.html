election debate with four of the country’s liveliest MPs, all alumni, from across the political spectrum, on how to sort the big issues affecting Aotearoa’s largest city.</p><h2>Transcript</h2><p style="opacity: 0.9; font-size: 0.8em">Transcripts may be automatically generated and may not be 100% accurate.</p><p>foreign<br>we are very privileged today to be<br>joined by four prominent and successful<br>members of parliament<br>Shannon Brooke Chloe and Simeon thank<br>you for returning to your alma mater<br>today<br>this city is going backwards under this<br>government and needs change National<br>will get Auckland back on track by<br>delivering the infrastructure we need so<br>this city can get back on track but we<br>all know that for many many years and<br>decades we've been impacted by<br>congestion in the city in Tamaki Makoto<br>and that's exactly why our government<br>has invested in a lined up integrated<br>transport network from one end of<br>Auckland to the other we have the people<br>we have the talent we have the capacity<br>Innovation but we have not made the<br>decisions over the past few decades that<br>have enabled those things to flourish<br>that is why I am super proud of the fact<br>that we continue to advocate for<br>evidence-based policies for people in<br>Planet and I'm looking forward to<br>getting into it everywhere in our<br>society is a feeling of anxiousness and<br>hopelessness because our country is<br>going backwards we've got to rebalance<br>crime and Law and Order so our streets<br>are safe again<br>so the first thing that we have to do is<br>investigate how we're building this city<br>and we have to be honest with ourselves<br>as a country are we willing to pay for<br>that it means looking at sponge cities<br>and again these examples of this stuff<br>overseas and here in zamiki Makoto half<br>of our admissions profile comes from<br>transport so what we need is<br>evidence-based policy it's great for<br>everybody and it builds community that<br>in turn is also a massive co-benefit for<br>reducing crime we do need better<br>infrastructure investment and I think<br>the flooding this earlier this year made<br>it really apparent how poor our Auckland<br>infrastructure is we can't be world<br>leaders and make ourselves economically<br>vulnerable it's just not a sustainable<br>position suddenly you can pay for all of<br>the infrastructure that you want and<br>that you can mitigate and adapt but you<br>don't have a plan to actually pay for it<br>so you can have all these dreams that<br>ain't going to work if you don't have a<br>productive economy where people can get<br>a job and actually get ahead pay tax and<br>contribute to that the thing is National<br>wants all the infrastructure in the<br>world right they don't have a plan to<br>pay for it and under their tax cut<br>scheme they won't be able to pay for the<br>infrastructure that our city requires<br>they've got no plan in place Auckland<br>council is enabled our Council to get<br>out a locally LED response to categorize<br>the needs of every single impacted<br>household in auckland's posts flood well<br>first and foremost we're committed to<br>the emissions trading scheme which<br>prices and caps emissions in the economy<br>and ultimately will be the biggest<br>driver for change to reduce emissions in<br>New Zealand in New Zealand it takes an<br>average of eight years to get a consent<br>to build a wind farm it only takes two<br>years to build it eight years to consent<br>it we're never going to become 100<br>renewal or energy or even close if those<br>rules and regulations aren't dealt with<br>that's the reality your bold Leadership<br>Center would be done to mount roskill by<br>2021 it hasn't even left the first<br>station that compares to your plan that<br>doesn't have a plan well we started we<br>started<br>thank you that's the answer it's<br>reallocate Road space look at the rapid<br>transit Network we are looking at moving<br>people around our city and if that is<br>our primary focus then we can't solely<br>focus on the means of Cars one way I<br>think would work is to actually price<br>roads correctly remove the fuel tax<br>and add congestion charging so that<br>people actually have real accurate times<br>for the cost of the road we do have to<br>invest in more roads if we want more<br>free-flowing traffic and the way that we<br>get safer more efficient roads built is<br>allowing for infrastructure companies to<br>come in build roads and for us to toll<br>them over time our transport plan made<br>it very clear we do need to invest in<br>Rapid Transit we also need to invest in<br>roads because we have a growing<br>population so we agree with the Egg<br>party around the need for congestion<br>charging the government's bill on that<br>was a bit of a dog you walked away it<br>was a bit of a dog we never actually got<br>a final copy anyway from it we never got<br>a final copy and and then your minister<br>changed three times so who's I don't I<br>mean it's hard to keep up with it you're<br>supporting congestion pricing now works<br>in our policy was it that close if<br>you've just been given a copy<br>we wrote<br>so I've learned something at least from<br>you today around the issues but you<br>always do that but but the point is uh<br>don't don't blame us because you've had<br>three Ministers of Transport in three<br>months no you keep on walking away from<br>critical things water infrastructure<br>congestion prices we haven't what was<br>the other housing housing we haven't<br>were you involved in starting pro-life<br>on campus I was yeah so I remember that<br>there was the Barney where ausa which at<br>that point Adina Williams is current<br>labor MP wanted to disaffiliate pro-life<br>on campus started by Simeon Brown and I<br>oh</p></main><footer style="margin-top: 2rem; background: #0001; padding: 2rem; text-align:
