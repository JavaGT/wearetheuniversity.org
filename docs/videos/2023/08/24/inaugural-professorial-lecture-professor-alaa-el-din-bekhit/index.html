Beckett's<br>achievements<br>I would like to especially welcome<br>um Aladdin's family who have been with<br>us tonight in person his wife Yuko and<br>daughters Layla and Jasmine<br>I'd also like to extend a warm welcome<br>to as many family members friends and<br>colleagues who are watching this event<br>online<br>it's not easy to become a professor at<br>the University otago<br>the title or Professor is reserved for<br>the highest performing academics it<br>takes ability commitment hard work and<br>time to become a professor<br>I had the pleasure of working in an<br>office beside her Latin for over 15<br>years and I have seen firsthand his<br>commitment to research to a student<br>to the Department of Food Science and to<br>the University of otago<br>Aladdin has clearly earned the title of<br>Professor<br>as you were here tonight he has had a<br>stellar research and publication career<br>and it's still ongoing he is a great<br>publication record which has been<br>achieved through hundreds of hours of<br>work in the lab and thousands of hours<br>tapping away on a keyboard that I've<br>heard through the walks of our offices<br>a feature of Aladdin's research is the<br>strong and enduring research<br>collaboration he develops which is a<br>fantastic indicator of the high esteem<br>in which he has held in the research<br>community<br>Aladdin is also a dedicated teacher and<br>supervisor who works tirelessly to<br>ensure that her students have the<br>support they need to succeed<br>he is incredibly loyal to and protective<br>and supportive of his postgraduate<br>students<br>and many students owe their success to<br>having the wisdom to have chosen him as<br>a supervisor<br>I now invite the profile's chance of<br>division of science Professor Richard<br>friends and colleagues tenakoto tenakoto<br>katoa<br>it is my great pleasure to introduce our<br>speaker tonight Professor Aladdin<br>Beckett from the Department of Food<br>Science to give this inaugural<br>professorial lecture at the University<br>of otago as indicated by Professor<br>Bremer Aladdin was promoted to Professor<br>in February of this year and tonight we<br>get to celebrate this significant<br>achievement<br>Professor Beckett grew up in the ancient<br>Mediterranean port city of Alexandria<br>Aladdin's parents who did not have any<br>formal education were strong Believers<br>in education<br>and provided complete support for their<br>children throughout their education<br>Journeys this resulted in<br>five siblings with phds in addition to<br>Aladdin's and another six with at least<br>one MSC there are more in some cases in<br>various disciplines in The Sciences<br>after receiving his Bachelor of Science<br>with honors from Alexandria University<br>he undertook a masters in food<br>technology at the University of reading<br>after a period of time as a research<br>assistant and associate back home in the<br>in his at the University of Alexandria<br>in the department of Food Science and<br>Technology Aladdin started his PhD at<br>Lincoln University here in New Zealand<br>he reports that he actually applied to<br>both Lincoln and Massey<br>he got approval and started his PhD at<br>Lincoln within three weeks of applying<br>and he got an acceptance letter from<br>NASA University more than a year after<br>he applied and was halfway through his<br>PhD program<br>there is a lesson in that for us here at<br>the University of otago<br>after a stint as a research scientist at<br>AG research Aladdin started his academic<br>career at Lincoln University as a<br>lecturer before joining the University<br>of otago as a senior lecturer in 2008.<br>as we have heard promotion to the<br>position of full professor<br>at University of otago is far from Easy<br>you must excel in all of the academic<br>domains teaching research and service<br>as already alluded to by<br>his colleague Phil our Deputy Vice<br>Chancellor academic Aladdin is a<br>productive researcher and his research<br>has impact he currently has 275 Journal<br>articles to his name and a further 58<br>book chapters as well as two patents<br>this is a truly impressive level of<br>output<br>as a measure of impact he was awarded a<br>pbrfa in the 2018 assessment round I<br>guess that means there was no a plus<br>and he won the outstanding researcher<br>award for the division of Sciences in<br>2022. in 2017 he was awarded to Tian<br>Chen medal for services in supporting<br>development at the xinjiang autonomous<br>region in China<br>as a teacher Aladdin contributes at all<br>levels in the department<br>he has also won a number of awards for<br>this teaching these include a university<br>of otago top 10 supervisor award in 2010<br>and again in 2016. a nomination for the<br>otago University Students Association<br>supervisor of the year in 2011.<br>in a disability awareness and inclusive<br>teaching award in 2016.<br>from these Awards it is clear that<br>Aladdin's teaching is characterized by<br>his Excellence as a supervisor and his<br>care for his students in this experience<br>has been enjoyed by 22 completed PhD<br>students 19 completed Masters students<br>in a further 27 honors and postgraduate<br>for service Professor Beckett has a<br>heavy focus on external engagement and<br>this includes his work as a consultant<br>to the New Zealand Halal committee the<br>Federation of Islamic Association<br>associations of New Zealand<br>which he has done since 2012 and in this<br>role he provides consultancy on<br>production systems in New Zealand and<br>their compliance to Halal certification<br>he is one of three people in New Zealand<br>advising the Halal Auditors and<br>committee on Halal status and aspects<br>that control New Zealand food exports to<br>he is an associate executive director<br>academic engagement for the Asia Pacific<br>Institute of food professionals and has<br>been in this role since 2015. he is the<br>vice chair of the international<br>Commission of Agriculture and bio<br>engineer bio systems engineering a role<br>he's held since 2013.<br>and for this and all of his work he has<br>been awarded honorary professorial at<br>and adjunct positions by the Chinese<br>Academy of agricultural Sciences as a<br>distinguished professor and<br>distinguished supervisor since 2000<br>F-15 the xinjiang Agriculture University<br>from 2012 to 2019 as a distinguished<br>professor<br>King sword University since 2017 as an<br>honorary professor in Lincoln University<br>here in New Zealand since 2012 as an<br>Adjunct professor<br>guiding his career has been the simple<br>concept that someone's waste is another<br>person's Fortune<br>it is now time to hear about this<br>passion for turning waste into something<br>better from Professor Beckett himself<br>please join me in welcoming Professor<br>Aladdin Beckett<br>Bismillah<br>by the name of Allah the most gracious<br>thank you very much Professor Barker and<br>Professor primer for the introduction<br>today I would like to share with you my<br>journey regarding the research that I've<br>been doing and the career I established<br>through more than 25 years as a<br>lecturer and progressing in various<br>academic positions<br>but before I do that I would like just<br>to make a<br>a declaration many of my colleagues this<br>asked me actually what I'm eating in the<br>picture<br>some suggested candy floss some<br>suggested pasta or noodles but actually<br>this is wool and we will hear very<br>um<br>first I would like to introduce myself<br>so my name is but because it's too long<br>a long name in English Aladdin is just<br>short for that and I enjoy my friends<br>and colleagues calling me Aladdin<br>I have been involved in research since<br>1992 at various levels from first year<br>up to Masters and PhD<br>I have formal training in engineering<br>food processing and biochemistry so I<br>did my bachelor degree in beautiful<br>Alexandria University<br>and I was specialized in agricultural<br>engineering<br>then I did my masters at the University<br>of reading<br>I specialized in food process<br>engineering<br>I also I did a postgraduate diploma in<br>refrigeration and canning in the<br>beautiful University of hambaside in<br>Grimsby<br>it is claimed to be Europe's foot town<br>but it's very much similar to Dunedin<br>very very beautiful place<br>and I did my PhD in Biochemistry at<br>Lincoln University which I consider it<br>so I provide surface on the behalf of<br>the university to wide range of<br>institutes as well as serving on several<br>editorial board the most important one<br>is food chemistry which is considered as<br>so as Professor Barker and Professor<br>primer mentioned I enjoy writing and<br>science communication so I contributed<br>lots of studies specialized in food<br>processing food safety and food<br>chemistry and I contributed five books<br>to the food science Library I enjoy<br>writing and communication and sharing<br>knowledge which is really I try to<br>enforce in all my students as well<br>uh University sorry from Alexandria<br>University<br>and my family actually came from this<br>small red dot here it's government<br>called suhag south of Egypt very much<br>related to hospitality being you know<br>doing 150 percent effort and don't give<br>up on whatever you do so with this all<br>Traditional Values we moved to<br>Alexandria<br>and Alexandria is beautiful<br>Mediterranean city<br>that is regarded as a multicultural<br>Melting Pot Roman<br>Persian Greek French British Turks they<br>all come and gun and when they left they<br>left lots of their cultural heritage and<br>Alexandria is just Melting Pot of all<br>these cultures and traditions<br>so I came up or I grew up in in that<br>environment<br>so in Alexandria it's not very uncommon<br>within the stream Street you will find a<br>church a mosque and a synagogue in the<br>same place<br>the significance of that will come very<br>shortly<br>so in terms of my research portfolio I<br>I'm interested in identifying emerging<br>research opportunities that is related<br>to improving the quality of food<br>as well as exploring opportunity to add<br>value to<br>co-product or by-products so I aim<br>always to introduce original research<br>and try to devise novel and innovative<br>solutions<br>in the last 10 years or so I also tried<br>to focus on<br>looking at the environmental impact of<br>food production as well as the impact of<br>environment on the foods that we consume<br>because we are not just only what we eat<br>but also what we are exposed to<br>um<br>so in terms of my research<br>themes that I've been involved over the<br>last 28 years or so<br>mostly focusing around food Health<br>one of the main<br>passions for me as a researcher is to<br>reduce waste and improve the utilization<br>of core products so while I was in<br>Alexandria<br>most of my research was aiming at<br>improving the eating quality of<br>underutilized fish species also<br>improving the functionality and<br>nutrition of food<br>and we will describe some of this very<br>shortly<br>also since I came to New Zealand I<br>started to realize that there is great<br>opportunity that lie within the winery<br>sector the seafood sector and I did lots<br>of research looking at opportunity to<br>improve this material and create value<br>as well as prospecting for by active<br>compound<br>uh we did also some research which I<br>will communicate very shortly looking at<br>the utilization of shellfish which is a<br>major problem for the meeting for the<br>fish industry and we try to create value<br>as well as looking at opportunity to<br>improve it is management and impact on<br>very recently we start to look at<br>alternative proteins<br>by meaning recently it's just in the<br>last 10 years or so so we'll start to<br>look at Edible proteins from edible<br>insects from wool as I will share with<br>you very shortly<br>as well as looking at the utilization of<br>blood and proteins extracted from seed<br>cakes that has been used<br>or generated from oil industry<br>uh<br>I was very interested in looking at<br>opportunity to utilize the snails<br>specially Marine snails and for me<br>protein is just opportunity to generate<br>bioactive compounds so any protein once<br>it's been digested it will start to<br>generate a wide range of peptides these<br>peptides has the ability to modulate<br>functionality of certain Pathways and<br>that's what attract me or excite me<br>looking at what the tide generated from<br>what material can be leading to what<br>effect in our bodies<br>I also<br>contributed wide range of new product<br>development research programs either<br>through funded research or through<br>supervision of students I was also<br>interested in food safety where I was<br>involved in wide range of studies<br>looking at nutritional<br>and antimicrobial opportunity lying from<br>peptides that generated from the waste<br>material that I mentioned before looking<br>at the formation of methylated amines in<br>need<br>as well as looking at pesticides and<br>environmental pollutants that normally<br>sneak and find their way in our Foods<br>I was lucky enough to be in New Zealand<br>New Zealand it's a wonderful place where<br>opportunities just in our hand grasps so<br>I came up with a concept of uh using<br>deer milk and that was a dream or an<br>idea that was<br>started in 2008 it was very fulfilling<br>to see that we have deer milk industry<br>established in 2018 and we have milk<br>product in the market so my research was<br>about developing the industry looking at<br>different ways to identify opportunity<br>and health benefit in the in their milk<br>and we actually had our first<br>application and funding by the help of<br>Dr Craig Grant in 2010.<br>I was the principal investigator at<br>otago University looking at sheep milk<br>that was a project that funded by MB for<br>six years with the help of Alan Khan and<br>Michelle McConnell we did excellent job<br>over six years investigating the<br>potential health benefit in sheep milk<br>and the most probably I'm known for is<br>mid quality so I spend a good part of my<br>research Journey looking at the<br>biochemistry of meat with the aim of<br>improving it is quality safety as well<br>okay since I came from Egypt I would<br>like to<br>use the help of the Sphinx so the Sphinx<br>is a mythological and mystical creature<br>that<br>play with one's mind because it speaks<br>in riddles<br>so the riddles for today is basically<br>what is a cure and a poison<br>and the answer for that is<br>the pharmacon so pharmacann is a concept<br>that is referred to<br>when we are having the opposite<br>qualities in the same object so<br>something like good and bad at the same<br>time or something that can cause cure<br>and poison so there is no one does that<br>the discipline of pharmacology came from<br>the world of pharmakon because it is<br>true that in every medicine there is a<br>bit of poison or risk associated with<br>that<br>so for me food is basically<br>probably the oldest pharmacon because<br>with food<br>too much or too little can lead to<br>either better health or the opposite of<br>that in fact last last week we had the<br>news coming from the states that there<br>is a lady she actually passed away<br>because she drank too much water<br>something that is considered the most<br>safe thing to to consume<br>so indeed food is considered the the<br>most important uh<br>cause for health or for disease<br>so there is no wonder that the Egyptian<br>started to Perfect The Art of preserving<br>the food make it healthy as well as make<br>it more appealing<br>and some of these techniques for food<br>preservation are taught in some subject<br>that taught by our colleagues here<br>especially beer making as Professor<br>primer often refer to in his lectures<br>about Brewing<br>so<br>this type of environment where<br>preservation is considered something<br>important and actually a duty for<br>everyone that has access to food it is<br>no one does that we don't waste anything<br>where I came from<br>so the concept of do not waste is not<br>just entrenched as a culture there is a<br>religious obligation that is actually<br>stated very clearly in the three main<br>religions that found in in Egypt so the<br>majority of Muslims they have very clear<br>declaration that God do not<br>like or God doesn't like the waste food<br>so preservation of food and not wasting<br>in general is considered as Duty and<br>religious obligation the same can be<br>said about coptics and people believe in<br>Christianity we have Jewish people used<br>to live in Egypt for many years<br>and they have this commandment of<br>beltashkrit which is basically<br>mostly applied on<br>preservation of<br>Nature and houses when they are invading<br>other places but the the interpretation<br>of the concept can be applied about not<br>wasting food as well as not wasting any<br>something that is potentially useful for<br>human<br>when I did my bachelor degree I came<br>across<br>lots of images either on TV or in<br>newspaper about the frequent famine that<br>was hitting Africa during the 80s and<br>90s<br>and images like this make you think<br>twice about<br>how fortunate we have access to whatever<br>can sustain us and you will find it<br>actually<br>some sort of a crime to be<br>wasting valuable resources<br>so this image is kept in my mind that<br>actually made me to think about how<br>important for me to start a career in<br>the food industry so after<br>an army<br>Duty that was probably more than what<br>I've hoped for so normally in Egypt we<br>spend one year if you have high<br>education I was lucky enough to have my<br>Army surface during or just before the<br>first Gulf War the Desert Storm so<br>because my my my group was among the<br>people who trained for The Invasion or<br>liberation of Kuwait they kept us a<br>little bit longer than that but the<br>dream of working in food production<br>uh it was still at the back of my mind<br>after I finished my Army surface I was<br>lucky enough to<br>find this book which was available in<br>1991 this is an inspiring book written<br>by a professor in El Khartoum University<br>in Sudan<br>and in that book he was describing the<br>fact that<br>many<br>millions of lives were saved during the<br>famine episodes because mothers were<br>using<br>animal hide and Bones to sustain their<br>children<br>so even something that we normally<br>consider in edible or not fit for use<br>can be utilized and can save life<br>so taking this in my mind I started my<br>research Journey as a researcher<br>associate at Alexandria University I did<br>most of my research in Alexandria fish<br>Technology Center where I was looking at<br>fish species that are not popular<br>something like carb for example so carb<br>is<br>what we considered as Pig of fresh water<br>where it will eat anything and the meat<br>of carb has some technological problems<br>so it has lots of fine bones that make<br>it inedible plus it doesn't have too<br>much flavor and taste so I started my<br>research looking at different ways of<br>improving the eating quality trying to<br>generate different types of product that<br>can be accepted by consumers and by by<br>doing so we can actually have a good<br>source of protein just we improve it and<br>package it in a a way of that is<br>suitable to the consumer and so on so we<br>we have wide range of fish core product<br>or bycatch<br>which is not normally desirable by<br>consumers either because they are very<br>hard to uh to to to use like uh the the<br>shrimp-like uh uh Seafood here it's<br>called chikela which is basically very<br>very hard to build like people will<br>really will hurt their fingers if they<br>try to extract the meat from that so I<br>developed a wide range of food<br>processing strategies that generated<br>wide range of food products that was<br>commercially sold in the Alexandria fish<br>Technology Center<br>these are not the exact products that I<br>had because at the time we didn't have<br>ease of capturing pictures like digital<br>cameras at the time but they are<br>taken by my junior so I used to train<br>Hisham he's now a professor of fish<br>technology in Swiss University<br>and he sent me the exact product that I<br>taught him how to make in<br>1993 until 1995 98 sorry<br>uh I was lucky enough to obtain a master<br>and a Technical Training scholarships to<br>um to to to to do that in the United<br>Kingdom so I was awarded British<br>overseas development Administration<br>scholarships<br>I did my masters at the University of<br>reading it was one year Master uh six<br>months of extensive coursework followed<br>by five months of lab work and one month<br>to write the thesis<br>and I was lucky also to end up working<br>on uh buffing of potato cubes why<br>because we used products that was not<br>marketable something that is a regular<br>shape not accepted by consumers so we<br>looked at ways of adding value we<br>created buffed product which had much<br>better rehydration capability and long<br>shelf life and it was very useful<br>product when you are trying to send<br>overseas for emergencies or it sometimes<br>it can have some military meal<br>preparation potential<br>uh after finishing my Master's trading I<br>went to University of humberside to do a<br>refrigeration and canning training and<br>I was very very grateful for my basic<br>education at Alexandria University<br>we used to be asked as an undergraduate<br>to memorize and know<br>equations so when I did thermodynamics<br>and heat transfer we had to remember<br>about 300 equations<br>numerous dimensional list numbers those<br>who don't know the dimensional list<br>numbers they are frequently used in<br>calculation of refrigeration heat<br>transfer and so on<br>I was also very happy that I spent a big<br>chunk of my undergrad education having<br>mathematics courses so when I went to<br>reading and to humberside<br>I was I was probably one of the if you<br>who can break the code of equation<br>do lots of mathematic differentiation<br>integration and so on I was probably the<br>only student who remember the units of<br>all the physical properties that we are<br>dealing with so I was very grateful I<br>wasn't as grateful when I was<br>so I I got the opportunity to um<br>to apply for skilled immigration uh visa<br>to New Zealand that was in 1996. uh<br>leaving Egypt living family was a little<br>bit difficult so I I had the Visa in my<br>hand I was permanent resident of New<br>Zealand while I'm still in New Zea in<br>Egypt in Alexandria<br>and by 1998 I think it was in August or<br>July I got a letter from the immigration<br>saying if I'm not going to come to New<br>Zealand within three months I will lose<br>my Visa<br>and I went to visit my brother he's a<br>professor in of uh<br>uh organic chemistry and Medicinal<br>Chemistry so I used to have a<br>collaboration with him I used to do all<br>the screening for the drugs he<br>synthesized and I look at the<br>antimicrobial activity of the newly<br>created or synthesized drugs<br>and at the same time I meet Professor<br>farrelli he's an imminent scientist who<br>travels the world and was a fantastic<br>opportunity so when I met him and I had<br>a chat about being going to New Zealand<br>he was so excited he basically loved New<br>Zealand and he told me in his own words<br>New Zealand it is God's heaven on Earth<br>so he was<br>always about New Zealand and the people<br>I arrived New Zealand in 1998 end of<br>1998<br>somehow I went to Lincoln University<br>someone said oh go to Lincoln University<br>they have food studies and I went there<br>I met Professor Bika staff and he<br>advised me to apply and he asked me to<br>come and have part-time job so I started<br>working in his lab<br>the following day basically and I was<br>waiting until the enrollment to start in<br>1998 in February where I started<br>officially my PhD<br>so Professor Baker stuff<br>is very eminent scientist in the field<br>of meat science and he had a very good<br>group of researchers who are considered<br>at that time as a leading scientist in<br>the biochemistry of uh<br>muscles or meat<br>so his group basically focused on muscle<br>biochemistry and they were studying<br>group of enzymes known as kelpins so<br>kalpins is a large family of proteases<br>about 17 different proteases have been<br>identified they are found abundant in<br>throughout the body of human animals<br>they have Major Impact in terms of<br>health and we looked at them as as tools<br>to improve meat tenderness<br>so I found that most of the group is is<br>really focusing on meat tenderness I<br>tried to create my own Niche by looking<br>at uh<br>color so<br>uh my PhD title is a rule of made<br>myoglobin reducing activity and it is<br>rule in maintaining meat color why I<br>choose that through my initial research<br>I found that in the states there is<br>about one billion dollar of losses as a<br>result of meat discoloration<br>in New Zealand there was no information<br>about how much is a problem caused the<br>meat industry<br>but later on I came to know that it's<br>about seven to eight percent of most<br>zamid that is produced in New Zealand is<br>either discarded or discounted or it's<br>been transformed into another uh cheaper<br>product<br>so meat product uh<br>is evaluated mostly<br>at the point of sale based on the color<br>and consumer like the bright red cherry<br>color and they don't like the brown<br>color so consumer have the the<br>the tendency to discriminate against<br>brown meat Because he believes that it's<br>and I took it on on on<br>my shoulder to start to investigate the<br>biochemical base of this process<br>the problem is not really 100 solved but<br>current numbers or figures coming from<br>the states last year it just<br>demonstrates that the problem is still<br>relevant and it has a great impact on<br>the meat industry so I started by<br>looking at the various factors that are<br>involved in meat color and I looked at<br>the effect of indigenous factors that<br>are relevant to the animal itself or<br>environmental factors that can be<br>exerted during handling processing and<br>storage of meat<br>and I came to some information that have<br>been published in medical journals<br>relevant to human so the information was<br>demonstrating that<br>during our daily life about three<br>percent of our hemoglobin is oxidized as<br>a result of metabolic processes as well<br>as oxidative processes<br>and<br>based on that three percent<br>it is thought that<br>human any human should die after 33 days<br>because<br>oxidized hemoglobin is physiologic<br>physiologically inactive means that it<br>doesn't do any job<br>however this it doesn't happen so under<br>any<br>physiological<br>conditions uh healthy adult should have<br>less than 0.5 percent of the hemoglobin<br>in the oxidized form<br>so does that tell us that there is a<br>mechanism that is capable of converting<br>the oxidized hemoglobin into reduced<br>form<br>and this enzyme was found in in human<br>studies and identified to be cytochrome<br>B5<br>and cytochrome B5 has a cousin that is<br>capable of working on myoglobin in fact<br>myoglobin is more susceptible to<br>oxidation than hemoglobin because under<br>low<br>oxygen tension or pressure inside the<br>body myoglobin is much easier to oxidize<br>so that tells me that there is another<br>similar enzymatic system that is capable<br>of converting the oxidized myoglobin the<br>one responsible the protein responsible<br>for the apparent color into the reduced<br>form and that was basically the point<br>that I started to look at how I can use<br>this enzyme to convert the brown color<br>that is undesirable by consumer into the<br>deoxidized form that potentially can<br>maintain it is color and desirability<br>so I came to find<br>the enzymes that responsible for that as<br>I said it's a cytochrome B5 and I choose<br>that point as my research point<br>now I started with great hopes that this<br>enzyme is going to maintain the color<br>and improves the sale of meat and add<br>value to the meat industry<br>however after three and a half years of<br>research two years of this three and a<br>half years were locked in a walking<br>Chiller at five degrees<br>I discovered that the enzyme is not<br>doing what I thought to do<br>why because the situation under<br>physiological conditions where nutrition<br>nutrient and everything is tightly<br>contained in the animal body is<br>completely different once the meat is<br>generated which is completely different<br>pH completely different environment and<br>there is not much protection<br>so through my research I start to<br>observe that<br>methylglobin is working but it will be<br>more effective if we have antioxidant<br>signified by the red arrow here of Zhang<br>so zank is an antioxidant element and<br>the induction of anti of zinc it<br>improves the quality of the meat keeps<br>the color longer for a longer time<br>I finished my PhD I was very lucky to<br>get a a job at AG research in 2002<br>one year before I submit by my PhD so<br>I worked with with eminent researchers<br>in agresearch so<br>the center that I was working in is meet<br>Research Institute of New Zealand or<br>shortly named Marines so mirins is one<br>of<br>best four Research Center in the world<br>on meat studies and people used to join<br>Marines used to be a graduate from<br>Cambridge and top universities in<br>Bristol University and the top British<br>universities and University from the UK<br>uh<br>and I was really lucky to be working<br>with Clyde Daly Nikki Simmons Roger<br>Hertz and Mustafa Farooq I learned a lot<br>from these guys so when I was a student<br>I was excited by conducting one<br>experiment and spent six months<br>analyzing their samples with agresearch<br>it was like two tiles every week lots of<br>sample lots of research so I finished my<br>PhD with about eight papers published<br>that was nothing compared with what can<br>I get and generate with working with a<br>gear search<br>so in during my my one year at AG<br>research I managed to discover a<br>mechanism for the Regeneration of uh red<br>meat which is basically involved series<br>of vacuuming uh to reduce oxidation that<br>can cause the formation of oxidized<br>myoglobin as well as systems that can<br>enhance the generation of nadh which is<br>basically a cofactor for the enzymes<br>that I mentioned before cytochrome P5<br>so after one year with aggress wonderful<br>people however my heart is with teaching<br>as well as interaction with student so I<br>I<br>accepted an offer from Lincoln<br>University to go back and teach at<br>Lincoln<br>so during my uh my uh my time at Lincoln<br>University I was really interested in<br>examining oxidative systems that can<br>make the meat change in flavor changing<br>color change in acceptability in general<br>and I try to devise new technologies to<br>improve the quality in general as well<br>as meat tenderness because rejection of<br>meat tenderness can be either based on<br>color at sale or people will not consume<br>the meat if it's too tough to eat<br>also I had the liberty and the freedom<br>to seek other opportunities to add value<br>so I had a very active research group<br>looking at wine processing so I was<br>really interested in capturing the waste<br>that is generated with the aim of<br>extracting um<br>by active compounds to add value to this<br>West stream<br>as well as looking at opportunity to<br>respect for by active compound from wide<br>range of marine organisms<br>so I will not be able to cover<br>everything but I I had the vision of<br>using New Zealand solution to solve New<br>Zealand problems so we use that the<br>industry basically in New Zealand the<br>meat industry have issues with meat<br>tenderness they have issues with the<br>stability of the freshness of the meat<br>as indicated by Meat color as well as<br>sometimes have problem with the flavor<br>so gaming flavor was not really popular<br>or appreciated much<br>so I thought kiwi fruit can probably<br>solve this problem so we have kiwi fruit<br>is full of antioxidants that can solve<br>the problem of color stability<br>it can also add the fruity flavor to<br>modify the flavor of meat especially old<br>animals that can be<br>a little bit more more<br>strong flavor that's not accepted by<br>many of us as well as it has an enzyme<br>actinidine that can enhance the meat<br>tenderness<br>so we carried several tiles where we<br>looked at infusing<br>sheep with cure fruit juice and the<br>results are wonderful so that was in<br>2004<br>the technology has been implemented by a<br>company in the United States with more<br>technological advancements than what we<br>had so now they have an automated system<br>where they can Infuse solution into<br>carcasses of cows sheep and so on<br>so the outcome from the Key Food<br>infusion is that we obtained very very<br>tender meat after five hours of<br>postmortem normally it takes about a<br>week of Aging to achieve this level of<br>tenderness<br>so five five hours was great achievement<br>we could also<br>look at the biochemical basis for what<br>we observed and we found that infusion<br>with cure fruit juice which contains a<br>protease actinidine accelerated or<br>activated the kelpins that I mentioned<br>earlier that help in accelerating the<br>meat tenderness not only the tenderness<br>was improved the flavor the color<br>stability was also improved as well<br>uh I had the ability to visit some fish<br>companies in Christchurch there is three<br>big companies and talking to them I<br>realized that they have<br>lots of fish rolls that is produced at<br>different grades the maximum they can<br>get is about three dollars per kilogram<br>coming from the Mediterranean I know<br>that<br>we have the Mediterranean caviar botargo<br>a kilogram will be about 400 dollars<br>so we can have an opportunity to add<br>lots of value so I I had a a project<br>funded by<br>United Fisheries where we looked at the<br>production of wide range of<br>visual product for commercial<br>species so we generated something that<br>is having Japanese flavor like Hashim in<br>Taiko or karasumi we also generated<br>something that is like Mediterranean<br>caviar zabotago all which had a really<br>great future and opportunities to add<br>value however the industry is is not<br>taking the opportunity because it can<br>they can sell the product without<br>establishing further industrial<br>facilities to process the food but the<br>opportunities there so it was very<br>um<br>uneasy to see that<br>the industry sent frozen raw to China<br>for three dollars a kilo and in China<br>and Taiwan they convert it into<br>something that is more valuable<br>I joined I joined the University of<br>otago in 2008 and I started research<br>programs that looked at mid quality<br>recovery of bioactive compound from wide<br>range of<br>by-product and co-product including some<br>products from the seafood industry as<br>well as meat industry like blood for<br>example<br>also I start to focus on a key problem<br>for New Zealand which is basically the<br>production of shell from shellfish and<br>we looked at opportunity to add value to<br>muscle and kinashells as well as<br>establishing a program for alternative<br>proteins so for the sake of time I will<br>be just focusing on the last two<br>so<br>New Zealand has about 70 000 tons of<br>muscle chills that are produced every<br>year<br>they are considered to be environmental<br>problems they have of odors that<br>generated by piling them the industry<br>pay lots of money to dispose them and we<br>had the opportunity through a PhD<br>program by very very bright student<br>associate professor Amin chavandi he's<br>now in in Belgium<br>we started to look at opportunity to<br>convert shell<br>obtained from muscles into a very active<br>material known as<br>hydroxyapatite so hydroxypatite the<br>expert is here Professor George Diaz<br>iodox appetite is used for several<br>biomedical applications for bone<br>grafting and for treatment of teeth a<br>kilogram of bone grafting the high<br>Purity can be about hundred fifty<br>thousand dollars a kilogram<br>and we were able to produce 90 percent<br>of that quality for the cost of four<br>dollars<br>so there was a huge opportunity here<br>to add a lot of value and the process we<br>call it otago process was much much<br>easier it didn't cost us much to to<br>convert the the shells into Hydraulics<br>appetite<br>we looked at the Cana shells there is a<br>large amount of kineshills are produced<br>and it's considered to be environmental<br>problem<br>in fact there was every year one or two<br>uh fines<br>that being embossed on companies<br>disposing their kind of shields into the<br>sea on the environment and I think the<br>last one was about hundred twenty<br>thousand dollar fine for a company in<br>the south of the South Island<br>so we looked at opportunity to add value<br>and one of the opportunities were using<br>kenoshields as a natural porous<br>structure of hydroxyapatite normally to<br>use hydroxyapatite we have to create<br>biothermic and create artificially the<br>gaps in the uh in the Bible ceramic<br>however Nature has done that for us and<br>we had a much better sale growth as a<br>result of the natural pores that can be<br>found in the<br>Canadian shells<br>uh the last thing I would like to finish<br>is basically looking at the wool as I<br>promised before so looking at sheep wool<br>as a new alternative protein was<br>basically conceived by Professor Diaz I<br>was lucky to be one of the member he<br>could compiled to investigate the<br>opportunities to create edible wool<br>and the slides that we have here is<br>basically a screenshot from a slide that<br>I presented a lectures that I presented<br>to Boston graduate student at the<br>University of Melbourne last year so I<br>believe sheep which New Zealand has lots<br>of expertise and really lots of<br>knowledge about so when I was working<br>with agresearch we used to get calls and<br>requests to form European countries how<br>we deal with sheep farming what system<br>we have that can prevent<br>basitism or improve yield Etc so New<br>Zealand is is very very well at the top<br>of sheep farming<br>and<br>a meat quality from from sheep<br>so I believe that sheep is a great<br>animal that can contribute to uh farming<br>sustainability as well as<br>improving the potential of sheep as uh<br>future food source<br>so for sheep we get meat that is known<br>we get leather we get co-products not<br>very desirable in New Zealand but it's<br>very very popular overseas liver kidneys<br>type Etc very very popular overseas and<br>we can make good value out of it what<br>was not known at that time is milk so<br>sheep milk<br>started about 2014.<br>again Dr Craig Grant was really<br>instrumental in securing the funding for<br>sheep milk industry as well as helping<br>otago to be part of a bigger bid by MB<br>so I'm not going to talk about milk but<br>wool is a target so nowadays<br>and probably for the last<br>eight nine years<br>the prices of wool is really not<br>justifying the shearing of the wool from<br>the animal so it's really causing<br>losses for sheep farmers<br>and we started to look at wool as<br>potential source of protein because it<br>is a high source of protein available in<br>nature it's about 90 protein you cannot<br>get higher than that<br>we cannot digest wool but we have the<br>technology and capability of converting<br>wool into something that is digestible<br>and that's basically what we spent six<br>years working on and<br>we managed to be able to convert the<br>hard<br>undigested wool into a protein powders<br>that can be consumed<br>and the process itself has been patented<br>and looking at the protein profile<br>we can find that it's better in some<br>amino acids that are crucially important<br>for certain age groups and Nations<br>as well as it is slightly low on some of<br>the amino acid but doing a nutritional<br>balance we can generate very very<br>digestible and highly nutritional<br>protein<br>so a third series of studies<br>we were able to generate proteins that<br>cost less than 10 kilograms per 10<br>dollars per kilogram<br>and testing that protein in several<br>animal models we found that<br>it has no negative impact on the animal<br>it's very safe in fact we can see some<br>health benefits that can be visualized<br>by the local store level the low<br>triangle side level in the blood as well<br>as we can see that it can promote some<br>health positive health effects in human<br>through tiles that were conducted in<br>collaboration with a nutritional group<br>at Mercy University<br>Okay so<br>I would like to get some help from the<br>Sphinx as well<br>and as I said uh this is a real<br>rearendation of the famous riddles that<br>the swings ask audibles of Thieves so<br>the the Sphinx was asking what goes on<br>four legs in the morning two legs in the<br>afternoon and three legs in the evening<br>my intake on that is<br>what goes on many legs in the morning<br>one leg in the afternoon and many legs<br>in the evening<br>the answer is a researcher<br>so when we are doing a master of ptd we<br>would like to have as much help as<br>possible I was very lucky to have very<br>very supportive group at Lincoln<br>University<br>once I finished my PhD I felt like I can<br>do it on my own however time proves that<br>you still need lots of help in terms of<br>collaboration<br>who is colleagues and friends as well as<br>students that you supervise<br>so with that I would like to acknowledge<br>and thank the<br>collaborator at<br>otago University people who are<br>supported close supervision of students<br>in particular associate professor<br>Michelle McConnell Professor Jose and<br>associate professor of Alan Khan so we<br>we had very fruitful collaboration for<br>15 years we had more than probably 10 12<br>phds together we shared the same values<br>in terms of looking after the student<br>try to support them financially mentally<br>and make sure that they are not just<br>successfully completing their ptds but<br>actually getting jobs as well<br>I would like to thank Professor Jim<br>Martin and Dr Sue Mission from Lincoln<br>collaborator for a really really long<br>time since I started my PhD I would like<br>to thank the group at Agri research<br>as well as the colleagues at<br>Australia who are actually supported<br>lots of the funding that enabled me to<br>do the research so with that I would<br>like to acknowledge and thank first my<br>family uh very very early on they start<br>to realize that academic work is not<br>eight to five job and they they were<br>happy with that and they supported me to<br>achieve as much as I could<br>also I would like to thank the student<br>who were my real partner and companion<br>during my research journey I would like<br>to thank my colleagues and collaborators<br>at food science department and at the<br>other departments as well<br>and I would like to thank the funding<br>agencies and food companies companies<br>who supported my research thank you very<br>much<br>assalamu alaikum<br>home greetings to you all my name is<br>Miranda morosa I'm the head of the<br>Department of Food Science and I have<br>the role of thinking you Aladdin for<br>your lecture tonight<br>so thank you for sharing your journey<br>with us uh wow what a what a journey<br>it's been uh from muscle muscle Foods uh<br>kiwi fruit infused Lambs deer sheep milk<br>uh through to Alternative proteins blood<br>and sex and wool<br>as you've heard tonight uh the the<br>research contributions allowed in these<br>areas are significant your research has<br>supported the New Zealand food industry<br>to deepen their advantages in<br>traditional products while also deriving<br>growth in Innovation and exciting<br>emerging areas<br>furthermore your insistence over your<br>career on finding ways to add value to<br>waste and byproducts is helping to<br>transform the New Zealand food sector so<br>it can deliver more food for less output<br>for these efforts we applaud you<br>of course your academic contributions<br>extend well beyond your impressive<br>research outputs and this was<br>acknowledged both by Professor Barker<br>and Bremer you are a much-loved teacher<br>and research supervisor<br>a highlight for my third year class each<br>year is the awesome lecture you deliver<br>on faith and food which unsurprisingly<br>has a strong emphasis on regulations for<br>Halal and kosher food production<br>but in fact students in all the papers<br>you teach Rave around a rave about your<br>kind and generous approach you apply to<br>their learning and they also really<br>appreciate the diverse perspectives you<br>bring to the classroom this is also true<br>for your colleagues you are a valued<br>member of the department and The Wider<br>food science Community the promotion to<br>Professor reflects all of these<br>achievements and is very well deserved<br>so on behalf of all of us here<br>congratulations we do have a small gift<br>for you if you'd like to come up and and<br>receive that<br>all right we've had enough talk of food<br>tonight and it is now time to indulge in<br>some on behalf of the academic party I<br>now invite you to all come and celebrate<br>in the University staff club with drinks<br>and nibbles will be served I'm not sure<br>there's going to be wool insects or any<br>sort of alternative milk and deer sheep<br>on the menu but the food will be<br>delicious and given Aladdin's obvious<br>distaste for waste it almost be consumed<br>so please do come and join us<br>enclosing alaran<br>and to you all thank you for joining us<br>nordada<br>tenakoto tenakoto tenakoto katoi</p></main><footer style="margin-top: 2rem; background: #0001; padding: 2rem; text-align: center;"><p>We Are The
