great<br>pleasure to welcome you all to this very<br>special occasion to celebrate Bruce<br>Russell's promotion to Professor<br>these lectures are really a great<br>opportunity for all of us to take time<br>out and to listen to our amazing staff<br>and the research that's Karen being<br>carried out across the University<br>I'd like to welcome colleagues students<br>and friends from across the university<br>in The Wider community and I'd like to<br>give a very special welcome to Bruce's<br>family his wife Elsa and Maeve and<br>Lachlan and his sisters Jacqueline and<br>Julia<br>as some of you will have heard me say<br>promotion to professor at the University<br>of otago is not something that's easily<br>achieved and in order to get promotion<br>and Bruce has had to demonstrate<br>sustained excellence in teaching<br>research and service<br>now as you shortly hear Bruce is a<br>neuropsychopharmacologist and clinical<br>pharmacist with expertise in addiction<br>recreational drugs and presumably not<br>personally and<br>serious mental health conditions<br>including treatment resistant psychotic<br>and mood disorders Bruce's research is<br>based on its practice as a pharmacist<br>and he is specialized in treatment<br>resistant mental health disorders<br>so congratulations Bruce we're very<br>fortunate to have you as part of the our<br>University whanau and I'd now like to<br>hand over to Professor kalamara dean of<br>the School of Pharmacy to provide a<br>formal introduction to Professor Russell<br>Takata<br>kirakoto um Cora carlomara takoinua I'm<br>Carla Mara I'm the dean of the School of<br>Pharmacy and it's with immense Pride<br>that I have am able to introduce<br>um Bruce Russell's IPL<br>um we're immensely proud of of the<br>things that Bruce has achieved at the<br>School of Pharmacy and obviously at our<br>competitor School of Pharmacy in in on<br>the North Island but throughout his<br>career as well so Bruce is a true man of<br>the South uh you were brought up in<br>invercargill and came to the University<br>of otago did a bachelor of Pharmacy with<br>honors and then did your PhD as as well<br>then Bruce before that Bruce actually<br>embarked on a number of different<br>aspects of his career which he'll touch<br>upon in his IPL which are is very<br>interesting and<br>um<br>he went to Scotland to do a postdoctoral<br>fellowship and he also worked clinically<br>as a prescriber advisor in general<br>practice and to this day Bruce is one of<br>the few researchers in our school that<br>maintains his professional license so<br>that is uh very uh useful part ximena's<br>wonderful wife Elsa in Scotland and they<br>moved to the University of Auckland<br>where they both were on faculty there at<br>the School of Pharmacy and then we were<br>fortunate enough to recruit him down to<br>the University of otago and he's made<br>really big impacts since he has come<br>he's been an excellent teacher he's done<br>fantastic research and has really filled<br>in in a number of leadership positions<br>including currently being Deputy dean of<br>our school so large decision-making<br>roles Bruce is occupied so it's with<br>great pleasure that I will turn the mic<br>over to to Bruce Russell to give you his<br>inaugural professorial lecture speed<br>that's quite an introduction uh thank<br>you all for coming there's a few faces<br>which I didn't expect to see as well as<br>a few people that I don't know<br>yeah which is not a bad thing obviously<br>uh anyway so obviously I'm going to talk<br>about three things mainly speed<br>sometimes at action and also psychosis<br>which is I guess sort of a long-standing<br>interest of mine and the speed part of<br>it will<br>I guess comes from my own personal<br>interest and just going fast as well as<br>actually in clinical interest in the<br>drug and its effects<br>so I guess this sort of started as I<br>said when I was quite young so if you<br>look at this that's me when I was<br>probably about seven or eight uh that<br>photo would have been when I was in Gore<br>at Gore main school<br>and at the time we lived at the top of<br>quite a big hill in the middle of sort<br>of one of the fewer bigger Hills in Gore<br>there's a small town obviously which<br>most of you all know<br>uh and I built this go-kart and I was<br>quite pleased and quite excited with<br>myself and I sort of you know gone on<br>the top of the hill and sort of went<br>hurtling down the hill uh to be honest<br>it scared the hell on me at the time but<br>it was also quite exhilarating and<br>always thinking that's kind of weird I<br>didn't expect to be sort of uh feel<br>quite so high about it as well I guess<br>is the best way to put it and that<br>interest and speed obviously persisted<br>it's uh the next picture there on the<br>right of me uh when I was at high school<br>everyone else played football and rugby<br>and all these other things uh I tried<br>all of those things but I didn't really<br>enjoy them I was still really just<br>interested in speed and I was probably<br>the only kid at my high school anyway<br>who took up speed skating uh so I raced<br>obviously people on the Isis are like<br>going fast and that was sort of a<br>follow-on<br>around the same time I also got quite<br>interested I guess in model aircraft<br>because I decided when I was going to be<br>older I was going to be a pilot<br>so I started building model planes and<br>they were also quite fast so that photo<br>there at the bottom that isn't actually<br>me in the middle that's a good friend of<br>mine called Philip winter I'm sort of on<br>the right facing the model and<br>modeling uh would be Dave Harper's hand<br>actually trying to get us started so<br>they also got really really fast so at<br>the time I was probably I don't know 14<br>near it when that was taken and those<br>model aircraft when you're hanging on to<br>them we're still doing sort of 130 140<br>kilometers an air some of them were<br>really fast and doing so well over 200.<br>and that was a big thing though really<br>fast again that sort of you know goes on<br>with first sitting on a go-kart and then<br>speed skating and then fly model planes<br>and obviously I sort of you know want to<br>sort of a movie Top Gun this you know I<br>feel the need the Need for Speed that<br>really sort of resonated with me for<br>obvious reasons<br>the sort of progress I guess<br>so my father was a mechanic he worked<br>quite long hair sometimes but he was<br>always doing something in the garage you<br>know in the workshop out the back so he<br>had a live and welder I remember him<br>building trailers and working on cars so<br>I grew up around cars and I sort of I<br>guess had that interest in cars so I got<br>quite good mechanically so I guess I<br>managed to build things like model<br>planes<br>and then about halfway through high<br>school I guess<br>most of my friends I guess I probably<br>wasn't that academic but I did okay<br>but most of my friends all started<br>drifting off and they didn't trades they<br>went away to be you know auto<br>electricians and Carpenters uh one<br>friend joined the army and did<br>electronics and all this sort of thing<br>so that was quite good but I wasn't in<br>that sort of top stream of school I<br>guess by the time I got to high school<br>uh it's uh I set University entrance<br>because I didn't do enough work in the<br>sixth form as it was caught at the time<br>to get it accredited I passed<br>chemistry physics and myths literally<br>just passed them I got sort of like 52<br>and things in them it was just by the<br>skin of my teeth literally and I<br>actually failed biology which is weird<br>when you consider what I do now in<br>English which is obviously really<br>important if you're trying to write<br>papers and things<br>anyway so I left school<br>by then I had my first motorcycle it's a<br>picture of I guess what I was writing at<br>the time<br>it's an old Kawasaki triple for those of<br>you who are interested in bikes which is<br>probably not many of you actually<br>uh<br>but it was quite a fast bike at the time<br>and again it sort of reflected this<br>general interest and speed of me trying<br>to go as fast as I could on a regular<br>basis I got more than one speeding<br>ticket around the time I left school<br>which was obviously frowned upon then as<br>it probably should have been and it is<br>now but it was something else I did to<br>try and go fast<br>uh<br>so anyway I left school before I<br>finished high school sorry I left that<br>sounds good I never quite finished high<br>school so I left school and I got this<br>job at Edendale so there's a big Dairy<br>Factory there I tried to get a job at Ty<br>point which is where the aluminum spout<br>was because I've been watching my father<br>work with metal all his life and I was<br>quite interested in metallurgy I<br>couldn't get a job there so I ended up<br>working in a Dairy company in a quality<br>control lab<br>I were there for a few years and I sort<br>of built various cars and things uh<br>there's a photo there of someone<br>skydiving also tried that again that was<br>in I guess in a with the intent of going<br>as fast as I possibly could at the time<br>I read somewhere that if you fell flat<br>you were falling at about 200 kilometers<br>an hour but if you went head first you<br>could do up to 300 and that really<br>intrigued me<br>so I gave that a shot as well so I<br>skydived not a lot but I did it a few<br>times and I didn't do it as they do now<br>mostly people when they Skydive they<br>jump they sort of strapped themselves to<br>someone else into a tandem jump I just<br>jumped out of the plane remember the<br>first time was wee system 172 and the<br>instructor basically said you have to<br>climb out of the plane behind the<br>propeller you put one foot on the wheel<br>and you hang on to the hang onto the<br>strap like this so you're standing there<br>behind the propeller which is sort of I<br>don't know I guess about where the end<br>of that table is and then when they say<br>let go you let go<br>uh so I did but you know the line at the<br>time was you know what happens if I'm<br>too scared to let go and he said well<br>I'll just take my foot off the brake<br>because you've got one foot on the wheel<br>of the plane obviously and that's you<br>know if it goes round your foot goes out<br>the back and you have to let go<br>anyway so I carried on with that I while<br>I was at the very lab I sort of sorry at<br>the dairy company I caught some really<br>really good lab skills and I got really<br>quite interested in chemistry which is<br>obviously one of the few subjects that<br>I've passed<br>and also microbiology so I did a lot of<br>work around that and I actually ended up<br>going back to night school<br>and setting those papers again and<br>actually passing them quite well<br>so I didn't get them the first time but<br>I did quite well the second time but I<br>wish I hadn't wasted quite so much time<br>so this sort of theme I guess carried on<br>uh obviously I was still interested in<br>going fast so I bought a low to seven<br>from a company in Auckland<br>I modified that quite extensively fitted<br>what at the time was called formula<br>Pacific which is about the same level as<br>Formula Three so I built one of those<br>engines and I fitted at that and I raced<br>at Club racing for quite a while uh blew<br>it up on a sort of occasional basis<br>I blew it up once sort of driving down<br>one of the streets in invercargill<br>the clutch came out took out the bell<br>housing or the fuel lines<br>the electrical lines so I had no brakes<br>sort of coasted to a stop from I forget<br>what speed I was doing was something I<br>shouldn't have been doing obviously uh<br>jumped out of the car and the passenger<br>in this car also jumped out and he said<br>oh we better sorry he said we<br>better<br>stop it from Catching Fire because it<br>was fuel leaking all over the place so<br>he jumped out with a fire extinguisher<br>and he said where's the battery cables<br>he picked up the battery cable and of<br>course it's packed and the car did catch<br>fire<br>fortunately he had a fire extinguisher<br>in his hand so I put it out<br>anyway so I'm getting off the topic here<br>so around that time I thought well all<br>of my friends again had already gone and<br>done trades so they all wandered off to<br>Los Angeles we were all interested in<br>sort of going fast we had just<br>interesting cars<br>so we shifted tour there's a bunch of us<br>actually shifted to La so<br>I lived in Los Angeles I guess for quite<br>a while and I got a job at a Hydraulics<br>engineering Workshop as a general<br>mechanic as I was mentioned I was you<br>know not too bad with spanner so I did<br>okay<br>uh and I guess this is where I first<br>sort of came across the drug speed<br>so at the time we were building a series<br>of presses for the American Army so they<br>were presses basically for building<br>these big artillery shelves<br>so I remember we were sort of working<br>with these drills and things and we had<br>to shift these<br>big pieces of metal around that we've<br>been working on with a forklift<br>and this young man that I was working<br>with he was about the same age as me<br>and he was getting really red on the<br>face he was working really really fast<br>and I couldn't figure out what the hell<br>was going on you know why are you<br>working quite so hard you worked hard<br>anyway but he was sort of going up and<br>Beyond<br>and he admitted that he'd taken some<br>speed that morning<br>and he'd taken some speed I guess to try<br>and impress his father who owned the<br>company that we're working for so he was<br>working really really hard doing quite a<br>good job but because we're shifting<br>these big plates around forklifts and<br>things I felt quite sort of exposed I<br>guess and that was my first experience<br>with speed the drug<br>and I thought at the time that's kind of<br>odd that you can do that and sort of<br>quite a good job<br>but he was looking as I said quite weird<br>in the face he was about the same age as<br>me so you know just over 20 and no more<br>and it was a bit scary and I sort of<br>always remembered that so I always sort<br>so after that we sort of came back to<br>New Zealand where I came back to New<br>Zealand anyway I was earning enough to<br>have quite a good time but not enough to<br>do a lot of travel not enough to do what<br>I wanted anyway so I came back to New<br>Zealand and worked at a different Dairy<br>company in temuka<br>again quality control lab<br>and my friends had always said you know<br>why don't you go to university and I met<br>a bunch of people that had gone to<br>University and they thought well I<br>wasn't really enjoying what I was doing<br>so I sold my car which was sort of a<br>little bit heartbreaking at the time but<br>I sold it so I had enough money to pay<br>fees and things and bought sort of<br>another old car and a big road a big<br>sort of motocross bike I guess it was<br>but I had this sort of plan that I was<br>going to do something useful at<br>University and I thought at the time<br>everyone I knew was doing going into<br>medicine<br>and I thought no I don't want to do that<br>at the time that looks more like a<br>career a lifestyle Choice than a career<br>and I thought well if I do pharmacy I'll<br>still do okay but I should still be able<br>to have some sort of life outside of<br>Medicine<br>having a talk with Brian Robinson that's<br>one who was head of the chemistry<br>Department he said why didn't any<br>medicine I said no I don't want to do<br>that<br>anyway so I ended up doing Pharmacy<br>so I worked all the way through the sort<br>of Pharmacy undergraduate program which<br>is obviously a four-year program and I<br>got to the end of it and I was an adult<br>student and I think because I was never<br>a student I've got quite good grades you<br>know I did reasonably well so I ended up<br>doing sort of Pharmacy honors<br>and at the time there was this other<br>drug around that was sort of<br>colloquially called euphoria<br>uh wasn't really a problem in New<br>Zealand but it was a big problem in the<br>states so there's this guy you probably<br>maybe just about reading his name at the<br>bottom here called Randall Clark who'd<br>been to New Zealand a couple years<br>before<br>and he was good friends and worked with<br>David Shamir and Rose Marie beerus for<br>the time<br>and they said if you've got someone who<br>can do some work on this so it was my<br>honors project so I synthesized around<br>seven or eight different amphetamine<br>analogues all on the sort of I guess by<br>the time was it a minor X base and ran<br>drug discrimination studies comparing<br>them to dexamphetamine so basically<br>trying to get a dose response code for<br>each of these drugs so I had a<br>synthesize them then characterize them<br>using this sort of you know infring<br>spectroscopy in a marine all the rest of<br>it and ran sort of basically dose<br>response curves so that was my honors<br>project which was<br>way bigger than you would do for an<br>honors project now<br>but we got a paper out of which was<br>quite good obviously it was in<br>Pharmacology bike industry and behavior<br>I was quite well cited at the time<br>because it was on a drug which people<br>knew a little bit about but not very<br>much in order to really done much with<br>the isomers or anything before either<br>so I finished that in 1991 so this was I<br>guess my first introduction I guess to<br>the stimulant says drugs<br>apart from my sort of previous<br>experience in Los Angeles<br>so I said I think there was about eight<br>of them I think we were synthesized in<br>the end and so I think I ended up<br>synthesizing the Dex amphetamine as well<br>actually so we did these drug<br>discrimination studies in Neil<br>McNaughton's lab who's a professor who I<br>guess<br>has had quite a big influence on my<br>career I actually work with them now<br>he's retired he's recently made Emeritus<br>but I still work with him on occasion I<br>hadn't really seen him for years until I<br>came back to otago but I work with him<br>again which is kind of kind of like<br>going forward circle from the honors<br>degree back to her you know working with<br>uh around that time obviously I'd had<br>sort of a reasonable degree as well and<br>I learned quite a lot and there was this<br>thing called the Eric stodson law and I<br>said I think I learned a little bit<br>about myself<br>so I think one of those things I learned<br>about myself if you look at this it says<br>I'm not a speed reader I'm a speed<br>understander so I'd pick things up<br>reasonably quickly<br>but we all exist on that curve is about<br>where that blue era was so most of the<br>things that make most people got quite<br>excited<br>uh make me interested<br>not necessarily quite excited and things<br>that make people really anxious and sort<br>of almost fearful and panicky I find<br>exciting<br>uh so I guess that sort of goes along<br>with the sort of persistence with uh<br>speed obviously uh persisting with<br>motorcycles and persisting with fast<br>cars jumping out of planes and all these<br>other things that a lot of people don't<br>do<br>but I do on occasion I haven't done that<br>forever jumped out of a plane for a<br>number of years I must admit but anyway<br>I really like this quote by Isaac Asimov<br>because I also read a lot of Science<br>Fiction<br>so<br>I've got an internship as a pharmacist<br>and Dunedin public Hospital uh which as<br>I've got there was mostly a rewarding<br>job in 1992 which was the year I did my<br>internship uh I was quite lucky at the<br>time I worked with a woman called<br>Rosemary Beresford who has a reputation<br>I guess in her own right for a whole<br>range of reasons but she was clinically<br>very very good and she helped me get set<br>up and at the time what was the<br>antenatal ward so I set up a clinical<br>Pharmacy service at the indianate awards<br>I was interested in I guess obviously<br>drugs and pregnancy drugs in general<br>obviously but this was a service that no<br>one else in the hospital had done I'm<br>not even sure that it exists now I think<br>it was there for a few years I went up<br>the ward most days obviously if someone<br>is pregnant you know you're not supposed<br>to take any drug and that's what we're<br>trained most the way through School of<br>Pharmacy<br>so I spent a lot of time in the medical<br>Library learning about pregnancy and<br>child development<br>that was a huge interest to me yeah and<br>I was always very grateful for Julia to<br>do that<br>different than my sister sorry<br>different name anyway so I did that and<br>uh I guess I drifted back into research<br>again because I was always very<br>impressed with dick levity who was<br>the head of the pharmacology department<br>at the time who was also very interested<br>in the amphetamine so here you really<br>had two streams of research<br>so he was interested in stimulants<br>recreational drugs but he also had a<br>whole other stream of research going<br>along with cardiovascular drugs so he<br>was a really really clever man<br>and I really enjoyed his lectures so I<br>ended up going and talking to him about<br>a PhD<br>so I ended up doing this PhD looking at<br>the effects of MDMA or ecstasy as a sort<br>of colloquially alone<br>and we were kind of interested in<br>temperature and also compared this to<br>another drug which is prescribed so if<br>you look at those chemical formulas here<br>the top one is the chemical structure of<br>ecstasy the bottom one is dexphen<br>fluoramine which has been prescribed or<br>was prescribed for over 20 years as<br>nanorectic so that was prescribed for<br>weight loss<br>uh just like me of amphetamine and Dixie<br>amphetamine where two at some point that<br>was a slightly safer version it wasn't<br>really<br>quite so toxic at higher doses but most<br>of the amphetamines are particularly to<br>serenergic nervous system that's in<br>preclinical models<br>so I did this PhD with ecstasy because<br>it was a stereoisomer I had to<br>synthesize that myself I was always<br>quite proud of that I've done this<br>series of serious stereo isomeric<br>synthesis for ionis project and that<br>sort of persisted into my PhD<br>I didn't bother synthesizing big spin<br>for a meme because you buy that off the<br>shelf but you couldn't buy the S isomer<br>of MDMA<br>and at the time deck or declarity dick<br>was quite interested in the effects of<br>temperature because he'd sort of noticed<br>over a couple of years that had been<br>doing these studies<br>that he had real trouble with MDMA<br>trying to get it to be neurotoxic<br>was after several years in the winter so<br>in the winter when he was running his<br>neurotoxicity studies the drug very<br>really worked it wasn't really<br>neurotoxic but in the summer it worked<br>fine<br>so there's obviously this link with the<br>ambient temperature<br>and around then I think<br>must be not long after that he actually<br>shifted most of his animal studies over<br>into what was then the hurricus as<br>opposed to going to do them in the Adams<br>Building at the time<br>so I had a good look at the literature I<br>think that's been probably three or four<br>months reading papers and decided at the<br>end I knew nothing about what I'd read<br>for three or four months<br>I hadn't taken any notes which was kind<br>of dumb so I guess I learned a big<br>lesson there as well you need to write<br>notes when you're reading papers there's<br>no point in reading them<br>don't you like one<br>yes<br>so<br>we did a little bit of work with D2<br>antagonists which were anti-psychotics<br>and I noticed that they cause this huge<br>drop in body temperature<br>uh and I thought well that's kind of<br>interesting but that's probably what's<br>being neuroprotective<br>so we started playing with sort of D1<br>antagonists and agonists to see if that<br>did the same sort of thing so I was<br>interested in these D1 antagonists at<br>the time<br>so as I've got the other D1 antagonist<br>it was kind of nonsense not a very good<br>one actually it didn't really prevent<br>the floor the extreme fluorine and<br>juiceratic neurotoxicity<br>but the<br>did with MDMA okay so I prevented MD man<br>do Stoke manage against certain<br>neurotoxicity and that was kind of a big<br>thing at the time and they come down to<br>that ideas is MDMA really neurotoxic<br>uh<br>that ties in with a uh a gentleman in<br>the UK currently called David Nutt who's<br>a professor over there he was a<br>Scientific Advisor to the British<br>government I think for probably over 10<br>years you know from the naughties right<br>I think it's about 2011 or 2012.<br>and he advised the British government<br>about what was safe to use and what<br>wasn't safe to use and he came out one<br>day and he said I've just published this<br>paper it shows that MDMA is actually far<br>safer to use than alcohol<br>that was a really outrageous thing at<br>the time and it probably still is so he<br>was promptly sacked from his position as<br>leading the sort of Council of advisers<br>to the British government for saying<br>that ecstasy was safe<br>uh but it kind of you know went along<br>with I guess some of the work that we've<br>been doing as well and he still<br>maintains that it is alcohol causes more<br>damage it's more neurotoxic than MDMA<br>that is the doses we use recreationally<br>okay I guess some of the work I did sort<br>of you know goes along with that<br>obviously it was published which was<br>quite good<br>uh<br>so around that time I shifted to<br>Edinburgh which is where I met my lovely<br>wife<br>and I went there sorry I went first to<br>Glasgow I didn't go there to meet her<br>specifically I just sort of came across<br>obviously but I went there as a local<br>pharmacist because while I was here<br>working with duck he had a good friend<br>called John Kelly who was a professor of<br>pharmacology Edinburgh University he<br>came out here and he remember having<br>dinner with him one night and look<br>having this big conversation about the<br>about the amphetamines and he said well<br>I did a lot of the early work in the<br>early 70s on methamphetamine he said I<br>can remember taking it and riding my<br>push bike uh and getting on an extra<br>cycle and sort of you know trying to<br>measure how much energy we're using and<br>at the time speed caused a lot of<br>trouble that was when they first<br>realized that it was a stimulant and it<br>was banned from the Olympics around that<br>time and he was involved in some of that<br>work<br>so anyway I went to Scotland with the<br>idea of picking up a postdoc with him<br>not until I did that I worked as a local<br>pharmacist in Glasgow and then in<br>Inverness for a while I didn't have any<br>trouble understanding anyone in Scotland<br>but they had a lot of trouble with my<br>accent for some reason<br>so anyway I got this position at the<br>University of Edinburgh uh and we were<br>looking at neuroprotective mechanisms at<br>a thing called the food yourself<br>Institute of Neuroscience which was a<br>drug company sponsored Institute within<br>the University<br>I enjoyed the work but I was only there<br>for about a year and said that was where<br>I guess one of the things without<br>because it was a drug company sponsored<br>Research Institute what you did was you<br>did monthly reports like you would<br>forget about any other Drug Company<br>didn't publish anything<br>and I think because I was a little bit<br>interested in also the boss didn't look<br>on there very kindly so my funding<br>magically ran out at the end of the year<br>uh so I then went and worked as a<br>prescription we returned to being a<br>pharmacist and we worked for the<br>Midlothian Health Care Cooperative so I<br>was a prescribing advisor for NTM GP<br>practices on the outskirts of Edinburgh<br>I did that for about a year that was<br>really a position that came about sort<br>of fortuitously I guess because it was<br>about the time that funding ran out<br>and that really was a maternity cover<br>position uh it was interesting but it<br>wasn't really me there wasn't really any<br>was a job which paid the bills but it<br>wasn't me and I said this other job came<br>up as a specialist pharmacist at the<br>fourth Valley Hospital<br>uh or fourth Valley<br>District rural hospital I think it's now<br>called and just to show that we've come<br>a long way at one time it was actually<br>called the Sterling District Lunatic<br>Asylum this place that I went and worked<br>at obviously you can't call it that now<br>but that's what it used to be called<br>and I have very sort of fond memories of<br>working there at Bowers like Hospital in<br>particular at Price Park and triceview<br>so Choice back was a long-term<br>Rehabilitation award for people with<br>chronic psychosis who hadn't responded<br>well to clozapine or who needed<br>clozapine which is the drug that I'll<br>come back to later on I guess it's<br>probably one of the best jobs that I've<br>had because<br>certainly the best job as a pharmacist<br>sort of had because at the time you<br>really were a part of a<br>multi-disciplinary team<br>so my signature on the piece of paper<br>was just as important as the Consultants<br>it was usually me that picked the drug<br>and the doses but I was involved in the<br>diagnosis<br>so we worked really really closely and I<br>quite enjoyed that<br>was also psycho geriatric Wards<br>obviously acute Wards and this forensic<br>world that have been working on as well<br>as the learning disability one so I was<br>there for quite a while<br>quite enjoyed it one of the things I had<br>discovered was I was sort of back to<br>bikes by this time when I bought this<br>sort of Kawasaki zx90 so I used to<br>commute from Edinburgh up to Falkirk<br>which was quite good it was about 40<br>miles each way sort of Miles not<br>kilometers<br>it's a big bike it was quite fast it<br>didn't take too long<br>one thing I did discover was that I sort<br>of became quite famous for wearing<br>leather's Ward rounds and if you're<br>working in Community Mental Health teams<br>or acute for psychodiatric Wards if<br>you're wearing Leathers you gain instant<br>credibility with patients<br>okay because you're not sitting there in<br>a white coat<br>you look like anyone else and they're<br>always interested in the bike so I could<br>have some really really good<br>conversations with patients and give<br>them really good feedback and they would<br>tell me pretty much anything that I<br>asked them<br>so that idea of riding a bike at the<br>time was hugely important and I managed<br>to get really really good relationships<br>with patients and obviously with the<br>practitioners as well psychiatrists and<br>awards it was good<br>as part of that job I also taught<br>Pharmacy and nursing students from<br>Sterling<br>in strathclyde which is a big university<br>in Glasgow so that was part of the role<br>so I began teaching again there which<br>so after that I was back to New Zealand<br>I also got a postdoctoral position at<br>Auckland University or university of<br>Auckland and around that time the New<br>School of Pharmacy had just been set up<br>and they were looking for lecturers John<br>Shaw who was from otago set up the<br>school and I emailed them when they sort<br>of emphasized this job and he very<br>kindly gave me a job even though I<br>didn't have an extensive publication<br>history but he swore I guess some value<br>in me<br>so we shifted back to Auckland<br>uh where I met Professor Rob Kidd who I<br>guess was my next Mentor after<br>declivity had been so at the time this<br>is 2005 2006 it was these things around<br>the streets called the party build drugs<br>no one knew anything about them uh<br>chemically they were similar to the<br>amphetamine so they weren't covered by<br>the so-called analog laws so you could<br>sell literally half a dozen different<br>types of these drugs you could put them<br>in capsules yourself and sell them<br>Corner dairies sell them in liquor<br>stores and all sorts of places they were<br>sold in New Zealand as I've got there<br>from 1999 to 2007.<br>so they were a big problem for New<br>Zealand government for quite a while<br>initially they looked quite good because<br>they didn't cause huge amounts of<br>addiction that didn't cause significant<br>problems there was a<br>any physician in Christchurch called<br>Paul G who sort of managed to get his<br>knickers and a lot about them he put a<br>lot of Articles New Zealand medical<br>journal and said these things are toxic<br>they're not pretty good and I guess if<br>like any other drug you know if you take<br>enough of it it's not good for you<br>and these sort of forests brought my<br>guess to the media's attention has been<br>potentially dangerous<br>but I went back and looked in the<br>literature at the farmers just after I<br>shifted back and known I'd ever<br>published anything on these there was<br>one paper<br>which had publish some data around human<br>use of busy ATP and it really was just<br>looking at sort of low doses in its<br>effects<br>so that became I guess my sort of<br>mission at the time was to you know what<br>can we find out about these drugs<br>I've got a picture of Matt Belden there<br>Matt Beldum was called the party Bill<br>King okay so he basically established<br>these drugs as a big thing in New<br>Zealand and Australia in the UK and the<br>state sound in Canada too<br>Gallow so he set up shops in all of<br>these countries he made a huge amount of<br>money<br>but he did this as he said to try and<br>get people away from peace so they were<br>all methamphetamine as it was called at<br>the time of sellers P for Pure so he<br>said this is a far safer version of<br>methamphetamine because it doesn't cause<br>anywhere near the issues that we have if<br>I sell it legally people end up using it<br>quite as much which was quite true<br>ah<br>so I guess<br>this is sort of a side step sorry this<br>is something has to do with my interest<br>in speed this is an aside okay so this<br>guy here Jano serenin he's the only<br>finished writer to have won a Moto GP<br>World cap he's the first person to as<br>they say get your knee down he's the<br>third person in that thing with a clove<br>on his head<br>uh<br>you can't see it in the picture but he<br>does actually have duct tape on his knee<br>so now when we ride motorcycles you use<br>your knee as it'll eat and it gauge to<br>how close to the road you are when<br>you're going around corners quite<br>quickly he was the first person to do<br>that I guess as part of the racing<br>so I guess the thing with these drugs is<br>what are we going to do with them and<br>I've met Rob uh just after I'd sort of<br>written some grants Rob was the head of<br>the faculty of the time of the division<br>here would call it and he was a<br>psychiatrist he was also quite<br>interested in so he was very good and<br>supported me in all of this research<br>that I subsequently did<br>I remember going to met I emailed Matt<br>Bowden and I said I'm going to do some<br>research for these drugs can you help me<br>please<br>I need to buy something and I don't want<br>to buy them off the shelf<br>so I said sure he said just come up to<br>the house and I'll give you something<br>so okay so I went to this huge house in<br>the middle of takapuna and he said which<br>ones do you want unless well just bzp<br>and tfmp tfmpp at the time would just<br>drive flora methylphenolpirazine and<br>benzoyl perpirazine they said right how<br>much do you want I said I don't know 100<br>grams he said about these so he gave me<br>two plastic bags with about 500 grams in<br>each and said here you go they do I said<br>that seeps thank you so I've got very<br>clear memory of walking out of this<br>house in takapuna with two bags of white<br>powder in my hands<br>uh looking at my shoulder wondering<br>where the police cars were likely to be<br>but the drugs were legal okay so it was<br>kind of scary and it was odd thing to do<br>or taking one of my PhD students with me<br>who was also looking over her shoulder<br>wondering what the hell was going on but<br>I remember that very clearly obviously<br>and it had quite a big impact on me but<br>met still does some of this work he sort<br>of likes to try and push the idea that<br>we should have safer drugs and<br>uh what we currently use and abuse I<br>spoke to him actually just last year<br>over Zoom when I was looking to buy some<br>MDMA<br>that was for some other drug trials<br>though okay<br>I said do you know who's making the<br>stuff at the moment but I'll come back<br>to that again later on<br>so I just did that one uh<br>my ongoing interest in speed that nice<br>blue zx9r that I showed you in the<br>previous slide HD Rick vet in about<br>2006.<br>so I thought ah well<br>she broke my collarbone at the time you<br>know I broke a few ribs and bunch of my<br>lungs everything else from the back of<br>the ambulance she said what's wrong I<br>said I'm okay I'm just a bit sore<br>so after I got over that I then bought<br>another motorcycle so I bought a fast<br>one<br>so I bought that red one that you can<br>see there so that was around 200<br>horsepower weighs 200 kilos uh<br>first gear is good for about 160<br>kilometers an hour 100 miles an hour<br>that's first it's got six of them<br>uh and I subsequently wrecked that<br>so as you can see I did what they call a<br>high side so the high side goes along<br>with drugs obviously or drug abuse<br>so what's going on there as a high side<br>you'll see it again in a minute and the<br>GIF will start again I hope so just<br>there the rear tire started to slide<br>it's loaded up the rear shock absorber<br>stop sliding the rear shock absorber is<br>really compressed and it Springs back<br>and it throws you off the bike<br>that's what's called a high side because<br>it throws you over the handlebars<br>so I went out of that I rangels again<br>from the back of an ambulance so I'm a<br>bit sore again<br>what if you're down and I said I'm not<br>sure but they're taking me into wait a<br>minute District Health Board so I did an<br>x-ray I'd sort of broken a few more ribs<br>Achilles tendon and obviously smashed my<br>left humerus so that is more left<br>humorous you can see there with all<br>those screws in it<br>and it sort of goes along with the<br>screws in my collarbate in a bit of wire<br>I've got in here<br>anyway<br>it's an aside so I wrecked that one too<br>so what do we do about this uh no one<br>had done the pharmacokinetic studies I<br>want to drug any sort of proper mood<br>studies about what sort of effects the<br>drugs have on your mood no one really<br>had a good idea of what they did in the<br>brain either there was one or two papers<br>around showing that they probably<br>induced dopamine release<br>and at the time there's a PhD or a<br>potential PhD student come to see me who<br>actually did do a PhD with me obviously<br>I was trying to enter she's you know the<br>regional scientific manager I think for<br>Boston Boston sorry regional manager for<br>Boston Scientific in Queensland<br>uh<br>but at the time we had to do some<br>studies uh we weren't quite sure what<br>was being sold so we thought well we'll<br>have to do a little bit of dose response<br>investigation itself so how much do you<br>want to take<br>and obviously you can't do that with a<br>PhD student so I took some of it and I<br>collaborated at the time Malcolm tingle<br>whose names just before mine also took<br>some so we did sort of a little bit of<br>dose response work with these drugs<br>everyone else was taking them obviously<br>they were illegal at the time so we knew<br>they were reasonably safe so we just<br>started off with one or two low doses it<br>was kind of a weird thing to do because<br>he said no one had published this<br>uh how else do you find how much to give<br>someone a clinical trial<br>you need to give someone enough so you<br>can do a pharmacokinetic study you need<br>to give them enough that you can<br>actually measure it in the blood<br>so we were taking our own blood samples<br>so we came up with cider what was a<br>reasonable dose you know they said that<br>there was around 100 milligrams of most<br>of the capsules but some of them had up<br>to two or three hundred milligrams<br>so we developed an essay which did the<br>work validated the essay and we ran<br>these pharmacokinetic studies with<br>groups of sort of 15 people in them<br>ah sir bzp had elimination Half-Life<br>around five hours six years which is not<br>bad for recreational drug it's not like<br>cocaine where it's saying last 20<br>minutes but it's not as long as<br>methamphetamine which is the last for<br>seven or eight years and you definitely<br>want to take that<br>uh Malcolm head a human liver tissue<br>Bank<br>so we also did some liver enzyme studies<br>so we ran liver enzyme essays against<br>these drugs to find out which enzymes<br>are metabolizing them uh as you can see<br>there I've got sip2d6y2 and 304 except<br>286 for those of you don't know<br>metabolizes probably about a quarter of<br>the drugs that we take clinically<br>so 304 takes around half of the drugs we<br>use clinically<br>so this drug tfmpp is actually an<br>inhibitor of<br>all of these drugs that we use<br>clinically and that was quite good<br>information for the clinicians to know<br>tfnpp had sort of a slightly different<br>effect<br>by then I bought another bike and<br>decided the track days were far safer so<br>I just did my racing on the track as<br>opposed to what I shouldn't have been<br>doing on the road<br>so that was what I bought next but uh<br>Bush helped an awful lot she was a great<br>student who worked quite hard<br>uh that's another student that's Joanne<br>Lynn so Joanne Lynn is now a lecturer at<br>the University of Auckland<br>this was her honors project was actually<br>doing some of these dose response curves<br>or dose response studies<br>P had the same sort of effect as most of<br>the stimulants certainly Dex amphetamine<br>increased blood pressure heart rate and<br>it sort of elevated you moved around the<br>same level<br>just not quite to the same extent and it<br>wasn't quite as potent as the other<br>amphetamines and it was also obviously<br>legal<br>okay so Joe did that uh there was<br>another student at this time called<br>Rheem with a picture of room later on<br>Rheem did some other stuff we were in a<br>study with tfmpp this was I guess part<br>of her honors project<br>as well<br>tfnpp was different as I said it<br>inhibits metabolism of sip 286<br>okay which is I said metabolizes around<br>quarter of the drugs were used<br>clinically and I thought well<br>we did these<br>drug discrimination studies news profile<br>and mood States sort of standard<br>clinical rating scales to decide what<br>they were doing to your mood the only<br>effects were lasting we decided that now<br>looking at the data was kind of<br>stimulant-like but also made people a<br>bit dysphoric made them a bit confused a<br>bit be ordered so it was more like say<br>some of the serotonergic stimulants<br>that we use or are used and used to be<br>used and used so more serotoninergic<br>certainly than say ecstasy remedy Mayas<br>at the time again I know from personal<br>experience that I'm a poor metabolizer<br>so very low levels of Studio D6 I<br>discovered this at an undergraduate<br>student I did a study with someone Rook<br>in 1991<br>so I know that clinically I'm a poor<br>metabolizer so I thought well I'll take<br>some of this and see what happens<br>uh might seem like a silly thing to do<br>but as I said remember thousands of<br>people were doing this on a regular<br>basis most weekend<br>so I didn't feel as I was sort of doing<br>anything too daring I knew it wasn't<br>neurotoxic<br>uh<br>so I took some and I told one of my<br>other PhD students I said you have to<br>keep an eye on me at the time and at the<br>time she had her fingernails painted<br>sort of bright yellow I remember being<br>quite fascinated on the influence of The<br>Stroke by these bright yellow<br>fingernails they were literally glowing<br>gold like I had trouble not watching<br>them<br>so as a poor metabolizer tfnpp did have<br>some effects that most people wouldn't<br>appreciate instead of taking a low dose<br>of it so I was kind of okay it was a<br>weird thing a weird experience at the<br>time<br>the drugs were also certain combinations<br>obviously busy at B in combination with<br>tfnpp more like dexamphetamine but had<br>feelings on you know the juice feelings<br>of self-confidence I guess is making you<br>feel a little bit lost depending I guess<br>on whether or not your report<br>metabolizer<br>so Joe and Rheem did some of that work<br>this picture he sang here it's an old<br>picture sorry he sang<br>and Louise Curley they were also<br>students of mine Louise is now a<br>lecturer at Auckland also he sang<br>sitting up there in the audience she<br>works in the School of Pharmacy down<br>here at the moment which is quite good<br>to have her around so he sung was very<br>very good at recruiting patients or<br>sorry subjects for these studies so she<br>did a lot of EEG work<br>we looked at a thing called The p300<br>Wave which is what they call an event<br>related potential so he put an EEG cap<br>on someone's head<br>and you look at the p300 wave which is<br>basically the measurement of your<br>it's a time that takes you I guess to<br>evaluate evaluate some sort of a<br>stimulus okay<br>now the p300 wave is actually also<br>oh you won't know the p300 wave is<br>actually also something looking at if<br>they polygraph someone<br>so when that a lie detector test or a<br>polygraph they look at the p300<br>particularly if that's delayed there is<br>some I guess evidence to suggest that<br>someone is lying to this or they're<br>looking at on a polygraph as well anyway<br>so<br>we've got the ibizian PNC fmpp but not<br>the combination the fake the p300<br>similar to Dixie amphetamine<br>tfmpp reduced into hemispheric transfer<br>time and transfer time between the two<br>hemispheres again for those of you don't<br>know too much about the brain you have<br>two hemispheres left and right<br>the major fiber tract is called the<br>you can measure the time it takes to<br>cross that from one side of the brain to<br>the other tfmpp actually reduced you<br>know enter atmospheric transfer time<br>which we didn't expect was we thought<br>would make it slower because it would<br>slow down your ability to think and<br>respond to something but it actually<br>reduced it we didn't expect that and it<br>had no effect on reaction time<br>uh Louise did some MRI work obviously so<br>BCP decreased activation inferior<br>frontal virus the insular and the<br>occipital regions and tfmpp also had<br>some effects so we characterized these<br>drugs from<br>pharmacokinetic Viewpoint we found out<br>what enzymes metabolize them what sort<br>of drug interactions are we likely to<br>have and we'll sort of very carefully at<br>EEG effects and<br>the MRI effects consultant that I<br>mentioned before Paul G was very worried<br>that they were potentially causing<br>seizures and they did in fact do this in<br>some people<br>but I think that was a result of poly<br>drug use rather than those drugs on<br>uh so getting back to speed again I<br>guess in this case speed or P for Pure<br>or Methamphetamine whatever you want to<br>call it an addiction<br>I had this idea that if you look at<br>people who use opiates we use what they<br>call methadone maintenance treatment<br>that really maintains the addiction so<br>if they're taking methadone they don't<br>have to commit crimes to I guess<br>purchase and use an illegal drug okay<br>so if we can do that with<br>methamphetamine sorry if we can do that<br>with the opiates why can't we do that<br>with amphetamines as well because p is a<br>big problem obviously<br>so I started talking about this trial uh<br>using methylphenidate as a replacement<br>therapy because pharmacologically it's<br>the same as the other amphetamines<br>just like method owners to all the<br>opiates<br>another head a little bit thin to do<br>with this psychiatrist called Wayne<br>miles so we set up the study where we<br>tried using methylphenidate to decrease<br>the amount of methamphetamine that<br>people were using so we recruited a<br>bunch of people who we knew were meth<br>addicts that all come through the<br>community alcohol and drug Center in the<br>middle of waitemata uh we all did what<br>sorry we did drug testing on them to<br>make sure that we had been using it<br>chronically and we gave them a dose of<br>methylphenidate or Concerta which is a<br>slow release form<br>of ethylphenidate to see if that<br>relieved their need I guess to consume<br>the drug<br>we did this trial for over 20 weeks the<br>downside of at the time was we didn't<br>really use a big enough dose and I was<br>kind of suspicious of it because 54<br>milligrams is what you would use for an<br>adolescent to try and manage ADHD<br>if you're trying to manage someone who's<br>using sort of potentially half a gram to<br>a gram of methamphetamine a day that's<br>not enough and that proved to be the<br>case but I guess at the time it proves<br>sort of a point that you could use this<br>drug safely to try and help treat<br>someone with methamphetamine or P<br>addiction<br>I tried at the time unsuccessfully to<br>get a couple of Grants from the HRC the<br>time I applied for HRC one year and they<br>said it's good but if you fix it up put<br>it back in again we will give you the<br>money next year so I fixed it up again<br>put it back in the next year and it<br>didn't even get past the first round<br>for reasons which are unknown with it so<br>I guess the nature of funding also tried<br>the prime minister at the time because<br>they were advocating they will support<br>money into research around this the<br>Prime Minister and his I guess cohort at<br>the time didn't want anything to do with<br>the study<br>I think that's one of the problems with<br>drug addiction is it tends to be looked<br>at as a Law and Order issue it's not<br>locked out it's a mental health Disorder<br>so if people think we can fix this if we<br>can make the laws tight enough and stop<br>the drug being imported and used but you<br>can't it's never worth anywhere else<br>prohibition has never worked for alcohol<br>either<br>uh that's another car that I would<br>purchased at the time for those of you<br>don't know that's a Subaru WRX it's<br>quite fast<br>I needed that because I had sort of big<br>hairy dogs at the time that was skating<br>around these big hairy dogs were also<br>quite fast<br>uh Rheem who was one of the students<br>before who did a little bit work with<br>tfmpp did some MRI studies is that Joe<br>both did phds of this and this was I<br>guess we looked at the people who would<br>recruited into this trial for<br>methylphenidate as a replacement for<br>methamphetamine<br>uh didn't really work very well but we<br>did some find some interesting effects<br>so<br>this is always I guess one of the good<br>sides of when you're recruiting a trial<br>if you're recruiting addicts or people<br>with an addiction<br>if you believe the popular press<br>methamphetamine rots your brain causes<br>big holes on it we recruited a bunch of<br>people for this trial and we put them<br>all in the scanner they all wanted to<br>see photos of the brain when they come<br>out of the scanner ah methamphetamine<br>doesn't cause brain rot it doesn't cause<br>big holes in your brain if anything in<br>this case we actually found that made<br>the stratum or the Putnam a little bit<br>larger<br>we weren't really sure why at the time<br>at this audio was potentially some sort<br>of inflammatory response but we didn't<br>really know why I didn't get a chance to<br>pursue it so<br>we published that obviously and we found<br>that methylphenidate actually helped<br>people function relatively normally even<br>though it didn't decrease their need to<br>chase P or Methamphetamine it did<br>actually mean that they could function<br>sort of and complete in this case it was<br>an event related task in the scanner<br>pretty much to the same level as you and<br>I could do it so it did have some<br>effects definitely and it was<br>potentially useful we just couldn't get<br>the money to do anything else with it<br>which was a shame<br>uh Rheem is now I think he's just<br>applied for information to an associate<br>uh<br>this was a study which I hadn't intended<br>to do<br>I'm running out of time analyze nearly<br>quarter past six sorry uh Grace photo on<br>the right the bottom there Cameron's for<br>me she was interested in opiate<br>addiction<br>she'd worked as an opiate addiction<br>councilor for a number of years and went<br>through some research around this<br>so we recruited people who were taking<br>methadone in this case and ran them<br>through a neuropsychological test<br>battery to see what sort of effects<br>methadone was having versus those who<br>weren't taking methadone and were also<br>addicted to the drugs or in this case<br>opiates obviously a heroin<br>uh we found that the methadone actually<br>helped them again perform at a<br>relatively normal level versus not<br>taking something as a substitute<br>so I'll try and get a bit faster I'm<br>taking too long<br>please bear with me<br>uh this is senior Ram who's lecturer at<br>the University of Auckland as well<br>it's also interesting what they call<br>cognitive enhancers these are drugs<br>which<br>people are known fairly widely to take<br>certainly in other parts of the world<br>Street in the states and in Canada<br>we were sort of kind of suspicious to<br>people using methylphenidate or Ritalin<br>whatever you'd like to call it and New<br>Zealand as a cognitive enhancer that's<br>to improve their performance around exam<br>times<br>uh I tried running the survey across<br>otago at the time but the people at<br>otago were on our work weren't too Keen<br>they said you can't ask these students<br>that are using illicit drug it could<br>potentially get them thrown out even<br>though I was going to be blinded so we<br>just ran the survey at Auckland anyway<br>and found that around 1 in 12 students<br>this was sort of seven or eight years<br>ago now we're using stimulants to<br>improve their performance and exams<br>that's quite a low number compared to<br>those overseas if you look at say some<br>of the American universities you'll find<br>that the survey is reporting sort of 20<br>to 30 percent of students use them<br>there is some I guess ethical and social<br>acceptability around that ethically<br>people think you know should I be using<br>this drug it's a little bit like taking<br>steroids if you're going to compare to<br>the Olympics should I be taking this<br>drug for improving my exam performance<br>or not if the drug is not going to cause<br>so we also look at things like that as<br>well so that was also quite an<br>anyway this is a quote from Jeremy<br>Clarkson who also quite enjoy obviously<br>speed has never killed anyone it's a<br>little bit like the quote about gravity<br>you know gravity is not what kills you<br>it's a sudden stop at the bottom it's<br>the same with speed obviously it's you<br>know when you suddenly stop that's what<br>does the damage uh again that's<br>my bike<br>uh psychosis remember back to that slide<br>I said I worked for a while at Bell's<br>Trace Park Christ view so I was really<br>interested in schizophrenia because I<br>worked with people who had schizophrenia<br>that didn't really respond to standard<br>treatments<br>it's very disabling disorder people are<br>quite marked so-called positive symptoms<br>that suffer from hallucinations it can<br>be fought quite thought a small number<br>of them can be aggressive not all of<br>them obviously they're quite negative a<br>lot of negative symptoms as well so if<br>it's really flattened emotional response<br>they suffer quite barely from apathy and<br>and hedonia so they don't really see any<br>pleasure find any pleasure in general<br>life<br>and they have Matt quite cognitive<br>symptoms so they're very good at<br>focusing on the task<br>so uh combined for empathy and anadonian<br>inability to focus so I don't always see<br>a lot of<br>see a lot of point in taking the<br>medicines because I don't really find a<br>new pleasure in life<br>so I guess adherence or concordance as<br>we call it now I think it's current term<br>is an issue in those patients<br>the other big issue we have is only<br>two-thirds of the people wiscuits for<br>any of the psychotic disorder actually<br>respond to the drugs which we would<br>normally use<br>had a really good relationship with some<br>of these patients who didn't respond to<br>the first line antipsychotics I was<br>always really interested in trying to<br>work with a group of them<br>so in this case we ran yet another study<br>and we looked at I was particularly<br>interested in this drug called clozapine<br>clozapine were used for treatment<br>resistance it's the only drug only any<br>psychotic we have which we know<br>decreases suicidality decreases rates of<br>Independent Living<br>'s yawning that's a bad sign<br>decreases aggression but it has the long<br>list of side effects but it does work<br>really really well<br>so I wanted to do a studying find out<br>why only some people responded to<br>clozapine because even though we use it<br>a lot not everyone responds to it either<br>so<br>a third of the patients with<br>schizophrenia or psychotic disorder get<br>prescribed Clozapine<br>but only about half of them respond to<br>it really well the other half don't<br>respond to it very well and some don't<br>respond to it at all<br>so we ran this study looking at patients<br>with treatment resistance schizophrenia<br>I found that we sort of you know tracked<br>down around 156 of them this was in<br>Auckland<br>it's very hard to study of the size in<br>otago because we have a smaller<br>psychiatric population obviously it's a<br>smaller center<br>we managed to recruit 64 of them amid<br>all the inclusion criteria and because I<br>was interested in MRI we put them in the<br>scanner<br>we found this group of people as I've<br>got their Ultra treatment resistance<br>schizophrenia that is the people who<br>don't respond well to Clozapine<br>uh they had this sort of decreased gray<br>matter density<br>compared to controls which wasn't really<br>a huge surprise<br>but what was a huge surprise was if you<br>look at this other group sorry this is a<br>picture of a postdoc little time called<br>Valerie who's now in Kubrick and Wales<br>those who do respond well to the first<br>line antipsychotics<br>they're I guess gray matter volumes are<br>quite normal they're the same as the<br>controls those who are trick resistant<br>and Ultra treatment resistant aren't<br>that was kind of a surprise at the time<br>because you can talk to a lot of<br>clinicians and they think that well not<br>all of them sorry some think that the<br>antipsychotics are neurotoxic over long<br>periods because if you look at someone<br>with schizophrenia you find that their<br>ventricles do become enlarged and they<br>do have changes in Gray matter volumes<br>but looking at our study we only found<br>out on the treatment resistant group not<br>in those who responded well so that I<br>guess was a marker of potentially who<br>might respond<br>these groups just in case you're<br>wondering we're all match for age and<br>illness duration and medicine and also<br>their what we call their rating scales<br>so they all had around the same level of<br>response to the drugs we were using at<br>Phil did a lot of work around that and<br>we did a thing called diffusion tensor<br>Imaging we'll look at your white matter<br>microstructure that looks at the<br>Integrity of the white matter<br>and found that those with<br>extreme resistance again had the sort of<br>altered<br>or sort of poorer connectivity between<br>the left and the right hemispheres and<br>we thought well perhaps there could be a<br>biomarker of treatment resistance<br>and again we published that and that was<br>quite a nice result and that was kind of<br>a surprise as well because we didn't<br>expect that and we thought we would see<br>that more in the ultra treatment<br>resistant group and as those who don't<br>respond to clozapine either because by<br>Nature they're a harder harder group to<br>treat<br>ah Carolyn did a little bit more work on<br>that and found another region as well<br>called The Superior longitudinal<br>fasciculus and again<br>that was different in those with ultra<br>treatment resistance and those with<br>treatment resistance<br>and that wasn't a huge surprise either<br>because those areas along that Superior<br>altitude and fasciculus from one end to<br>the other the other areas that sort of I<br>guess responsible for perception and<br>auditory centers that's probably why<br>they had sort of slightly more severe<br>auditory hallucinations in Syria in the<br>first instance<br>and that's Caroline as I said she's now<br>a lecturer in<br>it's just a lecturer in lectureship<br>sorry in Wales in the department of<br>psychology<br>if you're doing Imaging you can also do<br>other interesting things so you can<br>actually look at glutamate levels in<br>patients so you can measure the<br>metabolites in the brain of patients<br>without sedation while we're just lying<br>there in a scanner so we're very<br>interested obviously in glutamate which<br>is one of the major neurotransmitters in<br>the brain<br>and again we found differences in<br>patients who had taken sorry found<br>differences in treatment groups which<br>reflected<br>or made you know made them specific<br>ideas for one trip one one particular<br>type of treatment than another and the<br>side of those with ultra treatment<br>resistance and it might make them a may<br>represent a mark of a response to<br>Clozapine<br>so again that was really really useful I<br>thought at the time and that's picture<br>of Meg who's<br>bought me to give a talk at the end of<br>the month actually I need to write that<br>as well<br>straight roads fast cars obviously<br>research by Nature you know you have one<br>idea and you think well you know I'll<br>solve this and then it'll be good but<br>there's always all these twists and<br>turns in the middle so what you see it<br>off down One path trying to find a proof<br>you often get diverted so you end up<br>making all these sort of diversions and<br>finding other things which might<br>interest you which is why I quite like<br>this quote about straight roads being<br>for fast cars in terms of for fast<br>drivers and as I say any four can drive<br>fast in a straight line it's the corners<br>so tonight if you're looking at<br>psychosis growing out of volumes only<br>those with treatment resistance and<br>Ultra treatment resistance shows<br>significant widespread gray matter loss<br>I said that was a surprise because you<br>know if you read all the textbooks they<br>say everybody with schizophrenia has<br>gray metal loss and that certainly<br>wasn't what we found<br>uh we also looked at sort of white<br>matter changes obviously in those with<br>treatment resistance had significant<br>changes but surprisingly first line<br>responders again were the same as<br>controls again that reinforced the idea<br>that if you responded well to one of<br>those medicines first up<br>uh you know you'd necessarily have all<br>this gray matter loss as well as white<br>matter loss<br>and as I said we found a marker I think<br>for Ultra resistance that is those who<br>wouldn't or don't respond well to<br>Clozapine<br>so overall these are all quite useful<br>biomarkers it's an area I'd sort of love<br>some of the data we net we collected at<br>the time has now been used in bigger<br>studies so there seems to be a trend<br>these days<br>not everyone works alone certainly<br>within any one institution so I was<br>approached by a woman called Cape Merit<br>who works at University College of<br>London she said could I please have your<br>raw data I'd like to include it in this<br>bigger data set<br>so this was published in Gemma<br>Psychiatry which is I guess one of the<br>bigger journals in the world just a<br>couple of years ago<br>so my data was included in this big<br>study and again it sort of really<br>supported work that we had found so I<br>was quite pleased with that and for that<br>yeah I said it's a reflection you know<br>you stayed out doing things on your own<br>but often your group grows and your data<br>if you click the data well can be used<br>in other studies<br>So currently I guess this is about an<br>end to it sorry I'm the principal of<br>yesterday so I work with global<br>Professor sorry associate professor<br>Richard Lynn Scott uh<br>uh we're looking at sort of predictors<br>of psychosis so those who might become<br>psychotic because I'd really like to<br>find out why people become psychotic in<br>the first instance<br>and that's easier to do I guess and look<br>at people with treatment resistance<br>certainly in a smaller population Center<br>I'm also looking at the effects of<br>ketamine so ketamine on treatment<br>resistance so we know that people with<br>treatment resistant anxiety respond to<br>ketamine well not everyone does respond<br>to it and we don't know why<br>so again I'm doing an Imaging study<br>trying to work out what's actually going<br>on in the brain why some people respond<br>to ketamine and some don't<br>and I'm also I guess an associate<br>investigator on a whole range of other<br>studies and work with live we always<br>live<br>at the back car live I guess or and I<br>sort of<br>co-lead this group now quarterman gitago<br>lives I was very lucky that Liv actually<br>came to otago actually so love has a<br>study called breathing perception and<br>anxiety so I'm helping her do that<br>although I think she's really just doing<br>it mostly on her own with me watching<br>mostly uh also with Neil McNaughton as I<br>said at the start of talk you know you<br>sort of Go full circle so I'm now<br>working with Neil again<br>uh<br>working with Derek doretta who's here<br>sometimes in Belgium the rest of the<br>time he's a professor of Neurology and<br>also with Paul glue so we're interested<br>in MDMA so again I've come back to the<br>MDMA which is I guess about where I<br>started this talk<br>uh certainly one of my research career<br>began anyway<br>uh currently and that's what I'm<br>currently writing<br>if you're interested<br>I guess in the way of acknowledgments<br>there's a huge number of people as I<br>said you start this stuff on your own<br>and your group just grows and you can't<br>do it on your own<br>uh<br>for you participants and patience<br>there's been a lot of them obviously<br>family and friends I've had a huge<br>number of collaborators both here in<br>Auckland some of who are very close<br>Paul O'Donnell who is not here<br>he's an IIT citizens manager here at the<br>University he first helped me I guess<br>provided me with the ability to do some<br>of the sort of large-scale data analysis<br>so he did that while he was employed<br>here at otago he actually flew to walk<br>in the town we set up a computer cluster<br>for doing MRI data analysis<br>I paid him for it it's on by the<br>university but he's sort of been a<br>normal friend of mine he was the<br>instrument technician here in the School<br>of Pharmacy when I first started my<br>undergraduate degree<br>uh I've had obviously some very very<br>good past PhD students and I have some<br>very good ones currently certainly far<br>too many time uh<br>so there's all these people who<br>I quite like this quote as well so I'm<br>getting older obviously<br>I hope to pick up speed sometime soon<br>it's just not quite worked yet I had<br>this Bert Monroe obviously who set an<br>official land speed record when he was<br>68.<br>so that's it thank you thank you for<br>listening<br>a little bit over time sorry oh no it's<br>a fantastic talk thanks very much for<br>that don't go too far the Fantastic IPL<br>it was really fascinating to see as your<br>career progressed and how you started<br>with uh M MDA and you just came full<br>circle and you came back and uh and it's<br>also good to know when you've mostly<br>probably most people in the audience<br>have been scanned by you at some point<br>some it's good to see where our data was<br>actually used<br>um for that as well so it was uh it was<br>a very important summary of your work<br>and I it was fantastic and I I actually<br>learned a lot even though I knew a lot<br>of it going into it and I like to<br>believe this quote but I'm not sure it's<br>actually true<br>it's a true quote so<br>um before you go I would uh like to take<br>this opportunity to present you with a<br>small token of appreciation from the<br>University<br>on achieving your professorship so<br>congratulations thanks Carla and thank<br>foreign</p></main><footer style="margin-top: 2rem; background: #0001; padding: 2rem; text-align: center;"><p>We Are The University</p><ul
