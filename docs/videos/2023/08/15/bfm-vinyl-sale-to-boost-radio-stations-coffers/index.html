font-size: 0.8em">Transcripts may be automatically generated and may not be 100% accurate.</p><p>supporting the station is really<br>important because if we lose something<br>selling off the vinyl was not an easy<br>decision but one that we recognized was<br>ultimately necessary for the financial<br>stability of the station to continue<br>into the future it's<br>um a significant move but it's kind of<br>like a final resource for us to in order<br>to get some bit of a cash injection so<br>we can do what we do best I think in a<br>we would be able to be more sustainable<br>and I think that's where we're working<br>towards at the moment and that's what we<br>really need the I guess that community<br>that I've been talking about to really<br>invest into is<br>um helping us be sustainable in a<br>long-term way so there's about 6 000<br>records that we're going to put on the<br>chopping block a lot of them are in<br>various conditions various aspects of<br>being some of them have been thrashed<br>over the years some of them have been<br>sort of left alone and it's the ones<br>that don't get play often that we<br>thought we should see a problem well<br>there's a real pride in being able to<br>stay independent and also support things<br>that aren't being supported elsewhere so<br>give platform to interesting ideas<br>people who wouldn't necessarily get a<br>foot in the door in more mainstream<br>spaces and that's kind of the big tenet<br>of us as we are independent we like to<br>be a little bit story where we need<br>to be but we also you know a serious<br>operation so many of our volunteers and<br>our DJs and our journalists have gone on<br>to have really significant roles in both<br>music and broadcasting and television<br>art so many different things we have<br>allowed all the alumni the staff and the<br>volunteers all the programmers to retain<br>the records that they want held back the<br>ones that they play the ones that they<br>think are culturally and historically<br>significant if you go through the<br>shelves you'll see a lot of keep<br>stickers on them and that's going to<br>ensure that we keep the stuff that makes<br>bfm bfm but also opens up the floor for<br>people who want to support us to buy<br>records that are uh interesting markers<br>of music culture and history<br>we have 12 staff and two contractors so<br>14 staff all up<br>plus all your volunteers about 130<br>volunteers at any given point yeah there<br>are many ways to support us the easiest<br>way is to become I guess a member of our<br>B card subscription that costs 420 a<br>month about 50 bucks a year and it's a<br>really easy way to support us and it<br>enables you to win thousands of dollars<br>worth of prizes on air get invited to<br>sort of bfm events and that sort of<br>thing but we have had a lot of alumni<br>donating when I've got a little page<br>which is incredibly overwhelmingly<br>positive and very heartwarming nobody<br>wants to sell the records I don't want<br>to sell the records but we understand<br>that it is something that we need to do<br>to sustain ourselves in this part of the<br>architecture we get messages like day<br>people who have been listening since<br>before I was born so it's quite nice to<br>know there's that that you know<br>whakapapa of people who have invested<br>their their love into this place and<br>also are invested in its you know<br>foreign</p></main><footer style="margin-top: 2rem;
