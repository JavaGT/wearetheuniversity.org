I was working<br>at Robinson research where I met ratu<br>our CEO from there he introduced me to<br>the concept of openstart and then I<br>moved after finishing my masters we're<br>basically running on the premise that we<br>need to double triple quadruple the<br>number of Engineers who can work on<br>these kinds of things and so having that<br>kind of advice support and proximity to<br>a world-class institution like Robinson<br>allows us to upskill the people inside<br>openstar as fast as possible we have an<br>ethos the immersing them in a commercial<br>Mission oriented environment where<br>they're working on real Global<br>challenges and making direct<br>contributions honestly we kind of don't<br>have a choice climate change makes<br>getting carbon free energy onto the grid<br>extremely important we can't afford to<br>take too much time with this here at<br>openstar we're pursuing the levitated<br>dipole reactor and the thing that makes<br>us excited about that isn't just the<br>fact that we think it's going to be<br>effective cheap stable sustainable<br>scalable but also fast the Fatback will<br>be able to develop this technology in a<br>time frame where it might actually make<br>a difference for the climate crisis<br>that is what gets me up in the morning<br>foreign</p></main><footer style="margin-top: 2rem; background: #0001; padding: 2rem; text-align: center;"><p>We Are The University</p><ul style="list-style-type: none; padding: 0; margin: 0;"><li><a href="/">Home</a></li><li><a href="/about">About</a></li><li><a href="/contact">Contact</a></li></ul></footer></body></html>
