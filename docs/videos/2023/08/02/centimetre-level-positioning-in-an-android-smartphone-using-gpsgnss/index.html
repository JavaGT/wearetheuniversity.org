This feature has been utilised by billions of smartphone users in the last few decades, primarily for meter-level navigation purposes. In recent University of Otago research, we show that it is possible to achieve centimetre-level positioning precisions with a mass-market Android smartphone. This research finding opens up a potential for accurate smartphone positioning in various applications, such as for autonomous vehicles, earth deformation monitoring, car lane keeping, construction engineering, surveying, etc. <br><br>Parts:<br>00:00 - Title and authors<br>00:04 - Why cm-level positioning accuracy in a smartphone is useful and ground breaking<br>01:23 - Otago's smartphone research<br>03:23 - References & acknowledgements<br><br>Produced by: Dr Robert Odolinski and Dr Yong Chien Zheng<br>Camera: Kelly Gragg<br>Research funders: Geoscience Australia and FrontierSI<br>Additional footage editor: Donnalouise Gragg<br>Technical Assistants: Mike Denham and Jeremiah Er<br><br>About Otago’s GNSS research: https://www.otago.ac.nz/surveying/research/geodetic/otago633640.html<br><br>Research Publications: <br>1) https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00190-018-1192-5<br>2) https://www.mdpi.com/1424-8220/21/24/8318<br>3) https://www.mdpi.com/1424-8220/22/10/3772</p><h2>Transcript</h2><p style="opacity: 0.9; font-size: 0.8em">Transcripts may be automatically generated and may not be 100% accurate.</p><p>you're familiar with the GPS technology<br>in your smartphone this enables you to<br>determine your position will meet the<br>level accuracy as shown by the green<br>dots right in front of me<br>however such positioning accuracy can<br>only enable you to use your smartphone<br>for hiking navigation and other<br>applications<br>however in the surveying industry as<br>well as at the school surveying we<br>usually use GPS technology costs in tens<br>of thousands of dollars to obtain<br>centimeter level positioning as shown by<br>the blue dots such sentimental<br>overpositioning accuracy is needed for<br>cadastic surveying construction<br>engineering other type of applications<br>in the last couple of years however at<br>the school of surveying we have now<br>Illustrated with the mass Market<br>smartphone digit can also enable enable<br>such sentiment level positioning<br>accuracy this requires sophisticated<br>algorithms and mathematical models that<br>we research here at the school of<br>surveying<br>and such centimeter level accuracy in a<br>smartphone can of course enable a range<br>of other applications outside the<br>serving industry you could think of<br>autonomous vehicles calling keeping<br>earthquake monitoring tsunami warning<br>systems<br>Etc<br>in the following we are going to show<br>you the position and performance I can<br>obtain today in your smartphone if you<br>track the global navigation satellite<br>systems we track such data here at the<br>school surveying at the University of<br>otago in Dunedin New Zealand<br>at top the gray circles indicate the<br>corresponding track satellites<br>on the left hand side for each second of<br>data the green dots correspond to the<br>corresponding location that you will<br>obtain your smartphone today<br>and as we can see the locations deviate<br>several meters from the true location<br>on the right hand side the blue dots on<br>the other hand shows the corresponding<br>solution you would get if you would use<br>our algorithms the mathematic models<br>that we research here at the school of<br>surveying and we need a five centimeter<br>levels zoom in to see the corresponding<br>Solutions<br>if we now fast forward to a couple<br>minutes of data we can see on the right<br>hand side that the repeatability of such<br>Solutions remain at the centimeter level<br>as also indicated by its 99.9 percent<br>confidence ellipse whereas if you look<br>on the left hand side we can see that<br>the corresponding Solutions remain at<br>the midi level range that's also<br>indicated by his confidence lives if we<br>now look at the larger data set and fast<br>forward in time say one hours of data we<br>can see on the right hand side a few<br>Solutions at the midi level as indicated<br>by the red dots whereas the majority of<br>the solutions remain within the<br>centimeter level range<br>and if we now look at the larger data<br>set being 5 hours 50 minutes and 40<br>seconds we can see on the right hand<br>side less than five percent of the<br>solutions at the midi level let's again<br>indicated by the red dots whereas more<br>than 95 percent of these Solutions<br>remain within the centimeter level range<br>and the size of its corresponding 99.9<br>confidence ellipse is similar more or<br>less to the diameter of one dollar New</p></main><footer style="margin-top: 2rem; background: #0001; padding: 2rem; text-align: center;"><p>We Are The University</p><ul style="list-style-type: none; padding: 0; margin: 0;"><li><a href="/">Home</a></li><li><a href="/about">About</a></li><li><a href="/contact">Contact</a></li></ul></footer></body></html>
