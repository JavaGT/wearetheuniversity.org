The evolution of internet-connected devices, wearable technology, big data and AI have given rise to smart cities and smart homes, where human actions and everyday behaviour become implicit inputs to technology, and environmental changes become the outputs. In this talk Judy discusses some of the implications of this, and describes how human-centred computing enables us to keep the user at the forefront of technological innovation.</p><h2>Transcript</h2><p style="opacity: 0.9; font-size: 0.8em">Transcripts may be automatically generated and may not be 100% accurate.</p><p>foreign<br>good evening thank you very much thank<br>you Annika for the introduction thanks<br>everyone for coming along this evening<br>I'm really pleased to have the<br>opportunity to give this public talk<br>um<br>part of the the 50th celebrations and I<br>get to talk about a couple of things<br>that I'm particularly interested in<br>so I'm going to talk about<br>human-centered Computing and the aim of<br>the talk is to sort of start in um some<br>of my early research in this area and<br>talk a little bit about some of those<br>projects and then we're going to move<br>through time so we're going to travel<br>through time from about<br>2010 onwards and make our way towards<br>the internet of things and some more<br>recent projects I'm working on and<br>through all of that we're going to think<br>about what it means to be a human who<br>interacts with technology and how that<br>technology has changed and what that<br>means for the people who are doing the<br>computing<br>so those of you who were here last month<br>we had Jacob haricusin from maths gave<br>his talk and he had some really nice<br>pictures 50 year old technology to go<br>with the theme of 50 years of computing<br>so I decided to shamelessly borrow that<br>idea so thank you Jacob for that and<br>start with some pictures<br>so um here are some pictures of<br>computers that are interesting for a<br>number of different reasons<br>so the one in the top list is<br>interesting because it's from 1973 so<br>it's exactly 50 years old along with<br>Computing at waikato<br>it's interesting for a couple of other<br>reasons because if you think about some<br>of the pictures you might have seen of<br>kind of old computing you might have<br>seen those pictures of kind of big rooms<br>full of towers and big you know reels of<br>tape on them or those huge machines kind<br>of as big as this desk with punch card<br>trays and things you put in but here<br>clearly 50 years ago we're already into<br>the era over the desktop computer a<br>machine that's got everything you need<br>to do your work in one place so the Wang<br>has the has a keyboard it's got a<br>numeric keyboard got a tiny little<br>screen on it<br>so the human can type something in the<br>human being the user the person who<br>wants to fulfill some tasks and they can<br>get some feedback from the little screen<br>nothing graphical nothing like you'd see<br>um on a modern desktop machine but the<br>inputs and outputs are already looking<br>familiar to us<br>and then the little kind of gray<br>rectangle next to the screen there is um<br>for a cassette and that's the way that<br>Dental was stored<br>so 1973 was a bit early for me to<br>actually be doing anything with<br>computers so if we slide across to the<br>the BBC micro 1982 that's the first<br>computer I ever had my hands on so<br>that's a computer that we had at High<br>School<br>and the BBC micro was part of a<br>government push during that time to get<br>people in school programming so they<br>were sort of these these machines were<br>made and they were distributed around<br>schools and the idea was to kind of get<br>kids interested in technology and<br>programming<br>what was interesting about it from my<br>perspective was we had Computer Club at<br>lunchtime once a week and you could go<br>and play on the computers and we<br>discovered very quickly that you could<br>program them to do Space Invaders<br>so what it meant was you could have an<br>hour's lunch basically playing Space<br>Invaders for free which in 1982 was<br>quite a big deal because otherwise you<br>had to go to an arcade to put money in a<br>machine so this was really cool that we<br>could write our own Space Invaders and<br>also you could tweak it so that you won<br>a lot more because it's going to make it<br>easier so it was kind of a win-win<br>situation<br>so then at the bottom in 1990 that's a<br>picture of the first computer that I<br>owned which was a Commodore c64 I bought<br>it second hand<br>um it doesn't come with a monitor I had<br>a little portable black and white<br>television and I used to plug it into<br>that and the reason I bought it was<br>because it came with lots of cassettes<br>so again you see the little cassette<br>player there with standard audio<br>cassettes which is probably a bit retro<br>even for some people in the room now<br>there were things that used to play<br>music on so for the people at the back<br>um so that was how you kind of loaded<br>your program you'd literally load it off<br>the cassette tape and then write some<br>code and store it back onto the cassette<br>tape and it came with a whole series of<br>games on cassette so it's a bit of a<br>theme developing here so I bought it to<br>play games and then I found that you<br>could go to the library and you could<br>get a book which had all of the code for<br>other games so you could write your own<br>games<br>so that was also kind of a sort of a<br>Gateway into doing a bit of programming<br>um back in the 1990s so all of these<br>have got some similarities in that they<br>assume that a user is going to put their<br>input into the computer using a keyboard<br>so we don't have any mice here yet um<br>that's that's later but we have input<br>and we have output and those two things<br>are kind of the standard building blocks<br>of how humans or people or us use<br>computers<br>we use them because we've got some tasks<br>we want to fulfill<br>and so we tell the computer in some way<br>what we want it to do and then when it's<br>finished it tells us and we get some<br>output<br>so that's sort of one of the the<br>fundamental components of what we mean<br>when we talk about human-centered<br>Computing is thinking about the person<br>before we think about the machine<br>so here you can see a whole variety of<br>different kinds of technology so now<br>we've still got the the screens and the<br>keyboards now we've got a mouse as well<br>there's also a touch screen device in<br>there and a tablet<br>again the intention of all of them is<br>still to get information or input from<br>the user so that they can control what<br>the machine does<br>so the the human in this case is acting<br>upon the computer<br>the human is the actor and the computer<br>does what it's told perhaps<br>this is probably a good time to do a bit<br>of audience participation and ask some<br>questions to hand up anybody who's ever<br>been using a computer and some software<br>and it has kind of stopped working or<br>just failed to do what you wanted to do<br>or you just couldn't get it to give you<br>the output if you wanted<br>right<br>um so similarly hands up anybody who's<br>ever downloaded an app for their mobile<br>phone because they had a specific task<br>they wanted and very quickly they<br>realized that you couldn't use it to do<br>what you wanted to or it didn't work and<br>you never went back to it ever again and<br>you probably deleted it and then it kind<br>of disappeared<br>and a final show of hands for anybody<br>who when this happens has this kind of<br>niggling feeling in the back of their<br>mind that maybe it's your fault because<br>you don't actually quite know what<br>they're very confident papers yet and<br>I'm not putting my hand up because the<br>joy of working in human-centered<br>Computing is when that happens you can<br>quite confidently say well it's been<br>very badly designed something wrong with<br>so human-centered Computing is sort of<br>an umbrella term it covers a whole range<br>of um different aspects or disciplines<br>within computer science and one of the<br>central ones is HCI or human computer<br>interaction which is all about how<br>people interact with computers so in the<br>simplest form is how do we give it<br>instructions how do we tell it what to<br>do but at the heart of that is making<br>sure that the things we design can be<br>used by their users they actually do the<br>tasks that the user wants and they<br>actually support the user in effectively<br>getting what they want from it so when<br>that goes wrong you end up with some<br>software that doesn't work or an app<br>that you can't use or um basically the<br>feeling that somehow you're running into<br>problems because you can't use the<br>computer<br>but typically it's because actually it's<br>not been very well designed<br>so HCI kind of thinks of the human as<br>somebody who has abilities in terms of<br>what can we see and what can we hear and<br>what what can we remember and it enables<br>us to design software that kind of<br>utilizes what we know so if you've got a<br>piece of software that asks you to<br>memorize a 20 digit number and then four<br>screens later you have to repeat that<br>number back it's pretty much guaranteed<br>to fail because our human memory doesn't<br>work like that so it's all about taking<br>advantage of what we know about people<br>has lots of its roots in Psychology and<br>enables us to really think about the<br>human user and design for the human user<br>so human-centered Computing incorporates<br>HCI but is also kind of wider than that<br>it's kind of much more holistic in that<br>we think whatever we're doing in terms<br>of software development or design we<br>should keep the user at the Forefront of<br>our thoughts and at the Forefront of our<br>design processes which means including<br>them as much as possible within that<br>design process so that we know that<br>we're building things that are going to<br>be useful to them for a start we're not<br>just kind of creating software and apps<br>that no one is ever going to use but we<br>have a specific user or group of users<br>and some tasks that they want to achieve<br>in mind before we kind of go ahead and<br>so the work that I've been doing in this<br>area started back in you know um like<br>2008<br>um and<br>my Approach sort of came from not the<br>human computer interaction side but from<br>software engineering formal methods<br>modeling software<br>um work I was doing with with Steve<br>Reeves sort of the back though<br>um and<br>so the the point of kind of creating<br>models of software is to make sure it<br>works before you build it that's the<br>point you build a model you test the<br>model and it gives you some confidence<br>that the software that you're going to<br>develop is going to do the right thing<br>and my interest in that was well how can<br>we take those those kind of methods<br>these ways of modeling software and<br>actually incorporate human centered<br>aspects into that so that we treat those<br>concerns with the same level of rigor as<br>we do the underlying software<br>so when I started in that area the first<br>sort of things I was looking at were<br>medical devices so things that look like<br>this<br>um on the left is a volumetric infusion<br>device and on the right a syringe driver<br>and both of these are really standard<br>medical devices in Hospitals and Clinics<br>and medical settings all over the world<br>and they're just designed to make it<br>easier for medical personnel to deliver<br>medication<br>um to their patients<br>so in this simplest form what each of<br>these devices should do is allow a user<br>to enter some information<br>like how much medicine should I deliver<br>how long should I take to deliver it and<br>then it will calculate the rate and it<br>controls the flow of medication so you<br>can guarantee that the patient is<br>getting the correct dosage<br>and the the Alaris pump on the left also<br>has some sensors in it so it can<br>identify if there's any air in the pipe<br>and it can generate an alarm because<br>clearly that's not something you want to<br>happen<br>so fundamentally they're they're quite<br>simple devices and the reason we started<br>looking at them and we're very<br>interested in them is because despite<br>their Simplicity they<br>um they're kind of at the heart of<br>errors that happen all over the world<br>all of the time on a very regular basis<br>things go wrong with the use of these<br>devices very often<br>and about 95 at least of those errors<br>are not because there's something wrong<br>with the software or the machine has<br>failed or broken they're attributed to<br>user error the person using the device<br>has done something wrong<br>and that's really interesting because if<br>you think of who are the people using<br>these devices they're finally trained<br>medical personnel<br>they're people who are trained to<br>deliver medicine to people and who care<br>about it and are trying to do it right<br>so even though they might be in kind of<br>challenging environments a very busy a e<br>department or even a rescue helicopter<br>there can be a lot going on but the<br>people themselves have been trained to<br>use them<br>and they have years of training in<br>medicine so this raised a really<br>interesting question it's like well why<br>is it so hard for them to use these<br>devices and why do they get it wrong so<br>often<br>um<br>and when you start kind of looking at<br>these in a different way by kind of<br>creating models of how they behave you<br>start uncovering some really interesting<br>properties<br>so if you look at the um the syringe<br>driver you can see it's got<br>eight buttons on one screen<br>so if you discount the on off button I<br>think well that probably just turns the<br>device on and off there are seven<br>buttons I can probably remember what<br>seven buttons do and I've got a screen<br>that's telling me what's happening so I<br>should be okay<br>but if you ask the question what does<br>that first button the gray button with<br>the up triangle do<br>the answer is it depends<br>because these are modal devices which<br>means they have different modes of<br>operation and you can see on the Alaris<br>here it says got the word infusing on it<br>that means it's in the infusing mode<br>so they have several different modes<br>they have a startup mode they have a mod<br>for when you're entering volume of<br>medication they have a mode for when<br>you're entering the time of the<br>medication they've got a mode for when<br>you're checking the rate they've got a<br>mode when you're checking that the right<br>syringe is in and in each of those modes<br>each of those buttons might behave<br>differently might and some they might<br>behave the same as some they don't so if<br>you kind of create the model as we did<br>of all of the different modes of this<br>device what you end up with is not seven<br>buttons that you have to worry about you<br>have to worry about seven buttons in<br>about 15 states<br>and if you then take that model and you<br>show it to somebody who really knows<br>about these devices<br>like we did the guy we were working with<br>at waikato District Hospital and we said<br>do you know that this is how the device<br>Works he had no idea because the user<br>has a mental model which is I turn it on<br>I check this thing I enter these values<br>I press this button I check this I press<br>this button and it starts<br>and that's fine if you don't get<br>interrupted you don't accidentally press<br>one of the other buttons when you're<br>doing it they're quite small buttons<br>imagine operating that in an ambulance<br>or in a rescue helicopter or something<br>like that pretty easy to just kind of<br>accidentally hit the on off button<br>I could probably talk about an hour<br>about what happens if you do<br>accidentally hit the on off button it's<br>and it has a partial memory whereby if<br>you're part way through setting it up<br>and something happens it might remember<br>the values you've entered so far or it<br>might not depending on where you are in<br>that cycle it took us a long time to<br>actually find out what was happening<br>with that<br>so suddenly the question of why are they<br>so hard to use becomes much more obvious<br>because the mental model that we have of<br>how to use it there's very little<br>relation to the actual model of the<br>system and how it works<br>so this is a really good example of<br>something that's been designed to do a<br>job a very important job<br>but at some point somebody's forgotten<br>that the people using this have another<br>job that they're trying to do and that<br>still have a medication to a patient in<br>a complex setting and that they don't<br>have time to get the manual down and<br>read it and look something up and in<br>fact even if they did<br>we also created a model of the manual<br>and they're actually inconsistent anyway<br>so it probably wouldn't help you<br>so these kinds of things are fascinating<br>and they're a really good reminder that<br>when we say 95 of the errors in use of<br>this device are human user errors<br>what we actually mean is that 95 of the<br>errors are caused by the design and the<br>structure and how these are built and<br>the fact that we haven't actually<br>remembered how people are going to use<br>them<br>so it's been quite a few years I'm<br>working with these devices and then in<br>2014<br>so 2014 I started doing some work with<br>Annika hinza who's here today and<br>subsequently also with Gemma who's here<br>today<br>um and we started doing some work in<br>forestry and if you can imagine what<br>it's like to be a female University<br>academic<br>walking into a forestry site<br>that's kind of the expression on the<br>faces of the people when you meet them<br>particularly when you turn up in the<br>University's little electric vehicle<br>so they're a little kind of bemused by<br>by why we were there and what we were<br>doing<br>so a good question to ask why were we<br>there and what were we doing<br>so if you remember<br>2014<br>from a technology point of view there<br>was an absolute explosion of the Fitbit<br>style wearable devices they were<br>absolutely everywhere<br>so kind of the years preceding that<br>they'd been Fitbit and they'd been<br>Jawbone and a few others and they just<br>absolutely exploded and you couldn't<br>move without some kind of wearable<br>tracker that counted your steps and<br>measured your heart rate and did all<br>sorts of different things<br>and so because this new technology we<br>were kind of interested in it and<br>interested in what kinds of domains we<br>might use it in and at the same time<br>through conversations that America had<br>been having with various people and some<br>conversations that I'd been having and<br>thinking about we were sort of presented<br>with this idea of well if you want to<br>kind of work in an area that's<br>interesting and really valuable that has<br>the potential to do something good look<br>at Forestry<br>because as many of you probably know the<br>accident and fatality rate in New<br>Zealand forestry is very high much<br>higher than in other countries who have<br>very big forestry domains and that's<br>partly because of our terrain so if you<br>go to Canada for example where they do<br>way more forestry it's very flat so they<br>use a lot of Machinery whereas of course<br>in New Zealand we plant forests on the<br>sides of mountains and so we have lots<br>more what they're called boots on the<br>ground lots more manual workers so<br>already you've got more people around so<br>you think potentially that could be one<br>um<br>one potential cause of the problem and<br>then as you start talking to the various<br>people the workers and the contractors<br>and the forestry owners and the forestry<br>Contracting companies and the companies<br>who invest in the forestry land it's a<br>very complex setup<br>you ask people well what's you know why<br>is why is there such a high accident<br>rate and you sort of hear different<br>um different themes and one that comes<br>up a lot is this notion of fatigue and<br>tiredness and workers being too tired to<br>properly concentrate or tired so that<br>their reaction times are slower and<br>these are the kinds of things that lead<br>the other<br>I'll call it a mess because it's never<br>been proved certainly not by us the<br>other myth that we heard a lot was that<br>working in forestry is a manual forestry<br>worker is the equivalent workload of<br>so that's kind of an interesting<br>statistic firstly it's um our<br>interesting fact firstly it's like well<br>if I got everyone now to go outside the<br>next bit of audience participation go<br>outside we're going to run a marathon<br>it might be quite hard and we may not<br>all make it we may not all make it back<br>but if we did that regularly and we did<br>it every day over time our bodies would<br>adjust to it<br>so if it is the case that working in<br>forestry is equivalent running a<br>marathon every day what does that even<br>mean<br>after a month does it not matter you're<br>kind of used to it and your body's<br>adjusted to it is it worse for the new<br>workers than it is for the older workers<br>is there a point where you get super fit<br>and it's fine and then you decline again<br>so really sort of interesting things to<br>think about there and also this nagging<br>thing of how do we know that it's the<br>equivalent of running a marathon every<br>day<br>we've got wearable trackers hundreds and<br>hundreds of wearable trackers<br>great idea why don't we do some data<br>Gathering a really big data collection<br>exercise we'll get a hundred forestry<br>workers we'll get them all to wear a<br>wrist tracker<br>and for a period of two or three weeks<br>maybe even a month we'll collect data<br>and then we will be the people who have<br>the first set of data that can tell us<br>something about the workloads and the<br>walking and the hills and the heart<br>rates all of these forestry workers<br>so that was 2014 probably now 2023 nine<br>years later never happened<br>we never ever despite kind of seven<br>years working on this got to the point<br>where we could do that<br>and the minute we started to do it<br>lots of things became very apparent<br>so our first study was with four<br>forestry workers for one week let's<br>start small do a little pilot that'll<br>work and then we'll go back with a<br>hundred and get them all out<br>um so we turned up in our little<br>University electric vehicle and spoke to<br>the contractor who was really Keen about<br>this work because he said look you know<br>I I want my guys to be safe<br>and I know they work really hard it'd be<br>really interesting to get some data and<br>then the four guys here tapped on the<br>shoulder these guys are all really Keen<br>to do your study<br>um and because we know about HCI and<br>about running studies with users we talk<br>to them and we explain to them what we<br>were doing and we got consent from them<br>to collect their data we were collecting<br>at that point I think step counts and<br>sleep tracking because most of these<br>devices you could track people's sleep<br>as well<br>so we gave them the instructions a<br>little bit for paper with the<br>information on how to charge the devices<br>and how to set everything up and we went<br>away said see you in a week<br>came back a week later<br>so first guy oh I've lost mine<br>caught it on a bush on the first day<br>ping gone never seen again<br>second guy couldn't charge it the dog at<br>the charger couldn't charge my<br>third one oh I couldn't I can never work<br>out because you had to kind of put me to<br>sleep mode in active mode never quite<br>work out how to do that no data<br>vodka yeah I think I think I've got it<br>okay<br>didn't think they were that hard try<br>again<br>by the end of the four week period we<br>really had almost nothing<br>and lots of reasons for that partly the<br>technology to be fair that you know with<br>the best well in the world these things<br>were not designed to be worn in outdoor<br>rugged environments by forestry workers<br>so we can't totally say Well they're<br>terrible because they don't work in the<br>forest that's not what they were<br>designed for we can say that they're<br>terrible because they didn't work mostly<br>at all and because at one point we had a<br>student wearing seven<br>as part of a honors project it's great<br>honors project you can just make<br>students do things for long periods of<br>time so he was wearing all of these<br>devices and we thought well they're<br>probably not going to count exactly the<br>same but if you imagine the platin of<br>somebody walking all of the graphs<br>should be kind of similar at least<br>absolutely not no correlation between<br>them at all not even close<br>so we weren't even convinced that in a<br>controlled environment we could get good<br>data off them never mind going to a<br>rugged outdoor environment with a group<br>of<br>guys who were the best will in the world<br>were very very suspicious of what we<br>were doing and quite rightly<br>so now of course it's quite common we<br>all wear kind of apple watches or lots<br>of us do OR carry mobile phones we know<br>we're being tracked and we know that the<br>data is going somewhere and we kind of<br>put it out of our mind as much as we can<br>but in 2014 when you say to a forestry<br>worker we're going to track your energy<br>levels and we're going to see you know<br>how sick you are for work and then we're<br>going to track your sleep and see if in<br>the morning you're fit for work as well<br>understandably they start thinking well<br>what happens if I'm not<br>what happens if I come in on day two and<br>my boss looks at this data and says well<br>I don't do your fit for work can you go<br>home I'm not paying you for the day<br>either off you go<br>so understandably there was<br>concern about the data and what we were<br>going to do with the data and what these<br>devices were even tracking particularly<br>when you're saying when you go to bed<br>press this button and it'll track it all<br>of your movement to measure your sleep<br>we had some interesting conversations<br>around explaining that one<br>so we'd sort of although we were<br>thinking well we understand that we're<br>doing experiments on humans of course<br>we'll explain it to them<br>we hadn't really taken on board the<br>people that we were dealing with they<br>weren't just humans they were forestry<br>workers and they had a job<br>and they were paid on a very tight time<br>frame to do some work<br>and our study really didn't take that on<br>board properly<br>so the rest of sort of the next seven<br>years or we were working on this project<br>and this included<br>um an mb-funded component of the project<br>our Focus was very different<br>our Focus shifted to<br>is there technology firstly that work in<br>that environment can we collect any<br>meaningful data can we measure things<br>what can we measure and what does it<br>mean<br>and can we do it in a way that actually<br>suits the needs of the workers not the<br>needs of our research<br>that actually they're comfortable enough<br>with because it's giving them back<br>something it's telling them something<br>that they wouldn't otherwise know and<br>that meant we'd have to fly up to<br>Northland and meet with groups of<br>Forestry workers and whanau crew who<br>were fabulous and spent lots of time<br>with us<br>and particularly the families they were<br>really keen on knowing that their family<br>was saved for them that was an absolute<br>crucial thing that's why they wanted to<br>talk to us so one of the workers his<br>wife said every time I hear a helicopter<br>I have to rush outside and check it's<br>not the Westpac rescue helicopter<br>because at any moment it could be an<br>accident that's happened to someone in<br>my family<br>and so our Focus was really then on okay<br>what is the technology that would work<br>for these people that they would<br>actually embrace let them drive it not<br>us<br>and so our Focus shifted because we<br>remembered<br>that the people were more important than<br>an experiment with wearable trackers<br>and that our idea of a hundred people<br>Gathering data for four weeks was<br>so that sort of takes us through time<br>now to sort of more recent times<br>we're still doing some work around the<br>um kind of measuring Biometrics and<br>understanding what that means<br>particularly Gemma is still working on<br>that looking at what can you tell from<br>things like<br>um skin impedance galvanic skin response<br>and heart rate what does that tell you<br>about people and their how well they're<br>feeling and thinking about things like<br>cognitive fatigue not just physical<br>fatigue because lots of Forestry workers<br>work in great big machines lifting logs<br>and they're doing that all day<br>and if they get tired that's potentially<br>way more dangerous to the people around<br>them they may be fine but the people<br>so still doing some of that work and I<br>was getting more and more interested at<br>that point about this nature of wearable<br>technology because remember I said that<br>we had these input devices like<br>keyboards and mice because we the human<br>were giving instructions to the computer<br>and when you put a wearable device on in<br>your data that's being gathered is the<br>import<br>the dynamic is Shifting slightly<br>it's not an explicit instruction I'm not<br>saying press this button because I want<br>the computer to do something but the<br>measurements coming from my body are<br>driving an algorithm which is measuring<br>and deciding something about the data<br>and then doing something in response<br>so this notion of sort of implicit<br>interaction<br>and what that means in terms of wearable<br>devices and iot the internet of things<br>which just means everyday items<br>connected to the internet and talking<br>that's becomes a really interesting<br>human-centered problem because we're<br>sort of Shifting away from the human and<br>we're thinking about the technology<br>and potentially you can get very easily<br>drawn into the joy of that technology<br>because there's some really cool stuff<br>it's really interesting right you get<br>your hands I think oh this is cool you<br>start doing some things and then go oh<br>this is cool<br>so if I was to go up now to my office<br>very dark walk into my office I would<br>walk in the door and the lights would<br>come on<br>and I don't need to turn the light<br>switch on<br>because there's a sensor in the room and<br>it can tell that I've walked in the room<br>so it's sort of taking this implicit<br>behavior I'm doing something quite<br>different I'm just walking into a room<br>but the light is coming on because it<br>knows it's dark and it knows that<br>there's a person in the room<br>and so these kinds of things you think<br>well that's nice that's a nice thing<br>that we can have now this kind of<br>technology I forgot my hands full I'd<br>have to worry about the light switch and<br>then I sit down at my desk<br>and this is the point where everybody<br>who works at the University of waikato<br>will recognize this you sit down and you<br>start doing something and you're really<br>concentrating so you're not moving very<br>much<br>and then the lights all go out<br>because the motion sensor thinks you're<br>not there anymore because you're not<br>doing anything so then you have to jump<br>up and you don't know where the<br>sentencer is so you're kind of doing<br>this around the office that I'm still<br>here dance so it's kind of a regular<br>occurrence if you're here after dark in<br>the building<br>and it's because the sensor is just<br>based on motion so you think well we<br>could do better than that why don't we<br>kind of enhance it we could have um a<br>heat detector in the room as well that<br>could determine my body heat and it<br>knows I'm still there that would be<br>better or I could put in a sensor in the<br>door so it knows I've walked in and it<br>knows I haven't walked out<br>so we could kind of start adding<br>technology it's quite addictive you<br>think I could have this thing and I<br>could add that and that would be really<br>cool and I end up with this office that<br>not only does the light come on when I<br>walk in but when I sit down at my desk<br>the light on that side of the room dims<br>a little bit and the lights are on my<br>desk come up a little bit because I'm<br>working there that'd be quite nice<br>we don't have that<br>if we did it would be really cool<br>so that's kind of taking us to this<br>um<br>envisaged future a thing that we're sort<br>of almost at and we talk about it a lot<br>this notion of the smart home whether<br>it's all of these devices and all of<br>this technology and it's all there to<br>make our lives Easier by firstly knowing<br>our patterns of behavior<br>and secondly being able to gather<br>information about us and respond<br>accordingly<br>so if I come home from work every day<br>say I come in at five o'clock and every<br>day I come in and I sit down the first<br>thing I do is say oh I'd love a cup of<br>tea<br>I've got to make a cup of tea well not<br>anymore now in my envisaged future I<br>walk in the door I sit down and my home<br>robot has turned the kettle on because<br>it knows when I open the garage door so<br>the kettle's on and out it Wheels with<br>my cup of tea and it gives me a cup of<br>tea and it does that for me every day<br>and that's very nice a nice way to end<br>my dad I have to make the cup of tea<br>myself it's all there for me<br>and then again you start thinking well<br>that's okay but some days are better<br>than other days<br>some days when I get home I don't want a<br>cup of tea<br>some days when I get home I'd actually<br>quite like a glass of wine or a gin and<br>tonic or two Gins and don't active only<br>on what kind of day I've had and of<br>course if my robot brings me a cup of<br>tea I might be a bit disappointed by<br>that<br>what I'd like is it to behave a bit more<br>alike I don't know my my non-robotic<br>human life partner who would say have<br>you had a nice day and like I know I've<br>had a terrible day and they turn the<br>kettle off and out comes a glass of wine<br>instead<br>okay so we can do that let's start<br>building some more sensors into the<br>house maybe the home sensors are going<br>to get the data from my wearable sensors<br>and my wearable sensors are giving away<br>information about my mood<br>so now when I get home and I walk in<br>immediately the the smart home knows<br>that I've had a terrible day doesn't<br>even think about putting the kettle on<br>out comes the trolley but the wine glass<br>adding more and more things in she's<br>quite appealing<br>it seems quite nice woman in the picture<br>he looks very happy in this envisaged<br>future with a robot coming and um<br>presenting some video call with her<br>family to to make her life more<br>interesting and we might sort of think<br>well I talk about it as an envisaged<br>future because we know we're not quite<br>there yet so we have a robotic vacuum<br>cleaner at home it's kind of you know<br>very nice it knows the map of the house<br>and it can do things and I spend a lot<br>of time shouting at it to be fair<br>I have what's tasted down the garden<br>because I left the sliding doors open it<br>was making a run for it<br>but it doesn't always quite work as well<br>as you might hope it to<br>so we need more things right we need<br>more sensors we need we need better ways<br>of understanding we need more wearable<br>technology in that way we can put the<br>human right in the system<br>I'm not a user anymore I'm not a person<br>who's pressing a button and telling the<br>computer what to do I'm in the loop and<br>part of the system<br>everything I do and all of my behavior<br>is now part of the Smart Home<br>we're kind of integrated we're becoming<br>one<br>so how do we actually make that happen<br>then what do we need<br>well<br>we're going to need cameras in every<br>room of the house<br>every single room and every single<br>corner of every room in the house<br>the living room your kitchen your<br>bedroom your bathroom<br>there's no way you can go in the house<br>or your garden that you're not being<br>watched by these cameras<br>we'll put some microphones in for good<br>measure as well so that if I say<br>something oh I've had a terrible day out<br>comes the robot with a bottle of wine<br>in my bed there are sensors that are<br>determining how I sleep<br>in my chairs there are sensors that make<br>sure I'm sitting properly<br>all of my biometric measurements are<br>being captured and analyzed<br>and everything I do is being watched and<br>observed and the date is being crunched<br>and the algorithm is making decisions<br>and now it's the computer who's in<br>charge it's not me the computer is<br>making the decisions the computer is<br>acting upon me the human not me the<br>human acting upon the computer<br>until one day you get up and you wake up<br>you say I think I'll go out for a walk<br>you go to your front door and you can't<br>open the front door<br>well that's weird you can't open the<br>front door because<br>when you got up your your home sensing<br>system detected that your temperature<br>was maybe half a degree higher than it<br>had been the night before and in 10<br>minutes time is going to be a bit<br>drizzly outside and you might catch a<br>cobles so why don't you just stay in<br>and now we're firmly in the loop now<br>we're at the point where it's the<br>computer that's in charge and not the<br>user<br>the human center now means something<br>quite different we're at the center of<br>the technology but we're no longer in<br>so lately's attempt to lift the Moon<br>cute dog pictures that will work<br>maybe I didn't pick these pictures<br>in all of the seats you're sitting in<br>imagine there are sensors<br>and they're capturing data about you and<br>have been since you arrived here and<br>when I was talking through that kind of<br>dystopian nightwear nightmare of being<br>under cameras and microphones and<br>everybody's mood was coming down and<br>we're all starting going but this was<br>going to be fun or we should stay down<br>and watch Corey but instead the sensors<br>are going I think we need to lighten the<br>mood a bit<br>what can we do to lighten the mood I<br>know random picture of cute dogs and you<br>know let's be clear about this they are<br>very cute dogs so of course they're<br>going to lift the mood and make people<br>feel better<br>so<br>we can use these inferences<br>to drive the outputs that we give to you<br>we can say well what does it mean to say<br>the people in the back row are really<br>grumpy and the people in the front row<br>are moderately grumpy well show them one<br>picture and we'll show the people over<br>here a picture and we'll see from the<br>centers in the seats<br>whose mood lifts the best is this the<br>right picture and again we can start<br>learning in it so we can do things<br>perhaps that are a little more playful<br>doesn't have to be just this dystopian<br>idea of the door that won't let you out<br>or the robot that sends you to bed<br>because it thinks you need an early<br>night because you're getting up early in<br>the morning<br>what about we think about different ways<br>of using the data and saying well let's<br>imagine rather than collecting all of<br>this data so when I leave here today and<br>I download the seat data I go well<br>people in row one they really enjoyed it<br>people in the back right corner not so<br>much<br>rather than individually pinpointing<br>each of you and going well I must<br>remember tomorrow to be nice to this<br>person because they had a bad night<br>we can gather all of that data together<br>and maybe do something more playful with<br>it so say well what if we could capture<br>all of this mood data and just I don't<br>know have some big display somewhere and<br>rather than it being this kind of<br>one-to-one mapping of well you look at<br>this big screen and you go oh that pixel<br>there I think that's Duty in her office<br>she looks cross it's much more playful<br>than that<br>so we're doing some some work in the<br>area at the moment just to think about<br>what it means to gather all of that data<br>together and smoosh it up and then just<br>throw it back out to the universe in<br>some kind of visualization<br>what impact does that have on people do<br>they notice do they care<br>and more interestingly because we don't<br>want to dig down into people's<br>individual data we don't want to to know<br>that the person in row four seat three<br>had a kind of minor Spike of excitement<br>at slide three and then dozed off for<br>the rest of my talk<br>but they might want to know that<br>so once we've gathered all of this data<br>and mushed it all together how do we<br>unpack it all again or how does the<br>individual person unpack it again and<br>can you see where your data is gone<br>can I look at it and go well if I see<br>I'm here and I'm somehow I've popped up<br>over here how did my data get there what<br>route did it take<br>so you'll sometimes hear people talk<br>about things like provenance like well<br>what's happened to this artifact and who<br>has done it imagine if you could do that<br>with your data so that when you go home<br>tonight and you log on to Facebook and<br>it's weirdly showing you an ad for<br>something that you mentioned in passing<br>over the tea break to your friend you<br>can then look behind that and go how did<br>how did that bit of information get<br>there where is my data traveled in order<br>to get there and how do I tag it somehow<br>so that I know it's me how can I see it<br>and in that way perhaps we can pull back<br>a little bit and go it's not that we<br>shouldn't be doing interesting things<br>with technology<br>but rather than letting the Technology<br>Drive what it is we do why do we let the<br>people drive what it is we do<br>think about<br>who is in control of this and put the<br>the user firmly back in the center<br>so when we look at a picture like this<br>so in the middle of the iot The Internet<br>of Things<br>we should kind of cut that little<br>picture out and put<br>the human user writing the scent<br>and think about what it means to to<br>understand not just what they want to do<br>but what the impact is<br>of all of this technology interacting<br>upon the user<br>so there's there's a thing you again you<br>may have some of you in Computing will a<br>photo about this and some others of you<br>may have as well the thing called the<br>digital twin where you have some some<br>system some machine and you create a<br>model of it a kind of replica and you<br>feed the replica the data from the Real<br>Running system and it allows you to<br>reason about the system and to seed if<br>it's doing the right thing or if it's<br>going to go wrong at some point<br>so imagine if we could do that with the<br>human user say well what about we create<br>the digital twin of the user and as<br>we're collecting this data rather than<br>just using it to determine should I open<br>the door should I send them to bed early<br>whatever it is we actually use that to<br>understand what the impact is of living<br>in these environments what does it mean<br>to be in the middle of all of this what<br>does it mean to be the human in the loop<br>and have all this idea around us does it<br>actually make me feel better<br>or does that over time start kind of<br>chipping away degrading my quality of<br>life and actually making me feel quite<br>miserable<br>so we've got the opportunity to do<br>either of these things we can remember<br>that<br>if the person's at the center everything<br>flows outwards<br>rather than where we're going at the<br>moment where we're sort of turning<br>inwards a little bit and the human just<br>becomes just another part of the machine<br>rather than being able to<br>step out what is it I actually want to<br>do what is it that I want to share how<br>much<br>do I want my home to impinge on me as an<br>autonomous human being maybe I'd quite<br>like to be in control of my own life for<br>a bit<br>not be dictated to by my curtains<br>closing randomly because it's getting<br>so he's sort of gone around in a big<br>circle we started off with this notion<br>of the desktop computer and the human<br>finally be able to go I can control this<br>with a keyboard and I can play games<br>when I want to and I can do all of these<br>cool things and we've shifted we've just<br>kind of started drifting away because as<br>the technology has got more and more<br>interesting and more and more smart<br>smart<br>the way we think about it and what it<br>does<br>it's very seductive makes us forget<br>about the people at the other end of it<br>and maybe what we should be doing is<br>just taking a step back and putting the<br>person back in the center just reminding<br>ourselves<br>so I started the lecture by<br>borrowing<br>Jacob's idea of 60 year old confusing so<br>I'll end by borrowing from the<br>so what is the most important thing in<br>it's the people<br>if we're not designing something that is<br>helping someone that is doing a task<br>that they want to and that they're in<br>so in exactly 50 minutes I will stop<br>um so we have some time for questions<br>um so I will throw open the floor oh<br>I've had a question site yeah I'll throw<br>open the floor to anyone whose questions<br>yeah<br>parents mainly yeah and it was in the<br>middle of this may be very easy to train<br>yeah yeah so it was the main kind of<br>well I think it has both of those things<br>in in large measures so I think we've<br>already seen some of the kind of great<br>possibilities and opportunities from<br>um that kind of immersive environment<br>and immersive technology and even things<br>like you know<br>the the hot topic of the day the AI<br>um large learning models that you know<br>generate tax so you know people can use<br>them for really amazing things and so<br>the up this huge opportunity the<br>downside of course is that once all of<br>the data is there and all of the people<br>are there and all of these things are<br>being shared<br>you sort of start just losing control of<br>which parts of it belong to you and<br>what's being done with it and how it<br>might be being used in ways that you<br>definitely didn't intend and turn<br>may not be harmful to you but maybe it's<br>harmful to other people and<br>so I think it's not that I think any of<br>these things are in and of themselves<br>terrible<br>it's more that we need to understand<br>that there is a balance of the great<br>things that we can do and also the<br>things that are perhaps less desirable<br>and we should ask people before we kind<br>of go ahead and create them and throw<br>people into them we should actually<br>understand what it means to be in that<br>environment because for most of us we<br>don't know I mean they're going back to<br>1980 when I was playing Space Invaders I<br>had no clue that one day I would walk<br>around with a computer the size of my<br>phone which is way more powerful than<br>any computer I had my hands on at that<br>point and it could do all of these<br>amazing things<br>and it could also track everywhere I<br>went and send my data off to somebody<br>and I have no clue where it's going<br>really<br>guests<br>thank you<br>um such curious can you imagine oh I'm a<br>celebrity how they so was studying the<br>imaginative<br>that algorithmet insane my position stop<br>where the 3D really needs to talk why do<br>you need to even though<br>uh yeah<br>I definitely not the gin and tonic one<br>then I'd like to in control of that but<br>I think you know there are<br>um sort of all jokes aside when people<br>envisage these kind of smart<br>environments and particularly supportive<br>smart environments the intention behind<br>them is really good so he said well in<br>20 years time I may be a little less<br>agile and sprightly than I am now<br>it might be really helpful for me to<br>have technology that allows me to just<br>stay living in my own home and I don't<br>need to move into a care home or a<br>hospital or a rest environment because<br>actually everything I need is in the<br>house<br>so again we have opportunities for that<br>to be really a positive thing but only<br>if we understand what that means to be<br>living in that environment and at the<br>moment I think we talk about you know<br>user experience and understanding how<br>users feel about things I don't think<br>we're close enough to really<br>understanding what the impact of those<br>kind of environments are and how that<br>impacts you and actually maybe I would<br>be better off with the real humans<br>that's<br>how much work<br>um<br>have all the sins without you<br>um but it would actually teach the<br>sister what uh imagine a scenario<br>usually you going home and get pure<br>didn't and doing it but then Atomic<br>lines cut it okay good friend is in the<br>same movie yeah then you have never told<br>that guy<br>um that you actually think didn't and<br>never attended and<br>you you say well who designed this<br>system they had no idea they know<br>nothing about me clearly who would have<br>thought that I would want to Joel<br>so when you spent eight a year on<br>teaching that system<br>all the different scenarios sure if<br>you've got the patience and the well to<br>do that I mean and I say I can't even<br>control my home Robot vacuum cleaner so<br>goodness knows how I'd manage through<br>the whole house but seriously there is<br>actually a lot of work done on even when<br>you think of the sort of smart<br>technology that's becoming quite common<br>like the<br>um kind of the lights and the curtains<br>and the Heat and the home entertainment<br>system so these are you know things that<br>people have in their home and there's a<br>huge amount of work being done in the<br>HCI Community about creating ways for<br>people to do exactly that to kind of set<br>them up and control them because they're<br>really complex you know sometimes I<br>can't even set my sky to record<br>something and that's like four screens<br>and two buttons so when you've got all<br>of these interacting things and you've<br>got to think about all of the scenarios<br>um and there's always going to be a<br>scenario that I haven't thought of you<br>know the but the mystery person who<br>turns up or whatever it is so<br>there's something again it's very<br>appealing to think well I'll just let<br>the system observe and learn because if<br>I have to go to all the bother of trying<br>to teach it to do something we could be<br>here a long time and I'll probably give<br>up halfway through the same way I do<br>oh I you should be worried about the<br>um so not not with us but there's a lot<br>of people around the world doing this<br>kind of work so the FDA in the U.S who<br>um are responsible for saying that these<br>devices are fit for purpose and go out<br>into the world they've have they've sort<br>of been running a project now for a<br>number of years<br>um around doing the kind of safety<br>modeling that that I was talking about<br>so there are a lot of people doing that<br>work it certainly wasn't just the two of<br>us and then we said oh we'll go do<br>something else now<br>um so you know it is a really important<br>thing because it's ongoing because there<br>are always new medical devices and new<br>modes of interaction and again you know<br>you<br>just as sort of one of those those weird<br>side effects you there was a time<br>um where in various medical settings you<br>would walk in and there would be<br>instructions saying please don't charge<br>your phone in this socket do not unplug<br>this thing and charge your phone and<br>please don't you know plug your phone<br>into this USB socket because people just<br>go oh yeah that looks like a PowerPoint<br>I'll plug it in so this comes with huge<br>complexities not just of the devices but<br>the the context that they're in<br>um I didn't really even get on to<br>talking about context that such an<br>important part of any design it's not<br>just can the person use the devices can<br>the person use the device when they're<br>doing this job in this environment when<br>these things are happening it was really<br>crucial in forestry<br>um because it's an in the wild study and<br>we couldn't be there with them<br>um so one of our collaborators who'd<br>done some work early on said you know if<br>you go in and try and watch what the<br>forestry workers are doing what they're<br>doing is watching you making sure you<br>don't get killed by a tree and nobody<br>does their normal kind of work pattern<br>so you'd leave these things in the wild<br>then you'd see really weird data and go<br>wait a minute this guy had no heart rate<br>for 10 minutes at three o'clock on<br>Tuesday the oh maybe the technology<br>stopped working<br>wait a minute the same guy had no heart<br>rate for 10 minutes on Wednesday at<br>three o'clock<br>and the same thing on Thursday<br>what was he doing well he probably<br>wanted to go off and have a smoker and<br>thought that the technology would tell<br>on him so he'll just take it off and go<br>and have a quick cigarette and then come<br>back of course if he'd kept it on would<br>have been none the wiser but you know<br>there's all of these contexts that are<br>that are really important<br>um so that work and the modeling of<br>those devices and all of the number<br>entry is a huge thing on those devices<br>because they're all different so there's<br>lots of people doing that so so worry<br>about them but not to the point where<br>okay yes<br>so the question that means and about<br>Bill Sage<br>um even that a lot of<br>yes<br>in my name anyway a lot of those things<br>that operate from the other song Channel<br>what's the top how do we read in about<br>the situation where yeah it's a reason<br>while the waiting let me get sometimes<br>an assistant<br>here<br>we don't even need to ask what happens<br>we've seen it right we've seen it<br>recently with the storms and people not<br>being able to get money out of the bank<br>or pay anything with fpos because<br>there's no power and there's no internet<br>and the same thing with our forestry<br>workers they're in remote areas where<br>there's no internet connectivity at the<br>moment and even presuming there will be<br>you know in the near future there'll be<br>internet everywhere things break and<br>they go down and again you're kind of<br>locked in your house because there's a<br>power outage or you know nothing works<br>because there's no power so now<br>everybody has to have their own personal<br>generator in their backup system<br>um slightly at attention to that some<br>some other work that I'm doing with some<br>uh some Comics down at Vic is looking at<br>kind of the implications of when we<br>digitize these kind of everyday things<br>like Finance when you when all your<br>banking suddenly is turned into Apps and<br>mobile devices what does that mean for<br>people who don't have a mobile phone<br>they may have one that the entire family<br>shares so whose backing details can you<br>see on that whose banking app is on<br>there or I don't have a laptop or I<br>don't have internet connectivity how do<br>I transact in this world<br>so those are really important questions<br>because it's not just well we'll have<br>some Fail-Safe within the system so that<br>it will kind of fail gracefully but you<br>know if the power goes out and the<br>internet goes out all bets are off and<br>we're kind of back to lighting a candle<br>and warming up some water over a camping<br>you can have the last Quest<br>so he's strong to ground with problem<br>methods yes and you know currents and I<br>guess the whole thing and you go somehow<br>at least your frustration<br>tactics of Technology yeah<br>right<br>well I think saying I've gone around in<br>a circle is it's kind of very true<br>because this notion of building models<br>is still something I can't quite let go<br>of so this you know this idea of the<br>digital twin of the human and the person<br>and actually understanding understanding<br>what<br>what is happening and what the impact of<br>these things are via simulations and<br>models still very appealing to me so<br>um beyond that I don't know I think I<br>think I mean I think<br>ethics I wouldn't have called it ethics<br>but the the sort of that that human<br>centeredness of everything to do with<br>technology has always been there it just<br>kind of expresses itself perhaps in<br>different ways now and I think about it<br>more from an ethical perspective<br>um I don't know I'd love to be able to<br>say I would do a model driven ethics<br>thing about something you know that<br>would be great but<br>modeling humans is really hard it turned<br>that<br>human behavior is quite unpredictable<br>with that thing you always tell students<br>go well you can design the system and<br>you can do the nicest user interface and<br>inputs and outputs and if a person walks<br>in and they just bang their elbows on<br>the keyboard what's going to happen<br>you just have to make assumptions at<br>some point that people are going to try<br>and do the right thing<br>but at least you have to kind of offer</p></main><footer style="margin-top: 2rem; background: #0001; padding: 2rem; text-align: center;"><p>We Are The University</p><ul
