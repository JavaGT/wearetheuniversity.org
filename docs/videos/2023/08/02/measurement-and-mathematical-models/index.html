computing at the<br>University of waikato so this is a meth<br>themed math<br>more but um he has any features<br>out of what I do in addition to the to<br>the following and that<br>physics and all of that and so this talk<br>the idea is it's you know measurements<br>and models and kind of how those things<br>play off each other and how they<br>complement each other and how they are<br>sometimes different<br>um this I just wanted to put an extra<br>picture here so this is actually a deep<br>recorder it looks somewhat like a<br>cassette tape that's that style of<br>recording device which is one of the<br>ones used on the Voyages spacecraft so<br>basically for 45 years this thing is<br>being sort of recording and playing back<br>uh and it still works as well<br>I guess they don't make it like they<br>uh yeah so that would have been built<br>sometime in the 70s which sort of lines<br>up nicely with this idea of 50 years of<br>um so I I don't usually do this with an<br>overview at the start of my talks but I<br>thought at least give you some sense of<br>where I'm going it's a little bit of a<br>Meandering sort of story<br>um so I'll talk a little bit about<br>models statistical models physical<br>models uh measurements<br>actually me<br>um and then switch to Voyage of<br>spacecraft right so this is now outer<br>space fire away from Earth you're<br>measuring stuff<br>um so what does that mean how does that<br>work<br>and then the heliosphere which is sort<br>of this larger structure sitting<br>outside as well in a sense the solar<br>system sits inside the Helios here<br>that's sort of the next largest<br>structure and voyages are exploring that<br>area<br>um and then switch a little bit to Ibex<br>which is another type of spacecraft<br>picking measurements but in a very<br>different way to avoyages I'll talk<br>about that<br>um and with Ibex we're able to deduce<br>the magnetic fields that's sort of far<br>away from Earth basically out where the<br>Voyages are and Beyond and in that far<br>away area of space so we can deduce that<br>using Ibex a voyager is actually sitting<br>inside that space also taking measure<br>right so the real question is are those<br>things the same<br>does it does it all make sense<br>um and so that's sort of one of the key<br>some of the climax of the talk as it<br>would because it turns out some bits<br>don't quite work<br>um<br>yes uh and then so we tried to uh we<br>sort of put this together we went to<br>publish it and then<br>because we sort of disagreed with what<br>Voyager was measuring it was like well<br>you know that's what caused 45 year old<br>Mission that's cost a billion dollars<br>maybe you're wrong maybe void is not<br>wrong you know that's so I think so<br>there's a there's just a little bit<br>about the peer review but there's a nice<br>okay so what is a mathematical model uh<br>this is just my definition I guess I<br>could online like everybody does and say<br>variant Webster says<br>um but the way I think of mathematical<br>models are are a way to fill in the gaps<br>between the things that you know things<br>that you measured sort of absolute<br>things what's in between well you have a<br>model for that<br>that's one one way to use a model maybe<br>you have some measurements but they're<br>sort of a bit noisy so your model kind<br>of draws a nice line through that<br>that's a good approximation to<br>uh to how things maybe should be if your<br>measurements were perfect<br>and the main reason to have a model is<br>is to make predictions right you want to<br>sort of<br>you want to measure a certain amount of<br>stuff and then make some predictions<br>about other related things I mean<br>ideally what you want to do is<br>extrapolate so to go you know forward in<br>time<br>go to another region of<br>space or whatever your parameters happen<br>to be<br>so the mathematical models can't really<br>exist without the measurements but<br>they're sort of a way to extend the<br>functionality of the measure<br>um so weather forecasting sort of works<br>like this right so you have uh<br>so we've got<br>you know things about how weather works<br>that's not exactly a data point but it<br>is a way to uh to understand what's<br>happening you have lots of data from<br>ground stations so you know about<br>air pressure you know humidity you know<br>temperature lots of places lots of time<br>uh you have data from satellites they're<br>looking down on the the clouds the<br>weather patterns how things are moving<br>um<br>and so that tells you a lot about what's<br>going on right now<br>the value of whether<br>we do want to do is take this forward<br>right you know what the weather is today<br>but what will it be tomorrow or next<br>week so that's that's sort of the<br>uh extrapolation sense and to do that<br>you need models and inevitably<br>computational power<br>you need an understanding of how airflow<br>Works how precipitation helps these<br>that's not what I do but it's anyways<br>um so<br>I<br>none of my statistics colleagues are<br>here so I can say this<br>uh I I tend to think of models I mean<br>the general model causes a mixture of<br>stuff but this sort of a statistical<br>element and then there's sort of<br>physical elements and you could isolate<br>those you could say well there's a<br>statistical model is sorry this is a bit<br>wordy but you can either listen to me or<br>read it<br>um<br>so it's just a good model<br>you have a bunch of data and you you<br>look for patterns in this data and<br>you in principle don't need to know<br>what's causing those patterns if you can<br>identify them then they are there and<br>you can follow those patterns<br>and you can use those patterns to make<br>predictions right so it tends to work<br>really well if you've got loads of data<br>and if you are<br>if you're trying to sort of probe the<br>world within that space where you have<br>always done right so this sort of fits<br>in into into machine learning these<br>ideas I hope I'm not saying the wrong<br>thing there but it feels like you know<br>in a very loose sense that's<br>where it goes right so in this really<br>simplest form that's just straight lines<br>through some data all right so this is<br>just some example of the internet uh<br>this is to do with some white products<br>from a volcanic eruption and get a set<br>amount of this stuff and a certain<br>amount of that stuff and you you just<br>take some measure which you take a<br>sample you say I got this much<br>this is silicon dioxide this one's for<br>that stuff then you took another<br>measurement and it's a bit more a bit<br>less<br>and you don't know for sure whether you<br>should draw a straight line through it<br>but it seems reasonable and it certainly<br>is a good estimate<br>you'd expect next time you you find some<br>stuff that should lie somewhere near<br>that line<br>so that's a predictor even though you<br>don't this doesn't tell you anything<br>uh yeah this is it<br>so one of the downsides of statistical<br>models is that doesn't necessarily tell<br>you you know what's causing what so this<br>you know about you know a joke from XKCD<br>but uh basically these guys you know<br>this idea that uh since people started<br>using cell phones cancer rates have gone<br>up so maybe cell phones are you know bad<br>for you uh so this guy looks at this<br>data and he says well yep I can see a<br>rise in cancer cases in Horizon cell<br>phone usage so clearly cancer is causing<br>cell phones<br>cancer came first cell phones went up<br>so you can you can sometimes<br>if you try to get too much out of a<br>statistical model it can actually Lead<br>um so the the other sort of extreme is a<br>physical model uh and I should point out<br>this first three lines there is not a<br>physical model this is actually so just<br>to go on up so Kepler's laws are laws of<br>for Kepler's laws of planetary motion<br>um so this these are relationships that<br>Kepler obtained by carefully mapping<br>where or where all the planets were<br>actually Mars mostly<br>um and the heat deduced that landlords<br>follow ellipses and that the sun is at<br>one of the foci of the ellipse and then<br>there's another law about equal areas<br>times and there's actually a third law<br>about<br>the orbital period related to<br>some other thing about the size the<br>orbit<br>but the the point here is that by<br>careful observation and effectively<br>fitting a line through these points<br>Kepler was able to produce these<br>fundamental relationships<br>and so it's a statistical model in that<br>sense<br>um you can achieve the same thing with a<br>physical model<br>which starts very differently you start<br>with some basic relationship between<br>some fundamental parameters<br>and you build up the model from there so<br>you start with something very simple and<br>you then make it more complicated<br>naturally gain some complexity<br>but by doing that you kind of know where<br>you came from so you you kind of know<br>why things are happening because you're<br>connecting this model in a sort of a<br>causal way so if you know about Newton's<br>Laws right so f equals m a is sort of<br>one of Newton's Laws Newton also has a<br>law of gravitation that looks something<br>like this<br>formulas don't matter you're always your<br>mathematician so please follow they're<br>actually easy supposed to be public<br>lecture where I say don't worry if you<br>don't know what this means<br>um<br>but just starting with those two things<br>and then doing a whole bunch of calculus<br>uh you can actually derive you can show<br>that just those two initial assumptions<br>lead you to Kepler's laws so this is<br>kind of very cool thing where you can<br>actually<br>uh you know you you observe some<br>relationships and then you're able to<br>derive equations that<br>uh the big difference is that<br>with a physical model you can make<br>sort of causal predictions because you<br>know what's causing what so what<br>happened was we had these laws for<br>planetary motion people were looking at<br>Uranus and saying hmm you're in a sort<br>of wobbling around a bit more than you<br>would expect<br>uh<br>you know that's so either gravity is<br>wrong or you know maybe there's<br>something the fundamental assumptions if<br>that's not the case<br>there's only really one explanation it<br>means something else is pushing Uranus<br>around<br>and if it's a planet<br>then<br>you can basically calculate where this<br>planet should be<br>and they're able to do that and<br>once once they sort of went through this<br>process and they could tell the<br>observatory okay tonight look at this<br>place this location in the sky and<br>indeed they found Neptune right there so<br>this is a really<br>uh household thing that physical models<br>uh okay a little bit about covert<br>modeling so this is some work that's um<br>gone might<br>his colleague<br>some things we did last year but it's<br>this it's just similar sort of idea you<br>have a causal model you have a physical<br>model okay again don't worry about the<br>details of these equations it's just to<br>show you that there's mats here<br>and these things need to be solved to be<br>able to make predictions<br>but we also have Dart right so this this<br>plot here this is uh January February of<br>last year these blue dots are the number<br>of daily cases in the waikato<br>19.<br>and the blue new suburb line is is our<br>model and we can tweak some of the<br>parameters in the model to King this<br>Lambda and some of these other things to<br>make it<br>fit the data as best we can<br>once we have that we say well<br>you can just let the model continue<br>right make a forecast<br>right so<br>that's what this is right so this this<br>little bit down here is is all of that<br>and then you just let it go forward<br>so you're able to forecast what will<br>happen it's not guaranteed of course but<br>it's a pretty reasonable estimate<br>turns out I checked this the other day<br>what actually happened was the peak was<br>a lot sooner early February it was<br>similar height maybe slightly lower so<br>and then it went down again so<br>it wasn't perfect but you know the<br>hospitals or the dhbs are sort of at<br>least happy to have some kind of sense<br>okay so that's models<br>uh so what about measurements<br>measurements seem easier right it seems<br>like<br>you know we've got your kitchen scales<br>and note device download<br>right so you've got your kitchen scale<br>so how happy is this plant well<br>just put it in there reload once in<br>100 grams 150 grams<br>there's your answer it's it's absolute<br>it's a measurement<br>uh it's not quite that simple if you<br>look inside scales or<br>and the same is true or many instruments<br>uh you know that that number doesn't<br>just pop out of nowhere right this is<br>actually stuff going on inside here so<br>there's normally a spring in one of<br>these sort of scales and so then you<br>deal with Focus law which is tells you<br>about<br>how springs work<br>so there's actually a theory kind of<br>sitting inside your instrument<br>the other problem is<br>um<br>well<br>yeah and you can<br>reset zero on right so suppose I don't<br>have<br>um delt puts the Boston all that weapons<br>of the Jews<br>make it point zero then I can lose you<br>something else the same thing but in a<br>different way<br>um<br>and that's<br>that's what's called calibration so you<br>want to make sure that your instrument<br>is reading the right thing that zero is<br>actually zero High difference you start<br>off with the the scale pointing at 100<br>you stick something on you're gonna get<br>a number bigger than 100 when it maybe<br>wasn't really that's not the correct<br>weight so you need to know where zero is<br>and actually there's a second version of<br>this which is you need to know how far<br>should it move to go up by let's say 100<br>grams<br>so there are different types of<br>calibrations this<br>I'm spending extra time on this because<br>calibration will come up as part of<br>Voyager<br>again<br>Okay so<br>there was something about holes we know<br>something about measurements<br>um it's something more not more<br>interesting but something different uh<br>so in the 1970s and if it was planned<br>even earlier<br>um NASA launched two spacecraft<br>uh called Voyager 1 and Voyager two can<br>imagine I mean the Voyager part is full<br>but it's called the one with two<br>um<br>uh and the the reason that they were<br>actually sort of in a rush to launch<br>um in 1977 is that it was an alignment<br>of these Pilots Jupiter Saturn Uranus<br>and and also naptube so by launching at<br>that time you can basically swing by and<br>see all four of them so this was<br>actually if you want to tie that back to<br>modeling clearly somebody's doing<br>modeling to show that this willing would<br>so that that was the motivation<br>he's a it was a big mission<br>initially even more costly and<br>extravagant than this but of course it<br>get trimmed down a little bit so Voyager<br>one so actually Voyager 2 was launched<br>first and its parts should take it takes<br>it past all four planets Voyager one was<br>launched a little later and actually the<br>reason they launched it slightly later<br>was that if there was a problem with<br>voyager 2's launch they could reorient<br>Voyager One to to then that one could at<br>least see all sorts<br>but once words or two was on its way to<br>see these outer ones they sent Voyager<br>one only to look at Jupiter in them<br>Saturn and then actually exit in a<br>so<br>so this is a kind of instrument<br>it's actually really a whole just a<br>whole bunch of instruments all just<br>jammed together you know we don't we<br>tend to think of a spacecraft like you<br>know the space shuttle with little nice<br>wings and all sorts it's just a metal<br>rack with lots of stuff attached to it<br>you can see a picture of it here you can<br>see the size of you know humans it's<br>it's a big it's a thick thing<br>I think it weighs like 500 kilos or<br>something<br>a big heavy<br>piece of equipment lots of as you can<br>sort of see this one of the original<br>diagrams lots of uh<br>instruments<br>for them right things different ways of<br>measuring all sorts of different things<br>um currently the experiments that are<br>running are the uh are those<br>five although Voyager ones asthma<br>instrument is actually broken so what do<br>one is not one of us the key one is the<br>magnetic field<br>that<br>thinking about time uh just I'll just<br>quickly say so how would you how are a<br>spacecraft so normally what you would do<br>for almost every other spacecraft is you<br>just put some solar panels on it get a<br>good view of the Sun and when you're<br>away from the earth so<br>it's fine but of course Voyager is going<br>far away from the Sun pretty quickly the<br>the energy that's hitting you is<br>decreases to become insignificant<br>and so instead they you know this is<br>sort of 70 solution just throw a lump of<br>plutonium in there and it'll be good<br>um<br>and actually that that works<br>exceptionally well as you really think<br>about this<br>uh this is I don't know how big it is<br>this sort of size<br>um<br>been giving several hundred Watts<br>continuously for 45 years<br>obviously no battery no yes it's so much<br>better than anything else you could have<br>met<br>and they expect you know what happens of<br>course is<br>these are this is radioactive which is<br>good because that's how you can extract<br>some energy from it but it's also bad<br>because it decays and eventually it'll<br>appear all together<br>so over time it's losing<br>and so things have to be turned off and<br>eventually sometime in about 10 years<br>time it won't even be enough power for<br>it<br>um so voyages past the planets that was<br>in the 80s already<br>um this this diagram the the uh talk<br>about I'll talk a bit more about what<br>after passing the planet so if you if<br>you think about this picture the sun is<br>here there's these little swirly things<br>that's the orbits of the planets then<br>there's this barrier boundary whatever<br>you want to call it called the<br>termination shock both void just crossed<br>this and it was clear that that this<br>happened you couldn't see it in the um<br>the readings on various instruments<br>uh so that's in the in the 2000s then in<br>the 2010s they crossed the heliopause<br>and so now both void is actually uh in a<br>sense outside this this thing called the<br>heliosphere and I'll explain what that<br>is on the next page but it's this sort<br>of larger structure that that sits<br>around the solar system so it's not on<br>the scale of other stars other stars<br>hundreds of meters away from here so<br>it's still quite close by like bigger<br>uh right so what is the heliosphere<br>um<br>so here you know maybe start on the<br>right hand side this is a model from<br>1961<br>uh obviously 1961 nobody's<br>solving stuff on super computers a<br>little bit of a computer to calculate<br>these<br>streamline section but<br>basically the heliosphere is formed when<br>you have<br>it's really the interaction between two<br>flows you can think of this like a<br>liquid or a fluid or a gas<br>technically it's not quite any of that<br>but<br>as a as an analogy it works pretty well<br>so you could think if the Sun is here<br>and it's<br>um basically there's a constant outflow<br>of ionized gas it doesn't matter if you<br>don't know what that is but it's solar<br>wind it's just outflow from the Sun<br>continuous Non-Stop<br>and that fills space you might say wait<br>wasn't space supposed to be empty right<br>thank you yes it is well it's not that's<br>yes uh it's very low density so better<br>vacuum that we have on Earth but that<br>doesn't mean it's completely<br>and so actually all its space<br>interplanetary spaces filled with solar<br>wind<br>so I get I get asked to review papers on<br>solar and wind energy<br>because my my papers have the word solar<br>wind in it but I mean in a very<br>difficult they're quite adamant I don't<br>know you can review this<br>um so this is this number one I guess<br>I'm trying to sort of Link this so all<br>of this stuff in here is you can trace<br>it back it came from the Sun but once<br>you pass this boundary which we call the<br>heliopause you're out in here and this<br>is also similar sort of partially<br>ionized very low density gas sort of<br>like a vacuum but not really and that's<br>the interstellar medium it's what we<br>call it it's really<br>the gas that's floating around in the<br>galaxy and so the sun is sort of moving<br>slowly through this gas<br>left to right so from the sun's point of<br>view that interstellar medium is sort of<br>flowing around us<br>and these these plasmas or these these<br>gases don't really mix<br>except maybe far Downstream<br>absolutely this front pipe the the seem<br>so that's the the heliosphere of course<br>uh so that was a model from 1961. here's<br>a recent model<br>I threw some equations up just to show<br>again that there's some real maths here<br>this is not just uh us uh playing with<br>The Itchy sketch or something<br>um so here's a rendering a<br>three-dimensional rendering of these<br>flows so again you've got the sun in the<br>middle the solar Windows flowing out<br>you've got this termination shot you've<br>got this heliopore surface<br>and in this picture we also have this<br>yellow thing which is<br>due to neutral hydrogen so in the solar<br>wind we don't have much neutral hydrogen<br>but Interstellar space<br>again it's all low density but compared<br>to the other stuff there's quite a bit<br>of neutral High Duty and it turns out to<br>so yeah just as connected back to<br>Computing so we uh we run these things<br>off computer clusters<br>to solve these equations uh Fortran 90 I<br>hate to admit it but this is the code<br>from that solves this part<br>from a colleague and that's actually<br>floor trans 77 now agree you are getting<br>into assisting Genesis Computing<br>um<br>nevertheless it you know it works as<br>good as any modern language you know<br>once you compile it it runs it runs<br>great<br>um right so what did we do we did<br>Voyager that we did a heliosphere we<br>turned to Ibex so ibex<br>is another space bar right a lot simpler<br>it's about sort of this big<br>uh it orbits the earth it's not out<br>there exploring anything it's just<br>orbiting the Earth however it's got<br>these two<br>uh Ibex low and Ibex High<br>very similar they sort of do very<br>similar things except that Ibex high is<br>sensitive to high Energies<br>Ibex lowers the low energies and these<br>actually measure neutral hydrogen right<br>so I sent neutral hydrogen is one of the<br>key ingredients actually that's of stuff<br>that's floating through the hemisphere<br>but it's coming from outside<br>in Olive's Journey from outside the<br>heliosphere to Ibex it's been<br>interacting with pieces of the Helios<br>fit so it sort of has some imprint of<br>um of those interactions and so it<br>doesn't directly tell us what's going on<br>out there but we can infer<br>so what so what did Ibex see<br>the ibix was launched in 2009 which is<br>quite quite some time after Voyager<br>um and up on the top right here this is<br>this is<br>oh yeah maybe I should say<br>um so Ibex orbits the earth<br>spins around and as the Earth orbits<br>around the Sun as it's spinning it's<br>basically mapping out the whole sky so<br>sort of the the primary data product<br>from Ibex is the sort of matte but it's<br>a map of the sky<br>right so the sky of course in some<br>senses is a sphere but you can swish it<br>out like you would on a on a map of the<br>world or something so make it look like<br>that<br>um and and this really is the first map<br>of Ibex High first map of Ibex load and<br>you probably noticed<br>something there right and something<br>strong feature in this map and this was<br>unexpected we expected just sort of some<br>smooth bumps and things<br>uh instead there's this quite bright<br>band<br>turned out that the uh I wasn't at that<br>meeting but I heard that people said<br>let's not call it a band or a belt it<br>sounds so masculine can't we call it<br>something else and one of The Graduate<br>students said well that would rip it<br>known as the ivex rivet<br>so that we feel something like more<br>delicate<br>and of course the first thing the Ibex<br>guys did when they started seeing this<br>coming up in their mat<br>well something must be wrong<br>you're seeing this strong intensity just<br>in the small region of the sky<br>why would that be<br>something must be wrong<br>time checking there instrumentation<br>checking the software but no it turns<br>out this is<br>this is actually right<br>or at least there's no nothing<br>yeah<br>a reason to believe it's not right and<br>in fact the fact that you can see this<br>in Ibex low as well Ibex low is not as<br>sensitive as ivix height but you can see<br>it and these are in independent<br>instruments so I've always seen the same<br>thing that's also<br>kind of tells you this is probably right<br>so<br>the other so the first question was what<br>is this<br>um and even in the first uh paper from<br>the Ibex Mission which is the Commerce<br>2009<br>uh already leading up to the publishing<br>that paper<br>um my colleagues and I had done some<br>simulations of the heliosphere<br>uh with magnetic fields and<br>what we noticed or in fact talking to<br>them what they noticed was that where in<br>the model the magnetic field sort of<br>drapes over this heliopore structure<br>right so this is looking from the<br>outside in towards the heliosphere<br>where it drapes over seems to be where<br>this ribbon is<br>and so<br>basically they you know they didn't want<br>to jump to conclusions but they did want<br>to include this uh in in more projects<br>like so this is actually the cover<br>science uh and my colleague and I were<br>called occlusion and then of course<br>became the question okay seems to be<br>um so actually they were probably<br>15 or something different proposals put<br>forward as to what this ribbon is what's<br>causing it all sorts of different ideas<br>but you know and that's all good to<br>start thinking but it's very hard to<br>sort of prove or disprove an idea unless<br>you can somehow quantify this<br>and so what I did was one of the ones<br>that I liked seemed to make sense to me<br>I implemented that into our simulation<br>so then you suddenly<br>you can put some quantities in right you<br>can say well the simulation says there's<br>this much hydrogen<br>had a bit of a model<br>actually turns out almost no sort of<br>free<br>parameters and you can say well<br>if that's true do we get a ribbon and in<br>fact here's um so I'm plotting this<br>ribbon in a slightly different way this<br>is 2014. um<br>what was actually observed so this is<br>the data from Ibex what was observed<br>actually is that if you look correctly<br>in the sky it's a circle so you see very<br>certain so that's<br>uh this black line is a perfect circle<br>you can see the the ribbon sort of<br>following this around so this is data<br>right so this is I guess a statistical<br>analysis<br>find a pattern<br>you identified you say well it's like<br>Circle and so forth but you don't have a<br>mechanism<br>but I put a mechanism into our model<br>into the simulation and was able to get<br>a very similar looking<br>uh ribbon<br>and so once you start to get some some<br>strong correlation like that you said I<br>might be onto something<br>so<br>so the interesting thing actually is<br>that that<br>in the model in the simulation<br>the the properties of that ribbon that<br>you get are quite sensitive to the<br>interstellar magnetic field and so what<br>a different<br>strengths of the magnetic fields that's<br>this uh this sort of along the x-axis<br>here this isn't microgauss<br>in and pesos 0.1 Nano Tesla<br>um it doesn't really matter this is a<br>statistical analysis so what you're<br>actually doing is you're minimizing the<br>error between the model and the data and<br>so wherever this is low means that these<br>parameters are sort of the best fit<br>and so we're actually able to deduce<br>if this model of the ribbon is correct<br>that the likely we were able to just the<br>likely properties basically the<br>direction and the strength of the<br>interstellar magnetic field<br>so there's a really<br>you know<br>you saw the Publishers and it's all<br>right and talk about it but when you<br>reflect on it what you really bizarre<br>right you're counting hydrogen atoms<br>at Earth and somehow it's telling you<br>what the magnetic field looks like<br>100 billion kilometers away<br>you know sometimes you have to just stop<br>and appreciate you know how cool the<br>um okay so ibex<br>so so effectively this is what became<br>sort of known as the Ibex magnetic field<br>in some ways<br>Ibex didn't measure a magnetic field but<br>in another sense without Ibex we<br>wouldn't know this either so it's it's a<br>mixture between the model and the data<br>that allows us to get an estimate of the<br>and so Voyager is measuring magnetic<br>field as well<br>um so how does that work well<br>again it's not as simple as as we were<br>saying right I said initially<br>measurements are not just you know you<br>push a button you get a number and it's<br>it's absolute this thing's happening<br>inside the instrument so the way the<br>Voyager instrument works<br>it works on something called helps<br>and<br>there's sort of a middle count rate 2048<br>which would be zero magnetic field above<br>that<br>you would have oglet of magnetic field<br>below that it's negative magnetic field<br>so<br>that doesn't sound too bad except<br>there's a there's a big problem and that<br>is that you've got this big metal<br>spacecraft floating through space<br>and over time it's accumulating its own<br>magnetic field<br>so now<br>you've got a measurement of the magnetic<br>field but it's actually what you've<br>measured is a combination of two things<br>the combination of the spacecraft field<br>and plasma fuel which is really the one<br>you're interested in<br>but you only have one number so you<br>don't know how much each one is<br>contributed<br>um here this guy<br>very clever tricks here actually<br>um<br>so for the X and Y direction of the<br>magnetic fields so<br>this there's really three directions<br>to a magnetic field because it's a<br>vector so it's kind of a points in a<br>certain direction so you have an X<br>component the Y component and the Z<br>component<br>and the Z component is in the direction<br>that Voyager is moving the X and Y are<br>and what they do actually to calibrate<br>the X and Y components is they roll the<br>space every two month sounds it sounds<br>really risky this is a 45 year old thing<br>that's been floating through space<br>uh so many you know billions of<br>kilometers<br>and now you say oh yeah just do a few<br>rolls for me uh again but this is how it<br>works this is how it's designed<br>and and it works really well so you see<br>here this was in 2008<br>so this is the X magnetic field this is<br>a child right so they're giving these<br>counts here they start to roll and the<br>thing sort of wobbles around what they<br>really done if you think about this one<br>I suppose I didn't have this nice and<br>zero<br>some something extra and I didn't quite<br>know<br>so here I've got about two things<br>happening I've got the weight of the<br>plant<br>blasts some other in the world<br>like we can actually do this kind of<br>trick right so if you stop the rollers<br>what we'll see is that particularly at<br>90 degrees<br>I'm not putting only force on those<br>um scales I'm actually what it's reading<br>here should be basically at zero you<br>could even continue this<br>kind of get the negative version<br>see what that looks like<br>and see what this reads and hotline the<br>tone should be zero well it's the same<br>sort of trick<br>so by Rolling the spacecraft you're able<br>to<br>deduce where the zero is for the X and<br>the Y<br>you can see that as they're doing this<br>roll the Z component<br>not changing at all<br>and that's because that's the axis of<br>rotation so that one<br>you're not able to calibrate<br>that's a real shame<br>however<br>again before launching this mission of<br>course they have to have all these<br>things figured out so the way you<br>calibrate the Z magnetic field while<br>you're in the solar wind is<br>using a bit of theory so actually uh<br>only a picture was also white Parker<br>here's again Parker spiral<br>Parker<br>was there at the birth of the idea of<br>the human espresso stuff blamed after<br>him<br>um and so these circular things you'll<br>be spirals that's actually this magnetic<br>field of the Sun that gets sort of<br>spiraled around<br>um anyway the the long and short of it<br>is that<br>on average as you're moving out through<br>the solar wind the Z component the away<br>component of a magnetic field should on<br>average be zero so what they do is when<br>they do one of those roles every couple<br>of months they say oh well<br>how much magnet Z magnetic field have we<br>seen over time and we just set that in<br>such a way that the average is zero we<br>can adjust it up and down a little bit<br>and that's our calibration and it works<br>quite well in the in the solar wind and<br>that's how it was designed<br>the problem is<br>um<br>even past the termination shot you can<br>see in this picture the magnetic field<br>is a bit different there's actually more<br>turbulence<br>turbulence and so and so things are<br>actually a bit different there<br>doesn't work as well<br>um maybe it's still you know still<br>something once you pass the Helio pause<br>though out here that's not the sun's<br>magnetic field that's actually the<br>Galaxy's magnetic field so none of this<br>Theory works at all you can't calibrate<br>the set component of the magnetic seal<br>uh okay so<br>so far what do we got we got Voyager<br>that's measured a magnetic field we've<br>got eye bags that sort of measure the<br>magnetic field or at least helped uh<br>determine a magnetic field big question<br>is do they agree are they the same<br>outside the heliosphere where where we<br>have an estimate from Ibex and we have<br>uh so this uh<br>this is<br>hot off the presses away this is from<br>some of my colleagues from our paper<br>from this year in fact you can see here<br>this was published in March last month<br>um I was gonna build up sometimes<br>uh but you can see here so this is the X<br>and the Y components of the magnetic<br>field so the blue sir the green line is<br>from the simulation which really is this<br>Ibex magnetic field life so this this<br>field<br>agrees with the Ibex ribbon<br>so the Voyager of course<br>you know that there's more stuff<br>the simulation is always a bit idealized<br>nice and smooth and nice and everything<br>is nice and<br>smooth<br>the reality is there's always some bumps<br>there's always some some extra things<br>going on so this is sort of actually a<br>pretty good agreement right it's more or<br>less tracking especially<br>tracking very nicely right so the black<br>line is the Voyager data for that scene<br>component that works pretty well<br>this is Voyager one on the left uh the Y<br>component same sort of thing where it<br>you know that is a little under here but<br>then attacks pretty well goes over but<br>it starts to come back<br>you know<br>looks pretty good Z components<br>take one<br>uh maybe not too bad initially right<br>because this gray area is effectively<br>they're sort of the error so it was<br>somewhat within the era there within the<br>margin of error but then then the<br>measurements start to go down and the<br>measurements basically they're saying<br>there's no magnetic field in the<br>direction that Voyager is moved the<br>field is completely perpendicular<br>but there's no component parallel to its<br>motion which<br>sounds audic I mean if we go back to<br>this<br>to this picture<br>this one<br>this is only just a stretch but you can<br>see on the white The Voyage of one it's<br>sort of popping out the heliosphere out<br>here so it should be in this magnetic<br>field it should have magnetic field<br>sort of lining up with its motion<br>and yet they say it's nothing right so<br>that means the field is sort of flat the<br>field lines will be flat<br>completely not what the model says but<br>even just logically it doesn't seem to<br>um so that's why I do one for it's a two<br>you can again look at the X and the Y<br>components<br>the model<br>uh heliopause is at a slightly different<br>location than the observed healing<br>reports in the data so it does line up<br>exactly but you know more or less you<br>can sincerely believable so is that<br>heater however we even have the opposite<br>sign<br>so that that is really strange however<br>if you go back closer to the heliopause<br>uh the difference not really that much<br>the in fact data is strange because what<br>the data is saying is that close to the<br>heliopause the magnetic field was<br>pointing into the heliosphere and then<br>after some time it was pointing away so<br>somehow the magnetic field should flip<br>it doesn't really make sense<br>um so when we first submitted this for<br>publication we said look the X and Y<br>components agree really well this is a<br>really good result Z component does it<br>really but hey wouldn't have expected<br>however<br>submitted this for publications of the<br>site insight into the peer reviewing<br>process<br>the editor of course should pass this<br>paper on to an expert in the subject<br>matter so the the energy you know<br>correctly passed us to some of the<br>people of the Voyager Mission they will<br>know this stuff<br>and of course they take an exception to<br>being told that oh yeah but of course<br>your measurement is wrong<br>um and so they say look this doesn't<br>really work right so this referee says<br>you're saying our daughter is wrong by<br>more than three sigma rights three<br>standard deviations of of what they<br>claimed as their error so that that<br>doesn't<br>the case of Voyager 2<br>we our model is saying that their sign<br>is wrong<br>please<br>um so he actually said I don't recommend<br>published<br>you're claiming stuff that doesn't agree<br>with our measurement<br>uh the editor was good though so this is<br>in some sense this is a good peer review<br>uh<br>process<br>talk or<br>I don't know anecdote<br>um<br>you know you you're sort of ignoring<br>some bits of this data right where it<br>doesn't work<br>you know I have to agree with the<br>referee why why can you<br>how can you say that and uh this end<br>this editor I know I'm actually uh and<br>he says look even this is concerning<br>philosophically even though I myself and<br>the theoretician as well I I've<br>sympathized but you've got to do better<br>if you can convince me if you can put in<br>a stronger about us you can really<br>explain why this is wrong<br>then<br>so that that actually became<br>one week maybe two weeks of my life over<br>the summer really look at how are they<br>doing this how are they doing this<br>calibration because before you go and<br>publish something and say they're wrong<br>it'll be sure that that you know what<br>they've done right and that was hard<br>because there was actually no published<br>uh documentation they they had some<br>stuff online<br>poorly written it was some of the stuff<br>was clearly wrong you know so anyway I<br>had to sort of untangle a lot of this<br>stuff<br>um but the long and short of it is what<br>they try to do is they try to they know<br>that bz the Z direction of the magnetic<br>field is they can't calibrate on its own<br>so maybe they can use the X and Y<br>components to sort of get a hint what's<br>um and and the X and Y are good right<br>you can do that role you can get a<br>pretty good uh calibration for there<br>so their idea was this they said well<br>suppose you sort of have this this area<br>of space and you have some<br>Myas mothers ionized gases floating<br>through here there'll be some little<br>bumps and wiggles and things to be some<br>areas maybe where it's a bit more<br>compressed and then a little bit where<br>it maybe a bit more spread out and sort<br>of squished around a bit and if the<br>squishing occurs in a way that it's the<br>same from all Direction<br>right so that the squishing an X the<br>squishing of Y and the squishing and z<br>are all the same then we can look at the<br>level of squishing we see in X and Y and<br>just extend that to Z<br>it's the only thing you can do only<br>on yeah so<br>problem is<br>that might work if you had a completely<br>isolated system the point is this the<br>area of space is close to the heliopause<br>and there's all sorts of disturbances<br>hitting the Helio balls are passing<br>through so there's these sort of shock<br>waves and a shock wave is not a nice<br>circular thing that's coming in and out<br>isotropically<br>we would say in math it has a very<br>strong direction to it so like this<br>whole assumption<br>really shouldn't apply it here<br>and so we are able to argue that<br>in the editor was<br>you know happy enough for that that at<br>least we were clear what we did what we<br>you know and and so the paper was<br>published<br>so I don't<br>uh so in summary<br>uh so this is just sort of wreck going<br>back you know wrapping everything up so<br>models complement measurements allow for<br>forecasting right that's that's the sort<br>of<br>interplay between<br>mathematical models be any kind of oil<br>measurement and what you do with it<br>generally you want to be helpless<br>focused<br>uh<br>of course you shouldn't get too vested<br>in your model right in the end there is<br>a reality check which is your<br>measurement most of the time it's not<br>the model that proves the measurement<br>wrong it's the other way around and<br>um this you know that happens a lot so<br>you should be ready when and in some<br>ways in some ways you know our model of<br>the heliosphere<br>uh in some sense was proved wrong by the<br>fact that there's a ribbon there in this<br>Ibex dot so that tells you okay there's<br>something missing in your model go back<br>uh the less measurements you have the<br>more we can rely on a model and it's us<br>here I say you sort of you must rely<br>it also give you some leeway so<br>you know in in terms of weather<br>forecasts you've got lots and lots of<br>data and new model is very tightly<br>constrained if you're modeling you know<br>the interaction of two black holes<br>he got a lot of freedom because nobody<br>quite knows what's going on so<br>um<br>yeah less measurements sometimes better<br>for modelers right<br>uh all measurements require an<br>instrument some kind of way that you get<br>a number out of<br>late<br>and there's a lot of things that can go<br>wrong there right the instruments really<br>only work in a certain range of<br>parameters<br>all instruments have errors<br>the calibration right you need to kind<br>of understand<br>case of the footage<br>so<br>summary statement uh made immense<br>technical progress over the last 50<br>years of computing right tying it nicely<br>back to 50 years of computing<br>because that's allowed these computer<br>simulations it has allowed us to you<br>know write out this complicated model<br>and yet implement it get a<br>three-dimensional picture of things<br>with with high accuracy and high<br>resolution<br>and so models in some sense you know the<br>world is getting to the point where we<br>almost treat the model as similar status<br>as imagined so if you you know if you<br>think about uh in the old days a wind<br>tunnel was sort of the ground truth<br>Force figuring out aerodynamics<br>or airplanes or something<br>but now you can run a simulation of that<br>and<br>it's going to be almost as good<br>question<br>bye<br>so Sean did you did you know this that<br>they did this sort of compressive<br>they are assuming it's isotropic as well<br>clearly not what<br>what's going on out<br>so<br>using your your workload can you can<br>back out the an offsets or the magnetic<br>in the Z Direction all right so you<br>you're saying if you're actually going<br>it's<br>if you sort of assume that these green<br>lines are right<br>what does it tell you yeah that would be<br>I don't know it's it's also an<br>accumulation of error I think it's got<br>so they sort of said okay we we think<br>we've got it right now and we make a<br>small change fine right and then a month<br>later say oh yep obviously currently<br>we're when asked we write but we need to<br>make a change and so I don't know if<br>it's a It's actually an accumulation of<br>it because it does seem that way for<br>example here right where initially they<br>had you know the negative sign was<br>consistent with the model but now<br>they've got a positive side so that<br>realistic<br>so similar a more basic question isn't<br>that you said the the measurements in<br>some sense proves that the model is<br>correct or can be used yes yeah you know<br>you know if you if you could say all<br>right this is the instrument we need to<br>create and this is we need to measure to<br>prove that actually our green line is<br>right and the other thing is wrong with<br>that take you actually need to be<br>measuring to capture that<br>uh<br>in in principle<br>the same instrument can measure the<br>green line<br>the problem is we don't know like it is<br>it's still like a set of scales but it<br>but basically what's happened with the<br>whistling of world war out we don't know<br>how we had a way to know how that was<br>moving<br>then we could you know be sure that we<br>measuring the right thing and<br>you know I always have to be careful<br>because in the end<br>you know it's a model and model can also<br>it<br>it is absolutely possible that the<br>that can happen I think it's less likely<br>than the other way around but<br>and of course the problem here is that<br>this is took to get to avoids to get<br>there took about 40 years<br>now you can launch something a bit<br>faster<br>you can't<br>well with some very new technologies<br>that they're talking about you might be<br>able to cut that down to maybe 10<br>minutes<br>but that's technology that actually has<br>it's it's that it's a<br>just I treat really<br>so I thought we've got to do it I<br>started following up on Judy's question<br>um so one of the you've got these three<br>antennas for you I think you're talking<br>about like me and one in the direction<br>of the spacecraft's going if you didn't<br>Mount them like that so you're still<br>Mount them at bright angles to each<br>other but one none of the recording of<br>the direction of motion you'd be all<br>right I think so yeah I'm not sure why<br>they did it this way<br>um<br>I guess in the solar wind radial<br>direction is something special and that<br>really is on average zero so it makes<br>sense to do that because in the end this<br>was a mission to look at the planets<br>that was the goal and fingers crossed we<br>get to see the planets<br>you know now we're talking you know 20<br>30 years later and and now we'll say oh<br>why didn't you do this you know it's<br>it's sort of<br>um<br>yeah so you can certainly forgive them<br>for you know not having this much<br>foresight<br>yeah<br>yeah but you're right in principle if if<br>those those three angles were a little<br>bit different and then you did your role<br>you would actually get one of those<br>traces in all three<br>yes curiosity is there any way to now<br>that you know two possible anything<br>uh values is there any way to<br>use that knowledge that you have to<br>take some item engagement of some other<br>thing perhaps more easily reached from<br>Earth and then that will give you an<br>interest to which one of those two is<br>right since you don't need a specific<br>yes so what you're sort of saying is<br>that we've got we've got Ibex we've got<br>some magnetic fields of that we've got<br>Voyage we've got something to feel from<br>that if we had a third one and a degree<br>with one of those two that would lend a<br>lot more<br>Credence to that<br>like if you know something equals that<br>negative one or positive one you don't<br>rub it's exactly you just have to<br>revisit positive only<br>then is there some since you already<br>know specific values is there some scene<br>during you can do yeah which doesn't<br>give a specific value but it's which<br>uh I think short answers no<br>but<br>but yeah people are always looking for<br>these these sorts of things always<br>that's that's Ibex right Ibex is not<br>actually measuring that field right so<br>Ibex was sort of the second<br>way to to get a magnetic field<br>indirectly build a recording yeah yeah<br>exactly yeah without going all the way<br>out<br>so maybe there is another indirect way<br>that would be<br>well actually you know there are some<br>other things so people look at cosmic<br>rays so cosmic rays<br>um<br>this picture's all right so these are<br>high energy things that come from other<br>parts of the Galaxy stream through super<br>high speed but they are affected by<br>magnetic fields all charged particles to<br>do some curvature around make note feels<br>a little faster you go the bigger the<br>good of all of that<br>um but you can observe cosmic rays at<br>Earth and they have passed through that<br>magnetic field so<br>uh you can so so actually it it's<br>actually true that<br>that most of the cosmic ray<br>observations do agree with this sort of<br>configuration<br>rushly the field pointing in that<br>direction they can't pin it down so well<br>but<br>uh it is consistent with that whereas<br>what we're just seeing with voyager is<br>that it's saying the field is this way<br>and then that way which is not<br>what that is not so maybe yeah yeah so<br>there are other hints that the Ibex<br>directions will feel is<br>book<br>otherwise you can always ask me another<br>time</p></main><footer style="margin-top: 2rem; background: #0001; padding: 2rem; text-align: center;"><p>We Are The University</p><ul style="list-style-type: none; padding: 0; margin:
