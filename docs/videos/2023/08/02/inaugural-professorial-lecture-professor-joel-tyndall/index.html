greetings<br>to those loved ones that we may have<br>lost as a community or for any of you<br>individually may we remember you and may<br>to the professors in our in our official<br>party uh tinakoto<br>Professor hook<br>Prima gimmel and monk uh Koto and to our<br>special honored guest Professor Tyndall<br>to nagway<br>um<br>welcome to those visitors here to the<br>University of otago this evening to<br>those from Dunedin to those that have<br>come from other parts in the South<br>Island to those from the Four Winds and<br>my great welcome and greetings to you<br>all<br>and in particular we have some very<br>special guests in the audience<br>supporting Professor Tindall and online<br>we have your mum Jordan father Alan and<br>his wife die here sorry online you have<br>your brother Dean his wife Kelly<br>visiting from Melbourne so welcome um to<br>the warmth this is probably like a<br>normal Melbourne day for you right so I<br>get that uh uh to Trudy uh Lara and Sam<br>also welcome from the University<br>so I'm Professor Richard Blakey I'm<br>Deputy Vice Chancellor for research and<br>Enterprise and because our vice<br>Chancellor Professor Helen Nicholson is<br>away and gives her apologies I'm<br>actually acting Vice Chancellor at the<br>moment so I can be here officially uh to<br>to welcome you on behalf of the<br>university and just to give you a little<br>bit of an overview of what we're here to<br>celebrate through an inaugural<br>professorial lecture this is one of the<br>occasions that we do get our gowns on<br>and we do love as academic leaders in<br>the University because it gives us an<br>opportunity to celebrate promotion or<br>appointment to the highest academic rank<br>at University that of Professor this is<br>an aspirational rank that requires<br>exceptional performance and leadership<br>in all three domains of the role of an<br>academic in research in teaching and in<br>service and you'll hear from Professor<br>Hawk when she introduces Joel the kinds<br>of things that he has done to get that<br>service I won't steal her Thunder but I<br>just a couple of remarks that what makes<br>your achievements very remarkable Joel<br>is how you do balance those commitments<br>you are an excellent researcher who we<br>are very grateful that you've brought<br>significant amounts of research funding<br>into the University from a number of<br>sources from Blue Skies funds from the<br>health research Council and H MRC in<br>Australia but also from industry so your<br>your researchers is there to be applied<br>you're an outstanding and very popular<br>supervisor<br>having 21 phds under your supervision or<br>jointly supervised with other you're an<br>excellent teacher I note particularly<br>that you've taught into three of our<br>divisional programs into Health Sciences<br>into chemistry programs and even guest<br>lectures in drugs and the law I think it<br>was and I what I want to give<br>particularly in particular note for what<br>I want to particularly note as your<br>community service for us as an academic<br>Community often that is service on<br>editorial boards and committees and<br>other things and you do that at the<br>highest level but I also know that you<br>serve your family and the communities of<br>Dunedin very very well through surf life<br>saving and other things and it's a real<br>Hallmark of a of a career well spent<br>that you have balanced those commitments<br>to the things that are important to you<br>both inside and outside Academia so I'd<br>like to ask Professor hook to come and<br>give you a formal introduction before<br>you give your IPL but please accept on<br>behalf of the University our<br>wholehearted congratulations for your<br>well-deserved promotion thank you very<br>much<br>foreign<br>hook and I'm a colleague of professor<br>jindals at the School of Pharmacy and<br>it's my great pleasure and honor to<br>provide this introduction for Joel's<br>inaugural ignore girl professorial<br>Leisure and I've known Joel for many<br>years now since he started at the<br>University some 19 years ago<br>Joel is a medicinal chemist as I'm sure<br>you all know with expertise and Drug<br>delivery and Drug Discovery using<br>computational methods he is Australian<br>but we have almost forgiven him for that<br>since he has married a kiwi and both his<br>children are kiwis<br>Joel grew up in Melbourne and has a BSC<br>honors in chemistry from Monash<br>University<br>he then moved to the University of<br>Queensland Center for drug design and<br>development for his PhD which is also<br>where he met his his um at that stage<br>but has soon to be wife Trudy<br>his time in Queensland was obviously<br>very successful from both a personal and<br>professional standpoint<br>and when I've had scientific Works which<br>she's most proud of was based on work<br>carried out at that time<br>it was based on work looking at<br>understanding Alzheimer's disease<br>this is during his PhD and it was<br>published on the prestigious Journal of<br>biological chemistry it's been cited<br>over 980 times and is still cited today<br>in 2000 after finishing his PhD Joel<br>moved to work at The Institute of cell<br>and molecular biology at the University<br>of Edinburgh<br>he enjoyed life in the vibrant little<br>city and also managed to get two<br>Publications while making most of the<br>nightlife<br>it also possibly prepared him for the<br>change in temperature he could expect<br>when he came to Dunedin<br>however he could not stay away from the<br>University of Brisbane and more<br>importantly Trudy<br>who had remained there to complete her<br>PhD<br>and he returned to Brisbane in 2001 to<br>take up a position as an independent<br>researcher<br>it was also during this time that Joel<br>and Trudy married<br>I also carried out research together<br>with some of their research was based on<br>potent neurotoxins produced by snails<br>which happen to live in the waters<br>around the Great Barrier Reef<br>and as part of this research they went<br>on a week-long snorkeling trip to<br>collect samples doesn't sound like a<br>work to me and it wouldn't have been for<br>Joel who has a love of swimming and the<br>water<br>this has survived has moved from the<br>balmy Waters of Australia to The Frigid<br>Waters of Dunedin and the Southern Lakes<br>but apparently he does now require the<br>use of wetsuits<br>as Professor Blakey mentioned Joel is a<br>store water that's in clear life-saving<br>club and it's past this love of water<br>onto his daughter Lara while his son Sam<br>has inherited his skill with computers<br>in 2004 Joel talk about took up a<br>position as lecture and Medicinal<br>Chemistry here at otago in the School of<br>Pharmacy<br>his research here involves understanding<br>proteins as potential drug targets<br>a key feature of Joel's work is that he<br>is highly collaborative and is an<br>integral part of teams looking at this<br>area<br>and it does sort of show Joel's social<br>and people-focused nature that he has<br>been able to maintain these strong<br>collaborations and teams with groups<br>within and outside the university for<br>long periods of time<br>so Professor Tyndall has been an<br>integral part of multi-disciplinary<br>teams investigating the biological basis<br>of disease and developing new drugs<br>which I'm sure he would tell us about<br>tonight<br>This research has resulted in Joel being<br>a named investigator and grants totally<br>more than 16 million dollars and more<br>than 100 Publications an international<br>peer reviewed journals<br>he has gained an international<br>reputation in his field of computational<br>modeling which has resulted in being<br>recently asked to write an expert review<br>on a new covert drug and the prestigious<br>Journal of Medicinal Chemistry<br>the highlight of his research career so<br>far is his contribution to a team<br>identifying a mechanism of resistance in<br>a class of antifungal drugs<br>Joel's collaborative approach to life<br>also extends to his leisure activities<br>he has also for the last 10 years<br>competed in triathlons<br>but sensibly does not do the whole thing<br>himself instead he completes a swimming<br>leg which is his area of expertise and<br>lets his teammates Dave and Danny do the<br>rest<br>he has also recently taken up Waka armor<br>paddling paddling<br>however Joel's sporting Endeavors did<br>take a pause last year when after one<br>too many last runs down the ski field he<br>ended up in Dunedin Hospital with a<br>broken tibia in febia time does catch up<br>with us all Joel<br>Joel is a dedicated teacher and he has<br>earned the respect of both undergraduate<br>and postgraduate students his PhD<br>students have gone on to positions in<br>industry and Academia with the recent<br>graduate Jasmine Wang recently becoming<br>a chief scientific officer in a biotech<br>startup based on the start that Joel<br>gave her<br>Joel has close industry links and has<br>carried out contract research and acted<br>as a consultant for a number of<br>australasian companies<br>the third key role of an academic is<br>service and it's perhaps one we don't<br>talk about enough<br>but it's where Joel has shown<br>particularly strong and sustained<br>leadership<br>firstly taking on the role of associate<br>dean of marketing communication<br>engagement at the School of Pharmacy<br>and then taking on the role of associate<br>Dean International for both the School<br>of Pharmacy and the division of Health<br>Sciences<br>this is a key role for the school and<br>the university promoting our courses and<br>our research internationally<br>this role requires someone with<br>excellent communication skills and<br>interpersonal skills and a great deal of<br>patience<br>it does also at times require a lot of<br>traveling<br>and we've been very pleased that Joel's<br>family has put up with the time he's had<br>to spend away from home<br>Jola strengthened relationships with<br>universities with strong health science<br>programs and the Asia Pacific area and<br>the university and in particular School<br>of Pharmacy has benefited hugely from<br>linkages he has made<br>right so I think that's now time for me<br>to finish and move on to the main event<br>I am personally very excited to hear<br>about Joel's achievements in the area<br>and I would like to welcome Professor<br>Tyndall to the podium to talk to us<br>about looking at molecules and what they<br>thank you very much Sarah for that<br>introduction<br>um I can tell you now it feels a bit<br>different being in the spotlight rather<br>than just coming to watch<br>um people say enjoy this so let's have<br>some fun<br>so my name is Joel Tindall as you can<br>see<br>um<br>I do I did originally come from the<br>Lesser known West Island as you can see<br>up there from a small place called<br>Melbourne<br>over there<br>I grew up in Melbourne<br>trying to identify photos as people that<br>I want to put up in these types of<br>lectures of my primary school was quite<br>difficult because they're all quite<br>modern so the nearest thing to that was<br>the lobster cave which was the 70s icon<br>growing up in the 70s around there<br>there's a few in the audience who'll<br>understand the uh the amusement there so<br>growing up just down the road from the<br>lobster cave going to Primary School<br>pretty much behind the lobster cave in<br>beaumaris Primary School<br>didn't have to go far to go to secondary<br>school went to Mentone grammar<br>uh there a boys school which rightly or<br>wrongly set me on the path that I'm that<br>I have ended up here<br>um now it's a co-ed School whether or<br>not I was able to talk to girls at that<br>I didn't even go far for University I<br>turned around and decided that well<br>we'll go to Clayton Monash University in<br>Clayton there's nothing wrong with that<br>it's a very good University and set me<br>off well<br>as has already been mentioned<br>um I like water<br>this was where I grew up this is at<br>Ricketts point<br>so growing up we had the luxury of<br>watching the sunset go down over the<br>water<br>so I embarked on my University career<br>in a bachelor of economics<br>that seemed uh something that would that<br>would challenge me at the time<br>little a little known fact about me in<br>fifth form we only had six forms in<br>Melbourne in fifth form I did law and<br>managed to do very well in that that<br>paper only to drop it and make sixth<br>form but I thought that was possibly a<br>life told me otherwise and after two<br>years of doing economics it was decided<br>not to continue with that or shall we<br>say someone else decided that I<br>shouldn't continue with that<br>we managed to get back into applied<br>science at a lesser-known institution<br>Caulfield Institute of Technology it was<br>a very relatively prestigious University<br>and it's sorry Institute in its day<br>but as you can see down here the<br>architecture or the more modern<br>architecture wasn't as attractive as can<br>be<br>I do remember it does have some<br>appropriately attractive architecture<br>from around the 40s and 30s to 50s I<br>won't look at my brother to confirm<br>which year it was I don't actually<br>remember ever going into that building<br>however<br>ironically having Monash asked me to um<br>think about my career in a different<br>manner in 1990 I believe Monash took<br>over corporate Institute of Technology<br>so I was back at this institution I did<br>start in the Robert Menzies building<br>with economics but I moved to the um the<br>smaller science Wing to start my<br>Bachelor of Science or continue my<br>Bachelor of Science<br>I guess ironically given that it's<br>Medicinal Chemistry which has a lot of<br>biology involved with the science<br>I managed to get a conceited pass in<br>first year biology whereby I'd pass but<br>they wouldn't let me do it again<br>I also decided that I probably wouldn't<br>need computer science either ending up<br>as a computational chemist<br>nonetheless in second year I went on to<br>do some chemistry and some mathematics<br>papers and pushed it into third year<br>into chemistry realizing that as I put<br>it to myself and to others when they<br>asked<br>I continued with chemistry because it<br>didn't annoy me and then it realized<br>that I could actually do it<br>so I completed my Bachelor of Science<br>and in third year this is probably the<br>Catalyst<br>um one of the professors there Patrick<br>permutter who was professor in organic<br>chemistry<br>had a an assignment associated with<br>these silicon Graphics computers which<br>around 93 94 were worth to purchase I<br>think about 10 000 US dollars<br>and what we were in tasked to do was to<br>Simply visualize the protein and ligand<br>complex something similar to what's on<br>the far left<br>and identify exactly what the<br>interactions were<br>so the ligand protein interactions<br>and these computers also were used in<br>the development of the Terminator 2<br>movie so they were pretty Flash<br>pretty expensive and I do have a prop<br>Steve it's off<br>um you can pretty much do the<br>visualization of those proteins on a<br>but these were fairly impressive pieces<br>of tech<br>so I completed my Bachelor of Science at<br>the University<br>as students who want to do mod is still<br>available now which I think is a great<br>opportunity is summer student Zips some<br>studentships so having finished my<br>bachelor's degree I went for a summer<br>studentship with ICI which I had to<br>remember first of all what the acronym<br>was and then I had to look up what that<br>meant<br>and<br>Imperial chemical Industries I believe<br>which was then taken over by Orica<br>and that was effectively making deter<br>Brown detergents not Brown<br>so that didn't quite excite me so I<br>continued on with my honors degree<br>we didn't have the opportunity to look<br>at any molecular visualization or<br>protein stuff at least in the chemistry<br>Department<br>as an honors project so this was<br>probably my first Introduction to<br>Medicinal Chemistry or biological type<br>chemistry chemistry associated with<br>drugs whereby the title and I wondered<br>why I carried this round for most of my<br>life but I think I've just worked it out<br>I can probably get rid of it now as my<br>honors thesis it's entitled synthesis<br>and anti-cancer activity of platinum 2<br>organoamides so that is the technical<br>term for derivatives of cisplatinum<br>cancer anti-cancer drugs<br>and this was when this was with<br>Professor Glenn Deacon here and this is<br>a photo taken from somewhere in the web<br>when he when the lab was delivered one<br>of the first<br>dry glove boxes now this box is used for<br>chemistry which is oxygen sensitive so<br>they can put an argon or nitrogen<br>environment and I believe it took 15<br>minutes to purge possibly each time at<br>that stage and this was a number of<br>those by the time I got into the lab at<br>that stage<br>Professor deakin was an expert on<br>lanthanide chemistry and if people can<br>are able to picture the periodic table<br>which I know fairly well the list down<br>the bottom is lanthanide chemistry<br>Glenn Deacon was an expert in lanthanide<br>chemistry I avoided that thankfully and<br>went into into some Platinum stuff<br>at the end of honors<br>based on Patrick's<br>suggestion I went up to Queensland to<br>the Center for drug design and<br>development on a summer studentship<br>whereby I sat and mused with a lot of<br>visualization molecules in particular<br>looking at anti-cancer drugs and how<br>they interact with DNA and that's their<br>their known mechanism of action<br>I also made some peptides<br>that's about all I can remember doing<br>apart from probably going to see a few<br>bands and probably partying a few other<br>areas too<br>and I came back to Monash to start my<br>PhD<br>but it wasn't long after that I realized<br>that doing a PhD in Platinum any cancer<br>drugs wasn't quite what I wanted to do<br>so I actually stopped my PhD at Monash<br>around the same time that one of the pis<br>up in Brisbane<br>um David Fairley rang me up and said why<br>so I moved up to University of<br>Queensland to start a PhD up there<br>and whilst it says<br>18 hours I think it took me a week<br>because I stopped off to see some<br>colleagues on the way also<br>and also as I was<br>one goes through a lot of<br>self-reflection in these times preparing<br>these lectures and looking at that there<br>wasn't much internet or Maps so I'm<br>trying to work out how I actually got<br>from Melbourne<br>to Brisbane to the actual specific<br>places that I needed to go without<br>Google Maps<br>and not having a large book of other<br>Maps<br>so that was my journey to start my PhD<br>or start again my PhD<br>and this is where I continued<br>so there was involved some synthesis<br>and we'd set out to make the smallest<br>and what I'd found in trying to convince<br>my supervisor that I couldn't purify<br>this gel because I'd made this<br>tetrapeptide four amino acids<br>it was hard it's like well can you try<br>something else<br>little did we realize that peptides<br>forming gels could be useful in other<br>areas so that was probably the last time<br>I was in the in the lab doing synthesis<br>I then went on to do some other<br>investigations particularly around<br>Alzheimer's disease<br>looking at how metal ions interact with<br>Alzheimer's with the specific peptide<br>which is shown over here better amyloid<br>peptide because it's understood to<br>create reactive oxygen species<br>I did some overnight experiments<br>numerous late nights at a center for<br>magnetic resonance I think it was called<br>using<br>epr which I've actually just forgotten<br>what it means and I don't really<br>understand what that means but we've<br>managed to work out some things with<br>Alzheimer's disease needless to say<br>that's still a big challenge these days<br>part of my research also was to look at<br>a large class of enzymes called<br>proteases now these proteases are the<br>enzymes that chop up other proteins<br>they're four percent of the human genome<br>and it's the largest enzyme family in<br>vertebrates and we know that they exist<br>in other organisms as well not just<br>vertebrates<br>so I did a large analysis of what binds<br>to proteases<br>and basically what I'm going to talk<br>about is a lot of my research which<br>basically is broken down to squiggles<br>and lines<br>easy to simplify it<br>specifically we did look at some<br>structural aspects of antiretroviral<br>drug leads looking at HIV protease<br>as well as molecules interacting with<br>Target proteins associated with<br>inflammation<br>so some of the finer details so this was<br>the paper that Professor hook alluded to<br>Copper potentiation of Alzheimer's<br>disease or sorry Alzheimer's better<br>amyloid neurotoxicity<br>I'm very I am very proud of that<br>significant paper it is literally an<br>Australian football team on the author<br>list I'm fifth out of 20. that includes<br>so I then moved away from the<br>Alzheimer's peptide still retaining the<br>knowledge for some of the teaching that<br>I've done in the past<br>20 years it sounds like a long time<br>looking at these proteases these<br>proteolytic enzymes<br>and trying to work out<br>if there is some something similar that<br>they all do that we can use that<br>knowledge with respect to developing<br>drugs<br>that may Target these types of enzymes<br>and as I said here is the line with the<br>squiggle and the line of what we've been<br>specifically<br>HIV protease was one of the key things<br>that we looked at<br>um<br>as an aside I try and mess with people's<br>heads by having these things spinning<br>and hopefully they they may feel a bit<br>weird but now that I stand up here and<br>look at that I'm feeling a bit weird<br>and so<br>so that's a relatively simplified and<br>sort of glorified pretty picture of what<br>we were doing so HIV protease is<br>was well known at the time it was at the<br>Forefront of disease and drugs also<br>but we were able to look at<br>understanding how<br>the general class of proteins recognize<br>those ligands and also how we can<br>constrain into that Motif so the line<br>such that it retains that<br>was around the same time that um a<br>flatmate of mine who was also doing his<br>PhD Michael Kelso suggests that we go<br>swimming in the off season the off<br>season being winter because he was a<br>surfer and he needed to keep fit for<br>surfing<br>um<br>and being able to swim an Olympic-sized<br>pool in the open is a fantastic<br>experience even if it is only slightly<br>heated in winter<br>so I finished my PhD and managed to<br>organize a fellowship in a postdoc in<br>Edinburgh there are a number of<br>opportunities other opportunities there<br>but Edinburgh was where I decided that<br>we'd go or that I'd go and as Sarah<br>mentioned Trudy remained in Brisbane at<br>the time to finish her PhD<br>so it wasn't a rush post-op but it was a<br>so<br>as a scientist I guess we are recognized<br>by signposts such as<br>Publications so yeah there was two<br>Publications that came out of my time<br>there<br>but there was a lot more a lot more<br>science that I that I got involved in so<br>the supervisor<br>um up there Malcolm walkenshaw used to<br>work in a pharmaceutical company Sandos<br>in Europe he also wrote his own software<br>as well so it was great to learn<br>new aspects and new theories from him<br>around that type of technology and also<br>the developing technology of<br>High throughput screening using<br>computational methods rather than going<br>and purchasing large amounts of<br>compounds to then screen physically in<br>the lab<br>you can do this computationally such<br>that you don't have to buy ten thousand<br>you can maybe buy 100 of those<br>with some more certainty that you might<br>get something that's going to work<br>so whilst we have the signposts of um of<br>our Publications<br>I gained a lot more out of Edinburgh<br>and a lot of people do also put pictures<br>of themselves and things like that I<br>don't have that many or I either that or<br>I chose not to go and get them<br>but at least I did find this is my flat<br>was probably about here<br>on Marchman Road in Edinburgh and you<br>could actually look up out of one of the<br>windows it was the Box room which are<br>the smallest rooms in Britain you could<br>fit a single bed and not much else in<br>there if you looked out that window you<br>could actually see Edinburgh Castle<br>so I was coming towards the end of my<br>postdoc and<br>not quite really getting the whole idea<br>of applying for jobs I emailed my super<br>my PhD supervisor and said can I have<br>one<br>and thankfully he said sure<br>so I came all the way back to Brisbane<br>um<br>as Google said it takes a day probably<br>took a bit longer than that I do<br>remember catching up with a very good<br>friend in Prague for a week before we<br>so this was David Fairley my PhD<br>supervisor<br>who who helped me a lot<br>and these two papers were looking were<br>helping an honest student that I was<br>given co-supervision of at the time<br>again we're looking at the proteases so<br>these proteins exist through us and<br>they're quite common in viruses as well<br>as we've mentioned so these two papers<br>here talk about West Nile Virus which is<br>still a problem along with Dengue fever<br>in the tropics in particular<br>so at that time<br>Crystal structures so by the nature of<br>that you take a molecule a particular<br>protein<br>crystallize it and that gives it order<br>such that you can then determine what<br>the protein looks like<br>there wasn't<br>is it 100 000 that's one run with 100<br>there wasn't 100 000 Crystal structures<br>available as there is is today<br>but there was a select few from a number<br>of different<br>species or compartments that were very<br>similar to other things<br>so I can say that<br>Dengue fever or the virus associated<br>with dengue fever<br>is a very similar virus to West Nile<br>they're in the same class<br>so we were able to build models of these<br>proteins based on similar proteins that<br>we've known the structure of<br>we're able to actually dock in the<br>substrate<br>such that we can then understand how the<br>protein Works to take it to the next<br>step to develop molecules that are going<br>to block<br>the the processing<br>or the action of this enzyme in the<br>so the context of homology with<br>homologous meaning the same<br>we've got a common structure within<br>classes<br>I was also beginning to understand that<br>genetic makeup of viruses is similar<br>was I understanding then I'm not<br>actually sure I wrote this this week<br>obviously so now I understand that<br>so this was I guess my second postdoc<br>back in Brisbane and this was a very<br>important collaboration that had<br>developed over time with this very good<br>scientist here Dr Trudy Mill<br>whereby we're looking at um well Trudy<br>was looking at cone snails and these<br>things<br>look friendly and look pleasant but they<br>they hunt they don't hunt people they<br>hunt fish they hunt snails and you can<br>get very sick and people can die from<br>the from this um from the Venom from<br>these snails<br>and I was very lucky to go to I<br>forgotten the name of the island but<br>we'll get to that a little bit later but<br>it's just I've glanced in the Great<br>Barrier Reef<br>um I was taken on that cone snower<br>collecting trip as catering officer we<br>did actually have a film crew who wanted<br>to do a documentary also<br>so that was a bit of fun and they took<br>us out to some of the outer reefs um<br>all for scientific purposes of course<br>but nonetheless so this is all Trudy's<br>work but I was involved in generating<br>models of trying to understand what<br>these enzymes did<br>this particular protein exists in a lot<br>of different venoms<br>again homologous stuff but this type<br>there is also a class of proteins the<br>human crisps which is associated with<br>fertility and human sperm from memory so<br>lots of similarities<br>so I maintained that collaboration and<br>so these two papers<br>um<br>I have always had at the Forefront of my<br>mind with respect to what I look at and<br>what I go back to and what I do<br>so from one of the better term like<br>the journal that they came out in was<br>chemical reviews<br>it wasn't simply a review it was more of<br>a meta-analysis so I did this as part of<br>my PhD and continued on but looking at<br>these proteases at that time I looked at<br>every single crystal structure of<br>proteases to identify what they<br>recognized and how they recognized<br>and they recognized molecules in this<br>line format<br>we also looked another<br>very separate class of proteins<br>G protein coupled receptors<br>so I mentioned that proteases make up<br>about four percent of the human genome I<br>think these receptors make up about the<br>same but significantly<br>they make up about 30 to 35 percent of<br>all drugs available on the market things<br>like antihistamines<br>asthma drugs salbutamol<br>I won't go into that there is lots of<br>so taking that forward<br>moving into some of the extra work that<br>I was doing it's been mentioned that I<br>collaborate so my work is very<br>collaborative<br>so we looked at cyclic peptides<br>specifically this was looking at cyclic<br>peptides forming specific shapes so we<br>were trying to actually make a molecular<br>cylinder or a trough that would carry<br>something<br>we looked at molecules that would<br>interact with c5a which is a another G<br>protein carbon receptor associated with<br>inflammation<br>associated with the recognition<br>of molecules<br>we're looking at how we can constrain<br>those molecules to adopt a specific<br>shape<br>again looking at those cone snails that<br>kill you<br>further gpcr stuff<br>looking at molecules around<br>um<br>adrenaline<br>so<br>the title of my talk was looking at<br>molecules<br>and that's what I spend a lot of time<br>doing or at least I did these days we<br>get into other areas of teaching and<br>things like that in admin but I still<br>find myself going back to it and looking<br>at things<br>I did want to call myself a TV chemist<br>but a very close friend of mine coined<br>that term so I can't use that but<br>looking at molecules is basically what<br>this involves<br>in a very collaborative fashion<br>this was roughly around the time that I<br>came to Dunedin with Trudy and probably<br>around the time that I bought my first<br>wetsuit at least long wetsuit because<br>so I want to talk about some of the<br>research that I've been doing<br>particularly here and still doing at the<br>moment<br>what you can see here is a video that I<br>did not make<br>and this represents 50 of the most<br>and I'm going to stop that again because<br>I'm going to get dizzy<br>and what that's supposed to show is the<br>complexity of the cell or a cell<br>as a chemist I look at one of them at a<br>time<br>biologists and colleagues look at<br>multiple things and Pathways and they<br>can all work that out in the heads and I<br>I struggle to look at one followed by<br>the next one followed by the next one I<br>but specifically just a little bit of<br>background we know that microbes lead to<br>infectious diseases there's bacteria<br>there's fungi there's viruses<br>and they mutate<br>they change and that's how we get drug<br>resistance<br>I don't I probably don't need to um<br>Advocate how bad this can be but we know<br>it's a significant problem<br>and of course the best scientists<br>haven't been able to save their<br>PowerPoint presentation because I did<br>actually add in a picture of the<br>coronavirus but obviously it didn't save<br>so that's just to emphasize the fact<br>that we're well aware of what goes on<br>with respect to resistance and different<br>variants<br>Etc<br>so<br>I've kind of lost track of that time<br>not that time I believe I was in Dunedin<br>at the time but a very good colleague of<br>mine Willa Houston who was at the time<br>in Brisbane contacted me and said<br>I wonder if you'd be able to help me<br>with some work that she's been doing on<br>chlamydia now she's a very good<br>microbiologist and was looking at the<br>organism itself specifically around the<br>disease but also because it affects<br>koalas<br>now chlamydia I'm sure we're aware is a<br>sexually transmitted disease it's the<br>most prevalent bacterial bacterially<br>sexually transmitted disease it is<br>treatable<br>however it's often asymptomatic<br>so that leads us to potential long-term<br>health problems such as pelvic<br>inflammatory disease infertility<br>sterility<br>so they're not not good<br>so I thought this is going to be a<br>decent project<br>and I've talked about homology and<br>proteins looking the same<br>so this was all about this specific<br>and it's a protease surprisingly enough<br>so it recognizing something in an<br>extended or string or line conformation<br>and most proteases are similar right<br>so this is another protease this is the<br>common protease that we have in our in<br>and if you follow that top Arrow there<br>it matches that<br>so these are this should be easy right<br>we're just dealing with another enzyme<br>that I've looked at before<br>I think I'm going to say this again but<br>it wasn't that easy<br>because there's our classic fold or<br>protein structure<br>but on the left is a blue one as well so<br>it's got an extra domain not only does<br>it have that those purple things<br>activate it it turns that on<br>technically those two purple things<br>should be connected so that's one big<br>long thing which we don't know exactly<br>how it fits<br>it also hangs out in threes together<br>there's a nice symmetry there<br>it also hangs out in sixes<br>a hexima and it's inactivated<br>so we're dealing with activated and<br>inactivated forms<br>how is it inactivated so the white<br>unit reaches across this space<br>and blocks another active site where all<br>the chemistry happens in the enzymes<br>so what we needed to do from modeling<br>noting that the chlamydia enzyme is not<br>available<br>as a crystal structure so we had to<br>model these things<br>in order to do that we wanted to be able<br>to put our natural<br>binding substrate the peptide that this<br>protein actually Cleaves Into The<br>Binding site but you can see that this<br>orange bit<br>is in the wrong place or I can explain<br>that it is in the wrong place because<br>so this is what we're dealing with<br>A protein that moves between inactivated<br>so finally we were actually able to get<br>something to look at<br>as a molecule to be able to take it to<br>the next step of Designing molecules<br>to have something that's going to<br>it also acts out hangs out in 20 formers<br>so there's 24 single units of that same<br>protein that acts as a chaperone as well<br>so we had to put that aside because that<br>was someone else's scientific research<br>so<br>this has been a very successful<br>collaboration with wheeler Houston<br>and ongoing with close collaborators in<br>Dunedin also<br>so one of the key papers was the<br>identification of an inhibitor which<br>Willa identified specifically when she<br>went to Matt bogier's lab in Stanford<br>now I like to hope that I've been able<br>to put people together and um help<br>people out whereby if someone says do<br>you know someone who makes this type of<br>thing I can do that<br>in this case I gave Matt a call out at a<br>conference as I was speaking up speaking<br>like this and Matt had already given a<br>talk and I said Matt we'd like to talk<br>to you about this and sure enough Willa<br>went over there and identified some<br>molecules I believe that's actually very<br>close to it there<br>so that was managed to<br>um<br>be lethal to chlamydia<br>which was very positive now I'm still<br>fascinated by science what this picture<br>is up here is these are chlamydia cells<br>and chlamydia only exists within other<br>cells<br>so this is these green dots are<br>as I think mentioned earlier<br>also aspects with chlamydia infections<br>in koalas and that's they are threatened<br>so a good friend of mine at one stage<br>said rather than<br>getting outside Outsourcing people to<br>make these peptides for you why don't<br>you do it yourself<br>so we did I went and had a chat with a<br>good colleague Alan Gamble and he agreed<br>that we could get some students to make<br>some of these molecules and our first<br>one was deji probably the best dressed<br>PhD student I've seen he would walk<br>around the corridors wearing a suit<br>that's him casually submitting his PhD<br>he did put a tie on that day but the<br>suits were fantastic<br>so he did some very good work<br>um<br>it's times like this where you where you<br>need to acknowledge people where only<br>one line can acknowledge three and a<br>half years of their work but he did some<br>great work<br>the next PhD student who did honors and<br>they overlapped was Jasmine Huang who is<br>currently in the States but she had a<br>number of papers who did some more<br>analogues of these compounds<br>and when Jasmine was starting her PhD<br>she said I'd like to do some formulation<br>as well and Alan and I looked at each<br>other and said sure but we don't know<br>really how to supervise that so we<br>reached out to another colleague Dr Alan<br>McDowell who agreed to help out<br>and this was over covert as well so<br>Jasmine was going to travel to Sydney to<br>work with Willa to test some of her<br>compounds and her formulations as metal<br>particles to see whether or not we could<br>get better delivery of these drug<br>molecules into the cells<br>she couldn't go there so<br>I probably incorrectly determined that<br>helicobacter pylori a bacteria that's<br>related to stomach cancer is also an<br>intracellular bacteria<br>putting my naive into not putting my<br>naivety aside it worked<br>so we managed to get another paper<br>targeting helica back to pylori and I<br>guess for wanting a better term as<br>funding has not been that favorable with<br>chlamydia We are continuing on down the<br>anti-cancer bacterial side looking at<br>helica back to pylori with these types<br>so I've just thrown this up more of a<br>interlude between<br>um shall we say microbial infections and<br>this is probably<br>two or three years ago maybe more I<br>probably owned four wetsuits four<br>wetsuits at this stage it did go up to<br>so another very strong collaboration<br>I've had with my colleague Brian monk<br>down here who's been the Principal<br>investigator on these projects<br>um<br>and this is where I've been looking at<br>the molecules again<br>so just a bit of background so we're all<br>familiar with fungal infections in our<br>toes toenails Etc but there can be a<br>significant threat and can be fatal and<br>immunocompromised patients<br>so you know it's that's not a good thing<br>I've also mentioned that resistance<br>to known drugs is common<br>the specific molecule that these things<br>Target isn't is a cytochrome p450 enzyme<br>It's associated with<br>um these sterol type molecules so this<br>is the actual molecule which is the<br>fungal equivalent of cholesterol<br>so we know that cholesterol can be bad<br>but cholesterol is vital in our cells as<br>part of the cell membrane<br>so interfering with the cell membrane of<br>a small of a an organism can help to<br>kill it so that's why the Azel<br>antifungals are successful<br>so Brian's lab and once again<br>so I will point out that this is<br>probably the second time since 19 since<br>2000 that I was in the lab and most<br>scientists in the room will know that if<br>you see someone that's a pi in the lab<br>with a lab coat they're not doing any<br>science it's just a photo opportunity<br>it's I can confirm that that is me and<br>my hair wasn't dyed it's just lost its<br>um so scientists from particularly Brian<br>use sacromises serovicier which is<br>commonly Bakers or Bruins yeast as a<br>tool to look at model fungi or and look<br>at specific proteins in this case we're<br>so we were looking at this protein and<br>this is a resultant crystal structure<br>that came out of the lab<br>but early models based around other<br>species such as microbacterium<br>tuberculosis which was available<br>and the human enzyme<br>didn't paint the full picture so I put<br>forward that things are homologous<br>similar but they're not always the same<br>the very first structures of these of<br>this protein show that this protein<br>showed a membrane anchor and that's<br>quite significant<br>in that field we won't go into that<br>but what I want to get into<br>um<br>is what we identified<br>as respect with respect to the<br>resistance mechanism how are these bugs<br>resistant<br>so the cytochrome enzymes always<br>involved a heme group<br>similar to our hemoglobin whereby we<br>have an iron atom and other ligands bind<br>to that atom<br>back from my inorganic chemistry days<br>you can see that the crystals that Brian<br>grew are a nice red color so that's from<br>the iron in there<br>and that's because this triazole<br>actually binds to the ion atom in the<br>crystal structure<br>and what we're able to do is identify<br>exactly how these molecules bind<br>but also the rolls of water molecules<br>so we're coming back to that water thing<br>I like water I like to hang around water<br>with these Crystal structures we're able<br>to identify what's going on with these<br>water molecules and this just shows you<br>types of networks and interactions that<br>occur<br>in that<br>so this was another picture which I'd<br>so this is just a representation of the<br>type of data that we use<br>whereby this green area indicates there<br>should be something there we've added<br>that in the experiment<br>and more realistically this is the<br>actual software that we use to show us<br>that whereby we would build in a<br>drug-like molecule around here<br>and also add in specific water molecules<br>that are conserved highly<br>all this data is generally collected at<br>the Australian synchrotron in Melbourne<br>which is a quite a large facility you<br>can see by the two gentlemen down here<br>so let's get to the Crux of it so a lot<br>of this work was done by a very talented<br>PhD student who had very good hands in<br>the lab Alia sagatova<br>um<br>the group has determined structures of<br>the model drug Target so that's the<br>baker's yeast enzyme with with at least<br>six known drugs putative substrate<br>complexes seven agricultural or<br>agrochemicals so we use these chemicals<br>against fungus against<br>crops numerous structures with known<br>clinical relevant mutations and we'll<br>talk about that briefly in a moment<br>along with known drugs and new drug<br>leads<br>also we've looked at we've determined<br>two structures from fungal pathogens<br>so the yeast that saccharomyces the<br>Bakers and brewers yeast it's a model<br>system we actually want to know what<br>happens with the infectious<br>fungi<br>so this probably doesn't mean much to<br>half the people here<br>but this is a mutation whereby the amino<br>acid randomly changes but because the<br>drugs are no longer effective against<br>that strain that strain then becomes<br>more prominent and can grow<br>and what we were able to do is we<br>determine the crystal structure of the<br>Native enzyme and basically I want you<br>to just see that red<br>dot there<br>in the mutant we don't have that red dot<br>there<br>so what we determined was<br>with that mutation we lost hydrogen<br>bonding Network and the way I described<br>that is if you've got three people<br>trying to get across a river you hold<br>hands and that's much safer<br>it's a small River but just work with me<br>if someone doesn't hold hands You've<br>Lost That interaction<br>so there's not anywhere near as the<br>strength of what it could be so that's<br>what happens when this particular<br>mutation occurs<br>and this mutation is present in many<br>fungal species including the<br>agricultural ones that we've looked at<br>and that's related to these short chain<br>azoles such as fluconazole and<br>voraconazole which you may or may not<br>have heard of I'm sure you've used them<br>compared with etraconazole so this one<br>relies on that hydrogen bond this one<br>doesn't need it<br>so this thought we don't get resistance<br>so just some of those papers that were<br>put forward again Alia has done a lot of<br>this work there's a few more students in<br>there as well Brian thank you very much<br>for that collaboration it's been very<br>fruitful also Mikhail there<br>just also to point out the homology of<br>how similar things are in nature so<br>these are three different species of<br>fungi and to all intents and purposes it<br>looks the same<br>when you drill down to specific loops<br>and amino acids you can see differences<br>so I'll quickly go through the next few<br>projects or projects I think there's<br>only two<br>just bear with me<br>um<br>so Mark Hampton<br>in the top right up here contacted me I<br>was probably around 2008.<br>I said would you be interested in<br>helping out with some modeling about<br>these compounds these compounds<br>identified in cruciferous vegetables<br>such as broccoli cabbage all those good<br>vegetables that we love to eat<br>and they have anti-cancer and<br>anti-inflammatory activity<br>so they identified the main protein<br>Target which was macrophage migration<br>inhibitory Factor such a big name that's<br>why we call it myth<br>and this was the modeling that I did in<br>the key Point here is I wanted to put<br>forward that we also did the crystal<br>structure and lo and behold and<br>thankfully I was right<br>mostly<br>so that was always<br>um it's always good to know those things<br>come out correctly in the in the end<br>we've continued on with that project<br>with a number of<br>um another publication with a number of<br>molecules that we looked at<br>now you remember the story with the<br>chlamydia enzyme where it wasn't<br>straightforward well welcome to another<br>story where it wasn't so straightforward<br>probably difficult to discern the<br>difference between the yellow and the<br>orange portions down here needless to<br>say that they bind differently in the<br>same crystal which is<br>unusual<br>interesting from a scientific point of<br>view but frustrating and annoying<br>um<br>so that added another level of<br>complexity of understanding this system<br>I have another PhD student lohitha who<br>has recently finished and if she's in<br>the audience or listening at home that<br>is next on my list to get that<br>manuscript out<br>I'm also acknowledging Rob Smith and<br>sigured Wilbanks who've been very<br>so I mentioned my swimming partner a<br>while ago Michael Kelso who's now a<br>pre-clinical trial expert in a biotech<br>company looking at oncology drugs in<br>Sydney<br>um<br>yeah at one stage we got involved in<br>looking at this type of molecule so this<br>is amelioride this is a drug that's<br>available on the market and it's used<br>for hypertension and heart failure<br>and the contact concept of drug<br>repurposing Is Not Unusual in the<br>scientific field because if you have a<br>drug that's already been through<br>clinical trials and you can make it work<br>in another area you don't have to go<br>through clinical trials we know that<br>so this diuretic had possible<br>anti-cancer leads<br>was a possible anti-cancer lead<br>and with Michael we went on to publish<br>this article look in a number of<br>different analogues as Inhibitors of<br>this remarkably protease and this is the<br>same structure as the previous ones so<br>so these are probably two of the<br>smartest people that I know Mike Kelso<br>and Greg Cook and at one stage a few<br>years ago Greg Cook said to me do you<br>know anyone who makes any amelioride<br>analogues I said here's something we<br>prepared earlier<br>and sure enough after a number of years<br>of research and testing I've published<br>an article targeting microbacterium<br>tuberculosis<br>so these types of derivatives the right<br>hand side of this molecule is the same<br>as this<br>and it's another manuscript under review<br>whereby they are active against<br>tuberculosis again significant<br>resistance in this<br>um with this bacterium mycobacterium as<br>so I was going to put up all of the<br>structures that I've either published<br>worked on or been involved with<br>technically I have<br>this one down here is a number of<br>structures also but there's 57 different<br>protein structures that I've been<br>involved in I didn't put the last half<br>of one up there which is still on my<br>desk which I've got to get to in a<br>couple of weeks<br>just to finish off<br>a lot of those are the<br>the yeast enzyme but there's HIV there's<br>another different Target there a few<br>myth enzymes one of the good things I<br>saw in a lecture the other week is you<br>can't publish these types of structures<br>currently unless you make all of the<br>data freely available to the scientific<br>community<br>so on the protein Data Bank as I alluded<br>to before there's over a hundred<br>thousand different slightly different<br>Crystal structures of potentially<br>draggable targets available to any<br>scientific<br>so I don't look at these a lot but these<br>are the types of molecules that I look<br>at<br>I want to also not acknowledge<br>um Dr Andrea virtle who I have an<br>ongoing collaboration with I haven't<br>talked about g-production coupled<br>receptors much but this is one of her<br>Fields Jeep ocean covered receptors<br>whereby I help out with the modeling and<br>the students<br>um<br>in particular not so much looking for a<br>drug<br>but investigating chemical tools to<br>better understand the disease processes<br>and cell signaling implicated in various<br>diseases and conditions<br>specifically at the moment we're<br>targeting the adenosine receptor that's<br>the one that the caffeine hits in the<br>morning<br>also the cannabinoid receptors with<br>respect to disease and pain<br>now I I'm sure thousands wouldn't<br>believe me but I did actually add on the<br>students here who was smeak China<br>Ian and Anna Cooper on there who have<br>all worked very hard on this and they're<br>the students that have completed their<br>so the<br>it is the people particularly for me I<br>collaborate with others so these are<br>people that I have worked with over time<br>a lot of them I have published with some<br>of them not<br>um but up here we have I guess my honors<br>it's over there<br>my honor supervisor Glenn Deacon I'm<br>hoping<br>um my first Mentor David Fairley I won't<br>there's a couple there that I may have<br>forgotten but<br>please know that you're there<br>wait there's a second page<br>so there's a um again people that I work<br>with the students and people people that<br>as is always the case with a scientific<br>presentation one needs to formally<br>acknowledge the researchers that you<br>work with so these are the people that I<br>work with at uq Willa at UTS Monash<br>people<br>here at otago Edinburgh Ottawa Victoria<br>and just as a quick note the superscript<br>for most people for most of those means<br>that they're not no longer at that<br>institution and of course I missed a<br>couple as well also need to recognize<br>the funding bodies there that help<br>support the research and the<br>collaborators to put in those grants as<br>well<br>um so let's go back to a bit of the<br>water this is what I do when I'm not<br>here working<br>um I don't need to convince most people<br>that when you wake up on a Saturday<br>morning and you get to look at that<br>that's um that's pretty cool<br>particularly when you've got people like<br>this doing stupid things out in stupid<br>surf<br>that's at the national championships<br>um this is what it looks like after two<br>hours of paddling fairly hard in a<br>walker<br>um<br>which was two and a half years ago in<br>the Marlborough sounds<br>most of the time we prefer to have water<br>like this<br>which is nice and flat so we managed to<br>do a paddle from<br>from well to Clyde<br>these are before and after shots so this<br>is uh me in the fourth<br>was that the fifth wetsuit I'm not sure<br>this is the after shot that's all right<br>thankfully um the runner is with us<br>today after looking like death having<br>just run<br>a half marathon off-road we're also<br>going to do as our 11th Triathlon in a<br>month or two<br>and that's a significant collaboration<br>last one<br>so<br>these are the people that keep me going<br>so thank you very much for doing that<br>this one here I'll just point out that<br>was too cold to go outside in the snow<br>also my daughter taking one for the<br>cause the prize was beer for her winning<br>a Race So we took that on board<br>a special thanks to these people Trudy<br>Lara and Sam<br>as I said you keep me going mum dad and<br>die<br>give you a wave<br>um Dan and Kelly<br>thank you for coming<br>farron Gary great to have you here<br>Lata Milne crew also great as I said<br>collaboration of 10 years strong if not<br>a little worse for wear with a triathlon<br>team a few good knees little did we know<br>that I would also get a broken one too<br>um all the rest of the people up there<br>and there's some of my happy places<br>so this is Glenda Bay<br>um<br>that's actually just over there in the<br>harbor on a fantastic day in the middle<br>of winter<br>and thank you very much for listening<br>good evening everyone my name is Brian<br>Monk<br>I'm a member of the Department of oral<br>sciences and and I'm in Mr John Walsh<br>Research Institute in the faculty of<br>Dentistry<br>and Joel is a great collaborator he<br>collaborates with almost everyone I'm<br>surprised if he walks down the street he<br>doesn't start collaborating with someone<br>else<br>Joel's arrival in Dunedin that his wife<br>Trudy Merlin<br>2014 has proved to be an excellent<br>career move<br>in addition to raising their family<br>Trudy has spent almost two decades<br>carrying out research dental school so<br>and she's done that on a wide range of<br>projects in the meantime Joel<br>established his academic credentials in<br>the School of Pharmacy across campus<br>nationally and internationally and it<br>put a fantastic start into that even<br>in addition to his teaching and<br>administrative responsibilities Joel has<br>successfully assembled a computer-based<br>facility that has enabled him his<br>colleagues and students to visualize and<br>understand<br>um<br>and use effectively structures of Target<br>molecules and their ligands and<br>understanding the chemistry of what goes<br>on in those connected structures<br>as my group became increasingly<br>interested in using such valuable<br>products of structural biology<br>in order to complement the sort of stuff<br>we do which is to look at phenotypes and<br>how we can throw drugs at them and make<br>things really sick<br>or for example trying to understand drug<br>resistance as Joel talked about in his<br>talk<br>it was really great having Joel that the<br>structural biologist with Medicinal<br>Chemistry background across this just<br>across the other side of Frederick<br>Street<br>it proved to be very very convenient in<br>many ways and it's certainly a win-win<br>for my group<br>and the several students who we<br>co-supervised so they had some great<br>supervision<br>Joe's lecture this evening has clearly<br>Illustrated and communicated just a few<br>aspects I think of the high level<br>contribution he has made to several<br>research groups and across the board<br>spectrum of problems and projects it's<br>been a fascinating opportunity to listen<br>to you cover that broad spectrum but you<br>haven't done it in particular depth so I<br>look forward to hearing that in the<br>future<br>in some cases of course<br>Joel's structural studies his his model<br>building and a homology model building<br>and docking Studies have been of<br>immediate value you can go out and you<br>can find molecules that might work<br>and that's that's really great<br>but<br>even if the answers are not immediate of<br>course there's enormous value<br>the information created often helps<br>frame new and more insightful strategies<br>and questions and he's been doing that<br>throughout his career and it certainly<br>helped with the grants that we have<br>written locally in terms of having that<br>structural background there and having<br>finally doing the Mahi or the work by<br>creating libraries of Target and Target<br>ligand structures and models and<br>Publishing such information and placing<br>that information in curated databases<br>um<br>such as the protein Data Bank<br>contributes to a pool of accessible<br>biological information that will drive<br>future Innovations and solutions<br>such as novel drugs<br>as well as providing the basic knowledge<br>needed by evolving Technologies such as<br>artificial intelligence we've got to<br>have that basic knowledge out there and<br>Joel has made a great contribution to<br>that which I think he should be very<br>proud of<br>the adage that a picture is worth a<br>thousand words is clearly at this stage<br>I'd like to conclude by just talking a<br>little bit about where Joel came from<br>he's a graduate of Monastery University<br>he graduated there and I think what is<br>it<br>1994 before going on to a PhD in<br>Queensland<br>so Joel completed his BSC honors at<br>Monash 17 years after I completed my PhD<br>there<br>and I just want to talk about an<br>incident that briefly illustrates how we<br>work on scientific problem solving and<br>just how small the world we are in<br>actually is because Joel collaborates<br>with everyone so obviously<br>it doesn't take six people in the in the<br>world that you know to get to Joel takes<br>about two so I hear<br>so I the story is that about three weeks<br>and nineteen and about 1974 the fire<br>brigade attended the Monash University<br>biochemistry department where I was<br>doing my PhD<br>and they attended that building three<br>times over over three weeks in each case<br>it seemed to be a false alarm<br>on the third Friday afternoon visited by<br>the fire brigade the culprit causing the<br>call outs quietly identified himself<br>to his fellow PhD students<br>I don't think he identified himself to<br>the teaching staff<br>and he also put in place<br>a 100 effective solution to the problem<br>how did he do that<br>what had happened was that every Friday<br>getting towards the weekend he needed to<br>disinfect his bench and so what he would<br>do was put some ethanol out on the bench<br>and for some unwarranted reason he would<br>and what he then realized was after<br>three weeks that he was making this<br>little conflagration that went up and<br>there was a nice little heat sensor up<br>there that set off a fire alarm<br>at the fire department<br>importantly the student culprit had<br>successfully interpreted a serendipitous<br>experiment which was replicated three<br>times and what's more had implemented a<br>suitable course of action<br>that insulin clearly shows to me that<br>Monash University to be a great learning<br>environment from which Joel benefited in<br>the 1990s taking him from economics into<br>science<br>place where science is done every day in<br>an everyday Manner and of course the<br>place provides all the instruments you<br>but anyway furthermore the molecular<br>models and images that Joel prepares and<br>and shares uh so frequently illuminate<br>the way forward<br>and they usually glean from hard one and<br>and and sometimes serendipitous<br>structural information<br>often obtained at the Australian<br>synchrotron located adjacent to Monash<br>University so that University still has<br>a great impact on his life but I know<br>that Joel has a great impact on otago<br>University and I'm very proud of seeing<br>um<br>by the way I should go back to the<br>student culprit which is another link<br>the student culprit subsequently had a<br>stellar and I believe Fire free<br>scientific career<br>including helping establish the then the<br>helping establish and then heading the<br>prestigious Institute of molecular<br>bisciences in Brisbane<br>where Joel and Trudy were employed<br>briefly just before coming to Dunedin so<br>my final task is to acknowledge and<br>thank Joel for his excellent and<br>informative contribution this evening<br>and to present him with a token of our<br>appreciation which I understand has been<br>stashed down here sorry<br>congratulations<br>all right so there we are<br>uh<br>so I'm uh Neil gimmel I'm the acting<br>Deputy Pro Vice Chancellor of Health<br>Sciences and it's my great<br>pleasure to bring things to a close uh<br>by first thanking job for a wonderful<br>lecture and also thanking my colleagues<br>for their remarks opening and closing<br>the event<br>I am stunned by the work the Joel has<br>presented uh looking at molecular<br>interactions and I think most<br>importantly the interactions among<br>people which has mirrored in the work<br>that he does and so I think just to<br>conclude I just want to say please<br>continue the interactions with Joel and<br>far now in our staff Club where there<br>will be food and beverages available<br>here</p></main><footer style="margin-top: 2rem; background: #0001; padding: 2rem; text-align: center;"><p>We Are The University</p><ul style="list-style-type: none;
