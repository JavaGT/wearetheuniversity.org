asked to speak about something<br>interesting on design I kind of thought<br>oh gosh what's going to appeal<br>in a public lecture kind of forum and<br>that got me thinking not just about the<br>research that I do but what we do as<br>designers as well and the role that we<br>play in helping to shape people's<br>relationships with the information that<br>they're presented with on a daily basis<br>and that's where I came to the<br>realization that this is<br>largely what we do as designers is about<br>helping to shape people's perception of<br>information<br>so<br>this is done through a range of ways<br>it's about designing the interactions<br>that we have and shaping<br>um the large number of I guess types of<br>media and<br>ways that we interact with those media<br>it's about facilitating people in their<br>curation as well<br>and it's about<br>as we have moved through history from<br>the early<br>oral and pictorial<br>the computer has played an increasing<br>role<br>in<br>the shaping of the information that we<br>have around us and the ways that we<br>interact with it<br>so this<br>development of computing has meant that<br>the types of interactions we have with<br>information are<br>mostly digital on a day-to-day basis<br>that the curation of that information<br>has shifted<br>from being in the hands of a few<br>to being in the hands of many<br>and<br>the digital presentation of information<br>has also shaped the way we design that<br>information and present it to people so<br>the other three strands that I'd like to<br>pick up on tonight when talking about<br>information the way we design it and the<br>role that it plays in our lives<br>because the quantity of information that<br>we're now presented with on a daily<br>basis almost seems insurmountable to be<br>able to consume all of it<br>yet the time we have to be able to<br>consume that information feels like it's<br>constantly diminishing<br>well I think there's some quality<br>information out there still<br>it's just a case of discerning what that<br>quality information is from the quality<br>well information that lacks the same<br>amount of quality and so that's a bit of<br>a conundrum that we have and the<br>decisions that we're trying to make in<br>terms of what we consume in the time we<br>have<br>and making good decisions<br>that will be useful to us<br>is often informed by the presentation<br>and design of that information that's in<br>front of us sometimes it can be<br>misleading<br>but largely<br>well-designed information<br>so in the curation of information we<br>started historically that information<br>was largely shared orally sometimes<br>through pictographs and this move to<br>being written in books then printed in<br>books<br>and that then moved into digital media<br>and the holders and the people who<br>decided what information was passed on<br>kind of became wider and wider as<br>history progressed and the forms of<br>dissemination of information changed<br>so orally the information was often held<br>by a very small number of people and<br>this increased slightly as we started<br>printing in books and disseminating<br>books and printed information and then<br>the explosion of digital media in the<br>world wide web has now meant that<br>information<br>is in the hands of essentially anybody<br>who can use a computer<br>um and who decides what should be shared<br>who decides what we should be consuming<br>um is no longer held by a few but is<br>held by many<br>and we get that time versus quantity<br>dilemma of the fact that when there are<br>so many people producing and<br>disseminating information how do we<br>decide what we read what we consume and<br>the development of digital media has<br>also changed our interactions with<br>information<br>it's no longer a one to many<br>and now has developed into something<br>that's more of a conversation<br>something where people can contribute<br>back again as well as just be given<br>information too<br>it's moved from a very linear<br>progression of information so spaces<br>such as oral storytelling or a printed<br>book move through in a very linear<br>manner you turn the pages and one<br>follows another<br>the development of things like tables of<br>contents and indexes in books change<br>that linearity slightly and that it made<br>it easier for people to search and<br>consume the information within those<br>traditional linear media in a much more<br>informal interactive kind of way and<br>then digital media has changed that<br>again to the World Wide Web literally<br>being a network of ideas<br>um<br>sometimes very heavily connected other<br>times bits kind of just floating out the<br>side there<br>um<br>and so now as creators of information as<br>well we can't guarantee that someone<br>will come to our information having read<br>a particular part beforehand or having<br>and so the way that we also present<br>information now becomes important<br>because it influences people's<br>understanding of what information is<br>important and maybe what is worth<br>consuming<br>um because we are also now given thanks<br>to digital technology we have an<br>overwhelming number of ways of<br>presenting information<br>this is things like typefaces moving<br>from you know a few<br>um different typefaces<br>only a few fonts in metal type<br>to having<br>um you can now generate typefaces using<br>AI<br>and so<br>there are so many that are available to<br>us it becomes almost overwhelming<br>um either the design of information or<br>the non-design of information and being<br>able to discern whether something's<br>worth worth reading<br>um or worth not reading<br>presentation though shouldn't be a<br>barrier to whether something is<br>good information or not good quality<br>so I want to focus not just not on there<br>are so many aspects to the visual<br>presentation of information<br>visual information is incredibly<br>important but what I want to focus on is<br>the presentation primarily of textual<br>information<br>so the sorts of information that we<br>would read and consume<br>in<br>um forms that are<br>traditionally print or digital media<br>the way we present text<br>but design can help people<br>and it can help to shape people's<br>perception of that content<br>so what it can do is it can<br>help people with making curation<br>decisions<br>because text that is<br>well designed in theory<br>is more likely to be credible<br>information text that was published in<br>books had traditionally been through a<br>process of having an editor and having a<br>publisher and making sure that that<br>content was up to a certain standard to<br>be able to be worthy of publishing that<br>many copies at that cost<br>now in a digital era information is so<br>easily published<br>that we now need to consider<br>whether<br>the way that the information is being<br>the curation decisions we make are also<br>tied to helping us decide whether the<br>information that you are being presented<br>with In This Moment is the information<br>in this time for society that we live in<br>quite often we need to make decisions<br>quickly about what that information is<br>that's being presented to us on this<br>webpage or in this journal article<br>or on this blog post or whether it just<br>be a social media post but understanding<br>whether the information that's been<br>presented there is what you're looking<br>for quickly and easily<br>can be facilitated by the quality of the<br>the design of the information also is<br>change changes the interaction decisions<br>we make<br>will it mean that we quickly click away<br>because it doesn't actually seem that<br>interesting or it doesn't seem like it's<br>going to be easy to read<br>or is this a link that's clickable that<br>will take me to more information about<br>this specific idea that I want to know<br>more about<br>so just that design of a link<br>having a blue underlined word<br>can be the difference between someone<br>finding the information that they want<br>and in a world where so often we are<br>scrolling through information and<br>scrolling through screeds of information<br>sometimes<br>it's trying to encourage people to make<br>good decisions through the design of<br>that information about whether it's<br>worth their while to read<br>or to keep scrolling<br>is this a point in the information that<br>I want to stop<br>and read what I've found<br>the interactions that we're having have<br>with information have changed<br>significantly the knowledge that we are<br>now presented with isn't presented in<br>the same strictly linear fashion<br>um often that context that we are so<br>used to having by having a book with a<br>table of contents and a cover page that<br>can introduce that information to us<br>isn't as readily available and there are<br>different kind of design signals that we<br>need to give to help people understand<br>whether they want to interact with this<br>information or not<br>the context that people have coming into<br>that information before they get to<br>where they currently are is often a lot<br>less known too<br>our attention spans are shorter<br>we are far more likely to just go with<br>doom scrolling<br>it's become an absolute habit of many<br>people today is to just scroll<br>infinitely<br>and the job of a designer can be to help<br>stop<br>that scroll<br>presenting information that will stop<br>people<br>and take a bit more notice of the<br>the digital worlds that we are working<br>in though also pose new options for<br>interaction with the information we're<br>presented with<br>we can<br>change information on the on the spot as<br>the consumer of information as well we<br>can change the way it is presented to us<br>in some situations I know that my<br>husband has his phone type set on like<br>the largest setting then you can only<br>fit like three words on the screen I I<br>swear he's not an old man he's only in<br>his 40s but seriously<br>um I'm pretty sure he's yeah holding it<br>like this too<br>um so people can also make really bad<br>design decisions about their information<br>as well so when we put information<br>presentation decisions in the hands of<br>an individual<br>sometimes they make great decisions with<br>that information<br>because the perception that each<br>individual has of information is very<br>individual very individual<br>people come with<br>either poor eyesight<br>or<br>a font they particularly love or a<br>format they're more used to<br>and<br>all of these things play A Part<br>in creating information that is<br>appealing to an individual<br>so I think there's no Silver Bullet<br>there's no perfect way to prevent to<br>present textual information to people<br>but there are things that we need to be<br>aware of as the creators of content and<br>the people who are sharing content<br>there are things we need to be aware of<br>in order to be able to make at least<br>some inroads towards<br>information being easy and accessible<br>from some research I've done I've found<br>that designers definitely see things<br>differently<br>um<br>mainly just that we we sort of see space<br>more than people who aren't trained as<br>designers<br>there's probably a lot more to be<br>unpacked there than than the first kind<br>of research study that I did<br>um<br>but interesting to know that different<br>people see<br>the information they're presented with<br>in different ways<br>the example um to the right there is<br>actually just a screenshot from the ACM<br>news email that I think I get every week<br>feels like every day but it's probably<br>every week and I noticed when sort of<br>that's the way that it's been presented<br>definitely makes it easier to scroll<br>more quickly through that information<br>with the titles of the Articles being<br>blue with<br>the authors and their institutions being<br>darker and bold underneath although I<br>may have done that the other way around<br>personally because the Bold kind of<br>stands out more than the blue I<br>questioned this but you know the the<br>thoughts there they've put some intent<br>to trying to make this less of a doom<br>scroll and more of a people actually<br>intentionally consuming the content that<br>they want consumed<br>then you know a bit of a blurb after<br>that and a button<br>um the button as a designer the space<br>there really bugs me that it's the same<br>there's the same space above the button<br>is below it so I'm actually not certain<br>whether it belongs to the information<br>above it or the information below it but<br>knowing that the first one came after<br>the first lot of text helps that but I<br>shouldn't have to question that<br>other things that<br>um are really important to understand<br>when people are consuming text and the<br>different perceptions that individuals<br>have is that people are actually far<br>more likely to get lost when they're<br>scrolling through text<br>they don't know where they are how far<br>through am I and we used to have this<br>great little scroll bar down the side<br>but I've now noticed<br>that quite often the scroll bar just<br>kind of endlessly moves down it gets to<br>a point and then it's no longer an<br>orientation cue to help you know how far<br>through this endless Scroll of<br>information you are so what used to be a<br>really functional visual tool for us has<br>been destroyed<br>the other thing I've found through<br>research is that people who read slower<br>need to be considered a bit more<br>people who are fast readers we can<br>I'm not saying we have to we should pay<br>less attention to the visual design but<br>they're more tolerant of<br>design that's not as effective<br>but people who are slower at reading<br>need a bit more structure and a bit more<br>help<br>and so individual perception and<br>individual differences and accounting<br>for those when we design and present<br>information to people is really<br>important<br>so one way that we can<br>help improve the quality and the<br>accessibility of information<br>in especially these kind of scrolling<br>type situations is to use a bit of<br>emphasis<br>so like I showed in that last image with<br>the ACM email with all the news bites<br>they've used emphasis to help assist<br>people to pull out the information that<br>will help them make decisions as they<br>work through that process of deciding<br>whether each individual item is worth<br>reading<br>so using things such as bulge to<br>highlight the headings will help people<br>with reading them as they scroll through<br>blue maybe wasn't the best option but<br>bold was good we can go with bold<br>um changing the typeface is a good<br>option as well increasing the size<br>need to increase it enough to be more<br>than 20 but not too much any more than<br>kind of 40 and you've like completely<br>killed someone's flow<br>um<br>quite often capitalization is used many<br>journals use capitalization<br>a lot of books especially from more<br>traditional Publishers use<br>capitalization for pulling out use<br>headings<br>um<br>capitalizations actually not the best<br>option if you want people to be able to<br>read it quickly<br>and italics seems like a great way of<br>emphasizing things too but people<br>generally just tend to think that that's<br>kind of within the text and something<br>that should be within the flow of what's<br>being said<br>oh<br>did I choose a bad typeface is that hard<br>to read<br>sorry I probably should choose something<br>more appropriate for the situation<br>because typeface Choice matters as well<br>the options that we have now seem to be<br>endless<br>um<br>from<br>like I said having just a few options of<br>different fonts to choose from to set<br>through to now having what feels like an<br>endless supply that is sometimes curated<br>for us by the systems we are using<br>and other times as we search the<br>internet for new inspiration<br>um a seemingly endless supply quite<br>often we have a favorite<br>I know I certainly have favorites that I<br>gravitate towards<br>um<br>but it also depends on the situation too<br>um<br>quite often though people just use the<br>default<br>sometimes<br>that could be a good option because for<br>many people there's the old adage of we<br>read best what we read most<br>and so lots of people are very<br>comfortable reading Times New Roman<br>um I'm not saying I'm<br>a great fan of Times New Roman<br>um but it is something that people quite<br>comfortably read<br>um<br>or if you're familiar with using Adobe<br>products we're usually given Myriad as a<br>default which<br>different situation again<br>um<br>and so we can scroll Google fonts we can<br>find new amazing typefaces that have<br>been curated in some way because they<br>have had to jump through hoops to be<br>able to be listed as a Google font or we<br>can go to any number of<br>um terrible websites where people can<br>upload their own experiments<br>through to now there being options where<br>you can use AI to design new typefaces<br>with new parameters so who knows what um<br>completely eligible<br>um<br>experiments will come out of that<br>um<br>but when presenting<br>text to be read Clarity is important the<br>ability to distinguish the letter forms<br>and understand the difference between a<br>b and a d the difference between an O<br>and an a<br>assists people with knowing what the<br>information is that's in front of them<br>context is also important understanding<br>who you're designing for and who's<br>likely to be consuming this information<br>are also really important things to<br>consider in the development of what<br>you're creating<br>because typefaces have personality<br>they are like images that help to bring<br>the content that they are presenting to<br>life<br>they're like people<br>we love some of them<br>we may not like some of them as much as<br>others<br>they each tell a story and they each<br>have a different way of showing their<br>face to the world<br>some of them are outgoing and bold and<br>will steal a show and others of them are<br>quite happy to just sit back and relax<br>and enjoy being in the corner and just<br>hold on to their little piece of content<br>in case someone wants to come and<br>and so thinking about the context in<br>which you are using a typeface is<br>important<br>is it a single short word where you can<br>Express something in a flamboyant and<br>interesting way<br>are you expressing it to people who are<br>very set in their ways or are you<br>expressing it to people who are<br>um more open to experimentation<br>is there a need for it to feel a certain<br>way a typeface can take people on a<br>journey back in time<br>it can make people<br>feel a certain sense of time and place<br>as they read the words that a typeface<br>has been printed in<br>or been presented in on a screen<br>for considering not just<br>what the words say<br>but the message that the typeface<br>they're printed in delivers<br>once we get past the typeface<br>we need to think about what makes people<br>read on<br>what will make people want to continue<br>to consume the content that we have and<br>that's a challenge these days when we<br>have so much content that is being<br>presented to us<br>if we are presenting content that's easy<br>for people to consume and easy for<br>people to read<br>will that help increase their interest<br>in the content<br>if it's presented in a way that is easy<br>for them to be able to understand not<br>just<br>what they're reading<br>because it's a clear and legible<br>typeface but also<br>understand how far through this<br>information am I<br>remembering what's come before and<br>knowing the context of what they're<br>reading about<br>also when we're scrolling ads ads more<br>ads sometimes I think there's more ads<br>than content<br>um<br>I know I certainly get frustrated and<br>just give up sometimes even if the<br>content's great the ads just make me<br>move on I'm just I'm done with this I<br>can't deal with this other it's the same<br>ad over and over again sometimes too<br>which is even worse<br>so carefully considering like what we do<br>in the presentation of information<br>will often shape whether people will<br>read on or not as well<br>because here we have two passages of<br>text<br>kindly generated for me using um AI but<br>um this is actually the same passage of<br>text<br>both times one of them feels despite<br>being longer a lot more approachable<br>a bit easier to read<br>um<br>it also feels a bit more accessible with<br>the fact that I've got some different<br>examples in there of ways of drawing out<br>people's attention to get them reading<br>and understanding the content that will<br>follow<br>so first up that first line those first<br>few words<br>are actually slightly larger than the<br>rest of the content and they're also<br>bold<br>which draws our attention there and<br>gives us a sense of what the content is<br>that follows on<br>from that first few words<br>at the start of that second paragraph<br>those that first line is in bold it's<br>the same size as the rest of the text<br>but it helps to draw us down to that so<br>if we were searching not just for the<br>information that's in the first<br>paragraph but looking for the<br>information that was in the second<br>paragraph<br>we'd be able to find that content more<br>easily<br>and then as we get further down<br>in that second to last paragraph<br>it's getting harder to see but there's<br>not as easy to see<br>doesn't draw as attention as well and<br>maybe we want that subtlety of<br>highlighting some information but not<br>enough that it jumps out of the page at<br>somebody<br>and lastly in that final paragraph<br>um there's actually a few words<br>that are italicized<br>again really not not as easy to see and<br>people see I tell us I italicized text<br>as being text that is just slight<br>emphasis of something that's in the Run<br>but we can see by just comparing these<br>or these two passages of text one with<br>paragraphs and one without<br>all of a sudden the text just feels a<br>whole lot more accessible so simple<br>changes that we're making help to create<br>a more accessible passage of text and<br>hopefully means that someone reads past<br>the first couple of lines and consumes<br>the content that we're presenting for<br>them<br>so information design matters<br>um<br>and this is just the tip of the iceberg<br>this is just looking at text-based<br>information<br>the way we design the information that<br>we're presenting to other people whether<br>it be in<br>a short printed piece of information<br>the way we present it would form and<br>change people's opinions of what we're<br>showing them<br>will they scroll on<br>will they flick past it or will they<br>stop and at least read what the title is<br>and what the heading is<br>and the hope that they might actually<br>consume<br>a bit more of that information and what<br>will keep them consuming that<br>information if they start how do we keep<br>them reading<br>how do we keep them consuming<br>if they're searching just for a small<br>snippet of information how do we help<br>them<br>scan that text how do we present that<br>information in a way that makes it easy<br>to scan<br>easy to see the content and easy to find<br>if they've scanned that information and<br>found what they're looking for<br>will they then read on<br>will they consume that information on a<br>deeper level<br>and once they consume that information<br>because the way we present that<br>information can also help people<br>understand it on a deeper level<br>and because of the typeface we've chosen<br>because of the spacing and layout<br>choices we've made how will they feel<br>about that text<br>will it have made them feel really<br>anxious and they just want to get out of<br>there because it was just all a bit too<br>much<br>or will they feel really satisfied and<br>relaxed and comfortable with having<br>consumed that information<br>so the choices that we make shape the<br>choices that the consumers of<br>information make<br>those of us who are<br>making those visual presentation choices<br>for information<br>and this digital age are helping to<br>shape<br>people's curation and decision making<br>and what they will choose to read<br>because there is so much out there there<br>is so much to consume that we need to<br>help people Choose Wisely in order to<br>fulfill their information seeking needs<br>we are<br>thank you very much<br>I am happy for questions if people would<br>yes<br>um years ago when I was looking at web<br>design and page design somebody said<br>however many fonts do you think you're<br>going to need<br>to get rid of pretty much all of that<br>too yes is that still uh truth today<br>because I noticed you said a variational<br>type basis so what yes so<br>yeah absolutely I would absolutely agree<br>with that advice<br>um<br>but often it's really useful to have a<br>secondary typeface so you've got the<br>main typeface that you've got for the<br>body and the majority of your text but<br>having a second typeface to be able to<br>use for headings or to emphasize text<br>will often be really useful and so quite<br>often as well if we have a serif<br>typeface such as Times New Roman for the<br>body copy<br>or Georgia or<br>another type of serif typeface for the<br>majority of the text having a Sans serif<br>type face yeah<br>um like that will stand out and look<br>stylistically different but fit nicely<br>in terms of a similar kind of proportion<br>to that main typeface will help to<br>create those points of emphasis for<br>people<br>um<br>so you will often notice that um<br>you'll have a sincere of typeface for<br>the headings<br>when you'd to have that contrast with<br>the body copy of the text yeah but yes<br>keep it keep it simple<br>definitely<br>yes<br>free rules<br>oh<br>right as I go home well yeah right the<br>designer said<br>keep it simple<br>use more space than you think you need<br>so between the lines and around the text<br>um<br>so increasing the amount of space<br>between those lines helps to make it a<br>lot a lot easier to read<br>um<br>and my third piece of advice would be to<br>oh maybe I need to do some research to<br>find out what the best three pieces of<br>advice are um I would say use emphasis<br>so create variation because when it<br>feels monotonous that's when I think<br>you're going to lose people too and<br>it'll also help people kind of keep<br>oriented within the text as they're<br>reading through so<br>yes<br>nutrition<br>spent do you mean all people I think<br>it's in general I think also it's a<br>generational thing too maybe and it's<br>most people it's not everybody<br>um but I think we're often<br>we've got a lot going on around us and<br>so it's maintaining people's attention<br>to you know<br>um I think it's certainly a very<br>different situation if I am<br>sitting at home with my book<br>where there's no phone next to me where<br>there's no one in theory the kids are<br>out when there's no one going to disturb<br>me versus when I'm in my office I've got<br>my screen I've got books I've got 16<br>tabs open I've got my phone next to me<br>oh yeah and there's lots of different<br>points of information that are demanding<br>yes<br>but I think yeah we're in situations<br>where there are more distractions and<br>more things that are competing for our<br>attention and also I think when we're in<br>these spaces especially digital spaces<br>where there's the opportunity to<br>navigate away from the content that<br>changes the way that we interact with it<br>too when we're in a novel<br>it's linear and we um you know less<br>likely Turka oh I wonder what that link<br>takes me to and wander off to there<br>whereas on a web page<br>even if it is kind of a longer article<br>you'll often find that there are links<br>that will take you away even on in a<br>journal article we can click away to a<br>reference<br>and while we might be you know reading<br>in a sustained way that article we then<br>go oh actually that's really interesting<br>point<br>and you leave the thing that was really<br>interesting and follow that that new<br>Trail so yeah<br>maybe we're just more distractions in<br>I haven't asked chat GPT for a solution<br>to this<br>um interestingly I use chat GPT to get<br>that text and I asked it<br>four times I think please give me some<br>text about text and so it gave me four<br>paragraphs of text about text<br>um<br>I think the hard thing<br>and I'd be interested to talk to you<br>more about this would be that paragraphs<br>need to stop at kind of a logical point<br>and where the chat GPT would be able to<br>understand where are The Logical points<br>to break<br>because they're<br>you know I'd be interested to know yeah<br>it'd be great to know<br>um so there is some research out there<br>that says that the frequency of a<br>heading should be approximately every<br>400 words for easy searchability of<br>yes<br>yep<br>absolutely but there's also then that<br>problem of I've just I've experienced<br>this with reading Journal articles in<br>that yes you do you want them presented<br>in different ways and print compared to<br>screen as well and starting to read an<br>article which I swear I've never read<br>before<br>because it looks different<br>to the other version and even different<br>repositories have different visual<br>presentations of the same article<br>um which I think is really interesting<br>um so yes there are definitely things<br>that you should do differently in<br>different media<br>it's not horrendous<br>um<br>there's definitely some improvements<br>that could be made but there's a lot<br>worse out there<br>they chunk information reasonably well<br>although I do find that the line length<br>is exceedingly long for the amount of<br>space between the lines<br>do you often find when you're reading an<br>article that you get to that end and<br>then you can't find the start of the<br>next line yep so small shorter line<br>length and more space between the lines<br>would help people there<br>but you know yeah so there are design<br>improvements that could be made<br>rough<br>yes<br>yes oh okay this has taken me back a<br>long way in my research now<br>um I did a type uh and color combination<br>I started and did something for that for<br>my honors<br>but um so the contrast is what's really<br>important<br>um so people need adequate contrast<br>between the text and the background<br>whether it be black on white or white on<br>black or Grays or creams or<br>um it's<br>it's<br>um also some research that we did with<br>Nick and I did with some people at<br>education a long time ago feels like a<br>million years ago now and looking at um<br>children and their ability to read and<br>correct themselves and changes with<br>different text and background colors but<br>um<br>you do need adequate contrast but it<br>doesn't need to be black on white or<br>there's another question over here<br>yep<br>to an extent um partly there'll be<br>content too you know like a headline can<br>make you angry absolutely<br>um<br>but definitely there are<br>like subtleties that will change<br>people's kind of emotional response so<br>text that is much heavier and darker and<br>larger in a very solid Sans serif<br>typeface is going to have a stronger<br>more aggressive feel to it than<br>something that is a thinner more<br>balanced serif typeface<br>so yeah you do have kind of different<br>feelings to to what these typefaces kind<br>of bring out in you and you know and<br>obviously coming back to the question<br>about color if it's going to be red you<br>know there are kind of connotations that<br>although then you have to be very<br>conscious of the different cultural<br>connotations of different colors as well<br>so black isn't necessarily always a<br>negative color in red isn't always a<br>color about anger so<br>yeah cultural context matters too yeah<br>yeah man did you have a yep yeah um<br>background images yes<br>back in the early days of the web I<br>remember every web page seemed to have<br>like printed on some sort of textured<br>paper yes sort of effect that seems to<br>have disappeared in more recent years or<br>am I just not walking in the right<br>places no yeah it's disappeared and that<br>is a great thing<br>by and large<br>yeah yep we also don't get music when we<br>open someone's Myspace page anymore<br>which is also good yeah<br>so this um<br>yeah so that<br>that the use of Textures in the<br>background plays into that idea of<br>contrast between the text and the<br>background and ensuring that there's<br>good readability<br>so often when you have a texture in the<br>background you've got more variation<br>in kind of the intensity of that color<br>which then makes it potentially more<br>difficult to read hmm<br>but if you can do it something subtles<br>you know potentially okay<br>tricky<br>okay<br>I think clear again for the<br>and in looking ahead and actually<br>acknowledging that we are in July<br>already even though you might not have<br>known that this is not the design month<br>this is actually cyber security month so<br>Friday and Saturday we have the cyber<br>security challenge for the 10th time<br>already and lots of very interested<br>people in<br>breaking cyberspace will come to the<br>university and be already registered and<br>we have later this month we have vimal<br>Kumar we'll talk about cyber security<br>um I don't have the date for that one<br>yet and then August will be machine<br>learning and AI so we need to hold on to<br>Bernard's question we press the talk on<br>the 7th of August uh by Albert it's<br>about Chet GPT and other things and we<br>can then go back and actually say right<br>so can check actually do some proper<br>design of presenting the information yes<br>um that one will be presented over in<br>Tauranga so that may be the opportunity<br>to think that I want to spend the day in<br>Tauranga 7th of August chat GPT weka and<br>AI Institute and waikato</p></main><footer style="margin-top: 2rem; background: #0001; padding: 2rem; text-align: center;"><p>We Are The
