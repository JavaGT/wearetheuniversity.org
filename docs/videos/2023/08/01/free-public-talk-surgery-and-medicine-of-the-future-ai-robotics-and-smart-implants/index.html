campus I and thank you for<br>braving quite a chili I know it's not<br>raining today but my gosh it's so chilly<br>and so thank you for braving the weather<br>to come and join us this evening<br>um and we're very grateful and you're<br>going to be meet some amazing people who<br>are currently sitting on the couch I<br>kind of always wanted to be on Oprah so<br>I feel like this is probably the closest<br>I'm going to get to it<br>um around this uh really exciting<br>kaupapa of the future of surgery and<br>where AI fits into that<br>um the waiter that I started this<br>evening with is a very very old waiter<br>and it talks about uh when<br>when we<br>when we are doing our succession<br>planning who will come in and take the<br>next then the next person on the pie who<br>will be the next person that follows<br>through on that<br>um and and will they be able to stick to<br>the values and the truths that we've so<br>closely held on to and I think<br>um the it's interesting that AI can both<br>scare us and excite us but it definitely<br>is a really important part of our<br>succession planning because it's a<br>technology that all future health<br>professionals will<br>you know be as flawed with as we are<br>with our smartphones<br>trying to be with our smartphones<br>and so it's a great opportunity for us<br>to think about the values and principles<br>this evening that we want to continue<br>within the future of medicine but how we<br>uh buddy up and work alongside AI with<br>that so I just really want to begin to<br>wish you a warm welcome to our campus<br>it's exciting to see you all here this<br>evening kyotakoto and with that I get to<br>hand you over to our wonderful emcee for<br>the evening at Laura Lee Mason Twitter<br>Laurel<br>welcome everybody here to the rollerson<br>theater for the second of our four<br>public talks to celebrate kiamao the<br>University of otago christchurch's 50th<br>Anniversary showcasing our academic<br>clinical and research expertise my name<br>is Lori Mason I'm the communications<br>it means we look to the future with hope<br>and it's certainly a really exciting<br>time to be entering or practicing<br>medicine surgery and in the health<br>science field right now<br>Health Tech advances are rapid they're<br>impressive of course there is a price<br>tag of an affordability issue to<br>consider especially for<br>Australian with our stretched health<br>system and unmet need and inequity of<br>care access but how do we balance all<br>this is it in fact more cost effective<br>to embrace new health Tech to save time<br>and therefore money and deliver to a<br>level of patient care which is<br>potentially Superior and safer<br>absolutely<br>but this of course is all part of the<br>current debate Health Systems around the<br>we've got a very busy hour coming up<br>hearing expert opinion on all sorts of<br>wonderful Health Tech AI virtual reality<br>robotics 3D bone printing smart implants<br>o arms VR goggles custom titanium<br>implants set grafts and new scanning<br>modalities which enable doctors to see<br>inside the body like never before<br>futuristic technology which could be<br>coming to an operating theater or a<br>radiology Suite near you<br>we have four fabulous leaders in their<br>field to speak to you tonight each of<br>them Professor Gary Hooper Professor Tim<br>eggerton Professor Tim Woodfield and<br>associate professor Tracy Meltzer will<br>be giving a presentation<br>and this will be Then followed by a q a<br>session afterwards with what time we<br>have left so any great questions for the<br>for the guys please have a think as they<br>give their presentations<br>Tracy Meltzer is an associate professor<br>in the Department of Medicine here on<br>campus and he's also Imaging research<br>manager at the New Zealand Brain<br>Research Institute nzbri here in<br>Christchurch where he oversees all<br>Imaging and is currently involved in a<br>wide range of neurological research<br>ranging from Child Development to<br>neurodegenerative diseases<br>Montana and the U.S Tracy completed his<br>PhD here in New Zealand and has been a<br>kiwi for some time<br>as well as having won many awards grants<br>and having amassed a large body of<br>published research his prime research<br>focus is on the development and<br>application of MRI magnetic resonance<br>imaging and positron emission tomography<br>pet Radiology scanning techniques to<br>advance our understanding of cognitive<br>decline in Parkinson's disease<br>now NZ Bri's team has established one of<br>the world's largest single Center MRI<br>databases of Parkinson's disease<br>patients and it now it's now allowing<br>them to investigate whether markets can<br>be detected to Signal brain decline<br>before it happens<br>as Tracy will now explain exciting<br>advantages in scanning technology are at<br>I'm very pleased to be here this evening<br>uh lovely to see you all here and what<br>I'd like to do to start the evening off<br>is to talk about one of my favorite<br>topics which is Medical Imaging so<br>I'm assuming that most of us would agree<br>that Medical Imaging is completely<br>one of the most useful techniques that<br>we see at almost every hospital and<br>Clinic worldwide and one of the reasons<br>for that is probably the actual the<br>ability to look inside the body in live<br>human beings is has always been and will<br>continue to be revolutionary<br>uh what you see up there is one of the<br>first x-ray images that was ever taken<br>that was taken in 1895 by Wilhelm runkin<br>he was the first to produce and then<br>detect X-rays and that image that you<br>see although a little bit blurry is the<br>image of his wife's hand so you can see<br>the bones in there a little bit do I<br>have a<br>I do you can see the bones in there but<br>you can also see her ring right right so<br>not mad uh at all and he won the Nobel<br>Prize in 1901 for this the first Nobel<br>Prize in physics by the way and very<br>well deserved but things have come a<br>long way since those first images so<br>these are Cutting Edge CT images so<br>three-dimensional x-ray images<br>and this is an image of the wrist so<br>what you're looking at here is a wrist<br>so here's the forearm coming up to a<br>small bone in the wrist and hopefully<br>you can see that that is actually broken<br>there what you can see over here is<br>we've had a surgeon come in and insert a<br>screw to try and help with the treatment<br>of that of that scan what I hope you can<br>see from these images is that a they are<br>incredible images but the other thing<br>that you may not be able to see but we<br>can certainly tell when we analyze these<br>images is that we're getting very much<br>more information than we ever have from<br>x-ray images now these are from the Mars<br>bio women bioengineering uh excuse me<br>Mars bio Imaging research group here on<br>campus and they've provided these images<br>and they're using CT to look at a<br>special type of X-ray a colored x-ray<br>which gives us this extra amount of<br>information<br>now other types of Imaging as you heard<br>Laura Lee mentioned MRI in particular<br>magnetic resonance imaging and this is<br>one of my areas which I I get quite<br>excited about so MRI is an Imaging<br>technique which uses powerful magnets<br>and radio frequency waves to create<br>detailed images of the body it's safe<br>and non-invasive but one of the other<br>things about it and I would say it's<br>probably its greatest Advantage is its<br>flexibility<br>what I mean by that is that if we um we<br>can slightly adjust the initial<br>parameters on the scanner and we can<br>create a whole host of different images<br>and these different images can tell us<br>about different aspects of brain health<br>now the other thing that you might see<br>from this slide is my slight bias<br>towards a particular organ in the body<br>that happens to be the brain so I<br>apologize for that but I don't really<br>apologize because brains are amazing but<br>I think it just highlights the<br>flexibility of Mr Imaging now just like<br>CT and x-rays Mr imaging has come a long<br>way in the past few years so the image<br>that you're looking at here is an image<br>that I produced during my PhD here at<br>otago in 2009 now you're looking at a<br>brain an MR brain so here's the front of<br>the brain here's the back of the brain<br>you're looking at that side-on view of<br>my of my brain there now I spent hours<br>acquiring this image processing this<br>image making it look pretty this is<br>looking at White matter in the in the<br>brain and I was pretty proud of this<br>image in 2009 but as you can imagine<br>things have changed significantly so<br>this is a cutting-edge image a diffusion<br>Mr image not only is it a beautiful<br>image but the information that we get<br>from this image is much more robust we<br>have quantitative values much more<br>informative values about both structure<br>and microstructure<br>so Imaging is getting better I think<br>that we could probably assume that but<br>what what now what comes after this<br>so<br>they're just two quick things that I'd<br>like to talk about two specific areas<br>that I'm currently interested in well I<br>have lots of interest but these two FIT<br>within a talk so the first is artificial<br>intelligence or deep learning just like<br>the rest of society I'm quite interested<br>in in Ai and the other is molecular<br>Imaging which I'll just touch on briefly<br>so what do we mean by Deep learning in<br>AI as you'll hear throughout the talks<br>this afternoon or this evening so this<br>these are are very versatile techniques<br>and they really do provide us with<br>Incredible opportunities in medical<br>imaging so the basic idea is that we<br>train these different algorithms to do a<br>specific task very very well and<br>hopefully better than humans can do that<br>task and we're already seeing<br>applications in medical imaging of AI<br>and deep learning and some of those are<br>listed up here so people are currently<br>using Ai and imaging to help us fix<br>Imaging artifacts to make the images<br>look better to help us reconstruct the<br>images better so take the images from<br>the scanner and turn them into useful<br>images we're using AI to speed up the<br>acquisition times of our images we're<br>using AI to make them have better<br>spatial resolution better contrast make<br>them look better make them more useful<br>and as part of this that allows us to<br>then look at identifying lesions in a<br>more consistent and hopefully better way<br>another thing that I think is is really<br>interesting is the use of these AI<br>models to create predictive models of<br>disease and help us think about<br>progression and changes over time in<br>specific diseases<br>now as I mentioned these applications<br>and algorithms are occurring now but<br>this really is the early stage of<br>implementation and so this this field is<br>ready for to explode<br>um even more so than it already has so I<br>really think we need to watch the space<br>and I'm sure a little bit more about Ai<br>and surgery and Medicine throughout the<br>evening but a quick example<br>um here in Christchurch looking at knees<br>so on the left here you have a normal<br>MRI scan of the knee this is a<br>horizontal slice through the knee so<br>what you're looking at here is the<br>kneecap and then left of the knee right<br>of the knee this is a standard knee that<br>we would use clinically every day on the<br>right we have an AI augmented knee scan<br>and there's a few things that you can<br>see here one is that the resolution is<br>80 better and at the time that it took<br>us to acquire this image was 40 faster<br>so we have better images with more<br>contrast more information which help<br>diagnoses we have faster images which<br>means the people are in the scanner for<br>shorter amounts of time which means we<br>can reduce the strain on the health<br>system in the backlog of people who need<br>Imaging and that ultimately leads to<br>reduced costs for everyone right so this<br>is just one small application of AI here<br>in Christchurch which you can see has<br>quite wide and large ramifications for<br>right so the other area that I'd really<br>like to talk about is molecular Imaging<br>and what do I mean by molecular Imaging<br>well this is a an approach to Imaging<br>which looks to quantify and visualize<br>biological processes which occur at the<br>cellular and even subcellular level and<br>to do that in live humans so people who<br>are actually alive<br>so probably the next example of this is<br>amyloid Pet Imaging in Alzheimer's<br>disease<br>so Alzheimer's disease is associated<br>with two main Hallmark proteins or<br>pathologies one of those is amyloid beta<br>plaques so we all have beta amyloid in<br>our brains it's a protein which<br>functions normally most of the time but<br>in Alzheimer's disease it starts to<br>misfold it gets sticky it clumps<br>together and it starts to form these<br>beta amyloid plaques which are then<br>accumulating into positive and brain<br>tissue and then get in the way of<br>function and help and lead to the<br>symptoms of Alzheimer's disease<br>now and that's just actually what you<br>can see here's some tissue of what these<br>actual plaques look like<br>but we now have a very sensitive PET<br>Imaging technique amyloid pet which<br>allows us to visualize and identify the<br>deposition of these plaques in Vivo and<br>that's what you see in these two images<br>here so here on the left we have what we<br>call an amyloid negative scan so areas<br>of blue here in the brain are indicating<br>no deposition of beta amyloid plaques<br>where here on the right you can see all<br>this brain tissue in red indicating high<br>levels of beta amyloid which you'd<br>expect to see in a condition like<br>Alzheimer's disease now this is really<br>important even more so now because we<br>have two drugs which are approved by FDA<br>to clear amyloid from the brain in the<br>context of Alzheimer's disease and as<br>recently as a few weeks ago a third drug<br>was actually published and that looks to<br>be the best drug yet in terms of<br>clearing amyloid in Alzheimer's disease<br>so this becomes really important because<br>a we need to be able to identify in a<br>consistent and accurate way who has<br>amyloid in the brain so we know who to<br>treat we all also need to know who does<br>not have amyloid in the brain because we<br>know these new treatments have side<br>effects so we don't want to expose those<br>people to those potential side effects<br>and lastly this also now gives us a nice<br>objective quantitative metric of how<br>well the treatment is working we can<br>tell whether these new anti-ambloid<br>drugs are clearing amyloid from the<br>brain<br>an AMOLED pet is just the tip of the<br>iceberg we can get our chemistry right<br>and we can again have some flexibility<br>here we can look at different proteins<br>we can look at specific cancer cells we<br>can look at even different cell types in<br>things like inflammation using molecular<br>Imaging with pet<br>so the future is quite bright for<br>molecular Imaging and I'm quite excited<br>to see how that actually influences<br>clinical care in the short medium and<br>long term and so lastly just leave you<br>with another nice Mr image and say just<br>give you a reminder that Imaging is<br>incredibly beneficial and I think it's<br>enormously has an enormous potential for<br>the future<br>so with that kyota and thank you very<br>much<br>that's wonderful thanks so much Tracy<br>well um Professor Tim Eglinton is a<br>consultant colorectal and general<br>surgeon and head of our department of<br>surgery here at the University of otago<br>Christchurch<br>he's been a busy surgeon working both<br>publicly and privately in Christchurch<br>since 2008 and as one of the South<br>Island's foremost laparoscopic<br>colorectal surgeons as head of the<br>department of surgery Tim has a strong<br>research interest in diverticular<br>disease and inflammatory bowel disease<br>and improving the lives of patients with<br>colorectal cancer<br>he's published over 100 papers and texts<br>and received an impressive number of<br>distinctions and Awards as a senior<br>Surgical Specialist Tim's also heavily<br>involved in training young surgeons in<br>Christchurch and all through australasia<br>where the use of Robotics and other<br>and welcome thank you Laura Lee and<br>thank you all for coming this evening to<br>listen to us talk about the the future<br>of surgery now I'm going to talk about<br>surgical robotics I'm going to have a<br>look at where we are now and where we<br>might get to with a focus on my area of<br>specialty as Laura Lee said as abdominal<br>problems things like colorectal cancer<br>so I'm going to look at some of the<br>particular challenges that we face with<br>surgical robotics in the abdominal<br>cavity<br>now but the first challenge I faced<br>tonight to be honest was prediction<br>itself<br>because as Niels Bohr famously said<br>prediction is very difficult especially<br>now<br>prediction in medicine is a really<br>fraught thing a lot of people far more<br>imminent than me have tried to predict<br>the future of medicine and failed<br>miserably<br>now can you imagine if Lord Kelvin was<br>sitting in the audience here listening<br>to Tracy's amazing talk on medical<br>imaging he'd be a bit red-faced about<br>what he said about x-rays back in the<br>19th century<br>and said John Erickson the surgeon<br>extraordinaire he said 200 years ago<br>so I think we all know now that surgery<br>has made remarkable progress over that<br>period and so John Erickson's time if<br>you got a diagnosis of bowel cancer that<br>was a death sentence<br>even if you think about in the early<br>part of the 20th century if you had an<br>operation for bowel cancer you had more<br>chance of dying from that surgery than<br>surviving it it's quite a statistic<br>I mean nowadays with our modern<br>Keyhole surgery the outcomes are<br>obviously much much better but they're<br>still not not perfect<br>and most recently we've seen<br>the introduction of these surgical<br>robots so that's where you have a<br>surgeon sitting at a console<br>operating<br>robotic arms remotely and this is<br>certainly this has increased our<br>accuracy our vision and our precision<br>but I say robots and inverted commas<br>because there's actually no the<br>surgeon's still doing the whole<br>operation there's no input from an<br>autonomous self-regulating robot<br>and interestingly these these Master<br>Slave robot assisted systems haven't<br>actually shown a massive Improvement in<br>patient outcomes<br>and I wonder is that because they are<br>still human controlled is it because<br>they're prone to human error distraction<br>but we now we really have reached an<br>inflection point as we've already been<br>talking about in surgical robotic<br>technology<br>and I predict that we're probably going<br>to see within our lifetime I don't know<br>maybe maybe the 75th anniversary of USC<br>maybe the hundreds who knows but we will<br>see autonomous surgical robots operating<br>now as I said before prediction is<br>difficult and so I actually thought well<br>I'd better get a second opinion on this<br>I need someone else to tell me if this<br>is going to be right so I went to an<br>expert in the field a robot itself<br>I went to check GPT and this is what<br>it's said to me it was just interesting<br>it's quite a bit more circumspect than I<br>was isn't it and then so I thought I<br>actually thought well who else do you go<br>to or certainly my generation and many<br>in the audience if you need tick advice<br>you go to your teenage children don't<br>you<br>so I went to guess my teenager and I<br>showed him this from chat GPT I said<br>what do you think of this guess and he<br>just looked and said Dave<br>he said don't be silly that AI knows<br>damn well is going to be autonomous<br>robots it's going to steal your job but<br>but I guess the point I'm trying to get<br>out here and Terry's already alluded to<br>is that we we really we've all seen this<br>explosion in deep learning AI models and<br>it's a sort of a convergence of these<br>Technologies now with other things<br>you're going to see tonight with virtual<br>reality augmented reality Imaging and<br>immense processing power that means I<br>think it is feasible we're going to see<br>autonomous robots operation<br>there we go so so how do you actually<br>create a robot that can can actually<br>plan and perform surgery itself it seems<br>like an amazingly complex task doesn't<br>it and I guess it is<br>like many of these things you can break<br>it down to three basic steps sensing<br>processing and executing and if you look<br>at all those three areas<br>robots actually have some advantages<br>over humans all of them<br>human surgeons like Gary and I we sense<br>primarily with vision and touch and<br>robots can do both those but they can<br>also sense mass of other spectrums that<br>we just can't perceive things like<br>x-rays infrared and many many more<br>we now know that robots possess<br>processing power well in excess of<br>anything humans are capable of<br>I think it's over about five years now<br>since Alpha zero it was Google's Deep<br>Mind AI program<br>that taught itself to play chess from<br>scratch in less than four hours<br>and then beat the human world champion<br>so this is the processing power we're<br>dealing with<br>and finally executing<br>well really you're just mechanizing<br>surgical instruments many of which have<br>been around for hundreds of years that<br>robots can wield these with interest<br>precision<br>so robots don't have to do the whole<br>procedure there are levels of control<br>that they can have and it's probably<br>best understood I think in terms of<br>autonomy and self-driving cares<br>now I reckon quite a few of you here<br>tonight probably arrived in cars that<br>had some form of either partial or<br>conditional autonomy operating they<br>might have had Lane assist or cruise<br>control<br>If you're sort of like an orthopedic<br>surgeon like Gary you might have even<br>had a late model Tesla or something like<br>that<br>and that could have been in full<br>self-drive mode and that essentially is<br>is a highly or almost fully autonomous<br>robot that's monitoring and responding<br>to its environment so if you keep that<br>in mind we can have a look at what's<br>available at the moment in terms of<br>here we go so this here is one of the<br>the first robots or procedural robots in<br>the market that shows a degree of<br>partial autonomy so with all this<br>amazing cool technology available what<br>did we humans decide to treat what<br>life-threatening condition what horrible<br>cancer<br>you can actually see it was male pattern<br>books okay<br>so we worry about AI but I think we<br>should think a bit more about the<br>fragility to The Human Condition at<br>times but anyway if you see this robot<br>is actually deciding itself which years<br>to transplant and where to put them<br>but what I want you to look at in that<br>that video is actually that that head is<br>perfectly still okay in the robotic<br>technology we got at the moment is<br>really well suited to things that aren't<br>moving and a non-deformables tissues<br>like this in bone that Gary's going to<br>talk to you about in a minute are really<br>good but we as general surgeons we have<br>to deal with tissues that are moving or<br>are deformable and Squishy it's not like<br>we're not kind of like auto mechanics we<br>can't just turn the car off while we fix<br>it we have to do it while it's running<br>so one of the biggest challenges that we<br>Face operating the chest and the abdomen<br>is how you deal with these expanding<br>Contracting gurgling jiggling tissues<br>and try to get a robot to manage those<br>but it's a challenge we are rising to<br>this is a robot that is used to treat<br>cancer<br>so this robot employs pre-operative<br>Imaging to localize that lung tumor and<br>then through a variety of sensors<br>monitors the movement of that tumor to<br>in teaching machines to recognize soft<br>tissue Anatomy is something we've been<br>involved with here at UIC actually and<br>now I'm sorry Laura Lee said no<br>uncertain terms don't show any gory<br>pictures but I just this one was too<br>cool to leave out so if your squeamish<br>just look away<br>so this is gallbladder removal so you've<br>got to take the surgeon is to take out<br>the gallbladder and to do that he's got<br>to identify two critical structures to<br>divide them and safely remove it now<br>this can be actually quite tough even<br>for experienced surgeons<br>but with work we've been doing with<br>Medtronic here this has led to<br>development of this computer vision<br>algorithm<br>can actually clearly identify those<br>structures in real time for the surgeon<br>that they are there in green and blue<br>and I love this because we often we have<br>our students<br>observing us do these procedures and we<br>often joke with them when we're asking<br>about a nationally we're sort of saying<br>it wouldn't be nice if the anatomy was<br>color-coded like a textbooks and there<br>but the most sophisticated soft tissue<br>robot that is in existence at the moment<br>comes from the Johns Hopkins in the US<br>so one of the crucial bits of bowel<br>cancer surgery is once you've taken the<br>bowel out you've got to join those two<br>ends of our together and you've got to<br>do that accurately and precisely if you<br>don't there's catastrophic even fatal<br>consequences of a patient<br>so this robot can do just that itself it<br>can autonomously join two end bowel<br>together that video you see up there is<br>a robot planning<br>where it's going to put the stitches and<br>then executing that itself so this was<br>published in science robotics last year<br>with the impressive conclusion that the<br>robotic system could match the<br>performance of expert surgeons but also<br>show an elevated level of consistency<br>compared to human surgeons<br>so we're making some progress in these<br>technical challenges of automation<br>but I do wonder if it's the<br>non-technical things if it's the ethical<br>the legal and Regulatory practices that<br>are going to be more of a challenge for<br>us going forward<br>we're all aware and suse has already<br>alluded to it of the some concerns<br>around the rapid dissemination at AI<br>technology<br>and it's in its regulation and I think<br>Rishi sunec<br>soon to host a global AI safety Summit<br>people are likening to the original<br>atomic energy Summit in terms of<br>and look obviously safety's Paramount<br>and all robotic applications but in<br>surgery it's obviously got to be next<br>level if we go back to self-driving cars<br>we know that robots are fallible<br>and what happens if a surgical<br>autonomous robot does make a mistake<br>where does that liability sit<br>is it with the robot itself<br>with the manufacturer is it with the<br>doctor these are all questions we need<br>to ponder<br>and finally what about job security I<br>can I come back to what gas my teenager<br>said are the robots going to take over<br>altogether by the time we're celebrating<br>the 100th anniversary of the UAC<br>well I think in reality that's unlikely<br>but as autonomous surgical robots take a<br>greater role on surgery our role of<br>Surgeons is going to evolve more into<br>one of supervision and coordination<br>and yeah I do think robotic technology<br>has got its pitfalls but if we embrace<br>it correctly it can achieve our goals of<br>reducing variation<br>human era and improving patient outcomes<br>and who knows some even think that<br>robotic technology may be a solution to<br>the workforce problem with the Aging<br>population and potentially even the<br>democratization of surgery at a global<br>foreign<br>that was um really fascinating thank you<br>very much well Professor Gary Hooper is<br>the University of otago christchurch's<br>head of the Department of Orthopedics<br>and musculoskeletal medicine<br>he specializes in adult elective surgery<br>mostly joint replacement procedures it's<br>probably most families in town will have<br>had Gary operating on a member of their<br>family I'd imagine at some stage<br>he leads a very active research group<br>that focuses on outcomes following joint<br>Replacements and studies involving bone<br>metabolism and musculoskeletal<br>bioengineering he's also studying how to<br>improve healing rates following<br>fractures and as his investigations<br>includes a building and production of<br>cartilage scaffolds for the treatment of<br>articular cartilage defects and<br>developing titanium implants to fill<br>bone deficits his Department's<br>responsible for managing the New Zealand<br>joint registry the first registry to<br>generate long-term patient outcome<br>measures and Gary's been recognized<br>internationally for his excellence in<br>medical research as well as for being a<br>highly respected academic and a<br>dedicated teacher of undergrad and<br>post-grad Orthopedic trainees and has<br>therefore witnessed the latest high-tech<br>thanks very much Laura Lee Kiora and<br>we want to get rid of the orthopedic<br>surgeon<br>so perhaps our medical colleagues were<br>right when they compared us to<br>rhinoceride<br>little brain thick hide and charged too<br>much<br>at least that's what Tim was alluding to<br>but you all know that once you break<br>your bone you need a bone cut<br>if you develop osteoarthritis and you<br>joint wears out it gets creaky and sore<br>you need a bone Carpenter<br>there's no orthopedic surgeons your<br>go-to wearable Carpenters<br>very similar to our ordinary Carpenter<br>we have to be precise in the things<br>we've heard<br>we don't do much Dove and tailing in<br>Orthopedics but we do have to do<br>procedures where we have precise cuts on<br>bone to create the right outcome<br>you know it's just Carpenter here uses a<br>hammer well orthopedic surgeons are<br>going to arrangements as well<br>and has often been said that the heart<br>of the procedure the bigger the hammer<br>and so you can see that the surgeon<br>below has the four of hammers and<br>obviously that procedure was slightly<br>difficult<br>in<br>1963 Sir John Charlie developed the<br>total hip joint replacement<br>which has been a revolutionary outcome<br>for numerous people around the globe<br>that's been voted the most significant<br>operative surgery of the 20th century<br>and likely to the most significant<br>operative surgery of the 21st century<br>returns people to functional outcome and<br>because of this<br>joint replacement surgery but in all<br>countries all developed countries has<br>become an epidemic<br>we have an increasing aged population<br>but this increasing aged population<br>wants to do more than previous age<br>populations your great-grandmother was<br>quite happy at 65 sitting on the porch<br>in her armchair with a cat on a lap and<br>a cup of tea on a lap as well<br>but actually five-year-olds today want<br>to do this they want to get run on the<br>track they want to at least hike around<br>the great walks they want to get on<br>their bike and bike 20ks and to do this<br>we need to facilitate that with joint<br>I was not going to put many slides into<br>show results but this is just something<br>that I'd like to show you because this<br>is important this is total knee<br>replacement the results this is what we<br>call a survival curve so at year zero<br>one hundred percent of the joints<br>survive<br>and then when they by survival I mean<br>they don't require a further operation<br>and when they need a further operation<br>then they get taken off and so you can<br>see that there's a gradual loss of<br>patients who have not survived that is<br>the required a further operation because<br>their joint replacement has failed<br>but look at what the results are<br>so at 22 years 92 percent of those joint<br>Replacements survive so this tells me<br>that orthopedic surgeons in New Zealand<br>are doing good job you've got good<br>surgeons here that can do give you world<br>figures which are unbeatable in the rest<br>of the world so why do we need robots<br>why do we need<br>something else within the operative<br>Suite<br>there are two reasons why we should have<br>robots<br>the first is precision we can always<br>make our implant position better we can<br>always make our bone Cuts better Etc and<br>also soft tissue protection they're the<br>two most important things in Orthopedics<br>that we look at with regard to the use<br>when implants fail particularly total<br>knee Replacements when they fail they<br>often fail because of aseptic loosening<br>or infection aseptic loosing means that<br>the implant gets loose and has to be<br>replaced<br>often that loosen can be a result of<br>imprecise positioning of the implant<br>so we have developed a lot of robotic<br>surgery within Orthopedics it's not<br>quite as dramatic as the robotic surgery<br>that Tim showed you because he's working<br>with soft tissues all the time generally<br>we're working with bone all the time so<br>our bony Cuts have to be precise so I'll<br>take you through this this is a knee<br>replacement surgery here's the knee for<br>those that are interested and<br>surrounding it there are these arrays<br>which are attached to both the tibia and<br>the femur those are raised feed<br>information to computer screen so the<br>compute can tell you where that knee is<br>in space and what you're about to do and<br>that's then fed onto the screen the<br>surgeon can look at the screen look at<br>the image and say yes I want to make my<br>cut there and then wheel in the robotic<br>arm with the saw attached and the saw<br>does the cutting it presses the trigger<br>so he's involved yes and he makes the<br>cup<br>and these swords often have haptic<br>controls so they protect soft tissues as<br>well<br>that's pretty much the basis of what we<br>see when we're doing a robotic surgery<br>in Orthopedics<br>other advantages Tracy introduced a CT<br>scan earlier on well everything that the<br>Radiologists have introduced has pushed<br>for this type of uh uh<br>Orthopedic development and this here is<br>an island this is an IR which is a CT<br>scanner being wheeled into theater and a<br>patient who's had spinal surgery<br>the reason why it's been wheeled and so<br>they can identify where the implants<br>need to go within the spine and so the<br>idea of this is that a robotic arm then<br>wheeled into site was the isolated where<br>everything needs to go and that arm then<br>precisely puts screws and rods within<br>the spine these can be done through<br>stab incisions so no big large incision<br>in the spines required and end up with<br>results like that<br>so that's quite a dramatic procedure for<br>a patient who requires a spinal surgery<br>other advantages that we've had<br>particularly with our<br>uh is developing images which can then<br>be made into implants which can be<br>implanted into patients who have large<br>and significant defects so here we can<br>see a patient<br>good hip replacement on the right side<br>but there's nothing on the left side you<br>see the big hole there where there's<br>been considerable destruction secondary<br>to infection of this joint and one of<br>the ways of dealing with that is using a<br>CT scan to develop an image to develop a<br>model and then take that model to the<br>workshop and 3D print it and once you've<br>3D printed it insert it into the patient<br>in a precise manner<br>this technology has been available in<br>Christchurch for over two to three<br>decades and is something we do routinely<br>also the same can be said of tumors so<br>if you've got a big hole in the bone you<br>can fill that hole with a specially<br>there have been other advantage and this<br>is where I'd like to leave us with this<br>is called mixed reality in medicine<br>technology it's just not going to work<br>so here we go so we have special<br>goggles which will give us some sort of<br>holographic image and allow us to see<br>what's going on within the operating<br>room environment we can see there's been<br>a templated<br>uh uh pre-operative plan for surgery<br>the patient the the surgeon then can<br>look at where he wants to put the<br>implant in the shoulder this is a<br>shoulder joint and for those of you that<br>are a little squeamish you are going to<br>see some blood in the moment so just be<br>careful<br>and then once the implant has been<br>planned and everything looks<br>satisfactory and the surgeon's happy<br>with it<br>the surgeon who's in the back of the<br>audience today<br>is going to implant it by taking this<br>holographic image so you're going to<br>take a holographic image from the center<br>of the operating room move it across and<br>place it in the operative field to make<br>sure that he has everything precise and<br>that the uh the implant has been<br>inserted in the appropriate position and<br>the appropriate place in the shoulder<br>and I would like to introduce Nami here<br>who is from Striker and she's going to<br>give you a little demonstration of what<br>we can do with these holographic images<br>so you'll see that she's<br>being silly over there in the corner<br>and that's what it looks like a surgeon<br>who's out of control in the middle of<br>the operating room<br>so this is a surgical plan which is<br>based off a CT scan and the surgeon will<br>do the pre-planning on their software<br>and then they'll once it comes down to<br>operation time they'll load this onto<br>their<br>Hollow lenses Microsoft hello lenses so<br>they load them onto the lenses and they<br>get to wear these while they're<br>operating<br>so what it does is it increases the<br>incision<br>I'm an accuracy of the of the operation<br>this is the beginning of using this sort<br>of Technology with the lenses and no<br>doubt in a few years time these will<br>just be like sunglasses or something<br>like that that the surgeons can put on<br>in the operating theater but I'll show<br>you uh what we do we'll just started<br>doing this a little bit in Christchurch<br>recently<br>so we can press here start home View<br>see in front of me I've got a<br>known image so I can grab this image<br>Gary<br>and that into place so surgeons can do<br>this in real life in the operating<br>theater and you can see here for example<br>you've got the the<br>can you see that all right yeah there we<br>go<br>um<br>you've got the green can you run seen it<br>or<br>yep yep there we go and then that will<br>show the surgeon where they they need to<br>take their their cut with their saw<br>blade and so it increases the Precision<br>of their Cuts around the shoulder which<br>helps with the longevity of implants and<br>and outcomes<br>so<br>good okay thank you thank you so this<br>technology is<br>this technology is going to be available<br>at the end of the session if anyone<br>would like to come down and have a<br>thanks very much Gary gosh uh and Nami<br>that was a wonderful demonstration and<br>as Gary said you can come down perhaps<br>there might be a bit of time at the end<br>to come down have a wee go uh it's<br>incredible where it's all heading really<br>isn't it<br>well Professor Tim Woodfield he's a<br>professor of regenerative medicine in<br>the department of orthopedic surgery<br>musculoskeletal medicine the same<br>Department Gary heads uh Tim heads the<br>multi-award winning and internationally<br>respected Christchurch regenerative<br>medicine and tissue engineering group<br>called create<br>and as director of the University of<br>otago Center for bioengineering and nano<br>medicine<br>as research platform involves<br>development of Novel bio inks and<br>biorisms biofabrication spheroid<br>bioassembly and additive manufacturing<br>of medical devices applied to<br>regenerative Medicine of cartilage and<br>Bone and patients Advanced 3D in vitro<br>tissue culture models and high<br>throughput screening the team's Works<br>already benefiting New Zealand patients<br>as Gary said with biowinks and the 3D<br>Tech delivering bespoke Surgical<br>Solutions for patients with conflicts<br>fractures and as Gary just showed you<br>gaps in the bone<br>attempts published over 160<br>peer-reviewed Journal articles and<br>received numerous Awards and fellowships<br>and his work meetings at the very<br>Cutting Edge of advances in<br>um<br>it's fantastic to be able to talk to you<br>and uh it's nice that I'm up last<br>because uh what I'm going to be talking<br>about is um is really at the<br>intersection of all the different topics<br>we've talked a little bit about so<br>um what I'm going to be talking about is<br>the future of how we go about designing<br>different types of implants but it<br>involves a little bit robotics it<br>involves surgery it involves development<br>of implants but also convergence of<br>different types of Technologies to work<br>out how we can progress some of those<br>forward<br>and what you'll see is that actually the<br>future of where implants going isn't<br>necessarily going towards<br>methyl implants where the future is<br>going is towards towards ways of<br>regenerating some of these damaged<br>tissues<br>so what I am going to try to talk about<br>is is about getting personal so how do<br>we also then personalize everything that<br>we're doing about the development of<br>implants so it's just exactly for you<br>the patient<br>I'll be talking a little bit about um 3D<br>printing and in particular bioprinting<br>and so that's one of the Technologies<br>I'll be explaining today and essentially<br>what that is is a way of being a way of<br>being able to put down information or<br>put down layers of material in a layer<br>by layer fashion to create a really<br>so I wanted to start with one example so<br>as Gary mentioned hip replacement is is<br>one of the leading Technologies but um<br>we're 3D printing and in particular<br>there's convergence of both Imaging and<br>now also 3D printing has really exploded<br>and where we see some of the major<br>breakthroughs has been in the<br>development of custom implants and none<br>so more in this particular case so I'm<br>probably just going to give you a lot of<br>different examples and case studies<br>throughout this talk but this is a this<br>is a hip replacement and what you'll see<br>I'm sorry this is a pelvis and this is a<br>CT scan like um like Gary and also a<br>choice you've showed before a CT scan of<br>a hip and this is important because what<br>you'll see is there's a large red area<br>and that large red area is important<br>because that's actually identified as a<br>region that needs to be removed because<br>of a large tumor so this large lump here<br>is a large tumor that's sitting in this<br>in this pelvis<br>so actually the outcome for this patient<br>you can imagine if you have this large<br>amount of bone removed from the pelvis<br>the outcome for this patient was<br>actually full amputation<br>because there's there's no bone<br>remaining so this is one example where<br>3D printing so taking the Imaging<br>platforms are Imaging the patient<br>information being able to then look at<br>3D planting and in this case using high<br>energy laser melting of titanium powder<br>to create<br>an anatomical shape of the patient's<br>pelvis so you'll see that there's a<br>large component here which is accepting<br>the<br>the hip component and then<br>reconstruction of the remaining parts of<br>the hip out of titanium and screw<br>fixation which can all be pre-planned in<br>the surgery so this is this convergence<br>of how we can take Imaging of the<br>patient then able to 3D print a<br>patient's specific implant<br>which provides the anatomical shape so<br>it's exactly matched to that patient<br>and then the outcome is that this<br>patient underwent essentially a standard<br>hip replacement surgery so the outcome<br>is now taking this patient from a full<br>amputation of the limb to then<br>essentially the same recovery as anyone<br>that would undergo a full standard hip<br>replacement<br>so this is where the technology is<br>actually starting to make Major Impact<br>the key for this is that of course these<br>surgeries go faster in terms of how we<br>would like our surgeries to go so it's<br>there's a major cost savings and<br>improvements in terms of how we're able<br>to go about<br>3D printing<br>but as Gary mentioned before you know<br>you know there's there's a burgeoning<br>number of cases that we're trying to<br>have to deal with and again if we try to<br>have a bit of a look at some of those<br>facts and figures again you could try to<br>look at Michelangelo's David in the 21st<br>century there's a number of different<br>regions we've obviously got aging<br>population but we've got um yeah<br>increasing factors such as obesity and<br>putting greater demands on all of our<br>joints and as Gary mentioned we have<br>this epidemic and degenerative joint<br>disease so if we look at some of the<br>numbers of implants that potentially<br>need to go in before 2030 a bit under<br>300 here in New Zealand a little bit<br>under 700 increase in in the United<br>States and so the numbers of surgeries<br>and the types of implants are going in<br>is dramatically going to increase but<br>also that means the the numbers of<br>failures or the greater number of<br>problems that we'll see<br>I'll put up just some other little facts<br>and figures here and the point here<br>isn't to look at this in a lot of detail<br>but what this is trying to put into<br>bands and this comes from the New<br>Zealand national joint registry is<br>actually the cause for knee revision so<br>the reasons when a knee implant might go<br>wrong what are some of the causes of<br>that<br>and there's a number of different<br>reasons that we can have wear and other<br>bits and pieces like this but the big<br>red bars are the main one that seem to<br>be increasing over time so between 1999<br>and now all the way up to 2013<br>the bars and the red section are getting<br>bigger and bigger and<br>um I can tell you that the red bars<br>represent infection<br>so infection is now becoming a big issue<br>in terms of why some of these different<br>types of implants fail so less about the<br>implant but more of an issue around<br>infection<br>so what I've mentioned to you before is<br>that we're trying to make these<br>personalized implants and we've made<br>them personalized so far by 3D printing<br>them in titanium and that gives them a<br>specific shape just for the patient<br>but in the future we want to ask we want<br>smarter implants we want we don't want<br>just the shape we want more than just<br>shape<br>so what we want is we want personalized<br>shape but also personalized bioactivity<br>and I'll give you some examples of what<br>I mean by bioactivity<br>so here we have we might have our 3D<br>printed implant<br>but one thing we can try to address is<br>in infection control so what can we add<br>to that implant so for example can we<br>have some sort of gel which incorporates<br>an antibiotic or some sort of biofilm<br>inhibitor that can be released to<br>basically mean that that implant won't<br>become infected in the future<br>other types of things particularly for<br>oncology cases so cancer cases<br>revascularization and bone growth into<br>these um in patients that have had<br>chemotherapy or radiotherapy is really<br>compromised so what can we add onto<br>these Orthopedic implants so for example<br>in terms of also a gel or certain cells<br>that would stimulate blood vessels to<br>start to grow and allow that implant to<br>really integrate into bone<br>so that's a whole new future field<br>one area where we're seeing Ai and also<br>other areas of computational modeling is<br>around trying to also predict the<br>loading so here we're talking about<br>particular types of implants where we<br>can make structures which are porous and<br>which match the patient's own bone so<br>for example we could take 120 kilogram<br>rugby player and design an implant that<br>not only matches the shape that we're<br>trying to fix but then also the loading<br>microenvironment because all of our<br>tissues respond to load so if you jump<br>up and down or you go up into space then<br>your bone density will change<br>so the idea is that we can personalize<br>each of our implants not just to shape<br>but also to the loading that starts to<br>go through it so if we've got an 80 year<br>old female patient that you know that<br>might have a fractured neck of femur or<br>something like this we can start to look<br>at designing an implant that's going to<br>match that 80 year old female patient<br>for example not 120 kg rugby player for<br>example so these are the ways that we<br>can start to tailor not only just the<br>I'm going to shift gears a little bit<br>now but the idea is that what I've<br>talked about is printing titanium so<br>permanent materials<br>what our group is focusing on is in<br>regenerative medicine so this is<br>actually trying to use the body's own<br>regenerative capacity to look at ways of<br>repairing some of these damaged tissues<br>or joints so what include what it<br>basically involves is taking patient<br>cells which are responsible for making<br>new types of tissue and if we can put<br>those cells in the right environment<br>those cells will want to try to make<br>tissue so for example we might have<br>cells that make cartilage or cells that<br>make bone or cells that make blood<br>vessels<br>the trick is is that the cells need to<br>be in the right micro environment and<br>the right Organization for them to<br>so this is basically the field of<br>regenerative medicine so it's the<br>science of trying to combine cells so<br>stem cell biology them with<br>printing or bioprinting Technologies to<br>develop complex tissues<br>so this is a vision for how we might go<br>about printing cartilage and Bone<br>so this might be a surgery here we've<br>got a large defect in the knee<br>you can then use MRI or CT Imaging to<br>get a really good image of exactly what<br>that defect might look in the knee<br>you can then send that information to<br>our 3D bioprinter which could be sitting<br>in the surgery or adjacent to surgery<br>and then allow that 3D printer to be<br>able to fabricate a specific implant<br>right there and there in surgery<br>what these 3D buyer printers are<br>designed like is that there were a<br>number of different bio inks so just<br>like you have your printer that might<br>have different color inks we can have<br>different bio inks so each different bio<br>ink for example here could contain stem<br>cells which are primed to differentiate<br>into bone and then you print those bone<br>layers<br>subsequently you can then print layers<br>of cartilage which are a different type<br>of cell that give that lovely smooth<br>articulating cartilage on the top and<br>that can be then reimplanted back into<br>the patient<br>so this is the patient's own cells the<br>patient's own living tissue which will<br>then form part of a regenerative<br>capacity so at this stage we wouldn't<br>necessarily need a titanium implant in<br>the future because you're regenerating<br>so what we need to make these<br>bioprinters work is that our buyer<br>printers are the amazing machines<br>they're kind of like Ferraris but what<br>we've been doing in bioprinting in the<br>field so far is we've been taking a<br>little two-stroke lawnmower engine and<br>trying to put it into these machines<br>because these machines need bio inks to<br>run and so what we need is we need the<br>Ferrari of all of our bio inks to go<br>with the Ferrari of all of these um<br>bioprinters and so what I mean by bio<br>ink is essentially it's a material that<br>you can put cells into and print and the<br>cells remain viable<br>so these have to be materials that are<br>essentially a hydrogel or sort of<br>tissue-like material that works at 37<br>degrees the cells remain happy but it's<br>most importantly an environment where<br>the cells can then actually start making<br>so it's this compromise in terms of<br>having an environment and this is where<br>sort of our science goes into the<br>biomaterial science or how we design<br>these bio inks to make themselves<br>so one of the types of materials that<br>we're using is that we're trying to use<br>light as a way to try and engineer these<br>bio inks which are primarily made of<br>gelatin which is sort of another form of<br>collagen which is what makes up most of<br>the tissues in our body<br>some of you might work with gelatin of<br>course if you heat it up it um it<br>dissolves<br>um and our body at 37 degrees we don't<br>really want different types of Bio inks<br>that are sitting there that might go all<br>soft so we use some clever chemistry to<br>try to situate light or cross-link these<br>types of materials and what you'll see<br>is essentially the the material at 37<br>degrees it has been cross-linked with<br>light remains whereas other ones don't<br>so essentially what that means is that<br>we can now put cells into this hydrogel<br>gelatin material we can cross-link it<br>with light and we can implant it and it<br>will remain it'll it'll have its nice<br>stable properties which is what we<br>really want<br>basically what we've been able to do is<br>apply this sort of Ferrari of platforms<br>to a range of different ways of doing<br>Printing and create important structures<br>which allow us to then fabricate really<br>nice Fidelity features and allow us to<br>place cells exactly where we'd like to<br>be able to go<br>so some of the things we've tried to<br>develop just like the video I showed you<br>before so this is actual tissue so this<br>is actually cartridge tissue that's<br>formed in one of the cartilage by inks<br>that we've fabricated and we've been<br>able to layer that down in different<br>types of layers this thing shows the red<br>stuff is actually new bone formation so<br>calcified<br>mineralized bone so we can able to print<br>a bone bio ink and this is a vascular<br>Network formation that's been able to<br>form in a vascular biotic so we're<br>starting to combine all the things that<br>we need for vascularized bone and then<br>also cartilage into lots of different<br>layers<br>so what does this mean is it means that<br>we can make these personalized and quite<br>bioactive implants<br>but what it also means is that we can<br>try to take things in terms of what<br>we've done in terms of translational<br>sorry traditional medicine where we do<br>some basic research and we apply it sort<br>of in one cohort in one clinical study<br>but because we've got these robotic ways<br>of of fabricating lots of little tissues<br>and elaborate lab environment even if<br>we're not making implants is that we<br>would really like to apply these<br>Technologies to also personalize it<br>towards a patient so we can also<br>pre-screen whether a patient's cells are<br>going to be good or again what type of<br>Bio Inc is going to provide them with<br>exactly the right micro environment or<br>again we can look at different um<br>ethnicities sex age related factors and<br>really incorporate all of those things<br>into the design of our implants and<br>that's where we can also use machine<br>learning and AI to start to combine all<br>um<br>one way that we can make things very<br>personalized and one example that I just<br>wanted to try to show you about was<br>around fat grafting so this is where we<br>can take um graft tissue from the<br>patient and relocate it back and and<br>autograph the grafting is a very common<br>procedure used in surgery<br>and this is particularly important if we<br>wanted to look at that grafting or<br>reconstruction and plastic and<br>reconstructive surgery following<br>mastectomy or patients that have had<br>breast cancer<br>and I wanted to try and show this<br>because we make this very personalized<br>in the fact that this is tissue that has<br>come from the same patient so it's often<br>lipospirate tissue and we want to try to<br>use it to try to reconstruct damaged or<br>diseased tissue or to reconstruct shape<br>following mastectomy or surgery to have<br>tumors removed<br>and one of the main problems when we<br>look at grafting tissue is it doesn't<br>always remain or it doesn't keep its<br>structure and so what we're doing here<br>in a personalized way is that we're able<br>to use the same light technology to<br>improve the structural stability of the<br>Lipo esperate before it's injected and<br>the impact of that now means is that we<br>can have the surgeon can have better<br>control exactly where they're able to<br>lay down these layers of of Adipose or<br>liposporate tissue<br>and the the benefit for for the patient<br>or um these breast cancer patients is<br>often this procedure requires four or<br>five or six surgeries<br>and if we can get better stability then<br>we can potentially remove or<br>significantly reduce the number of<br>surgeries so this is this nice<br>combination between how we can control<br>the type of tissue specific for that<br>patient and understand how we can<br>improve outcomes to make sure that we<br>can end up with a great reconstructive<br>solution<br>my very very last slide really is just<br>to sort of say on this campus we have<br>this really amazing environment where we<br>can work obviously carefully with<br>directly with surgeons but also with a<br>number of different technologists as<br>well as bio<br>and it's really important as we're<br>growing these new technologies that<br>we're also able to train and advance and<br>bring all of these amazing different<br>multi-disciplinary fields and also<br>researchers and clinicians all together<br>so<br>that's in my talk and I'd like to thank<br>you very much<br>gosh hey a lot to think about uh now<br>Alex here is going to um<br>she's got a microphone and any questions<br>she can Dash the microphone to you to<br>ask of the guys up here has anyone got a<br>burning question to start with good<br>about it<br>just to follow on from the last speaker<br>how long would it take to grow one of<br>those bio link implants<br>um thanks for the question<br>um<br>if we would like to grow a tissue sorry<br>I'll stand up then I can see um if we<br>would like to grow a tissue in a lab and<br>then implant it it can take a matter of<br>weeks up to months<br>um what we would like to do or the<br>strategy I was trying to show you is<br>that we can do the surgery or do we do<br>the approach or if we're able to print<br>we can print in surgery and essentially<br>all of the tissue maturation and growth<br>happens in the body so the body is the<br>best incubator the best bioreactor<br>available so our job as tissue Engineers<br>is to make sure that all the cells are<br>happy and that they're protected and<br>they're not going to get damaged again<br>when when orthopedic surgeon is also out<br>with his hammer um placing it placing it<br>in but mostly because of the patient<br>we'd like the patient up and walking<br>around and putting load loads through it<br>so that that's our strategy there's lots<br>of different ways of doing it but the<br>idea is that that implant could go in<br>and then gradually over maybe six months<br>to a year the materials that are used to<br>house or support all of that will all<br>degrade away while the new tissue is all<br>going in so um that's that's the main<br>goal is to try to keep the length of<br>time that you're actually making it to<br>the to a real minimum<br>good<br>thank you a question of the balance<br>between technology and immorality or<br>ethics so how to keep our morality and<br>the knowledge of ourselves<br>involving upgrading faster enough to<br>cope with the development faster<br>development of Technology two examples I<br>heard that correct me if I'm wrong I<br>heard that the Australia indigenous<br>people they can they call strong GPS in<br>in the brain and very skillful at the<br>know the Medical<br>function of the plant meanwhile they<br>think the the female in during the<br>period is contagiously dirty<br>another example is that if we can help<br>the personalized understanding of<br>individual health monitor stuff like<br>that at individual level do we still<br>need the policy to<br>distinguish patient according to their<br>group<br>at a group level okay so very simply<br>the morality and the technology<br>thanks very much for that there was a<br>fairly detailed question but I think the<br>the issue of integrating artificial<br>intelligence into society really is a<br>massive moral question and I<br>I don't think I can answer it for you to<br>be honest here tonight but I think we<br>have to be cognizant of both the<br>advantages and the disadvantages of<br>artificial intelligence and we do have<br>to be nimble and agile with our<br>regulatory processes so they can keep up<br>with it basically and as I alluded to in<br>my talk I think Society is starting to<br>appreciate that and you know I I think<br>if you look at AI across the health<br>system<br>it is going to it is going to gain pace<br>and I saw a really good graphic the<br>other day which basically looked at what<br>was where it was predicted that AI would<br>affect you from basically the Cradle to<br>the Grave and it was in nearly every<br>aspect of the patient care it's it's<br>looking at you know data science<br>modeling that's looking at Diagnostics<br>looking at Therapeutics we've dealt with<br>tonight so it's not something we can<br>ignore you're absolutely right we need<br>to address the moral issues around it<br>but I think as a society we are starting<br>to to realize that in the summit I<br>talked about and my Talk's a good<br>I think we can expand it a little bit<br>from there because it's the morality and<br>the ethics around stem cell harvesting<br>and stem cell use also of tissue<br>engineering is an important discussion<br>topic Tim and you're<br>you might like to talk on that briefly I<br>can talk briefly obviously there's a<br>range of different cell sources we can<br>we can um<br>we can utilize and again some of those<br>can be from the patient some of them can<br>be from donor patients so the question<br>is you know again also for different<br>ethnicities and beliefs and cultures<br>um you know we want to be developing<br>technologies that are available for all<br>that's the whole idea around sort of<br>personalized medicine and our question<br>is well well what works for who what<br>works for which cohort or patient um<br>that's where again a lot of those<br>co-development things need to be need to<br>be well considered so<br>um yes I think it's really important and<br>I think again with the development of a<br>lot of these really new technologies is<br>that the the regulations or potentially<br>the the ethical<br>considerations don't always or you're<br>trying to essentially develop them at<br>the same time as the Technologies and so<br>this is something we also have to<br>carefully balance that sometimes<br>Technologies are jumping ahead of ahead<br>of the discussions and and so that's<br>what's important in society I think also<br>is to make sure like Tim was saying we<br>have we have those discussions and that<br>we're aware of them and keep constantly<br>pushing forward to make sure that it<br>again we're not developing Technologies<br>without full consideration but that<br>we're then also not styming or you know<br>um<br>stopping Innovation so again it's this<br>it's this um yeah delicate balance<br>that's<br>okay<br>thank you to all of you it's been<br>incredibly interesting uh just some<br>thoughts or a question around the<br>regenerative medicine side of things do<br>you envision a time in the future where<br>we will be printing whole personalized<br>organs and what does that mean for the<br>likes of organ donation is it going to<br>um no thanks I think it's a really<br>interesting question<br>um organs is a difficult one at this<br>stage what we're what we're able to do<br>clinically and again when I say we I<br>mean the entire field internationally<br>there's a large number of groups<br>focusing regenerative medicine are able<br>to make smaller sections of tissue so<br>sort of on the centimeter scale I think<br>when um bioprinting and things first hit<br>the scene they are actually already<br>predicting by by 2020 would be able to<br>buy a print organs and it's extremely<br>challenging again there's a very very<br>large complex<br>multicellular systems highly<br>visceralized in the scale of when I say<br>scale actually the small scale of things<br>like microvasculature that's required is<br>is<br>Monumental so it's a huge engineering<br>task basically that's a long-winded way<br>to say um<br>I personally feel that that regenerative<br>Medicine of organs will be will be a<br>massive challenge<br>um that's not to say that I don't think<br>that we will address it but I think it's<br>a long way away<br>um and we need to you know we can really<br>focus on some of the the slightly<br>earlier wins to really Drive where the<br>technology is able to try to go but um<br>absolutely it could be one of those ones<br>where we're able to repair small<br>sections of organs or against small<br>sections of heart tissue so for example<br>if an effect infected tissue we might be<br>able to repair that small little section<br>that's been damaged you know those are<br>the things where I think there's huge<br>opportunities<br>um but yeah I'll keep my fingers crossed<br>but possibly not well possibly not in my<br>lifetime but uh yeah it would be amazing<br>if we could<br>I wonder um if it's possible to<br>to flect on how we might mitigate any<br>unintended harms and that gap between<br>what can be done and what should be done<br>thinking in in surgery so we don't see<br>another pelvic mesh problem and with<br>imaging we know the more detailed and<br>and intensive we can get with our<br>Imaging we risk finding incidental<br>illness and you're probably familiar<br>with the acronym vomit victim of medical<br>information technology how do we how do<br>we mitigate that with our Rush forward<br>okay<br>that's a pertinent question because<br>Technologies are evolving and we need to<br>monitor them<br>and so the way particularly with joint<br>replacement surgery that's really what<br>I'm talking about because that's my gig<br>basically<br>we monitor that with our registry in New<br>Zealand where we we take every single<br>joint that's done in New Zealand it gets<br>registered and it gets followed so I<br>think having Registries to follow what's<br>happening with these new technologies is<br>important<br>if we see a problem then we can react<br>rapidly with those registries<br>that's doesn't mitigate<br>the people that may have problems from<br>that technology that you know that<br>happened early on so<br>unfortunately that's part of the price<br>we pay for new technologies and we<br>really only know the value of them and<br>thanks to the question<br>um on the on the Imaging side I mean<br>with new Imaging Technologies and more<br>sensitive Tech Imaging Technologies<br>I mean I think we have these<br>conversations all the time within our<br>group<br>um a you're completely correct and then<br>we can pick up new things I mean when<br>it's in when it's a new Imaging<br>technique our first question is what in<br>the world is this is this is this<br>actually real or is this an artifact a<br>technique<br>and there's a fair amount of trying to<br>sort out which of those it is<br>um once once you're beyond that and we<br>have enough you know evidence and<br>knowledge to suggest maybe this is<br>something incidental maybe this is<br>something that needs to be fold<br>clinically<br>then obviously we have conversations<br>with clinical colleagues but it's still<br>not a uh<br>especially the new techniques it's not a<br>very black and white answer<br>and again I'm I'm unable to give you a<br>wonderful answer about what we're doing<br>about it but it certainly is an issue<br>and we certainly talking about talking<br>of those uh ethical issues about we can<br>should we or<br>if we are unable in the future to do it<br>is it morally right that's all the<br>questions and of course there's<br>affordability as I mentioned earlier we<br>in New Zealand will we get this when<br>will we get this how far behind other<br>countries a lot of what the the guys<br>have spoken about today particularly<br>with some of the surgical stuff and the<br>implants and the bioprinting it's<br>happening now isn't it in hospitals in<br>Christchurch a lot of this so it's<br>futuristic but it's actually future now<br>some of it so it's it's very exciting<br>um all right um as I said the the guys<br>will be down here and Nami and the<br>headset will be down here for a little<br>bit afterwards but basically<br>go safely and have safe travels home and<br>thank you all very much for coming</p></main><footer
