with a short description of<br>the Mahi that I do how we go about<br>it and this idea that I talk about as a<br>c-a a scholar as a professor of<br>indigenous<br>well-being so firstly it's the<br>understanding of Ky Norway so who are<br>you and where do you come from to firmly<br>situate yourself within the uniqueness<br>of your indigeny within Al and Al<br>secondly the values that guide who I am<br>as a human and as a scholar tonight I'll<br>mainly focus on the the notion<br>of with one definition of from the<br>Williams dictionary as the evidence of<br>greatness thirdly the lane that we are<br>in our disciplinary Focus for me applied<br>whole water or mildy physical education<br>and health I developed this early in my<br>career it is my business as usual it's<br>the grounding and the theoretical work<br>that I do as a mai scholar and that is<br>the application<br>ofi and coop mildi for Modi order<br>flourishing Wellness of mildi<br>communities fourthly the<br>transformational aspect of research it<br>isn't just doing Mahi for Mahi sake it<br>is to seek positive outcomes foro Hau<br>iwi and M communities I am a<br>contemporary of many many Copa Mai<br>Scholars who fought and struggled for<br>the normalization of copopa mity<br>research and I pay homage to them as a<br>copopa mity professor<br>my role as an academic is to serve our<br>communities to bring the Next Generation<br>with me to ensure that they remain<br>whole as we are critics and conscience<br>of M society and in doing so we are<br>advancing the<br>communities the beginning title of my<br>co-ho tonight is a phrase that our<br>ancestor p alha<br>uttered in the arbitration court on the<br>18th of July<br>1863 it is a speech recorded in the M<br>language newspapers at the time he was<br>asserting<br>his as theang or Paramount<br>Chief in the northern wide or District<br>this particular case was in relation to<br>the northern wide or river our hoo of<br>the day and our our boundaries therein<br>he concluded that the Hau boundaries<br>sign the Declaration of Independence of<br>1835 the precursor<br>toi and it was his son a few years later<br>who<br>sign fast forward six generations to me<br>seven generations to Charlie and ho<br>water and here we are tonight 160 years<br>later almost to the day with me a direct<br>descendant with alfano and all of you<br>here tonight delivering an inaugural<br>cool with future proofing contracts that<br>affirm mana<br>and as a foundation for flourishing<br>Wellness as I look back on my career it<br>is perhaps not surprising then as an Udi<br>a descendant that this notion of tinaa<br>has been the Common Thread as my<br>students know and they get sick of me<br>saying the<br>akam what is the common thread or the<br>thesis the<br>akamatwa and so the AK<br>I will unfold tonight is threefold<br>firstly that is the ultimate power and<br>authority the M of the the chief over<br>that which is of importance both the<br>is<br>secondly has practical applications the<br>main purpose of this practical<br>application is the maintenance of<br>and thirdly the goal of Tina is<br>flourishing Wellness for the collective<br>I draw upon my career-long studies of<br>the<br>texts the scholarship of Northern<br>Scholars such as Reverend Mar<br>maen<br>a my own it all the writings of Al<br>definitions<br>from Williams dictionary Mahi with my<br>Hau and ewi from across the Motu<br>the zaka mat has provided the cop up of<br>the purpose the why and the Mahi that I<br>do and that our teams do and that we are<br>of it has provided the intentionality of<br>the<br>coopa this first component of my that is<br>the ultimate power and authority of the<br>over that which is of importance<br>including both the seen and the Unseen<br>this ultimate power is Mana the Williams<br>dictionary defines Mana as Authority<br>control influence Prestige power psychic<br>Force effective binding authoritative<br>and others tonight I'll expand upon the<br>psychic Force the spiritual aspects of<br>Mana as you've seen tonight which is<br>imbued within the from man Mana derived<br>from the spirit realm Manata Mana<br>derived from people manaa Mana derived<br>from the land Manana Mana derived from<br>our ocean and our waterways we uplift<br>our Mana through<br>our our M our way of life we honor our<br>dead our marer let me share some<br>examples so I'm PR preparing for this<br>cohost tonight I was remembering<br>reflecting on just over 10 years ago or<br>so as I was leading into graduation with<br>my PhD so often as we do I return home<br>to Northland to visit the udupa the<br>cemetry so here I was my cousin Harley<br>and I and he's and the nieces and<br>nephews roaming around uh in the<br>cemetery we were taking photos of me in<br>my regalia like this one like this one<br>right here of my regalia I was business<br>up top borrowed red bands down the<br>bottom celebrating with my T inner our<br>grand urance this achievement when I was<br>returning my regalia and engaging in<br>some friendly chitchat with the lovely<br>lady from graduate woman about the<br>regalia about about graduation and being<br>in Northland last week blah blah blah<br>what I didn't realize is that regalia AR<br>actually meant to leave<br>denan like oh yes yes no no no it was a<br>flying trip oh no no definitely didn't<br>take the regalia no no y y yes yeah an<br>honest<br>mistake now this psychic force or the<br>spiritual aspects of manner of authority<br>is perhaps the most challenging aspect<br>for a person outside of our culture to<br>understand so for us it's the most<br>important it's the grounding of who we<br>are and I was a reminded of this a<br>couple of weeks ago when I returned back<br>from a trip I've been on to Northland<br>one of my nonod colleagues asked how my<br>trip was and I was sharing and I was<br>sharing he started laughing and he said<br>well my work and family trips don't<br>normally include visiting<br>cemeteries and I was sort of struck by<br>this admission and I thought yes it must<br>seem quite odd in the mainstream<br>workplace but within T moldi it's very<br>normal and I wrote in a book a wonderful<br>collaboration Leed by Jinta M describing<br>the many trips mom would take us on<br>driving in the cover of Darkness from<br>Southland to<br>Northland for tongy we'd be dragged<br>around UD<br>as kids in the stinking hot Northland<br>Sun so this most recent trip I AO coopa<br>and some Mahi coopa as well I got to<br>come and support my auntie in aano on a<br>beautiful weaving coopa celebrating<br>TOA I visited and sat with some of our<br>iwi and our Hau visited many udupa<br>across the north finishing at this site<br>where our parents lie I heard and I felt<br>the stories of our people I saw what<br>flourishing Wellness is as AO as a hoo I<br>saw the practice of our Arts of weaving<br>a quar footy game rural rugby at its<br>finest as Coastal communities I saw the<br>impacts of climate change of burial<br>grounds underwater at the high tide I<br>heard and I saw our real the the live<br>practice of our TI the spiritual aspects<br>of our Mana intact and flourishing I was<br>reminded that we are a living breathing<br>PE adapting people who are constantly<br>evolving we are not a culture to be left<br>as relics in the<br>museum is the ultimate power and<br>authority the mner of the dang's head of<br>the chief over that which is of<br>importance the seen and the Unseen the<br>highest order of this Authority is<br>deeply spiritual my second contention is<br>that Tang has practical applications of<br>course I've got a very strong mildy<br>physical education and health<br>backgrounds we learn through<br>doing one of the main purposes of this<br>practical application is the maintenance<br>of Modi this is seen in our contribution<br>to the advancement of the copopa Mali<br>research agenda as copopa Scholars we<br>have an intentional commitment to the<br>copy research agenda to the role of<br>research and contributing to the Tina of<br>Alano Hui and M

till<br>church a cop up with M research and<br>teaching teaching Excellence I<br>co-created as I've said with an aim to<br>uplift the hopes and aspirations of<br>mildy communities for Modi order in a<br>paper I wrote in 215 I said what I've<br>come to understand more as I engage with<br>the Landscapes and Waters of our<br>communities is that we are supporting<br>the various Co when we're supporting the<br>various copopa a small piece of us and<br>Alo are LIF here this is the Modi that<br>binds<br>us it is the intangible nature of our<br>existence that can only be felt and<br>experienced when we are in place it's<br>also about thinking about who's next<br>whether it's alfano generations to come<br>students we teach and supervise or the<br>next generation of community members who<br>will continually guide us infinite<br>possibilities exist within our<br>communities and with each other and part<br>of the joy of life is to realize<br>them this year with Co

two years in<br>operation as one of the 10 National<br>centers our<br>vision is Modi order of coastal<br>communities our values our M and kakit<br>Tanga establishing a new core is my<br>wonderful colleagues from our core who<br>are here and my our co-directors<br>professor Chris hurn Professor Rose<br>Richards aai Ury AJ Woodhouse and hero<br>and we know we couldn't get things done<br>without the Mah that AJ does Brendan<br>fler poto Kaki coopa Danny po our<br>Deputy uh lead as well pry Daniel<br>Pritchard and I can see also our number<br>of our Edmund sta down the B and many of<br>our researchers Kim theme leaders Sally<br>I can see many of you um gu in the back<br>we establishing a new core has it's been<br>hard it's it's it's a big co-a<br>establishing a core and it's been I'm<br>just so proud of our core I'm so proud<br>to be one of the leaders of our core<br>alongside my two mates we have the<br>potential to make a significant social<br>to make a significant impact socially<br>economically culturally and<br>environmentally for our Coastal<br>communities whilst also growing the<br>people who undertake the<br>work from 2025 our core rebalances<br>towards well-being and we answer new<br>questions such as what is flourishing<br>Wellness for Coastal communities how do<br>we connect to understand and restore the<br>mody order of coastal communities how do<br>we monitor the Modi of coastal<br>communities can we assess changes in<br>Modi of coastal communities due to<br>increased extreme weather events for<br>example what is the workforce that's<br>required to answer these<br>questions I want to also acknowledge our<br>board the work of our DVC RNE Professor<br>Richard Blakey who is here tonight as<br>well as a part of our board and Ty Mark<br>Solomon it's a real pleasure to be able<br>to work alongside T mark is one of our<br>foremost leaders and the work as our<br>board chair on Coastal peoples as well<br>these three examples that I've shared<br>are part of our commitment to the copopa<br>mildi research agenda<br>highlights the role of research and<br>enhancing the of<br>ALU and our M communities this leads me<br>to my third and final argument and we're<br>not far off Foo and that the goal of<br>T is flourishing Wellness for the<br>collective where our taga is intact with<br>our ultimate power and authority aor<br>over that which is of importance both<br>the seen and the Unseen to us where we<br>are in tune with the psychic elements of<br>Manor where we have the ability to<br>maintain the Modi of our world and<br>Advance the cop up a Modi agenda then<br>the outcome is Modi order or flourishing<br>collective is the foundation for<br>flourishing<br>Wellness without it we are a shadow of<br>who we are we remain dispossessed of<br>language our customs of land aapu our<br>health outcomes for our people those<br>things that make us uniquely us we<br>continue to be over represented in<br>negative statistics we continue to buy<br>into systems that do not serve us we<br>continue to take on the belief of the<br>other as our own and we start to wield<br>its power to the detriment of our people<br>our m our W and our Modi is eaten<br>away as Copa Scholars we must situate<br>the agenda front and center of our minds<br>and of our hearts we must be disciplined<br>intentional and persistent<br>reality is our Norm it is our business<br>as usual our<br>baau this means we live life with our<br>Mana flourishing our WI a whole Modi<br>flourishing people and places we live<br>freely without restraint we have a lot<br>of fun get up to a lot of Mischief our<br>co-a is uplifted it's inclusive for<br>everyone and it's pure joy like<br>tonight is not something to be afraid of<br>we must let go of the shackels of power<br>of Oppression through our own<br>conscientization<br>is the foundation of flourishing<br>Wellness<br>w<br>KS<br>naughty I I'll definitely turn the mic<br>off for<br>you<br>for<br>fore<br>you<br>well who drew the Short Straw to follow<br>that<br>acto I've worked alongside amarie and<br>followed behind her more recent times<br>since she was a 17y old as she said<br>before she arguably has given me my<br>first gray<br>hairs she definitely has given me the<br>laughter lines around my face which I<br>like to call them laugh<br>lines and um and she's a it's been a joy<br>and privilege to be here today to<br>celebrate her promotion to professor and<br>believe me it has been some Journey as<br>she's alluded<br>to my my role in these proceedings is to<br>thank Emory for providing an overview of<br>her akam or common thread thesis<br>of a work so far but before doing so I<br>would like to acknowledge amory's<br>parents Dave and CIS who set a platform<br>for her many<br>achievements there is no doubt that<br>amarie and Samantha have realized Dave's<br>goal of getting her girls a good<br>education as for sis what a what a waren<br>tour her influence and her quiet<br>determination is evident all around us<br>especially so in amar's drive to<br>indigenize the<br>academy this is apparent in many Realms<br>none more so than with the recent<br>establishment of Tonga Center of<br>indigenous<br>science this achievement has been a<br>decade in the making and apply<br>illustrates Amar Mahi because it's an<br>application<br>ofi<br>terangi and cop UPA Mai for moldi Aura<br>of Mai<br>communities but amory's dve to<br>indigenize the academy also requires the<br>support and work of many she's<br>acknowledged many of you tonight so I'd<br>also like to extend my thanks to nahu<br>isman Fina the the farel of to uru marai<br>and our local Mari communities for their<br>longstanding and ongoing relationships<br>with amarie hero and with our<br>students for those who know Amar Mahi<br>it's very clear that there's a real<br>intentionality in what she does and this<br>was Illustrated in her lecture<br>tonight as she said it is the aramat<br>that provides the Copa the purpose the<br>why for the Mahi she and her team teams<br>undertake this Mahi is not just a ticket<br>box exercise nor it's for nor is it for<br>wind window dressing or for PBF<br>rankings the Mahi the Emory and her<br>teams do aims to be transformational and<br>seeks positive outcomes for hero Hau e<br>MRI communities Amar I know it is tough<br>when time is tight in a lecture to do<br>justice to all that you have achieved<br>but I do think you underplayed some of<br>the uh things that you I think I would<br>like to say here I think you underplayed<br>the applied nature of your research and<br>and the impact that has had on<br>communities across the Motu and the<br>impact it has on the maintenance of<br>Mor you only have to look around the<br>furry newie tonight and to see who's<br>online to see representatives of<br>community who have been involved with<br>your work to see generations of students<br>present and those who um who will be<br>influenced in the future as an aside I'd<br>like to thank her too for making me an<br>academic great<br>grandmother she's doing a very good job<br>and so keep it<br>up I totally agree with amarie when she<br>said earlier that the infinite<br>possibilities exist within our<br>communities and with each other and part<br>of the joy of life is to realize them to<br>see you promoted Professor has given me<br>the utmost Joy so much so that sometimes<br>I can just about burst with happiness<br>and as you know in the University<br>thing so thank you Emory for sharing the<br>akum of your Mahi and I'm glad to hear<br>that<br>Tina is your Norm I look forward to<br>watching this space because we certainly<br>need to live life where Manor is<br>flourishing that Wu is whole while<br>having fun and getting up to a bit of<br>C so this is a small acknowledgement was<br>T and I'd like to hand the proceedings<br>Victoria here we<br>so I just wanted to to Amry a little bit<br>into I'll do a loose<br>translation I was saying she leads the<br>way and will'll follow we are healthy<br>because of her and the work that she<br>does we are also sitting like big fat<br>cucko PA proud of her achievements and<br>compliment now is the time for open mic<br>and so I we've got two options either I<br>can walk the microphone to you if you're<br>too shy to come forward um otherwise it<br>is time for Faro to share a few words to<br>share a wer or whatever it may be um to<br>acknowledge my M<br>here<br>uh<br>okay right and we've decided that um the<br>floor will be opened by members of 's<br>Faro<br>and there we<br>step<br>Emory when we were all sitting around<br>last night having a Yan and then you<br>were we asking you are you okay she goes<br>yeah yeah I'm okay what are you what are<br>you doing with your speech yeah yeah I'm<br>all good well watching tonight that's<br>awesome you know um after your<br>mother she was a<br>no when we used to go to school that's<br>why she was the old man's favorite cuz<br>she could do no wrong and I remember<br>remember we I was she was in fifth form<br>but he was in third form and I was in<br>fourth form and<br>just with the classrooms where we were<br>all aligned you see it was the<br>typing the bookkeeping and I was in the<br>AR<br>room the teacher kicked me out cuz I<br>flicking<br>painter so I walk outside and there my<br>two sisters in the same<br>boat and we girl standing there said<br>what happened to you oh your mother's<br>going ah she thinks she knows it all<br>what was your one yeah she thought she<br>knew so and saying that perhaps your<br>mother now in hindsight thinking about<br>it because she knew it all at school and<br>we kept getting kicked out of class she<br>probably thought she wanted know she had<br>kids she'd want you us to be on the<br>right track and I think that's she put<br>that emphasis on you guys and very proud<br>of you what you've done and also<br>Samantha you know you guys have um you<br>know you lost your mom and dad but you<br>you guys are still striving for<br>excellence you know and to me means a<br>lot and very proud of<br>oh I knew that's why they pushed me up<br>the front um I'm the younger sibling at<br>10 selia's younger brother um with

conscien ious that we do<br>have Kai to come but also it would be<br>remiss to not ensure that anyone who<br>would like to share any special words or<br>pay homage to Amory this is the time so<br>feel free to give me a little wee wave<br>or just make your way up the front I I<br>see a wave I'm going to hand the<br>Mala a warm Pacific greetings uh we<br>don't have an item for you um because I<br>um but that'll give you something to<br>think about<br>um and also in in the Sor tradition uh<br>we don't normally sing after someone's<br>spoken so if anyone behind me is having<br>a panic attack right now CU I just<br>pulled you out of the audience just take<br>a breath uh you're<br>okay um my name is Rose um I'm a career<br>academic and one of the things that I<br>specialize in is hanging out with<br>troublemakers um so it was it was really<br>just a matter of time before I found my<br>way uh to working with my friend<br>here there's three things really that I<br>wanted to say um on behalf of our<br>Pacific Community um and I know that<br>there are many people watching online um<br>our colleague Troy RI U many others uh<br>who have had the privilege of being part<br>of your life um and part of your team<br>and the first is is really um something<br>that was said to me recently about Safe<br>Harbor um it's it's it's tough out there<br>it's tough to be Mighty it's tough to be<br>pacific and a tery institution and there<br>have been so many people who you have<br>taken under your wing who your team has<br>welcomed into a space where they could<br>be pacific they could laugh as loud as<br>they wanted they there was food<br>everywhere many of the things that that<br>we you know speak to us as belonging um<br>I know there's many people who have<br>found that with you so thank you for<br>taking so many of uh our community under<br>your wing and now those people are uh<br>are joining our forces um in the in the<br>academic<br>Community the second thing is is that<br>allyship um we're often on different<br>Walker but we're heading in the same<br>direction and and there's something<br>about when times are tough and you're<br>throwing up over the side of your Walker<br>to look over and Emory is<br>like um to know that there are others<br>struggling uh who understand the<br>struggles um misery loves company and um<br>so thank you for being miserable with me<br>um I don't know that that's exactly what<br>I meant um but it it has just definitely<br>meant a great deal um to me as a<br>leader um<br>and finally you know some sometimes I<br>I'm working with you and I think how do<br>you keep and I probably asked you this<br>how do you keep can she keep going like<br>how does how when we're coming up<br>against a wall can you be cheerful can<br>you still be smiling can you be like you<br>know we we'll keep coming back at this<br>um where does that strength come from<br>and what I really loved about today<br>tonight um was just a really clear<br>picture that you drew for us of the many<br>many people who have brought you to be<br>who you are<br>um and now I understand it's it's<br>completely clear because I know many of<br>the people that you speak of and see the<br>strength see the intergenerational<br>dreaming that's come to be you and all<br>of those that that you work with um so<br>from us um um Tang Moana thank you to<br>all of you um for the gift that you have<br>given us uh she has provided us and our<br>community with so much um our Destinies<br>are intertwined um and and amarie lives<br>and breathes that with our community all<br>the time and so now what's left for us<br>um as an institution as a university is<br>to be worthy of this leadership um she<br>is one of the leaders of her generation<br>Within um the tery institution and so<br>our challenge as a university is to give<br>her the space to exert the things that<br>she needs to do to be the leader that<br>she needs to be um and just kind of get<br>Justin okay I'm being taught some<br>all the<br>K<br>sh<br>k k<br>GL<br>um I've just got something very very<br>little that I want to do and that's I'd<br>really love to acknowledge Professor Le<br>Williams Professor Le Williams at one<br>stage was the only Marty professor at AO<br>University and on campus and it's no<br>it's not a miracle that Marie ended up<br>graduating through PE school it was<br>I can't even talk I'm just so<br>happy I'm so happy and proud and so<br>happy and grateful to be part of her<br>journey and like anyone and everyone has<br>said to be able to just put a little bit<br>of my kitty into her Kitty but the<br>bigger thing is that she's got a<br>suitcase man she's got louison you know<br>it's huge and what she does is she<br>doesn't keep it for herself she spills<br>it out for everyone else to be a part<br>of I'd also really like to acknowledge<br>professor John<br>Bron because of the position he had in<br>the institution as well but also because<br>he's the past chair of<br>P he dreamed of this too and these are<br>the visions of all of those people<br>before us that have been there and<br>supported us I really want to me to God<br>foru too<br>God B who like you was able to stand in<br>the institution and help educate the<br>institution on why and how to create<br>this mighty space for us and of course<br>we've already acknowledged all the roles<br>of other people in the institution<br>sitting in here that have being part of<br>that space of looking after Mar and I<br>really want to Mi to you and Marie<br>because within your court it all tonight<br>you brought into Focus that it's also<br>the spiritual and the Unseen World<br>that's integral and important for us as<br>Mar to Stand St safe stand safe in<br>institutions that are<br>nonmi I want to acknowledge to those of<br>you in leadership in the front row there<br>the pie for giving the opportunity for<br>academics like all of those that are<br>presented here our Mar academics Anon<br>hiding down the back other people that<br>uh are humble leaders for us humble<br>leaders and always connected to us and<br>always bring their accountability back<br>to the E and back to their people but a<br>for their people and that's the essence<br>of your corded or twoo about not being<br>selfish and greedy about the status that<br>comes from your learning for being the<br>teachers that you should be and we can<br>be because the knowledge belongs to all<br>of<br>us to all of us and the thing is that<br>all of<br>like but you know when you die these<br>heaps of people that come to me to<br>you<br>day time's Gonna Come and<br>sing but yes acknowledgement or the<br>greatness that exists in all of<br>us she's not she's uh she's not she's<br>not<br>fore<br>fore<br>fore<br>okay<br>um I'm the one that students used to<br>hide<br>from used to be terrified and an Marie<br>examples cuz when an Marie turned up you<br>know she came from<br>Pearl other students especially the ones<br>who came from T Tai too said to me where<br>do they come<br>from they sounded as if they came out of<br>America and I would say my name is p and<br>there um and as the 17-year-old I didn't<br>me their dad till later on by the way I<br>you see see their mom because she would<br>tell me if they needed to see someone<br>well she go Emory's coming to your<br>office and I'm going well before she<br>so I used to call her and I used to tell<br>her I said you're not from down south<br>you're from up North and she goes I know<br>that and I said well we need to go<br>through all this stuff and once we got<br>it I made sure she filled in a lot of<br>scholarships so and I know now she's<br>making sure her<br>TOA get scholarships so I really want to<br>thank Pai the university and Nao and<br>many other every around the country and<br>organizations who have put money forward<br>to the education of our people cuz this<br>is what leadership is all about who's<br>standing next to us is an<br>Marie and to<br>Charlie Charlie you were just Magic by<br>priceless forget about Mom you're<br>Priceless and to CC you were the<br>tong and um and Marie and and but when<br>Sam turned up oh Sam was Co<br>man and she was on Miss K come she<br>wasn't afraid Sam but um we've been<br>fortunate that these two wonderful<br>W chose otaga to the University of otaga<br>you're damn lucky that these two<br>beautiful young woman chose the<br>University of otago to have this<br>Venture of<br>Academia that they have excelled in<br>extremely to the Excellence of<br>par and you know<br>when like people um going and studying<br>within University but wanted our people<br>to we Mar to hold dear to all Marty and<br>and Marie is an example of<br>that when she was sitting up to K she<br>would say we're going to do this no no<br>actually I want to go back to your<br>parents because without them we wouldn't<br>have this great woman at otago and then<br>we got to meet their family um CC was<br>awesome she used to tell me when the<br>girls needed to come into the m<br>center and and she used tell them to<br>come and they wouldn't so I just ring<br>them up and they go what am I doing here<br>your mother said you need to see me so<br>what's<br>up um and when they lost their parents<br>in particular CC it was a hard journey<br>not only for them but many of us who<br>knew her and knew what she had given<br>students in PE knew what she had given<br>this<br>community this tiny<br>woman who had a heart of goal and the<br>strength of the entire up<br>race so she didn't have problem saying<br>to me get over there and do this we're<br>going here we're going out to the m are<br>you coming I'm going no I got to do this<br>sending but I want to thank her because<br>she was just amazing um and and what do<br>you do is a lot of the footprints that<br>and um watching Anar just go on stage<br>when she graduated we go<br>hoay um and then for her to go on to get<br>her PhD her doctorate cuz fortunate<br>there were a few others and they were<br>mostly<br>males and I always always wonder you<br>know God I hope we get a female then<br>Farah came and then an Marie and now an<br>Marie have these amazing Scholars that I<br>look at at the back that I know will<br>follow in so thank you thank you for<br>opening the pathway and leading the<br>leadership that you've bought and<br>bringing those young Marty into the<br>future for our tamiki and our M that<br>would give New Zealand and this Motu a<br>greater advantage in the global<br>World um what else was I going to say I<br>her oh yeah she she was even teaching at<br>the Marty Center and then had to say to<br>you're going to get paid she goes really<br>this no um and I guess for many of us we<br>are fortunate that she's allowed us and<br>from her far I thank her Faro for<br>allowing us to walk alongside<br>her because now she's on her own my<br>challenge to the university is I hope<br>you Dam will look after her cuz I know<br>this is how all her fin<br>feel and as I we Mar and you know I'm<br>from<br>G but I hope you can look after her and<br>you can assist her with the challenges<br>she's going through or having and I hope<br>you open that door and that pathway for<br>her her to lead this un University in<br>the future of science globally because<br>come on these big problems big problems<br>around the world in regards to Sciences<br>we just said with Co all of it and I<br>think you could become the<br>leaders to take that academically and in<br>our indigenous<br>world and that's I think for us it's<br>that's definitely what Indy is all about<br>it's not just our Papa it's about<br>our environment it's about the stars in<br>the sky it's about our fenua and our<br>Moana and meeting all these other young<br>people and Rob and other people that are<br>involved I met school kids who have the<br>heart of those water safety programs and<br>to tell you the truth I'm glad a lot of<br>people know how to swim because as you<br>know I'm from the east coast and the<br>beach I live next to we can't even go on<br>because of the Slash and the Driftwood<br>we don't even like how kids to swim in<br>there at the moment<br>and I'm hope we're hoping that people<br>will find a<br>solution uh and just watching anarie and<br>your delivery of your lecture tonight<br>students should be excited that they're<br>going to come to your classes I think<br>the<br>future for this<br>University even though they're going<br>through a lot of problems at the<br>moment what I'm reading in the newspaper<br>on the news<br>is bright if they have allowed the<br>leadership because they have the support<br>of the IR which is Nao and if you got<br>that you know it's<br>beware so um I can me cot I'll just ask<br>oh they wait for this what what okay<br>here before we sing this how I want to<br>C<br>by<br>might<br>and<br>people that that was a boomer<br>joke still got<br>it uh this is the time Faro we don't<br>want awkward silences we want straight<br>up here and if you're not coming up then<br>we'll start to conclude with here some<br>wonderful acknowledgements it's not too<br>late give me a signal I feel like I'm at<br>Cy Cy that's us I thought while I was<br>sitting here um I thought of a faki and<br>I thought that would be something nice<br>to conclude this evening's cordal with<br>uh and actually there's two there's two<br> toi it's all going to wrap into<br>one it worked out on my head I hope it's<br>going to work out while I've got the<br>mic but I wanted to acknowledge your<br>work with takor Ado New Zealand water<br>safety<br>um and we know there some really<br>important work that needs to be done for<br>our people we are people of the Pacific<br>the ocean joins us and we need to<br>connect with that and get those skills<br>back so I've been thinking about that<br>and I've also been thinking about how<br>you've normalized we've heard the word<br>normalized and we've got a whole bunch<br>of could a COA kids who just come to the<br>University of ATO cuz it's normal now<br>University ofo do not take credit for<br>that it's people like amarie who need to<br>credit but I will give you credit for<br>looking after her and for allowing her<br>to be her and explore this indigenous<br>space and and create the new Norm for us<br>so I do M to you for that anyway back to<br>this faki so I've been inspired by takor<br>and also by some of the cordor that's<br>and what that means is it means<br>knowledge is sacred and it flows like<br>water from our heavens and it<br>acknowledges our lineage our Papa<br>right up to the fu into the Ultimate<br>Universe and it it also acknowledges uh<br>one of the physical manifestations of<br>knowledge which for many ewi is water<br>and we all know how important water can<br>be and I I thought that was fitting<br>knowing your connection with ensuring<br>our water is well and that our people<br>is and that means where water flows or<br>gathers people will gather and we people<br>gather dialogue discussion and<br>conversations will flow and tonight we<br>have gathered by Karai by the water we'<br>have had the physical manifestation of<br>knowledge where this water has been<br>flown we have gathered and discussion<br>and dialogue has been had and what an<br>I'm going to hand you the microphone to<br>conclude with kakia and then Foo we're<br>going to go into the F Kai for Kai it's<br>going to take us a a couple of minutes<br>to squeeze through the do but what I ask<br>you to do is go through there sit down<br>at the tables all of the kai is laid out<br>we'll wait for kakia Kai once we're all<br>in there and then we can all eat<br>together and have a bit more informal<br>discussion and and celebrations sound<br>planid nice and big fat<br>now<br>fore<br>foreign<br>speee<br>foreign<br>heart</p></main><footer
