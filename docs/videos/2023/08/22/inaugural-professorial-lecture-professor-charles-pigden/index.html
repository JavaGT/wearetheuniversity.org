give your<br>presentation the voted thanks and we'll<br>get to dinner so I'll now invite<br>Professor weather to introduce start the<br>introductions of the formal party<br>proceedings thank you very much<br>sure uh<br>I'm associate professor Zach Weber head<br>of the philosophy program here at otago<br>and it's my pleasure is that right it's<br>my pleasure to uh introduce Charles<br>pigdon tonight I was asked to introduce<br>him as a philosopher so to say a few<br>words about that so Charles has been<br>with us since 1988 after graduating uh<br>Cambridge and then studying in Latrobe<br>Australia<br>my experience of Charles as a<br>philosopher is somebody who is warmly<br>deeply and enthusiastically committed<br>so the first time I came to Dunedin was<br>for a conference back when I was a PhD<br>student and Charles came to my talk even<br>though I was just a lowly student and he<br>excitedly and supportively asked really<br>original questions and I was nervous and<br>it was a really formative experience to<br>have him there and then when I came to<br>to otago later as a junior lecturer<br>Charles sat in on an entire course that<br>I taught just off his own bat he was<br>just wanted to sit there and he gave me<br>lots of again really supportive and high<br>quality questions and it wasn't always<br>patronizing or coddling sometimes it was<br>pretty hard questions and I appreciated<br>that too and he gave me lots of positive<br>feedback in writing which was also<br>useful for confirmation when that came<br>along later<br>uh Charles's career is distinctive for<br>having made contributions to an<br>unusually wide range of areas so most of<br>us philosophers just kind of pick one<br>tree and circle around it for most of<br>our career Charles has covered the<br>forest uh his knowledge is Broad and<br>deep and he has a long record in many<br>parts of philosophy with as he'll say a<br>long citation record to go along with it<br>his breadth of competence is highly<br>unusual so he's contributed as well here<br>tonight to three at least to three<br>distinct areas he's worked on the<br>philosophy of Bertrand Russell he wrote<br>edited a book Russell on Ethics in 1999<br>which won the Bertrand Russell Society<br>book award he wrote a book length entry<br>on Russell's moral Philosophy for the<br>Stanford Encyclopedia of philosophy he<br>he brought to the world the idea that<br>Russell did Serious work on ethics which<br>was not taken seriously until Charles<br>came along<br>uh he is also an expert on the<br>philosophy of conspiracy theories<br>um according to butter and Knight he<br>opened up a new set of debates in<br>analytic Philosophy by challenging the<br>assumption that conspiracy theories are<br>always mistaken and that's been going<br>since the 90s and going strong so and<br>although Charles does dabble in many<br>areas his chief interest is in<br>metaethics so he's mostly known for<br>having defended the error Theory with<br>special interests in Moore and Hume and<br>the is ought question which is the<br>question can you get an ought from an is<br>and he's been working on that with a<br>conference on a related topic planned<br>for later this year that's right<br>so along with his scholarship Charles I<br>say is an invaluable and distinctive<br>member of the philosophical community<br>both locally and Beyond he's he's<br>extremely open and interested in more<br>than just his own work he listens and<br>actively participates in the work of<br>others so if you ever give a talk at the<br>otago philosophy seminar you can expect<br>Charles to be there asking really<br>engaged and entertaining questions that<br>shows that he is interested in all sorts<br>of things he's also known more widely<br>for contributing comments and<br>discussions online<br>around the world<br>Charles sets an example for both<br>students and colleagues of what I want<br>to say is the true pure philosopher<br>so when we have staff meetings which<br>tend to be kind of mundane exercises in<br>governance and we're discussing a<br>scheduling issue like should we schedule<br>class X before y uh Charles<br>says let's stop and talk through the<br>philosophical issues so I say should we<br>schedule X before Y and Charles says<br>well would that inadvertently suggest<br>the wrong historical relationship<br>between Hobbes and Hume or you know show<br>that the Moto logic S5 is not really<br>correct for necessity because students<br>shouldn't be taught that for Charles<br>it's always it's always the right time<br>to stop and think through the<br>philosophical ideas that brought us here<br>in the first place and I find that<br>deeply and genuinely impressive that<br>Charles has never lost his Spark<br>or Genuine enthusiasm for philosophy he<br>does it every minute of every day and we<br>are all the better for it so when I<br>first met Charles when I was a PhD<br>student at I think where we're going to<br>have the reception later Charles said to<br>me<br>I'm a pretty good five-minute<br>philosopher there are a lot of<br>philosophers who they can go away and<br>think for a long time and they then say<br>something profound I can go away for<br>about five minutes and come back with<br>something pretty good<br>uh and I'm here to say that Charles<br>might be a five-minute philosopher but<br>he is also a lifetime philosopher and<br>what he has had to say over his career<br>and tonight is something that most of us<br>would never come up with even in five<br>minutes but we would be lucky to so aim<br>Kia Charles uh heartfelt congratulations<br>professor pigton<br>a Koto katoa KO Blue Ridge to manga KO<br>hello my name is Lisa Ellis and I direct<br>the philosophy politics and economics<br>program here at otaku<br>Waka I'll get that right soon<br>why am I giving a second introduction to<br>Professor pigdon you are wondering<br>Charles founded otago's PPE program 25<br>years ago next year and the decisions he<br>made then and the teaching he has done<br>since have made the otago PPE program<br>what it is today<br>it is a collection of people devoted to<br>understanding human beings as they are<br>and laws as they might be<br>so back in 1999 Charles and his<br>colleagues decided to go all in on<br>interdisciplinarity<br>PPE students at Oxford can drop a<br>subject after one year our students are<br>fully qualified in all three disciplines<br>they take our core seminar and in our<br>quartet seminar teams of staff and<br>students interact on difficult questions<br>and often disagree<br>there are questions like how real is<br>altruism<br>what do we really know about what drives<br>economic behavior<br>are structural or individual historical<br>events more important in driving<br>revolutions what are the conditions of<br>successful Collective action<br>and always every year<br>will this year's cohort solve the divide<br>and deal Collective action dilemma and<br>get away with the chocolate or do the<br>staff take it home again<br>this year the students won first time in<br>ages<br>so Charles's team-taught sessions with<br>Economist David Fielding have become<br>legendary and these sessions have<br>continued even after David took up a<br>professorship at the University of<br>Manchester so during covid he was nobly<br>zooming in at 4am his time and since<br>then he's been showing up and we're<br>really grateful<br>uh the two of them present the history<br>of political economic ideas together<br>with the latest behavioral economics<br>research asking whether the political<br>economists of the 18th century were<br>right or not<br>um<br>I would like to deliver some words to<br>Charles from David<br>says<br>I am very sorry that I can't be present<br>at Charles's inaugural professorial<br>lecture<br>and I wish him all the very best for the<br>occasion<br>I first met Charles in 2004 when the PPE<br>program at otago was still in its<br>infancy<br>he was the program director and I was<br>the economics Department representative<br>I was initially somewhat skeptical about<br>the potential for the degree to attract<br>many students in a New Zealand<br>University where students already have<br>so much choice but Charles's efforts<br>have proved the skepticism to be<br>entirely unfounded<br>the success of PPE at otago is at least<br>in part because of an intellectual<br>coherence lacked by similar degrees<br>elsewhere and this coherence is a<br>consequence of the enthusiasm wisdom and<br>scholarship that Charles has brought to<br>its design and management<br>the breadth of his knowledge and<br>scholarship is matched only by his<br>kindness<br>whatever reasons Charles has for being<br>good<br>David those words are so true I could go<br>on telling stories about Charles's<br>contributions to PPE all night but that<br>is not why you are all here so no rera<br>tenakoto katoa please join me in<br>welcoming professor Charles pigdon<br>there we are<br>teller<br>I'm pleased to meet you all happy to see<br>see you and now I'm going to give my<br>inaugural lecture now I draw your<br>attention to the title life and works or<br>a philosopher high and low<br>well that's obvious enough the typical<br>encyclopedia entry on a dead philosopher<br>starts off with some such section and<br>though I am not dead yet I've probably<br>lived about three quarters of my life<br>already<br>thus encomposing my own encyclopedia<br>entry or even a preliminary Auto<br>obituary which is sort of what one does<br>in an IPL when you're my aide<br>I've already had a fair bit of life to<br>work with<br>so like many another IPL this is going<br>to be about my work in the context of my<br>life or it's going to be about my work<br>and how I feel about life<br>but what about a philosopher high and<br>low<br>well the title comes from the English<br>translation of Balzac's novel Splendor<br>in Missouri<br>a harlot high and low<br>now just to be clear<br>I am not equating philosophers with<br>harlots<br>and again to be clear I'm emphatically<br>it's emphatically not true of my<br>colleagues in the philosophy department<br>at otago<br>um I have in fact been extremely<br>privileged in my colleagues over the<br>last 35 years 37 if you count my time<br>here as a postdoc not only cultured<br>passionate and gifted philosophers but<br>decent and even outstanding human beings<br>indeed I want to emphasize that they're<br>not just fine philosophers but have been<br>fine people to work with I won't say<br>that there have been no tiffs and<br>quarrels over a 35-year period but they<br>have been few and far between<br>it's only a slight exaggeration to say<br>mod only<br>by a certain deficiency of sisters<br>a problem that is only just now and not<br>but you know you have been those of you<br>who are still with us wonderful people<br>I I want to pay tribute in particular to<br>the outstanding leadership of two people<br>I could list others but um<br>uh<br>uh there are two particularly people I<br>want to mention now being a leader isn't<br>simply a matter of occupying a<br>managerial role or role of authority<br>it's not simply being good at the<br>everyday business of administration and<br>management though that is not to be<br>sneezed at<br>it's a matter of using that authority to<br>bring out the best in people and of<br>creating a climate in which people feel<br>encouraged and feel free to give it<br>their best and to live to the top of<br>their talents and in particular I want<br>to say<br>um uh you know a I want to acknowledge<br>Alan Alan's<br>um leadership of the Department from<br>1970 onwards has been outstanding he<br>took a department which was<br>um a sort of good provincial Department<br>with usually you know one distinguished<br>professor as kind of the star which is<br>what it was from about 1939 to<br>one in which<br>there are lots of distinguished<br>professors who could reasonably claim to<br>be stars that is to a very considerable<br>extent Allen's achievement<br>and you know I'm I I'm really it's nice<br>to have those kind words from Lisa about<br>the PPE program but I want to say that<br>as my successor has director of the<br>program her leadership has been<br>absolutely outstanding<br>um those who know Lisa will know that<br>she is a very nice person you know<br>really nice and nice I'm going to say in<br>a slightly American way you can imagine<br>you know some picket fence drama at<br>least it'll be the person who brings<br>around the basket of goodies to the new<br>with a ferociously brilliant intellect<br>and also an enormous amount of energy<br>and the success of the program since she<br>took over has been phenomenal and it is<br>really to a very considerable extent her<br>doing so I want to acknowledge Lisa's<br>leadership as well as Allen's<br>okay well that's my shout out to my<br>colleagues but now<br>if I'm not comparing philosophers to<br>harlots<br>works with the high and low<br>well I'm going to do something a bit<br>unusual for an IPL I'm not just going to<br>tell you about my ideas and why I think<br>they're interestingly important<br>though I will be telling you about some<br>of my ideas and why I think they're<br>interesting important<br>I'm not just going to boast about my<br>successes<br>though I will boast about some of my<br>successes<br>those are the highs<br>I'm going to talk a bit about the lows<br>I'm going to discuss some of my failures<br>not so much as a professional<br>philosopher but as a citizen in what I<br>have intermittently tried to be<br>a public intellectual who takes very<br>seriously the academic statutory role as<br>so let's begin at the beginning<br>I was born in 1956 in the UK<br>one third of the way through what Thomas<br>picketty calls laterant gloriers the 30<br>glorious years<br>1945 to 1975 when capitalism seemed to<br>be living up to the advertising<br>it was capitalism tamed capitalism of<br>the human face the rough edges have been<br>being rubbed off by the Social<br>Democratic state<br>Society was not just getting richer<br>though it certainly was that it was<br>becoming more equal and characterized by<br>a greater degree of social Mobility<br>IO<br>many golden opportunities that life has<br>given me to two things British and later<br>Aussie and New Zealand social democracy<br>and secondarily a much later this<br>basically comes from my father's success<br>fairly late in life American capitalism<br>I also want to talk about<br>a remark made by Ellen Wilkinson red<br>Ellen<br>minister of Education in the Atlee<br>neighbor government of<br>1945-51 she actually died part of the<br>way through this<br>she made it a remark about what the goal<br>of the government in general and of the<br>education policy in particular was<br>she said we want to produce the third<br>program Society now you might say what<br>the hell is that what is the third<br>program Society well<br>it's a reference which is now summed<br>outdated but can easily be explained the<br>third program<br>in Britain was what you might call the<br>intellectual slash concert program<br>on British radio<br>and so when she was talking about the<br>third program Society what she meant was<br>a society in which the highest cultural<br>Goods<br>are both available to everybody and<br>would be appreciated by everybody they<br>won't just be confined to a cultural<br>Elite<br>so that was part of the ambition of that<br>government<br>to<br>give the highest cultural Goods not just<br>to the favored unfortunate few but to<br>everybody<br>now that was perhaps excessively<br>ambitious I am not sure that you could<br>say that they produced the third program<br>Society<br>but what they did do is produce some<br>third program people<br>that is to say there were quite a lot of<br>people who those institutions brought to<br>the world of culture and gave<br>and my family my parents myself my<br>brother were given those opportunities<br>by the Social Democratic State uh<br>my parents were working class my dad was<br>um during the Great Depression there<br>were times when the only money coming<br>into a seven-person household was the<br>money he was making on his paper round<br>my mother had to leave school was um was<br>you know told to leave school despite<br>her Stellar academic performance age 16.<br>but they were given opportunities<br>because what was provided to them was<br>the opportunity to retrain<br>to retrain as a school teacher in the<br>case of my mother to retrain as a<br>lecturer at a college of further<br>education in the case of my father<br>uh and um that launched their career my<br>mother was a deputy principal my father<br>after working for a while<br>um in uh<br>a college of further education<br>later got a job with the Computing<br>company Sperry univac and Rose to be its<br>International Director of Education<br>so um you know when I was um in my late<br>teens we were actually doing pretty well<br>but when I was growing up<br>we were actually living in the Upper<br>um which wasn't as large as the house in<br>which I'm duplicating this with my<br>beloved daughter over there and her<br>husband and my grandchildren<br>um it was much smaller<br>but<br>the society was a society of Hope a<br>society of progress a society of<br>increasing opportunity and increasing<br>equality<br>and that was where uh you know I started<br>off that was my initial experience<br>and what I kind of took to be normal<br>now a book which meant a lot to me part<br>of the cultural riches to which I had<br>access<br>um and which I read about the age of<br>eight or nine is a book by Jeffrey trace<br>the historical novelist called this is<br>your century and what it is is a history<br>of the 20th century<br>it was published in 1965 I must have<br>read it shortly after it was published<br>this is the closing paragraph uh we've<br>already had you know<br>the horrors of the 20th century and now<br>the closing paragraph<br>if Bismarck were alive today he would<br>have little call to worry less the Next<br>Generation be bored through a lack of<br>problems in any case he might well shrug<br>his shoulders and say it will be your<br>Affair now if you're bored your fathers<br>and grandfathers have done their best or<br>you may complain their worst You Carry<br>On from here<br>where do you like whether you like it or<br>not I'm afraid this is your Century you<br>now these words an oration from an<br>imaginary Bismarck<br>really sank in and have continued to<br>influence me ever since the lesson I<br>took away from it was that the state of<br>the world was my responsibility not just<br>my responsibility of course and<br>obviously there was not much I could do<br>about it when I read this initially at<br>the age of eight but I did feel then and<br>I do feel now that it was my<br>responsibility to do my bit a World War<br>II expression that had not yet died out<br>to help make the world a better place or<br>at least to stop it from getting worse<br>and this brings me to the big failure<br>the massive failure that's characterized<br>my life a failure that isn't just mine<br>but is the failure of an entire<br>generation<br>we didn't do it do a good job with the<br>rest of our century<br>we messed it up<br>and we continued to mess make a mess of<br>the 21st century too<br>furthermore the mess we have made May<br>well end up bringing<br>um about a global catastrophe putting<br>the very risk a very existence of our<br>civilization in peril<br>for the rise of neoliberalism destroyed<br>wrecked or at least decimated those<br>Social Democratic institutions to which<br>I owe so much<br>we no longer live in the sort of<br>squashed pyramid which those those<br>institutions created we live in a<br>society in which it which is much less<br>equal in which power and wealth are<br>concentrated in forum for your hands and<br>in which social Mobility has been much<br>reduced we live in a society in which<br>the affected power of the state to<br>regulate commerce and thus prevent<br>pollution including pollution by<br>greenhouse gases has been much reduced<br>not because Parliament is not<br>theoretically Sovereign but because it<br>is very difficult to build majorities<br>for policies that enable Parliament to<br>we live in a society in which public<br>institutions such as universities<br>schools and hospitals are effectively<br>starved of funds<br>something I don't need to exercise<br>emphasize very much in the current<br>context<br>why well basically because governments<br>don't dare to tax the rich<br>now all this is partly due partly due to<br>the decay of the sense of social<br>solidarity which made it possible to<br>possible to build those Social<br>Democratic institutions in the first<br>place and<br>failure<br>to articulate and argue for the relevant<br>ideals<br>and here perhaps I should put my hand up<br>as one of the guilty men excuse<br>when I could have been doing this though<br>I consider the ideas underlying social<br>democracy to be true and or important<br>I never found one to be particularly<br>interesting<br>well thank you Marvin<br>but I'm not so sure I thought they were<br>just too obvious to require a sustained<br>intellectual defense so as an<br>intellectual task it wasn't interesting<br>and I I think you know I I went wrong<br>now the Fate is of my generation May<br>well Spell catastrophe for the world as<br>a neoliberal and post-neoliberal<br>governments currently in power are<br>unlikely<br>to do anything very effective about<br>climate change and note the catastrophe<br>is already upon us the end of the world<br>as we know it may already be beginning<br>1.5 is thought to be 1.55 degrees above<br>the you know pre-industrial level it's<br>thought to be the maximum safe level<br>well in May the World Meteorological<br>organization published a report<br>highlighting a 66 likelihood that the<br>annual average global temperature in<br>2023 to 2027 will be more than 1.5 above<br>the pre-industrial levels for at least<br>one year<br>so 66 that we're going to hit that right<br>and a 32 chance<br>that that will be the mean temperature<br>thus we may very well have already<br>passed what the Paris Accord suggested<br>was the upper limit of safety<br>the floods<br>the wildfires that dominate the news are<br>all are the writing on the wall<br>oh how far away<br>is mass starvation or or large areas of<br>the world simply becoming uninhabited<br>uninhabitable well we don't know<br>we don't know but these possibilities<br>are looming in the relatively near<br>future<br>okay now I can at least claim some<br>credit for having opposed these<br>developments<br>I've been doing this on and off for 34<br>years<br>but though I have not been an<br>accomplished in my generation's<br>catastrophic failures I feel acutely<br>that I have not done enough to stop them<br>I may have done my bit<br>but I'm not at all sure that my bit was<br>good enough<br>so for the rest of this lecture I will<br>intervene weave the story of my<br>political failures with those of my<br>philosophical successes successes sorry<br>not successes successes the life and the<br>work<br>the lows and the highs<br>well now let's start with two more<br>snapshots from later on gloriers<br>this time<br>both from their dying days<br>now sometime in the early 70s when I was<br>15 or 16 I started to read the work of<br>Burton Russell<br>I followed a well-trodden path into<br>philosophy<br>many philosophical autobiographies tell<br>the same Tale<br>first I got interested in Russell's more<br>popular writings then I moved on to<br>technical questions such as the issue of<br>whether mathematics can be reduced to<br>logic<br>particularly important for me was<br>Russell's autobiography which showed how<br>one could combine a passionate interest<br>in abstract ideas with an equally<br>passionate commitment to social activism<br>perhaps I too could pursue my<br>intellectual interests while doing my<br>bit for the world as Jeffrey trees's<br>Bismarck had instructed me to do<br>second Snapshot from the dying days of<br>of lateral gloriers<br>in October 1976 I went up to Cambridge<br>only the second person in my family to<br>um<br>there'd be many since<br>I I had signed up to the moral Sciences<br>as philosophy is called at Cambridge<br>though I wasn't sure whether I would<br>like it history was my backup subject if<br>it turned out that you know philosophy I<br>wasn't suited to philosophy<br>by the end of my first term about the<br>time I turned 20. I decided that I<br>absolutely adored philosophy that if I<br>possibly could I wanted to spend the<br>rest of my life thinking about<br>philosophical questions<br>well that life is not over but I am<br>singularly blessed since I've managed to<br>do this now for 46 years<br>so I'm a very lucky person<br>now some philosophers speak rather<br>pompously of philosophy as a vocation<br>if I'm honest I have to say that for me<br>it's more like an addiction<br>I just love thinking about philosophical<br>issues developing arguments and counter<br>arguments furthermore because for any<br>intellectual subject X there is a<br>sub-discipline the philosophy of x<br>in the words of Dan Dennett<br>if you're a professional philosopher you<br>can read almost any book you like and<br>that's great you know that's really<br>great thing about being a philosopher I<br>love that<br>philosophy is the interdisciplinary<br>subject par Excellence but being<br>addicted philosophy is not like being<br>addicted to drugs or sex it's much more<br>like an addiction to chess or an<br>addiction to video games or an addiction<br>to the violin in becoming addicted you<br>internalize a range of standards and a<br>set of aims such as what counts as a<br>good move or a good argument or a<br>well-played Pizzicato<br>and aims as I say Victory or the right<br>kind of victory in the case of Chess and<br>video games the perfect performance in<br>the case of the violin and in the case<br>of philosophy<br>Victory yes<br>I do like to win arguments<br>if you really love philosophy then<br>you're going to admire clever arguments<br>you're going to feel bad if your own<br>arguments don't Stack Up you are likely<br>to loathe bad arguments and detest<br>intellectual dishonesty in general<br>and you're likely to have a passionate<br>desire to solve philosophical questions<br>the philosophy is likely to be what<br>Russell jokingly defined as a patent<br>someone who likes his statements to be<br>true<br>and this is not because the philosopher<br>has a pre-prepared set of statements on<br>which true is to be conferred like some<br>sort of honorific<br>there is a way the world is and the true<br>philosopher wants to confine him or<br>herself to statements which correspond<br>at least that's true the philosophies<br>but there's a problem with the pursuit<br>of Truth<br>what is true is not always edifying or<br>or useful and what is edifying and even<br>useful may not be true<br>in that case the little boy who wanted<br>to do his bit might come into conflict<br>with the young philosopher<br>so<br>it's kind of a conflict right when I<br>first began to study philosophy before<br>going after Cambridge I was fascinated<br>by the idea cold from Reading penguin<br>Classics that moral judgments could be<br>prude and by proved I meant prude as<br>true I didn't imagine some degenerate<br>form of proof such as what an agent with<br>normal or non-forlatical desires would<br>arrive at given certain canons of<br>rationality morality I thought was a<br>matter of fact and the task was to find<br>what those facts were<br>AJ is famous book language truth and<br>logic hi on my Cambridge reading list<br>came as a shock<br>people oppressed by an authoritarian or<br>religious upbringing apparently find<br>language true Soul logic liberating for<br>me it was the reverse<br>the questions that interested me were<br>not just unanswerable they could not<br>sensibly be asked not only were there no<br>moral truths since moral judgments just<br>expressed emotions morality was not even<br>an arena for rational debate<br>I felt that language truth and logic was<br>a conceptual prison cutting me off from<br>Lush fields of thought logical<br>positivism the metaphysics of the sensor<br>now that was good for me in a way I went<br>out and reinvented a number of<br>anti-positivist wills and I now regard<br>language truth and logic as basically a<br>farago of fallacies<br>there were however some permanent<br>casualties my faith in the objectivity<br>of morals was shattered<br>I was enormously attracted by GE Moore's<br>principia ethica and found it far more<br>plausible as an account of what moral<br>judgments mean<br>but positive prejudices remained I could<br>not believe in the morning good<br>well I'm inclined to say I was right on<br>both counts moral judgments do not belie<br>their propositional form they are<br>designed to state facts moral judgments<br>deal in moral qualities in good and bad<br>and right and wrong to sustain moral<br>truth we need special here's the Latin<br>phrase sui generis properties of<br>goodness and Badness relations of<br>obligation Etc in short a realm of<br>autonomous values<br>that's what must be if moral judgments<br>are to be true<br>so more is right about what moral<br>judgments mean<br>but it's<br>metaphysically false there are no such<br>properties as more supposes hence no<br>moral judgments are<br>mostly false morality is a fiction<br>necessary one it's in Plato's phrase a<br>noble lie<br>hence the perhaps somewhat uninspiring<br>title of my PhD thesis nihilism a<br>defense<br>so I'm just going to give you the<br>argument and outline people might want<br>to ask me about this later so<br>non-cognitivism is false that is to say<br>moral judgments are propositions they're<br>not orders they're not explanations<br>hence they are either true or false<br>they're in the true false game<br>two naturalism is false naturalism being<br>the view that moral judgments can be<br>boiled down to or based upon statements<br>of natural fact<br>three there are no such properties<br>therefore no such realm conclusion moral<br>judgments are systematically false now I<br>should say<br>a theoretical Nile is such as myself<br>need not be an annihilist or an A<br>moralist in practice although in moments<br>of matter ethical Clarity I believe<br>moral judgments be false in daily life I<br>can and do participate in the fiction<br>this is not just a matter of acting in<br>accordance with the dictates of common<br>decency you know which is prudent<br>um<br>it's a matter of belief I believe or<br>make believe that a vast range of moral<br>judgments are true<br>and this isn't just a case of dry<br>intellectualism a sense my experience is<br>Tainted with the moral illusion good and<br>bad seem to me seem to me as real as<br>black and white so far as the<br>phenomenology of moral Goes My Life is<br>much like that of other people indeed<br>maybe more morally charged than the case<br>than with some people I feel like a rip<br>snorting moral realist<br>but my everyday moral beliefs and the<br>feelings and experiences consequent on<br>those beliefs are in flat contradiction<br>to my medical theories<br>I am not just a reluctant but an<br>inconsistent nihilist<br>and now a short digression on<br>interdisciplinarity<br>a big focus of my teaching though less<br>so perhaps thus far on my research is<br>the why be moral question right<br>a question that's particularly acute for<br>me given that for me being moral<br>involves signing on to a fiction<br>now my answer is partly literary I<br>discuss the issue in part by considering<br>a range of fictional a moralists and<br>arguing that their lives are empty or<br>unlivable three of the amoralists being<br>Nikolai stev Rogan from dostiasis the<br>devils and valmore and murtoy from their<br>clothes leilaison Don Jose<br>I've been running a successful course on<br>this for about 20 years<br>but why then<br>well I first got to hear about them<br>when my then girlfriend and now wife<br>Cena who was studying French and Russian<br>used to come back from her Cambridge<br>classes and tell me about all the<br>exciting things that her lecturers and<br>supervisors had been saying<br>I pride myself on being an<br>interdisciplinary scholar but what I<br>want to stress is that the right sort of<br>interdisciplinarity is not imposed from<br>above but arises from Below in the<br>course of conversations in the common<br>room or the cafe<br>or in my case the bedroom<br>so this is a shout out to my wife Xena<br>for amongst other things introducing me<br>to the greats of French and Russian<br>literature one reason that I became the<br>interdisciplinary scholar that I am is<br>that I was lucky enough to fall in love<br>now<br>um<br>here's the thing about my philosophical<br>not actually very socially beneficial<br>right<br>um<br>a lot of Scholars in the humanities are<br>deeply convinced that their research<br>work isn't just a contribution to<br>culture but socially useful<br>often I think they're deluded<br>um you're not likely to make a<br>contribution to social progress by<br>developing a radical reading of<br>Shakespeare's Richard III<br>but<br>given the content of my opinions this is<br>not a delusion that I was like to share<br>the idea that morality is a useful<br>fiction is a best socially harmless and<br>at worst mildly pernicious<br>so if an obedience to my inner Bismarck<br>I was to do my duty and do my bit for<br>society and not just for culture I did<br>not think I should confine my energies<br>to teaching and research socially useful<br>as I think teaching is you know I could<br>say a lot about why I think teaching is<br>important but there's only so much time<br>well I blew into New Zealand on the<br>wings of a postdoc there being no chance<br>of philosophical employment in my native<br>land where Margaret Thatcher was taking<br>an ax to education in general and<br>philosophy in particular I thought I was<br>coming to a Social Democratic Society in<br>which I could well relax<br>by the time I got in a permanent post<br>I realized that I was wrong for the<br>neoliberal revolution that was<br>decimating Social Democratic<br>institutions in my native land was<br>running wild in New Zealand<br>only this time bizarrely it was being<br>led by the labor party<br>deconstruction was the order of the day<br>and it was the institutions of the<br>Social Democratic state that were being<br>deconstructed by 1990s a mixed economy<br>progressive income tax free tertiary<br>education and the goal of Full<br>Employment had all gone by the board<br>there weren't many state-owned<br>Enterprises left to sell and though the<br>flat taxes had lost the battle in<br>1988 as Jane Kelsey points out they'd<br>effectively won the war New Zealand was<br>pretty close to a flat tax system<br>it was quite clear that the direction of<br>government policy was incompatible with<br>the fairer more just society that was<br>supposedly Labor's goal<br>now I wasn't a founder of the new labor<br>party but decided to join after the<br>disastrous first Conference held at the<br>waterfront terminal<br>having witnessed the Craven behavior of<br>Labor's loyal left I thought the new<br>labor party was the only hope for Social<br>Democratic politics in New Zealand and<br>having witnessed the attempted takeover<br>by trotskis I thought that the NLP lady<br>might help<br>I wanted to defend in my new country the<br>institutions that were being destroyed<br>well<br>for time by the way<br>right<br>just just thinking I'm going to do it<br>right<br>well to my mind the function as a new<br>labor party was clear to slow down stop<br>and eventually reverse the neoliberal<br>revolution to rebuild a Social<br>Democratic State somewhat amended to<br>meet change conditions that was what I<br>wanted out of the new labor party and<br>subsequently the alliance<br>well for 14 years 1989 to 2003 I devoted<br>a great deal of time trouble and effort<br>to the NLP and the alliance it was a<br>long story of struggle with many defeats<br>and a few very pyrrhic victories<br>in the end we did manage just about to<br>slow down and stop but not to reverse<br>the neoliberal revolution<br>we did this chiefly by forcing labor to<br>the left in order to compete with us for<br>Left for the left-wing vote<br>part of our problem<br>and I have former comrade Siri can<br>testify to this part of our part of our<br>problem was that Jim anderton the<br>party's leader was simultaneously the<br>greatest asset and the biggest liability<br>and it was never clear whether he was<br>more of an asset or more of a liability<br>once we were in office with labor he<br>preferred to take a softly this was you<br>know after the 1999 election<br>um a softly softly approach to our<br>Coalition Partners never making a stand<br>against their policies where we thought<br>they were wrong or in defense of our own<br>values preferring as I put it to do good<br>by stealth within the confines of the<br>cabinet run<br>this was losing its votes and a majority<br>of the party partly at my urging was<br>considering the option of exiting the<br>Coalition and pursuing a more<br>independent line in Parliament while<br>supporting labor on confidence and<br>supply<br>rather than giving out the seals of<br>office Anderson split the party<br>effectively destroying it<br>by the end of 2003 the alliance was to<br>all intents and purposes dead and I had<br>left it my political life was over and I<br>could return to philosophy with new vim<br>and vigor<br>now during those years I devoted a lot<br>of my leisure to politics though I<br>certainly worked full time at my<br>academic job I should stress this by the<br>way I don't consider electioneering as<br>part of my job<br>um<br>for me at least<br>lacking the Demonic energy of some<br>colleagues past and present it's<br>difficult to be an active researcher<br>without working evenings and weekends<br>now during<br>most of my many of my weekends and<br>evenings were devoted politics<br>that's during this period I was<br>deferring to my inner Bismarck rather<br>than indulging my philosophical<br>addiction and the consequence was that<br>my research career slowed if not to a<br>crawl then to a very sedate walk between<br>1996 and 2006 for instance I did not<br>publish a single Journal article<br>now I don't want to exaggerate during<br>this period<br>1989-2003 I published some of the<br>seminal papers<br>I think I can honestly say this on which<br>my reputation rests their citations ran<br>into the hundreds I became the world's<br>leading expert on the ethics of Burton<br>Russell I edited a prize-winning<br>collection of Russell's writings on<br>ethics with a 30 000 word commentary by<br>me I organized a conference on Noel from<br>ears and moral motivation that<br>eventually resulted in two books<br>nonetheless<br>for me they were years of relative<br>research inactivity the inner Bismarck<br>was extracting a high price from the<br>philosophy addict<br>but let's talk a bit about these papers<br>from now on<br>focusing on the work rather than the<br>life<br>well<br>they fall into I I read about quite a<br>lot of stuff but I'm just going to focus<br>on some of the sort of key areas<br>the first set of papers deal with David<br>hume's famous dictum that you can't get<br>an ought from an is a moral conclusion<br>from non-moral premises<br>this claim was widely taken to be gospel<br>and was supposed to do wonders in<br>particular it was supposed to establish<br>a fundamental split between facts and<br>values<br>but in 1960 the great New Zealand<br>philosopher Arthur Pryor perhaps<br>otago's most brilliant philosophical<br>graduate to date and we've had some<br>pretty brilliant ones I may add<br>proposed a tricky set of counting<br>samples it seemed that by Logic alone<br>you know nothing up your sleeve just<br>logic like just pure logic<br>um you could derive all claims from his<br>claims moral conclusions from non-moral<br>premises<br>now my first thought was that these<br>counter examples were not just counter<br>examples to the claim that you can't get<br>an all from an is but to the much more<br>General thesis that in a logically valid<br>argument you don't get out what you<br>haven't put in that in a logically valid<br>argument the conclusion is somehow<br>contained in the premises<br>so I reformulated and proved a revised<br>version of the containment thesis<br>if you have stuff content in the<br>conclusion of a logically valid<br>inference right it's in the conclusion<br>then it will be vacuous in a certain<br>sense that means you can replace it with<br>any old rubbish you like and you'll<br>thus And I stress I can prove this in a<br>logically valid argument you can't get<br>anything non-vacuous out that you<br>a revised version of no walk from is<br>follows as a special case no non-vacuous<br>all from is you can't get non-vacuous<br>moral conclusions from non-moral<br>premises<br>but<br>and here's the sort of perhaps the<br>interesting point<br>though I have Vindicated Noel from his I<br>have also trivialized it<br>the reason that you can't get a<br>non-vacuous ought from an is is you<br>can't get conclusions in which any term<br>appears non-vacuously in the conclusion<br>appears non-vaccuracy in the conclusion<br>from premises from which it is absence<br>absent for instance you can't get<br>conclusions in which the word Hedgehog<br>appears non-vaccuracy in the conclusion<br>unless the word Hedgehog appears in the<br>premises<br>no non-vacuous ultramares doesn't hold<br>because of special features of the<br>it holds because in a logically valid<br>argument you can't get anything<br>so although my revised version of Noel<br>for me it is not only true but provably<br>so<br>it doesn't<br>as many have thought establish a<br>fundamental split between fact and value<br>if there is such a split it has to be<br>so that's I think you know kind of<br>interesting a lot of people you know I<br>was I was a seminar with the economist<br>just a couple of weeks ago they were<br>going on about Noel from ears and<br>drawings sort of Fairly Grand<br>conclusions from um this this supposed<br>actually<br>trivial<br>but it's triviality itself is kind of<br>important right it's important that it's<br>trivial it is Trivial but that is<br>Trivial is kind of important right all<br>right<br>now as noted above a lot of Scholars on<br>the humanities are deeply convinced that<br>their research work isn't just a<br>contribution to culture but it's in some<br>sense socially useful and often<br>not always of course often they're<br>deluded but I rather hope that my work<br>on conspiracy theories is an exception<br>now<br>it's widely assumed<br>that conspiracy theories as such are<br>suspect crazy or unbelievable and that<br>conspiracy theorists are ipso facto<br>crazy dumb or intellectually deficient<br>to call someone a conspiracy theorist is<br>to suggest that there are several<br>um and both conspiracy theory and<br>conspiracy theorists are widely used as<br>terms of abuse<br>but if we Define a conspiracy theory as<br>a theory involving a conspiracy<br>a secret plan to influence events by<br>partly secret means<br>this Prejudice is absurd<br>why<br>because people frequently conspire<br>which means that a great many conspiracy<br>theories are straightforwardly true<br>and B<br>that many conspiracy theorists are<br>perfectly sensible believing or<br>entertaining<br>conspiracy theories that are true<br>plausible or along the right lines right<br>you can be a rational conspiracy<br>believer even though the conspiracy<br>theory you believe in isn't actually<br>true if it's you know the sort of thing<br>that might happen right<br>um and had Caesar been a conspiracy<br>theorist with respect to the<br>machinations of Brutus and Cassius<br>conclusion conspiracy theorists should<br>not be dismissed on block simply because<br>they are conspiracy theories they should<br>be considered on their merits<br>now<br>many conspiracy theories of course are<br>false crazy or unbelievable<br>but they're not false crazy or<br>unbelievable because they're conspiracy<br>theories<br>their false crazy are unbelievable<br>because they're false crazy or<br>unbelievable<br>why is this politically important<br>because the idea that conspiracy<br>theorists theories as such as somehow<br>suspect or unbelievable can be used by<br>real life conspirators to conceal their<br>conspiratory imaginations from critical<br>scrutiny sometimes allowing them to get<br>away with murder<br>witness Bush Blair and their partisans<br>who tended to brush aside allegations<br>that crucial dossiers have been sexed up<br>or that the threat of weapons of mass<br>destruction have been exaggerated or<br>manufactured<br>they dismiss such claims as conspiracy<br>theories and therefore not worth<br>considering<br>leading to a war which cost hundreds of<br>and very recently this is just stuff<br>I've been reading in the last few months<br>it's become clear that there's a link<br>between my philosophical ideas on<br>conspiracy theories and the struggle<br>against both neoliberalism and climate<br>change<br>the recent historical work<br>of Naomi oreskies and others has shown<br>that to a surprising degree at least in<br>America the neoliberal Revolution and<br>the campaign of climate change denial<br>were conspiratorial Affairs or at least<br>partly conspiratorial Affairs partly<br>planned and partly executed in secret<br>with<br>front organizations right<br>right and and and and things of that<br>sort carefully concealed<br>um funding from particular sources so as<br>to give the impression you know that<br>they were just a bunch of intellectuals<br>well whereas they were in fact a bunch<br>of intellectuals being funded by<br>um fairly dark sources<br>blind yourself to the reality of<br>conspiracies by using conspiracy<br>theories a term of abuse and you blind<br>yourself to the processes which brought<br>okay<br>I think I have more to say you know<br>but I can stop there<br>you've heard about my life and how I<br>thought about it and you've heard at<br>least a little bit about my work<br>so<br>I think I shall<br>bring my presentation to a halt<br>your name<br>question said anybody where's the<br>anybody want to ask me anything<br>or raise objections to some of my<br>I thought I was saying plenty of<br>right well we'll come back you can you<br>can confirm that<br>now I've been a few Recollections I I<br>tell you to Marvin who's an old comrade<br>of mine from the the alliance and new<br>labor party<br>Mike Charles if if you see good and bad<br>with the same Clarity that you see black<br>and white once you finally change your<br>mind and I find what you're a realist<br>I said that again if you see good and<br>bad with the same Clarity that you see<br>black and white can't you just change<br>well the problem is<br>I'm deeply convinced that it isn't true<br>right more realism for you know the the<br>the audience or not that's the view that<br>one<br>um moral judgments are in the truthful's<br>game and two<br>um that substantial numbers of them are<br>true because there really are moral<br>facts for moral judgments to correspond<br>to<br>so could I change my mind well um not<br>without violating my philosophical<br>conscience I might be as it were being<br>true to the sort of little boy who wants<br>to do his bit but I wouldn't be true to<br>the philosophical addict that I became<br>at age 20.<br>foreign<br>given by Nature<br>form of life for human beings which is a<br>okay<br>right do I think that there is<br>a good form of life that is given by<br>Nature no<br>basically no I don't think that to<br>answer that at length would require sort<br>of going at in in detail in my critique<br>of both the concept of an attributive<br>good which you're probably appealing to<br>yeah right and also to<br>um the idea that human beings have a<br>function<br>we don't<br>or at least if we do it's so vague and<br>open-ended that almost anything anybody<br>might do will countless fulfilling the<br>human function you know I mean anything<br>including terrible things right<br>um you're not<br>you're not failing to be a human being<br>your being by my lights are really bad<br>human being<br>finger on it<br>that's the same<br>um apply to our means of getting where<br>we get to<br>okay well again this would require a<br>longer answer right and I'm giving<br>people The Bare Bones of my theory but<br>um so going back to the word good right<br>I think the word good could be used<br>it's not ambiguous there's a range of<br>related meanings right so it's not that<br>it's just this kind of good over here<br>and this kind of good over there and<br>there's no nothing connecting them<br>between between them right<br>but um<br>uh in some contexts good can be used<br>naturalistically it can mean<br>something like<br>what this is a good X means something<br>like this is an X which fulfills the<br>requirements on X or does what X's are<br>supposed to do<br>and then<br>those requirements are in some sense<br>natural requirements like the means to<br>an end<br>um but good also is used in a<br>non-natural sense when you're suggesting<br>not merely that something is the means<br>to the end but the end is in some sense<br>right<br>and<br>um<br>I can say this to Grant right<br>because he's a philosopher um I do write<br>about this in my article gichon good<br>where I sort of basically sort of deal<br>with this problem at length<br>and I wrote that a long time ago I think<br>1988.<br>right I've got one from Marvin and then<br>don't you think<br>there's somebody<br>who believes that the universe<br>is<br>in his way good<br>and maybe even productive of information<br>and intelligence<br>is<br>useful and produces people like<br>Martin Luther King<br>also<br>and it is much more productive say than<br>nietzschees<br>philosophy<br>okay<br>um my answer these cannot be proven<br>right okay now here's what I'd say to<br>that Marvin<br>um this is a more General response right<br>Perpetual question but<br>look the fact that I don't think that<br>moralities were written into the nature<br>of things doesn't mean that I don't have<br>a reality right and that I can't<br>um uh evaluate things in terms of my<br>morality it's just I don't think these<br>things are ultimately Justified so I can<br>say things like well I much prefer the<br>monarchy Martin Luther King to um let's<br>say the morality of nature right I can<br>say that<br>um uh but uh what I can't say is that<br>Martin Luther King is absolutely good<br>and Nietzsche is absolutely bad all<br>right written to the nature things and<br>and I don't really just that everybody's<br>got a bit of good or bad evil I mean the<br>standards right I'm talking about the<br>standards<br>um<br>uh and there's somebody I haven't<br>mentioned here which you know to whom I<br>would like to pay tribute<br>which is Jim Flynn oh yes and as you<br>know many of you are probably aware you<br>know Jim has had a book called how to<br>defend Humane ideals and what that book<br>was about was saying well all right<br>there's no objective morality<br>nonetheless here are strategies that I<br>can use to defend a Humane ethic<br>and if you want to find out about that<br>you can either read his book or read uh<br>or or view my um in conversation with<br>Jim Flynn which is you know on YouTube<br>so<br>where we discuss this very issue<br>James<br>oh no somebody else<br>hi Charles I'm just thinking about the<br>the good and bad<br>um could we not say that it's a good to<br>resist uh destroying the means of our<br>very existence<br>well<br>you can say it<br>would you say it and I can say it in a<br>sense I I don't think there's you know<br>an objective requirement of the human<br>race should continue to exist I'm I'm<br>inclined to say if it didn't that would<br>be rather a Pity but you know uh<br>uh um uh there's not an objective<br>requirement there you know do you feel<br>like you've perhaps failed<br>sorry on what grounds then do you say<br>you've perhaps well I you know the<br>failure is with respect to a set of<br>so you know uh<br>I was a little boy and I read you know<br>this book about the history of the 20th<br>century and all the terrible things that<br>had happened and at the end was somebody<br>saying to the intelligent child like me<br>we're handing it over to you<br>and I kind of accepted the mission you<br>know in so far as it's reasonable to do<br>so and I am of The View<br>that we made a terrible mess of things<br>all right Charles<br>um James so I like what you say about<br>conspiracy theorists it's it's clearly<br>true there are real conspiracies and<br>conspiracy theorists seems a far too<br>strong a term that we can sling around<br>with abandon<br>um but I worry that there's a sort of<br>intellectual voice<br>um<br>so imagine that I'm the sort of person<br>who is so wedded to My Views I<br>desperately want something to be true<br>um there's no evidence for that thing<br>so I claim that there's evidence for it<br>that I don't know about we go looking<br>for it nobody finds it now I'm claiming<br>that people are hiding it<br>um it's part of a conspiracy that seems<br>like a a risky way for me to be and a<br>risky thing for me to be in the<br>community what are we going to call<br>people like me if not conspiracy<br>theorists okay<br>um I'm going to call you bad conspiracy<br>theorists<br>but look<br>look you know because remember this is a<br>sort of short presentation<br>I've got a paper in which I discuss<br>what are the features of a bad<br>conspiracy theory<br>and also I'm writing a paper<br>on the intellectual vices characteristic<br>of bad conspiracy theorists<br>so one of the things that makes a<br>conspiracy theory a bad one you know<br>likely to be false<br>um<br>is that it posits a conspiracy from<br>which it's easy to defect right it's<br>easy to defect from this alleged<br>conspiracy<br>and there have been no defections<br>that kind of conspiracy theory is<br>suspect<br>more generally and here I make a<br>concession to person that I I started<br>off opposing it's a slight concession<br>but it is a concession look there is an<br>intellectual Vice characteristic of I<br>think some conspiracy theorists<br>and what it basically is is always<br>looking for the uh for the explanation<br>of a bad thing happen happening in terms<br>of the intentions of bad agents<br>all right now<br>this isn't a theory right it's just a<br>thing people tend naturally to do and<br>they do it also in the context of<br>non-conspiratorial thinking so you know<br>I I had when on one of the philosophy<br>blogs there was a suggestion that the<br>reason that<br>um citations in philosophy are like this<br>there's a high narrow spiral a long flat<br>with lots of people getting a lot few<br>people getting a lot of citations and<br>lots of people getting hardly any<br>and the explanation of this was<br>it's all bad old philosophers not citing<br>young people<br>that's yesterday<br>no that's not the explanation it's an<br>invisible hand effect what happens is<br>more stuff is produced than anybody can<br>read so everybody has to adopt<br>strategies to ration their intake of<br>philosophy right if they're professional<br>philosophers<br>and what sort of strategies do you adopt<br>what sort of strategist everybody adopt<br>they<br>um they read stuff they have reason to<br>believe is good because it's done by<br>everybody's doing this<br>and the consequence is<br>that a few people who are reliable<br>producers get massive numbers of<br>citations and quite a lot of people who<br>might be just as good but haven't been<br>shown to be so get hardly any at all<br>so it's an invisible hand effect it's a<br>winner takes all sort of thing and my<br>talking about Winner Takes all the fact<br>and invisible hands you know this is one<br>of the things that you really get from<br>doing PPE you know you think in these<br>terms lots of people don't<br>they don't apply to themselves either<br>right<br>right but you know the Invisible Hand<br>could be lifting you up or swatting you<br>down<br>invisible hand mechanisms are real as<br>are hidden hand or conspiratorial<br>mechanisms they both operate in human<br>history<br>okay<br>well good evening Tina kotokatoa um my<br>name is Jessica Palmer I Am A manukuro<br>or takiti aranui so the PVC of the<br>humanities<br>um and it's my pleasure to close the<br>evening and to formally thank Charles<br>for his address strict instructions from<br>him not so much at all because the Q a<br>was far more important and I think we<br>appreciated that so thank you Charles<br>but I do want to abuse my privilege and<br>say two things<br>um so the first one is is that I think<br>what we saw in front of us was a<br>demonstration of exactly what<br>um Zach commended you on earlier that<br>you encouraged younger Scholars by<br>asking hard questions by deeply and<br>enthusiastically committing to an<br>inquiry and what I loved about what you<br>did tonight was you did that to yourself<br>you there's a sense of you're not being<br>entirely happy with where you stand on<br>particular issues and that is the<br>academic Endeavor so thank you Charles<br>um and secondly I guess I wanted to note<br>the irony that the two bookings of this<br>evening represent the evil of University<br>management<br>so the DVC research starts us off in the<br>PVC Humanity ends it but I think it's<br>appropriate to recognize that many of<br>you will know that internally within<br>this University Charles has played<br>are really important and really valued<br>role in trying to call out things that<br>he is not happy about<br>and unfortunately because he ran out of<br>time he didn't get to talk about a<br>couple of those roles but he does<br>mention in the written version<br>um his sense of failure<br>um you know ask examples of failure one<br>of them being his failure on Council and<br>I I just want to take a moment to say is<br>the PVC and often as the recipient of<br>all staff emails that Charles can send<br>out every so often when he feels very<br>strongly about an issue I want to<br>commend you for that I don't think<br>you've been a failure at all I can<br>understand a sense of failure me how to<br>achieve everything you'd hoped to<br>achieve in that role<br>but it's really important this<br>university community that we continue to<br>listen to each other and engage and so I<br>want to commend you as someone sitting<br>in University management and someone who<br>inevitably you end up battling with on<br>certain issues<br>that you are an important part of this<br>community and you have not been a<br>failure on many fronts at all and to<br>thank you for that and to affirm you for<br>that<br>so I hope you've enjoyed this evening I<br>certainly have it remains for me to<br>invite you over to the staff Club to<br>celebrate with Charles and his family to<br>share Refreshments with them and to<br>congratulate on him on his achievement<br>and his his many achievements alongside<br>failures and failures are not all bad so<br>a huge thank you from me and from the<br>University leadership and<br>congratulations to you Charles on a<br>professorship well deserved kyota</p></main><footer style="margin-top:
