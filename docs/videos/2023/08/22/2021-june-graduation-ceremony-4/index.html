recognizes this by making Awards each<br>year to teachers who have demonstrated<br>excellence in the aspects of teaching<br>these awards are contestable across the<br>university and signify a truly Superior<br>performance<br>an award for excellence in sustained<br>excellence in teaching has been made to<br>Dr Brendan Dunphy<br>from the school of biological sciences<br>within the faculty of science<br>I call upon a student of that faculty<br>Mina Welford to read the citation for Dr<br>foreign<br>s experience a point in their degrees<br>when the pressures of Life simply proves<br>too much<br>the mounting weight of deadlines fear of<br>disappointment and shame over being<br>considered incapable can be crippling<br>in these moments what we need most is<br>compassion<br>for me this moment came during a second<br>year field trip when the pressures I<br>placed on myself were so great it<br>reduced me to tears<br>as a teacher and as a friend Brendan<br>offered compassion in a time I needed it<br>most<br>while this idea of teaching often<br>condures thoughts of knowledge and<br>wisdom it is Brendan's heart that makes<br>him a truly exceptional teacher<br>he recognizes teaching is as much<br>listening as it is talking which allows<br>students the space to grow<br>everything he does he approaches with a<br>men's passion integrity and a<br>light-hearted humor<br>despite his extensive workload Brenda<br>never allows vanity or ego to influence<br>his work<br>combined these attributes encourage<br>students not only to become great<br>scientists but great people<br>I could not think of anyone more<br>deserving of this award than Brendan<br>thank you for your guidance your<br>mentorship and patience congratulations<br>oh<br>God<br>an award for excellence in early career<br>excellence and teaching has been made to<br>Mrs Anna Marie Ferguson from the<br>Department of Statistics within the<br>faculty of science<br>I call upon a student of that faculty<br>Mercy lalua to read the citation for Mrs<br>foreign<br>it is an honor to witness Anna Ferguson<br>be the recipient of the teaching<br>Excellence award I was fortunate enough<br>to have Emma as one of my very first<br>lecturers here at the University in 2018<br>coming straight into the university it<br>was a very isolating change yet Anna is<br>a lecturer whether she knew or not<br>helped smoothen that transition<br>her unique and inventive approach and<br>style of teaching engages and captivates<br>not only her students but also her<br>colleagues and other teachers she<br>engages her students through the use of<br>innovative pedagogy technology and<br>situational context her open and<br>friendly demeanor makes her a very<br>approachable individual and lecturer<br>her exceptional patience and great<br>understanding allows for students to<br>grow through their own curiosity of the<br>subject and promotes for a discovery<br>driven learning one of Anna's<br>outstanding teaching abilities is to<br>keep the content creative fun and<br>relevant to our times while still being<br>sensitive and compassionate it is 100 a<br>fact that you will see at least one<br>image of a kitten throughout her<br>lectures we have used Play-Doh eaten<br>jelly beans and marshmallows or to learn<br>about probability and chance and I quote<br>if you like it you should put a<br>confidence interval on it<br>and his achievements are not only<br>limited to what happens inside the<br>lecture rooms but also outside some<br>examples of this includes being the<br>statistical keynote speaker at the 2019<br>New Zealand Association of mathematics<br>Teachers Conference she has served as a<br>liaison with the USA American<br>statistical Association National Council<br>of teachers of mathematics committee for<br>the purpose of promoting better teaching<br>of statistics and she has also given<br>presentations at four national<br>conferences as a student aiming to be a<br>teacher I have been blessed to have<br>learned and worked with Anna who<br>exemplifies<br>great attributes of an enthusiastic<br>passionate and effective lecturer thank<br>you<br>foreign<br>award for excellence and sustained<br>excellence and teaching has been made to<br>associate professor Elizabeth Peterson<br>from the School of Psychology within the<br>faculty of science<br>I call upon a student of that faculty<br>Rudolfo Villanueva to read the citation<br>for associate professor Elizabeth<br>Peterson<br>Dr Liz Peterson<br>is pretty cool<br>this is honest and straightforward with<br>us students always gently nudging us to<br>consider different perspectives what's<br>beautiful is that she doesn't do this in<br>an overbearing or restrictive way<br>Liz challenges her class to take off<br>their Western lens and critique our<br>presumptions about human development as<br>a teacher she not only makes the strange<br>familiar but the familiar strange<br>Liz has the Hallmark of an exceptional<br>teacher she goes the extra mile for her<br>students ensuring they receive thorough<br>feedback on their work thereby giving<br>them the necessary springboard for<br>improvement<br>she does what all the best teachers<br>should do<br>she inspires when she teaches she's not<br>afraid to show her vulnerability she<br>masterfully weaves her own story into<br>her teaching inspiring students to do<br>the same for their learning<br>Liz sees something special in students<br>and undertakes the task of conjuring<br>cohesion and purpose out of them the<br>task of any great mentor<br>at the privilege of being supervised by<br>Lucifer research project<br>as someone who got kicked out of high<br>school for thawing a sausage roll at the<br>principal<br>I never thought I'd have a place in<br>Academia<br>Liz's belief in me meant everything<br>let's talk about the value of answering<br>questions and questioning answers<br>Liz help me silence the doubts
