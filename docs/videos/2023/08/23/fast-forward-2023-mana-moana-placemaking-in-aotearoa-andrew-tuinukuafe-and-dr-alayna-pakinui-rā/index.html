Mana Moana reinforces connected genealogies of Māori and Pacific peoples across deep time and space beyond the shores of Aotearoa, New Zealand. <br><br>How do we better enable placemaking and cultural identity through the built environment? What can we do to enable the wellbeing of Indigenous communities of the present time? How does the profession of architecture respond to these cultural shifts across the Trans-Tasman?<br><br>The three lectures aim to provoke, educate and inspire our conversations about placemaking, cultural positioning and the transformational possibilities of architecture.<br>-<br>About the talk and speakers:<br>Dr Alayna Pakinui Rā<br>Alayna is of Ngāi Tahu whakapapa and was born and raised on Ngāi Tahu whenua in Ōtepoti and Ōtautahi. She is a strong advocate for Indigenous rights and ensuring mana whenua agency prevails in planning, design and construction processes. Alayna has extensive experience working with Indigenous communities locally and internationally, with her work focusing on social justice and equitable city making. In this presentation she will speak to the future of Aotearoa and the changes we are facing culturally, socially, environmentally, and economically.<br><br>Andrew Tu‘inukuafe<br>Kāinga | Collective<br>In this talk, Andrew reflects on 30 years of practice as an architect of Tongan descent having worked on architecture as a collective practice, illustrated through selected projects from around Aotearoa, New Zealand and the Pacific. Collectively, Andrew and his many collaborators have amplified Indigenous Moana voices and their connections, between people, places and ideas. Andrew firmly believes that the future of architectural practice in New Zealand lies in embracing our place within the Pacific. Andrew is a graduate of the University of Auckland and Architectural Association. Having worked in the US and UK, Andrew is now a Principal, and the Group Chair, of Warren and Mahoney, working across Te Moana-nui-a-Kiwa.<br><br>00:00<br>0:18 GIB Tauranga facility <br>02:58 Welcome<br>12:43 Dr Alayna Pakinui Rā<br>41:21 Andrew Tu‘inukuafe<br>1:11:14 Discussion<br>-<br>Follow our socials! <br>Instagram: https://www.instagram.com/uoacreatives/<br>Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/UoACreatives<br>Tik Tok: https://www.tiktok.com/@uoacreatives<br><br>Keep up to date with new #UoACreatives content and events here: https://linktr.ee/uoacreatives</p><h2>Transcript</h2><p style="opacity: 0.9; font-size: 0.8em">Transcripts may be automatically generated and may not be 100% accurate.</p><p>No transcript available</p></main><footer style="margin-top: 2rem; background: #0001; padding: 2rem; text-align: center;"><p>We Are The University</p><ul style="list-style-type: none; padding: 0; margin: 0;"><li><a href="/">Home</a></li><li><a href="/about">About</a></li><li><a href="/contact">Contact</a></li></ul></footer></body></html>
