Grant<br>Robertson I'm the vice Chancellor of the<br>univers of atago for those who haven't<br>met me uh I want to welcome you all here<br>colleagues visitors members of the denin<br>community those here in person and<br>online to this very special occasion<br>where we come together to celebrate the<br>promotion of Professor Tony Moore to our<br>highest academic position and to hear<br>something of the Mahi that has made this<br>happen through his inaugural prophal<br>lecture this is a special occasion for<br>Tony and his o and I want to<br>particularly acknowledge his wife<br>kirston daughter Alex Sons Danny and KAC<br>and I understand cormac's not with us uh<br>because he is playing football in Christ<br>Church they did win today so that's a<br>positive uh positive thing um we are<br>also hopefully joined online by Tony's<br>mom aore his sister Maria Champion<br>husband Alan and their two sons Thomas<br>and Lewis hi Mom on online Faro play a<br>huge part in the success of anyone who<br>is working at the highest level in their<br>career there are many sacrifices much<br>love and support and I'd like us now to<br>support this occasion represents not<br>just the opportunity to acknowledge a<br>well-deserved and hard one promotion but<br>also to understand more about Tony's<br>work and his contribution to society as<br>a university our job is to provide the<br>highest quality research and teaching<br>and there is no doubt that Tony has done<br>this he has been recognized nationally<br>and internationally on numerous<br>occasions for his research and has<br>consistently been well regarded by<br>students for his<br>teaching beyond that universities have a<br>wider role in helping to explain<br>critique and transform society and it's<br>in this part of Tony's work that I want<br>to acknowledge Him particularly you all<br>know what his speciality is and he made<br>the move from it to surveying to take<br>his understanding of technology to<br>something much more maps literally guide<br>us but they also can explain and shift<br>our understanding Tony's translating the<br>world around us into forms that can lead<br>us to understand the world better to<br>reimagine it he is literally presenting<br>our world or worlds as we might be about<br>to find out to us and asking us to think<br>again to challenge our assumptions and<br>to give us new insights that is the<br>difference that we can make at a<br>university it requires researchers<br>teachers and leaders such as Tony to<br>make that a reality so thank you Tony<br>for leading in that way so in that<br>Spirit again it is my great pleasure to<br>welcome you all here this evening to the<br>inaugural professorial lecture of<br>Professor Anthony breetz Tony Moore I<br>will shortly hand over to Professor<br>Richard Barker our Pro Vice Chancellor<br>for the division of Sciences to more<br>fully introduce Tony but once again you<br>are welcome in person and online<br>otoo tenot<br>Vice Chancellor tqu Deputy Vice<br>chancellors tenor Professor Moore ten<br>distinguished Professor halber ten<br>friends and colleagues tenot tenot tenot<br>it is my great pleasure to introduce our<br>speaker tonight Professor Anthony Moore<br>from the school of surveying to give his<br>inaugural professorial elure at the<br>University of otago as indicated by the<br>Vice Chancellor Tony was promoted to<br>professor and in February this year and<br>tonight we get to celebrate this<br>significant<br>achievement Professor Moore was born in<br>Margate Kent in the United Kingdom now I<br>had to go to maps for this presentation<br>of course and from that I discovered<br>that Margate is not far from such<br>wonderfully named places as<br>snodland PLU Gutter and pet bottom and<br>apparently James Bond lived in pet<br>bottom with his aunt after he was uh<br>orphant Professor Moore completed his<br>secondary schooling at chattam house<br>grammar school in Ramsgate thereby<br>ascending to the ranks of the old<br>rians among such distinguished company<br>as Edward Heath former prime minister of<br>the United Kingdom and a bevy of high<br>ranking military officers and clergy<br>such as the most Reverend venables the<br>Archbishop primate of South America<br>distinguished company<br>indeed after receiving his Bachelor of<br>Science with honors from the University<br>of Portsmouth Tony undertook a master of<br>science at the University of Leicester<br>before going on to complete his PhD at<br>Plymouth his PhD was on the application<br>of spatial expert systems to integrated<br>coastal zone management and as such it<br>applies one of the first very primitive<br>forms of artificial intelligence and<br>spatial<br>analysis in preparing for these events I<br>always ask for something personal<br>unusual that I can share and Tony<br>volunteered that between undertaking his<br>Masters and PhD he he spent a year<br>working as a data manager for fisa and<br>while at fisa he worked on the<br>development of<br>Viagra I'm not sure what more I can say<br>about that so I'll leave it at<br>that Tony and Kiren moved to New Zealand<br>a month after their wedding in 2001 an<br>Tony joined what was then our<br>information science department initially<br>as a research assistant and then as a<br>lecturer before he moved to the<br>surveying in 2008 so tonight we<br>celebrate this progression fully through<br>the academic ranks from<br>research uh assistant to<br>professor as we have heard from the vice<br>Chancellor promotion to full professor<br>at the University of otago is far from<br>Easy you must excel in all of the<br>academic domains of teaching research<br>and service and Professor Moore has<br>truly<br>excelled Tony is a geographical<br>information science specialist with a<br>particular interest in spatial<br>communication through Maps and other<br>geographical visual<br>visualizations as a researcher he is<br>productive and his research has impact<br>and his career to date he has edited two<br>books has contributed 15 book chapters<br>and 68 Journal<br>articles a standout feature of Professor<br>Moore's research is its<br>interdisciplinary nature and breath his<br>work has covered applications that<br>include Bluff oysters New Zealand sea<br>liines parasitology coastal zone<br>management active Transportation among<br>School children bicycles and walking Etc<br>and the use of cartoons to better<br>understand Geographic perceptions of<br>soldiers while serving in gipo during<br>World War I his recent work includes the<br>use of spatial analysis of indigenous<br>farming systems using traditional moldy<br>knowledge in particular to establish and<br>consolidate landbased links with tipa<br>ancestors and to D why a place of<br>belonging as a teacher Professor Moore<br>has led GE geospatial information<br>science at the University of otago since<br>he<br>joined his teaching is characterized as<br>being research Le which of course is a<br>key imperative of University teaching<br>but even so it stands out when it's well<br>executed and one of the things he<br>strives to do is to bring in outside<br>expertise to ensure that students are<br>exposed to teaching by domain<br>experts his teaching was recognized in<br>2016 by the education and professional<br>New Zealand geospatial excellence awards<br>and also has received recognition from<br>the University of otago Stu the otago<br>university Students Association o USA<br>having been nominated for an O USA<br>inclusiveness and teaching award in<br>2013 and a disability awareness and<br>inclusive teaching award in<br>2016 service is the third domain in<br>which applicants must Excel to be<br>promoted to full professor and this<br>includes Services service to the<br>university as well as to the<br>professional community<br>and in his professional Community Tony<br>serves as the president of the New<br>Zealand cartographic society and has<br>been an active member of the<br>international C cgraphics<br>Association for some time and in 2014<br>the International Association awarded<br>him a presidential pin for his<br>long-standing cardgraphic research<br>conference organization and<br>participation his University Service<br>reflects the multi-disciplinary nature<br>of his research which is reported<br>applications of GIS Technologies in<br>numerous departments across all the<br>academic divisions of the University he<br>also has an eye for detail and this sees<br>him as an important member of The<br>Sciences standing committee and for<br>those in the know this is a critically<br>important group that do the heavy<br>lifting in regard to academic oversight<br>of the division's teaching<br>programs but perhaps his most<br>significant service role I've left to<br>last in the beginning of 2023 Tony took<br>over as the dean of the school of<br>surveying<br>this is our national school of surveying<br>and the dean has the important job of<br>not just overseeing a key Department in<br>the division in the University but also<br>in looking after the interests of the<br>surveying profession in a New Zealand<br>this task is something that Tony has<br>taken to with his customary calm and<br>consultative manner can I offer my<br>personal gratitude for this<br>work but I think that's enough for me<br>it's now time to hear for Professor<br>Moore himself so please join me and<br>welcoming Professor Anthony<br>Moore many thanks<br>thanks<br>tenoa Co Anthony Moore<br>Tangi to faka papanga<br>to fena<br>T to<br>manur<br>wur<br>tatoa um well thank you um I'm honored<br>to be here um and now I just got to<br>explain why I'm here<br>uh so um as as as has been very<br>eloquently expressed um um I'm all about<br>maps and uh and um you before I go on I<br>I should I should kind of um Express how<br>you very touched I'm see you family um<br>friends colleagues here and and no doubt<br>online um<br>maps and not maps necessarily that uh<br>we'd recognize um as is also been<br>alluded<br>to so inner and outer worlds uh you're<br>going to see<br>those um an alternative title might be<br>uh maps of<br>Beyond here's a map um so this is a map<br>in development I hoped it would be uh<br>a lot more developed than this um it's<br>it's a bit of a hybrid and I'll use it<br>to uh to to basically uh chart my<br>journey geographically at least so um I<br>start off over here uh this is Ramsgate<br>that's Margate this is the a of fet and<br>this is East<br>Kent<br>um and this is uh me as a kid when I won<br>the handwriting competition those who<br>seem handwriting nowadays I took I took<br>about five minutes to write that um well<br>no that's a bit of a laugh but anyway uh<br>22 I bought uh yeah this map of the<br>local area and uh this pencil as well<br>with with the remains uh reconstruction<br>because I've of course long since lost<br>it um and so yeah maps have been with me<br>uh since the beginning and this is the<br>and yeah during my childhood I I kind of<br>tried some things out so I used that map<br>to uh create kind of physical models of<br>of the local<br>area um so this is a thanet in all its<br>glory<br>and uh I attempted the area to the south<br>of uh that that area here but I kind of<br>uh left it unfinished it was a bit bit<br>too incate uh it's um it's the do area<br>uh I kind of ran out time and went to<br>University so that's the whole thing<br>there so I was making Maps uh this is<br>another map um that I made and uh this<br>is kind of indicative of of the the<br>kinds of maps I'll show later on um yeah<br>it's a Monopoly board it's it's very<br>kind of um localized to<br>Ramsgate and it's a bit of a mental map<br>really because I've I've kind of<br>prioritized certain areas like for<br>instance where Mayfair should be as the<br>CAC where I used to live and uh where<br>jail is supposed to be uh is uh that<br>selfs same grammar<br>school it can't be that bad though<br>because I'm here<br>so um so I guess I put this up here kind<br>of really just to say that Maps aren't<br>just the kinds of maps you you buying<br>you know um Outward Bound stores and and<br>wit calls and so on but there also can<br>come in many<br>forms so we return to this um unlabeled<br>map and we move from uh East Kent uh to<br>various areas um this one here this is<br>actually the coast of Field Land but<br>this uh this island is actually<br>unfamiliar um this is actually porty<br>Island this is the University of<br>Portsmouth where I did my undergrad and<br>this is um here's Plymouth sound and and<br>Plymouth itself part of the Southwest<br>Peninsula it's been rotated and so<br>and somewhere in in interior is<br>Leicester I I don't know where um so so<br>leester is where I did my masters and<br>ply where in my PhD and this just kind<br>of charts my uh kind of uh growth one of<br>the first things I re realized was that<br>uh when I moved out of the house um<br>basically could make maps with computers<br>uh and this is where in Portsmouth I was<br>ined at GIS and um you saw that physical<br>elevation model of East Kent I was kind<br>of making uh localized uh kind of<br>coastal models like this um uh part of<br>my undergraded disseration to measure<br>erosion using<br>photographs and of course um kind of<br>fast forward uh kind of over 30 years<br>later you know where's GIS now it's<br>basically everywhere uh so anyone with a<br>a smartphone able to access Google Maps<br>there's ual GIS right there and we<br>almost use it without thinking about it<br>um and of course digital GIS is is<br>everywhere and GS will pop up geographic<br>information systems will pop up uh<br>regularly uh<br>today<br>I did degrees in geography uh so so um<br>my my my journey has been a varied one<br>um so I first came to the information<br>science departments and now I'm in the<br>school surveying I just wanted to<br>outline my my place in surveying and my<br>credentials in surveying this is all<br>this is all coming from the 90s uh so I<br>uh uh helping helping my lecturer um<br>collection data in in West Wales that's<br>that's me there with um well I believe<br>it a total<br>station um I did summer summer project<br>uh uh after after my undergrad um I<br>stuck stuck around for a while helping<br>map this Harbor using aerial photographs<br>and to do that I kind of went out into<br>the into the deep mud uh with with uh<br>kind of newly minted G GPS<br>receivers and for our PhD I did some<br>more Ground Control work uh went to the<br>east coast of the UK and yeah collected<br>some points that allowed me who creates<br>3D<br>models uh like this one here of of hold<br>s are very rapidly uh receding Coastline<br>this is part of that kind of um<br>primitive AI based PhD where applied<br>expert systems to castone<br>management so that's that's that's my<br>surveying career<br>there and then fast forward in 2001 uh<br>as as as as you've heard uh we move to<br>the this area here which is not no<br>longer D Dess in yes Southeast Kent uh<br>it's morphed into the taret peninsula<br>and uh<br>denen and really um kind of to cut a a<br>long story short um I kind of spent a<br>while away from my main theme today<br>which is all about Maps um spatial Ai<br>and so on and and really while into Iden<br>it was really um encountering this guy<br>late the late Eagle<br>dreki uh University of Oakland then um<br>who who who really kind of um introduced<br>me to to the world of New Zealand maps<br>and beyond that to the world of<br>international mapmaking and and there<br>really the kind of um propellant behind<br>a lot what you're going to see uh<br>today so there Eagle there and the uh<br>the the kind of products of that Society<br>New Zealand cardgraphic<br>Society uh<br>newsletters uh this is a monograph of um<br>previous de of surveying John Hannah uh<br>is his notes on uh projections and<br>datums of New Zealand and a few research<br>books and and proceedings produced by<br>our<br>society uh this is uh an illustration of<br>the main IA conference the<br>ICC uh with with a few uh kiwi<br>representing the country uh we got Eagle<br>there with Jeff Akin the previous<br>president of the society and the<br>biannual conference uh so this is a bit<br>of an ADV<br>actually um I just wanted to put this up<br>here really because um because because<br>really it's put me on the path um I<br>found myself on now um just just<br>encountering Igor in the<br>society I want to rewind a bit just<br>really to explain what the hell these<br>are doing here um I'll be returning to<br>these uh in a bit but um while in<br>Leicester I was introduced to uh deeper<br>computational uh aspects of geographic<br>information science in particular it<br>kind of forced me through computers to<br>look at the world in different<br>ways uh and among such revelatory<br>techniques um and and and models is this<br>octahedron like this it might not make<br>much sense when I say it but there are<br>reasons the octahedron is is actually<br>quite a nice um summary of the world it<br>makes it less curved as well which is<br>always a lot<br>simpler um and also computationally it's<br>it it actually makes it easier to store<br>data um and ideas like that fascinated<br>me um so this octahedron with its<br>triangular facets can be subdivided into<br>kind of smaller and smaller triangular<br>facets to basically capture the world at<br>whatever scale is needed so if you got<br>Pacific Ocean with not much going on uh<br>for for for hundreds of kilometers then<br>you got a large triangular facet<br>capturing all that if you got somewhere<br>like Oakland where there is basically<br>literally millions of objects to capture<br>then you can divide uh down to INF<br>infinitesimally um small facets to<br>capture that too and um yeah it kind of<br>struck a cord with me and uh so so so<br>wherever you see maps this computational<br>okay and so we move to an outer World<br>okay this is uh our world<br>and uh it actually represents uh the<br>world uh if all the ice caps and<br>glassiers melted so there's some<br>estimates uh one from the USGS that says<br>that the sea level rise 70 M if that<br>happened and so um I modeled that on on<br>a digital elevation model of the world<br>and this is this is what we came up with<br>um I put it here because um I want to<br>stress<br>that maps are<br>important um maps are Supreme graphical<br>communicators of the most<br>pressing uh Global challenges we<br>encounter and so while this is uh<br>hopefully will never<br>happen and uh yeah if it does it's<br>millions of years away<br>um yeah it it's it's it's up there kind<br>of just to say that that the map um uh<br>is highly effective and it always has<br>been it Segways into a maren project<br>that I'm I'm Pi of at the moment uh<br>working with an excellent team Ivan<br>Quinn uh Greg Simon Owen and others uh<br>this is the Strand project which uh<br>tries to um with the best sea level rise<br>projections we have today tries to kind<br>of<br>anticipate uh and model uh the effect on<br>property um uh values uh to the end of<br>the century and so behind that are these<br>kind of conventional Maps so these These<br>are pretty much the only conventional<br>Maps you'll see in this presentation I<br>wanted to start somewhere<br>grounded um and so we got a a standard<br>elevation model uh you can see how South<br>and is surrounded by Higher Ground the<br>dunes to the South and so on um and next<br>to it is a model representing ratable<br>value that the the the property and its<br>value that might be lost to the<br>Sea and we're exploring various aspects<br>with um um particularly the the<br>financial modelers um Ivan and Quinn<br>about what it might mean if say the<br>smallest bit of a property is actually<br>flooded um what properties will be<br>affected uh then or perhaps it'll take<br>rather more of the property actually the<br>building within the property to be 10%<br>flood in this case with a 30 cm assumed<br>rise to to model the the floor of the<br>building so we are generating lots of<br>maps basically uh through this project<br>and you know I i' wager there important<br>Maps as as they are<br>elsewhere um the power and influence and<br>maps<br>as always been with us of course we've<br>got uh the computational power we hold<br>you know through our phones and access<br>to um U map interfaces like uh Google<br>Maps and Google Earth and open street<br>map you name it but um yeah ever since<br>um uh early Maps this is the Mada<br>projection um devised yeah so that<br>Navigators can can navigate uh across<br>the sea in a straight line uh using this<br>map<br>um this this this is an enabler of of<br>progress uh and very powerful in its own<br>right and just to kind of illustrate how<br>Maps affect our thinking um why why we<br>seeing Maps like<br>this um you what why is North up um you<br>know North being up is is is basically<br>assumed but um but really what I'm<br>saying is that Maps form a large part of<br>our our mental model and and are kind of<br>think I'm now going to start step away<br>from those kind of normal Maps um this<br>is something I've been toying with of<br>the last six months or so um and in<br>particular it's really to um highlight<br>you one of those global challenges in<br>that um there a tendency that if you are<br>a small land<br>mass<br>um you you get unnoticed okay um so it's<br>happened throughout history I I I'll<br>before the end I'll I'll pick on another<br>instance um why don't we make maps that<br>basically highlight these Pacific<br>Nations and dependencies that are under<br>threat from sea level rise so they<br>become more<br>noticeable a lot of unfamiliar shapes<br>here and um this this kind of effort<br>through what known as small multiples<br>small Maps within the whole map um are<br>designed uh to kind of bring them to<br>public Consciousness okay this is a work<br>in progress you'll see some of the uh<br>some of our maps are pretty Elementary<br>I'm going to I'm going to get better<br>data for those but uh I I'll be working<br>on that over the next couple of<br>months but really it's it's a kind of<br>Step away from our normal map um another<br>step away is a frequent uh instance<br>especially in a data Rich age such as<br>this is that there's too much data to<br>fit into a conventional<br>map um this is from the uh the beat<br>study so built uh environment and active<br>transport to school study which um I I<br>provided uh GIS and map support for and<br>this is the flow map of uh<br>adolescent uh high school students and<br>their route to school and basically The<br>Wider the line the more students<br>actually traveled along those uh roads<br>to school um and here we see those<br>schools highlighted kings and queens<br>high school here we got the three inner<br>city schools um in hilders and clumber<br>and so on uh up there but you see that<br>in these areas that the map gets<br>cluttered and so I'm exploring with uh<br>expanding space basically pulling space<br>apart so as to let the data flow in and<br>for my solution I get inspiration from<br>uh cardig grams and so in the recent uh<br>UK<br>elections uh you you'll see maps like<br>this from the financial times where uh<br>the biggest electoral District in the<br>highlands of Scotland is equal in size<br>to the smallest electoral District in<br>the middle of London and this this this<br>highlights uh basically what each<br>district voted and you can see quite<br>clearly the move from a blue<br>conservative to to a red labor um uh in<br>in this recent um<br>election and<br>so this uses a similar principle to pull<br>apart space so as to allow<br>uh this kind of congested um commuter<br>speak and I've used it in in other<br>instances as well with with with with<br>Kirk um a kidney<br>physiologist uh we've got here a uh<br>pulled apart space which reflects the<br>dissemination of a kidney analysis<br>technique from where was devised in<br>Washington to where researchers and<br>students took them to uh to to to<br>basically work on the technique<br>themselves most of them were in the<br>states so I pulled apart the states to<br>make these kind of routes uh to the West<br>Coast and to Texas and so on apparent<br>but I still retained the rest of the<br>world so you got Japan up here and<br>Europe over here in South Africa and<br>South America and so<br>on and I applied a similar<br>um principle to our most recent review<br>and surveying too um same thing these<br>are the members the the good staff the<br>excellent staff of the school<br>surveying and their collaborations and<br>links as you might expect most are<br>within the<br>university and a few more are within New<br>Zealand so I pulled apart in New Zealand<br>to make those um apparent and the rest<br>of the world is is around it Europe is<br>basically starting here with Portugal<br>and going right the way around to scan<br>here so the principle is yeah you can<br>step away from your conventional map and<br>apart okay but space isn't all um what<br>if pulling apart space is not enough if<br>the data demand something else what<br>happens um so this is Judy's PhD uh data<br>here uh so Judy Roder collected lots of<br>data of dolphin tracks over two years<br>and here they all are some 50 dolphins<br>in toara Bay um and here time is<br>important so um I you know the same<br>solution of pulling apart toay to make<br>room for all that data didn't make us<br>much sense in this case um Judy was<br>interested in the in the temporal<br>behavior of these dolphins and so<br>required so let's illustrate a solution<br>here um so we got 50 Dolphins here we<br>selected six Dolphins here uh with their<br>paths through space over two years we<br>split them into Seasons so eight seasons<br>in two<br>years and we basically represent each of<br>those seasons in turn in a diagram and<br>so I illustrate the building of that<br>diagram right now uh highlight in blue<br>are the three dolphins that were seen in<br>the first<br>season um dolphin 232 134 and 183 don't<br>apparently I'm and we summarize them by<br>we then try and calculate the shortest<br>path that will pass through each<br>position and through the traveling<br>salesperson problem which I don't have<br>time to go into right now but it's it's<br>a well-known uh computational um<br>solution to to such<br>things we try and work out the shortest<br>path this one's quite simple um having<br>done that we've got a sequence of<br>in a part of a diagram this is the first<br>season here um<br>232 is on the path to 134 to<br>183 the white space in between denote<br>the distance between those<br>dots so what we're going to do is<br>really um if dolphins are close together<br>in the season have them Clos together in<br>the diagram then comes season two we can<br>then look at where those dolphins are<br>next plot a path through those dots and<br>then represent that in the next<br>season and we can see the trajectory of<br>the Dolphins as they move relative to<br>each other in general season to<br>season and so we can move through the<br>seasons in this way and build up the<br>diagram seeing how Dolphins change<br>relative to each<br>other and it's just a way if you recall<br>that a mess of a map that I showed you<br>at the start it's a way of making sense<br>so that's far easier to read than six um<br>space-time paths it's if we now return<br>to this full population of 50 Dolphins<br>then we come up with something like<br>this um so it's not something to kind of<br>appreciate at a glance but something to<br>pour over um and so we can pick up<br>instances like this with dolphins in<br>Orange here moving broadly in the same<br>direction and generally close to each<br>other other okay uh things that are<br>impossible to pick out from<br>here this isn't of course the the only<br>solution to time intensive<br>data um we can actually give time its<br>own Dimension that that that we can do<br>that I've I've only been dealing with<br>two Dimensions we got third why not use<br>it uh this is a very old idea coming out<br>of human geography by torsson harrand uh<br>uh Swedish human geographer and uh<br>basically wanted to kind of draw<br>attention to the individual space time<br>Paths of of people how they how they<br>kind of interact with each other and so<br>we've got the basic uh graphical element<br>of the lifeline this is the path of<br>someone through SpaceTime a vertical<br>line means someone's not moving they're<br>moving just through time and if they<br>kind of have a trajectory across space<br>they are moving somewhere where also<br>Through Time Of<br>course and so um we've been playing<br>around with this and actually the the<br>actual project Peter wigam in in face of<br>science uh was Pi of that got me to new<br>Ze in the first place uh before becoming<br>a lecturer uh was really applying uh GIS<br>and as it turns out this to Sport and<br>rugby and uh basically the space-time<br>Paths of of the scrum inous case uh<br>environment and with that and a sporty<br>emphasis we move on<br>to um the second to three<br>chapters this is a truncated is<br>football and this is a this is this is<br>far from a projected piece this is<br>actually quite<br>impressionistic um it's actually my<br>straa paes um over over about five years<br>uh running and walking uh across the nen<br>um and it's it's much distorted so I'll<br>I'll kind of pick out some uh Landmark<br>this is a Tara Harbor here uh Andy Bay<br>Inlet is here this is<br>wavely uh this oil Mir image is toe<br>accident I don't know I I don't know<br>where my D is trying to tell me<br>something um and so homes around here<br>you can see the uh the density this<br>works on the same Principle as that flow<br>map of the uh the Adolescent uh High<br>School uh students um and over here<br>you'll see a strange shape in uh Botanic<br>Gardens here this is this is where I<br>spend my uh Saturday morning so shout<br>out to the park run which got me into<br>Eagle eyed people will notice the Octan<br>and mor<br>place anyway it's all on<br>here and uh it's meant to signify a step<br>away from the outer world into the inner<br>World um we've already seen it with the<br>dolphin data you know we've really kind<br>of personalized that dolphin data we've<br>seen it with the paths of high school<br>students as well this is very personal<br>data that uh the kind of data that we<br>didn't collect you know 100 years ago or<br>more but as now with the devices we have<br>regularly<br>so we're kind of going into the more<br>human world and here um we are still<br>with the map<br>just<br>and this is work uh done with Christina<br>and and marish and and<br>Christopher um on a what if um based on<br>that 3D space which has space and time<br>what if a Lifeline like this the path of<br>a person through time space was replaced<br>with a comic strip okay a comic<br>strip um it makes sense in a<br>way cuz uh that's SpaceTime path does<br>hold a story that story could be told in<br>graphical form here's a simple one a<br>commuting to work a guy out of his house<br>commutes to work in a traffic jam goes<br>to work and<br>works um and so we've transplanted that<br>onto a space timeline this is a vertical<br>one the the person uh at their house uh<br>commuting work lunch<br>work again in the afternoon communing<br>home um this is a a photo strip beloved<br>of a8s comics that I grew up with uh so<br>while I was making Maps I was also<br>reading<br>comics and uh Dom McKinnon uh who who<br>used to be in the school surveying he<br>had a an odyssey Across America with few<br>of his mates on motorbikes and took lots<br>of photos and finally uh kind of lent<br>them to me and and gave me the story<br>behind them I put them into a photo<br>strip like this the story of Don's<br>Odyssey Across America he also gave me a<br>load of GPS data too which I which I<br>turned into this this is that<br>SpaceTime um uh 3D space um and to make<br>sense of this this is the Canadian<br>border so we're looking kind of broadly<br>Southwest here uh this is the Pacific<br>coast and Don St ing here uh on the east<br>side of the Rockies basically making his<br>way with his mates to the West Coast of<br>of the<br>states climbing<br>through<br>time and why not let's put it into a<br>virtual environment too so you can<br>experience it um I won't mention virtual<br>environments that much even though I've<br>dabbled in it quite a bit but um you can<br>see kind of uh that comic strip uh along<br>the top of this a kind of curtain in<br>space time so this a kind of hybrid<br>inner outer World Don's inner experience<br>of his trip represented in a tenuous not<br>tenuous but um a tensive map or a yeah<br>adjust<br>map okay um still in this area of inner<br>outer um again again with Kirk and and<br>and Greg um I've been examining the<br>mapping of the body um so take the<br>principles of Google<br>Maps and people have tried to map the<br>body before using cardiographic<br>techniques like this one<br>here um what what me Greg and Kirk were<br>interested in though were was um in<br>particular uh the function of Google<br>Maps that allows you to say Okay I want<br>to get somewhere H what's the shortest<br>route so this is how I got here<br>I I put in I put in the uh route from<br>the school surveying and I I drove and<br>I'm now parked just outside obviously um<br>alternatively I could have<br>walked I might have walked<br>actually we want to take the same<br>principle um so that calculation is<br>dependent on the network of roads and<br>and<br>paths uh connected together<br>topologically uh the the human network<br>uh well the human has networks too it<br>has um B basic cardiovascular networks<br>it's got nervous<br>networks uh endocrine um hormone based<br>networks um Digestive and so on and so<br>what we're doing is investigating the<br>flow of materials uh through the body<br>blood um things like salt um how they<br>dealt with in the body using the G's<br>kind of network analysis much the same<br>way that Google Maps uses network<br>analysis to plot the shs throughoute<br>B and the uh the last thing in this<br>section uh very very human is uh stuff<br>I've been doing with uh Peter and and<br>and Brent quite a while ago um you might<br>have mentioned might have heard um work<br>with Bluff oyster Fishers uh this is one<br>of the products of that um very much an<br>inner uh data source which is basically<br>uh the the innate knowledge of these<br>oyster fishes and their their knowledge<br>of grounds and this is the sum map of um<br>basically them drawing on a large azero<br>plan of phobo Strait where they used to<br>fish and they name these<br>grounds um one oyst Fisher saying they<br>fish somewhere like raki over here uh<br>might not be a a kind of solid basis for<br>mapping but if you got about 17 saying<br>yeah the West bed's about here then then<br>we got mapping by<br>consensus again very much uh it's a<br>conventional map but it's very much got<br>very personal<br>data in a<br>alter and so we move into our last World<br>move into the<br>brain uh we leave geography and space<br>well not space just geography behind and<br>this one here is signifying the inner<br>World um so this is an is<br>soedin uh and it depicts uh a graph<br>network of musicians uh of the the sound<br>and the bands they were linked<br>to um so this is based on a um a a<br>graphic I developed for an exhibition at<br>the hawen library um about a couple of<br>years<br>ago the data I got for this um was from<br>this uh chart kind of Gant chart of of<br>the scene starting in 1977 over here<br>going through to 1993 pretty much and<br>the longevity or not of the bands in the<br>scene um you can't see them so well here<br>but with each band there's a list of<br>musicians<br>and Bob Scott uh the basist with the<br>clean and guitarist with the bats he he<br>he made this chart and and as challenge<br>around here saying if someone can link<br>these musicians together uh you're<br>welcome so so I did it for this<br>exhibition and this is what we got a uh<br>a<br>graph of all<br>those 250 odd<br>musicians with the1 bands they were part<br>of so we got the uh the chills over<br>here uh the clean is somewhere up here<br>there is and so on the lanes are over<br>here somewhere there they are yeah so<br>you can pour over this and uh kind of uh<br>you probably start with Peter gutridge<br>bands and some of the work I've been<br>doing with eagle<br>um and and I'm I'm finishing off is<br>applying the same kind of graph<br>technique to um the national uh map<br>collection at the Alexander Turnal<br>Library where Eagle was map<br>curator um so so basic is a radial graph<br>uh capturing the unpublished collection<br>that Alexander teral has um and this is<br>Scale based in the middle here we've got<br>basically a a circle proportional to the<br>number of maps in New Zealand<br>uh covering the entire country and then<br>we go out into the North Island uh down<br>here into the South Island not so many<br>South Island maps you see lots of North<br>Island maps uh so Island scale then we<br>go into uh basically Regional and and<br>Broad um city province scale then we go<br>to the cities and towns themselves and<br>then particularly in Wellington we move<br>to basically every single Wellington<br>suburb over here<br>so you might argue that these are really<br>diagrams and not maps per se I I'd beg<br>it different they're a map of a kind but<br>uh uh a more robust answer to that is um<br>there is uh a mapping technique a true<br>mapping technique where you can take<br>non-spatial or non-geographic data and<br>convert it into something a 2d map um it<br>goes through a process called<br>specialization where you can start off<br>with a very kind of simple<br>data um this is basically uh six<br>projects could be word<br>projects and they have a kind of<br>attribute like duration or difficulty<br>and these are um attributes that can be<br>kind of put into<br>geometric uh uh variables like height<br>and area to create a space now that's<br>exactly what's going on here six<br>projects create six<br>spaces uh time for the Project's area<br>difficulty is height and roughness is is<br>basically the amount of certainty uh<br>associated with the<br>project um having divided our space into<br>six we can then create very simple Hills<br>inverted commas and then add the kind of<br>roughness and so this technique has been<br>applied<br>to uh the surveying<br>curriculum so um basically you go on the<br>website and uh see what we do in the<br>school surveying in second year um or<br>you can uh see the<br>map uh it's a kind of nice Gentle Way<br>in uh basically the peaks in the map are<br>the the kind of areas where there is<br>kind of more difficulty more uncertainty<br>words<br>um there we go so it's an inner<br>world it's it's basically doesn't exist<br>anywhere uh in the Geographic world but<br>uh we've kind of rendered it as a<br>map returning to this this is something<br>I want to do with with with our graph of<br>musicians and bands perhaps taking um a<br>map of the time one of my fa favor Maps<br>National map Series this<br>one and kind of<br>superimposing that graph um on that so<br>this is a kind of conceptual model and<br>just where where I want to go with<br>this so we return now to our last topic<br>the PA of maps we've seen the M<br>projection used for<br>navigation um but also source of a lot<br>of misunderstanding as well um so<br>basically the M forms a a huge part of<br>our mental model of how we perceive the<br>world it is pretty much ubiquitous uh<br>but certainly my childhood and you can<br>see the kind of size of Equatorial count<br>countries like Africa and South America<br>and returning to that kind of size is<br>everything uh principal uh the bigger<br>you are the more notice you you Garner<br>um um basically this this kind of<br>cargraphic lie um is is perhaps<br>something that should be rectified and<br>people are doing this this is one of the<br>latest projections to come out the equal<br>Earth<br>projection um this is this is where you<br>see Africa South America the Amazon<br>rainforest in their true size uh<br>relative to the rest of the world you<br>see it's huge it's kind of even rivaling<br>Asia a bit it's it's in it's in the same<br>kind of um ballpark now whereas here<br>Asia is is basically Far and Away the<br>biggest so um it kind of underlines the<br>the message that uh maps have power<br>okay um and kind of power so that if the<br>map's not telling you uh what you want<br>it to<br>tell you feel compel to do stupid<br>things um so yeah so we got the uh this<br>the Sharpie Gates uh<br>uh and this this hurricane affecting<br>different and so basically the par of<br>map lies within so it's in this kind of<br>inner<br>category and I want to kind of uh just<br>highlight one last thing um uh one last<br>project and we kind of return uh to<br>conventional maps and something I've<br>learned from my time in information<br>science is is basically how do you<br>get um data from us humans about how<br>well a map works or how well an<br>interface<br>works and I got introduced to something<br>called yeah usability<br>testing and I kind of show us in<br>relation to to this sand table which was<br>developed uh collaboration between<br>information science computer science or<br>School Computing as it is now in<br>hddc the uh first a bit about the the<br>sandbox or sand table it's a tangible<br>argumented reality technology okay it's<br>a it's a basically a 3D mapping<br>technology with a physical map<br>and it originated out of MIT and this is<br>this is basically one of the prototypes<br>and this is pretty much where you take a<br>medium this in this case it's Clay not<br>sand the surface is picked up by a 3D<br>camera and is basically processed so<br>that it creates a map a contour map<br>which then projected back onto the clay<br>same principle for sand okay this<br>happens very quickly 3D camera this is a<br>Microsoft Connect that you'll find with<br>an Xbox picking up a point cloud of the<br>surface gets processed console maps<br>created color console map and that's<br>projected right on the sand and it<br>happens really quickly so as you move<br>the sand the contour map gets updated we<br>wanted to assess how well this is<br>working in teaching uh terrain<br>principles and hydro hydro um<br>hydrological modeling so basically um<br>Concepts like slope and aspect um which<br>way water flows on surfaces we teach us<br>using<br>GIS um that that software package um but<br>how well does a Sandbox do uh to answer<br>that question<br>we have to kind of go<br>inner and so we pitted the sand table<br>versus the<br>gis so we got a sand table surface here<br>we did some tests like um got got some<br>participants in they did tests they said<br>you know where's the highest point on<br>this surface where's the lowest point<br>steepest slope um point to a place on<br>the surface which way would water flow<br>if if uh if it was let loose on that<br>surface and so on and they gave their<br>answers in both<br>environments they were also asked about<br>their um kind of satisfaction with both<br>environments and they also timed in<br>their tasks<br>too and so for for usability um our<br>inner world or the inner world of<br>participants told us that um s table was<br>by far<br>uh the most popular<br>technology um it was the quickest<br>technology but gave gave us the uh more<br>wrong<br>answers um it doesn't mean that you<br>reject the sand table all together it it<br>really it it kind of leads a conclusion<br>that um you'd use a sand table perhaps<br>as a as a kind of an entry Gateway uh<br>technology to introduce the concept<br>before following up with GIS<br>GS really didn't stand a chance because<br>I've shown you Google Maps and Google<br>Earth which uh all the data is there for<br>you but this is a proper GIS so to speak<br>this is arcgis the the market leader<br>that we use in our teaching and<br>research and um this is basically what<br>what you you see when you open it it's<br>um it's basically not that user friendly<br>you where do you go you got thousands of<br>analysis and mapping techniques down<br>here to choose from um um you got no<br>data to kind of entice you in um<br>basically uh it's a blank<br>canvas not kind of amable to our inner<br>world not like sand table<br>this anyway that's a a bit of an Insight<br>uh delving into the inner world to get<br>insights about our maps and<br>Technologies<br>so in summary it's is a it's a bit of a<br>specific Journey um through through my<br>experience so far um of this life of<br>this working life um and my love of maps<br>is our<br>outer our hybrid and our inner<br>worlds we've seen maps that cover<br>Beyond we've seen through the various<br>examples the Arts science and technology<br>and mapping which is exactly the<br>cartography and we've seen how Maps can<br>be many<br>things and so this is really what I've<br>learned some things uh occur to me later<br>on and other things are knew from the<br>start this is something that occurs to<br>me after 20 years or 30 years mapping<br>you can map<br>anything okay so um hopefully I've<br>examples um another thing that I've kind<br>of grown uh to realize and and I I think<br>it it's it's part of our Consciousness<br>is that Maps increasingly are covering<br>uh human existence um basically all all<br>of our<br>activities uh as well as the traditional<br>physical maps<br>uh not so apparent like 30 years ago but<br>collected I want to stress and this is<br>important hopefully you'll get a sense<br>of why I find maps fun hopefully you'll<br>find them fun too and you already<br>important so through the<br>Journey um um kind of yeah many many<br>many people to to thank um you uh we're<br>talking about you know um supervisors<br>teachers students of course<br>collaborators friends colleagues um uh a<br>lot of you are here I'm really touched<br>and um thank thank you all I couldn't<br>have done this without all of<br>to<br>I my to<br>D<br>kiaro good evening everybody my name is<br>Christina hula I'm a colleague of Tony's<br>in the school of surveying and my job<br>here is to wrap this<br>up he<br>the white Heron flies<br>once now when you walked into this room<br>this evening you knew what to expect the<br>IPL is a genre talk right we know that<br>we're going to hear about how hard it is<br>the challenge in becoming a professor at<br>otako faka ihu Waka we know we're going<br>to hear a readout of some key facts and<br>figures from the portfolio that made the<br>case for the promotion and we're going<br>to gain some insight into the new<br>professor what motivates them to get up<br>and do it again every day their pathway<br>the people and places that mattered<br>along that<br>Journey he aaoa<br>heah nevertheless every IPL is as unique<br>as the person who gives it and when you<br>leave this room this night tonight<br>you'll take something new with you some<br>new facts that you'll share with<br>somebody tomorrow next week maybe years<br>from now a story to tell to somebody who<br>wasn't fortunate enough to be here with<br>us<br>once so what is it that you are going to<br>take away from this talk tonight there's<br>a challenge here right there I think<br>actually three<br>challenges uh Teo toah the first<br>challenge that was to Dr antthony Moore<br>here's your PhD what are you going to go<br>and do with it the second challenge<br>that was to Professor Tony<br>Moore now please condense that down to<br>about 45<br>minutes the third challenge that's to<br>all of us what are we going to pick up<br>what are we going to take out into the<br>world from the speech that we've heard<br>tonight now I've been a lecturer for a<br>long time I know that that challenge has<br>been received as a purely rhetorical one<br>not expecting you to respond I will<br>expect that later so prepare yourselves<br>what have I Tak away what am I going to<br>carry out of this room the power of the<br>pencil right the importance of childhood<br>interests and supporting those and<br>carrying those forward at every age<br>we've learned that maps are a lot more<br>than mathematical transforms from the 3D<br>World onto the 2D<br>plane now those Maps were helpful in<br>some cases we certainly heard<br>that but we're sort of drowning in those<br>Maps right right they were on the phone<br>even if you turn off location services<br>the map follows you wherever you go you<br>cannot Escape it and I think there's a<br>conversation happening in cartography<br>these days about that situation about<br>the fact that anybody can turn on the<br>computer start up some software push a<br>button and make a map where does that<br>leave the<br>Cartographer where's the theory where is<br>the grounding well I'll tell you where<br>it is it's right here in the<br>University right we defend the theory we<br>challenge the theory we transform the<br>theory that's what we do that's what<br>Professor Tony Moore does every day he<br>does that as a teacher at both the most<br>entry level of all and at that<br>postgraduate level that's what he does<br>as a<br>researcher<br>heah there is nobody else who can do the<br>work that he does the way he does to<br>carry<br>craphy forward to carry the discipline<br>forward so if we think about Tony's work<br>what have we<br>seen we've got these shapes right we had<br>a little tour through two of the<br>platonic solids um we've got the<br>octahedron the isos hedrin what do those<br>two shapes have in<br>common okay this isn't one of the<br>rhetorical<br>questions I'm trying to help you I've<br>only got one hand free triangles what<br>kind of<br>triangles equilateral triangles now I'm<br>a little disappointed that the<br>tetrahedron didn't get a look in<br>although if you ask Tony he'll explain<br>why these shapes well the octahedron<br>especially has symmetry about its<br>equatorial plane it's an important shape<br>and it helps for making these maps of<br>the<br>world something we saw about Tony's work<br>why do we need these shapes that 2D<br>plane cannot contain the question that<br>he wants to ask and answer these<br>questions that are about the human<br>condition we saw as well that the<br>regular shape of the platonic solid all<br>those facets are exactly the same that<br>couldn't contain it either that's not<br>the way the world is so what did he do<br>he truncated the vertices of that ideal<br>shape and got two other kinds of facets<br>out of it and a whole new way to look at<br>the world that's what we do in the<br>University that's what Professor Moore<br>does he bothers the theory he defends it<br>he challenges it and he transforms it<br>into something new and the questions<br>that he's asking and trying to answer<br>those are about The Human Condition<br>right there was a word he used this is<br>our second test question for the evening<br>there was a word he used to describe<br>what he was doing anybody<br>remember oh no we've got a front row of<br>luminaries here one of them knows it for<br>sure inner world oh it was the inner<br>world but there was another I don't know<br>how to how to demonstrate this I can't<br>form myself into<br>a what did he call<br>it Professor Moore what did you call<br>it<br>Spa all right spatialization folks<br>spatialization right asking and<br>answering questions about the Human<br>Condition about what it means to live on<br>this Earth in these times using the<br>cartographer's tools and applying them<br>to things that we don't think of as<br>being inherently spatial but this is<br>right this is a unique this is a<br>different a completely original way of<br>looking at the tools in the<br>cartographer's toolkit and saying I can<br>help all of us understand this world<br>better that's what each and every one of<br>you you lecturers<br>you researchers you students here<br>tonight that's what we all do in the<br>university and it matters a lot and you<br>can't be replaced by the software that<br>you turn on you can't be replaced by the<br>button that's going to be pushed it<br>matters that it's you and it matters<br>that it's<br>Tony now to wrap up I want to talk a<br>little bit about Professor Tony Moore as<br>a colleague um Tony is one of the most<br>intuitively inclusive people that I know<br>he's an excellent listener at least he<br>listens to me a lot I think he listens<br>to other people as well he's an<br>excellent listener he believes that<br>there's a right starting place and a<br>right degree pathway for almost every<br>student who arrives and who is willing<br>to put in the work and when those<br>students do arrive in our F Tony is<br>highly regarded by his<br>students and as a teacher and as a<br>mentor for the way he gets alongside<br>for the way he helped students develop<br>them we just did a not great job of<br>singing our waata but we got through it<br>we we um the school waata that we sang a<br>few minutes ago was written by marianao<br>we mix it up a little bit from time to<br>time I think that showed that's all<br>right we sing it<br>together we've been singing this song at<br>our important events for about a decade<br>now and we practice it along with other<br>waata together in<br>between for most of that time we've been<br>called to sing by the voice and the<br>guitar of our colleague Dr David<br>Goodwin when David died without skipping<br>a beat Tony opened up the case picked up<br>his guitar and kept us singing<br>together<br>nor<br>um M HOA I'm so proud of you and this is<br>such an excellent opportunity I now have<br>two other things to do I've got some<br>stuff to hand over and then I have to<br>remember to invite you all to the staff<br>club uh to inspect the shapes I didn't<br>these are all this one is uh an<br>archimedian<br>solid not quite as classic as the other</p></main><footer style="margin-top: 2rem; background: #0001; padding: 2rem; text-align: center;"><p>We Are The University</p><ul style="list-style-type: none; padding: 0; margin: 0;"><li><a
