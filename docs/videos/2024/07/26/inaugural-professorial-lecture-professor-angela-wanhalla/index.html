taroto Teno Oto<br>Oto Cur it's my special privilege this<br>evening to introduce Professor Angela<br>wanhalla a distinguished scholar of<br>gender colonialism and interracial<br>intimacies across these islands and The<br>Wider<br>Pacific Angela's work ranges from the<br>context of Shaw whaling in early 19th<br>century southern New Zealand to global<br>conflict in the mid 20th century in the<br>Pacific Theater of World War<br>II Angela's academic career commenced at<br>the University of Canterbury where she<br>completed a ba honors a master's and PhD<br>in<br>history and where she found or indeed<br>made a home at the productive<br>intersection of Marty history and<br>feminist<br>history her PhD explored the history of<br>interracial marriage from the 1830s in a<br>community near denan at The Tyree Native<br>Reserve this was published as her first<br>book invisible site the mixed descent<br>families of southern New<br>Zealand in September 2005 Angela joined<br>atago's history program after a<br>year-long post-doctoral stint in<br>Canada her time at atigo has been<br>distinguished by a series of significant<br>Awards<br>including the RO Heath trust award and<br>Carl Smith medal and the University of<br>atago early career award for distinction<br>and<br>research a particular career highlight<br>was the award in 2013 of a Rutherford<br>Discovery Fellowship from the Royal<br>Society of New<br>Zealand these 5-year fellowships were<br>awarded annually to 10 future research<br>leaders across New<br>Zealand in 2021 Angela was elected<br>fellow of the Royal Society and she was<br>promoted to Professor in<br>2022 the importance of Angela's research<br>is reflected in a series of external<br>grants beginning with a fast start<br>Marsden Grant from the Royal Society in<br>2007 which supported her work on the<br>history of interracial marriage in New<br>Zealand this was followed by the award<br>of a mden standard Grant in 2009 with<br>Professor Judy Bennett for their project<br>concerned with the fate of children born<br>of American servicemen and Indigenous<br>women in the South Pacific command<br>during World War<br>II and more recently in 2018 Angela<br>together with Professor Loy Patterson uh<br>they were awarded a mar and standard<br>grant for too ker their project on the<br>histories and Legacies of the Marty home<br>Angela has a truly formidable record of<br>scholarship it includes five books<br>several edited Collections and numerous<br>chapters Journal articles and<br>reviews her work represents people's<br>lives in a way that few historians are<br>able to<br>do coming from a place of deep personal<br>meaning it readily resonates with the<br>lives of other new zealanders and I'm<br>sure we will here more about that this<br>evening I just want to dwell on two<br>pieces of her<br>work her second book matters of the<br>heart a history of interracial marriage<br>in New Zealand published by ockland<br>University press was awarded the 2014<br>Ernest Scott prize for the book judged<br>to be the most distinguished<br>contribution to the history of Australia<br>or New Zealand or to the history of<br>colonization Angela was only the second<br>resident to have been awarded this prize<br>since its Inception in<br>1943 the book was widely reviewed as<br>groundbreaking and as an accessible<br>pioneering study and for One reviewer it<br>was especially notable that several of<br>their own relatives had picked up the<br>copy of the book to see whether their<br>family histories were<br>included attesting to the resonance and<br>reach of Angela's<br>scholarship her most recent book Book of<br>Love and War was published last year by<br>the University of Nebraska press and<br>concerns the many hundreds of New<br>Zealand and Pacific War Brides who<br>married American servicemen during World<br>War II stories that illuminate the<br>impact of global war on local women<br>their families and Pacific<br>societies another notable feature of<br>Angela's work that I just want to<br>highlight is its collaborative quality<br>and this again I think will be an<br>emphasis of her lecture this<br>evening as one of her co-authors<br>reflected to me she found writing<br>together with her a formative experience<br>in her academic Career One shaped by<br>intellectual friendship and<br>encouragement<br>zakaki Mor toata my congratulations to<br>Angela and All That Remains for me is to<br>invite you to the podium to deliver your<br>IPL entitled Foo fena and history<br>that<br>TOA Oto Oto<br>Tina so um I have to admit uh that I've<br>been doing my best to delay having to do<br>this thing really hard I been really<br>hard to do that uh and I'm glad I did<br>because I now get to deliver my<br>presentation under um the banner ofo<br>faku Waka um but also Under The Manor of<br>the inaugural uh DVC Marty so I think<br>that's a wonderful position to be in um<br>and giving my IPL um so thank you just<br>for hosting tonight's event uh and for<br>all the work uh that you do and have<br>done uh to advocate for Marty staff<br>teaching uh and research here at atago<br>and I count myself very lucky uh to be<br>able to collaborate with you on research<br>and writing projects and I look forward<br>to many more I hope um I'd also uh like<br>to just Begin by acknowledging a few<br>other people before I launch into uh<br>tonight's uh presentation I'd like to<br>acknowledge my past and present<br>postgraduate students some of whom I<br>know are online and just say that I'm<br>proud of you uh and all of your<br>achievements to date um I look forward<br>to seeing all the many books that you<br>produce uh in the future uh and I want<br>to particularly acknowledge um Dr Katie<br>Cooper whose first book will be<br>published she was a graduate of ours um<br>on the 7th of August um in unity books<br>so go along and if you're in

Katie I know she's online<br>and she'll be annoyed that i' sit<br>that uh thank you to the history program<br>um I've benefited from being in a<br>program with a really strong research<br>culture uh that supports uh research<br>Grant applications you've heard about<br>some of them uh they've been introduced<br>uh tonight I'm going be talking a bit<br>more about them and taking risks in<br>research and having ambition so I think<br>it's really wonderful to be in a program<br>where that is uh supported and I want to<br>uh particularly thank um Barbara Brooks<br>former colleague now Meritus Professor<br>uh and Judy Bennett uh for their uh<br>mentorship two people I've kind of<br>collaborated with uh throughout my<br>career and finally<br>Loy thank you for being my greatest<br>supporter and Advocate um I'm a bit<br>biased but I do consider Loy one of our<br>best historians of Maru print culture in<br>this country and I'm really pleased that<br>the university recognized this and<br>making him an ameritus Professor last<br>year um I think the university is pretty<br>lucky to have him um as am I so um thank<br>you very much Loy you'll be hearing more<br>about Loy<br>later um so tonight's talk uh is in two<br>parts uh the first part just briefly<br>touches on myo uh man need to give you a<br>bit of a sense of the people and the<br>places uh that have shaped me and<br>informed my research trajectory uh as<br>has been indicated a lot of my work is<br>very personal and it also reaches people<br>personally as well which I<br>recognize in the second part I'll<br>highlight uh some projects I've really<br>enjoyed being a part of uh and that has<br>a lot to do with the people I've worked<br>with so this is really uh an opportunity<br>to acknowledge those people and thank<br>them uh for including me in their<br>projects which have really enriched my<br>career uh and particularly my<br>intellectual life uh so thank you very<br>much to everyone I won't get to mention<br>everyone tonight there's been lots of<br>collaborations in my career um but I'm<br>just going to highlight a few uh that<br>have been a lot of fun for me so much of<br>my research is centered on crosscultural<br>histories and families in 19th and 20th<br>century New Zealand and my interest in<br>those areas have been shaped by a person<br>uh and a place the person being my dad<br>Stan um and this place<br>tomu um this is an image of the hon Wy<br>Church uh located not far from alai it's<br>a very wind swept spot uh as you can see<br>but that's quite a nice day it's not<br>always like that um and it's located<br>recently close to the ocean you can<br>probably see a few of the the sandbanks<br>the Junes uh in the background I love<br>going visiting uh here my dad's buried<br>here he died in 2005 uh just a few<br>months after I graduated with my PhD and<br>before I started a job here in September<br>uh that year um so I'm kind of standing<br>near him taking a picture um on that day<br>um and it's really lovely it's lovely<br>and quiet and that you can hear the<br>birds and you can hear the ocean it's<br>just beautiful so if you get a chance to<br>visit go and have a look and say hello<br>to my uh dad now to is historically<br>important for many reasons uh but I'll<br>highlight just a few uh first it's<br>strongly connected to Oto through the<br>tyo Allison Faro uh and through the ru<br>hickey hickey Hau and the fact that HK<br>tidor uh the representative of the<br>Southern Mar electric settled there in<br>the late 1870s we operated a farm and<br>built a house after two his wife teny<br>and some of their sons are buried uh at<br>this udupa now the Tyro and Allison Faro<br>have held significant leadership<br>position at at tomu uh for for many many<br>years of particular importance to our<br>family there a man called Ricky Allison<br>you can see his grave here in the<br>picture uh he helped my parents get<br>access to support from Mar fears to get<br>a mortgage in the days when you can get<br>that kind of support um and they would<br>never have gotten to their own home uh<br>otherwise uh without him and he was he<br>always thought that Ricky Allison was<br>the man God king of it all um and he<br>always reminded us just how important he<br>was and how much we owed to Herman to<br>and to always go back uh there and the<br>reason why he wants he wanted to be<br>buried there as well uh the other reason<br>tomu is important is that not far from<br>this church is a small cluster of little<br>buildings uh on a piece of land known as<br>Fisherman's Point um and as a kid I was<br>always quite fascinated by this<br>community I think it began to be settled<br>in the late 19th or early 20th century<br>uh mainly by men who worked in the<br>fishing industry they were from Italy<br>Russia Greece Denmark uh and SW Sweden<br>and many other exotic places and I was<br>very intrigued and interested in why<br>they were there in this place if you<br>don't know where Tomo is on the southern<br>Point really of uh t water lake elmir<br>far far away from the rest of the world<br>are fairly isolated as well um and why<br>they stayed as well and that's partly to<br>do with the families that they married<br>into which were both the farming<br>families in this region but also many<br>people from who affiliate to natim Moki<br>marai too and those descendants of those<br>families are people my dad grew up with<br>and who he talked about quite a lot um<br>so I lived with these people throughout<br>my life um and had to follow him around<br>all the time going visiting people and<br>listening to kind of old people talking<br>constantly and I just was bored out of<br>my mind but he sucked me into history by<br>doing that uh combined with this the<br>fact my own family comes from quite a<br>diverse cultural background also shaped<br>my interest in crosscultural couples and<br>families so my work as has been<br>mentioned uh I explore the economic<br>social and cultural con consquences of<br>colonialism for indigenous women their<br>families and communities and I've done<br>this by examining the history of<br>interracial marriage and I've done that<br>for personal reasons uh my mom is Pia uh<br>of Irish and Ms Heritage and my dad is<br>Marty and carries a really weird surname<br>one Hara which is from<br>Finland um so here are my parents um on<br>their wedding day on the 1st of May uh<br>1970 standing outside the Christ Church<br>registry<br>office uh my mom um is 17<br>here um and looks amazing she knew she<br>looked amazing yeah check out my dad's<br>cool it disappeared in later life I<br>don't know what<br>happened so my mom her name is Cory um<br>is from an Irish Catholic background in<br>Christ Church um her father uh Mike<br>Nunan is the man there with his shirt<br>Way open for some reason um um uh grew<br>up in a kind of Irish Catholic Family<br>one of 13 uh kids um they grew up around<br>Richmond area in Christ um he was a<br>really big league player loved uh rugby<br>league really into it really kind of<br>wasn't interested in Catholicism and<br>gave it up as soon as he possibly could<br>um his interests were mainly communism<br>uh workingclass politics and reading<br>people's voice was the key thing um in<br>working-class politics in particular was<br>big for him I never met his wife uh my<br>grandmother Nar who's the woman uh on<br>the right um as she died in February<br>1968 Oakland Hospital aged just 48 uh<br>she' had a kidney transplant uh 3 months<br>earlier and her body rejected it uh at<br>that point to have had that operation<br>you had to go to ockland uh so the whole<br>family moved there uh to be with her and<br>nar's death changed the trajectory of my<br>mother's life um she was my mom second<br>oldest of six kids<br>um and when the family returned to<br>Christ Church uh it was expected that<br>she leave school just like her older<br>sister get a job and contribute to the<br>family economy and look after the<br>younger kids and that's exactly uh what<br>she did um but it didn't take long for<br>her to get married at 17 here uh also in<br>the picture there is um my dad's parents<br>uh Bill uh Hamilton Walla um who is a<br>fisherman um and farm labor and his wife<br>white ey Brown who I'm going to talk<br>about very very soon<br>so um my mom uh like my father left<br>school uh without any qualifications uh<br>dad grew up in the peton and broadfields<br>area so if you know chist me around uh<br>kind of out on the outskirts of horby um<br>and the family worked on local farms and<br>moved from Farm to farm for employment<br>um and they also engaged in fishing at T<br>ha uh lake elmir so my dad and I have to<br>say honor my grandmother here uh is the<br>fifth child of 15 um so a massive family<br>uh and came from quite a bit of kind of<br>a poor background a recently poor<br>background uh he ended up working at<br>eslington freezing Works uh on the Chain<br>uh eventually getting a a permanent<br>position there highly prized permanent<br>possession uh but during the off season<br>he worked as a truck driver sheet metal<br>worker and a range of kind of other jobs<br>until he got um a permanent job here are<br>some more family photos for<br>you uh my dad and my mom at their flat<br>in 197 three my dad's put on some weight<br>there he was truck driving that year um<br>I don't know why they're hanging out in<br>front of the laundry<br>line at all you can see their laundry um<br>so my brother uh was on gravel um uh<br>Mark is his name uh and me and my sister<br>Crystal um you can tell it's the 1980s<br>because Brown was the<br>color of the<br>decade um and also I don't know how we<br>lived in that house with so many<br>different<br>patterns um yeah so we we come from a<br>fairly workingclass family uh but in<br>1988 everything changed uh in July that<br>year um the freezing works at elington<br>were closed uh dad lost his job and he<br>never worked again he was 45 years<br>old um he eventually um got rheumatoid<br>arthritis and was on sickness benefit<br>one good thing to come out of the<br>redundancy was that my parents used it<br>to pay off the mortgage very sensible to<br>do but generally uh the 1990s were a<br>pretty tough decade for them uh<br>involving a lot of financial stress uh<br>because we relied on the beneficiary<br>system uh to survive and at a time uh if<br>people can remember back to the 1990s<br>some of you might be too young for this<br>uh when the national government targeted<br>beneficiaries and really stigmatized uh<br>the being on a benefit if you were a<br>family on a benefit as well and we<br>deeply targeted and kind of cut away in<br>our welfare system um so this is the<br>context in which I kind of started<br>University uh in the mid 1990s from a<br>kind of background of kind of deep um<br>concern I guess about our political<br>situation but also of poverty as well<br>was a really tough time for my family um<br>so these are uh come from papers past<br>Christ priests is available to 1989 you<br>can find out all about my family if you<br>go online it's a lot of interesting<br>things to find out um part of the reason<br>I'm showing is because uh the image on<br>that was on the front page is actually<br>thank God they don't do images very well<br>in papers past and they're really grainy<br>but that front page has got me and my<br>brother my sister and my dad uh in the<br>picture um this was at a uh big meeting<br>uh with the Union um about redundancy<br>packages trying to get a a bit a deal<br>and all the families came as on a<br>Saturday um and you see kind of see my<br>dad's nose at the edge and my brother's<br>sitting right at the front in the middle<br>and it's Kenbury Bulldogs jumper cuz we<br>were really big fans of the KY Bulldogs<br>rby league team League was everything um<br>and softball as well were kind of two<br>big games uh for our<br>family so I started University in the<br>mid 90s and so for my family from this<br>context education was about getting out<br>of poverty uh and having opportunities<br>for a better life and for opportunities<br>that my parents didn't get uh to have uh<br>my father as I said I think left work at<br>15 and my mother at kind of a similar<br>age left a school at 15 and my mother at<br>a similar age as well so as uh Francis<br>has mentioned I ended up uh carrying on<br>at University exploring postgraduate<br>options I ended up doing my Masters on<br>the Eugenics movement and feminism and<br>into war New Zealand uh then a PhD under<br>the supervision uh of Katie pickles uh<br>and and<br>parsonson I have to thank them both uh<br>for encouraging me into postgraduate<br>research particularly Katie she was the<br>one that really um encouraged me to kind<br>of continue on uh and also for telling<br>me that doing your doctorate on your own<br>family which is what I ended up doing<br>and on fuera was a legitimate research<br>topic uh and methodology so I really owe<br>them uh a great deal um and they really<br>kind of shaped my uh research trajectory<br>so my doctoral research was not on tomu<br>though too much family politics they're<br>not a good idea uh but those families<br>who made their lives on the Tidy Native<br>Reserve which has been mentioned uh<br>located on the Northern Bank of the Tidy<br>River in this uh Province where my<br>family uh has links in the 1830s uh<br>there was a sh whelling station um<br>operating at madata Island uh off the<br>coast of the T mouth and many of those<br>men had Mighty wives and ended up living<br>at the reserve and I was really<br>interested in uh the circumstances upon<br>which these relationships were forged<br>the kinds of households they formed uh<br>and their social emotional and cultural<br>uh Dynamics and I've argued in my work<br>that it's indigenous women uh who are<br>Central to these histories but that<br>their experiences at least until recent<br>decade<br>have often been the kind of Side Story<br>uh to the main plotline of the emergence<br>of new trade and strategic and political<br>uh relationships in the decades before<br>formal<br>colonization but the Welling trade was<br>built upon foundations made possible by<br>Mary woman in the kin so I've sought in<br>my work to Fu man of the woman who was<br>Central uh to founding crosscultural<br>communities and focus in particular on<br>the role of marriage as a common<br>strategy of indigenous diplomacy across<br>uh the southern<br>Pacific and I've tried to counter some<br>of the earlier histography that's<br>focused on trade relations alone uh<br>often without considering the indigenous<br>worlds in which these men entered and<br>operated within uh and the a histography<br>that often overlooked or marginalized<br>gender and the family which have been<br>kind of core themes uh in my research um<br>the image you see here is of me and my<br>dad at PhD graduation and Christ Church<br>when I had dark hair less wrinkles we<br>less uh my you can tell that my dad does<br>not like wearing a tie he's kind of had<br>enough he's kind of got to the end of<br>the day and this is not a can't cope<br>anymore um and the cover of my first<br>book invisible site so uh the people on<br>that cover the little girl is my dad's<br>um uh grandmother who he never met and<br>she's sitting with her grandmother uh<br>who were from the tiny Native<br>Reserve and thank you to Dave Brown for<br>sharing these images uh with me while I<br>was doing my PhD research<br>so what we see in the southern regions<br>is that the nature and the pattern of<br>interracial marriage often echoed forms<br>of gendered authority and Leadership uh<br>and Kito communities and cultures where<br>women of rank exercise power and<br>authority they had the freedom to choose<br>to engage in marriage with Traders and<br>to gain Advantage uh from the economic<br>and social opportunities marriage<br>provided both personally uh and<br>collectively shelling stations operated<br>in a kahoo world and on kahoo terms as<br>simple as that and cross-cultural<br>couples and households operated mainly<br>with indigenous aspirations in mind they<br>absorbed Traders into their genealogies<br>they were kind enough to do that these<br>relationships brought new members into<br>Kaio communities and encumbered these<br>men with responsibilities to their kin<br>which included the sharing of goods uh<br>and wealth and even as colonization um<br>and increased land alienation reshaped<br>the economic and political landscape<br>many families as Kate St and I have kind<br>of explored remained well connected uh<br>with their kahoo relations reflecting um<br>the enduring strength of Kaho culture<br>and life ways in this part of the world<br>didn't disappear and these families give<br>us a really wonderful opportunity to<br>explore that in detail and depth and and<br>intimate<br>ways so my doctorate became my first<br>book invisible site and it's underpinned<br>by a desire to focus on Kido history<br>through the stories of our woman who had<br>been so critical to the fortunes of of<br>our e through the relationships they<br>forged with Steelers and Whalers in the<br>1820s and<br>1830s Kao Foo know these stories and<br>histories um I'm not trying to tell them<br>something they already know uh they are<br>not new to them uh my purpose really is<br>to bring those stories into uh a wider<br>frame uh to a wider audience as well uh<br>to shift some of the historiographical<br>debates um and to raise the status and<br>the historical record um and to give<br>priority to those woman in their stories<br>instead of focusing on the Steelers and<br>Whalers have argued instead that it was<br>these women who gave them those men<br>Manner and<br>standing um now I'm probably most<br>associated with research on race and<br>intimacy and colonialism this kind of<br>work here but for most of my career at<br>ataro at least since<br>2010 I've worked on the second world war<br>which Francis has mentioned thank you<br>for doing so uh addressing its impact on<br>indigenous families and communities uh<br>through a sequence uh of projects<br>starting with Mother's Darlings um which<br>Francis talked about so<br>beautifully now this project totally<br>changed uh the focus of my research and<br>led me into Pacific history an area that<br>I didn't know that well so mother's<br>Darlings was a collaborative project led<br>by our former colleague Judy Bennett um<br>and hi Judy I know she's<br>online um and it drew upon her lifetime<br>of work in Southern Pacific history<br>it addressed the social impacts of<br>American forces uh stationed in the<br>South Pacific command area uh on<br>indigenous communities specifically and<br>looking at particular the children they<br>fathered uh with indigenous women and<br>what happened to these children and<br>their mothers and it was a kind of<br>archival and oral history project uh<br>with descendants of these<br>relationships which raised lots of big<br>ethical issues um I want to thank Judy<br>for in including me uh in the project U<br>my job was to work on the New Zealand<br>side of the story uh this really changed<br>everything for me um this is kind of one<br>of these kind of transformative moments<br>um I want to thank Judy in particular<br>because I leared a lot from her about<br>how to work collaboratively how to do<br>that well learn a lot about research<br>leadership uh and ambition um how to<br>care for a research team and researchers<br>um and also how to manage a research<br>team as well so Judy has been a really<br>kind of Beacon for me in terms of my uh<br>research part of my job in this project<br>uh was to be sent off to do the archival<br>research at College Park in Maryland in<br>the United States um and in doing that<br>research uh revealed just how important<br>uh managing marriage and intimate<br>relationships was uh to military<br>strategy during World War II their<br>archival experience uh of working<br>through Consular records uh from soua uh<br>and New Zealand and of working with<br>American R cross records as well<br>encouraged me to think about a project<br>uh on marriage race and Intimacy in the<br>South Pacific during World War II which<br>is the the book you see on the screen<br>here so that led to a book uh Pacific<br>War Brides uh which was published last<br>year with the University of Nebraska PRI<br>um this book focuses on the<br>1,655 women from New Zealand Tonga Fiji<br>sore and the kiland who married American<br>servicemen uh and the social impact of<br>these men on the communities that hosted<br>them during the war given uh the length<br>of time American forces spent uh on the<br>rear bases in the South Pacific building<br>positive social relationships with local<br>people and officials was critical to the<br>success of the military<br>occupation especially in locations where<br>there was often little else to do but<br>get to know the<br>locals marriage interested uh military<br>command because it impinged on Military<br>efficiency and so they sought to<br>regulate access to it and how they did<br>that is told in of Love and War<br>um the fact that just<br>1,655 American servicemen successfully<br>contracted legal marriage in the South<br>Pacific command shows that marital<br>opportunities were heavily regulated in<br>the region and I emphasize legal<br>marriage because there was plenty of<br>customary relationships that were formed<br>under customary<br>terms one advantage of having that<br>smallish number is that you can actually<br>track a cohort of people um across the<br>available archival records and thanks to<br>digitization we can do something much<br>more in terms of these kind of these<br>following data sets um so that means<br>that the fate of the war marriages<br>themselves can also be assessed which<br>hadn't been done until that point in<br>terms of New Zealand histography so my<br>one of my goals and of Love Of War was<br>to kind of try and track the fate of<br>those relationships what happened to<br>those couples post uh the war being<br>over so what we find is that in terms of<br>marriage not all couples had Equitable<br>access um not that surprising race was a<br>key factor in this military marriage<br>regulations required a commanding<br>officer refer to the state law in the US<br>when it came to marriage of an American<br>serviceman so if American was from<br>Arizona you referred to this the<br>marriage law in Arizona um it didn't<br>matter that wherever the American<br>serviceman was was around the world they<br>embodied their state<br>law and that was a time when 29 States<br>had laws prohibiting interracial<br>marriage in the United States plus a<br>federal immigration policy that denied<br>entry to those who could not meet the<br>race base requirements uh set out under<br>nationality laws you had to be 51% or<br>more white to get in uh to the United<br>States to get across the border um and<br>the con the records that they held for<br>Fiji and elsewhere that I looked at have<br>charts fuckera charts trying to figure<br>out people's blood Quantum and finding<br>out whe there someone 60% white or not<br>um so there the the records were really<br>amazing and shocking at the same<br>time of the 1,655<br>War Brides at least 60 non-european<br>women married American servicemen during<br>the course of the Pacific War four of<br>those Brides were from Tonga uh one was<br>from the K Islands five were from uh<br>Fiji six were samon another was of nuan<br>Heritage and the vast majority were<br>Marty from New Zealand and grooms were<br>from very diverse cultural and ethnic<br>backgrounds uh as well one was uh<br>Filipino American another um an<br>indigenous man uh there were many<br>servicemen who were first generation<br>Americans of German polish finish<br>Norwegian and Russian parentage who came<br>from home so those were the languages<br>that they spoke that was their first<br>language uh as well as Italian uh and<br>Mexican Americans uh as<br>well now African-American servicemen<br>were often denied the necessary<br>permission to marry they were the ones<br>that had the least uh success and in<br>fact only three African-American<br>servicemen Grooms have been identified<br>in the project that I was doing and they<br>all married Marty woman so in the island<br>Pacific no African-American servicemen<br>received permission to marry uh at all<br>and these couples were not able to<br>reunite uh after the war either um and<br>the records I looked at showed the<br>reasons why very sad stories uh<br>too and of those<br>1,655 couples uh from this total cohort<br>73% chose the United States as their<br>home how couples feared uh depended upon<br>a whole range of factors including their<br>new homes the openness of of family in<br>the community uh and their personal<br>attributes such as outlook on life and<br>the ability to build uh new social bonds<br>homesickness and loneliness were part of<br>the war bride experience and no matter<br>what country they originated from but<br>these feelings were exacerbated by the<br>fact that War Brides were a particular<br>kind of Migrant who often left their<br>home countries reluctantly rather than<br>seeking opportunity uh and a new place<br>so they were leaving behind their<br>families and it was a hard thing to do<br>for them and the oral history I did with<br>some of those families and um surviving<br>War Brides really emphasized the kind of<br>emotional wrench that there was to leave<br>families behind at a time when you<br>weren't sure whether or not you were<br>going to be able to come back home to<br>visit at all and when like an<br>international phone call was really<br>unusual and cost a lot of money too so I<br>love these women they are Risk Takers<br>and adventurers I love doing some<br>research on this and I really kind of um<br>find them an amazing group uh of women<br>who took massive risks in their life<br>and on Strangers virt virtual strangers<br>really um so women's experiences<br>arriving at their new homes buried if<br>they ended up in a small town uh like<br>Narita uh they were an exotic and novel<br>presence uh Narita left the familiarity<br>of urban life in Wellington for a rural<br>community and life as sheer croppers on<br>a tobacco farm in Kentucky so radically<br>different kind of<br>experience among people who were<br>strangers and as the only foreign war<br>pride in the community so stuck out like<br>a sort of thumb uh as well um and I got<br>the opportunity to speak with narita's<br>uh children when I visited Kentucky um<br>to um hear about her story<br>RI by contrast enjoyed moving to a much<br>larger City compared to Georgetown<br>Kentucky uh and this was also her<br>transition was helped by uh a very<br>outgoing personality I think you can see<br>this here um uh happily for her she<br>ended up in Los Angeles which is exactly<br>where she wanted to be um she um ended<br>up her and a husband John lived with uh<br>the her mother-in-law for a short period<br>of time uh but they couldn't get along<br>um they didn't like each other very much<br>uh and they ended up deciding on living<br>on a a trailer located across from a<br>beach at Pacific Coast Highway which you<br>see here Andi doing her best to be as<br>glamorous as possible um during the war<br>deui performed at American camps and<br>hospitals at nightclubs notably the<br>Silver Slipper on shortland Street in<br>Oakland um she really enjoyed the war<br>she had a great time um she made the<br>most of new entertainment opportunities<br>established the cat for the Americans um<br>and she was well known and kind of walk<br>in circles as The Yodeling<br>cowgirl so she was quite a<br>yodler um so I met rui uh over 10 years<br>ago I got to stay with her for a few<br>days in her house in oxnar California I<br>had a wonderful time with her I didn't<br>like the fact that she was a Republican<br>voter but I didn't say anything about<br>that did my P to be as polite as<br>possible um and you know but she spent<br>most of her life after the war raising<br>kids but also spending time performing<br>um at ladies luncheons and things like<br>that um coming back and forth between<br>New Zealand she had a Marty father and<br>Marty culture was a particularly<br>important part of her identity and her<br>sense of self uh in Los Angeles as<br>well um but I really enjoyed my time<br>spent with all these wonderful uh<br>families so War Brides were not typical<br>migrants but most in the end found it<br>relatively easy to settle into American<br>Life they sometimes struggled uh to<br>integrate into American households which<br>they found were a bit more lively open<br>and less reserved uh than New Zealand<br>ones but for many uh a sense of<br>familiarity and belonging uh emerged<br>with uh the birth of children having a<br>family but also participation in<br>community activities and especially<br>joining the church um was a key kind of<br>uh uh Touchstone for many of these women<br>uh it kind of opened up the doors to<br>community life uh for them and social<br>connections so uh my involvement uh in<br>mother's Darlings and the Pacific War<br>Brides research then led me to think<br>about um Homefront histories and from<br>this emerged the too K uh project uh<br>which did with Loy and Erica and a whole<br>bunch of other people so these are the<br>covers of the books that will be out in<br>November which you can buy at any good<br>bookstore um Loy who's fabulous we all<br>know that uh did all of the translation<br>work for the Mary language version which<br>is not an exact translation of the<br>English version so note that um<br>completely Loy you're<br>amazing um so uh this project has been<br>like our heart and soul for the last few<br>years we've really enjoyed it uh I think<br>Loy would agree and very sad to not be<br>having our kind of team meetings anymore<br>on Zoom<br>um so World War II is often described by<br>New Zealand historians as a watershed<br>event for Mary because it ashed in a<br>whole series of consequential shifts<br>particularly notable was Mar<br>urbanization that's one that gets talked<br>about quite a lot while the war was a<br>watershed moment a council<br>transformation usually start from 1945<br>and often exclude any detailed<br>examination of the war itself so we've<br>argued in our work that it's uh if we<br>were to truly understand the impact of<br>the war on maryo and communities then we<br>need to connect a accounts of overseas<br>War service<br>with the Marty home front itself<br>reconnecting them is critical if we were<br>to understand the wider impacts of the<br>war on Marty Society more generally in<br>the<br>1940s uh and to more AC it more<br>accurately uh reflects the views of<br>Marty leaders at the time who did not<br>regard overseas service and the home<br>front war effort as separate things but<br>our histography often separates them<br>part of our job is to try and reconnect<br>them uh in this<br>work now there are numerous histories of<br>the second warh home front New Zealand<br>uh and Maria woven into these as part of<br>a story of national Collective Endeavor<br>we were interested in the more<br>distinctive components of the Marty<br>wartime experience at home and one of<br>those important important distinctive<br>components of the home front effort was<br>the establishment of the Mary war effort<br>organization which Claudia Orange has<br>written about quite extensively and this<br>was a government supported but Mar Le<br>Collective of tribal communities and<br>committees that mobilized Mari<br>registration for service in the armed<br>forces and for labor needs in industry<br>and agriculture so it had wide ranging<br>reach uh in Marty life the spirit of<br>autonomy self-determination and Marty<br>leadership in the<br>mweo built upon an already preexisting<br>uh tradition of this reaching back to<br>the 19th century and it infused every<br>element uh of the war effort and this<br>included for instance I'm just going to<br>give you a few examples uh before<br>wrapping up desire for Mighty control<br>over Patriot patriotic monies uh raised<br>by tribal committees so that that money<br>could be could be directed to the<br>support of their men uh or to<br>organizations that they felt would care<br>for them when they returned home so not<br>to the National patriotic Collective<br>organization but for to to be delivered<br>to the men personally or to the Red<br>Cross um so through the work of Tangi<br>who had very strong connections through<br>the Red Cross that was one of the kind<br>of key components of her involvement in<br>the second world war was to support that<br>and Marty raised huge sums and they<br>wanted control over how it was spent not<br>too much to ask uh wartime fundraising<br>was not just about supporting the home<br>front but involved wider agendas<br>relating to tribal Manor the promotion<br>of Pride and culture uh an advancing<br>claims to political autonomy leaders<br>argued that the scale of the fundraising<br>effort and the amount of money raised<br>demonstrated Mary ability to organize at<br>a national level across several fronts<br>and that this ought to be continued<br>after the war<br>another area uh was in agricultural<br>production which is really important uh<br>in terms of the Mary story during World<br>War II urbanization has had a lot of<br>attention in New Zealand history uh but<br>during the<br>1940s most Marty lived<br>rurally studying the home front war<br>effort reasserts the significance of the<br>rural World in Marty history an often<br>forgotten element 75% of Marty were<br>living in rural areas they weren't Urban<br>but we tend to focus a lot on the urban<br>story in our<br>history during the war Marty were a<br>significant agricultural labor force uh<br>but they didn't want to be under the<br>control of local production councils<br>they wanted to operate their own<br>alongside these groups but with the same<br>level uh of autonomy it meant being able<br>to direct your own people potentially<br>retaining them within the region and<br>perally you know preventing urbanization<br>in the future and having your own<br>primary production councils where you<br>controlled how the land was used was<br>also critical to preventing it po<br>entally being taken by the government uh<br>for defense purposes uh which did happen<br>or for public works it also meant<br>growing foods that could be used for the<br>national war effort and put towards<br>Community needs Mar were integral to<br>provision and supply of food sources<br>during the war contributing with their<br>land labor and skills they organized<br>their own production committees to<br>protect their land from alienation and<br>to express uh their political<br>autonomy Marty also wanted control<br>rehabilitation services for returned<br>Marley servicemen as well did not want<br>it to be under the control of the<br>Department of native Affairs later<br>Department of Mary Affairs that's<br>because they were very well aware of the<br>differential treatment their men had<br>received on return uh from the first<br>world war and they sought to prevent the<br>same outcome again tribal committees set<br>up their own rehab sections and used<br>that time to raise money and order to<br>kind of gift that to Men on their return<br>particularly those who came back<br>disabled it's really important that they<br>had access to fun<br>um or the provision of land if they<br>could provide that as<br>well and the spirit of<br>self-determination also spelled into<br>other areas uh such as desire for Mighty<br>autonomy and control uh within the<br>mainstream kind of mission churches and<br>Lo's got a fantastic chapter in the<br>English language book that kind of<br>discusses that kind of Shifting debate<br>about autonomy and self-determination<br>around leadership uh within the churches<br>itself so this whole the war itself was<br>really suffused every element of kind of<br>Marty life um so the war definitely of<br>course impacted marifano uh and<br>communities particularly those who felt<br>the loss of the young men but it also<br>enhanced and strengthened the resolve<br>for self-determination in which<br>Community leaders and Mar politicians<br>sought to progress in multiple ways even<br>if they weren't successful they still<br>sought to move forward with<br>that some communities definitely lost<br>their land through it B taken for<br>defense reasons and others lost their<br>young people who moved to the cities uh<br>for work but the larger Transformations<br>that came from the war were not<br>immediate they took some time to evolve<br>and they were a result of um a kind of<br>pre-existing set of government policies<br>around land that limited the capacity<br>for Rural Marty communities to flourish<br>at a time when the population was<br>growing and was becoming more youthful<br>one of the key demographics of the war<br>um is that about 57% of the Mari<br>population were aged under 21 in 1945 so<br>it's a massively young population<br>this generation who were young during<br>the war they might have been six or<br>seven something like that or like my dad<br>born in 1943 during the war and then<br>grew up in its Shadows those are the<br>ones who felt the full force of the<br>transformation set and trained by the<br>second world war and I think that's that<br>generation who were born or kind of<br>experienced it as very young people who<br>are kind of need to have some kind<br>of thought given to them as a kind of<br>historical<br>cohort and uh and my concluding point is<br>and my final project that I want to<br>mention is tarangi uh led by judu Janet<br>wakaa with me on board as the third<br>whe so this uh project is a celebration<br>of Marty authored non-fiction books<br>published since the 19th century as jent<br>has articulated many times before when<br>discussing this project in public fora<br>and started as a way to challenge a<br>perception that Marty would knew uh to<br>scholarly research and that books were<br>not a part of mar life and that's just<br>not true so we compiled a select list of<br>150 books now 180 was published by the<br>Royal Society there was a big launch at<br>Parliament for it a Tong was created for<br>that carv by Lin he it's in the Central<br>Library going to have a look at it uh<br>and it's um and a book yay it's will be<br>published next year uh by aago<br>University press called books of manner<br>um and this book has a series of very<br>short Reflections by an amazing<br>Collective of people about why Marty<br>writing and Marty non fiction books<br>matter uh in the past present and in the<br>future so I contributed a chapter on the<br>dedications and acknowledgements and the<br>books uh on our tarangi list um and I<br>really enjoyed doing that it's just in<br>no uh and these things these dedications<br>and acknowledgements have a lot in<br>common with I ipls dedications like an<br>IPL do many things they greet the past<br>they pay tribute to those who' have gone<br>before us and acknowledge and greet<br>special people in our lives thanks Loy<br>acknowledgements like an IPL are an<br>opportunity to recognize those people<br>who have advised supported cared for and<br>L their money to a project so many<br>thanks to my friends all my students<br>past and present and all my<br>collaborators who have played a role in<br>enriching my intellectual life um I've<br>had a wonderful time doing research um<br>on all of these different uh projects um<br>it's been a real Joy um doing this work<br>and in our Mii and our acknowledgements<br>in our books we also set out our<br>responsib abilities to our readers where<br>we can be explicit about the aim of our<br>book now this might be to achieve social<br>justice to highlight historical legacies<br>to demonstrate Mary resistance and<br>Leadership to create positive change to<br>pass on knowledge and to strengthen<br>identity one of the things I've aimed to<br>do in my research is to bring out the<br>variety of mar experience in the past<br>and that's an experience that be<br>centered in family uh and community and<br>to give money uh to Marty woman's<br>narrative which I hope I've achieved uh<br>across my career whether that's in the<br>context of sha whaling and Kito<br>communities uh or uh at a more National<br>level during the second world war I've<br>aspired to make a small contribution a<br>tiny contribution to a weighty Marty<br>scholarship that exists today and I've<br>aspired to hopefully play a role um in<br>inspiring the next generation of<br>thinkers writers and<br>Scholars because books are forever uh<br>and always uh reaching a new audience<br>the future of Marty research and<br>scholarship is full of endless uh<br>possibilities so I hope future<br>historians will completely rethink<br>critique extend and improve uh my<br>work so as you can probably tell from<br>tonight's<br>presentation I quite like writing books<br>and here are some more of<br>them they are my preferred medium um and<br>that's because um I grew up with a lot<br>of books my dad on day wasn't working<br>took us to the library um to get lots of<br>books out um we did that on a regular<br>basis my parents didn't have much money<br>for buying books but going to the<br>library was a really important part of<br>our life and spending time with our dad<br>as well who we didn't seen that much of<br>um so they really are my preferred<br>medium I love them that's because books<br>are open world so did that for me they<br>reach wide audiences and I think that's<br>what historians are their best at<br>communicating um through books about our<br>past uh and they initiate uh new<br>conversations they are never the last<br>word but always the beginning of<br>something new kamoto thank you very much<br>here so as the pro Vice Chancellor of<br>the division of humanities in which<br>we're very proud to claim history and<br>Angela as a part of our farno it's my<br>great pleasure to offer a vote of thanks<br>um and I want to do that by pointing out<br>just a couple of features of who Angela<br>is and who what her scholarship is um<br>that I hope kind of feed into what we've<br>seen tonight so so the first feature I<br>want to acknowledge and single out is um<br>and and it was you picked up at the<br>end that is amazing scholarship um and<br>it is wonderful to see and it isn't just<br>about writing a book what sits behind<br>all of that is incredible detailed and<br>careful analysis it involves archival<br>and oral histories it involves thousands<br>of conversations and research meetings<br>and trips and never quite knowing what<br>you're going to discover and the<br>painstaking work of bringing all that<br>together and and in doing that you're<br>testing assumptions and you're testing<br>received wisdoms about how we understand<br>our world and in so doing Angela you<br>have helped to reveal more of our world<br>to us and to deepen our understanding of<br>humanity and particularly in your work<br>our understanding of the complicated<br>relationships that make up Humanity um<br>you've done a whole lot but you know<br>you've shown the influence and<br>centrality of indigenous women on our<br>National History you have shown the<br>connection between National and overseas<br>service and the home front um you've<br>shown how that made a significant impact<br>on Marty Collective organization on<br>Marty political autonomy um on Marty<br>self-determination and those are all<br>things that have added beautifully to<br>our knowledge and understanding of who<br>we are as a nation so Koda thank you for<br>that thank you for the huge amount of<br>work that that screenshot<br>represents and secondly I want to also<br>acknowledge and something that didn't<br>come out in um her address and and<br>rightly so but as PVC I want to<br>acknowledge it and that is that um as<br>academics um we play the role we're<br>often told and it's in legislation we<br>play the role of critic and conscience<br>um of our<br>society but for some academics<br>playing that role means that we speak<br>into areas and we voice opinions that<br>sadly can become the target of unwanted<br>unnecessary and at times appalling<br>behavior and Angela as and a as an as an<br>expert in feminine history and in<br>indigenous history and Marty history and<br>as her and a position her position as a<br>wah<br>has found herself in the line of some of<br>those attacks and that that that stuff<br>we don't talk about a lot um and we work<br>behind the scenes to reduce and prevent<br>that but I want to acknowledge you<br>tonight um for what that does at times<br>um and how much it can cost you<br>personally to continue on to bring this<br>history out to us um it's not behavior<br>that we want to um condone or tolerate<br>in this University<br>and um I want to thank you for your<br>courage and your commitment to your<br>discipline and to knowledge to continue<br>on in in your pursuit of knowledge for<br>the rest of us and I want to acknowledge<br>too that a part of being able to do that<br>every day and do it as well as you do it<br>is that you have formed around you a<br>community of support support that you<br>give to others and support that you<br>receive and you know you acknowledge<br>that yourself but I want to say um thank<br>you thank you for doing that thank you<br>for the role you play in raising up<br>other Marty academics and for the key<br>part that you have played in the history<br>ataka<br>so<br>Angela<br>Kam toah<br>to<br>to I have the great pleasure of<br>providing you with a we token of our<br>appreciation<br>and also something that marks this<br>K and to you our audience itano those<br>online and those here in<br>person in this room a huge thank you<br>thank you that your presence here is a<br>sign of respect and eth for Angela um<br>and it marks the fact that she is<br>certainly a tonga for this University<br>and for the Humanities so thank you for<br>coming and I invite you to join us over<br>in the staff club now it's just across<br>the way it's easy to get lost and<br>disappear don't go to the staff club uh<br>and join us for um a cup of tea and some<br>Kai and a chance to celebrate um and<br>wish Angela all the best for these<br>achievements so KY T thank you so much</p></main><footer style="margin-top: 2rem; background: #0001; padding: 2rem; text-align: center;"><p>We Are The University</p><ul
