uh firstly to get an<br>honor doctorate is is big enough but<br>actually having it at uh at your own<br>morai is truly is truly the icing on the<br>cake and it's a huge honor so thank you<br>so much really appreciate it to you s<br>Jane um Deputy Vice Chancellor Mai thank<br>you for your support and making this<br>happen uh to you Sandy Sandy Morrison I<br>think had a little bit to do with<br>to my mate Professor Tom<br>Ro I don't think either of us thought<br>that we would both have titles like we<br>have right now back in those days of<br>University but it's so good to have you<br>here uh and I'm I'm sorry that Robin<br>wasn't be able to here be with us as<br>well uh and others who looked after us<br>when we're were at<br>University now for those there's a<br>camera inside and I hope those well back<br>out there are watching I need to clarify<br>a few things to my ewi about what's<br>actually happened today firstly for<br>those of them who um believe that I<br>might have diverted off to a new medical<br>career no I cannot fix<br>bones I can't do that I cannot fix<br>broken hearts like those belonging to<br>some Warriors fans now and<br>again I cannot fix bank<br>accounts uh really not too much has<br>changed I think but this is a huge honor<br>for me for Edon and for Alan so I hope<br>all of you feel that this is an honor<br>well I have to say I feel a bit of a<br>fraud to be<br>frank I say this because when I did my<br>I spent months and months and months<br>gathering information on everything I<br>could about this m ey only to have my D<br>written all over it in red<br>pen by the honorable sir<br>hid as I look back now was probably<br>Justified at the time I didn't think<br>much of it uh so uh I cannot claim to be<br>some sort of H superhuman<br>on the second reason I say I'm a bit of<br>a fraud is that I saw it on I working<br>diligently on her doctorate for<br>years all part-time late nights the<br>weekends the<br>holidays writing and writing and writing<br>and zooms and more writing but she did<br>it and I know for a fact that getting a<br>doctorate is no small<br>undertaking she worked at backside all<br>one doesn't seem fear<br>really um but she joins her sister araro<br>and her brother R all of whom have<br>so so uh that has to tell you<br>my now as I said at the time when she<br>graduated I know that she actually met<br>this is Ed she she had another partner<br>tribe the third reason I say that I feel<br>a little bit inadequate is because I did<br>a bit of<br>research uh and I'm joining a list of<br>names of people who I have and who who<br>have and still do carry sign significant<br>Manor I hold the greatest respect for<br>all of<br>them I'm truly humbled to sit alongside<br>very distinguished Marty leaders<br>today um Su Hud Jones<br>jury Kina<br>ma sir the honorable sir Peter tapsel<br>hia R man manuu been<br>Morrison Jews<br>kingu Helen Clark s James buer swi<br>Gardner I mean there's some there's some<br>kings and queens in<br>there there's some Dames and some s in<br>there and former Prime Ministers as well<br>the best I can say I can do is that I've<br>I've actually met some kings and queens<br>met a<br>princess I've met some Dames and some s<br>and sat next to Prime<br>Ministers I went to school with the King<br>was taught by some of this group of<br>people that I mentioned and was told off<br>by one or two of them as well I have to<br>say that I feel hugely humbled to be put<br>on a list uh that has<br>those significant icons of the alari and<br>Al uh how we get to this day however<br>is just as important as the day<br>itself I was actually advised by the<br>University of his intention to offer me<br>this honor a few years ago in and around<br>Co before I left my position at the<br>W there were a few people ahead of me in<br>the form of sir wardner and Sir uu I<br>thought I better get in the back of the<br>line they were a little bit carried a<br>little bit more money than me but truly<br>um I wanted to step aside to allow Edon<br>to have her day having been in the<br>Limelight through politics and my<br>singing<br>career I wanted to uh allow my wife<br>edona to go first she had been the she<br>had been on the PHD Journey the pH<br>Journey what am I talking about the<br>doctorate Journey for some time as I<br>mentioned earlier all on top of her own<br>e matters farno and politics I wanted to<br>celebrate her efforts it was tough going<br>two years ago that uh she had to even<br>separate out from going to tangis which<br>took a bit of a toll simply to focus on<br>getting her uh her thesis in so to<br>receive a letter on the 21st sorry in<br>February<br>20121 with the title Award of the degree<br>of honorary doctorate at the University<br>of walor blew me<br>away um it hasn't been on my mind too<br>much of these last couple of years to be<br>fair but as it happens one year ago in<br>August all of our were in denan where<br>Edon was to defend her doctorate what<br>that means is that she has to answer<br>questions from her examiners about her<br>writings at the end of that time uh the<br>chief examiner told us that she had<br>achieved everything so would be awarded<br>her doctorate we were naturally really<br>happy over the moon so we went for K to<br>celebrate and then we went went to the<br>home of her mentor and supervisor and<br>friend the professor Richie pton a<br>world-renowned academic he was suffering<br>from cancer at the time and that was the<br>last time that we were with him he sadly<br>passed away late last year on the way to<br>his house talking about one year ago I<br>received a call from the doctor as we<br>arrived outside his house the doctor on<br>the phone with Ed and rook in the in the<br>car said these famous words<br>theor I do not like to do this on the<br>phone but your results are back and I<br>need to tell you that you have stage<br>four prostate<br>cancer from being one of the best days<br>in our lives within ours things went to<br>Rock Bottom and as it happened the very<br>next day was adon's birthday so to be<br>here today after everything that has<br>happened uh in our lives is hugely<br>special<br>it's extra special because of you you<br>have arrived who have come today the<br>interactions the relationships I've had<br>with many of you have changed my life<br>report I looked at the website and it<br>said achieving an un honorary doctorate<br>is not an easy Fe I thought it was<br>pretty easy they just gave it to<br>me it requires a significant amount of<br>dedication hard work and achievement and<br>specific field in a specific field or<br>contribution to society the honorary<br>degree may be offered to a person who<br>has contributed significantly to the<br>cultural scientific and or Social<br>Development of the state nation and<br>world<br>who the contribution should be sustained<br>over a period of years and should be<br>last and should be lasting in nature<br>it's given to people or organizations<br>who have made significant contribution<br>to to their field and deserve<br>recognition<br>so that's a very high bar I'm not sure I<br>deserve it but I appreciate the the uh I<br>appreciate the effort that's been done<br>for today and I appreciate the fact that<br>I actually have got it na people are<br>known for their humility as you would<br>have heard<br>already it doesn't necessarily mean<br>because I have a doctorate that I'm in<br>authority on Rugby League teams for<br>example but in the end I'll take<br>to all of those of you um to to um to<br>thank you all I just want to firstly say<br>thank you to Edon for always being<br>beside me my achievements are a result<br>of you being you being there Tiding up<br>the pieces keeping the home fires<br>burning and even with your own Mahi you<br>and I are so different in some areas of<br>life and yet clearly most often we are<br>one<br>mind I love you<br>I want to thank my children luckily<br>they've grown up with awesome role<br>models other than their<br>father like the uncles and aunties<br>they're so very lucky I want to thank<br>mywi na dangi for putting on this day<br>very humbling uh for the work in<br>particular from the cookie Bears out<br>there of getting your Co ready um and I<br>just want to say that the B looks really<br>um uh finally I want to thank again all<br>of you for coming from far and wide to<br>be here today and for those who have<br>been watching on the<br>broadcast my political career
