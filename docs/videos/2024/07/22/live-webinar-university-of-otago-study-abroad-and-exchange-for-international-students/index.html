team and<br>joining me is<br>ala good afternoon as well um my name's<br>ala and I look after this study abroad<br>with our lovely colleague mag yes uh<br>during today's webinar you're welcome to<br>ask questions in our live Q&amp;A box and<br>our fantastic colleague Mig will be in<br>the background uh looking to help you<br>out with those questions now we just<br>want to make sure everyone who's joining<br>us live today is familiar with this<br>particular topic for the webinar so this<br>is very specific to uh students in our<br>partner universities who have an<br>agreement with us for exchange studies<br>or for study abroad and so in case<br>you're joining us today and we're hoping<br>to get information about scholarships or<br>PhD or full degrees this isn't really<br>the webinar for you but we're happy to<br>uh share with you some links to some of<br>our other webinars we've had uh just in<br>recent time focused on those specific<br>topics and degree types but if you are<br>here to hear a little bit about<br>University of atago and learn about the<br>study board and exchange options and the<br>amazing opportunity to come and spend<br>one or two semesters with us then<br>welcome on in we have got a fantastic<br>agenda for you and a lot of topics to go<br>through as we introduce you to uh study<br>abroad and exchange at<br>otago so first up we're going to kick<br>start with an introduction to New<br>Zealand and denan so a warm welcome to<br>you uh to New Zealand Aro uh we are a<br>country of five million people we have<br>three official languages English Tero<br>Mai our indigenous language and New<br>Zealand sign language and in terms of<br>global rankings there's a lot of great<br>indicators uh present on the slide as<br>you can see we have recently been ranked<br>the most beautiful country in the world<br>uh which I think we can agree with that<br>makes sense to us well we're pretty<br>lucky here uh we're certainly um high up<br>in other important indicators for<br>instance human rights or human Freedom<br>we are second in the world uh for that<br>third least corrupt country in the world<br>fourth safest country that's a good one<br>to share with parents uh fourth most<br>gender equal country in the world we're<br>pretty happy about 11th happiest and<br>certainly doing well in Innovation and<br>sustainable competitiveness too so as a<br>country a pretty cool destination to<br>come something very unique and special<br>however are our indigenous is our<br>indigenous culture and our Mali<br>principles of manakit Tanga which really<br>refer or represent uh topics such as<br>Hospitality or kindness generosity and<br>support and as an international student<br>coming to New Zealand this is uh<br>something that you will experience and<br>feel welcomed in our country and at our<br>University so studying in New Zealand<br>what does that look like well it's handy<br>to know that all eight universities in<br>New Zealand rank in the top 3% in the<br>world we are the number one<br>English-speaking Country For Preparing<br>students for the future which frankly is<br>what education really is all about we do<br>offer a world-class education system and<br>some of the ways in which we teach were<br>uh share our um sort of ation experience<br>uh through things like critical thinking<br>uh we try to instill uh those sorts of<br>attributes we encourage Hands On<br>Learning working collaboratively problem<br>solving and<br>creativity we are considered the second<br>best country in the world for producing<br>graduates with problem solving skills we<br>have great research opportunities here<br>and are well connected uh with<br>universities around the world and in<br>fact New Zealand was the first country<br>to adopt a special code of practice<br>where we look where we must and ensure<br>uh the well-being uh of our<br>International and domestic<br>students okay so we the heree Elba I'd<br>like to know well I can see on the map<br>here we're in the south island of New<br>Zealand uh and as you can see as we<br>enter in the harbor coming into denan<br>this is already setting the scene to be<br>a beautiful location how do we get there<br>well from uh ockland or Christ Church<br>those are the main International ports<br>uh or airports in which you land um from<br>Oakland it's just a 1 hour 45 flight<br>down to denen or from Christ Church a 55<br>minute connection down to denen uh it's<br>also not so far from Australia typically<br>3-hour flight if you come through<br>Australia to fly to us uh but uh that's<br>kind of gives you a sense of where we<br>are located all right let's hear about<br>Den Elber why denan a really beautiful<br>city located in the South Island like<br>Megan said sister city to Edinburgh<br>actually um we're really proud that it's<br>the UNESCO city of literature as well um<br>but I think what really um makes denan<br>stand uh stand apart from other cities<br>in New Zealand it's truly a University<br>City a campus lifestyle and the<br>population is very much reflected in<br>that so it's very young population um<br>and again very happy population 84% of<br>people um rate their quality of life as<br>being good or extremely good so really<br>the Beating Heart of denan is the<br>University and and we really love it<br>here um you're learning from the<br>brightest so we have the highest<br>concentration of postgraduate<br>qualifications living right here in the<br>city and it's also considerably<br>affordable compared to other cities in<br>New Zealand as well it's a great<br>lifestyle I've been here for six years<br>and I love it here so fantastic and as<br>you said Alber it's a university city<br>it's a student City uh and maybe you<br>want to highlight some of the kind of<br>give us a sense of what we see on this<br>slide yes so this this is a great aerial<br>shot of denan um we see that it's uh<br>bordered by a beautiful water so we're<br>located in the mouth of the aago<br>peninsula uh so we've got the ocean on<br>one side but we've got beautiful<br>waterways uh surrounding you can see the<br>university is just located there on the<br>yellow pinpoint and very close to that<br>is the Octagon which is the city center<br>uh so really everything's quite<br>accessible with an easy walking distance<br>and not just um access to the city we<br>have um the Great doors really right on<br>our doorstep whether that's the beaches<br>like St Clair but that's actually one of<br>24 beaches we have around denen uh but<br>we also have great access to Wildlife<br>like the the little blue penguin or the<br>a royal Albatross um in the uh end of<br>the atago peninsula and really um just<br>access to all of the great um Outdoors<br>surrounding the city as<br>well fantastic now weather is often a<br>topic uh that we're asked about and I<br>think it's fair to say we have Four<br>Seasons but not as Extreme as say Europe<br>for instance or um uh perhaps North<br>America so moderate Four Seasons so for<br>sure we have a beautiful spring with u<br>Magnolia and cherry blossoms coming out<br>uh summertime is fantastic to explore<br>all those features great surfing here uh<br>and um and then of course we move into<br>Autumn one of our favorite Seasons it's<br>truly beautiful on the campus around<br>that time with the change of leaves of<br>course and winter now now I always like<br>to highlight that there is one photo<br>depicting snow but it's not really very<br>realistic it's very rare for us to get<br>snow in denan City the snow tends to<br>stick around on the mountains further in<br>central atago so when something like<br>that happens pretty much it's national<br>news uh we get very excited we run<br>outside and try to make a snowman but<br>there's really not enough and it's<br>melted by the end of the day typically<br>for winter so um don't worry you won't<br>be coming to snow if you're from Canada<br>for instance or perhaps Sweden or Norway<br>you this is<br>nothing all right denan what a cool<br>place to hang out as a student because<br>it's it's a small City but it's big<br>enough to have everything you need right<br>yes and it has a great offering in terms<br>of um food options from International<br>options around the world but also in<br>terms of recreation uh outside of the<br>University environment there's so much<br>that you can do within the city as well<br>um so make sure to check it out because<br>there's uh there's a lot on offer and of<br>of course one of the great things about<br>our location in the south island of New<br>Zealand is we're pretty fortunate to<br>have some of New Zealand's most premium<br>most famous tourism kind of um uh Scenic<br>destinations just a few hours drive from<br>our place so here we see wanica um with<br>the mountains there uh we're moving up<br>to Roy's Peak a fantastic hike that's<br>actually our wonderful colleague Terry<br>up on the um up on the top of Roy Peak<br>um if you're into snow Sports this is<br>where you go about 3 and 1 half hours<br>drive 3 to 4 hours drive to get up to<br>wanica or Queenstown four fantastic ski<br>um ski Mountains for snowboarding and<br>skiing of course all around our region<br>there's awesome opportun opportunities<br>for hiking and kaying I mean just<br>stunning experiences actually we have<br>some of the great walks of New Zealand<br>in our um part of the country and really<br>just so convenient just three or four<br>hours drive out of denan so weekends<br>this is what you doing when you're a<br>study abroad and exchange<br>student all right let's talk a little<br>bit about the University of atago so we<br>are New Zealand's first University we<br>were established in<br>1869 and we are considered New Zealand's<br>top university for Education performance<br>by our national indicators or national<br>government indicators we are at a global<br>level ranked among the world's top 1% of<br>universities worldwide and we have about<br>21,000 students with uh around 200 half<br>thousand International students coming<br>from 90 countries around the world but<br>what's quite unique and special about<br>Oto is that 86% of our whole student<br>body they're not originally from denan<br>or the city this means that students<br>have moved down from ockland and<br>Wellington all around New Zealand to<br>come specifically to Oto as well as<br>students coming from around the world<br>and that creates a very different campus<br>environment to what you'll find uh in<br>most countries or places uh it's a real<br>destination University and it's a very<br>social Vibe because people are moving<br>they're not from here so they're kind of<br>really more encouraged to make friends<br>find friends and start their new<br>networks so as an international student<br>this is a great environment for you too<br>there's plenty of study options um over<br>you know close to 200 different subject<br>areas and we're rated Five Star Plus<br>with the uh Qs quality ratings as well<br>and one of my favorite rankings is of<br>course beautiful campuses because at<br>Taro true is something stunning uh it's<br>a campus that you won't find anywhere<br>else in New Zealand or Australia and<br>it's considered to be actually one of<br>the most beautiful campuses in the world<br>according to the Times Higher Education<br>student voice ranking a couple of years<br>ago all right in terms of global<br>academic and research rankings it's<br>great to know ataro is uh formerly<br>ranked 214th best in the world uh but as<br>you can see in this slide we're ranked<br>extremely highly in a number of specific<br>subject areas<br>we're actually the only New Zealand<br>University to have a subject ranked in<br>the top 20 in the world and that's our<br>sports related science 12th best in the<br>world pretty awesome if you're<br>interested in sports science um and<br>sports management and sports related uh<br>subjects uh but you can see here<br>Dentistry as another example tourism<br>very highly ranked but across the uh<br>slide you'll see such a diverse range of<br>subjects a real breadth and depth of uh<br>expertise and in terms of research and<br>in teaching so so you know when you come<br>to otago you're going to have a very<br>high quality of teaching and the chance<br>to interact with some of some of the<br>world's leading academics in these<br>areas all right I've talked a lot your<br>turn so as a study abroad student and<br>like Megan said you can come and join us<br>for a semester or two and while you're<br>here uh not only you have great access<br>to the to the Great Outdoors but again<br>you'll have excellent um education and<br>learning experience here and you can do<br>that throughout um our great academic<br>division so that's within Health<br>Sciences science business Humanities um<br>and we also have our pathway in English<br>Language Center within the Health<br>Sciences which is uh very renowned for<br>itago we are uh one of two medical<br>schools in all of New Zealand and we're<br>very proud that we're the only dental<br>school in New Zealand as well so our<br>Health Sciences are very um<br>well-renowned and well respected uh So<br>within health and biomedical Sciences as<br>a study abroad student this is um some<br>examples of uh some papers or topics or<br>subjects uh that's what we call them<br>here um some of the things that you can<br>delve into uh there's different<br>offerings in semester one and semester<br>two um but very interesting topics and<br>again um taught by World leading<br>researchers as well and it's probably<br>handy to know if you are in a<br>professional kind of health program uh<br>whilst it's not possible normally to do<br>exchange or study abroad into our<br>equivalent Health uh professional<br>program<br>these are examples of very strongly<br>related courses that you do have access<br>to so as a health uh student there are<br>certainly possibilities to take uh<br>courses of relevance to your program<br>back home uh and dip into uh perhaps<br>courses not offered at your home<br>Institute as well science is another<br>very uh strong Division and particularly<br>because we are in New Zealand there's<br>great fieldwork opportunities um but<br>also a diversity of subjects that you<br>can um that you can delve into uh and<br>within different themes as well we're<br>looking at environment sustain<br>sustainability and climate change um so<br>New Zealand is a very sustainability<br>focused country and that's uh that makes<br>us a great place to um to delve into<br>those topics um so we can see here again<br>um things about environment organization<br>sustainability um and we have a breadth<br>of subjects that are New Zealand focused<br>so students that want to hear to come<br>here to get that flavor of New Zealand<br>um definitely have options to do that<br>again Marine Science animals and Life<br>Sciences like we mentioned located in<br>the atago peninsula the Marine Science<br>Department is um is very well-renowned<br>like I said before and quite unique at a<br>taro because not only do we have um of<br>course we're surrounded by water and<br>have magnificent glaciers lakes uh and<br>so forth within our region uh we're also<br>closer toward the Antarctic and then<br>also the Pacific Islands so we have a<br>really strong breadth of research and<br>activity going on within the Marine<br>World given our very unique location in<br>the world and you can see there that<br>there's um a number of subjects that not<br>only are New Zealand specific but that<br>have a very strong fieldwork component<br>so you're not just going to be in our<br>great facilities and Labs here right on<br>campus but you're going to be going out<br>in the field and getting to explore and<br>experience the outdoors um through that<br>learning lens as well um physical<br>sciences as well you can see the topics<br>that we have here um really across all<br>of the Sciences I think it's a great<br>opportunity to come um and experience<br>that Sport and exercise and well-being<br>very highly ranked as well so it's a<br>good thing to consider if you're within<br>that um discipline um and going into<br>business our division of um business uh<br>our atago business school is a located<br>in an incredible building here we've got<br>our own Bloomberg lab as well so you get<br>um that experience of what Stock<br>Exchange and trade is like right here on<br>campus um and again a bread of subjects<br>with that New Zealand Focus as well uh<br>tourism we're very well known for<br>tourism as well um and again a such a<br>unique location to study tourism not<br>only in New Zealand as a country but our<br>particular part of the country connected<br>with Queenstown and Monica uh Queenstown<br>is a major hub for tourism of course uh<br>but many unique and diverse tourism uh<br>operators here as well vent your C it<br>over the world St<br>yeah well the humanities now uh I'm a<br>bit of a Humanities grad actually uh<br>it's fair to say but once again extreme<br>breadth uh of subject areas taught at<br>atago um in this sort of space and<br>therefore plenty of opportunities to<br>study but I guess some favorite topics<br>for our exchange and study abroad<br>student are our indigenous studies or<br>studies focused on Mai and Pacific uh<br>cultures you might have some thoughts on<br>that Albert yeah and it's it's for<br>students that want to um are thinking<br>about what papers or subjects to select<br>I highly recommend um one of these to be<br>uh something that you consider because<br>as you're here in alota New Zealand it's<br>a great opportunity like you say to<br>immerse yourself in the local culture<br>Mai 108 happens to be one of one of our<br>most popular papers among study abroad<br>and exchange students and for someone<br>who's been fortunate enough to<br>participate in waata and kapahaka which<br>is M Performing Arts this is a great<br>opportunity to be able to experience<br>that um so yes highly recommend uh to<br>consider any subject within um the<br>indigenous<br>scope yes indeed and um in terms of<br>education and teaching is a sort of a<br>subject theme and topic otago has uh an<br>outstanding College of Education and we<br>offer subjects uh across the um the<br>bread of Education really interesting<br>topics uh our particular University uh<br>has been very much involved over the<br>years in influencing and designing<br>curriculum for the country uh we train<br>many of the teachers of New Zealand so<br>this is a great chance to learn a little<br>bit about policy and education in New<br>Zealand uh and expand your your social<br>lens on that as well and of course the<br>classic topics uh across other areas of<br>the humanities so really again a real<br>breadth of subjects obviously again we<br>see topics like New Zealand politics and<br>introduction uh this is always something<br>interesting to learn uh when living in a<br>different country for a period also<br>great offerings across law psychology<br>and sociology again all of these slides<br>are just examples um this isn't a full<br>comprehensive list it's just to give you<br>a sense uh of the breadth of subjects<br>and particular topics that you may wish<br>to consider coming for an exchange or<br>study<br>abroad and media studies of course we're<br>friends with media we love the<br>media uh a lot of co-options uh within<br>that as well as even performing<br>arts and a again great facilities as<br>well with the opening of The New School<br>of Performing Arts incredible Sound<br>Studio and music room um so yeah it's<br>also another opportunity to to get to<br>access all of these incredible spaces<br>around campus so let's look at life in<br>the classroom Ela you want to share a<br>little bit about that sure um so as a<br>student here um your time will be<br>dedicated to a number of different<br>things so lectures are really like the<br>main um delivery method where you get a<br>lot of the information from your core<br>papers uh they're usually 50 minutes of<br>teaching um and that's really where you<br>get the bulk of the information um but<br>you will have opportunity to have more<br>uh one-on-one contact with your um um<br>teachers or academic staff and you'll be<br>able to do that in tutorials um so those<br>are smaller group sessions um where you<br>will have that opportunity to have more<br>open discussions<br>um if you're in any of the Sciences or<br>you have lab work you'll have<br>experiments and you'll have the<br>opportunity again to access our<br>incredible facilities our meler labs are<br>uh an incredible space and uh we've got<br>incredible equipment as well to be able<br>to do that kind of research um and then<br>again uh if you have uh the opportunity<br>to get out in the field and do some um<br>work outside of the labs there's<br>incredible uh field work opportunities<br>not just here in Denon but again in the<br>surrounding areas and that covers a<br>number of different subjects uh not just<br>within the Sciences but we can see<br>within the humanities there's visits to<br>the mud eyes and um yeah excursions<br>throughout<br>yeah really uh taking your uh taking<br>learning outside of the classroom which<br>is always fun all right so let's<br>consider how is it how do you come here<br>how can you uh be accepted as a study<br>abroard or exchange student so firstly<br>it's helpful to understand the New<br>Zealand Academic Year and of course<br>depending on where you are right now we<br>may well be a bit opposite to you so we<br>start our Academic Year in February and<br>that's summertime for us so the semester<br>one is uh typic February to Mid June uh<br>then we move into semester 2 which is<br>winter for us starting in July and uh<br>finishing up in late spring early summer<br>in November we do also have a summer<br>school period uh in January this is of<br>course a much more limited offering in<br>terms of courses you can take so<br>typically most of our students are<br>coming for semester 1 or semester 2 both<br>times of year are great both times of<br>year give you different opportunities<br>for activities uh and studies and um<br>yeah that's kind of how the the Academic<br>Year looks for us so in terms of um your<br>entrance requirements you must be<br>currently enrolled at uh at one of our<br>International tertiary Partners at a at<br>a university or an equivalent uh<br>accredited tery<br>institution uh you should normally need<br>to have completed at least one semester<br>of full-time study at uh a university or<br>tertiary Institute in order to be<br>eligible to come to us for study of<br>broader Exchange in terms of the<br>academic grade and English language<br>requirements you'll need to refer to<br>your home Institute or study abroad<br>provider because whilst we have a<br>certain level which uh kind of um uh for<br>English for instance uh that you should<br>have a 6.0 uh typically for an I test<br>but there are many exemptions to that<br>according to where you've studied in the<br>language of instruction you've studied<br>in but the thing is to be uh nominated<br>to come on an exchange your home<br>Institute sorry Institute May well have<br>additional criteria for you to meet or a<br>higher level for grade performance in<br>order to be selected likewise uh with<br>our study abroad partner institutes they<br>may also have a higher or different<br>level of criteria for you to be selected<br>by them to come to us so the critical<br>step actually is to talk to your home<br>institutions International office or<br>Global office to find out how to come uh<br>and what it takes to be nominated so<br>once you've um understood and found out<br>that detail at your home Institute uh<br>then working with them uh you uh move<br>forward to the next steps to be<br>nominated uh to come to otago and then<br>from there you make a an application<br>once you've been formally accepted uh or<br>nominated so once again the first step<br>really is all about talking to your home<br>Institute in the main uh their<br>International or Global office can tell<br>you your options and whether they<br>actually have an exchange agreement with<br>the Taro or a study abroad agreement and<br>what that actually means at a practical<br>level and what it takes for them to<br>nominate<br>you so um some key application dates<br>just to think about in terms of planning<br>moving forward uh each year at our end<br>the deadline for students to apply to<br>come in our February semester as a study<br>abroader um student is December uh<br>however if um you're coming in as an<br>exchange student there's a slightly<br>different deadline to that uh and of<br>course the main deadline you need to be<br>concerned with is your own home<br>institutes deadlines to be selected and<br>nominated uh<br>accordingly if you are nominated and<br>selected to come to a Targo then uh<br>you'll also in addition to placing your<br>actual application to us for studies<br>you'll also want to be applying for our<br>accommodation and accommodation<br>applications are open in August to<br>November uh for our February intake uh<br>and it's handy to know that uniflex<br>contracts start in January early January<br>each year uh for the semester<br>one uh so that of course is our Focus<br>for this particular presentation on<br>semester one February next year so let's<br>delve a little bit more into<br>accommodation because that of course is<br>always a number one concern for folk<br>when they're looking to move overseas<br>take it away Al yeah we mentioned UNIF<br>Flats so that's uh what we call our<br>University Flats so it's University on<br>accommodation um but they're very uh<br>quirky houses located and dotted around<br>um the the periphery of the University<br>so everything's within easy walking<br>distance and I love when I say quirky is<br>that all the houses feel like they have<br>their own personality they're not um<br>just choca block all exactly the same<br>which I really like um So within uni<br>Flats it's uh a great that as um from<br>aaga that we can guarantee this form of<br>accommodation for study abroad and<br>exchange students um and within a uni FL<br>uh within that one fee you'll have your<br>own private bedroom uh you'll have<br>access to Shared facilities like the<br>kitchen um lounge and laundry so each<br>uni flat comes with its own laundry<br>facility which is great and then within<br>that as well as all of your rent your<br>utilities maintenance all of the support<br>uh that comes with um being a part of<br>the uni Flats Community um and the<br>social programming as well um so it's a<br>very Lively uh Community right here on<br>campus again very conven venient because<br>it's within easy walking distance of<br>your classes and lectures um and the<br>flats come fully furnished so you don't<br>have to worry about um getting furniture<br>or needing to to fill your your room<br>while you're<br>here that's right and uh something quite<br>unique with the uni Flats is that within<br>that um sort of community of uni Flats<br>we also have two special sustainability<br>neighborhoods now you've certainly<br>visited those a few times uh during your<br>time time with us do you want to share<br>what does that mean what does that mean<br>for a student yeah so for students that<br>do have an interest in sustainability uh<br>those two neighborhoods it's a a special<br>application process so you we do want to<br>see an expression of interest that you<br>that you that you're keen on<br>sustainability but it's a community of<br>houses where um they share uh veggie<br>plots and Gardens um there's a beehive<br>there's a composting units so it's<br>really students that want to get<br>involved and and kind of yeah like<br>exercise the green thumbs nice so that's<br>a unique rather unique offering and of<br>course overall the uni flats are super<br>unique uh for for most uh opportunities<br>that you may wish to consider because of<br>the fact and the way that we match up<br>students together and you are housed<br>with a New Zealand student a kiwi host<br>so because we match you up together<br>based on your personality and interests<br>this means you have a direct group of<br>friends to live with and start to hang<br>out with and start to plan excursions<br>with and explore and really enjoy your<br>time both academically and uh kind of<br>The Wider uh opportunity of being in New<br>Zealand it's such a unique and cool<br>concept it makes it very easy for our<br>study abroad and exchange students to<br>fit in really fast and make them most of<br>that one or two semesters with us yeah<br>and like Megan mentioned having a qwi<br>host at home with you it's kind of like<br>your your sounding board or that go-to<br>person that can provide that local<br>knowledge or the or the local<br>perspective as well so it's great to<br>have living in your own home yeah and I<br>think the other cool thing about the<br>UNIF Flats is that kind of program of<br>events and activities that they run<br>themselves and that's um you know<br>anything from uh popup soup station with<br>hot cheese rolls which is a local uh<br>kind of a snack that we like here uh<br>sort of just a Qui kind of a quick drop<br>in Social situation through to more<br>formal excursions uh up to one of our<br>marai or meeting houses uh to experience<br>Mari culture a little bit more um there<br>are other cool things oh I know my<br>favorite the the dogs we a few of us few<br>of the staff bring in their dogs and you<br>can drop in and have a bit of a cuddle<br>with the dog in case you're missing<br>yours from home that type of thing but<br>there's a whole range of different<br>activities yeah yeah if you wanted to go<br>see the Royal avatr with the little blue<br>penguins or they even did a sheep<br>sharing activity as well to really get<br>immersed in the local New Zealand<br>culture so there's there's a lot of<br>options you not only to engage with your<br>housemates but like you said engage with<br>a wider uni Flats Community yeah so when<br>you come to a tago as a study of Brader<br>exchange student you're not just living<br>in a house you're living as a part of a<br>community uh and we really look out for<br>you and try to give you a great<br>experience with<br>this and here we have uh some some great<br>content from some of our students living<br>within the UNIF Flats Community um so we<br>have Sid there showing a little bit of<br>uh his home and his room we have have um<br>there's a lot of people that give uh<br>great feedback on the size of their<br>rooms as well um and they're private<br>rooms of course we don't share rooms<br>that's weird for us so uh private room<br>um but a shed kitchen shed bathroom shed<br>laundry and typically you kind of try to<br>make it work maybe have a shared cooking<br>roster or um all cook together uh and of<br>course uh you know take your leftovers<br>or pop back home to heat it up for lunch<br>that type of thing um but really a fun<br>social time too and I think the key<br>thing is also it's your chance to live<br>like a denan Oto student um which is<br>something unique for our study abroad<br>and exchange students to have it<br>experience and in the second video again<br>we'll see just how close really uni<br>flats are to the main campus like I said<br>they're dotted around the periphery of<br>the campus so no uni flat is really more<br>than a 10-minute walkway yeah and and<br>some of them are literally 2 minutes<br>walking across the road and you're there<br>so very convenient<br>fantastic Okay so we've got to sense a<br>little bit more information around where<br>you'll be living and this is absolutely<br>the number one place to live being in a<br>UNIF flat as an international student<br>for study abroad and exchange is just<br>ideal and a lot of fun so how much does<br>this kind of a concept cost you well in<br>terms of planning for cost of living for<br>one semester uh we would recommend that<br>you would have um about 122,000 New<br>Zealand Dollars uh that's uh close to<br>$75,000 us per semester uh that would be<br>enough to cover your rent uh your rental<br>package for UNIF Flats personal expenses<br>and things now obviously if you're<br>intending to travel quite a lot and do<br>additional activities you want to bring<br>more but certainly you'll need a budget<br>of around 12,000 New Zealand as a sort<br>of a a base from which to<br>plan excuse<br>me all right what about life on campus<br>Services great<br>go sorry I'm just going to C but I think<br>this just gives you a sense of the kind<br>of range of old and new a bit of a<br>feeling for the vibe of the campus um it<br>really is a beautiful place to both uh<br>study and work as we do um it's<br>beautiful in all four seasons but<br>there's a lot a lot going on but in<br>terms of student life yeah so we have<br>ousa at tago University Student<br>Association So within o USA we have more<br>than 150 student Le clubs and societies<br>and that<br>includes things like cultural clubs uh<br>music clubs language clubs sports clubs<br>hobby clubs there's really everything<br>under the sun and if there's a club That<br>You Don't See on offering you're always<br>welcome to create your own club and<br>create your own Community you can do<br>that yeah so o USA is very much a<br>student-led um uh Community uh but<br>there's so much that you can do through<br>them as well we have um a dedicated ousa<br>building as well uh where there's free<br>room bookings for students that want to<br>uh be able to uh lead their uh club and<br>Society activities uh but within that<br>building as well you have access to free<br>breakfast throughout the week um and<br>also a very affordable vegetarian $4<br>lunch option too I see yeah and<br>something I didn't know until well into<br>my time at aago is there's actually a<br>sauna up in the O Uso building as well<br>so if you want to escape uh the crisp<br>winter weather and head to the sauna<br>that's uh just door like couple of steps<br>away from<br>the main building here on campus too so<br>although there's some well over 150<br>clubs and associations it's worth noting<br>a few of the particularly popular clubs<br>that our study abroad and exchange<br>students tend to gravitate towards so<br>the snow Sports Club if you're coming in<br>semester two the hiking club for sure<br>all year round the Canoe Club Climbing<br>Club scuba diving environmental there's<br>a whole heap these are just some just a<br>handful of examples uh we know to be<br>particularly popular everyone but<br>there's also a lot of opportunity to<br>feel a part of our community and uh<br>contribute to social impact make some<br>kind of an impact whilst you're here uh<br>and how be you're well placed to speak<br>to these opportunities yes so the social<br>impact studio uh it's a it's an<br>incredible team of people uh but also<br>students that are part of that uh team<br>as well there's ample opportunity<br>throughout the year to get involved in<br>your community Through volunteering<br>projects and initiatives um but also the<br>the programming and events that they<br>have throughout the year really centered<br>around social impact and leadership are<br>definitely things to look into while<br>you're here and I note the sustainable<br>fashion initiatives and I think Elber is<br>a fashionist it's fair to say that<br>you're a frequent visitor to the uh um<br>University's own Thrift Shop here on<br>campusa uh and that's quite fun because<br>basically because so many study abroad<br>and exchange students come each semester<br>at the end of the semester they<br>typically leave some things they realize<br>they don't need to take all the way back<br>home and they donate that to the thrift<br>shop which means the next students<br>coming have a chance to pick up some<br>good Bargains uh whether that's things<br>for their are flat uh uh or practical<br>gear for outings and activities or just<br>call fashion snazzy little top<br>yeah all right so a Targo as a<br>university is certainly uh very much an<br>inclusive uh community so we do have<br>students actually from 90 countries uh<br>there days and as we mentioned at the<br>start over 86% of our students they're<br>not even from denen originally so<br>there's very much a need to be inclusive<br>and welcoming uh right from the<br>beginning uh it's lovely to know that a<br>large majority of our academic staff are<br>were either born overseas or they are<br>new zealanders who have hold one of<br>their higher degrees from overseas so<br>there's certainly a global and<br>international Outlook uh across the<br>university we're an accessible campus we<br>have excellent uh disability Support<br>Services um multifaith support queer<br>support uh look this is a campus where<br>you can come and feel a part of<br>something feel a part of a city as well<br>because we are a smaller City uh we're<br>not um we're not the ginormous Paris or<br>or London where a small City but you can<br>feel connected and a part of it uh not<br>only at the University campus but more<br>broadly academically wise you're well<br>supported we have seven specialized Li<br>lies here at itago with specialized<br>Librarians to support you in your<br>particular study areas um so feel<br>confident for that level of support and<br>we have a very handy uh sort of central<br>hub ask ataro it's kind of an all-in-one<br>help desk anyone can drop by whether<br>you're stuck at trying to understand how<br>to change a course or um you're not sure<br>who to contact for something or you just<br>need directions Asko a really handy uh<br>help desk and they have hubs and a<br>number of buildings around the<br>university there to help you and help<br>you navigate as a new<br>student student health always important<br>Ela um and we're very lucky to have a<br>student health service right on campus<br>as well uh and um this has an extensive<br>range of services so uh obviously there<br>are doctors there are nurses but there's<br>also a comprehensive uh well-being and<br>mental health team with counselors and<br>so forth uh the level of services we<br>offer May differ from your home country<br>that's always something good to<br>understand and learn but the services<br>are there for you and very convenient<br>right on<br>campus campus what yeah so we've got um<br>we've got levels of support throughout<br>the university um not just academically<br>U extracurricularly as well and then we<br>have campus watch which are a great team<br>of of staff that are always around<br>really 247 you'll see them uh walking<br>around campus with their campus watch<br>HIZ and they're really um they're a<br>great team to um to feel supported by so<br>say for example if you're leaving the<br>library late at night and you just feel<br>a little bit more comfortable if you had<br>uh someone accompany you home you can<br>give campus wall uh campus watch a call<br>if you uh lose your keys or you get<br>locked out of your house you can give<br>campus wall campus wall campus watch a<br>call um so they're a great uh great<br>group of people that are always nearby<br>if you ever need<br>them unipole unole is our Recreation uh<br>facility so it's uh a joint to the fori<br>bar Stadium where we've housed uh<br>incredible matches like the All Blacks<br>not even that long ago a couple weeks<br>ago um but the uni Poole facilities are<br>great in terms of uh kind of the weights<br>and cardio rooms group fitness classes<br>there's really something for everyone um<br>you can do a lot within this building<br>but something that I really like to<br>highlight is our rental service so if<br>you do want to get out and about in The<br>Great Outdoors and you need a mountain<br>bike or you want to go tramping or or or<br>hiking and you need a tent and a<br>sleeping bag you can get a location<br>Beacon if it makes you feel um safer to<br>be out there um skis surfboards wet<br>suits we really have everything on offer<br>to get you out and exploring the Great<br>Outdoors and to do so at a very<br>comfortable uh student price as<br>well again highlighting uh the great uh<br>social impact Studio to get you involved<br>in your community but also among other<br>students as well uh like I mentioned<br>before they have great leadership<br>programming and events um and yeah it's<br>a great place to to be and get involved<br>in when you're here so it can be handy<br>to get uh connected with us by following<br>our International University of atago<br>Instagram account um most of the content<br>is generated by our current<br>International students uh or our<br>colleagues in our team as well just to<br>help showcase you know what is life like<br>here some of the things going on uh and<br>of course if you come here as an<br>international student for study abroader<br>exchange we'd love for you to feature on<br>it too that can also be a bit of fun um<br>and of course I didn't have play so now<br>we catch that up we love seeing what<br>students get up to and um like Megan<br>said yeah like Megan said most of the<br>content is student generated as well so<br>it's a very authentic view of what<br>student life atago is like so definitely<br>give us a<br>follow all right well it's now time to<br>move into questions and answers and um<br>we've had a few questions which um will<br>just present uh right off the bat and<br>that is what are what is the difference<br>between a study abroad or an exchange<br>student so put simply um an exchange<br>student is coming to a taro on a very<br>specific agreement that your home<br>Institute would have with a taro and<br>exchange means that your home Institute<br>sends students to us and we send our<br>students to your home Institute like a<br>bilateral exchange um so typically with<br>an exchange agreement there are a<br>certain number of places available and<br>as such you need to talk to your home<br>office to find out how to be nominated<br>and selected to come to a Targo through<br>an exchange uh with an exchange you do<br>not pay a tuition fee to a Targo uh you<br>continue with your home tuition rate but<br>you don't pay a taro a particular<br>tuition fee so it's typically limited<br>places and quite competitive um in many<br>cases um but please talk to your home<br>Institute because we love hosting our<br>exchange students from amazing Partners<br>around the world and we love sending our<br>ataro students back to your University<br>too now a study abroad uh agreement is a<br>little bit different uh but still gives<br>you the same outcome that is that you<br>can come and study for one or two<br>semesters at a Targo and what's cool um<br>about a study of broad agreement is that<br>you have access to the same sorts of<br>services as well with the accommodation<br>guarantee<br>um and the same kind of study options<br>something we didn't actually talk about<br>is how many courses you can take at a<br>taro oh I realized oh there may be a<br>question but maybe there's a question on<br>that we're going to come to that um so<br>effectively the main difference with<br>study abroad is that um your home<br>Institute send students to us but we<br>don't send back to you uh and there is a<br>tuition fee to be paid at a Targo for<br>that um also it's possible to come to<br>aaro as a study abroad student um<br>through a study abroad provider or an<br>education consultant as well so if your<br>home University or Institute doesn't<br>have a study abroad agreement um there<br>are other providers uh that can help you<br>come here with that as well and you can<br>also come independently as well that is<br>true that is true so how many courses or<br>papers can I take during a semester so<br>in the main Exchange and study abroad<br>students can take three to four courses<br>with us in a semester three courses is a<br>full-time load for a<br>and suitable for a full-time uh study<br>and student visa accordingly um uh but<br>depending on what your home Institute<br>requirements may be or to fulfill your<br>degree program you might need to take<br>four most study abroad students probably<br>I would say take three um and that just<br>gives them that a little bit less uh<br>academic uh workload so they can also<br>explore and have some fun but you can<br>also achieve that on four courses uh if<br>you're efficient and work hard so yes<br>three or four courses a semester so that<br>might be made up for instance with one<br>or two courses connected to the major at<br>your home University degree or they<br>might be all electives maybe you want to<br>make sure you take one course or paper<br>that is focused on something about New<br>Zealand our culture our history<br>something uh a little bit more specific<br>or pick up a fieldwork kind of a course<br>or take something in a whole different<br>subject you've never had the chance to<br>do but would love to explore so three or<br>four courses a semester and of course we<br>use this funny word ala we call things<br>papers and a paper is really just<br>meaning a standalone course or a module<br>so um you'll hear that a bit when you<br>interact with the<br>tago right oh another uh common question<br>that's come up for us is I'm studying a<br>Bachelor of Arts at my home Institute do<br>I apply for The Bachelor of Arts at at<br>Taro no so uh if you are nominated by<br>your home Institute for in exchange you<br>will be provided with a specific link to<br>apply for the a CER it's called a<br>certificate of proficiency incoming<br>exchange um and that refers to the<br>particular way in which you will be<br>coming in studying a semester of courses<br>and then transferring those credits back<br>to your home Institute if you're going<br>to be coming to us as a study abroad<br>student you'll be applying for what we<br>call a certificate of proficiency study<br>abroad and same thing it refers to sort<br>of a on or two semester period coming in<br>and taking um some courses which you<br>intend to transfer back to your home<br>Institute very important to apply to the<br>correct course so that we can process<br>the application accordingly as well if<br>you were to apply for The Bachelor of<br>Arts with us our understanding is you're<br>meaning to apply for a full degree<br>program with us so uh that's a different<br>concept<br>entirely all right have we got any other<br>live questions that have come through<br>yes we do so someone has asked I'm<br>studying online at a university can I do<br>an exchange semester at your University<br>so that entirely depends on whether your<br>online or the university through which<br>you're studying online uh has an<br>exchange agreement with atago so you<br>have to go and check with your home<br>institute's International office or<br>Global Affairs office to find out<br>whether we're an exchange partner or not<br>um if we are great then find out the<br>next steps to be nominated if we're not<br>then you can't come to us on an exchange<br>but you might be able to consider coming<br>to us as a study abroad student uh<br>independently or through a provider um<br>depending on where you are<br>based okay great well um that's probably<br>a summary I think of study abroad and<br>exchange at a taro as you can see I mean<br>this is what you're coming for most<br>likely here on the screen that's<br>actually me out uh walking out on that<br>stunning photo out on the peak looking<br>over that wonderful view this kind of<br>scenery these kinds of activities are so<br>accessible there's really no other<br>university in New Zealand that gives you<br>the breadth and easy access to the same<br>level that we can whether you're surfing<br>into Nan uh 10 minutes uh down from the<br>campus at the beach uh or uh later in<br>the day you're up a ski mountain or<br>later on the day you're uh in a kayak uh<br>or hiking somewhere so there's so many<br>things you could do uh and we really<br>welcome you to Taro so if you've got any<br>additional questions following this that<br>weren't answered in the chat you of<br>course are always welcome to reach out<br>to us uh but again please do get in<br>touch with your home institutes<br>International office to find out your<br>options to come to New Zealand and Oto<br>uh and we would very much warmly welcome<br>you to join us until then we'll catch<br>you later and take</p></main><footer style="margin-top: 2rem; background: #0001; padding: 2rem; text-align: center;"><p>We Are The
