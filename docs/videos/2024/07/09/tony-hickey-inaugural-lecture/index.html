the<br>dean of Science and it's my great<br>pleasure to welcome you to W Papa tomato<br>University of Oakland in the inaugural<br>lecture of Professor Tony<br>hicky before I introduce Tony I'd just<br>like to pause and recognize the passing<br>of Wednesday Davis one of the SPs<br>technical staff team who died tragically<br>on Mount Ru last weekend our thoughts<br>are with her far now friends and<br>time when you cry your tears are sheded<br>by<br>all we're also here to celebrate<br>Wednesday's life of course but also to<br>celebrate the career of uh Tony hickey<br>to<br>date Tony has broad research interests<br>in ecology physiology biochemistry and<br>biom Medicine it work is based around<br>the physiology of mitochondria the<br>energy Powerhouse houses of cells and<br>particularly what happens to to them<br>when they are stressed which often leads<br>to cell<br>death because such processes are so<br>fundamental to life Tony's work has<br>covered a wide variety of organisms<br>including fish and Marine inverters<br>frogs birds and insects and particularly<br>looking at how such organisms adapt to<br>extreme<br>adversity as well as a broad range of<br>biomedical areas including pancreatitis<br>shock and factors of fair affecting<br>heart<br>metabolism he says the value of this<br>work is that we learn how animals<br>survive and succeed where we cannot and<br>and succeed where we cannot and it<br>informs us of life's limits and what<br>species will win or<br>lose Tony did his PhD here in Oakland<br>after which he became a research<br>scientist initially with pmic and then<br>joined the school as an academic in<br>2010 he's not only an accomplished<br>researcher winning a university early<br>career Excellence award is also an<br>excellent educator teaching into the<br>flagship biasi 101 course with<br>Innovative pedagogical approaches that<br>are well received by<br>students he's a major contributor to the<br>culture of SBS being awarded a school<br>2021 there's obviously a story there<br>more than<br>one tonight Tony is going to tell us<br>about his journey to become a scientist<br>he says that if we're lucky we will also<br>learn something about<br>yours all right Kiora I'm uh I'm Tony as<br>you've just been told and uh I sort of<br>struggled with how to attempt to do this<br>convey what I've done and things so um I<br>popped up the road and I I I caught up<br>with my mate Bob<br>and Bob said what you got to do is<br>you've got to have a talk outline and<br>you got to stick to that and so I said<br>yeah Bob I'll come up with that and so<br>the first bit will be chaos the next but<br>will be chaos and the last bit will be<br>science chaos okay um I'm going to put<br>forward something quite new so it might<br>be kind of a different talk to the<br>normal inaugural lecture it all really<br>starts with my mom and dad okay but<br>let's go back to where they came from so<br>uh mom is actually a Scott Bor in<br>Edinburgh and she was born to ety up<br>here and John over here on the right um<br>both of them were actually uh all the<br>stories I remember of them were during<br>the war so ety was a matron in a<br>children's hospital and delivered babies<br>while bombs plummeted down during the<br>blitz um and John was uh a doctor who<br>was a physician in an Army hospital in<br>the Sudan in Egypt where his his unit<br>was actually bombed three times by by<br>roml um and we're related to uh roboy<br>McGregor so related to a thief all right<br>dead um well he<br>actually is obviously Irish with the<br>name hickey but he was actually born in<br>Wellington but his parents came from<br>Australia so we've got constants and<br>we've got Fergus and they are<br>descendants of more criminals that were<br>probably exported to to Australia and<br>originally from County clear obviously<br>from the from the picture there so<br>anyway whoops let's go back so it was<br>probably 1969 on wangy day I was<br>actually born in November so I was<br>mapping back<br>so I was wondering Mom is that<br>correct not want to put you on the spot<br>but anyway it was a twinkle in my dad's<br>eye and I was born in at tarer South<br>hospital so this is pretty much where I<br>come from this is down at Mount mongi<br>and and things and and here's my family<br>I very lucky I've got a lovely family<br>I've got three sisters an older one Sue<br>who's not here she's sunning herself in<br>barley and um and then my twin sisters<br>uh we've got over here we've got Sy and<br>we've got Joe hopefully I got that right<br>it was pretty hard to tell them apart<br>even for me as a kid okay they used to<br>have different freckles and things all<br>right so here's me adorable as ever and<br>then it all goes downhill I get uglier<br>and uglier but you can see that I'm on a<br>bike okay now Mom and Dad this is Sarah<br>they actually thought I had some sort of<br>mental health problem um they thought I<br>was a bit a bit dared and so they took<br>me to the psychologist and and they this<br>guy gave me like this puzzle and he said<br>right pop outside and you work on this<br>puzzle I'm going to talk to your parents<br>and go through things and so I walked<br>outside and it wasn't actually this it<br>was actually parts of the Large Hadron<br>Collider and then a few minutes later I<br>had assembled it and brought it in and<br>the guy said whoa whoa that's so fast I<br>can't understand how your son did this<br>only 2% of the population can put that<br>puzzle together your son must be a<br>genius so I remember the car drive back<br>and I was sitting in the car and they<br>were raving oh he's a genius he said<br>he's a genius anyway Saturday morning<br>they they they opened up the herald and<br>there was a story about how their<br>psychologist is actually out mowing his<br>Law's news<br>so true<br>story anyway dad was a really good<br>cricketer he really loved cricket and he<br>also he grew up in toy and he was he was<br>kind of isolated there uh and so he<br>really all his mates got sent off the<br>wongi Collegiate and he always wanted to<br>go to wongi collegate but he he went off<br>to umil Hamilton boys and so he thought<br>what would be good for ant and this<br>would probably sort him out cuz he's<br>he's not doing so well at school as we<br>send her to boarding school so they sent<br>me to boarding school and I didn't<br>really appreciate boarding school I<br>found it quite hard but one of the<br>things I excelled in a few subjects and<br>I say a few but one of them was biology<br>and this is a comment from one of my<br>teachers and I thought it was quite cool<br>actually thought it was quite apt it<br>sort of fitted me um<br>but I did learn I did learn not to have<br>outbursts from here on as you know I'm<br>I'm I'm sort of the strong silent type<br>um but while I was at school I actually<br>was actually before I went to to kangs I<br>actually um I kind of fell in love with<br>the sport of cycling and I started up a<br>cycling team and I wasn't allowed to<br>actually uh race my bike um originally I<br>had to actually play hockey or rugby and<br>then go and race so I had to actually do<br>another sport beforehand so I'd play<br>hockey and then I'd go and ride bike<br>races and things um and I was actually<br>really useless at riding a bike um and<br>then when I got to about 16 something<br>happened to me physiologically and I got<br>good at riding the<br>bike um and when I was going 17 there<br>was this guy Jack broom who's this<br>amazing amazing cycle coach and he got<br>hold of four of us guys and we were like<br>the bad news beers and we he trained and<br>trained and trained us and somehow we<br>won the national uh team's Pursuit and<br>this sort of set me off on a path of of<br>really getting into<br>cycling I why do I love the bike well to<br>me it's kind of it's got some romance to<br>it it's it's a sport where there is a<br>possibility of of serious injury there's<br>suffering and there's speed and there's<br>danger um this is one of my great Heroes<br>Bernard Eno he won the Tour to France<br>five times he his nickname was the<br>badger because he was so aggressive<br>racing and one thing I thought was quite<br>impressive cuz I always remember this he<br>fell off his bike in his Sprint finish<br>and then he got up and he finished and<br>then he won the Tour of France with a<br>broken nose and and ribs really<br>impressive but one of the best stories<br>that come out of the Tour of France is<br>this one here with Lauren fenon who<br>wears glasses and had blonde hair he<br>inspired<br>me but the idiot refused to wear an<br>arrow helmet and he lost the tour to<br>France by 8 seconds to Greg Lemont and<br>that's an amazing story as well Greg<br>Lamont been shot the previous year and<br>he had shotgun pellets he lost his<br>kidney he lost most of his blood and he<br>still to this day has pellets and his<br>and his uh perum so quite an incredible<br>character anyway so I got into cycling I<br>was nowhere as good as these guys but I<br>I loved it and I got to travel all over<br>the place I made teenss and all sorts of<br>things and did all sorts of crazy stuff<br>the milk race team time trials races in<br>New calonia Australia I went on and on<br>but one of the cool things is I actually<br>made it into our Olympic team um I<br>didn't actually get to ride the Olympics<br>in Barcelona in 1992 and this sort of<br>broke my heart a we bit um but you know<br>life sucks and then you die<br>um I got to travel all over the place um<br>as I did um you know all we went to the<br>Caribbean we went to uh throughout Asia<br>we went all throughout Europe um<br>Australia uh Tasmania sort of Australia<br>um and the place I really loved actually<br>was France I lived in this place called<br>Tu and our team raced all over France it<br>was really really good I it's about 19<br>or something and their lifestyle the<br>countryside the just the the people I<br>just really really love France the<br>problem was when I made the Olympic<br>Squad I couldn't actually uh stay in<br>France um because I had to break sort of<br>contracts and stuff to go and race uh<br>for New Zealand so it wasn't going to<br>work so I went to Belgium and Belgium<br>was an unusual place I I liked it it was<br>really exciting but it tended to look<br>like this a lot when I was there and<br>that was was wet and there were<br>cobblestones everywhere okay so you<br>tended to fall off a lot um but the cool<br>thing is you could race every single day<br>and when you raced and you got say about<br>in the top 10 you got money and so I<br>could actually survive by racing um and<br>I tended to I was very very skinny if I<br>didn't uh get anywhere um and so you had<br>to really focus on getting somewhere was<br>very very hard but we had this crazy guy<br>who looked after us up here in the white<br>shirt um with his hand on my shoulder<br>you can see that I don't really uh think<br>to much of him he was uh this guy was<br>staff Boon and he was like the Tony<br>Soprano of cycling um he was he was<br>really dodgy but he uh he got us to to<br>race all over the place and with the<br>Scotsman on our group here I could never<br>understand a single word he<br>said um so he took us all over the place<br>again we raced here there everywhere and<br>things and uh you know had a really<br>really good time and there was one thing<br>I became academic for a little while for<br>a joke we dyed our hair black and my IQ<br>doubled so this is one of the best races<br>I rode this is the tour of Tasmania um I<br>actually won the stage it was like the<br>queen stage the hardest stage of the<br>tour I rode away um up this this big<br>climb I could I was unusual I was quite<br>tall but I could get up get up hills um<br>and in the background are Australians so<br>I've ridden away from Australians okay<br>um I had a really good mate actually<br>when I was racing and here he is my arm<br>around him this is Mark rindle uh we<br>were we were cobers so we were the three<br>years we flooded in Belgium together<br>really got on really really well and uh<br>you know we'd race for each other I<br>would lead him out he would lead me out<br>would chase people down if he was in the<br>yellow Jersey or something like that so<br>um we became very very close friends<br>actually so you built up a lot of um you<br>know comaraderie and he actually gave me<br>this I better pull it out or is it<br>my so his nickname so he he's mry his<br>nickname he had a a pendant and his<br>nickn name became tanif and because my<br>last name's hickey they changed it and<br>my my name's Hony and so that was our<br>those were our call signs when we were<br>racing so he got me a little pendant and<br>had it blessed by his auntie so there we<br>are anyway about this time I met the<br>love of my<br>and uh my life started to change quite a<br>bit I started thinking more about you<br>know what was going on and the following<br>year I had a really bad crash um this<br>isn't it this is just one of many but I<br>had one where I just located a shoulder<br>and it didn't heal very well and then I<br>had to go and ride some races in Europe<br>and and things and I had a sore throat<br>and I just went downhill and I was<br>losing weight and getting skinny so I<br>was riding this race in Germany it was<br>pouring with rain and it was going way<br>too fast unphysiologically fast I<br>believe and I just climbed off my bike<br>and got in the wagon and came home and<br>uh that's my last race number for New<br>Zealand so it's kind of weird cuz I<br>didn't really have that many regrets I<br>was kind of happy I was going to change<br>my life and do something different but<br>I'd given up on cycling but cycling New<br>Zealand hadn't given up on me there was<br>a bit of a problem um our manager uh<br>this guy called John delore he um he was<br>a bit upset because we I'd pulled out<br>and the team wasn't doing that well and<br>so he sort of thought well uh uh there's<br>a few problems with racing licenses and<br>on our racing licenses we had to list<br>our occupation and because kiwi Riders<br>usually work part-time jobs or they have<br>a real job and French writers or Germans<br>or Russians or um or Americans they<br>usually got some bogus occupation<br>they're in the army or something like<br>that but they don't usually work um so<br>we would put our own occupations on and<br>Tim put fighter pilot on his license and<br>license now my dad my dad was not happy<br>okay so what actually happened was that<br>um yeah he was Furious actually um<br>because I'd brought the family name it<br>wasn't the herald I brought the family<br>name into disrepute yet I actually was a<br>bit upset with him he did not value the<br>service<br>industry and I thought I would have made<br>a great jigo right anyway I had a few<br>other directions I flattered with this<br>guy who was a cop and he sort of<br>convinced me uh why you become a<br>policeman I said oh yeah that's a job um<br>anyway I broke my arm before I went down<br>to Piru I did all the tests and I was<br>ready to go down um and I broke my arm<br>so I was running out of options so I was<br>going down the ranks I had to think of<br>something something good but it was<br>getting worse and worse so I thought how<br>about being a biologist<br>so I signed up to University of Oakland<br>and uh and and and that was it I found<br>it incredibly hard actually I I'd<br>forgotten how to learn uh I couldn't<br>write very well I'm a bit dyslexic um<br>and I'm blonde so so I really struggled<br>and then after a year mark actually won<br>the the road race at the Commonwealth<br>Games and so I was kind of a bit peeved<br>I was actually working with someone up<br>here Mike m merury when he he did it we<br>were painting someone's house I was a<br>little bit P I was super happy for Mark<br>but I sort of thought oh you know I<br>could have been there but you know<br>things progress and I did progress I<br>made my way through University um I did<br>my bachelors and then on with my masters<br>and you know I made really really good<br>friends and I was inspired by a couple<br>of people one was this guy here<br>associate professor Dennis wazelle he<br>was an interesting character he'd get up<br>on stage and he would tell stories and<br>Yarns and things and really get you<br>fascinated and he taught human<br>physiology and I toed that class um um<br>that was in my second year and then I<br>came across this guy Professor Rufus<br>Wells he's an unusual character but he<br>told really crazy tales about crocodiles<br>and and fish that could breathe through<br>their skin and turtles that could<br>breathe through their ass it was really<br>quite cool and um and then he kind of<br>inspired me to go on so I did my Masters<br>on um Abalone which were power here in<br>New Zealand and I looked at the muscle<br>structure if they were growing in rough<br>water was still water or high or low<br>temperatures and things and I looked at<br>the metabolism you know so that was all<br>kind of interesting but at the end of<br>this I was sitting in the t- room at SBS<br>School ofical sciences and I opened up<br>nature and in the back of nature there<br>was an advertisement to go down to<br>Antarctica and so I wrote uh a a project<br>up you had to write a project up and get<br>a l of reference so I get L of reference<br>from rofus and it must have been a<br>cracker cuz I got to go down okay and I<br>was the only Master student there<br>everyone else was either PhD or post<br>stop or even lecturer level so I was<br>like the complete newbie and um I had a<br>fantastic time down there hopefully this<br>works we saw all sorts of animals um we<br>got up really close to them what was<br>really cool was we got in helicopters go<br>to the ice Edge and our group would go<br>everywhere and we saw animals and the<br>other groups went out and they saw<br>nothing they just saw ice and so it was<br>really quite cool I actually played a<br>game of rugby and we won but I was<br>playing for the<br>Yanks I didn't say boo for the whole<br>game until the end and I went and shock<br>hands and say oh good on you and then<br>they realized I was a<br>kiwi anyway when I was there I met this<br>guy Colin Broner he's a Canadian and he<br>has subsequently he was a post stop then<br>he's subsequently gone on uh to take up<br>u a position at University of British<br>Columbia he has a position there that he<br>replaced a guy called peterka who was<br>like uh it was like basically he wrote<br>the Bible of comparative physiology at<br>the time so very very good um researcher<br>or<br>scientist anyway I was actually going to<br>do my PhD somewhere else I was offered<br>how could do one in the states but it<br>was too hard getting green cards and<br>stuff with with my lovely Marie and so I<br>took up this PhD position with Kendall<br>and it was on the F geography which has<br>to do with the genetic sort of<br>distribution and and geographic<br>distribution all mixed together of these<br>peculiar fish tripin fish so New Zealand<br>is really unique and that we have about<br>27 to 28 different species of these<br>these cool little fish in our in our<br>Waters and they've evolved most of them<br>have evolved here in New Zealand so<br>they're a really cool model to study<br>um Kendall I was actually we got in a<br>car to go up to the Three Kings Islands<br>and I was with Mike we just handed in<br>our thesis and Mike um uh and I went up<br>there and I jumped on the boat and<br>Kendall gave me a book and he said right<br>learn all the trou fins before we get to<br>three kings and I learned that TR funs<br>have three funs on their back by the<br>time we got there yeah it was pretty<br>good anyway we had some adventures and<br>things um and it was a pretty good you<br>know pretty good time actually uh going<br>up to three kings and my PhD had a<br>really good time doing this sort of<br>stuff but we also did another trip<br>Kendall and I we went to South Africa<br>and we went to a place called sodwana<br>Bay and then we went to Lake Malawi and<br>we went to Lake Mala uh to study these<br>fish called cichlids which are a bit<br>like triin that they they've diverged in<br>these Lakes but it's a real Adventure<br>you know we the the locals were<br>fantastic to work with um we actually<br>helped them collect fish they were like<br>with a conservation group that would<br>collect fish rear them and then release<br>them and also sell some to aquarium uh<br>things but kle um here you know it was<br>really quite cool um you know developed<br>you know pretty good relationship I<br>really realized what a cracker scientist<br>I also work with Scott Baker he was my<br>my co-supervisor and Scott was great he<br>was great fun but he he tended to have<br>me doing most of the lab work for<br>everyone else cuz I wasn't a whale<br>person I was kind of Handy you get me to<br>do all the F you know the whale stuff<br>while I was doing my fish stuff and I<br>also worked with Shane ly here and Shane<br>probably he taught me so much about<br>statistics and so forth I was a bit of<br>an numpty here with molecular biology<br>and I wouldn't have survived without<br>then life events all right so after a<br>whirlwind of seven years I proposed to<br>Marie on the top of Mount tarangi um and<br>the ranger came up and said you got to<br>go cuz we're closing the park um anyway<br>it's a bit of a rock and roll sort of<br>situation and then we went on our<br>honeymoon we went all over the place we<br>went to Las Vegas Grand<br>Canyon um<br>yeah Disneyland as you're doing on your<br>honeymoon and then here we are here all<br>right so um buom chicka wow<br>wow now I came back to New Zealand and<br>one of the things I was now on a roll<br>with my PhD and I was sitting there and<br>um dck Bellamy rocked on into the<br>computer room where I seem to spend my<br>entire life analyzing sequences and he<br>came in and he said right you'll do um<br>when you someone to uh write a bio<br>bulletin it's like a newspaper thing we<br>used to have one uh it's supposed to be<br>you know like a bit of a performative<br>maybe a few jokes uh and uh you can do<br>it and I said well do I have a choice<br>and he said no you don't um so anyway I<br>I thought oh what he got to do is he got<br>to do a really bad job and they'll never<br>ask you to do it again okay so I thought<br>ah yeah I can do this got it sus so I<br>came up with my first addition all right<br>and there's a bit of a story in here so<br>the first one is about myself<br>right the second one here is it's a true<br>story deck went to Memphis and there was<br>a bit of soap and there was some curly<br>hairs on the soap and he took that and<br>you know how this DNA sometimes in the<br>follicules of the hair he took that<br>extract the DNA and he expressed it in<br>cells and he lo and behold he got<br>Elvis it's true but he had a few issues<br>and he was missing a few jeans his hips<br>didn't work properly but he thought that<br>was a bad thing I thought this was a new<br>Locus he could make some money out of<br>that yep<br>anyway dick thought this was really<br>good and he was asking me he said when's<br>the next Edition and I was like oh yeah<br>it's coming um and then he caught me one<br>day and I actually had something rolled<br>up in my hand which was a draft um and I<br>sort of said well um yeah it's was<br>working on it and he said I like to<br>introduce you to the dean of science um<br>from uh from Cambridge or Oxford or<br>something he how do you do Tony it's<br>very nice to meet you and um and he said<br>if you got the new draft I said oh you<br>got it in my hand and he grabbed it off<br>me and he unrolled it and I came back<br>with<br>this now there's actually another word<br>under<br>rooster and I thought if I showed it I'd<br>anyway I came up with a new Jean for<br>this one here yeah yeah big Dingle six<br>all right now that did the trick I never<br>got asked to do anything<br>again I tell you what it was a lot worse<br>when you opened it up and read inside it<br>no one complained the last time I did it<br>though I thought they were thinking they<br>were encouraging me anyway back to New<br>Zealand triple Fin fish tripin fish are<br>really really amazing um my project uh I<br>insisted that I could do some physiology<br>so I looked at physiological adaptations<br>of these first genome size Evolution see<br>that evolved by a thing called<br>polyploidy where they've got genome<br>multiplication and things like that<br>lavel dispersal which was completely<br>boring um and then discovery of some<br>other stuff which I'll get to now so one<br>of the big things that came out of my my<br>PhD was this this paper here um and it<br>was looking at population diversity and<br>the structure around the country so<br>Kendall and I done the these road trips<br>and Marie and I went to the North Island<br>Marie and I and Kimble and I did the<br>South Island and we collected samples<br>from all over the place and we then we<br>looked at mitochondrial genes and we<br>looked at how um the the animals you<br>know the the different genotypes fell<br>out Hypes and we got a few interesting<br>things so one of the main things is we<br>found that as you got deeper in the<br>water the the genetic diversity<br>increased in the fish and as you got<br>shallower it got less but also the<br>population structuring increased as you<br>got shallower and this we could relate<br>back to glaciation and particularly The<br>South isand was basically all single<br>Hypes for sun species which sort of<br>reflected that they' probably been wiped<br>out and then they' recolonized from a<br>single sort of fish population so that<br>was kind of cool ywn ywn yawn um now if<br>we look at one species here um Grand Min<br>Capo I thought this was particularly<br>cool and I actually won the PHD prize<br>for this because I I got some<br>sponsorship from the brewery um but<br>grind Capo has now become forer in Capo<br>it had a couple of interesting what we<br>call claves or little groups and one of<br>these groups was um from akaroa and the<br>other group was from the chattam islands<br>and they fell out they were very<br>distinct I was like new species and<br>Kendall was like n I'm a lump not a<br>splitter and I said but Mau dolphin has<br>decided on one base pair and he wouldn't<br>wouldn't let me still do it anyway i'<br>lined up sponsorship and everything cuz<br>my brother-in-law worked for Li Nathan<br>and I was going to go with gr minor<br>spaty eye for one of<br>them and Spacey eye old eye for<br>the other I figured there could be some<br>money in this for me but that wasn't the<br>end of it so one thing is that there was<br>this group where the Hypes fell out with<br>a totally different species right and<br>what this me is there been hybridization<br>and so there were two species of triple<br>fin that had had some hanky panky all<br>right and so this is varium and this is<br>Capo and if we think about where they<br>were found they were all found in fand<br>in fand you've got this dark layer of<br>water where it's harder to see and it's<br>also colder cuz it's ice melt and so you<br>get deep water species coming up and so<br>these two species had kind of intermixed<br>and we had hybrids now to me<br>this was fascinating because it was<br>probably the first example of bear<br>goggles and fish all right and I came up<br>with a jean with the with that as well<br>too okay so anyway this was the end of<br>my PhD and I moved on and um I was<br>contracted to do some work on trying to<br>keep fish alive this crazy thing with<br>these Chambers where pumped them up with<br>with the air or different gases and they<br>seem to survive quite a long time I had<br>a few explosions one put a massive dent<br>in mumab I didn't actually realize it<br>almost killed me actually big Shard of<br>place in the garage wall about heart<br>height um but that dent in the car<br>actually got blamed on my brother-in-law<br>who's sitting here now actually um but I<br>took this idea to to Anthony Phillips<br>and I said hey this could be a useful<br>thing for for transplant uh a way of<br>transporting organs we could keep fish<br>alive this matter of time maybe we can<br>push gas into these organs and and keep<br>them going anyway it was a total f the<br>grant we write together but um a said<br>you know what we need someone like you<br>working at<br>proix I don't know think I was going to<br>blow something up anyway he put me onto<br>onto G um and G we used to call behind<br>his back GeForce and he was probably the<br>best boss you could ever have okay and I<br>had this job interview with him came in<br>and I sort of at the end of I said why<br>on Earth do you want me um you know I've<br>worked on fish and stuff like that and<br>he said well it doesn't really matter<br>they all sort of work the same but one<br>of the things it's not what you know<br>it's how you think okay now G is a<br>remarkable man he's actually my K I<br>would go to him for advice on stuff um<br>personal stuff all sorts of things he's<br>a fantastic man and a bit of a brain as<br>well but I did wonder why he picked me<br>cuz the next day I think we're at a<br>Christmas party and this was how I was<br>dressed as a as a<br>bandit okay so Life Changes this time<br>here sprogs okay so we had kids um and I<br>can remember working for gy got me doing<br>stuff on mitochondria which was just the<br>best opportunity for me and I was just<br>absolutely uh had the Tremors and I<br>thought I've poisoned myself because<br>with mitochondria worked with all sorts<br>of things like Cyanide and rotenone and<br>oloy and things I thought I've poisoned<br>myself and I went to the doctor and I<br>was shaking and and the doctor said oh<br>you had any life changes I said oh we<br>just had a baby boy he said go home and<br>get some sleep<br>the trimers went remarkably they went<br>they came back though anyway some<br>fantastic times and we've taken our boys<br>all over the world uh with friends and<br>things and uh we taking them to Austria<br>uh for work I do with a group over there<br>um and now they've grown up into fine<br>young men and one of the things though<br>is when you travel with them you often<br>get in predicaments that I find are um<br>you know it can be a little bit dodgy um<br>you know say you're swimming somewhere<br>and you could get in trouble there's<br>always a good way out I've found and<br>that is put on a foreign accent<br>accent and um anyway speaking of German<br>accents<br>y yor decided to take me on as a<br>lecturer um and uh so and you know<br>there's this position there and it was a<br>bit of a sitter actually kry was in my<br>examinate and my my uh interview panel<br>and sitting there and you're asked this<br>question where do you see yourself in 5<br>years time Tony I said your seat<br>mate I don't want it I tell you it's a<br>hard job now I talk about teaching um<br>someone very special here Mandy sitting<br>down here um she's been incredible so I<br>was put on to teach 101 and 101 is a<br>massive paper thousands of emails uh per<br>week and it's just mind-bogglingly<br>difficult to do so I'm co-director and I<br>would say basically<br>I don't do much Co it's mostly Mandy the<br>teaching is actually quite intense I do<br>love it um it's it's a fantastic sort of<br>environment to do that now my other love<br>is um this paper biosi 335 which is<br>comparative physiology and here we do<br>all sorts of stuff we look at The<br>Locomotion of how fish mov and I even<br>invented a robotic fish that um<br>generates Force as it swims and you can<br>swap out the Tails and see what happens<br>when you change the Tails and you change<br>the speed and forces and stuff and and<br>all sorts of other things um but<br>tragically the person helping me out<br>with a lot of this was our our dear<br>Wednesday and so we've lost her but one<br>of the things that I will always<br>remember she she sent me the fish uh<br>thing I had to find it the other day it<br>was quite hard but one of the things was<br>we were rearing an enemies for for a lab<br>and she kept sending me updates on how<br>many babies they had and she said that I<br>had had 172 babies I should be proud<br>father they had my<br>eyes but looking at them they must be<br>bloodshot okay so to you Wednesday with<br>love so return to tiers of<br>mystery at this point in time using some<br>equipment that g had paid for and didn't<br>know about this I did some work with Zoe<br>Hilton I ended up co-supervising her<br>with Kendall and we we looked at some<br>physiological effects of triple friends<br>uh and and we found out that their their<br>cardiac Andria were very robust a<br>temperature if they lived in a rock pole<br>versus if they were a deep water species<br>and this was actually kind of um kind of<br>cool and what was really cool about it<br>is I used it to get a maen fast D and<br>that led me a lot further along one of<br>the things it did is it actually it got<br>me to think out some new gear so these<br>machines had these windows which are<br>like eyes and I figured that I could<br>actually do something with this where I<br>made some sensors that you could plug in<br>to the front and I made them out of bits<br>of duct tape hose Clips LEDs photo<br>diodes which are like little solar<br>panels and um and just batteries and<br>stuff and I managed to make these super<br>sensitive sensors that could measure uh<br>fluorescent things uh such as free<br>radicals uh fluores that work with ATP<br>pH all sorts of crazy things okay now<br>another company got hold of this and<br>it's been a very productive thing for me<br>because he's paid for me to go over and<br>work in workshops with him take our<br>family all sorts of things this is Eric<br>Niger who he lives in insbook in Austria<br>and we got to go skiing and stuff in the<br>P was really good um so I thought I<br>could Market my stuff pretty much the<br>same<br>and my marketing team needs to be<br>fired anyway I used this to look at<br>shark uh metabolism and one of the<br>things here is uh this shark here is<br>peculiar it's it's a up in the the trop<br>the Philippines it's called a bamb blue<br>shark in Australia it's called the epil<br>shark and it's called the epil shark cuz<br>you can see the spots on it but the cool<br>thing about this shark is that a it can<br>kind of walk on its fins like a lizard<br>and it will do this when the water's out<br>to get back into the water but it stays<br>on the reef When the tide goes out and<br>often it can get stranded and it's<br>without oxygen for a bit so it can go<br>for 4 hours at 30° in an noxia and an<br>noxia is no oxygen it gets no brain<br>damage and it has no problems with its<br>cardiac function it just shuts down and<br>turns back on so this is amazing to<br>study for things like um know<br>reperfusion injury and surgery and<br>things like this and Es schia with with<br>his lack of blood supply and so I got<br>encouraged to go over and work with<br>Colin Broner from down in Antarctica so<br>he asked me to come over and so I came<br>over and I met this other guy who made a<br>comment about you know what is it take<br>to be a good scientist and I said a<br>crazy shirt and I'm just looking at his<br>shirt there I yeah it's pretty crazy um<br>but I also met this lovely woman Jillian<br>Rena who's sitting down here at the<br>front and we've done all sorts of stuff<br>since then um lovely woman and I'm just<br>going to destroy that by saying there<br>someone even better and that's David<br>adenor she worked with David<br>adur and uh there's it's on YouTube<br>where she's talking about the Sharks and<br>stuff so she tells these amazing stories<br>about um this fantastic uh this<br>fantastic man who I think has done the<br>most probably for communicating climate<br>change and things out of anyone he's<br>just such a good man<br>anyway I use these senses to do other<br>stuff I looked at diabetic stuff and<br>this is uh looking at what happens to<br>the efficiency of diabetic hearts and<br>surprise surprise it does the efficiency<br>drops off it gets really bad and it's<br>quite miserable if you're a diabetic<br>heart or diabetic rat we also did other<br>things that weren't related to um<br>directly to mitochondria to start with<br>but we worked out how bumblebees<br>actually warm up we almost got this into<br>nature they sat on it for a month before<br>saying on no you could try a sister<br>Journal um and we worked out how they<br>make um Heat and we made our own system<br>to do it we made aerometer out of bits<br>of TVs um old Chiller boxes uh stuff we<br>stole from other people's Labs I've got<br>a habit of doing that um and uh it<br>worked we couldn't believe it worked um<br>anyway we worked that out about this<br>time too this french guy called Jules<br>emailed me he actually emailed Neil<br>Herbert and he f it on to me and and<br>Jules wanted to do his Masters and he<br>was funded by rotary so he came out to<br>New Zealand did his masters with me and<br>then he went back and the data he got<br>from his his study again on the<br>wonderful triple friends uh was enough<br>to get me another Masen Grant and so<br>really really cool stuff now jeles is<br>really quite um quite handy actually oh<br>the other thing too is this work<br>actually got us this grant it was with<br>Nigel as well who sadly uh we've lost<br>Nigel a while back but Jo is very<br>handy he made this system here and this<br>was actually to work on another masine I<br>got later on and this is uh to measure<br>we could measure heart function in a a<br>perused heart and this is a fish heart<br>beating away and we could shine lights<br>through this heart of different sort of<br>intensities or wavelengths or colors and<br>then we had senses we could pick up the<br>light coming through it being<br>transmitted through it and we could work<br>out what was going on with the<br>mitochondria inside the heart as we<br>heated it up until it failed um and some<br>really really cool data and the cool<br>thing is you might have noticed there<br>was lots of Lego in there so we use Lego<br>for a very serious reason and it's it's<br>actually metric and it's very well made<br>and machined or or molded and you can<br>pull it all<br>apart put it into a little box get to<br>here and island or wherever you're going<br>put it all back together and you've got<br>a system and it's a lot cheaper than a<br>lot of the other systems You' get say in<br>bioengineering science time now Bob told<br>me you've got to present some proper<br>science Tony otherwise people might<br>doubt that you're any good<br>so I'm going to do some science and this<br>is a little bit different to what you<br>would normally expect um so this is me<br>mate Bob here um I'm going to talk about<br>hot mitochondria and a vital<br>force so as animals get too hot what<br>happens is that they tend to Die Why do<br>they die it's usually heart failure<br>usually have a heart attack and this<br>includes us when there are you<br>know high temperatures people often have<br>strokes and stuff and and and heart<br>attacks usually uh uh part of that um so<br>why the heart well I reckon actually the<br>brain might fail as well but the heart<br>has the pump continuously obviously or<br>you're dead and in a human heart pumps<br>about 7even tons a day if we think of<br>the mass of water so that's an awful lot<br>Hearts tend to be very sensitive to<br>temperature and it appears that there<br>appears something is going on in terms<br>of ATP Supply um and 90% of ATP comes<br>definitely not love um mitochondria<br>gives you power okay and there's a<br>pretty picture of a mitochondria most<br>cells and animals have a mitochondria or<br>nearly all cells red blood cells in us<br>don't okay so um ATP I talk about ATP<br>some people here won't know what ATP is<br>so ATP is a Denine triphosphate that<br>made it easy didn't it anyway so what it<br>is is this this is a molecule of ATP and<br>on here we've got three phosphates so<br>the the triphosphate means three phosph<br>pH Fates and these are actually charged<br>and the last phosphate can be kind of<br>blown off the end and when this happens<br>it releases quite a lot of energy and<br>that energy can be used to drive muscle<br>contraction the m and heads and muscles<br>to drive iron channels all sorts of<br>things the things that do work now you<br>can push it back on as well but that<br>takes the same amount of energy that it<br>released to put it back on and that is<br>kind of a complicated process so where<br>do we get the energy to do that well we<br>take food we digest it we extract the<br>energy and what I mean by extracting is<br>we pull electrons out of that that food<br>and we use those electrons to drive<br>proton pumps okay and those electrons<br>then flow off to oxygen which then go to<br>form water so it's a nice safe sort of<br>waste product but the protons go have to<br>drive turbines real<br>turbines okay and those turbines are<br>found in the membranes of the<br>mitochondria um and one thing that's<br>kind of really important for here these<br>are the membranes that have the turbines<br>in them and the proton pumps right and<br>they're the same width here as they are<br>here this is a heart mitochondria and<br>this is a liver<br>mitochondria what is a proton it's this<br>big red thing it's positively charged<br>and like an electron which is negatively<br>charged and electrons are used to drive<br>pumps here they pump the protons out and<br>the Paradigm is is that it builds up a<br>gradient on the outside of a bacterium<br>or the outside of the membrane of a<br>mitochondria and then they make their<br>way back through this ATP synas which is<br>a turbine and this was the the concept<br>and kind of discovery of Peter Mitchell<br>who was awarded a Nobel Prize in 1978<br>for<br>this so effectively what's happening is<br>the turbine is turned by protons binding<br>to little subunits within this thing<br>called the SE ring that orange bit at<br>the bottom they go around and they make<br>it turn and then they're ejected on the<br>other side and at the top what's<br>happening is that an ADP and a phosphate<br>go in and they get mushed together and<br>that's the force that pushes them back<br>together to make them ATP and then it<br>can go off and do stuff and I see the<br>protons as being like a bicycle chain<br>simply because bicycles are really<br>cool okay back on topic so what does<br>Hearts<br>so this is kind of a complicated plot<br>it's what we call an arous plot it's<br>where you can try and determine the<br>break point and say a function of an<br>enzyme or something you can use it for<br>looking at heart function as well and it<br>take me ages to explain it but basically<br>trust me the heart of this fish fails<br>which is a a spotted r a common thing<br>you'd get off a pier here um it fails at<br>about<br>272° right so we know that it fails<br>there now this is work done by F IFA<br>that was uh fantastic student of mine my<br>first PhD student and she then uh did<br>some mitochondrial work how do we<br>measure mitochondria well remember that<br>oxygen is used in respiration okay so we<br>need oxygen um and that use of oxygen is<br>kind of proportional to the amount of<br>ATP that is produced so if we measure<br>the oxygen going through the<br>mitochondria um or being used by tissue<br>we can infer what's going on in terms of<br>ATP synthesis you would think okay so<br>what we can do is we can take tissue<br>from an animal take it out we can<br>process it in different ways and we can<br>bun it into these machines called oxy<br>graphs and we can measure the rate of<br>oxygen uptake and we can plot that here<br>the blue line here is the oxygen um<br>concentration dropping as the tissue<br>respires and the red line is US looking<br>at the conversion of that blue line into<br>a rate what we call a flux or the rate<br>of oxygen being consumed and so we can<br>see it here changing as we had all sorts<br>of different fuels and these different<br>fuels represent what's going on inside<br>your cells okay now we've got lots of<br>different machines to do this they're<br>all heroes apart from<br>SpongeBob Joes painted these faces on<br>these machines I don't know what he was<br>thinking about with Spong<br>SpongeBob okay now if we look at<br>respiration and temperature we can see<br>here that as temperature increases it's<br>not it's what you would predict the rate<br>increases in terms of the oxygen uptake<br>and this is very common for cold bodied<br>animals like fish or lizards and things<br>but one of the things we can see here<br>there's kind of a plateau here and that<br>was statistically significant but it's<br>all a bit K so what we did is we used<br>that fluorescent system to measure ATP<br>synthesis and we got a totally different<br>effect what we got is that it didn't<br>actually increase his temperature went<br>up which is kind of odd we didn't do the<br>same temperatures though the lower<br>temperatures but then when we got to<br>about 25° it suddenly started to drop<br>okay and this is fundamentally important<br>to an animal because you need ATP now if<br>you think about what's actually going on<br>the respiration rate is going up you're<br>using lots of oxygen but the ATP<br>synthesis rate is crashing and this<br>means you're using lots of oxygen to<br>make hardly the ATP so your efficiency<br>is is going through the floor and this<br>is probably what is stopping the heart<br>it runs out of ATP your heart only has<br>60 seconds of ATP before it stops if if<br>you don't have oxygen okay all right so<br>what actually makes that the fish we<br>know the heart fails because of the<br>mitochondria what makes the mitochondria<br>fail and this was what the title was of<br>my latest Mazen so the Dogma is that the<br>inner mitochondrial membrane has issues<br>and it becomes leaky to these protons at<br>elevated temperatures but is this<br>actually true let's first look again at<br>how mitochondri works so here's a<br>mitochondria with lots and lots of<br>membranes and Christi and so forth if we<br>zoom in on them we can see these little<br>dots and these dots are all in a line<br>now they've used some sophisticated<br>methods like cryo electron microscopy to<br>actually zoom in and look at what's<br>there and they've then reconstituted the<br>the images they've got and they've<br>worked out that you've got these nodules<br>here and these are the ATP synthases and<br>the ATP synthases from a potato to a<br>human all arrange in V like structure<br>and they form folds on the mitochondrial<br>membrane they form the ridges on Christi<br>okay which are the the membranes inside<br>the<br>mitochondria and this is another version<br>of it where we've got them all lined up<br>in a row and the purple and and blue<br>objects are actually what we call<br>respiratory complexes and we'll just<br>call them pumps for now okay so they are<br>proton pumps and they will pump protons<br>through the membrane and then they make<br>their way through the ATP synthases now<br>why they arranged like this so This is<br>actually missing uh a set of proteins<br>down the end here that actually closes<br>the chrisy off so we'll call this Loop<br>of membrane the<br>Christi Karen Davies is an amazing<br>researcher from the states she actually<br>came up with this concept along with um<br>uh some Germans and we've got a proton<br>pump here and we can see that the<br>protons are being pumped from the Matrix<br>here into what we call the inner<br>membrane inter membrane space the IMs so<br>it goes through here and then somehow<br>miraculously it makes its way to the ATP<br>synthase and pops out now the typical<br>Paradigm here is it's to do with a pH<br>gradient okay so there's a high<br>concentration of protons in that Gap and<br>that concentration is driving the uh the<br>protons uh through the ATP synas and so<br>this is another way of looking at it<br>where I've made a Cheesy cartoon and<br>your protons are making their way<br>through the ATP synthases and they're<br>going at enormous rates really really<br>fast okay now if you heat a mitochondria<br>up the Paradigm is the membranes all of<br>a sudden become leaky the lipid<br>molecules start to move really really<br>fast and protons can sneak through in<br>fact they think that water can actually<br>make its way through the membrane water<br>shouldn't go through membranes but they<br>think it can make what they call water<br>wires and that conducts the protons<br>through so the protons go through and<br>they just get pumped and pumped again<br>but they don't go through the ATP<br>synthes the ATP synthes doesn't turn and<br>you<br>die okay now Peta Mitchell contended<br>that what was actually happening was<br>that protons were being pumped into the<br>inner membrane space and they were<br>building up and they were generating<br>what we call a a low PH or micro domain<br>or a voltage difference across this and<br>in fact it's about .14 um of a Volt<br>across the the the membrane and we can<br>actually measure that but if you<br>actually work out the pH calculate from<br>the ph and you do the math you can<br>actually count how many protons there<br>are in an entire mitochondria and it's<br>about<br>eight okay sounds crazy sounds like a<br>trick of numbers but if you actually<br>work back the number of protons that are<br>in a liter of water at ph7 and so forth<br>it's ridiculously low and then you think<br>of the volume of a mitochondria it's 1 F<br>ler okay but we know I've actually<br>calculated this gnome respiration rates<br>how many protons are flowing 1 million<br>protons are flowing in a single<br>mitochondria every second<br>so where are they in this<br>mitochondria well it brings us to this<br>so some physicists some real scientists<br>actually did some work where they were<br>looking at uh interfaces of membranes<br>and what was going on and if we look at<br>what's actually zoom in on here and we<br>look at it in the intermembrane space we<br>have water okay we also have proteins<br>and things here as well and this is a<br>dangerous place to be if you're an<br>unlucky little proton because you'll get<br>snaffled um and also it's a<br>three-dimensional space and you'll go<br>off all over the place but if we get<br>closer to a membrane what happens is<br>that the water molecues start to align<br>and they actually form an ordered State<br>and it is called the stern layer and it<br>has a nice German name and because it is<br>rules so one of the things is is that<br>this Stern layer lines up and the<br>protons can actually skip from water<br>molecule to water molecule in One<br>Direction there's a really cool um<br>reason for this as well but it makes its<br>way from the pump to the ATP synes and<br>it does this uh really really rapidly<br>but what's important is the distance<br>from here from the the pump to the ATP<br>synthes has to be quite quite small all<br>right so there's a membrane model of how<br>protons actually move and the stern<br>layer has rules it orientates the the<br>water the bulk water phase is in three<br>dimensions and it's chaotic so I told<br>you there would be some chaos the stern<br>layer diffusion is two-dimensional so<br>all of a sudden the protons are<br>restricted to by they've lost their<br>other dimension the distance between the<br>pump and the ATP synthes is actually<br>quite small so that means that they've<br>been attracted towards the ATP synthes<br>well that's what this group contends and<br>with this attractor diffusion is now<br>limited to one dimension okay so what<br>we've got here is we've got a very last<br>transport system next to the membrane<br>and also this layer here this is<br>sensitive to temperature which is kind<br>of interesting so let's look at what<br>happens with a fish this is a banded<br>Rass very much like the spotted Rass<br>quite common around New Zealand um but<br>we're looking at mitochondria now being<br>incubated at different temperatures and<br>it's getting hotter and hotter and<br>hotter and what happens when they get<br>hotter and hotter and hotter is the<br>membranes start to lose their structure<br>and they start to bulge so that got us<br>thinking what's happening to this these<br>Stern layers and how the protons are<br>moving the other thing we can do is you<br>can just take a green LED and shine it<br>through mitochondria and heat them up<br>and it's the light scatters and you can<br>measure the scattering of the light very<br>cheap and effective way of looking at<br>mitochondrial structure and here we're<br>looking at a temperate banded R and a<br>tropical Rass which we got from here in<br>Island we did some work um up there and<br>we can see that the mitochondria are<br>actually swelling as temperature rises<br>and there's a difference between a<br>tropical and a a a temperate fish which<br>is which is comforting all right so so<br>what's actually happening here so this<br>is our standard model of how the protons<br>are flowing now what happens is it gets<br>bigger okay we swell those mitochondria<br>like we saw well one of the things is<br>that the distance between the pump and<br>the ATP synthese is going to increase<br>and this means that the proton is<br>hanging around on the membrane and M or<br>actually get to the ATP synthase so<br>that's one big problem and we can see<br>here on this little plot I did some<br>mathematics and you can actually work<br>out how how long it takes for a proton<br>to move around on the membrane the next<br>thing too is that this thing called the<br>dialectric constant which is how<br>permissive the environment is for the<br>proton to move through it it actually<br>changes with temperature okay so as it<br>gets hotter the dialectric constant of<br>the bulk phase the water drops so that<br>means that it's easier for the proton to<br>go from the membrane into the water okay<br>and it's lost<br>forever so to sum it up what we've<br>actually got here we got a nice close<br>system here everything's working it's<br>all hunky dory it's awesome and then we<br>heat it up and it all turns to custard<br>and the distance gets greater the<br>chances of forming water wires increase<br>and so maybe things are leaking through<br>um from one side to the other and then<br>the other is that maybe the protons are<br>now being lost up into the the watery<br>layer so we could actually test this and<br>what we had to do was get mitochondria<br>heat them up and put a pH indicator into<br>the metor and we could measure changes<br>in PH so we did exactly that and what we<br>see is we heat up heat up heat up<br>nothing really much happens and then all<br>of a sudden above 23° it starts to drop<br>and so this is evidence that the stern<br>layer is probably breaking down it's<br>actually quite a simple experiment which<br>is kind of cool so we just got this just<br>the other day all right and I would say<br>in German that is<br>vabar okay so where now the's actually<br>changed how I think things actually<br>happen so I'm going to go out in a bit<br>of a limb here and this is kind of odd<br>um so what actually propels protons<br>right are they pushed or are they pulled<br>um one of the things too is is it<br>actually electrostatic forces it's<br>something that hasn't been considered<br>that much in terms of how protons move<br>around and this is my little boy Fred<br>and you can see here that static<br>electricity actually has profound<br>effects and we're looking at this at a<br>macro scale not at a molecular scale you<br>can see here is being pushed apart just<br>due to electrical<br>charges so can these effects also<br>explain how the mitochondria Works in<br>its structure all right so I'm proposing<br>something quite new so if we put like<br>charges together they repel don't<br>they think about what's happening at one<br>of these proton pumps where the protons<br>are being pumped out crazy they really<br>high concentrations one of the things is<br>that you can put some Mass to this you<br>can use kum's uh law and you can<br>actually estimate what's probably going<br>on so I was looking at the total amount<br>of protons coming out the second and<br>then how they would actually um dilute<br>as they went through the waters around<br>this uh this this super complex or<br>proton pump and you can see that the<br>actual force between the protons cuz you<br>can Cate the force between them actually<br>drops off as you get further and further<br>away that makes total sense doesn't<br>it now that got us to thinking about or<br>I sat down I thought I could come up<br>with a model to try and explain this so<br>I sat down uh with Tinker Cad and I drew<br>something up and I came up with a<br>different way of thinking of this now<br>think about if we've got one proton pump<br>and it starts pumping the protons are<br>coming out and they're pushing off each<br>other right but if you've got one pump<br>there you don't really get that much<br>power and they're not quite making it to<br>the ATP Sy tases all right now we put<br>two there you've got one proton pump<br>pushing off the other and you've got<br>lots and lots of protons you got a<br>higher concentration the other thing too<br>is because you got two there you get an<br>additive effect so you get amplification<br>all right now I've calculated how many<br>of these pumps you have on the flat part<br>of the the mitochondria and it's round<br>about 20 right so when you put a lot<br>there you really start driving the<br>protons and they can really go quite<br>fast and you get a summative effect of<br>the forces so you get this massive<br>amount of force and this is all<br>electrostatic forces it's not to do with<br>ph okay now if we get an expanding<br>membrane we're stretching the membrane<br>apart and the superc complexes or the<br>pumps are being pulled further and<br>further apart so we also lessen that<br>effect and you can do this just by<br>summing up the number of charges per<br>water molecule and if you actually put<br>the forces into here which is kind of a<br>bit dodgy to do um you start to get<br>massive effects because it's nonlinear<br>you start to get a huge effect to do<br>with um if the membranes are stretching<br>in the mitochondria all right now one<br>last thing before I finish up here is<br>that remember I said that the membranes<br>the say a liver mitochondria doesn't<br>actually have to work that hard it's<br>more it's there processing lots of<br>things that are going on inside your<br>cell it's not necessarily just making<br>ATP but a cardiac mitochondria is<br>basically there just to make tons of ATP<br>for you and so carc mitochondria has a<br>lot of Christy and the liver<br>mitochondria has fewer but if you look<br>at the they're about the same dimensions<br>in terms of how thick they are and this<br>got me wondering about something kind of<br>cool um and I think this is kind of neat<br>now if we zoom in on this tomra this<br>this tomograph we've got of a<br>mitochondria which threedimensional<br>electron microscopy uh image and we look<br>there that's actually looking into a<br>Christi and that's the inner membrane<br>space in that hole okay what we're<br>actually doing is we're bringing around<br>two membranes like this and we've got<br>pump here pump here and they're actually<br>pumping protons into each other so we're<br>actually magnifying the amount of um<br>protons in between them and that gives<br>us a lot of driving force right and so<br>there we are there now what if we swell<br>them we stop all of that and we lose<br>that<br>power okay and you can actually again<br>you can calculate what the forces will<br>be from the known amount of protons on<br>these uh these respiratory complexes so<br>can electrostatic forces explain<br>mitochondrial structure well I think<br>they can um but hypotheses need to be<br>tested to death and this is one of the<br>beauties of science is that we have to<br>put questions out there not be afraid to<br>put them out and test them to bits where<br>you can be wrong the person that came up<br>with this was Sir Peter Mitchell the one<br>who came up with the the concept of<br>oxidate of<br>phosphorilation um a fantastic character<br>actually a very good story um if you<br>want to look him up um in terms of the<br>struggle and<br>science anyway that's kind of it<br>but I've got to thank some people for<br>where I've been um luckily Alice wasn't<br>dribbling in this picture I was a bit<br>annoyed actually hoping she have a big<br>bit of goob um<br>but uh this is from her in Ireland uh we<br>had a great time over there um we've got<br>jules's special research bit of<br>equipment was a paddle board uh and uh<br>yeah it wasn't a noce speach actually<br>and and lots of people I need to thank<br>I've probably missed some people so um<br>apologies uh for that um some special<br>people uh professor John wi's here he<br>gave me lots of breaks actually uh got<br>into hc's and stuff like that that uh<br>that helped me out with um career<br>advancement things and and David<br>Crossman basically for being a good mate<br>he's been with me all the way through<br>from uh being a master student uh<br>fantastic guy um Xian Hong would be lost<br>without Xian absolutely wonderful person<br>uh and she looks after us actually and<br>tells me off most of the time um and um<br>ant um who's been uh best of friends uh<br>and just a great scientist uh to work<br>French which translates to fail inside<br>and stuff like that I got that from<br>feelings okay anyway the one person I<br>really need to thank as my lovely wife<br>um we've we've got the most magnificent<br>family um very lucky uh things have gone<br>well for us uh our boys are beautiful<br>both young and now and uh so is my wife</p></main><footer style="margin-top: 2rem; background: #0001; padding: 2rem; text-align: center;"><p>We Are The
