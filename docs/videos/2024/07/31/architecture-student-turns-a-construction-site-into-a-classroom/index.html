We check in on progress with the project, which will culminate with the house being auctioned in December to raise funds for the continuation and expansion of the programme.</p><h2>Transcript</h2><p style="opacity: 0.9; font-size: 0.8em">Transcripts may be automatically generated and may not be 100% accurate.</p><p>my name is Charlotte McKuen and I teach<br>trades at wre Hill College I'm also my<br>third year of Bachelor of architecture<br>at wre Hill College we are in our trades<br>Department working on renovating um ex<br>state house from kayang Aura and we are<br>turning it into a level seven Home Star<br>home which will be sold when the our BC<br>students which are pre-trade students<br>have completed the renovation and we're<br>doing this over the year of<br>2024 um with the expectation that it all<br>support our students with moving into<br>trade apprenticeships so Kang Ora made<br>this house available to us and they make<br>them available to anybody who's Training<br>trade apprentices so we were had the<br>opportunity to buy the house from<br>kangura for a very small sum and they<br>moved it to site for us and for KO what<br>it does is it means that there's more<br>apprentices coming through to build<br>their developments and it gives us a<br>school we would never have been able to<br>do something as massive of this don't<br>have the budget to start up and they<br>have been able to make that bridge that<br>step between us doing regular school<br>projects into actually building a house<br>and then with the support of BCIT who<br>are the it for building and construction<br>trades they support us with training our<br>students to a high level to ensure that<br>they will be suitable apprentices in the<br>future the students can come in during<br>their class time but they can also opt<br>to come to Saturday school so Saturday<br>building is available for our level two<br>and level three BC students and they<br>sign up but we only have limited places<br>so it's first and first served and we<br>roll out the barbecue at 12:00 and have<br>some sausages in between building<br>because you always need a sausage and it<br>means that our students can have a<br>prolonged period of time as opposed to<br>just an hour which is what we have in<br>our school schedule and our students get<br>to dig in and and get something<br>happening and they get to work in a team<br>which is super important with their<br>construction work they're not working on<br>individual things they need to work as a<br>team and understand that they need to<br>follow on from someone else's work not<br>just always their own when the house<br>project is finished in December we'll be<br>auctioning it at a live public auction<br>and the funds that we receive from that<br>auction will be going to support this<br>program moving forward so the money that<br>we make from the auction will pay for<br>our license Builder the next year and<br>then support the next house coming<br>through and then ideally each house will<br>just run the next so we're a<br>self-sufficient program but the purpose<br>is not to only do a renovation it's<br>actually to be learning best practice<br>and to be learning new practices so<br>we're using this as an opportunity for<br>us all to be learning our students and<br>ourselves</p></main><footer style="margin-top: 2rem; background: #0001; padding: 2rem; text-align: center;"><p>We Are The University</p><ul style="list-style-type: none; padding: 0; margin: 0;"><li><a href="/">Home</a></li><li><a href="/about">About</a></li><li><a href="/contact">Contact</a></li></ul></footer></body></html>
