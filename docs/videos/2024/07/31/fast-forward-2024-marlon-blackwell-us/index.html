100% accurate.</p><p>hi folks um so my name is Andrew Barry<br>I'm on the teaching staff here at the um<br>to part the School of Architecture and<br>planning at the University of ockland<br>and so it's my um pleasure to welcome<br>you here to the fourth lecture in the<br>2024 uh fastforward public lecture<br>series um so just to start off with a<br>couple little bits of house keeping um<br>in the event of an emergency got four<br>exits um the emergency assembly area is<br>out on Simon Street if you need<br>bathrooms there's some bathrooms<br>actually quite close by over on this<br>side of the um of the lecture<br>theater um really want to start by<br>thanking the um folks supporting um both<br>the fastforward lecture series uh and<br>the international architect and<br>residence program that Marlon's part of<br>um and so key in that have been the<br>Warren trust based down in Christ Church<br>um the uh Walter Linton uh fellowship<br>and uh particularly jib um jib have been<br>supporting the fast forward program for<br>years but I think this is the 15th um<br>consecutive year that they've been<br>supporting the program so we're<br>tremendously grateful to them uh and<br>could not<br>do um what we do without their help so<br>I'm so what we're going to do is we're<br>going to show you uh a very Charming<br>video here we go<br>she<br>now um so we've got Richard um Richard<br>Fuller here from jib so just to thank<br>him for what we're about to receive um<br>applause um so um to introduce Marlon so<br>Marlon is the latest in the schools<br>series of international architectures in<br>residences um and this was a program<br>that was started in<br>2010 um bringing um well-renowned<br>Architects to the school both to teach<br>uh and to give public lectures around<br>the country and also to give seminars in<br>in other architecture schools and so<br>that's a a fairly um uh esteemed kind of<br>list um you know we've heard M Kima from<br>tell about well in Tokyo George beard<br>from Toronto bean masteren from the<br>Netherlands Mel Iris Matas from Portugal<br>um and Tucka and yui Tisa again from<br>Tokyo so amazing kind of selection of<br>people that we've been able to put in<br>front of the profession and put in front<br>of our students um to work with them<br>across our semester uh to teach um um<br>and we've been trying to get Marlon here<br>since<br>2020 um you might remember there were<br>few things going on in<br>2020 um and we weren't able to arrange<br>that and that's taken us this long to to<br>um to put that um uh put the program<br>together and so we're really grateful<br>particularly to Jeremy Smith um who's<br>been um really persistent in helping us<br>um uh get the program set up um so<br>Marlon had established his practice in<br>Arkansas um uh in uh uh 1992 and has<br>since then kind of established um an an<br>astonishing reputation in the us both<br>for teaching um uh he's coming to us<br>fresh from a stint at Harvard which we<br>in New Zealand would describe as I guess<br>a pretty good<br>school um and um you know and I won just<br>a phenomenal stack of awards including<br>um uh most recently the American<br>Institute of Architects gold medal which<br>of course kiwi would describe as a<br>pretty big deal um so uh um so um we're<br>incredibly grateful to have him here um<br>he's um teaching with the students and<br>he got to see a little of the country<br>and um next week is doing a lecture down<br>in uh down at Christ Church so would you<br>join me in<br>you wow okay<br>well good evening and thank you thank<br>you Andrew um and thank you Jeremy as<br>the two of them together have uh I don't<br>know we've had a lot of a lot of<br>Adventures uh far far away from each<br>other uh over the last three years just<br>trying to get to this point so it's it's<br>really great to be here and really great<br>to be teaching at school got some of the<br>students here I hope uh in our what<br>we're calling our figure figural<br>figuration studio um and we really<br>kicked it off we've kind of launched<br>into this studio already and uh in in<br>quite a lot of detail I I know this is<br>just some of the work from this morning<br>uh in less than 24 hours they you know<br>each were giving these sort of<br>wonderfully strange figures to interpret<br>and kind of document through models and<br>drawings and analyses and so forth and<br>which will kick off this whole<br>rethinking remaking of Queens Warf uh at<br>least uh on the uh closer to the uh Key<br>Street um so really really rethinking<br>about the war typology and how you might<br>want to rethink that uh through you know<br>these strange little figures so we'll<br>see where it lands um but uh really<br>really pleased to be here and just uh<br>pleased to be working with the students<br>and pleased to be seeing some of the<br>this amazing country uh we had a great<br>experience this weekend on the cormand<br>Del Peninsula I think and otami Beach<br>and Rotorua and hobbiton I don't know if<br>you've been to hington I hear most new<br>zealanders don't go um but nonetheless<br>we had a great time there it was quite<br>my daughter works in in in the in<br>Hollywood so she was uh raptured that we<br>we got to see this so any event um but<br>before we get going I know there<br>probably a lot of folks you know<br>Arkansas you know if New Zealand's far<br>far away even in the US Arkansas is<br>considered Far Far Away uh so I thought<br>it might be good just to<br>uh<br>introduce in some ways uh a little bit<br>about what we're about in a in a in a<br>short video um this is the title of our<br>new monograph radical practice I'll kind<br>of dive into that uh after the video um<br>but this video was made for the Cooper<br>hwit National design award which we were<br>fortunate to win back in 2016 and I'm<br>also very fortunate uh as well to have<br>my partner and the founding principal<br>and the co-founding principal I should<br>say of mar black architect AI Blackwell<br>who's here who's my collaborator uh but<br>likes to put me in in the spotlight for<br>some reason uh but uh any event uh I'm<br>going to start with this little uh video<br>kind of let you kind of get a sense of<br>where we are and where we hope to go uh<br>and then we'll launch into the to whole<br>go so I live practice teach and build in<br>Northwest Arkansas uh home the Ozarks uh<br>the home of Walmart uh we like to call<br>it the land of Bill and B and chickens<br>geographically we're many ways located<br>in the middle of nowhere but uh you know<br>more and more we feel like we're<br>considered to be close to everywhere<br>Arkansas I consider an environment of<br>real natural beauty and simultaneously<br>uh one of real constructed UGL so<br>abandonment uh eraser Nostalgia<br>exploitation they're all aspects of this<br>place I think they sometimes contribute<br>to that perception that uh we're<br>culturally and aesthetically<br>impoverished which is certainly many<br>ways right the opposite but it is true<br>that I live in a Land of disperate<br>conditions it's not just a setting for<br>our work it's really part of our work<br>and I don't see it as a negative in fact<br>I see it as a deep source of<br>possibilities uh uh in direct engagement<br>with the world is where is it's given to<br>us in the everyday world and by choosing<br>to stay for the last 24 years here what<br>have we've been able to do is turn over<br>the Rock and discover the underbelly of<br>our place the visceral presences and the<br>expressive character that really informs<br>and sustains our efforts here now I'm<br>I'm working from a very simple<br>conviction that architecture is larger<br>than the subject of architecture so what<br>we try to do is look at the world around<br>us with a wide angle microscopic lens to<br>generate ideas and actions from our<br>direct experience with the every day<br>between um the ordinary and the<br>extraordinary between between personal<br>history and the history of our<br>discipline and what that demands of us<br>is to be very careful observers of our<br>place of the the geological the<br>biological and always the the cultural<br>aspects of place which has allowed us to<br>develop a more bottomup process that<br>allows us to amplify the small things<br>that manifest the large things so in<br>that line of thinking we can say after<br>uh the great poet William Carlos<br>Williams and his PO Patterson is that<br>there are no ideas but in things I think<br>this uh as contemporary archex really<br>helps us address some very critical<br>questions one is how do you engage the<br>world without being consumed by it and<br>simultaneously how do you enrich and<br>dignify The Experience uh of your place<br>for those who engage your work I think<br>that's something that set of questions<br>we Contin continue to deal with on a<br>day-to-day basis and a large part of<br>that is because we're very interested in<br>demonstrating that architecture can<br>happen anywhere at any scale in any<br>budget so we take on all comers all<br>projects from the praic to the honorific<br>from a free health clinic to the new<br>architecture school uh in an attempt<br>to use design to develop a a culture in<br>communities where you would typically<br>wouldn't expect to find it I think it's<br>safe to say that most architecture isn't<br>very good and most good architecture is<br>good enough for most stes but<br>there is some architecture some<br>buildings that should rise above the<br>everyday in many ways I see our task is<br>the task of recreating<br>strangeness uh of developing a<br>connection to our place that's singular<br>and yet simultanously Universal<br>simultaneously local and yet having a<br>global<br>presence okay so hopefully that gives a<br>just a a little ins it to how we're<br>thinking of course a lot of folks when<br>we came up with a new monograph that was<br>titled radical practice they were saying<br>what are you thinking and because we're<br>in Arkansas and you like how how can you<br>be radical in Arkansas or whatever and<br>I'd like to remind people that it's not<br>so much in this use of the word the kind<br>of popular use of the word as something<br>a Vanguard or revolutionary but we use<br>it from its 14th century Origins as an<br>adjective from the late Latin word<br>radicalist uh which is really means root<br>uh as in relating to or proceeding from<br>a root or Roots so basically it's really<br>about a Fidelity to our roots to the to<br>the origins of place to the fundamentals<br>necessary for us to affect change<br>transformation and basically<br>transformation in our place or the<br>places that we work and that we're<br>getting to work these days and I think<br>in Thor's words he said it very well<br>Heaven is under our feet as well as over<br>our heads so when we bring together<br>disperate understandings forces and<br>observations of situation and place we<br>like to refer to them as abstract unions<br>and Abstract unions are found most often<br>in a place of Unholy unions which<br>Encompass many ways our approach it<br>helps us address questions of practice<br>versus theory of Engagement versus<br>Detachment from the world and questions<br>of form<br>and frankly most of our work occurs in<br>places where Detachment is simply not<br>even an option even if we wanted it to<br>be for<br>a um rather than a removal from reality<br>abstraction for us uh in many ways is<br>the process of connecting to place of<br>generating a productive tension between<br>the local and the global like to call it<br>the gloal and always looking for<br>possibilities for using an economy of<br>means for maximum of<br>meaning and let me see if I can get this<br>to work here yep here we go so we're a<br>firm of 27 people like say based in<br>fville architect or fville Arkansas and<br>for the last 30 years or so we've been<br>working on a variety of building types a<br>variety of scales a variety of pip<br>points uh buildings uh everything from<br>carports uh to schools to healthc care<br>now uh and even to uh American embassies<br>working for the state department so uh<br>let's see if I can get this to go<br>forward here uh so uh just to kind of<br>give you an idea of where we're working<br>locally and nationally in the US but<br>also uh because of the state department<br>the embassy work uh more globally in<br>fact uh working on a new project in uh<br>Durban a small culate in Duran South<br>Africa and a new American Embassy from<br>the ground up in the poorest country in<br>the world world and bangi Central<br>African Republic so it's given us a a<br>great way to kind of operate from a<br>variety of different scales uh in<br>different types and from this<br>perspective there's first and foremost a<br>core principle at the heart of our<br>practice and radical in many ways in its<br>fundamental Simplicity and that is the<br>assertion of the making of buildings and<br>places as a constant authentic focus and<br>embedded in this assertion however is a<br>proposition that architecture must<br>possess more than projected or or<br>speculative character that architecture<br>fundamentally requires material<br>substance tectonic construction and<br>lived experience and that on these terms<br>architecture just as fundamentally is<br>located situated and placed in the world<br>so for us place is the<br>canvas architecture of the medium and<br>shape by the forces of nature and public<br>life and is particular to local form so<br>we like to say that we operate and we<br>make work in the place of the place for<br>the place and at times necessarily out<br>of place uh this is our office here uh<br>in in fville where we took an old uh an<br>old mertile building from the 30s for<br>$69 a square foot uh and using some<br>paint and uh kind of rethinking of the<br>existing window openings sort of sort of<br>transformed the whole character of this<br>building both outside and inside now<br>place for us is defined as a tangible<br>representation of that intangible<br>society that lives within it something<br>we like to call placess so to make an<br>architecture of placess it's really<br>necessary for us to embrace everything<br>about a place even the bad things to get<br>below the surface to get to the<br>underbelly so we can understand these<br>things<br>and incorporate them in who we are and<br>what an architecture of the place in the<br>place and for the place can be and so<br>often this is really a story of<br>transformation uh and engagement with<br>challenges much larger than any one<br>person when you come into our office<br>you're always confronted with the bear<br>um I have a story I used to be a<br>wrestler and I had to wrestle a live<br>bear uh at one point in high school it's<br>a long story uh usually told over uh<br>several Bourbons but it's it's an<br>existential thing that we kind of<br>confront in the office is being able to<br>take on those challenges much larger<br>than you and taking on them willingly<br>and being willing to deal with the<br>uncertainty and difficulties of our<br>profession in the process of kind of<br>transforming our building we we thought<br>what could we do with some paint uh on<br>the side because we had other than these<br>windows no other way to transform this<br>existing kind of rather deric building<br>um so we hired this one guy and who<br>hired to paint stripes on the building<br>uh took took him four months uh to paint<br>all the stripes uh when he finished he<br>said uh I said well this looks great he<br>goes yeah I think I did a good job he<br>said next time uh you know I'll call you<br>you don't call me okay so anyways so<br>part of our transformation story um but<br>it does remind me uh very often of a<br>story that uh I like to tell that<br>originated in fville Arkansas back<br>postwar and we're really known for our<br>post-war architecture in fville and<br>started with a family the Fulbright<br>family you may have heard of Senator<br>William J Fulbright Fullbright<br>scholarships he family owned a mill uh<br>they used local White Oak to make farm<br>implements Wagon Wheels ax handles plow<br>shares uh a host of different implements<br>um and postwar the inventory there was<br>beginning to build up the demand had<br>dropped and he was getting quite<br>concerned as terms of his business and<br>he had a childhood friend who also grew<br>up in fville who was at that time an<br>internationally known architect uh who<br>was based in New York but was building<br>the first Fine Arts uh uh complex on a<br>university or us University campus at<br>the University of Arkansas his name was<br>Edward derell Stone and so he went to<br>his friend Ed and he said look you're a<br>creative person what could we do with<br>all these tools all these implements um<br>that uh could I don't know make it help<br>us on with our business in some ways and<br>so Ed came back in a few weeks weeks and<br>he said well here's my idea what we can<br>do is repurpose these tools we can<br>modify them into an international line<br>of furniture that can populate my new<br>complex and create a new business stream<br>and revenue for you and so that's what<br>they did so Wagon Wheels became<br>stools uh plow handles became these<br>beautiful chairs uh plow shares along<br>with a traditional uh uh Ozark craft of<br>basket making uh became these beautiful<br>Chase lounges and so they created a<br>whole International line uh of of<br>of furniture through these repurposed<br>tools so basically taking what the world<br>had given to them what they already had<br>and finding new ways to represented on<br>their terms and very much that is what<br>we're involved in doing and it can have<br>immediate impact which it did locally<br>there with the business and with this<br>new Fine Arts Complex but if you go to<br>New York today go to some place like the<br>C who at design Museum you'll find these<br>very same implements so that impact that<br>effect that ripple effect goes well<br>beyond the local into the global and<br>more Universal and that is that kind of<br>exchange we're looking for in our work<br>where the new develops out of the old<br>and the old however is changed in the<br>light of the new and so we find<br>ourselves very often drawing inspiration<br>between those conditions that are Nature<br>Made and culture made looking for the<br>patterns that connect and as well<br>operating between the ideal in our<br>discipline and the more improvised in<br>our discipline and not seeing one as a<br>positive positive or A negative but<br>understanding our task is not to resolve<br>one to the other but to find resonance<br>between these conditions through the<br>things that we make it's very important<br>to how we operate and just a quick note<br>um I started out in this world with<br>aspirations to be a cartoonist uh and<br>cartooned for all the way through<br>college just about uh and only recently<br>discovered in the last 10 years or so<br>that almost every uh building we do is<br>understood as a Vis and understood<br>through Section so we kind of developed<br>a whole genealogy of these uh different<br>buildings and their iconographic uh<br>character so the expressive character is<br>captured through this economy of marks<br>that you have to do in a reductive way<br>as a as a as a Cartoonist to communicate<br>and so in the same way we think about<br>that uh relative to building so uh I'll<br>start with our first building um we like<br>to call it radical profile which is the<br>St Nicholas Eastern Orthodox Church a a<br>small uh congregation in Springdale<br>Arkansas uh that was worshiping in a<br>rundown office building in Downtown<br>Springdale uh they have a very<br>aestheticized form of worship uh and<br>lots of symbols U lots of rituals lots<br>of icons and this was not a dignified<br>place in which they uh wanted to worship<br>and one of their parishioners died and<br>left some money so they were able to go<br>out and buy a piece of land uh which uh<br>they did out near the in interstate and<br>they had about $100 a square foot left<br>over to build a building they wanted a<br>new sanctuary and a fellowship hall and<br>located on this piece of property was a<br>house they wanted to keep for the priest<br>uh for Father John essentially and this<br>one building and we are out on the site<br>and they said we would love for you to<br>take this and turn this<br>into a church uh and I said do you mean<br>like tear it down and build on the<br>footprint they go no no no this welding<br>shed we can you make it into a church we<br>only have $100 a square foot uh and so<br>naturally our hearts sank uh and uh<br>trying to figure out what the heck are<br>we to do uh and so we went back to<br>Origins uh we went back to the classical<br>Greek proportioning systems that were<br>used in the early uh churches of uh the<br>Orthodox church and this proportioning<br>system uh made a lot of sense to us<br>because we thought well $100 a square<br>foot what doesn't cost very much and as<br>Architects I can tell you the proportion<br>of scale really don't cost anything<br>they're relatively free and so we just<br>use this proportion system to create a<br>new figure a transformation uh with all<br>of the icons uh and all the the<br>particular sort of colors that they were<br>looking for in the simple sacred face of<br>the church and then mixed in a little<br>bit of corbusier and the canopy because<br>we believe everything goes better with a<br>little bit of Corb um and that's how we<br>did it and so you can begin to see we<br>just took the existing building metal<br>everything left it whole wrapped it in a<br>new skin added 10t to the front to<br>create a a a narx where you move north<br>south to get on an East West axis into<br>the sanctuary with uh swinging doors for<br>or walls let's say for overflow into the<br>fellowship hall very simple uh simple<br>strategy and then just through a<br>Fidelity to craft and thought<br>off-the-shelf uh metal panel systems<br>that we get and then just custom uh<br>break all the transitional details at<br>the corner and the eaves and the Sills<br>to create a seamless effect of the<br>sighing and every window door even the<br>gutters and down spouts are coursed uh<br>into uh this the coursing of the of the<br>metal ribs themselves in fact you can<br>see there's a concrete pad there that's<br>the fire exit right there just kind of<br>Blends right in with a sighting so just<br>as a sense to elevate the ordinary uh<br>and of course<br>cut a hole or a window in the east side<br>to let Morning Light in into the<br>existing building through that uh the<br>icon stasis is made out of bar stock of<br>course their desire was to really have a<br>dome and we couldn't put a dome on the<br>outside uh because of the pre-engineered<br>structure so they allowed us to put a<br>dome in the plenum uh of this and but<br>they couldn't afford the Dome we expect<br>and our contractor uh didn't feel like<br>he could make one that would measure up<br>uh to our expectations either so that we<br>were in a bit of a quander in the<br>construction I said well what are we<br>going to do the contractor says I have a<br>friend and he loves beer and he's a<br>metal worker about 20 mies out in the<br>mountains and he has a a satellite dish<br>that he said he'll trade us for a couple<br>cases of beer so that's what we did we<br>get the beer and then we went out there<br>picked it up trucked it back in of<br>course it's its own natural laugh so we<br>skim coated it uh in plaster jacked it<br>up on a scissor lift and they have their<br>d<br>so that's how we roll in Arkansas and of<br>course I was so excited about this told<br>Father John now you have a direct<br>connection to God um he reminded us that<br>was pointed in the wrong direction so<br>but nonetheless I had another fellow on<br>the building committee was excited he<br>said you know uh I know where we can get<br>a free uh throne for the bishop when he<br>comes to bless the place uh it's Walnut<br>it's got crushed purple velvet<br>upholstery uh and I can get it for free<br>and I said wow where's where he goes<br>well the local liquor store it's part of<br>an ad campaign they said I could have it<br>once the campaign's over he goes I just<br>don't know what we're going to do with<br>the embroidered CR on it I go CR what do<br>you mean he goes you know Crown<br>Royal and Father John overheard us and<br>walked over said no Christ the Redeemer<br>get the chair so that's how that's how<br>we R so in 2013 we got a phone call from<br>the National Institute the AIA honor and<br>awards program to let us know this had<br>won a National Institute honor award and<br>we're very excited about that but they<br>said you know the cost of this was so<br>little I said we we were kind of<br>motivated to go look at the history of<br>the program and see where this ranked in<br>there and they discovered this is the<br>least expensive building to ever win a<br>National Institute honor award and so it<br>underscored what we've been trying to do<br>Ai and I and our firm for the last 30<br>years where we're at is to demonstrate<br>that architecture can happen anywhere at<br>any scale at any budget and for anyone<br>it's not just reserved for the select<br>few but should be accessible by everyone<br>and so that's something that has really<br>guided us this sort of using an economy<br>of means for a maximum of meaning and<br>this has just taken this last Orthodox<br>Easter with the processions around the<br>church and through and it's still a a<br>really a living uh uh thing and and the<br>church is growing and we're helping them<br>expand as<br>well so uh thinking about transformation<br>we thought about it the scale of you<br>know a tool into Furniture we talk about<br>the scale of a metal building now how<br>about the scale of a landscape so this<br>is uh Shelby Farms Park in Memphis<br>Tennessee it's the largest urban park in<br>the United States it's 4,500 Acres it's<br>a park uh that was led by uh James<br>Corner field operations you might know<br>them from the Highline in New York uh<br>they were working on this project for<br>several years before we came on and the<br>idea was to create an identity for the<br>part to uh get it into the black because<br>it was constantly struggling to survive<br>to help with its socioeconomic and<br>racial diversity which it was very<br>uneven uh and so we were asked to work<br>in the heart of the park 200 Acres uh in<br>on expanded Lake to develop a Ensemble<br>of buildings that would create revenue<br>and increase program activity and<br>identity uh for the part and this uh is<br>the kind of connection from Arkansas<br>into uh Memphis Memphis the place a rock<br>and roll some great barbecue uh all<br>happening up next to the Mississippi<br>River but on the opposite side of town<br>uh this park used to be a penal farm and<br>so prisoners worked this 4,500 acres for<br>1920s to the 70s uh developing crops uh<br>as well as Blue Ribbon cattle uh and<br>they used that to feed themselves and<br>what wasn't uh used by them was sold off<br>to the county so when that was no longer<br>an acceptable form of Rehabilitation it<br>was turned back over to the county which<br>did not know how to manage it properly<br>and so speculators started moving in<br>citizens got upset and they really said<br>we need a park on this side of the<br>county and so they banded together and<br>formed a 501c nonprofit and it became<br>Shelby Farm's part uh but again it was<br>struggling along the way and so this<br>idea of expanding this Lake uh and<br>adding a series of buildings uh with<br>specific programs was very important now<br>the buildings were located around the<br>lake which was an old p pure uh with<br>very little foliage and one of the<br>things we noticed in the park when we<br>went out to visit it was wherever there<br>was shade there were people no people no<br>shade so we realized that every building<br>had to make its own shade uh and so we<br>also were mindful of the vernacular here<br>the the old porches uh the old dog trots<br>and breezeways uh that created passive<br>Cooling and shade uh so that sort of<br>kind of moved us forward in this line of<br>thinking of returning to Origins and<br>projecting forward so the first building<br>is a visitor center 8,000 ft Visitor<br>Center with an 8,000 ft porch uh it's<br>all made out of uh local uh bar grate<br>aluminum barg grate you typically walk<br>on we turn it into a cladding system we<br>use third growth Cyprus it's a renewable<br>resource there and a series of dog trots<br>that breezeways that act as extended<br>thresholds into the landscape and then<br>present you with this beautiful<br>uninterrupted view 32t Canal lever uh<br>here that makes this uh beautiful porch<br>that they can program year round why<br>because it's ventilated so Memphis is<br>very hot traps the air in the shade so<br>you can be out of the Sun but you're<br>still sweating so we ventilate it with<br>five 20 foot Big Ass Fans which is the<br>that's the trade name on it I don't know<br>if they have that here in New Zealand um<br>but they are big and they create great<br>ventilation you know whole new Revenue<br>stream yoga out there receptions a whole<br>host of things even<br>weddings and you can get to see the kind<br>of ephemeral nature too of the cladic<br>that it presents a sort of translucency<br>and that really reflects the light in a<br>variety of different ways and a<br>beautiful configuration of the land that<br>field operations did for each of the<br>buildings to get them to sort of marry<br>together and resonate uh with the<br>landscape picnic Provisions we call the<br>Crickets these are booked out for months<br>at a time big big uh uh uh with families<br>and family reunions uh really popular<br>and those are sort of sprinkled around<br>the edge of the lake course course the<br>spaces between these different figures<br>is very important as well how they're<br>programmed with activities like water<br>play this is the boat house with kayaks<br>and canoes and concession stand uh here<br>all using a similar uh pallet of<br>materials very you know just the bar<br>grate uh zinc like metal panels uh and a<br>little bit of wood when we<br>can uh the event stage serves the events<br>lawn uh for uh concerts and such but<br>also for events on the lake as well and<br>when it's not being used of course it<br>makes a great shade Pavilion in and of<br>itself and then finally the restaurant<br>Event Center which kind of works along<br>the edge the sort of South edge of the<br>lake uh and it's uh uh the kind of the<br>largest uh 500 uh capacity Conference<br>Center but a has a really great uh<br>restaurant uh which uh is quite lovely<br>because it's all about this interface<br>between uh the lake uh and that public<br>way and the folks here uh in the event<br>space But as well as the restaurant an<br>80 foot deep Port all ventilated more<br>seats outside than inside so it really<br>sets up some beautiful uh views to uh<br>the landscape especially at Sunset so<br>what has happened since this is opened<br>well uh the attendance has doubled uh<br>the uh diversity issues they were<br>confronted have been resolved and have<br>increased by over 50% and they have<br>remained in the black for the last8<br>years since they opened terms of profit<br>able to sustain themselves uh as well so<br>it kind of demonstrates the capacity of<br>architecture to strengthen institutions<br>and to be somewhat transformative uh in<br>the way in which you can think about<br>Landscapes uh as much as about<br>architecture or that studied<br>relationship uh between the two so in<br>this line of thinking uh we were asked<br>to try a new project out in Detroit<br>Michigan which is Detroit is a really<br>tough place that's dealing with its own<br>issues of attrition and eraser and<br>emptiness let's so so to speak but it's<br>starting to come back and there was a<br>college there called Mery Grove College<br>which is traditional uh African-American<br>liberal arts college located in Six Mile<br>in the McNichols Livermore neighborhood<br>that had started to lose students and<br>enrollment uh got into financial trouble<br>and eventually had to shut down this en<br>entire campus and the kesy foundation<br>stepped in and came up with a way to<br>repurpose this campus from what they<br>call a cradle to Career campus so from<br>the time when an infant when is born<br>even prenatal uh and all the way until<br>they're 20 years old they can go to<br>school here and create a kind of<br>trajectory of lifelong learning and<br>opportunity uh as as they leave here and<br>so the Cornerstone of this was the marry<br>Grove early childhood education center<br>25,000 ft one-story facility for uh<br>prenatal all the way to kindergarten<br>this was going to be the backbone of<br>this this whole Endeavor here situated<br>in this neighborhood that was in<br>desperate need of a kind of<br>revitalization uh of this campus and the<br>possibilities the whole strength of any<br>community centers around the schools and<br>that's the problem Detroit is having<br>right now all the hipsters are moving in<br>and as soon as they start having<br>children they all move out to the<br>suburbs so how to how to begin to start<br>to address that and this is a National<br>model for Early Childhood uh education<br>so it's a it's a a mat condition as you<br>can see here and what we began to do is<br>carve a series of uh Courtyards that are<br>controlled play areas but also uh areas<br>for daylighting into the middle of the<br>building as well as very uh significant<br>in the wayf finding and organization uh<br>of the spaces and you can begin to see<br>how it situates itself on the campus and<br>then how the campus is situated into<br>this neighborhood tons of the single<br>family home is very important part uh of<br>the<br>neighborhood and of course the other big<br>concern uh the community is that they<br>wanted it to resonate with these<br>historical uh collegate Gothic Limestone<br>buildings but they wanted their own<br>identity as well because as much as it<br>was a school was a community center so<br>the feedback we got from the community<br>engagement is uh we're not interested in<br>mono chromatic buildings we don't want<br>to Brick build or a copper building or a<br>wood building we want polych chroma we<br>want multi colors uh which is terrifying<br>for most Architects including myself the<br>idea that you have to take color from<br>the inside and pull it to the outside<br>it's like taking the liner colorful<br>liner of your jacket and wearing that um<br>at least I was terrified but we uh work<br>together as a team uh to find the right<br>material that would be resilient which<br>was a glazed terracotta panel a rib<br>panel and then developed a whole pallet<br>uh of colors that would be at once uh<br>how would you say Punchy uh but also<br>resonant with the Limestone and<br>contextual and in my discussions with<br>Wendy L Jackson who's the director of<br>development for kesy uh we both found a<br>commonality of what we're after here<br>which is this idea of a coat of many<br>colors um uh a kind of a unifying quilt<br>uh of inclusion let's say that speaks to<br>about the diversity in his neighborhoods<br>and uh and and is somewhat<br>representative of that and we were both<br>reminded of our experiences visiting the<br>quilt ladies in gesb Alabama uh I'm<br>originally from Alabama and I I knew of<br>these folks these uh ladies that live in<br>a remote part of Alabama that would take<br>discarded rags and then stitch them into<br>uh quilts that were useful uh uh you<br>know everyday objects or artifacts but<br>also uh beautiful works of art in fact<br>they're displayed in the Museum of<br>Modern Art in New York today so we went<br>and visited uh them this is the Petway<br>family this their quilt Co-op uh just to<br>kind of draw in some inspiration there<br>and then began to develop this Patchwork<br>uh and this palette uh I think works<br>quite well uh for the students every<br>color costs money so we had to be very<br>mindful of just a few colors and a base<br>colors to make this whole thing work<br>together and then we animated the facade<br>through the grabbing of light from the<br>side light from above light from the<br>front and it created these sort of<br>spatial articulations uh of the windows<br>uh and then gently uh the wall the entry<br>wall kind of folds in where you slip in<br>uh to the space and then you're<br>confronted with the first uh Courtyard<br>Lobby on the left a coffee shop for the<br>families on the right uh Community<br>spaces so basically you could drop your<br>kid off but you could hang around you<br>could meet with friends you could have<br>coffee so it's it's really become<br>becomes a a a central uh Focus uh in the<br>community um and these again are<br>education These Are CL outdoor class<br>rooms as well as play areas uh as well<br>as social areas as well as places uh for<br>Solitude as well and all of the<br>classrooms are really thought about not<br>only how they operate as a classroom but<br>how education can operate in every space<br>outdoor indoor and even in the<br>circulation spaces uh they're always<br>considered spaces for learning here<br>we're carving out a reading room uh out<br>of a circulation space<br>here um and then every classroom has<br>direct uh engagement with the outside so<br>doors open up having a lesson making a<br>point on the inside you can take that<br>transfer immediately in an analog<br>analogous way to the outside very<br>important um and you can just kind of<br>get a sense of the the various uh ways<br>in which these are landscaped and the<br>types of activities for play for eating<br>they can have their lunch out here and<br>it's all in a controlled environment and<br>the staff also gets its own break area<br>its own Courtyard uh which is quite nice<br>as well just to kind of take a<br>break all the community rooms are lit<br>from above lots of spaces are begin to<br>gather both not only during the day but<br>also in the evening so their building<br>has life uh uh after after work uh<br>Courtyards then begin to spill out into<br>the southern Grove here of trees um and<br>then our landscape architect Margie ruik<br>did a beautiful job of weaving in a<br>learning and playscape amongst the trees<br>here and and then this is all facing<br>back into the neighborhood so you can<br>walk when people walk with their kids<br>they they are greeted it's not the rear<br>of the building but it's another front<br>and Al acts as a type of Beacon uh in<br>the<br>community so very excited uh about this<br>had a huge impact of in the neighborhood<br>I'd say the operative word is Joy when<br>you go there uh Joy with the families<br>Joy with the students and with the<br>faculty and staff working there and I<br>had the opportunity a and I to go back<br>to G's bend after this was done just to<br>visit see what they had uh possibility<br>for acquiring a quilt and while I was<br>meeting with uh Miss marann Petway who I<br>originally talked to when we started the<br>building I said you know the building is<br>done that we've done and I pulled up my<br>phone a photo of the building and she<br>looked at it and I said look what your<br>your quilts have inspired and goes well<br>you have inspired me uh to do a quilt uh<br>and so the whole thing kind of circled<br>back you know it's just a the way these<br>things often<br>work so we're now working on a probably<br>the other than the embassy the largest<br>sort of domestic project we've ever had<br>the opportunity to work on an important<br>project it's a a national Center for<br>Health for preventative health uh and<br>it's located on the campus of the<br>Crystal Bridges American art museum in<br>Bentonville Arkansas now this is<br>Arkansas it's has the kind of natural<br>beauty you find here in New Zealand I<br>think and we're really defined by our<br>car typography in the Ozarks uh and our<br>forest uh the how would you say the<br>forest and the cave so to speak um and<br>that was something that really informed<br>our thinking about this new uh National<br>Whole Health Institute um and this is uh<br>the funer or the patron is Alice Walt<br>the H one of the hir to the Walmart<br>foundation and and on again the campus<br>of her American Art<br>Museum and the thing about you need to<br>know about the Arkansas or Ozark so to<br>speak is that it's really tough to grow<br>anything there our cash crop is rocks we<br>have a lot of rocks and it's just kind<br>of hard scrabbled place um and so<br>there's a whole tradition of building<br>with rocks there this is the campus as<br>you see so in red you'll see that<br>National Whole Health Institute we're<br>doing we call it the Heartland Whole<br>Health Institute on your left lower left<br>and then it's companion parking garage<br>the Crystal Bridges Art Museum which<br>kind of bridges over an existing stream<br>and then a new preventative health<br>medical college that's also being built<br>in the upper right hand<br>corner uh the American art museum is<br>designed by mosha softi uh she might be<br>familiar with uh and it's really a<br>stunning the most important American Art<br>Museum in America since the Whitney<br>built in the ' 50s<br>um but this use of stone is uh something<br>that's been going on for uh decades in<br>uh Northwest Arkansas where they take<br>the Field Stone and just lean it up and<br>fit it in and make a cladding uh for<br>these structures houses and churches uh<br>it's a vernacular we call it giraff<br>Stone uh because it just looks like<br>giraffe um so we thought that would be<br>an interesting way in which we can make<br>our connection to place to kind of<br>rethink how this vacular could work and<br>and projected into the 21st century so<br>the Whole Health Institute is a kind of<br>rethinking of um how health services are<br>delivered uh and also uh setting up uh<br>something that you know this all starts<br>with the local uh so these are own<br>interpretation of the giraffe Stone the<br>idea of the Cave the that which the<br>building the offices and so forth sit<br>upon the forest upon the cave as you see<br>here and it's programmed with a series<br>of exhibition space<br>uh event rooms uh consultation rooms um<br>meditation yoga a whole host of things<br>that deal with life management and<br>well-being and of course sets up as an<br>extended again threshold into the campus<br>uh as well and so this idea of the force<br>and the cave were sort of uh manifested<br>through material and in this case not<br>wood but uh pre-weathered brass brolay<br>fins and this local local rock uh and<br>and the Rope joints in which we kind of<br>put that together makes a a beautiful<br>pallet one very light and one<br>solid and I'm going to show you some<br>construction photos because it is under<br>construction schedule to be finished<br>January of next year but it's really<br>starting to come together with its<br>brolay uh and the stone base and the<br>Beautiful rethinking and reworking that<br>the Masons have done uh and using the<br>stone the building is very gently uh<br>curves uh and flows both inside and<br>outside kind of around a ravine it kind<br>of encapsulates an event lawn uh uh lots<br>of activities for the University as well<br>as the hospital uh<br>work and then sectionally along these<br>Ravines there's an interface here not<br>only with uh the garage as you see has a<br>plaza down into a ravine a playscape<br>here but the whole whole hell Institute<br>it's interface with the Ravine as well<br>so it creates a series of cleaves and<br>porches and Cave likee spaces uh for<br>activities and uh places to hang and<br>linger so this is the the basic uh<br>formal 3D aspects of it uh and then just<br>some renderings as that starts to come<br>together with a community porch and a<br>series of porches underneath shaded<br>areas so really uh really kind of turns<br>the institution inside out in many in<br>many<br>ways and here you begin to see it uh<br>again under construction with its<br>two-story Community porch<br>here and our strategy was very simple it<br>was really inspired by the sort of<br>strided bark of our local oak trees um<br>but here we developed it into a briolet<br>of these pre-weathered brass fins that<br>are beveled on the ends and some are<br>beveled uh in One Direction and then<br>some are beveled in the opposite<br>direction to catch your uh Shadow and<br>light and get a kind of flickering over<br>the course of the day everything is<br>developed through onetoone mockups uh<br>testing the stone testing the fins to<br>get the right finish and the right way<br>in which it works with the sun and so<br>there's a idea that you never uh get the<br>same sort of flickering uh over the<br>course of a day or a season right so<br>it's the idea was to sort of develop an<br>architecture that's imbued with the<br>order of change so I'm going to<br>eventually make a video of this to show<br>how this slowly uh flickers along this<br>this Bret but here you can see under<br>construction uh at this moment in time<br>and you begin to see these Cliffs uh and<br>these cave likee space es so the forest<br>and the cave which is a a really<br>important uh meme in where we're from<br>here you get another sense of that as<br>well and this is the first time we've<br>used a they've developed a wall That's<br>20t tall using this sort of vacular<br>system uh with these pronounced rope<br>joints give it texture and pattern and<br>great life uh and and it really does<br>bring the the whole uh project to life<br>uh and and something that is strangely<br>familiar uh to many folks from all walks<br>of life that come here uh and then just<br>to kind of a sense uh here of how that<br>begins to work with the different<br>elements uh as it forms the base on the<br>inside the same idea of again the idea<br>of the cave or the stone uh and the<br>forest uh Stone floors uh plastered<br>walls but then the canopy is all local<br>pecan uh trees so that's all CNC mil uh<br>to to make this uh beautiful Forest like<br>canop on every floor um and then you're<br>kind of getting a sense of how that's uh<br>coming together here in the construction<br>with the grand stair that leads up to<br>all the the different office areas and<br>consultation rooms uh and these open<br>office areas have a series of conference<br>areas uh as well as uh uh Community<br>spaces uh and then open office spaces<br>here so again you flow through there's<br>probably not a 90° angle hardly in the<br>building um and then a meditation space<br>here for uh folks to use this is<br>essentially a 30ft cone that's bent<br>towards the north that captures the<br>north light bends this light uh into the<br>space 14 people can sit in there and<br>commune<br>together and you kind of begin to see it<br>in this uh in this section and it's also<br>being coming together so I was very<br>fascinated how they were going to build<br>this we suggested how they could build<br>it but we didn't really know but very<br>clever uh contractors we have uh reminds<br>me of a bat mitten kind of deal but uh<br>and then they'll coat all of this in a a<br>beautiful Venetian plaster but this is<br>it and then how the light will kind of<br>pour through so you no won't see the<br>you'll see there there is the light has<br>a source but you never see actually uh<br>where it comes from you never see the<br>outside so this is slowly coming<br>together so what this really becomes<br>about is an intersection of art nature<br>architecture and health and how all of<br>those things combine together other to<br>achieve you know a better sense of<br>well-being uh a better sense of how one<br>can manage life how can live uh a<br>healthy life and and it's something that<br>like would say we looking forward to uh<br>coming up to fruition uh in January and<br>you see too that we've embedded art all<br>through the campus as well in the<br>building itself uh to interface with<br>these uh different pathway Journeys so<br>the companion building is a parking<br>garage 18 800 uh basis but rather than<br>just give a parking garage we challenged<br>the owner and said what if we programmed<br>this to be also a precum for art<br>sculpture display events I'll have a bar<br>you kind have a bar in a parking garage<br>uh<br>retail right on the edge of this<br>beautiful Plaza that leads into the<br>Ravine where there'll be a playscape so<br>we're working with Brian Hayne Studio of<br>landscape uh out of out of<br>Philadelphia so here you begin to see<br>that interface of the porch into the<br>plaza and ravine<br>uh and you kind of get a sense of people<br>come from the parking through the prum<br>down uh unto the underneath of the porch<br>here and that's where a lot of activity<br>begins to<br>happen and and and this is this is it<br>today just just finishing<br>construction kind of get a sense of that<br>uh so there's the sculpture that lights<br>up at night and they have music events<br>up here and then underneath uh the porch<br>here you see this interface there's the<br>bar the retail shop the play area wet<br>area uh really becomes a great public<br>gathering space uh and you here you can<br>see how the the bar is working uh and<br>that just everything just opens up<br>becomes one big porch uh for you know<br>where you can sit and have a beer or<br>such now one of the things we've been<br>experimenting with uh with panels<br>and Sherwin Williams is how to get very<br>specific custom colors in our metal<br>panels we do a lot of metal panel work<br>uh so we've been working with uh muscle<br>cars uh<br>and using PPG codes uh for those so they<br>have every car color ever made so this<br>is my grandmother's 65 Pontiac Tempest<br>aquazure blue and so that's what we used<br>for the building and so it's all and<br>then we put our own metal flake have<br>them put you know certain amounts of<br>that in the surface that gives it a<br>certain kind of depth and really becomes<br>a one-of-a-kind uh metal finish color<br>finish and so and then of course and<br>then we perforate it and then light it<br>up at night so it's always kind of<br>transforming itself uh you know over the<br>course of the day and doing the same<br>thing here so it really becomes quite<br>alive so this is uh again another<br>opportunity for to be a beacon for the<br>campus so our first uh tall building is<br>coming online in U in Boston across from<br>the Harvard Business School we're part<br>of a something called the Enterprise<br>research campus um this is uh it's<br>located uh in Alon really Alon Mass<br>right across the Charles River from<br>Boston uh across from the the the<br>Harvard Business School it's a kind of<br>joint venture between tishman Spire the<br>developer and Harvard and it's located<br>uh within Austin Landing it's uh the the<br>north neighborhood of West uh West<br>Boston um it's the Enterprise research<br>campus is really about revitalizing a<br>former um industrial Rail Yard into a<br>green pedestrian friendly uh hub for<br>creativity exploration and research uh<br>that Harvard will use as that interface<br>with their own business school and the<br>campus contains a conference center and<br>a research lab by gang Studio a research<br>lab by Henning Larson and housing with<br>25% affordable housing which VR DV is<br>doing and then a hotel uh that we're<br>working on which anchors the northwest<br>corner of the site it's a 240 room uh<br>lifestyle Hotel uh and a 16-story mixed<br>juuse uh Tower and then the ground floor<br>features like restaurants and local<br>retail and cafes and they sort of begins<br>to outline the edge of the campus and<br>Frames the entrance to a green way that<br>goes uh all the way from one side of the<br>community through this development to<br>the Charles River that's a Escape<br>landscape architecture doing that so you<br>can uh begin to see where we're located<br>in the kind of the the red outline uh<br>here the Green Way how it interfaces uh<br>and then outlined in red is is the hotel<br>that we're currently working on so what<br>we were presented in the master plan<br>which had already been done was this<br>massing of the tail of the of the Tower<br>and tables type scheme and what we felt<br>was very strong along Western a facing<br>north was to establish a greater degree<br>of front frontality so we sort of<br>aligned the base and the tower together<br>to make a more singular figure then<br>activate the ground floor with a varied<br>programming that we were after uh and<br>then shaped it to the skyline and the<br>context so by these projections towards<br>the skyline of Boston or porches towards<br>the community of olon or as a Gateway<br>into the laneway U these are places<br>people could hang out in the shade and<br>such or have these sort of vantages uh<br>Beyond and then really enhance the<br>streets with some really fantastic<br>Landscaping uh so when we got this we<br>really thought of this as a as a type of<br>still life of these series of buildings<br>the conference center and labs and<br>housing but we wanted to take place of<br>you know have a place in that but also<br>think of what we're doing as more of a<br>portrait in the still life and so that's<br>kind of this a very shrink wrapped uh<br>figure and its frontality was uh I think<br>very important and then how it sets up<br>those views to the different aspects of<br>the site both near and<br>far and so here's here's that figure and<br>then the material Logics are very simple<br>three sides of a a curve slightly<br>scalloped uh lusterous metal cladding<br>system and then the north side a shrink<br>wrapped uh glass uh curtain wall system<br>with uh reverse reveals uh in that so<br>rather than MO moans you get<br>reveals uh and and this is it here or at<br>least renderings it's currently under<br>construction I don't have a lot of<br>construction photos of it even though<br>it's topped out but you get the sense of<br>the idea of this different sort of<br>projections that and the type of cleave<br>spaces they make the way in which uh the<br>streetcape is made articulated along the<br>lobby area of the uh of the uh of the<br>hotel as well as the the different local<br>retail<br>and then how that all kind of works<br>together to create these sort of<br>different uh Community rooms along the<br>street street rooms is what we're<br>calling them and then you see the<br>slightly scalloped how that'll create<br>this sort of Shadow play in the<br>articulation and then again once again<br>one to one mockups these are all the<br>mockups for the different buildings so<br>they create a a pallet uh between uh<br>between the different uh buildings all<br>done by different firms uh but trying to<br>get those to work together that was<br>something the<br>developer insisted one so you get a kind<br>of sense of it here how that all comes<br>together and this will be completed the<br>end of next year uh and looking forward<br>to that coming together and part of the<br>idea was to the life of the building on<br>the North side is sort of transparent<br>and exposed so you can imagine all the<br>different lights and curtains and all of<br>that for uh the guest of the hotel<br>really activating uh that<br>facade<br>so one of the things that we're<br>constantly trying to think about is how<br>we take the ordinary and Elevate that or<br>how we take the everyday and enrich it<br>uh and enhance it uh for those that kind<br>of engage it so we've got to calling<br>that ennobling the praic and often times<br>that's just taking an ordinary system<br>construction system and<br>recontextualizing it in this case the<br>quanset Hut and I I have to say some of<br>the most beautiful I guess they're not<br>really Quan it's because they don't have<br>the huge corgs but these kind of barns<br>that I kept seeing in the landscape were<br>are absolutely stunning the sort of<br>barrel vaed uh barns I don't know what<br>you call those here in New Zealand but<br>they're quite stunning anyways here's<br>our version so this is the Quant you see<br>this a lot in the US usually it's a<br>singular figure out in an agricultural<br>landscape light industrial you might<br>find somebody living in them but that's<br>typically how you find them we were<br>challenged by a developer from Detroit<br>who had begun using these for affordable<br>kind of developments housing<br>developments to develop a mixed juice uh<br>development in Fort Worth Texas in an<br>emerging neighborhood Magnolia Village<br>one of these uh neighborhoods that's<br>sort of coming online um and so and we<br>had to use the quanset Hut so this is<br>what we came up with uh and it's a<br>series of living units uh on the second<br>uh floor at the base of that are work uh<br>offices that can be combined their<br>singular small offices for small<br>businesses but can combined for larger<br>businesses restaurant grab and go and uh<br>a coffee shop and Bookshop together all<br>connected by a public Plaza so it's a<br>private public interface so rather than<br>max out every square inch of the lot the<br>developer really wanted to create uh<br>something that had more of a<br>neighborhood Vibe uh uh and and more of<br>a a public Vibe so we're only at mile<br>and a half from a very famous Museum<br>there by done by this guy named Lou KH<br>um and uh of course we were inspired by<br>that we thought well here's an<br>opportunity to be inspired by something<br>that's truly Noble and now we can take<br>the praic and Elevate that and what we<br>didn't realize that Khan had been<br>looking at the local Stockyards when he<br>was developing his scheme for uh for the<br>Kimble so anyways great minds think aik<br>we all are trying to return to Origins<br>anyways or to our Inspirations to the<br>idea of precedent and continue uh uh the<br>project forward um so anyways and these<br>are very simple they're all<br>pre-manufactured they go up in about a<br>day and a half the Huts do we call them<br>the Huts uh once you have the base in<br>place everything uh ready to be anchored<br>down and then we infill those uh with<br>the space glass on either end you don't<br>cut through those because it compromises<br>the structure but we wanted a cohesive<br>language or vocabulary for all of the<br>buildings including the one-story<br>buildings along the street so what we<br>did is we flipped the huts on their side<br>and made them into cladding and that<br>gave us a lot of opportunity to resolve<br>all the transition details and how you<br>cut elements and windows and doors and<br>things like that into it so this is a<br>this sort of uh local uh call the Spiral<br>Diner vegan restaurant here and then we<br>kind of take those Huts also coat them<br>in a plaster these become uh seeding<br>carols on the inside of the restaurant<br>here uh here we take a window and kind<br>of extend it from the corner and that<br>window lights up at night this is<br>actually a view into the kitchen so you<br>see people making food uh before you go<br>into the into the restaurant uh and then<br>a public Plaza made out of recycled<br>Stone uh this is done by a dirt or Julie<br>bargman of dirt uh who who makes a great<br>Landscapes just using whatever is<br>available uh and she just two trees a<br>pond Cyprus and a regular Cypress most<br>Landscape Architects I notice use these<br>cypresses like edges or walls she uses<br>them like jazz notes to make space and I<br>think a vol eventually these things are<br>planted so close to the building I don't<br>know if she likes the buildings or not<br>she just wants it to grow into a forest<br>so we have this idea she said it's a<br>machine in the garden machine in the<br>garden I like okay um but you can begin<br>to see this street Edge this Urban<br>Street Edge they allowed the landscape<br>to leak out onto the public Street<br>sidewalks I really fantastic uh but the<br>you know here's some corrugation for you<br>and then how you make Windows how you<br>kind of create these uh very simple<br>improvised details uh to make this uh<br>feel like a whole system along the<br>alleyway in the back of course everybody<br>gets a porch here both uh the workers uh<br>work folks and as well as the people<br>living it's tough neighborhood but we<br>even shave the trees to look like the<br>the Huts so uh anyways trying to get it<br>all worked<br>together in the inside side is very<br>simple it's just a simple service core<br>uh made out of birch plywood you have<br>your bathroom your bedroom uh uh your<br>kitchen all in that and then the rest of<br>it just a big simple vaulted space a<br>two-story<br>space the interstitial spaces between<br>the buildings are also activated and<br>used as well so they're it's all public<br>space it's really point and now the<br>neighborhood is beginning to emesh<br>itself into this uh development so<br>barber shop shops are cropping up uh<br>small donut shop just little things that<br>the neighborhood is you know kind of uh<br>engaging uh with this development so<br>when you invite the public in I think<br>good things happen in these private<br>developments and then our our rear<br>window moment here where we got<br>everybody to lift the shades up and take<br>this one shot it probably never happened<br>again but U thought that was a great<br>moment so something relatively simple uh<br>a<br>manifestation right of a prosaic<br>system in a new<br>way we've also been looking at how one<br>manifests local culture as a shaper uh<br>you know in terms of like public life or<br>certain focuses uh in in a community uh<br>that would shape a building in some ways<br>so Bentonville Arkansas where Crystal<br>Bridges as located is considered the<br>mountain bike capital of uh the us at<br>this time and so we were asked to do a<br>co-office uh building 200,000 Square ft<br>uh we're working with we work at the<br>time and their design team which is<br>Michelle roskin uh christien Callahan<br>heruka Ruchi uh James Slade uh Adrian<br>Yao and others uh as part of that team<br>in collaboration with us as well and<br>this was a the first the world's first<br>bikable building is what we like to call<br>it um<br>and it's uh you can basically bite to<br>your office on the sixth floor um and<br>and so it was a way of thinking about<br>public space and how we can extend that<br>uh across the face of a building and<br>into these uh different plazas up or<br>teres up above so again the public<br>inscribes itself in the exteriority as<br>well as an opportunity to participate in<br>the interior uh kind of co-office<br>environment co-working environment um<br>now we work as you know imp ploted<br>uh during the uh uh uh Co and for a host<br>of other Bad Business decisions um and<br>so Michelle rosin uh he who heading up<br>the architecture Department of we were<br>and his team were let go uh and so they<br>sort of just formed their own entity<br>they had their own firms and we just all<br>contined to work together to see the<br>project through um and and still<br>maintain the sort of sort of the the<br>vibe and the aspirations for this uh Co<br>co- office environment but it's very<br>simple it's primarily just uh copper and<br>glass uh very transparent and then you<br>uh basically we cut a hole through it a<br>another dog Trot to connect to the city<br>park uh from the sidewalk in the front<br>and then that's where you begin to get<br>onto the these very gently sloping<br>ramps and here you gu said we go up the<br>interior in or the exterior describes<br>itself in the interior so you always<br>have that interface of activity Mobility<br>happening with uh also what's happening<br>in the offices and these sort of<br>contingent spaces for collaboration and<br>for for work you wrap yourself around uh<br>here and then these places for pause to<br>hang out and linger in these different<br>Terraces parking garage we did as well<br>with uh giant public art uh on<br>it you kind of get the sense of it the<br>ramp is 3/4 of a mile long it's the same<br>distance that this building is from the<br>local Town Square about four blocks away<br>uh so great way to get your 10,000 steps<br>in<br>they and this I this massing this<br>stepping this kind of zigzagging of the<br>ramps created a really interesting<br>massing opportunity where you take a<br>six-story building which is the largest<br>building in this small town of 50,000<br>people and you scale it back so where it<br>interfaces at the street level it feels<br>like a one or twostory building uh and I<br>think that was something that was really<br>successful uh in a kind of situation<br>where 1 plus 1 equals 5 we began to<br>solve the walkability and bikeability of<br>the building but we're also solving for<br>its massing and its relationship to the<br>local context again the lobby and these<br>Community spaces people coffee shops and<br>uh different uh retail program inside<br>and then you know always the presence of<br>mobility and folks moving through and<br>having this sort of exchange from<br>outside to inside and in<br>Reverse but it really is in in many ways<br>a manifestation of the local culture uh<br>in the physicality uh of the<br>architecture itself uh and and I again a<br>kind of rethinking of public space you<br>can see at the very top here the the<br>Grand Terrace and you're overlooking the<br>Town Square from there great place for a<br>sunset<br>so I'm going to end with this last<br>project here and I appreciate your time<br>been talking as fast as I can which is<br>hard to do from somebody from the south<br>so I'm I'm I'm I'm I'm I'm I'm trying I<br>can't talk as fast as Jeremy but I'm<br>working on it so we do schools we like<br>doing schools schools uh in the US are<br>probably the most impoverished building<br>type that we have they either don't do<br>enough or they do way too much uh and<br>it's never particularly good uh so we<br>had a great opportunity to work on an<br>Independent School a maker School 6th<br>through 12th grade in Bentonville<br>Arkansas inspired uh by this woman here<br>you may not recognize her but I'm sure<br>you've heard of Amelia<br>arhart uh this is Louise thaden she was<br>a Pioneer in aviation she was a<br>contemporary of Louise of Amilia aart uh<br>she won the Bendix cross country air<br>race several times her and Amia aart<br>entered uh in opposition by men that<br>said you can't enter and they entered<br>anyway they beat the men and the women<br>um and anyway she was born in<br>Bentonville<br>Arkansas uh she grew up learning how to<br>fly through Barnes she was a barn<br>Stormer with her plane um and then moved<br>on to uh California and then to<br>Kittyhawk uh where she continued to<br>develop her Aviation career she's the<br>Muse for this school the a Pioneer uh<br>and the school is really about having<br>roots and wings but understanding your<br>place and the local and being part of<br>the community but developing uh<br>aspirations and capacity to move well<br>beyond to go anywhere you want to go uh<br>and it's called the thaden school um and<br>it has an index tuition so it means<br>anybody can go that wants to go to the<br>school so it's all tied to your family<br>income so some students pay $500 a year<br>some pay $25,000 a year to go<br>here now it has three signature programs<br>which were dreamed up by this Visionary<br>Headmaster Clayton Marsh Wheels reels<br>and meals so every student gets a bike<br>when they become a student here and they<br>learn how to work on the bike they learn<br>how to fabricate bikes they learn how uh<br>the whole about biking culture so forth<br>uh the building I just showed you is<br>only a block away so they get some<br>exercise on that um reels every student<br>learns how to tell stories using<br>animation and film and then meals each<br>student they learn how to farm they they<br>have productive Landscapes they learn<br>how to uh uh grow food how to harvest<br>food how to prepare food teaching<br>kitchens and a host of other things that<br>deal with food and the campus is a 30<br>acre Campus located about eight blocks<br>from the Town Square now it is not Urban<br>we in these small towns like this we<br>call it Urban pastoral uh because most<br>often were former uh agricultural land<br>this was a used to be a farm and then<br>became the high school at the turn of<br>the last century uh which uh Lis thaden<br>went to and then was the county fair uh<br>grounds before it became uh the school<br>and so the way in which we thought about<br>the master planning working with es<br>dumes Ripple our partners who did the<br>Home Building as well as Andrew pogon<br>our Landscape Architects we didn't look<br>at uh you know uh Colin row or somebody<br>like that we were looking at local Farm<br>groupings chicken houses and look<br>understanding how uh folks local folks<br>would lay things out to create uh<br>groupings or just how to solve for the<br>sun with these linear buildings so where<br>the East and the West are very narrow<br>right and they control that by or them<br>East West that way these are all chicken<br>farms we have a lot of chicken farms<br>where I'm at so when you oriented East<br>Nest East West you can control the sun<br>right so chickens don't cook before<br>their time so so and then the whole<br>concept of of of the landscape is<br>layering by Design the the the variable<br>Landscapes with indigenous planting<br>thinking about circulation there are no<br>canopies nobody's protected from the<br>rain or snow you just got to get out and<br>you walk the campus there's no security<br>fence around this campus it's all part<br>of the community uh the whole water<br>management becomes a learning tool for<br>them they have a water lab and they<br>manage all their water uh they have all<br>these different terrains here which are<br>Outdoor Learning spaces and part of the<br>programming you see in the red uh of how<br>that's so the spaces between are as<br>important as the buildings themselves<br>and it's all located around a community<br>uh uh geothermal Wells and so very very<br>thoughtful that also are is a dactic<br>landscape where you really think of this<br>campus is one big classroom and this is<br>what we came up with in a simple series<br>of vacular inspired buildings uh using<br>the same kind of metal system we've used<br>before with custom muscle car uh car<br>paints and then uh an Allwood building<br>you see in the silver building here the<br>home building that s DZ did and in the<br>Allwood building in our bike bar but<br>I'll kind kind of blow through these<br>real<br>quickly so the reels building it uses a<br>simple pitch and roll uh operation in<br>the roof to create variable scale and<br>dissimilarity between the different<br>rooms rather than think of uh equality<br>you know the systemic way which most<br>schools are arranged where everybody<br>gets the same thing the same classroom<br>mind-numbingly instrumental in its<br>effect um here we're looking at every<br>room being different classroom<br>administrative room arts and human I<br>ities all through this folding and then<br>through that folding it allows us to<br>kind of uh open up the roof for<br>daylighting down into the middle uh and<br>then it this popping up where the uh<br>Consulting rooms are and the counselor<br>and the director's office here creates a<br>great facade uh for the film department<br>where they project their films onto it<br>so this actually becomes part of the<br>bville film festival and this is a<br>Community Lawn that uh people come and<br>uh you know view view these uh films uh<br>as well that students are making um the<br>other thing this kind of Nature Made<br>culture made idea we wanted a unique<br>kind of uh uh bio philic uh paint uh to<br>work with the indigenous ozar prairie<br>grasses as well as I don't know our<br>favorite car 67 Shelby GT Cobra uh green<br>gold so mixing in gold metal flake and<br>such and kind of getting these colors to<br>work just right to be this one-of-a-kind<br>green gold color for the reels building<br>and then that all begins to fuse very<br>well with the landscape uh over again<br>this idea of uh creating architecture<br>imbued with the order of change uh and<br>it's it's really resonates uh with the<br>various plantings on the<br>campus and then cutting through these<br>linear buildings with uh breezeways kind<br>of cross axes uh here so these are<br>places for uh transition but also<br>they're basically outdoor class rooms<br>they're lit from above a very simple<br>pallet to go with the metal panels<br>plywood ceilings and F FRC panels so<br>very very simple economical pallet and<br>again just moving through these spaces<br>but also teaching going on there uh the<br>most social space which are the hallways<br>circulation spaces and here daylighting<br>is brought into it every uh classroom<br>has its own section that's different and<br>its own immediate connection to the<br>outside uh as well and that way we can<br>also scale uh the building relative to<br>its context so as this building<br>approaches the boulevard which is only<br>about 30 40 ft away it scales to that we<br>interject a brolay that works for light<br>and sound on the West Side creates a a<br>great space for this uh that student<br>lounge and study<br>area and then flipping back on the other<br>side of campus with the sister building<br>of the reels the wheels building which<br>has the fabrication Labs the bike shop<br>uh the wood shop uh all these project<br>Labs uh we developed an interface with a<br>a porch a screen uh that breaks down the<br>Western Sun but also creates a place for<br>students to bring uh their tools out<br>onto the sidewalk they have a service<br>engagement program for citizens working<br>on their bikes uh so that's that kind of<br>begins to show that this is all along<br>Main Street so we're thinking about how<br>we build a Main Street on the south side<br>of the productive Landscapes here where<br>students learn to uh uh grow food and<br>harvest food<br>uh and again the green kind of works<br>quite well with that and then the<br>project Labs both in the classrooms but<br>even in the in the hallways there there<br>never just for one one role or one<br>activity it's in this case it widens out<br>and becomes project Labs collaboration<br>projects and then the the the columns<br>become rettin in which the products or<br>outcomes of those collaborations are<br>featured<br>in and then the bike shop with their<br>whole bike program<br>uh where they learn to repair bikes<br>fabricate bikes all aspects of biking<br>culture and then the adjacent building<br>uh is really the the theatrical building<br>the the performance building for in<br>music drama uh and it comes with a 300t<br>long uh loia with an urban Edge City<br>this this is really designed while I was<br>at the American Academy in Rome so a<br>little bit of uh Rome kind of creeped in<br>there but it's basically an open Plaza<br>on the corner rather than putting the<br>building on the corner um uh so it<br>captures that again the public nature of<br>this for uh pedestrians for uh bikers<br>and kind of a big deal in a small town<br>to have uh an urban uh Urban<br>Furniture uh and then the uh not to be<br>outdone by the other buildings we have a<br>a gold green uh 71 Camaro uh that we<br>used here to develop this whole pallet<br>uh for the clading on the performance<br>center along with its googly eye uh<br>window into the auditorium so the stage<br>is at the ground level so students in<br>the wood shop across in the wheels<br>building make sets they roll them across<br>uh the campus there and right onto the<br>stage uh The Rake of the of the uh<br>seating is reflected in the kind of uh<br>section as well as profile uh of the of<br>the elevation the outside uh and there's<br>no Lobby for this building the porch is<br>the lobby so again it and it's also<br>shared with the community so the<br>different types of activities are both<br>the school and the community uh and then<br>the practice areas the entry as you slip<br>in on the right you slip actually into<br>the<br>auditorium very discreet way and then<br>it's all articulated in local Red Oak uh<br>plywood panels uh exception of one<br>window Monumental window we wanted that<br>connection to Nature still a classroom<br>uh so rather than the hard uh planes of<br>the wood the hard edges of the wood this<br>is all hand Tri uh plaster soft and<br>curving bending the light and Shadow uh<br>into the space to kind a kind of a nice<br>uh Oculus let so to speak a rocus maybe<br>uh to the outside so it's a figure on<br>the inside and a figure on the outside<br>here uh a kind of figure figure uh<br>element spatial proposition that we like<br>to IMB in these these different elements<br>and acts as a great backdrop to all the<br>activities happening um in the landscape<br>the big classroom so the last building I<br>want to share with you uh the school the<br>in in the kind of for their namesake<br>Louis thaden they were called the barn<br>stormers and their mascots an<br>owl uh so they wanted a barn they wanted<br>a barn for their gym and the Headmaster<br>didn't want any Barn he said I want a<br>real Barn like one that has self<br>ventilating and breathes on its own and<br>all of that so we basically gave them<br>our version of an Ozark traditional<br>Ozark Barn I did warn him that I had<br>been working in this for about 30 years<br>and finally the commission landed in our<br>lap um so it breathes through its skin<br>all those gaps in the boards there<br>copper screen behind that keep insects<br>out but for the most part it's all<br>self-ventilating<br>uh it is situated along the soccer field<br>and a bike pump track it's called The<br>Bike Barn so bike's a big deal here so<br>you can see how that works a public bike<br>uh pump track and then we have these<br>really great ventilating Dormers uh that<br>pop open and create a chimney effect for<br>the uh the breezes from the West coming<br>up uh to the<br>east uh and then a wonderful porch<br>people to hang out on uh as well take a<br>break from biking um this really tells<br>the story uh so you see the trace in the<br>trusses of the traditional Gamel uh<br>Ozark barn and then how we expanded<br>those trusses to capture uh the porch to<br>capture the mezzanine to capture the<br>Dormers uh you know University of<br>Arkansas is one of the leaders in uh<br>Mass Timber uh research uh in in the<br>country in the US and so I know my Dean<br>Peter mcki was like man everything has<br>to be Mass Timber now which well we<br>didn't have the money for Mass Timber so<br>we had what we did is we used a mass of<br>Timber uh instead so local trust<br>manufacturers and flitch plates and kind<br>of put all that together and just just<br>cross the state line in in uh Oklahoma<br>so there's residential trust<br>manufacturers we just kind of ganged<br>everything together to make our own uh<br>again uh Mass Timber uh and then really<br>thinking about how we would this system<br>of articulation how that would transfer<br>to the rails into this uh cladding for<br>the stair here so basically we try to<br>think like a farmer uh and basically<br>take 2x4s and cut them diagonally rotate<br>them and back screw them uh with very<br>little to no waste uh and just trying to<br>think what what would a farmer do just<br>using what they had locally off the<br>shelf here you be going to see that the<br>level of craft uh everything is uh we<br>like to call natz ass uh in the in the<br>Precision of the construction and then<br>our lighting designer came up with this<br>idea so we have this it's opaque during<br>the day but as the sun sets the lights<br>slowly come<br>on uh and and becomes somewhat<br>translucent and then as the sun drops<br>Over the Horizon it becomes somewhat<br>transparent and again uh becoming uh in<br>many ways uh a beacon uh for the school<br>but an icon uh for the<br>community uh and so with that I I'm just<br>going to leave you with a few thoughts<br>and then I'll I'll<br>stop um and I hope you appreciate my<br>insistence on the material the spatial<br>the tactial the geographical the<br>illuminated and the cultural and how<br>they're bound together by an ambitious<br>ethos for proposing meaningful<br>purposeful intimate places for people of<br>all walks of life to live their lives<br>with meaning and purpose so how should<br>we assess a society perhaps best by<br>society's care for its children for its<br>elderly for the less Advantage by its<br>Equitable provision of a full quality of<br>life to all all and thus at least in<br>part by its architecture by its Humane<br>social<br>art perhaps how should we assess the<br>practice of architecture in that<br>Society probably best by its cultivation<br>of literacy of Education of Civic<br>Gathering of individual and Collective<br>worship of physical and mental<br>well-being and thus ultimately by the<br>demonstrated built commitment to<br>architecture as a Humane social practice<br>this is the fundamental and radical<br>proposition we're making thank you</p></main><footer style="margin-top: 2rem; background: #0001; padding: 2rem; text-align: center;"><p>We Are The University</p><ul style="list-style-type:
