got a<br>team behind the scenes and they'll be<br>feeding through those questions and<br>hopefully we've got enough time to<br>answer them towards the end of the<br>webinar okay so running through the<br>agenda as you can see we're going to<br>start off with a global snapshot then<br>talk about New Zealand denan where the<br>University of aago is located we'll then<br>Deep dive into R's alumni Story how a<br>Tagle prepares you for your future<br>career we'll have time for a panel<br>discussion and then hopefully wrap it up<br>with some Q so moving on to section one<br>and a global snapshot so we're going to<br>pass this over to ionne who can speak to<br>the mega trends of<br>careers well these are um some really<br>good trends that are shaping uh where<br>careers and where jobs are going to be<br>for the future so you know just really<br>realizing that um especially with the<br>Advent of AI and machine learning that<br>that's making some you know some really<br>big shifts and um the way we work and<br>the types of jobs that are going to be<br>yourself um and yeah it's really good to<br>understand your own values and know what<br>it is that you know is really driving<br>you with your career um and I think the<br>sustainable goals um are helpful for<br>that if you can think about which area<br>do you want to help in um then that can<br>guide you with what you're doing and<br>what you're wanting to achieve who's<br>done that born we're having a chat with<br>the career development team<br>earlier and traditionally I've always<br>asked what career outcome do you want is<br>is that changing now well I think people<br>need to think about it changing you know<br>so um for instance you know like just<br>x-rays um instead of a human looking at<br>them now ai is looking at them um being<br>faster and quicker and you know so you<br>you really need to think about the<br>future Trends um so that yeah you're not<br>just Skilling yourself up for the right<br>here and now it's also thinking about<br>the future so um the key word in there<br>is skills and and and also I think it's<br>a really important thing to understand<br>how you learn how you learn quickly and<br>effectively<br>good so going on to the distinct<br>elements of talents is this where the<br>skills come into play it is exactly and<br>um you know there's obviously why a lot<br>of people come to University for those<br>cognitive skills and it's really<br>important for universities to teach<br>people to be critical thinkers um but<br>when you're not just learning content<br>when you're thinking about what you're<br>learning and you're learning to<br>communicate that you're learning to work<br>with other people to understand that you<br>know you might even just be um planning<br>um how you do your work um they are<br>transferable skills um that you can um<br>you know take with you as you go um you<br>know always I think um employers look<br>for uh graduates who have established<br>some sort of leadership skills um you<br>know these are the people that people<br>will expect to lead people in the future<br>um and you know what something as AI<br>doesn't quite get us yet um maybe it<br>will but it's those interpersonal skills<br>um up in the corner that are hugely<br>important to um build that this is often<br>what makes a real big difference to<br>employers how can you communicate how<br>can you build relationships with people<br>um and you know just mentioning Ai and<br>those digital skills um you've really<br>got to um keep yourself up to date with<br>um<br>yeah digital literacy um yeah software<br>um and understanding those sorts of<br>systems kind of like it too with like<br>under self leadership and you've got<br>courage and risk taking which anyone<br>that's wanting to study overseas that's<br>you are you can put that in a cover<br>letter you know I was courageous and<br>risk taking of actually leaving my<br>country coming to study and see where it<br>takes me yeah for sure and in the<br>startup space and you work with the<br>students you see similar skills and and<br>Trends emerging there definitely it's<br>especially in the kind of cognitive<br>interpersonal and self leadership you<br>kind of need a combination of all of<br>those things when you're taking a<br>project out into the world or when<br>you're looking at can I make money from<br>this or can I create a not for-profit<br>that's self- sustaining from this um and<br>like through testing one of your<br>ideas you get to um give real a lot of<br>evidence behind it when you're going for<br>jobs and things um awesome so all round<br>brilliant things so again talking to<br>those reskilling needs and we've already<br>alluded to this that um AI is is going<br>to be a game changer and it is a<br>disruptor but how do we look forward in<br>the future so that just gives you some<br>reskilling needs there in the next five<br>years so it's an exciting time to be<br>around lots of change um and and it's<br>adapting to that change and that's a<br>great thing the university and what<br>we're talking about today can can help<br>guide you there so going now more into<br>what can New Zealand All For You um a<br>little bit of a snapshot here um I think<br>as a smaller country sometimes we're<br>often overlooked about what career<br>opportunities are available being a<br>population of 5 million but we've got<br>some great um opportunities within this<br>country and as you can see from around<br>the room um few of us are migrants few<br>of us are are and new zealanders and and<br>we've chosen to live in this fabulous<br>little part of the world so looking at<br>our top 10 Industries um you can see<br>this professional scientific and<br>Technical Services I'm not going to go<br>through all of them but it gives you an<br>indication in size of our GDP um of our<br>country and where our New Zealand<br>sectors of strengths are so this is our<br>growth opportunities so um renewable<br>energies not many people know that we<br>have a commercial rocket launching um<br>station in New Zealand called Rocket lab<br>it's doing some fantastic things big in<br>the take and Innovation space tourism is<br>a key part of our GDP and moving forward<br>as well as food and beverage Innovation<br>as well so a lot I think in the past<br>people have thought of us is purely<br>being agricultural maybe and they see<br>pictures of mountains and pictures of<br>sheep and farming but we go really into<br>that take space and how we all join<br>everything together so some great<br>opportunities and the deoe master of<br>growth index so this is um something<br>that is launched every year and it's<br>actually coming out this month later on<br>2024 it just gives you an idea of the<br>scale of where our fastest growing<br>companies are and delighted to say<br>number 15 on the list last year um is<br>education perfect which is perfect<br>because that is who Ria is working for<br>and um she'll be able to talk a little<br>bit more about that but you can see the<br>bread of um area is that these companies<br>are in and there's there'll be names you<br>won't recognize a lot of the time this<br>isn't your big F it's not your pwc's or<br>your Ms your multinationals this is New<br>Zealand companies who are going global<br>and we've got some great um examples of<br>that we'll talk about today so what New<br>Zealand's employers are looking for and<br>we've just pulled and highlighted some<br>of the skills so really talking to um<br>ion and the skills that you were talking<br>about earlier on and being analytical<br>excellent time management skills<br>communication skills and that is all<br>taught within University and<br>extracurricular activities that you can<br>do here so um just a nice little<br>snapshot our largest job um website<br>seek. co.nz if you want to have a filter<br>through that you can get a feel for what<br>employers are looking for in New Zealand<br>and again you can see some examples<br>there are What in<br>so then moving on to our fabulous City<br>and our city of core strength so we are<br>located in this a lower part of the<br>South Island if and you're not familiar<br>where we are in New Zealand our core<br>sectors of strength in denan<br>specifically our education which um<br>obviously being a University City we are<br>one of but also Ria can talk to that<br>with education perfect and what comes<br>out of that tourism Healthcare and<br>social assistance but really where our<br>growth area are are within that<br>professional scientific Services H for<br>startup and Innovation and that's why we<br>have Grace here from startup Den who can<br>tell you some of the amazing stories<br>that have come out of their and careers<br>as well as companies and where the<br>sectors really are to watch as being a<br>Medical University is that blend between<br>health and Tech right um we've got quite<br>a few companies that have come out of<br>that off the top of your head can you<br>name a couple<br>um<br>Technologies and bless Bless yeah uh<br>zest<br>um SP and they just to name a few so<br>moretin so there's within our small City<br>we have those companies coming out and<br>another one is game development so we a<br>city of digital excellence and there's<br>been a lot of investment Within code as<br>it's nicknamed and that's now gone<br>throughout New Zealand so game<br>development is a big part and<br>contributes to our economy as well as<br>globally so moving on to the fact that<br>we are startup Hub and we'll get Grace<br>to have a bit of a chat about startup<br>denan yeah so denan is a great place to<br>test out kind of entrepreneurial skills<br>and things and um denina is actually one<br>of the few places in New Zealand that<br>had as a startup Hub um and startup<br>support for students going through your<br>academic um work so what we do is we<br>help people to drisk their ideas and to<br>encourage the entrepreneurial mindset so<br>you don't need to be running a huge<br>business to have an entrepreneurial<br>mindset and it's about how do you learn<br>these skills that are going to benefit<br>you in multiple careers whether that's<br>taking to your local sports club or your<br>church or whether it's starting a not<br>for-profit or starting a business or<br>going into an existing career um so is<br>this opportunity open just to business<br>students or can this be anybody it is<br>absolutely anyone and anyone that's<br>based in denan so even if you're not<br>studying um we do have one program<br>that's specifically for students at the<br>University and the poly Technic which<br>takes you through how do you start a<br>business it starts with a problem so if<br>you have something that really annoys<br>you come on in and we will help you<br>solve that um and so audacious is a<br>really great um program to kind of add<br>in as an extra to your work um there's<br>no deadlines except for the very last<br>one and you get really Hands-On support<br>to help you through those steps um the<br>blessing at start denan and denan in<br>general is that denan is really um<br>connected as a city and so it's really<br>easy to say hey I'm really interested in<br>spinning out the science research who<br>would I talk to and we can very quickly<br>connect you um if you want to do<br>something with the ad toy or the Arts<br>group of our Council we can easily<br>connect you there and so it's super easy<br>to come in and get<br>networked um and an example is we talked<br>about rocket Labs just earlier um back<br>in the day when I was working on a<br>project I actually went up to rocker<br>labs and got to meet the<br>CEO that's to see was pretty awesome um<br>and so it's just such a great place to<br>get connected and know the right people<br>who know the right people outside of<br>that yeah so it's not even within Den<br>then right like you can get connected<br>out with the city and I like the idea<br>too that it's not just for students as<br>well so it's like even say International<br>students who bring their Partners they<br>could even come and see you at startup<br>and and get that advice as well as<br>Career Development Center which is<br>really lovely as well so we're there for<br>the whole international student<br>Community yeah and it's really easy to<br>get also connected into National<br>programs so there are a few Nationwide<br>um startup hubs that run big programs we<br>can try and get you into those ones or<br>make the connections where they're<br>needed um awesome so basically come here<br>make sure you go down to Startup D and<br>you're going to end up being connected<br>with whatever field that you're really<br>interested in fantastic so um Grace<br>touch on the programs there did you want<br>to talk a little bit about the free<br>meetings and the the distiller yeah so<br>we have anyone that's based into can<br>come in for a free meeting with us for<br>15 minutes so what we do is kind of talk<br>about what might you want to do next<br>what resources can we give you to help<br>you to drisk your business and who might<br>me who might we want to connect you with<br>we then have audacious which I talked<br>about previously which is for tertiary<br>students um and we take you through the<br>steps then we have the distiller<br>incubator which is for highs scale high<br>growth companies to come in and you get<br>one-on-one coaching um<br>and kind of connec in with the local<br>ecosystem um but the best way book a<br>free meeting or join audacious next year<br>so is there a charge for students to<br>join audacious no so everything we do is<br>for free so we've got some awesome<br>sponsors um the city council the<br>University of otago um and the poly Tech<br>here um they are all awesome and let us<br>keep doing what we do um for free for<br>everyone so can I just I just want to<br>just reiterate so I'm a science student<br>I'm working on bio engineering I've got<br>some research and out of that comes an<br>idea that I think I can I can<br>commercialize after I've graduated I can<br>come and see you you can come and see us<br>and the blessing is that as long as<br>you're not working off your lecturers<br>research um and in most cases students<br>own their own IP so we would look at how<br>do we protect it who might we connect<br>you with Soo Innovation might be a<br>natural Next Step as well um and figure<br>out cool how do I look at the market who<br>would be the potential customers what<br>are my Pathways um and it really comes<br>down to your goals and Ambitions as to<br>which pathway you want to go after but a<br>lot of this it isn't just for people<br>wanting to start their own business<br>right like this is a skill set that you<br>could take into an existing business<br>yeah so we have a real mix of people and<br>so it comes from across the university<br>and across really different areas so we<br>um tend to get a lot of like food trucks<br>and things but we also get people that<br>are doing disease outbreaks and Cattle<br>um so we get a huge range um and it's<br>all about kind of connecting the dots<br>the principles are the same um but even<br>if you want to come in and just make<br>yourself get some skills that will make<br>you more employable that is an awesome<br>pathway as well it's just about building<br>the capability of everyone and ideally<br>everyone will get a job in denen um<br>because we want to keep you here because<br>it's<br>awesome fantastic and that then is a<br>great slide that talks to where startup<br>Den is within denan but also all the<br>external yeah and we denan operates on<br>an open door policy so or no wrong door<br>so if you were to go to code which we<br>talked about earlier and you're building<br>a startup they might direct you to start<br>up needen if you come into us or<br>business South and you need support we<br>will link you straight away to the right<br>people no one's going to close your door<br>um um that's the blessing of denan is<br>everyone is friendly down here um and<br>there's kind of no wrong way to approach<br>it and there's a lot of free support out<br>there so um it's awesome<br>fantastic okay so you've heard a bit<br>about startup den and now we're going to<br>um Deep dive into Ria um who was a<br>master Finance student at a tago and now<br>working for Education perfect um Denine<br>tends to work on um 0.5 degrees of<br>separation and connection New Zealand's<br>about connection um so I think there is<br>there a connection here well yes<br>actually two um I think my household at<br>this point is fully funded by startups<br>that started here so education perfect<br>is where I work and my partner works at<br>pocket Smith which is also a success<br>story so yeah two points of connection<br>there come to to start up to need got an<br>idea and then look at the awesome people<br>you can hire later on they and they<br>become so successful they need<br>employees you go so you came here um<br>give us a bit of your backstory um where<br>you were working prior to coming to New<br>Zealand and the degree and then yeah<br>what happened next um so I finished my<br>undergrad in India in in accounting and<br>I was working as an auditor with grand<br>Thor<br>um before I moved to New Zealand and I<br>was very sure I wanted to Branch out<br>into Finance which would broaden my<br>Spectrum but keep it within the same<br>industry so Finance was an easy choice<br>at that point and I was very particular<br>that the course needs to have a project<br>element and not just Theory so the<br>master's program was<br>perfect um yes so 12mon course I was<br>like plug in and get that big<br>um but obviously the end goal was to<br>come out with a job in hand and I think<br>the very first month I walked into the<br>doors there and got my sewe fixed<br>because obviously when you moveing<br>countries your CS are quite different<br>the the Indian approach to it versus the<br>New Zealand approach is quite different<br>so that was my first step in the process<br>and did a couple of mentorships and um<br>within the uni um got a part-time job<br>that sort of opened up a big set of<br>skills which you usually wouldn't get as<br>an auditor working with other people as<br>compared to excel<br>sheets and that brought me closer to<br>understanding what the needs of an<br>employer within New Zealand would be and<br>that sort of pushed me to align myself<br>to education perfects needs fantastic so<br>what opportunity did you get within the<br>University um so the disability Center<br>hosts um an opportunity where you can<br>mentor students teach them um you can<br>also be a writer for them when they're<br>doing exams or read questions to them<br>for their exam season so I picked up<br>tiny jobs like that during my off time<br>which was great I learned a lot um and<br>hopefully who I was mentoring learned B<br>too so yeah that's what I did most of<br>the time fantastic and adding to the CD<br>so again I think with questions we get<br>asked a lot what part-time jobs can can<br>you get while you're studying so there<br>is opportunity within um the university<br>itself with with lots of different skill<br>sets to bring in yeah yeah and if you're<br>lucky you could also just be assisting<br>your own Professor within the department<br>so it's a lot of opportunity yeah in New<br>Zealand you can work on campus but you<br>can also work off campus as an<br>international student because I know in<br>the US you can't do that cool yeah so I<br>guess take advantage take advantage<br>early yeah come and see the fabulous<br>ofor oh and that's great and now and<br>you've been with education perfect for<br>how long oh um three and a half years<br>now yeah fantastic and how's it been<br>with your time working there um it's<br>been a great learning curve obviously<br>it's it's a ever evolving industry and<br>everything's changing like you said AI<br>is coming in it's it's you know the next<br>big thing even in teaching so we as a<br>company have to align stuff and make<br>sure we're ahead of competition so so<br>much going on and so many different<br>roles in the last three and a half years<br>but it's been great fantastic and<br>education perfect just within Den or how<br>far is their reach uh we spread across<br>five or six countries so geographically<br>we're all over the world so it's we<br>might look like we placed our quarters<br>in denneen but we've got reaches<br>everywhere it's awesome to hear about<br>like a local story that has gone<br>from 5 10 years ago being a team of like<br>four to suddenly being a global company<br>um yeah there must be lots of employees<br>lots of<br>employees yeah doing pay your not<br>everybody and are they employing um<br>local students oh yeah we're always<br>opening up for more fresh talent coming<br>out of uni I mean the idea is like some<br>of our Tech interns always end up<br>getting permanent roles and they're the<br>ones who come up with like fresh ideas<br>because they have such a different<br>perspective of of looking at a problem<br>which is great<br>fantastic Good Times ahead so that leads<br>us on to well why would you study in New<br>Zealand yeah and I think that the<br>fabulous thing about New Zealand is that<br>um not only do you get worldclass<br>education but I think you've been<br>hearing from this panel discussion that<br>um you get a lot of there's that problem<br>solving and that creativity that comes<br>through not only uh when you're studying<br>in New Zealand but also um for this<br>graduate um attributes too um being a<br>research intensive University like oot<br>Taro uh there's a lot of international<br>collaboration um with other our partner<br>universities and also government<br>organizations to through through New<br>Zealand um and Shout Out look we're the<br>second best in the world and producing<br>graduates with problem solving skills so<br>why not exactly<br>right uh the principles of manaki Tanga<br>Grace you basically touched on this when<br>you said when um with denan and how it<br>is and startup denan that no door closes<br>every door opens and so manaki Tanga is<br>this this kindness and this support that<br>comes through in the in now basically<br>our values as being a New Zealander it<br>it does really set us apart from other<br>countries and I think that resonates<br>with International students when you<br>study here would you Ria yes say that<br>100% like I got into education perfect<br>with a very temporary job all I had to<br>do was raise my hand and say I need a<br>job it's there an opening and and my<br>then boss is kind enough to actually go<br>around and ask other teams that's how I<br>landed my job that's mon yeah and makes<br>you very proud New Zealand and I think<br>people uh in denen are really ke to make<br>that connection with people and help<br>people connect with others and it's<br>about seeing everyone as a human um and<br>a human with really interesting skills<br>and interesting perspectives and how can<br>we actually add into that to improve<br>things using those problem solving<br>schools um and make a community better<br>yeah and I think too because we're a a<br>also a strong University City we<br>attracted a lot of people from around<br>the world so it's very multi ethnic it's<br>very diverse as well um yeah and and<br>it's that mentality that of being<br>outside a large city think I me the<br>psychology your psychologist say that um<br>there's a certain population and after<br>that people don't tend to be as friendly<br>cooperation I moved here a year ago I've<br>got some great friends and support<br>around and it's really easy to connect<br>in um much easier than other cities<br>of great plug there so how the Tagle<br>prepares you for your future career so<br>we're going to um talk very quickly<br>about the university so if you don't<br>already know about a tago and we are New<br>Zealand's first we are a place of many<br>firsts and we keep keep Reinventing<br>firsts all where we are ranked in the<br>top 1% of universities in the world H's<br>producing fantastic graduates our<br>lecturers and academic staff excellent<br>teachers we have to M fix point an<br>incredibly diverse um student mix here<br>and that's where the fresh perspectives<br>come in exactly toa's point that and new<br>new talent coming produces new ideas and<br>people working together it's a really<br>exciting place to be and because we are<br>small and compact these ideas really<br>germinate and germinate very easily<br>across all sectors so you can be a<br>science student but you become best<br>friends with a business student and you<br>have a science and business idea<br>together so it all mails really well and<br>that really important point about our<br>graduates going directly into work and<br>further study very quick on our rankings<br>we rank really highly in lots of<br>different subjects across lots of<br>different um um academic divisions so<br>again where those Melting Pot of ideas<br>all come in together um and we've also<br>got New Zealand's best career service so<br>Ivon and her team do an amazing job here<br>and helping our graduates go on and to<br>get great employment<br>opportunities so talk about great<br>employment opportunities and career<br>service Von this is about your career<br>and and where it takes you and did you<br>just want to touch on this well I mean I<br>think a lot of people have kind of<br>touched on that personal thing um about<br>you know this is who employers want as a<br>person they don't just want someone with<br>great grades and choose someone because<br>of their degree you know they choose<br>someone because they're a person and<br>what makes a person interesting is the<br>things that they get involved in um and<br>what they actually learn from<br>um their work or their volunteer<br>experience or or even just an<br>experience um so you know if you're<br>coming from overseas and and coming here<br>you're learning a lot about um fitting<br>in being<br>resilient um and yeah it's all those<br>other things that are around um your<br>career that builds it up it isn't just<br>your degree so you've got to think that<br>360 um um way about um yourself and<br>about you know what's going to be on<br>your CV what sorts of things you can<br>talk about that you've done that<br>evidence your skills um so yeah I think<br>that's something that is uh really<br>important is evidencing your skills so<br>you say um I've got time good time<br>management skills you know what is your<br>evidence of that how have you actually<br>managed your time um so it's it's<br>building that self-awareness about<br>yourself um and it's putting yourself<br>out there and getting involved in the<br>community the community of the<br>university the community of the city um<br>and the things that are you know are<br>there and available so that you don't<br>just sit in front of a screen um and<br>only focus on one small area which is<br>your grave<br>um that you think about the big picture<br>and um yeah and how you do that I think<br>Ria you were you were saying when we<br>were just talking before this webinar<br>that that's what you were doing too from<br>the very start weren you when you<br>decided to come and it's a lot of money<br>you guys are investing in right yeah you<br>want to make the most of it so yeah<br>because my course was only 12 months you<br>really don't have much time to lose<br>between two full semesters of work and<br>your project at the end of it so you've<br>got to get your deduction line early in<br>the picture like they say so it was<br>greatly timed for me because the the<br>career Expo was just the first couple of<br>months after I joined so I went around<br>met everybody met all the companies was<br>like okay this is what your requirements<br>are now this is how I'm going to align<br>myself so that the end of next year I<br>will be in line to get a job smart<br>really good way and this is someone on<br>the slide that we're showing now you can<br>see sort of the range of options that<br>are available to you where you can get<br>those soft skills and I always find the<br>word soft skills quite you know it's<br>actually really important skills in of<br>anything on top of your academics really<br>vital skills to get involved in lots of<br>different things um to add to your<br>resume and make it stand out from all<br>the other people that are applying for<br>the same job and sasco transferable<br>skills same same yeah um I much prefer<br>transfer<br>hard especially for maybe some of the<br>introverts in the audience um you know I<br>we meet a lot of students um especially<br>you know who who are shy you're coming<br>to a new country it's really Brave to be<br>able to get out there and and meet new<br>people and connect but there's great<br>ways you can take advantage of this and<br>end up with these graduate and<br>attributes fantastic thing with the tago<br>is 86% of our students are away from<br>home so everybody's in a very similar<br>boat they've all stood in those shoes if<br>they've left home whether or not it's<br>from hundreds of miles away or thousands<br>of miles away but you will connect with<br>somebody who who has has been through<br>the same Journey as you and that's what<br>gives this why they love a tle graduates<br>because you do have to stand on your own<br>two feet get connected meet people talk<br>to a come down and see grace at startup<br>to need pestera for a<br>job you know it really is there and and<br>it's about showing your um self<br>motivation but also really getting<br>involved in teamwork as well which is um<br>a big part of the the attributes that<br>aago has so this touch is on the career<br>development center and all of the<br>opportunities available that you can get<br>involved in ion your area of expertise<br>again yes we've got a portal that when<br>you become a student you can log in uh<br>using your student username and password<br>in there you can look at all our events<br>um as re said you know we have career<br>experts and we have been throughout the<br>year um and oops and you pushed it<br>Forward

me um so we provide<br>workshops and seminars and um and just<br>help you I mean this is what we want to<br>do is help you with your um career<br>planning um out of our um our Center<br>we've also run the TGO um mental match<br>and an employability uh programs to<br>support you if you need to structure to<br>work through because a lot of people<br>come to University and have never done<br>any intentional career<br>planning um you know they've chosen a a<br>course to study but not really thought<br>about what they're going to do so um<br>we've got some structured work there um<br>some structured programs for you um but<br>also some just some time information to<br>help you to um make that transition out<br>into uh being part-time work or<br>full-time work this is what we get paid<br>for and you know we're here for<br>you the social impact Studio yes so part<br>of the Career Development Center is the<br>um social impact studio um and this is<br>where is another great opportunity for<br>you to get involved with other students<br>um and make inroads out into the<br>community um as a unic crew volunteer um<br>we have lots of um Community<br>organizations who contact the social<br>impact studio and ask if you got<br>students that can come and help us um so<br>we facilitate that um we also run a<br>couple of uh programs for um developing<br>your leadership um especially for those<br>people who um want to create change in<br>the community um and obviously you know<br>to change things in the Community you<br>also need to change yourself or<br>recognize yourself and build yourself<br>awareness um so you know a good goal is<br>to become a a global Citizen and um and<br>what are you doing or what can you do or<br>what do you want to do um to be a good<br>Global citizen um I think there's a huge<br>problems in the world that need solving<br>and you know start<br>local um yes and the center for<br>sustainability um are also starting<br>really local um you know some people<br>that might be you um don't know how to<br>grow their own vegetables um so they've<br>got a place where um for international<br>students you can um grow and harvest<br>your own<br>vegetables um you know we got a bike<br>place you can for a a donation you can<br>get a bike to bike around the place<br>again it's being sustainable rather than<br>coming and buying a car some people do<br>um so cycling around the place is a um a<br>really good sustainable way of um<br>getting about our city actually um yeah<br>we've got honey bees around the place<br>and um glch honey um and really again<br>the um the sustainability office um do<br>Focus around um the sustainable<br>development goals and it's a good<br>internship opportunities as well for<br>students absolutely yes yeah it's just<br>getting involved you know you can come<br>in there as well and um and start um and<br>Lead something if if you come from a<br>country where you're doing something and<br>something isn't being done here um you<br>know that's a great way to create change<br>um and to make something happen and yeah<br>that that's going to be a great thing<br>for your CV and it's also going to be<br>you know that evidence that you talk<br>about your skills if you um go for an<br>well okay and then anybody who's coming<br>for undergrad if you're wanting to take<br>that career Global we have a fantastic<br>opportunity for um anything that's not<br>Health Science because and it's science<br>Bachelor of Arts and and bcom where you<br>can go out and do a global exchange um<br>as part of being an international<br>student here we've got 100 institution<br>worldwide and again putting that on your<br>resume fantastic way to stand<br>out clubs and societies do you want to<br>touch on this yeah sure as it says there<br>there's over<br>160 we've just got a little snapshot of<br>the cultural clubs behind and I'm sure<br>you're quickly looking to see if your<br>ones up there um but once again this is<br>a really good way for connecting<br>networking you don't have to join your<br>own um cultural Club you could decide<br>that wow I've always wanted to find out<br>about kurti and you know um so but it's<br>not just um cultural clubs there's<br>sporting clubs there's my goodness<br>there's clubs for everything so it's all<br>about that trying something new and that<br>leads to the networking it leads to the<br>connections Etc and you're having fun<br>and you might be learning a little bit<br>about um someone's Community cultural<br>awareness or or even New Zealand<br>Community along the way and it's true<br>leadership skills too right you can get<br>onto committees get event skills all<br>those things yeah lots of different<br>skills that you can get involved in in<br>the<br>clubs so we've got um a a an array of um<br>either industry placement and internship<br>so I've just sort of divided this into<br>the divisions and just ever so quickly<br>so Health Sciences of course if you're<br>going to be become a registered Health<br>Science professional like a doctor Etc<br>you've got to do um your professional<br>programs that are interacted integrated<br>into the curriculum but for other um<br>programs there are Sumer internships and<br>commercialization opportunities then in<br>your Sciences a lot of the coursework<br>Master programs do have a<br>workplace-based project as part of their<br>program um this is usually done in the<br>summer holidays our academic here in the<br>sou southern hemisphere goes from<br>February to November and then so the<br>students have got three almost four<br>months to be on these kind of workplace<br>uh projects internships Etc I think that<br>was talking with Ria when you were on<br>your project and you asked if there was<br>employment and I know we've talked about<br>with Health Sciences when students are<br>on rotation in a hospital or a pharmacy<br>actually putting it out there that<br>you're looking for a job after you<br>graduate right exactly that's right yeah<br>let people know um because that's to<br>your Open Door um if they don't know<br>you're looking they'll just assume you<br>have something so yeah yeah could be out<br>there and ask I was talking to cohort oh<br>we'll go to the next one because we're I<br>was talking to cohort of um uh business<br>D science students and they were doing<br>their work placement and majority of<br>them had got a job from just doing the<br>work placement project over the summer a<br>lot of them do yeah yeah um even under<br>uh Humanities we've got<br>internships um so basically it of course<br>it depends on on the the papers or the<br>programs that you're doing but um there<br>is that opportunity too for a humani<br>student and um and then the business<br>school so um we've got up there there's<br>a fabulous f photo of our Bloomberg<br>market Labs uh which are Finance<br>business data science infoscience or<br>there's a range of students that are<br>using them this is all live data um once<br>again what otago has the the largest<br>Bloomberg market laboratory so this is<br>real life data it's like Bloomberg you<br>might see it um on your your cable TV um<br>it came about because um of the strong<br>ties with our alumni so the um<br>president of the share market is Oto<br>alumni and the um CEO of I think it was<br>A&amp;Z is also um Oto alumni so they got<br>together and and Fant so again case in<br>point that the degree just doesn't it's<br>not dened it's Global right like this<br>really does take you far and wait and<br>then we've got a range here um Grace um<br>you've got this startup denen there um<br>but ignite uh Consultants as well they<br>do you debble with them or that's a bit<br>separate um quite separate okay yeah so<br>it's more for<br>nonprofit uh free business advice and<br>strategic planning um as well actually<br>it was a um an international student<br>that started ignite Consultants yeah she<br>came in she wanted to be a consultant um<br>and she said you know how can I going be<br>a consultant if I don't get practicing<br>it um and so she started that up um and<br>got support and you know so it's<br>probably been going for maybe 15 years<br>now fantastic so yeah and I mean similar<br>with the business case program I mean<br>you know looking at business cases you<br>would be doing that in in a job even if<br>it's your own business you know like<br>what are you doing or how are you doing<br>it so you know there's real stuff that<br>you're learning you're not just learning<br>theoretical things you're actually<br>learning the skills um for what you<br>would do in a job yeah and also touching<br>on the executive and residents or guest<br>speakers we have so many guest speakers<br>that come down to den and you you can<br>meet them you can listen to them hear<br>you know what what they're doing we've<br>got yeah CEOs and I think we've got the<br>Reserve Bank assistant governor coming<br>next semester so there's some very<br>high-profile people who come down here<br>and give their time and we we'll connect<br>with you so yeah take advantage of<br>everything that is that is here to<br>offer and then just this is just a a<br>little snapshot of the the industry<br>connections at the University of otago<br>has there are multinationals in there<br>that you'll see as well as small medium<br>business uh New Zealand startups but for<br>us as new zealanders these are all very<br>very strong brands that are around the<br>country so I suppose we just want to let<br>you know too that by studying at otaro<br>doesn't necessarily mean you you you<br>stay in dened we'd love you to but your<br>degree is recognized around New Zealand<br>and around Austra austral Asia as well<br>as the world as well this is where our<br>International students are basically<br>working I'm just conscious of the time<br>so we're just going to run through these<br>um another um great initiative that um<br>the the local Council has with alongside<br>the university in polych is job done so<br>once again this is a a summer internship<br>program that a lot of students do while<br>they're staying in the country um while<br>you're on your full work visa um you can<br>work full-time sorry through through the<br>summer<br>holidays okay on to our panel<br>discussion okay so the first topic and<br>it say open to<br>anyone um so people think that an<br>employer's preference is GPA and<br>academic<br>performance um versus that<br>extracurricular activities and we have<br>really been sort of touching basa and<br>talking about this um throughout the<br>last 45 minutes but um what are the on<br>and off campus activities that Oto<br>International students could Le on<br>Leverage on top of their<br>CVS well I mean I think we sort of<br>talked about some of those um you know<br>like doing something doing something you<br>know or going along to to start up and<br>um having something to talk about about<br>what you're doing or about who you are<br>or or what you've actually achieved um<br>so I mean while there may be some<br>employers who might look at your GPA um<br>mostly that's only a small part of what<br>they're looking at um or or your<br>academic performance they're actually<br>looking at your CD um and how you're<br>articulating um your experiences on your<br>CV yeah touching on CV because you<br>touched on that early on in the piece as<br>well CVS or resumees might be very<br>different to your home country right<br>very so really that's the skill that<br>Avon can help you with you might not<br>want to chat GPT all of it and come and<br>Lear and how it works in New Zealand and<br>what New Zealand's employers are looking<br>for and I think employers are also when<br>they're interviewing you they're trying<br>to see will you fit into my company<br>culture so by being able to say that oh<br>yeah I I join joed the uh denan cro team<br>or whatever and um yeah these things<br>really help because it just also during<br>the interview makes you look more human<br>it might actually get those nervousness<br>and and you can talk about it and um<br>yeah um when I first went for my first<br>couple of jobs I did an<br>internship um and then went to a<br>different company because they just<br>didn't have the funding at that point<br>they knew that I was interested and a<br>bit of a space nerd so um was Secretary<br>of I was in Wellington at this time of<br>the Wellington Astronomical Society um<br>and six months later I got a call out of<br>the blue saying hey a satellite industry<br>thing has popped up we know that you're<br>passionate about it come along um if you<br>want it come get it and that's how we<br>met pet Beck um but I did not study<br>engineering or Rockets um but it was<br>purely because they got to know me and<br>they got to know that I have these weird<br>hobbies that they then picked up the<br>phone and it was those things that had<br>nothing to do with my degree um but<br>they' seen that I'm a relatively hard<br>worker through the internship um and we<br>just really interested in my other<br>passions um so it happens all the time<br>so let people know your whole<br>Personality yeah and don't just look for<br>a job look for somebody you'd like to<br>work for or a company that you'd like to<br>work for because of what they're doing I<br>think that's a key thing isn't it that's<br>quite important because then you align<br>your values to the values of the<br>companies then it's no longer work it's<br>something you're looking towards<br>achieving yeah yeah that's really nice<br>advice<br>yeah um is it a must to have a part-time<br>job so my CV is outstanding<br>um well I think it's helpful it's easier<br>to get a job if you've got a<br>job um but I don't think you have to<br>have a job before you necessarily<br>graduate as long as you've got something<br>and you're doing something and you're<br>able to articulate what you're doing so<br>um whether your course is enabling you<br>to learn a lot of skills and you're able<br>to actually talk about what those skills<br>are you know I'm thinking especially if<br>you're in the Sciences if if you're<br>developing techniques and working with<br>particular machinery and understanding I<br>don't know crisper or um thing like that<br>some have no idea what that<br>is um you know you're actually<br>developing the skills that you might<br>want to be using if you if you're<br>leaving so you don't need that you know<br>but um an employer might be interested<br>to know um tell me you know give me an<br>example of a time when you worked in<br>team you know what role did you play in<br>the team um so yeah I mean if you're<br>c um you know yeah sport uh Bonton I<br>don't know just going um hiking or<br>tramping with with a group of people um<br>you know that's what you can talk about<br>as evidence and your skills so you know<br>well I think it's great to be able to<br>get an internship but you don't have to<br>have an internship to actually get um a<br>job I think it's about following those<br>passions that you have and seeing those<br>as skills that you learning like coming<br>to a new country to study that is skills<br>and development within itself it's not<br>just studying you know you were putting<br>yourself out there and you were showing<br>um like an interview question might be<br>tell us about a challenging time that<br>you've had and how you overcame it<br>exactly so thinking about how can you<br>give evidence to that based on yourself<br>and what you're<br>doing and why you doing it yeah<br>fantastic so we've talked about we are a<br>smaller City we're a university city and<br>we've touched on quite a lot of this<br>that the opportunities um denan can<br>bring can go far beyond um dened um but<br>we also touched a lot on about<br>connection so do you feel there's less<br>opportunities cuz we're a small City or<br>do you actually think there's<br>more um well I think it's always steady<br>because we're a University City students<br>come and students leave yeah um so<br>there's always a turnover yeah you know<br>um and there's a benefit to it like in a<br>small City it's easier to figure out who<br>who should you be engaging with and it's<br>really easy to keep a finger on the<br>pulse and figure out cool I know that<br>this person knows this person let's get<br>connected Ed and so because the<br>connections are easier the opportunities<br>are easier to get you're not in a pool<br>of 600 people going for one job um you<br>can probably meet the hiring person<br>before you are actually applying for<br>that job and they will pick up their<br>phone call yeah yes denan has been<br>attracting a lot of small to medium<br>companies to come and start and<br>establish themselves in denan because<br>it's cheaper living costs for example<br>the gives incentives to startups and<br>things like that so yeah it is a it's a<br>city that I me just driving to the to<br>work this morning looking around there's<br>huge commercial projects going on a lot<br>of um scaffolding and and and cranes and<br>things like that yeah we've got the<br>biggest Hospital rebuild in the country<br>at the moment again we're University<br>with a medical school so it does attract<br>so there's lots of um skills that um we<br>need down in this part of the world so<br>and all call it home and love<br>it um so a question we sometimes get<br>asked as well is by International<br>students being disadvantaged in<br>comparison to New Zealand students in in<br>the job market um something that I found<br>quite interesting when I moved to New<br>Zealand is that a lot of new zealanders<br>straight after they graduate do their OE<br>or they over's experience so New Zealand<br>students don't tend to study abroad like<br>you may come here to study they will<br>study in New Zealand they will graduate<br>they go off and work right with in in<br>large numbers my parents did in the 6<br>days tradition yeah so that sort of<br>brings up some scope in The Graduate<br>space as well doesn't it absolutely yes<br>I mean I think we had record numbers of<br>people leaving um at moment at<br>moment course C everybody wants to get<br>out and explore they all came home and<br>now they're like okay let's go now Co<br>graduate so graduated started work Co H<br>so there was no opportunity for that so<br>a lot of those students um that would<br>have done their AE are now heading off<br>to do that um so it's a great<br>time grab a<br>job I think the the perspective that an<br>international student brings to the<br>table is quite different from somebody<br>who's lived in the country the whole<br>time so you're always going to have like<br>a bit of an ed<br>exactly yes yeah and I mean we we've<br>also touched on this um question um<br>throughout the the discussions today but<br>um you know Employers in Oakland are<br>Wellington hiring graduates from Denon<br>or from other cities um on a resume<br>would you actually put where you're<br>living or how how would do you think<br>there's a challenge there I don't I mean<br>for some employers it might be and<br>especially if they're watching the job<br>filed tomorrow and they think oh can we<br>meet you know in the next couple of days<br>and you're in needing or something that<br>I mean a lot of employers do the zoom<br>thing um you do that yeah yeah I applied<br>in to zoom and then moved once I got the<br>job yeah I did the same I apped on Zoom<br>moved from Oakland down to denan for the<br>job yeah so yeah I mean if you're<br>applying for a job in Denon and you're<br>living in Denon could actually be a good<br>idea to put that you're into Nan and um<br>and wanting to stay so I think that's<br>the other thing is that you're not just<br>applying for a job you're applying for a<br>company you're applying for a company in<br>a certain place and um and you have to<br>think about that as a more broad way to<br>approach applying for a job um an actual<br>fact um Employers in New Zealand do<br>actually prefer ataro graduates we<br>always get ataro graduates uh um more<br>you know having more of them than<br>ockland or fck um or Canterbury um<br>because because we we've got young<br>people living in a University City not<br>living at home yeah so they tend to be<br>more independent and I mean if you're<br>coming from overseas you you're already<br>all that so you know this is what an<br>employer in New Zealand wants someone<br>who is mature can hit the ground run<br>can talk well can talk well about<br>themselves and about what they've done<br>um and want to contribute to whoever<br>job okay so some tips for international<br>students in the career journey I think<br>we probably covered most of those<br>haven't we so hopefully you've been<br>paying attention if not a a recording<br>will be sent to you and you can take it<br>in your own time time and to read back<br>on that and then just um finishing up<br>with some um frequently asked questions<br>but yeah so uh one question that sort of<br>come through is can International<br>students work in New Zealand while<br>studying after graduating I can answer<br>that all yes you can so um please look<br>at um I'm I'm not an immigration expert<br>so I'm just going to say depending on<br>it'll be on your offer and your your<br>student visa it carefully but uh for the<br>majority of students yes they can you<br>can work part-time 20 hours a week while<br>you're studying and then fulltime while<br>um in the holidays and then once you've<br>completed uh a program once again I<br>check the program that you are doing uh<br>you can apply to up to uh 3 years what<br>we call a poststudy work<br>feaser yeah yeah and all the details<br>will be on immigration New Zealand and<br>because they can change frequently so<br>just make sure you stay in touch there<br>yeah um looking at um students finding<br>placement or part-time jobs do you help<br>with that well we help with the strategy<br>to do that so we don't actually you know<br>give a job to somebody oh you you I mean<br>sometimes we might depending if what<br>your skills are and you know if someone<br>employers come to us and said oh you<br>know we need someone with these<br>particular skills and if someone has<br>mentioned those to us um we will I mean<br>that will happen with academics and<br>that'll happen if your network as<br>well um you know if you let people know<br>what it is that you want um a lot of<br>international students um don't know<br>that in denen you can go and knock on<br>doors um and actually talk to people and<br>ask if they've got any um any part-time<br>work um I mean they can say no um and if<br>they do you always say oh is there<br>anyone else that you think I can talk to<br>I mean we're a small City so people know<br>people and that's how you can get well<br>that's the strategy on um trying to find<br>work as um meeting people and and<br>building on your network to find um<br>where a job might be I mean there is the<br>workforce um jobs as Sarah said about<br>the um the hospital that's been built<br>you can walk in there it's actually<br>called a um a jobs and skills hub<br>um and so they get employers come to<br>them and say oh we after these skills we<br>want people with these skills you can<br>walk in there and if they've got<br>something that meets your skills boom<br>you've got a part-time job so yeah the<br>other day that happened really really<br>quickly for one guy and<br>fantastic um and coming with a family<br>because um we definitely get a lot of um<br>Masters and PhD students coming in so<br>can it tag will help family yeah<br>absolutely so um the Career Development<br>Center recognizes that for the PhD<br>students in particular or or even Master<br>students um for them to be able to<br>concentrate on
