his<br>look<br>more<br>spee<br>spee<br>foree<br>spee<br>fore<br>for<br>my apologies for spending a few minutes<br>to say toow to<br>everyone in my<br>culture saying to low is not just a<br>respectful seeking of forgiveness for<br>probable<br>intrusions into your Sacred<br>Space to low Roots our feet in the<br>soil it respects mystery and safeguards<br>the sacredness of of those past present<br>and<br>emerging it invites us to seek humility<br>because we do not know all there<br>is and therefore our true<br>meaning cannot be realized until we<br>until we dare to respect<br>others this is true<br>especially if we are visitors and<br>strangers to the<br>land I take this opportunity with my art<br>most<br>humility to thank the leadership of Oto<br>fak huaka for your well warm welcome<br>this week and I in particular<br>acknowledge the acting Vice Chancellor<br>Professor Helen<br>Nicholson and especially the team and<br>Leadership of the<br>University thank you for making me feel<br>at home I feel very much at home with<br>your hospitality<br>and in particular I want to acknowledge<br>the school of Mori and Pacific studies<br>and Indigenous studies in particular<br>Professor Patrick bakot and the<br>wonderful team for this huge honor to<br>deliver this annual<br>lecture my f sharing is<br>titled reweaving the ecological met a<br>quest for Aika whole of Life philosophy<br>theang of my<br>story please allow me to frame my ideas<br>through my<br>story<br>stories is all I<br>have they are the intergenerational<br>clouds that provide me rain of<br>Hope to understand the background of my<br>story it is important to know the Tangi<br>or my Tangi my side of the<br>horizon or my side of the<br>heavens from when I am approaching this<br>far or this<br>talanoa my Tang is limited partial and<br>context<br>based therefore my langi never claims to<br>be the<br>whole I grew up with my grandparents at<br>the Western tip of the island of savaii<br>s<br>land the people in the island of H would<br>often refer to us as t for the Westside<br>people this is often often a mockery tag<br>and a ridicule of being far from the<br>cult from the center of Civ civilization<br>which is<br>AIA of course I am a tata4<br>and I am proud to be one seeing<br>civilization in our own dirtified and<br>push<br>terms not in someone else's<br>terms what occupied our land was a Coco<br>Farm but we also had other occupants of<br>the<br>land the name of our land is called<br>liali from the word Pali meaning to<br>rest in our family tradition it is one<br>of the resting places for the ancestral<br>Spirits before they make their way to<br>the entrance to pulotu the<br>underworld of poan<br>mythologies we had two t or settlements<br>of<br>pets we had many wild<br>bows wild chickens wild dogs and<br>countless<br>snakes on the northern part of our land<br>is a<br>Alo or the trail of ancestral<br>Spirits in this Trail there is no tree<br>no grass just<br>dirt meaning that it has been used<br>regularly though there are no<br>Footprints no human dares to cross this<br>Trail it is a piece of land dedicated to<br>the spirits of the<br>land because of this<br>itang I was regularly immersed into an<br>integrated philosophy of<br>fua or what I would like to call the<br>philosophy I was constantly<br>reminded that I am not just living on a<br>piece of<br>land rather I am living within a house<br>of multiple ecological bodies and<br>meanings it was as if I didn't choose My<br>Relations it was chosen for me by my<br>Fina my<br>fena I was born into these multiple<br>relationships my identity was was<br>and because of this<br>weedness I was not only constantly<br>reminded to<br>adapt uh to adopt an integrated and<br>multi-dimensional<br>mindset I was also reminded to say to<br>low to be conscious of the Tapo and the<br>boundaries of the ecological house I<br>belong<br>to toow constantly reminds us<br>of humility and regularly checks our<br>ignorance andone to low culture<br>sanctions the evil in us to take up two<br>ours let me say something about<br>colonization very<br>briefly coloniality in a way I Define it<br>personally comes from the root word<br>colon<br>meaning to<br>digest coloniality is a digestive system<br>that allows that swallows and organizes<br>everyone and everything into one<br>controlling political and economic organ<br>the Imperial organ or the Imperial<br>colon for centuries such a system was<br>brutally engaged with what I call ecolog<br>iCal<br>cannibalism the idea that the best way<br>to own people is to consume and take<br>over the<br>lands the result is the emergence of a<br>universal system called one<br>ification that<br>centralizes and controls benefits and<br>resources under one cultural economic<br>and political Center of<br>power for this consumption to become a<br>legitimate act an ideology of empty<br>spaces needed to be created in order to<br>own them we call this<br>teranas meaning a territory or space<br>without a master waiting to be occupied<br>and<br>taken I do not need to remind you how<br>this ideology which was the central<br>pillar of the doctrine of Discovery<br>warranted the Takeover of indigenous<br>lands and rights by the masters of the<br>Imperial<br>colon in the era of the anthropos<br>scene an Epoch of our time where human<br>dominance and the growing influence of<br>human activities greatly impacted<br>Earth which has led to significant loss<br>of biodiversity life<br>we need to do in everything we can to<br>move away from a destructive one<br>ification<br>system since Harry Truman's post World<br>War II vision of global development<br>project where other worlds were deemed<br>as<br>underdeveloped and therefore needing to<br>be saved from their undignified and<br>uncivilized State we live in a world<br>where development is based on someone<br>else's development imagery a<br>teranas world where we could easily<br>think that there is nothing wrong with<br>mining lands and oceans as long as we go<br>through proper legal approval processes<br>themselves I do not<br>fear the day we stop thinking of<br>resisting<br>colonization from entering our<br>homes rather I fear the day when the<br>very thing that we insist<br>stopping finds home in our<br>thinking my ancestors have warned us of<br>what they called<br>tala or to be folded like a mat a wisdom<br>expression that counsel that counsels us<br>against a closed folded system that<br>collapses our values and diversity in<br>system the Hall of Life integrated<br>philosophy the whole of Life philosophy<br>rests on at least three interrelated<br>principles the first is that life is<br>always<br>integrated and therefore everything is<br>connected Ed to<br>everything the whole of Life<br>Consciousness includes every dimension<br>of<br>life life therefore is never about<br>competing<br>contradictions but about Mutual<br>contradictions I will come to this later<br>in this<br>talk second life is structured around<br>interweaving multiplicities and<br>complexities<br>therefore we cannot simply sord a<br>people or Community into one simple<br>straightforward<br>category<br>Simplicity and linearity are some of the<br>tools of the colonial Masters to control<br>the narrative and label<br>people and third life is structured<br>around<br>relationality and therefore life is<br>about continuity<br>flows and<br>fluidities it is never about fixed and<br>structures the fu based<br>Consciousness why one might<br>ask why is fua always the starting point<br>for Pacifica thinking and<br>practice why is fua story the primary<br>story around which all other stories<br>revolve why do indigenous communities<br>always see themselves as fua<br>Keepers if we start with<br>fua our perspective and orientation<br>change our minds<br>change this is because we no longer see<br>the world through our eyes but now we<br>see see the world through our<br>relations we finally recognize that our<br>weakness is the door to understanding<br>the<br>eye this<br>weedness is the key behind our people's<br>passion of being custodians and keepers<br>of the land custodianship knowledge<br>comes<br>naturally because of our deep living<br>connection with fua<br>it is not a theory to be learned in<br>universities of<br>course learning custodianship can be<br>done in<br>universities rather it is a way of life<br>built into our<br>psyche we only know the value of what we<br>are fighting for if we are deeply<br>connected to it such as<br>funa today we cannot feel this deep<br>connection because we normalize that<br>everything must be first of all<br>Theory we put actions into Theory to<br>understand<br>them then we transfer these theories<br>back into action and practice and we<br>call it applied<br>studies theories are then transferred to<br>print print based becomes the primary<br>and legit ultimate source of<br>knowledge such knowledge becomes primary<br>source archived in history owned by<br>centers of excellence and policed by a<br>few<br>academics this archived knowledge then<br>glorifies the authors and not the<br>communities who own the<br>knowledge we then say that the quality<br>Pursuit<br>of knowledge is achieved only when it is<br>verified by such<br>knowledge and it is only after we study<br>such knowledge in theory that we apply<br>it in the field we call it field<br>work this whole process is what we call<br>academic<br>Excellence the process surely benefited<br>many of us who went through the system<br>and I believe all of us including<br>myself but it was also the birth of a<br>dependency syndrome were the so-called<br>truths we supposedly arrive at in this<br>preoccupation are then baptized as<br>truths as<br>absolutes Frozen in time and treated as<br>universals that apply to everyone<br>everywhere it is as if we accept the<br>fact<br>that it's your right to carry and drink<br>from someone else's water as long as it<br>is water approved by the center of<br>knowledge we are so obsessed with<br>converting practice into Theory flesh<br>into word reality into abstraction in a<br>search for truth that we missed the<br>point of being in<br>relation we grew up in a world that is<br>less I grew up in a world that is less<br>about theories and abstract and<br>abstracted truths than about the<br>interweaving of bodies meanings and<br>ecological patterns and<br>systems in Fu based Consciousness truth<br>can only be truth when it is constantly<br>tested through practice within the<br>Contours of living relationships with<br>fua God's truth is only made known<br>through neighborly love the practice of<br>contradictions when I grew up in our fua<br>we did not have problems with<br>contradictions or what we call today<br>binaries or polarities such as<br>connection and difference tangible and<br>intangible<br>living and dying male and female self<br>and<br>other it was only in a last two decades<br>that I realized the problem with the<br>life world of<br>polarities if you live in the community<br>in a village community you would<br>immediately notice that people operate<br>in a different philosophical<br>frequency because of fure based<br>Consciousness communities Embrace what<br>is called Mutual<br>contradictions without realizing it<br>sometimes here boundaries between worlds<br>such as the material and the spiritual<br>or living and dying constantly move and<br>shift to inform one<br>another there's always fluidity and<br>negotiability creating a world of<br>continuity<br>today our failure to realize continuity<br>is in contradictions in areas of<br>politics economy gender human rights and<br>so on is the main driver behind our<br>polarized<br>world when I went abroad for further<br>education I struggled to marry these two<br>worlds I encountered a world of<br>competing contradictions expressed in an<br>either or way of thinking in formed by<br>Western philosophies especially those of<br>Aristotle Charles dwin and Renee deart<br>to name a few which was radically<br>different from the world I knew of<br>mutual contradictions expressed in a<br>both end way of thinking ined by<br>Pacifica whole of Life philosophies of<br>relations and<br>connections as an example of the world<br>of competing<br>contradictions I call to mind DA's<br>Theory of<br>evolution whose Legacy significantly<br>significantly shapes our development<br>narrative<br>today it gave ground to the idea that<br>our development and adaptation is<br>basically dependent on<br>competition it is only by putting people<br>and systems into competition with each<br>other that development and evolution<br>occurs only then can we measure their<br>quality and<br>value the more competitive you are the<br>better you will climb the ladder of<br>success our Democratic value system is<br>philosophy this<br>system has definitely drawn out the best<br>of our skills and our qualities<br>especially in a Workforce so it has its<br>own<br>quality how<br>however it has also created a culture<br>where values are measured by material<br>wealth power entitlement jobs academic<br>qualifications and so forth hence we<br>normally glorify and immortalize those<br>who have these qualities who are on top<br>of the competitive<br>letter and we've and we vilify the weak<br>the poor and the Not So<br>able our development indicators of<br>system back to our land in<br>Lipali the constant Crossings of<br>spiritual and the material Worlds the<br>mutual coexistence of the domestic and<br>the wild the human and<br>nonhuman the tangible and the intangible<br>are not there so we can select and<br>glorify are select and glorify one and<br>vilify and eliminate the other rather<br>they are there to teach us resilience<br>and to know the value of the<br>whole today our shortfalls in many areas<br>of development in bis building policies<br>climate change responses diplomacy<br>leadership capacity building or economic<br>resilience are derived from the<br>inability<br>to master and no and mobilize the wisdom<br>contradictions both and versus the<br>either<br>or in communities life takes place as we<br>deal with conflicting<br>moments and communities psyches are<br>trained in the interflow of these<br>moments such as calm and disaster peace<br>and conflict living and dying connection<br>and disconnection autonomy and<br>relationality communi values uh value<br>these contradictions in many areas of<br>life such as leadership education<br>politics and<br>economics When We Were Young many of us<br>Village children would taught wisdom<br>Expressions such as number one we sleep<br>in Fortune to be awaken by<br>Misfortune two calmness is just next to<br>storms three do not be deceived by the<br>Stillness of the Morning<br>Tide four in strong tide race the CATE<br>uh sinate sale and in easterly winds<br>race the mat<br>S I did not know at the time that these<br>are resilient and adaptation<br>pointers they speak to the whole of Life<br>both and structure of<br>knowledge which which teaches us that<br>apparent contradictions such as calm and<br>disaster are different sides of the<br>other and are meant to overlap and<br>mutually intertwine before for our very<br>eyes therefore resilience is not so much<br>about responding to shocks as we Define<br>it<br>today but rather it is a whole of Life<br>adaptation system built into an<br>intergenerational cultural fabric to<br>train Generations about how to deal with<br>contradictions thus these Expressions<br>remind us never to focus on just one<br>dimension of of life but to adopt an<br>integrated<br>multi-dimensional<br>mindset I grew up in a huge extended<br>family of about 30 plus people who ate<br>from one<br>pot because of the whole of Life<br>philosophy we did not just grow up<br>together we grew in<br>together this is a very deep way of<br>living we lived as if we were part of<br>each<br>other by growing into each other we were<br>trained that in order to maintain<br>relationships we must constantly<br>navigate and negotiate our differences<br>and<br>contradictions manulani Maya from Hawaii<br>reminds us that difference that I quote<br>difference is what we have in common<br>when you go deeper into difference we<br>find the depth of what it means to be<br>quote a custodian of cultural knowledge<br>and former head of state of Sam tuya Tua<br>spoke um and called<br>thisal or<br>Harmony the first is the harmony with<br>fua second is a harmony with the self<br>third is a harmony with other people<br>people and<br>relations and fourth the harmony with<br>God these harmonies can only be<br>integrated and achieved if we have a<br>both and<br>byet and in the light of relationality<br>whole of Life perspective we cannot have<br>a genuine relationship with the last<br>Harmony if we cannot address the first<br>three<br>harmonies so I thought<br>that this is only a cultural<br>them but as a<br>theologian I also found in many aspects<br>of the Bible this culture of mutual<br>contradictions and I only can only<br>mention<br>one the SP the Bible speaks of this<br>world of mutual contradictions in the<br>prophet Isaiah's message in chapter 11<br>6-9 that the knowledge of God is echoed<br>in an image of the wolf living together<br>with the lamp the leopard lying together<br>down together with the goat the infant<br>playing near the corpus's den and the<br>young child putting its hand into the<br>Viper's<br>Nest they would neither harm nor destroy<br>each<br>other what is reflected here is not so<br>much harm Harmony without<br>contradictions but rather the life that<br>God Wills is not about elimination and<br>exclusion but rather about negotiating<br>our differences and contradictions and<br>ex um for the sake of living together<br>even if the other turns out to be a wolf<br>child the wisdom of<br>restraint living ecologically and<br>according to fua based Consciousness<br>does not mean we cannot cut down trees<br>or<br>fish the ocean for<br>family there will always be ecological<br>disruptions however we do this according<br>to our ethics of<br>restraint every<br>disconnection must be followed by a<br>reconnection this is a mechanism put in<br>place by many indigenous communities to<br>monitor greed and<br>selfishness as the old saying goes power<br>attracts the worst and corrupts the<br>best in many indigenous communities<br>including the Pacific after cultivating<br>uh a piece of land for two or three<br>years we practice restraint by letting<br>land rest for another two to 3 years for<br>the sake of<br>regeneration while moving economic<br>activities to another piece of<br>land because of the wounds caused by<br>removal sustainable growth requires a<br>rotational and<br>regeneration um<br>strategy the mo the most powerful agent<br>of growth is surprisingly not production<br>but rather it is<br>inaction<br>passivity<br>rest while pause gives off an air of<br>inaction an active natural process of<br>renewal and transformation<br>occurs these are deliberate attempts at<br>respecting nonhuman intervention in the<br>process<br>thus allowing fora and Humanity a<br>liberating space to heal renew<br>articulate and activate new development<br>Pathways this is an aociated space<br>between humans and the non-human<br>World slowing down and attending to the<br>relational structure of fua to pursue<br>respectful and effective diplomatic<br>relations resonates across the Pacifica<br>household this highlights the Pacific<br>philosophy of<br>time time revolves around fua time not<br>the other way<br>around a regenerative economic system<br>has the idea of slowing down so that the<br>natural process of healing has time to<br>take<br>place it is part of the cycle of life<br>and time where the best<br>Solutions come from respecting death<br>Decay inactivity and<br>pause rushing violates the relational<br>integrated makeup of communities and<br>values human development over ecological<br>people pause is the alltime rest<br>restorative<br>healer Pacifica communities have<br>different names for these for this<br>process of restraint such as vatu in<br>Fiji FASA in s fatui fatui in Tonga to<br>name a<br>few the develop World calls this<br>conservation but it is not the same as<br>conservation um is not just about<br>conservation conserving a piece of land<br>while we still maintain a system of<br>endless growth rather it is about human<br>restraint and changing the whole mindset<br>of<br>growth from an epistemological<br>perspective the wisdom of restraint is<br>so Central to the Pacifica mindset that<br>sometimes when they are in the room they<br>are often either silent or reserved<br>and many times we misinterpret such<br>restraint as either being<br>respectful in mutual agreement or lack<br>of<br>knowledge but this<br>restraint could either could also either<br>mean<br>disagreement disgusted or it could mean<br>that they are processing the topic<br>through list through silent listening<br>observing and critiquing in order to<br>reach an informed<br>response pause and silence is not the<br>opposite of<br>knowledge it is the very engine room of<br>knowledge that is why from a hold of<br>Life perspective we don't have a system<br>of rewarding children who talk more in<br>class it encourages a culture where<br>everyone is speaking at the same<br>time everyone is seems that everyone<br>speaking therefore everyone knows<br>everything everyone is an<br>expert we live in a system where every<br>moment of silence has to be chamb backed<br>with<br>noise this system excludes the very idea<br>that knowledge can only be can only<br>properly facilitated through pause and<br>silence pause involves the process of<br>bending time or slowing down time so<br>that no one is Left<br>Behind we cannot take everyone on the<br>journey if we are<br>rushing I also found this in the Bible<br>as well in biblical language this wisdom<br>of restraint or PA is called the<br>Sabbath Sabbath is more than just a day<br>of rest it is a Fu wisdom it is an<br>ecological principle of restraint put in<br>place by God to control and monitor<br>greed and abuse of<br>land but it's also about controlling<br>noise and long- winded culture of<br>production it is required for the<br>Regeneration and restoration of God's<br>fua even God in in the story even God on<br>the seventh day of creation respected<br>pause and<br>rest how did we lose this wisdom in our<br>development<br>narrative how did we lose the idea of<br>growth as not just about action and<br>production but also about inaction and<br>Pa on our part as<br>humans how did we lose the idea that<br>development is not just about<br>expansion but also about<br>contraction can we revive our ethics of<br>restraint or what theologians called<br>kinosis the self<br>emptiness or the self-restraint grounded<br>Jesus reweaving the<br>eal or the<br>REM a more systematic addressing of our<br>ecological crisis requires weaving into<br>our development narrative<br>the whole of Life philosophy and the<br>wisdom of<br>restraint to be more<br>specific the current development<br>strategies need to<br>incorporate and bring back again the<br>importance of Rest In Action pause and<br>restraint Pacific island church leaders<br>in recent decades have become concerned<br>with the collapse and the erosion of<br>more moral and ecological values such as<br>restraint and mandated a rethinking of<br>what we what they call the Pacifica<br>household as a result in<br>2017 the reweaving the ecological mat<br>project or REM was<br>born it was introduced as an initiative<br>of the Pacific theological College in<br>collaboration with Pacific Conference of<br>churches and the University of the South<br>Pacific Oceania Center to respond to the<br>missing piece in our development story<br>that missing piece is the agency of<br>Pacifica philosophies ethics and<br>spiritualities in shaping National and<br>Regional<br>development the rim is a unique and bf<br>homegrown initiative that draws on three<br>main sources Central to Pacifica people<br>one indigenous knowledge philosophies<br>and ethics two faith and cultural<br>spiritualities and three Community Based<br>experiences REM uses the concept of<br>reweaving and the metaphor of the mat to<br>tell the other side of the story about<br>our ecology and<br>development it involves to search for<br>tools not just just to disrupt and<br>unweave the Master's economic slavery<br>system of endless<br>consumption and to systematically<br>address the extractive nature of<br>development that is destroying our<br>common<br>fenua but also to produce or reweave<br>alternative life affirming development<br>ideals but in order to do this the<br>unweaving must start with the churches<br>themselves and hopefully moving from<br>there this approach to change the uh<br>would become the model for unweaving and<br>reweaving church doctrines systems and<br>structures that were and still are<br>significant significantly shaped by<br>coloniality one of the significant<br>changes occurred when the Pacific<br>Conference of churches in<br>2018 adopted the Pacifica household of<br>God as a new Regional and ecological<br>Vision this is a vision in which<br>custodianship and protecting of our<br>common ainga our common fua our Pacifica<br>household becomes our top Regional<br>priority part of this change includes<br>the fact that our churches no longer<br>recognize Colonial subdivisions of<br>Polynesia melanesia and microna as<br>relevant from a h of Life perspective<br>the Pacifica household is a diverse yet<br>United ainga or family where we have<br>togetherness the REM is driven by the<br>belief that the region can and should<br>determine its own future drawing from<br>from the richness of our diverse<br>spiritualities religious and Indigenous<br>Traditions knowledge systems and<br>experiences and lessons related to our<br>present realities in<br>development by harnessing indigenous<br>Pacifica philosophies ethics and<br>spiritualities as foundational elements<br>to redefine Regional development<br>strategies spurred on by a competing<br>consumerism and more is better<br>philosophy of growth that fuels the<br>current development model we can ensure<br>that Aid and any development initiatives<br>must align with the principles of<br>well-being and the aspirations of<br>Pacifica communities for a sustainable<br>and self-determined<br>future REM is a self-determination<br>strategy aimed at weaving a Pacifica<br>story<br>that is about<br>us this is a story of Hope grounded in<br>what we know is best for our people in<br>what we see that is sustainable for us<br>and what we believe is a healthy future<br>for our<br>children it has created a renewed thirst<br>for alternative models and a culture of<br>my last<br>point the Practical re<br>weavings for Pacifica and for indigenous<br>knowledge the ram suggests the following<br>as practical re weavings for our<br>development story based on this whole of<br>Life indigenous philosophy first is<br>language perhaps the best place for us<br>to start the reweaving the unweaving and<br>the reweaving is<br>language we need to develop a new<br>language of<br>development we need to unweave and<br>reweave the language of extraction and<br>control in<br>development the play of words and<br>Concepts is part of the imposed<br>development tactic for example the word<br>resource could mean something that is<br>available something is available to be<br>taken and<br>developed this um High checking of<br>language continues the teranas<br>philosophy that has demoralized many<br>indigenous<br>communities the word development itself<br>needs to be redefined in a way that<br>respects the whe of<br>indigenous formerly colonized<br>communities and is not something defined<br>by a project driven agenda<br>the language of sustainability needs to<br>incorporate the resilience cultures of<br>the<br>communities the game of<br>colors is also part of the development<br>tactic for example the language of green<br>economy is driven by the ideology that<br>in order to fix the climate crisis we<br>green not sure if it's blue now<br>as a<br>result we push to mine the deep sea bed<br>for poly metallic minerals to power this<br>economic push and then we turn around<br>and call it green<br>economy this Gold Rush has encouraged<br>some Pacifica Island countries in which<br>you might know already to go ahead with<br>deep sea mining activities starting with<br>the exploration phase<br>my greatest fear is not so much that we<br>don't have a trusted language to tell<br>our story or the people who could hear<br>it rather it is the fact that we have a<br>story and a language to tell such story<br>but we don't have the courage to tell it<br>because our people don't trust<br>it language is one of the power tools of<br>the empires<br>the story of the Tower of Babel in<br>Genesis 11 reminds us that language was<br>used as a powerful tool to control<br>peoples and extract lands to build an<br>imperial<br>Tower however it was the same thing used<br>by God to decentralize and destroy the<br>tower resulting in a diversification of<br>cultures and<br>peoples identifying and dismantling the<br>controlling language of colonial<br>Imperial and neoc colonizing tools is a<br>necessity second pacifical philosophies<br>and<br>spiritualities most of us are shaped by<br>Western philosophies learned in<br>institutions whose education and<br>accreditation principles were created to<br>meet the development interest of Western<br>societies I am not saying that we do not<br>need these Western soci uh philosophies<br>they are critically<br>important but the story of the mat is<br>not<br>complete because there are other strands<br>that should be part of the<br>mat what I'm saying is that Western<br>philosophies were first and foremost<br>context<br>based they were developed to address<br>issues that emerged in their own time<br>and space<br>if we are serious about changing the<br>development story we need to focus on<br>reexamination the ideological and<br>philosophical foundations of our<br>development models and<br>policies most if not all of our<br>development policy are at least<br>underpinned by the philosophy of growth<br>that emphasizes profit and a more is<br>better economic eth<br>we cannot change the story unless we<br>focus on the foundation of the<br>story this implies in terms of policy<br>formulation serious consideration of the<br>kind of develop development initiatives<br>that enhance not diminish our People's<br>Health and well-being the wholeness of<br>Life of our<br>people let me just uh speak a little bit<br>about it I'm not marketing it just<br>letting you know that b speak of<br>philosophy's program am I that I am<br>coordinating at PTC is the only of its<br>kind in the Pacific that not only<br>addresses the gaps in our practice of<br>indigenous<br>philosophies but also reweaves a new<br>philosophical foundation for the sake of<br>reframing development policies in the<br>light of the whole of Life the course is<br>cod deled with several Village<br>communities and Regional policy<br>organizations and targets mainly policy<br>makers University lecturers and<br>postgraduate students who focus on<br>development<br>studies the other program that my<br>institution is creating is also uh is<br>also creating is known as ecological<br>accounting also the first of its kind in<br>the region this is an accounting system<br>created to transform National financing<br>management by measuring the econom<br>economics of fua through financializing<br>natural<br>Capital inate ecological accounting<br>pursues a regulatory uh approach towards<br>valuing our spiritual and sacred<br>interactions with funa rather than<br>treating them as an investment<br>commodity investing uh in in integrate<br>in uh indigenous philosophies or<br>customary um methodologies with local<br>data sovereignty<br>decentralizes Global investment<br>Frameworks to promote sustainability and<br>equity for<br>all education is key to changing the<br>story of development but we cannot<br>change our approach to<br>education unless we unweave some of the<br>structures we have normalized<br>for<br>example we need to decentralize<br>structures that<br>compartmentalize and prevent integration<br>a whole of Life approach language such<br>as<br>departments and Majors need to be<br>reexamined we need to reexamine and<br>re-envision the current education system<br>that continues to structure ecology for<br>example as a separate discipline from<br>that of<br>anthropology economy or<br>theology there is also a need for<br>education to unweave the inherent racism<br>in education systems where communi based<br>ecological uh knowledge and philosophies<br>are normally treated as informal<br>knowledge that does not meet the<br>eurocentric standards of<br>education and the last one the value<br>space<br>leadership REM focuses uh suggests a<br>focus on a Valu spased leadership that<br>is concerned with the well-being of the<br>whole not just a<br>few this requires the cultivation of<br>quality leadership and compassionate<br>governance that is passionate about<br>long-term<br>sustainability Integrity of life for all<br>ecological management and<br>awareness groundup development<br>Frameworks<br>spiritualities civic responsibility for<br>adjusting governance and redistribution<br>of resources or wealth and moral and<br>Justice informed<br>decisions conducive to community spaced<br>development it requires building a value<br>spaced environment for our Young<br>Generation trusting in them to continue<br>the weaving<br>process value space leadership is also<br>about leaders knowing the time to step<br>down to allow the opportunity for the<br>Young Generation to<br>lead like the old M saying when the old<br>Nets<br>expire the new Nets go<br>fishing sometimes new Nets command the<br>end the challenge<br>remains while development continues to<br>transform its face some of this<br>transformation are either healthy or<br>destructive to our<br>well-being the reweaving must<br>continue in particular weaving in our<br>Pacifica ethics and spiritualties and<br>philosophies I just want to end my story<br>with a wisdom saying from Fiji in which<br>home meaning let the small trees go grow<br>far from the shadows of big trees so<br>they can have<br>life the proverb speaks of the<br>importance of<br>self-determination if we need a new<br>story we have to create<br>one but to do that we need to move away<br>from the Shadows of the Masters who<br>control the main story we cannot fully<br>realize our potentiality and power until<br>we shift away from the Shadows of the<br>Big<br>Trees this requires of course believing<br>in ourselves in what is available in our<br>communities that are affordable and life<br>affirming
