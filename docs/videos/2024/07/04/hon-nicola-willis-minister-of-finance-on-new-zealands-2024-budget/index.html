government at<br>tahar aaka Victoria University of<br>Wellington and just a really warm<br>welcome to all the students and teachers<br>here today and to The Honorable Nicola<br>Willis uh Minister of Finance who's<br>taken time out of what I'm sure is an<br>incredibly busy schedule um to be with<br>us today it's great that we've got over<br>300 students uh joining us in person<br>with um their teachers and I also take<br>the opportunity to welcome students from<br>across New Zealand who will re who will<br>view a recorded um version of this event<br>so just a few words at the beginning um<br>about the Wellington School of Business<br>university as a capital city business<br>school the Wellington School of Business<br>and government is embedded in the heart<br>of Wellington City and draws on the<br>expertise of business and government<br>organizations around us to inform our<br>teaching and our research<br>and in this uh slide you can see one of<br>our professors Elan noi who is standing<br>up to his knees in the water on the<br>Wellington<br>Waterfront in the lagoon actually it<br>looks like now um Alan is an economist<br>who researches and teaches about the<br>economic impact of disasters and climate<br>change he's one of a number of really<br>interesting um teaching staff and<br>research staff uh at the University<br>the combination of business and<br>government is what makes us a bit<br>different as a business school and means<br>our students gain a valuable set of<br>skills that prepares them for<br>interesting and productive<br>careers uh you can mix your Commerce<br>degree with other degrees across the<br>university and we have new degrees um<br>about to be launched around environment<br>and society that have um Commerce majors<br>in them in sustainable management and<br>um our preteer<br>campus<br>is um able to host events like this at<br>the Beehive because the campus is just<br>across the road here from The<br>Beehive um you can see we're close to<br>Parliament and that means that we can<br>engage with government on a regular<br>basis in Rutherford house across the<br>road the Wellington School of Business<br>and government plays an important role<br>in educating the next generation of<br>informed citizens like yourselves to go<br>on to careers in business the public<br>sector social Enterprises and not<br>for-profit we have a startup Hub within<br>Rutherford House of um startup<br>businesses and we aim to prepare you<br>also for contributing to policy debates<br>about what's best for New Zealand and uh<br>for the Asia Pacific region<br>so we're uniquely placed to develop<br>graduates that approach challenges and<br>opportunities from a commercial<br>governance and societal<br>perspective but it's not<br>all uh work in the lecture theater when<br>you come to University there's plenty to<br>get involved in the university has a<br>diverse student profile which enriches<br>the value of Campus Life um and we have<br>over 150 different student clubs at the<br>unity with some specific to the<br>Wellington School of Business and<br>government um we've got some listed<br>there there's um a uh a case competition<br>Club where um teams um debate business<br>cases against teams from other<br>universities um there's an investment<br>club uh there's a Consulting Club just<br>few so there events coming up uh at the<br>University and a key one that might be<br>of interest to you<br>all uh is uh the University open day on<br>Friday the 23rd of<br>August um with the Commerce showcase<br>happening um at rord house uh but also<br>of course there'll be events up on our<br>celvin campus and at the Tiaro campus<br>where architecture and design are<br>located so we really hope to see you<br>here on the day um at all our campuses<br>but particularly down here at ptia and<br>course planning day is the next day the<br>24th of August which gives students a<br>chance to plan out their<br>degrees uh which is really helpful<br>particularly if you're wanting to mix up<br>um the subjects and your degrees across<br>different um faculties in different<br>discipline<br>areas we have a range of scholarships on<br>offer um and the scholarships for 2025<br>are now open for applications um but<br>your applications need to be in by the<br>September and teachers who are<br>interested in more details about open<br>day or High School visits to our campus<br>can um connect with our staff um after<br>the session today or if you're looking<br>at the recorded version you can see here<br>the contact details we have Jackie and<br>Jose they're um over at the back of the<br>room at the moment um but they'd be<br>happy to organize a day for you I know<br>we have um Pap to college here today<br>who've just been on um a tour in the<br>petea campus with Jose so they can tell<br>you what it's<br>like um and please just um connect with<br>us via um any of our social media<br>channels we'd love to see<br>you and now to the main<br>event so the main event is a discussion<br>of the recent budget so months of<br>planning go into the budget and weeks of<br>dissection follow it uh and there's no<br>doubt it's a significant signal of the<br>Coalition government's plans and actions<br>what they've chosen to invest in and<br>what they haven't and always I'm sure a<br>juggling Act of<br>priorities so a very warm welcome to the<br>honorable Nicola Willis uh the Minister<br>of Finance the minister for the public<br>service the minister for social<br>investment and Associate minister of<br>climate change it's tiring just reading<br>them all out the poor<br>children prior to becoming an MP Nicola<br>held a number of Senior Management roles<br>at New Zealand Dairy Cooperative fona<br>she also served on the boards of export<br>New Zealand and policy Think Tank the<br>New Zealand<br>initiative Nicola is a graduate of<br>taring aaka Victoria University of<br>Wellington with a first class honors<br>degree in English literature she grew up<br>in Wellington and today she lives in<br>Wellington with her husband Duncan and<br>their four<br>children um thank you for speaking with<br>us today Minister about the budget the<br>floor is yours um I think you'll speak<br>and then um we'll move to questions um<br>afterwards no my H my my uh in Mana<br>in<br>welcome welcome to your place your<br>Parliament where decisions get made<br>about your country and your future it's<br>great to have you here uh and to see so<br>many of our young<br>wellingtonians engaged in the business<br>of government and<br>economics before I talk about the budget<br>today I thought that I'd take a step<br>back and say well with everything that<br>happens in the world what are the bits<br>that government controls uh and what are<br>the bits that we have power over because<br>I think it's pretty obvious to us all<br>that governments don't control the<br>weather the massive climactic events<br>that occur we don't we don't control<br>what conflicts happen overseas we don't<br>control many things but what we do have<br>influence over I think about as three<br>main things<br>the first thing is decisions about how<br>we tax people and how we spend that<br>money the second thing is we have<br>control over what the government chooses<br>to own and how it manages the things it<br>owns from hospitals to classrooms to<br>trains and the third thing is that we<br>think about the rules and the laws that<br>we set for our society and for our<br>communities the rules and regulations in<br>which we all<br>operate so if we think about those three<br>things budgets are really about the<br>first bit they are<br>about how much money we take from New<br>zealanders and their businesses and what<br>we do with<br>it uh they're not so much about the<br>rules that we set for example the<br>decision we made to ban cell phones in<br>your schools that wasn't made in a<br>budget uh but an important decision uh<br>none the<br>less so when we talk about budgets and<br>the decisions that we make for uh tax<br>and<br>spending I think there's a really<br>interesting phenomenon that<br>occurs which is that if you think about<br>an<br>iceberg you think of the very tip of<br>that<br>Iceberg budgets tradition Ally only deal<br>with that tip which is to<br>say there are billions and billions of<br>dollars that get taxed and spent across<br>the economy every year but traditionally<br>in a budget the government just<br>announces decisions about the new<br>spending that it's doing and it doesn't<br>talk so much about the iceberg<br>underneath of the spending that goes on<br>no matter what uh no matter what so<br>budgets have tended to be about the<br>decisions the government makes about the<br>extra spending that it<br>does and as we came into our first<br>budget as a government and as I uh<br>thought about putting that together with<br>our<br>colleagues before we made those<br>decisions about the tip of the iceberg<br>we discussed as a cabinet and as a group<br>of ministers what is actually what is<br>actually the goal that we are coming to<br>those decisions with and the place that<br>we start as a government<br>is we want this country to be a much<br>wealthier more prosperous place and the<br>reason for that I think should be<br>obvious to you economics and accounting<br>and finance students which is countries<br>that are wealthier and more prosperous<br>have better<br>choices wealthier countries get to look<br>after their environments better<br>wealthier countries get to invest in<br>their schools and hospitals more<br>wealthier countries can offer their<br>people better paid jobs and they can<br>ensure that there are better<br>opportunities for people across their<br>societies so we start from the position<br>that everything we do should be actually<br>supporting the country to grow and be<br>more<br>prosperous not just focusing on how we<br>divide up the pie that we already have<br>and so when you think about New Zealand<br>from that<br>perspective we've had a tough few years<br>we've experienced a cost of living<br>crisis which has been defined by 3 years<br>of very high<br>inflation as you know in New Zealand we<br>target inflation to come in below 3%<br>ideally to be at<br>2% uh and we do that because without<br>that stability prices rise so fast that<br>many people get caught in the wash and<br>can't keep up with costs<br>I've no doubt that some of you have been<br>experiencing that in your own family uh<br>in recent times where the bills keep<br>piling up faster than the income to pay<br>for them so the governments actually<br>have a job in terms of thinking about<br>how we manage<br>inflation the other thing that's<br>happened of course in New Zealand with<br>really high<br>inflation is that the Reserve Bank who<br>in our economy has responsibility for<br>targeting inflation and getting it under<br>control has used its tool of RA lifting<br>interest rates to try and get inflation<br>under control and that's been tricky too<br>because High interest rates hurt anyone<br>who has borrowing because they need to<br>pay more for that borrowing and they<br>make it harder for businesses and others<br>in the community to borrow so what we've<br>seen is that interest rates have gone<br>very high and the result of that has<br>been that across our communities many<br>people have been doing it very tough<br>businesses have been struggling as fewer<br>customers have come in the door and we<br>have seen uh many uh families struggle<br>uh to pay their<br>mortgage so I start there because for so<br>long as New Zealand has really high<br>inflation and really high interest rates<br>it's going to be hard to get our growth<br>engine going so as we came into this<br>budget one of the things our government<br>was really focused on was how can we<br>make sure that over these next few years<br>we're not adding fuel to that inflation<br>fire because if we make inflation worse<br>The Reserve Bank will have to crank the<br>interest rates higher and there will be<br>more suffering as a result so we started<br>there the other premise that we bore in<br>mind that I think is really important is<br>we thought about how much debt we would<br>be creating for the future because the<br>simple real it in New Zealand is that<br>since<br>2019 the government hasn't run a budget<br>that pays for itself in every budget<br>since 2019 the government has been<br>borrowing to pay for the commitments it<br>has made now that's okay sometimes<br>governments have to borrow you know when<br>you're responding to a significant event<br>like covid-19 or a global financial<br>crisis or floods it's going to be<br>appropriate uh to do some<br>borrowing the challenge for New Zealand<br>is that we've done so much borrowing in<br>recent times that our debt has got a lot<br>higher than it used to be it's it's<br>crept up over 40% of the value of our<br>overall uh<br>economy and our view is that we need to<br>get that under control we need to get<br>that under control for a couple of<br>reasons one because if we don't you're<br>going to spend your lifetimes trying to<br>pay it back as taxpayers<br>and two uh because if we don't sort it<br>out then when the next problem comes<br>along whether it's a cyclone or an<br>earthquake New Zealand might find it a<br>lot harder to access the cash it needs<br>uh to respond to that emergency so our<br>budget started from the position of we<br>need to be really careful with how we<br>spend money in this<br>budget and we made five key priorities<br>within the money we were going to<br>spend the first was we looked across<br>government and we saw example after<br>example of things in recent years that<br>the government had been spending new<br>zealanders hard-earned money on that we<br>didn't think represented best value for<br>money these were programs and<br>initiatives that never went anywhere<br>this was huge amounts of funding that<br>went into government agencies and yet<br>new zealanders weren't reporting<br>increased results to give you a sense of<br>this government spending has increased<br>around<br>80% and so I want you to then think in<br>the past six or seven<br>years uh some of you would have been<br>quite young uh six or seven years ago<br>what's improved 80% because there hasn't<br>been an 80% reduction in crime there<br>hasn't been an 80% Improvement an<br>educational achievement there hasn't<br>been an 80% Improvement uh in the<br>waiting time for for health uh for<br>surgery so we looked at that and we said<br>actually we've got a job to do as a<br>government to find the money that's not<br>going to its best purpose so that we can<br>get more impact and more value and we<br>started from the view uh that new<br>zealanders have been paying in real<br>terms much higher levels of tax in order<br>to keep the spending going so as you'll<br>be aware we campaigned on making<br>adjustments to the tax system so that<br>new zealanders have been going through a<br>cost of living crisis can keep a bit<br>more of their household income and we<br>made adjustments there these were the<br>first tax adjustments that had been made<br>in 14 years uh and we thought were<br>overdue uh and mean that many uh<br>families around 3.5 million new<br>zealanders uh will have a bit more cash<br>uh each fortnite as a result and we see<br>that as critically important because<br>actually the most direct thing that any<br>of us experience in the economy is the<br>income we receive and the job we<br>do so we made changes to the tax system<br>the second area that we thought was<br>really important was rep prioritizing<br>money so that we could pay for that tax<br>reduction without having to borrow for<br>it so we went on a big savings exercise<br>across government we went line by line<br>through the things that government was<br>spending on and we identified those<br>things that should be<br>reprioritized and that meant that we<br>could fully fund our tax reduction<br>the next thing that we looked to invest<br>in was we thought what are the things<br>that new zealanders believe are most<br>important for the government to be<br>delivering well and where we think<br>additional resources are required and we<br>identified four key areas number one<br>education because actually the biggest<br>predictor of how well an economy or a<br>country will go in<br>future is how well educated its people<br>are and so we always need to ensure<br>we're investing in education and I'll<br>come back to that the second area was<br>our health system because we have a view<br>uh that ensuring that the health system<br>can deliver for new zealanders and their<br>time of need whether that's when you<br>need to go to the emergency room having<br>an accident or whether that's when your<br>family member needs surgery uh that<br>requires constant investment in the<br>health system to make sure it has the<br>nurses and doctors needed to deliver<br>service<br>the third area we think is critically<br>important is keeping our communities<br>safe and that requires investment in Law<br>and Order Our police our prison<br>service and finally the area we think is<br>a priority for government spending uh<br>for new government spending is<br>infrastructure that is making sure we<br>have the roads we have the trains we<br>have the hospital buildings the school<br>building buildings uh that are needed uh<br>for our community to function well so we<br>were really clear at the outset of our<br>budget that where we were going to be<br>spending additional money it needed to<br>be very squarely prioritized towards<br>those goals Education Health Law and<br>Order infrastructure and tax reduction<br>and that's what we put together in our<br>budget and so I I'm very happy to answer<br>all of your questions about the specific<br>things that we did one of the<br>reflections that I would share with you<br>is that sometimes it's the little things<br>that actually can have the most<br>impact let's talk about the health<br>system for example in our budget we<br>committed an additional $ 16<br>billion that is so much funding it's<br>kind of hard to get your head<br>around but many of you will have much<br>more easily got your head around an<br>initiative you might have heard of which<br>is our decision to put additional<br>funding into the Gumboot Friday mental<br>health program and this is a program<br>targeted at you targeted at young people<br>run by non-government organization Mike<br>Kings gumo Friday which has the promise<br>that if you ring their service needing<br>mental health support needing counseling<br>they'll get you support within a week<br>and we love that model because we look<br>at that and we say well actually getting<br>good mental health support to young<br>people is critically important they've<br>done a good job let's fund them<br>well that only cost $24 million which is<br>a lot of money but compared to 16<br>billion uh is obviously a tiny tiny<br>fraction and the point I'm making to you<br>is this that in budgets sometimes it is<br>the small Investments we choose to make<br>that can turn the dial and so the job<br>that we do as ministers is to work to be<br>very careful stewards of every dollar<br>that we spend to make sure it has<br>Maximum Impact because the thing is a<br>dollar that we invest over here that's<br>doing an okay job but not a great job is<br>a dollar we can't invest over here where<br>it could be doing something amazing and<br>so that is the constant process that we<br>are going through as ministers is to<br>identify where can money go to its<br>biggest impact I'm happy to talk to you<br>more about each of those areas and where<br>we invested in this budget but I do want<br>to come to this final point before I<br>invite your<br>questions which is where I<br>started which is actually our goal as a<br>government is to grow the economy as a<br>whole because when we look at what<br>really matters to people whether you can<br>get a<br>job whether you will get a pay increase<br>whether there is the resources available<br>for investment we know that all of those<br>things are made easier if the economy<br>grows faster so we are humble as a<br>government that it's not me who's going<br>to go out tomorrow and come up with the<br>exciting new business idea that<br>incorporates Ai and leads to a global<br>exporter that makes money for New<br>Zealand that will probably be done<br>instead by a clever entrepreneur or a<br>clever business that decides to take a<br>risk so fundamentally as a government<br>what we need to do is create conditions<br>in which businesses and entrepreneurs<br>and individuals and workers think yep<br>that looks okay I want to to build<br>things and make things in New Zealand I<br>want to invest in New Zealand I want to<br>employ people in New Zealand so we take<br>really seriously our job which is to set<br>those fundamentals right to make sure<br>that our budget uh prioritizes well is<br>careful about inflation careful about<br>interest rates uh and puts dollars in<br>the right areas so uh we put together<br>our budget I delivered it uh several<br>weeks ago now uh there are so many<br>things in it I thought best to answer<br>your questions about uh those priorities<br>rather than uh talk to you um Ed andum<br>about it uh but I would just finish and<br>saying that as young people who are<br>learning about how finance and economics<br>works I think you have a critical role<br>because you should never sit back and<br>think decisions about New Zealand are<br>being made by other people without you<br>you are absolutely part of it and I<br>think the challenge uh for all of us as<br>decision makers is to listen to you<br>about your priorities and choices but<br>also to understand that this is an<br>amazing country and I want you to feel<br>optimistic about it because I know that<br>there has been a lot of talk in recent<br>times uh about the challenges in our<br>economy and that's totally real but if<br>you look at New Zealand from anywhere<br>else in the world we've got it going on<br>because actually this is a place with<br>abundant food it is a place with<br>abundant natural resources ources safe<br>borders surrounded by an ocean great<br>trading relationships clever people and<br>so my optimism is that we can grow this<br>country we can do more things and better<br>things and we'll do it with people like<br>you giving your best to it uh so my<br>final message about our budget would be<br>budgets are one stepping stone economies<br>are far larger than a budget uh and<br>governments are far larger than a budget<br>they are a step in the right direction<br>and the rest is ultimately up to new<br>questions right everyone um so the<br>minister will take questions um I have a<br>few prepared questions that have been<br>sent in if you uh need me to ask them<br>while you're warming up to ask your<br>question and I do need to say you you<br>need to be aware that we are recording<br>this um session so um your voice will be<br>captured but no image of you will be<br>captured because the camera is focused<br>on the minister of course um so just be<br>aware of that as you ask your question<br>so first of all I'll open it to the<br>floor uh hands up if anyone has a qu of<br>the first question excellent I'll bring<br>hello what um I'm from Sacred Heart my<br>name is Victoria what would you say<br>about the fact that all of the things<br>that you have cut from the budget such<br>as the public service workers the free<br>public transport and the prescription<br>fees along with the tax cut actually<br>seem to be benefiting creating more<br>wealth in equality and benefiting the<br>Rich more than they do the poor I just<br>completely reject it it's not true that<br>is not a fact um and so I think one of<br>the things that is really important in<br>politics is that we do establish facts<br>so uh in terms of our tax package we<br>were really careful that we wanted to<br>make sure our tax package targeted the<br>people who we thought most needed tax<br>relief and we identified that to be<br>lower and middle- inome familyes<br>so when we designed the tax package we<br>designed it to reach them more so there<br>are a few components to that the first<br>is that when we adjusted the tax<br>brackets what that meant was that people<br>on Lower incomes would end up paying<br>lower rates of tax than they do at the<br>moment take the example of a minimum<br>wage worker working full-time 42 hours a<br>week uh because of inflation over recent<br>years they've been pushed into higher<br>tax brackets and they're paying higher<br>rates of of tax they now pay 30 cents in<br>the dollar if they're working 42 hours a<br>week we don't think that's fair we think<br>that if you're a lower income earner you<br>should actually be at a lower rate of<br>tax so the adjustments we've made mean<br>that a minimum wage worker if they're<br>working that many hours a week will now<br>pay 17.5 cents in tax for every dollar<br>that they earn the second thing that we<br>did in addition to adjusting the tax<br>brackets to be fairer on low and middle<br>inome workers was we ensured that we<br>were offering a topup an independent<br>earner tax credit uh for those earning<br>uh lower amounts of income that was to<br>top up the value of their tax relief the<br>third thing we did was we identified<br>that if you're a lower and middle income<br>family with children uh then you've got<br>an even greater need for Relief and so<br>we increase the size of the tax credit<br>you get if you're a working family on a<br>low income and the fourth thing that we<br>did was the we identified that families<br>on middle to lower incomes with young<br>children face particularly high costs<br>and so we introduced a family boost<br>Child Care rebate so that they could get<br>rebates for the sometimes exorbitant<br>Child Care fees that they have to pay<br>the point I'm making to you is<br>this just because someone on Instagram<br>says that our budget is for the wealthy<br>doesn't mean it's true and I challenge<br>you when you see those assertions go and<br>decide for yourself with your own<br>intelligence and your own capability<br>whether the facts support the assertion<br>made uh because we've been extremely<br>careful in our budget to uh Target lower<br>and middle- income families the other<br>thing I would say is this you are right<br>absolutely that we have made some tough<br>decisions in our budget to reprioritize<br>money from some areas into others<br>absolutely that is the case and that has<br>led uh to job reductions across the<br>public service the flip side of that is<br>this our public service numbers have<br>grown dramatically in recent years up<br>30% and you have to ask yourself have<br>new zealanders seen the increase in<br>service to them as a result and the<br>second thing I would say about that is<br>that as Government we actually have a<br>job to do to make sure that we before we<br>take New Zealand's money and invest it<br>and hiring someone that we can look that<br>New Zealand family in the eye and<br>promise them that that will be of more<br>value than them keeping that money to<br>pay for their children swimming lessons<br>to pay for their groceries and we're not<br>sure that that balance has been struck<br>in recent years and finally i' tell you<br>I was in Wellington at a breakfast<br>recently and someone said to me Nicola<br>thank you so much uh for making some<br>adjustments in the public service<br>because now in my business I can finally<br>hire skilled people it has been so hard<br>to get them to work for my business in<br>Wellington because they've always chosen<br>to work in the public service instead my<br>point is simply that there are jobs um<br>across our community not just jobs and<br>government<br>agencies thank you for that um I just<br>like to ask a question that follows up<br>from that question you like to speak of<br>facts right and dismissed this question<br>as being based on something off<br>Instagram andly and sort of being a to<br>be misled from that I based on facts so<br>the tax cuts for for my own personal<br>household I earn close to double the<br>income my partner unfortunately um I<br>received $40 a fortnite as a tax cut her<br>received close to half my income only<br>received $1 per fortnite how does that<br>not increase inequality because that is<br>a factual example sorry what's sorry um<br>I'd have to understand your personal<br>circumstances so as your point that<br>there's unequalness between you and your<br>partner in terms of the income you earn<br>the key point is although I earn more<br>than her I therefore receive a higher<br>tax cut than she does so I receive more<br>financial support than she does because<br>I earn a higher income my question is<br>how does n not and of itself further<br>income inequality if I earning a higher<br>income receive more support and she<br>doesn't a lower income well I imagine in<br>your household you share your income so<br>uh we do um and it's traditional for<br>governments on a broad level though<br>there's an example of two people there<br>are other people out there who will not<br>be the same incomes but those earning<br>lower a teacher or a student Minister<br>I'm trying to support the question that<br>was based on the fact that you've tried<br>to negate from thank you um well um I<br>think the point that your teacher is<br>making uh is that in his household there<br>is one earner who's earning more than<br>another and therefore they earn more and<br>therefore uh they pay more tax uh and<br>therefore in their case they are getting<br>uh more tax reduction that is true and<br>the point that we uh have made and that<br>I am making is that therefore we want to<br>make sure that when we structure a tax<br>package we're ensuring that those on<br>lower and middle income are actually<br>given good incentives to work are given<br>good incentives to take a promotion uh<br>we don't think that people who earn more<br>should necessarily be punished we think<br>that actually it's great that there are<br>people out there working hard and<br>getting promotions and so I accept that<br>there can be a philosophical view on<br>that but I would also say this to you if<br>you look at the child poverty report<br>which we put together that shows that as<br>a consequence of our budget child<br>poverty as measured by the after um<br>housing measure will be lower than it<br>would otherwise be and that that is a<br>result of the way that we have uh<br>structured our package<br>I think you know the the debate we're<br>having here is there are choices and our<br>view is that the choices that have been<br>made in recent times have meant that<br>working people have had to pay higher<br>rates of tax an average taxpayer has<br>gone from paying TW 15% of their income<br>and tax to 20% and we say at a certain<br>point you have to say do you just keep<br>spending more money as a government and<br>taxing people more to pay for it or do<br>you make it fairer and let people keep a<br>bit more of their own money I choose<br>that side of the argument you may choose<br>the other side of the<br>argument<br>question um I would like to ask is now<br>the best time for tax relief as it may<br>drive inflation further so people may<br>actually end up suffering more hey great<br>question because um if we were to do tax<br>relief and we didn't fund it responsibly<br>it could be potentially be inflationary<br>so that was one of the challenges that<br>we approached in our budget what we did<br>with our tax package was that we costed<br>it out and then we identified the the<br>full way of funding it through a series<br>of initiatives to offset the cost of it<br>and the advice that I received from the<br>treasury who are learned economists and<br>an independent government agency was<br>that where tax relief is fully funded<br>through savings and rep<br>prioritizations then on balance it is<br>disinflationary and the reason for that<br>is is this if I can simplify it really<br>um boldly which is if you're a<br>government agency and I give you a<br>dollar to spend this year you're<br>definitely going to spend it because<br>that's what you're required to do if<br>you're an individual taxpayer and I give<br>you a dollar to spend a lot of the time<br>you'll spend that but in some cases you<br>might choose to save it or use it to pay<br>down your debt and so what that means is<br>that tax relief if funded through<br>offsetting savings and<br>reprioritization uh puts less cash into<br>the economy than would otherwise have<br>been the case and that's why we were so<br>careful to fund the tax package in the<br>question<br>voters is this working uh voters in well<br>inton have repeatedly voted in support<br>of uh politicians who support um<br>initiatives such as Wellington Light<br>Rail and other Pro pedestrian Pro public<br>transport positions uh that your<br>government has now decided not to fund<br>how do you explain to the voters of<br>Wellington why you have rejected their<br>Democratic<br>decisions um well we haven't rejected<br>the Democratic decisions um Wellington<br>continues to have um democratically<br>elected councilors Council and members<br>of parliament actually our budget<br>reflects ongoing funding uh for the<br>subsidization of buses of trains and in<br>fact a large amount of money in our<br>budget to fund new trains uh for the for<br>Wellington commuter rail so I reject<br>your assertion uh that we don't support<br>public transport we do we think it's<br>important uh and in fact in the<br>Investments that we are prioritizing for<br>the future we want to to ensure that New<br>Zealand and Wellington specifically have<br>the basic roading infrastructure needed<br>to support uh buses and public transport<br>um actually some of you will have to go<br>through the mount Vic tunnel each day to<br>get to school uh and you will know that<br>it's not just cars that get caught in<br>that traffic uh it actually has an<br>impact across the network as well uh and<br>it snars out buses as well so our view<br>is that better Road infrastructure<br>supports a couple of things it actually<br>supports better public transport<br>networks but it also supports people to<br>use electric vehicles and lower emission<br>forms of vehicle I don't think it's fair<br>to say that everyone in Wellington uh<br>wanted Light Rail the evidence for the<br>light rail got discussed for six years<br>under the last government they promised<br>to fund it and deliver it they never did<br>and ultimately that was because it was<br>very difficult to put together a<br>business case that demonstrated there<br>would be enough people who wanted to<br>catch it<br>uh and so we're getting on with uh other<br>projects those are choices that we<br>campaigned on uh and I think you know<br>democracy is ultimately uh that the<br>elected hey Minister I'm a unit from WR<br>High College my name is nii so this is<br>our question what is the government<br>doing to prevent The Brain Drain given<br>that currently our salaries and wages<br>unfair compared to Australia just a lot<br>of us good workers are heading overseas<br>and we want to keep them here cuz we<br>want them it's such a a great question<br>because it's one of the things that<br>really concerns me if we want New<br>Zealand to succeed we need talented<br>capable hardworking people to want to<br>live here and if new zealanders feel<br>that the way to pursue their aspiration<br>or their ambition is to move to another<br>country then that is bad for all of us<br>and so ultimately The View that our<br>government takes is that if we want to<br>make this a great place to be we have to<br>make this a place where you do get<br>rewarded for your effort for your work<br>that you do feel you can get ahead that<br>this is an economy that's growing that<br>provides you good choices and<br>opportunities and that this is a country<br>where you get good Services good schools<br>good hospitals uh all of those sorts of<br>things and so I am very concerned with<br>the number of people who have been<br>leaving but I also understand it which<br>is that we've had three years of a cost<br>of living crisis uh and many people have<br>been doing it very very tough and so for<br>me I just find it motivating which is<br>that's why we have to every day as a<br>government work hard to strengthen the<br>economy uh and to make sure that this is<br>a place where services are better and<br>ahead thank<br>you question uh you talked about<br>controlling debt but according to news<br>Hub you were increasing borrowing by $12<br>billion uh which equates to the bulk of<br>the tax cut<br>package um um how does that actually<br>help<br>people well look it's a really good<br>question there's two parts to that the<br>first is um as I said our tax package is<br>fully funded by offsetting measures so<br>we're not borrowing for tax relief the<br>situation that we have inherited is one<br>of a of an economy that has been slowing<br>down dramatically and many of you will<br>be aware of that you will have seen the<br>headlines in recent months about<br>recession uh about very low growth for<br>four of the past six quarters the New<br>Zealand economy has been going backwards<br>it's been<br>shrinking uh and what that has meant is<br>that even since we came into office the<br>economists the forecasters the<br>statisticians have been looking at the<br>New Zealand economy and they've<br>concluded that the recession the<br>downturn started earlier than they<br>thought was worse than they thought and<br>therefore was likely to persist for<br>longer so what the forecasters then do<br>is they take that analysis of the<br>economy as a whole and they project it<br>forward and they say well what does that<br>mean for the government's revenue and<br>the simple fact is this when an economy<br>is slowing down a lot it means that<br>companies earn less so they pay less tax<br>uh and it means that there is less tax<br>being collected in the economy as a<br>whole so regardless of who is in<br>government and whatever choices they<br>make they would have en encountered a<br>situation in this budget where there is<br>less Revenue into the future now you're<br>right at that juncture there is a choice<br>what the government could do is it could<br>say well we don't want to do any more<br>borrowing so instead we're going to<br>dramatically reduce our spending we're<br>going to reduce spending on hospitals on<br>schools and Law and Order and we thought<br>that that was the wrong thing to do and<br>I stand by that<br>decision instead what we did was we said<br>well given this situation we're going to<br>spend less as a whole and so what we did<br>was we Revisited the spending plans of<br>the previous labored<br>government uh and we said that's not<br>viable anymore because we were told if<br>you stuck to those big spending plans<br>the books would remain in deficit uh for<br>a decade until<br>2031 and we said well that's not okay so<br>we will spend less so we reduced the<br>spending down both this year from 3.5<br>billion to 3.2 billion an additional<br>spending but also on future years and so<br>the impact of that<br>is that we can now forecast we will get<br>the books Back in Balance by the 2728<br>Financial year several years earlier<br>than what have otherwise been the case<br>and we can reduce the amount of<br>borrowing so that overall we're spending<br>$5.5 billion doar less so yes there's<br>been an economic downturn and yes that<br>has an impact on the books uh but we<br>have taken responsible decisions I think<br>to have gone further uh would have meant<br>um cuts to public services that I don't<br>think new new zealanders uh would have<br>necessary hi my name is Hayden and I'm a<br>first year Commerce student at Victoria<br>and my question is how does the<br>government intend to address affl<br>inflation while simultaneously boosting<br>economic output and how will the<br>government plan to achieve a budget<br>surplus in operating terms<br>uh so in terms of achieving uh a surplus<br>that's as I just discussed that uh we<br>see um a few components to that one is<br>trimming back the amount of additional<br>spending that we do in future budgets<br>which means that we can forecast uh a<br>surplus in future obviously as I said<br>earlier as I keept repeating that theme<br>it's also about if we grow the economy<br>faster uh then of course we'll have more<br>revenue and that would allow us to<br>return to Surplus faster too and I<br>always mention that because if we just<br>get blindly focused on the spending and<br>the revenue side we forget that if we<br>grow uh New Zealand then actually we<br>have better choices your second question<br>is about growing economic output and<br>what we know as I said is that in recent<br>times the economy uh has been very off<br>the boil uh and economic output has by<br>many measures been going backwards if<br>you look at per capita GDP which you<br>guys all understand stand um is a<br>measure of how much our economy uh how<br>big our economy is on a per population<br>basis we've been shrinking for about 18<br>months quite dramatically and so our job<br>that we see is to drive that economic<br>output by increasing the productive<br>capacity of the economy we have a<br>productivity plan in which we identify<br>five key things needed to achieve that<br>the first is better education and skills<br>it's a real problem uh that we have had<br>lower education and skills the second is<br>ensuring that we are delivering<br>infrastructure that supports growth the<br>third is making sure that we have a<br>better environment for doing business<br>with less red tape that allows people to<br>invest with more certainty the fourth is<br>driving overseas trade uh and capital<br>flows from around the world and the<br>final piece is making sure that our<br>science and Innovation System supports<br>uh businesses to inovate and<br>grow we've only got time for one more<br>back um do you have an<br>Instagram absolutely and can I just say<br>it is totally fine to be on Instagram<br>I'm on Instagram in fact I'm being<br>hassled today by Brian tamy about some<br>of the people I follow on Instagram um<br>it is totally fine to be on Instagram I<br>think what I'm just saying is be<br>critical thinkers um it's highly likely<br>that you could fact check anything I<br>said today and you could go and find<br>people who would have an alternative<br>view that is great that is what we<br>should have in a democracy is a large<br>range of views what I'm encouraging you<br>to do is before you accept an assertion<br>or an argument go and find out some<br>information of your own listen to the<br>other side of the story I'm I'm<br>passionate about the fact that for our<br>democracy to work we need people to have<br>uh views that are formed through as much<br>information as possible and with<br>critical thinking and if you're on<br>Instagram the thing I would encourage<br>you to do is to make sure that you're<br>also listening to the people who<br>disagree with the people you agree with<br>because it challenges us and it makes us<br>think better and it makes us uh more<br>critical thinkers and I take that upon<br>myself too to challenge myself uh and my<br>own views uh and I think it's actually a<br>really important part of government cuz<br>the general rule that I have is if a<br>decision comes to the desk of a minister<br>it's not an easy decision there will be<br>views on both sides and what we need to<br>do is weigh those views up so get your<br>information from a range of sources uh<br>so on on behalf of everyone uh Minister<br>I would like to thank you very much for<br>your discussion of the budget um your<br>openness to engage with the voters of<br>tomorrow um gathered in this room and<br>you're hosting of us um all here in in<br>the beehive thank you so very much it's<br>been a really interesting session and<br>thank you to all the students and<br>teachers who sent in questions um and<br>who actually asked them in the room and<br>uh those who will be watching the<br>recording I hope that you've enjoyed it<br>um taking part in a little bit of<br>democracy uh and come and challenge your<br>mind at Victoria University of<br>Wellington we'd love to see you at the<br>Wellington School of Business and<br>government in the future so Kiora and<br>Mata</p></main><footer style="margin-top: 2rem; background: #0001; padding: 2rem; text-align: center;"><p>We Are
