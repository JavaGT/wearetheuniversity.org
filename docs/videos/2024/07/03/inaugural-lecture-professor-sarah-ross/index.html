Women and poetry in the early modern world<br><br>What does early modern English poetry tell us about women? Where the poetry of Shakespeare and his male contemporaries gives us women as objects of desire or tragic collateral, early modern women writers and their large poetic corpus offer us complex performances of gendered interiority, social and political acuity, and aesthetic range and brilliance. <br>In this inaugural lecture, Professor Sarah Ross reflects on a career recuperating the poetry of early modern women and explores the implications of expanding the canon in global contexts and in Aotearoa New Zealand.</p><h2>Transcript</h2><p style="opacity: 0.9; font-size: 0.8em">Transcripts

pleasure to welcome you all<br>here this evening to welcome Sarah's<br>friends and family to welcome our<br>distinguished guests our academic and<br>professional staff colleagues our<br>students and our wider Community to this<br>the inaugural lecture of Sarah Ross<br>professor of English literature<br>inaugural lectures one of the great<br>pleasures of working in a university<br>it's a moment where we can pause and<br>take time to celebrate one of our own<br>achieving the very highest academic Rank<br>and then forcing them to give a lecture<br>like they've never given a lecture<br>before and calling it inaugural and<br>today we are listening to the inaugural<br>lecture of Sarah Ross professor of<br>English<br>literature we get to live a little bit<br>vicariously this evening through Sarah's<br>achievements Sarah began her studies in<br>Christ Church completing a Bachelor of<br>Arts in English and history before<br>heading off to Oxford University where<br>she completed a master's in research<br>methods in English and a PhD more<br>importantly she met her husband Andrew<br>wst in Oxford and um they initially<br>connected at the new as New Zealand<br>students as kiwi students studying<br>abroad and as Sarah said it sounds very<br>high-minded but actually they met at an<br>Australian New Zealand Society drinks at<br>the only nightclub in Oxford which is<br>not desperately high-m minded at all<br>more importantly though Sarah says that<br>she is very lucky to have pursued her<br>career so far alongside Andrew and their<br>two children who are here this evening<br>Millie and Henry and she would also like<br>to acknowledge her parents Sue and<br>Campbell Ross who set her off on this<br>journey and her academic Journey took<br>her from Oxford then to the University<br>of Warick for a postto and then home to<br>Ala to Massie University in the lovely<br>paliston North and finally here to<br>tahanga Walker in<br>2013 now currently Sarah is the head of<br>school for our very pithy named School<br>of English film theater media and<br>communication and art history and you<br>want to watch where you get the Oxford<br>tras in that little lot and her field of<br>expertise is poetry Renaissance<br>literature and in particular early<br>modern women's<br>writing amongst her teaching activity<br>here she teaches a course on gender and<br>literature which explores histories of<br>gender and sexuality in literary Works a<br>key focus of hers is to recover<br>marginalized voices and marginalized<br>stories if you ask Sarah what she<br>believes the University to be students<br>are absolutely at the center of her<br>answer which is this the university is a<br>hub of research and knowledge creation<br>thriving alongside new generations of<br>students and thinkers they ask us new<br>questions keep us flexible and Inspire<br>us daily in return we offer them<br>guidance explore ideas and ask new<br>questions<br>together alongside her teaching of<br>course Sarah has a distinguished<br>research record she's received Awards<br>and acknowledgements during her career<br>that are far too many to comprehensively<br>catalog this evening but a few include<br>the society for the study of early<br>modern women and genders Award for best<br>teaching Edition published in<br>of early modern women's writing in<br>English published in<br>2022 received the Roland bainton prize<br>for reference from the 16th century<br>Society we are blessed this evening that<br>Sarah will share some of her passion for<br>her discipline with us giving us a sense<br>of what Drew her in to early modern<br>literature and exploring the ways that<br>it speaks to all of us it is my very<br>great pleasure to introduce professor<br>Sarah<br>T thank you so much for being here this<br>evening um once you get to this position<br>you've given a lot of lectures uh by<br>definition um but none of them is quite<br>like this and uh in large part that's<br>because of you this um terrifying but<br>glorious mange of people from all<br>different parts of my life um including<br>I think some from the very beautiful<br>paliston north um from Oxford uh<br>colleagues uh mentors uh students past<br>and present who I've seen coming up the<br>stairs uh and my family uh as well uh<br>thank you yeah the weather has tested<br>your metal but you're<br>here um just before I begin I do want in<br>particular to acknowledge my family uh<br>this structural gown was a graduation<br>gift from my parents and every time I<br>put it on which is usually May and<br>December for graduation it is a material<br>enveloping reminder of everything that<br>our families uh provide for us the role<br>of ourano in our educations and I'm<br>going to be talking a lot tonight about<br>how we acquire our bodies of knowledge<br>uh our modes of thinking our approaches<br>to the world uh in that context my<br>mother was my um fifth former English<br>teacher and a very fine one at that um<br>perhaps even more importantly she was a<br>teacher librarian uh and so my Summers<br>consisted of reading all of the<br>Acquisitions for the school library<br>before they were shelved um my father<br>was also an educator in English at<br>paliston North Teachers College and<br>those of you who know about my obsession<br>with the beauty of the Perfectly Used<br>semicolon um that's my father's<br>Legacy so I'm delighted to be giving<br>this lecture um with my parents here<br>Andrew and our two children um I have<br>spent a lot of time in the last couple<br>of decades at libraries and archives<br>very long Plane Rides Away uh and um I'm<br>very grateful for everything that you've<br>done to make that<br>possible so I'm going to begin and I'm<br>going to begin tonight with what we all<br>know of early modern English literature<br>Shakespeare The Bard the<br>genius Shakespeare was a poet and a<br>dramatist and a rampant commercial<br>success in the theater world of London<br>in the 1590s and the first decade of the<br>1600s his complete works were published<br>in<br>1623 and in the preface to that volume<br>Ben Johnson described Shakespeare as<br>being not of an age but for all time<br>time my students know this phrase well<br>because it encapsulates so much of how<br>we have come to think about Shakespeare<br>his Works occupy a position of unrivaled<br>centrality in the Canon so by the Canon<br>um I mean the works that we think of as<br>high status worthy of study and<br>Shakespeare is Central to the Canon even<br>as that centrality is being contested so<br>I'm sure you all remember the kafuffle<br>in 2022 when creative New Zealand uh<br>withdrew funding for the Sheila win<br>Shakespeare Festival and jinda arun's<br>government stepped in and in just the<br>last couple of weeks the Shakespeare<br>debate has hotted up again uh with<br>Elizabeth rat's proposal Elizabeth R ET<br>Al's proposal that Shakespeare should<br>once again be compulsory in the senior<br>NCA English<br>syllabus I'm going to return to this<br>briefly at the end of this evening but<br>for now I'm using Shakespeare to locate<br>us in the early modern world because I<br>want first of all to suggest that the<br>ongoing hold of Shakespeare on our<br>imaginations is only in part about<br>Shakespeare in part I suggest the appeal<br>of Shakespeare is the appeal of the<br>early modern or what we sometimes call<br>the Renaissance this cultural movement<br>that swept across Western Europe from<br>the 13th through 17th centuries<br>cultural historians describe this as the<br>early modern period because it<br>encapsulates so much of how we think<br>about ourselves as modern human beings<br>so the Scientific Revolution uh<br>religious descent and a new focus on the<br>human rather than the Divine and so we<br>get works like Shakespeare's plays with<br>teenagers like Romeo and Juliet and<br>literature hadn't really given us teenag<br>before<br>or Hamlet who is memorably described by<br>the literary critic William Gus as<br>unique entirely himself as if he had a<br>self to<br>be so Hamlet is just a character right<br>he's just a fiction he's just LS on a<br>page and then a body on the stage but we<br>believe in him as if he is a real human<br>being he's fully<br>rounded these are examples of the<br>humanism that underpins our sense of the<br>Humanities which of course uh are the<br>University here in oura we are<br>inheritors of multiple cultural<br>traditions and as part of this the early<br>modern world retains extraordinary<br>cultural power as a pivot point in how<br>we think about ourselves as humans and<br>how art including literature has<br>represented The Human Condition<br>so tonight I'm inviting you to dwell as<br>I have done for the duration of my<br>research career in the early<br>modern and in doing so I want to give<br>you a sense of what happens when we<br>complicate and diversify our focus of<br>inquiry what is at stake and what are<br>the rewards if we not only interrogate<br>these extraordinary<br>Creations but we also consider what they<br>are<br>not what what happens if we consider<br>Shakespeare as being of an age of a sex<br>of a race and more than that of a<br>particular experience and education in<br>Elizabeth and grammar schools and<br>theater worlds that meant he wrote only<br>particular kinds of stories that he<br>wrote only particular characters<br>particular athetics that also wielded<br>extraordinary exclusionary power<br>what are the early modern stories that<br>Shakespeare does not<br>tell so I'm going to explore these<br>questions tonight uh in a way that I<br>think is becoming tradition for pro<br>profesori women of<br>2022 Maria bar gave us four stories uh<br>my colleague Nikki hisle gave us four<br>lessons uh I'm going to give you four<br>phases four phases in my career that map<br>onto phases in my field of research<br>early modern women's<br>writing and I want to give give you a<br>sense of how the questions that I've<br>articulated have informed my work and<br>that of others how they shift how we<br>think about the early<br>modern and how they can shift how we<br>think about ourselves Here and Now Aro<br>New Zealand<br>2024 that's<br>all so phase one the<br>questions in<br>1993 I was a seconde student at the<br>University of Canterbury sitting in a<br>Renaissance literature class and it was<br>not Shakespeare who spoke to me across<br>the ages but his contemporary John dun<br>who was the dean of St Paul's Cathedral<br>and a preacher<br>extraordinaire so dun's sermons were<br>among the most uh bought uh read<br>circulated works of early modern England<br>and you know them uh whether you think<br>you do or not so no man is an island um<br>do not ask for whom the bell TOS it TOS<br>for thee those are done so<br>sermons but his reputation now rests as<br>much on his poetry including love poetry<br>that was only partially acknowledged in<br>his lifetime because it was too raish um<br>too erotic for a reverend man so dun's<br>love poetry was bold it was<br>conversational and it was consumated he<br>left behind him the unrequited love of<br>the Elizabethan sers and in contrast he<br>gave us the bedroom busy old fool unruly<br>son why Dost thou thus through windows<br>and through curtains call on us notice<br>that us and notice the thou and I and we<br>of another done poem Waking with a lover<br>at dawn I wonder by my trth what thou<br>and I did till we loved he's not talking<br>to the son he is talking to the lover<br>were we not weaned till then but sucked<br>on Country Pleasures<br>childishly or snorted we in the seven<br>sleepers Den was so but this except for<br>this except for this bedroom all<br>pleasures fancies be if any ever any<br>beauty I did see which I desired and got<br>was but a dream of thee and now good<br>tomorrow to our waking Souls so these<br>are gorgeous poems right they are<br>conversational they are consumated we<br>were told at the University of<br>Canterbury in<br>1993 but then our Professor David gunby<br>to her I'm eternally F went a step too<br>far here he told us we have at last a<br>poet in conversation with a real woman<br>and those were his exact words a real<br>woman and so unfilled the beginnings of<br>my lifelong<br>objection because quite frankly where is<br>she right she is thou she is part of the<br>male speakers we but who is she Beyond<br>those pronouns does she share the<br>speaker's sense of sexual satisfaction<br>Maybe may she doesn't maybe she's you<br>know lying there freaking out wondering<br>whether to do a runner who is she what<br>does she read how does she think so here<br>there is no sense of her having a to<br>be very famously and some of my students<br>in the room know this um very famously D<br>was in fact taken to task by another<br>poet about another poem that he wrote<br>that featured an ideal perfect saintly<br>14-year-old girl and in his letter back<br>to that poet Dunn confesses that the<br>poem was not about the girl as she was<br>woman I love ideas but I don't like to<br>be one and so we come to phase two the<br>evidence in<br>1996 we were all still reading as by<br>its's possession which had won the book<br>of prize in 1990 and if you haven't read<br>it must it's a very beguiling uh story<br>of a woman literature Professor who<br>discovers the previously unknown work of<br>a Victorian woman writer and there's a<br>love story along the way um here is<br>Gwyneth ptro in the later film doing<br>that work um because we all read<br>invaluable manuscripts at home by the<br>fire with our love interests um and here<br>am I uh doing essential research at a<br>similar um period of<br>time I cannot deny that this novel held<br>some claim on my 22-year-old imagination<br>as I sit off to Oxford to begin my<br>doctoral<br>studies because possession actually<br>captures something of a Zeitgeist in the<br>late 1980s second wve feminists and<br>literary historians had turned hard to<br>the archive looking for work by women<br>writers that had Lain unnoticed in<br>manuscript letters Diaries private<br>household libraries for C<br>CES many of us imagined ourselves as<br>descendants in scholarly Sisterhood of<br>Virginia wolf who famously declared in<br>1929 that she knew of no Renaissance<br>women writers stumped by what she<br>claimed to be the absence of women in<br>the archive she very influentially<br>imagined Judith Shakespeare a tragic<br>sister to the better known William and<br>in Wolf Smith as many of you will know<br>Judith sh Shakespeare dies thwarted and<br>alone and is buried anonymously below a<br>tram stop at the elephant and<br>Castle it's a very influential story but<br>it's another<br>fiction and the mid90s was a h time to<br>be a budding scholar of real early<br>modern women's writing I arrived in<br>Oxford just as a large scale project got<br>underway um the Project's name was pator<br>named not after the Shakespeare<br>character but because the name means<br>lost woman and it set out to find and<br>catalog all pieces of writing and<br>manuscript by women between uh 1500 and<br>1700 my own doctoral thesis um completed<br>at this time comprised three case<br>studies of women whose manuscript poetry<br>was at that point barely known so lady<br>Anne SEL was uh an English woman living<br>in Ireland and London who w poetry<br>includes elegies on friends and kings<br>and princes and a very lengthy series of<br>poems um philosophical poems based on<br>the Ten Commandments uh and they're<br>quite a lot more fun than that might<br>sound Hester palter uh we discovered was<br>the daughter of Sir James Lee uh chief<br>justice under King James I her poems had<br>sat unread for centuries most recently<br>misc cataloged under sermons at the<br>University of leed's<br>library and my third case study was<br>Katherine Austin whose manuscript I went<br>on to edit for publication in<br>2011 Austin was a gentle woman Widow in<br>the<br>1660s she fought for her son's<br>inheritance at the Court of Chancery she<br>had business interests in the East India<br>Company she accounted for her finances<br>and in her poetry she accounted for her<br>sins these women are busy engaged and<br>diverse they're Society women mothers<br>Widows real women in the world and<br>that's the idea behind the image that I<br>chose to advertise this lecture um this<br>is Dutch rather than English but these<br>women here are Regent tessers and the<br>Bon murder or head Mistress of a lepers<br>asylum in Amsterdam in the 1620s and I<br>just love the way that this image<br>encapsulates women in the world you know<br>with responsibilities uh overseeing<br>finances domestic economies charitable<br>economies uh in some control of their<br>and others Affairs so we don't have any<br>portraits of Soule or pter or Austin but<br>they were women in the world too and<br>they create poetic voices that reflect<br>their<br>experiences so that recovery work of the<br>80s and '90s that my doctoral studies<br>were part of has transformed the terms<br>in which we're able to think about women<br>and writing in the early modern world or<br>I should say is transforming because one<br>of the things that I've learned over the<br>decades is that good things really do<br>take time uh it is one thing to find a<br>poem in the<br>archive it's another to transcribe it to<br>modernize to punctuate it it's another<br>again to annotate it to work out what a<br>poet was reading who they knew what<br>they're referring to what his historical<br>events large or small might be traced in<br>a piece of text we read our Shakespeare<br>in a penguin Classics Edition or an<br>Arden or a Cambridge or the great big<br>Norton complete works these volumes have<br>got centuries of scholarship behind them<br>and that scholarship is a little bit<br>like case law right has created this web<br>of references and contested<br>interpretations generating that web<br>takes decades if not centuries and it's<br>only recently the early modern women's<br>writing has begun to accumulate<br>scholarship multiple additions contested<br>interpretations additions like your<br>great big Norton or your penguin<br>Classics are also commercial entities<br>and persuading Publishers that early<br>modern women's writing will sell uh has<br>not always been an easy task one of my<br>Publications that gives me greatest joy<br>is this teaching edition of women Poets<br>of English Civil War that was completed<br>with my collaborator um Elizabeth Scott<br>Bowman and championed by the Valiant<br>Matthew Frost at Manchester University<br>PR uh press um and I know that this<br>volume is used in classrooms all over<br>the<br>world online Technologies are also now<br>providing stunning platforms for making<br>texts available so this is the pter<br>project uh based in Chicago it's an<br>online edition of all of polter's poetry<br>and it was launched in 2018 22 years<br>after I was first working on<br>polter digital methodologies are also<br>underpinning some of the most exciting<br>recent developments in the field the<br>ability to think at last about women's<br>writing at scale to move Beyond those<br>few case studies those individual women<br>um that my doctoral work focused on to<br>interrogate instead patterns and habits<br>and Trends so this is part of the um the<br>the landing page it keeps going but it's<br>cut off this is I'm part of the landing<br>page of the online index that has come<br>out of my recent early modern women's<br>complaint poetry project with rosalin<br>Smith and Mitchell whitew at a&amp;u<br>Michelle O Calahan at reading and our<br>own Jake Arthur uh who is here tonight I<br>am going to tell you later tonight what<br>complaint poetry is but for now I just<br>want you to look at all of those colored<br>dots everyone represents a poem um by a<br>woman and the colors visualize these<br>poems according to subtypes so that we<br>can see what sort of complaint poems<br>women<br>wrote and this stunning visualization is<br>not mine uh but that of my collaborator<br>Ros Smith on another project and she is<br>representing here marginalia are<br>markings by women in their books so if<br>you write in your books you might be<br>studied like this in 400 years time um<br>but she's looking here for patterns of<br>annotation and so we arrive at phase<br>three which I'm calling<br>interpretation what are the<br>understandings of women and poetry in<br>the early modern world that this<br>cumulative scholarship makes possible<br>what are the stories that these texts<br>tell<br>early modern women poets give us moving<br>maternal allergies like this one I'm<br>just giving you a fragment but philli<br>grapples here with seven years 80 months<br>twice 40 months of<br>infertility followed by child loss and<br>whether or not poetry has the capacity<br>sufficiently to express grief tears are<br>my muse and sorrow all my heart so<br>piercing groans<br>allergy women give us more grief uh and<br>anger at the imprisonment and then<br>execution of King Charles during the<br>English Civil<br>War so in this fragment um the speaker<br>is the river TS personified she recalls<br>Her Sacred sovereign's barge riding upon<br>her Waters and she deplores the<br>Kingdom's scourges and the city's Pride<br>by which she means the parliamentarians<br>who have imprisoned King Charles and who<br>her women give us poetry of friendship<br>like<br>this come my idelia to the SP where<br>kindly mixing Souls a while let's<br>innocently spend an hour and at all<br>serious Folly smile here is no<br>quarreling for crowns no fear of changes<br>in Our Fate no trembling at the great<br>one SP not any slavery of State in such<br>a scorching age as this whoever would<br>not seek a shade deserve their happiness<br>to miss as having their own peace<br>betrayed but we of one another's mind<br>assured the boisterous World disdain<br>with quiet souls and unconfined enjoy<br>what princes wish in<br>vain this poem is articulated so<br>deliberately through the language of<br>John Dunn's love poetry mingling souls<br>are into Assurance of the mind that we<br>must I think read it as lesbian before<br>that term exists in<br>English women give us science astrology<br>and philosophy and they give us<br>religious poems like this one Mary<br>Sydney's extraordinary translation of<br>Psalm 22 which will be both deeply<br>familiar to you and utterly new in its<br>Exquisite Rhythm rhyme repetition and<br>pacing my God my God why hast thou me<br>forsaken woe me from me why is thy<br>presence taken so far from seeing mine<br>unhealthful eyes so far from hearing to<br>my roaring cries oh God my God I cry<br>while day appear Earth but God thy ear<br>my crying never heareth oh God the night<br>is privy to my plain yet to my plain<br>women write a lot of religious poems uh<br>not least because girls didn't go to<br>Elizabeth and grammar schools or act in<br>the theater worlds that I mentioned at<br>the opening of this<br>lecture I think many of you will know<br>this but some of you may not<br>Shakespeare's stage was woman free a<br>women didn't act on The Shakespearean<br>stage they didn't act on the commercial<br>stage until after 1660 so all of those<br>women's parts were played by Boy<br>actors and because girls were female<br>they didn't sit in classrooms practicing<br>translations from Latin and Greek like<br>Shakespeare and his male contempories<br>did they didn't go to<br>universities they didn't follow the<br>educational syllabus of<br>humanism that underpins the Renaissance<br>As we think of<br>it so that humanism that I began with<br>that sense of having a self to be is<br>something that girls and women learned a<br>slant being female meant that they<br>occupied very different positions to<br>boys and men in relation to what we call<br>cultural capital so the dominant<br>narratives ways of thinking of their<br>time if girls were very elite they might<br>have learned Classical Languages and<br>literature from tutors in their great<br>country houses and Mary Sydney for<br>example translated from French Latin<br>Italian uh and possibly Greek and Hebrew<br>but she was<br>exceptional and to find out more about<br>what girls and women read what they<br>learned we need to look at things like<br>instructional manuals uh the books that<br>they owned and Wroten hence Rosa's<br>marginalia project or for example we can<br>look to evidence of music lessons that<br>they were given in the home uh these are<br>extracts from music books uh compiled by<br>girl girls and women are in the early<br>17th century they're full of tunes and<br>they're full of poems because the worlds<br>of music and poetry are fundamentally<br>overlap so the records and artifacts of<br>girls and women's cultural acquisition<br>are dispersed they fragmentary and<br>they're<br>intriguing this kind of ongoing<br>contextual work has gathered<br>considerable momentum in the field<br>because it deepens our web of<br>understanding it gives us insight into<br>the literary and cultural models that<br>inform women's poetic voices because as<br>you've seen early modern women's poems<br>are not just personal they're not just<br>straightforwardly autobiographical they<br>voice the river Tims they adopt poetic<br>conventions from male love poetry they<br>uh write as the biblical King<br>David poems are Creations their fictions<br>they works of art and if I were just<br>looking for the straight voices of women<br>in the archive I would be a historian as<br>literary historians we're looking for<br>what sort of literature women wrote what<br>sort of art they created what are their<br>literary and cultural models is their<br>poetry different from that of<br>Shakespeare and<br>dun the answer to that question uh is a<br>calibrated<br>yes calibrated uh because the joy of<br>being in in phase three of this crazy<br>career<br>is being able to answer that question<br>with ever increasing Nuance the answer<br>is not always yes because being human is<br>complex right we all live in multiple<br>simultaneous overlapping contested<br>identities Mary Sydney was a woman uh<br>but she was also exceptionally Elite and<br>she was the sister of one of England's<br>most prominent poets so she had access<br>to mainstream cultural capital in a way<br>that other women didn't and her brother<br>brother wrote a whole lot of Psalm<br>translations too we just don't tend to<br>read them as much as we read<br>Shakespeare's plays<br>nowadays but in vital ways the answer is<br>yes early modern women very often write<br>differently from men they give us<br>mothers and lovers and rivers and others<br>who speak for themselves and who are far<br>more than the pretty creatures that are<br>gazed upon over and again in the Poetry<br>of canonical men<br>those are the pretty creatures of my<br>title take ailia in Shakespeare's Hamlet<br>who drowns herself in the River Run mad<br>because Hamlet has rejected her and<br>whose death is described in one of the<br>prettiest most lyrical passages in any<br>Shakespeare play it's gorgeous it's the<br>verse that launched a thousand preite<br>paintings like this one John Waterhouse<br>a is a beautiful<br>death or take Shakespeare's long poem<br>the rape of lucis studied taught<br>celebrated over<br>centuries the poem retells The Classical<br>story of lucrecia who is raped by Tarin<br>in the poem's first 750<br>lines for the next 1,000 lines we hear<br>Luca's pain as she bewails her fate<br>frantic with grief grief Desperately<br>Seeking any kind of<br>comfort I alone alone must sit and pine<br>she says and so she does like many<br>abused abandoned women in the great<br>texts of the literary<br>canon lucre's pain like aelia's is<br>exquisite it is aestheticized it's made<br>beautiful and we are invited by the poem<br>to look upon it this is female complaint<br>poetry okay not winging and moaning<br>the extended expression of Woe often in<br>the great literature of the past voiced<br>by abandoned Abused women who are<br>characters written by<br>men here is lucis at the center of<br>Shakespeare's poem at this point she is<br>wordless her verbal expression of<br>extreme grief is replaced here by tears<br>and she has been joined by her maid her<br>waiting Woman Who Weeps with<br>her a pretty wild these pretty creatures<br>stand like Ivory conut Coral systems<br>filling one justly weeps the other takes<br>on hand no cause but company of her<br>drops<br>spelling so here at last lucr has got<br>the Cainer that she's been looking for<br>for the last many lines her Maids<br>sympathizes with her we've been told in<br>lines just before this that the maid is<br>enjoined by<br>sympathy but we gaze upon them both as<br>objects they are curious exam exemplars<br>of their gentle<br>sex and see what that pronoun is doing<br>assuming that we The Listener the<br>audience are male their gentle sex are<br>willing to weep for each other they are<br>impressionable creatures who take on<br>each other's<br>pain we look on them as if they're an<br>ivory statue a pretty Fountain a work of<br>now until our early modern women's<br>complaint poetry project the accepted<br>wisdom in literary studies was that<br>women writers didn't write complaint<br>poetry the wisdom was that these sorts<br>of woeful women and their pretty pain<br>was written only by<br>men but as we've interrogated the<br>recuperated writings of women we have of<br>course discovered that the reality is<br>far more<br>complex early modern women do write<br>complaint there's that whole Corpus of<br>woeful grieving poems written by women<br>that are all those colored dots on the<br>index that I showed you and those poems<br>share a lot of features with complaint<br>poetry written by<br>men but here are a few things that I can<br>tell<br>you with some rare exceptions they don't<br>write complaints based on classical<br>stories after all they weren't<br>translating or practicing them in the<br>classroom with one exception in our<br>Corpus Mary Queen of Scots<br>they don't write complaint poetry about<br>rape and that's a difference well worth<br>dwelling<br>on and when women do write complaint<br>poems the positioning of the speaker and<br>the assumed audience in relation to the<br>woeful woman is often very different the<br>constellations of speakers and pronouns<br>that were seen from D to the rape of<br>lucre rearranged<br>themselves here is the opening of a<br>complaint poem by Hiser pter also<br>featuring two young women who are sad<br>together the cause of their sadness is<br>vague they beail their solitary Life<br>Time and sorrow and they deplore their<br>wants and<br>losses so notes to this poem I could<br>tell you that it was written in the<br>middle of the English Civil Wars when<br>pter and other supporters of the king<br>took lonely Refuge at their Country<br>Estates but I'm interested right now in<br>those pronouns those voices and the<br>positioning of the woeful women in the<br>poem the voices are those of the Two<br>Sisters<br>themselves we are listening to them and<br>they are listening to each other the<br>scene is pretty an and Penelope are<br>sitting in a sweet shade by a clear<br>pearling<br>stream uh and the sad Sycamore is not<br>unlike the willow of aelia's<br>death but in the setting the sisters<br>complain to each other in dialogue<br>unframed there's no male voice offering<br>commentary about their gentle sex inste<br>instead they sit and they help filel the<br>female Nightingale to sing and they<br>become a concort a choir raising their<br>voices together uh in a complaint<br>Collective and uh no woman is Left<br>Behind at the end of the poem and<br>there's a whole chunk missing in the<br>middle there um young Anne is boosted by<br>all the sharing of Woe she feels rather<br>better she's no longer of a mind to die<br>uh and she recommends that the two<br>sisters now go to their sad mother to<br>alone and so I arrive lastly at phase<br>four and this is a phase of<br>place it's about being here in Aro New<br>Zealand in<br>2024 because I want to spend a little<br>bit of time in conclusion uh reflecting<br>explicitly on what it means to do this<br>sort of work here the directions in<br>which I look as a scholar and how this<br>material enables us to think to teach<br>Converse and be both AS Global Citizens<br>uh and as Citizens and Educators here<br>and our own very special and very<br>particular<br>society so I think it's pretty clear by<br>now um that the work I do is a kind of<br>deep diversity<br>work it aims to create new knowledge<br>know about authors and texts we haven't<br>been aware of until now and it also aims<br>to create new knowledge about cultural<br>acquisition uh production Aesthetics<br>what we value as<br>art but that diversity work looks in at<br>least two directions simultaneously<br>because early modern women's writing in<br>English looks very different to<br>different audiences in different parts<br>of the world I want I want to think<br>about how very often um we as Humanity<br>Scholars here speak both to a global<br>community and to one that is<br>distinctively our own so to do this I'm<br>going to share with you um and I hope<br>this doesn't seem strange but it's too<br>late now I'm going to share with you um<br>two different reviews of my work in<br>recentish years because these give<br>particular insight into culture<br>when women Poets of the English Civil<br>War was published in<br>2018 it was reviewed on the times<br>literary supplement alongside three<br>other recent books on early modern women<br>the reviewer Diane perkus herself did<br>early important work in the field at<br>least 15 years ahead of me and her<br>frustration at a lack of traction on<br>mainstream literary studies in the UK is<br>absolutely<br>palpable women writers of the early<br>modern period have been introduced and<br>reintroduced and introduced again as if<br>the mainstream early modernists were<br>deaf or very forgetful elderly uncles<br>the diligent Specialists and early<br>modern women's writing keep finding new<br>ways to frame their introductions in the<br>hope that this time something might<br>stick here are four more books making<br>freshed hint to be<br>heard perus goes on to explore some of<br>the poems that we include in the<br>Anthology and then she concludes with<br>more bleakness these gems came from the<br>editor's careful reading of hitherto<br>unprinted manuscripts women Poets of the<br>English Civil War is scrupulously<br>scholarly and the ancillary materials it<br>offers optimistically directed at the<br>general public with even more optimism<br>they suggest that their Anthology could<br>be used alongside a mainstream anthology<br>of early modern poetry I sincerely hope<br>their optimism is<br>Justified so obviously when you see<br>optimism three times in a paragraph you<br>know that um the reviewer doesn't share<br>your outlook and as I'm sure you can<br>imagine we took objection to being<br>called diligent and scrupulous and<br>careful and I trust you all know those<br>are words that you must not use in<br>references for young women um but I<br>understand perus of<br>cynicism that's why I've put it here I<br>understand her cynicism I recognize its<br>causes because she's based at a<br>University Oxford in a society England<br>where the cultural centrality of<br>Shakespeare atal is not for a minute<br>contested I am optimistic and that<br>optimism is bolstered and Justified<br>every day because I work here in a<br>context where women writers and Marty<br>writers and others are in our classrooms<br>from the first trimester of the first<br>year I work in a context where our<br>perspectives on the Western European<br>past demand that we ask different<br>questions both in our classrooms and in<br>our<br>scholarship so this is a different<br>review in 2021 of some of our early work<br>on women's complaint poetry and the<br>reviewer comments um while we're<br>complaining um might I observe that the<br>archives utilized in this volume are<br>mostly held in British libraries which<br>means that most of us in UK universities<br>have been sitting on these manuscripts<br>and printed tracks all the while<br>we were asserting the received wisdom it<br>took the contributors of this volume too<br>many listed there to to to include and<br>funding from two non-uk research bodies<br>to reveal this rich and unrecognized<br>body of work by early modern British<br>women so that's a shout out to the maom<br>fund and to the Australian research<br>Council and I'll leave you to read the<br>reviewer's reflections there on digital<br>methodologies and geographical dispersal<br>so the work that we do here on the<br>European past and not just myself is<br>vital on the global stage we have<br>something unique to add and that's not<br>about margins talking to centers it's<br>about breaking down that<br>binary it's about having the<br>intellectual spaciousness and yes<br>optimism to ask different questions to<br>conceive of access to cultural resources<br>in different terms and always to contest<br>centrality here in AOA I don't believe<br>we need or want to throw away sh<br>Shakespeare at uh atal Al<br>together I'm not convinced that<br>Shakespeare needs to be compulsory in<br>schools but the popularity and the<br>Vitality of the Sheila win Festival is<br>Testament to the ongoing delight and<br>Challenge and complexity and yes<br>relevance that our young people find in<br>those plays over 4,000 school students a<br>year participate in that festival and<br>that's a really amazing engagement with<br>a vital thread of our cultural<br>past but I derive optimism every day<br>from the sorts of questions that we ask<br>here I look for example um to our newly<br>started doctoral student Austin Hayes up<br>there um who is looking among other<br>things at translations of Shakespeare in<br>the M School room and tooto College in<br>the 1880s what does cultural capital and<br>acquisition mean in that<br>context I looked to Nicola Highland and<br>Lucas Neil's brilliant 300 level uh<br>theater production just a few weeks ago<br>of Afro Ben's play the Rover so they<br>took a play by a woman from the 1680s<br>and they made it mean here quite<br>spectacularly even though they did have<br>to rewrite the ending a little and I'm<br>in awe of the inspiring scholarship of<br>my colleague Nikki hle whose work on<br>British Romantic Poets pushes us Beyond<br>Wordsworth Keats atow into indigenous<br>translations indigenous uses of British<br>romantic poetry and now into the Poetics<br>of treaty<br>making so in this context uh in our<br>context early modern English women<br>writers can feel quite un radical right<br>they're old they're white they're quite<br>Elite and they're very culturally<br>foreign<br>how diverse are we actually<br>talking but in our context early modern<br>women's writing the history of its<br>recovery its methodologies its<br>theorization provides one model for why<br>and how we put and keep putting pressure<br>on assumptions about<br>centrality in our context the Canon<br>Shakespeare exists only in tension with<br>that which has conventionally been<br>excluded and that which it has<br>overridden and that's an incredibly<br>productive tension it makes us read<br>different writers and it makes us read<br>Shakespeare<br>differently early modern women's writing<br>is a field in its own right and it is<br>one that sits alongside and engages with<br>others so premodern critical race<br>studies that looks for black lives in<br>the English archives you know let's go<br>beyond a fellow Sadia Hartman on the<br>Silence of the archives to the voices of<br>slaves traded across the Atlantic and<br>work that seeks queer and trans voices<br>in The Art of the past and it sits<br>alongside our own particular cultural<br>work of elevating Mii and Pacifica<br>literary forms and modes and exploring<br>those as vital parts of our cultural<br>Traditions so it's time to finish uh but<br>as I hope you can see there's plenty of<br>work yet to<br>do we could quote L Manuel Miranda's<br>Hamilton it matters who lives whoes who<br>tells our<br>story but more than that it matters<br>whose stories we look for in the art of<br>the past because we are all products of<br>different cultural experiences and<br>values and the art we celebrate the<br>Aesthetics we value are the product of<br>particular ages races Sexes genders<br>social cultural educational<br>experiences a more nuanced version of<br>the humanist past gives us a richer<br>sense of ourselves it helps us to turn<br>down the voices of those in power and<br>pay attention to those who are less<br>heard it helps us to understand better<br>humanity and the multiple ways in which<br>humans have told stories about<br>themselves and the worlds that they live<br>in tenot tenot<br>Ros<br>uh good evening everyone I'm Professor<br>Sarah liot I'm the dean of the faculty<br>of humanities and social sciences tah UI<br>and it's my privilege this evening to<br>offer the vote of thanks on behalf of us<br>all to Sarah Ross for her inaugural<br>lecture of as professor of English<br>literature at teahing aaka Victoria<br>University of<br>Wellington Professor Sarah Ross is<br>recognized nationally and<br>internationally as a world leading<br>scholar of Renaissance and early modern<br>women's writing and her inaugural<br>lecture this evening has undisputedly<br>confirmed that this High reputation is<br>Thoroughly<br>deserved in her lecture Sarah has<br>provided a space to focus on the world<br>of early modern England the world of<br>William Shakespeare and John Dunn of<br>course but also the world of those whose<br>stories and voices were not heard due to<br>the exclusionary power of prevailing<br>Aesthetics in particular particular the<br>voices of early modern woman<br>poets in her lecture Sarah has taken us<br>on a fascinating journey through four<br>phases of a highly successful career<br>from early questions of where is she who<br>is she to the important recovery work of<br>the evidence phase to the scholarly<br>interpretations of the literary<br>Creations woman of this period produced<br>the stories they chose to tell through<br>to a reflection on place on what it<br>means to do this work here in Alo and<br>New Zealand and to contest assumptions<br>about what constitutes cultural<br>centrality Sarah's work reflects the<br>very best of Humanity's research it<br>brings together painstaking archival<br>work that uncovers little known or long<br>lost material with detailed and careful<br>scholarship and formed by a rich<br>knowledge and understanding of 17th<br>century literature politics and religion<br>and a deep commitment to creating new<br>knowledge about authors and texts and<br>more broadly about questions of cultural<br>acquisition and<br>production the scholarship that Sarah<br>has produced in her career to date has<br>without doubt played a key role in<br>challenging accepted wisdom in the field<br>of early modern<br>literature her work has served to<br>recover and make visible woman's wide<br>ranging and diverse poetic production<br>from religious poems to maternal<br>allergies from poetry of friendship to<br>philosophical<br>ruminations her work has also debunked<br>the long-held belief that complaint<br>poetry was the sole domain of male poets<br>when in fact a rich Corpus exists that<br>while sharing some features of complaint<br>poetry by men importantly presents a<br>different positioning of the woeful<br>woman in those poems moreover the use of<br>digital Technologies and methodologies<br>by Sarah and her colleagues to make<br>women's complaint poetry widely<br>accessible is a remarkable contribution<br>to the field enabling the study of<br>women's writing on a greater scale and<br>contributing to the recasting of the<br>poetic and political histories of 17th<br>century<br>England through her beautiful reading<br>and insightful analysis Sarah has<br>Illustrated the value of a nuanced<br>humanistic approach that pays greater<br>attention to those who are heard less<br>but that aside what Sarah has also given<br>us this evening is a moment to inhabit<br>and absorb some powerful poetry read and<br>discussed very eloquently by a<br>world-renowned<br>expert this evening's lecture has also<br>reminded us how extraordinarily<br>fortunate we are to have this<br>world-renowned expert as a scholar<br>colleague and academic leader at this<br>University Professor Sarah Ross is an<br>outstanding member of our faculty and<br>University communities who is a role<br>model for women academics within and<br>Beyond her discipline she sets an<br>inspiring<br>standard it's now my pleasure to invite<br>everyone to stay and join us for<br>Refreshments through in the hunter<br>common room but before we adjourn there<br>please ad join me in again thanking<br>Professor Sarah Ross for an excellent<br>inaugural lecture</p></main><footer style="margin-top: 2rem; background: #0001; padding: 2rem; text-align: center;"><p>We Are The University</p><ul style="list-style-type: none; padding: 0; margin: 0;"><li><a
