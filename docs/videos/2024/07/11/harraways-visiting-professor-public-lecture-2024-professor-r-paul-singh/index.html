the umbrella of the people of this<br>here to tonu to tonu and to the house<br>that stands here may you stand forever<br>and usually that's followed by the<br>health and safety warning that if there<br>is some doubt that the house is going to<br>continue to stand here forever then<br>please follow the instructions that you<br>in and I think particularly at this time<br>just past Miki let us remember those<br>that have passed and may they move uh to<br>iar uh that's appropriate tonight I'm<br>Scottish of background uh<br>uh<br>um and I work here at the University of<br>atago Co Richard Blakey taker I'm<br>Richard Blakey Deputy Vice Chancellor<br>research and Enterprise here at Oto F<br>ihaka the University of otago and it's<br>my great pleasure and privilege to<br>welcome you here tonight for this harway<br>visiting profess Professor lecture uh by<br>Professor Paul Singh welcome and welcome<br>to you um it is um my great pleasure to<br>um welcome you here for this lecture and<br>also to thank our distinguished guests<br>from har hero who have come along<br>tonight uh for both your presence here<br>to support the visiting lecturer but<br>also for your continued and ongoing<br>support of this very important<br>initiative to bring leading thinkers<br>from around the world here to aut denen<br>to work with us in an academic<br>environment but also to support things<br>that are of interest and relevance to<br>you so in particular uh to Ross Hudson<br>from the board T aqu Ross uh to um<br>uh to Henry uh the chief executive and<br>Peter the marketing manager UA and to<br>Duncan the product developer who's here<br>uh tin nak welcome welcome and welcome<br>to you all I do bring some apologies uh<br>firstly from our vice Chancellor our new<br>Vice Chancellor um honorable Grant<br>Robertson who gives his apologies he's<br>uh just had his first University council<br>meeting so is in recovery from that uh<br>and uh you know has some business to<br>attend to also very sincere apologies<br>from uh Pro Vice Chancellor division of<br>Sciences Professor Richard Barker who<br>would have very much liked to have been<br>here uh but he's not well tonight also<br>to welcome to uh members of uh the<br>department of Food Science and thank you<br>for your role in organizing this event<br>to other members of Faculty to students<br>to members of the public uh to people<br>all around the world and even people in<br>the future who may be watching this this<br>event no my Hari welcome to you all um<br>the format for the event is I'm going to<br>uh welcome the speaker we are then going<br>to have uh the the distinguished lecture<br>and I'm then going to um engage in some<br>Q&amp;A so I'll try and get out of the way<br>so we can get on with that uh that will<br>involve uh questions that are being able<br>to be delivered online so if you're<br>online you should have had instructions<br>drier okay so if you're online you<br>should have the an email address to<br>deliver those questions to we'll go back<br>and forward we'll try and repeat the<br>questions if if you're in the audience<br>and you've got a question just wait till<br>the microphone gets to you otherwise<br>we'll be repeating your question and<br>misre repeating your question many times<br>on the way through um if there and<br>there's no other housekeeping I believe<br>so it's now my great uh pleasure and<br>privilege to uh welcome Dr Singh to uh<br>deliver his lecture on framing the food<br>future of Our Food Systems in the area<br>of climate change which is particularly<br>ersite because you come from UCC where<br>you're currently in your home territory<br>under what is a new term for me a heat<br>Dome uh but that heat Dome I think<br>significantly uh has already delivered<br>record temperatures to many parts of<br>Inland us including in California Nevada<br>Arizona and May in fact if it is not<br>already delivered the hottest recorded<br>temperature ever on planet Earth Earth<br>and I think we have to um it's not it's<br>not a thing to celebrate but it is a<br>thing to recognize that we are living in<br>an era where climate change and<br>variability is with us it is evident to<br>all of us here in Otti uh and also in<br>particular in those areas of the the<br>world that are subject to very very<br>extreme changes of temperature so how do<br>we manage to feed our ourselves and our<br>future selves uh in the face of of uh<br>these um changes in our in our weather<br>systems and our climate systems it is<br>our particular pleasure to have you you<br>here tonight to talk us through some of<br>the systems and the Technologies we<br>might need you come from a particularly<br>distinguished background but also with<br>significant knowledge of New Zealand<br>having spent several of of your<br>sabatical periods here uh with our with<br>the RIT core that we are proudly a<br>member of um largely based at Massi<br>University you're currently a r r fellow<br>but in 20 2003 you were a William Evans<br>fellow here at the University of itago<br>so you know us well so welcome back uh<br>Paul is a distinguished Professor uh a<br>Meritus of food engineering at the<br>University of California at Davis<br>receiving his degrees in agricultural<br>engineering from Punjab agricultural<br>university University of Wisconsin<br>medicon and Michigan State<br>University Dr sing's research involves<br>using computational modeling to improve<br>food processes design novel food<br>processing equipment conserve energy and<br>water use in food processing improve the<br>shelf life of foods and study food<br>digestion for improved bio accessibility<br>of nutrients in the human<br>body as well as having extensive and<br>well-sited Publications he is a fellow<br>of The Institute of food technologists<br>the American Society of agricultural and<br>biological engineering and the<br>International Academy of Food Science<br>and Technology he received the kashida<br>international award in<br>2007 and the 2013 Massie Ferguson gold<br>medal for Education from the American<br>Society of agricultural and<br>bioengineering and in 2008 was elected<br>to the US National Academy of<br>engineering a very very prestigious<br>election in 2010 The Institute of food<br>technologists awarded him the Nicholas<br>appit award the highest food science<br>award in the United States in 2015 he<br>received the world agricultural prize<br>from from the confederation of higher<br>education associations for Agricultural<br>and Life<br>Sciences in 2018 he received a doctor of<br>science honorous kza from the University<br>of gal in Canada Dr Singh serves on the<br>food and nutrition Board of the US<br>National Academy of Sciences and is a<br>co-editor and chief of the Journal of<br>food engineering so it is my great<br>pleasure to welcome Professor Paul Singh<br>to present his 2024 Haro public lecture<br>please join me in welcoming to him to<br>the<br>stage thank you very much thank<br>you well thank you very much for that<br>kind<br>introduction and uh greetings to<br>everyone uh those of you who are of<br>course present here in person and those<br>who are<br>online um I would first like to take<br>this opportunity uh<br>uh to express my gratitude to harway uh<br>for making it possible for me to be here<br>this evening um uh I am deeply honored<br>by this recognition uh and humbled in<br>following the footsteps of the past U uh<br>Haro uh professors Professor Mark<br>Hendricks and Professor Ricky<br>yada um now I was actually supposed to<br>be here in 20 uh 20 right four years ago<br>uh but because of covid lockdown and of<br>course dates got uh uh changed uh I was<br>looking in my computer for my talk in<br>2020 um and I did find it but then I<br>realized that in four years things have<br>changed quite a bit so I did spend a<br>little bit more time to uh to change and<br>uh uh talk about some of the issues uh<br>that are becoming quite critical for<br>almost everyone around around the planet<br>uh certainly the food is of course<br>extremely important and the climate uh<br>change which is uh impacting almost<br>everyone around and as I was mentioned<br>uh when I left Davis on that day it was<br>about 40° C and then it temperatures<br>went higher so I'm very pleased to be<br>here in very nice temperatures here in<br>denen um so uh I will take this next 30<br>or 30 5 minutes uh and uh talk about our<br>modern food system um some of the<br>complexities uh that are there U uh also<br>multiple challenges that the food system<br>is uh facing uh we will talk about uh<br>circular bioeconomy uh I'll get into a<br>little bit more detail on that uh and in<br>the talk I will also uh note some of the<br>opportunities for young professionals<br>who are in uh the industry as well as<br>well as in Academia students uh who are<br>working on Research uh in some of these<br>topics so if we walk into a uh grocery<br>store uh this was in Davis uh very<br>similar here in Den Eden uh you note<br>that uh uh there's certainly abundance<br>of food uh that is on display um the uh<br>the main pillars of the food system is<br>to produce a safe<br>affordable nutritious uh and plentiful<br>food uh in a typical grocery store you<br>may have uh uh you know 30 40,000 items<br>uh and of course if you pick up a can of<br>tomatoes uh it's through a sply chain<br>that uh that uh can of tomatoes appeared<br>on that grocery store shelf uh the farm<br>to Fork as we often talk about starting<br>uh with the tomatoes being grown in the<br>field in fact this is only about 3 miles<br>from where I live uh California Northern<br>California is a quite a bit of uh tomato<br>growing goes on there uh so those<br>Tomatoes shipped into U the canning<br>plants uh where uh go through a certain<br>process uh and then of course um uh you<br>know you have the Shelf stable product<br>uh in a<br>can so if you look at this uh Farm to<br>for pork that we often talk about uh of<br>course it starts before that before that<br>production there is that pre-production<br>part that is where uh you know the<br>research goes on whether it's in the<br>Academia or in in the industry and<br>looking at the varieties uh as well as<br>uh agricultural practices and that<br>information gets to the uh Growers to<br>the farmers uh who of course grow that<br>product and uh and then it gets into the<br>supply chain uh<br>there is a smaller part that goes<br>through our farmers markets uh and then<br>of course the larger conventional supply<br>chain is where that product goes through<br>uh uh<br>transformation uh packaging um storage<br>then transport and all the way then to<br>retailing uh and of course then at home<br>cooking uh the product uh as well as in<br>cafeterias in restaurants to uh uh you<br>know in various other locations<br>restaurants and so<br>on and in that process uh there is of<br>course also food loss and food waste<br>that some of the topics that I will I<br>will talk about but these are the<br>activities and actors uh and they are<br>several drivers uh that are involved<br>here of course there is the demographics<br>uh in terms of the population uh there<br>is uh uh the socioeconomics uh related<br>to income distribution for certain<br>location that has an impact on the<br>system uh there are social cultural uh<br>such as preferences uh those have impact<br>on on the system and of course uh<br>through environment we know uh the<br>impact of climate change uh on on these<br>various activities uh uh and then U we<br>have the outcomes uh and those outcomes<br>involve our gain socioeconomic in terms<br>of uh uh employment creation uh food<br>availability comes under the food uh<br>security and nutrition aspects uh and<br>then again environment where U the<br>system generates uh greenhouse gas<br>emissions and that impacts the uh the<br>environment so looking at this food<br>system not only the environment impacts<br>the food system but uh the food system<br>itself also impacts the environment so U<br>so there are a lot of inter<br>relationships here going on uh so the<br>you know things get a little more<br>complicated than just say Farm to<br>Fork um this uh modern food and<br>agriculture system is uh uh developed<br>over the last 75 years uh what we see in<br>say in the grocery store today uh in the<br>early part of 20th century there were uh<br>famines around the globe and uh uh<br>millions of deaths linked to hunger and<br>uh starvation and so on uh so back in um<br>around 19 uh 50s uh time period um<br>people started talking about improving<br>productivity uh looking at new crops and<br>so on new varieties uh so Rockefeller<br>group uh and Ford Foundation uh got<br>together and there were these institutes<br>that were set up around the globe uh for<br>specific Commodities and uh notably uh<br>simmit which is in Mexico City uh that's<br>where they worked on wheat and looking<br>at their dwarf varieties and similarly<br>at here in Philippines uh the<br>international rice Research Institute on<br>rice and um uh Norman Boro uh who was a<br>wheat breeder uh received the U Nobel<br>Prize uh for his work on dwarf uh wheat<br>varieties uh Dr Kush who uh is actually<br>Alum of uh UC Davis uh worked at the<br>international rice Research Institute<br>and developed some of the rice varieties<br>that are now grown all over southeast<br>Asia uh and uh Phil Nelson who uh uh at<br>Purdue University who developed the uh<br>uh aseptic process U bulk aseptic<br>process for preservation of uh of foods<br>so uh a number of activities on hybrid<br>varieties post Harvest handling<br>processing and of course developing the<br>uh Supply<br>chains and uh the result of that you can<br>see in this graph that uh had quite a<br>increase in Grain production uh in the<br>1960s uh uh you know from there in terms<br>of wheat five times the production uh in<br>fact I was a teenager in uh state of<br>Punjab in India when the Green<br>Revolution was going on so I firsthand<br>recall some of the uh changes that were<br>going on in the in the Farms as the as<br>the new varieties were brought in and<br>the production<br>increased uh this increased productivity<br>uh uh from hybrid varieties were very<br>much uh reliant on chemicals use of<br>chemicals fertilizers pesticides and so<br>on and water uh and some of these things<br>we will talk about uh a little bit<br>later uh so now our modern food and<br>agriculture system uh is uh being<br>impacted by multiple challenges uh uh we<br>have the increasing population uh and<br>urbanization uh going on uh there is of<br>course the climate change U there's also<br>degradation of Natural Resources um and<br>then there are diet related uh Health<br>diseases all of those impacting and U as<br>as challenges but while they are<br>challenges there are also the<br>opportunities that for us to address<br>some of those um when we look at the<br>population I'm sure you have seen these<br>uh types of data that uh by 2050 we are<br>looking at 10 billion people well that<br>also means that we have to uh increase<br>food food production uh meet that uh<br>almost 60% Gap uh between now and uh say<br>2050 not too far from now and the<br>question then how to increase our food<br>supply uh without using more fresh water<br>and land uh so question for<br>us and also in this past U 100 years or<br>so uh the greenhouse gas emissions have<br>been increasing uh quite dramatically<br>and uh from methane to<br>CO2 uh and nitrous oxide and so on and<br>and agriculture is a major part part of<br>the U uh Global greenhouse gas emissions<br>among the various economic<br>sectors studies indicate about quarter<br>of the greenhouse gas emissions are uh<br>because of Agriculture forestry and land<br>use and of course the impact of that the<br>greenhouse gas emissions we can all feel<br>it uh in terms of the increasing<br>temperatures uh in almost every month<br>every year uh we are seeing records the<br>previous record is being broken in terms<br>of the land temperature but also the<br>seawater temperature and U and that<br>again for countries like New Zealand are<br>surrounded by water uh increase of water<br>temperature uh is a has a Major Impact<br>uh I was here just after the 2023 uh<br>Cyclone Gabriel uh which according to a<br>former prime minister Hipkins brought<br>unprecedented floods and and you know<br>that there was a damage uh to lot of<br>infrastructure uh but also a lot of uh<br>uh produce uh you know and the farmers<br>they here they have the apples uh uh and<br>then also many of the fields that were<br>inundated with water uh so a lot of<br>damage to uh uh to the AG food supply to<br>the agricultural production uh and of<br>course there are wildfires going on not<br>just in one part of the planet but you<br>kind of spread all around from Australia<br>to Siberia uh and again impact of that<br>on our uh land uh in terms of producing<br>food uh floods in various countries uh<br>and then multi-year droughts um that uh<br>have been again going on in various<br>parts around the<br>planet in fact um those droughts have<br>also led to uh issues like depletion of<br>aquafers uh so um it's kind of<br>troublesome because U I've circled two<br>regions one is in California where the<br>aquafers had been going down um and uh<br>that region is in fact very important in<br>terms of agricultural production and the<br>same thing is happening in the indog<br>gtic area where uh um again there is a<br>serious U depletion of aquafers and U<br>and and that the region that grows a lot<br>of food uh for the population<br>there um studies also indicate that uh<br>the uh potential average yields of uh<br>many of our serial grains uh looking<br>ahead is going to be actually going down<br>uh quite in some cases quite<br>significantly uh so all these U you know<br>what what you see here uh on one hand uh<br>we want to increase production to meet<br>the demands of our increasing population<br>and on the other hand with the climate<br>change and some of the impacts uh there<br>uh that we have actually a reduction in<br>terms of uh what we can expect right now<br>uh so couple of weeks ago was the U uh<br>in London was the climate action week uh<br>where they I think about 40 or 50,000<br>people get together and you know there<br>were talks about climate change and and<br>so on uh Jennifer Morgan who's a<br>Germany's state Secretary there uh made<br>a statement which I thought was quite uh<br>appropriate it says uh there is no going<br>back to A World Before extreme weather<br>events uh there is no option to push uh<br>re or push pause uh but we have the<br>skills to shape a better more resilient<br>future and that is the challenge for us<br>and uh opportunity is then to uh to to<br>look at the system and then see what<br>what we can<br>do uh so when it comes to uh mitigation<br>and adaptation uh as we move forward um<br>we have the multiple goals uh for<br>meeting food needs uh sustained natural<br>resources uh as well as a healthy<br>ecosystem and uh for that they are again<br>if you look around the globe uh uh there<br>are many many uh efforts going on<br>whether it's in the Academia or in the<br>industry uh from issues like soil<br>regeneration plant-based Foods cellular<br>agriculture food loss based management<br>uh and and I'm sure many who are online<br>and many here uh are working in many of<br>these areas and certainly these are<br>topics that we can talk in a lot more<br>detail uh but I thought that for for<br>this evening maybe look more at the<br>general structure of the food system and<br>what opportunities may be there to uh to<br>see what what things we can transform uh<br>to U address some of these<br>goals so if we uh look at our again<br>modern food and agriculture system it<br>operates uh within a linear economy and<br>just to make sure everyone is uh<br>familiar with the term uh in a linear<br>economy the value of products materials<br>and resources is maintained in the<br>economy for a short period of time uh<br>with the substantial generation of waste<br>uh so um uh and this applies to all<br>sectors not not only to food and<br>agriculture in all all manufacturing<br>sectors and uh you know again<br>pictorially it's uh you take stuff from<br>in terms of resources and you make<br>something uh you use it for some time<br>and then you dispose it which of course<br>leads to waste and pollution and perhaps<br>this Smartphone is a is a good example<br>of that that you know every two three<br>years uh you come up with a new uh you<br>know software or hardware and so on and<br>then you're disposing it off so um<br>that's sort of a system U is really not<br>sustainable um as you move ahead and so<br>if you look at the a Food Systems again<br>uh<br>number of parts of the supply chain um<br>generates a lot of food loss and waste<br>uh and uh and that leads to degrading<br>some of the natural resources puts more<br>pressure on the environment uh and also<br>contribute to the climate change um so<br>uh this is something where business as<br>usual uh will not suffice so we have to<br>look at uh other ways of doing this<br>rather than being in a linear economy so<br>one thing we can do is uh look at nature<br>well u in case of nature uh it's<br>cyclical uh and always in constant<br>motion uh it is a system of living<br>systems uh so we have the water cycle uh<br>we have the carbon cycle and these are<br>cyclical um we have the nitrogen cycle<br>we have situations where one organism's<br>waste is another organism's food energy<br>and nutrients uh so the system is<br>operating with minimal or zero waste uh<br>and uh and so that should provide us<br>with an inspiration to uh to look at how<br>we may uh modify the way we have been<br>doing some of our things more recently<br>so the question then comes up what what<br>will it take uh to transform our<br>throwaway economy into one where waste<br>is<br>eliminated resources are circulated and<br>nature is<br>regenerated uh and uh that uh one of the<br>ways would be a circular economy now<br>this is a term appeared in the just in<br>the last 10 years or so um Alan<br>MacArthur Foundation uh uh has uh<br>articulated this very well they are<br>promoting this where circular economy is<br>where the value of products materials<br>and resources uh are then maintained in<br>the economy uh as long as possible uh so<br>you and also with minimal generation of<br>waste uh and so the circular economy um<br>has has developed here is uh to give us<br>tools then to tackle climate change uh<br>and biodiversity loss uh together with<br>addressing some of the important social<br>needs um so there are certain principles<br>of circularity U uh that involve incre<br>increasing the use efficiency uh so<br>imagine in the food processing plant we<br>are we want to uh improve the efficiency<br>of the operations not only from<br>production standpoint but also from the<br>resource use standpoint uh design out<br>the waste and pollution<br>so we recover the uh discarded waste and<br>for productive uses U we keep products<br>and materials in continued use as long<br>as possible uh and then we regenerate<br>natural systems and we provide economic<br>benefits um that last part is also<br>critical uh to to realize these uh<br>circularity in our operations and so<br>on um so<br>as I showed before our food and<br>agricultural value chain uh and then we<br>have the socio economic systems uh and<br>also we have the Nature's<br>ecosystems uh so there are a lot of<br>systems here and so the new sort of<br>level of thinking here is that we have<br>systems of systems and uh these are<br>layered uh and they are interwoven uh so<br>um this is where the many of the<br>resources are<br>interacting uh spatially and temporarily<br>uh and continuously they Loop forward<br>and<br>backward uh so uh as you can see the the<br>complexity here increases uh that also<br>means then that we need multidisiplinary<br>uh systems<br>approaches okay so couple of words here<br>and then I'm going to emphasize those<br>later on too systems is one our thinking<br>has to be more about systems um because<br>sometimes uh you may come up with a<br>solution but it may have unintended<br>consequences somewhere else in the<br>system uh so uh in that case you have to<br>take appropriate measures to make sure<br>that you do not uh you know uh cause a<br>damage on some other part of the system<br>uh so uh<br>within the National Academy uh we have<br>been involved in in this uh for the last<br>about five or six years um in 2021 we<br>actually held a virtual Forum uh on<br>complex food and agricultural system uh<br>engineering for sustainability and<br>resilience uh we had around 900 uh<br>participants uh uh from around the globe<br>and uh I would encourage those who may<br>be interested uh to look at some of the<br>presentations and U uh the discussion<br>that went on there uh within the<br>National Academy of engineering we also<br>had a u recent issue of the bridge uh<br>called smart agriculture again focused<br>on some of these uh uh topics related to<br>Circular uh<br>bioeconomy um but the other one that I'm<br>going to take the next remaining time uh<br>to talk about is um the effort that has<br>been going on within a professional<br>Society the American Society of<br>agricultural and biological Engineers U<br>they uh uh started an initiative on<br>transforming food and agriculture into<br>circular systems uh in 2020 uh I was<br>part of that task force and uh I have um<br>continued with some of the developments<br>there that I thought might be of<br>interest to some of you uh you might ask<br>why this particular society and that's<br>because the members of this Society are<br>indeed working on elements uh across the<br>bioeconomy value chain uh and also the<br>environment so we have members from all<br>those so that gives us a at least u a<br>starting point you know to address uh<br>some of these uh<br>issues and very recently uh a an<br>Institute has been set up within asab<br>it's the circular bioeconomy systems<br>institute there's a website addressed<br>there and again I will encourage you to<br>be a member of that because uh we are<br>really looking for Global participation<br>on many of many of these issues um that<br>are impacting uh through climate change<br>and and<br>others um so U one of the activities<br>that we recently completed uh was to<br>hold some workshops uh to build a uh<br>multi-disciplinary uh stakeholder<br>alliances as you saw earlier that this<br>is not<br>an issue that only one discipline can<br>can address that we need to really have<br>a multi-disciplinary approach here for<br>the circular systems uh and again with a<br>question of what new knowledge<br>techniques and skills are needed uh to<br>transform into the circular bioeconomy<br>systems uh so uh uh they were in fact<br>just in the last two months uh there<br>were nine workshops that were held uh<br>and you can see from the topics that<br>they cover various aspects of the food<br>and agriculture system from Farm<br>production to controlled environment to<br>uh uh Urban agriculture to animal<br>production uh and the food processing<br>and waste side which which I was myself<br>involved in um we had over 300<br>participants for these workshops and um<br>uh there will be a summit uh in Spring<br>of 2025 again for those who may be<br>interested uh in<br>this so I'll I'll briefly uh talk about<br>uh some of the discussion that went on<br>uh in uh the food processing and waste<br>Workshop uh last month uh in Chicago uh<br>we had uh participants from the food<br>industry uh spread from uh uh<br>multinationals to uh small and medium<br>Enterprises um as well as people from<br>Academia uh government uh uh<br>NOS um trade organizations and<br>Consultants so we we had quite a broad U<br>uh you know uh participant uh expertise<br>uh available to discuss uh not only have<br>some short plary talks but most of the<br>time was on<br>brainstorming uh topics that are related<br>to uh food processing as well as waste<br>through the chain a white paper is being<br>prepared I think there were over 100<br>plus uh uh ideas and topics that came up<br>U I thought that maybe uh it would be of<br>interest here to maybe look at just two<br>three items uh from each one of those uh<br>five themes uh that were discussed uh<br>first relates to food processing this is<br>uh the more of the food manufacturing<br>side with the food energy water Nexus um<br>we had a a a topic on upcycled Foods a<br>group you know looking at that in more<br>detail food packaging food losses and<br>waste at the retail level uh and then<br>food waste at the consumer<br>level so um just briefly uh talk about<br>these and also I'll mention maybe two<br>three case studies examples from our own<br>research um so in case of food<br>manufacturing one of the item that came<br>up from those who were especially coming<br>from the industry is that there is a<br>lack of usable data on specific unit<br>operations these are the processes that<br>are carried out in the plant uh we don't<br>have very good information on specific<br>water and energy requirements uh that<br>are needed to enable uh better sizing<br>matching for processes so this there's a<br>need to develop this type of information<br>a better quantitative data uh there is<br>also lack of uh decision-making tools<br>for The Operators uh so and uh it was<br>suggested that we should develop some<br>open source information uh so that<br>available to also small and medium<br>Enterprises um and then to leverage um<br>what's going on I'm sure most of you are<br>have heard and or maybe working in this<br>is in artificial intelligence in machine<br>learning and digital twins uh for<br>optimizing and uh improving our<br>processes and especially from energy and<br>some of the other uh resource use uh and<br>uh just side note there uh in fact uh<br>many of us um food Engineers around the<br>globe have been working on computational<br>modeling of food processes this just<br>shows one example of a study that we did<br>a few years ago on impingement Ovens<br>that are used in the industry uh most of<br>that computational work was largely to<br>design a piece of equipment it didn't<br>really get into manufacturing stage at<br>that time uh but we do have all those<br>models and currently being developed and<br>now with the uh advances that are taking<br>place uh in the technology world uh<br>there's an opportunity uh not only uh to<br>run the simulations on our computers but<br>also to link it with real data coming<br>from the plant so that you can now uh<br>run these pieces of equipment in the<br>industry in the most efficient way and<br>uh again trying to cut down the waste<br>the losses the energy requirements and<br>water and so<br>on um and another item was on food<br>processing is the water recovery uh<br>filtration reuse and again uh uh you<br>know lot of our equipment that has been<br>designed in the food industry that's<br>used in food manufacturing uh was<br>designed in the era of plentiful energy<br>and water uh those were not the<br>constraints that the engineer had when<br>you designing a piece of equipment uh<br>most often it was the production<br>efficiency and so on uh so uh now with<br>the the emphasis on trying to cut down<br>the water use and the energy use uh we<br>have to look at ways of how we can<br>retrofit or design new equipment uh for<br>example it's quite typical in a in a<br>food processing plant to have the floor<br>drains where water after it's used in a<br>piece of equipment goes down in the<br>drain everything gets mixed and then you<br>have a problems with handling that waste<br>water uh so there's no reason why we<br>cannot go to the individual processing<br>equipment from where the water is<br>discharging look at what is in there and<br>recover uh some of the U if there are<br>chemicals for used for cleaning and so<br>on those can be recovered uh they're<br>solid food solids those can be recovered<br>and water can be cleaned and reused<br>within the piece of equipment so we have<br>those Technologies and we can put it<br>together uh but again uh these are<br>things uh to evaluate not only from<br>technology standpoint but also from<br>economic standpoint and U opportunities<br>to improve on okay um and then the last<br>item on food processing group was to uh<br>uh look for<br>decarbonizing uh processing operations<br>and uh lot of new developments that are<br>taking place in this arena in fact are<br>based on um uh use of uh electricity U<br>uh and that is from then renewable uh<br>side so uh uh high pressure processing<br>pulse electric field the work that's<br>going on here in University of aago uh<br>microwave sterilization omic heating<br>these are all electric based uh<br>technologies that are coming around and<br>so uh opportunities for us to<br>decarbonize uh our food processing again<br>I know that many around the globe are<br>working in these and I think there are<br>again uh great opportunities to make<br>impact really Major Impact in the future<br>okay uh upcycled foods and uh uh here uh<br>we really need to do a paradigm change<br>uh because a lot of raw material in fact<br>even upon Harvest uh gets rejected just<br>based on Aesthetics uh you know we walk<br>into the grocery store and we really<br>want to see that perfectly shaped apple<br>or orange or you know your tomato um and<br>uh but not every tomato on the plant uh<br>is going to have that aesthetic value<br>and unfortunately that there's that's<br>where there is a considerable loss and<br>so on um so in upcycled Foods uh again<br>to be successful a lot of these<br>Innovations uh will need to be tied to<br>the value proposition so that that<br>aspect is going to be important uh we<br>need some clear metrics uh to validate<br>the impact of upcycled foods life cost<br>analysis and so on and we also need that<br>information to go to the innovators as<br>well as the small scale producers so um<br>so there's a more widespread<br>availability of that<br>information um the uh the other thing<br>about upcycled food is that many times<br>we have streams coming out side streams<br>uh but the amount is not enough uh to<br>put in large capital expenditure on that<br>so uh many times uh matching producers<br>to potential users uh can assist but<br>also uh creating waste cooperatives uh<br>for Co located Industries those are ways<br>that we can U have a sufficient scale of<br>operation uh so that what can make that<br>kind of capital expenditure for for that<br>now food packaging uh again is an area U<br>important uh and here again one of the<br>uh suggestion is about bulk food uh uh<br>should be made more widely available uh<br>to reduce the primary packaging uh but<br>also accounting there the consumer needs<br>for times for shopping uh as well as<br>meal preparation food safety and so on<br>um the the other aspect was that most of<br>the package packages are<br>designed uh it's just the same design<br>regardless of where that product is<br>going where it's being shipped whether<br>it's within the same uh region or going<br>out to another country or whatever um<br>but package design should be based on<br>the final location of that food<br>consumption uh can that package be<br>recycled at that location do they have<br>the local infrastructure uh to to<br>recycle for example that pack package uh<br>is it easier for consumers to recycle at<br>that location and use that information<br>in terms of design of the package for<br>that product going for that particular<br>market so these are some of the ideas uh<br>being talked about uh of course if you<br>want to prioritize in case of packaging<br>uh first reduce uh then reuse then<br>recycle and um along with that there is<br>again number of people working in the<br>area of intelligent and smart packages<br>uh time temperature sensors uh we<br>ourselves worked in this field uh almost<br>uh uh I would say almost 35 40 years ago<br>U and this was on U time temperature<br>indicators I had a project with the uh<br>US Army uh we were looking at shipment<br>of foods a long distance uh ensuring<br>that uh when those packages are opened<br>that the product has not gone through<br>any U uh type of heat abuse which can<br>cause uh quality uh deterioration and uh<br>out of that project came uh result was<br>some of these indicators and uh in case<br>of all the shipment for US Army all the<br>meals ready to eat uh they are in fact<br>using these indic uh indicators now uh<br>for that particular purpose uh they<br>haven't come to that much to the<br>civilian uh you know use uh uh largely<br>because of the cost issue uh and at at<br>this point at least so we'll see how<br>things move in the future U but there is<br>another application that we in fact uh<br>one of my PhD student published papers<br>on that and I can show you that that<br>let's say that if you have a fruit<br>shipment from New Zealand uh going to<br>Los Angeles and then uh U within that<br>shipment there's a part of it that has<br>gone through some sort of heat abuse<br>let's say the port or in the ship itself<br>and um now that that particular uh<br>Consignment uh needs to move faster<br>because it does not have as much shelf<br>life in it and so if you had an<br>opportunity where uh uh a product is<br>perfectly fine that can go to the market<br>say in New York but if the other product<br>is not doesn't have as much shelf life<br>could go to say a market in Seattle but<br>you you need that uh you need that<br>quantitative information and these types<br>of time temperature indicators can<br>provide that um again it's nice to see<br>now companies that are beginning to<br>offer this uh opportunity also connected<br>to the cloud uh so that uh you're<br>getting realtime data on these shipments<br>and uh the decisions are being made<br>based on the remaining shelf life of the<br>product so you have you minimize the<br>wastage and you provide improved quality<br>uh for the consumer uh so it it took a<br>few years but it's uh it's being<br>used uh then uh the fourth item was on<br>the retail side uh our grocery stores uh<br>and the food waste there uh again there<br>is a need to standardize uh some of the<br>data uh reporting on this to enable more<br>transparency in this uh and there are<br>now companies uh uh groups like refed um<br>that are offering that type of service<br>and it's going to be needed um there is<br>a a certain amount of uh uh you know<br>cont confidentiality and information<br>that needs to be protected and in Within<br>These various retail businesses but the<br>what we see here is that when it comes<br>to uh food waste uh this is something uh<br>where a collaboration can be<br>precompetitive uh and where one can<br>share successes and failures and uh and<br>help create that trust uh within<br>different companies that are involved<br>and uh and there are mechanism to<br>anonymize the data<br>uh so that we can uh improve on on that<br>um also uh like in California now there<br>is a total ban on food waste going from<br>uh the retail stores uh to landfills uh<br>it requires that food waste to be<br>directed either for donations uh or to a<br>organic waste processing facility but<br>not to the landfill and um and also uh<br>smartphone app apps for example being<br>developed uh to advise the consumer<br>about the availability of surplus food<br>uh Albertson which is one of our largest<br>chains uh just signed up with Uber uh to<br>for this type of service providing that<br>uh uh situations where there is food<br>available and U uh that may have passed<br>say it's shelf life date or coming close<br>to shelf life date uh that is available<br>then uh for consumption<br>um and then the last one here is the uh<br>uh consumer level uh uh food waste uh<br>this is where one of the things uh we<br>find is that we need uh an improved<br>understanding of the extent of the<br>problem uh we don't have that yet uh and<br>there is actually a major project that<br>uh funded by the National Science<br>Foundation uh involving several<br>universities where they are collecting<br>that information from across United<br>States right now uh to understand better<br>in terms of inhome uh food waste at<br>various stages and develop measurement<br>standards there um there's also uh in<br>case of uh consumer level food waste uh<br>is what you can learn from local<br>communities uh uh from different<br>cultural backgrounds uh so a lot of this<br>is more uh sort of local Solutions<br>community-led strategies and so on in<br>trying to cut down consumer level uh<br>food<br>waste and of course uh there's a need<br>for Consumer education about these um<br>Best Buy dates uh uh in food safety and<br>and how one may handle Foods based on<br>that information uh there is a there's a<br>lot of Education that needs to be uh<br>taken care of in in in this particular<br>case and uh also related to food waste<br>education of course use social media um<br>uh but also U uh one of the things that<br>came up in this uh Workshop was that<br>educate children on food waste that many<br>times that can uh influence the<br>household Behavior Uh through that<br>route okay now um I think I'm getting<br>out of my time this is the last slide um<br>I will be remiss if I don't note a a<br>report that just came out last week I<br>believe here uh from the U uh from the<br>prime minister's uh uh the science<br>advisor uh Chief science scientific<br>officer uh about preventing food loss<br>and waste in New Zealand uh I have uh<br>glanced through it it's a very<br>comprehensive report and really got some<br>great great ideas I'm in fact going to<br>take and uh share it some of my<br>colleagues there but again those who may<br>be interested more on the uh food loss<br>and waste this report is uh available uh<br>online so um a reference for you<br>okay so as I summarize U uh for a<br>sustainable uh circular bioeconomy<br>system that is producing safe uh<br>affordable nutritious and plentiful food<br>uh there are these are some of the<br>things that we need to think about for<br>future one is systems thinking um and<br>jointly work towards these complex<br>system Solutions um the Innovations we<br>create<br>um they have to be in harmony with uh<br>not only the technical side but the<br>policy and socioeconomic uh perspectives<br>um we need to partner across disciplines<br>uh and professions uh because as you<br>have seen you know some of the previous<br>slides because of the complexities and<br>uh uh that that we we must address those<br>various uh um disciplines and then uh we<br>need to also develop and use uh metrics<br>uh to continually assess our progress<br>then uh towards circularity uh so as we<br>frame our future food system these are<br>some of the ideas that uh have come<br>through these uh workshops and uh and<br>discussions that we have had and I<br>thought that they might be of of<br>Interest here so with that I thank you<br>for your attention</p></main><footer style="margin-top: 2rem; background:
