tudu H Deputy Vice<br>Chancellor Marty here at the University<br>of otago and so on behalf of the senior<br>leadership team I welcome you all here<br>this evening for this very special event<br>to Mark and celebrate the promotion of<br>Professor<br>position I acknowledge all our<br>colleagues visitors and those here in<br>person and those online this evening who<br>are here to celebrate All you have<br>achieved in your career to this point<br>and as the first I believe as the first<br>Bangladeshi born staff member to be<br>appointed as Professor here at atago I<br>really wish to acknowledge this<br>Milestone so this is a really special<br>occasion uh for you and your family and<br>especially acknowledge your wife and<br>your two daughters who are sitting here<br>with us and your family members overseas<br>who are joining us online this evening I<br>believe your parents and your sisters<br>and their families are with us online<br>from Melbourne and Bangladesh also<br>online are your wife's parents so your<br>mother and your father-in-law and their<br>families also beaming in from Bangladesh<br>so the significance of your work is a<br>testament to many who are here in person<br>and online and I believe that there are<br>two our two previous Vice chancellors<br>Professor harleen Hayne and Professor<br>David Murdoch are also online as well as<br>your PhD supervisor Emeritus Professor<br>Peter Stewart and his wife associate<br>professor Kay Stewart so this occasion<br>represents years and years of<br>award-winning research teaching and<br>supervision and as a pharmaceutical<br>scientist with expertise in drug<br>formulation and delivery you have<br>contributed enormously to new knowledge<br>in this country and<br>internationally and one of the roles of<br>a university is to help positively<br>transform society and your work<br>especially for leading the voluntary<br>production of hand sanitizer during<br>covid-19 lockdown is exemplary and<br>deservedly one a kiwi Bank Local Hero<br>award so I'm now going to hand over uh<br>to Professor Bruce Russell acting dean<br>of the School of Pharmacy to more fully<br>introduce you a warm welcome to you all<br>this evening taroto taroto taroto<br>Coto good evening and welcome everybody<br>uh profess Professor Ruru has done a<br>very nice job of introducing uh sh<br>obviously uh I guess from my perspective<br>I've known shyl since beginning of 2016<br>which is when I shifted here<br>too uh but if I asked had a look at of<br>sh CV earlier today and yesterday trying<br>to think about what I was going to say<br>uh and shal actually began his academic<br>career I guess you would call it as a<br>lectur in banglish at Johan nagar<br>University and this was as long as ago<br>was the year 2000 now so we're talking<br>about over 20 years here so that's quite<br>a long period of time and during this<br>time uh he's obviously accomplished an<br>awful lot uh from Bangladesh he shifted<br>to mes and Melbourne so he completed a<br>PhD there in pharmaceutics uh followed<br>by a 5year postdoctoral<br>fellowship uh and then he obviously<br>shifted here in<br>2013 uh so he's been here for probably<br>what 10 11 years now and he's achieved<br>quite a lot so if you look at back at<br>what he's done over the last 20 years I<br>guess he's focused mostly on dry powder<br>and inhaler formulations for lung<br>disorders that includes esma uh COPD uh<br>Co briefly and also for tuberculosis in<br>particular for drug resistant bacterial<br>infections which is a a real Bane I<br>guess of the life of Pharmacists in<br>general which is I guess ways in the<br>School of<br>Pharmacy uh so when he shifted here he<br>established and still leads the only dry<br>powder<br>inhalation sorry inhaler formulation<br>research laboratory in New Zealand uh<br>there's no other research lab quite like<br>shills within New Zealand and<br>uh this was kind of a new field of<br>research too for the school U so if you<br>actually look at what he's achieved<br>since he set this up he's been really<br>really successful so if you look at<br>again as a CV we've got over 100 just<br>over a 100 peer-reviewed Publications<br>that's quite a lot for anybody uh that's<br>Testament I guess the amount of work<br>he's put into this particular Endeavor<br>uh while he's been here he's received a<br>lot of awards awards for research uh<br>including the School of Pharmacy<br>excellence and research award in<br>2017 uh said the best half paper of the<br>year for three years in a row so 2019 20<br>and<br>21 uh he was in the UK last year I think<br>it was and he received a career<br>development award from the drug delivery<br>to lungs conference in the UK and again<br>this is all Testament the amount of work<br>that he's put into this particular field<br>of research so he's worked really really<br>hard uh along the way though he's<br>obviously had off lot of people that<br>have worked quite hard with him and for<br>him so if you look at what he's had in<br>terms of postdoctoral supervision and<br>PhD students he's had eight<br>post-doctoral fellows and research ass<br>assistant sorry assistant research<br>fellows uh he's had 10 PhD students and<br>around 20 honors and Masters students<br>and again that's a lot of work just the<br>supervision of them sort of let looking<br>at the output of what they've actually<br>produced so as I said he's done really<br>really well uh if you look at his<br>teaching he's also been an exemplary<br>teacher as well so he's an able a whole<br>lot of students to really Excel and and<br>win Awards of of their own so he said<br>three of the students have achieved<br>uh sorry I'm losing track of where I am<br>now uh three of the students Theses have<br>list been listed as exceptional by the<br>division of Health Sciences uh he also<br>won the supervisor of the Year award in<br>2017 so again he's put a lot of effort<br>into his students and as I said into his<br>work in<br>general uh if you look at what he is now<br>he's currently the associate dean of<br>research for the school the<br>pharmacy uh he's also the president of<br>theago Medical School research society<br>and he's also a member of the and the<br>president of the New Zealand chapter of<br>the controlled Release Society so he's a<br>very very busy man uh apart from<br>teaching and research obviously he<br>devotes a lot of time to a lot of people<br>and puts in a lot of work uh he's also<br>very highly ranked I guess you would<br>call it he's on the editorial board of<br>the Journal of pharmaceutics and the<br>international Journal of pharmaceutics<br>they're both very very highly ranked<br>journals in his particular field of<br>research uh and as said if he's on the<br>editorial board for those that again is<br>a testament the amount of effort that he<br>puts into these<br>things<br>uh I guess it's probably up to me to<br>leave it to Shan now so if we look at<br>his lecture he's really just going to<br>review I guess his journey from<br>certainly from Bangladesh to Australia<br>and then here to New Zealand and it said<br>he's been here now for 10 or 11 years<br>and certainly calls this place home uh<br>so I'll leave it with you now sh thank<br>you<br>kayma go<br>Bengal no<br>good<br>evening<br>and and namashkar<br>thank you Professor juru for uh this<br>hosting my IPL thank you Professor brce<br>Russell for this nice<br>introduction and special thanks to all<br>the professors Professor Halen Nicholson<br>Professor Stuart Brook Professor Richard<br>Blakey and profor Megan<br>Gans I'm so lucky uh to have you here<br>today and I'm also<br>lucky that um two former Vice<br>chancellors Professor Helen Nicholson<br>Professor Harin ha and Professor David<br>Marduk are on<br>online thank you to all who will be also<br>watching this video in the<br>future tonight I'll share my personal<br>Journey particularly I'll share my<br>research on dry powder<br>inhalers I'll take a little bit of<br>teaching and a bit of<br>service<br>so where am I<br>from<br>well many of you know the<br>this Southeast Asian country Bangladesh<br>cricket Dhaka is the capital city of<br>Bangladesh I was born in gajipur which<br>is very uh close to Dhaka<br>City I lived in Bangladesh for over<br>three<br>decades where Bangla is the um first<br>language and then I lived in Australia<br>for 9<br>years and in the last 11 years I'm in<br>New Zealand so I have got a completely<br>International<br>accent which you may need a little bit<br>more attention<br>tonight and I believe it has increased<br>University so my family well my dad was<br>a teacher<br>and he's highly respected by students<br>and the<br>community watching him very<br>closely I dreamed to be a<br>teacher<br>and my two<br>sisters she lives in Daka and the other<br>sister lives in<br>Melbourne the school system in<br>Bangladesh was very competitive even<br>from primary school and my mom always<br>ensured that we we are best prepared for<br>the school and I secured first position<br>in the class always and I received<br>studies Pharmacy was one of the Top<br>Choice subjects for science students at<br>that<br>time and um you can imagine there are<br>only 90 seats in three<br>universities in Bangladesh at that time<br>for a population of 110<br>million and I secured my uh position in<br>this University which is called Jang<br>nagar<br>University um it is a public<br>university and completely residential<br>University I used to stay in this<br>residential<br>hall I again I was working hard and I<br>secured my first class first position in<br>both of my bachelor of Pharmacy Hors and<br>Pharmacy<br>but to complete this<br>degree we had to spend 9<br>years uh because there are some reasons<br>which is beyond our control Beyond<br>University's control so what else I did<br>well I was appointed by a coaching<br>Center to teach students who are<br>preparing for the University admission<br>test and uh I was also active in<br>Pharmacy Student Association and in<br>1998 I was the only student member in a<br>delegate from Bangladesh to observe<br>Hospital Pharmacy system in<br>Singapore with an invitation from<br>Commonwealth pharmaceutical Society<br>I I was very active for Social Service<br>during that time and I was involved in<br>Rotary Club and also gazipur District<br>student welfare organization as<br>secretary and president so Social<br>life while I was waiting for Master's<br>results I started job in a<br>pharmaceutical<br>industry but teaching is what I'm<br>passionate about so after my result was<br>out at the first opportunity I started<br>as a lecturer in pharmacy at J<br>University and that was 18 July 2000<br>week during this time I taught almost<br>all different subjects because I never<br>said no to teach anything whichever was<br>given to me because I love teaching so I<br>did<br>it about research well uh<br>I what I did when I was a<br>student there was a tragedy in<br>Bangladesh due to consumption of<br>substandard<br>paracetamol that triggered<br>me and even during my masters I did<br>voluntary research on the substandard<br>medicines in<br>Bangladesh and I continued that until I<br>started my PhD and I published around<br>eight papers during that<br>time uh I I was also active and I always<br>I try to contribute and try to remain as<br>a good citizen wherever I work so I uh I<br>used to do a lot of university-wide<br>service like a as an house tutor for the<br>for a residential hall and also as an<br>EST Proctor these are very time<br>consuming job in and professionally I<br>also um like I served the Bangladesh<br>pharmaceutical society as a social<br>service<br>secretary during that time it is always<br>rewarding I have now when I look<br>back many of my former students are now<br>professors in different universities in<br>Bangladesh or they are in a high level<br>position in Industry so whenever I go<br>back to Bangladesh even for a<br>holiday I'm often asked to give<br>presentations for the students and year<br>how they can come to New Zealand or how<br>about higher<br>studies truth<br>thing the last holiday I went for a<br>holiday in Bangladesh but I gave six<br>presentations in different universities<br>well uh I married shubra shra is here I<br>married shra and she was a final year<br>owner student and we used to live this<br>University Residence these are<br>here soon after our first and what<br>happened<br>shra completed her honors and Masters<br>but in both she again stood first class<br>fast in her Bachelor of uh science<br>honors and also am for MSC examination<br>even after marriage good<br>so once we got the like soon after our<br>first daughter was born we got a letter<br>I got a letter from monach<br>University to do my PhD it's a<br>scholarship of a letter so the problem<br>happened shra got a job shra was offered<br>a lecture position at<br>University so he decided okay you<br>continue as a lecturer and I'm going<br>alone and you come<br>later so I came alone to<br>Melbourne and Professor Peter Stewart<br>was my uh<br>supervisor he was the head of Department<br>of pharmaceutics since<br>1992 and also the uh Deputy dean of the<br>faculty<br>both Peter and his wife is Professor K<br>Stewart both are listening<br>online uh from Gold Coast thank you<br>Peter and K uh for your all support and<br>trust in<br>me as also co-supervised by Dr Yan<br>Larson who is currently the director of<br>learning and teaching at Mones<br>University's Pharmacy<br>faculty and Professor Paul y he's from<br>Sydney University and<br>um I traveled several times to Sydney<br>University during my studentship to do<br>research coming to dry powder<br>inhalers so that's the dry powder<br>inhalers like that and here you can see<br>so dry powder inhaler devices deliver<br>drugs to the lung when you in inhale<br>like that it goes to the<br>lung normally the drugs are stored<br>inside the device for the this<br>particular device like this one or this<br>one<br>or the drugs are dispensed in capsule<br>and you put in the capsule in the device<br>and then you<br>inhale after inhalation the particles<br>which are 1 to 5 Micron size only those<br>particles can go to your deep lung where<br>you want because you for asthma you want<br>the drugs to be<br>here so<br>formulators normally keep<br>drugs uh like a produce this sort of<br>drug by micronization<br>technique the problem of this tiny<br>particles they're highly sticky they<br>cannot stay alone so whenever you<br>produce that sort of um Micron siiz<br>particles they become lump and<br>aerate so what we expect we expect when<br>you inhale when it is going from mouth<br>to lung they will be break breaking down<br>to individual<br>particles so that only the individual<br>particles go to the Deep lung so there<br>is a science here how you can make this<br>lump how you can break this lump so that<br>individual particles are again going you<br>are going from mouth to trachea and then<br>ultimately only the individual particles<br>so that they can go to the lung well the<br>best way can do micronization only 5%<br>you can get into that level so it<br>doesn't work so during that time when I<br>started just one or two year before this<br>concept came they deliberately add<br>lactose in the formulation to decrease<br>this<br>stickiness I don't you will be surprised<br>to know in an asthma inhaler more only<br>up to 5% is<br>drug and all are lactose like a 95%<br>lactose even the best formulation like<br>that we get only 10 to 15% uh drug<br>delivered to the Deep lung that's the<br>situation when I<br>started<br>in the other problem this humidity you<br>put the inhaler in your home or wherever<br>you use in the different parts of the<br>world the humidity varies the humidity<br>are<br>different my project was to investigate<br>the influence of this humidity on the<br>dry powder inhaler<br>performance well I prepared different<br>con different composition I prepared a<br>number of formulations with different<br>compositions and stored<br>them at different humidities ranging<br>from comp completely dry which is 0% of<br>humidity to an extremely humid like a<br>95% of<br>humidity and I monitored the lung<br>months the good news is all the inhalers<br>all the compositions are okay up to 55%<br>relative humidity so not a<br>problem but only when it is 75% relative<br>humidity some formulation starts like a<br>l is affected and one of the best<br>formulation actually the lung delivery<br>was affected within 8 weeks<br>significantly<br>affected so to produce the four graphs<br>like that for my PhD like if I had to<br>work I had to collect data in the lab<br>180 days<br>continuously but that was just the<br>beginning right we need to understand<br>the mechanism why why it decrease so I<br>had to use lot of cutting edge<br>instruments and characterizations<br>finally we found that okay the there the<br>fine lactose they are actually producing<br>the solid Bridges so the lamp become<br>stronger and they don't break down so it<br>prevents the drug to go to the Deep<br>lung I wanted to publish it and<br>ultimately we published the first paper<br>from this PhD in the Journal of<br>pharmaceutical science which is a<br>definitely a q1 journal um in<br>pharmaceutical<br>science now I remember still when I<br>choose which Journal shall I publish<br>during that<br>time the mon universities like a in the<br>pharmacy faculty we had a um direction<br>that we should Target uh excellence in<br>research<br>Australia ranked AAR ranked or a ranked<br>Journal because at that time mon<br>University Pharmacy faculty was trying<br>to trying to enter the ranking increase<br>the ranking going forward so we are we<br>are instructed that we should Target<br>only a star or a journals I still try to<br>maintain<br>that this<br>um this is my next work for PhD as well<br>because we need to understand all the<br>different<br>way this is the particle this particle<br>this particle has uh like a the<br>unbalanced energy on the particle<br>surface is called surface<br>energy the more the surface energy the<br>stronger will be aerate so the reduced<br>delivery so to measure the surface<br>energy there is a common commercial<br>invas gas chromatography in 2002 and our<br>group purchased that in just two years<br>this this was an expensive machine at<br>that<br>time I was so fortunate that I was<br>giving the sole responsibility I was<br>trained by UK trainer and I was given<br>the sole responsibility to utilize this<br>machine so I had to collect data for<br>many other people as well and because I<br>was the so person to that there are many<br>data honestly I could not<br>explain and finally I managed to have a<br>PhD in<br>2007 with my supervisor at that time we<br>went to a conference called APS American<br>Association of pharmaceutical scientist<br>conference in San Diego there are 20,000<br>attendees what I discovered there are<br>many many student chapters in the world<br>but there is none from<br>Australia so I talked to the president<br>and when I when I came back to<br>Monash I established this APS Monash<br>University Student<br>Chapter and in just one year it was the<br>lar second largest Student Chapter out<br>of 56 Student Chapter in the world and<br>we are featured in the next uh next<br>meeting and what happened that um now<br>there are many student chapters this<br>sort of Student Chapter in<br>Australia well I submitted my thesis in<br>August 2008 and graduated uh<br>subsequently in the<br>meantime I appeared the uh written<br>Examination for pharmacy registration in<br>Australia and I passed it and<br>because I was considering to become a<br>pharmacist because there are plenty of<br>jobs in for pharmacist at that<br>time uh but on the other hand like I was<br>offered the research Fellowship position<br>at mon Pharmacy<br>faculty so in I dropped the pharmacy<br>registration thing and I started the<br>research<br>fellowship and my wife<br>shra was also offered three scholarships<br>from three univers I to do PhD at the<br>same year and she accepted the one from<br>Monas University's Pharmacy faculty to<br>do research on uh vaccine delivery so<br>next few years we are in the same<br>2009 um I was invited by Professor darl<br>William from Imperial College London<br>because he has developed a technique to<br>determine this non-polar surface energy<br>distributions and he wanted<br>to um wanted me to learn it and I went<br>there I learned it and when I came back<br>to monos I extended this technique for<br>Polar energy distribution and total<br>surface energy distribution and we<br>published it in<br>Lang next few years I<br>also applied this technique for for<br>characterizing or understanding<br>different pharmaceutical processes like<br>mixing mailing whatever is Ed<br>dissolution this has opened the Avenue<br>for Co<br>supervision with many world experts or<br>collaboration and also grants from<br>Industries so these are the people who I<br>worked at that time they are now at<br>I was also invited by this um University<br>College London Professor Simon<br>Gord Simon became the head of<br>pharmaceutics after that so I I worked<br>there in 2011 and also 2012 as a visit<br>visiting<br>researcher and I was invited for many<br>conferences including this one which is<br>um a which was in Parma and I was the<br>Junior most speaker there<br>well so why do we learn all this powder<br>characterization technique while I was<br>doing that I learned lot of powder<br>characterization technique which is not<br>for inhaler understanding powder<br>Behavior because powder is the starting<br>material you can see I can apply this<br>now for all the other solid doces forms<br>if I<br>want because from Powder you can prepare<br>tablets you can prepare capsule you can<br>prepare dry syrup you can prepare these<br>creams or um injection shup so you can<br>do<br>all during this time during my time 9<br>years at Monas University I very closely<br>observed how they were changing policies<br>to go<br>upward and they were successful in<br>2012 they became the first time they<br>became the top 10 Pharmacy schools in<br>the world<br>and probably because I left they scored<br>that<br>well uh it was enough 9 years at Monas<br>University so um shra was about to my<br>wife was about to finish her PhD so we<br>are looking for a job permanent academic<br>position at the time there was a uh<br>circular for from AO University and I<br>was<br>interviewed but again a miracle happened<br>like my second daughter was born just a<br>week before the<br>interview so I thought it is a time that<br>I have to change the country again<br>so so what happened I got uh Professor<br>daff telephoned me that he offered me<br>the senior lecturer position at OTA<br>University I was so excited and I don't<br>know it's a mixed feeling thank you<br>Steve and my shra parents were there in<br>Melbourne at that time this man always<br>loves professors because all his all his<br>daughters and daughters husbands are<br>professors so he was very excited that<br>uh I one day I can be a professor he's<br>now 85 and I'm lucky that he heard that<br>I'm a professor now um so we decided to<br>leave<br>Melbourne uh just one week after sh's<br>graduation so in the first week of<br>July we just uh just flow across the<br>disc and we are in Melbourne for the<br>first<br>time next morning in we are in alham but<br>next morning we were<br>excited because of the snowy<br>welcome it was very cold for us but we<br>were<br>excited and many Bangladeshi families uh<br>senior families helped us because we had<br>a small kid socially they helped us<br>during that<br>time in two weeks time I rented a house<br>in APO within few days I found a NE a<br>next door<br>neighbor a kind-hearted<br>man Dr David Clark thank you David for<br>this friendship over the<br>years now in the school coming to school<br>well uh the School of<br>Pharmacy a School of<br>Pharmacy why I was convinced I talked to<br>my<br>supervisor he was so happy he encouraged<br>me to join the School of Pharmacy<br>because at the<br>time even<br>now univers ities of os School of<br>Pharmacy is one of the few<br>universities in Australia and New<br>Zealand which is very strong in<br>pharmaceutical<br>ranking University of otago Pharmacy was<br>number six among the 22 Pharmacy schools<br>in Australia and New Zealand it has<br>excellent facilities for pharmaceutical<br>science but what I found there is a gap<br>of research on dry powder<br>inhalers in not only not only School of<br>Pharmacy in the University of Pago in<br>New<br>Zealand and the instruments I have used<br>in um monach or in s<br>universities some of the key instruments<br>are<br>missing so I decided as considering to<br>switch my research area it's easy life<br>so I at that<br>time I went to talk to Professor Yan<br>taker who has been my mentor in the<br>University of Pago as mentioned is on<br>holiday in Australia but he is listening<br>online thank you Yan for your excellent<br>excellent uh supervision mentoring I<br>have learned lot of things about<br>research about Administration about<br>dedin with from Ian<br>soan suggested Ian convinced me that I<br>should take this opportunity I should<br>take this Challenge and make it as an<br>opportunity so well I will be developing<br>dry inhalers Ino and also in New<br>Zealand so because these as my and COPD<br>I did and my super boers are doing this<br>I thought I'm going going to do a new<br>one for long infections<br>particularly<br>TB why TB or why lung infections well<br>annually 1.5 billion people die of TV<br>that's more than D people right and 2<br>billion people now today have this<br>bacteria they are carrying this bacteria<br>one in three people in the world<br>carrying this<br>bacteria this bacteria can turn to<br>active TB<br>anytime now what is the current<br>treatment we give tablets or capsules or<br>injections and those are like that they<br>are not<br>targeting because those tablets goes to<br>all over the<br>body but we need those medicine in the<br>lung because TV JS in the lung only two<br>to four% of the drug goes to the lung<br>which is insufficient to kill the<br>microor organism leading to either<br>treatment failure or drug<br>resistance so drug resistance is a big<br>problem because you need to take 16 to<br>20 tablets per<br>day uh for and two to four injections<br>like a 2 to 3<br>years almost roughly calculation 22,000<br>tablet and 3,000 injection for a drug<br>for treating a drug resistant TV<br>so I thought no forget that I'll be<br>delivering drugs by<br>inhalation and that's the best choice<br>for any lung disease you give by<br>inhalation because you can you are<br>directly giving drugs to the lung the<br>location of disease in that way you can<br>ensure higher concentration at lower<br>drugs than tablet or capsule you can<br>have less side effects in other organs<br>or and you can have a very quick action<br>people who use Asma inhaler you know<br>click within seconds you you feel better<br>so action is quicker and it is more<br>effective so for any lung disease think<br>delivery well as I mentioned before as<br>my inhalers the dose maximum .5 millgram<br>and we call them loo inhaler so the<br>formulation type we<br>used before<br>which gives only 10 to 15% delivery will<br>formulation that like because the TV or<br>any lung infection you may need to<br>inhale up to 100 milligram<br>drug it is still much better much better<br>than taking 4 G of drug right so we<br>started this we call this Hydro inhaler<br>so our first approach was how we can<br>make a formulation which can deliver<br>100% to the<br>lung not 15%<br>100% well we have an uh we had these<br>spread dryer at uh in the pharmacy I<br>have never used that before but I<br>thought okay let's try with this let's<br>try with this and then what we did we<br>got a drug and to prepare a dry powder<br>we prepare uh particles which is 1 to 5<br>Micron size that we can inhale then the<br>this is the new technique there is a<br>sticky drug many drugs are sticky so we<br>tried like a pen non-sticky pen we're<br>going to do a non-sticky non-sticky<br>coating on this sticky drug so we tried<br>we tried months after month how we can<br>make a a nonsticky drug we can quot it<br>uh like a sticky drug we can quote by a<br>non-sticky material and that's M was my<br>first PhD students and also he was<br>co-supervised by Professor Yan taker two<br>reasons he wanted to co- supervis the<br>student and he wanted to teach me<br>supervision okay so uh with his help and<br>then I uh together we are successful to<br>prepare this um particle as you can see<br>they are discrete particles they are<br>really non-sticky<br>particles by this time uh the School of<br>Pharmacy bought this um Next Generation<br>impactor a very key instrument for<br>inhalation<br>delivery with this machine we call it<br>artificial lung with this machine you<br>can measure how much drug can go to the<br>Deep lung so that was necessary and<br>thanks uh the School of Pharmacy<br>so see the result the sticky spread R<br>particles what we have produced 30% can<br>go to deep lung but the non-sticky<br>particles which have produced 80% drug<br>can go to deep lung so with that student<br>we are successful with up to here and<br>this has increased many possibilities<br>many possibilities now you can choose<br>different iner<br>coating you can choose other Coatings<br>and see whether they can are useful you<br>can choose another drug which can which<br>can coat and increase just you need to<br>choose a drug which can uh which can<br>give a like a non-sticky<br>coating<br>also also you can choose like a two drug<br>which can give fortified action like a<br>synergistic action also you can choose<br>drug for not only one disease you can<br>choose drug for two disease three<br>dise so you can reduce the number of<br>medications you need to<br>take so well uh this continued we we did<br>all these different ways to<br>produce uh formulations for T TV we also<br>produce formulations to treat this drug<br>resistant<br>TV not only PhD students even these<br>honor students worked on that and they<br>published with the guidance of PhD<br>myself now we are publishing but the<br>thing is there is no product for TV at<br>that time so we thought we going to when<br>prash Katka join he is a PhD student and<br>he was co-supervised by um he is my<br>third PhD student I'll show my second<br>PhD student after this third PhD student<br>was not supervised by Yan he said after<br>first two he said it's now your your<br>turn so I talked to philli and Philip<br>agreed to co-supervise that and then we<br>thought we're going to do now product<br>based because we need to bring something<br>for the for the real uh<br>patients to do that we need to do uh<br>invo studies so what we did we did Inu<br>studies like animal studies with this<br>proc did and Pro<br>car helped during that time and he's<br>also co-supervised by Jack Damar Philly<br>Phil and trajes and<br>P after that now the real time for<br>clinical translation now we need to do<br>clinical studies and it was like a jack<br>because I cannot do clinical studies<br>directly I can produce the formulation<br>so Jack dmer and Philipi they are doing<br>the clinical studies we are working on<br>formulation so this TV<br>project has lot of<br>impact lot of impact it has potential to<br>save millions millions of people the<br>only thing is millions of people are<br>affected and mostly are from third world<br>countries so the pharmaceutical<br>Industries are not that very interested<br>to invest on that they don't find money<br>for that so it is it is required for<br>people like us people like you to look<br>after those people who we really want to<br>help the<br>mankind so yes this project has given me<br>funding from locally and also from HRC<br>but the and I was invited by all the<br>international conferences including this<br>respiratory drug delivery conference<br>which is the Premier conference for<br>inhal delivery we have got local and<br>International<br>that let's take a break and have a learn<br>here when we Two drugs when we mix two<br>drugs it is not always we can quote<br>those<br>drug it's not always a qued<br>material when we releasee when we mix<br>two<br>drugs they are orderly if they are<br>orderly arranged we call them<br>crystalline<br>material if there are there is no<br>Arrangement particular arrangement we<br>call them coam system that's the easiest<br>definition I can give<br>today so the student basant started he<br>was my second PhD student and<br>co-supervised by<br>Yan so boson started and boson said<br>he'll be making a um co- crystalline<br>system utilizing to drugs of two<br>different characteristics he wanted to<br>reduce the dissolution of a drug so he<br>chose a drug which is highly soluble<br>here highly soluble drug Moxy<br>fluxin and he choose a drug Which is<br>less water soluble and he mix together<br>to make a Co Crystal so that the<br>solubility decrease<br>that's what he was successful as you can<br>see it's like a permeation dissolution<br>and then<br>absorption to measure this dissolution<br>challenge those who are here who knows<br>about dissolution like how drug dissolve<br>when we take the dissolution of orally<br>taken medicine in the<br>stomach is completely different from<br>dissolution in the lung<br>because in stomach we do it's for 50<br>years we do by one liter of<br>fluid but in lung there is only probably<br>50 microl fluid um spread over 100<br>square uh meter of<br>surface and well we have a fantastic<br>engineer Kevin in this school and Kevin<br>helped us to prepare uh this custom made<br>dissolution apparatus through which we<br>can can now use only 50 microl 50 microl<br>of fluid you know microl is a thousands<br>of a<br>milliliter so 50 micr of fluid with this<br>dissolution now the other student<br>bishal he wanted to do that Co amorphus<br>not coating and he did this COA system<br>for different drugs for Respiratory<br>infection and he was successful of doing<br>that increase the Deep lung<br>delivery and<br>finally uh he was co-supervised by<br>Gardon now is the time to a break so I<br>went for to<br>University of Texas at Austin for a sub<br>article only for 3<br>months well uh my host was uh a h SM<br>he's an a<br>Alum this is good they're very good for<br>few things number one H SM asked me<br>whether I have done patent for this Co<br>Crystal I said<br>no how come you should have done a<br>pattern fast for that because that's the<br>against the flow normally people do<br>increase the<br>dis increase the dissolution and you you<br>have decreased the dissolution so that's<br>the matter<br>that's a good thing for patent I said<br>okay I have learned that but probably<br>you invest more we invest less but it's<br>okay and the second thing I learned they<br>have a<br>technique where which through which you<br>can deliver which develop particles of<br>thermosensitive drug like biologics so<br>learn that and also at teaching they<br>have some Advanced teaching technique so<br>I with all those I was coming but<br>because it was Christmas time there are<br>all Christmas LS around in Austin and<br>also I I'm sure you know it the barbecue<br>Austin barbecue so we did not miss it<br>and after that just one week before um<br>the first case in New<br>Zealand I was here luckily in D I came<br>back now Co started so many of many<br>people at that time understood okay it's<br>co is a long delivery<br>a lung disease so we need to have<br>something on Long delivery and many<br>people contacted me from industry or<br>Academia but it's a<br>lockdown and I need a um I need a<br>biologist to work in work Prof Miguel<br>mat and he has so many projects and then<br>finally he agreed and tar Shah was a PhD<br>student and tar worked on that and we<br>got we developed few few formulations<br>for that but by this time we developed<br>formulations world has gone further okay<br>however some of our formulations have<br>synergistic effect and we did it with<br>the help of Professor Miguel<br>mat now we are moving to other<br>respiratory<br>infections and we are moving for COPD<br>now we are moving for comorbidities like<br>a cupd and lung infection<br>together if we because many of the cupd<br>patients if they get lung<br>infection we can develop a formulations<br>which can treat both together<br>right and also the other thing I learned<br>biologics sishi Rish was a PhD student<br>he is co supervised<br>by Rajesh K Andor<br>grea so from RK we got micro RNA we<br>thought okay because RNA is a big thing<br>during Co time so we going to try now<br>this micr RNA we are trying as nanop<br>particle uh for CD and utilizing that<br>spray fridge drying Technique we are<br>making micro<br>particles micro particles of biologics<br>this is opened as an area that we can<br>molecule probably you have heard that<br>cannabis it's good thing in many<br>countries like it's increasingly<br>becoming popular I can tell you I went<br>to Amsterdam and I was smelling cannabis<br>on the street okay so but uh cannabis<br>has a high effect but it's constituents<br>like a canab dial which is very active<br>against asman COPD but it doesn't have<br>high effect but it has some formulation<br>problem it is very poorly water<br>soluble so student Kamal is a PhD<br>student she was very interested okay I<br>said let's do it canabal inhaler it took<br>10 months to permission uh to take the<br>permission to work with that now we<br>developed this<br>inhaler canab inhaler Professor Michel<br>glass is co supervising this project and<br>also we have talk profess Bob Handcock<br>we are thinking of taking it to the<br>patient<br>level there is a personal story<br>here one day I went home from the<br>University and there was a news on TV<br>about babes harmful effects and my<br>daughter at that time she was in high<br>schooler she convinced me that I should<br>work on babes because this is a lung it<br>affects lung and she was also in high<br>school and and she noticed that some of<br>the high schoolers also<br>B well I did two projects of that one is<br>understanding what are the formulations<br>are they really harmful for the<br>lung that was done by this honor student<br>nicool<br>Ood and the second project was not only<br>school students because I was I car was<br>Professor car was interested so I talked<br>to him he was interested let's start<br>with the University student because<br>going to school students will require a<br>lot of Ethics thing so ultimately we<br>needed a lot of Ethics thing and we did<br>a survey on University of Oro<br>students in 2020 and again this year we<br>are so happy because more than 3,000<br>responses we have got from student just<br>in one<br>week and uh I'm not disclosing the<br>results now because we are preparing the<br>manuscript there is a trend what you can<br>feel also when you work in when you walk<br>in J Street that's you can feel you can<br>get the true data for what is happening<br>in the uh among the<br>students well some of the awards I have<br>got for Publications and research and<br>last year I got this award from drug<br>delivery to the lung this is a career<br>development<br>award the students who have contributed<br>to my research these are students po uh<br>visiting researcher some students many<br>of are missing because I couldn't found<br>all the<br>pictures um they they have done very<br>well as as mentioned some of the<br>students have directly got job offer<br>immediately after submission three PhD<br>student just flew to the US a very good<br>in unities um and there two students<br>thought that they will be staying here<br>in danin in New Zealand they're here uh<br>even the honor students were very<br>productive and I was privileged to have<br>this award for supervision from the Osa<br>and from the UK Council for graduate<br>them it was not possible with without<br>these fantastic people they are from<br>danin they are from New Zealand they are<br>from Asia<br>Australia or the us or<br>Europe they have helped<br>me these are the people only uh given<br>here who I worked or published after I<br>otago yes you know teaching was my<br>teaching was my passion you understand<br>now<br>so yes I'm I was happy to have all this<br>but this one I loved it students can<br>lecturer now<br>in uh when the co<br>started we thought that oh how come we<br>don't do anything just the day before<br>like a we thought we're going to prepare<br>some hand<br>sanitizer to help the essential workers<br>in the University I just immediately<br>talked to Professor<br>carera he was so happy to support<br>immediately in fact thank you Carlo he<br>was always supportive to my new ideas<br>and supportive to my growth here in the<br>University thank you<br>Carlo so he supported and I we prepared<br>around 100 L of hand sanitizer just on<br>the day before the lockdown<br>and we hand over to the university I<br>don't<br>know next day I got a letter from the<br>then Vice Chancellor Professor Harin<br>Hayne she wrote she highly encouraged me<br>and my students to continue to this do<br>this work and she declared us as an<br>essential workers and she said she going<br>to fund all the expenses for<br>that while students while every like<br>staying home was a strategy to keep you<br>safe my students and I came out to<br>prepare hand sanitizer manually in the<br>lab and we during this covid lockdown we<br>prepare more than 1,00 lit of hand<br>sanitizer<br>manually why we cannot do it how can we<br>not do it because I have got like a<br>emails like that around 100 emails from<br>people who needed this highly sought<br>after liquid gold at that time to help<br>the most vulnerable<br>community so I did<br>it and like a that we maintaining all<br>everything even after that like a even<br>after like a in 2022 after the volcanic<br>eruption in<br>Tonga we prepared hand szer to help<br>them and um I also arranged not only<br>prepare hand sanitizer I also arranged<br>some Workshop in the New Zealand<br>international science festival to<br>increase the<br>awareness for the uh general public and<br>during that time I also did some um uh<br>some workshop for like a inhaler<br>use this Heart Center project had a very<br>good like a media<br>attention and I was declared as a q Bank<br>Local Hero medalist in<br>2021 and University our group was the<br>University's nominee for health science<br>volunteer award although we did not<br>finally win<br>fine uh uh dear and these are not thing<br>I am very excited by this that this is<br>this email came from an ordinary women<br>ordinary person in New Zealand who are<br>very impressed by and grateful for our<br>initiative what we have<br>done with that i' would like to<br>acknowledge now I'm definitely<br>acknowledging the almighty God uh<br>without his help we cannot do<br>anything I acknowledge my family shra my<br>wife and my two daughters shamal Lia and<br>shal<br>Lima I realize I should have given much<br>more time to you over these<br>24<br>years I should have given much more time<br>23 years<br>now<br>uh I acknowledge my parents and<br>sisters in fact you know when we brought<br>up<br>with sisters and me we never thought<br>that we going to live in three<br>countries I miss them every day I miss<br>my parents every day it was not the goal<br>when I was studying it was not the goal<br>but this is the reality<br>now I I acknowledge my mentors I<br>acknowledge my<br>I acknowledge my undergraduate students<br>they're fantastic they have made me a<br>teacher because I always seek advice<br>from them feedback from<br>them I acknowledge my postgraduate<br>students honor students visiting this<br>and<br>collaborators and not only about<br>research I always seek uh feedback from<br>them uh after um after their uh<br>completion administ<br>stop you<br>know they go through lot of pains for<br>me sometimes they so they are the person<br>help me a<br>lot acknowledge my<br>friends and my community<br>members this is very important for me<br>because without uh in a country in a<br>place like a dedin we have lot of<br>friends here you can see see the<br>diversity but we still find it's it's<br>like water if we talk to community<br>friends it gives us it um like a good<br>feeling and the finally the grand bodies<br>and thank you all for listening tonight<br>ten Koto k for those of you who don't<br>know me I'm a recently retired<br>professor and I have the great pleasure<br>of of thanking Shia Alfa today for your<br>amazing talk I think we can all<br>understand why you win so many teaching<br>Awards um you've given us a an amazing<br>um lecture with both content and great<br>delivery so thank you and I guess<br>deliver is quite relevant for what you<br>do so um I think we've leared that shyal<br>is truly an international researcher<br>academic he um has shown great endurance<br>has amazing passion and I don't think<br>any of us can be Untouched by<br>that but also he has great cre<br>creativity in what he's<br>done his research and as somebody who<br>does take an and halem every day um it's<br>quite relevant to me um the work you've<br>done has has significant impact for all<br>of us around here and for the community<br>and the World At<br>Large you affect all the work you've<br>done is clearly relevant to<br>patients it's unusual even in this<br>University for so many for somebody to<br>collaborate so broadly and just looking<br>around the audience you have people here<br>from all over the university as well as<br>the wider community so well done it<br>takes a lot of time and care to be able<br>to collaborate that well so thank<br>you the work that you did on with hand<br>sanitizer truly did make a difference um<br>within the university because we all<br>benefited from it but also for the<br>communities who are struggling to get<br>sufficient sanitizers so thank thank you<br>with you're a very busy man I'm not sure<br>how you've managed to fit it all in but<br>you obviously<br>have when we think about um promotion to<br>to Professor we do expect people to be<br>amazing researchers teachers as well as<br>to um give outstanding service and I<br>think there's no doubt that Jamal you've<br>done all three so thank you I think the<br>University is really lucky to have you<br>here and we hope that you'll stay and<br>make continue to make the need in your<br>home now I do have a small token of the<br>so and oh good done yeah do you want to<br>try again<br>than<br>you great and then just to finish off<br>this this evening I'm going to hand over<br>to the pro Vice Chancellor of Health<br>Sciences making good thanks Helen um so<br>it is my pleasure just to finish us off<br>tonight and again say thank you and I<br>think um we've all leared a lot and<br>understand a lot more about the delivery<br>of drugs um and and the contribution<br>you've made to um the profession um and<br>the changes that happen around as a<br>result of that so thank you um I'm going<br>to welcome you all now to join us in the<br>staff club uh for some uh drinks and<br>food to celebrate um shamal's um<br>promotion to Professor so thank you all</p></main><footer style="margin-top: 2rem; background: #0001; padding: 2rem; text-align: center;"><p>We Are The University</p><ul style="list-style-type:
