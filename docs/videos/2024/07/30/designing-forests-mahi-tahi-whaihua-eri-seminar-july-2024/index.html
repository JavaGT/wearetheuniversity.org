In New Zealand, however, forest management has prioritised one benefit at a time, such as conservation or timber production, potentially resulting in unintended consequences. The dynamic interplay of global change, technological advancements, and evolving societal expectations necessitates a paradigm shift in forest management practices. <br><br>Globally, forest stewardship emphasizes the pursuit of multiple benefits concurrently, offering valuable lessons for New Zealand. Integrating multi-purpose forest systems and incorporating trees into diverse landscapes can enhance resilience and sustainability. Embracing this holistic approach opens avenues for a greater range of forest management models, including: nature-based, ecological, or continuous-cover forestry; indigenous plantations; agroforestry; and, urban forestry. The transition towards diversified forest management approaches in New Zealand holds immense potential for addressing complex challenges while maximizing benefits.  <br><br>Yvette will introduce Scion with a particular focus the full-benefits of standing trees and forests, and forest systems that balance multiple benefits.  She will present a vision for a potential future of forestry in New Zealand, with examples from current work in New Zealand and past work in North America.  <br> <br>Yvette Dickinson is a Silvicultural Scientist at Scion and the Portfolio Leader for Designing Forests – Mahi Tahi Whaihua. Her research navigates the intersection of forest ecology and management. She applies forest ecology principles to the sustainable management of our forests for a wide variety of benefits. Yvette uses empirical field experiments and modelling to understand the influence of our management on stand dynamics and the provision of ecosystem services. She has worked in a wide variety of forest ecosystems, including native forests and exotic forest plantations of New Zealand, mixed hardwoods in eastern United States, and the conifer forests of the Southern Rockies. She holds a Bachelor of Forestry Science and Master of Science in Environmental Science from the University of Canterbury, and a Ph.D. in Forest Resources from Pennsylvania State University.</p><h2>Transcript</h2><p style="opacity: 0.9; font-size: 0.8em">Transcripts may be automatically generated and may not be 100% accurate.</p><p>thank you very much for for joining us<br>for this um er seminar um our guest<br>speaker<br>is um and uh she is from s and she will<br>us uh yeah I I can take it from you if<br>you like thank you very much and thank<br>you very much for inviting me to to come<br>talk um yeah so my name is AET Dickinson<br>I'm one of the portfolio leaders and<br>also a scientist at um Scion over in<br>roro uh and so uh a little bit of my<br>background I'm I guess I would call<br>myself a forest ecologist Sometimes some<br>um more often you'll hear me call me a<br>silver culturalist which is basically a<br>forest ecologist that likes to work in<br>forests that are managed for some<br>purpose um often that is Timber but not<br>always so um I've worked in all sorts of<br>different systems both here and New<br>Zealand and both our industrial forests<br>and also our native forest and also um I<br>worked for a little while over in North<br>America in um Pennsylvania Colorado and<br>then up in Michigan uh so what I wanted<br>to talk with you guys today about is<br>some of the work that we're doing at<br>Sion um and so I called my um my<br>portfolio that I lead is called<br>designing Forest<br>Mah um Mah really refers to to um<br>working together as one uh and so it<br>refers to the idea that we're managing<br>forests for multiple purposes but also<br>that we have many people working<br>together for um kind of one one ABC um<br>first of all I want to apologize to<br>those that really love data and numbers<br>you're not going to see a whole lot of<br>that today um what I wanted to do was<br>spend a bit of time introducing Sion<br>because I'm not sure um how familiar<br>people are with what we do um a little<br>bit about the kind of area that I work<br>in within Sion and then a little bit of<br>a a potential vision of where forestry<br>could go in New Zealand um and and<br>you'll see why it's so connected to some<br>of the things that I think folks are<br>interested in here um I also want to<br>just acknowledge that a lot of this work<br>is not my own um some of it is my own<br>with graduate students some of it is<br>work that we're doing at Sion um and so<br>um I'm more than happy to to answer<br>questions and dive more deeply but I may<br>also um hand you off to my colleagues<br>that knowah h of a lot more about some<br>of these topics um but I'm always happy<br>to connect and I I that was one of my<br>hopeful purposes of this talk was to<br>really connect with folks so that you<br>have a bit a bit of an understanding of<br>what we're really interested in and<br>maybe find some connections as well um<br>so that we can work together with other<br>folks<br>zon no but let's try<br>this there we go I'll use some mouse so<br>our vision at Sion is is prosperity from<br>trees um and you'll notice that's really<br>broad um at Sion um we are one of the<br>crown research institutes we're one of<br>the smallest ones so we are essentially<br>a government owned company um but we're<br>interested in what sometimes I call um<br>nose to tail forestry so we do<br>everything from breeding trees genetics<br>working in the nurseries to produce<br>seedlings through to um planting them in<br>forests managing forests harvesting them<br>turning them into products um wood<br>products in particular but also some of<br>the bioplastics and other products bio<br>energy so we do the whole gamut and we<br>also do lot of social science and we're<br>not just interested in or working in you<br>know radiat Pine Plantation forestry<br>industry um we do a lot of work both in<br>in Native forests and in other types of<br>exotic forests as well so really all<br>trees in the landscape and we're moving<br>also outside of forest SE States as well<br>as you'll<br>see so our purpose is really to drive<br>Innovation and growth from New Zealand's<br>forestry wood product and wood derived<br>materials and other biomaterial sectors<br>to create economic value and contribute<br>to beneficial environmental and social<br>outcomes for New Zealand so we're not<br>just interested in financial outcomes we<br>are very focused on<br>sustainability um those wider<br>environmental benefits and those wider<br>social benefits as<br>well and our vision really is what we're<br>calling the new circular bioeconomy this<br>is definitely one of those catchphrases<br>that you'll hear<br>um across the globe being used um but<br>the idea being that um wood and wood<br>products can basically replace<br>everything that you can use steel<br>concrete by petrochemicals for um in<br>addition to replacing those materials<br>that might have some<br>environmental um negative outcomes the<br>growing of forests themselves standing<br>forests have a lot of benefits for us um<br>things like climate mitigating climate<br>change um habitat for<br>biodiversity erosion controls um clean<br>air protecting clean air and Soil and<br>Water but also not just creating these<br>products but also recycling them as well<br>so the idea that we want to replace the<br>use of those<br>petrochemicals by using bioproducts but<br>then we want to be able to continually<br>cycle through and reuse them so we have<br>Folks at Sion that are really interested<br>in that part of the the um potential<br>well uh so just also wanted to wave the<br>flag for forestry in New Zealand a<br>little bit um in that it is actually<br>quite an important industry for New<br>Zealand it's maybe one that doesn't get<br>it as recognized as important as it is<br>um so depending what year and how you<br>account for it it's it's one of our kind<br>of top three four export earners for New<br>Zealand up there with things like<br>tourism Dairy um beef sheep and beef<br>that kind of those kinds of Industries<br>um so typically it's about a six billion<br>a year um income into New Zealand from<br>our exports which is about 1.6 of the<br>GDP um but if we were to move to that<br>circular bioeconomy Vision we we've<br>estimated that that's maybe up to a $30<br>billion economic proposition for New<br>Zealand and that forests in New Zealand<br>just occupy quite a bit of our landscape<br>as well it's about 38% of our landscape<br>as Forest whether that's indigenous<br>forests or the productive industrial<br>forests or just other forests across the<br>landscape and then employing a lot of<br>people as well so about 35,000 people in<br>New Zealand employed directly um and a<br>lot of those jobs are in the regions as<br>cities um so Sion we are one of the<br>smaller Cris um last year we had about<br>348 employees that's a little bit lower<br>this year um we have been around for a<br>long time we're not new so we have a<br>history been around about 75 years in<br>different formats um and in terms of<br>company size we we have about $64<br>million of Revenue a year so just to<br>give you an idea of of um how big we are<br>research so really to achieve our vision<br>of prosperity from trees um with the<br>organization has broken down into three<br>main areas um three impact areas we talk<br>about forest and Landscapes which is<br>where I sit in the<br>organization um we've got another area<br>my colleagues um who are focused on<br>Forest to Timber Products and then a<br>third area Forest to biobased products<br>and between those three impact areas um<br>we really have this vision of being able<br>to um support New Zealand economy which<br>is really important obviously um but<br>that also supports communities provides<br>jobs um there's a role for for forestry<br>and Ma Economic Development which is<br>quite important um but also we've got<br>the twin Global crises of climate change<br>and<br>biodiversity and a number of other um<br>social uh challenges um facing us<br>globally with for we see a role in<br>forests um to mitigate that so the<br>forest and Landscapes area is really<br>focused on those trees for standing<br>values um both exotic and Indigenous<br>forests um my two colleagues and I that<br>work in this area<br>um they they're focused on establishing<br>indigenous for so very much focused on<br>restoration um trying to um increase<br>Nursery production of indigenist trees<br>and bring down the costs of restoration<br>and figure out how can we do it on on<br>big<br>scales um my other colleague is leading<br>an area called restoration protection at<br>Mori<br>OT which is very much around the bio<br>security and health of our native<br>forests so thinking about carry dck mle<br>rust and some of those other diseases<br>and and threats as well as climate<br>change and<br>wildfire and then there's my area<br>designing forests which I'll um talk a<br>little bit more about um and talk<br>through what what our goals within<br>designning<br>Foresters uh across and my colleagues um<br>in the forest and Timber Products area<br>they're they're very much focused more<br>on industry so thinking about how do we<br>sustainably Produce High Volume high<br>quality Timber Products very focused on<br>this idea that wood can replace things<br>like concrete and steel um that that can<br>help um combat climate change because<br>you won't have those emissions coming<br>from those building materials but also<br>that you can have actually negative<br>carbon building so there's more carbon<br>stored in the building and these massw<br>Timber pay raisers than um as emitted<br>and the construction of those buildings<br>and if you want to see a great example<br>um come visit us over in R we've got a<br>building over there that's just been<br>constructed in the last four years which<br>is Caron negative um it's really amazing<br>three stories um solid wood in all those<br>places you would normally see concrete<br>um and there's now globally buildings<br>hundreds of stories high going up that<br>are solid wood and messwood buildings so<br>there uh and then Foresta biobased<br>products very focused on bioplastics<br>replacing pictr chemical type<br>Plastics um packaging for food and other<br>products is a major challenge so<br>thinking about how can we use wood based<br>packaging um bioenergy being another<br>area and particular particularly those<br>um uses of energy that are very hard to<br>replace where batteries Sol electrical<br>wind so we're thinking like Marine<br>biofuels as one major area it's an area<br>that's very hard to replace with those<br>other<br>Technologies um so there's some really<br>exciting work happening in<br>there okay so focusing on designing<br>Forest mAh<br>so our vision in this area is Forest<br>systems that are really designed around<br>the needs and values of communities that<br>restore enhance New Zealand's natural<br>Capital delivering sustainable and<br>resilient portfolios of ecosystem<br>functions and Equitable outcomes over<br>Generations so really focused on<br>sustainability focused on forests for<br>their their values as forests um and<br>thinking about those multiple benefits<br>that that we can get at the same time<br>full range of ecosystem Services coming<br>from these these<br>forests and um we're not limited to<br>thinking about just indigenous or just<br>exotic forests we're rather species<br>agnostic um and so we are thinking about<br>places where we might mix those together<br>or where um natives or exotic species<br>advantages uh and so I think the the<br>information on this slide will be<br>nothing new to people within er um I'm<br>very much preaching to the choir here<br>but um globally we're facing some really<br>big challenges so obviously um in the<br>top corner there we've got climate<br>change it seems to be um a real<br>increasing focus it is a crisis and we<br>are um really focused on thinking about<br>how to mitigate that with virus but also<br>how do we adapt and prepare for the<br>change that's coming um and I know that<br>uh using forests to mitigate climate<br>change is somewhat controversial I'm not<br>suggesting that that's the solution um<br>but I think it is one solution and a<br>whole Suite of different things we<br>should be doing I think where where it<br>can be useful is buying us a little bit<br>more time can offer a solution in the<br>short term while we figure out the root<br>cause of the problem and actually make<br>with climate change is coming all these<br>really extreme events that we've started<br>seeing here and overseas so we have like<br>the events that happened in T and HKS<br>Bay in<br>2023 um where we had really intense<br>storms um lots of water high winds and<br>erosion occurring that's a place where<br>we think forestry or trees maybe not<br>forestry as people picture it trees can<br>help play a role in that to mitigate th<br>those erosion that that erosion we're<br>seeing and sedimentation that we're<br>seeing in some of those<br>Landscapes of course I can't talk about<br>that without talking about the slash<br>problem absolutely that's somewhere that<br>we need to make some changes in what<br>we're doing um I'm not going to deny<br>that at all um what you might not be<br>aware is in that same event in southern<br>TPO Tangi area there was massive windrow<br>that happened really strong ones that<br>funnel through there um there was a one<br>company in particular that lost a huge<br>amount of forest um as you can imagine<br>as a company that's trying to grow a<br>product over a 20 to 30 year rotation<br>length um losing a huge amount of your<br>estate on one event is is can be<br>catastrophic uh because essentially it<br>it hits the ground and starts decaying<br>and you need to either use it really<br>quickly or figure out some other way of<br>starting replanting The New Forest so we<br>need to think about how do we build<br>forests that are able to deal with some<br>of these extreme events we also have in<br>parts of the globe um insect and disease<br>outbreaks occurring due to climate<br>change at least in part and we have the<br>Direct effects of drought and heat<br>stress and on top of that we've got the<br>biodiversity crisis um occurring as well<br>and olya forests can play a huge role in<br>that<br>crisis um while Plantation forests and<br>some of the Exotic forests aren't going<br>to create perfect old growth habitat<br>they are still really valuable habitats<br>um and so there's some various roles<br>that we think these forests or or new<br>landscape and so I think um some of the<br>stuff that um David Hall a couple of<br>years ago actually um really nailed it<br>for what um my vision is for the<br>potential future of of forests and land<br>use and in New Zealand where we're<br>moving from a really siloed world into a<br>more interwoven world<br>so just generalizing across New Zealand<br>at the moment we've got really strong<br>native conservation Forest which we<br>manage really intensively for one<br>purpose<br>conservation we've got these ex exotic<br>commercial forests which we manage<br>really intensively we're literally world<br>leaders in terms of production forestry<br>but we're managing them for one purpose<br>and then we've got these P pastoral<br>agricultural Landscapes which once again<br>we're we're managing basically for one<br>purpose um I jokingly say new zealanders<br>don't do multiple things at once very<br>well but in this this Vision that we<br>have for the future or I have for the<br>future<br>um we can start putting trees in more<br>places across the landscape integrating<br>them in so not replacing one you know<br>agriculture with forestry but rather<br>integrating them in to get the best of<br>both worlds using trees and a really<br>sustainable smart way to prepare for<br>climate change and mitigate climate<br>change and help with the the<br>biodiversity crisis and these other<br>challenges that we're facing so we might<br>start to see systems a bit more like the<br>egg forestry type systems we might start<br>to see more mixed Plantation Forest so<br>we're not just having one species that's<br>at risk to outbreaks and disease but<br>rather um hitching our bits and and um<br>mitigating that<br>risk yes carbon forests I think are part<br>of that solution whether they're exotic<br>or<br>native um potentially some of the uh<br>natural-based Solutions um or nature<br>based forestry close to Nature forestry<br>it's sometimes called um sometimes<br>called continuous cover forestry those<br>are all cins really for one thing which<br>is managing um complex indigenous<br>forests on a sustainable basis where<br>you're maintaining the forest while<br>still<br>Haring but we're still<br>maintaining those original uses that we<br>already had we're all really good at<br>conservation forests we're really good<br>at plantations we're really good at<br>agriculture let's keep doing that but<br>system so a couple of years ago um a<br>group of asset Zion published a paper um<br>that was focused on transitional<br>forestry but we proposed that rather<br>than just focus focusing on these<br>transitions of exotic through the native<br>forests that we actually need to think<br>about how do we go from this very uh<br>single use kind of Forestry of reserves<br>and Plantation<br>to having more of these this gray area<br>in between where we're managing for<br>multiple purposes getting multiple<br>benefits from the same time at the same<br>time from these forests um and there's a<br>whole Suite of potential options a<br>rainbow of different Forest systems we<br>could use so we still want to keep um<br>that intensive conservation things like<br>Mainland Islands indigenous conservation<br>forests we want to keep those we're not<br>going to um necessarily change what we<br>do there but to we want to add to that<br>things like the Exotic to indigenous<br>transitions indigenous species<br>plantations the near natural<br>forestry food forests is one that we've<br>started thinking about a lot more at zon<br>um those trees integrated into<br>Farms Urban forests mixed species<br>plantations exotic cabon forests<br>alternative species plantations<br>bioenergy Forest<br>and precision silver culture so we're<br>still doing some of the the classic um<br>conventional forestry but adding to the<br>richness giving options to land<br>owners and so the area that I'm trying<br>to work in is really in that gray space<br>in the middle thinking about what other<br>ways could we do manage forests and<br>trees and I have some examples of these<br>that I wanted to share with you um some<br>of them are from New Zealand some of<br>them are from my experience over<br>um and we've already got some work<br>happening in some of<br>these so this is actually a photo from<br>Adam Forbes um who's a independent<br>consultant and expert in transition for<br>does a lot of work in transition<br>forestry um but this is an example of<br>those exotic to indigenous transitions<br>we have a lot of places in New Zealand<br>now that we have exotic Forest that we<br>might not want exotic Forest so thinking<br>about how do we move away<br>without doing a massive clearcut replant<br>sudden shift but how do we transition<br>slowly um and we also have places where<br>actually planting Exotics might help<br>take start the that restoration project<br>Pro uh restoration<br>process um that um the Exotic trees may<br>act at something of a nurse crop it may<br>also provide some advantages in terms of<br>income from the land so there there are<br>fol is<br>proposing that um you could plant exotic<br>um trees to start with have fast growth<br>and and early income from carbon<br>sequestration but then overtime<br>transition to indigenous species and get<br>the advantages of long-term indigenous<br>forests and long-term cabin<br>storage um there's a lot of science that<br>we need to figure out behind that before<br>we can make it be be confident that we<br>can do it a big scale um so there's some<br>really interesting um conversations<br>happening and early work happening in<br>that<br>space um this is an example from<br>Michigan of indigenous plantations so<br>this is Jack Pine being planted machine<br>planted um for Timber production Jack<br>Pine is a a good Timber species uh Pulp<br>and Paper and S log in in that part of<br>the world but they're also managing for<br>this warbler that's on the endangered<br>species list it's a neotropical migrant<br>that moves back and forwards between the<br>tropics and Northern Michigan region um<br>and they've had massive successes with<br>this kind of management um you'll notice<br>um the plantations have quite a unique<br>pattern to their planting essentially<br>they're trying to create that habitat<br>that the wblo really loves some openings<br>and some dense forest mixed together<br>they've seen really nice improvements in<br>the population in part because of the<br>management but they're able to do it<br>economically because of the um the way<br>that they're planting and they are able<br>to harvest these trees and move the<br>habitat around the landscape so a really<br>positive kind of<br>example Sion has been working on<br>indigenous plantations here in New<br>Zealand for quite a long time um this is<br>a photo of Greg Stewart who's recently<br>retired but he's been working on this<br>basically his whole career um and these<br>are cowy plantations so there're are<br>native species being planted with a goal<br>of of a Timber Harvest at the end but<br>getting all that benefit of a indigenous<br>species in between um and this is<br>different sites so we've got a site here<br>down in HS Bay um one um in the B PL<br>Oakland we've also looked at other<br>species so um this is remu and and totra<br>plant s once again thinking about Timber<br>production<br>eventually but using an indigenous<br>species and trying to get the advantages<br>of having an indigenous species Forest<br>um trying to get that multiple benefit<br>and we have seen at least with the carry<br>plantations that in the right place<br>under the right conditions we can get<br>growth rates really similar to radiat<br>pan so we think in some places this<br>could really work but it's still um<br>slowly another option might be um that<br>close to Nature type forestry so these<br>are actually photos from um some work I<br>I was doing in the northern Michigan<br>area again um this is a maple Beach<br>Birch forest and believe it or not um<br>the this photo of the forest is only six<br>months after a harvest um and literally<br>there is a stump you can't see it in the<br>photo but it's right in the middle of<br>that little opening that the photo is<br>taken off and so um this is a very<br>normal way of doing forestry in that<br>part of the world they're managing for<br>multiple benefits they're managing<br>native forests native species getting<br>the benefit of a Timber Harvest and that<br>social benefits that come from having a<br>a rural economy and jobs but also um<br>they've got great benefits in terms of<br>biodiversity and habit attach uh so<br>they're balancing those different uses<br>in one place um and just to demonstrate<br>that this is industrial forestry in that<br>part of the world this is the same<br>Forest when it was being harvested they<br>are um just like the harvesting systems<br>that we use here just tweak a little<br>bit and so a lot of the research that we<br>were doing there um was really looking<br>at the Ecology of the species so sugar<br>maple Yellow Birch Paper Birch white<br>pines and thinking about how that<br>matches up with different kinds of<br>forest management that we could do in<br>the different systems that we had on<br>hand and realizing that we could tweak<br>the different systems to get the<br>different species regenerating we<br>weren't planting anything so also all<br>natural regeneration but just by simply<br>changing the forest system The Way We<br>Were harvesting we were able to get<br>different benefits coming from the<br>forest um and this is something that we<br>could absolutely do in New Zealand for<br>our forest types here um prior to the C<br>being created so um in the kind of 70s<br>80s there was some research in this area<br>happening and there are some examples of<br>the original New Zealand Forest Service<br>trying to do some of this um there<br>hasn't been a lot of work more recently<br>there's been a little bit here and there<br>and the rest of the world's kind of<br>moved forward some leaps and down<br>um and I think there's a a real<br>opportunity for us to now catch up learn<br>from them and apply some of these<br>systems and new<br>potentially I'm not suggesting that we<br>need to do it on Docker State though we<br>want to keep those conservation forests<br>um but this is maybe an option that we<br>owners jumping back to New Zealand um<br>thinking about Agro forestry that<br>integration of trees and into Farms this<br>is actually an example from the south<br>wado area it's a dairy farm where<br>they're also growing a high value Timber<br>species poonia so it's an exotic<br>species but getting really good benefits<br>from mixing those two land uses together<br>they're getting ping credits from the<br>trees because this does qualify as a<br>forest they're getting income from the<br>dairy they're getting income from the<br>timber there's although it's an exotic<br>species I would argue that there's<br>better biodiversity values here than<br>maybe a traditional dairy<br>farm I'm sure that that you we could<br>debate that a little bit but um I I<br>still think it's somewhat of an<br>improvement um and that they're able to<br>protect you know soil from erosion um<br>their animals are less stressed and hot<br>summers because there's more shade<br>trying to get those multiple benefits<br>together um and I'm really SE um in the<br>work that we do that we try and move<br>away from this kind of us and them with<br>Agriculture and Forestry and move more<br>to how do we integrate the systems<br>together and get a a kind of a win-win<br>scenario um and I think we have a lot of<br>options one of our challenges is how do<br>we take a system like this running on<br>one Farm how do we actually grow it so<br>that we can do it at bigger scales more<br>reliably um so this particular farmer is<br>a farm forestry expert he's really tone<br>you know honed it for his conditions I<br>know this particular system won't work<br>everywhere but how do we develop other<br>locations I also mentioned food forests<br>as a new area that we're starting to<br>think a lot about we're very early in<br>our thinking but similarly the Food<br>Forest concept could fit into this kind<br>of Suite of tools and techniques that we<br>could have integrating different<br>together kind of changing track a little<br>bit um we've also just recently started<br>thinking more about urban forestry so<br>this is um thinking about those trees in<br>cities um Street trees and parks<br>people's<br>backyards this is quite a new area for<br>scon and we're partnering up with other<br>folks to to really see and think about<br>what our place in this area is we don't<br>want to compete we want to work together<br>um and really thinking about what do we<br>know as experts in forest forest that<br>Zion that we could learn and translate<br>into the urban<br>environments um because under climate<br>change in particular this is going to be<br>one of our biggest challenges our cities<br>are going to get hotter we're going to<br>have more of those extreme events like<br>um the flooding in Oakland um last year<br>um and after that flooding you might<br>have heard people start talking about<br>sponge cities that that's the kind of<br>concept that we're thinking about how<br>how can trees um be part of our cities<br>interg interact with the infrastructure<br>and really become um provide us with<br>those benefits we do also know that<br>Urban uh forests and green spaces have a<br>h tremendous benefit for Community<br>well-being and Community Health which is<br>is definitely within our uh vision of a<br>really prosperous New Zealand from<br>trees um so one of the things we have<br>done as in earlier this year in April we<br>teamed up with University of canbury Lan<br>here um CH city council and a few others<br>Ora and athro to put together Pro we<br>think it's the first of its kind urban<br>forestry Symposium within New Zealand<br>trying to bring together um policy<br>makers practitioners and scientists to<br>really talk about so what is the<br>challenge why aren't we seeing more<br>trees um and we have a vision that we<br>would love to see um cities with a New<br>Zealand have 30% canop cover within the<br>next couple of decades which is doable<br>but it is a challenge uh and there's<br>some real science challenges and<br>figuring out how to get there as well as<br>um really understanding the benefits of<br>it and then just the final example I<br>wanted to show you was just C and<br>Forestry this is kind our our um bread<br>and butter business at the moment<br>thinking about um how to store carbon<br>and forests but also how do we hold on<br>to it through climate change and not let<br>it um be emitted again um and it it is<br>controversal I acknowledge that but I do<br>think it has a place within New Zealand<br>and it's one of that Suite of different<br>options particularly if we could pair<br>the cabin um benefit up with other uses<br>so one of the the kind of bits of<br>feedback I often get about the area I<br>manage uh or the portfolio I lead within<br>scon is holy crap that's really<br>ambitious there's a lot in there lots of<br>different systems you're crazy how are<br>you going to do that that's a huge<br>amount of work um and one thing that I<br>keep emphasizing is it sounds really<br>disparate and disconnected but actually<br>all of these systems have some real<br>common threats and what I'm hopeful is<br>that we can learn from one area and and<br>apply it to other areas so what are some<br>of these common threads um one of my<br>colleagues in Industry John Moore um Jo<br>sometimes says well we need to put the<br>biology back into forestry and he's<br>absolutely right um for many of these<br>questions when we're thinking about new<br>systems new species changes in climate<br>we need to start thinking about the<br>basic biology of how to Forest grow how<br>the species interact what's going to<br>happen to soil and water that kind of<br>thing and we need to start thinking<br>about these forests as complex adaptive<br>systems um so we have feedback loops and<br>and those things going on which I'm sure<br>everybody listening to this um seminar<br>um is well aware of these ideas we also<br>have the impact of stress on these<br>systems and the way that these systems<br>can ameliorate stress so things like<br>climate change um is definitely one of<br>those stressors that we need we could<br>learn from one system how to respond um<br>and it can teach us about other<br>systems we have a bunch of new<br>technologies that have either come<br>online or are coming our way I'm<br>thinking the r sensing tools and some of<br>those other Technologies for monitoring<br>ecosystems um and they're not limited to<br>just one Forest system or another we<br>could use them across most of these<br>systems just the nuts and bolt of<br>understanding how to manage trees um<br>that's one of the common themes across<br>these different types of Forestry we<br>could be doing the measurement and<br>integration of different ecosystem<br>Services together um that's really<br>common across all of these<br>systems the the fact that we're focusing<br>on human and Community well-being so<br>connecting people to Forest there's a<br>lot of work that's needed needed in that<br>space um planning and governance<br>challenges that seem to be the same<br>across um these different Forest<br>systems combining those multiple<br>benefits<br>together and then applying those<br>learnings from one system to another so<br>I I'm hoping that you can see now what<br>some of those common threads are um in<br>that in that mismatch of gray area of<br>potential<br>management so as a Forester this is kind<br>of how I see the planning process for<br>forests how we decide what forests we<br>want and where we put them so we very<br>much that at the top with what is our<br>purpose what's our goals where are we<br>what are the constraints both biop<br>physical and and social economic<br>constraints and then from there that<br>drives your choices about which species<br>and what kind of management you<br>do um but in the in the coming challenge<br>um that we see we can't just think about<br>that is what's happening right now we<br>also need to think about that in terms<br>of what the future site will look like<br>what's the future of climate change and<br>that in itself is a huge challenge we<br>use a lot of kind of forest modeling<br>techniques um but that I think is one<br>place where we we need to do some real<br>focus and it's a Common Thread across<br>systems I also have been really<br>advocating for the Adaptive management<br>approach so I often get asked after<br>speaking by Forest managers of like well<br>where do we start like what do I do<br>first um and when I tell them hey um<br>we've got a little bit of research to do<br>and it's going to take us 20 years you<br>can imagine they're not very happy uh<br>and so I think um adaptive management is<br>our way forward they can't wait climate<br>change is happening biodiversity crisis<br>is happening we're seeing the effects of<br>these storms<br>um people cannot wait for scientists to<br>figure this out and then hand us the<br>solution over even if we did that the<br>problem probably will have changed by<br>the time we have the solution so the<br>idea is that we work closely across<br>Science and Industry or or land owners<br>Forest<br>managers um and work with them to figure<br>out what are the things they should be<br>trying let's monitor the outcomes of the<br>different<br>activities um let's work together to<br>figure out what's worth what isn't and<br>then learn from that and it's really a<br>cycle of continuous<br>Improvement um that shouldn't be the<br>only science we do we should do other<br>experiments as well um but we need to be<br>working really closely across with for<br>us<br>managers and just the last point that<br>I'd want to leave you with is just that<br>New Zealand is a fairly unique place um<br>some of these Management systems that<br>are being used overseas are the po<br>really um could be really valuable in<br>New Zealand but we can't just pick them<br>up and drop them in New Zealand you know<br>New Zealand has different biology<br>different kinds of sites and climates<br>and we have a really different culture<br>as well um so obviously we've got a long<br>history of of Mali CH as well um and so<br>we really have this this lovely<br>opportunity to work together and<br>co-develop these really unique versions<br>of these systems in New Zealand and<br>figure out what kind of place based<br>like so that's all I have to share with<br>you guys it's a very high level view of<br>kind of what our my vision might be um I<br>realize it's not the only Vision um but<br>I am really excited just to share it<br>with you and hear people's thoughts and<br>questions but also um this is an<br>opportunity if there's anything in here<br>that sounds kind of exciting align with<br>things that you're thinking about or<br>working on if you can see space for<br>collaboration feel free to reach out or<br>or um chat to me at any time if I'm not<br>the person I'm more than happy to also<br>connect you with other folks within Sion<br>that are working in these different<br>spaces as well so thank you very much<br>time um and I'm guessing we have a bit<br>of time for questions yeah so it looks<br>like there's two questions online I<br>think perhaps we should um open it up to<br>the room first yeah absolutely so in the<br>room would there any um questions or<br>comments yeah car um thank you so much<br>I'm totally on board with pretty much<br>all those ideas so love that um I was<br>thinking a lot about at least for aloa<br>this is a lot of what you're proposing<br>this maybe a paradigm shift can we call<br>it that major yeah kind of and so I<br>wondered what you thought about as the<br>major drivers or the butons things we<br>need change to get that Paradigm ushered<br>in absolutely so K's asking about the<br>paradigm shift and kind of what are the<br>big butons that we need to push to to<br>get that<br>shift um with some of my colleagues at S<br>I have talked a lot about the the<br>disconnect between people and forests<br>and I think that's a big part that we<br>need to overcome and I do think urban<br>forestry might be a way<br>through that really um kind of<br>connecting them with the forest that<br>that is right there um but I do think<br>that that's one of the major shifts you<br>know at the moment I I get the feeling<br>and um I'm sure social scientists have<br>looked at this um a lot more closely<br>than me but I get the feeling that a lot<br>of new zealanders you know Forest is<br>something over there with somebody does<br>something but I don't really see<br>it um I don't really connect that that's<br>where my house products come from or um<br>that's what where my food comes from or<br>whatever it is so I think that<br>disconnect is one that's a major<br>challenge for us um I also I um new<br>zealanders are very black and white and<br>now thinking about ourland juice and I<br>would like to see more of a conversation<br>about that gray space in between you<br>know I do get a lot of comments about<br>from the general public about oh for<br>that's bad you're bad for the<br>environment um and I mean they're not<br>wrong there are some things we need to<br>improve on um but there's also some<br>really cool things happening as well we<br>do have indent species in New Zealand<br>that live very happily in Plantation<br>forests and they do provide some habitat<br>values they're not all growth native<br>fors but they're also not Supermarket<br>parking lots so um I think we need to<br>have more conversation about that gray<br>space yeah but it is a paradigm shift<br>and I ack knowled that that we um some<br>of these things we definitely don't have<br>that social license at the moment to<br>yeah is there much of a price premium to<br>doing this forestry where you're not<br>just doing a c you're going in and doing<br>it curated<br>cut uh so um I guess the answer is it<br>depends and it depends on what your<br>markets are where you are those kinds of<br>things<br>um and keep in mind that we're always<br>trying to<br>match your species and your site to this<br>the system that you're trying to use so<br>um there are some really valid reasons<br>why we use Clear cats and places and<br>there are some places where it is the<br>best option particularly those species<br>that need more light need more<br>disturbance to regenerate and grow um<br>but there are other places where<br>absolutely it is the worst thing that we<br>could do<br>so it is a gray area um I think the<br>price premium comes well there's two<br>places where we could get a price<br>premium from for changing our F systems<br>one is changing the species so we do<br>have some species that are better used<br>for decorative purposes flooring<br>Furniture you can imagine those are<br>higher value maybe than something like<br>radiat which is more of<br>a a structural to and Pulp and Paper um<br>so switching species might help um we<br>need to do a lot of work to develop<br>markets for some of those that New<br>Zealand um the other place that we do<br>see price premiums is the kind of<br>labeling of sustainable products which<br>plantations can also have those labels<br>as well if they're managed in the<br>correct ways um but we do see not<br>necessarily price premium but an access<br>into markets for FSC and other certified<br>Woods<br>that are demonstrating that they're<br>sustainable yeah so I guess there's some<br>potential there but there needs to be<br>able to work as well yeah but economics<br>is a big part of this right um land<br>owners just don't have the capacity to<br>do um different kinds of management<br>without being able to see that economic<br>yeah really quick if you could quickly<br>expand on what what do you define as a<br>food forest and also how do we do Urban<br>Food Forest because I'm coming from<br>Europe and I love in Spain where you got<br>many C trees in the street yeah yes okay<br>so a food Forest is different from like<br>a Horticultural Nut Farm or fruit farm<br>it is different a food Forest has<br>multiple species mixed together um and<br>so it has has kind of<br>those it's almost like you're creating<br>an ecosystem so you have a a range of<br>different functional types if you're an<br>ecologist um so you have a multitude of<br>different products in there um and there<br>are some good examples in New Zealand of<br>this happening at smaller scales we<br>don't really know what it would look<br>like at a big scale um which we we're<br>interested in how would you scale that<br>up and and what would that look like um<br>so that's where we're in some really<br>early thinking about it um but yeah<br>Urban Food Forest is one place that<br>people are really interested so it's<br>that mashup connection between the urban<br>forestry and the benefits of trees and<br>cities but also I'm trying to connect<br>with issues around food sovereignty and<br>access to to nutritious Good Foods<br>within Urban environments um so there is<br>a real interest in that as well<br>yeah and and some great examples from<br>overseas of potential things that could<br>be happening I know um in urban<br>forestry um there is often discussions<br>and debates about the role of fruit<br>trees because if the fruits not going<br>getting used it can be a big mess um<br>which can be a negative but if you have<br>the right kind of connections to the<br>community and Distribution Systems they<br>can provide these extra benefits as well<br>yeah<br>want to check to see so if you go up to<br>the top um stop sharing but there's uh<br>there's four things in the chat oh it's<br>great to see that uh colleague Paul is<br>is online um and great to see your<br>feedback<br>Paul um and Peter<br>Casey um Peter's asking what initiatives<br>should we be taking up to help Forest<br>managers upskill and better design<br>better Forest<br>design um I think part of it is that<br>adaptive forestry adaptive management<br>cycle and getting Foresters really on<br>board with that um that they<br>unfortunately monitoring is the first<br>thing that goes every time that budgets<br>are cut but it's probably one of the<br>most important things we should be doing<br>is making sure that we're constantly<br>monitoring and learning from what we're<br>doing and<br>improving um<br>so I guess that that's one of the major<br>things um one of the other ones is just<br>greater connections between people and<br>the researchers that the industry the<br>land owners and the science that's<br>happening um and I I think all the<br>scientists um on the on the seminar will<br>understand the challenges of that Tech<br>transfer how do you take science and<br>actually turn it into something useful<br>um which is an ongoing challenge that we<br>uh so Chris is asking if Zion's<br>currently doing anything with Native<br>Beach silver<br>culture um that's a great question um I<br>do know of conversations happening um I<br>don't have examples off the top of my<br>head of um actual active research<br>happening right now that I can share um<br>but certainly there has been some<br>discussions more recently about um both<br>on the wood side of native Beach and how<br>do you know how do we use the wood what<br>could it be used for those kinds of<br>conversations as well as well how do we<br>manage those Forest<br>sustainably<br>um yeah and and I'm more than happy to<br>connect you Chris if you want to reach<br>out afterwards I can connect you with<br>some of our indigenous silver culture<br>folks if you want to dive into some more<br>details thank you yeah Joshua<br>um so you seem to say in your kind of<br>cycle of thinking that um there were<br>some decisions that would then have to<br>kind of go back into perhaps relooking<br>at the purpose of the forest and so in<br>the coastal Sciences there's the dynamic<br>adaptive halfways kind of<br>planning<br>um understanding that uh Coastal<br>sciences and forests have vastly<br>different timelines on things is there<br>something like that that could be<br>applied um to kind of consider um the<br>purposes of of forests over time and<br>perhaps where decision points might need<br>to change that purpose the forest and<br>and you're thinking and in terms of<br>climate change in terms of climate<br>um uh<br>uh other things that that could come<br>along yeah absolutely so I do know the<br>reason why I ask is that I know in the<br>climate change space there is quite a<br>bit of work happening trying to<br>understand what might happen to<br>different Forest types under climate<br>change moving forward um trying to<br>understand under different scenarios<br>what might happen um<br>and uh that that kind of research in<br>itself does give us some information<br>about what what are the challenges<br>facing um different species or different<br>Forest<br>systems and which ones do we need to be<br>worried about and trying to make changes<br>to and which ones are we you know pretty<br>confident might do okay um in the future<br>um so there is a lot of that kind of<br>work happening using Forest growth<br>models and and various climate change<br>scenarios<br>um I think in the Indigenous species<br>space my understanding is that for an<br>indigenous Forest we actually have a lot<br>less information than we do for our<br>Sonic forests with climate change um but<br>yeah absolutely we need to as kri was<br>asking um earlier um there is a paradigm<br>shift that's needed and we do need to<br>start thinking a little bit about black<br>and white forest management um and more<br>of this graay in between and um some<br>many of our potential uses and benefits<br>we get from po are compatible we can do<br>both team them up together not all of<br>them but a lot of them so we need to<br>start thinking a bit more about that<br>gray space I think um<br>yeah and we could definitely learn from<br>other land users and other Industries um<br>I think my understanding is kind of<br>Agriculture has probably done a lot more<br>on that climate change base and forry<br>yeah must have chosen the loudest<br>chair<br>um so on behalf of we' like to thank you<br>and uh thank you very much for sharing<br>your knowledge yeah absolutely and um as<br>I was saying feel free any uh anybody<br>that's online or in the room um if you<br>want to reach out at any time please do<br>that I'm more than happy to connect you<br>to other folks in s or explore some of</p></main><footer style="margin-top: 2rem; background: #0001; padding: 2rem; text-align: center;"><p>We Are The University</p><ul style="list-style-type: none;
