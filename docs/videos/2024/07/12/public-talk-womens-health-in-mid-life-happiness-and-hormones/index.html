of Oto campus and it's a<br>chance for us to showcase our Mahi our<br>expertise from our researchers and our<br>clinical researchers and and the work<br>that's going on at this University on<br>issues of of big importance to the<br>public as we're seeing here tonight by<br>all your lovely<br>faces um The Manor of women is expressed<br>in many faka to or Mari Proverbs with<br>one being<br>firea which means mothers are the hull<br>of the canoe they keep the family<br>together whether you're a mother or not<br>a woman you know we do hold the Waka<br>together um I myself know that you know<br>I'm I'm a a mother and um a young very<br>young grandmother um with sandwich<br>generation young adult children um and<br>parents who are getting to need care uh<br>that sandwich generation I find myself<br>in it uh<br>now um when I was growing up midlife<br>women's issues you know Mom and my grand<br>would mutter Darkly about the change and<br>I remember my mom got some um HRT and it<br>changed her life um she was totally<br>devoted to her Premarin pills I took far<br>too many of them she than she should<br>have but she loved them and was<br>terrified that she'd have to stop one<br>day they they changed her life but in<br>those days it wasn't spoken of women's<br>midlife issues it was grun and beer it<br>you're a woman that's what you've got to<br>do um a lot of GPS and doctors there<br>wasn't much they could do or knew about<br>or knew where to refer you and and for<br>what but it's a it's a real growing area<br>of medicine um with more and more women<br>clinicians um more and more women's<br>health um expertise and research is<br>being done more as being done now in the<br>workplace um there are some workplaces<br>having menopause Le starting which is an<br>amazing thing I would never have dreamed<br>possible um even 10 years<br>ago as a television journalist at one<br>news I remember once going to one of my<br>news editors and saying look I've got a<br>great idea for a three-part series over<br>Easter this was about 2007 2008 I'd love<br>to do uh a series on women's midlife you<br>know menopause H and I remember<br>distinctly he said to me yeah but laury<br>why would we do three stories when only<br>half the viewers are going to watch<br>them which I thought well it's a bit<br>ironic isn't it because it's 6:40 every<br>night seven nights a week um we had the<br>sports news and and<br>uh I mean I'm a sports fan I'm okay and<br>I know there's some blocks who don't<br>watch sport but surely that's not<br>everybody's watching that so I thought I<br>was sort of brushed aside and told no I<br>think I managed to get one story out and<br>it was an important one because in 2002<br>a study came out internationally<br>um which which frightened women that was<br>saying that hit was dangerous it was<br>linked to cancers it was linked to heart<br>disease I remember doing the story um<br>but of course that's been debunked that<br>study has now been disproven and HIIT<br>you know and that and there's a lot more<br>Choice it's safe and you'll be hearing a<br>little bit more about that tonight and<br>there's a lot more options for women and<br>I really wanted to get that news out<br>there but it was a bit of a struggle at<br>the time there's a growing body of<br>international research dedicated to<br>investigating women's midlife issues as<br>I said and it's research here um on this<br>campus at this University too that we<br>are involved in and an effort to improve<br>women's lives provide Treatment<br>Solutions improve screening tools and<br>early<br>diagnosis for the next hour we'll hear<br>from four experts all research and<br>clinical leaders in their field sharing<br>with us their expertise opinions and<br>evidence about women's midlife Health<br>we've got renowned gynecological<br>endocrinologist and menopause Guru Dr<br>Anna down theend end here we've got<br>highly respected gynecological<br>oncologist colposcopist and researcher<br>Bry Simco here in pink um consultant<br>psychiatrist researcher and Senior<br>lecturer in Psychiatry here on campus<br>Kate iglon Dr Kate iglon and highly<br>experienced urologist and Clinical<br>Director of Urology here at tiat Ora<br>Taha Canterbury uh Dr Giovani<br>losco um we're extremely lucky to have<br>them all here thank you all so much for<br>taking time out of your busy lives to<br>come here and talk to us today quick<br>health and safety um in the event of an<br>emergency um this is basement level so<br>you don't want to be here so those are<br>the exit doors up there to head outside<br>if you need to toilets head out to the<br>left go left and then go left again at<br>reception you'll see a there's a toilet<br>block there um for you so um let's waste<br>no more time I'll quickly introduce um<br>everybody and a little bit more about<br>them before they speak first of all Anna<br>Fenton well Dr Fenton are as highly<br>celebrated she's one of New Zealand's<br>top endocrinologists and a very strong<br>voice of advocacy and wisdom on<br>menopause she's personally helped<br>hundreds and hundreds of women myself<br>included Anna thank you navigate a path<br>through midlife with her warmth and<br>intelligence and vast knowledge and No<br>Nonsense expertise she graduated<br>medicine at the University of ockland we<br>won't hold that against you though Anna<br>here tonight followed by a PhD in bone<br>density at the University of Melbourne<br>has worked as a consultant<br>endocrinological gynecologist for many<br>years here in Canterbury and Oxford<br>Woman's Health of course she's clinical<br>lead for bone dense hometry at Tata Ora<br>waitaha Canterbury she's the immediate<br>past president on the executive Council<br>of the austral Asian menopause society<br>and she was the first New Zealand doctor<br>certified by the North American<br>menopause society as a specialist<br>menopause practitioner Anna has among<br>many things served as a member on the<br>board of osteoporosis New Zealand and<br>her areas of expertise as well as<br>menopause are premature a Varian failure<br>premenstrual syndrome in pmdd polycystic<br>ovarian syndrome osteoporosis and and<br>Metabolic Bone Disease she's also a<br>senior research fellow uh in our<br>campus's department of psychological<br>medicine she's been involved in um work<br>we've done and research work on<br>polycystic ovarian syndrome and there's<br>a a wonderful study um which is going<br>through the funding application process<br>which she's um hopefully going to be<br>involved in and Kate too on um women in<br>menopause and um their cognitive health<br>so that's uh that sounds great um May I<br>welcome Anna Anna come up and speak<br>please<br>thank you very much hopefully everyone<br>can hear me all right right so<br>menopause so where do we start I think<br>maybe starting with some of the myths<br>that I hear on a very regular basis in<br>my uh clinical practice um one of the<br>most common ones I think which which<br>highlights the the misinformation that's<br>often around in the community it really<br>reflects the the group of young women<br>that we see the sort of 4% of women who<br>reach menopause Before 40 they often<br>have years of going to various medical<br>practitioners trying to get a diagnosis<br>made uh only to be told that they are<br>too young now my youngest patient<br>hitting menopause was 15 so it can<br>happen at any age and I think you know<br>it's devastating for these young women<br>not to get the care that they need early<br>on uh often we hear the story that Asian<br>women just Breeze through menopause<br>without a care in the world uh this is a<br>cultural reporting thing uh so women of<br>uh Asian ethnicity tend to be a little<br>bit more withdrawn about talking freely<br>about menopause but if you ask them<br>exactly the same proportion as amongst<br>Caucasian women uh will have<br>symptoms uh often women will present to<br>the the primary care practitioner with<br>symptoms that are very consistent with<br>menopause a blood test might be taken<br>the blood test is normal they're told it<br>can't be menopause<br>and we know that's not true because the<br>hormones around the leadup to menopause<br>are highly variable they'll fluctuate<br>almost every 20 minutes day and night so<br>what you're getting with a blood test is<br>a snapshot of that precise moment in<br>time and it doesn't really reflect<br>what's going on uh with a woman's<br>quality of life so the diagnosis of<br>menopause is very much one made on the<br>basis of talking to the patient<br>listening to what she's telling you and<br>not so much uh on the basis of blood<br>tests<br>we still hear uh the comment that<br>hormone therapy is dangerous very much<br>as a result of the research that laury<br>has alluded to uh comments that it<br>increases the risk of heart attacks<br>strokes and Cancers and we'll have a<br>little bit of a chat about that uh you<br>still hear uh this concept that if women<br>are going to take the risk and use<br>hormone therapy it should be used in the<br>lowest possible dose for the shortest<br>period of time and that's a a policy<br>that was never based on science but it's<br>become incredibly ingrained uh in<br>practice around the world and that's<br>despite every single guideline over the<br>last eight years saying that's not how<br>doctors should be<br>practicing and I think because of the<br>enormous Opti recently in the interest<br>in menopause uh we're seeing a bit of<br>backlash starting to happen and there<br>have been a number of Articles uh<br>particularly in uh the British medical<br>journal in recent times that have<br>suggested that we're beginning to over<br>medicalize what is just a normal part of<br>a woman's life and should she know she<br>should potentially be left to it to<br>manage it the best way she can I would<br>hope we've moved Beyond those days but<br>um I think it'll be interesting to see<br>how it<br>evolves so why do we worry about<br>menopausal symptoms well I think it's<br>now very clear uh that they have a<br>significant impact on the quality of<br>life um of some women at menopause uh<br>and also a verifiable economic impact on<br>the workplace so there's a lot of res<br>search going on in that workplace kind<br>of<br>Arena we also know that the women who<br>are having frequent and severe flushing<br>and sweating episodes particularly if<br>they're night sweats where they're<br>waking up drenched in sweats these<br>events actually leave permanent scars on<br>the brain that you can actually see on<br>an MRI scan so they're sharp as little<br>white dots uh and the more of these<br>little white dots you have uh on a scan<br>the higher the likelihood uh that that<br>person will go on to develop Dementia or<br>have a stroke so we're beginning to<br>understand that these kind of severe<br>flushes are not benign events uh and<br>they need to be taken really seriously<br>because of this potential impact down<br>the<br>track I think there's also a bit of a<br>concept that menopause is a short-lived<br>phenomenon I think we all kind of hope<br>that's the case our partners certainly<br>hope it's the case uh but the reality is<br>that you know there's this Preamble of<br>per menopause which is very much you<br>know the ugly sister of menopause itself<br>self uh and symptoms can occur for a<br>good 5 to 10 years over that period of<br>time leading up to period stopping and<br>then on average there may be another 8<br>to 10 years from the point the periods<br>have ceased of of a symptomatic time we<br>know that about a quarter of women will<br>have a pretty awful time going through<br>menopause they're the ones we tend to<br>see um and try and help as best we can<br>to move through that phase uh and we<br>know that maybe up to third of us so<br>it's more than we used to think uh will<br>actually have symptoms Way Beyond that<br>initial 10 years after periods have<br>stopped so it's not a short process um<br>and it is something that for a many<br>women does need to be managed<br>carefully so the symptoms on this slide<br>are the ones that we can absolutely<br>verify uh are related to menopause<br>because they classically will go away uh<br>with the use of hormone therapy so the<br>temperature balance issues are probably<br>the most well-known known of the the<br>symptoms that women uh experience at<br>menopause and this can be the the<br>classical hot flushes or the night<br>sweats but the the fmost stat can swing<br>in the other direction as well so we see<br>women who become you know much colder<br>than normal and you know have the<br>reverse effect of of the hot<br>flushes the sleep disturbance uh can be<br>related to waking up hot it can be<br>related to waking up feeling wired and<br>panicky because of the surge in<br>Adrenaline that precedes some of these<br>hot events<br>but it can be risk waking up for no good<br>reason usually in the early hours of the<br>morning which is one of the most<br>critical phases of our sleep cycle which<br>is why we end up feeling tired slightly<br>brain dead the next<br>day um and then of course there are all<br>of the genital and urinary issues which<br>we don't tend I think as women to kind<br>of cough up uh at the first consultation<br>with our um our doctor uh the vaginal<br>dryness uh becomes an increasing issue<br>with time um we have recurrent bladder<br>infections becoming a bit more of an<br>issue and women often talk about again<br>not readily but if you ask about changes<br>in sexual function and if they come with<br>their partner that may be one of the<br>things that the partner brings up uh<br>very early<br>on um we also see the sort of widespread<br>uh small joint particularly hands and<br>feet aches muscle aches ligament aches<br>often very poorly linked to to menopause<br>it's often after the event when<br>someone's been started on treatment The<br>Joint AES go away and suddenly you know<br>there's a realization that this has been<br>part of the whole menopause package uh<br>these joint and muscle AES are just as<br>common as the flushing and sweating and<br>probably more common amongst the Asian<br>women and then we have the mood<br>disturbance and and Kate May address<br>this in a bit more detail but this often<br>precedes period stopping and it can<br>occur in women who have never before had<br>any issues with their mental health it<br>may range from mild changes in mood um<br>to quite significant anxiety and panic<br>attacks anger uh<br>irritability um so that can have a bit<br>of an impact um obviously on their<br>relationship so those are the symptoms<br>that we're we're pretty happy are linked<br>to The Disappearance of of estrogen our<br>main female hormone at menopause and<br>then there are these ones which are the<br>ones particularly the first one on the<br>list that drive every woman I see<br>completely batty um almost all of us<br>gain weight and change shape at<br>menopause and turn from pears into<br>apples uh that weight will stick Like<br>Glue and even amongst the most virtuous<br>of women who have perfect diets regular<br>exercise programs uh you know it just<br>does not easily shift it does ultimately<br>all sort itself out uh but it would be<br>the one lingering issue that I think I<br>say to woman I would get a Nobel Peace<br>Prize if I could solve this uh so it is<br>a tricky one so so any consultation has<br>to be kind of prefaced with you know<br>this is this is tricky and then you know<br>the the memory the the cognitive fog the<br>forgetting names even of your best<br>friend uh the word memory issues very<br>specific to menopause uh we don't know<br>what drives those and they variably<br>respond uh to estrogen therapy so<br>there's something else going on there<br>too so if we come to to think about<br>hormone therapy for women um I guess<br>really we're focusing on the women that<br>have got the you know the moderate to<br>severe symptoms that are really having<br>an impact on their quality of life and<br>if we wanted to summarize what the risks<br>and the benefits of hormone therapy are<br>I could stand and talk for an hour or<br>two about that but this is a a brief<br>summary of where we're at with the<br>current uh literature so the benefits of<br>pretty much any kind of hormone therapy<br>include that women feel better<br>and I think it's the one thing I<br>prescribed that women use that phrase<br>that Laur used lifechanging once you've<br>got it right it can return their quality<br>of life uh very much uh to<br>normal we know from all the very large<br>studies that have been done and some of<br>them are ongoing um some of them are<br>really large following you know 26,000<br>women now for 26 years uh they tell us<br>that the risk of colon cancer is reduced<br>by about 30% uh if you're taking hormone<br>therapy uh that the risk of fracture<br>which is obviously an increasingly<br>common problem as we all get older<br>that's hared the risk of heart disease<br>is hared by hormone<br>therapy uh the risk of death from what<br>they call all causes which is really<br>deaths from other forms of cancer or<br>dementia is reduced by about<br>30% and contrary to I guess the popular<br>concern amongst women that all forms of<br>hormone therapy in increase the risk of<br>breast cancer we know that in the group<br>of women who are just taking estrogen at<br>menopause this is the group of women who<br>have had a hysterctomy they have no need<br>for progesterone to control bleeding so<br>estrogen's used by itself that actually<br>halves the death rate from breast cancer<br>so rather than an increase it's a<br>decrease so when we come to use hormone<br>therapy in the normal way where we add<br>some progesterone to the estrogen to<br>control bleeding in a woman who's still<br>got her uterus that benefit in terms of<br>breast cancer disappears so it becomes<br>neutral if the doctor makes a good<br>choice in the kind of progesterone they<br>prescribe it may ultimately increase if<br>they make the wrong choice and that's<br>how we've got some of the more natural<br>forms of progesterone funded by pharmac<br>in the last couple of years by<br>convincing them that they're safer that<br>they would save money down the track uh<br>in having to deal with adverse outcomes<br>from the wrong progesterone<br>so I think you know certainly<br>prescribing has shifted very much<br>towards the sort of more natural kind of<br>therapies and then the stroke and<br>clotting risks are really only seen if<br>hormone therapy is started after the age<br>of 60 and oral so tablet estrogen is<br>used so we can get around a lot of those<br>risks by using patch or gel estrogen and<br>skin so what about testosterone this has<br>become quite a popular issue I think<br>there's a lot of social media um blogs<br>Vlogs uh advice that testosterone is you<br>know the essence The Elixir that we<br>should all be on uh there are several<br>issues here uh firstly is that the only<br>reason that we should be prescribing<br>testosterone is to help women with<br>sexual function there is no other clear<br>indication for its use there is no data<br>out there from good research studies<br>showing any benefit in any other area<br>for the normal you know woman reaching<br>51 I think all the guidelines are<br>certainly very clear about that uh the<br>problem we have in most parts of the<br>world and most particularly here in New<br>Zealand is that we have just one form of<br>testosterone it comes in a cream uh in a<br>tube that lasts 3 months uh it costs<br>about $150 if you've got a kind<br>pharmacist uh so it's not particularly<br>cheap I don't think there's any plan on<br>behalf of pharmac to fund that for women<br>uh there's been a lot of confusion<br>recently with a male testosterone gel<br>that's come out and I've had a lot of my<br>colleagues who have started to prescribe<br>that for women but the dose is way too<br>high so um testogel is not appropriate<br>for women and it does have to be very<br>carefully monitored you want to make<br>sure if we're prescribing testosterone<br>we've got the levels sitting in the<br>middle of the normal range for a woman<br>and not outside that uh in the hope that<br>we're going to avoid side effects uh and<br>the other thing is we've got virtually<br>no long-term safety data with it so we<br>don't know uh what it does to the risk<br>of heart disease or breast cancer down<br>the<br>track and this is just a quick slide<br>showing you in the dark bars which are<br>the women on testosterone compared to<br>the ones in the light bars um this is<br>looking at all aspects of desire and<br>arousal so if we are using it for sexual<br>function you can clearly see that it<br>does have some benefit<br>now I just wanted to touch briefly on<br>the crisis that I'm sure most of you are<br>aware of if you've gone anywhere near<br>patches uh it hit absolute Rock Bottom<br>point two weeks ago where no Pharmacy in<br>New Zealand had any Patches at all uh<br>pharmac talisis is a global issue seems<br>to just affect New Zealand um so we are<br>hoping that they will get A Rush of<br>Blood to their brain in the very near<br>future and fund a gel uh as an<br>alternative they tell us they will we<br>are optimistic watch the space and then<br>just lastly I think it's really<br>important for the group of women that we<br>see where hormone therapy is not an<br>option there will be contraindications<br>such as previous breast cancer where it<br>is just not such a good idea uh and it's<br>important for them to be aware and for<br>their doctors to be aware that there are<br>lots of other options to manage their<br>symptoms whether it be you know the<br>compliment therapies and particularly<br>hypnosis which is incredibly effective<br>um some of the drugs that are used for<br>all sorts of other purposes in medicine<br>but can be repurposed uh for use at<br>menopause and are very helpful and then<br>in Christ Church we're lucky that we<br>have access to a nerve block that also<br>stops flushing and sweating or at least<br>attenuates them fairly<br>significantly so lots of good options<br>and then just a quick uh you know plug<br>for some good uh educational resources<br>for you um the ostr Asian menopause<br>Society website menopause matters really<br>excellent valid accurate evidence-based<br>information and Nikki's bazan's book is<br>awesome if you want the authoritative<br>guide written by New Zealand journalist<br>uh to uh menopause at its management<br>that is the book for you thank you thank<br>you<br>Anna I feel bad you know I said you know<br>12 minutes to each speaker and um gosh<br>we could hear hours and hours more on<br>just menopause alone from Anna and I<br>it's going to be uh you know the same<br>with all the speakers tonight I'm sure<br>thank you so much it was really<br>interesting Dr bran Sinco now Brian is<br>um a gynecological oncologist highly<br>respected and an expert in the treatment<br>of all gynecological Cancers and<br>pre-cancers and she's also a highly<br>experienced colposcopist she gained her<br>medical degree from the University of<br>London and completed her basic training<br>in OBS and gy both in the UK and New<br>Zealand she moved to Melbourne to work<br>at the famed Peter mum cancer center<br>before returning to Cambridge in the UK<br>to complete her subspecialist training<br>in gy oncology she's worked as a<br>consultant gy oncologist clinical<br>researcher and Senior lecturer here on<br>campus since 2008 and I know from<br>talking to her she's got a passion uh a<br>passionate interest for screening and<br>women's Cancers and has a special<br>interest in complex cases and is heavily<br>involved too in research projects here<br>on campus involving women here in<br>Canterbury uh who were going through<br>gynecological Cancers and pre cancers<br>she was a founding member of the Gracie<br>Foundation now Gracie stands for the<br>gynecological cancer research and<br>clinical Innovation it's a charitable<br>trust formed in 2010 by a small group of<br>professionals with a particular interest<br>in gy cancers its aim is to improve<br>outcomes for women living with<br>gynecological cancer in New Zealand by<br>uh supporting New Zealand based Research<br>and the team for organizing this um such<br>an important um such an important thing<br>to do uh as as a doctor in women's<br>health I umum yeah just really grateful<br>to have the time to talk about this and<br>I'll be really grateful that my slides<br>then come up no let's try that one<br>hey that's good isn't it coio who am I<br>so you've heard a little bit about who I<br>am I trained as an obstetrician<br>gynecologist and then I worked in gy<br>oncology looking after um women with<br>gynecological Cancers here in<br>Alura and uh I uh the privilege of of<br>being able to be part of the care of of<br>women with gynecological Cancers and<br>work in a team some of whom are here<br>tonight namu Koto<br>um yeah I I am a very lucky person so gy<br>oncologist as you've heard looks after<br>women with a range of gynecological<br>cancers<br>um we don't hear much about gy cancers<br>do we and um when I go out to dinner<br>which I have to say I don't actually<br>often have much of a social life but you<br>know I go out and people say what do you<br>do and I say I'm a gynecologist and<br>people go and then you say you're a gy<br>oncologist and that's it you kind of put<br>in the corner of the room because I<br>might talk about periods bleeding and<br>Cancers but um yeah right so but you<br>know information's everything and I'm so<br>grateful that we live in a time where<br>we're talking about menopause and we can<br>talk about prolapse and and mental<br>health issues and we can talk about gyne<br>cancers we can talk about cancers of the<br>ovary tube uterus cervix vulva I look<br>after patients with vulva cancer who<br>have never ever told their best friend<br>that they have go vva cancer because<br>they're embarrassed it's not right you<br>can even get tumors in your placenta did<br>you<br>know so I'm hoping so it took me three<br>years to train to be G oncologist and<br>honestly I am still learning there is<br>still so much to do and I have to uh<br>talk to you about three years worth of<br>learning in uh about 10 and a half<br>minutes so I hope you're on for a no<br>it's okay I want you just to understand<br>a little bit about gy Cancers and if my<br>only success from this the only thing<br>you remember is that there are things<br>and it's okay to talk about them with<br>your friends Kitty pie well done that<br>that's that's a massive start HPV is<br>something that I'm super super<br>passionate about and I'll talk a little<br>bit about that and as you've<br>heard research research is Hope research<br>is understanding research is progress<br>for all of us and um as I'm getting<br>older I'm getting like more and more<br>desperate in my research because I might<br>need the benefits of this sooner and<br>sooner I'm like oh my God bring it on so<br>so a little bit about that tonight<br>too um I'm a surgeon so I'm a really<br>visual kind of person so I thought you<br>might like to see a bit of what I do and<br>we're hearing about ovaries won't<br>surprise you to know that our ovaries<br>are absolutely amazing because women are<br>amazing and we all know this and there's<br>all sorts of different cells in our<br>ovaries of course because the germ cells<br>can go on and produce um if they match<br>up with a sperm it's kind of an<br>irrelevance really isn't it that you can<br>um you can produce babies but benign<br>ovarian tumors<br>here's everybody's favorite if you're a<br>gynecologist we all love dermoids and<br>you can see honestly you get teeth in<br>your ovary Thal and hair and fat and all<br>sorts of other things so banina ovarian<br>tumors are a<br>thing I know right seriously that's a<br>washing up bowl and our ovaries are<br>supposed to be smaller than an egg and<br>actually this one wasn't even malignant<br>it's a benign one but it weighs about<br>five kilos and that's when I mve from<br>gynecologist into bariatric surgeon in<br>one quick you know move changing your<br>waistline and um and that that lady's<br>ovary is actually benign she was<br>absolutely fine and there were no<br>further<br>problems but what we're learning a<br>little bit more about ovarian cancer is<br>that a lot of ovarian cancer um evolves<br>from the Fallopian tubes ovarian<br>Cancer's got a bad wrap justifiably<br>because Advanced ovarian cancer well<br>ovarian cancer often presents in older<br>women once it's<br>spread and it's very difficult to treat<br>and and here we are involved in research<br>looking at lowgrade serious ovarian<br>cancer some other working at highgrade<br>serious ovarian cancer and we think<br>about 50% of these cancers We Now<br>understand through research not done<br>here um start off in the Fallopian tubes<br>and so for the last 10 years I've been<br>talking to people saying if you're going<br>to have a<br>hysterectomy take the tubes out if you<br>want the S if you want to um have a<br>surgical um contraception have those<br>tubes take out I hate Fallopian tubes<br>everyone's Fallopian tubes should be<br>removed and seriously last week in<br>clinic my colleague and I were<br>discussing that you know like if I if I<br>have a broken foot could somebody just<br>nip in and take my tubes at the same<br>time because that would be great just<br>say anyway so that's something that<br>we're working on and thinking about a<br>bit more at the<br>moment we're all understand about<br>screening programs here right we<br>understand screening because you walk<br>through airports and they're screening<br>for bombs and you can have breast<br>screening and we screen newborns for<br>hearing problems but you cannot screen<br>for ovarian cancer and that's one of the<br>problems that we are trying to work out<br>what can we do how can we prevent<br>cancers affecting over 300 um New<br>Zealand women a<br>year but a success story in screening is<br>HPV and gy Cancers now I can't quite<br>remember yes my lovely colleague and<br>friend Pete sites came out with this<br>amazing line which is<br>HPV and the human race is infested with<br>wart virus and it's such a like but it's<br>so true human race relies on procreation<br>if you procreate 85 more percent of us<br>are going to get one of the viruses<br>they're common they're everywhere when I<br>teach the students I've worked out a<br>cure for this and it solves global<br>warming no more<br>sex and and the students who are kind of<br>eight well how old are they 21 22 they<br>look older older people go oh yeah no<br>it's an<br>option anyway just saying uh anyway so<br>HPV is the cause and we can prevent it<br>we can prevent the HPV high-risk types<br>sitting sitting inside us and going on<br>to cause cervix Cancers and vva Cancers<br>vaccination vaccination vaccination<br>vaccination it's free it's for boys and<br>girls my poor kids rolled up to the GP<br>and in fact one of them I can't remember<br>which of the three it was took herself<br>along to the GP and GP said oh your Bry<br>thought it yeah you want it you'll be<br>wanting the vaccine won't you I'm like<br>yeah okay all our children boys and<br>girls kep them vaccinated before they've<br>got around to having intercourse and you<br>no-brainer worldwide New Zealand only<br>sees a small number of cervix cancers<br>really the massive burden of diseases<br>across the world in the Pacific Islands<br>in Fiji in<br>Africa in New Zealand the numbers we get<br>and actually our numbers are right down<br>here at the bottom you can see us down<br>there and you might think oh well<br>sweet not<br>so just last week in our meeting we we<br>um met a we heard about a lady who's got<br>Advanced cervix cancer she's had four<br>babies and nobody nobody nobody has ever<br>said to her have you had a<br>smear no<br>this is a scan this lady has or had a<br>cervix cancer over there and the other<br>thing you can see in that picture is her<br>baby's head because she was diagnosed<br>with cervix cancer when she was<br>pregnant nobody thought to ask her about<br>her screening<br>history she wants me to show you this<br>slide she's five years out she's well<br>her baby's now five but no woman should<br>have to go through that it's preventable<br>we now can self test<br>with an HPV swap you don't have to have<br>some doctor sticking a thingy up your<br>whats it and it's awful right anyway<br>women I think have been involved in the<br>screening program hooray I think every<br>office should just have a jar of these<br>swabs and I'm seriously thinking about<br>telling the orthopedic surgeons to have<br>them on the front desk why wouldn't you<br>you can just get it done sorted done<br>safe much better than a standard squir<br>squir anyway just saying so if you get<br>offered or you've got the chance join<br>the self swab program talk about it<br>share it it's saving<br>lives we can prevent and eliminate<br>cervice cancer and<br>finally little whistle top tour<br>endometrial cancer cancer of the uterus<br>how long have I<br>got a minute or so few years ago I<br>looked after I met a lady she was 54 she<br>had a BMI of 54 her husband works for<br>cocacola and she used to get $150 worth<br>of free Coca-Cola every month we know<br>that endometrial cancer is associated<br>with obesity we know that and we I found<br>out on my we mission that we have the<br>fastest rate of increase of endometrial<br>cancer in the world in our young women<br>and no one's talking about it and I am<br>mad about that I'm mad that it's so and<br>I'm mad that no one's talking about it<br>and I'm mad that it's not in the papers<br>and I'm out there talking about it now<br>highest rate this many women three years<br>ago that's what it looks<br>like why is it choice I don't think so<br>it's advertising and beautiful<br>researchers in atago they put cameras on<br>our kids heads and they found that these<br>fast food companies $550 million of<br>advertising in fast food in Australia<br>last year they deliberately Target our<br>kids our Mari our Pacific our low<br>socioeconomic class nearly two times<br>more likely to get one of those seven 70<br>fast foods exposures to advertising if<br>you come from one of those<br>demographics New York Times month ago<br>slave labor in India to create to to<br>harvest sugar for Pepsi and cocacola<br>these guys know it they know they're<br>using kids the women who they they like<br>couples to harvest the sugar cane so<br>they get married couples women and men<br>and they don't like women having periods<br>because it takes them off the fields and<br>they don't want them to have babies<br>because it takes them off say one in<br>three women in India get a hysterectomy<br>gives us sugar my women get<br>postmenopausal bleeding heavy bleeding<br>get a hysterctomy rubbish rubbish just<br>quickly gy cancers don't hear much about<br>them hard to get money for research<br>thank you for talking about Gracie it's<br>an important thing research is progress<br>and I used to um as you said I used to<br>work in Cambridge in the<br>UK and um this was my bike path anyone<br>that knows me knows I bike everywhere<br>yeah in these I just Tu my trousers into<br>my socks it works great um I used to<br>bike along this in this path those bars<br>started appearing on my bike path and<br>they are actually the gene for the<br>bracka gene which is one of the genes<br>that leads to breast and ovarian cancer<br>and it made me realize that research is<br>part of my life so I just want to uh<br>finish by saying knowledge is a gift we<br>should use it well research is<br>fundamental to progress for all of us<br>whatever our age is and I really would<br>like to Mii acknowledge the amazing wah<br>that I have the absolute privilege of<br>it's all wonderful stuff isn't it<br>fabulous thanks so much Bry um Dr Kate<br>iglon she's a consultant Leos and<br>psychiatrist here in Christ Church a<br>senior lecturer in our department of<br>psychological medicine as well as a<br>passionate researcher she sees many<br>women as patients uh at Christ Church<br>Women's Hospital she gained her medical<br>degree at otago University and completed<br>her clinical years up here in Christ<br>Church followed by a six-month stint as<br>a visiting researcher at King's College<br>in London before returning home to<br>continue her training in research in<br>2019 Kate's involved in research<br>projects examining the longer term<br>outcome of mood disorders and<br>interventions to increase the likelihood<br>of response and remission her research<br>interests include cognitive and<br>functional recovery of and mood<br>disorders she's currently um busy<br>developing a study with the campus's<br>respected Christ Church health and<br>development study looking at Women's<br>midlife Health with a focus on mental<br>health and cognitive issues um the one<br>that um Anna mentioned before so that's<br>Kate Koto K noo thanks for the lovely<br>introduction and the really interesting<br>talks so far bit intimidating coming<br>after these guys but we'll see how I go<br>um so I'm a psychiatrist I'm going to be<br>talking about mental health and as Anna<br>indicated the main um symptom that we're<br>interested in in terms of Health through<br>menopause is mood problems so depression<br>um so that's really what I'm going to be<br>talking mainly about today but I'm going<br>to start with this does anyone know why<br>I've got um this random slide with<br>Marine uh animals on<br>it I did want to be a um marine<br>biologist at high school and then I<br>defected and did Psychiatry um and I've<br>been looking for an excuse to have a<br>slide with some marine life on it so<br>this is my chance um so out of over<br>5,000 mammal species only six go through<br>menopause and it's these<br>six kowell false kowell n Beluga shorten<br>pilot and us so we're pretty rare um<br>actually in terms of mammal species and<br>the theory is that we evolved under<br>similar social pressures to these five<br>species of whales so complex<br>intergenerational family systems uh<br>where there are grandparents kids uh and<br>grandkids all living together and<br>helping each other out most um mamal<br>species just die when they stop<br>reproducing and as someone who's in my<br>second pregnancy about halfway through I<br>can kind of identify with that um but we<br>just keep going um as humans so that's<br>just my um little bit the other bit that<br>I wanted to bring in is some historical<br>um basis for the link between menopause<br>and psychological symptoms so this goes<br>back to about 1820 I think in this<br>french guy I'm struggling with my<br>pronunciation here but Sher L de it's<br>all right um so he talked about um<br>menopause being related to hysteria or<br>nervous affectation of the uterus um and<br>so hysteria was the idea we've moved on<br>from it now but that your uterus moved<br>around the body and that's what caused<br>women to go crazy essentially um and<br>it's a you know like I said we've moved<br>on it's a while since I did om mid<br>school but I think Brian would attested<br>the uterus staying most of the<br>time in the right place um then in the<br>1950s these three American guys um<br>published in Jama which is one of our<br>really emminent medical journals and<br>they said that menopause was rather<br>unpleasant and possibly<br>dangerous um so quite extreme and that's<br>they were the first people to develop a<br>rating scale for menopause symptoms so<br>that's really where the Links come from<br>but what do we know um about the links<br>between menopause and mental health now<br>we've got some big longitudinal studies<br>worldwide that show some quite worrying<br>figures that your risk of depression and<br>menopause or depression symptoms might<br>be two to four times um that at other<br>times in your life and between 45 to<br>70ish per of women might have um<br>depression symptoms in per menopause<br>really important to remember though that<br>this is based on depression rating<br>scales in a lot of depression symptoms<br>similar to menopause symptoms so you get<br>sleep disturbance you get changes in<br>your weight you get loss of libido so<br>already you're ticking quite a few boxes<br>on a depression scale and our evidence<br>about actual depression diagnosis across<br>menopause is much more limited and Anna<br>and I are hoping that we're going to be<br>able to look at that um in a study<br>coming up if you're thinking about who<br>might be more at risk of developing<br>depression or symptoms of depression<br>during menopause these are the main risk<br>factors and they kind of make sense so<br>people having a lot the hot flushes<br>people having significant sleep<br>disturbance lots of stress in your life<br>and a longer time to go through<br>menopause the other important um thing<br>to think about is a little bit oh yeah<br>here we go um is background history of<br>depression so the blue lines here<br>indicate people with a previous history<br>of depression and the red lines are<br>women without a history of depression<br>and you can see on the depression rating<br>scale here on the left um people with<br>the history of depression have much<br>higher depression symptoms through<br>menopause so if you are someone with a<br>background of depression that can be<br>more of a risk period um but you also<br>May develop kind of lower grade symptoms<br>if you haven't got that<br>background um there's<br>also uh some evidence to show that<br>people who are depressed through<br>menopause might look a bit different or<br>have slightly different symptoms to<br>people presenting other um times of life<br>so um mood o fluctuations might be more<br>on off rather than in um earlier kind of<br>earlier reproductive age depression<br>where you have persistent low mood and<br>that's in line with those big<br>fluctuations and hormones that Anna was<br>talking about uh extremely poor sleep<br>obviously more common particularly if<br>you're having hot flushes and night<br>sweats weight gain an is mentioned as<br>well cognitive problems and then<br>aggression and rage which um you know<br>could happen at any time but apparently<br>can happen a bit more during<br>unor<br>um this is just to show how wildly the<br>hormones fluctuate around um during<br>period menopause and so Anna talked<br>about this being the lead up of maybe<br>five or so years before your periods<br>actually finally stop and that's when<br>you can get those big onoff mood<br>fluctuations associated with that and<br>you might feel like one of these orchids<br>going through some very rough Seas um<br>evidence shows that the depression rate<br>goes back to the kind of Baseline rate<br>after your hormones stop fluctuating<br>around so wildly so that can kind of be<br>helpful to<br>know um Laura Le mentioned some of these<br>things so this is a lady rushing around<br>a lot I feel a bit like this sometimes<br>um but midlife is a really busy time<br>women are often looking after kids and<br>going really well in careers looking<br>after you know homes trying to fit in<br>Hobbies trying to fit in self-care<br>there's a lot of stuff to um fit in and<br>this is the idea of kind of rushing<br>woman's syndrome rushing around and not<br>really getting a chance to relax or um<br>yeah have some time you can see she<br>doesn't even have time to put her shoes<br>on so it's pretty serious and then this<br>here is the sandwich generation which<br>Laura Li also mentioned so this is the<br>idea that um as women probably having<br>kids later um they still have dependent<br>children at home as well as possibly<br>looking after older um parents who might<br>be um developing Dementia or needing<br>other support so they're sandwiched<br>between these two slices of bread that<br>they're trying to um trying to look<br>after which can be really<br>stressful um this next slide's just to<br>show the interaction between those two<br>things so the hormonal biological basis<br>for mood problems and then the kind of<br>Psychosocial stresses that could<br>contribute um and I think this is like a<br>really good study which is hard to<br>explain but I wanted to put it up<br>because I love it so much so if you look<br>here um this column is very stressful<br>life events at Baseline not many of<br>those women in this Comm column had lots<br>of stressful life events at<br>Baseline and gry line is high<br>variability in estrogen so those big<br>fluctuations in hormones whereas the<br>dotted line women weren't having many<br>fluctuations you can see here it's only<br>women who had both very stressful events<br>at Baseline and um High variability in<br>estrogen that had more depression so<br>it's just showing that interaction<br>between those things it's really<br>important so if you're thinking this<br>sounds like me or someone I don't know<br>what can be done about it luckily<br>there's lots of things that can help um<br>so if you've got kind of milder symptoms<br>well any symptoms but uh lifestyle<br>factors are really important and Brian<br>he talked about diet this is really<br>important as well in terms of mental<br>well-being um exercise Trying to<br>minimize alcohol minimize smoking<br>and that actually reduces hot flushes as<br>well there's a strong L between smoking<br>and having more hot flushes so there's<br>kind of double bang for your buck um so<br>those things are really important trying<br>to enhance some support so can you stop<br>rushing around and get out of that<br>sandwich is there anyone that can help<br>you to do that it might be other family<br>or friends that could be supportive and<br>um give you some assistance or it could<br>be a professional potentially<br>particularly if you have more<br>significant symptoms and then it's kind<br>of similar stuff to usual for depression<br>if you are having um more serious<br>symptoms so you might need psychological<br>input which would be like talking to a<br>counselor or a um psychologist you might<br>need to think about medications if your<br>symptoms are more severe and I think if<br>there's any hint that this is a per<br>menopause or depression so you have<br>other symptoms of menopause like hot<br>flushes or joint pains or that kind of<br>thing that Anna talked about before um<br>triing hormone therapy would be a good<br>first line before jumping into an<br>anti-depressant but there is evidence<br>for anti-depressants being helpful um in<br>terms of managing depression through<br>menopause as well and in terms of who<br>you would see GP would be a good first<br>line person um to link in with and see<br>what would be helpful you might want to<br>see someone like Anna the local expert<br>um and if things were really serious you<br>know you might need to be linked in with<br>the local Mental Health Services or see<br>a psychiatrist potentially or a<br>psychologist<br>much good to know I'm not going mad<br>isn't it um that's great thank you so<br>much Kate and now finally um Dr Giovani<br>Loco now Giovani is a general urologist<br>and a Urological surgeon originally from<br>Christ Church Giovani gained his medical<br>degree um as cake did at otaro in 2005<br>and after completing his clinical and<br>postgrad years he he headed off to the<br>UK to S to subspecialize in um Urology<br>he completed Fellowship training in<br>Pediatric Urology at Birmingham<br>Children's Hospital and gained extensive<br>experience in reconstructive Urology<br>female Urology pelvic organ prolapse uh<br>urethroplasty and Urological care of<br>spinal injuries while working at various<br>hospitals in London and prior to that he<br>worked in Sydney where he focused on<br>blader dysfunction with a particular<br>interest in male and female incontinence<br>now he a clinical senior lecturer um<br>here on campus and among his many<br>leadership positions Giovani is<br>currently the Clinical Director of<br>Urology at Tata Ora Canterbury white<br>Taha um as well as a clinical lead<br>urology at Tata Ora South Canterbury<br>he's chair of the New Zealand Urology<br>Clinical Director group he's a director<br>of Urology Associates here in Christ<br>Church a trustee of the Canterbury<br>Urology research trust as the national<br>co-lead at the New Zealand female pelvic<br>mesh service and he works too um with a<br>number of C and health Ministry<br>committees on reducing surgical mesh<br>harm um Giovani<br>welcome uh thank you very much Laura Le<br>for the warm welcome great to see such a<br>wonderful turnout and also particularly<br>to see a few blos in the audience too I<br>was quite concerned I would be the only<br>one so<br>uh yeah yeah so I'm going to give you a<br>bit of a little Whistle Stop tour<br>tonight of a few key Urological issues<br>that affect women um really at all<br>stages in life to be honest but<br>particularly in the per menopause and<br>postmenopause time so incontinence as<br>well as female pelvic organ prolapse a<br>little bit about the bladder the bladder<br>is a little ball of muscle a hollow<br>muscle obviously because it stores urine<br>but is effectively a muscle and it has<br>two jobs its first job is to store urine<br>so when you don't want to go to the<br>toilet like all of you sitting here<br>tonight it just quietly stores urine and<br>then when you're ready to go to the<br>toilet its job is to empty so it has to<br>fill and it has to empty and it has to<br>do that at a socially appropriate<br>time two things can therefore go wrong<br>it cannot be very good at storing which<br>means you leak and that's incontinence<br>or it can store so well that you can't<br>pee and that's a problem that actually<br>men have very frequently and is much<br>less common in women because men have<br>prostates so that's one good thing about<br>not being a bloke but from what I've<br>learned tonight there's quite a few<br>tricky things about being a woman um so<br>in terms of urinary incontinence that<br>falls into two groups so either your<br>your bladder which is that muscle isn't<br>very good at relaxing and storing urine<br>it's squeezing away like this all the<br>time and that's what we call Urge and<br>contance so you have to go urgently to<br>the toilet or overactive bladder the<br>other potential problem is your<br>sphincter muscle which is a thing that<br>you squeeze when we talk about pelvic FL<br>muscles we'll talk about that later um<br>isn't very good isn't very tight in fact<br>it's a little bit loose and so you Leak<br>with things like coughing and sneezing<br>and jumping that's what we call stress<br>incontinence so there are the two<br>specific issues and you can have a bit<br>of both um and if you have a bit of both<br>you may need both things to be<br>treated firstly though overactive<br>bladder so that's the urg incontinence<br>and the symptoms that we talk about at<br>urgency rushing to the toilet frequency<br>going often to the toilet urgent<br>continents which is not making it in<br>time so typically we talk about keying<br>the door when you're going home you open<br>the front door or maybe you know these<br>days pushing the button to uh open your<br>automatic garage door as you're driving<br>up the driveway you just got to go to<br>the lose straightway for some reason<br>every time when you just arrive home you<br>just have to go to the toilet so that's<br>your bladder Playing Tricks on you and<br>doing these extra squeezes um and not<br>which is getting up at night to go to<br>the toilet so the symptoms that people<br>describe in terms of treatment like most<br>things there are some lifestyle sort of<br>changes that can be made then there's<br>often medications or tablets and then<br>potentially surgery so people that are<br>prone to an overactive bladder some<br>foods and drinks tend to be particularly<br>irritating and caffinated drinks like<br>tea and coffee are particularly bad at<br>that um and it's really interesting<br>seeing people uh that you know do have a<br>problem with urgency and frequency and<br>we get them to do a thing called a<br>bladder diary where they measure<br>everything they drink into a jug and<br>they write it down then they pee into a<br>jug different jug uh and measure measure<br>the volumes of what they pee and you you<br>get an idea about how often they're<br>going to the toilet and how often<br>they're drinking and some people are<br>having 10 15 cups of coffee a day then<br>they're wondering why they're always<br>going to the toilet so there are some uh<br>you know relation ships between what we<br>drink and what we eat as well doesn't<br>always fix the problem though cutting<br>back on tea and coffee entirely there<br>are some medications tablets um like<br>oxybutinin and solenis and these work on<br>the chemicals in the bladder muscle<br>which are causing it to squeeze so they<br>they sort of deprive the blad of those<br>chemicals so it's not squeezing so much<br>and then then there's a thing called<br>Botox which many of you will have heard<br>of but probably not in terms of<br>injecting it into bladders so we can<br>actually inject Botox into the bladder<br>muscle does the same thing it does to<br>the facial muscles it makes it less<br>wrinkly um and that allows the bladder<br>to relax and store<br>urine there's also a little Nifty device<br>which is like a pacemaker for the<br>bladder um which is not done very<br>commonly because it's very expensive<br>unfortunately but it's a little device<br>that actually tells the bladder to<br>squeeze less um so it can be another way<br>of me of managing overactive<br>bladder so that's overactive bladder if<br>we move on to stress incontinence the<br>other cause of leakage in woman um<br>theang on uh stress incontinence is that<br>issue with the sphincter so that's the<br>muscle that sits below the bladder I'm<br>particularly prone uh to not being so<br>good after childbirth um after pregnancy<br>um so I mean after when I say after<br>pregnancy what I'm I guess meaning is<br>it's not just vaginal delivery that<br>actually um causes problems with the<br>sphincter so just being pregnant causes<br>issues with the sphincter um and uh you<br>know trauma and postmenopause as the<br>tissues become less estrogenized they're<br>less<br>strong there are no drugs really for<br>stress incontinence though however the<br>main stay of treatment is pelvic for<br>muscle exercises and the way that I<br>describe pelvic for muscle exercises to<br>people that mostly you can relate to if<br>you're in a public place like right here<br>and you think you're going to fart there<br>sort of muscle that you squeeze around<br>your back passage to just try and keep<br>the fat in so that's your pelvic for<br>muscle exercises and if you're doing it<br>really well just sitting there on the<br>seat no one should be able to tell that<br>you're doing a p mus exercise yes yes I<br>can see who's trying<br>um so uh P for muscle exercises actually<br>resolve stress and constant in about 80%<br>of women and for those that doesn't we<br>have that don't we have some options um<br>so bulking agents a little injection<br>into the sphincter just to make it a<br>little bit more closed a little bit more<br>tight um and that's delivered by a<br>special needle that goes through the<br>urethra you can be asleep when that<br>happens um under anesthetic just to try<br>and co-a the the urethra together a<br>little bit<br>more uh very common procedure done<br>around the world uh using mesh uh<br>creates a a sling like a hammock that<br>supports the urethra I'm not going to<br>really spend a lot of time on mesh<br>tonight because it's had a lot of air<br>time and it's had a lot of problems um<br>they're not entirely bad and it is an<br>operation which is still done around the<br>world currently not in New Zealand um<br>she'll get to an a tick uh but it<br>basically it sits under the urethra<br>which is the water pipe when you're<br>coughing and jumping and sneezing it<br>just stops the urine from leaking<br>out some things can go wrong like<br>infection of the mesh erosion of the<br>mesh pain from the mesh and for those<br>reasons um about a year ago August of<br>last year uh the director general of<br>Health said that we would not be using<br>mesh in New Zealand for the time being<br>it's called a pause until a number of<br>process have have been put into place to<br>make it safer and to give women<br>confidence that if you are having a mesh<br>operation it's going to be<br>okay um and in place of mesh um we have<br>uh what we call Natural tissue slings or<br>autologous slings so this is a surgical<br>photograph of an incision in the lower<br>part of the tummy taking a piece of the<br>fascia which is the tough tissue that<br>keeps our guts on the inside and forming<br>that into a sling uh that does exactly<br>what the mesh does only it doesn't<br>involve the use of mesh because we're<br>using our own<br>tissue and lots of things can be used<br>including skin or even tissue from the<br>leg which is the<br>fasel so that's a bit on incontinence<br>we're going to move on to prolapse um<br>the issue with pelvic organ prolapse is<br>it's primarily an issue with the support<br>of the pelvic floor and there's lots of<br>organs in the pelvic floor the bladder<br>at the front uh the uterus sort of in<br>the middle and at the top and then the<br>rectum at the back there's also some<br>small bow there and it's not the fault<br>of any of those particular organs that<br>they happen to be the one that's<br>prolapsing they were just in the wrong<br>place at the wrong time above a pelvic<br>floor which isn't strong enough to keep<br>them<br>inside another really interesting thing<br>about prolapse is they often ask women<br>about know do do you have a prolapse or<br>are you aware of a prolapse and most<br>people come back and say my nurse or my<br>doctor has told me I have a prolapse and<br>that doesn't matter if it's not causing<br>you symptoms prolapse is almost normal<br>uh to a degree a mild degree of pryse is<br>almost normal following child birth and<br>it doesn't need to be treated um if it's<br>symptomatic then absolutely things can<br>be done uh the main symptom is a bulge<br>so you feel a bulge or a lump actually<br>extruding externally from the vagina uh<br>there can be other things such as pain<br>pain with sexual intercourse difficulty<br>emptying the bladder difficulty emptying<br>the<br>bowel some occupations weren't really<br>designed to protect the pelvic floor so<br>um uh for most people we get through<br>life without putting our pelvic floor<br>under undue stress um but there are some<br>things that the human body just really<br>wasn't designed to do so even the best<br>operation for prolapse in the world<br>isn't going to prevent prolapse in every<br>possible<br>situation broadly speaking three<br>different things can prolapse one is the<br>blood<br>we call that a<br>Cil um uh and the second is the rectum<br>we call that a reail so that's a bulge<br>of the uh rectum coming through the<br>vagina um and then third is the the<br>uterus itself or if you've had a<br>previous hysterctomy what we call the<br>The Vault or the apex of the vagina can<br>descend and we basically have a grading<br>system based on how much the disent is<br>so on the the far um this side here when<br>the entire thing's falling that's<br>obviously a really significant problem<br>very obvious we call that total Vault<br>proident but it may just be that the the<br>vagina is just still completely inside<br>sorry the uterus is completely inside<br>the body but just not quite as high at<br>the top of the vagina that it you know<br>should be um but that is usually not a<br>problem and almost always doesn't<br>require<br>treatment what's the relationship<br>between incontinence and prolapse often<br>people are given the misimpression<br>uh that uh prolapse is causing<br>incontinence or that incontinence is<br>causing prolapse whilst there is a<br>relationship it's important to think of<br>them about quite quite separately you<br>know my earlier slides about the drugs<br>involved for Inc continents or surgeries<br>for Inc continents they are really what<br>you need to do to manage incontinence um<br>whether or not those prolapse can be<br>managed quite<br>separately um in terms of treatment<br>options so again we have some basic<br>things lifestyle things we know that<br>being overweight increases your risk of<br>stress incontinence and increases your<br>risk of prolapse so trying to lose<br>weight and practicing your pelv full<br>exercises is really<br>important peses are a really useful<br>nonsurgical wave managing prolapse they<br>common come in quite a lot of different<br>shapes and sizes the most common are the<br>the ring pissy or the the donut shape um<br>which is a a firm uh plastic gring which<br>comes in lots of different sizes which<br>is placed inside the vagina um and can<br>give really good symptomatic relief some<br>people leave them in all the time some<br>people take them out and it is possibly<br>it is possible to be sexually active<br>with a pesy in so you remove it you can<br>have sexual activity and you can pop it<br>in again so it doesn't preclude sexual<br>activity if those things don't work or<br>maybe they're just not suitable or or or<br>acceptable um there are various<br>different types of operation that can be<br>done and the Very simplest is an<br>operation through the vagina simply<br>using dissolving stitches not involving<br>the use of surgical mesh um we call the<br>sister seal repairs or rect to seal<br>repairs um and they are simple<br>operations to recover from but like a<br>lot of things that are simple their<br>success rate in the long term isn't that<br>great so we find you know 40 50% uh of<br>women can have a recurrence in the long<br>term that was why someone came up with<br>the idea of using mesh for prolapse now<br>this turned out to be a reasonably bad<br>idea um and you can see by that<br>photograph on the right on the that<br>person's hands there that this is a very<br>large piece of mesh uh and these are the<br>meshes which have really been banned<br>around the world not anything to do with<br>the meshes I mentioned earlier that are<br>on a pause which are meshes for<br>incontinence these are the measures for<br>prolapse which have caused a lot of<br>problems which I'll touch on in my final<br>slide um there is one type of mesh for<br>prolapse which is safe though and that's<br>mesh which is actually placed through<br>the tummy through the ab it's quite a<br>major operation but it's the most<br>restorative way of resuspending the<br>pelvic Orbin in the right place it's<br>called a sacred<br>cixi the uterus gets a bit of a a bad<br>reputation on prolapse and historically<br>hysterctomy was seen to be the treatment<br>of pryse but actually it's not the<br>uterus is Fault like I said earlier it's<br>not the uterus is fault that it's<br>falling out and if all we do is remove<br>it we're not really fixing the<br>underlying problem uh which is to<br>provide that support again to the pelvic<br>floor finally um one of the uh things<br>that I'm is a real privilege to be<br>involved in is a relatively new service<br>in New Zealand it's just over a year old<br>called the New Zealand female pelvic mes<br>Service uh and this is a service that<br>came out of a restorative restorative<br>justice activity with the Victoria<br>University of Wellington recognizing<br>that a lot of women around the world but<br>particularly here in aloa have been a<br>high armed by surgical mesh and there<br>wasn't really a process or a place for<br>those women to go a lot of women were<br>sort of fobbed off because mostly<br>because the clinicians that saw them<br>didn't really understand the problem and<br>didn't really know how to treat it so<br>there is this service now um which is a<br>single service based in two sites<br>Oakland and Christ Church um where we<br>see women with any type of Euro<br>gynecological mesh so mesh for<br>incontinence or prolapse um and have a<br>whole lot of options available including<br>surgery but some of these women need<br>psychological help or<br>physiotherapy um all sorts of different<br>things and uh there's a this is just to<br>show you that it's a it's there's a lot<br>to the service it's a it's a complex<br>service so there's a lot of lot of<br>people involved um but uh you know we<br>are really delighted to actually be able<br>to offer this finally in New<br>thanks Giovani gosh so much information<br>um you guys are all superstars that was<br>absolutely wonderful thank you so much<br>we are a little bit over time we won't<br>have time for questions but look um I'm<br>sure our experts here wouldn't mind<br>staying uh a few more minutes if you<br>want to come down with a burning<br>question um would that be all right not<br>for very long of course they've got to<br>get away for their tea as well but if<br>you do want to come and ask please do<br>just before we go I'd like to thank you<br>all for coming uh particularly the BLS<br>um in the audience who've come to<br>clearly either academic reasons or to<br>support the women they love good for you<br>that's fantastic and may I encourage you<br>back next week for the men's Public<br>Health talk we've got a few uh seats<br>left in the auditorium for that men's<br>heart health um GP issues<br>screening um prostate checks uh men's<br>mental health um sleep apnea you name it<br>we're covering it all here next week so<br>um same time same place next Wednesday<br>um that's all um from me um Nami kakano<br>please stay safe and have a good journey<br>back and thank you again all for coming<br>and thank our team as well</p></main><footer style="margin-top: 2rem; background: #0001; padding: 2rem; text-align: center;"><p>We Are The
