public talk at the University<br>of otago Christ Church for<br>2024 last week it was women's midlife uh<br>Health this week uh men's and we've got<br>another great audience tonight thank you<br>all for coming out as why said it in<br>such a such a cold day I looked around<br>this morning and I doubted we get anyone<br>turning up it was looking so miserable<br>great seek knowledge for the sake of<br>your well-being and that's sort of why<br>we're here tonight to seek knowledge to<br>sort out the myths from the truths and<br>to come out just knowing the truths<br>really for many men the 40s and the 50s<br>are the first time many get the sense<br>they're getting older it may well be you<br>play a game of sport and then you get up<br>and you can't move the next day uh or a<br>normal Night Out sees you very exhausted<br>uh and it creeps up it's also at a time<br>when a lot of men are experiencing Peak<br>stresses at work uh like women they're<br>juggling the needs of Aging parents and<br>um growing children and and also too<br>mental health is another issue some are<br>finding it difficult to get a sense of<br>self friendships are harder to maintain<br>in fact I read a study today um that<br>suggests that uh the midlife are the<br>loneliest years of a man's life of all<br>and I thought it was um the older age<br>group but apparently midlife there were<br>concerns for that on top of that we've<br>got the traditional kiwi Bloks in New<br>Zealand don't we you know the cultural<br>stoicism that she'll be right and um I<br>suppose some men don't have GPS or they<br>don't have a good relationship with<br>their GPS I'm clearly um the men here<br>tonight do that's why you're here<br>because you're uh interested in your<br>health and and also a lot of men of<br>course traditionally wait till it's a<br>little bit late to go to see the doctor<br>on some issues uh a little bit of a you<br>know don't worry about it it'll go away<br>tomorrow sort of thing and also there's<br>a lot of research and I say research and<br>inverted commas um stuff on the internet<br>which can lead you astray Dr Google can<br>have you awake all night worrying uh and<br>also you being sold things the whole<br>time you click on something and an<br>algorithm will will send you everything<br>you did or didn't want to know on that<br>particular diet that Health ra regime or<br>that pillow potion so as I said before<br>the myths from the truth that's what um<br>our speakers here tonight let me<br>introduce them we've got Professor Ben<br>Hudson Professor Mark Richards associate<br>professor Katie Douglas and Dr Michael<br>havac and I'd like to thank them in<br>advance very much for spending sparing<br>their time they're very busy clinicians<br>and researchers to be here with us<br>tonight uh very quickly health and<br>safety message if anything happens um<br>don't come down here head up there and<br>head out those two doors this is<br>basement level that's ground level so<br>head out that way that's where you need<br>to go I'm going to introduce and give a<br>quick uh bio on each of the speakers<br>before they get up and talk this evening<br>I'm starting with Professor Ben Hudson<br>Ben's a senior lecturer and head of our<br>campus's department of general practice<br>he's also the convenor for the training<br>intern general practice attachment for<br>aspiring young doctors who've decided to<br>become GPS and don't we need more of<br>them Ben trained in in medicine at<br>Newcastle upon pontine in the UK and<br>completed his GP training in the<br>northeast of England he's worked as a GP<br>in Littleton since<br>2005 his research interest apart from<br>being a general practitioner are in pain<br>management and osteoarthritis and risk<br>communication which is exactly what we<br>want to hear from him tonight in<br>addition to his academic and clinical<br>roles Ben's now medical director at<br>Pegasus Health which supports the<br>largest grouping of GPS in Canterbury<br>which in turn look after over 450,000<br>cantabrians and their health he<br>currently holds advisory positions with<br>the Health's research Council to F or<br>the Ministry of Health and the national<br>heart foundation and he previously<br>chaired the Canterbury faculty of the<br>royal Newan College of general<br>practitioners was a member of the<br>college's National advisory committee<br>and has been an expert advisor to<br>Ben well thank you very much laury and<br>you seem to know more about me than I<br>know um about about myself which is<br>somewhat scary also thank you for the<br>promotion to Professor I'll I'll speak<br>to sue about my pay rise later<br>on uh well K Co to everybody um and I<br>don't need to tell you now I'm a I'm a<br>GP um and I've been at uh my practice<br>for I suppose that's nearly 20 years um<br>and over that time Men's Health has<br>become um something of um I was going to<br>say a love but at least an interest of<br>mine um as I've been for almost all<br>those 20 years the only male GP in fact<br>the only male member of Staff other than<br>for about two years where we had another<br>male doctor so I sometimes feel like I<br>spend a lot of my day um talking um to<br>middle-aged men um and about middle-aged<br>Men's Health um and yet there's<br>definitely a perception that this is a a<br>kind of a difficult area it is nicely<br>illustrated by these somewhat<br>apocalyptic um headlines here that men<br>would prefer to do chores than talk<br>about um their health they won't come to<br>see the doctor they won't do what<br>they're told um to make themselves more<br>uh more more<br>healthy um and I think this reluctance<br>is somewhat in part um due to the fact<br>that we kind of know what we should be<br>doing<br>already um and these are all the usual<br>things these are the best things that<br>you can do and you won't be able to see<br>W be won't be surprised to see uh this<br>list you should stop smoking if you<br>smoke you should be more physically<br>active you should eat a healthy diet and<br>drink uh less<br>alcohol the trouble is these are all<br>quite difficult to do for most of us um<br>one memorable patient when um advised to<br>do all of these things replied that he<br>was um somewhat reluctant to believe<br>that any of these things would make him<br>live any longer but he was pretty<br>confident it would feel like he did um<br>if he followed followed that<br>advice consequently some of these or<br>many of these<br>this this is a a fairly uh common<br>situation certainly in my practice and<br>I'm sure for many of my colleagues don't<br>know if you recognize Andy cap here he<br>was a or I think still is a favorite of<br>I think it's the The Daily Mirror one of<br>the British tabloids he a sort of uh<br>voice of Common Sense working man um<br>every man type um character and so I<br>thought what we might do over the next<br>few minutes is assume that everyone's<br>going to do all the first best things um<br>already because we know that they're the<br>best things to do and think a little bit<br>about the second best things and how you<br>might um work your way through some of<br>those things that you might be offered<br>um in a way that will allow you to make<br>a a rational informed decision about<br>which of them if any you want to do and<br>the list of second best things um is is<br>long it ranges from the sensible and<br>evidence-based statins here to reduce<br>the risk of heart disease and stroke or<br>screening to reduce the risk of uh some<br>diseases to reduce the risk of dying of<br>of some specific diseases um to the less<br>um the less credible and um dietary<br>supplements um this is a particular<br>favorite um not of mine but of of some<br>men I know libido support with triple<br>strength horny goat weed as the as the<br>active ingredient um to the ridiculous<br>testicular tanning um whole body<br>vibration um and this is worse than<br>ridiculous this is kind of dubiously<br>ethically I think that um some wealthy<br>Tech Bros in Silicone Valley are<br>apparently using um transfusions of<br>blood blood products from young healthy<br>men in a sort of pursuit of uh Eternal<br>um Eternal youth so I thought it' be<br>good to think about how you might decide<br>which of these are worth doing and of<br>course it comes down to a balance of of<br>benefit and cost on the one hand does<br>this work um if it does does it work<br>enough to make it worthwhile for you is<br>it addressing something that's important<br>for you balanced against what are the<br>costs and they might be um side effects<br>Financial costs time that uh that taken<br>um to engage in some sort of<br>intervention now to answer the first<br>question um does it work you should<br>expect I think that if someone reputable<br>is offering you an intervention to<br>improve your health that it should have<br>been tested um in a good quality trial<br>and shown conclusively um to have some<br>benefits that's not always the case<br>sadly um an example of this over the<br>last few decades has been the promotion<br>um of vitamin supplementation<br>um based on the observation um that uh<br>people with higher levels of some<br>vitamins are at lower risk of certain<br>diseases a really good example of this<br>has been the enthusiasm that we saw<br>probably over the last couple of decades<br>for vitamin D this was largely based on<br>um a number of studies that correlated<br>levels of vitamin D in people with their<br>risk of a range of diseases and showed<br>um that people with high levels of<br>vitamin D tended to have lower rates of<br>a whole range of diseases even a lower<br>risk of death now that sounds really<br>encouraging and on the basis of that<br>many people were recommended and I think<br>still do take vitamin D um supplements<br>however when you subject vitamin D um to<br>a much more rigorous um assessment of<br>its efficacy and that's uh with a<br>randomized clinical trial where you take<br>a large group of people and randomly<br>allocate them either to take vitamin D<br>or a placebo and um collect data on the<br>number of events that happen um the<br>results are rather disappointing this<br>was a really neat paper in the bmj that<br>summarized um observational studies uh<br>um findings and compared them with trial<br>findings now assuming um that we've<br>satisfied our first question that there<br>is trial data to support an effect and<br>that the intervention is genuinely<br>useful um you should be then asking how<br>big is this effect and if you're given<br>an answer like this this drug X will<br>reduce the risk of cancer or heart<br>attacks or Strokes by 20% you should<br>feel very uh free to ask the obvious<br>question 20% of what now I think it's<br>very unlikely that anybody here would<br>buy a car based simply on the fact that<br>they've been offered a 20% discount on<br>its price you're likely to be much more<br>influenced um about your decision to buy<br>the car uh based on whether you're<br>talking about a 20-year-old um Toyota uh<br>or a brand new Bentley just being given<br>a 20% discounts unlikely to give you<br>enough information to make a decision to<br>commit yourself to the vehicle and just<br>as you'd like to see the cash price and<br>real numbers for the car you should<br>expect the same if you're offered some<br>sort of medication or other intervention<br>to reduce your risk of some health event<br>as an example of this um we can think<br>about uh the use of statins now statins<br>have been subjected to a large number of<br>trials that have consistently shown that<br>they're effective in reducing the risk<br>of heart attack stroke um and death we<br>back to Andy cap here and he's been<br>found to have high cholesterol and his<br>GP not unreasonably is suggesting that<br>he should think about taking a Statin<br>Andy of course uh makes a a wise or asks<br>a wise question how big a difference<br>will it make his GP could say and it<br>would be mathematically true it'll<br>reduce your risk of heart attack stroke<br>Whatever by about 25 5% but it' be much<br>more useful if he could convey that to<br>Andy in some real numbers and to do that<br>U what we'd like to know is how um at<br>risk is Andy um of those conditions<br>first of all without treatment and then<br>with treatment we can think about two<br>different scenarios first of all we've<br>got fit Andy he's 55 he's an ex smoker<br>he's got diabetes but it's well<br>controlled and he's on some treatment<br>for blood pressure and that's doing a<br>good job and we can calculate that<br>Andy's risk of heart disease over the LA<br>over the next five years um is around 7%<br>if we treat Andy with a Statin we'd<br>reduce his risk to about 5% so a 2<br>percentage Point reduction um in his<br>risk of those um conditions if Andy was<br>a bit older so 65 and a smoker and he<br>had high blood pressure that wasn't<br>treated and then for the same level of<br>cholesterol his risk is going to be<br>significantly higher so he's got a 22%<br>risk of um range of cardiac problems<br>over the next 5 years and consequently<br>the reduction in his risk that we would<br>achieve uh with a Statin is um<br>commensurately higher so he gets a 5<br>percentage Point reduction in Risk um to<br>around a 177% risk on<br>treatment now this approach to thinking<br>about um risk and benefit um can be<br>applied just as much to a question of<br>screening as to a question of medication<br>and of course in uh midlife you start to<br>be offered a range of um screening<br>um<br>programs this is samur gray who's a an<br>eminent um Scottish Public Health<br>Physician and a doen of screening and he<br>summarized really succinctly a way of<br>thinking about the benefits and harms of<br>screening and he asks three questions um<br>to do this well gives three suggestions<br>to do this all screening programs do<br>harm some do good as well as harm and of<br>these some do more good than harm at<br>reasonable cost now that way of thinking<br>is framed about screening at a<br>population level but you can apply the<br>same principles to making an individual<br>um decision and as an example um we can<br>think about screening for prostate<br>cancer this graphic um illustrates a<br>thousand men each little square is one<br>man um and what I'd like you to do is<br>consider each of these thousand men and<br>we're going to follow them um for a<br>period of 11 years the little green<br>Square SES in the bottom left hand<br>corner are the around five men who you'd<br>expect to die from prostate cancer over<br>an 11-year period if we don't screen if<br>we screen all those thousand men and<br>follow them over a thousand years sorry<br>over 11 over a thousand years the the<br>outcome is not so good if you screen all<br>the Thousand Year thousand men over an<br>11year period we drop the number who we<br>would expect to die from prostate cancer<br>um from around five deaths to around<br>four deaths so a reduction of one death<br>for every thousand men screened over an<br>11-year period now you could<br>arithmetically correctly say will give<br>you a 20% risk reduction of course<br>that's true uh but it's rather less uh<br>meaningful you'll also want to consider<br>the harms of screening just as you would<br>of any treatment and with prostate<br>cancer um we can make an attempt to<br>quantify them the main ones being over<br>diagnosis the detection of disease that<br>would never have caused problems had we<br>not found it um and side effects of the<br>of the<br>treatments now whether in Sam's words<br>prostate cancer screening does more good<br>than harm at reasonable cost will be a<br>decision that's different for every man<br>every man will balance those benefits<br>and harms in a different way and we<br>shouldn't be I think uncomfortable about<br>the fact that people will reach<br>different decisions about whether or not<br>to screen when uh presented with this<br>information so in closing I'd like to um<br>Express a hope that next time you get<br>dragged to your GP by your<br>long-suffering wife or partner and I'm<br>sure neither of you really look like<br>Andy and flow cap um you feel confident<br>to ask those three questions about any<br>um offer of treatment and of course in<br>the meantime whatever else you decide to<br>do keep doing the best things thanks<br>very<br>much very much again Ben professor Mark<br>Richards now now he is a world leading<br>cardiovascular researcher and he's a<br>Pioneer in the field of cardiac research<br>his work has changed the way heart<br>failure is diagnosed and treated not<br>just in New Zealand but around the globe<br>he graduated in medicine from otaga<br>University and has since earned otago<br>doctor of medicine and doctor of Science<br>degrees as well and as well as being a<br>cardiologist of longstanding here in<br>Canterbury he's the director of the<br>hugely respected Christ Church Health<br>Heart Institute which sits within this<br>campus's Department of Medicine he's a<br>joint Professor too at both the<br>university otago and the University of<br>Singapore for more than 30 years this<br>Christ chch Heart Institute or the chi<br>has been recognized as a world leader in<br>the development of diagnostic tests and<br>treatments and the understanding of risk<br>factors for heart disease a particular<br>note was its Discovery in 1995 of a<br>hormone produced when the heart's under<br>pressure and the hormone blood test they<br>discovered from that is now the most<br>widely used test for heart failure<br>globally the group and its now<br>commercial arm Upstream medical<br>Technologies has developed several<br>sophisticated blood tests which have<br>been used internationally in diagnosing<br>heart failure and assessing how<br>intensively patients need to be treated<br>and with what<br>drugs he and his team have also been<br>working with research centers around the<br>world to define the best use of the<br>heart marker troponin to determine which<br>patients can be S safely sent home from<br>the emergency department when they<br>present with heart issues Mark's a<br>worthy recipient of numerous honors and<br>awards including the University of<br>otago's highest research honors the<br>distinguished research medal he's<br>published more than 300 research papers<br>and in recent years his research has<br>focused on the characteristics of heart<br>failure patients from different<br>welcome thanks Laur and I want to make<br>it clear that all of those things I did<br>entirely by<br>myself so thanks again for coming out on<br>a cold evening everybody um my brief is<br>to tell you whether or not you might be<br>a walking heart attack well if this chat<br>reminds you of yourself you may be at<br>some possible risk there are about<br>177,000 admissions to hospitals in New<br>Zealand every year for people with heart<br>attacks 5,000 people per year die of<br>this condition that's roughly I think um<br>100 a week or thereabouts and even if<br>you survive your first episode over the<br>next year there's quite a high chance<br>one in six chance that you will have<br>another event which could be fatal or<br>nonfatal uh so what is the problem well<br>the heart's a complicated Beast it's a<br>strong muscle that provides circulation<br>to every tissue in your body all day<br>long every day it never takes a break if<br>it does then that's bad that has a blood<br>supply and this is where a lot of the<br>problem arises these vessels course over<br>the surface of the heart and provide it<br>with oxygen and blood they fuel the<br>heart it's got a wiring system so so<br>everything works in the correct order<br>it's got valves so blood flows in the<br>correct direction but really the main<br>reason for heart attacks resides Within<br>These blood vessels which can become<br>narrowed and then if circumstances are<br>unfortunate the narrowings can then sort<br>of break or crack a bit rupture and then<br>the vessel's clot then that bit of heart<br>is subject to threat and may even be<br>killed and new complications include bad<br>things that's called a schic heart<br>disease and the World Health<br>Organization sco B the burden of disease<br>in the world in 1990 and said that<br>coronary heart disease or ES schic heart<br>disease was about number five but by<br>2020 it had risen to number one and it<br>stayed there ever<br>since however that's the world and it<br>makes a big difference where you are in<br>the world it's very good to be a kiwi so<br>the peak threat to middle-aged New<br>Zealand males these are 35 to 65 year<br>olds was way back just before about 1970<br>and over the last 50 years this is<br>what's happened to our rate of coronary<br>heart disease death in this country from<br>about 460 per 100,000 men in that age<br>group down to about 60 and 85% drop over<br>that period of time so it's not all bad<br>and stay in New Zealand is probably a<br>good piece of advice don't go to Russia<br>this is Russia that's the New Zealand<br>pattern Russia doesn't know whether it's<br>peaked yet or not it keeps changing its<br>Mind Over recent times and its current<br>rate is still five times in Russian men<br>as it is in New Zealand men in in fact<br>the rate for New Zealand men is about<br>the same as Russian women because women<br>always do better and that's probably the<br>only thing in common that New Zealand<br>men and Russian women actually have I<br>suspect so what are the things that make<br>you predisposed for these vessels to get<br>narrowed and then to block well there<br>are things that you can do not much<br>about whether you're a man or a woman<br>how old you are or how much aging you're<br>going through and your family background<br>you can't do much about those there are<br>things that you can attack with some<br>degree of success your weight amount of<br>exercise<br>your blood pressure whether your smoke<br>or not what your cholesterol is like<br>Ben's told us a bit about cholesterol<br>presence or absence of diabetes and then<br>very importantly there's a thing called<br>unknown because I hate to tell you this<br>but around about 15% of people who have<br>heart attacks don't have any of those<br>background things in red and we don't<br>really know why and that's uh something<br>of the focus of research around the<br>world uh to this day so what happens if<br>you go along to your GP go to Ben when<br>you're age 40 5 and you want to know are<br>you in good shape do the next 5 or 10<br>years look pretty safe or is there a bit<br>of a threat on the horizon and what we<br>used to do is use these color charts we<br>now use sort of algorithms and computers<br>and it's all a black box but I like<br>these charts because you can kind of<br>understand them easily there's a set of<br>charts for men and there's a set of<br>charts for women um I'm just seeing if I<br>can make a DOT up here seems I can't and<br>you can divide them into whether they<br>are smokers or non smokers have diabetes<br>or not um and what their cholesterol is<br>and what their blood pressure is and you<br>can see within that red surround that we<br>put up there if you look down towards<br>the lower left hand side that's a man<br>who has normal blood pressure in that<br>age group uh lower in 45 uh he has<br>normal cholesterol levels doesn't smoke<br>not diabetic and if you look at the<br>color of a square and then refer that to<br>the key in the middle of the slide<br>you'll see that person has somewhere<br>between two and a half to 5% chance of a<br>major cardiac event or cardiovascular<br>event sometime in the next five years<br>and that might be a heart attack fatal<br>or non-fatal a stroke or some other<br>arterial<br>catastrophe so that's some degree of<br>handle on how to get an idea of your own<br>personal risk and those are all things<br>that GPS can conduct and do routinely<br>all the time there's some good news for<br>New Zealand and that these color charts<br>and these equations were originally<br>based on United States data and it turns<br>out that after you look at a few<br>hundred, kiwis and see what their risks<br>really are over about a 10year period<br>we're actually a lot better off another<br>reason to stay in New Zealand something<br>like 40 or 60% overestimate of risk if<br>you use the American data compared with<br>using New Zealand data for New Zealand<br>people what can you do high blood<br>pressure very prevalent one in five<br>kiwis it's a silent condition often not<br>apparent until you have your stroke or<br>have your heart attack not all of it is<br>Det detected that which is detected not<br>all is treated that which is treated not<br>all is controlled there are however on<br>the bright side many treatments<br>available and they do work the problem<br>is they take time and persistence both<br>by the patient and by the doctor because<br>often you need more than one medication<br>you need more sustained efforts at<br>various lifestyle factors but you can<br>have these things done and they are<br>available and they do work and if you do<br>control your blood pressure you<br>definitely reduce your risk of heart<br>failure in particular and coronary<br>events as well so don't give up on it if<br>you've got blood pressure tablets try<br>and make sure that they're enough and<br>get your blood pressure checked<br>regularly what about smoking well<br>smoking in New Zealand is also quite a<br>good news story you see that from 2022<br>23 only<br>6.8% of adult new zealanders smoke and<br>that compares with about something this<br>20 years ago where we had 16% smoking<br>even better news in young adults 18 to<br>24 year olds now less than 4% smoke<br>whereas back in about 2005 and six 25%<br>one in four of those young adult people<br>were smoking there are tools to help<br>people stop smoking and our primary care<br>givers do understand these tools can<br>offer them I'm pleased to say that my<br>grownup son and daughter have recently<br>successfully stopped smoking with the<br>aid of these these uh<br>uh you know techniques so you can stop<br>and if you can you really should one of<br>the most key things you can do if you're<br>unfortunate enough to have a heart<br>attack having been a smoker is to stop<br>smoking that cuts your risk of a further<br>Heart Attack by 50% it's actually more<br>important than almost anything else you<br>can do including coronary AR bypass<br>graph<br>surgery obesity we all know we're<br>supposed to move more and eat less easy<br>to very hard to do and the history of<br>obesity management programs for the last<br>30 40 years has been one of consistent<br>and almost total failure however there<br>is a bit of a light at the end of that<br>tunnel and that you can supplement<br>lifestyle and nutritional measures with<br>a new family of drugs which appear to be<br>effective and safe uh they this is an<br>example semaglutide the so-called glp1<br>agonists and this graph shows that over<br>a 4-year period a group of people who<br>came into the study weighing about 100<br>kog could drop 10% or more of their body<br>weight and keep it off for four years<br>continuously and that also corresponded<br>with a reduction in heart attack rate<br>and stroke rates so it actually is not<br>only possible it turns out it's actually<br>worth doing it's the first time that's<br>been proven so we don't have really<br>access to that class of drugs right now<br>in New Zealand there are some<br>particularly for diabetic people uh but<br>it will be coming so it's something to<br>keep in mind if you struggle with this<br>the Christ Church Heart Institute looks<br>at a lot of people people who are still<br>healthy on the left hand side of the<br>slide those that have got their coronary<br>disease and those on the right hand side<br>that have advanced to the point where<br>their heart is quite badly damaged and<br>what we do is try to refine that risk<br>estimation that been told you about so I<br>showed you a slide earlier and we<br>defined a man at 45 who had about a 5%<br>risk now it be nice to know not just<br>that you're one of the hundred you<br>you're and somewhere in that 100 there<br>are five people who are going to be<br>unlucky it really nice to know whether<br>you're one of the five or not wouldn't<br>it that would be very useful so a lot of<br>our research is aimed at refining risk<br>stratification at being more accurate at<br>identifying who is in trouble and who is<br>safer and we do that partly through<br>identifying blood tests one of our blood<br>tests is called anti-rnp and what we<br>found is that you can add that test on<br>top of all the things I've mentioned<br>blood pressure cholesterol Etc and you<br>can refine a degree of risk so the Top<br>Line there shows the top levels of<br>anti-pr BMP and compared with the lower<br>most levels the risk is increased by<br>about 10 fold even though these people<br>look pretty much the same if you just<br>saw them walking in the<br>street what about those pesky unknown<br>things that account for that 15% of<br>heart attacks that we cannot really<br>understand why they occurred in the<br>first place well some of those are going<br>to be hidden away in our genes genes<br>that produce protein that are slightly<br>abnormal and make your blood vessels<br>more inclined to narrow and then later<br>possibly clot so this is a work in<br>progress those are chromosomes lined up<br>we've all got a fair number of those and<br>the genes sit on the chromosomes in 2006<br>there about a handful of positions right<br>across the entire genome all of the<br>chromosomes together that looked as<br>though they could be associated with the<br>risk of heart attacks if they were<br>slightly different from the usual<br>standard Gene sequence<br>so that's not much to go on but this as<br>I say is a work in progress and as the<br>years have ticked by there's been a lot<br>of progress in this area so that we now<br>have over 2,000 candidate points in our<br>genes that may be partly responsible in<br>some people for why they get a heart<br>attack and every one of those dots you<br>can see on that slide represents an<br>opportunity it represents increased<br>understanding at one level and possibly<br>a protein Target to diminish or increase<br>to reduce or uh someone's<br>risk the other part of our toolkit aside<br>from markers in Blood and genes is<br>images or the way the heart looks this<br>is ultrasound so the upper image there<br>is a healthy heart moving very well and<br>symmetrically the lower one is far too<br>big and scarcely moving at all and so<br>what we do at Chi is we try to use this<br>tall kit of markers genes and pictures<br>of the heart to predict explain prevent<br>and sometimes even reverse heart<br>damage uh we can see where narrowings in<br>the arteries are and we can also take a<br>look with special scans at the heart<br>that Central chamber there is the<br>interior of the left ventricle the major<br>pumping chamber has a thick wall around<br>it the arrows are pointing to a part of<br>the thick wall that looks a bit<br>different on that initial scan and you<br>can use uh traces that show which parts<br>of the heart are actually metabolizing<br>which cells are alive and functioning<br>well and which are not and you can see<br>the arrows are now defining a rather<br>nonfunctional area so we have a wide<br>tokit and we're making steady progress<br>as time goes by what my last couple of<br>slides what happens if you do have a<br>heart attack what are the prospects if<br>you do have one well help us on the way<br>in Christ Church it should be possible<br>to reach within the main perimeter of<br>the city anywhere within s minutes of a<br>call but you do have to call so you've<br>probably seen the ads on the TV of the<br>chap who takes a shower instead of<br>calling and someone who takes a walk<br>instead of calling don't do that we<br>cannot help you if you don't turn up and<br>sometimes you'll turn up and it'll be<br>unnecessary but we much rather it was<br>that way<br>around uh if you do get in and you've<br>got a blocked artery the chances of<br>opening it with angiography and putting<br>a stance into prop it open are very high<br>and that will diminish damage and<br>improve your prospects once that's done<br>other things are always improving as<br>well our ability to lower cholesterol is<br>getting better and better and better<br>with less and less side effect problems<br>our ability to control people's blood<br>pressure is getting better and better um<br>our ability to manage chol sorry uh um<br>clot is also getting better so the the<br>range of drugs other than rat poison<br>that we used to be stuck with for a long<br>time is actually vastly better and<br>vastly safer than it used to be you can<br>have devices put in pacemakers that keep<br>things ticking at the right rate shock<br>devices that can actually defibrillate<br>you from inside if you need it uh pumps<br>that can actually augment your own pump<br>and in the most desperate situation ECMO<br>extracorporeal membrane oxygenation can<br>take over the entire function of your<br>heart and lung temporarily while your<br>body is giving a chance to recover from<br>whatever crisis has led to that state<br>then there are more standard measures<br>coronat bypass graph surgeries actually<br>one of the most frequent surgeries done<br>in the world now valve surgery valves<br>can be repaired and replaced both by<br>catheter and through the chest and if<br>all else fails with a bit of luck we<br>might be able to get you a new heart<br>that's a hard trick to do but we do do<br>it and it so happens that in New Zealand<br>and Australia survival rates after heart<br>transplant still rank in the best in the<br>world however it would be really be best<br>to avoid all of that and taking<br>attention to your weights your exercise<br>your cigarettes and uh your cholesterol<br>will actually help you stay away from us<br>which is what you really want to do so<br>so I'd like to acknowledge our funders<br>and our thousands of patients and thank<br>listening that's amazing thank you very<br>much Mike um I know you've given the<br>your um microphone away I'll come over<br>to you what what is around what's next<br>what's going to be the big thing that's<br>going to save more lives in five 10<br>years times so maybe more<br>uh just about everything is getting<br>better all the time but it's also<br>getting more expensive and uh the<br>problem is inequality of access for a<br>whole bunch of reasons but to give you<br>one example there's a kind of<br>cholesterol called LP littlea that's not<br>attacked by our standard drugs statins<br>are pretty good Alp little layers lurked<br>in the background and about 15 to 20% of<br>people who have coronary events have<br>this elevation of this rather special<br>kind of cholesterol we've never been<br>able to treat it but recently we've<br>learned how to manipulate genes to make<br>people turn off their own manufacturer<br>of that drug and that's a trial that's<br>going on it's called Gene editing it's<br>actually going on in Christ Church at<br>the present time the only place in New<br>Zealand where it's happening and I<br>predict that that kind of approach will<br>be able to tailor very specific powerful<br>therapies for people and that will<br>burgeon over the next 5 10 years and<br>beyond that sounds amazing thank you<br>sorry this one up all right okay Carry<br>On Dr Michael hav Michael gained his<br>medical degree from the University of<br>otaro in 1993 and he was made a fellow<br>of the Royal College of physicians in<br>2002 he specialized as a respiratory and<br>a sleep physician completing his<br>Advanced Training in respiratory<br>medicine at the Christ Church hospital<br>here before traveling to Australia to<br>gain experience in sleep medicine as<br>well as being a working consultant for<br>Tat Ora waha Canterbury in the public<br>health system Michael's a private<br>consultant at Ken sleep here in Christ<br>Church which provides diagnosis and<br>treatment specifically in sleep medicine<br>as well as clinical assessment they also<br>carry out sleep studies therapy and<br>long-term followup for people with sleep<br>issues it's also a growing area of<br>Medicine with research now making it<br>clear there's an extremely strong Lang<br>between sleep or lack of it and not just<br>our energy levels and mental sharpness<br>and accurity but also hormones which are<br>linked to obesity muscle repair dementia<br>risk-taking Behavior depression and also<br>arming the body's immune system to fight<br>disease and if anyone here sleeps next<br>help uh thank you L thank you for that<br>introduction and um and thank you for<br>inviting me to speak tonight um yes<br>there is such a thing as a sleep<br>specialist um and it's a real thing and<br>yes I am also a doctor as well as a<br>disclaimer so um but I do specialize in<br>sleep medicine and I guess the thing<br>which drew me towards an interest in<br>this is the fact that sleep is one of<br>those things that's ubiquitous we all<br>sleep we all expect to sleep well we run<br>into problems and we don't sleep well um<br>and one of the themes tonight was myths<br>and truths and what I was hoping to do<br>is to talk through a little bit of the<br>myths and truths that are relatively<br>common around sleep and then talk a<br>little bit about some of the more common<br>Sleep Disorders in particular just touch<br>a little bit on obstructive sleep<br>annea um why do we sleep uh a good<br>question we don't really know and in<br>fact the quote that I put up here is<br>from a guy called Bill de um Bill de is<br>considered the father of modern sleep<br>medicine he discovered REM sleep he<br>wrote the 900 page textbook that's<br>sitting in my office and his answer was<br>as far as we know it's just because we<br>get sleepy um so there wasn't really a<br>scientific answer given to that<br>but what we do know is that sleep is<br>really essential for all animal species<br>and for all of our normal bodily<br>functions all animals that have a brain<br>will sleep and some animals with very<br>small brains bees nematodes probably<br>sleep as well as far as we can tell um<br>if you deprive people of sleep they have<br>a much longer sleep to catch up clearly<br>we need a balance of sleep and if we<br>restrict our sleep there are very<br>immediate and very significant<br>impairments in brain function so clearly<br>our brain requires sleep to function<br>normally a really good example of that<br>is in Dolphins who sleep with one half<br>of their brain at a time so they can<br>remain awake and they can still swim<br>around and not drown but they're also<br>getting the restoration and uh benefits<br>of sleep and they alternate from one<br>side to the other and lots of other<br>Aquatic mammals do that as well the<br>theories that we have are that sleep is<br>a way of avoiding harm it gets us away<br>from predators at night and uh when<br>we're not alert um it's really important<br>for brain growth and development in kids<br>the brain requires sleep to to develop<br>new skills and for wiring to become<br>established brain functions really<br>important energy conservation and we<br>know that most body systems have a body<br>clock so you have a A system that<br>rotates Around the Clock through day and<br>night and it's very much tied them with<br>our sleep and if we don't sleep well or<br>we sleep at the wrong time a body clock<br>gets deranged and then issues with our<br>immune system um muscle strength normal<br>physiological functioning all of those<br>things deteriorate and eventually if we<br>don't sleep for prolonged periods of<br>time we fall ill our immune system<br>doesn't work and eventually we die um<br>and so it's sleep is fundamental one of<br>those things that we cannot live<br>without this is an example of what a<br>normal sleep should look like and I<br>really put this up not that I<br>want answer questions<br>sorry justar<br>that I'm not putting this up because<br>there's going to be a quiz at the end<br>and I want you to recall all the<br>different sleep stages but really to<br>just show you that there's a structure<br>to our sleep it's not just a single<br>block of the same thing sleep is quite<br>variable we start off awake we go very<br>rapidly through light stages of sleep<br>and then we go into Stage three4 or deep<br>sleep that's the sleep that it's really<br>hard to wake from It's a sleep that if<br>you're woken from you might not remember<br>having been woken and if you have a nap<br>in the afternoon and sleep for more than<br>about half an hour you'll go into deep<br>sleep and you'll feel Terri terrible<br>when you wake up and you get the Sleep<br>inurture battle happens in the first<br>half of the night that's really<br>important we go through a little bit<br>more of that and then we have these<br>periods of REM sleep or dreaming sleep<br>where we dream where muscles are relaxed<br>and actually REM sleep's really light<br>it's broken we wake up from dreams we go<br>back into dreams and rim sleep is one of<br>those things that we see a lot of uh<br>later on in the night and rim is one of<br>the things that we lose with Sleep<br>Disorders particularly with things like<br>sleep apnea but the point is that it's<br>really normal to wake no one sleeps<br>right through without waking it's very<br>abnormal to do that so some people will<br>overestimate how much they're awake or<br>they'll assume that they shouldn't wake<br>at night but it's actually a normal part<br>of the way that our brains<br>sleep this is an example of our sleep<br>duration and people always say Dr the<br>VAC how much sleep should I get I hear<br>it's eight hours what what do you think<br>and it's actually really variable and it<br>varies across age and time and it varies<br>from person to person so some people are<br>long sleepers other people are short<br>sleepers we have our own body clock and<br>that body clock dictates how much sleep<br>we need the point I'd like to make with<br>this is that kids need lots of sleep<br>teenagers and Adolescence once you hit<br>young adulthood pretty much from then on<br>for the rest of your life you need about<br>8 hours sleep at night between 7 and 9<br>and I guess the point here is that as<br>you get older you just expect not to<br>sleep as well you expect your sleep to<br>be more broken you expect that you're<br>not going to get as much sleep that's<br>actually not true and and if you're not<br>sleeping as well or you're not getting<br>as much sleep it maybe because you have<br>a sleep disorder and not simply because<br>aging confers a worse Sleep Quality<br>that's not the<br>case and this leads into some common<br>myths about sleep and things that we<br>often try and debunk when we're seeing<br>people and we're telling them about<br>their sleep habits um you can't train<br>yourself to get more sleep uh sorry to<br>get less sleep um this is great story of<br>Winston Churchill who said he only slept<br>for four or five hours a night and<br>that's all he needed and he probably was<br>just a short sleeper and got by on that<br>if you try and train yourself to get<br>less sleep than your body clock requires<br>you just get tired and then you won't<br>function very well so that doesn't tend<br>to work but conversely um you can uh<br>sorry you you can't uh Bank sleep in<br>advance is the other thing so if you<br>have long periods of sleep it's not like<br>you can then have a weekend where you<br>only spend three hours of sleep every<br>night the body doesn't doesn't work that<br>way you need the same amount of sleep<br>consistently and having long sleeps<br>doesn't protect you against being sleep<br>deprived um you can't decrease tiredness<br>by spending more time in bed if you lie<br>in bed awake and you're not sleeping<br>you're not going to get less tired in<br>fact the opposite is true there's this<br>thing called Sleep inertia where people<br>that have long periods of time in bed or<br>long periods of trying to sleep they<br>become more tired they tend to develop<br>more of a of a habit of of inertia and<br>it causes physical tiredness and<br>increase in sleepiness so prolonged bed<br>periods are actually<br>counterproductive um I don't think it's<br>wise to avoid daytime napping if you're<br>tired and there's good evidence that<br>having short naps during the day 20<br>minutes and no more than that is really<br>helpful to restore you if you've been<br>sleep restricted on previous nights or<br>if you're tired our body clock says that<br>we all get sleepy in the sort of early<br>to middle part of the afternoon like<br>Siesta time in the Mediterranean that's<br>your body's way of telling you that a<br>sleep is a good thing to have we don't<br>always have the opportunity to do that<br>but short sleeps like 20 minutes really<br>help to restore you and improve brain<br>function<br>any longer than that and you get into<br>that deep sleep I mentioned earlier and<br>then it's much harder to wake up and it<br>will affect the way you sleep the<br>following night so short NPS are are a<br>good thing um alcohol cannot help you<br>sleep better alcohol may help you to<br>fall asleep at the very beginning of the<br>night it's a neuro cognitive depressant<br>but your sleep quality is impaired and<br>is much worse it's more broken um it<br>then leads to other Sleep Disorders<br>you're up for a pee two or three times<br>over night alcohol generally is<br>counterproductive to Sleep<br>Quality and as I said earlier uh you<br>should not expect your sleep to get<br>worse as you get older uh if it's<br>getting worse there may be some other<br>problem and maybe having your sleep<br>assessed formally is the right thing to<br>do rather than just at<br>expectation these are my 10 tips for<br>good sleep hygiene things to remember um<br>and they're really straightforward and<br>they're fairly self-evident and probably<br>don't need me to tell you most of these<br>things caffeinees a stimulant if you<br>have it with than four hours of bed it<br>will probably delay falling asleep<br>nicotine likewise is a stimulant I'm a<br>respiratory physician as well none of my<br>patient should be using nicotine at all<br>anyway but if they're going to smoke<br>they should do it earlier in the day um<br>and likewise with alcohol large meals<br>tend to delay sleep onset um exercise is<br>good but not just before you go to bed<br>you're still very stimulated and it<br>takes time to relax make sure that your<br>sleep environment is I've said good<br>clean sleep en environment it's tidy and<br>it's orderly and it's calm and it's<br>quiet and there dim lighting and it's<br>warm and all those things that you need<br>to get a good night<br>sleep um and I've kind of covered some<br>of those other things the bedroom really<br>should be for sleeping not TV or social<br>media or eating or gaming or other<br>things that people do in bed we know<br>that those sorts of activities in bed or<br>at bedtime they shine light into your<br>eyes which tell your brain it's time to<br>wake up they stimulate the brain and<br>they will delay sleep on it as well and<br>so that last hour before sleep before<br>getting into bed and turning out the<br>lights as a time of preparation for<br>Sleep relaxation and trying to set the<br>brain up for<br>that the other thing is that we rely<br>upon routine our brains love routine we<br>love waking at the same time going to<br>bed at the same time that's our body<br>clock that's how we tell our body clock<br>how it works and if we disrupt that<br>routine our brain doesn't know what to<br>do and if you stay up late your brain<br>then suddenly thinks well I should be<br>staying up late every night and it gets<br>harder to fall asleep at night and if<br>you sleep in in the morning like my<br>teenage kids have been doing for about<br>the last 10 years that becomes the norm<br>and then they'll go to bed later and<br>they'll wake up later and your whole<br>body uh clock can shift so trying to<br>establish routine is really key for for<br>good<br>sleeping I'm just going to finish by<br>talking a little bit about obstructive<br>sleep apnea which is the most common<br>serious sleep disorder um some studies<br>estimate that it the adult population<br>have sleep apnea so it's really common<br>um in essence without kind of sciencing<br>it up too much it's recurrent partial or<br>complete blockage of the throat during<br>sleep that narrowing leads to a drop in<br>oxygen it leads to a stoppage or pause<br>of breathing which is called an apnea<br>that then in turn leads to arousal from<br>sleep broken and disrupted sleep uh and<br>daytime consequences which include<br>tiredness and poor brain<br>function um there's a spectrum of<br>disease I got a question for the men in<br>the audience how many of you snore show<br>of hands please how many of you<br>snore okay B partners of the men who are<br>here with them how many of your husbands<br>or Partners snore okay pretty good<br>actually usually the ratio is very much<br>weighted in favor of the partners rather<br>than the sufferers um because snoring is<br>one of those things that that men don't<br>like to talk about um it's embarrassing<br>it's a sign of weakness um they don't<br>consider it's a problem CU pretty much<br>most of the time you don't hear yourself<br>snoring so often when I see patients who<br>snore with sleep apne or it's the bed<br>Partners who have encouraged them to<br>come along somewhat reluctantly why are<br>you here I'm here cuz she tells me I<br>snore do you think you've got a problem<br>no it's her problem but these are<br>couples who now spend nights in<br>different rooms uh or the snoring is so<br>loud on one side of the bed that the bed<br>partner's going deaf with high tone<br>hearing list on that right ear that<br>faces where the snora is seen that twice<br>now so snoring can be important but<br>snoring is key cuz snoring is a key<br>feature of sleep apnea the main risk<br>factors for sleep apnea are being a man<br>being middle-aged carrying extra weight<br>having a family history of sleep apnea<br>even if you're not overweight if there's<br>a genetic history it means your Airways<br>probably narrow um and things you can do<br>to avoid like alcohol and smoking it's<br>very similar to the risk effectors that<br>Max already told us<br>about here are some of the symptoms loud<br>snoring yet we've we've touched on that<br>witnessed apneas where there are<br>breathing pauses your bed partner says<br>look he snores really loudly and then he<br>just goes quiet for like half a minute<br>and I think he's dead and Shake him and<br>he starts breathing again he starts<br>snoring again and I go I wish he'd stop<br>breathing again and just kind of goes on<br>and on um but that's the sort of History<br>we get um sufferers of sleep apne often<br>don't know this they might wake up<br>choking or gasping or feeling that their<br>throat's blocked up not always often<br>they might just say their sleep is<br>restless they get up to pee a lot peeing<br>three or four times a night is often a<br>feature of sleep<br>apnea and then on the day they got all<br>these things wake up with a headache<br>like I'm hung over but I haven't had<br>alcohol like for 10 years why do I feel<br>so terrible in the morning very tired<br>poor concentration and obviously these<br>last two things down here about uh<br>sleepiness and um and concerns around<br>routine activities that's particularly<br>important if you're an occupational<br>driver or if your occupation involves<br>Machinery or you know skill sore or<br>you're a butcher or some of those things<br>where there's risk if you lose attention<br>occupational risks really key with some<br>of these sleep<br>conditions sleep apnea is not just a<br>problem causing sleepiness and we now<br>know that it's a it's a risk factor for<br>a whole range of comorbidities and<br>disorders cardiovascular disease<br>hypertension stroke they're much higher<br>in people with untreated severe sleep<br>apnea compared to those that don't have<br>it or people who have got sleep apnea<br>but it's<br>treated um erectile dysfunction really<br>common uh cause of sleep apnea<br>depression anxiety heart disease obesity<br>obesity is great it causes sleep apnea<br>and sleep apnea causes obesity through<br>changes and hormone regulation so sort<br>of perpetuates itself and and makes<br>itself worse so this is a systemic<br>problem it's not just a single brain<br>function it's the whole body being<br>affected by Sleep<br>Apnea which comes onto treatment and<br>fortunately treatment of sleep apnea um<br>is accessible it's not ideal disclaimer<br>some of the stuff we use CET machines<br>you know they're not brilliant but they<br>work really well for those people with<br>significant symptomatic sleep apnea and<br>there's this myth that you put on a cpet<br>machine you look like Darth Vader nobody<br>wants to talk to you or sleep with you<br>um it's certainly quieter than snoring<br>uh and it's certainly more attractive to<br>your partner than sleeping in a<br>different room because of the snoring so<br>there are ways that we can improve<br>people's sleep apnea management often<br>lifestyle factors we've already heard<br>about weight loss and exercise and we<br>know that if you can lose 10% of your<br>body weight you'll probably drop sleep<br>apy and severity by about a third if you<br>exercise and we're talking about<br>cardiovascular exercise you will reduce<br>sleep apne and severity even if your<br>weight doesn't change so just getting<br>fit will help to reduce breathing pauses<br>at<br>night um hospital system uses CPAP if<br>you are refering to us and you're<br>diagnosed with sleep apnea you'll be<br>offered a trial of a CPAP machine if<br>you're severe enough um there's a whole<br>range of devices they're not noisy<br>they're much quieter than they used to<br>be The Masks are really comfortable<br>there are much better than the<br>technology we had 10 or 15 years ago um<br>and basically cat works just by<br>providing air pressure to the throat to<br>hold it open to stop those breathing<br>pauses to stop snoring and to restore<br>some of that normal brain function that<br>you get when you have sleep<br>apnea we also um refer people for a<br>thing called a mandibular splint and<br>this is a dental device made by a<br>dentist or an orthodontist you wear it<br>in your mouth it attaches to your teeth<br>it moves your jaw forward slowly and<br>gradually over time and that improves<br>air flow and reduces snoring and um can<br>reduce sleep apnea almost as well as a<br>CPAP machine can now so it's quite<br>equivalent to that surgery has a role<br>but really a limited role and there was<br>a lot of surgery done 10 or 20 years ago<br>for people with sleep apnea who probably<br>didn't need it or maybe didn't wen't<br>selected as the right group the people<br>that we refer kids or teenagers with big<br>tonsils and anyone that I see with sleep<br>apnea we check tonsil size because it's<br>a really important cause of sleep apnea<br>in Young young<br>people um and weight loss surgery um and<br>the Advent of these weight loss drugs<br>we're hearing about May well um supplant<br>weight loss surgery but at the moment if<br>you can access it weight loss surgery is<br>a really good way of modifying a whole<br>bunch of things but also obstructive<br>sleep<br>at um local resources um so you can see<br>a sleep specialist and your sleep<br>specialist closest to you as your GP<br>we've got a really good group of GPS in<br>Christ Church they've all been to our<br>sleep education sessions they're all<br>tied in with our community sleep<br>assessment pathway so if you go to your<br>GP and say I think I've got sleep apnea<br>your GP will refer you for a fully<br>funded home assessment it's a home<br>monitor that you wear in your own bed at<br>night just for one night that detects<br>severe sleep apnea um doesn't cost you<br>anything and then those results get put<br>through and people with severe sleep<br>apnea come through the hospital system<br>um if you're really severe or you've got<br>an occupation where you're at risk or<br>you've got significant health issues you<br>may qualify foros Hospital funded cpep<br>therapy which is provided um through the<br>too Aura um there are some private sleep<br>providers I'm one of them I'm not the<br>only one there's a lot of people doing<br>sleep medicine they're also dentists<br>that provide care for sleep aty with<br>those devices I've shown you here's a<br>couple of websites Health info is a<br>patient website you can go log into that<br>there's a whole series of pages on not<br>just sleep apnea but insomnia and other<br>sleep conditions sleep Health Foundation<br>is just a good website for information<br>about sleep disorders in general um and<br>that bottom one is um for those people<br>with insomnia which I haven't talked<br>about but it's a good resource for<br>managing insomnia um I would direct you<br>to those things if you got concerns<br>about your<br>you so those things I when you go on<br>Instagram you click on something and you<br>just get again and again your algorithm<br>all all those little devices for your<br>nose those clips waste of time and money<br>pretty much yeah um I mean it's a it<br>sounds a bit cliche but the more you<br>spin the more likely you are to get<br>something that works so the mouth guards<br>that I've showed you you can get a boil<br>and bite one from Harvey Norman you<br>stick it in a jug of boiling water and<br>put it in your mouth it's about as good<br>as a rugby mouth guard so not great um<br>the the ones that are made by a dentist<br>or are fitted they're much better um<br>taping your mouth shut my dad did that<br>for about 10 years I told him not to<br>tell anybody that you tape your mouth<br>shut cuz your son's a sleep specialist<br>and we don't recommend doing that nose<br>Clips don't tend to do a lot I mean most<br>of those things are of limited benefit<br>and if you've got significant sleep at<br>me you really need to get it properly<br>assessed yeah good advice that's<br>wonderful thanks so much again<br>Michael right our last speaker associate<br>professor Katie Douglas Katie gained<br>both her Bachelor of Science honors and<br>her PhD here at the University of otaro<br>she's a research associate professor in<br>our campus's department of psychological<br>medicine and

Asian Society of<br>bipolar and depressive disorders and she<br>supervises several PhD students here in<br>the areas of cognitive functioning and<br>mood and anxiety disorders welcome Kate<br>Koto um I'm starting off with a little<br>bit of audience participation just to<br>make sure everyone's still alert for the<br>last Talk of the<br>evening so when thinking about um Men's<br>Health and particularly mental health<br>and midlife what uh what do you think<br>this sports car might<br>represent shout out if you heav any<br>crisis<br>Bingo he's not my brother-in-law who I<br>um how about these<br>marbles oh yeah you're on to it losing<br>your marbles so um I'm a as as Laur Le<br>said I'm a clinical psychologist um and<br>a mental health researcher over the road<br>at the department of psychological<br>medicine and um tonight I'm hoping to uh<br>bust some myths and provide some truths<br>about men's mental health uh and midlife<br>and I'm going to be weaving these<br>metaphors into the talk<br>so first of all uh the phenomenon of a<br>midlife crisis I feel like Laur actually<br>covered quite a lot of this content in<br>her introduction at the start um<br>but um I'm sure all of you have heard of<br>the term tossed around in your Social<br>Circles perhaps um one of your male<br>friends has impulsively brought a car or<br>a e- mountain bike um<br>and and and perhaps that's a sign that<br>this person's going through a midlife<br>crisis but is it actually a thing and<br>and so I'm going to spend a little bit<br>of time just kind of fleshing out um<br>what a midlife crisis is there's lots of<br>variable definitions on Dr Google but<br>essentially what a midlife<br>crisis um is is is a a period of<br>emotional turmoil with sudden changes in<br>personal goals and lifestyle that occurs<br>in<br>midlife flishing it out a bit more when<br>we talk about midlife it's a pretty<br>broad age range somewhere usually from<br>about 40 to 60 years old it's the period<br>of time that's sandwiched between young<br>adulthood and old age um but in terms of<br>midlife crisis literature essentially<br>it's referring to a kind of a group of<br>transitions that are that are difficult<br>for men in their midlife so this might<br>be things like divorce um an empty nest<br>syndrome losing your parents or losing<br>your job but we also know that there's<br>lots of other stressful transitions<br>across your life and perhaps is not<br>really<br>um um the stress the stresses in midlife<br>might not be particularly more than in<br>other periods of your life we also know<br>that actually plenty of men go through<br>midlife period quite positively it can<br>be a time where you're making positive<br>changes and um rep<br>prioritizing based on these transitions<br>so it's by no means inevitable that<br>everyone is going to go through a<br>midlife crisis and actually research<br>suggests that um in midlife about 10% of<br>men will actually go through um these<br>midlife transitions in a crisis-like<br>way um there also seems to be this<br>thought that it's restricted to men<br>often men who are um who are kind of<br>identified as having a midlife crisis so<br>if a man seems to be struggling with<br>mental health problems in midlife it's<br>put down to a midlife crisis whereas if<br>women are struggling with mental health<br>in midlife it seems to be put down to<br>menopause or other<br>things um but there actually danger in<br>these assumptions which I'll come to<br>soon um what we do know definitely about<br>a midlife crisis is that it's not<br>actually a mental health Disorder so<br>it's not in our diagnostic manual of<br>mental health disorders what is in this<br>manual is major depressive disorder or<br>depression which has some overlapping<br>features um so major depressive disorder<br>or depression is often called the common<br>cold of mental health disorders because<br>it's so common it affects one in six new<br>zealanders and one in eight men at some<br>point in their life um and essentially<br>to get a diagnosis of depression you<br>need to have at least five of these<br>symptoms in the picture here so you have<br>to have a depressed mood and inability<br>to feel pleasure or sometimes known as<br>anhedonia there's also often feelings of<br>worthlessness or excessive guilt<br>suicidal thinking or plans um there's<br>the the fatigue and um loss of energy as<br>well as sleep and appetite changes and<br>then there's the cognitive symptoms like<br>having trouble concentrating um or<br>having problems making<br>decisions to actually get diagnosed with<br>depression this also needs to be causing<br>significant impairment so people are<br>often finding it very hard to hold down<br>a job or um function in relationships<br>when when you're in the midst of a<br>depressive<br>episode so men might not actually<br>realize that they're depressed in<br>midlife um or they may not seek help<br>because it's put down to a midlife<br>crisis that's kind of normal and<br>transient thing that they'll get over<br>with time or after they've bought their<br>fancy<br>car um Laur also touched on this the<br>kind of context of um growing up in New<br>Zealand and I think for people in their<br>midlife at the moment it's really common<br>that they grew up in a context of kind<br>of uh not showing signs of vulnerability<br>or weakness or um the saying that I<br>heard a lot when I was growing up was um<br>drink a cup of concrete and harden up<br>and I think that these kind of sayings<br>that um that are really common in the<br>New Zealand context actually uh aren't<br>helpful in terms of seeking help if<br>you're really struggling with mental<br>health<br>problems so this um is a graph here<br>that's showing the rates of um suicide<br>in New Zealand um what we know is that<br>uh women are much more likely to have<br>depression than men but men as you can<br>see from this graph are much more likely<br>to commit suicide um so so this shows<br>the number of confirmed suicides each<br>year um in New Zealand and you can see<br>in<br>2019 um nearly 500 men committed suicide<br>so it's um a very concerning issue that<br>I'm circling back to Ben's talk now and<br>saying that you need to go to your GP um<br>you if you or your loved one is<br>concerned that um either you're<br>depressed or you're going through a<br>midlife crisis it's worth going to see<br>your GP um the the gold standard<br>treatment for depression is is a<br>combination of anti-depressant<br>medication and Psych olical therapy um<br>and your GP can help with both of those<br>in terms of prescribing medication and<br>also referring to psychological<br>therapy um for anti-depressant<br>medications sometimes it can be a um a<br>case of trying a few before you find one<br>that fits for you and in terms of<br>psychological therapy in terms of the<br>misconceptions about that it doesn't<br>look like the picture there um I've<br>never had someone lie down in therapy<br>when I've been doing therapy I have had<br>one person fall asleep sleep who<br>probably had sleep apnea um but but I<br>think sometimes there's a hesitation to<br>go to therapy because of the<br>misconceptions from the media of what<br>therapy actually is it is actually a<br>very systematic um practical pragmatic<br>treatment um and yes it's great to be<br>able to open up and um show<br>vulnerability and show emotion but it's<br>tailored to you um so there's every hope<br>if you go for psychological therapy that<br>you'll be able to make short and<br>so the next it's not really a<br>misconception this one's more of a<br>concern that is um quite common in<br>midlife for men and that's am I losing<br>my marbles the saying kind of refers to<br>the perception that maybe uh you feel<br>like your mental functions or your<br>cognitive functions aren't quite what<br>they used to be um and there's a concern<br>that this these perceived cognitive<br>problems might actually be the start of<br>something more Sinister perhaps it's a<br>um a decline into um aging with<br>cognitive impairment or<br>dementia so perhaps it's uh feeling like<br>you can't keep up with conversations as<br>well as you used to or perhaps you're<br>losing things and forgetting things more<br>often or maybe it's more a more<br>pervasive brain fog that you're<br>feeling so for some people those<br>cognitive changes might actually be a<br>sign that there's something going on and<br>that you might be in the early stages of<br>cognitive um decline but for many these<br>cognitive symptoms might actually be uh<br>related to lifestyle or mental health<br>um<br>factors so just taking a quick step back<br>to to for some definitions here when I'm<br>talking about cognitive functions I'm<br>talking about brain related functions<br>that we need to be able to complete from<br>the most simple to the most complex<br>tasks in our day-to-day lives so all of<br>these things here would be classed as<br>cognitive<br>functions um perhaps it was trying to<br>find a park tonight to make this talk so<br>you used some spatial ability to get<br>here and then paying attention in these<br>talks sustained attention now because<br>we're nearly at an hour or perhaps it's<br>actually trying to remember what was<br>said in these talks tomorrow when you<br>talk about it with colleagues or<br>friends and what we know in terms of the<br>mood disorder or depression literature<br>is that when when you're in a episode of<br>depression these cognitive functions are<br>often very impaired we often show pretty<br>large differences when we're testing a<br>um when we're looking at a depressed<br>sample compared with people without<br>depression so it's really common for me<br>to hear things like I have not read a<br>book for three years now because I can't<br>concentrate I can read the same sentence<br>again and again it used to be something<br>I really<br>enjoyed so it might not be that you're<br>losing your marbles it might be actually<br>that these perceived cognitive um<br>changes might be the sign of depression<br>or a mental health disorder or something<br>else that I'll come to<br>soon so these cognitive symptoms and<br>depression are actually a core feature<br>of depression and they relate really<br>strong L to problems in your day-to-day<br>functioning such as in your work in your<br>relationships um in any other kind of uh<br>chores or daily um functions they're<br>also experienced as really frustrating<br>and concerning for people um often<br>actually rated as more concerning and<br>frustrating than um the mood symptoms of<br>depression like depressed<br>mood um we also know that men are likely<br>to under report cognitive symptoms so<br>they have a more stoic profile um so<br>even if they're showing impairment on<br>cognitive tests they might be less<br>likely to report that they're having<br>cognitive<br>problems so hopefully I've hammered home<br>the message that depression and<br>cognitive impairment often go hand in<br>hand there are other things that also<br>relate to cognitive impairment that is<br>important to think about too so chronic<br>stress if you're in a really uh uh<br>stressful job that you're working long<br>hours in and you're feeling burnt out<br>and that has happened over a prolonged<br>period of time it's likely that actually<br>that is causing some brain changes and<br>that has an impact on your cognitive<br>functions sleep problems we've heard<br>about from Mike and the impact that that<br>has on your cognitive functions you'll<br>all know from sleep deprivation if<br>you've had young kids that is pretty<br>hard to feel cognitively sharp the next<br>day and all of these factors all kind of<br>mixed together<br>too so in terms of improving cognitive<br>functions I'm repeating some messages<br>here um the top three points of things<br>that you can do that should actually<br>help<br>uh cognitive functions and I wanted to<br>spend the last few minutes talking about<br>brain training which is a specific<br>treatment designed to improve cognitive<br>functions so this is a treatment that um<br>has gained some attention well a lot of<br>attention in the dementia and<br>Alzheimer's literature in terms of uh<br>protecting against dementing processes<br>but it's also been found to be effective<br>for depression and lots of other mental<br>health disorders and so when I talk<br>about brain training and these types of<br>um areas in terms of mental health<br>disorders I'm talking about regular and<br>repetitive practice on exercises to<br>improve or maintain one's cognitive<br>ability so we use um and in lots of the<br>studies that we use at the department<br>that we do at the department sorry we<br>use a platform called happy neuron um<br>and this is a um something that can be<br>accessed by anyone you do have to pay<br>money but it is it's a good one there's<br>lots of other free apps like elevation<br>and Lumosity that um are similar but I I<br>think I would recommend happy neuron as<br>the first Port of Call because it's um<br>designed with science and mind so that's<br>something that you can do in terms of<br>brain training exercises and essentially<br>that's just like going to the gym for a<br>physical workout you're wanting to keep<br>training your brain to maintain<br>cognitive<br>Health there's other things you can do<br>outside of computerized exercises too if<br>you're not really a computer person so<br>you can actually set up your life so<br>you're still Co cognitively challenging<br>yourself things like um training your<br>memory by not taking your shopping list<br>to the supermarket and trying to<br>remember all the items which there's<br>some funny looks in the audience for<br>that you could just have the list in the<br>in the back pocket in case it's you're<br>hosting a dinner party that night or<br>something one that I do because I'm<br>particularly poor on spatial memory is I<br>try and um do brain training exercises<br>by not relying on Google Maps and trying<br>to get places without getting too lost<br>or taking new routs to get to<br>places there's a teacher at my kids<br>school who has the seemingly amazing<br>ability to remember every kid's name in<br>the school as well as all the family<br>members and he also welcomes every kid<br>at the morning at the school crossing in<br>their native language and um being the<br>research geek that I am I had to go and<br>ask him what he was doing and I kind of<br>thought he was going to just say he's<br>got some photographic memory but<br>actually he is just constantly training<br>himself he was saying that he just walks<br>around the playground every day kind of<br>trying to memorize kids' names so he's<br>repeating it and he's using all all<br>sorts of different memory strategies to<br>to make sure um he remembers everyone's<br>names and that's very helpful for his<br>job as a teacher there's all sorts of<br>other things you can do um learning new<br>skills learning languages or musical<br>instruments all of these things um are<br>really helpful in terms of maintaining<br>brain</p></main><footer style="margin-top:
