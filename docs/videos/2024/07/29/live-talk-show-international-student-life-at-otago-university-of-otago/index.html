we're<br>sitting in our media Production Studio<br>in the denan campus so beautiful<br>facilities here and my name is Sarah and<br>I work in the international department<br>and my co-host<br>K my name is Alba and as an<br>international student myself uh who<br>traveled all the way from Spain and<br>decided to stay here in New Zealand this<br>is my sixth year I'm really excited to<br>introduce but also meet our panel of<br>international students uh welcome thank<br>you for being here um and we'll start<br>with a round of introductions so let's<br>meet<br>Sid hi I'm Sid and I'm from Malaysia I'm<br>currently studying a bachelor of<br>Sciences majoring in energy science and<br>I love it here at tago I like to start<br>my day off with a coffee and then head<br>off to my<br>classes some days I have lectures and<br>some days I have experimental labs and I<br>definitely prefer the labs more outside<br>of steud I enjoy hanging out with my<br>friends and going to the beach can't<br>wait to talk to you about my otago<br>you so said welcome thank you so much<br>for joining us and all the way from<br>Alisia as well I've got to ask the<br>jacket what the jacket in the video what<br>was that all about so that was for my<br>class edit last semester it was called<br>environmental physics and that day we<br>had to wear these um really thick<br>jackets that they use in the Antarctic<br>to get eye samples so for that specific<br>lab we were um freezing water and in an<br>ice room in the science building yeah<br>and the room was I think<br>-22° 22 22 understandable why you have<br>very very big jacket on there a little<br>bit of thetic right here on campus<br>Joanna hey I'm Joanna from Indonesia I'm<br>studying Bachelor of Arts atago after I<br>graduated from the foundation studies<br>the study spaces are perfect because<br>they are quiet comfortable and it's easy<br>to concentrate I especially like the<br>Central<br>Library when I want more<br>there's always things to do around the<br>campus like food Sports entertainment<br>food warm welcome to you Janna I love<br>your journey through pathway into uh<br>full-time study here at atago and I love<br>that you've shown both the academic side<br>but also the<br>extracurricular uh part of your<br>experience you mentioned the Central<br>Library as one of the amazing seven<br>libraries we have on campus but what is<br>is it about the Central Library that you<br>like I think it's just really close to<br>all of the study spaces and all of my<br>classes so it's really easy to get to<br>there and there's also a lot of cafes<br>and food there and a lot of my friends<br>go there too so I feel like it's such a<br>nice place to just sit there with my<br>friends and like study together<br>fantastic you're most welcome thank you<br>next up uh let's meet our first Master<br>student actually uh<br>Tia oh my<br>Ling Ling hi I'm Ling Ling and I come<br>from<br>China I'm studying a master of arts in<br>medium film and<br>communication what interested me first<br>was the peaceful Vibe and the beautiful<br>sceneries at<br>school in my spell time I like to do<br>mushroom hunting volunteering at Oto and<br>exploring New Zealand mirle sound is<br>amazing I'm so happy to be here at oo<br>join<br>me Ling langing again looks like you've<br>done lots of stuff around on campus as<br>well as off campus but I've got to ask<br>you're volunteering it looks like<br>midwinter Carnival am I right yes yeah<br>and what did you do um I'm like a um a<br>procession guide because it's my first<br>time to do the volunteer things here and<br>that time just makes me feel like so<br>happy because I can um be with a lot of<br>cute kids and I need to Gathering them<br>in the line and a lot of kids they need<br>to like hold a lantern and I it's so<br>fantastic to see beautiful kids with<br>their big smile at that evening so even<br>though it's very cold here but it's very<br>warm so it's interesting oh love it well<br>that sounds epic and now on to our last<br>Master student today TI<br>hi my name is Tia and I'm from Denmark I<br>study a master's degree in sustainable<br>business which is a course I couldn't<br>find at home What attracted me to otago<br>was a vacation me and my family had 15<br>years ago it was the nature and the<br>people that fascinated me which is why I<br>chose to come back here outside of<br>studies I do a lot of different sports I<br>love climbing I love batminton and I<br>love<br>swimming fantastic well welcome Tia<br>interested in sustainability and a lover<br>of the outdoors what a great combination<br>to be here in New Zealand yeah uh what<br>are some highlights her go-to spots in<br>the south island so I've just actually<br>been road tripping with my dad and we<br>went to Milford Sound and that was also<br>a place that we visited that many years<br>ago on my vacation uh that was really a<br>nice place um but I also really enjoy<br>queen toown and the nature around<br>Queenstown too so basically just the<br>west side of the country actually<br>nice Milford Sound is absolutely magical<br>it has one of the best memories of my<br>time here in New Zealand actually so I<br>agree with you on that one um well a<br>very warm welcome to our panel of<br>international students thank you so much<br>for joining us today uh here at the<br>University of ATO AO faka ihu Waka the<br>place of many<br>firsts yeah so brief intro about the<br>university if you don't know we are New<br>Zealand's first University um<br>established in 18 69 and you might<br>wonder well why is the first University<br>in the city of Denon this goes way back<br>to Gold Rush days the money was invested<br>into education and we have remained the<br>education capital of New Zealand for<br>over 150 years now wow well when we're<br>not only the first University of New<br>Zealand we were also voted the fifth<br>most beautiful campus which we're very<br>proud about um we're ranked in the top<br>1% of universities worldwide so you're<br>here uh for a good academic standing as<br>well and we're very proud that we ranked<br>top in New Zealand for academic<br>performance and that's thanks to<br>students like yourselves so<br>congratulations but we're very curious<br>to know there's a a range of different<br>reasons that might have brought you to a<br>tago but why did you choose a tago um<br>Joanna you mentioned that you started in<br>pathway uh so do you want to tell us a<br>little bit about your journey through<br>taga yeah so I had a lot of fun in<br>Pathways cuz um originally from<br>Indonesia you can't just come to<br>University you have to have like a<br>qualification so I went to Foundation<br>studies to complete that before going to<br>University but it was so much fun<br>because I had a lot of fun with my<br>friends and the teachers there were so<br>um interactive and the class spaces were<br>so small so it felt like a little tiny<br>class and we could all just talk and I<br>feel like yeah it was just such a fun<br>time nice and did you feel that you were<br>part of being a university of a Tagle<br>student and pathway yeah definitely I<br>feel like it's also like easier to<br>adjust to the university when I first<br>started foundation so I wasn't<br>completely in shocked with like the<br>school workor and everything but I feel<br>like it was just such a fun time in<br>general nice and another undergraduate s<br>what brought you to a tago um similar to<br>Joanna back home I I needed a<br>qualification before I actually entering<br>University so I did I did a um Canadian<br>pre-university program and but I always<br>wanted to study in New Zealand so with<br>that qualification I applied here too<br>and yeah I pretty much got it and one of<br>the reasons I also wanted to study in<br>New Zealand was cuz my parents came here<br>for their honeymoon once they got<br>married many many years ago so yeah it's<br>always a country I wanted to come to<br>seems to be a bit of a common theme you<br>know like your parents me honeymoon<br>you'd come here on a holiday beforehand<br>love it is that what brought you back to<br>AA yeah yeah it was it was that vacation<br>where you just got to see this amazing<br>country and meet the friendliest people<br>and then when I thought about doing my<br>masters I just chose to come back here<br>fantastic good to have you back yeah<br>great to have you back what about you L<br>yeah I come here just because of a video<br>cuz I still remember it was like a one<br>year ago cuz at that time I was I was<br>just in a difficult time cuz during the<br>the the co time a lot of Chinese people<br>they cannot get out of home so I just<br>have a habit to stay at home and at that<br>time I'm just lying in the bed and<br>scrolling through my phone and suddenly<br>I found a a video there was a video just<br>I still remember the the video was a<br>girl lying on the grass and there was<br>just a a river next to her there were<br>several docks just swimming in the<br>Stream it everything looks like so<br>peaceful and so quiet and at that time I<br>just think about why can I be like her<br>so at that time I just tried to learn<br>English and I tried to apply to this<br>school and finally when I came here and<br>when I work around our campers and I<br>found that the picture what I saw in the<br>video was totally in our Cloud Tower so<br>everything looks like wow it seems like<br>I work into my dream oh nice have you<br>come across the campus Ducks yes maybe<br>not the same ducks in<br>yeah so cute yeah so for those of you<br>who don't know we have ducks on<br>campus and it's a beautiful in spring<br>because they have their little ducklings<br>and they walk around and yeah a big a<br>big part of it so all very different<br>Journeys and that you've had here I<br>guess so you've walked into your dream<br>that's amazing and for the others is New<br>Zealand what you expected it to be from<br>you know your first thoughts I'm going<br>to start with you Joanna I feel like it<br>was more beautiful than what I imagined<br>cuz I knew coming here the nature was<br>going to be spectacular cuz that's what<br>I've heard from my mom and from everyone<br>else but I think coming here I never<br>expected the people to be so nice and<br>like welcoming it feels like a home away<br>from home I would say<br>nice s does it line up with your parents<br>honeymoon yeah um they did say it was it<br>was a very beautiful country and I took<br>their word for it but when I came here I<br>it was definitely more than I ever<br>imagined it would be it's just such a<br>beautiful country the people here are<br>amazing I've never once felt you know<br>discriminated or shied away from people<br>people are just really nice so yeah it's<br>amazing yeah now you hit a b Gap in<br>between your vacation with your family<br>and then returning back to study here<br>similar or yeah uh I would say it's like<br>they say it's definitely more beautiful<br>and uh because I was quite Young when I<br>was here on my vacation I couldn't<br>really speak English at that point so I<br>didn't really see how much uh how<br>friendly the people here actually are<br>but coming here is just been completely<br>amazing and so many friendly faces and<br>students that's just so easy to talk to<br>and the teachers are easy to talk to and<br>it's just amazing being here oh great to<br>hear lingling you mentioned that you saw<br>this video and it was all so peaceful is<br>it very different uh denan to your home<br>yes I think it's very different because<br>um actually just like uh what they<br>talked about every people here are so so<br>nice even though when you work by when<br>you metet a stranger people and they<br>will say hi to you so it's very actually<br>it's very strange when we metet in China<br>but here it's very yeah I think it's<br>very interesting and make me feel like<br>oh everybody seems like so nice and you<br>can be like make friends with them yes<br>so um your Indonesia and Joanna I also<br>get to spend quite a bit of time in<br>Jakarta and which has got a lot of<br>traffic the difference between that and<br>den well it's definitely was adjust an<br>adjustment at first because it was so<br>quiet here and it's like very I think<br>I'm very used to the bustling Town very<br>busy but I feel like it's so nice just<br>to be peaceful and like quiet here cuz I<br>feel like in Jakarta it's always like go<br>go go in here it's more like relaxed<br>it's like no pressure it's just such a<br>fun place to just be around I feel like<br>it's so peaceful everywhere and it's not<br>as busy but it's also like the students<br>like I'm surrounded with makes it more<br>fun and it feels like a like a big<br>Community this town feels like that yes<br>I was actually recently in Jakarta as<br>well and I remember thinking you know<br>what I will never complain about being<br>stuck in traffic for three minutes in<br>that's nothing y I feel you yeah and<br>difference between<br>Malaysia yeah the first thing I want to<br>say is the weather 100% cuz Malaysia's<br>at the equator it's we either only have<br>rain or it's just hot the whole year so<br>an average day would be like<br>34° and then it's like that throughout<br>most of the year and then when I came<br>here it was really cold even in the<br>summer when I first came I was like this<br>is not summer this is this is winter it<br>was really cold but yeah I think that<br>was probably the biggest change for me<br>coming from Malaysia yeah and have you<br>got used to it yeah I've definitely<br>gotten used to it this year last year<br>was I did struggle a bit last year with<br>the weather but I think I've definitely<br>ACC gotten accustomed to it now this<br>year yeah nice Anda you're from C<br>Denmark so weather similar yeah weather<br>is similar here is a little bit warmer<br>here than what I'm used to but the wind<br>is so cold out here uh so that I really<br>had to get used to yeah yeah we very<br>changeable weather that's for sure we've<br>got the Four Seasons in a day but we do<br>have the Four Seasons throughout the<br>year exactly right was there any other<br>crazy differences apart from weather and<br>just being a little<br>quieter anybody I feel like just the<br>nature I don't get a lot of nature from<br>where I'm from in Jakarta it's all just<br>like buildings and like it which is also<br>nice I feel like but I feel like the<br>nature just makes you feel peaceful it's<br>like I I don't know I could just sit<br>there for hours I feel like yeah nice<br>nice and speaking about traffic and<br>getting round uh how do you get around<br>denen I walk mostly actually same same I<br>mostly just walk anywhere so when we're<br>talking about walking cuz I know<br>especially in Jakarta people don't<br>really walk anywhere apart from shopping<br>malls I've discovered when you're<br>walking does it feel hard no not really<br>yeah yeah and is that because of the<br>distances you're walking or is it on<br>flat or I mean I'm used to quite flat<br>landscape from Copenhagen um but I'm<br>used to biking a lot in Copenhagen so<br>because I don't have a bike here I chose<br>to walk everywhere and it's just for me<br>it's just easier um mostly because of<br>I'm used to a bit more effective public<br>transport system um so for me it's it's<br>going to be the same amount of time<br>going to the bus waiting for the bus and<br>going where I want to than just walking<br>if it's just downtown anyway nice yeah<br>it's a very easily uh walkable city as<br>well because the campus and City Center<br>are on that flat part of denan it makes<br>it very easy but even the people that<br>get to live in the neighborhoods that<br>are a little bit more on the Hills that<br>giv such beautiful perspective on to the<br>peninsula so lucky for the ones on the<br>flat and Walkers um but yeah and if you<br>does any do any of you have a bike I<br>don't don't no yeah there's a couple of<br>places you can get secondhand bikes<br>around campus in fact uh on in town and<br>campus but on campus we have ta<br>the sustainability house where you can<br>pick up a secondhand bike and maybe try<br>out that um cycle way that's uh recently<br>been refurbished that connects Den need<br>to PTO Bell and port chers and you can<br>do a whole a whole little loop it's<br>great little weekend activity nice Mak<br>out of that so you've heard about us<br>being the student Capital which you know<br>because we're full of students great<br>student Vive but we're also the wildlife<br>capital of New Zealand which we have<br>touched on briefly with amazing access<br>to the outdoors in nature so we are<br>going to learn a little bit more of that<br>and a sneak peek of what denan has to<br>offer<br>fantastic scenery around denen beautiful<br>throughout all the seasons we could see<br>that incredible Wildlife have you been<br>lucky enough to spot some wildlife in<br>your time here yep I I've managed to see<br>some seals and some penguins this one<br>time last year actually me and a couple<br>of my friends who were here on Exchange<br>we actually went down to Allen's Beach<br>to look for the yelloweyed Penguins cuz<br>that's where they normally are rarest<br>penguin isn't it one Penguins yeah and<br>and it was dark when we were coming back<br>and something really funny happened we<br>didn't actually realize that there was a<br>steal behind us coming right at us so<br>dark yeah in the dark so that was a<br>really interesting experience Y and how<br>how did<br>you none of us were aware that there was<br>a steal behind us except one of my<br>friends and he kind of nudged at us<br>being guys do you see something behind<br>us like three times we all dismissed him<br>and then I turn my flash around and<br>there's this huge seal just coming right<br>at us so we all start running<br>away yeah yeah I have had a similar<br>experience in Allen's Beach um so our<br>Wildlife is protected we do have<br>to be 20 M away from them unless you<br>realize you're<br>not but they are beautiful and they are<br>all on our beaches right like yeah you<br>you can see them anywhere has anybody<br>been lucky enough to see Penguins yet no<br>I've got them okay soon yeah I'll give<br>you some top tips after this because the<br>Little Blues are amazing so yeah all<br>good on<br>that okay so we've talked about the<br>wildlife we've talked about outdoor<br>let's talk a little bit now about campus<br>and studying cuz that's probably what<br>most people want to listen to today so<br>Sid we're going to start with you again<br>because a I love that jacket and the<br>Anar experience but um you're obviously<br>doing energy science um very future<br>forward um degree so can you talk a<br>little bit about your leure size what<br>your labs are like and maybe your<br>tutorial groups to give people an idea<br>of of what it's like to study science in<br>New Zeal<br>yep so energy science I would say here<br>atago is a pretty it's a pretty small<br>classroom size has a pretty small<br>classroom size in first year however cuz<br>everyone does um similar papers so the<br>classes were huge I did um physics and<br>math papers which a lot of people will<br>take were taking and they had like 300<br>people 200 people and then this year now<br>that I'm in second year the classes have<br>gotten a lot smaller cuz there more<br>specialized papers with what you're<br>actually doing with your degree and so<br>when you say 300 that be 300 in a<br>lecture theater yes in a lecture theater<br>and then when it gets to tutorials and<br>practicals it's about maybe 20 to 30<br>people and you work in groups so then<br>you actually get to meet people yeah and<br>would you be with that same tutorial<br>group throughout the year for that P or<br>for that paper um you'd be with the same<br>people in the class but your groups get<br>mixed up each tutorial so you get to<br>meet different people fantastic so lots<br>of different ideas bouncing around yeah<br>and Joanna for you being um<br>undergraduate as well what sort of size<br>are your lures it's pretty big as well<br>cuz I would say psychology is a pretty<br>um big paper especially like sit set in<br>first year I feel like a lot of people<br>do take psych for like um interest<br>papers so I feel like it's really big<br>and we usually do it in the St David's<br>lecture which is huge it fits like<br>almost 500ish people so yeah it's really<br>it's really nice to see and like meet a<br>lot of different people there yeah yeah<br>and similar size tutorial classes same<br>yeah and when it comes to doing<br>assignments how do the assignments<br>work I think it's just pretty<br>straightforward they would give us all<br>the files and they would just tell us<br>what to do and what to put it in and<br>then we'll probably turn into turn it in<br>which is what the campus uses through<br>Blackboard I think everything's just<br>like organized in Blackboard so I feel<br>it's really easy to just get organized<br>with it and do you have a mix of um<br>exams group study papers do you have to<br>give<br>presentations yeah we do some of like<br>little bits of that I haven't done a<br>presentation for mine I don't know about<br>Sid maybe I haven't personally done a<br>presentation for mine but I have had<br>midterms before yeah and group like<br>group small group projects that<br>contribute to our final grade so yeah<br>yeah awesome okay postgrad yeah well any<br>differences uh from what we've just<br>heard in in terms of class sizes for the<br>postgrad students with us um well my<br>program is not that big um we're only I<br>think about 15 people uh on campus so<br>it's quite small uh and we don't have<br>any midterms exams so we only have<br>assignments and group projects and stuff<br>like this um yeah so it's just a lot<br>smaller a lot more intimate it's not<br>really lectur Halls it's just smaller<br>classrooms and we sit there together<br>have a lot of discussions and stuff<br>fantastic and a big mix of students<br>within that different background<br>especially in mine we are quite a lot of<br>international students I think we're<br>only three in New Zealand um students<br>actually and the rest is international<br>in some way um so we're wide range of<br>people fantastic and langing Lang what<br>about your postgrad studies yeah now our<br>department is not too big so usually in<br>our class is only like four to five<br>students so every class you need to pay<br>attention to what professor's talking<br>because you may have no idea he will<br>what questions he will answer you so<br>yeah every class we need to like you<br>know um 3 hours for one class for one<br>paper so you need to pay attention for<br>three hours long time yeah but but I<br>think the class itself is very<br>interesting because um my English is now<br>very Weare so every um every time when I<br>on my class and the professor he will<br>just take care of me and other<br>classmates they will take care of me and<br>they can speak in a very clear way and a<br>slow way so yeah it's very good<br>fantastic so from an undergrad<br>perspective we talked about the big<br>lures the smaller tutorials what about<br>um when you're doing your lab stuff and<br>your experiments share a little bit<br>about that yeah for for me cuz I have a<br>lot of labs cuz it's a science degree so<br>in our Labs it's about maybe a quarter<br>of the class so like maybe 10 people so<br>then we each get into groups of two and<br>we have to work on a really long<br>experiment last semester my labs were 4<br>hours long so they run pretty long and<br>we do multiple experiments in one lab um<br>time frame so it's not just one but I<br>would say you don't really feel the time<br>pass by cuz you're actually having so<br>much fun doing the experiments and get<br>really fun to do yeah I was going to ask<br>actually does it feel like 4 hours or is<br>it not really to be honest yeah it<br>doesn't really feel like four hours you<br>do get a break in four hours though<br>right um no I mean while we're waiting<br>for the experiment to happen I guess<br>yeah what about you J yeah I would say I<br>don't have a lot of labs cuz um<br>psychology is more like experiments so<br>we would just go to an experiment room<br>and then we would do experiments in the<br>computer or in the labs and it's just so<br>much fun because it's just a few like<br>little experiments like past experiments<br>and we get to be part of that which is<br>really fun I think it's like taking a<br>break from just like listening I feel<br>like in lectures it does get a little<br>bit like I don't know I feel like if<br>it's just like an an hour or two I feel<br>like the labs are like okay and it's<br>just very fun to just have a I don't<br>know just have fun with your friends so<br>you're experimenting on yourself uh no<br>not not like other<br>classmates something like that no but<br>it's great that you can complement that<br>theoretical delivery with a very<br>Hands-On learning as well um<br>fantastic and for you te with your<br>postgraduate um studies obviously<br>there's a lot of listening to do and<br>you've got but do you have um more sort<br>of Hands-On learning yeah so for example<br>in one of our papers uh we did a carbon<br>footprint for some local businesses<br>actually uh so we got into some groups<br>and we did all the calculations and<br>mitigation strategies and set targets<br>for them and we were uh communicating<br>with these businesses throughout the<br>whole process and that was actually<br>really exciting to Fantastic helped them<br>actually get this so that was pretty<br>cool so you're working with business on<br>real life projects yeah wonderful and<br>that's great things for your curriculum<br>as well because then when it comes to<br>looking for job opportunities the fact<br>that you've already had that um kind of<br>client experience and and working with<br>companies is fantastic too yeah so<br>that's pretty much I guess what<br>classroom life looks like is there<br>anything else that anybody wanted to<br>share or give some insight in um what<br>about uh what are your teaching staff<br>like are they I mean would you call them<br>by their first name<br>can you talk to them outside class hours<br>how how how is that structured I would<br>say mine is pretty informal so we go by<br>first name basis and it's just it's<br>really easy to talk to them or if you<br>say some something a little bit wrong<br>maybe in class it's like oh it's all<br>fine and we'll<br>just move over and it's it's really<br>really nice actually because it it feels<br>like you're more there with a a lecture<br>who's in your eye level so instead of<br>actually being very and you have a<br>teacher that's like oh you have to call<br>them by a last name and you have to put<br>up your hand here in my classes at least<br>we we do a lot of discussions and we<br>just sit in a big group and just have<br>fun nice Ling Ling that sounded similar<br>to you the way that your postgrad Works<br>yes and I just want to uh share you one<br>thing cuz cuz um postgraduate class is<br>very long um usually two or three hours<br>for one class but we have a tea time and<br>every yeah so I I just remember this<br>master one of my professor he just<br>encouraged we to be like some leader be<br>the tea time you so you can organize<br>what you want to show your classmates in<br>the tea time so I prepared to bring some<br>Chinese snacks during the tea time yeah<br>I think it's it's a a great break time<br>to communicate with my classmates yeah<br>oh fantastic I share your culture too<br>but bust the Miss do you actually have<br>absolutely what we do Joanna what about<br>your um academic staff at an<br>undergraduate level yeah I feel like<br>it's really nice that we also have like<br>class reps as well which I don't see a<br>lot in like a lot of universities it's<br>basically just a student who's<br>representing all of us and they would<br>get in touch with the professors or the<br>teaching staff more formally and that I<br>feel that's just nice to have someone to<br>talk to or to just come to if you have<br>any problems so yeah I really enjoy that<br>yeah similar with Jonah we have the<br>class reps and then I also have lab<br>demonstrators who are with us throughout<br>the semester at our tutorials and labs<br>and yeah we're on first name basis as<br>well and they seem and they feel more<br>like a student so they're always there<br>to help you and they're just super nice<br>and don't yeah fantastic and have um<br>either have you done the P assisted<br>learning a to yeah I did yeah I did that<br>in first year for my geography paper so<br>what it basically was uh was a<br>third-year student who had already done<br>the paper and excelled in it was<br>basically um helping you with just like<br>a few extra hours of um notes and how to<br>prepare for exams yeah that's basically<br>so lots of support there academically<br>other students as well oh that's that's<br>um great to hear so we've talked about<br>the academic side of things have um I<br>anybody used or maybe not might be too<br>early the Career Development Center or<br>unic crew or any of the other Support<br>Services<br>Librarians I've used the career<br>development crew actually the other day<br>um they held a photo booth for your<br>LinkedIn profile and a drop in review<br>for your LinkedIn profile so that was<br>actually pretty nice just to have a<br>second eye on your profile and see where<br>I can actually improve it because I am<br>done in February so I will have to look<br>for a job afterwards<br>and they host just a a whole bunch of<br>events throughout the year for um<br>graduate employability and bringing<br>employers on campus so they've got cool<br>Expos that you should keep an eye on to<br>great team yeah there's a lot of stuff<br>there whether you're undergrad or not<br>and I think we talked earlier about<br>internship so they can help with<br>internship and profiling as well for<br>sure I'm really curious because I saw<br>from your video Janna that your love for<br>for study spaces um tell us a little bit<br>more about your favorite study spots<br>around campus I feel like uh the Central<br>Library of just gives a lot of like<br>space for us to just have um we have<br>like groups of like rooms so like we can<br>talk if you want to do group work or we<br>can just if you want to be isolated we<br>have like those little boxes the green<br>ones which I'm sure everyone has seen I<br>feel like that's my favorite tell a<br>story about the green B go ahead so the<br>central libraries architecturally<br>designed the big um silver roof space<br>that's actually based on the albatross<br>ws and the little green boxes are<br>penguin Nooks that is so cute go the<br>same<br>reaction n nature comes into our library<br>as well and the white stone is B on raru<br>White Stone so very local flavor to it<br>because our our Central Library is quite<br>big right it's like five stories high um<br>do but it doesn't feel big does it it<br>yeah and has anybody else used any of<br>the other libraries that we have around<br>campus yeah um not the library but the<br>mar study center um opposite Caroline<br>Freeman the college yeah that's one of<br>my favorite go-to places during exam<br>season cuz it's not a very busy spot I<br>feel like not many students go there so<br>and they have really good hot chocolate<br>there for when they're studying I used<br>to go there too that is a good TP the<br>hot chocolate yeah nice and anybody else<br>use any other libraries I go to the<br>otaco business school because I am a<br>business student and um like just like<br>your library your place it's it's a<br>little bit more quiet and it's not that<br>many spots but it's really nice once you<br>get a spot there um just to sit and have<br>a actually a really beautiful view at<br>the same time too yeah nice we got<br>incredible facilities at the university<br>the libraries are a great example but um<br>just in general throughout campus I<br>invite everyone to have a quick look<br>as we saw fantastic spaces a bit of the<br>old the historical the new and<br>Innovative I also spotted uni Pole now<br>that's our Center for<br>recreation and for all of you that are<br>um interested in getting active uh I<br>wonder are you involved in any sports or<br>any group activities at UNO I do a lot<br>of uh different sports actually I do uh<br>batmon here with one of the clubs and I<br>do climbing in the octagon and also a<br>little bit of swimming too so do use the<br>unipole quite a lot too yeah nice and<br>how far is unipole from campus not that<br>far I think it takes me 10 minutes to<br>walk 10 minute walk minut walk very<br>accessible yeah who else uses unipole<br>Tia obviously big<br>user I mean I use it occasionally to go<br>to the gym and then sometimes I play Bon<br>with my friends as well so it's really<br>fun yeah I also use um the they unipol<br>has like little stuff that they can like<br>offer so like we can like borrow it for<br>the day and I've used the body board if<br>that's what it's<br>called yeah which is so fun I could have<br>I bought it to the beach with my friends<br>and we played there a lot and then we<br>brought it back to unipo so it's great<br>to have that yeah<br>opportunity have you made it D there yes<br>I like to play B me there<br>yes popular really like bedon as well<br>yeah and it's not a big New Zealand<br>sport that's that's the interesting<br>thing and that's the beautiful thing<br>about you all being here is you bring<br>that flavor into unipo and you bring<br>probably the most played badmington<br>facility I think with you all there um<br>I've also used uro too I love the fact<br>that it's over sort of three to four<br>levels and there's so many different<br>sports that you can do there from the<br>super competitive to The Not So<br>competitive um and tia I know that you<br>are teaching swimming right right so on<br>the on the subject of competitive sport<br>because we have social as well or fun<br>sport what um what's your swim crew like<br>so we teach competitive swimming and we<br>teach up in Moana pool and we do I think<br>our youngest are probably around seven<br>eight year olds and then we have all the<br>way up to young adults and we also have<br>different levels for example we do have<br>the Olympic team going um to compete in<br>a couple of days actually have they left<br>to go to Paris yet<br>they had to adjust to the time zone<br>difference so you've got Olympians<br>training our pool so I mean I guess<br>that's it you can be any standard here<br>in any sort of sport and you can get<br>involved in it so and Moana pool's a big<br>it's got diving and you got everything<br>up there it's really nice fantastic so<br>it's pretty much anything that you want<br>to get involved in I guess I've even had<br>a yoga stretch in there oh yeah nice<br>Yeah by body boarding surf I mean we<br>have a really popular surfing Beach St<br>Clair right here in dened but we have<br>like 24 beaches around denen um some<br>better for surf some others for wildlife<br>watching um but I'm so glad that you<br>mentioned that rental center because<br>it's a great opportunity for students to<br>get access to the outdoors if they want<br>to go tramping with a tramping club and<br>they want to um do one of the great<br>walks and stay over stay on one of the<br>Huts you can rent your tent your<br>sleeping bag you can do mountain bike<br>riding you can do so much um through the<br>rental centers so that's really awesome<br>and that kind of ties in as well to the<br>clubs and socks because you mentioned<br>that you're put of a couple of clubs do<br>you want to tell us a little bit about<br>what you're involved in um with<br>OA uh so I play batminton with the with<br>the club and I'm also in the tramping<br>Club of course and then I recently just<br>joined the photography club as well so<br>I'm part of three different clubs so Tia<br>has really adapted to New Zealand and<br>already calling it trampin so for<br>anybody who doesn't know tramping is<br>hiking so just to clear that up and it's<br>a strange word that we have um in New<br>Zealand and so yeah tramping Club<br>fantastic and how about you said yeah<br>I've joined a bunch I'm in a lot of<br>different Multicultural clubs I'm in the<br>Malaysia Club Singapore Indonesia<br>international student one and I'm also<br>in the tramping Club going for my first<br> this week so that should be fun<br>exciting do you know where you're off to<br>oh we're going to W oh one of my<br>favorite places in New Zealand<br>so you're really going a field as well<br>it's not even in within denan that's so<br>cool fantastic and Joanna how about you<br>yeah I feel like it's similar to s i do<br>I am part of the Indonesian Community<br>the PPI we call it here and I'm also<br>looking forward to joining a lot of<br>other clubs like the dance club maybe or<br>we'll see next semester yeah nice I<br>joined the Chinese students club and<br>animation<br>Club animation tell us more what happens<br>animation Club yes that is a club we<br>have a lot of free<br>food yes and you can just Gathering a<br>lot of um different people they're so<br>cute who found off animation and we are<br>just sitting in the room and we are<br>closing the curtain close the light and<br>watch the animation together it's so<br>interesting with some delicious food yes<br>love it I love it so there a great<br>opportunity not only to create a<br>community make friends but I guess also<br>if you're in culture clubs to speak your<br>mother tongue as well yeah nice<br>Definitely and do you celebrate um any<br>days of significance at all in the<br>cultural clubs would you have do you<br>celebrate Indonesian Independence Day<br>yeah definitely we do that on the 17th<br>of August sometimes when it's not um on<br>the weekends or anything we do it before<br>or after but yeah it's a big celebration<br>here in campus we usually do at the link<br>or somewhere near there and then it's<br>just like a lot of people who can come<br>and learn about our culture which is<br>just really nice yeah oh very cool yeah<br>similar to the Malaysia Club as well we<br>have our Independence Day Celebrations<br>as well in August so yeah that's a<br>really fun event that we have I think I<br>saw a bit of Holly and um yeah your<br>video yeah that one was for the Indian<br>Student Association yeah that was really<br>fun basically everyone just throwing<br>colors and yeah yeah just like a whole<br>tie-dye we saw a little bit in your<br>video yeah it was in the video yeah yeah<br>yeah yeah I filing Scottish originally<br>and do you celebrate Danish day Denmark<br>day there's actually not that many Danes<br>here yeah this semester I found out<br>that's a bit more because this is<br>usually the time of year that the<br>exchange are um but I've only met a<br>couple of other Dan so not really a lot<br>of Scandinavians though and that's close<br>enough so celebrate that too and<br>anything with China do you have a day<br>that you celebrate yeah cuz September we<br>have a mid Autumn fast<br>and I just heard we going to have we<br>going to have a a music concert to<br>celebrate that yes maybe a lot of people<br>they just sing some Chinese song and to<br>make some moon cake to celebrate that<br>day yes more food amazing love and we<br>saw just a snippet of the denan Chinese<br>gardens uh that are here in the city the<br>Chinese New Year is quite something to<br>experience in Den in the fireworks are<br>spectacular even more so than than the<br>New Year's Eve that is at the end of the<br>year so yeah yeah lots of different<br>things so clubs and societ is obviously<br>a big part of your life how do you<br>balance your academic as well as your<br>you know thing extracurricular<br>activities that you do how do how do you<br>find that works um for you I do um kind<br>of intervals of studying because I'm not<br>really good at sitting down and study<br>for8 hours a day so I usually get up a<br>little bit early in the morning and then<br>I start studying and then I have a break<br>around 10: maybe do a little bit of<br>sports then I come back to the studies<br>and then i' go forth like that all day<br>so that works for me at least that's<br>fantastic we'll just go along the sofa<br>for for me personally I tend to study<br>more on the on the weekdays and then I<br>just don't study completely on the<br>weekends so like on the weekdays mostly<br>if I finish a lecture I go to the<br>library do my notes finish up<br>assignments and then yeah pretty much go<br>home a little bit more studying and then<br>yeah it's about it cuz I guess you're<br>not in class 9 to five yeah definitely<br>yeah we have breaks a lot of breaks in<br>between so I have my lunches you know<br>yeah some friends in between and then<br>catch up on my work elect your notes<br>yeah nice yeah I think similar to St I<br>just don't really procrastinate on the<br>weekdays I try not to so I can have a<br>lot of free time on the weekend and do I<br>can go out and everything and it's just<br>I feel like just to be mindful of what<br>your priorities are and that's that<br>works for me yeah how about you l l for<br>me every Wednesday I don't have any<br>class so Wednesday seems like a mid<br>break for me yes so lastday I just um be<br>with my friends we went to the St Clair<br>yes and to see the sunrise there oh<br>fantastic um so St Clair is one of our<br>local beaches right it's a what we class<br>is our city beach and what 15 20 minutes<br>from campus yes it's not far away we can<br>even take a bus to go there<br>and there are sea lines there too and I<br>have known for the seals to like get in<br>with the Surfers sometimes yeah at the<br>surf competition they made a<br>debut so wildlife in our city beaches as<br>well um with where you live do you find<br>that easier because you are quite close<br>to campus that it gives you that extra<br>time to get involved in activities and<br>studies how do you find that so I live<br>in a UNIF flat so I live right on<br>cumland street it's 2 minutes away from<br>the central library and 5 minutes away<br>from the business school so I couldn't<br>be more happy about my choice nice yeah<br>I live in a private flat on great King<br>Street like a s minute walk in and out<br>of Campus seven whole minutes yeah seven<br>whole<br>minutes yeah it's pretty fast in and up<br>yeah I have a huge yeah I think it's pry<br>similar to S cuz we do live close to<br>each other yeah I I live just in front<br>of the dairy just in Cumberland just<br>like the and yeah it's just a seven<br>minute 10 minute walk to campus it's<br>great fantastic seems like I lived in<br>far away from school I live in the<br>private apartment but actually it just<br>takes me 15 minutes to go to school yes<br>far away but just yeah yeah yeah far<br>away from you guys but yeah it's very<br>comfortable to stay there is not far<br>away from nor school and 15 perfect CU I<br>can listen to some podcast and just work<br>there every time is yes perfect nice<br>fantastic so we've talked a bit about<br>campus and all the facilities that we<br>have um I guess a little bit more about<br>Denon in the city itself um how what do<br>you enjoy about the city so I've got a<br>favorite my the Saturday morning Farmers<br>Market hands down what about you<br>guys I would say the farmers Mark is<br>also really really just like a little<br>like small cute like get Gathering I<br>feel like it just feels like that cuz<br>it's just like a little like small shops<br>and it's all very like unique in its own<br>way when I first got here I feel like<br>that that was my first goal just to go<br>to the farmers market just to see the<br>little cute shops and yeah they have<br>great food too yeah yeah yeah I<br>definitely say this in the Farmers<br>Market they have really good pastries<br>and coffee and I also love going to town<br>with my some of my friends on the<br>weekends you know we just go have some<br>fun yeah just let some steam yeah from<br>studies it's good yeah nice I really<br>like the art gallery actually because<br>I've never made it to the farmers market<br>because I don't really get up that early<br>in the morning apparently it's open to D<br>yeah bad excuses I know um but actually<br>at the rail station there's also an art<br>gallery and it's really really nice so I<br>like to go through stuff like that too<br>yeah nice yeah I like new<br>world again it's the fot thing coming<br>through light and clear yes and you know<br>what every day after after 8:00 p.m. and<br>you can bot a lot of discount bread<br>there after 8:00 p.m. yes top<br>TPS and on the topic of food because<br>denan does have a lot of uh<br>International Food offerings in terms of<br>the restaurants and food retailers um is<br>there a go-to place that you really<br>enjoyed going to in town I mean I have<br>one it's called mom's chicken which is<br>like Korean Fried Chicken really good um<br>it was a really bad habit for me cuz I<br>used to go there all the time last year<br>all my money goes to mom's<br>chicken<br>yeah I have one that's called the two<br>fat Indians and I really like that one<br>too um a little more expensive so I<br>don't spend all my money there but I<br>really like it for now and then really<br>nice I go to Mela erer just in the<br>Octagon they have two spots actually one<br>in George Street I believe and one in<br>octagon and it's also really good I<br>would recommend trying the chicken<br>birani ah they're the one who do the<br>Momos as well right yes really good<br>those yeah I would recommend Impressions<br>have you<br>been still haven't been there I tried<br>the chesan pepper<br>chicken yeah even though my classmates<br>they are just born here they know that<br>place and they recommend that place it's<br>a Chinese food restaurant but a lot of<br>local people they prefer to go there<br>yeah so lots of different options yeah<br>nice<br>okay other things in the city so we've<br>got we've talked about Chinese gardens<br>which I think a couple of you have<br>visited um the stadium that's right next<br>door to unipole so we have the largest<br>um fully covered stadium in the southern<br>hemisphere at present and has anybody<br>been seen anything at the stadium I<br>watched a rugby play one time which is<br>my first rugby game I've never I didn't<br>know how they played rugby so I was like<br>confused the whole time I was like<br>learning while I was watching but it was<br>really really fun cuz there's like a lot<br>of people there and like cheering you<br>can feel the energy just like really<br>good so yeah so we've just had the All<br>Blacks play so if anybody is thinking<br>about and who loves rugby um the stadium<br>is what 10 minute walk from campus<br>really good way to go down there and I<br>think you said yeah um last year I got<br>opportunity to go for the women's FIFA<br>World Cup which was the stadium as well<br>so that was really nice yeah yeah it was<br>a pretty epic time yeah for Den needing<br>to host people woms was amazing lots of<br>different nationalities around it was<br>excellent and much like the likes of<br>pink who came to do a a concert here<br>recently did you notice like the change<br>of the landscape in the city<br>when it was pretty cool yeah yeah yeah<br>yeah same in an All Blacks game on it's<br>pretty pretty amazing oh if you get the<br>chance to see the old blacks and and<br>that hack at the beginning it's<br>definitely a memory worth keeping yeah<br>so you guys are here for a bit longer so<br>keep that keep that maybe next time<br>around for your rugby game find a kiwi<br>to explain it to you I have to ask my<br>husband I'm like how are they doing the<br>work all righty your favorite<br>subject thrifting<br>thrifting I am very big on secondhand<br>shopping thrifting charity shopping it's<br>known for a number of things uh but<br>denan uh having so many students and<br>being such a lively student city has so<br>much on offer when it comes to<br>secondhand I mean we have one on canvas<br>I mentioned it before with a secondhand<br>bikes teaka um that's our thrift shop<br>right on campus where you can get um<br>secondhand goods for literally next to<br>nothing but really really amazing finds<br>whenever I get complimented on something<br>it's like<br>secondhand do any of you like uh<br>shopping and yeah actually love<br>thrifting as well my favorite one's<br>probably Static Age on on George Street<br>that one's really cool they have some<br>really cool finds in there yeah<br>really cool pieces I go to the shop on<br>Carol actually I really like that one<br>usually also with stuff to donate if I<br>I've had aot lot of books that I read<br>and didn't want to keep so just go down<br>there and I always end up buying<br>something when I'm supposed to just be<br>donating so frustrating but so<br>marless is um thrifting something big<br>from your home countries it is I feel<br>like in Indonesia but it's not as I feel<br>it's not as big there cuz the thrift<br>thing there is more like vintage<br>shopping so it's a bit more expensive so<br>when I came here I was like yeah like<br>the thrift thing here is like really<br>good and then like tea like I heard like<br>you could just trade also so it's not if<br>you have something that you don't wear<br>often but it's still in good shape you<br>can trade it for something that you<br>would want in the shop and I feel that's<br>really good to just let out your second<br>hand yeah yes I I just like to go to<br>that Second Hand Shop cuz sometimes I<br>can found some old machines yeah I can<br>feel like it what people lived here in<br>old times yes it's just so romantic when<br>I go into the<br>second that was great so um we've got<br>some uh questions coming through from<br>our audience thank you very much<br>everybody um for sharing those through<br>so one is about accommodation so I'm<br>Joanna I'm going to start with you<br>because you started with Homestay when<br>when you did um Your Foundation program<br>how did you find your home stay it was<br>incredible cuz um I had a New Zealand<br>like a kiwi family and they helped me<br>adjust to when I first moved in so they<br>helped me get get around the city like<br>with the bus and they would take me to<br>spots that I've never been to before and<br>they're just really welcoming it feels<br>like a home away from home yeah so I<br>would definitely recommend if you're<br>just starting out and you don't know<br>which accommodation to start with I feel<br>like home is such a big option yeah nice<br>and then after that you moved into<br>Residential College yeah so residential<br>colle we call them residential colleges<br>at a tago um I guess from your home<br>count you might know them as hostels or<br>dorms or um Halls of residents um were<br>you in a residential College as well S I<br>was in a UNIF flat you're in a UNIF flat<br>we'll touch on UNIF flat a second so<br>we'll just talk about the Residential<br>College what was the difference with<br>that and Homestay it was very different<br>because it um in a residential College<br>you're more like living with friends and<br>I feel like it's so cute such a big like<br>a big sleepover every day like you're<br>like with your friends every day and<br>it's like you meet people who are the<br>same as you cuz I feel like in Homestead<br>I didn't really get to do that cuz I was<br>more um into with my f with my family<br>which is nice but I don't get to share<br>the same experiences I do with people my<br>age and I feel like it's such a good way<br>if you're just starting out and like<br>finding friends yeah and I feel like I<br>love the food there the facilities was<br>amazing so yeah yeah so fully catered<br>then three meals a day yeah perfect food<br>was good food was good yeah excellent<br>you would go back for all your meals oh<br>yeah I would<br>say a apart from the favorite restaurant<br>you know cuz that's obviously important<br>what sort of activities did they do they<br>have a lot of like weekly activities so<br>I think one time they I didn't go cuz I<br>was sick but they had like a camping<br>trip and then they also had like sports<br>day like Fashion Week fashion like run<br>way day and then like even like small<br>small things like coloring painting in<br>like the dining room dining area<br>whatever you want to chill or like I<br>feel like during exams is a very big<br>time where the colleges would have<br>events so we could just wind unwind and<br>like when we're feeling stress just go<br>down to the dining room and then there's<br>a whole bunch of activities to do and I<br>feel that's really nice fantastic so<br>you're in Residential College where are<br>you now I'm in a private flat in<br>Cumberland yeah and did you move out<br>with friends<br>yep I I had one friend and then I had<br>another the friend of a friend and it<br>was a pretty pretty smooth process I<br>feel like we found the flat from<br>Facebook Marketplace which is which is<br>nice yeah like didn't even go to<br>Facebook Marketplace isn't it yeah yeah<br>so yeah it's really nice cool awesome p<br>and Sid was UNIF flats and tia your UNIF<br>Flats as well yeah so do you want to let<br>people know what UNIF flats are like<br>yeah so I was in a UNIF flat the whole<br>of last year and I had a kiwi host who's<br>basically a kiwi who helps you sell in<br>and shows you're around the need in all<br>the Kiwi tips and tricks yeah it was a<br>really fun experience for me because a<br>lot of the students that actually stay<br>in um uni flats are all students on<br>Exchange so you get to meet people from<br>literally all walks of life you know<br>from America from Europe so it's yeah<br>it's really good and they always host<br>lots of events so you actually get to<br>look go for sausage sizzles which was<br>really fun nice did you pick up some<br>good cooking trip um<br>that Tia what about your UNIF
