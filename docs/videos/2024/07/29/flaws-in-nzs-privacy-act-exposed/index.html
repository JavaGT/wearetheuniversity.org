Associate Professor Gehan Gunasekara examines New Zealand's approach to data sovereignty and highlights flaws in the Privacy Act 2020, particularly regarding accountability and the use of anonymised data. Gunasekara calls for legislative reforms, including encrypted data storage by local trustees to better protect Kiwis' personal information and modernise privacy regulations.</p><h2>Transcript</h2><p style="opacity: 0.9; font-size: 0.8em">Transcripts may be automatically generated and may not be 100% accurate.</p><p>data sovereignty means different things<br>to different people the easiest way to<br>explain it is people used to think the<br>internet cyber was something that was<br>off limits and anything goes people can<br>operate there free of all laws and<br>regulations now data sovereignty is<br>people saying no that's not the case we<br>want to have control over what happens<br>data sovereignty is tricky because<br>control over a physical space is easy<br>governments obviously can control their<br>territory and in theory government can<br>control what happens in the cyberspace<br>within their territory and where data is<br>held on their territory but<br>unfortunately data doesn't stay in one<br>territory data can flow at the speed of<br>light right right around the world well<br>we probably all use the cloud at some<br>point for example um Microsoft 365 is an<br>example of a cloud provider uh Dropbox<br>Google docks all of those are Cloud<br>providers but where is that data<br>actually stored it's probably not in New<br>Zealand it's probably in those companies<br>servers maybe in Australia maybe even<br>further a field so what I've done in my<br>work is to look at how New Zealand's<br>legal infrastructure fits in with the<br>technological infrastructure and those<br>two things I found did not actually<br>match up very well uh the law is always<br>behind technology but leaving that aside<br>I don't think the designers of our law<br>really thought through some of the<br>implications the the Privacy Act is is<br>weak because it makes a distinction<br>between agency a and agency B so if<br>agency a gives agency B information to<br>process uh for on its behalf agency a is<br>supposed to be holding the information<br>not agency B that gives agency B A get<br>out of jail card and and the worry there<br>is that these companies that are<br>supposedly just holding the information<br>for somebody else could in the<br>background quietly be using that data to<br>train their algorithms and do analytics<br>on and a whole lot of things beyond the<br>original brief and there's no<br>accountability or safeguards for that<br>other than the contract between the two<br>agencies and there's nothing in the law<br>requiring there be there to be<br>safeguards large agencies large<br>companies and even government dep<br>departments use cloud providers and<br>often these Cloud providers are<br>providing the services uh on Shore in<br>other words in New Zealand to make sure<br>that the data doesn't leave New Zealand<br>um but even that is problematic because<br>those those companies providing the<br>services uh their employees have access<br>to that data and if they're owned by<br>Foreign uh company it's the foreign<br>company's government might still ask<br>them for access to that so just because<br>the data is stored in New Zealand<br>doesn't mean it cannot be accessed from<br>outside of New Zealand and that is that<br>is a concern when you have sensitive</p></main><footer style="margin-top: 2rem; background: #0001; padding: 2rem; text-align: center;"><p>We Are The University</p><ul style="list-style-type: none; padding: 0; margin: 0;"><li><a href="/">Home</a></li><li><a href="/about">About</a></li><li><a href="/contact">Contact</a></li></ul></footer></body></html>
