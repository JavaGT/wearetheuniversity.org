What knowledge we make and how we translate it are pivotal to the worlds we might make. That is why the public university is so important. A fierce critic of many of its directions of travel but an ever-hopeful defender of its possibilities, in this talk Nick argues that it must be fought for. The lecture traces a journey from fresh-faced immigrant to transdisciplinary scholar and committed citizen of the University of Auckland. Making meaning of what has been as much a privileged and fun-filled wandering as a career pathway, the talk is anchored to three current preoccupations: the demise of political economy and Geography in New Zealand; the rise of an anaemic conception of transdisciplinarity; and the rentierism of the current government. He reads these trends against the backdrop of challenges to the university from the position of a political economist and geographer within a Science Faculty. Much is to be made from this position of what it means to be labelled a social scientist. Much is to be done to fashion a future for Geography.<br><br>Nick Lewis is a geographer with broad research interests that consolidate around questions of political economy. Nick grew up in Britain, Kenya, Taranaki and Mangaia. He arrived at the University of Auckland in 1982 and apart from an extended OE has been there ever since. He completed degrees in Anthropology, Economics and Geography and an MA and PhD in Geography. He has studied small island, rural and regional development, neoliberal reform in New Zealand schooling, the restructuring of universities, and the making of wine, agrifood, and blue economies. His scholarship is international, cross-disciplinary, and impact-focused. Once an athlete and a footballer, Nick now shuffles across campus in a way his students claim is distinctive, and his children diagnose courtesy of Dr Google as ‘multi-dimensional decay’.</p><h2>Transcript</h2><p style="opacity: 0.9; font-size: 0.8em">Transcripts may be automatically generated and may not be 100% accurate.</p><p>tenot tenot tenot Kor my name is Robin<br>Kerns it's my honor to be head of the<br>school of environment and it's my very<br>particular honor this evening to be<br>asked to introduce my colleague and I<br>underline the word Professor Nicholas<br>Lewis<br>just like to begin by saying I don't<br>think I've been to a an inaugural<br>lecture where I've seen so many people<br>hugging each<br>other and I think that just sort of<br>represents the fact that Nick is someone<br>who brings people together in a<br>community of not just scholarship but<br>Mutual regard and I've seen people this<br>evening I haven't seen for quite some<br>time from various parts of the<br>University where we don't usually get to<br>see each other because we're so busy<br>with our feet under our discs sort of<br>staring down the screen doing things<br>that we really shouldn't need to be<br>doing that was a little bit flippant<br>wasn't<br>it but we're here this evening to<br>celebrate the achievements of my<br>very valued and and uh dear colleague<br>and friend<br>Nick so um there's a couple of<br>particular reasons why I find it a great<br>honor that uh the dean who sends<br>apologies as does Professor Richard<br>learon one of Nick's friends and mentors<br>uh was a particular reason why I feel<br>very honored to be asked to do this<br>introduction um one is that more so than<br>probably any other inaugural lecture<br>that I've attended or<br>introduced um I go further back with<br>Nick deep into the days of the geography<br>Department across the road when it was<br>based in the human science<br>building and Nick like myself is someone<br>who considers themselves first and<br>foremost a<br>geographer not a social<br>scientist only if you're really<br>oppressed by the census or<br>something and uh I guess the the second<br>uh reason why I'm very particularly<br>grateful to be offered this opportunity<br>to introduce Nick is that Nick is<br>someone who whose scholarship in way of<br>being in the world and being in the<br>University<br>probably more so than any of my<br>colleagues uh gives great uh Fidelity<br>and honor to the uh aspect of the<br>Education Act that says we are to be<br>critics and conscience of society and in<br>Nick's case as you'll probably hear this<br>evening his critic and conscience role<br>is not just someone not just a a vantage<br>point directed out into the world but<br>it's one that's directed into the world<br>of the University itself<br>so Nick has<br>traversed I was going to say terrains<br>but it involves the Marine World as well<br>doesn't it so I'm at a loss for the<br>descriptor but Nick has in his research<br>traversed worlds ranging from more<br>recently the high seas through to<br>Fashion wine<br>man and that's really impressive you<br>know I guess as a fellow Shameless<br>eclectic I think that that's really part<br>of what we need to respond to in the<br>vocation of being a geographer to be<br>attentive to this world and to be<br>constructively critical of the world<br>that we're in in the quest that we may<br>somehow contribute to a better world so<br>Nick it's my honor to be introducing you<br>I look forward to your comments and Nick<br>did say that he has um so much to say<br>and we do need to be out of here by uh<br>6:45 that there will be no<br>questions any any questions any<br>questions Nick tells me can be raised<br>over a beer at galra's<br>afterwards so over to you Professor<br>Nicholas<br>Lewis thanks Robin for your introduction<br>home uh and thank you all for<br>coming we are the university and it's an<br>honor to address<br>you I've had a haircut and all uh but to<br>those who who drink regularly in the Old<br>Government house uh sorry no fusty<br>butterscotch colored corduroy geography<br>teacher Chic for you tonight to quote<br>the guardian<br>we should all really be somewhere else I<br>feel uh getting<br>trollied and Slam Dancing perhaps on the<br>ruins of Peter the's<br>Bunker this may go on uh unfortunately<br>as Robin suggests until the hour is up<br>um I do apologize for any concepts that<br>get butchered and seem in places uh the<br>account will seem in places to be an US<br>versus them one which is not my intent<br>but probably my words uh but it is my<br>that I arrived in Oakland from the<br>Pacific in February 1982 I'd never<br>previously lived in a city in my bag<br>with three t-shirts an island print<br>dress shirt green corduroy flares for<br>the winter a pair of Nike Elite running<br>shoes with the toes cut out a Ro's furus<br>and a pirated copy of Donna Summer's bad<br>girls on cassette<br>my mother had given me $500 to last a<br>year most of which was spent by Easter<br>uh on vodka and a pair of rugby boot uh<br>football boots what am I saying uh they<br>were expensive in those days and Before<br>40 years since the University of ockland<br>has has become my community I am of this<br>place a committed and loyal citizen a<br>fierce defender of its possibilities and<br>an Unapologetic critic of that which<br>follows in what follows I hope to convey<br>a whiff of me where I come from and who<br>I am a sense of what I have done at this<br>place what I think is important about it<br>at this moment and how I might explore<br>its<br>potentiality and why calling me a social<br>scientist bothers me the talk will be<br>formal befits the occasion so one in the<br>eye to you Anonymous one it will I hope<br>also be<br>passionate geograph oops here we go<br>geography at ockland turned 75 in<br>2021 this year we had only five students<br>in our compulsory postgraduate course<br>and numbers are falling in schools in<br>2025 we will stop running firste<br>geography<br>courses geography stands nervously in<br>the crosshairs of a university-wide<br>program of course rationalization that<br>has little regard for disciplinary<br>boundaries diagnoses by those who should<br>know better suggest that the numbers<br>represent a terminal loss of interest in<br>the<br>discipline yet the university is<br>institutionalizing a transdisciplinary<br>teaching program that looks much like<br>geography itself and is taught by<br>geographers New Zealand's government is<br>redefining nation and has launched an<br>extractionist economic growth program<br>democracy and its SP its spatial checks<br>and balances are being undermined at<br>home as they are elsewhere climate<br>change disasters resource Wars and a<br>proliferation of military conflicts<br>speak to the increasing complexity of<br>economic political and environmental<br>geographies at all scales the<br>apocalyptic and genocidal annihilation<br>of Gaza and the disintegration of Sudan<br>top a bill of global Injustice that is<br>sapping<br>Humanity everywhere liberalism is in<br>crisis and social institutions necessary<br>to enable individual freedoms Justice<br>and Equity are under multipronged attack<br>just when we need a politics of the<br>collective we see a new demagogy and an<br>self-interest geography has much to say<br>about these things it is surely the time<br>for a discipline that examines the<br>interaction between spatial Dynamics and<br>lived places students are surely<br>interested if not then when wherever<br>Billboards imploring them to make a<br>world where their selves might have<br>meaning this is an unsettling moment to<br>be asked to profess geography tonight I<br>address this unease from a position<br>framed by my own Journey as a scholar<br>located in geography in a school of<br>environment in the science faculty at<br>the University of Oakland the location<br>ockland is quite some distance from both<br>mayaya Cook Islands and opaki taranaki<br>the two places that have been most<br>formative of my early self it was<br>further still from the other 10 places<br>where I lived before<br>that I grew up very much a subject of my<br>father's educational commitments and his<br>restlessly futile search for a winnable<br>education-based emancipatory project on<br>multiple<br>continents we lived in school houses and<br>never in the same one for more than 2<br>years there is an englishness a Pacific<br>and an Oakland to my accent scholarship<br>and being and a certain<br>contrariness if there is an anchor it's<br>to my immediate family who have traveled<br>with<br>me my mother Jill is a long suffer of<br>the road but the architect of a Thrifty<br>successful and values based household<br>and the manager of a family that<br>survived for travels completing a degree<br>later in life she became a deeply caring<br>wut based probation officer and is now a<br>wonderful grandmother living in Milton<br>s um My Father David provided an<br>upbringing rich with educational and<br>other forms of cultural capital and an<br>example of the conflicted character<br>required of obsessive commitment and a<br>failure to accept the world had its own<br>agency his was a journey from grammar<br>school through Cambridge and the<br>Footlights a rejection of the British<br>establishment teaching and sports<br>coaching success a deep Embrace of the<br>possibilities of Independence and<br>development and a State honor from the<br>Sultan of brunai uh to finally come to<br>rest on ratonga a CO's first victim in<br>Islands some people in the audience<br>actually know my brother um my SI my<br>siblings have found stronger place-based<br>Moorings my brother Owen and veter at<br>Hustler and committed educator in Mari<br>and Pacific communities is now Secretary<br>of Education in the Cook Islands while<br>my sister Natasha once teacher of Terell<br>total immersion classes in two ockland<br>intermediate schools is now a teacher<br>and a props mistress and choreography<br>she's a teacher a props mistress and a<br>choreographer of a Pacific Fusion dance<br>UK my own moing is to my three daughters<br>and to Heather my partner in life of<br>more than 35 years<br>previously in advertising and PR he<br>retrained as a teacher uh as the kids<br>arrived and is now a nationally<br>recognized Primary School educator the<br>girls Charlotte Victoria and Holly are<br>all confident funny and successful young<br>nest vix and H are here tonight as are<br>my sister-in-law Judy and some of our<br>oldest<br>friends that we are here owes everything<br>to Heather and much to Judy who proof<br>read my PhD thesis and told me she<br>paragraph a bit a<br>pill but as tonight hopefully<br>one geography was not my first Port of<br>Call partially clothed and armed<br>unnecessarily with a my myosaurus I<br>began University as a Commerce<br>student within a year I was in front of<br>Dean Tarling asked to switch to a con<br>asking to switch to a conjoint degree he<br>glowed at me over his glasses and from<br>behind a desk framed by a wall of books<br>and asked why I thought I was good<br>enough this was more like the ivory<br>towered University of my imagination and<br>emerging<br>desire while possibly not involving the<br>Arts to which tling had suggested I was<br>not born I completed a conjoint degree<br>majoring in anthropology geography and<br>economics<br>with no home other than the University<br>of ockland The Next Step meant ma<br>Masters but in what discipline I was<br>then by then Marxist a the critic of<br>development processes globalization and<br>neoc classical economics and very close<br>to the staff in<br>anthropology geography however came with<br>a discipl discipline defining license to<br>do whatever I<br>wanted which was to return to the cooks<br>to write a thesis on the articulation of<br>modes of production<br>yeah I think that slide was supposed to<br>go there uh following the thesis I<br>coordinated geography 102 in<br>19888 and Oakland's first<br>cross-disciplinary Pacific studies<br>course which led to con to on to<br>convening a Pacific island student<br>Collective and the monograph coconuts<br>begin with a c outlining the challenges<br>facing Pacific students at the<br>University by the end of 1988 I had met<br>Heather The Keeper of the key to col to<br>kenzo's Moet Locker we disappeared<br>overseas for 6 years in<br>1989 uh H working with a PR Company in<br>Mayfair cleansing the images of<br>miscellaneous incurable tyrants and I<br>pulling pints next door and and later<br>calculating annual Returns on property<br>portfolios for Pension funds in Camden<br>which is a much more exciting part of<br>town in break in breaks we backpacked I<br>learned much about who I was and wasn't<br>and for fortunately H Stu stuck<br>around we returned in 1995 to a country<br>much changed by the neoliberal reforms a<br>chance to encounter with a very<br>different dean of arts Warren Moran saw<br>me return to a welcoming University of<br>ockland there followed 12 years of PhD<br>self-funded research precarious<br>employment breeding and multiple<br>the PHD asked how we had become<br>neoliberal it demonstrated how e over<br>school audit agency turned parents into<br>choosers and made parental Choice a<br>market by publishing its audits of<br>school practices as de facto quality<br>markers working with governmentality<br>analysis and a regulation Theory<br>borrowed from offer and Roger Dale it<br>argued that neoliberal statecraft was<br>about shaping subjectivities as well as<br>privatizing stuff but parental Choice<br>was made and audit was a neoliberal<br>technology par<br>Excellence I can't believe she said this<br>um volz's bastards dealt dealt with<br>there have been many projects<br>since but taale is one of strategic<br>opportunism grounded in geography<br>scholarly promiscuity and emanci<br>emancipatory project projects and phases<br>bleed and overlap as to the different<br>roles of the academic as te teacher<br>researcher and institutional citizen<br>there really was no<br>map the precarious years began with<br>teaching Foundation studies and<br>geography as a leave replacement for<br>Lindsey blue and supporting Warren uh to<br>establish the wine industry Research<br>Institute and auckland's wine science<br>program I taught on its graduate program<br>and researched the governance regulation<br>and development of the New Zealand<br>industry this period opened doors to the<br>center of the science faculty while<br>Warren's mentorship and weekly wine<br>tasting Al also open them into the Arts<br>faculty you can see where I preferred to<br>go um all this gave me rare and<br>privileged insights into the university<br>which really have marked uh my time here<br>a fast start maen and a posttop followed<br>examining Brand New Zealand and the<br>making of New Zealand's wine fashion and<br>International Education Industries they<br>opened opportunities to work with more<br>in Malloy and Wendy Lana and renew<br>relationships built through the PHD with<br>sociologists of of Education and Susan<br>Robertson and Roger D the idea of<br>economies in the making or economization<br>work my Arts context led to two years of<br>teaching the core course in development<br>studies and encounters with post<br>capitalist and post-development ideas<br>with ion Underhill Sam I responded to an<br>invitation from my brother to do some<br>asset mapping with<br>tedwa he was at the time managing teanga<br>for the E<br>that work helped me to rethink<br>contemporary Regional development in<br>terms of diverse Mari economy it also<br>prepared me some years later to reflect<br>critically on the development project in<br>one of my favorite pieces published in<br>an edited volume of papers by aging<br>Pacific white Pacific studies Scholars<br>returning to their field sites 30 years<br>after their first<br>work in 2004 as the only public good<br>funded social science postdoc I was<br>named named on bricks the National<br>Building research capability and the<br>social sciences program bricks was a<br>5-year multi-disciplinary cross<br>University Network designed to build<br>National social science<br>institutions with the support of fellow<br>geographers Richard laran and Dick<br>Bedford I played an increasingly<br>significant role in bricks and ended up<br>leading its early career research<br>activities and co-leading its next phase<br>this led in turn to an appointment to<br>the to hak kangata a national midyear<br>social science Forum funded by Mor and<br>to editorship of the new uh New Zealand<br>social sciences Journal<br>cotu sometime in the late naughties I<br>became a full-time academic in the<br>school of environment took a lot to get<br>a job in this place um and and at about<br>the same time I joined a major uh<br>Singapore based research group<br>investigating International Education in<br>East and Southeast Asia alongside<br>Francis Collins and the now<br>at the end of the 0s came the biological<br>economies marom program led by Richard<br>and Hugh Campbell and involving economic<br>geographers and Rural<br>sociologists the project produced a<br>critique of productivist Agriculture<br>from economic sociological and<br>environmental perspectives it explored<br>artisanal forms of Agri food activity<br>experiments in provenancing and the<br>growing prominence of a diverse Mar<br>controlled<br>economy and the regional possib<br>development possibilities of all these<br>things these are laid out in a public<br>facing book edited by Eric<br>porson you'll notice poor old Carolyn<br>Morris is the only woman in that<br>photograph very much was the last Hera<br>for a particular<br>era it also allowed Richard and I to<br>sharpen our understandings of the<br>potential of post structuralist<br>political economy which we laid out in a<br>second publication that brought uh<br>yeah that brought pspe more than human<br>theorizing and economization into<br>conversation the project also yielded<br>the actor Network story of morto mouse<br>another of my favorite pieces of work<br>the paper uses the Parliamentary<br>Commission of inquiry on font's botulism<br>crisis to ask why the death of a mouse<br>near uh nearly two years later brought<br>fona down nearly and nearly brought fona<br>down it questions the the underlying<br>rationality of globalization and<br>multi-sited processing of bulk products<br>that created the the opportunity for a<br>broken lens from a torch used to inspect<br>a to storage Camp uh LED and how that<br>led to the death of the mouse a year a<br>year or two later a set of events that<br>cost the collective anywhere up to $1.5<br>billion depending on how you do the<br>numbers um and it really did highlight<br>for me the level of complexity and<br>seen as biological economies unfolded<br>these two artifacts appeared<br>mysteriously on staff desks at the<br>University of Oakland reduce your waste<br>stop smoking Embrace sustainability and<br>dob in your<br>neighbor not to your boss note but to<br>KPMG that was to<br>lot uh facilitated by um it turned out<br>sorry that in another part of the HSB<br>Anthropologist Chris Shaw found these<br>icons at the new University as bizarre<br>as I did facilitated by a cross cross<br>faculty research Grant with John Morgan<br>and Nigel Hoth Chris and I began to take<br>a more systematic look at the<br>neoliberalizing University funding from<br>a newly minted worldwide University<br>Network a feature of the new<br>neoliberalizing University and ongoing<br>conversations with Susan Robertson Roger<br>Dale and Wendy ler all now at Bristol<br>led to an international project on<br>University<br>reform under its aaces and those of a<br>later lavishly funded EU program on<br>universities in the knowledge economy I<br>work with Chris Susan Roger suited arus<br>and a wi wide group of other colleagues<br>from around the world to trace the<br>pandemic of new public Management in<br>universities this included hosting the<br>death of the public university Symposium<br>in Oakland in 2012 and multiple<br>Publications that detailed the changing<br>Public University these culminated in my<br>editing of the series of vignettes in<br>the journal lce which detail account<br>which which detail and give detailed<br>accounts sorry of rankings award<br>ceremonies the creation of<br>commercialization units and the<br>circumplex a Timothy ly invention that<br>was deployed by an international<br>consultancy to measure<br>dispositions uh and impose change<br>culture upon our school<br>perhaps it was to try and get us all on<br>the<br>bus with Richard's with Richard's prod<br>prodding and the support of Simon frush<br>from 2013 I've explored New Zealand's<br>Marine Futures most notably as part of<br>the sustainable Seas National Science<br>challenge an initial project<br>investigating what it might take to do<br>Marine economy differently led to 5<br>years on the challenge leadership team<br>uh as leader of the blue economy theme<br>attempting to Foster a distinctive blue<br>Tero the blue economy research program<br>consisted of 16 research projects<br>designed to create the conditions of<br>possibility for a blue economy that<br>might arrest the ecological degradations<br>of the oceans and Empower communities to<br>prosper from their collectively held<br>Marine Resources each project was<br>possibility driven and impact focused<br>each involved researchers from diverse<br>disciplinary backgrounds and was to some<br>extent co-developed with businesses<br>government agencies community and<br>environmental groups and maudi entities<br>all Drew on a framing definition of blue<br>economy that while relatively<br>conservative inverted the challenge<br>growth the challenges growth within<br>limits<br>objective the program supported several<br>successful initiatives most notably in<br>relation to hapu based diverse<br>economy it also introduced a new<br>language around investment in the oceans<br>shielded The Challenge from pressures to<br>adopt a more orthod Orthodox growth<br>growth logic and informed Progressive<br>work on regulatory scientific and<br>challenge we produce recommendations for<br>government that laid out possible<br>interventions for transitioning to a<br>blue economy and a set of principles to<br>guide businesses investors and<br>government agencies with some hard<br>harder hitting guidelines uh for how to<br>operationalize the princi principles and<br>we held research Comm research workshops<br>with Community government and businesses<br>uh made multiple public presentations<br>and earlier this year completed a 13<br>City 50 presentational<br>re presentation Regional Road Show um<br>recovered much of the last 15 years uh<br>have been about trying to hold together<br>these different projects and<br>relationships<br>as I now move into being a professor I<br>have a Mazen exploring the way that that<br>Global Management consultancies the<br>interview request will come soon as we<br>get ethics to be able to do it um our<br>imagineering our imagineering the um how<br>these entities are imagineering the<br>future by building a knowledge<br>infrastructure that is blurring the<br>boundaries between state and capital<br>work on this project has been<br>complemented by the formation with Tom<br>Baker and Larry Murphy of a politics<br>economies in place or pep research group<br>focused on reading it at the<br>disciplinary edges and interacting<br>regular<br>regularly uh with postgraduate students<br>uh pep has with Tom's guidance fashioned<br>an impressive program of work and public<br>intellectualism and has for me uh<br>provided a reason to be in this place at<br>this<br>time with John Morgan and Jamie Gillan<br>as conduits pep has also helped to<br>cement relationships with the interdis<br>interdisciplinary group Suzanne and The<br>Buttery boys are handle marginally less<br>distasteful than the name of the quiz<br>team that represents<br>it the group is supporting me uh to<br>University what I'd like to do now is to<br>focus on three themes emerging from this<br>research program draw some generic<br>lessons and then argue for how to<br>respond to the challenge of B becoming a<br>professor at this<br>geography Brooks was funded to build<br>research capability networks and Foster<br>uh a national social science my work<br>with it included an an initial effort<br>with sociologist David fors fors to map<br>the project we argued that social<br>science post questions of the social<br>condition how Society Community Nation<br>organization come and organizations come<br>to be and the processes at work on them<br>globalization capitalism economy<br>politics inequality culture and the<br>production of power culture anthropology<br>sociology and so on and it had defining<br>epistemologic epistemological<br>methodological and political tensions<br>which lay across an essential<br>criticality and and an emancipatory<br>Center at which lay political<br>economy the map echoed Andrew s's<br>definition of social science as a<br>category marked by defining tensions<br>between criticality normativity<br>objectivity problem definition and<br>emancipatory intent he argues that and I<br>quote contradictions and dilemmas abound<br>proliferate and<br>mutate yet background forces were<br>aligning against this political economy<br>out way of identifying social science<br>Mor discovered Mo Motu knowledge and was<br>debating the impact at gender<br>it embraced a version of<br>interdisciplinarity that recognized the<br>potential for social science to support<br>both science Earth environmental food<br>and otherwise applied and social policy<br>herak kangata was invited to play in<br>sampitz with its science analog the<br>oxygen group sorry<br>um uh the the Embrace became a fixture<br>of the funding landscape and the<br>projects that emerged social scientists<br>were added to project teams to do<br>project management communication values<br>detection and behavior change applied<br>social science units in education social<br>work and population management appeared<br>in universities the private sector and<br>eventually the<br>Cris the new funding Landscapes elevated<br>behaviorist accounts and solutionist<br>rationalities and decentered critical<br>theoretical approaches by the end of the<br>2010s social science was being wedded to<br>the language of stakeholding values<br>engagement Outreach comms uptake and<br>transdisciplinarity<br>the National Science challenges were<br>also conceived of this Embrace<br>participation of social sciences was<br>mandated especially in the second phase<br>of the of of a challenge from 2020 when<br>challenges were exhorted to become<br>transdisciplinary as well as a way to<br>uptake and impact as a pathway to uptake<br>and impact this process played out<br>alongside the systematic and apparently<br>innocent and inclusive relabeling of<br>academics and Scholars as researchers by<br>the PBF government agencies and their<br>own universities for Scholars of the<br>social not only did this drive a wedge<br>between their researcher and teacher<br>selves and responsibilities but it<br>concentrated the emerging<br>instrumentalist and solutionist<br>value the sustainable Seas challenge<br>included social scientists at its Center<br>and can justify ibly claimed to have<br>adopted genuinely transdisciplinary<br>research approaches it took social<br>science<br>seriously yet still positioned it as a<br>solution uh building rather than as<br>solution building rather than uh<br>exploration and critique a language of<br>and focus on social systems decision<br>Frameworks guidelines and tools<br>highlighted an underlying reference uh<br>to technocratic and behavioralist<br>solutions the challenge is theory of<br>change was a faux chart running from<br>research project to social impact and<br>anything but a<br>theory the workshop became a Cornerstone<br>methodology and the yellow sticky was<br>the go-to means of observing and<br>analyzing the social and reducing it and<br>this is the important point I think to a<br>knowledge uh to a knowable and<br>manageable<br>object distribution and the<br>sociopolitical construction of<br>assemblages of social action such as<br>Community were off the table<br>there's a story to be told here too<br>about how the rise of V vision matanga<br>and its later refashioning into a<br>recognition of matanga Mari became<br>wrapped up in the same processes and a<br>more important one of how Mii social<br>sciences escape co-option to lead their<br>own projects with far more sharply<br>articulated emancipatory objectives for<br>tonight however the point is that in 20<br>years the invis invisibility and<br>apparent irrelevance of social science<br>became Central NE it but with social<br>science redefined and political economy<br>core I think you I think you should have<br>um Beyond its critical and explanatory<br>15 yes over the last decade I've come to<br>realize that my research has been has<br>largely been<br>about<br>economization had I recognized that 15<br>years ago I could have been famous at<br>least at least in geography<br>um the starting<br>point is Timothy Mitchell's<br>reinterpretation of economy as a social<br>process that mobilizes allocates and<br>stewards resources to yield livelihoods<br>material economies are configurations of<br>practices and relations assembled in<br>place they are made they are always made<br>and always both cultural and political<br>the idea of the economy is a fiction<br>created as an object for nationally<br>National development Management in the<br>1930s markets are similarly real sites<br>of exchange but they are also made and<br>they are also social Arrangements placed<br>regulated subjectified flawed and so on<br>their alleged magical qualities of<br>self-organization and independent<br>operation are<br>fantasies as are the claims that they<br>generate efficient or just outcomes the<br>appeal the appeal to the market as the<br>core institution of social organization<br>is a political and ideological<br>argument my research has allowed me to<br>build on these insights in three ways<br>first it has developed the argument that<br>achieving significant social and<br>environmental outcomes requires that we<br>do economy<br>differently second it has demonstrated<br>the possibilities<br>oh I'm getting ahead M yes there are<br>four ways<br>um uh it's demonstrated the<br>possibilities and limits of research<br>that actively engages um in making<br>economies in articulation with<br>capitalist<br>economy third it developed the notion of<br>geographical rent for economic<br>geographer Bret Christophers and others<br>contemporary capitalist Dynamics are<br>based on the pursuit and exploitation of<br>economic rents<br>I have tried to argue that the rents are<br>essentially geographical the added<br>returns from doing things here rather<br>than there they arise from spatial<br>unevenness the geography of economy the<br>privatization and monopolistic<br>preservation of rare or unique resources<br>and Regulatory efforts to overcome these<br>in aaro our economy is extractionist and<br>rent based land sea whatever small<br>amount of Ip we can produce and retain<br>and the industry that assemble around<br>government Beyond its critical and O<br>where are we yes Beyond its critical and<br>explanatory potential our work in Kota<br>um as part of the challenge demonstrated<br>how the idea of geographical rent can be<br>used to imagine and enact projects of<br>local resourcefulness through Collective<br>action we Illustrated the significance<br>of the work of of iwi Hau and Community<br>organization in assembling diverse<br>collectively held or generated resources<br>social organizational and natural for<br>Collective benefit what Tanya Lee calls<br>resourcefulness in this way and fourth<br>it demonstrated the potential of Mari<br>economy to generate Collective returns<br>from Collective ownership of resources<br>and our Mar centered practices at all<br>scales as if this probably probably as<br>if this needed to be discovered uh um it<br>foreshadowed the conclusion picked up on<br>by Matt scobby and Anna Sturman that<br>alter's future will depend in large part<br>on how Marty engaged with capitalism and<br>point we got this here no getting<br>ahead universities are key sites in the<br>production and translation of knowledge<br>which we know creates the imagination<br>and material conditions for world making<br>and is always political in its making<br>and effects this is the third theme in<br>the a liberalization of the<br>University ethnographies of universities<br>have traced and theorized their<br>neoliberalization but in concentrating<br>on new managerial Technologies of<br>control have missed much of the<br>significance of the centralization of<br>powers for what universities actually do<br>what is at stake is the nature of the<br>knowledge that gets made and taught<br>Republic University is distinguished by<br>its independence in determining these<br>things<br>which have been driven by curios<br>curiosity and critique in conditions of<br>contest Guided by disciplinary<br>institutions rather than directed or<br>curated by powerful<br>interests this has secured academic<br>freedom which is the public University's<br>deeper purpose and enshrined in New<br>Zealand law Vice chancellors are now<br>positioned however to Define for<br>themselves a post Social Democratic<br>purpose for the public university by<br>directing what it does<br>this will be Cur curated if not<br>determined by their Vision funder<br>pressures intermediary reports networks<br>and<br>kpis the independence of universities is<br>under threet at precisely the time when<br>this Independence is as important as it<br>has been for 100 years who decides what<br>knowledge universities make and teach<br>are pivotal<br>questions the argument<br>then you thought it already keep gone<br>um New Zealand universities depend on<br>Government funding recent governments<br>have cut funding in real terms and<br>chiseled away at University autonomy<br>through funding directives and increased<br>influence on University<br>councils current reviews of the national<br>science system and University funding<br>models promise tightened government<br>control over research and curricular<br>governments are making new demands on<br>universities to inform policy policy for<br>population management and to support<br>economic growth and deal with its social<br>contradictions how did that get<br>that there's one missing let me go<br>is what follows takes its license from<br>McKenzie<br>who see descent as good for corporations<br>as if we needed a license but um we have<br>witnessed in our own University a<br>Relentless corpor corporatization<br>designed to take control at its Center<br>this has been Advanced through multi<br>multiple interconnected agendas the<br>adoption of corporate language building<br>a managerial<br>architecture of uh units and and new<br>executive appointments the raising<br>disciplines depart uh departments and<br>collegial committees uh that organize<br>work in independent ways and forcing an<br>acculturation of Staff into new teams<br>and units each new university-wide<br>webinar invariably announces a new<br>initiative policies guidelines and AD<br>and uh policy guidelines new<br>administrative units and team identities<br>and loyalties have decentered<br>disciplines and are replacing curiosity<br>and critique as drivers of university<br>life the recent faculty merges course<br>and program rationalization and<br>transdisciplinary initiatives illustrate<br>the capacity and the will of the center<br>to direct produ the production and<br>teaching of knowledge we are getting<br>closer to the academic endpoint of<br>severing research from teaching as a<br>defining feature of the academic a<br>subjectivity that has so frustrated<br>corporatizing aspirations to audit value<br>cost and manage academics and what they<br>do what price now pains me to say on the<br>end of a<br>professor universities face the<br>obstructed unobstructed rule of the<br>managerat but for what reason that's<br>another lecture uh for another time<br>about anti-political machines Global<br>Management consultancies inclusive<br>capitalism the collapse of the mutual<br>dependence of democracy and capitalism<br>and demagog<br>demagoguery um more<br>generally for tonight's uh purposes it's<br>enough to observe that it's not true<br>that all this is business as usual or<br>that staff are excited by it at least<br>not in a positive<br>way such misrepresentations are Unworthy<br>of University leaders and should be<br>called<br>out rather the university is being<br>prepared for tighter direction from the<br>center and More instrumental and<br>solutionist curricula laced with<br>attention to<br>inclusivity Second Step In this argument<br>is that social science will be expected<br>to shoulder much of that burden but not<br>in the forms we currently understand it<br>and not appropriately resourced we're<br>some way from recognizing that the<br>biggest problems of government are<br>social but there is a growing<br>recognition that most require social<br>Solutions even if it is only to persuade<br>communities of the value of technical<br>fixes or to change their behavior this<br>will require specific knowledge and<br>subjects educated in it research and<br>teach teaching in social sciences are<br>being reframed<br>accordingly uh science friends Now's the<br>Time to shut<br>curious<br>alarmingly scientists are increasingly<br>training themselves in this superficial<br>solutionist social<br>science sorry friends um there is a<br>large there is at large a Tor re<br>appropriation of the subject matter<br>Concepts and methodologies to go with<br>the indentured labor of working on<br>science programs if not a colonization<br>of fields of social knowledge by applied<br>scientists as they teach the social in<br>their own or transdisciplinary courses<br>and fill into disciplinary journals with<br>pretheoretical readings of social<br>processes this is a structural<br>analysis there are many<br>examples uh where projects have made<br>space for social scientists to do their<br>thing and even lead research in cases<br>where individual ual do their time<br>reading what it takes to become a social<br>scientist this world importantly also<br>provides opportunities for subversion I<br>have been the<br>beneficiary however colonization is<br>colonization um it is hard to see a<br>place for Sayers social science<br>ironically one that so many students<br>want and that is so valuable to sustain<br>critique maintain democracy informed<br>Public's fully and under good projects<br>of inclusion what happens to this body<br>of work when it's not recognized in the<br>Clock Tower and feared in the<br>Beehive I want tonight to finish by<br>offering a a a potentially positive<br>answer uh well it's not really an answer<br>it's just it's just Pathways to go<br>forward um and arguing for something to<br>take back the University at least<br>minimally by reclaiming social science<br>I'll point to three interconnected<br>projects where this may occur even if<br>suggesting that we're going to turn it<br>around is going too<br>far you're supposed to laugh at that<br>that's a trump that's a trump um<br>again even if suggesting that we're<br>going to turn it around is going too far<br>so you got to laugh<br>now otherwise you won't get the second<br>part of the<br>joke and as and it says distasteful as<br>the big jizz getting quizzy quiz handle<br>of of Suzanne and The Buttery<br>team the The Thirst is is is the<br>simplest to conceive and possibly also<br>to achieve that is to create<br>opportunities to uh to do our our own<br>work by doing the work that they need<br>and think my goodness that's a<br>complicated sense<br>um<br>uh I'll leave that<br>um the first really is to work within<br>programs uh to achieve what we want to<br>do uh under the cover of the work that<br>they others think that we should do<br>um this might extend uh to taking back<br>the transdisciplinary and gen generic<br>degree agendas from the bottom up<br>through lecture content module capture<br>and course redesign<br>or it may be achieved top down by for<br>example pledging support qualified by<br>commitments for extensive Social Science<br>Leadership some of this is already being<br>achieved at core is the crucial<br>importance that courses be based on a<br>deep criticality rather than<br>anti-political solutionism and that does<br>not and that criticality does not mean<br>impacts inclusion Behavior change ethics<br>or presenting different<br>perspectives in both cases this should<br>be done strategically collectively and<br>with allies we must insist that there is<br>a price to our participation and our<br>co-option the time and opportunity to do<br>our own research I suggest is a<br>price our own research on the social to<br>run our own graduate courses to hire our<br>Replacements there is a politics to be<br>had in taking the managers at their<br>words but tying them down to them the<br>second is closely connected<br>I'm going to get there Robin I<br>think to commit scholarly energy and<br>resources to knowledge making that will<br>support the doing of economy differently<br>this is a game of extending both<br>sustainability and place into a social<br>realist agenda again taking the managers<br>at the words of tomat this<br>time somehow I have to go back<br>now how I'm going to do that okay there<br>we are<br>let's put new place-based assem uh<br>assemblages of place let's put new<br>assemblages of place-based<br>resourcefulness and the collective<br>capture of geographic rents at the heart<br>of social science Foster new forms of<br>collective action and support for social<br>and cultural forms that make this a<br>vibrant and free way to live there is a<br>Resurgence of place a place conscious<br>political economy in aror focused on<br>events Alternatives or moments of<br>political change these are increasingly<br>thinking through or attached to the<br>central part that Mari play in<br>contemporary political and cultural<br>economy diverse and capitalist my own<br>research teaches me that aaro is a place<br>where we might imagine something better<br>and that Mari leadership is pivotal<br>and as is quoted on the on the cover of<br>of Matt and Anna's<br>book how Mari engageed with capitalism<br>holds the key Mari political economists<br>are work in this<br>space the third is to explore what is<br>possible in<br>geography and here my geography<br>colleagues get to get angry with<br>me and to imagine a revitalizing social<br>realist<br>turn I think we've gone beyond that now<br>where are we yeah oh I'm going backwards<br>sorry that's not very smart um geography<br>is a Restless configuration ation of<br>knowledge production<br>projects exploring Place space and<br>territory I am not going to make 645<br>what what happens to me does a hole open<br>in the ground um exploring Place space<br>and territory these projects coexist<br>around a shared empirical Focus<br>conceptual promiscuity methodological<br>experimen experimentalism and an<br>emphasis on the situatedness of<br>knowledge witting or otherwise there is<br>no discipline specific Cannon or<br>unifying skill set that might Define a<br>teaching program geography in<br>universities has been has in practice<br>been defined by epistemological divides<br>between the study of social and natural<br>processes these have seen it located<br>differently in different universities<br>sometimes in arts sometimes in<br>science uh some and sometimes consisting<br>of only social or physical science<br>negotiating this divide Building Bridges<br>across it and conceptualizing place as<br>the site which the social and physical<br>interact in collectively lived<br>experiences and managed relations was<br>once geography's<br>strength but this was in an earlier era<br>of State Le if you think I'm going on<br>you should read cumberland's inaugural<br>lecture in<br>1946 the inaugural uh lecture of the<br>inaugural<br>Professor um but this was an an earlier<br>era of State Le and managed<br>developmentalism and when nation<br>building appeared unpro<br>there were soils to categorize<br>Landscapes to break in and cities and<br>physical social infrastructure to<br>build all with a critical concern for<br>people rivers and hillsides region was a<br>key and stable organizational unit place<br>was a political and Technical matter of<br>concern and we needed planning and<br>experts with multidisiplinary knowledge<br>geography thrived by encompassing the<br>possibilities of integrated spatial<br>planning and economic development at<br>diverse scales this of course<br>disintegrated sticking to the narrative<br>that geography is a study of<br>interactions between human and<br>geophysical environments has failed has<br>failed it failed geography that is as<br>research specialization and in in and um<br>institutional change of torn it a su<br>physical geographers have chased models<br>and behavioralism while human<br>geographers have chased wizened French<br>philosophers nature cultures and<br>Scholars of<br>care others have continued to describe<br>places mired in a world world where<br>social process masquerades as common<br>sense in the categories of the<br>development State geography's potential<br>claim to the spaces of<br>transdisciplinarity and applied economy<br>as funding regimes and organizational<br>Logics have once again turn turned uh<br>favorable have been overwhelmed by the<br>sheer scale of that<br>turn uh to transdisciplinarity as<br>institutional politics and the Cent's<br>failure to look up from its consultancy<br>reports to see its own<br>University I have no whiskful love for<br>geography or desire for its cloak of<br>identity but it is a valuable assemblage<br>of knowledge projects the fate of which<br>is now entangled with the new project of<br>social science as service to solutionism<br>and inclusion and inclusion the first<br>year courses into which geographers will<br>teach in 2025 will serve as students<br>from across a school that includes Earth<br>information and environmental scientists<br>and are designed to cultivate interest<br>from other science students geography<br>must serve its science Master to survive<br>success May simply prove that the label<br>geography the irony I guess is that<br>success may prove May simply prove that<br>the label geography is no longer needed<br>um but puts at risk the teaching of much<br>of its subject matter failing to succeed<br>will guarantee its demise demise<br>ironically however uh safeguarding its<br>value for the The Faculty of Science and<br>the university depends entirely on being<br>able to do solutionism and inclusion<br>better than others because it is so<br>richly informed by the full Suite of<br>diverse criticality in social science<br>its value to an Arts faculty we well be<br>the reverse that's the discomforting<br>career don't expect you to read<br>this or understand the diagram it's just<br>my musings um<br>to survive I argue that geography needs<br>to be able to articulate a distinctive<br>and unifying purpose and conf configure<br>a compelling teaching program to deliver<br>on<br>it if as my research suggests geography<br>is the study of<br>economy in the way that I've defined it<br>and it lives in a science faculty then<br>for me that purpose is clear geography<br>should research and teach economy and<br>how economies come to be why why we<br>should do economy differently and what<br>we should demonstrate how<br>resourcefulness from cultural practice<br>and belief to natural features and<br>processes management practices and<br>investment capital is assembled in place<br>all geographers can in some way sign up<br>to that purpose whether their starting<br>point is modeling Coastal erosion or<br>Urban social infrastructure this would<br>more geography to the materiality of its<br>diverse interests in a distinctive<br>approach to knowledge and action and in<br>a way that allows for discipline for uh<br>disciplin Le impactful research and<br>teaching Coastal erosion the closure of<br>of of public libraries landscape change<br>the construction of cloud regions<br>Oakland's area night issues and the<br>FastTrack consenting process can all be<br>taught in that way of course we can't<br>all be<br>geographers sad but true um others will<br>need to find ways to hang on to their<br>disciplines uh but as living in<br>conceptually politically and<br>methodologically Advent ous bodies of<br>knowledge and<br>practice it is from this position that<br>we might retake the transdisciplinary<br>program and solutionist social science<br>Mo we might might retake social science<br>and make the transdisciplinary and<br>solution solutionist social Mo science<br>game<br>okay to end I want to ack knowledge uh<br>that working at the university is work<br>but also a privilege my own privilege<br>has been extraordinary literally<br>hundreds of visits to other places it's<br>probably not the way to measure<br>privilege<br>but it has certainly been a privileged<br>Journey I've worked in cities from Kaya<br>to the bluff in Aro and in 45 cities<br>internationally and I visited a few more<br>getting to them I've shared dinners and<br>drinks with C celebrated geographers on<br>multiple continents hosted many in the<br>family home and engaged with Vice<br>chancellors past present and even future<br>we might speculate over breakfast lunch<br>and dinner in trips on walks along<br>beaches and canals and in late night<br>drinking sessions in Dublin<br>bars I've had dinner with a brunai and<br>Princess as well as a group of New<br>Zealand's finest wine makers paid for by<br>the Airs of the Gallow Fortune it was a<br>big Bill<br>formal dinners in the Bordeaux and<br>Barcelona town halls and in the castle<br>at<br>monino Tuscany I believe tastings of now<br>this one is really rough tastings of the<br>Millennium vintage of Don Perino with<br>the wine maker in the ab do do fantastic<br>a day with amarie Mo mole uh walking the<br>dyes outside<br>Amsterdam and I've conducted fieldwork<br>in a giant rugby ball in Tokyo and the<br>World Expo in in<br>Shanghai I've lost the Expo slide um I<br>ran out of time being able to put and I<br>didn't have it anyway uh to give you<br>photos of everywhere that I've been<br>lucky to have been but I did get to hang<br>out in the giant rugby ball with the<br>mayor of H and then at the Expo Shanghai<br>Expo with the mayor of<br>Hastings fantastic two or three days um<br>and to top it all I've had 25 years of<br>teaching thousands of students on 22<br>undergraduate courses across five<br>disciplines guest lectures in others and<br>full and full modules or more in eight<br>postgraduate courses across six<br>postgraduate<br>programs kind of Wick out how to make<br>this go in the right<br>direction this has<br>included um closer teaching<br>relationships with 28 uh PhD students I<br>hope I've captured your names if you<br>happen to be here uh not all to<br>completion I'm not sure what that says<br>about me um 47 Master students uh and 18<br>honors students five of these graduate<br>students have gone on to work in the New<br>Zealand Academy and two in Cris retesh<br>sha Mark tadaki Emma Shar Valentine<br>Becka Barbara Ribero Steven Fitz Herbert<br>and Allison<br>Greenway two courses stand out the<br>geography 207 field course traveling uh<br>traveling TI too uh which I taught with<br>Joe Fagan and grle bosck uh Jeremy<br>hemmer and on occasions Lindsay blue and<br>others and Jo and J 738 my graduate food<br>course built from a biological economies<br>learon along the way my research has<br>taught<br>me and for as Anthropologist Julie Park<br>once told me what you teach is not<br>necessarily what is learned the pieces<br>of your writing are not necessarily<br>those in top International journals mine<br>have been in books or in New Zealand<br>journals where I've I've had the freedom<br>to develop an aoral voice and also to um<br>to explore what's important for us here<br>uh and and therefore for everyone rather<br>than the other way around our purpose is<br>scholarly Pursuit uh but we can and<br>should serve the university and public<br>meaningfully launching experiments and<br>not Concepts from the academy can<br>trouble business as usual and stimulate<br>positive change but it will come with<br>accommodations the inevitability of<br>failure and much<br>Jamie is a lived and situated knowledge<br>practice that allows knowledge makers to<br>operate uh in uncomfortable boundary<br>spaces between application and theory<br>and critique and pragmatism and across<br>multiple bodies of knowledge that's a<br>research<br>Le finding um it's a finding I'm not<br>sure it would be counted at that as as<br>such it's stainable Seas but it's a<br>finding<br>um Bist of thanks is<br>long so oh God I'm keep going the wrong<br>way how am I going that<br>way where's the list of thanks the list<br>of thanks is probably gone um<br>okay it'll have to be off the cuff<br>um uh the professional staff who've kept<br>me in my job and always made it fun uh<br>from Bon Marshall and Gail Arnold to<br>Michael groom Anna Sim Patricia<br>Ilan uh and all those in between my<br>colleagues and students my long list of<br>mentors uh of whom all of whom have<br>shown me how to be a critical scholar<br>yet also an Engaged University Citizen<br>and a constr constructive political<br>subject again hope no one's name's not<br>off this list uh Warren Moran Richard<br>laran Dick Bedford Wendy Lana Roger Dale<br>Susan Robertson Pauline mcer H Campbell<br>Gordon Winder Michael carolam Chris Shaw<br>John Morgan Simon<br>fresh an extensive list um thank you all<br>for<br>um yeah the the advice and um the<br>opportunities all those with whom I've I<br>have collaborated I did do the counts<br>there are literally they're probably<br>well over a 100 people that I've<br>co-published with um and the these these<br>come from just about every one of my<br>colleagues in the the social sciences in<br>in<br>geography<br>um multiple uh collaborations with<br>people across disciplines at the<br>University of Oakland and many with with<br>uh the the the those that I've probably<br>collaborated most with in chronological<br>order would be Warren Richard Robin<br>Kerns Ivonne Gordon uh Gordon Winder<br>Susan Robertson Chris Tom John and of<br>course Karen Fisher um with whom I've<br>collaborated considerably over the last<br>few years um and I like to thank of<br>course um<br>my students and and the postto that I've<br>worked<br>with this better be in the right<br>direction<br>now<br>yes John Morgan one of those people who<br>I've um benefited immensely from uh<br>having time with greeted my pro pro<br>promotion with the line so what's the<br>project again he gets it spot on for<br>what a university should be I don't have<br>a piffy answer but putting aside the<br>sense that professors May no longer<br>launch projects May no longer even exist<br>in a in a shortish period there are a<br>few things on my<br>agenda the family rediscovered in our<br>first family holiday for years pursuing<br>a pursuing a revitalized geography<br>completing the Mast project writing two<br>Unwritten books supporting generational<br>change in a thriving uh p and with Simon<br>thrush Conrad p Karen fiser and others<br>restoring the hardi golf there's a<br>little project for you<br>um oh and what I want want to leave you<br>with really is is<br>quote as well as a promise never again<br>to pick up right on or read another<br>yellow sticky um something that luminary<br>uh geographer John Allen once said to me<br>over a glass of very good wine uh<br>somewhere on Victoria Street there are<br>many ways to be a good academic he said<br>very wisely he uh he is a very wise old<br>ow he's a magnificent<br>man<br>so oh and please please don't call me a<br>social<br>scientist or at least think carefully<br>about the context before you<br>do please join uh hether and Victoria<br>and myself the lovely bar manager at gal<br>Braves uh for a uh for drinks and<br>nibbles um there and the the opportunity<br>uh to eat and drink more at your own<br>expense after that um the bar manager is<br>is certainly uh set to welcome us Manu</p></main><footer style="margin-top: 2rem; background: #0001; padding: 2rem;
