welcome I stand here under the cloak<br>of the people of this place ktim mamoy<br>uh and to the house that stands here<br>greetings uh may you stand forever uh if<br>there's any question about the where we<br>are standing forever uh and there's an<br>earthquake and you know what to do drop<br>cover and hold uh if there's threat of<br>fire or other emergencies uh then sits<br>are out here and we'll meet in front of<br>the<br>archways and to those that have passed<br>um maybe we remember you as you passed<br>to the other side and um just personally<br>I'd like to make an acknowledgement to<br>my PhD supervisor who passed away within<br>the last month and was farewelled in the<br>UK a professor hun Ahmed a great mentor<br>and guide to me in my career so may we<br>all remember him here in this time um<br>Kao<br>UHA Co Richard Blakey takaa uh greetings<br>everyone I'm Richard Blakey Deputy Vice<br>Chancellor research and Enterprise and<br>it's my great privilege to be hosting<br>this inaugural professorial lecture<br>where we celebrate the promotion to<br>Professor uh for Ivan samt uh in the<br>department of pharmacology and<br>toxicology<br>um it's a it's a great occasion and<br>there's many people to greet and welcome<br>we have unfortunately a depleted<br>academic party due to illness largely uh<br>the number of uh things that are going<br>around now that we're all relaxed with<br>the end of lectures it seems to be<br>catching up on a few people so there are<br>apologies from ad Dina biomedical<br>Sciences Professor Lisa matus Smith and<br>the proce chancellor division of uh<br>Health Sciences um Megan Gibbons who<br>both who both give their apologies but<br>uh we do have many special guests uh in<br>your far now friends family and members<br>of the denan community to welcome like<br>to particularly acknowledge your wife<br>Janine here and your daughter Laura who<br>are here present I think your son may be<br>going to watch this in the future and I<br>think there are many people uh gathered<br>uh worldwide from South Africa to the UK<br>the Us and other places who are joining<br>us either live online or are watching<br>this at some point in the future so no<br>my Hadi welcome to you all um my role is<br>to give a brief intruction to the the<br>the the event I say a couple of words<br>but I'll hand over uh to Professor<br>Katherine day who will introduce Ivan's<br>IPL we'll then have the IPL a little bit<br>of a vote of thanks and then uh get to<br>the staff club for some drinks apologies<br>to those who are online who won't be<br>able to join that hopefully you've got<br>some refreshments at hand that you can<br>enjoy um Pro promotion to Professor is a<br>big deal at the University of atago as<br>it is in any uh major research Le<br>University and we like to celebrate that<br>by inviting the promoted Professor to<br>profess to their Community about the<br>things and the people that have brought<br>them to that place promotion requires<br>sustained outstanding leadership and<br>performance across the three main areas<br>of academic life across teaching<br>research and service and in Ivan we have<br>seen that demonstrate demonstrated to a<br>high degree and you'll see that<br>reflected tonight um in particular I'm<br>um very uh inspired by some of the<br>things that Ivan does uh in his own<br>words in work that straddles basic<br>Sciences through to clinical uh clinical<br>research and application that commitment<br>to to teaching and teaching students to<br>go onto successful careers planning uh<br>that uh careers in Academia are as<br>equally valued as careers in clinical<br>practice as in commercial uh research or<br>translation uh really exemplifies the<br>kind of work that should be happening uh<br>with people in disciplines uh that have<br>uh outcomes for people at their their<br>heart<br>um the um the the collaborative nature<br>of your research and your engagement<br>with postgraduate research is also<br>exemplified the fact that you work with<br>some of our leading chemists here and I<br>notice some of our Chemists in the<br>audience uh people like Dave LaRon but<br>also through National networks people<br>like Dame Margaret brimble is notable<br>the fact that you connect with leading<br>clinicians and I see some of those here<br>in in the work in your um work around<br>cardiovascular and renal issues and did<br>I see a late arrival from Rob Walker so<br>some of your your great uh collaborators<br>are here so look without further Ado um<br>please accept our most heartfelt<br>congratulations on behalf of the<br>university for this most well-deserved<br>promotion and I'd now like to invite<br>Professor Katherine day to give a more<br>detailed introduction to your lecture<br>thank you very much<br>so is that right uh yes so OTA ctoa uh<br>good evening and welcome I'm Katherine<br>day uh the deputy Dean and as Richard<br>has already indicated uh Lisa sends her<br>uh apologies sincere apologies in fact<br>because uh she texted me very early this<br>morning at 6 o' I know if she's sick why<br>is she texting me at 6 o' um to say<br>she's unwell anyway um so it's my<br>pleasure to provide a brief in<br>introduction I think I'll cover some of<br>the same territory and points that<br>Richard's um highlighted but also a few<br>other things so firstly uh we are very<br>lucky uh to have Ivan as a member of the<br>aago community where he's made a really<br>a number of significant contributions in<br>all spheres of what we would expect for<br>an academic um so Ivan hail's from the<br>UK and I think he completed his<br>undergraduate studies at the University<br>of Sunderland uh followed by a PhD and I<br>looked with managed to find the title<br>which is ASL compounds endogenous<br>modifiers of intracellular myocardial<br>function um so I think that was the<br>start of a translational research<br>Journey which has continued uh on till<br>now uh following his PhD he um uh moved<br>to London and he had eight years at the<br>Royal Brompton and hairfield hospitals<br>at the national Heart and Lung Institute<br>which is part of Imperial College of<br>London I think I've got that right it<br>seems quite a mouthful of a place um and<br>he was there first as a a post-doctoral<br>fellow and then as a research scientist<br>and all the time focusing on clinical<br>management and I think this time really<br>uh sort of established uh uh Ivan's<br>long-standing research and interest in<br>uh cardi preventive interventions that I<br>think we'll really hear a lot more<br>tonight so uh that's the foundation of<br>the research that followed and so in<br>2001 I came to otago and he's really<br>contributed right across research<br>teaching Administration since then and<br>as we expect for someone who's been<br>promoted to Professor he's published<br>widely uh with more than uh 50<br>Publications but he's also uh secured<br>patents for his research and uh some<br>people at otago I know have struggled to<br>to do this so this is really an a good<br>achievement of Ivans and should be<br>congratulated and um his main patent is<br>uh now got being granted full status in<br>the US and in Europe and in Australia<br>with third party takeup so that's quite<br>a significant achievement and so Ivan<br>should certainly be congratulated for<br>that and so at the ah well there we<br>go why<br>not indeed uh so Ivan's highly<br>collaborative and we've already heard<br>that from Richard uh with multiple<br>groups involved and I think we<br>especially want to mention Haro tago and<br>the value of uh supporting networks that<br>really make a difference uh to people's<br>research lives and be part of a<br>community and so uh harot tago has been<br>a good part of uh and sort of a home for<br>Ivan some of Ivan's work and um I guess<br>I also wanted to note that Ivan has had<br>a number of students and he's had three<br>students PhD students get exceptional<br>thesis that's really quite an<br>achievement and again I think it speaks<br>to the inspiration and encouragement<br>that Ivan provides to students so it's<br>really done uh a great job with student<br>supervision and mentoring so all this<br>research takes money we all know that we<br>require money to do things and Ivan's<br>had a strong record of uh funding um<br>with success in uh both HRC mden fund<br>and MB so uh as well as a number of<br>other uh foundational grants which have<br>I think secured the path through which<br>we might hear more about um lastly I<br>just want to touch on teaching Ivan's a<br>great teacher uh he's passionate uh<br>about uh ensuring uh courses run well<br>and he's had a number of leadership<br>roles and so particularly in the med Med<br>program where he con has convened or<br>still convenes the respiratory Block in<br>elm2 and that block has been uh voted<br>the top block several times so I think<br>that again getting awards from the med<br>students is again not easy so well done<br>um and he's also for I think five years<br>been associate Dean medicine for<br>biomedical Sciences so that that's a uh<br>a significant role uh taking on<br>leadership roles for the school and<br>involves lots of committees lots of long<br>meetings so we thank Ivan for his<br>service uh as associate in am and I know<br>he's passed the bat on on for that now<br>um again uh I guess Ivan also has had a<br>significant roles within pharmacology<br>and leading providing a leadership role<br>in Pharmacology so lots of service um<br>but out he's as well as service Beyond<br>his Department Ivan's been a great<br>servant to his Department as being<br>Deputy head of department for a number<br>of years and now uh being the head of<br>Department of pharmacology so he's he's<br>he's been busy and doing lots of the<br>activity that are required for the<br>functioning of a university so please<br>join me in welcoming Professor Ivan<br>samon to give his an AAL Professor roal<br>lecture which is entitled drugs for the<br>Brokenhearted are developing new<br>therapeutic agents for heart disease<br>Ivan thank you Katherine thank you<br>Richard um and that I think we should<br>finish and go home now there not very<br>much I can say um t aoto t aoto tacot<br>Kar Co Ivan s coo Ina now now my har my<br>so welcome thank you all for coming here<br>tonight I'm I'm amazed there's so many<br>familiar faces colleagues that I uh<br>appreciate work you've done uh the<br>support you've given let me start off by<br>saying thank you to uh Joanne uh my wife<br>who is also my um uh collaborator in so<br>many of these papers um thank you for<br>coming here uh my daughter Joanne and as<br>Richard said my son is unfortunately<br>away but he can make up for it later<br>on<br>um so let me start off by um giving you<br>of where we're at<br>okay so to all those colleagues who work<br>in<br>medicine this is going to sound very<br>familiar so I do apologize if I'm going<br>to bore you but um it all started with a<br>heart sorry Rob not a kidney but a<br>heart um it's just a mere pump that<br>pushes blood around the body right and<br>through the kidneys well this is my<br>grandfather's heart to be be um accurate<br>this is a heart model that stood on my<br>grandfather's desk and when I was a<br>child I used to go in and<br>uh look at these models and um gosh kind<br>of reminds me um of this every time I go<br>into the anatomy Museum same sort of<br>display um so I used to ask a lot of<br>questions about how these works you know<br>most kids would play with Lego I I kind<br>of had this fascination with things like<br>this as well I wanted to see how things<br>you know work nuts and Bs and then I<br>um went and ruined at all I had um<br>a few um ideas about what experiments<br>should look like so I devised my own one<br>of which um uh surrounded this creature<br>over here um which um happened to be uh<br>sitting on my desk um and uh with an<br>Intex Stinger so I uh being this<br>10-year-old child uh nasty piece of work<br>took the uh the sack and stinger out and<br>then wondered if and this was my<br>hypothesis would it work if I uh replied<br>it into a volunteer luckily my brother<br>was standing by and um completely uh<br>unexpecting what would happen next I I<br>took a pair of forceps um that um um you<br>know because we were a medical family<br>forp around the place right so he took a<br>pair of forceps and injected the Stinger<br>into him lo and behold unsurprisingly<br>perhaps uh the the the uh the poison<br>worked it did produce a massive uh<br>histaminergic response and um I learned<br>two things one is you you took this<br>thinger out of a wasp you could produce<br>a pharmacological response in your uh<br>subject and the second one was the<br>importance of getting prior informed<br>consent my f father gave me that okay so<br>um so at that stage my father was in um<br>we we were in<br>kingslin and uh he uh moved to uh the<br>role in um<br>leester um as an obstetrician um of<br>course my mother was slightly<br>overwhelmed with the these two boys so<br>um not<br>unsurprisingly we uh were sent to a<br>boarding school so um and my my brother<br>never forgot that but um<br>we um so yeah showing right picture over<br>here so um we were on the border of the<br>smallest county in England Rutland it's<br>beautiful place well I think it is is<br>famous for quite a few things um<br>rackliff was a formative experience for<br>me in that uh we um had a lot of sports<br>uh perhaps not so academically demanding<br>but um a lot of sports and that I<br>enjoyed as a boy growing up so<br>um there's Rutland uh you can see it in<br>the Red Dot line there's a big water<br>park in the middle well actually it's a<br>lake um with some sunken Villages um and<br>it's famous for a few things so if you<br>um think of Melton roay Pork Pies the<br>proper ones come from uh um Melton and<br>there is one shop that serves these and<br>this was Christmas tradition also a few<br>other Christmas traditions um salt and<br>cheese and and um rles beer when I got<br>older obviously obviously when I got<br>older but um and the other thing that<br>surprised a lot of tourists to the town<br>was the size of our horses we had this<br>is Oak Great Hall and um uh there's all<br>these um tributes provided by Nobles and<br>and so on and they hung on the hall<br>walls uh and they go right after the<br>present day uh no horses were involved<br>but it's a good trick to play on<br>tourists as they come in<br>town so um as Richard and Katherine said<br>I then um uh basically was looking at uh<br>a choice of careers and um<br>I uh had some thought but eventually I<br>settled on pharmacology now my father uh<br>three generations of<br>clinicians um want to tell me different<br>um and so did my father's friends why<br>would you pick pharmacology okay it is<br>the hardest course going right most<br>medical students fail pharmacology don't<br>you D do that right so um it's uh it was<br>something that I wanted to um prove I<br>was capable of doing and Excel that and<br>so I went to the University of<br>Sunderland um and at that<br>point I met um uh after done my degree<br>uh I met this gentleman over here<br>Professor Mike speding he's a major<br>calcium signaling player uh was at the<br>time um and um I'll I'll talk about my<br>research in a second but um effectively<br>I did my degree did my honors and opioid<br>research and then spent uh a research<br>internship at Stockton hospital um uh<br>looking at uh prot troman times I was<br>there to study probably uh quite early<br>on um the impact of liver injury and<br>drugs and health on um Protomen times<br>and INR so with warring quite<br>interesting to me at the time I also had<br>the free rain of the Pathology<br>Department so that was enjoyable I got<br>invited to attend post moms and surgical<br>procedures and uh gained a lot of<br>experience and it stood me well my uh um<br>my research began uh in my PhD with this<br>idea that lipid metabolize and G just<br>you know this um can build up so you got<br>these in inhibition of Beats oxidation<br>when hearts are denied oxygen in esia<br>you get bu a buildup of these<br>metabolites and they can impact the<br>heart so<br>um you know that mitochondria damaged in<br>heart subjected to schem Fusion so I<br>spent a good deal of my time trying to<br>replicate that injury in mitochondria so<br>I isolated these uh almost intact<br>mitochondria and then subjected them to<br>high levels of calcium and to lipid<br>metabolites spent a lot of time down<br>looking at electron micrographs okay so<br>um nearly R my eyesight but there you go<br>we we got these mitochondria that look<br>like the ones in the pictures above in<br>the intact Hearts um so yes calcium and<br>lipid metabolites were all responsible<br>for for some of that damage but also<br>what I discovered was that if you use<br>cyclosporin a the immunosuppressant you<br>could also block what was then called<br>the<br>mitochondrial um pore that this<br>non-specific pore that was sitting on on<br>the uh in a membrane of mitochondria and<br>if you loaded the mitochondria with um<br>calcium they would absorb it um and then<br>uh it would be released eventually but<br>if you put cyclosporin a it prolonged it<br>and then the addition of parol COA in<br>this case uh one of the lipid<br>metabolites um actually promoted an<br>earlier opening the pool and faster<br>release with higher concentrations and<br>that's reflected in this diagram over<br>here where um you've got Pomo COA over<br>here producing a rapid release of<br>calcium um but if you add um the the uh<br>new<br>which is a local anesthetic or<br>cyclosporin a you stretch that time out<br>so cyclosporin a was um<br>effectively slowing down the release of<br>calcium so three years of hard work and<br>it bow down to this diagram over here<br>where oxidated stress promoted poor<br>opening um if we used<br>um lipids uh lipid metabolites uh we we<br>would increase a rate of Po opening if<br>on the other hand you added cypor a over<br>here that would bind to cyop Fillin and<br>prevent The cyclophilin Binding to the<br>PO so you prevented culture release or<br>slowed it down so that was interesting<br>in itself that Poe eventually became<br>known as the mitochondrial permeability<br>transition Poe um which is now an every<br>textbook um and people like uh Crompton<br>and so on made um quite quite a lot of<br>um noise about it it's certainly uh<br>valuable um one of my colleagues Derek<br>Yellen and uh Derek heny heny sorry had<br>gone on to trial using cyclus porin as a<br>conditioning agent to protect hearts in<br>advance of his chemic injury and they<br>got a lot of success but unfortunately<br>cyclosporin has a one trick effect so<br>I'm going to try and show you something<br>else<br>at the end of my PhD I met this lady<br>over here Joanne who's sitting sitting<br>in front and six months later I left I<br>went down to London sorry Joan I do<br>apologize um but she did try and find<br>ways to kill me in the process so this<br>is um us whitewater rafting uh on the<br>zambesi uh just uh below Vic Falls yes<br>we did silly things then I still do<br>silly things right Kine um and um I I<br>can't tell you how many grade five uh<br>Rapids are on that but we went down it<br>with a skilled hel Helmsman um and the<br>pair of legs sitting over there or<br>rather standing out there that's Joanne<br>okay there me just about to go in uh we<br>csize at least twice on on that uh<br>Journey uh amazing place if you stayed<br>in White Water you fine if you were in<br>The Still Water the crocodiles so just a<br>point for anybody trying to do this in<br>future so um I uh also got this uh<br>position uh at the North Park Institute<br>for medical research and um this was to<br>look at organ transplantation Barry<br>Fuller um Tim Bates and Colin uh green<br>were where uh where my mentors colum was<br>the director of The Institute it became<br>the Griffin Institute and the job over<br>there was to look at organ<br>preservation how damaged do kidneys or<br>Liv become as a consequence of old cold<br>storage and trying to improve that the<br>outcomes uh in that by adjusting those<br>times so and I'll be brief about this<br>because we did publish quite a few<br>papers um mostly mitochondria but<br>amongst my other techniques I had to<br>learn how to transplant kidneys uh and<br>livers in rats and as you can see my<br>sewing had to be extremely uh refined I<br>still can't sew a button properly save<br>my life but I could do this and you can<br>see in this uh blood uh uh this field<br>without any blood in it there's a renal<br>artery and renal vein over there and<br>they're both Anastos and uh anastomosing<br>the urer I relied on Sandra to do in<br>fact most of this work was done by by<br>Sandra who also taught these<br>microsurgical courses for uh um house<br>so um we also did other things as well<br>and in fact I was involved with work at<br>raft restoration and function and also<br>with the blonde Meo Institute and I<br>didn't realize at the time that the MEO<br>Institute was named after RG Mao akii so<br>that's my first shot at it okay so we<br>did cardiomyoplasty which is in human<br>term sorry late terms a muscle wrap a<br>heart wrap we took the uh latissmus<br>dorsi muscle and used it as a pedicle<br>and put it around the heart rubbed it<br>around put clenbutrol into these animals<br>to increase the force contraction and<br>use it as a an muscle a ventricular<br>assist device okay uh put a pacemaker on<br>it and it worked but um it's not ideal<br>and there are uh better things out now<br>so that was something that we um did<br>work on we also worked on um monitoring<br>pth graphs in uh facial reconstruction<br>surgery and in um uh breast<br>reconstruction so um I had quite a lot<br>of uh patient uh time in terms of<br>monitoring uh revascularization we also<br>did some esic cardor protection work in<br>rats and in sheep models and by the way<br>this is uh the the surgical TI this is a<br>large animal surgical theater that<br>served us very well so it's well<br>equipped we need to work on this than<br>right so um I then uh uh finish off my<br>work over there with this paper which um<br>was the first uh real in uh involvement<br>in uh carbon monoxide and as you can see<br>um we looked at ways to increase carbon<br>monoxide release in uh in animals but<br>also in tissue so this was done<br>specifically in aosa we induce the<br>enzyme hemox which produces carbon<br>monoxide yes we do produce carbon<br>monoxide it doesn't isn't just there to<br>kill people we then um uh looked at the<br>vas of dilatory effects and um this team<br>of many people went on to produce uh<br>molecular evidence supported hology and<br>so on um just to let you know James<br>Clark is head of physiology at King's<br>College London um and David axon Martin<br>Beasley are um quite senior uh<br>specialist surgeons in plastic surgery<br>and general surgery and I really enjoyed<br>my time with them and they stay um uh my<br>friends so I had uh discovered that<br>carbon monoxide produced this gu cyclas<br>induced vas<br>dilation um but it's gone on since there<br>let let me put it this way we I<br>arrogantly uh Richard you mentioned<br>nature I arrogantly submitted this paper<br>to Nature first and they said don't be<br>stupid carbon monoxide can't be aase<br>dilate it's toxic it kills people right<br>so we<br>uh rewrote it slightly put into the brid<br>pharmacology J Mitchell sned it up um<br>the title appears on the front cover of<br>the um Journal it's had over<br>340 citations so um not bad for a toxic<br>chemical it's also one we describe as<br>the um Swiss army knife of um signaling<br>Mo molecules because it has so many uh<br>different effects so moving on quickly<br>from<br>there um or not yeah there we go so then<br>my next move was to uh the national<br>Heart and Lung Institute at the Royal<br>bronton and herfield hospital so I had a<br>number of different uh roles over here<br>um but the person over here is Professor<br>s magdi yakob who at that time was the<br>foremost heart lung transplant surgeon<br>uh pretty much in the world um and he<br>still has my respect for all the work he<br>did um so he interviewed me for the<br>position at 2 o'cl in the morning okay<br>between lists that was the only time he<br>had available and he continued to see me<br>between list and that's generally meant<br>uh the we hours in the morning because<br>that's when most most transplant work<br>tends to be done that's when most donor<br>hearts and lungs become available um so<br>Magi was a pretty formidable character<br>he demanded at all his staff um Matt his<br>same very stringent qualies this is K<br>Suzuki um who was card thoracic surgeon<br>turned researcher at the time Karen had<br>come from Asaka um he's now professor at<br>the William Harvey Institute and rard<br>smolansky who I worked with as well and<br>the two appeared on a lot of my papers<br>so we published in journals like um<br>circulation uh the American journal<br>phology in um more circulation journals<br>there the other thing I'll point out is<br>this this was preformative training the<br>model that magdi encouraged was one that<br>uh were researchers uh scientists and<br>clinician collaborated together but also<br>that um we had this uh Advanced<br>postgraduate training for junior<br>clinicians okay but also you can see any<br>new scientific advances Journal clubs<br>serve to train uh clinicians and my area<br>was to bring in Pharmacology to that but<br>also um as a pharmacologist I spent a<br>lot of time on the wars providing<br>teaching and support for um self and<br>teams um found time to get married<br>somewhere in all of this so thank you<br>Joanne um hope you still happy with this<br>but one of the things Joanne did was<br>point out she'd come to New Zealand in<br>the early 1990s 993 92 yeah and um she<br>missed out on coming down to denan and<br>what she wanted to see was the albatross<br>Colony over here so for some stupid<br>reason I said yes okay so um we we came<br>down had a um a great time traveling<br>around New Zealand it's a beautiful<br>place uh in the late 1990s this was 2000<br>uh we enjoyed ourselves and um I saw an<br>Edward having seen the the Atara Medical<br>School uh being signposted then I also<br>recognized that I'd read some of the<br>papers from uto medical school okay like<br>Horus MK and so on rob you know these<br>characters as well they um were salian<br>figures in our training and um I had<br>applied and strangely enough um I<br>arrived over here so two things one is<br>the Adams Building was still still there<br>um I was promised when I came over for<br>interview that um it be um demolished in<br>a short period of time didn't happen I<br>promise it<br>will I've got something at the end that<br>might help this but yes so um I was<br>appointed a lecturer in Pharmacology in<br>2001 and this gentleman over here was my<br>mentor uh in so this is David Clark he<br>was um uh responsible for uh not just<br>training me but also bringing in um the<br>uh phaco vigilance aspects that were<br>profoundly important in uh the way drugs<br>are um uh administered but also in terms<br>of monitoring any adverse effects so<br>David uh kindled that interest to me<br>kindled an interest in teaching medicine<br>over here um I took on the respiratory<br>module in 2008 and then uh shortly after<br>cintio took the uh both years of the<br>pharmacology vertical module that became<br>the clinical pharmacology module um in<br>2019 I was appointed as the associate<br>Dean uh and I enjoyed my time over there<br>and Kurt if I could possibly ask you to<br>let me have it back you can take over HD<br>farmacology that would be great<br>but but I really enjoyed that uh<br>teaching that that component I still<br>teach um medicine is is the primary so I<br>became um mainly because I was lat to<br>2024 um so talk about the research uh<br>briefly as well because there's so many<br>people sank over here um in uh 2005 we<br>publish this paper and this was largely<br>due to the work of um Rob Smith and Mike<br>Murphy uh he was a Cambridge at the time<br>having left biochemistry uh here um I'd<br>actually struck Mike Murphy before at<br>London as well so it's a small world and<br>Joanne and the other person uh over here<br>is Vicky Adam who did uh the work as a<br>PhD student and Carolyn porches and<br>these people um uh were responsible for<br>taking Mau Q which is this um coenzyme Q<br>um basically Ted so it's an antioxidant<br>it's sted to a triphenol phosphonium<br>group over here and because there's a<br>very high positive charge it's<br>sequestered into mitochondria so as a<br>consequence you get accumulation of this<br>antioxidant within the<br>mitochondria and um if you subject the<br>mitochondria to um eskia reperfusion so<br>we loaded this up in in rats took the<br>hearts out subjected them to uh a<br>cessation of perfusion so esia and then<br>reperfused afterwards mimicking an acute<br>bi cardial eske profusion injury okay we<br>saw uh protection um so this is the<br>before esia and we use controls over<br>here mq treated animals but also the<br>individual components of the drug itself<br>in isolation as any good pharmacologist<br>would do we wanted to look at po both<br>negative and possitive controls and we<br>had uh oh sorry<br>poter options yeah we we l to see if we<br>could protect the hearts<br>um so um if you look at the wide bars<br>maq actually increased the develop<br>pressure in the hearts uh against the<br>Baseline<br>controls um I'm sorry I've just lost the<br>pointer on this I know Joan keeps<br>telling me never to fiddle with things<br>did ah there we go right okay so there's<br>the the wide bars and you get this<br>increase um we also saw an increase in<br>uh protection of the mitochondria and<br>it's um don't worry I won't be asking<br>questions later on but if you've got a<br>schem refusion injury like I showed you<br>before you've got this this damage to<br>The myocardium the mitochondria swell up<br>so on 14 days of Prior um uh treatment<br>if I recall correctly um resulted in no<br>damage to the mitochondria but when we<br>exposed them to schem Fusion injury we<br>had Fairly good protection in those<br>hearts at least structure Wise by the<br>way the mq was originally diluted in<br>alcohol and who would believe it rats<br>don't believe uh don't uh behave like<br>students they don't like alcohol so we<br>had to find other<br>things okay um<br>so here's something that uh might uh<br>startle you and it's something that<br>impressed us this is from 2008 a bro a<br>diagram over here so this is from<br>variant and you can see that most<br>patients fail to adhere to the drug<br>medication either because they don't<br>like drugs or because they have adverse<br>effects that they don't like or because<br>they're not properly<br>um consulted in what the Drug's going to<br>do to to them and why they need to take<br>it that's really important so uh Rob's<br>involved in this study um and by the way<br>it's I've seen papers now indicate 50 to<br>60% of patients failed to take the<br>medication at one year right so Rob was<br>involved in this study and we took uh uh<br>a transgenic rat that we had that was<br>hypertensive we made it Diabetic Type 1<br>diabetic so it had high glucose levels<br>um and neop and the idea was that and<br>this was going around a study going<br>around the time<br>Rob um and Jerry Wilkins were interested<br>in um the uh renal inovation proposal<br>and there was some small clinical trials<br>at the time but no real definition we<br>took these rats burnt off the um uh<br>nerves going to and from the kidney to<br>the brain so we severed that connection<br>um and as a consequence um the damaged<br>kidney that resulted in the diabetic<br>nephropathy was not um affected so it<br>was not able to relay messages to the<br>brain neither could the brain then<br>increase sympathetic tone to vasculature<br>or to the<br>kidney long story short if you look at<br>this at the top um and we've got uh yimo<br>and ingred Thomson nurse and Jed Davis<br>and Rob and Joan over here in this and<br>if you denate the noral glycemic the<br>non-diabetic animals you get a drop of<br>blood pressure If you inovate the<br>diabetic innovated animals you had a<br>more profound drop in blood pressure<br>these are already quite uh elevated the<br>the systolic blood pressure went up to<br>220 so it's pretty high the other thing<br>I have to say is that human had to den<br>den uh<br>Den inovat sorry these Ares called that<br>had to be a word um that uh every 3<br>weeks so uh just to make sure they<br>didn't grow<br>back Y is now uh not surprisingly well<br>away from renal nerves he's a senior<br>scientist at a company in Sydney and<br>doing very<br>well um just to bring you after clinical<br>significance um the European Society of<br>uh hypertension has advocated renal<br>denervation as a Class 2 uh<br>recommendation now and they've given<br>approval for patients with uncontr<br>controlled hypertension the FDA has<br>given approval for two devices and one<br>one of them is the Simplicity device the<br>other one is Paragon device the idea is<br>that sorry Paradise device now is that<br>they they produce symmetrical Burns<br>through the internal renal artery don't<br>have to open the patient and turn the<br>renal nerves off you just burn them<br>using radio waves or uh<br>we also looked at the importance of<br>cardiopathy um in St of epilepticus and<br>it's you know this this was work that we<br>wanted to focus on um it started off as<br>a wager between uh Steve car and myself<br>some of you remember Steve here um don't<br>he's not here tonight is he good right<br>great so um Steve uh didn't believe<br>anything south of the brain existed I<br>pointed out to him that um the kid the<br>heart and kidney were very much under<br>CNS control and if you had recurring<br>seizures you could produce uh damage to<br>the heart resulting from the uh<br>tachicardia that resulted so if you look<br>at status<br>epilepticus um uh it's a major uh worry<br>in patients with severe seizure and it<br>can lead to cardic arhas mainly because<br>it causes these substrates for aritmia<br>to form this<br>um uh rhym formation over here and you<br>can see this blue fibrotic stain uh with<br>inflammatory cells in here so this is<br>one we prepared earlier if you like<br>there's a lot of apoptotic cells and so<br>on so this was a model that uh Steve had<br>developed we put telemeters into these<br>animals measured ECG and EEG<br>simultaneously and uh morgane was<br>responsible for doing U most of this<br>work um and we've got um we confirmed<br>cardiac injury um in there and then we<br>went to look at a pharmacological<br>interventions where it becomes important<br>to the title is um the whole component<br>of broken heart okay broken heart is a<br>form of heart failure if you like it is<br>important to recognize this um in that<br>we have um a sympathetic storm either<br>produced by the seizure itself or by the<br>um by stress by grief by sometimes<br>illicit drugs um you get this release of<br>uh<br>cames um that pour onto the heart and<br>produce these Adverse Events that result<br>in uh these ECG changes uh and changes<br>in the wall structure so much so to cut<br>a long story short um in some patients<br>you see arhian in and that in some<br>patients tuas subus like syndrome is<br>produced where you've got this<br>ballooning of The ventricle now it's<br>called takubo because um the uh Japanese<br>clinicians that uh noted that noted the<br>resemblance to this octopus pot over<br>here so fishermen use this they put a<br>pot on the bottom of the ocean and<br>octopus climb into it and they pull it<br>up shape looks like this POS over here<br>um and in small percentage of cases with<br>development so uh we taugh if you've got<br>a a large um release of Camin what<br>better than to try and block it using<br>beta blockers or else to use clonidine<br>to<br>prevent outflow or else channel<br>blockers to protect the heart<br>um and more gain and Rebecca Millan and<br>Dominic Perry sorry uh was main I really<br>appreciate the work so I'm giving you<br>photograph over here that you enjoyed um<br>so and uh they show that if you put AOL<br>in it offers better protection than<br>clonidine um in reducing status<br>epilepticus but what was also more<br>important in a head-to-head study we<br>looked at tenolol and the Asen which is<br>a traditional drug used for status<br>epilepticus and<br>chol uh in combination with uh the been<br>produce cardiac protection so the natur<br>result is and I'm not putting this all<br>down to us but if you say uh that um now<br>there's a significant amount of<br>attention being poured onto status<br>epicus and cardiac injury and to<br>um tuuu syndrome beta blockers are are<br>now regarded as really uh promising<br>agents um soas Inhibitors as<br>well okay so back to carbon monoxide<br>um we'd left it alone mainly because of<br>all the issues I raised about Co Gas<br>being toxic right why would you want to<br>give this to a patient well if you use<br>Co Gas by inhalation there's a lot of<br>issues it's unwieldy you've got to get<br>it across the respiratory a ways it's<br>got to as Mt B will tell you cross into<br>to the circulation and then get to the<br>uh uh mitochondria at some distant point<br>in your small toe so you got a dilution<br>effects as you go through the really<br>important thing over here is that um we<br>wanted to uh find a better way of doing<br>this and my old collaborator Roberto<br>melini focused at that time on the<br>matello corms uh and on the Boron<br>hydrate compounds and I don't want to do<br>him the service but um these compounds<br>have carbon monoxide in independent<br>effects as well so it's not just Co<br>that's having the effect the compounds<br>themselves have and you look at the<br>structures uh some of you may uh<br>recognize rium in there and rium is a<br>cytotoxic agent okay um the effect the<br>release is unpredictable they uh some of<br>the researchers hadn't used positive<br>coas controls and um this is where we<br>then looked at um the implication so<br>Joanne uh and Ian wurn who was a PhD uh<br>well surgical registr doing a PhD at the<br>time um studied these compounds on<br>cardiomyocytes uh both uh freshly<br>isolated cardiomyocytes and on um cell<br>Lin and show that the carbon monoxide<br>itself didn't have any Toxic effect but<br>the reum sure had um so the uh<br>accumulation of the uh inactive Cor the<br>one that had relea Co Pro<br>cytotoxic um and we consider that to be<br>uh a good paper to submit um it was<br>published well uh the authors of the<br>previous papers weren't too happy with<br>us because we had shown a negative<br>result of the stuff but um if you're<br>interested bingy Wang who's a visiting<br>researcher coming here next week on<br>Monday he'll be talking about carbon<br>monoxide donors and he also has the this<br>proved the quality of those corns so um<br>there's a there's a number of<br>Publications now reinforcing negative<br>effects so let me just remind Rob of the<br>time we spent trying to get Ian to<br>publish up his Pap his Theses and his<br>paper and so on um so Ian left with a<br>skip and a jump and he really was a nice<br>uh bloke very intelligent but he uh left<br>uh and then um went to the UK reentered<br>Sur<br>and decided that um surgery wasn't going<br>to be ideal for him so having told me he<br>never wanted to write another paper in<br>his life or uh write another Caesars<br>he's now the global director for fizer's<br>uh medical<br>um sorry it's a long title I've<br>forgotten but but yeah basically he's<br>earning more money than I am<br>right okay so<br>um uh so we got funding and this was<br>largely due to Joanne uh who uh brought<br>in har Foundation money with me and I<br>the pillow slips on the MB Grant as<br>David Lawson said so they it became a um<br>a very sound uh Grant application I'm<br>grateful to you for that David Lawson um<br>had come up with this structure where um<br>if you uh put these compounds these<br>organic carbon monoxide releasing<br>molecues ules into pH buffer uh which is<br>uh a physiological pH of<br>7.4 um this haly leaving group over here<br>would come off and the bridge carbonal<br>compounds if I can get this right over<br>here uh breaks down to release carbon<br>monoxide and it does so so it releases<br>the spend byproduct and releases carbon<br>monoxide um and this is where Marg<br>margar brimble was involved as well so<br>yeah there's a few people on this<br>um so um at that point uh we got the um<br>this most most uh Premier uh journal in<br>New Zealand saying that exhaust gases<br>could benefit heart<br>patients so um we've got a hard<br>Foundation grunt at the same time um and<br>I I still have to get uh the uh the idea<br>that um you can stand behind the car and<br>protect yourself but into my head Okay<br>so<br>quick trips through some points one is<br>that we show that uh if you look at the<br>the um orange blocks over here it shows<br>the byproduct forming within a set time<br>this is true Mass back analysis and BYOD<br>the uh ok 21 itself deteriorated and we<br>got an idea of the half life of the drug<br>so this was about some under a region of<br>15 to 18 minutes no cyto toxicity we<br>expose these<br>drugs uh sorry<br>cells these drugs um and we used a<br>variety of cells not just cardiac cells<br>but kidney cells and so on so there was<br>no uh cytotoxicity you did this for uh 1<br>hour you extended it to 24 hours or even<br>48 Hours well beyond the expected<br>accumulation time you did get some<br>cytotoxicity but it was above the<br>pharmacological<br>dose so then um I uh and Joanne looked<br>at whether the carbon monoxide was<br>getting the cells and Leslie Lawson uh<br>blesser with Dave Lawson's wife got um a<br>bod dippi compound for us and she loaded<br>it well we loaded into the cells and it<br>fluores when it came into contact with<br>carbon monoxide so we pre-loaded it put<br>the Co in the solution the Co Gas got<br>into the cell and we got definition that<br>it was in there um if you look at this<br>much higher concentration over here bp21<br>one the cells are still there but<br>there's no carbon monoxide in any great<br>quantities getting in there remember<br>these cells still have hemox and still<br>monoxide<br>um the chemistry team also produce this<br>fluorescent molecule that when it broke<br>down would uh flues in the blue um the<br>red here would be a misrial trodde that<br>depends upon the membrane uh potential<br>of mitochondria so fluoresces nicely<br>over there you put Co Gas Co the co<br>donor in and by 1880 minutes later it's<br>built up and in the cells and<br>fluorescing in the green now with bod<br>dippy and then it releases and the<br>carbon monoxide gas comes off the blue<br>uh fanin compound if I recall my<br>chemistry correctly cells fluores in the<br>blue so the braak down product is in the<br>cell and the red comes back these are<br>all fused together in terms of images<br>and you've got mitochondria function<br>returning Rachel har Harley was a<br>third-year med student at the time when<br>she did this work and um that led to a<br>publication over here with racial on it<br>um and others as well that were uh<br>involved in this in chemistry had<br>produced other work as well with these<br>compounds that were vital to our<br>requirements so uh small uh step back to<br>carbon monoxide in uh kidney transplants<br>now we want to see if the oams could<br>protect the hearts and yes we got um<br>increased phasal responsiveness so if we<br>use the gold standard University of<br>Wisconsin as control and looked at flow<br>rates and resistance we increase flow<br>rates slightly but not significantly<br>this was 8 degrees okay most organ most<br>tissues don't function greatly at this<br>temperature um but the resistance in the<br>vessels went down so we've got an<br>improved uh perfusion and if you think<br>about it when you take an organ very<br>much like the ones you put in the fridge<br>okay and you store them when they come<br>out they all look blotchy and that's<br>because there's uh poor um perfusion to<br>the organs and that's the problem with<br>with transplanted organs we have to be<br>careful when we reperfuse them so the<br>idea was to put in the U solution that<br>would prolong the life expectancy of the<br>organ storage it would allow us time<br>this is a lifeboard machine um to allow<br>clinicians of scientist time to actually<br>start putting Gene vors in there and<br>manipulating the structure of the kidney<br>um and adapting its ability to be<br>accepted by the recipient as<br>well um and here's one for the med<br>students and the audience um when you<br>add anenson 2 you should get an increase<br>in the um a constriction in the ephant<br>arterials okay and resistance builds up<br>um and in kidneys that are stored at<br>minus sorry at 8 degrees you've got this<br>level but when you had the oam donor you<br>get improved uh responsiveness to ensin<br>2 showing that Angiotensin 2 actually<br>has the ability to improve the<br>pharmacodynamic responsiveness to vasic<br>constrictors even at 8<br>degrees okay<br>um we also show that these drugs are<br>vase dilators very much as the stuff are<br>done in British pharmacology paper uh we<br>OK 21 proved the most potent agent um we<br>could reverse it using gu cyclas<br>Inhibitors that confirmed that gu sa was<br>important vas<br>dilation<br>um so the idea is to get carbon monoxide<br>into cells and around key signal<br>molecules like or signaling pares like<br>gu cycl we don't want it in the uh<br>circulation we want it to get into cells<br>where it can have its effect and not a<br>toxic<br>one so uh few more slides and I promise<br>you I will finish soon when we<br>pre-treated hearts with a vehicle<br>control so in other words untreated okay<br>uh and you can see the left ventricular<br>developed pressure uh measured by<br>putting a balloon in the left ventricle<br>we Expos those hearts to esia and the<br>results after 30 minutes of eskia and 60<br>Minutes of reperfusion where we<br>readministered blood flow well in this<br>case perusing flow into the hearts we<br>got little left entrical develop<br>pressure<br>forming if you pre-treat the hearts with<br>o21 it did two things one is is increase<br>the force contraction these hearts and<br>I'll show you that in a second but it<br>also produce a greater development of<br>pressure between the period where the<br>heart is Contracting at its peak and<br>when it's uh relaxing to its minimum uh<br>level so in other words the blood so The<br>ventricle of the heart can accommodate<br>more blood in that<br>period and that's shown in this um graph<br>over here so we've got significance<br>okay um we got the drugs patented that's<br>great uh took a while to get that done<br>but it was um really useful and um it's<br>as Richard said we we've had this<br>patented in a number of different<br>countries now thanks to the efforts of<br>um David Christensen uh and the oil<br>team um we also got a an HRC Grant to<br>look at this in um<br>2020 and it had two aims to it one is<br>could we protect hearts in advance of an<br>esic and a known esic episode uh in say<br>off pump bypass I'll explain that<br>briefly in a second and the other one is<br>to do this in um an on pump bypass which<br>requires a lot of perfusion pumps uh yes<br>we can do this in a rat but why do it in<br>a rat when you can do it in a sheep yeah<br>okay so sheep sheep have got larger um<br>blood vessels easier to culate um we're<br>working on this um and sorry Dave we we<br>we we uh the uh Wellington Bru faces a<br>major problem because we have a lack of<br>uh a building over there moment we can<br>use um so we were asking the hlc yet for<br>another<br>extension um but Steph TW had done most<br>of the work on these isolated hearts and<br>it was built up on work that uh Rob and<br>Jerry and I had looked at in uh previous<br>studies but Steph although uh and she's<br>not here today so I can say this safely<br>without her smacking me um she um can be<br>a very demanding PhD student and she was<br>uh but she's uh and is uh but she is an<br>excellent surgeon she um had done a lot<br>of this work in Hearts uh um that were<br>exposed to uh Cham liation where there's<br>no occlusion or treated so let me tell<br>you about that so you take um this uh<br>off- pump bypass in a patient the heart<br>is rotated so that the surgeons got<br>access to the cor arteries that they<br>need to bypass to put a blood vessel<br>around for that you need a stable field<br>so you need a positioning arm over here<br>to hold the heart steady but at the same<br>time you need to have the CL ramp that's<br>put around the coring arteries that are<br>going to be<br>sutured that stretching of The ventricle<br>and positioning and twisting also<br>produces an esic episode so we knew it<br>was going to happen and what Steph did<br>was model that by putting a ligature<br>around a major car artery producing the<br>same level of esia esic injury and then<br>rusing it same as would happen when you<br>release these clamps so the drugs the o<br>54 21 had no effect uh on on the heart<br>when there was no eskia but when you put<br>into the Sha into the Curr liated mode<br>now there's esia you've got this massive<br>increase in this biomarker of cardiac<br>injury this is cardiac troponin I it's a<br>clinical<br>marker um o 54 brought it down but Oak<br>21 reduced this um to the same level as<br>Baseline so the drug Works we've got a<br>lot of other data Sean's looking at the<br>um Echo data as well in this um and<br>there's there's a number of things we<br>still need to complete but uh there's a<br>lot of histology that's confirmative and<br>Jan's done the um uh imuno labeling on<br>it as<br>well<br>so couple last things one is we also<br>love that whether OK 21 can increase the<br>force of contraction but also increase<br>cing sensitivity and this work was done<br>by Fergus pay who's just left for um a<br>postdoctural position at the HRI in<br>Sydney<br>um so he showed that ok 21 10 Micro<br>molers in uh push this curve to the left<br>so increasing the sensitivity of these<br>isolated myofilaments to calcium by the<br>way I should say that this is a cardic<br>Marite it's been attached to um uh a<br>transducer and to an anchor over here<br>this is work that Chris baly and Gary<br>Duffy had brought in and I'm very<br>grateful to them because it showed that<br>ok 21 increased the C sensitivity of the<br>myofilament um we also did this with<br>carbon monoxide gas at the same<br>concentration and the red line shows<br>exactly the same same<br>effect um Jerry Wilkins was also uh<br>involved in this work and I'm grateful<br>for his insights um what we did see is<br>that if you took the hearts and exposed<br>them to the okm 21 AT3 in the blue and<br>10 micromolar you got an increase in the<br>left ventricular develop pressure so it<br>increase the force of contraction so<br>this is a positive inotrope and suggest<br>that the drug can be useful in uh<br>increasing pressure resp response is<br>increasing the force of uh ventricular<br>out uh outflow uh following<br>surgery and much safer too so I'm going<br>to finish with uh this slide so this is<br>going back to my therapeutic teaching<br>I'm pretty passionate about uh<br>pharmacology some of you would know<br>can't think why but um uh we've got uh<br>um a wel of researchers over here and a<br>welt of good<br>teachers um the last thing I want to do<br>is see pharmacology being diluted in the<br>medical program I want to see it being<br>built up I want to see it remain at the<br>heart of uh the way we uh train our<br>students why<br>because you will see and I have seen<br>patients being<br>uh uh prescribed badly let let me put it<br>this way um there are um uh situations<br>where patients should have been better<br>monitored for drugs that have been given<br>taking into account the kidney function<br>the cardia function and so on doesn't<br>always happen very well so we need to<br>make sure that our teaching remains up<br>to date our lecturers are um experience<br>in uh this delivery we you should use<br>more case based demonstration so we need<br>to have time within the medical program<br>to do that giving a dry lecture isn't<br>always the best way way of teaching<br>reinforcing clear messaging and<br>prescribing that has to be done uh at<br>levels not just with an Elm or Alm but<br>even above and using research and<br>practice based informed teaching and the<br>last thing I'm going to say is we have<br>good pharmacologists good Pharmacy<br>people pharmacologists and pharmaco<br>vigilance people here okay there's a lot<br>of farm in the titles we all do<br>different things but we should be<br>working together to produce a better<br>outcome for our students and our<br>clinicians and their training so I'm<br>going to stop with a couple last slides<br>one is these are the acknowledgements<br>for all the people who have worked with<br>us this is uh mostly New Zealand teams<br>um all the people that have supported us<br>and I'm very grateful to all of them for<br>the work they do and some of the uh even<br>some of the people that have made me<br>pull my hair out and I've said that<br>third year Elm as well but um<br>so I'm going to thank my family uh and<br>by that I also include not just my wife<br>and my children thank you Laura for<br>attending but as you know uh jock is in<br>my will that's my dog over here he keeps<br>me happy he's always there when I come<br>home um my students and researchers who<br>have stretched me as much as possible in<br>a good way my<br>mentors um here in the UK my colleagues<br>my department staff thank you very much<br>for all your support<br>and um last word and that is um I got<br>really excited when I saw this little<br>yellow Digger coming towards the Adams<br>Building and I hoped that it would spell<br>the end unfortunately didn't happen so<br>okay so I'll leave that with the funders<br>gathering maybe it's harto Taro that's<br>Gathering<br>oh<br>J<br>take<br>it's me again so normally it's the of<br>the<br>sorry I did the wrong thing so uh<br>normally it's the head of the department<br>that gives the vote of thanks but as<br>Ivan's the head of department and<br>everyone else is sick um Last Man<br>Standing was me so um and I and so Ivan<br>please help out because I think we I<br>might need your help with the thanks um<br>so it's uh I think we're really seen a<br>great uh lecture tonight uh with Ivan's<br>passion clearly on display I think uh if<br>uh such enthusiasm and real focus on<br>clinical outcomes has really been it's<br>been a highlight to to see that and I<br>think we we've seen a journey of Ivan<br>coming from uh Sunderland to London and<br>then on to here and all started by the<br>heart on his father our grandfather's<br>desk but I really don't think he's moved<br>very far from that heart um it it's I<br>think it's come along with him perhaps<br>so um even though he didn't go and into<br>the medical career that some in his<br>family perhaps wanted I it seems like<br>he's not really moved very far and so um<br>they should be very proud of you um and<br>I think uh I guess to tonight we've seen<br>a real emphasis on the close connection<br>between uh clinicians and uh research<br>scientists and then the involvement of<br>uh graduate students whether they be<br>science-based or clinical graduate<br>students and I think uh it it's really<br>uh sums up a university really nicely<br>how everything uh comes together and<br>really can make a difference so it's<br>it's a really nice academic Journey uh<br>and I guess highlighting the impact of<br>translational science and we've seen<br>from carbon monoxide to mitoq to oom I<br>was a little bit losing track of some of<br>the uh the different things but always<br>at the connecting them all up was a real<br>clinical Focus so than thank you very<br>much Ivan uh it's my job to<br>uh shake your hand so thank you thanks<br>very<br>much so so I really think that we'll<br>need you to come and do another<br>installment in five or 10 years we want<br>to see what uh where things have gone in<br>the next part of the journey and I'll<br>well what a what an evening
