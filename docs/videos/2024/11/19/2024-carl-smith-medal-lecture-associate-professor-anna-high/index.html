In law, judges must assess the probative value of evidence before it can be relied upon as proof in a trial. In academia, various metrics are commonly used as evidence of success. In both contexts, ‘common sense’ assumptions about proof can be questioned.<br><br>The Carl Smith Medal is awarded annually to recognise the outstanding scholarly achievement of researchers in the early stages of their career. The medal is accompanied by a $5,000 grant for personal scholarly development. It is funded by the Rowheath Trust, which was set up by the late Sir Carl Smith who was a prominent Dunedin businessman and member of the University of Otago Council. <br><br>This lecture was recorded Monday, 18 November 2024.</p><h2>Transcript</h2><p style="opacity: 0.9; font-size: 0.8em">Transcripts may be automatically generated and may not be 100% accurate.</p><p>pardon the slight delay uh technical<br>matters were taking<br>president I stand Here the cloak of the<br>people of this place ktima Kahu and<br>Richard good evening everyone I'm<br>Richard Blakey Deputy Vice Chancellor<br>research and Enterprise and it's my<br>great pleasure to welcome you all to<br>this the roei trust award and kith medal<br>lecture to be uh presented by and then<br>the awards and medal to be given to<br>associ Professor anah high from The<br>Faculty of law uh congratulations Anna<br>on a most well-deserved uh award um it's<br>uh my great pleasure to share the<br>celebration of outstanding research<br>achievement with you all friends and<br>Faro of our medal recipient here uh in<br>person and online and in the present and<br>in the future for those that are<br>watching the podcast uh welcome welcome<br>welcome all a particular welcome to uh<br>distinguished guests and and um special<br>friends of Anna Ryan your partner is<br>here thank you for supporting Anna in<br>this uh we have uh Dr reyen sumerville<br>former Chancellor welcome reyen and Lee<br>uh and others uh I think that you may<br>acknowledge during the course of events<br>the order of Ceremonies is that I'll say<br>a few words and invite Professor Shelley<br>Griffith the dean of the faculty of law<br>to introduce Anna for the lecture<br>following the lecture I'll give a<br>summary and vote of thanks and then<br>provided the lecture is of suitable uh<br>impressive nature we will invite the<br>vice Chancellor to present you with your<br>award and medal and a special gift that<br>we um that we might talk about at that<br>time before we retired to the staff club<br>for refreshments and fellowship but<br>first some background on the to the Carl<br>Smith medal and the rohi trust award the<br>purpose of these which began in 2003 and<br>are always awarded together is very<br>clear they are to quote to promote<br>research at the University of atago and<br>to give recognition to outstanding<br>research performance of early career<br>staff which is for those who have been<br>at otago for at least 2 years but have<br>total research career appointments of<br>less than 10 years it's the research<br>experience and not age that is the<br>defining Factor so why an award and a<br>medal well it's very simply one is for<br>the money and one is for the glory the<br>ROI trust established in 1964 to support<br>the work of the University by Kyle Smith<br>a prominent denan businessman and member<br>of the University Council was used to<br>endow a $5,000 research support award<br>that bears the trust name at the same<br>time the university commissioned a medal<br>in Cal's honor as the glory to accompany<br>the<br>money um and it gives the university a<br>very good opportunity to recognize the<br>contributions of Sir Carl and his uh<br>wife Lady Katherine that that made that<br>they made over many years after coming<br>to New Zealand from the Family Estate of<br>roath in Birmingham hence the uh the<br>name the Roe trust award uh and I and<br>the the reason for coming here was uh<br>for operation in one of the other great<br>Denine institutions the Cadbury Factory<br>and I think there is a book that sakal<br>wrote on the history of that<br>institution um the family connection to<br>the university and the ward uh continued<br>um with um sir's daughter Katherine<br>living locally and being a regular<br>attendee at these Awards up until a few<br>years ago and it was a great privilege<br>to be able to invite uh uh Katherine to<br>be able to present the award when she<br>was able uh finally as something with<br>the side so Carl is well is a well-known<br>author not so much for Sweet Success his<br>history of the cadb maker cadb fry<br>Hudson published in<br>1968 but also and we do have a copy here<br>and you will be presented with it um his<br>quirky and humorous T New Zealand from n<br>to zed that we will also present you and<br>you can do with what you wish this is<br>not in uh this is not in press anymore<br>so that maybe a rare item anyway<br>congratulations very much Anna the um<br>the selection panel always had a has a a<br>hard job to do to to look at the wide<br>range of outstanding early career<br>research uh that is undertaken at the<br>University of maker wi selection you are<br>a very very uh good selection and uh<br>we're very pleased to be able to uh<br>present this award to you uh so without<br>further Ado i' would now like like to<br>invite Professor Shelley Griffith to<br>formally introduce you and to invite you<br>to give the 2024 Carl Smith medal<br>lecture thank you very much<br>GTH I'm currently the dean of the<br>faculty of Law and thank you for coming<br>to this evening this a particularly<br>glorious denan evening to celebrate with<br>Anna high and to congratulate her on<br>receiving this<br>award as Dina law I feel it's incumbent<br>upon me to say this is not the first<br>member of the faculty of law in the past<br>20 years who has received this award one<br>is in the audience and at least one I<br>believe is online so if anybody thinks<br>that law is not a place of high quality<br>research you're absolutely wrong and a<br>graduated in law in Chinese from the<br>University of Queensland and went on to<br>pursue post-graduate study as a road<br>scholar at Oxford<br>University there she completed Mill and<br>Dill degrees in Chinese law at the<br>center for social socio legal studies it<br>was there she met Ryan which is most<br>likely the reason why her first academic<br>roles were in the United States at<br>Marquette University and at Lola<br>University Chicago almost exactly 70<br>years ago now Anna and her family now<br>with Maggie who was very very small then<br>came to the faculty of law at the<br>University of<br>aago her Cal thesis was the basis of a<br>monograph completed in her early years<br>at otago called non-governmental orphan<br>relief in China for which he received<br>the Asian law and Society association<br>annual book<br>award and's academic position in otago<br>involves teaching<br>evidence evidence is the is the core to<br>the resolution of legal issues for the<br>Watchers of t dramas that is when<br>Council in the US leap to their feet and<br>Shout<br>objection it is some matter of evidence<br>to which they are objecting either they<br>form or the man of its<br>reporting evidence is fundamental to the<br>law and to the resolution of legal<br>disputes she has come to New Zealand<br>since she has come to New Zealand she<br>has developed a research SE Arch<br>portfolio as well as her teaching in<br>evidence and is now respected across<br>oura as an expers on the law of<br>evidence this seems to be a natural fit<br>with the extensive work that she has<br>also done on isues and sexual violence<br>with particular interest in the role of<br>dignity and Mana in that area of<br>law her work in these areas has seen her<br>win a number of prizes and awards a<br>royal Society to apari early career<br>research award and the two significant<br>New Zealand legal ring<br>Awards Anna has broad and interrelated<br>interests and work she describes herself<br>as a socio legal scholar who takes a law<br>in action<br>approach that is to say she has a<br>research approach that examines the and<br>considers not only learning about the<br>rules of the<br>La sounds ominous but also about how the<br>rules have evolved to address social<br>concerns and how they actively operate<br>in the real world please welcome Anna<br>high to deliver the 2024 roath trust and<br>Carl Smith research medal lecture on<br>Australia<br>Teno for those very um kind words of<br>introduction um Vice Chancellor dbc's um<br>proce chancellors colleagues and friends<br>it's really wonderful to see you all<br>here today thank you for coming out on<br>such a beautiful um evening to be here<br>yum so I've chosen for today's lecture<br>to focus on the theme of proof proving a<br>point is my title what is proof what is<br>evidence Shell's somewhat stolen my<br>thunder here I should say speaking to<br>both the legal question that was a<br>useful primer The Rules of Evidence in<br>law um and also to questions of proof<br>that arise in um both research and<br>Academia so evidence is what warrants a<br>belief that something is true evidence<br>is proof evidence makes the existence of<br>something such as a defendant guilt or a<br>research hypothesis more or less likely<br>to be true so in other words evidence is<br>something that has probative Val value a<br>tendency to prove or disprove something<br>that is of interest to us and evidence<br>law which as Shel said is one of my<br>major areas of research is the set of<br>rules and principles that govern whether<br>a particular piece of evidence um will<br>be rejected or admissible can it be<br>relied on by typically a jury in court<br>proceedings now I spend a great deal of<br>my time reading a Relentless NeverEnding<br>stream of judgments mostly from the<br>Supreme cour court court of appeal also<br>the high court um it's quite a large<br>volume of evidence law judgments on<br>various doctrinal blackletter very<br>technical details of evidence law much<br>of which as I was keenly aware in<br>deciding what to speak about today is<br>not of particular interest outside the<br>legal profession or indeed if you're not<br>an Evidence nerd like myself um<br>nonetheless I did decide to um choose<br>proof as the theme for today's lecture<br>and I will speak to to some of those<br>legal issues but I'm thinking about the<br>theme more broadly including in relation<br>to my earliest postgraduate work which<br>was in Chinese law based on field work<br>there and also in relation to<br>Academia um but first I thought some<br>background on how I came to be focusing<br>on evidence law would be of interest um<br>because it is a bit of a pivot from my<br>early China focus and this really arose<br>because Oto really values research L<br>teaching and when I I arrived 7 years<br>ago I was given the evidence law paper<br>to teach somewhat unexpectedly this was<br>not mentioned in my interview um<br>although I was I'm actually really<br>grateful for it because it's given me a<br>lot of opportunities to work with um<br>amazing students and practitioners and<br>judges across the Motu um which has been<br>really enjoyable and um Mark henigan<br>being the dean at the time for those of<br>you who who know him with his typical<br>exuberance and utmost faith in people he<br>not only asked me to take on evidence<br>law very shortly after arriving in Alo<br>and not having any familiarity with this<br>legal jurisdiction but he also excitedly<br>told me that he'd signed me up to teach<br>the judge's evidence law that that same<br>year um fortunately for me Fred's um my<br>my son's somewhat unexpected arrival<br>gave me a bit of a bit of breathing room<br>on that<br>front of course I guess it shows agility<br>is important in Academia and I'm sure<br>the same is true in all of your<br>disciplines we in law are constantly<br>telling our students we can't teach you<br>every area of law we can teach you legal<br>methods we can teach you how to think<br>and reason like a lawyer and I'll have<br>more to say on what that means all of<br>that to say evidence law is a relatively<br>new area of research and teaching for me<br>but I think these ideas of proof<br>evidence probative value these are<br>Salient in research more<br>generally so to go back some time my PhD<br>um as mentioned was in Chinese law and<br>began doing my field work in 2009 at<br>Oxford Center for socio legal studies um<br>I did further field work I should that<br>made it sound like I did the field work<br>at the center for socio legal studies I<br>did it in China I was based at um the<br>center for socio legal studies I did<br>further fieldwork in 2010 and then just<br>prior to joining otago in 2017 and that<br>time I had my my baby daughter with me<br>um and this work was studying over time<br>the tenuous negotiated existence of Quai<br>legal um orphanages in China caring for<br>mostly abandoned children most who of<br>whom had disabilities these orphanages<br>are often affiliated with so-called<br>underground churches although that's a<br>bit of a misnomer um and there are some<br>photos up on the board the photos the<br>homes that I visited really varied quite<br>widely in terms of funding<br>resourcing visibility size location um<br>being rural or Urban some were local<br>Chinese run others were run by Foreign<br>missionaries with all of the<br>complexities that that involves in<br>China and at the time of that initial<br>field workor and writing the PHD these<br>organizations were technically<br>officially illegal they were not allowed<br>to exist they were outside of that legal<br>framework for charities for Nos and<br>forly the state had a monopoly on<br>institutional care for Orphans and that<br>of course raises really significant<br>implications for the children resident<br>in these homes but it also raised some<br>really interesting law and Society<br>questions um about how State actors were<br>regulating these organizations that were<br>ostensibly<br>illegal but they weren't in hiding and<br>they did have quite extensive<br>interactions with the state at different<br>levels of particularly at that<br>Grassroots level so I was really<br>interested in looking at what are the<br>Norms the rules the<br>expectations the local Dynamics and<br>politics that were at play in this<br>social field how did these organizations<br>deal with being illegal what were the<br>Practical ramifications of that did they<br>see themselves as illegal did they care<br>about that label is the legal illegal<br>binary even a relevant um dichotomy or<br>an important binary in the Chinese<br>context and you can read the book to get<br>answers to all of those questions I've<br>just posed um because my point in<br>bringing this up is that this did also<br>of course involve looking for evidence<br>so observations from fieldwork<br>interviews um participant observation<br>and looking for the evidence drawing<br>conclusions based on that evidence about<br>how this little world this social sphere<br>was struck structured and then thinking<br>about the implications of those<br>observations and evidence and<br>conclusions for studies of Chinese law<br>more<br>generally and in terms of proof that<br>required as those of you who have done<br>field work will know it required being<br>really mindful of both preconceived<br>theories and hypotheses like is this<br>evidence or is this confirmation bias<br>but also the impact of my own presence<br>there in the field as a researcher so<br>that identity as a researcher and all<br>the other identities that I also brought<br>with me so for example I was there as a<br>former volunteer I was a foreigner but I<br>was a foreigner who at the time spoke<br>Chinese I was a person with some shared<br>beliefs with some of the participants<br>and therefore there's a whole other kind<br>of common language that you have um and<br>I was also later there as a mother so I<br>was also always needing to be really<br>mindful of being both an in Insider and<br>an outsider in the field thinking<br>through how to account for that in my<br>reading of the<br>evidence which I think points to how<br>evidence Gathering is not a value<br>neutral process um and questions around<br>reliability replicability<br>representativeness arise and the inter<br>subjectivity of the researcher and the<br>subject of study must be accounted for<br>this is Maggie on our last fieldwork um<br>trip um just on that note thinking about<br>inter subjectivity it's admittedly<br>somewhat cliche but things did really<br>hit differently when I went back to do<br>field workor um in 2017 as a mother I<br>had Maggie with me I was reminded that a<br>lot of time had passed which is really<br>interesting in terms of what I was<br>noticing and what had happened in that<br>field but I was also being received<br>differently because time had passed um<br>so for example this really hit when all<br>of the children I was speaking to on<br>this trip spontaneously uniformally<br>referred to me as Anna AI rather than<br>Anna J so Auntie Anna not big sister<br>Anna a bit of a bit of a blow but time<br>time had passed I was also really more<br>aware on that last trip of how<br>fieldwork-based research inevitably to<br>some degree at least casts the children<br>and the participants as the the people<br>whose stories are being told it casts<br>them as objects to some degree and that<br>raises a moral tension which cannot be<br>done away with it has to be inhabited<br>with self-reflection particularly when<br>it comes to using the stories of others<br>to do our scholarly work and as this<br>quote from Kirsten Bell puts it The<br>Perils of ethnographic fieldwork as with<br>its promise stem as much from our<br>Humanity as from our identity as a<br>researcher<br>so soon after leaving China our family<br>moved to Alor and I began teaching<br>evidence and Chinese law here and here<br>again I thought I would just pause to<br>note that there is an echo of that moral<br>tension um in that our research and for<br>our students their learning in law<br>relies on using the lived experiences of<br>others as case studies for our own<br>purposes we use those as tools for<br>understanding what the law is and how it<br>has developed so how did this murder<br>trial develop the rules around character<br>evidence for<br>example and people as connected in fena<br>and reciprocity are at the heart of the<br>law both in terms of how it has<br>developed but also in the impacts that<br>it has and sometimes the the legal<br>method that I referred to earlier at<br>least as constructed from a second law<br>Anglo New Zealand perspective can in<br>some respects obscure this and this was<br>famously explored by Elizabeth Merz in<br>her really important work on what it<br>does to students when we when we teach<br>them to think like a lawyer which I want<br>to return to<br>later and relatedly moreover to think<br>like a lawyer again in the second uh law<br>Western worldview at least is ostensibly<br>to be objective and value<br>neutral and that assumption that the law<br>is premised on value neutral objective<br>logic is of course and has been open to<br>critique on numerous fronts for a long<br>time so another research and teaching<br>focus of mine in the past four years has<br>been feminist legal Theory with a<br>particular focus on the law of consent<br>in New Zealand in the context of sexual<br>violence and what I wanted to do for<br>this part of the lecture um was to give<br>some examples of this of how feminist<br>Theory over time has helped to uncover<br>the values the value judgments that are<br>embedded in these ostensibly objective<br>doctrinal so-called black letter areas<br>of law such as evidence law feminist<br>theory has critiqued and changed our<br>understanding of what can validly be<br>used as<br>proof um I do hasten to although I think<br>this is probably already apparent I'm<br>not taking credit for the feminist<br>critique of evidence law I'm giving you<br>some well-known examples that have been<br>widely written about and um as useful<br>kind of context for for my own<br>research but to begin with a brief<br>primer evidence law in New Zealand is<br>premised um fundamentally on two<br>fundamental ideas the first is that only<br>relevant evidence should go to the jury<br>and the the second is that sometimes<br>even relevant evidence will nonetheless<br>be excluded because the price to be paid<br>by admitting it is seen as too high so<br>for example something else I've written<br>about is um prison informant evidence we<br>might have evidence from a prison<br>informant or a so-called jail housee<br>snitch who says oh yes the defendant<br>told me that that he did it well that<br>would be very compelling evidence if it<br>was true it would certainly be relevant<br>it would tend to prove the defendant's<br>guilt but as a matter of law the judge<br>might find that it cannot be used as<br>evidence because there are serious<br>concerns about whether it is true<br>whether it is reliable and whether the<br>jury will be able to assess<br>reliability um and whether they'll be<br>able to look past its wow<br>factor so in the Anglo common law<br>tradition the idea of relevance which is<br>that a piece of proof is linked with a<br>particular um conclusion or contention<br>has long been described and considered<br>to be a matter of logic and Common Sense<br>you see these phrases used quite often<br>it's logic and common<br>sense but the question has to be asked<br>who's who's Common Sense who's logic<br>because by Common Sense we tend to mean<br>generalizations and we can bring that um<br>underlying logic to light by using<br>syllogistic reasoning to explain the<br>logic that underpins the linkage of a<br>piece of evidence with a particular<br>conclusion right so the most famous<br>example of this would be all men are<br>mortal Socrates is a man therefore<br>Socrates is Mortal so if in a court of<br>law we're trying to prove that socr<br>Socrates is Mortal we could offer as<br>evidence that he is a man and that<br>evidence tends to prove his mortal<br>because of this premise that links the<br>evidence with the conclusion the premise<br>that all men are mortal and of course<br>that's a premise that is uh accepted and<br>valid and logically sound okay so so far<br>so good sometimes assessing relevance is<br>a matter of what everyone just knows to<br>be true everyone knows that men are<br>mortal um everyone knows that you can't<br>be in two places at once which means an<br>alibi is very much relevant to whether<br>or not someone did the deed committed<br>the crime so in other words sometimes<br>the logic at play will be<br>unimpeachable but sometimes however the<br>logic on which an assertion of relevance<br>is premised is contestable particularly<br>when we start to consider whose Logic<br>the common law has traditionally<br>applied so I have some examples in the<br>next few slides to illustrate how<br>relevance far from being neutral and<br>impartial is as Kim ports puts it here<br>very much in the Eye of the<br>Beholder good guys don't commit assault<br>so at common law it used to be common<br>particularly in sexual violence trials<br>to bring General well he's a good guy<br>type of evidence and I am using gendered<br>language here because rape was defined<br>in gendered terms in in the common law<br>and this was used to bolster a<br>defendant's credibility and thereby<br>undermine the complainants um<br>credibility to suggest that she would<br>was simply a woman scorned a woman quote<br>unquote crying rape and as feminist<br>Scholars like Katherine McKinnon and<br>Susan estrich point out it is an<br>unfortunate truth that the experience of<br>very many women calls into pre into<br>question this premise and if the logic<br>is not sound then the relevance and the<br>importance of this sort of evidence<br>becomes<br>implicated<br>unchastened therefore less trustworthy<br>incredible this was the logic of the<br>common law the common law um said that<br>if a woman had a uh sexual past that<br>could be used to undermine her<br>credibility on the basis that of this<br>logic here and you can see how of course<br>that underlying logic casts women with a<br>past as the unchaste the Deviant the<br>shameful other with devastating results<br>in terms of their assaults being simply<br>real victims will complain immediately<br>or act in a certain way or go to the<br>police again the common law equated a<br>failure to immediately complain with a<br>assumpt a presumption that the complaint<br>was<br>fabricated um to what extent even today<br>do jury members continue to bring this<br>Common Sense logic to the Jury Room into<br>their<br>deliberations and of course we can<br>question that logic we can say well how<br>valid is this premise for from the<br>perspective of a moldi woman in light of<br>ongoing Colonial trauma and mistrust or<br>for a gay person in a heteronormative or<br>context real victims will fight back<br>this victim did not resist at least<br>sufficiently in a way that um the law<br>thinks makes sense and is convincing<br>this victim simply froze Ergo he is not<br>a victim and this was consensual<br>so as these examples um illustrate the<br>common sense logic that underpins<br>evidence law is perhaps not so common<br>once the perspectives of previously<br>marginalized othered voices begin to be<br>accounted<br>for as I've mentioned um I think there<br>have been numerous reforms though we've<br>come along way um numerous reforms both<br>to the rules of evidence and also to our<br>substantive law of sexual violence aimed<br>at redressing the myths and the biased<br>assumptions that for so long have<br>infiltrated the law in terms of the law<br>of consent which is one of my current<br>major areas of focus our Crimes Act was<br>amended in 1985 to provide that a person<br>does not consent just because they did<br>not resist so you can see there that<br>that's um a political Choice a<br>legislative<br>repudiation of the common laws logic<br>which required victims to resist to<br>prove<br>non-consent but of course the law could<br>go further and many jurisdictions have<br>gone further we could choose to follow<br>in the footsteps of Canada and various<br>American and Australian jurisdictions<br>and to define consent as something that<br>must always be communicated as something<br>that is by its nature an external<br>phenomenon something that doesn't do any<br>work unless it is<br>communicated and that would essentially<br>again amount to legislative Embrace of a<br>new logic that it's never reasonable to<br>assume someone else can sense based on<br>their lack of a no but that it must<br>always be based on some form of yes<br>communicated by sufficiently clear words<br>or actions and this is a construction of<br>consent at Law in law at least um as<br>something that's inherently relational<br>and mutual and there's some really<br>important ongoing work happening um in<br>this space<br>I am going to shift gears now and by way<br>of a segue I have another<br>sism um which is to introduce the final<br>um part of today's lecture where I<br>wanted to discuss questions of proof<br>that arise for us as<br>academics for academics who are tasked<br>with producing research outputs which<br>are by necessity they have to be<br>evaluated by performance reviews<br>promotion review use Etc there's also a<br>question of evidence that arises here<br>how do we prove that our research is<br>sufficient and<br>successful and I wanted to talk to this<br>because here again I think my experience<br>has been that there are often some<br>Unearthed and unchallenged assumptions<br>that can be at play and it can be useful<br>to bring those to light and to consider<br>the impact they have on our academic<br>Endeavors and choices<br>so I'm somewhat veering off the<br>traditional research lecture path<br>although I will come back to another<br>research focus in a moment um because<br>this is something that's very much<br>related to receiving an Accolade like<br>this um I think research honors are<br>wonderful they're a lovely way that we<br>as a Collegiate institution where we<br>care about each other and we celebrate<br>each other's success we can highlight<br>through Awards A diversity of research<br>that is happening<br>and it can be one way to encourage<br>people and to say your work is is seen<br>and it's valued and that can be<br>particularly important for early career<br>colleagues because the stories that we<br>tell ourselves and each other about our<br>work matter a great deal in terms of<br>whether we persevere when challenges<br>arise so my experience in the faculty of<br>law um since I arrived in 2017 has been<br>a really really fortunate one I've<br>always had that encouragement because in<br>part almost everything I've sent out for<br>peer review at least in the early days<br>was read by a colleague um I really<br>greatly admire and Trust um the opinions<br>of my colleagues they've been very<br>generous with their expertise and time<br>um to give one example when I was<br>writing my book in my first year both<br>Stuart Anderson and Nicola P who were<br>formidable legal minds they read every<br>word and they gave me some really<br>incredibly insightful feedback and<br>that's not not a small ask of of busy<br>academics so for me seeing my work<br>through the eyes of discerning and<br>rigorous and encouraging colleagues has<br>been really important there's often a<br>lot of rigor and discernment from peer<br>reviewers and not so much encouragement<br>and um having my colleagues alongside<br>has been a really helpful corrective<br>against narratives of self-doubt that<br>I'm sure at least some of you are also<br>familiar with<br>um self-doubt has always been part of my<br>research process it's been something<br>that I have to push through um and I<br>thought that there might be some value<br>in sharing that vulnerability today in<br>case others feel the same way because it<br>can be a lonely<br>experience and I also share it with my<br>students um our law students some are<br>here today are a wonderful group of<br>students they also to generalize um can<br>have Tendencies towards competitiveness<br>and<br>perfectionism I'm not criticizing I<br>think it's sort of a function of who<br>chooses to do law um and in my role as<br>convenor of student experience I often<br>see our students being really hard on<br>themselves and in part that might be<br>because they're in a system which often<br>perhaps<br>unintentionally and to some degree<br>necessarily causes them to focus on<br>externalities as measures of their<br>success and for some therefore as<br>measures of their self worth things like<br>GPA lines on the CV did I win the moot<br>how many job offers did I get<br>Etc so one final research interest that<br>I wanted to speak to today and this is<br>something which I've also published on<br>obia briefly but have been putting into<br>practice in my teaching here at otago is<br>how mindfulness and contemplative<br>practices can be used pedagogically to<br>help students with lots of different<br>things like Focus empathy resilience but<br>also to help them with<br>reorienting um their academic Endeavors<br>towards internal motivations to try to<br>stay connected with their values and for<br>some that might be about achieving a<br>certain ambition there's nothing wrong<br>with that um but for others they come to<br>law school driven by a certain sense of<br>purpose or altruism and there is some<br>concerning research from the US and<br>elsewhere showing that law schools with<br>their culture of competition and<br>Conformity I'm quoting Susan Sturman ly<br>guinia there can beat this out of<br>students sometimes we fall short in<br>encouraging our students to develop<br>internally generated measures of<br>accomplishment sometimes we fall short<br>in cultivating a contextual<br>compassionate empathetic view of how law<br>impacts<br>people as Conley puts it in this review<br>of M's think like a lawyer which I<br>mentioned earlier when we teach our<br>students to think like a lawyer it turns<br>out this is not such a value neutral<br>thing when we teach them to think like a<br>lawyer we may inadvertently strip them<br>of the values that motivated them to<br>study law and subtly inculcate new ones<br>while undermining<br>empathy so returning to my theme<br>question of proof here what about for<br>academics when we as academics find<br>ourselves likewise in a culture that<br>encourages in some ways encourages<br>competition and in some ways not all is<br>defined by external metrics like H<br>factors and journal rankings and number<br>of outputs and grant money and yes<br>Awards how do we resist the narrative<br>that these are the only metrics of<br>success or that they are the most<br>important ones and how do we also stay<br>connected if we choose and want to do so<br>to our values to the intrinsic<br>motivations and rewards of research I<br>think I have found it can be really<br>intrinsically rewarding and motivating<br>um I would Hazard that we all have a<br>cause for our research as lawyers our<br>cause is Justice if we want to use<br>distill it down to one word and we can<br>contribute to Justice in different ways<br>in our work but if external metrics<br>become all consuming that can be<br>obscured we can find ourselves too<br>metrics so I use mindfulness to these<br>ends both personally but also in my<br>classroom it's always optional for those<br>who are willing to try or find it useful<br>which is not everybody it's not for<br>everybody um but it can be used to help<br>students combat self-doubt and<br>competition to stay connected to their<br>values and intrinsic sources of<br>motivation um to help them wrestle with<br>and not lose sight of The Human Side of<br>these cases es that we're using in our<br>learning and also to think about how<br>they are going to define success for<br>themselves and in my own research<br>Journey I've found mindfulness um helps<br>me notice when self-doubt is at play and<br>to just sit with that discomfort and<br>choose to persevere nonetheless um I am<br>not a researcher who finds research and<br>writing always comes easily despite the<br>syllogistic reasoning that might suggest<br>this is so there can be fear and worry<br>at play when I sit down to write I'm<br>worried this will sound grandiose and I<br>and it may not resonate with everyone<br>but for me sometimes writing is an act<br>of Courage because it's an act of<br>creation and creative work can be scary<br>you're putting your workout into the<br>world for others to to pick apart it can<br>be scary to start with a blank page and<br>to know you have a deadline and to try<br>to write against the void as it's<br>described in Walking on<br>alligators and mindfulness is helpful<br>for me so what I'm trying to be<br>transparent about is that fear and<br>anxiety is sometimes just part of my<br>process and as Bales and Orland describe<br>in this excellent book art and fear as<br>writers we carry real and imagin critics<br>with us constantly a veritable Babble Of<br>voices some remembered some prophesied<br>and each eager to comment on all we<br>do of course constructive criticism and<br>commentary is really important it's<br>essential to what we do as academics<br>engaging in academic um dialogue and I<br>think to whatever extent our research is<br>strong and rigorous it's probably in<br>part because we're listening to those<br>voices we're anticipating the criticism<br>we're noticing the shortcomings and<br>weaknesses in our arguments and making<br>them stronger so they can be really<br>productive but likewise um the comments<br>particularly of the notorious reviewer<br>to whether they<br>are praising us or see ly trying to take<br>us down and which is sounds hyperbolic<br>but it can feel that way sometimes um<br>those comments and the opinions and<br>views of others are externalities that<br>can obscure our internal<br>motivation so as I often tell my<br>students how you speak to yourself and<br>about yourself really matters and in<br>mindfulness they can take a breath um<br>and in that breath find Space to choose<br>a different narrative one that's<br>grounded in both humility and kindness<br>including to ourselves<br>speaking of kindness one of the briefs<br>for today was to share with you the<br>people who have influenced my research<br>journey and while it's um again cliche<br>to say there are probably too many to to<br>name individually um that would<br>certainly include my family my parents<br>are both teachers every teacher that<br>I've ever had um my PhD supervisors at<br>Oxford um colleagues and mentors from my<br>time in Chicago including Terry<br>Halliday here at otago I've already<br>acknowledge that the faculty of law I<br>think is a really special place to be my<br>colleagues are brilliant and generous<br>and very fun to work with I think the<br>faculty is full of inspiring people um<br>which is um in part evidenced by the<br>fact that 50% of current otago dvcs are<br>women from The Faculty of law<br>um um I'm grateful to paa for welcoming<br>me to the China Club um at otago and<br>being a one-of a-kind um cheerleader um<br>I'm co-director of the otago Center for<br>Law and Society with Ben and Shanel and<br>Bridget toy Cronin who are the absolute<br>Dream Team to work with um I've made<br>many friendships across the university<br>and if it's not already apparent I also<br>really like our students I think that<br>they're really great and<br>inspiring um for me staying connected to<br>values and intrinsic motivation is made<br>much easier by belonging to the nox<br>community so thank you to all of you for<br>being here today including people who've<br>become family to us here in Al tedor and<br>supported us in the absence of our<br>American and Australian families and<br>there's one adopted grandparent in<br>particular who I know would have really<br>loved to be here<br>today um yeah thank you to everyone for<br>coming today um at a busy time of year<br>including family and friends watching<br>online I think my kids should be coming<br>surely um I didn't want them to to<br>listen to some some of this content um<br>but I asked um my kids if they knew what<br>i' do and Maggie said well you're a<br>lawyer and Fred said what's a lawyer and<br>and Maggie without skipping a beat said<br>lawyers are people who tell other people<br>they're<br>wrong so there's something about Justice<br>there in the in the words of a of an<br>8-year-old um I must confess I do tell<br>people they're wrong fairly of fairly<br>often but my amazing family put up with<br>that and helped me adding some kindness<br>seat oh thank you so much Anna um that<br>was fantastic wonderful and everything<br>else in between I um I have a an un<br>enviable role of now trying to wrap<br>things up but what you've done is got<br>lots of tangents that I will go on for a<br>little while when you talk about um uh<br>telling people they're wrong I'm<br>reminded of uh having the great<br>privilege of um hearing a Nobel laurat<br>speak in the field of theoretical physic<br>physics he had transferred from<br>philosophy uh which he he argued was a a<br>case where people are arguing with each<br>other to try and prove who is wrong but<br>to evidence he said he what he loved<br>about theoretical physics is you could<br>develop a theory that was tested by<br>evidence and that if you were wrong you<br>Wen stupid um but also to referee too it<br>reminded me on another tangent of my<br>first review uh as an as a as a doctoral<br>student um where the words that will<br>never leave me are naive<br>phenomenological approach and uh<br>experimental results seem to have been<br>added as an afterthought so after much<br>battle we got that through so that<br>humaness of of the research experience<br>is one that um uh I could reflect on um<br>what you've done though is you've taken<br>us through a journey through your<br>academic career and you've demonstrated<br>to us the uh the full the rounded the<br>the very um caring and uh deep thinking<br>academic that you are you care and care<br>very much for us by firstly not saying<br>what you really do in your research when<br>you read through detailed judgments and<br>try and follow flow<br>through that um very detailed and um<br>technical work that you do but rather<br>you lifted us to um different levels in<br>what you do and in particular I think we<br>all appreciated that connection to what<br>it it is and means to be a University<br>academic to connect teaching to research<br>and to practice and that you've got this<br>Tri Trifecta trium um Holy Trinity uh<br>whatever you like to call it the three<br>in one one uh very very clearly<br>exemplified and what you did tonight is<br>the um is the evidence that backs up the<br>logic of the panel uh that leads to the<br>conclusion that you are a worthy<br>recipient what the panel the panel very<br>much liked was that your your work is<br>leading research it is grounded with um<br>good metrics you are publishing in uh in<br>appropriate um in appropriate outlets<br>and you are publishing at the right<br>level to to receive this award but you<br>very much ground that and in engagement<br>with students and with the profession<br>that you will work with the profession<br>uh both advising on things like the<br>third review of The Evidence Act but<br>being um a very valued member of the<br>judicial Studies Institute to teach<br>judges about evidence as well um that<br>you wanted to develop a strand of your<br>research because you were given a course<br>to teach because you were teaching<br>evidence you needed to develop research<br>and that and that taking very seriously<br>that that aspect of research and<br>teaching is what we saw very much um you<br>had you have presented to us a logic of<br>evidence and proof that actually works<br>across many disciplines I'm thinking of<br>um our mathematicians who also have very<br>structured um um forms of way ways to go<br>from conjecture to to proof through<br>structured and uh evidential um<br>linkages um I could say a lot more but I<br>think um it is uh right for us to to um<br>ask the that by acclamation uh we see<br>whether you have passed the test and are<br>worthy for me to invite the vice Chanel<br>are up to receive this award and who<br>thinks we should we should go with the<br>next<br>step so so with that congratulations<br>I'll invite the vice Chancellor<br>honorable Grant Robertson to present you<br>with a cith medal a copy of the book by<br>Kyle Smith and something framed to uh to<br>allow you to remember the evening so<br>honors and in closing thank you for all<br>coming to those that are present in<br>person could you please um feel free to<br>join us at the staff club for<br>Refreshments apologies to those that are<br>online unless you can make a very Speedy<br>uh trip to denan uh we'll hold something<br>for you all week and uh you can have a<br>celebration with Anna at the next<br>occasion so finally congratulations and</p></main><footer style="margin-top: 2rem; background: #0001; padding: 2rem; text-align: center;"><p>We Are The University</p><ul
