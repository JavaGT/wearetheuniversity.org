economy was valued at<br>$70 billion and it's predicted to double<br>by 2030 more Al organizations are<br>needing to demonstrate cultural<br>sensitivity and diversity in order to<br>remain competitive and overseas we're<br>seeing similar Trends as indigenous<br>economies become increasingly more<br>influential with me today to talk about<br>the University of Oakland's newly<br>designed NBA paper T Mari business is Dr<br>Kitty Dell K Kitty um so this course is<br>the first of its kind in New Zealand can<br>you tell for an absolute pgo can you<br>explain what T Mari<br>is T Mari is a way of being in the world<br>a particular way related to copopa MTI<br>uh M philosophies<br>and ideologies so that that typically<br>means we relate to the land and the<br>Earth and to people in a very specific<br>way and how does deepening one's<br>understanding of tari help with their<br>leadership strategies or an in turn New<br>Zealand<br>businesses so when people deepen their<br>understanding of tari they broaden their<br>perspectives on life and the world and<br>in a very enriching way and one of those<br>ways might be for example your<br>connection spiritually to um to the<br>world to the Earth um Mighty ways of<br>being have a particular energy about<br>them that harnesses these kind of<br>spiritual<br>Dimensions so that um when you carry<br>that kind of philosophy or Dimension<br>within you that's going to impact the<br>way you think about the world and the<br>way you make decisions and how you treat<br>people and how you treat the youth yes<br>amazing can you give me some examples of<br>some businesses or Business Leaders that<br>do that in a beautiful way<br>here yeah there's a number of um<br>businesses that are operating from a<br>Mari Paradigm the most obvious ones<br>would be Al run<br>um we've got really successful ewe<br>businesses happening at the moment<br>natif from this area nahu<br>whitei uh these are all very<br>prominent um<br>businesses within New<br>Zealand uh and they're all operating<br>from a t Mari Paradigm all operating<br>from copap Mar centered and just really<br>showing the world that when you operate<br>in that way you can be commercially<br>successful and do good as well what do<br>you think it is about those mty<br>businesses that have made them so<br>successful do you think some of our most<br>prominent businesses are successful<br>because of the the<br>K ship Network or element that um is<br>imbued within that business and there's<br>when you have that in business you've<br>got this um very tightly<br>knitted Bond and Synergy with each other<br>that just helps helps things to um<br>accelerate and move very quickly and in<br>a particular way is it trust is it<br>deeper than<br>trust it's a connection it's emotional<br>connection what how would you define<br>that what is just these like this<br>incredible depth of connection that's<br>going back um<br>Generations that is<br>um providing this momentum of strength<br>that propels you to um achieve your<br>goals and<br>aspirations and it makes you incredibly<br>resilient against any kind of shocks<br>coming your<br>way how then can pakha or other<br>businesses fold into Al MTI principles<br>and be successful um they not likely to<br>have and maybe I'm making an assumption<br>by saying that but they're not likely to<br>have those same kinship Roots because of<br>course M businesses and Mar<br>organizations come from a shared place<br>of knowledge and understanding and<br>terminology and all those other things<br>so how could the stuff they learn in<br>your course enrich their<br>businesses yeah that's a really good<br>question um and it's that's the kind of<br>stuff we'll discuss and tease out in the<br>course what value can non- MTI get from<br>M Concepts ways of living and being and<br>what value is just so unique and special<br>to Mighty themselves that it's just a<br>character quality that belongs to them<br>and so we get to um discuss and tease<br>out um where that that value lies I<br>understand some times cultural things if<br>you're coming at it from outside of the<br>culture can be intimidating or it can<br>make you AAR which is a shy um is<br>the course going to be accessible to<br>nonmi absolutely absolutely it's going<br>to be accessible to non<br>Mari we're in a very<br>interesting uh partnership dynamic in<br>New Zealand with regards to the<br>relationship of Mari um in in this<br>country uh so this is an opportunity for<br>nonmi to really<br>Embrace uh Mali T Mali kopa<br>Mali um I come from a perspective of<br>um bridging I guess really helping nonmi<br>to bridge to T Mar and really understand<br>what um that philosophy<br>means yeah conceptually what sort of<br>things will you be teaching like<br>co-governance or t or yeah we've got um<br>probably three major areas we'll deliver<br>across the paper one is around treaty<br>settlements um why we have them how they<br>logistically um occur what that means um<br>and how we have gone on to develop these<br>um incredible<br>commercial um entities from treaty<br>settlements yep the second component<br>we'll look at is mighty Innovation and<br>Entrepreneurship and really harnessing<br>and understanding this um Unique Kind of<br>spiritually driven Innovative um aspect<br>of Mali and how that is<br>manifesting in in the country and and<br>the third one we'll look at is<br>land-based businesses so a lot of M<br>resources and assets are tied to land<br>ownership and we'll have a look at um<br>how some of those businesses are rolling<br>out I you finding more and more<br>businesses are demanding cultural<br>competency of their leaders or their<br>staff or their businesses like is that a<br>trend that you have heard about and<br>noticed that might have brought about<br>the this being included in the NBA yeah<br>there definitely is a trend moving<br>towards more inclusiveness of<br>tari both in terms of philosophy and in<br>terms of people as<br>well um and I think that's because um<br>businesses know that when we include<br>these aspects um it provides or yeah it<br>provides better<br>outputs for those<br>entities some spirituality can mean<br>different things to different cultures<br>and you've mentioned it a few times here<br>um what does<br>spirituality and modom look like what<br>does that look like and how could that<br>be accessible and useful to everybody<br>that takes the course big question yeah<br>well I mean one of the aspects of T Mari<br>is what I call is this acceptance of<br>unseen energies and and those are termed<br>things like Mana Modi wua these are all<br>very normalized energies within our<br>culture so uh we don't have to question<br>them um and these when you look at the<br>world from this energy<br>perspective that helps to shape the way<br>you're going to think about operating in<br>that world and decisions you're going to<br>make uh when you have a like for Modi<br>for example which is a particular life<br>Essence when you have a lens of Modi<br>across the world across your operations<br>across your<br>Workforce you're looking at how your<br>decisions are going to enhance the Modi<br>of a particular River Tree even person<br>so it just shapes your thinking in in a<br>in a different way<br>and of course conversely when businesses<br>get it wrong it can lead to things like<br>cultural appropriation and would you say<br>that's true also like without the<br>understanding of those lenses it's like<br>an added layer of like it enhances your<br>to at as a leader uh what you say yeah<br>there's there's a risk there of<br>culturally<br>misappropriating some of the concepts<br>and ideas the most important thing first<br>is that a person has has good intention<br>yeah and I find in our country most<br>people do they do have good intention um<br>and they can still get it wrong even<br>with that that good<br>willll learning about tar is not 10<br>steps I'm going to give<br>you it's not a prescribed like process<br>learning about tari means developing an<br>intimacy with Mighty people and their<br>ways of being and then<br>grows and develops and evolves over time<br>so I think that's the the thing people<br>get wrong is that they're just going to<br>have these 10 steps and they're going to<br>be you know just tick them all off but<br>it doesn't work like that would you say<br>at the end of the course people might<br>have a bit more confidence about showing<br>respect for bodyy communities and being<br>perhaps less afraid to collaborate with<br>them is that one of your hopes I think<br>the end of the<br>course um most of the cohort are going<br>to be quite um<br>surprised at the history of this country<br>and how it actually has impacted and<br>affects us to the present day um so<br>they're going to come away with um a lot<br>more in depth understanding of the<br>trajectory that this country has come<br>through um and and through that they'll<br>Dev velop empathy and that empathy will<br>help them to relate a lot better to T<br>Mighty and mighty people I was thinking<br>well I was thinking two things I was<br>thinking how amazing and beautiful it is<br>that we've got to the place that we<br>value jarti principles enough for this<br>to be the first the beginning of a<br>student Journey Through the MBA in this<br>leadership pillar that your course is<br>one of the first ones that students take<br>and the other thing I was thinking about<br>was um how that must I guess speak to<br>the value um the changing value that of<br>of cultural competency that students<br>must have in order to lead well yeah<br>there is an increasing<br>desire aspiration of New Zealand in<br>general to want to engage um and be a<br>part of T Mali and I think that speaks<br>to this um increasing sense of<br>partnership between Marty and paria and<br>wanting to progress ourselves um as a<br>nation so to me this paper is reflecting<br>that um the fact that it's the first um<br>time it's been included in the NBA is<br>absolutely significant<br>achievement um and important Milestone<br>this is is the first year that um<br>students around the country will be able<br>to join in in your NBA or this NBA<br>because it's now online um did you enjoy<br>coming up with the curriculum did you<br>enjoy putting the course together and<br>thinking about what important things to<br>put in and was that how was that<br>experience for you yeah I really enjoyed<br>putting the um course together because<br>these are topics I think about a lot I<br>think a lot about what it means to be<br>Mighty what is the essence of being<br>and how does that integrate and play out<br>with within our nation and with the<br>globe within the globe as well so uh<br>yeah it was it was really enjoyable to<br>be able to put this program together<br>when people do papers like this that are<br>perhaps uh for the first time being<br>exposed to this knowledge do you<br>see like authentic transformation can<br>you talk to me about that inside them so<br>they're being exposed to new information<br>for the first time and leaning into that<br>like do have you experienced that<br>absolutely yes so I think the the main<br>quality that's developed is empathy and<br>that's all a person needs<br>to really be with someone else is to<br>really try to understand and feel the<br>situation and the context that they<br>coming from and so once students<br>complete this course they will have more<br>empathy<br>for the mighty situation and context<br>that will help them to go forward um<br>into their own careers and um developing<br>through the relationships with Marty I'm<br>always surprised by how many leaders get<br>so excited by some of our Concepts and<br>go I want to do that naturally but<br>here's a a name for it and here's the<br> poer of it and I get to be part<br>of that right like people can get quite<br>excited by the knowledge um do students<br>have to have any presupposed cultural<br>knowledge or be able to speak to radi or<br>anything at all that can that is it<br>designed for someone to step into it and<br>is there support for them if they feel<br>intimidated or<br>unconfident yes so right at the<br>beginning of the course we do like a<br>stock take of where people are at in<br>their Journey with um t m and so we get<br>a kind of an overall picture of the<br>class and whether they are still quite<br>um just How Deeply engaged they are in<br>tell my so then we can pitch the content<br>to to suit that cohort so um it's all<br>accounted for there were some Concepts<br>that you used earlier that would be just<br>to make it accessible for everyone else<br>it would be nice to hear your<br>definitions of those so one of those was<br>Copa um how would you describe what Copa<br>is and I'm guessing the students will<br>get to understand each of these Concepts<br>in a deeper value when they come to your<br>course yeah Copa or Copa Mari means<br>purposefully Mari so Copa means anything<br>from topic intention<br>purpose subject so when you hear copam<br>Mari that means we are being<br>purposefully Mali by M for Mari um is<br>the the catchphrase<br>beautiful uh what was some of the other<br>ones there was uh mana mana yeah and W<br>Mana is a<br>quality that is often translated as a<br>person's Charisma or power or influence<br>I like to describe Mana as a person's<br>awesomeness um and so that quality of M<br>is how do we en harness enhance manifest<br>our personal awesomeness it's often used<br>Mana is often used as a leadership<br>quality because um people with great<br>Mana tend to have a lot of<br>influence yep uh yep so Y and<br>W wua is translated often as<br>Spirit as the<br>as a spiritual essence or energy that is<br>around us for example when you think or<br>feel of maybe someone who's passed away<br>you might refer to that as their wayer<br>you're feeling their wayer let's talk<br>about that because a little bit earlier<br>on you were when I very first um asked<br>you about t Mar you talked a lot about<br>energy energy and in a business sense or<br>leadership sense can mean um how people<br>feel when they walk into a space and how<br>others make them feel that would you say<br>that was true when you are out there in<br>the world you you need to understand<br>everything around you what is above you<br>what is in front of you what is be who<br>is beside you and who is behind<br>you and tell m is about understanding<br>the whole context that you're operating<br>from and so you there's no you're less<br>likely to be blindsided when you have<br>this wider awareness of the environment<br>around you so when you move into new<br>spaces that's what you're taking with<br>you is this increased awareness of<br>everything that's going on Amazing um<br>how does one distinguish between<br>appreciation and<br>appropriation so often you get people<br>starting to appreciate that they'll<br>start from this place of<br>appreciation and they'll do all these<br>really nice wonderful things for tell<br>Marty and Marty<br>people that often moves into what I call<br>appropriation because they start to<br>figure out there's actually value for<br>them to utilize and extract from T<br>Modi and so whenever a nonmi is gaining<br>in their let's say their career or life<br>from T Mali they always have to question<br>in themselves why they are continuing to<br>be in that space so I'm I am guessing<br>that perhaps as part of your paper you<br>will give your students some of these<br>things to think about so that they can<br>go away and do their own exploration and<br>think of things in a more intentional<br>way and they can take that into their<br>leadership<br>strategies yeah I always say that um we<br>need paria to support myy to be myy what<br>advice do you have for people who are<br>threatened by the idea that they have to<br>now consider this whole other world view<br>if they to conduct business<br>here yeah well the reality is this is a<br>country founded upon Marty and paria<br>relationship so we have an obligation to<br>each other to know each<br>other and that that needs to be the<br>starting point that we um need to work<br>together together to progress ourselves<br>as a nation T is not a topic it's not a<br>subject like um economics or um<br>marketing it's a lived reality of of<br>people and the people of this land it's<br>very specific to this land it can only<br>happen and occur in New Zealand so<br>that's what makes it very special and<br>unique<br>beautiful many thanks to Dr kid D
