tonight uh the inaugural<br>professorial lecture of BU Lee uh I want<br>to welcome especially all of you who are<br>in the room today uh friends and uh<br>family of BU um I also want to<br>acknowledge the extraordinary turnout<br>from the Knox Church Foo once again for<br>the second time this week uh uh you are<br>loyal supporters of your people but also<br>of us at the University of otago so<br>thank you so much um and for me lovely<br>to see so many familiar faces uh in the<br>room tonight as well I want to<br>acknowledge um bu and your family um<br>your husband Nigel uh um daughter bethan<br>and Sam and Sam's parents Sam's parents<br>um who are here um tonight uh it is<br>terrific uh to see you all here anybody<br>who works at the level of a professor in<br>a stressful and difficult role with a<br>depth of research relies on their family<br>but there are also enormous sacrifices<br>that are made by family and I think it's<br>important on an occasion like tonight to<br>acknowledge those sacrifices that you<br>have all made to support bu and I'd like<br>us to show our appreciation to the<br>family<br>I also want to make an acknowledgement<br>to all of bu's um family and friends<br>online um who are joining us<br>particularly those who've gotten up in<br>the middle of the night in the UK and<br>Ireland um to uh support her know my<br>heart and my welcome um along and I hope<br>you uh enjoy uh this evening or this<br>morning as the case may be uh lecture<br>just before I say a couple more words<br>about bu and hand over to uh associate<br>professor Megan Gibbons the uh Pro Vice<br>Chancellor of Health Sciences I did want<br>to make an acknowledgement that<br>tonight's the final uh inaugural<br>professorial lecture um ending on a bang<br>bu<br>that's but um it's an enormous piece of<br>work and I just want to acknowledge the<br>events team um who organized this and<br>throughout the year um the lectures are<br>an amazing part of what happens in our<br>University and it's a big effort so<br>given that it is the last of the Year<br>tonight I do want to acknowledge uh the<br>events team uh for their work uh as I<br>say Megan will shortly introduce uh buer<br>buer will then give her uh IPL and then<br>Professor Greg Anderson from the anatomy<br>department will finish up uh events uh<br>with a thank you at the end of that uh<br>Bu from what I know the depth of your<br>research work is matched only by the<br>support that you give to those around<br>you uh the manari Tonga that you provide<br>for students uh for those that you<br>supervise<br>uh it expresses to me the whole person<br>that you are uh these occasions uh and<br>and gaining professorial status are<br>about research they're about teaching<br>and they're also about service and I<br>want to acknowledge all three of those<br>as part of what you have done in your<br>time with the University of ataga I<br>think it's 10y year anniversary uh next<br>year from your arrival 20 year<br>anniversary sorry from your arrival time<br>flies uh when you're having fun and so<br>that that work over that 20 years is a<br>work of extremee dedication it's built<br>off your strong reputation which is<br>international um and the your ability to<br>draw all of that together and as the<br>title of your IPL indicates the making<br>of connections is what really matters<br>and making sure that we Thrive as<br>University you've done that and we are<br>extremely grateful for the contribution<br>that you've made to us and we are<br>genuinely looking forward to this<br>evening but to provide a bit more of an<br>introduction I'm now going to ask uh Pro<br>forward Oto Oto Oto<br>C it gives me great pleasure to<br>introduce buer tonight um and it should<br>have been uh Professor Lisa medu Smith<br>but she is very unwell um so I'm<br>stepping in in her place normally I just<br>finish up for the night so it's nice to<br>be at the front end um so let me start<br>with uh Professor bu leech she's an<br>internationally recognized Neuroscience<br>researching brain synapses and health<br>and disease she began her academic<br>career at Queens University Belfast<br>Northern Ireland completing her BSC<br>honors in 1980 followed by an MSC at the<br>University of Wales in<br>19981 and her PhD also from the<br>University of Wales in<br>1986 after receiving her PhD she spent a<br>year as the head of the electrom micros<br>microscopy section Department of<br>pathology Midland Center for<br>neuroscience and neurology Hospital<br>Smithwick Birmingham UK then from 1987<br>to 1989 she was a post-doctoral<br>researcher at the University of St<br>Andrews in the department of biology and<br>preclinical Medicine um in St Andrews<br>Scotland and from 1989 to 1993 a<br>post-doctoral research fellow at the<br>University of Cambridge in the<br>department of<br>zoology from 1993 to 1995 buer was a<br>lecturer in science university of Durham<br>in the school of education the science<br>division um in the UK and an honorary<br>lecturer in biological and biomedical<br>Sciences in 1995 she was appointed<br>lecture in biomedical science at the<br>University of Durham in the school of<br>biological and biomedical Sciences in<br>2005 buer joined us here at atago as a<br>senior lecturer and what was then the<br>department of anatomy and structural<br>biology and now it's just anatomy and in<br>2016 she was promoted to associate<br>professor we're here tonight to<br>celebrate her 2024 promotion to full<br>Professor bu research interests are in<br>cellular and molecular Neuroscience with<br>a focus on bra brain synapses and their<br>dysfunction and brain disorders synaptic<br>dysfunction underlies a number of brain<br>disorders including epilepsy Axia<br>schizophrenia autism dementia and<br>Alzheimer's disease she's particularly<br>interested in changes that occur at<br>sinapsis during neurodevelopment as a<br>result of genetic mutations one major<br>research focus of bu's lab group at<br>atago has been investigating the<br>underlying cellular and ular mechanisms<br>causing epileptic seizure in childhood<br>absence epilepsy which is genetic and<br>origin another interest in new protein<br>synthesis at synapsis during learning in<br>memory here the focus is on how altered<br>synaptic protein synthesiz synthesis May<br>contribute to synaptic dysfunction and<br>cognitive deficits underlying aging and<br>degenerative brain<br>disorders her research has been<br>supported by external grants and<br>scholarships um from the Royal so<br>Society neurological Foundation health<br>lottery research uh the German DD daad<br>um oste Japan welcome trust the UK B's<br>welcome USA biotechnology and biological<br>sciences research Council and the<br>science and engineering research Council<br>buer has an international reputation for<br>using cuttingedge highresolution Imaging<br>techniques for the detection of proteins<br>at sinapsis she's been invited as a<br>research scientist to several<br>distinguished world-renowned<br>Neuroscience institutes including the<br>Californian Institute of Technology and<br>the Okinawa Science Institute of Science<br>and Technology in Japan and the max<br>plank Institute for Brain Research in<br>Germany she's published 55 fulllength<br>referee Journal articles and three book<br>chapters including in 2019 co-authoring<br>with her collaborators at mix plank a<br>highly cited paper in the prestigious<br>Journal science buer is a dedicated<br>teacher and supervisor since coming to<br>to ago in 2005 she's taught science and<br>medical students across all levels from<br>first year Health Sciences second year<br>Dentistry third year medicine and 200 to<br>400 level anatomy and Neuroscience<br>papers over the last 10 years bua has<br>supervise numerous postgrad students<br>including four MSC and six PhD students<br>to completion in addition to undertaking<br>teaching Administration and and filling<br>other department roles in the department<br>of anatomy buer was the director of the<br>Neuroscience teaching program one of the<br>largest single major subjects in the<br>University of atigo from<br>2021 to uh<br>2024 she was also chair of the<br>Neuroscience research group in anatomy<br>comprising 13 Laboratories from 2014 to<br>2020 as noted earlier bu's research<br>interests are in cellular and molecular<br>Neuroscience with a focus on brain<br>synapses and their dysfunction and brain<br>disorders tonight and her very<br>appropriately titled talk bu will be<br>acknowledging the people and places both<br>personally and professionally that have<br>been important to her on her journey the<br>connections refer not only to people and<br>places but to one of the main focuses of<br>our Neuroscience research over the last<br>30 years namely the connections between<br>brain cells called synapses please join<br>me in welcoming Professor bu leech to<br>her inaugural professorial lecture<br>people places and connection the<br>importance of networks and connections<br>thank<br>you thank you Vice Chancellor and pro-<br>vice Chancellor for your kind words of<br>welcome and introduction I think you've<br>first given my talk for me I also want<br>to thank everyone in the audience for<br>attending my IPL and those joining<br>online especially family sitting up for<br>this I'm really honored and humbled and<br>delighted that you're here with me on<br>this<br>occasion and a very special thank you to<br>my daughter bethan and her husband Sam<br>and Sam's parents who have flown down<br>from Oakland to be here<br>tonight no my Hari<br>kidaa a 100,000 welcomes and Irish to<br>you all you can tell from the accent I'm<br>Irish I want to begin my IPL by<br>acknowledging and honoring my parents<br>their love and support were instrumental<br>in getting me to this point where I am<br>today my mother died last year and my<br>father a few years before her from<br>Alzheimer's disease they were always my<br>Champions encouraging and supporting me<br>in all my academic Pursuits and<br>interests this inaugural professorial<br>them I also want to acknowledge the love<br>and support of my my other family<br>members back in Ireland and in the UK my<br>sister June brother Aaron and my nieces<br>Rachel and Miriam and Miriam's two<br>little boys my great nephews Ezra and<br>Amos and also my brother's daughters um<br>who are all watching online with<br>me<br>so I think that already you've got the<br>gist of my talk but I'll still run<br>through what prepared the title of my<br>talk is people places and connections<br>the importance of networks and contacts<br>for a healthy brain I've chosen this<br>title because in the IPL as Megan has<br>already said I want to H acknowledge who<br>has been important to me in my life and<br>getting to this position so I'll be look<br>telling you about the people and places<br>in the first half of the talk and then<br>I'll be telling you in more detail about<br>connections because connections refers<br>not just to people and places but to the<br>synapses the connections in the brain<br>that I've been studying over the last 30<br>years as Megan has said my research<br>interests are in cellular and molecular<br>Neuroscience specifically the structural<br>and functional development of brain<br>sinapsis and their dysfunction and brain<br>disorders so I'll be explaining to you<br>the development of brain synapses and<br>disorder as it's traditional in ipls<br>I'll be taking you on a journey of my<br>career path point my Pathway to this<br>point but first I need to introduce you<br>to the world of<br>Neuroscience Neuroscience is a study of<br>the whole nervous system with a primary<br>focus on the<br>brain your brain is amazing it has over<br>86 billion nerve cells called neurons to<br>give you an analogy that's equivalent to<br>the 100 billion stars in the Milky way<br>roughly brain cells talk to each other<br>synapses there are over a 100 trillion<br>synapses in your brain a synoptic<br>contact actually has a gap of about 20<br>to 30 nanometers now just to give you a<br>sort of scope on that um if you were to<br>take one hair from your head for those<br>of you who have them that would be 2,000<br>times thinner than a so that size that<br>Gap is 2,000 times thinner than a single<br>hair from your head so to see the Gap<br>you need in an electron<br>microscope this is what a sign up looks<br>like in the microscope it's taken from<br>our work and it's magnified 100,000<br>times so what you're seeing in this is<br>just let me get my pointer up for you<br>this is the preoptic site and these are<br>little vesicles and these vesicles<br>contain chemical called<br>neurotransmitters so the<br>neurotransmitter inside those vesicles<br>can either be excitatory like glutamate<br>or inhibitory like Gaba and when the<br>chemical is released into the Gap it<br>binds to receptor proteins on the other<br>side and allows the cell to communicate<br>at these chemical<br>synapses so on this schematic you can<br>see a schematic of a urine it has a cell<br>body called a Soma it's got the nucleus<br>with the DNA the instructions for making<br>proteins in the cell and it's got a long<br>axon and down that axon an electrical<br>signal travels and it causes chemical in<br>the pr synaptic terminals to be released<br>into the Gap that binds on to The<br>receptors on these dendrites which are<br>branch-like processes that come off the<br>cell body and then it causes the signal<br>to travel down the next urine so you<br>have an electrical signal turning into a<br>chemical signal into an electrical<br>signal and so the nerve impulse is<br>propagated from neuron to<br>neurin each neuron is actually connected<br>to many other neurons forming these<br>complex<br>networks these networks can comprise<br>hundreds even thousands of neurons and<br>they communicate with each other at<br>incredible<br>speed neurons transmit information to<br>other neurons and to muscles and tissues<br>throughout the body body that allows you<br>to think move feel and comprehend the<br>world around you this image is taken<br>from a brain mapping project and what<br>you're seeing on it is a stand in<br>pseudocolors twise a single neuron and<br>it's being connected by connected to by<br>four 4,000 different axons so this is<br>part of a 10-year project by Google and<br>Jeff liman's lab to M the brain and you<br>can see from the complexity of that that<br>there is lots of interactions between<br>different neurons in the cells in the<br>brain so understanding how each of these<br>nerve cells is connected to others is<br>important in answering fundamental<br>questions like how memories made and<br>what goes wrong in neurological diseases<br>that's what I'm interested in as a<br>neuroscientist however I did not begin<br>my academic career as a<br>neuroscientist so how did I get here<br>okay I was born in Belfast County Anum<br>Northern Ireland Northern Ireland's<br>colorcoded on this as yellow and you can<br>see that Northern Ireland is part of the<br>United Kingdom and I was born in Belfast<br>and the antrum coast is famous for<br>things like the Giants Causeway my<br>father was from Belfast in Northern<br>Ireland and my mother from the south of<br>Ireland from Monahan and they met and<br>Dublin when they were first married they<br>lived in Belfast next to the botanical<br>gardens my father worked in the<br>chemistry Department in Queens<br>University on the other side of the<br>park June my sister was born first and<br>then I followed two years later and then<br>five years after me my brother Aaron and<br>when uh by this time my parents had<br>moved H Southwest from Belfast about 10<br>I attended FR school lisbourne which was<br>a Quaker School and is a Quaker School<br>it ranks amongst the top grammar schools<br>in Northern Ireland entrance into<br>grammar school at this time was based on<br>an examination taken at age 11 so I<br>studied all three Sciences at school and<br>in my final year was a prefect and then<br>Deputy head<br>girl I went on to study zoology at<br>Queens University Belfast and my honors<br>project was in parisology with Professor<br>Dave Halton who was a truly<br>inspirational teacher he fired my<br>passion in parasitology and I graduated<br>from Queens University Belfast with a<br>BSC honors in Zoology and at that point<br>I was strongly encouraged to consider<br>doing a PhD however I didn't want to<br>continue a further three years in a<br>research<br>program my plan was to undertake a<br>one-year postgraduate course course in<br>parasitology with the intention of<br>eventually working overseas with a<br>development agency in Africa that's what<br>I wanted to do so I applied for and was<br>awarded a scholarship from the<br>Department of Education Northern Ireland<br>to study for a one year's master's<br>degree in<br>parasitology the scholarship allowed me<br>the freedom to choose where to study for<br>my Master's Degree including the London<br>and Liverpool School of tropical<br>medicine in England but I ultimately<br>chose to go to Banger University in<br>North Wales they also offered a<br>one-year's postgraduate Masters in<br>parasitology and my decision to go there<br>was influenced by how beautiful North<br>Wales is places mattered to me and they<br>still do as you'll see throughout this<br>talk I didn't want to live and study in<br>a large city like London or Liverpool<br>Banger is a small Cathedral City located<br>between the mountains of Sidonia<br>National Park and the anglish SE<br>Heritage<br>Coastline so after my masters I again<br>was encouraged by my lectures that I<br>should stay on at Banger and do a PhD<br>they wanted me to stay there and said<br>that it would be better for me to do<br>that before embarking on any overseas<br>work in Africa so I wrote a PhD research<br>proposal to work in Alan probert's lab<br>and applied for a personal scholarship<br>from the Department of Education<br>Northern<br>Ireland my PhD was on the human parasite<br>shista hematobium this is a blood fluke<br>that lives in the blood vessels around<br>the bladder and it causes the disease B<br>Hara schistosomiasis affects about 240<br>million people worldwide it is ranked<br>second only to malaria amongst the<br>parasitic diseases with the greatest<br>socioeconomic<br>impact my PhD research was using Ultra<br>structural techniques to De to study<br>these parasites and their pathology and<br>the effects of drug<br>treatment it was the skills that I<br>developed in electron microscopy<br>techniques during my PhD that were to<br>prove important to my future career I<br>was awarded my PhD in parasitology and<br>then planned to take a break and travel<br>in Europe while deciding on my next<br>career step I was now having doubts<br>about working overseas in a developing<br>country it was at this stage that I was<br>called to interview for the position of<br>ELR microscopist heading the EM unit in<br>the Pathology Department of the Midland<br>Center for neurosurgery and Neurology in<br>Birmingham so I decided to accept the<br>position while I was deciding on which<br>career direction to pursue and it turned<br>out to be a life-changing decision for<br>me it was at these meetings that I met<br>Professor Edward Hitchcock I'd been to<br>it gave me wonderful in h opportunities<br>this position because I was presenting<br>ultr structural findings of and selected<br>cases at clinical meetings alongside the<br>pathologist and at these me meetings I<br>met Professor Edward Hitchcock a<br>consultant neurosurgeon who was a<br>Pioneer in stereotactic techniques for<br>brain surgery and functional<br>neurosurgery he invited me to watch him<br>observe him during stereotactic<br>operations and patients and also when H<br>brain biopsies were being taken for<br>specialist am analysis by me so this<br>launch me in a completely new Direction<br>it marked the start of my career in<br>Neuroscience I decided I wanted to<br>undertake Neuroscience research but not<br>in Birmingham I said I disliked living<br>in a large city in the English Midlands<br>from far from the sea and I'm aware that<br>Birmingham so I resigned from the<br>position um and accepted a post-doctoral<br>research position in your sence at St<br>Scotland I absolutely loved living in St<br>Andrews working and living by the sea I<br>learned to scuba dive when I was there<br>and went horse riding on the nearby<br>KES I was working on a joint<br>collaborative project between three<br>principal investigators Bob Pitman Jim<br>Cobb and Bill heitler and my<br>post-doctoral research was into<br>structural and functional development of<br>electrical synapses now these are also<br>called Gap Junctions because they occur<br>in other tissues as well the Gap at the<br>junction as you can see in this<br>schematic is much narrower than the Gap<br>that I previously described to you in<br>chemical<br>synapses it's bridged by these thin<br>tubes that allow ions to pass directly<br>between cells so at electrical sinapsis<br>you've got very rapid exchange of ions<br>and very rapid um propagation of an<br>electrical<br>signal and this is what it looks like in<br>the EM you can see two sides of the<br>membrane and you can see the channels<br>across<br>it electrical copses were first<br>discovered in crayfish because they<br>caused that very aive for that very fast<br>flip tail Escape response and they've<br>been studied very widely so I published<br>five papers from my post-doctoral<br>research on these electrical<br>sinapsis and while I was in St Andrews I<br>attended my first Neuroscience<br>International Conference over in Toronto<br>in Canada after the conference I went on<br>a seminar speaking tour to universities<br>on the west coast of<br>America including San Diego Berkeley and<br>Davis then back to the east coast to<br>Colombia Yale and Harvard before then<br>returning to Toronto and back to St<br>Andrews<br>in St Andrews we were also collaborating<br>with professor John pittz and Malcolm<br>finbo at The beatson Institute for<br>cancer research which is a very famous<br>Institute they were generating<br>antibodies to label proteins at Gap<br>Junctions that's important for all types<br>of cells including cancer cells and we<br>were collaborating with them to use<br>their antibodies to label the proteins<br>in electrical copses at the EM level of<br>resolution which was technically very<br>difficult but we managed to do that on<br>isolated Gap Junctions and published the<br>findings I was then offered a position<br>in the beatson<br>Institute but at the same time I was<br>invited to interview at the University<br>of Cambridge by Professor Malcolm<br>buroughs a fellow of the Royal Society<br>and professor of Neuroscience he offered<br>me a position in his lab in the<br>department of zoology so I decided to go<br>to<br>Cambridge in Malcolm's laboratory we had<br>freedom to work on our own project I<br>could direct what I wanted to do myself<br>so long as we were using the Locust<br>nervous system to investigate<br>neurobiological questions now you might<br>ask yourself why locusts well<br>invertebrates like locusts are used in<br>neurobiological research as they<br>relatively simple nervous systems fewer<br>neurons larger axons that are easily<br>impaled so that you can study structure<br>and function and behavior in the one<br>organism and lots of the Pioneers in<br>neurobiology have used invertebrates<br>nervous systems Malcolm was author of<br>the book The neurobiology of the insect<br>brain at Cambridge I researched gabig<br>and ambition and you'll see later in the<br>talk gaban ambition is important to my<br>later work and within neural networks in<br>the Locust and the development of<br>inhibitory<br>synapses I also was collaborating with<br>gon who was a postto in Malcolm's lab as<br>well and we undertook painstaking<br>experiments back into the embryonic<br>Lucas brain I was also continuing my<br>collaboration with Bob Pitman from St<br>Andrews looking at modulation of<br>transmitter release from muscarinic<br>copses and again muscarinic copses will<br>become important to you in the later<br>talk we all worked extremely hard in<br>those days sometimes we were in the lab<br>through the night for timed experiments<br>but we also played hard I remember very<br>competitive team field games and<br>playoffs between other labs and Science<br>Park companies and on one Infamous<br>occasion many of us ended up in Aden<br>Brook's hospital with injuries after a<br>particularly competitive game of<br>reers and as we got in they kept saying<br>are you from the reers game and we said<br>yes anyway it was while I was at<br>Cambridge I also made the first of<br>multiple invited research visits to the<br>prestigious Californian Institute of<br>Technology or Caltech in Pasadena to<br>engage in collaborative research<br>projects there I was hosted by J Lon who<br>had by now been appointed as a new<br>professor<br>there after my post-doctoral research at<br>Cambridge the time came to set up my own<br>lab one of the lectureships I was<br>offered at that time was at the<br>University of Durham I decided to accept<br>the position at Durham University where<br>I became one of the founder members of<br>the new BSC honors biomedical degree<br>program at Queens<br>campus accepting that ship at durm<br>University turned out to be one of my<br>best career and personal decisions as<br>that is where I met my darling husband<br>Nigel who was already an established<br>academic there in the department of<br>biological sciences teaching and<br>researching in behavioral ecology and<br>conservation and doing work with film<br>companies documentary wild<br>films so we were married in Durham and<br>niga planned a surprise monthong<br>honeymoon in this shells and then in<br>Africa including a horseback Safari so I<br>got to see Africa with Nigel and there's<br>a whole series of other TS to tell with<br>that regarding my level of priess with<br>riding and saying that you had a Gallop<br>out of treble anyway I had doubts about<br>whether I'd be able to do that but we<br>got back safely and back in Durham I was<br>setting up new projects using rodent<br>models to study changes in synaptic<br>proteins at sinaps as underlying brain<br>disorders so so I had a number of<br>projects underway but I was also had<br>ongoing projects on Locust with jilon at<br>Caltech it was while I was on a research<br>visit to Caltech that I suffered my<br>first<br>miscarriage the first of six in total I<br>flew back to Durham and was admitted to<br>hospital after further miscarriages<br>Nigel and I moved to the countryside<br>with our horses for a better work life<br>balance following the advice of my<br>consultant to reduce<br>stress and in the following year which<br>was the New Millennium a host of births<br>occurred including our darling baby<br>daughter<br>bethan I wasn't allowed to work by my<br>consultant throughout the pregnancies<br>and as soon as I was pregnant with<br>bethan he stopped me from working and I<br>had a Year's maternity leave and after<br>betham was born I was off then for a<br>while for quite a while so I effectively<br>had two 2 years break while the period<br>that betham was born from<br>Academia fast forward four years bethan<br>is now four years old and in her first<br>year at Durham High School for Girls I<br>am back teaching and running my research<br>lab at durm University but I now decided<br>to stop traveling overseas and<br>collaborative research visits while<br>young Nigel um was still continuing to<br>do his research and teaching in the<br>university and taking students on field<br>Expeditions over to South America and<br>South Africa at this time and then Nigel<br>was offered a professorship in Zoology<br>at the University of West Indies in<br>Trinidad and also to set up a<br>biodiversity Institute in the<br>Caribbean we were all set to go but at<br>the last minute pulled the plug on it<br>due to health concerns with Nigel and<br>around about this time Nigel spotted a<br>lecture ship advertised at otago<br>University that was in my field Nigel<br>knew that I was interested in living and<br>working in New Zealand it had a<br>reputation for being green and clean<br>which appealed to me so he said if I<br>wanted to apply he would support me and<br>back me so I did apply and was offered<br>the<br>position so then we had to decide should<br>we stay or should we go by this time we<br>were ready for a new challenge but it<br>was still a difficult decision to give<br>up two permanent academic positions at a<br>prestigious un first day in the UK the<br>final decision to go was based on two<br>main factors first the head of<br>department at Durham Brian Huntley and<br>the University of Durham offered to hold<br>Nigel's position open for three years if<br>we wanted to return and secondly we had<br>a guaranteed place for bethan at Columba<br>College by the principal Miss Wilson at<br>that time and so we came to New<br>Zealand we arrived in New Zealand in<br>August 2005 I was appointed as a senior<br>lecturer in the department of anatomy<br>and structural biology as Megan said it<br>was then called by Professor Helen<br>Nicholson who was the head of department<br>at that<br>time so now I want to change gear and<br>tell you more about my research here at<br>otago my research interest since coming<br>to otago have<br>included investigating how changes in<br>synoptic proteins resulting from genetic<br>mutations caused functional<br>abnormalities underlying brain disorders<br>such as childhood absence epilepsy and<br>Associated comorbid behavioral and<br>psychiatric disorders another focus of<br>my interest has been into the synthesis<br>of new proteins at synapses during<br>synaptic<br>plasticity synaptic plasticity is the<br>ability of synapses to change allowing<br>them to adapt to new information which<br>is important for learning and memory I'm<br>interested in how altered local protein<br>synthesis at synapses May contribute to<br>synaptic dysfunction and cognitive<br>deficits underlying degenerative brain<br>disorders such as Alzheimer's disease so<br>now I want to tell you a little bit<br>about one of those topics childhood<br>absence epilepsy that we've been<br>investigating a major research focus of<br>my lab has been on childhood absence<br>epilepsy to investigate underlying<br>cellular and molecular mechanisms<br>causing seizures in these children this<br>is fundamental to identifying targets<br>for future future treatment<br>strategies childhood absence epilepsy<br>affects children around the age of 4 to<br>14 years old and accounts for 10 to 177%<br>of all cases of epilepsy in school AED<br>children epilepsy is actually a group of<br>diseases it's not a single disorder and<br>it's characterized by epileptic<br>seizures so although there are many<br>different types of epilepsies you can<br>divide them into two main groups focal<br>and generalized focal epilepsies are<br>those ones that originate from abnormal<br>firing of brain circuits in one part of<br>the brain on one hemisphere generalized<br>applies to both hemispheres so in<br>generalized there are groups of neurons<br>that are firing off in both sides both<br>hemispheres and childhood absence<br>epilepsy fits within the generalized<br>category so to investigate the<br>underlying mechanisms causing epileptic<br>seizures in these children we use a<br>rodent model which has naturally<br>occurring absent seizures this is the<br>Stargazer mice the m has spontaneous<br>absent seizures that appear at a<br>developmental stage in the mous that is<br>equivalent to the age of their onset in<br>children so the key things that I want<br>you to remember as we go forward in this<br>lecture is these types of genetic are<br>these types of generalized seizures<br>affecting both sides of the brain and<br>the child are genetic in origin so<br>they're genetic they're generalized on<br>both sides of the brain and they're<br>non-convulsive they comprise just brief<br>periods of a few seconds of<br>unresponsiveness where the child might<br>look like they're vacant staring off<br>into space and often it's picked up at<br>school the child might be accused of<br>daydreaming not paying attention so<br>they're called<br>absences but the key features are they<br>have a hmark signature on an EEG a braan<br>uh recording of called a spike wave dis<br>charge a spike and a wave That's a<br>classic feature that is for absent<br>seizures associated with behavioral<br>arrest when the child starts moving it's<br>probably best Illustrated if I show you<br>a YouTube video that of a little boy<br>having an absent seizure that his father<br>has posted on YouTube but he's recorded<br>it because clinicians often want to see<br>a video of a child when they reported is<br>having a seizure you're going to see him<br>blowing on a rag that induces an ABS and<br>seizure and it'll only last a few<br>seconds and then<br>H he will start blowing when he comes<br>out of the seizure but he doesn't hear<br>his father calling him and he's unaware<br>of anything that's happening at the time<br>so he's blowing and I'll tell you he's<br>about to go into the seizure now just<br>stares blankly into space he doesn't<br>know what's going on either so he's<br>totally unaware doesn't hear his father<br>calling his name when he comes out he<br>starts blowing again now that doesn't<br>look particularly dramatic and indeed it<br>used to be called Petty mile seizures<br>because it was less dramatic than the<br>the tonac clonic seizures that people<br>think about when they think of epilepsy<br>seizures where somebody has a convulsion<br>falls to the ground and starts to jerk<br>around in absent seizures the child will<br>just be vacant like that for a short<br>period of time but that can happen<br>hundreds of times a day and we know know<br>that these are not benign there are a<br>number of comorbidities associated with<br>these seizures and there are dangers<br>that if a child was to have one of these<br>seizures if they're not accompanied they<br>could draw if they were in a swimming<br>pool or if they were out cycling and<br>there are all sorts of other things<br>going on with these seizures so they're<br>certainly not benign even though they<br>don't look traumatic so what is the<br>solution anti- measure anti-seizure<br>medications as in all cases of epilepsy<br>are usually the first line of treatment<br>and for childhood absence epilepsy one<br>of the drugs that is the first line drug<br>used even after F 50 years of being H<br>since it was made is ethos sumide so<br>this was produced 50 years ago it's<br>specific for childhood absence epilepsy<br>but as with all anti-epileptic drugs<br>it's only effective in about 70% of<br>patients and there are side effects so<br>that means there's a 30% failure rate<br>and they cannot cure epilepsy they only<br>aim to reduce the seizures so there's a<br>desperate need to have more targeted<br>drugs that are more effective and<br>specific for an individual P patient<br>that are targeting their targeting their<br>underlying mechanisms so there are fewer<br>side effects and they're more effective<br>and to develop such drugs you need to<br>know what's happening down at the<br>cellular and molecular level to be able<br>to identify targets that could be used<br>for future drug<br>treatments so what I want to do is just<br>show you in this slide what we do know<br>from human and animal models so in mod<br>models just like in humans they have the<br>characteristic Spike wave discharges<br>with the behavioral arrest okay<br>we also know from uh uh MRI functional<br>MRI studies in humans and also from<br>tests in animals that these Spike wave<br>discharges on the EEG arise within<br>circuits connecting the cortex to the<br>thalmus so you can see in this schematic<br>where the thalmus is on it so we know<br>those factors but what we don't know<br>fully is what's going wrong Within These<br>circuits down at that cellular and<br>molecular level that's resp responsible<br>for causing the seizures so that's what<br>we've been interested in looking at is<br>what's going on at that level in our<br>mice model so first of all bear with me<br>I've got to introduce you to the CTC<br>Network I promise this will be painless<br>so what I'm going to do is just show you<br>a section A schematic taken out of the<br>brain at the level of the thalmus so if<br>I magnify this on the right side this is<br>grossly simplified but what you can see<br>here is a representation of the cortex<br>and this is the thalmus which is beneath<br>the cortex and the thalmus is made up of<br>many different parts but one of the key<br>Parts is the dorsal thalmus and then<br>around the outside there's another part<br>of the thalmus called the rtn reticular<br>thalamic nucleus all you need to know is<br>that this has got a shell of inhibitor<br>urines in it so the thalmus is the<br>Gateway for sensory information coming<br>in from outside the brain it comes in<br>and<br>there are excitatory cells in the<br>thalmus they send a connection up to the<br>cortex<br>excitatory and the cortex sends an<br>excitory connection back down to them<br>the important thing is there are<br>also these inhibitory inter urin that<br>are in that shell of exclusively<br>inhibitory inter urin around the outside<br>of the thalmus and they're putting on<br>inhibition<br>onto these excitatory urans and there's<br>the equivalent up in the cortex inhibit<br>inter neurons there too bear with me so<br>I'm going to tell you a little bit more<br>about those inhibitory urin here they<br>are up in the cortex they've got Gaba in<br>them an inhibitory transmitter and down<br>here in this shell around the thalmus<br>there are the inhibitory urin again and<br>what they do is they're strategically<br>placed so they can act almost like the<br>braks preventing runaway excitation so<br>when the excitatory cells in the cortex<br>and in the thus are firing to stop those<br>overfiring you have inhibition within<br>the system that's grossly simplified but<br>the key thing is in the normal system<br>the way that these inhibitory and<br>excitatory neurons interact with each<br>other underlies a normal oscillatory<br>Rhythm within the thalmus okay that's<br>processing sensory information coming<br>out and somehow that gets transformed<br>into a<br>pathological uh Rhythm that is<br>represented by that Spike wave discharge<br>it means that there are neurons firing<br>excessively together causing the spike<br>wave discharge that underlies absent<br>seizures and what we want to find out is<br>how is that happening so to do that we<br>use a rodent model this little mouse the<br>Stargazer mous has the classic features<br>of Spike wave discharges absent seizures<br>it stops walking when it's having them<br>so there's behavioral arrest when it<br>comes out of the seizures it continues<br>walking<br>and I said to you that these seizures<br>are genetic in origin so there's<br>something gone wrong in the genes on it<br>so it's easier to look at this in a<br>moist model because it's got a single<br>genetic mutation in this little mo model<br>the mutated Gene encodes for proteins<br>genes make proteins and proteins carry<br>out the functions in the cell and the<br>Protein that's mutated in these little<br>mice is called stargazing after the<br>little mous but it turns out out that<br>this protein is in fact one of a group<br>of a family of proteins called tarps now<br>before you start to go to sleep you<br>don't need to worry about that all you<br>need to know is that the job it does<br>it's almost like a little bus shuttle it<br>Associates with receptors called ampa<br>receptors ampa receptors are receptors<br>that respond to glutamate and so they<br>are responsible for the fast excitation<br>in the nervous system and what these<br>little proteins do is they associate<br>with the fully formed H Amper receptor<br>which is four uh proteins and they<br>shuttle them up into the position in the<br>post synaptic membrane where they can<br>respond to glutamate and cause the urine<br>to fire okay so if you have a gene<br>that's mutated and it's not properly<br>producing a protein that's responsible<br>for putting Amper receptors into the<br>syapse you get Amper receptor deficits<br>so what we wanted to do was to find out<br>within the CTC Network where are their<br>Amper receptor deficits where could<br>those be targeted and do they actually<br>cause seizures or something further down<br>the<br>track so ultimately we did a huge number<br>of experiments at different levels but<br>we had to come down to the EM level so<br>that we could look at Amper receptors at<br>the sinapse in our epileptic little<br>Stargazer mice and also<br>non-epileptic H littermates because we<br>wanted to see and do uh quantitative<br>analysis to see the relative density of<br>Amper receptors both in the epileptic<br>and the non-epileptic moist and at which<br>synapses is were occurring at so this is<br>what this is showing you it's just a<br>schematic of the fact that if you fix<br>tissue for the EM what you are doing is<br>you're cross-linking proteins to get<br>really lovely ultr structural detail but<br>that destroys the proteins so you have<br>to do fancy Em All different sorts of<br>techniques that need to be adjusted for<br>each protein where you're doing minimal<br>fixation it's a bit like fixing the the<br>proteins is a bit like cooking an egg<br>you're coagulating the egg and so that's<br>no good when we want to label the<br>proteins in it so what we do is we do<br>fixing that is very light using freeze<br>substitution all sorts of things don't<br>worry about it all you need to know is<br>to identify these Amper receptors we<br>take one antibody to a protein in the<br>Amper receptor<br>and we label it in our special tissue<br>fixation method that doesn't destroy the<br>protein and then we take a second<br>antibody to that first antibody which<br>has a gold Probe on it now the gold<br>probe is electron dense so you can see<br>it in the AM and that's what you're<br>seeing here are these dots are the gold<br>prob labeling relatively labeling the<br>Amper receptor so that's what we<br>did two PhD students in lab Susanna<br>Barrett and alus sheta were working on<br>this project and they were looking at<br>Amper receptors down in the<br>thalmus so what they did they took<br>hundreds and hundreds of sections and<br>did labeling to get the relative Quant<br>quantity of gold labeling in<br>non-epileptic littermates compared to<br>the Stargazer epileptic mice and in a<br>nutshell there was a significant<br>reduction of Amper receptors in the<br>epileptic<br>mous but there were only occurring at<br>copses onto these inhibitory neurons<br>which is<br>important Nadia another PhD in the lab<br>was working on a project up in the<br>cortex and she was looking to see<br>whether or not Amper receptors were also<br>lost in the cortex on these inhibine<br>urines but this required a bit further<br>step on it because our inhibine urines<br>weren't in a nice shell that we could<br>take a plug out of the shell and know it<br>was just inhibit urines these were mixed<br>in with all sorts of other neurons and<br>so we had to use a second antibody<br>against a protein inside these<br>inhibitory inter neurons and that<br>protein is parvalbumin so that's just<br>important to remember that these<br>inhibitory urines as well as having Gaba<br>neurotransmitter which is inhibitory<br>they also have a protein called parval<br>and PV and we could identify it with a<br>larger gold probe so anyway the key H<br>feature of this is again there was a<br>significant reduction in the epileptic<br>mice at Amper receptors onto these<br>inhibitory urin so that meant that<br>activating putting on the brakes there<br>was nothing there to put on the brakes<br>on these uh interneurons both in the<br>cortex and in the thalmus and<br>importantly Nadia also went back and did<br>this on postembryonic stages early<br>stages and we could show that these this<br>loss of Amper receptors was happening<br>just before the onset of seizures so<br>therefore they could be causitive of the<br>seizures that was important to establish<br>because another PhD working in my lab<br>Steve se he was working on Gaba<br>receptors and we'd shown that there were<br>alterations in Gaba receptors and this<br>was published in the international<br>league against epilepsy's uh own uh<br>Journal very high ranking epilepsia and<br>it featured on the front cover and we<br>were able to show that the changes in<br>the Gaba receptors were happen happening<br>after the seizures so they weren't<br>causing them but there were a downstream<br>effect probably<br>compensatory anyway to put that all<br>together for you in the Stargazer it has<br>a genetic mutation that affects the<br>protein stargazing which is a tarp that<br>shuttles these Amper receptors into the<br>PV inurance and the PV inurance put on<br>the brakes put on feet forward<br>inhibition so if you don't have ample<br>receptors on them it's like cutting the<br>brakes<br>cables you can't slow down or stop the<br>overe excitation in the system so if we<br>lose feed forward inhibition is that<br>causing absent seizures in these<br>mice well to prove that we needed to do<br>another series of<br>experiments and we asked the question is<br>if we silence these PV interneurons in<br>normal mice does it cause seizures<br>because if it is causitive then if we<br>turn them off we should be able to see<br>ures and to do that we had to use more<br>Cutting Edge technology called dread<br>technology now I know you're starting to<br>groan under the names I'm giving you but<br>bear with me I'll try to make this<br>simple designer receptors dread stands<br>for designer receptor exclusively<br>activated by designer drug and basically<br>these designer receptors so The<br>receptors in the sinapse have been<br>engineered so that will no longer<br>respond to any chemical any<br>neurotransmitter in the brain but only<br>to synthetic drug a designer drug okay<br>so it's a bit like changing the locks in<br>a door you're changing the locks in your<br>sinapse so what we do is we take a a<br>designer receptor which is like our new<br>lock and when we apply our designer drug<br>to it we can control whether the cell<br>fires or whether we silence it okay now<br>you remember I talked about muscarinic<br>receptors before the actual designer<br>receptor is a modified muscarinic<br>receptor all you need to know don't<br>worry about this all you need to know is<br>that we've got oh we've got a receptor<br>that naturally occurs that is responsive<br>to acetycholine okay so they're called G<br>protein coupled receptors because the<br>receptor has associated with it a g<br>protein and that g protein sets off a TR<br>of events that will cause a cell to fire<br>or to be inhibited if it's got a GI<br>protein then it decreases neuronal<br>firing if it's got a GQ protein it<br>increases neuronal firing okay so that's<br>all you need to know so we've got a g<br>dread an engineered receptor that now<br>will only respond to our designer drug<br>which is CNO and if we apply CNO to the<br>G dread we get neuronal silencing if we<br>apply to a GQ dread we get neuronal<br>Activation so what we wanted to do was<br>put our designer drug into our PV urines<br>apply our drug and silence the PV inter<br>urine in normal animals and see if we<br>get seizures alternatively we want to<br>put in the excitatory dread so that we<br>can activate the PV inter urin and and<br>an animal that has seizures to see if we<br>can control the seizures so that's the<br>theory of what what we wanted to do of<br>course you have to get these into the<br>animals okay so again we used breeding<br>and all you need to know from this is<br>that we have a GI dread mice shown here<br>in this gray and green and we have PV<br>cream mice they're both transgenic mice<br>they don't have any epilepsy but this<br>mice has the inhibitory dread already in<br>its cells but it's not activated there's<br>it's got the Machinery to make it but<br>there's a stop signal but if it is<br>crossed with this transgenic mice it's<br>got like the molecular scissors that can<br>cut out that stop signal and it can do<br>it just in PV cells or whatever cream<br>mice it is so effectively we could use<br>this to create GI dread mice that only<br>had the designer receptor in the PV<br>neurons and then half the litter would<br>be non dread<br>controls so that's what sandish another<br>p D in my lab did he came to work in<br>this project with me and he took the GI<br>dread mice and we recorded from them<br>just like we would record from a child's<br>brain and then video them see what they<br>were doing we would did recordings and<br>video on mice moving around and before<br>CNO this is just what the trace would<br>look like as soon as we applied the CNO<br>the designer drug we were activating our<br>inhibitory dread so we were silencing<br>the the the firing of these urin in<br>normal animals and we got bursts of<br>Spike wave discharges and the Animals<br>stopped moving around and then when it<br>came out them it moved again so we had<br>our classic features Spike wave<br>discharges on the EG and behavioral<br>arrest and you didn't get any effect if<br>you just injected a solution in which<br>the drug was dissolved you had to have<br>the CNO drug and then sandes repeated<br>this on non-read controls and there was<br>no effect so we had shown in this<br>experiment that if we use dread<br>technology to silence those PV<br>inurance we get Spike wave discharges<br>and behavior arrest which are the<br>Hallmark features of absent<br>seizures and in the alternative<br>experiment where we induced absent<br>seizures in animals and used an<br>excitatory H dread technology so that we<br>could excite feed forward inhibition<br>during the seizure that prevented and<br>reduced the number of SP with<br>discharges so impaired feed forward<br>inhibition may be just one underlying<br>mechanism for Spike wave discharges in a<br>population of patients with absent<br>seizures it's never as simple as that in<br>patients they have many different genes<br>that are affected it's polygenic so we<br>have different models this is just one<br>model that's spontaneous at seizure so<br>this might be one mechanism for in<br>patients who would have this underlying<br>abnormality<br>what's key is that we need to discover<br>the different types of changes at the<br>genetic level at the cellular molecular<br>level that would be targets that could<br>be used and directed new drugs<br>towards so now I breathe this doesn't<br>take too long the next one I want to<br>tell you about is just briefly uh some<br>of our uh interests in local protein<br>synthesis at<br>sinapsis in the next few slides I'm just<br>going to tell you about a collaboration<br>with the max plank Institute for Brain<br>Research in Frankfurt and Germany H Erin<br>Schuman is the director there and we<br>have collaborated on this project now<br>previously I said to you genes make<br>proteins and proteins carry out the<br>function in the cell and in most cells<br>in the body you have a nice cell and a<br>cell body and a nucleus with the<br>information to make the protein and the<br>protein can be used in that cell in<br>neurons because of their long accents<br>and dendrites it's not so<br>straightforward proteins uh might need<br>to be transported right to the end of<br>those axonal terminals to be able to do<br>their job and the challenge is high<br>proteins can be supplied to remote<br>regions where copses are made with other<br>neurons synapses need to rapidly change<br>their proteins during learning and<br>memory so transport from the cell body<br>might be just too slow in some cases so<br>one solution is to make them locally<br>down at the syapse and there's been a<br>wealth of information to show that local<br>protein synthesis occurs in the dend<br>rights a insurans lab and others have<br>shown this for many years but it's been<br>very difficult to show that this is<br>happening on the pre synaptic site and<br>that's for a number of reasons to do<br>with size and techniques and everything<br>anyway we managed to do that using um<br>our combined expertise this was an inter<br>International collaboration between<br>scientists from uh the max plank<br>Institute otago and the institute for<br>Neuroscience in Bordeaux 3pi and<br>postdocs and effectively what we were<br>able to do was to show that the preoptic<br>site of the urine both in excitatory<br>preoptic Terminals and in inhibitory<br>preoptic terminals they had the<br>Machinery to make proteins on the<br>preoptic site and that furthermore the<br>axonal terminals were able to make<br>proteins that participate in synap<br>transmission so we used various adapted<br>metabolic labeling techniques high<br>resolution imaging of proteins being<br>made with these techniques at the<br>electromicroscope level and the<br>expansion level and this paper the Nova<br>findings culminated in a highly p h<br>highly cited publication in science one<br>of the highest ranking scientific<br>journals in the field and it received<br>enough citations to place it in the top<br>1% in its field so that concludes<br>includes an overview of some of the<br>important research I haven't been able<br>to cover a lot of the research that I've<br>done here inago with other<br>colleagues but I want to just<br>acknowledge the research funding for<br>this work we've been funded through<br>agencies here in New Zealand in Germany<br>in Europe and also in America for the<br>research I've told you of course as uh<br>Grant said research is just one aspect<br>of an academic's role teaching and<br>service are also an important part of<br>the job<br>I've taught Anatomy students at all<br>levels H through from first year hubs<br>right through to postgraduate and dental<br>and medical students and as Megan<br>already said I've been director of the<br>Neuroscience program from the beginning<br>of 2021 to the beginning of<br>2024 and during the time that I've been<br>director the otago Neuroscience Student<br>Association who are here tonight uh was<br>formed and they've been very active in<br>interacting with students and in<br>Outreach activities with the program so<br>we thank them and also one of my service<br>roles has been as chair of the<br>Neuroscience research group in anatomy I<br>was chair from 2014 to 2020 and the<br>Neuroscience research group in anatomy<br>at that time comprised 13 different<br>Laboratories and you can see on the<br>right hand side the pis that are<br>responsible for those Laboratories and<br>we held regular Retreats at St<br>Margaret's College H and had researched<br>speakers but as part of that uh ched<br>meetings and we had various um members<br>of the different Labs including from<br>mine and other labs who were going out<br>into schools and doing research into<br>schools and telling them about<br>neoscience and also at events at<br>festivals Etc and these groups were uh<br>spear headed by niik vral and Mick wats<br>so I want to acknowledge<br>them and in this slide which looks like<br>a lot of names on it on the left hand<br>side are some of the students from my<br>lab some of them have dinner at my house<br>and things on it and it's out for things<br>so I want to acknowledge that there were<br>a lot of people involved in different<br>levels of research that I haven't been<br>able to tell you about on the research<br>team I also want to acknowledge that<br>I've had uh a lot of help from my New<br>Zealand co-authors and collaborators and<br>from collaborators overseas and there's<br>been help obviously and support through<br>technical staff and support staff at all<br>levels from Client Services right the<br>way through to technicians and I had<br>some superb mentors and advisers since<br>coming to otago but I want to give a<br>special shout out to christe Kate and<br>Marcel these are my wow ladies and wow<br>stands for women in leadership at otago<br>and we were part of the women selected<br>in 2018 and we were put into a team and<br>we still re regularly meet and they<br>support me and we uh give each other<br>therapy so what I would like to just<br>finish off in the last two slides you're<br>glad it's the last two<br>slides a a big thank you to my family as<br>always my thoughts go back to my parents<br>who were amazing um my loving husband my<br>beautiful daughter and Sam the son I<br>never had he's a credit to his parents<br>and in the opening sequence because I<br>was getting Tongue Tied I should have<br>mentioned my nieces Nicola and Lauren my<br>brother's daughters and I mentioned rich<br>and Miriam and Miriam's two little boys<br>and it I loved my parents dearly and<br>still<br>do and the very final slide but not<br>least goes to my church family it's been<br>important to me throughout my career in<br>life all of my church connections and<br>the people who have supported me and<br>there's been so many of them but here at<br>KNX Church where bethan and Sam were<br>married and in High Gate we've had<br>wonderful H friends and supporters and<br>also Father Mark from the Catholic<br>Church who runs regular Retreats which<br>have just kept me uplifted throughout my<br>time at oo thank you very much and thank<br>you to God Amen<br>call Greg Anderson to which is to say<br>that I'm Greg Anderson I'm the head of<br>Department in the department of anatomy<br>and I come from some of the same places<br>that had been part of your journey uh a<br>little bit further back mine's two<br>generations back and that's why we sound<br>different so bu I want to thank you for<br>a wonderful talk and I'm going to come<br>back to that but um firstly also for all<br>that you've been to our department over<br>these last two decades and your passion<br>for Neuroscience has been evident in all<br>the aspects of what makes a professor<br>and your uh teaching in your service in<br>your research um for example through the<br>neuroscience program and um just to<br>mention one and I think I can safely on<br>behalf of your postgraduate students<br>really extend a thanks for the<br>mentorship that you've given so uh many<br>many<br>thanks well the synapse a I mean I I<br>think um we have our eyes have been<br>opened here whether we're<br>neuroscientists or people from um some<br>other skill set and background as to<br>this wonderful structure<br>and um not to not to downplay the what<br>was it 100 billion nerve cells that are<br>there but they don't do that much across<br>our lives don't change that much it's<br>those 100 trillion was it connections or<br>shapses that that are make us the<br>dynamic changes that we are as we learn<br>develop skills and then potentially um<br>neurological diseases as well so uh<br>you've illuminated the syapse and thank<br>you for the wonderful imagery as well<br>not necessarily in beautiful fluorescent<br>color because um the electron micros<br>microscopy it's not like that it's it's<br>claim to fame is the enormous zooming in<br>to a structure that's millionths of a<br>millimeter the sinapse and every one of<br>those dots am I right in saying that was<br>a single receptor is that quite right or<br>a small group of cluster of receptors I<br>mean the scale of the magnification that<br>you image well you showed yourself in<br>your opening slide this is the<br>biologist's equivalent of looking out<br>into the universe seeing things which<br>Can't Be Imagined with the naked eye so<br>thank you for Illuminating that for us<br>uh we have a gift to give you I'm told<br>here so it's just a small token of our<br>appreciation um so there you go and I<br>for those of you who can we would love<br>you to continue to celebrate with us we<br>have some drinks and nibbles over at the<br>staff club which just follow the crowd<br>but um it's one of the old brick<br>buildings across this way just one<br>minute's walk and so if you would like<br>to join us there that would be wonderful<br>thank you once again buer</p></main><footer style="margin-top: 2rem; background: #0001; padding: 2rem;
