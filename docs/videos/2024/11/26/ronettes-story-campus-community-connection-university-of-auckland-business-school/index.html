My majors for<br>Commerce are <br>Management and Innovation &amp; Entrepreneurship.<br>Leading up to my first day of university,<br>I was very much nervous.<br>But I think I was also very, very excited.<br>I just had heard so many stories<br>from my sisters,<br>you know, about their experience<br>and the fun they had,<br>but also what they learned,<br>not just academic wise,<br>but like in different cultures<br>and in different communities,<br>you know, and I was very excited for that.<br>Sadly, it was not what I expected.<br>It's not what I hoped and dreamed<br>it was. Because of Covid and lockdown.<br>I was just very, very blessed<br>that I had my sister there with me.<br>She knew my expectations of university<br>and how much I wanted to, to experience<br>different things in my first year.<br>And so she tried to make my experience<br>in lockdown the best she could.<br>So I was very, very<br>happy and grateful for her.<br>When we finally came back<br>to, you know, university in person,<br>I made the promise to myself<br>that I was going to,<br>take advantage of as many opportunities<br>as I could,<br>be involved as much as I can<br>and have a sense of home again.<br>Coming onto campus,<br>all of a sudden, I was surrounded<br>by so many different people.<br>I actually forgot how to interact<br>with people for a bit.<br>I kind of had to, like, force myself<br>to get out there and to,<br>to meet new people,<br>you know. I joined heaps of clubs<br>at the end of my second year.<br>The first club I ever joined<br>was the University<br>Samoan Student Association or UASSA<br>And that was the first club where I felt<br>that I found my family, found a home.<br>I later on joined Commerce ‘o Pasifika<br>or COP.<br>This is basically the Pacific Island <br>Student Association for Commerce students.<br>It's kind of like your family at work.<br>And lastly, I joined, Velocity.<br>So this is an Entrepreneur<br>&amp; Innovation student led programme.<br>It's allowing me to network<br>with, different people<br>who have similar or the same passions<br>and ambitions as me.<br>In each of these different clubs,<br>they've really shaped who I am today.<br>And they've really reminded me<br>that I can have a home away from home.<br>So I was born and<br>raised in the beautiful islands of Samoa.<br>My father is actually a fourth generation<br>cocoa farmer.<br>And so he's the main supplier<br>for the Samoa Origin chocolate bar<br>to Whittaker's.<br>He gives a lot to his community.<br>That energy and that drive to look after<br>people has really shaped who I am today.<br>I draw a lot from him,<br>and he's my main inspiration.<br>My Dad has always said to all of his kids<br>that his businesses are his dreams,<br>and he wants us to go and find our own.<br>My dreams or my goals are to<br>give back what my <br>community has done for me.<br>The love and the care<br>that I've had from my community<br>and the positive impact<br>they've had on my life,<br>I want the same for my sister or my younger siblings. <br>Yeah, it's very fulfilling.</p></main><footer style="margin-top: 2rem; background: #0001; padding: 2rem; text-align: center;"><p>We Are The University</p><ul style="list-style-type: none; padding: 0; margin: 0;"><li><a href="/">Home</a></li><li><a href="/about">About</a></li><li><a href="/contact">Contact</a></li></ul></footer></body></html>
