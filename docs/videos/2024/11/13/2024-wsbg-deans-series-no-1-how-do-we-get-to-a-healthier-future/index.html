It is shaped by the decisions we have made in the past and those we are making now. These choices encompass how we organize our society, structure and manage our economy, determine our investments, and decide whom we value and support. These pivotal decisions hinge on asking—and thoroughly answering—many critical questions.<br><br>The Dean's Series launched on September 5 with a dynamic panel discussion, "How do we get to a healthier future?" The event featured a lively exchange of ideas on creating a healthier world, enriched by numerous audience questions and comments. Chaired by Professor Bryson, the panel included Rob Campbell (Chancellor of AUT) and Professor Colin Simpson (Associate Dean of Research, Faculty of Health at VUW). Unfortunately, Ryl Jenson (CEO of the Digital Health Association) was unable to attend as planned.</p><h2>Transcript</h2><p style="opacity: 0.9; font-size: 0.8em">Transcripts may be automatically

welcome you<br>all here this morning to um the first of<br>um the dings series breakfast series of<br>looking at getting to a fairer future<br>for more healthy wealthy and<br>wise today we're focusing on healthy so<br>we we'll get underway um we're missing<br>our third speaker um hopefully real will<br>turn up I know that she was overseas<br>until yesterday<br>uh so possibly she's<br>jet is not but anyway we have I'm sure<br>plenty of discussion between Rob and<br>Colin uh and questions and comments from<br>the<br>floor so just as a a brief intro I I<br>believe that a key role of universities<br>and of A Faculty um like how which<br>combines business and<br>government um is to share our ability to<br>examine issues from different<br>perspectives uh and in this breakfast<br>series I've Drawn Together academic<br>staff and external speakers generally<br>alumni um to discuss the<br>topics and this morning we're kicking<br>off by focusing on how do we get to a<br>healthier future for<br>all and we have at the moment two great<br>speakers um I will introduce them all<br>they probably don't much introduction um<br>Rob Campbell um currently is the uh<br>Chancellor of aut University in<br>Oakland um and probably well known to<br>you all he's an experienced public and<br>private sector director and was the<br>initial chair of t water so well<br>positioned to give lots of views<br>on get to a healthier future for<br>all and um<br>Professor Colin Simpson is the professor<br>of population health and Associate te<br>research uh here at T and the faculty of<br>health and um thank you to the AC de of<br>Health for letting me borrow one of your<br>staff um and Colin is a public health<br>expert um focusing on epidemiology of<br>respiratory and infectious disease<br>vaccine evaluation and Improvement of<br>the health and wellbeing of Pop<br>ations so we've got two great people to<br>kick this discussion off the process<br>will be that I will um get each of them<br>to speak for eight or 10 minutes um on<br>what they see is the key challenges to<br>get to a healthier future<br>for and then I will get to speak for<br>five or so minutes each on what they see<br>as essential to solution of how we get<br>to that fa um healthier future for all<br>and then I'll open it up for um<br>questions and discussion and and debate<br>um and I'm not always the most reliable<br>timee keeper but I will try to be<br>reliable that and if we descend into<br>open discussion and and debate that is<br>be so<br>um there are substantial pressures on<br>our health systems and our social Care<br>Systems<br>and um it's not just a problem for New<br>Zealand it's actually GL problem as well<br>I particularly key there's huge<br>pressures I just thought quick straw<br>call uh sh fans who has or has had a<br>relative who is currently waiting for<br>more than a year for an appointment any<br>he and I have to ask some those uh who<br>have tried who who have had to go to a<br>private<br>system go to private care because from<br>Poli<br>so that just get to show that some are<br>are<br>affected and sadly that demand is rising<br>and uh I think also there's substantial<br>challenges<br>around uh people presenting with complex<br>Health needs so what we have is<br>uh people living longer but increasing<br>numbers of<br>comorbidities there's also complex<br>social care issues in the<br>mix and uh I think it's fair to say<br>we're also undergoing a mental health<br>crisis and this has<br>been particularly problematic since<br>since well and so that just adds to the<br>complexity and I think Jane you were<br>saying um uh one of our one of your<br>questions is are we asking the best<br>questions um and I would say well<br>sometimes really because we do have a<br>tendency to ask our questions within<br>silence um we think in um isolated<br>systems often systems don't tend to talk<br>to each other uh when in actual reality<br>as a as a resident in this country we<br>probably touching on many different<br>points of many different systems um<br>particularly for uh terms of Elderly<br>Care uh I I know from my personal<br>experience and from from friends on<br>family members that uh navigating uh<br>care for the elderly here is a<br>particular challenge it's very<br>Beau so uh my background is it said I'm<br>I'm I'm interested in in infectious and<br>respir diseases I'm an epidemiologist<br>and I'm also a data scientist and I I<br>believe we need to better understand and<br>then support our health social and<br>economic systems to ensure that our<br>populations are are are H are happier<br>and<br>healthier in terms of um the knowledge<br>systems that we have and the data<br>systems we have um we do have a bit of<br>an issue in that we tend to focus on<br>measuring<br>processes so there's a lot of process<br>measuring um whil not actually<br>understanding for some of the time<br>actually what those processes mean in<br>terms of achieving better outcomes for<br>for our patients and our<br>people for instance in health um we<br>don't really have these uh we don't<br>really have like a a closed information<br>system um where we can really promote uh<br>better quality care and they're actually<br>any heard of people part of learning<br>Health<br>Systems there a few those so learning<br>Health Systems essentially it's a closed<br>feedback loop where we can um we can<br>tackle problems um we<br>can have create you create data use that<br>data to create knowledge that knowledge<br>can then feed back into um clinical care<br>for use in<br>braing best the best care practice we<br>have and then actually we can understand<br>those processes we can look at those<br>interventions and we can um we can see<br>how effective they were and that then<br>creates more data which that goes back<br>into that<br>information so that's a a challenge to<br>us but<br>unfortunately um our data is often<br>collected in a way that's not very<br>easily it's not interoperable with other<br>systems so often you have a system you<br>collect the data and you can't move into<br>another place or another system so one<br>Healthcare Group provider could improve<br>data but when that patient proded<br>another part of the system guess one Cas<br>can't can't you don't so you find<br>actually in hospital care for instance<br>um you often ask the same questions over<br>and over and over again because actually<br>there's<br>no dat system that will like that to<br>have for your data to<br>follow um the data is not<br>accessible um it's generally not<br>presented in a time of use of fat matter<br>to clinicians or to patients in public<br>so um patient access information through<br>general practice is getting better but<br>we still can't look at the whole journey<br>of care that's that's impossible<br>to oh and researchers it's very very<br>difficult to do research<br>um data collected Al can have very high<br>volumes there's a lot of information<br>that's collected generally low<br>value and a lot of data is shell um<br>there's a lot of evidence of huge<br>amounts of free text being ped and it's<br>generally used actually against um UK to<br>against<br>litigation so it's not actually for the<br>best interest to the patient patient<br>process to stop<br>mation and it's not utilized to improve<br>our systems cope with complexity volume<br>of making patient care high quality and<br>safer met<br>outcomes so from a data science<br>perspective because that's my lived<br>experience I guess is as a data<br>scientist unfortunately our data Data<br>Systems are also not optimized for<br>Innovation or research purposes<br>our data can provide the information we<br>need to run better systems and into<br>connect them with their Pat sheet silent<br>difficult to access and there's very<br>little<br>start so now we'll move to R do you see<br>some challenges to give to a healthier<br>future<br>and it's nice to be back at the<br>University that I studi that we had when<br>I was studying we hadn't colonized the<br>downtown the level that's happened there<br>um I'm always in these discussions it<br>seems um I thought list need to colum<br>here I am again talk I'm probably the<br>person in the room that knows the least<br>about this topic somehow I end up<br>talking about it so a little bit resing<br>about it but I had had the opportunity<br>of a kind of a shock introduction to the<br>health system that I wasn't expecting<br>shock ejection that I wasn't expecting<br>but that's less important but it has<br>caused me to think a lot about our<br>health systems and what makes up power<br>what makes up healthy Futures and when I<br>sat down to think about this I have a<br>particularly annoying neighbor who plays<br>loud music and when I sat down to think<br>about it the song that he was playing<br>with Boy George saying Do You Really<br>Want To Hurt<br>Me it made me uh think about it in in<br>kind of quite a philosophical way which<br>is really where I I want to start<br>um because we can't have um a healthy<br>Health syers in an unhealthy<br>society and I think that's what we're<br>trying to<br>have uh the Health Service if you think<br>about that from I'll come back to this<br>issue a public private Community OWI is<br>dominated by the treatment of Health<br>that's what it really does it's what<br>it's funded<br>for uh whether it's private or public<br>funding it's really funded for the<br>treatment of ill health so if you like<br>at that level it's entirely directed<br>towards coping with an unhealthy<br>Society I think there are three aspects<br>in this<br>uh that I see uh one is human<br>inequities secondly environmental<br>degradation of various kinds and thirdly<br>unhealthy human activities things that<br>we do which are not good for our health<br>or others<br>health and I guess together those are<br>the social and Commercial determinant of<br>our health and it's true having said all<br>that it's true that people will still<br>get ill and die in a healthy<br>Society uh but the biggest gains are to<br>be<br>made not simply through living longer<br>but through living<br>better and that's something I think that<br>we have lost that we have focused in an<br>unhealthy Society about extending life<br>and about coping with ill<br>health uh rather than the focus being<br>primarily on how do we all do better<br>and that may not be quite as long but it<br>doesn't matter I was really struck<br>streaming the other day you probably<br>know if you do uh that was Women's<br>Health International Women's Health week<br>last week sort of past largely un<br>recognized here particularly because the<br>Women's Health strategy hasn't been<br>implemented despite everybody saying it<br>would be uh but the really interesting<br>resion came out on that and but again<br>people here will know this but yes women<br>live longer but they live longer with<br>more sicknesses than men live and again<br>that's the sort of thing which is<br>largely ignored in thinking about health<br>policy and when I was in war there was<br>huge resistance from the ministry and<br>from officials within defa to having a<br>woman's health strategy because women<br>live longer and yet even within the<br>current Paradigm it made so much SS and<br>I'm as we with you as We Know<br>um Health isn't just physical but it's<br>also mental and social and<br>spiritual and Health Services that don't<br>match that will never be adequate will<br>always be a problem will always be<br>dissatisfaction with that and at the<br>moment I think we see our health systems<br>effectively a repair shop for human<br>machines uh which will never cope with<br>that holistic view of uh of Health that<br>even when we try to be positive what<br>we're doing is really running Innovation<br>centers for Stronger Faster more<br>productive human machines it's slightly<br>different but it's still a very<br>mechanistic way of thinking about things<br>and those of course machines is only<br>real purposes to rec consume and<br>reproduce uh so we're missing out so<br>many elements of what it is that would<br>make people be and and feel<br>healthy even in the very organization<br>that is supposed to be doing that and<br>therefore so I think that tinger with<br>our current Services simply won't create<br>healthy<br>Futures at best will ameliorate some of<br>the negative effects of an unhealthy<br>society and you know we should still try<br>to do<br>that uh which is what list and the<br>others are now trying to do to make the<br>best of what we have we'll come to some<br>solutions later but just on that<br>standback and think about it<br>level I think there are there still two<br>aspects I've got another couple minutes<br>are important here so we've got it wrong<br>fundamentally even the way we think<br>about it wrong so we won't come to good<br>conclusions but then even at the<br>operational<br>level and this was true of the P<br>legislation that remains<br>true we haven't conceptualized<br>even the current ill health system<br>properly it's being considered primarily<br>as if we had a public health<br>system and we don't have public health<br>we have a public aspect to our health<br>system but it's not the biggest bit by<br>far we all know this when we sit back<br>and think about it so how would we<br>expect starting<br>from the least badly or the worst funded<br>part of the system if you like the one<br>with all the Legacy properties and<br>procedures and all of those things with<br>all the legacies why would you start<br>from there and not think about the<br>system<br>holistically after all we paid for the<br>private hospitals by<br>much we paid for the<br>clinics we paid for most of the bits<br>that are in the private part of the the<br>SE I'm not opposed the private thing is<br>with it's right or wrong it's different<br>question but it's there<br>and there was no effort made to think<br>way or to provide solutions that span<br>that so that the we end up in a purely<br>transactional set of relationships where<br>when you talk to people in the health<br>system about integrating with the<br>private sector they mean Contracting out<br>operations to sell<br>across purely a transactional kind of<br>arrangement I'm not opposed to those<br>transactions but it's not a way of<br>thinking of about providing a health<br>system and so what happens is that you<br>uh you end up with this kind of ramle<br>structure trying to deal with the wrong<br>problem in my view and then we put on<br>top of that so Ram checkle structure<br>inadequately<br>conceptualizing the system trying to<br>deal with something which is the wrong<br>thing anyway and then we have imposed on<br>that uh some of the worst management<br>I've ever seen in my<br>career where no rational management for<br>example at totally what's being said<br>about data and how important it is and<br>what the inadequacies and potentials<br>are but trying to impose something like<br>the hero information<br>structure onto a system that couldn't<br>even run<br>payroll couldn't even run simple lists<br>in clinics the idea that you should<br>spend hundreds of Millions on a highly<br>sophisticated system without dealing<br>with the most basic of<br>infrastructures was Madness just<br>wouldn't have happened in any rational<br>structure and yet it was impossible to<br>fight and they still try to backwards<br>fight on it and fill bits in oh we won't<br>do that bit of here because we pay this<br>try to solve holidays try Sol nurses P<br>all these kinds of things so the the<br>management structures were AB absolutely<br>hopeless uh things like equal pay for<br>nurses and equal pay for age care<br>workers who were existing or coming down<br>the<br>track and yet the allocations being made<br>in budgets didn't even remotely take<br>account of that's not actually fult War<br>that's fault Ministry and governments<br>but to were do help on not being an open<br>advocate for those things every everyone<br>knew for example finish everyone knew<br>that when you paid nurses more to work<br>in the public hospitals but didn't fund<br>to pay people who were not in everyone<br>knew what happen you don't have to be a<br>milk<br>freakman to work out somehow the supply<br>demand people are going to shift you<br>know they<br>did um it was everyone knew that was<br>going to happen and yet no one did<br>anything about it all the managers knew<br>nurses knew politicians knew no one did<br>anything about them then it's a surprise<br>then it's a<br>crisis the actual crisis course was<br>underpaying for dead before<br>that but then are committing it in such<br>a blind and stupid way<br>so terrible man on a ranch system trying<br>thing so the the answer the answer to<br>Boy George and I writee it down was Do<br>You Really Want To Hurt Me say well we<br>economists talk about reveal preferences<br>but so I would say the reveal preference<br>would tell you yes we do want to other<br>just not too much too<br>excusable<br>thanks that's really laid it out and<br>actually interesting synergies with what<br>you were saying col in terms of<br>disconnects and overlays so now we move<br>to the next PATH which is<br>um you know couple things you see is<br>this I like<br>what<br>suggested is are questions you should be<br>asking<br>I and I think arate is about<br>um engagements and<br>enablement and<br>one is engaging and stiving our<br>stakeholders um and we need to create a<br>more informed<br>Workforce uh more empowered Workforce to<br>drive the agenda for change because I<br>feel that the workforce the<br>clinicians included are somewhat design<br>art and<br>removed from decision<br>making um and how can we enable our<br>leaders um to help Drive<br>Innovation uh how can it help us adapt<br>and adopt the best technology carry out<br>best Innovation and research and<br>development to support our<br>goals um also the public are somewh how<br>we intensively engage the public and<br>particular those Rel experiences to<br>drive the changes they<br>need uh I'm going to talk about<br>something really boring now which is fa<br>use which is often thought toiz as<br>findable accessible operable reusable<br>Data<br>Systems and we need that in our data to<br>have high<br>utility and allow for data driven<br>information to improve our<br>my right<br>too um okay um I'm a bit what do we do<br>about Ram I'm a bit more<br>discursive that<br>um and interestingly I think we've all<br>first place I think we've already done<br>the biggest thing we need to do but we<br>haven't listened to<br>them so when you think about health the<br>way I do and I think most of us do it<br>doesn't belong to politicians buau or<br>even to healthy professionals and I<br>worry a little bit about this mode<br>that's coming through a little bit of<br>discussion at the moment is we've got to<br>get all this out the hand of health<br>professionals because important as they<br>are the health system doesn't belong to<br>the health professionals not in any<br>broad sense term health so I'm not<br>opposed to clinicians having big roles<br>but the system doesn't belong to them um<br>my quote for this one was from chin and<br>M we said the messes of the real heroes<br>while we ourselves are often childish<br>and ignorant without this understanding<br>it is impossible to acquire even the<br>most rudimentary knowledge the masses<br>had boundless<br>created so my point is that social<br>change which creating Healthy Future is<br>doesn't get at the hospital or the<br>clinic or even at the queue outside the<br>and the terrible thing is that we have<br>been we have done that the exercise of<br>localities which has been much<br>disparaged and now abandoned was never a<br>mechanism for providing uh funding or<br>commissioning or Health<br>Services it was always about finding out<br>what communities actually<br>wanted and it succeeded<br>and they all said exactly the same thing<br>or so nearly that it didn't matter they<br>all said we want to think about it<br>holistically we want Primary Care first<br>we don't want the hospitals to dominate<br>it we want uh particularly for Mari<br>Health Mari uh Services C Mari Services<br>led by Mari are the only solution for<br>the mar Health inequities they all said<br>amazingly there 23 or 24 ality programs<br>went on they all said exactly the same<br>thing just give us this having asked<br>that question the answer from the system<br>was Jesus that doesn't<br>suit and that's interesting because they<br>actually include a lot of the private<br>providers that wasn't a public private<br>divide or Mari Parky divide at all they<br>and there are now blueprints written<br>blueprints all around the country we<br>want to forget that now people say we're<br>not doing enough to devolve C it's all<br>true that we've done the best of us we<br>just didn't like the answer cuz it was a<br>bit messy it wasn't<br>hierarchical it didn't fit the existing<br>patterns of control that we're looking<br>to so um unfortunately having said that<br>you've got to start with where we are<br>and uh we do have to find a way to get<br>better involvement this change won't<br>happen from the top<br>we got to build on the work that has<br>been done uh and I think it will<br>actually happen from the Bott so if I<br>had to pick one thing that was I think<br>the<br>instruction this one might surprise you<br>the one thing that I would do is to<br>reinstate<br>toor because the might Health<br>Society actually got closer to creating<br>that conception of what would work for a<br>healthy Society than anything Min ever<br>done anything to F ever done and<br>certainly anything that new Ze for<br>anyone El like that is going to do uh T<br>was actually creating the building BLX<br>for a Health Service that might work so<br>St thank you right um amazing<br>Reflections and<br>solutions um open it up to the floor any<br>comments<br>questions maybe just considering the<br>disc<br>theme I come from sort of tax side<br>things and the government is we're<br>looking at a bit of a structural deficit<br>um emerging with you know um you know<br>revenues you know sort of not not um not<br>keeping up with the expenditure<br>especially on the expenditure i' be<br>looking at with the Aging population you<br>know growing New Zeal super and<br>especially the health fol M these are<br>expensive um so just so I think we are<br>facing some some real challenges there<br>um you know looking out so look at both<br>experience on both both sides of so just<br>that out look I think that's true we're<br>not being spended on health amongst I<br>mean I personally don't know that we are<br>all that first world it's necessarily<br>the right aspiration but but amongst the<br>the big boys that we like to think we<br>play with uh we're not really SPS on<br>health so there is from a health point<br>of view more to be done it's should not<br>to say there are no physical issues but<br>ex that there are um but the<br>other the other point I would make is<br>most of these changes don't actually<br>need to<br>be all that expensive they're really<br>about how we organize and<br>incentivize and and as usual even the<br>things that are being delivered the<br>health aspects of Health that are being<br>delivered by a<br>market uh good markets are not uh simply<br>natural things you know Comm no good<br>markets and<br>design they include incentives to do the<br>things that you want to see as<br>outcomes and I think we're probably a<br>little bit reluctant to think of Health<br>as a market which doesn't stop all the<br>greedy buckets that want to make money<br>out from making it um but one of the<br>things that going back to what I said<br>about thinking about our system<br>holistically public and private together<br>is that you can think about how is this<br>Market<br>what is what is the market uh what<br>incentives are we really creating for<br>people and it just to give you one<br>example there's something odd about a<br>market where General practices are going<br>througho and people who want to make<br>private Equity liing returns of mid te<br>return on Equity are buying<br>them that should be telling you<br>something about what the incentives<br>we've got locked into our health<br>market and it's not that it's so there's<br>there's just a kind of really really<br>obvious uh thing and I think if you when<br>you delve around this market and think<br>about the public and private things all<br>together you can you can quickly find uh<br>Market design issues that could work<br>much more efficiently that are not<br>simply about throwing more money into<br>the existing structure certainly one<br>point we're L to leave and I totally<br>agree<br>I wouldn't try to save the money I'd try<br>and spend it better but but you know<br>instructions appear be Saed so was what<br>it is for him but uh it's not simply<br>about throwing more money at that old R<br>machine has been bad around trying to do<br>the wrong thing so I certainly<br>that I was going to ask you a question<br>which is are we at a stage where we need<br>to move away from social health system<br>to a system more like Germany and France<br>which is Insurance<br>based well for half of us we<br>have kind moving uh yeah it's around<br>about half I think that<br>uh I don't know I don't know about<br>that's my answer uh it's possible we<br>have come so far even without ever<br>really deciding to in having a<br>privatized health system that going back<br>to a predominantly public one is just<br>too<br>hard uh my mind hasn't quite got there<br>yet but it's an open question that we<br>probably it's a good question to ask<br>because they'll start tell us answers<br>about the kind of things we should be<br>doing I mean I think Co response is<br>interesting because actually Germany had<br>actually quite a low covid death rate<br>and largely because it has it has<br>oversupply Hospital PLS and and fly now<br>they having they beginning to have<br>trouble with clinical<br>capacity so it is interesting just to<br>look at the models of care to<br>see and and you know the pain thing is<br>largely a market design asue in my view<br>too and elsewhere you know we may like<br>to think we don't live in the market we<br>might like to think our heal system is<br>be the minister and all isra res makes a<br>decision and allocate some money and<br>that's what's available but everybody<br>else is living in the market for their<br>skills and for their housing and<br>everything else so um yeah it's better<br>brains than mine but I think the bigger<br>brains should be working on uh how do we<br>conceptualize and R A A system that is<br>substantially<br>prioritized we priortize that ones for<br>go put all these s entrepreneurial wives<br>running around trying to make a Liv R<br>the F wife services and and and you know<br>how how does that fit with the work t or<br>theps wepbs we doing uh I forget the<br>names kahut the uh M py Cress that we're<br>running uh you know which really not<br>only doesn't fit with planket but<br>doesn't fit with the Midwife structure<br>and with this strongly privatized<br>elements Tobe so<br>uh again there's another little<br>everywhere you look you find these<br>examples where it's jumbled and messy<br>and there is a market but we're not<br>thinking about it that way I'm not<br>trying to make it work better so look<br>you could be right I I I kind of hope<br>not it's interesting though someone said<br>to me the other day can you imagine uh<br>someone trying to introduce the ACC<br>scheme in New Zeal now in this climate<br>that's pretty good<br>a couple of comments are that you've got<br>to you say predominantly privatized the<br>system but it's still predominantly<br>public funded and so when you're talking<br>privatized it's privatized on the<br>supplier side and that's a distinction<br>so that's just Comm so when you talk<br>about privati don't still publicly<br>funded and that's a distinction that's<br>important going go back to you more<br>critical point Rob is that we living in<br>an unhealthy society and that's the<br>chenge that we need to<br>attack that's not help by all of our<br>funds being<br>siloed so whether it's all the way up<br>the system so you've got a minister of<br>Health who was looking after that Health<br>side so the incentives are not there to<br>look at the health of our society within<br>which that Health Works and so when<br>you're talking about systems I'm just<br>wondering the big system is that silon<br>that F Health which is a very narrow<br>definition of Health<br>and then you look at other perspectives<br>on heal that Community<br>heal version of the world how does that<br>version of the world fit with a<br>centralized publicly funded system that<br>allocates according to<br>Sops so you know social health now<br>that's not my PO this is<br>Health Yeah allocates by silos and<br>measures by outputs rather than outcomes<br>ex which again that was the huge<br>Challenge and huge shock that t were<br>opposed to the system and why a lot of<br>people had to see it Go was that it was<br>focusing on outcomes and and not<br>spending huge amounts of time reporting<br>on Tiny outputs which may or may not<br>have been leading to the outcomes so<br>yeah look I very much agree with what<br>you're saying quite a few of our private<br>markets by the way government<br>fund call Private Market yeah I hear you<br>I wrong<br>yeah and um so my background is is s<br>architect so nothing this my wife is a<br>nurse in public health andin has<br>been that so just notled to be dangerous<br>elely but um I guess in terms of com<br>back to that big picture was a series<br>blue<br>zones familiar with about countries that<br>have where people are living<br>particularly longer uh than you know the<br>the median age for uh people around them<br>other countries around them<br>Mediterranean various places of that and<br>they were also healthier in those ages<br>and and I think I remember one<br>particular area where there was a a<br>country that had focused they didn't<br>have anywhere near the same level of um<br>funding that the states Etc had but they<br>were achieving Better Health outcomes I<br>think doing that Regal understanding<br>focusing on Primary Health and things<br>that is that is that the sort of thing<br>that you're talking about moving to<br>different<br>Lifestyles having a different way of<br>addressing our holistic<br>health that's more immediate more<br>available and closer to us is that<br>absolutely I think that's a large part<br>of it's not all of it but it's it's a<br>significant part of it um you know you<br>probably wouldn't do any harm to start<br>with food uh as as a place just on the<br>Blue Zone subsequent research I quite L<br>made a great<br>inflix um subsequent research hasn't<br>been very kind to it uh as people have<br>gone around and look more deeply at<br>those places with the longevity they<br>largely found out that a bigger a bigger<br>contribution to the apparent numbers was<br>large numbers of the people who were<br>word so there is some subse re which is<br>a bit damaging but it's still a good<br>story I still agree with you I also<br>think it's a there need there's a need<br>to avoid uh inequity as well so the US<br>spend a lot of money on health but H<br>they don't<br>have the life is best seasons is high as<br>the countri yeah I mean if you want the<br>best health care that's in the world<br>that's place to go Mark goodness don't<br>expensive um look um access to care none<br>of the markets that are operating in our<br>health system currently are interested<br>in providing equ of access to care as<br>I'm sure you well know so poor people<br>rural people people who are least<br>ambulatory people that don't enjoy good<br>transport options are out in the bul of<br>primary Community Based care eyes ears<br>teeth GPS feet<br>physio um basic obric Services all of<br>that sort of stuff that is all<br>privatized effectively it may be it may<br>be<br>subsidizing um through different forms<br>of of public grants and what have you so<br>you know that is broken and it seems to<br>be no political appetite or any um<br>ability fo water to address the bulk of<br>of the named P system which are not<br>hospitals right it's it's all that stuff<br>that's going on in the community so<br>Solutions are going to and it's probably<br>follow the money situation you know<br>there are lots of Ved interests um<br>emerging and established about how much<br>money they can make but it's why you<br>might find Health Care in Norland on the<br>West Coast or where the high R of<br>romatic heart disease or or down<br>Southland why you can't get G care in<br>New Zealand on might cancer you because<br>you to be a woman um and yesterday my je<br>from Mr Le wrote to staff explaining<br>that they're going to defund Public<br>Health because they don't consider it to<br>be front line so we are really stuff at<br>the<br>moment there are no Solutions being<br>posed under the current restraints that<br>are going to speed up um the breakdown<br>of what what remains of our health<br>system currently so but it blw me but<br>just wonder if there is an appetite out<br>there whether you pick an ACC model or a<br>social insurance model or you go to the<br>whole hog and just stop pretending and<br>explain that everything's privatized um<br>that it hasn't been an appetite to<br>really have a b conversation about those<br>things so I just wondered if you had any<br>thoughts about how we uh facilitate a<br>international conversation about what is<br>actually there for people what people<br>would speak what think they going to get<br>as opposed to what's currently there<br>I didn't notice you there sorry okay<br>asms in has the new research Department<br>in the health sector than what Ministry<br>is has really really good<br>value uh yeah uh productivity is pretty<br>high compared to those other<br>organizations too uh it's it's just too<br>distressing for Words the message is to<br>have about public health because because<br>um I mean the public<br>health uh profession if you like the<br>knowledge of Public Health in New<br>Zealand is is genuinely world class and<br>I of want to say that<br>but public health research and public<br>health Physicians are a really world<br>class and they're suppressed actively<br>suppressed by by the ministry of<br>politicians and they were by dhps some<br>more than others and certainly<br>suppressed by<br>to find War which is just tragic because<br>it's the key to and if you put that if<br>you put alongside mind a reborn idea<br>you'd also bu up the next step would be<br>frankly Bing and I almost said<br>that every where I go they're doing<br>exactly the opposite which is is<br>tragic I'm not ready to conceive uh<br>Sarah that U we can't have uh a really<br>efficient and effective public system<br>because I do I don't think however you<br>know for all I can talk about<br>constructing the markets and getting the<br>incentive right and those sorts of<br>things um I do think that the the poor<br>and the distant get lost in that uh in<br>that situation and um I don't think that<br>that's acceptable but um I think it has<br>to be part mix is the most I would say I<br>I fear us moving deeply fear us moving<br>to a tury Insurance system I also wonder<br>about having an outcomes Focus as well<br>actually outcomes should be good across<br>the boards it doesn't really matter<br>which post schol you live in and<br>um I'm not sure how you get there but uh<br>yeah whether you have to move away from<br>Cod systems or ad<br>others was big<br>discussion you know I was I was at a<br>couple of weeks ago at a conference<br>Orland organized by the New Zealand<br>mission on uh localis and health it was<br>called but it was largely about a bit of<br>from and uh the room was full of you<br>know a few CS but by and large insurance<br>people private Equity people and<br>others who are gathering and we will see<br>proposals about how much more private<br>system could work then I think<br>is my guess to be part of the debate so<br>those of us who are more concerned to<br>drive from the other end going to be<br>ready for it as I say I feel quite in<br>adoc and I Think I Can See Clearly a lot<br>of these issues but I can't see<br>Solutions uh uh but we are I think I<br>think within a very short period of time<br>we're going to we're going to see<br>proposals that are for a much more<br>extensive privatization of our health<br>system biger than we have at the<br>moment so we've got a stack of questions<br>then um Coen I'm the intern dean of the<br>faculty of Health um but probably more<br>than that I am a clinician I'm intens<br>care nurse and um for most of my<br>clinical career when I am walking<br>alongside with families and relatives<br>periods of found stress um they're not<br>thinking about the economic they're not<br>thinking about that they they just want<br>to experience a good transition to death<br>to health whatever that may be and one<br>of the fundamental things when I listen<br>to my colleagues I call them I listen to<br>uh people like bed La incling the point<br>of care testing and screening um in<br>theal communties and SC reading and I<br>listen to the frustrations uh about the<br>system listen to my colleagues working<br>in public health and the profound<br>anxiety and stress that they experience<br>because what they want to do is to walk<br>alongside people of tons of<br>vulnerability and help them to you know<br>feel well to be connected to each other<br>to not be lonely and<br>isolated and everything within our<br>society whether it's in healthcare<br>government or whatever is is trying to<br>think its way out of the problem that<br>actually is not about the head it is<br>about the heart and the connection that<br>we have to each other and so I think<br>that we I am very I hopeful and hope is<br>not a pitiful kind of notion hope is an<br>action orientated kind of thing so I<br>think that there is a a future state<br>that we can get to that will allow<br>people to be seen as human beings<br>individuals who come from communities<br>and families who love them and that we<br>can create a future um that allows that<br>to be the<br>which I think is fundamentally<br>what um rather than these economic<br>managerial corporate kind of uh<br>functions so um I don't know what I'm<br>saying here but I do think that there is<br>there is hope um um but it's it's our<br>hearts and our that needs to be engaged<br>in this rather than trying to think our<br>way<br>out so I'm all about talking to anybody<br>who wants to get a little bit deep<br>meaningful about this just shake the<br>whole system up essentially because it<br>is fundamentally not meaning our human<br>need<br>um there is an unbelievably large gap<br>between the<br>people who are delivering health<br>services and the people who are<br>administering the found<br>for SAR it's it's incredible far bigger<br>than I've ever seen in any other<br>industry or organization in my life<br>so<br>totally yeah gs1 you I've been involved<br>around the health system along and after<br>to have seen uh the pride that we had in<br>dollars in and and life expectancy uh<br>really Ultra efficient and then<br>officials and the system apologize for<br>this is slipping and aroundd it's been<br>it's been largely because of wage sells<br>so that's just weird actually paying uh<br>the clinicians the nurses in particular<br>and enough actually dragged us down on<br>ICD metrics so you know I think that<br>sort of false level of Pride that<br>actually we're doing a good job um I<br>think moving to my specialist area which<br>is the standards U you know and the<br>input output conversation we've been<br>having it is important to to look at<br>outputs but actually inputs you know<br>fundamentally I've been involved 20<br>years in trying to work out what we buy<br>from whom and at what price um because<br>actually can we get a better deal at<br>health system and actually that needs to<br>and biggest barrier to that was the dhb<br>system where each dhb refused to work<br>together and collaborates let alone<br>between the the dhbs and the Privacy<br>part and ironically Southern Cross<br>wanted to tailgate on everything the<br>public sector was<br>doing that would have helped them and<br>made them more efficient and more<br>profitable for example but um I I think<br>um what you Le Ro was actually starting<br>to to address some of that stuff at a<br>national level actually how can we look<br>at those inputs and can we be more<br>efficient in delivering and track things<br>which we to data stand but ironically<br>some of the recent moves are risking<br>that stuff and I think part of it is<br>because of<br>broism I think we genuinely believe that<br>we are different and even that<br>Healthcare is different whereas you know<br> French is arguing about a r Health<br>hey look we need to look at pandemics<br>are actually there's Animal Health and<br>the Nexus of Public Health and<br>environmental stuff that these things<br>are all coming together in this one<br>Health period so I think the the silos<br>you're talking about are much more than<br>just health or public health and how do<br>down do<br>that Public healthare<br>Funding but actually there's there's<br>linkages that we know about with other<br>parts of the sector which has funded NP<br>do in Scotland they've created<br>essentially what ministers Health at<br>Social care<br>again but the main challenge has been<br>the culture of the social care system<br>versus the health system very different<br>and actually norming that culture is is<br>incredibly hard and so they and they've<br>running into this huge buffer of massive<br>volume and complexity at the same time<br>and less<br>funing so the only challenge is when you<br>knock down those silos you need to have<br>I think have to have a lot of Goodwill<br>hard work and money to en to<br>have so there's like any any change of<br>productivity but as P said we don't have<br>a lot of cash don't so you<br>know you know that's the challenge is<br>like whenever you hear that the politi<br>will say hey you're asking for cash that<br>we don't have constraint actually we<br>with we've got ly and then we've got a<br>hand over<br>there as a long-term Observer of the<br>public sector one thing that worries me<br>is every time a manager says that<br>they're are transformational manager It<br>generally tells you how little they know<br>about the place and of course heal we've<br>had Michael Basset in the 80s we had the<br>early 90s reforms we had um and um<br>what's name came in in 2000 and struct<br>it up again we had Murray horn in 2008<br>and none of those people you could say<br>were able to spend the following year<br>explaining exactly what they were doing<br>and and I just wonder whether we've<br>There's Something Rich deeper that<br>affects Health more than anywhere else<br>and this fascination with<br>transformational managers as I say which<br>is inversely proportional to their<br>ignorance the second final point is one<br>of the things that worries me is it<br>you're not really are we better to have<br>a partly inefficient bureaucracy of the<br>sort that we're familiar with in the<br>public sector or do we privatize and<br>then have the inability to manage<br>contracts I just drive around I look at<br>Downers for example and every time I see<br>them doing Road works I than God BL the<br>ministry of works because we didn't need<br>so many people and it seems to me that<br>the more you contract out from a public<br>sector operation the less you have the<br>ability to manage the contracts I mean I<br>sat down in one job with President noted<br>Martin telling me we want to get an<br>extra 10 million off you we 70 million<br>we' just spent on a British census and<br>how do you argue and the public sector<br>is getting more and more caught up in<br>massive inability to actually oversee<br>what it's doing and if it can't oversee<br>what it had done before it's surely<br>going to have less Effectiveness um in<br>operations that have<br>privatized and just on one third final<br>Point remember the woodh house review<br>was actually going to move from accident<br>to sickness in<br>1971 and despite Jeffrey Palm's efforts<br>in the following decade that never<br>happened is that something we should<br>revisit despite your comments Rob on acc<br>I think it should certainly be in the in<br>the mix of how we respond to this real<br>situation we have private yeah I I<br>absolutely think it's in the Mi I don't<br>I don't have enough confidence to know<br>how it should be in the Mi but should be<br>we can't just ignore it as a as a<br>possibility uh and if we discuss it from<br>the point of view that we have been this<br>morning it's got to be a hell of a lot<br>bit of the simply this thing of you know<br>what what's going to be cheaper uh and<br>you apped that Contracting out is right<br>um in my private sector experience uh<br>one of the things I learned very much<br>about Contracting out or Contracting<br>anything is that if in any Contracting<br>relationship if you're not the person<br>that knows the most about it you're<br>going to get done and and that happens<br>right through the public sector afraid<br>and weaken schools there and have<br>develop schools so I think that's a real<br>problem on this B thing<br>um Health sector public but the health<br>sector is almost as bad as universities<br>prop not being critical I'm sure it's<br>universities so nearly selling my<br>chairs but the speing issue is is is<br>fascinating in h possibly is in other<br>areas because it is a machine that is<br>running in a largely running a lot of it<br>is running on property the dhp is like<br>having new buildings because because<br>they got depreciation which they could<br>spend on operational things because they<br>didn't believe depreciation was<br>real true to R got the new bu to do that<br>and I remember just quick anecdote<br>standing at on the site of the hospital<br>in front a where an announcement was<br>being made about a new big building was<br>around about a billion dollars uh<br>buildings billion dollars was with<br>Andrew little and uh um we're looking at<br>this ground and there was nothing<br>particularly to announce except they<br>hadn't had an announcement for a couple<br>of weeks so then say something and I<br>said to him you know if you were given<br>Northland in health and someone said<br>we've only got a billion<br>dollars but here's a billion dollars<br>would you spend it on this building he<br>said don't be crazy no one would do<br>that is what we were<br>doing so everyone knows it's what<br>happens in Crazy systems as everyone<br>stop<br>G<br>Association Specialists thank you for<br>your about our team um we've been<br>hearing a lot about cost and payment New<br>Zealand can't afford good<br>health system that we've got um but I<br>keep thinking that we are bearing that<br>cost anyway we're bearing the cost<br>of employers bear the cost of Health<br>their employees we bear<br>and<br>time we<br>P by the government pay for elsewhere um<br>a good health benefits everybody we know<br>about these concepts of health and all<br>policies um but we don't see very good<br>working across ours in terms of both<br>policy but also funding and we direct it<br>to get B A productivity for the country<br>um and I guess my question is how do we<br>depoliticize health and start agreeing<br>um across the political Spectrum that<br>there are some basic things we could be<br>doing that would be how do we start<br>having that<br>conversation or turn that conversation<br>around Jo was right you you see I can I<br>would say almost the opposite thing I<br>repoliticizing part of that is is is is<br>making it itical debate again and not<br>simply a it's it's retreating again to<br>become a purely technical Financial<br>debate they called an economic debate<br>it's<br>econom it's an accounting debate a<br>financial debate that kind of thing uh<br>and it's not just a technical issue so<br>we I think those of us who want to have<br>a genuinely healthy Society do have to<br>uh confront that uh and maybe that's the<br>key to uh taking the party uh politics<br>out out of something I'm not that<br>hopeful about taking Party politics out<br>of it but I'd like to think that we can<br>but I've got to say you know<br>um you the<br>previous previous government wasn't<br>actually much better at this than the<br>current government is you can find<br>little glimmers if you want to vote for<br>them but uh this is an ongoing long-term<br>problem see you could almost say it is<br>De politicized the differences between<br>them aren't as big as they probably<br>should<br>be and and it's not just New<br>Zealand GL globally same so every<br>country's have to deal with<br>this yeah I mean the previous government<br>passed the pror legislation then didn't<br>have I could have work out when they<br>didn't have the courage of their<br>convictions so they didn't even have the<br>convictions uh but one of the other they<br>certainly didn't have have the<br>willingness to carry it<br>on funly enough the P legislation all<br>still place just everyone's<br>ignoring well the plan even in place to<br>P is still place um nobody's ignoring it<br>no everybody's ignoring it taking<br>absolutely no notice of it the famous<br>Charter with s has took place the<br>government's the Crown's bound to it<br>nobody's talking about theyve just<br>disappeared all these things but so I<br>think it's great you know people who are<br>interested in health start to say these<br>are the things we want go back to the<br>localities the locality consultations<br>were all great they all called for<br>exactly the sort of things that they're<br>largely talking about here uh<br>so that's the Gap that we've got to push<br>back on it's not about the<br>technicalities apology Susan just<br>checked my time and I realized we're<br>very getting very close to 9:00 and I<br>know promise to let people get to work<br>uh and I know that we could actually<br>probably keep discussing all morning<br>about<br>this<br>are is on<br>it and it seems to you've got us a<br>really big side here between the heart<br>and what the it Specialists do they all<br>come in and Reas doing all sorts of<br>stuff and spending lots of money but<br>they never seem to get to the real<br>number of the issue in the end and then<br>you get a new system and they start all<br>over and spend the money again on a new<br>it system and they're very expensive um<br>but they're not really<br>getting could be but maybe you have a<br>solu for<br>that I think I<br>think the main problems is are that the<br>large enterpr systems are us B and so we<br>wanted to purchase that you'd have to go<br>system I mean I think<br>it's partly going back to that EMP<br>powering Frontline staff and actually<br>asking what they want and connecting for<br>health was a good example of what<br>doesn't work in the UK that several<br>billion P worth the best and the plug<br>was cool just didn't work so what they<br>went to<br>granular localized system but applying<br>trying to apply these uh aspects of fair<br>in particular inter abilities of system<br>speak to each other um so I think you<br>have to go back and find systems that<br>work for the clinicians and make sure<br>that the messaging and information flows<br>with the patient one other aspect is<br>actually having patients own their data<br>and they carry the data with it and they<br>make the decisions and they let whoever<br>they want they make decisions around who<br>accesses that data where it goes to I<br>mean that's not all simple thing but<br>it's yeah absolutely you know I should<br>own my<br>data yeah absolutely so I mean it's<br>taking that model PL to health and then<br>actually it's it's individual patient or<br>family you're actually you're actually<br>guided about to system and having<br>and actually empowering patients is<br>really important they will get much<br>decisions great well on that note um I<br>just want to thank Rob and Colin very<br>much for a really stimulating discussion<br>this morning been<br>um and uh yeah I think it would be good<br>um building on Sarah's comment before it<br>would be good to start a national<br>conversation about some of these uh<br>university can start contributing to<br>that<br>through Publications Etc<br>in the public press as opposed to the<br>Academic Press<br>uh and I know rob you you write fairly<br>frequently the public media as<br>well so I'd like us to show our<br>appreciation to</p></main><footer style="margin-top: 2rem; background: #0001; padding: 2rem;
