Professor Cate Macinnis-Ng spent her career studying stress in a range of photosynthetic organisms, including seaweed, seagrass, phytoplankton, and, more recently, forests. Her current research focuses on plant-climate interactions, especially impacts of extreme events like drought. In a world of “optimisation”, she will share why plants are essential for addressing climate change and highlight the limits of nature-based solutions. While many plants show incredible resilience, as the climate continues to change, identifying vulnerable species and ecosystems will be key.</p><h2>Transcript</h2><p style="opacity: 0.9; font-size:

Research In tearo The<br>Faculty of science here at White Papo<br>the University of Oakland um I'd like to<br>welcome you all today I'd like to thank<br>Tara for um beginning us this evening<br>with a lovely Mii and um yes welcome<br>everybody um to the inaugural lecture of<br>Kate mcginness ing professor in ecology<br>at WAP Mato the University of Oakland an<br>awesome advocate for women in<br>science Kate grew up up in Sydney in<br>Australia she has a Bachelor of Science<br>and environmental biology and has<br>studied the impacts of pollutants on<br>seagrass health for her<br>PhD for her first postop Kate moved on<br>to terrestrial plants and developed an<br>interest in plant water relations which<br>remains a central part of her research<br>program like many of us working mothers<br>Kate spent many years on fixed term<br>contracts uh it's a familiar story<br>whilst caring for her children in 2010<br>she moved to Tamaki Makoto with her<br>family and joined the University of<br>Oakland she has received several<br>prestigious grants in her career<br>including a mden fast start Grant and a<br>rather for Discovery Fellowship in<br>2015 she secured an ongoing full-time<br>position in the school of biological<br>sciences here at the<br>University Kate has received a range of<br>awards during her career including a<br>university of ockland early career<br>research Excellence award the Roger<br>slack award for plant science research<br>and the Miriam Dell award for mentoring<br>this is for an outstanding mentoring<br>effects sorry outstanding mentoring<br>efforts to retain females in science<br>mathematics or technology Kate has<br>served as president of the New Zealand<br>ecological society as council member for<br>the Royal Society to aangi and is<br>academic group leader for the ecology<br>and evolutionary biology group in the<br>school of biological sciences she is<br>currently the senior editor for the<br>Journal of Applied ecology we're not<br>studying plants and the impacts of<br>climate change on biodiversity in Alo<br>Kate enjoys spending time with her<br>husband and teenage children who I<br>believe are all here<br>tonight um and preferably in the<br>outdoors or in the<br>water now getting to the level of of<br>Professor is no mean<br>feat achieving the level of Professor<br>requires someone to be excellent in<br>research and teaching and service so it<br>is Testament to the efforts and the hard<br>work that Kate has put in that she has<br>achieved this this level in her career<br>Kate will be talking to us tonight about<br>her research on plants but also about<br>her journey in particular the resilience<br>and perseverance needed to sustain a<br>career in science as a woman and as a<br>mother so I'll hand over to you now Kate<br>let's welcome<br>Kate Koto good evening everyone<br>namoto thanks so much to each and every<br>one of you for being here this evening I<br>really appreciate you all being here but<br>special thanks to Tara uh for joining us<br>from Wellington and thank you for the<br>love introduction and also I want to<br>point out my parents Chris and Peter<br>who've joined us from Sydney uh tonight<br>so thanks for coming mom and dad so as<br>already been alluded to I'm going to uh<br>tell you a bit about my career progress<br>and uh a little bit about some plants so<br>join me for a bit of a wander in the<br>forest and I promis some trees along the<br>way and some other bits and<br>pieces so I was very fortunate to grow<br>up surrounded by the Landscapes<br>seascapes and vegetation of what now<br>known as Sydney I'm grateful to the<br>gamle clan of the aura Nation as the<br>traditional custodians of the land that<br>is in the area that's now known as<br>manly I pay my respects to the elders<br>past present and emerging for what<br>always was and always will be Aboriginal<br>land I was always inspired by the<br>Landscapes around me and at the age of<br>six I produced this masterpiece of mixed<br>media which actually then won me second<br>place in The Greening of Bal Gala<br>competition I recall winning a packet of<br>textas and they were such a prized<br>position that I didn't want to open them<br>and then when I finally did get round to<br>opening them maybe even a year later<br>they' all dried up so I I couldn't<br>actually use them but the green idea uh<br>has stuck with me for a lifetime I think<br>and these are my two brothers Angus is<br>my older brother and Duncan is my<br>younger<br>brother I went to North Sydney Girls<br>High School which is a selective School<br>um we don't have those here and I think<br>that might be a good thing uh I recall<br>that the year that I went they'd opened<br>up the boundaries so something like<br>2,000 girls applied for 120 positions so<br>it was a bit of a pressure cooker<br>environment to grow up in but one<br>benefit of that I think is that I don't<br>get imposter syndrome very often<br>although maybe tonight is an<br>exception uh I achieved lots of bits and<br>pieces did particularly well in science<br>probably to the Delight of my parents<br>who both science teachers so science was<br>a a real Focus for me but I did have<br>some other things going on I was doing<br>things like brownies and I also did<br>ballet and uh water poloo into my<br>teenage years until my ballet teacher<br>told me that my arms were getting too<br>bulky from water poloo and I should give<br>up water poloo so in fact the very next<br>week I gave up ballet and stuck with the<br>water polo and it's the swimming that I<br>still do and not the ballet because the<br>ballet stuffed my hips but anyway that's<br>a a life lesson I learned a bit too<br>late so looking back on my reports um<br>from school we in those days it was a<br>little folder with slips that all the<br>teachers would write write in this is<br>from my second last year of school for<br>my biology grade and you can see uh the<br>bottom here the cumulative assessment<br>this is our rank so we went from third<br>to Second uh with a score of 99 you<br>can't imagine how frustrating it was to<br>get 99 and only be placed second but by<br>the end of the year and at the end of my<br>schooling I'd reached first place in<br>biology U very much thanks to Mom for<br>helping me I remember Mom writing<br>practiceing exam questions and mom<br>giving me feedback and me going back and<br>trying again so I really appreciate the<br>support that I've had from my parents<br>throughout my career so this ended up<br>with me achieving uh the certificate a<br>Kimberly prize in biology it was called<br>and I also came fifth in the State uh in<br>biology and I think there was about<br>16,000 kids doing biology that year in<br>New South Wales so biology was obviously<br>my calling and so it it's probably not a<br>surprise that I went on to study uh<br>Bachelor of sence science in biology but<br>before I go into that uh yes it was<br>really interesting looking through my<br>reports and the this phrase very<br>pleasing came up very often and so it<br>would be very pleasing results very<br>pleasing things very very pleasing<br>outcomes I was constantly very pleasing<br>it was kind of alarming going through<br>all the years of how pleasing I was but<br>as you might those of who know me well<br>will know that I'm not really into being<br>pleasing anymore so let's get rid of<br>that and in fact yeah I think it's it's<br>kind of stunning that very pleasing<br>might be something that we should want<br>young women to<br>be so uh studying my Bachelor of Science<br>in environmental biology at the<br>University of Technology Sydney uh<br>obviously learned all about Australian<br>Landscapes and vegetation and we had<br>kind of a Capstone course which was the<br>third year field trip and that would<br>rotate going to different locations but<br>for my year it was the Great Western so<br>it was the um semi arcology field trip<br>we spent three weeks in Western New<br>South Wales traveling all the way out to<br>Cameron Corner which is where um New<br>South Wales Queensland and South<br>Australia come together it's very arid<br>very dry um and yeah not not wet at all<br>uh but this is the group of us in the<br>bus and one of the funny stories is that<br>um they had to use a different bus<br>company after we'd been all sitting in<br>it for 3 weeks it wasn't uh a very<br>pleasant place to be after all amount of<br>time it's a good thing it was wintertime<br>and not too hot because otherwise yeah<br>it would have been even worse<br>but from my recollection this is the<br>only time we had uh indigenous tuition<br>during my time at University and this is<br>something that I I hope um is<br>changing I was delighted though when um<br>our family archist Brianna found this<br>photograph of me graduating uh with my<br>two grandmothers so that was a cool<br>photo to<br>find so when I finished uh my<br>undergraduate I decided to do an honors<br>and I really wanted to work on frogs CU<br>they're green um and there was nobody<br>with that expertise at the University I<br>was at so uh I found that seaweeds had a<br>similar color palette and also a similar<br>slimy feel so I ended up working on<br>Neptune's necklace which is also found<br>here in ALA so homasy banki has really<br>variable forms and I did a big field<br>trip around the coast of New South Wales<br>and Victoria uh and then later into<br>South Australia and one of my<br>supervisors went down to Tasmania to do<br>some measurements there we really should<br>have included some data from New Zealand<br>as well but in any case if you're<br>interested in that you can take a look<br>at the<br>paper then moving on to my PhD I moved<br>onto SE grasses and I looked at the<br>effects of different pollutants on their<br>health so I predominantly worked at this<br>beach here which is called Paradise<br>Beach in pitw it's a very nice place to<br>do field work uh and the seagrasses<br>there were doing very well but I was<br>doing some experiments to see what the<br>effects of different pollutants would be<br>so uh this is the graduation photograph<br>and this is my supervisor uh Peter Ralph<br>from the University of Technology Sydney<br>so the setup was that I put these<br>Chambers out in the seagrass Meadows and<br>I had various kind of clamps and things<br>to put on them uh and so the leaf leaves<br>were kind of held in place and then I<br>could use an instrument to measure their<br>photosynthesis from outside the chambers<br>and then I also did similar experiments<br>uh in the um in the lab to confirm what<br>we were finding in the field now I've<br>dug up this file uh sorry this animation<br>from my uh PhD presentation in 2022 and<br>this is the height of<br>animations uh the height of<br>sophistication of animations 22 years<br>ago so it was in 2002 so these are the<br>um different chambers and I had high<br>treatment low treatment and also some<br>controls which were in the chambers and<br>also some external controls and here<br>comes me uh to take the<br>measurements so I managed to produce<br>five papers and a book chapter out of my<br>uh PhD work and it's amounted to 750<br>citations which I'm I'm pretty proud of<br>but at that time there wasn't much money<br>in seagrasses so I wasn't able to find a<br>position to continue on in that space<br>but fortunately uh Derek emis was<br>professor at the University I was at and<br>he came along to my final PhD uh talk<br>and was impressed by the animation and<br>in fact the Talk itself and so offered<br>me uh a job to work with him on land<br>plants and so this offered a further<br>opportunity for dodgy animations I did<br>actually take the animation out because<br>it was really labored but I just thought<br>this was great how somehow We've Ended<br>up with some carrots these are meant to<br>be trees so thank goodness for<br>professionals to do these things for us<br>now but this work was looking at all<br>about uh plant water relations so<br>understanding how plants uh manage water<br>availability under different seasons I<br>guess is how how I could uh best explain<br>it briefly there's a whole lot more to<br>it but I'm not sure many in this<br>audience would be super enthus about it<br>but working with Derek was fantastic<br>he's a really good writer and I learned<br>Lots from him about research and the<br>writing process and I've been in touch<br>with him in the last week and he told me<br>to let everyone know he's got a new book<br>coming out and I'm sure it would be<br>great because he is a really good writer<br>so it will be available on Amazon and uh<br>he hasn't yet promised me any um any<br>royalties for this but do get into it if<br>you're interested in this kind of<br>thing so after that period I went on to<br>work with Derek for a total of seven<br>years years and we did lots of work<br>looking at Forest hydrology in the<br>Sydney region predominantly but also<br>systems all around Australia we were<br>using uh measurement and modeling<br>approaches and it was a big group of<br>postdocs and PhD students it was a<br>really uh intellectually stimulating<br>time for me because I learned lots of<br>different techniques which were both<br>kind of field-based doing field work and<br>also working with modeling approaches<br>and the team was fantastic I worked with<br>all sorts of great people and you can<br>see resulted in a lot of um a lot of<br>outputs so I think by that point i'<br>pretty much established myself as<br>remaining on land and I obviously<br>haven't gone back to the<br>seagrasses but while that was going on<br>there was also life happening and so<br>this timeline sort of represents a bit<br>more about what was going on in life<br>beyond just the career so I started my<br>first postto in 2022 and it was a 2-year<br>um project and uh what I've got here is<br>sort of the timeline all the way through<br>to<br>Professor so I achieved my I was awarded<br>my PhD in May uh 2003 and I<br>uh uh during that time yeah when I was<br>in the postdoc so the postdoc position I<br>actually started the week after I<br>submitted my PhD it's not something that<br>I recommend it was pretty exhausting but<br>in any case I decided I'd get myself<br>into something a bit more timec<br>consuming which is having kids so in<br>December 2004 our first child Callum was<br>born so not all of you know but uh this<br>is Callum and uh he was we like to<br>remember him in in happy and healthy<br>times but he was born with a red blood<br>disorder known as wisot Aldridge<br>syndrome so I had to stop work and spend<br>my time uh looking after him uh but<br>unfortunately the condition that he had<br>was so severe that um he had a<br>spontaneous brain bleed when it was 16<br>months old and died in<br>hospital so that was a big thing um that<br>was something that uh you never expect<br>in life and you never come to feel like<br>it's something usual uh and we obviously<br>miss him every day but he would have<br>December so in that light blue period I<br>was caring for Callum but then uh a year<br>after Callum died Brianna joined us and<br>then in two years after that aliser<br>joined us so Brana looks like she's not<br>pleased with that photograph but it was<br>my choice then in 2010 we got the<br>opportunity to move here to ELA so julan<br>and I had had our honeymoon here in 2000<br>so it seemed like a bit of a sign when<br>he got offered to come to New Zealand<br>for work so it's something that we kind<br>of couldn't turn down and uh we packed<br>up our lives and and moved over the<br>ditch even though I just started a<br>really good postto uh a threeyear long<br>position which was quite rare um I was<br>only six months into it but we thought<br>this was going to be be a bit of an<br>adventure so by that time by 2010 I had<br>my arms full with these two uh but also<br>I had my heart full because Brianna and<br>Alistair are just amazing kids and I<br>think there's nothing like being a<br>bereaved parent to really understand and<br>feel the joy of happy healthy kids so<br>Brian I love you<br>too was a bit nuts sometimes though in<br>fact very often I don't know where he<br>got that from<br>or perhaps this explains it but in<br>amongst all of that Shenanigans I was<br>trying to build a serious career and so<br>back to the timeline uh it took me a<br>while to sort of settle in here and then<br>I started doing some fixed home<br>contracts in teaching and other sorts of<br>activities first of all in the school of<br>environment uh and then I moved into SBS<br>in<br>2015 and as Jans just told us I had to I<br>I did manage to win a few bits and<br>pieces along the way and I think um uh I<br>really felt like I had to achieve uh to<br>be able to be taken seriously as a<br>parent I was working uh part-time for<br>much of that career and there's always<br>this stigma that if you're working<br>part-time you're not serious about your<br>research or about your career um but<br>that wasn't me obviously I managed to<br>achieve lots of different things um but<br>not not all by myself I do want to just<br>briefly say too that uh I've had a whole<br>lot of all of these red marks are<br>surgeries that I've had including an ex<br>topic pregnancy before Callum was born<br>so uh I would not be here if it weren't<br>for modern medicine so it's uh being a<br>bit of a ride right<br>Julian so managing to do all of that I<br>have so many friends and family and uh<br>colleagues and collaborators and<br>students to thank but I do want to um<br>single out a few people obviously<br>Julian's number one um I couldn't<br>imagine doing this with anybody else and<br>uh I'm think I think my second best<br>decision in life was to marry you and<br>the first best decision was to ask you<br>out so thank you for all that you do for<br>me I love you and then of course my<br>parents mom and dad so my parents have<br>come across to um Orland every school<br>holidays pretty much until uh my younger<br>brother had twins and Brianna and<br>Alistair were no longer the favorite<br>grandchildren but in any case really<br>appreciate um mom and dad with all the<br>support not just looking after the kids<br>but the encouragement and the enthusiasm<br>uh for my uh career as well I also want<br>to acknowledge my wonderful<br>mother-in-law uh we H there's a bit of a<br>language barrier and I think she thinks<br>it's kind of nuts that I'm a doctor of<br>trees it seems a bit useless um but<br>she's always very welcoming and makes<br>the best food so feel very lucky to have<br>her and then when it comes to friends I<br>want to single out Susie Wilds as a as a<br>wonderful friend so Susie and I met in<br>2012 when we were doing the women in<br>leadership program together<br>uh and we've been firm friends since<br>Susie as many will know is an incredible<br>person and uh is just the absolute best<br>friend one could have so not everyone<br>would know though that Susie and I<br>together applied for um our promotion to<br>professor and we work together on what<br>we were<br>submitting and it's very clear that<br>Susie is a highly accomplished<br>researcher she's an outstanding teacher<br>and of course everybody knows that she's<br>a good uh she's kind kind of good at<br>science<br>communication but having seen what Susie<br>submitted I was absolutely astounded to<br>find out that her uh promotion<br>application did not progress to the<br>international review stage could it be<br>because she took the university to court<br>I don't know it's not for me to say but<br>she went on and won that so there's<br>something in it um but Susie thank you<br>so much for all you are I feel so<br>blessed uh to call you as a friend and<br>and I'd also like to thank a few mentors<br>I think it's it's I've already mentioned<br>Derek who's somebody who was just really<br>incredible in how he uh supported me so<br>Derek and his wonderful wife Deb came to<br>uh callum's funeral um and he said to<br>they stayed till the end actually there<br>was lots of people there he stayed to<br>the end and he said is there anything I<br>can do for you and I said I need a job<br>because I didn't have a job and the<br>thought of being at home with no child<br>to look after and no job to go go to was<br>just too difficult so uh a couple of<br>weeks later I was back at work just<br>working two days a week um and doing the<br>job that I'd kind of been doing<br>previously but Derek didn't treat me as<br>a basket case he didn't treat me as some<br>kind of um charity uh he expected me to<br>deliver and that was actually what<br>exactly what I needed to feel like I<br>could be useful and that I could deliver<br>was a really important thing to me<br>around that time I also want to<br>acknowledge tally Palmer who was was a<br>professor at the time at UTS as well and<br>tally is an extraordinary woman just so<br>generous in her time and her the way she<br>shares things and so I've been in touch<br>with her in the last few weeks as well<br>she's recently retired she's back in<br>South Africa now um but she was sharing<br>some some memories that we had together<br>probably not appropriate for for sharing<br>here um but I feel very blessed to have<br>had her in my life and I think these are<br>two of the people that I really model my<br>own mentoring of on so I feel very<br>grateful to have worked with them I also<br>want to acknowledge Jacqueline bigs<br>who's here in the room who has been a<br>fabulous um mentor and supporter and<br>cheerleader too so thank you for all<br>that you've done Jacqueline again<br>probably some stories that I could tell<br>but but I won't and finally I want to<br>acknowledge my good friend Tim Karan and<br>I think Tim's somebody who just always<br>makes you be always true to your values<br>uh so Tim's at Lincoln University and<br>I'd call him more a peer-to-peer mentor<br>and I think that happens more as we<br>progress through our careers we become<br>mentors for those around us as much as<br>we are for people um at different career<br>stages so yeah Tim couldn't be here<br>tonight but I wanted to acknowledge Him<br>and the last person I want to<br>acknowledge is Vera Russell who is a<br>grief counselor at the center for<br>children's cancer and blood disorders um<br>Vera is a very private person so I don't<br>have a photo of her and I also couldn't<br>find one online um but I did 10 years of<br>grief counseling and uh ver was was just<br>an extraordinary person uh for that and<br>I wanted to acknowledge her because we<br>should um normalize the counseling or um<br>therapy um when we need those<br>things but also because she was she's<br>amazing okay so back to my timeline then<br>uh all of these Blue Points here are<br>points where I could have popped out in<br>the sense that I had contracts finishing<br>and I was madly trying to get the next<br>thing okay so 13 years of fixed term<br>contracts there's a lot of points where<br>I could have ended up not staying in the<br>program and I've acknowledged a few<br>people who helped me um get through at<br>some of those points there see lots of<br>people who've who've kind of helped but<br>actually probably it was mostly just<br>down to Julian going okay we'll just<br>keep trying sort of thing because uh<br>Julian Works in a different industry and<br>it just kind of doesn't really make<br>sense sometimes he'd say why are you<br>doing why are you still working when<br>you're not getting paid shouldn't the<br>university be paying you and I'll be<br>like well I'm between contracts so so<br>the kind of you know getting through was<br>something that I it only kind of became<br>apparent that it would work when it did<br>actually work out if that makes sense<br>and anyhow in uh 2015 I was awarded<br>raford Discovery fellowship and from<br>that I was able to negotiate a permanent<br>role um but I asked for this permanent<br>role based on a a a colleague who was in<br>the same faculty had received a the same<br>Fellowship the year<br>before and he had virtually been ushered<br>into a a permanent position he'd been<br>around for a while on fixed home<br>contracts and he was in through the<br>permanent position so the following year<br>when I won mine I kind of said oh you<br>know I want what he got and I was told<br>no so it took me nine months of<br>negotiations to to get that to come<br>through I had to go to a different<br>University and in fact I'm quite lucky<br>because um there were seven of the 10<br>fellowships went to our University that<br>year and so this is the advertisement<br>that the university put in the newspaper<br>and in fact it would have been a bit<br>embarrassing if one of those fellows had<br>then nipped off elsewhere because she<br>wasn't properly supported so that was<br>something that kind of helped me out a<br>bit I think there's been a few things<br>like that though where I've had to<br>really uh advocate for myself and uh I<br>think that kind of stuff toughens you up<br>but it's not fun to go<br>through so there's lots of barriers I've<br>shared a lot of the barriers that I've<br>had to deal with let's have a look at<br>the literature so women academics are<br>rated lower in student evaluations if<br>publishing with men the male author gets<br>given the credit women go for promotion<br>at a slower rate and this is not<br>necessarily because women are not<br>achieving it's often because women are<br>told oh you're probably not quite ready<br>so the process for going to Professor of<br>going for promotion to Professor<br>involves going to the dean and the dean<br>kind of says with the Well in that time<br>it was he thank goodness we've got Sarah<br>Young here now uh the dean at the time<br>said to me oh maybe you should wait a<br>year and I was like no last year was my<br>waiting year I'm going this year uh and<br>I spoke to him in that conversation<br>about how you know he should be thinking<br>about what it might be like for women<br>and he said oh I understand I understand<br>what it's like for women in science I am<br>a a computer scientist and I said how is<br>that relevant and he said well as<br>computer scientists our outputs are in<br>uh public they're not in normal<br>Publications they are in these<br>conference proceedings and so you know<br>people don't understand and I said oh<br>okay did you What's happen and he said<br>oh well we've just explained to people<br>that we can count the conference<br>proceedings as Publications and it's all<br>fine and so I said to him and did this<br>slow down your career progress at all<br>and he said no and I said I think it<br>might be a little bit different but I<br>couldn't go into it too much because I<br>was needing to seek his support for my<br>promotion application so it was a really<br>kind of difficult conversation where I<br>had to absolutely hold my tongue which<br>is not what I usually do um but<br>thankfully it's worked out all right in<br>the end and uh delighted to no longer<br>have man's exping and welcome uh Sarah<br>our new<br>Dean so women can be competent or<br>likable but never both and so this<br>literature plays out really clearly that<br>if you're a woman who knows what you're<br>doing well then you're obviously not a<br>likable woman are you and if you're a<br>likable woman then you don't really know<br>what you're doing so that can be fun the<br>Pastoral Care burden that's placed on<br>women is way greater than what's placed<br>on men and I want to say too that as a<br>white woman I obviously don't have the<br>cultural burden so so we know about the<br>cultural double shift where in here in<br>AOA Mari and Pacifica academics have<br>this additional burden of the cultural<br>um things that they need to be uh<br>contributing or they're expected to<br>contribute and none of that stuff as<br>much work as it is none of it is in the<br>documents for promotion uh<br>application the Chile climate of<br>Academia and this is something that's<br>kind of well known in the literature and<br>an example of this is that women more<br>likely to be harassed and intimidated<br>and a lot of these barriers are not just<br>in Academia there can be across uh<br>different types of workplaces as<br>well and then the last one here for all<br>of those points none of them I've said<br>anything about parenting uh in fact a<br>lot of the barriers are nothing to do<br>with uh being a parent uh but the<br>parenting sort of adds an additional<br>layer to it and so there's this concept<br>of the motherhood penalty versus the<br>fatherhood bonus where fathers are seen<br>as being competent and capable and<br>likable whereas mothers are spending<br>their time away from the workplace and<br>they're expected to be doing the<br>homework so an example of this is a<br>former head of school um when I was<br>working in the school of environment he<br>thought he was being nice and every time<br>I saw him he'd ask me how the kids were<br>and finally I said to him yeah they're<br>good thanks but you know have you asked<br>so a colleague had similar age children<br>I said have you asked my male colleague<br>how his kids are and he said no why<br>would I do that and I said well why are<br>you asking me then because when I was in<br>the workplace I wanted to be about doing<br>my work and uh I think he was a bit<br>taken aback but in about a year later he<br>said yeah I understood what you said in<br>the sense that uh I can somebody can be<br>more than they can be both a mother and<br>a worker they don't have to be H just a<br>mother all the<br>time okay so then all of this plays out<br>into the statistics that we see around<br>uh the sort of the gender distribution<br>so this is from a paper that leani<br>Walker LED and uh we looked at data we<br>only had sort of data from 2012 to 2017<br>so each panel is a separate year of data<br>but as you go from left to right on<br>these panels they sort of get more<br>senior so the women are in orange and<br>you can see consistently women drop off<br>below that 50% dotted line okay so we<br>see lots of women in the lower ranks and<br>is dropping off and the really<br>interesting thing is that this pattern<br>was seen in the 80s and we were told oh<br>you just have to give it time but in<br>fact it time is not um making that<br>difference that we'd expect that it<br>should so in the um analysis that we did<br>we looked at um what that pattern was<br>over the data set that we had and you<br>can see here that it sort of flattens<br>off and that was super depressing and so<br>if we kind of went with that curve then<br>it was never going to reach parity so we<br>said okay let's just hope that that<br>little bit there is um off course and if<br>we force a straight line through it we<br>estimated that it'll be about 10 years<br>in about 10 years time will have parity<br>for men and women uh in full-time<br>academic roles in New Zealand's uh sorry<br>in universities in<br>Al time will tell I mean we've still got<br>we've got a few more years of data to<br>add on to that so maybe we should think<br>about doing that<br>again so let's look at Solutions I think<br>it's a useful thing to do first of all<br>let's fix the system we've got to be<br>very clear that it's not women who are<br>broken it's in fact uh the system that's<br>broken and that's something that Susie<br>often says women are not broken uh and<br>it's not just women is it it's all the<br>different kinds of um types of<br>marginalization and and diversity so the<br>system itself fixing that is going to be<br>a big job let's think about some other<br>stuff we can do around that a lot of<br>what I've done is around challenging<br>institutional Norms so being told that<br>oh you know you don't fit the system<br>Kate well I just go ahead and do it<br>anyway let's do more of that because the<br>more we do things differently the more<br>those different things will be accepted<br>we should normalize nontraditional<br>career Pathways so me showing you my<br>what my pathway looked like is not about<br>me kind of wanting to I don't know self<br>indulge it's about me saying here's a<br>pathway that works there are lots of<br>different Pathways that work it's not<br>just one kind of pathway another thing I<br>would say too is talking about Calum is<br>a really difficult thing but I think<br>it's important that we do that that<br>because we have lives happening outside<br>of work I remember shortly after Callum<br>died there was a a woman who um didn't<br>have children and I know she was<br>well-meaning but she said to me oh you<br>shouldn't you shouldn't talk about<br>Callum and you shouldn't put it in any<br>applications you shouldn't put it on<br>your CV because it looks like you're<br>just trying to get<br>sympathy and I didn't have the space at<br>that time to kind of say well if I<br>wanted sympathy I've got my family and<br>I've got my bereev mother's group to go<br>to I was never trying to get sympathy<br>but it is about kind of saying you know<br>there's different things going on in our<br>lives and now I find that when I share<br>it particularly with with students and<br>early career researchers many will come<br>up to me afterwards and say thank you<br>for sharing something that makes me feel<br>like I can achieve too we don't need to<br>be absolutely perfect and our lives<br>don't need to be perfect for us to be<br>careers uh I think we need to adopt a<br>position of intellectual humility okay<br>so that's understanding what the uh<br>limits of our own knowledge are and<br>being open to other ideas and uh wanting<br>to hear from others and not just uh be<br>those speaking ourselves which is kind<br>of ironic when I've you know become a<br>professor and I'm here talking at you<br>all uh and that's something that I I do<br>try to do in my own life is to to be uh<br>intellectually humble and humble in<br>other ways too and I also think we<br>should challenge the notion of<br>Excellence so how we Define Excellence<br>is very biased to towards a particular<br>demographic group there is not just one<br>type of Excellence there are so many<br>types of Excellence let's uh think about<br>all of those I want to acknowledge uh<br>Mel zeppel who's somebody who was<br>involved in my career early on uh this<br>is was a really great solution for us<br>and an example of being creative around<br>sort of keeping the career going so when<br>uh Mel and I were poststocking together<br>just coincidently we didn't actually<br>plan it but our kids kind of um I guess<br>it's jumped over each other so when she<br>was on Parental leave I was at work and<br>then she got pregnant and then we'd<br>switch over so we managed to really<br>manage uh our kind of career together<br>which was a really successful thing for<br>both of us so our our kids are kind of<br>spaced um in amongst each other which is<br>nice uh if you want more solutions<br>written a paper on this addressing<br>gender inequalities in Forest science<br>and research and there's solutions for<br>all sorts of different people and what<br>they should be doing so everyone there's<br>no excuse for not being part of the<br>solution<br>and I want to really highlight the<br>importance of working with diverse<br>collaborators it's so easy for us in<br>Academia to just surround ourselves with<br>people like ourselves uh but working<br>with diverse collaborators gives us the<br>opportunity to understand different<br>perspectives and I really learned this<br>uh when I was working with Tara<br>mallister as a postto funded by tunatini<br>and the vision M capability fund so Tara<br>is a highly accomplished freshwater<br>ecologist but many will best know her<br>for her work on why isn't my professor<br>Mary so she's done all this work to<br>expose and highlight the um I guess it's<br>the imbalance in the uh in the in<br>Academia so working with Tara I really<br>refined the idea of making space and not<br>taking up space so how do we make sure<br>that uh people other than ourselves have<br>the platforms I think in Academia we're<br>used to kind of big noting ourselves<br>it's how we get ahead right but but we<br>need to be making space for others<br>making sure that the people who are not<br>at the table have space at the table and<br>that they are heard at the table Tara's<br>also talk me about the idea of being a<br>good visitor which I've found really<br>helpful in terms of being a uh I guess<br>I'm I like to be a pakha Al and uh just<br>thinking about different spaces and how<br>to be um active in a really constructive<br>way in those one of Tara's contributions<br>has been 50 reasons why there are no<br>Mary in your science department and I<br>know a lot of people found this quite<br>challenging when it first came out<br>because many people shared it with me<br>that they they found it upsetting and<br>it's true it is upsetting but I think<br>the important thing to remember is that<br>Tara is not the one that's made it<br>upsetting she's not the one doing these<br>things she's just highlighting them and<br>shining the light on them and uh telling<br>us that it's all going on so what I do<br>is kind of take a look at that every so<br>often it's not a nice document to look<br>at but it's important that we keep keep<br>reminding ourselves that these things<br>are still going on uh there's lots of<br>inappropriate things happening and we<br>need to be doing the work to address<br>that so I encourage everyone to to look<br>at those things to be getting used to<br>being uncomfortable and uh to try and be<br>active in the space to address that<br>because no matter how uncomfortable it<br>is for me as a white woman to read that<br>I can guarantee it's way more<br>uncomfortable for Tara to experience<br>those things and then to have to write<br>about<br>them and now challenging institutional<br>Norms sometimes they can be sort of<br>seemingly quite small things uh and this<br>is an example of something that I did so<br>in 2014 I missed out on the ruford<br>Discovery fellowship and I thought I was<br>going to have to leave uh research<br>because I didn't have any other options<br>to go to uh fortunately Jacqueline came<br>through with a position in SBS and<br>that's when I moved to biology but I<br>thought I wanted to go for this<br>Rutherford Fellowship again and I<br>realized that in accounting for like my<br>time since PhD<br>I hadn't taken into account my part-time<br>periods so I created this spreadsheet<br>which you can use to put in all of your<br>uh information about when you've been<br>working and when it's part-time and<br>stuff and then it tells you whether you<br>might be eligible or not for um the<br>particular fellowships so it's used for<br>fast starts and also for the the new um<br>uh Fellowship programs that the Royal<br>Society to our Pary has and what I love<br>is when people come up to me and say I<br>used your calculator and it makes me so<br>happy so so it's somewhat small thing um<br>but I think these kinds of things can<br>make a difference to people's uh<br>lives and then the last thing I want to<br>talk about here is getting into<br>something uh quite quite dark I guess<br>this is the pyramid model of<br>gender-based<br>violence and I presented this at uh the<br>I was invited to speak at a women in<br>Forest Symposium in voro in Italy in<br>July and I said to the lady organizing<br>the uh<br>Symposium I said um do you want to see<br>my slides before I speak because I knew<br>I was being a little bit um I guess<br>strong maybe is the word and she said oh<br>no no I trust you I trust you but I<br>think actually she may have wished she<br>saw my slides because what happened was<br>I talked about uh how we absolutely need<br>to be addressing inequality and<br>disadvantages and power differences at<br>the very base here because that's what<br>supports perpetrators okay so it's not<br>just about will it we be nice if we were<br>nice to each other it's about it's<br>essential that we have that we're<br>looking at these things to prevent um<br>violence and the other things that<br>happen in the workplace and it was so<br>interesting at this Symposium because I<br>put up at the beginning some photographs<br>of me climbing trees this photo in<br>particular and one of the students said<br>to me oh you can climb trees and I said<br>yeah and she said oh in our study only<br>the boys are allowed to learn to climb<br>trees you can imagine I was infuriated<br>on her behalf and uh asked for some more<br>details and I think actually she was<br>really glad to have the opportunity to<br>talk about it openly and so she<br>explained to me the fact that yeah when<br>it came time to do the tree climbing<br>training the girls were all told to you<br>know shuffle off healthware kind of<br>thing and it was potentially limiting<br>their career opportunities because they<br>weren't able to gain this skill so I<br>don't know I've caused all sorts of<br>trouble and I haven't heard back from<br>the people in Italy um but in any case I<br>think it's really important that we say<br>these things and I don't regret it at<br>all okay so I promis some trees let's<br>get back to the trees uh and when so if<br>we go back to 2010 when we moved here uh<br>I was looking for sort of I guess an<br>idea for for research and Cody being the<br>largest and longest live species in Al<br>seemed like a good species to work on<br>it's known that they're quite responsive<br>to climatic conditions and the tree ring<br>record shows that they have a good<br>response to the elino southern<br>oscillation pattern but the kind of the<br>nature of that response is a little bit<br>counterintuitive from a physiological<br>perspective so I thought that was a nice<br>place to sort of start doing some<br>research to understand the physiology of<br>these trees so Cody are of course highly<br>culturally significant and uh really<br>important for biodiversity this is a<br>photograph of the can canopy of tan<br>mahuta the largest living Cody and<br>there's something like 46 species of<br>epes live in the canopy so they're<br>immensely important uh for<br>biodiversity so I started working on uh<br>water fluxes of the KY Forest doing all<br>sorts of measurements basically<br>transferring some of the skills that I'd<br>learned in Sydney over here and uh uh<br>got a m and fast start to work on that<br>just looking at the kind of processes of<br>water use of Codi and how they changed<br>seasonally and under different<br>conditions and then we also looked at<br>the carbon flux<br>of uh the Cody Forest uh in together<br>with that but all of this work was<br>really just looking at the ambient<br>conditions and understanding how Cody<br>worked uh as the conditions were in 2015<br>when I got the raford discovery<br>Fellowship we were able to look at<br>actually creating kind of a manipulative<br>experiment in the forest so the Cody<br>drought experiment was a 5year project<br>uh looking at Curry performance under<br>dry conditions and uh this is pH student<br>Ben Cranston who did a lot of the work<br>so this is what it looks like we<br>basically put skirts on trees uh to dry<br>out the soil below those trees and then<br>we put lots of sensors on the tree to<br>try and work out what was happening so<br>we did lots of tree climbing lots of<br>measurements uh lots of um work in the<br>forest so very lucky to have the hpai<br>University so these are just some<br>photographs uh that from our setup Day<br>in 2017 when we were doing the main<br>setup lots of gear lots of figuring<br>things out and we worked with uh<br>professional tree climbers to help us do<br>the installations I'm grateful to have<br>um ano who's a photographer with the New<br>Zealand Geographic there on the day to<br>us a lot of planning making sure we've<br>got everything right got all the bits<br>and pieces that we need uh this kind of<br>Field Works super super challenging and<br>the thing was working with the<br>professional climbers they were kind of<br>looking after the safety for us and they<br>getting into the trees and then we would<br>have to look after the senses and what<br>we needed to do to get those<br>installed so we've had a number of<br>papers come out from this so far but<br>it's definitely watch this space because<br>we've got a whole lot more uh to come<br>and the data set that we collected is<br>really rich so I expect to be working on<br>it um with students for a number of<br>years to come but I do want to just show<br>you that we just one slide of dat from<br>that I could spend way more time talking<br>about this but I think um I think this<br>audience might prefer not too much uh of<br>the data so this is just showing that<br>the trees that we put the skirts on<br>actually had some signs of acclamation<br>to the dry conditions when the natural<br>drought happened so I don't know if<br>everyone remembers but when we went into<br>lockdown in 2020 there was actually a<br>drought happening uh in in the forest<br>across so it was deeply frustrating as a<br>drought researcher to have a drought<br>happening and we couldn't uh go out<br>there and measure it but fortunately a<br>lot of our sensors were still operating<br>so we did manage to get some good data<br>so this uh figure here shows the tree<br>water deficit and so the more a um line<br>goes down the more deficit there is and<br>each one of these um this is sort of a<br>number of days across the month here so<br>you can see that there's a cycle of day<br>and night as that tree water deficit<br>changes so if we go from December<br>January February March you can see that<br>the water deficit develops across the<br>summer so it gets worse as summer<br>progresses and then if we compare uh<br>sort of the 2018 to 2019 summer to the<br>2019 to 2020 Summer you can see there's<br>a lot more uh water deficit and it<br>developed earlier uh in the 2020<br>February compared to uh February<br>2019 but what we can see too is these<br>black and red lines so the red lines are<br>the trees that had the skirts on them<br>and the black lines are the ones that<br>didn't have the skirts and in general<br>what we found is that those trees<br>without the skirts that hadn't been<br>exposed to that mild drought were<br>developing much greater tree water<br>deficit during that severe drought<br>period so this is a good sign for Cody<br>and suggests that they can uh acclimate<br>to drier soils so if the climatic<br>changes are kind of slow enough and<br>gentle enough then uh potentially the<br>trees have good water saving<br>strategies and we also found that the<br>amount of water used from the stem<br>increased inreased for those droughted<br>trees so each one of these bars here is<br>either um a seasonal average for Drought<br>or control trees and in all the<br>different seasons uh for years two and<br>three you can see that the red ones are<br>higher than the gray ones and this just<br>demonstrates that the droughted trees<br>are using more water from their stored<br>water within their stem so Cy have got<br>massive stems and really deep sapwood<br>it's quite unusual that the sort of<br>depth of sapwood and the amount of water<br>water that they store in them but it<br>shows that that's quite important during<br>dry time so having that uh stem water<br>store is really useful for uh Cody<br>during drought so essentially we found<br>some really good and uh interesting news<br>but I'll move on uh from that so this is<br>sort of just showing what's coming out<br>of that work and it I think it might<br>take you a while to get through it all<br>it's a very uh detailed data set so this<br>is kind of the work that Ben did uh in<br>the middle here and a number of<br>different projects have sort of used the<br>data to interpret in other ways compare<br>it to other kinds of systems and they've<br>had a number of Master students also do<br>analyses this figure is from my final<br>report from my raford Discovery<br>Fellowship so things have moved on a<br>little bit now um but I think I just<br>like the way it shows the the different<br>types of activities and all the<br>different uh people involved in that<br>project I want to sort of change gears a<br>little bit now and talk about the non uh<br>I guess non- tree or the the broader<br>kind of biodiversity in climate change<br>work uh that I've done as well and so<br>I've had a number of contributions that<br>have involved large groups of people and<br>thinking about global patterns and<br>syntheses these two photographs are from<br>the true mortality Workshops the first<br>was in yenner in 2014 and the second was<br>in Hanover in 2017 this Palace is owned<br>by the Volkswagen foundation and they<br>just have people churning through going<br>to conferences if you ever get the<br>opportunity to go to one of the<br>Volkswagen uh workshops it's an amazing<br>Palace to visit so warmly recommend uh<br>going there it was really interesting<br>being in this Sumptuous Palace and then<br>talking about tree mortality it felt<br>very unusual but these um kinds of<br>contributions are a great way to kind of<br>think about you know what are the global<br>patterns what are the things we should<br>be looking out for how can we improve uh<br>funding and uh making connections and<br>understanding different approaches so<br>been really fortunate to be involved in<br>a number of papers in that way and some<br>of these other ones too are sort of<br>global um Global databases where we put<br>all the data together from different<br>places around the world to understand<br>what the the patterns are and when our<br>field-based work takes so much work it's<br>really nice to be able to have the data<br>used in different ways so sharing the<br>data and um making more use of it to<br>understand global patterns is a really<br>um a great<br>thing now I've also had some great<br>contributions around workshops and<br>transdisciplinary uh type of approaches<br>and I wanted to thank Margaret Stanley<br>but she can't be here this evening but<br>she sort of first introduced me to these<br>kinds of activities with a paper from<br>2015 that looked at the potential issues<br>on the horizon for uh Urban Ecology so<br>we used a workshop type approach to kind<br>of think about what the uh future issues<br>might be uh and produced a nice paper<br>out of that and so that kind of type of<br>approach is uh a really great way to<br>figure out what the main issues are and<br>this is another example here that I led<br>from uh 2016 there but actually the<br>paper didn't come out till this is one<br>here 2021 so oops five years between the<br>the workshop and the paper but what we<br>did show in this Workshop so we're<br>across lots of different disciplines so<br>transdisciplinary type approaches are<br>important for thinking about you know<br>what do we all think is different how<br>can we make a consensus is basically the<br>approach that we had here and this<br>Workshop was so interesting because we<br>started off thinking about what are the<br>main questions we need to think about<br>for climate change and biodiversity and<br>we realized that in fact uh that was<br>going to be really difficult to agree on<br>but what we could agree on was that<br>climate change impacts in aloa are<br>predominantly indirect and<br>exacerbating other uh threats rather<br>than being sort of really direct and<br>easy to measure so this kind of<br>exacerbation of existing conservation<br>threats um became the paper that that we<br>U produced and uh that's been really<br>highly cited because it's really showing<br>the concept here in Alo but it's also<br>applicable to Island systems around the<br>world we think and then also part of<br>that uh we produced a more comprehensive<br>review of climate change in Al uh<br>impacts on biodiversity and from those<br>ones it's been great because I've done<br>some Consulting with um or advising with<br>the ministry for environment and other<br>kinds of uh activities are also<br>contributing to the ipcc because I<br>developed um well we developed the the<br>knowledge uh around you know bringing<br>all that together and thinking about<br>what needs to be done there's a whole<br>lot more that needs to be done in that<br>space obviously so there'll be more<br>workshops to come I'm sure and then I<br>wanted to talk about these things that I<br>call side projects but in fact many of<br>these are the things that I'm most proud<br>of um they're not kind of my main line<br>of work but often it's students projects<br>that have sort of taken me off into<br>those different spaces but the one I<br>really want to highlight is this piece<br>with Tara and Dan hikaro um which is all<br>about thinking about bringing together<br>science and Indigenous knowledge in ways<br>that are appropriate and um developing<br>relationships that are enduring and uh<br>mutually<br>beneficial so where to next uh I will be<br>still working on drought and we know<br>that there's many other species besides<br>Cody that are responsive to Drought so<br>these are some photographs from that<br>2020 period uh as soon as we got out of<br>lockdown I was out uh having a look<br>around and seeing what was going on and<br>so there's a whole lot more that we<br>don't know but I'm also thinking about<br>some other stuff so climate change is<br>not just about drought and in fact we<br>know that temperature is obviously the<br>other one of the other big ones and so<br>this is for um tag gimoto the stripes<br>and as you'll all know those redder<br>stripes are those times when it's uh<br>getting hotter and hotter so thinking<br>about what the impact of heat will be on<br>Plants is some a new direction that I<br>want to take uh also thinking about how<br>we can do uh plant physiology in a more<br>culturally sensitive way Plant<br>physiologists are quite happy to kind of<br>uh kill plants without thinking about it<br>uh too much but should we be thinking<br>about ethics of working with plants uh<br>as as physiologists how should we uh<br>better treat uh plants particularly when<br>they're culturally important and then I<br>also want to acknowledge my collaborator<br>uh Professor Casey Barton from the<br>University of Hawaii um we've started a<br>project together looking at heteroblasty<br>and what that might mean for climate<br>change so we think about the species<br>that have quite different forms as<br>Juvenile and mature uh plants these<br>plants can look so different as juvenile<br>or mature that sometimes they don't even<br>look like the same species so we want to<br>understand whether uh either the<br>juvenile or mature form might be more or<br>less vulnerable to climate change<br>because nobody's really thinking about<br>that and so I've just really enjoyed<br>having uh a project that's all of my own<br>uh to do with Casey so that's been cool<br>but of course I do need to acknowledge<br>my students I haven't really talked much<br>about student work at all uh because I<br>want my students to have their own work<br>their work as their own I guess uh and I<br>would say though that working with<br>emerging researchers is one of the real<br>privileges of this job so I put this<br>together and I thought oh that looks a<br>bit like um the credits at the end of a<br>a movie um but I do I do feel really um<br>blessed to have had such a wonderful<br>group of students and some excellent<br>ones ongoing um but I guess I just<br>wanted to finish with a of a tribute uh<br>to to some of the people it's not a<br>complete thing it took me ages to put<br>this together and of course didn't get<br>everyone but uh yeah thanks to everyone<br>who I've worked with and uh thank you<br>all for being here this evening</p></main><footer style="margin-top: 2rem; background: #0001; padding: 2rem; text-align:
