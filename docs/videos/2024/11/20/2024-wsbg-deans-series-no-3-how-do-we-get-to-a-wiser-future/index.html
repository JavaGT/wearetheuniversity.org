It is shaped by the decisions we have made in the past and those we are making now. These choices encompass how we organize our society, structure and manage our economy, determine our investments, and decide whom we value and support. These pivotal decisions hinge on asking—and thoroughly answering—many critical questions.<br><br>Once again, Professor Jane Bryson steered a fascinating conversation, featuring Helmut Modlik, CEO, Tumu Whakarae, and two students from Wellington Girls' College, Teresa Ng and Millie Aislabie. Professor Markus Luczak-Roesch, Chair in Complexity Science, was unable to attend on the day. <br><br>The discussion covered a range of topics, including the challenges of an aging population, potential changes to the school education system, and the possibility of lowering the voting age. The highly engaged audience contributed insightful questions and perspectives that enriched the dialogue. Those in attendance were treated to a robust exchange of ideas, making for a thoughtful and dynamic conversation. It was a fitting conclusion to the series.</p><h2>Transcript</h2><p style="opacity: 0.9; font-size: 0.8em">Transcripts may be automatically generated and may not be 100% accurate.</p><p>now unfortunately um Marcus looks at G<br>uh chairing complexity science is unwell<br>today and so he's unable to be with us<br>so that gives a little more time to the<br>speakers that we do have who I'm really<br>um happy to welcome um first of all<br>helmet<br>of um and it's great to have you here<br>helmet um we were just saying that he<br>also was a guest speaker in Dan's class<br>earlier in the year so we're borrowing a<br>lot of your time helmet and your wisdom<br>today um helmet has a lot of experience<br>um an executive leadership um before<br>moving to um The Run um and I'm sure has<br>a lot of wisdom to share with us and<br>he's been up very early this morning um<br>opening a new building for the well City<br>Mission awesome which is great um and<br>maray edri those of you that were here<br>last time was one of our guest speakers<br>from the wel Mission and also this<br>morning uh on the topic of wisdom or<br>getting to a wiser future we have two um<br>wonderful uh young women from Wellington<br>girls college<br>um Theresa in uh who's the head of<br>student learning committee at wel girls<br>uh and who along with um Millie as Ley<br>uh led the they both LED the student<br>response to the unforeseen property<br>risks at Wellington girls college<br>earlier this year I think that might<br>have involved a protest at<br>Parliament um and uh they are very<br>active you can see from their Blazers<br>lots of badges uh and we really look<br>forward to hearing from you about<br>getting to a wiser<br>future so um you'll recall that we had<br>uh the first session in this series was<br>um how to get to a healthier future for<br>all uh the second was how to get to a<br>wealthier future for all and today is<br>how to get to a wiser future for<br>all um and I think we've got a great<br>panel to kick us off from that sort of<br>discussion I was very keen to have<br>younger people on the panel um that's<br>why I got helmet as<br>well comedian as<br>Teresa um and as I've said at each of<br>these sessions I believe a key public<br>role of universities and of faculties<br>like ours that combine both business and<br>government um is to create opportunities<br>to examine<br>issues from different<br>perspectives and we've had a blend of<br>academic and external speakers um many<br>of whom have been alumni of this<br>University to discuss these<br>topics um so I look forward to this<br>morning we're going to follow the usual<br>um process that we have had where um<br>there are two sets of questions that<br>I've hosed our<br>speakers<br>um and I will<br>give each of them well originally it was<br>8 minutes but given Marcus isn't here<br>they can we can stretch it to 10 um to<br>talk about the first question which is<br>in your opinion what does a wiser future<br>for all look like and what are the two<br>or three key challenges to achieving<br>it so we'll get each of them to speak on<br>that and then<br>um the second question is what is<br>essential to address those challenges<br>and um we'll get each of them to speak<br>on that um for around 5 minutes and then<br>we'll open it up for for<br>discussion so with um not much further<br>Ado I will um turn the microphones on<br>on and we'll start with with helmet um<br>what does a wiser future for all look<br>like and what are the two or three<br>Challengers challenges to to achieving<br>it in two minutes<br>yeah it's like this s p 15 so to begin<br>can I ask if there are any um um say<br>professional philosophers in the room<br>anyone who studied philosophy all right<br>so I can I can exaggerate and no one<br>will know the<br>difference it's good to be with you um<br>so I'm going to I guess make some<br>philosophical observations to kick off<br>with because you know it's hard to talk<br>about wisdom um without grounding<br>yourself at something um uh you know all<br>of us think we see the world as it is<br>but in fact that's um in some sense not<br>possible truth is that we all see the<br>world as we are you there's no<br>alternative world doesn't speak for<br>itself and we have to perceive it you<br>know with our senses and coordination<br>and that that inevitably means that um<br>you know the frames the lenses the<br>parades that are in our head that come<br>to us through our upbringing<br>socialization in a very real sense<br>dictate the reality and the world that<br>we perceive uh these are not new<br>observations but they relevant to some<br>effectors I'm going to share I was<br>intrigued with the frame that I got my<br>memory shows me right in my email will<br>ensure I do the um the the theme was<br>getting a fairer future for all healthy<br>wealthy and wise and I was immediately<br>struck by the order of that um a fear of<br>future healthy wealthy and wise why I<br>struck by that was<br>you know wisdom like<br>rationality is not value free um you<br>know both actually um necessarily<br>require a grounding or Foundation of our<br>priority preferences of values you know<br>culture so a group of people is what<br>personality is the individuals and both<br>components of both are values the<br>preferred states of being or acting that<br>that actually determine what's good uh<br>and not good and so you know when we say<br>something like um getting to a fearer<br>future uh that's healthy wealthy and<br>wise um uh I my mind immediately jumped<br>wouldn't it make more sense to say<br>something like get into a wiser future<br>that was healthy wealthy and fair so<br>that's the first twist that I'd like to<br>throw on it and and and make some<br>connection between those words as it<br>occurs to me<br>anyway um fear when I thought about fear<br>has being a primary objective for<br>society that we would want to pursue<br>reflection for me was<br>um<br>uh what does fairness mean to me to me<br>um it it's got to be grounded in some<br>sense of the uh equal value or worth of<br>of of human beings hard to talk about<br>fairness if if you don't begin with that<br>premise my mind you know people haven't<br>always thought that way and many people<br>still don't you know um um devaluing<br>other human beings because of race<br>because of gender you know heaven forbid<br>being a a colored woman who's you know<br>lbtq yeah you're at the bottom of the<br>pile you know in some people's minds but<br>but if we reject that premise that<br>people in fact are fundamentally of<br>equal value uh and and and I think<br>there's there's logic and and evidence<br>for taking that position as well as it<br>just you know being good to my mind if<br>we if we start with the premise that<br>people are of equal value and work then<br>the my mind will flows out of that if we<br>if we're trying to pursue fairness is<br>the the idea<br>that that that our<br>preferences<br>um are equivalent you know what what we<br>want for ourselves as we pursue<br>happiness which I think is fair to say<br>is the object of all conscious life is<br>not rational to want to be miserable so<br>we we'll we'll assume that we all trying<br>to be happy uh in some sense and that<br>our choices uh and the opportunity and<br>the freedom to pursue that is is got<br>something to do with fairness so we're<br>worth the same it it it flows that our<br>our ability to have opportunity and<br>choices to pursue as we perceive our<br>happiness to to to where it deres is<br>it's got something to do with what a a<br>fear Society uh what it looks like<br>so that then leads me then to the other<br>words that were in the theme health and<br>wealth see immediately my mind oh<br>fairness when it comes to health and the<br>freedom to choose see an interesting<br>thing is that for me wellbeing which is<br>a bigger concept than health is a<br>multifactoral thing The Human Condition<br>is a multiactor thing right we aren't<br>just organic machines you even though<br>adopters treat us like that um that that<br>our physical psychological<br>emotional uh spiritual uh and even wider<br>dimensions are all in play um when we're<br>talking about<br>wellbeing and that at the heart of that<br>though uh are choices so the well-being<br>you know our wellbe in health is highly<br>correlated with having more resources<br>and therefore more choices you know<br>people who are better off tend to be<br>more healthy why it's because they<br>typically on average have um a greater<br>understanding education of what gives<br>rise to being well they have resources<br>they give them bit more options the<br>homes are are warmer um<br>Etc uh so um a healthier<br>future does mean that we have to in my<br>mind um respect the equivalence of human<br>beings enable um some sense of uh<br>equivalence of opportunity of choice but<br>not<br>outcome see it doesn't follow for me<br>that pursuing equal outcomes make sense<br>because if I Choose You know I I I want<br>to lose some weight and I do you know<br>hav't caught up for my C<br>thing um but I really like ice cream you<br>know and it's my choice you know how I<br>balance out those two<br>conflicting um preferences as we all do<br>so is it really right that somebody<br>forces me you that does violence to the<br>equivalence of our value and our freedom<br>to choose ah but then that gives rise to<br>the consequences of our choices and is<br>it fair that you<br>pay it's real taxation for my poor<br>choices yeah that doesn't that doesn't<br>seem fair so there are some complexities<br>in US teasing out the boundaries of uh<br>our fairness and our choices and<br>consequences and information that flows<br>back to us um as a consequence of what<br>we choose and the boundaries it seems to<br>me of where our fearness ends is where<br>unfairness Begins for others now I'm<br>pecking a lot in in my 10 minutes so<br>you'll forgive<br>me but all of this has resource<br>implications which leads me to a<br>wealthier future that somehow Was<br>Fear um what do I think about wealth<br>well you know all all options that we<br>may exercise all choices we may make<br>what have resource<br>implications and you know on the on the<br>fairness and equivalence<br>frame um it does seem to me to be fair<br>that we would organize ourselves so that<br>um<br>opportunity for the development of the<br>capability uh to have resources to make<br>choices make<br>sense um wealth or Surplus you know<br>arises out of Confluence of opportunity<br>capability and resource think about that<br>I used to have a um a little sign over<br>my test I was a young Bud an<br>entrepreneur opportunity plus capability<br>plus resource equals anything you want<br>and you know that that all three are are<br>required in order to to create a cus and<br>therefore have greater wealth but one of<br>the one of the issues again that gives<br>rise to that is um while it's not a some<br>zero game we haven't yet figured out how<br>to align the um interest of Labor and<br>capital we have not figured that out the<br>best thing we've got is Taxation and<br>everybody hates<br>it people who pay it hate it and the<br>people who get paid the um you know the<br>distributive payments don't like being<br>Biggers either so we haven't cracked<br>that one another another logical<br>challenge for us in the um in the world<br>side of things is<br>um is that it is a finite world and um<br>the you know industrial revolution<br>post-industrial revolution has all been<br>about growth more and I think the time<br>has arrived for us to talk about enough<br>um but we'll get there in a second<br>so challenges a am I checking challenges<br>on the table Yeah okay cool real quick<br>challenges<br>first number one challenge is we need a<br>civil uh<br>society that is uh designed to optimally<br>create the conditions for a uh what did<br>I say healthier wealthier and um faer<br>Society currently we do not have<br>uh such a civil<br>society um I won't get into it unless<br>you ask me but the the inherent flaws in<br>the um<br>um form of democracy that we<br>operate are glaring uh and given rise to<br>Great inequality and challenges that are<br>currently stretching our social fabric<br>so we we made it up so we can make up a<br>better one and I look forward to talking<br>about what that might be so that's one<br>challenge second challenge uh when it<br>comes to our our economy is um we're<br>falling off a demographic Cliff with the<br>majority of the world so in recent<br>decades for range of reasons we're not<br>having children<br>anymore that means that our Workforce is<br>shrinking that means that all of the<br>premises that we've created around that<br>the growth oriented society and<br>economies are on Shaky Ground what are<br>we going to do about that you can only<br>import your labor uh for so long and you<br>end up in a global competition and race<br>for those<br>people so aligning the interests of<br>Labor and capital um<br>our core resource of people yeah big<br>challenges last challenge I'll I'll<br>finish on and I was piing the chain<br>about this before he came<br>in this is theuser from my<br>perspective um one of the reasons I was<br>very glad that uh Teresa and milia here<br>this<br>morning is that um we Face a significant<br>challenge moving forward on how<br>to how to ensure the transmission of<br>intergenerational wisdom think about<br>that for a<br>second no one in the room has any idea<br>what the young ladies think about much<br>at<br>all because their paradigms their<br>Windows their frams their values are<br>very different from us great here no<br>hiss and the Generations that have come<br>since we did<br>up um our Our Generations before had um<br>societal mechanisms for transmitting<br>what I called wisdom<br>intergenerationally they are largely<br>broken down disappearing and replaced<br>with things that are resulting in<br>isolated<br>fragmented um data Rich wisdom<br>poor um<br>realities for so many people so even all<br>of those who have gone before and here<br>yet full of all the wisdom of the<br>universe and the Art of course what is<br>the mechanism for us transmitting that<br>to the generations that will come now<br>I'm ke to hear what you got to say about<br>that so those are my opening bids foro<br>on what uh wisdom constitutes and<br>fairness and uh well some of the big<br>rock issues to um challenge us me for<br>joining thank you very much nor um we'll<br>move on to Millie and Teresa now you're<br>going to do a joint Tech I'm not sure<br>how you want to organize it um we're<br>going to oh yeah we'll do this do a<br>short interv verion each I think that's<br>thank you very much is that oh I feel<br>like it's a bit loud but that's okay um<br>everyone I to preface this obviously<br>this comes from a high school lens so my<br>facts and figures might not<br>be<br>uh there might not be many of them but<br>um the the the opinions are definitely<br>mine and um they come from a place of<br>well I mean if we think about wiseness<br>think maybe because of my lived<br>experience wiseness to me is is about<br>education first and foremost um because<br>I have not haven't yet experienced<br>anything else right and I think that the<br>formative years of a person's life are<br>are very very important for building the<br>um you know skill set that you have<br>going forward and the information that<br>you go into higher education or go into<br>the workforce with and in order I think<br>to build a wiser future I would probably<br>first say that you need to start at at a<br>Grassroots level at a very very very<br>young age so that children and teenagers<br>learn the I don't want to say the right<br>things but the right things for for them<br>um and learn a broad range of those<br>things and you know not just how to you<br>know not just the quadratic formula<br>right you know how to be compassionate<br>how to talk to others how to deal with<br>conflict um because I think that then<br>from there when you enter your your<br>adulthood in the rest of your life it's<br>it's much easier to um create a society<br>that is that is healthy wealthy and wise<br>and and that is fair<br>because our values are engraved in us<br>from a very very young age I can say<br>that for sure because I you know<br>obviously prefrontal cortex still<br>developing but it's it's um once it gets<br>there I I don't think that my<br>personality I think that my personality<br>will still very much be shaped um you<br>know by who I was and what I was taught<br>and who I was taught by um so in terms<br>of of getting to a wiser future I think<br>it probably looks like one where we have<br>a very very strong public education<br>system um um and our education system in<br>New<br>Zealand it's fine you know like we're<br>getting there but um it's it's I think<br>really important that we look at<br>education with a a child's lens I I'm<br>I'm not really sure how to articulate<br>this but I think a lot of the time we<br>expect to fix issues like you know a<br>lack of of wisdom or holistic education<br>in society or literacy and unity rates<br>Etc with throwing money at the problem<br>or reallocating funding from one place<br>to another and just kind of expecting<br>that the the easiest or the most obvious<br>way to fix something will be the one<br>that works um<br>and I I don't think that's true uh so as<br>example that comes to<br>mind um I'm sure a lot of you will have<br>seen it on the news the reallocation of<br>the funding from T or t earlier this<br>year which was a professional<br>Development Fund for teachers to learn<br>everyday M to use in the classroom and<br>that funding was reallocated from<br>professional development to the rest of<br>the education sector and one of the<br>things that came about from it was um<br>new numeracy workbooks for primary<br>schools so for year I think 5 to8 numy<br>yeah I'm sure there are lots of kids<br>that would benefit from that but the<br>problem that we have in this country<br>with education I I don't think is a lack<br>of um hard resources I don't think it's<br>that kids are not having enough<br>worksheets in class or that you know<br>they their teachers aren't giving them<br>the right times tables to learn I think<br>it it is things like you know having a<br>teacher that can that has knowledge of T<br>and that you know is is going to instill<br>important values in you from a young age<br>and that has good access to professional<br>development so I think that when we re<br>reallocate funding in order to in terms<br>of Education in order to get to a wiser<br>future we have to think about what<br>uh what the stakeholders think rather<br>than I think what the governing body<br>thinks because if if I'm totally honest<br>I think there's a little bit of a lack<br>of stakeholder engagement in the<br>education sector I mean we have what is<br>it like a million kids in public schools<br>or slightly less than million and we<br>very rarely get asked what we think um<br>as helmet was saying I'm sure that you<br>all have probably picked up some of my<br>opinions by now but it's when we make<br>decisions about education they very<br>often come from like a ah yes I am a<br>parent and you know my child you know<br>like if we talk about as an example<br>maybe like a learning disability right<br>oh yeah I have a child with uh ADHD and<br>I've seen how they act at home here all<br>the things I think about what's going to<br>be best for them in terms of the<br>development of the education sector no<br>one ever asked the kid right um<br>and it I I really do think<br>that even in a non-traditional sense if<br>we<br>had you know the Ministry of Education<br>went into schools and literally sat down<br>with a 5-year-old and just kind of like<br>you know got out some crayons how do we<br>chat and just asked children what do you<br>think of your classroom what could be<br>better what parts of learning do you<br>like and don't like CU our teachers ask<br>us that and that's great but our<br>teachers don't always have the the most<br>freedom to do what they think is going<br>and I think many people would be<br>surprised that even if you don't get the<br>most eloquent or um fact checked answer<br>from a child or a teenager you will<br>definitely get one that is enlightening<br>and that will give you some really good<br>data or evidence or opinions for policy<br>changes that are made um and I think<br>that's really important to take into<br>consideration not to kind of say listen<br>to Young people but listen to Young<br>People<br>um yeah<br>and I'm very lucky to have I mean<br>obviously we're at a public school but<br>we're at a very well-resourced public<br>school um you know High Dell area we're<br>very lucky to be in a place<br>where I like I run the peer tutoring<br>system at school right but I can only do<br>that because kids have enough energy to<br>come to school in the morning and have<br>had breakfast and you know like can sort<br>of yeah like like have those those base<br>resources and have have and to be able<br>to be engaged with the education system<br>and then again we have the idea that oh<br>to deal with treny you have to go into<br>people's homes and tell them that<br>they're doing something wrong right and<br>but they're a very structural system<br>reasons that kids cannot learn in school<br>and so I think that's something else to<br>think about just to make sure that it's<br>clear that while my lens as a public<br>school student I also think that there<br>are many many schools<br>that you know I would not be able to be<br>sitting here right now because I I kids<br>don't have access to breakfast you know<br>the the school luncher scheme has been<br>drawn back you know like there's a lot<br>of factors that I think the education<br>system could be improved want if we<br>yeah<br>um I wanted to speak a little bit more<br>on um youth representation and uh make<br>it 16 um I mean it's no secret 16year<br>olds and 17 year olds they have jobs<br>they pay taxes they sometimes pay rent<br>sometimes they support their families<br>themselves they live in moldy Flats<br>things like that um our country is also<br>it's one of the worst in the oec the for<br>youth mental health um 16-year-olds they<br>can have a firearms license things like<br>this um I think it's incredibly<br>important to um consider 16 16 yearolds<br>and 17 year olds voices at a systemic<br>level because um believe it or not we<br>have something to say uh and we're<br>pretty good at saying it at times um<br>there's so many issues and experiences<br>that 16y olds deal with but they have<br>no control or voice to express their<br>concerns um with our current um voting<br>age so just to speak on that quickly um<br>make it 16 but um my the my main point<br>of discussion that I wanted to talk<br>about was um I feel like we often<br>attack you use the word wisdom or wise<br>in place of like intelligent or or smart<br>and I take the word from a purely<br>academic standpoint but I sort of I I<br>looked up the definition of wise while I<br>was creeping um just more about having<br>knowledge and and being able to make<br>judgment um that sort of led me to<br>believe um know lead me to think about<br>um the Arts and the power of Arts for<br>for making change but also creating a<br>wiser future um Arts education I believe<br>to is incredibly important at at all<br>levels at primary and secondary um I<br>mean Arts education at at a primary<br>level it's able to it it studies show<br>that um in young children it really<br>helps to build resilience starting at a<br>young age as well it builds confidence<br>St um Arts education I mean you might<br>not end up as an actor but you you you<br>end up as a person with um the ability<br>to speak in front of people with with<br>good leadership skills and and and sort<br>of public speaking abilities and things<br>like that which um I think are<br>incredibly important as we look to the<br>Future and we're building this<br>generation of um wise people um but so<br>in Ju ju of this year um the coalition<br>government they defunded the creatives<br>in schools program which was a program<br>started in 2020 um designed to extend<br>Arts education in primary and secondary<br>schools over its threeyear run it helped<br>over 350 schools uh our school was one<br>of those um the the program was really<br>effective in<br>getting children back getting children<br>and teenagers back into the Arts so<br>since 2003 the number of NCA students<br>enrolled in arts such as music dance<br>drama and as curriculum subjects has<br>decreased dramatically almost halfed um<br>which is such a disappointment because<br>what I was saying the the Arts are so<br>integral at creating a a well-rounded<br>individual a person who<br>a a good worker at someone who's<br>employable but<br>um not only that but they<br>enrich primary and high school life but<br>um the creative and schools program it<br>was really effective and I think um sort<br>of<br>revitalizing the Arts especially at a<br>secondary level so for for us that<br>looked like we we were able to work with<br>um Mel Dodge who she just finished a run<br>at um circuit doing primary faing so the<br>the program helped fund schools to work<br>with professional practitioners<br>professional actors um which are<br>incredibly invaluable experiences um we<br>learn a lot we did script writing we<br>were able to it funded us going and um<br>performing in larger spaces which if you<br>know anything about our school we don't<br>have a hall so that was great um but so<br>this whole program was defunded um which<br>I believe to be incredibly unfortunate<br>so around $3 million a year was going to<br>this creatives and schools program and<br>that has all been now moved around the<br>um the education sector um without<br>programs like programs like that um I<br>only just deep void of what makes it so<br>rich and special but also the<br>opportunity for growth and opportunity<br>for uh boosting confidence in many young<br>people's lives is lost and and I I think<br>people often sort<br>of misjudge the Arts and especially at a<br>secondary level but I mean this studies<br>to show that that Arts education can I<br>mean if you take music you're you're<br>more likely to do better in your stem<br>subjects things like that but also on<br>the issue of truy which you were talking<br>about for a bit<br>um I I just find it a bit Rich to expect<br>students to want to come to school when<br>you've defunded what makes school so<br>special I just I don't know I wouldn't<br>want to go to a school where they<br>couldn't act and sing and do things like<br>that but so that expectation for me was<br>a bit a bit rich I think to sorry to<br>come back to the point of a wiser future<br>um a wiser future I don't think exists<br>without Arts education I think it's<br>really integral for for all young people<br>I mean I think about just IND and her<br>ability to all politicians really to to<br>memorize the speech that's just like<br>memorizing lines and drama the the<br>fundamental skills that that get built<br>from from primary to secondary school<br>and they really do make great<br>you thanks very much interesting range<br>of views I've got a power of notes now<br>um now we'll just spend a few minutes<br>each um um the second question which was<br>what's essential to address the<br>challenges that<br>you've seen you've sort of partly<br>answered I did but um so it could just<br>yeah look um I did allude to what I<br>think are some the key challenges<br>um uh in no particular order I I do<br>think we do have to front up to<br>the uh fact that our our civil society<br>is currently designed<br>uh has fores that has created the<br>largest social physical infrastructure<br>deficit in<br>history that incentivize is exaggerated<br>adversarial Behavior by politicians that<br>drives us crazy in results and<br>frequently policy you frequent policy<br>reversals that waste all of our time<br>money and energy that gives rise to you<br>know non-evidence-based policy formation<br>implemented by Silo uh government<br>agencies uh that are more designed to<br>mitigate risk and to implement change<br>and I could go on and on and<br>on I I repeat you know uh liberal<br>democracy all his forms and the various<br>designs of the Machinery of government<br>they just ideas we made up for and um<br>it's incumbent on us if we want to<br>address the the root causes which I'm<br>saying are the root causes of so much of<br>the ill we see in our society including<br>the ones that just alluded to by our<br>young ladies here um so if we actually<br>had a a genuine evid evidence-based<br>policy formation process then they<br>wouldn't have shut down either of the<br>two things that you uh alluded to at<br>least without a sound cost benefit<br>analysis and not a narrow cost benefit<br>analysis a um you know multifactoral one<br>so first thing we've got to do funno is<br>to to call it that we need a learning<br>democracy turn it we need to figure out<br>how to do it better second thing I would<br>say um is well I've alluded to a<br>demographic cliff yeah I'm something<br>going to say out have babies<br>but the babies we have we need to do<br>better with and I'll end with that I'll<br>end with that I think the alignment of<br>the interest of Labor and capital<br>there's quite a bit of innovation going<br>on in the world about that so the living<br>wag is a small and obvious example for<br>instance na we we we're a living wage<br>organization and we um but another thing<br>we're trying is to um um normalize the<br>opportunity for 4 years of being a young<br>Enterprises to be shareholders so we set<br>aside a portion of the equity and make<br>available you know shareholding<br>opportunities for employees so that they<br>learn what it means to be an owner of a<br>business and they you become financially<br>literate and they become stakeholders<br>and Alliance incentives you that's<br>hardly like woo what a bad idea but it's<br>you an example<br>of yeah getting alignment um so yeah<br>have plenty to do on the economic front<br>um but the two things I'd like to finish<br>on is um the intergenerational wisdom<br>bit and it comes back to the having<br>babies but uh oh no one more need to say<br>first actually so none of this makes<br>sense at all if we don't have sufficient<br>homogenity of societal values right the<br>US is on a road to<br>hell and they started at the top of that<br>hill and they're getting towards the<br>bottom now because they never had<br>sufficient wisdom in in the various<br>locations we've got are created and<br>prated and institutionalized and<br>ritualized to stop the Journey of<br>polarization that is threatening to tear<br>them apart um thankfully we're nowhere<br>near there nowhere near there I would I<br>would site our ability to um construct<br>Fortress New<br>Zealand uh um<br>you know create the team of five million<br>and a couple years ago as a case point<br>that there was sufficient homogen and<br>what is Meaningful good in this and U<br>sufficient it was a game in two halves<br>the second half was a bit rubbish but<br>the first half was pretty<br>solid so but what I'm going with that<br>fun is we do have to decide what is good<br>you know what our preferences are is<br>fness at the top of our tree you you<br>know or uh or is there something else<br>now that that's not a make it happen<br>thing that's a you know it's literally a<br>choice that's up to us and<br>um certain talking about that last thing<br>babies and uh intergenerational wisdom<br>transmission with respect to our young<br>guests as important vocally important is<br>the classroom is in the hall where the<br>acting takes place the most fundamental<br>place where the U creation and<br>transmission of intergenerational wisdom<br>occurs as the<br>hope and indeed the village that we all<br>are raised it well H out what they used<br>to be F and Villages sure ain't what<br>they used to be there is a problem you<br>know the head long pursuit of<br>materialistic<br>accomplishment uh materialism generally<br>has created<br>um isolation has created um you know<br>children um trying to figure it out the<br>idea of a 16-year-old being in a flat<br>mold or otherwise is uh a s reflection<br>um but the idea of villages both<br>metaphorically and literally you know a<br>thing that's uh that's where see here's<br>a reflection here's something for for<br>for young guest and so so see knowledge<br>and data I've been around a lot of<br>really smart people people who I<br>wouldn't give a corner Dairy to run you<br>know that that that um you know data and<br>um ability to recite information isn't<br>actually we wisdom arise wisdom I think<br>arises out of the um experience of<br>applying that knowledge and seeing what<br>happens what works what doesn't and what<br>makes us happy and what doesn't and one<br>of the great things about belonging to a<br>family and a village with that those<br>prior lessons can be passed on you don't<br>have to learn more yourself every time<br>in fact TR trusted voices trusted faces<br>and trusted places are able to<br>share those same Lessons Learned 20 30<br>40 years ago so you don't have to now of<br>course you still will but that's the<br>Journey of us all isn't it um so last<br>thing then for me and uh I love this<br>quote first time I hear it and I love it<br>to die Dan fin Thea God bless you see<br>take care of our children take care of<br>what they see take care of what they<br>hear take care of what they feel for how<br>the children grow so will be the shape<br>of<br>all that's the fear and wise future that<br>lies before us and I have to say we're<br>not doing very good about taking care of<br>what our children are feeling seeing or<br>F I basically said what I wanted to S to<br>16 um countries like Austria Scotland<br>and Wales I believe they've made it 16<br>already they are seeing far much more<br>consistency people who start voting<br>younger they they continue to vote I<br>mean in in this country we have sort of<br>a a a disproportionately<br>low level of of young voters those sort<br>of<br>younger age groups um so I think to to<br>get young<br>people talking and using their voice and<br>continue to use their voice I think<br>making it 16 is incredibly important um<br>also reinstate the creative schools<br>program please I thought it was<br>fantastic it worked really well for me<br>and I think it would work really well<br>for a wiser future that's of all I have<br>to<br>say awesome yeah well agreed on the<br>creatives and schools thing I um PR PR<br>PR face is that how you say it was um a<br>real really important learning<br>experience I think for that entire class<br>and I think it's really important that<br>there's um outside of the classroom<br>education opportunities as well which<br>also obviously comes from funding<br>education more but um in terms of how do<br>we get there to a wiser<br>future there's a couple things there's<br>what I was talking about before with<br>talking to young people I think framing<br>it as stakeholder engagement is one of<br>the easiest ways to get people to<br>actually listen<br>because even above a principled level of<br>like you should listen to everyone in<br>society you know even if they aren't<br>engaged civically yet you know even if<br>they're young and not going to be the<br>most you know not going to give you like<br>concrete funding reallocation options um<br>even above a principal level you are<br>going to get the best educational<br>outcomes if you listen to the people<br>that are in the system so I would say if<br>we want to get to a place where New<br>Zealand's educational outcomes are<br>globally competitive and also fair and<br>Equitable um<br>you need students to be wiser education<br>providers and finances as well Ministry<br>of Education um and private private<br>providers as well to be to be educated<br>educated on education um teachers<br>legislators Etc um because then<br>consequently you have a wiser Workforce<br>economy and you have you know better<br>better well-being generally as a as a<br>country so I I think that currently we<br>don't use our data capital or or labor<br>effectively in terms of Education I<br>think that there is too much of a focus<br>on I sorry I think that there is too<br>much legislative power or<br>decision-making power given to people<br>with governance expertise um I know<br>we're in the government building and I<br>do value governance I think it's a very<br>important thing but um I think that<br>giving more autonomy to teachers and<br>students is something really important<br>to think about and I would charter<br>schools here not that I am in support of<br>charter schools because I do think that<br>the the way that they were done in the<br>past and the way that they are being<br>proposed now is is flawed and will<br>likely waste money that could be going<br>into the public system um the principle<br>behind Charter Schools is what I agree<br>with is that the person who knows best<br>what a child needs is their teacher or<br>or themselves and and their parents um<br>I think that<br>we need<br>to account<br>for the child's attitude towards school<br>when we're talking about like policy<br>changes that we're making and because if<br>they don't want to engage they're not<br>going to engage like I'm sure there are<br>parents in the room we love to complain<br>teenagers and children love to complain<br>there that's not going to change<br>regardless of how many um workbooks you<br>have in school so we need to I think<br>change children attitudes around school<br>and that comes with real engagement with<br>with young people and and making sure<br>that we are taking those attitudes into<br>consideration and then following on from<br>that in order to do that properly I<br>think that we lack retrospect in a<br>broader sense not just in education with<br>legislation like what helmet was saying<br>about um you know reversing policy<br>changes and constantly being in the<br>cycle of of one government to the next<br>something Chang is it goes back the<br>other way I think it is so it is a so<br>exhausting but B it is so such a waste<br>of of resources it is it is really<br>frustrating to see the country go back<br>and forth on on things like this and um<br>I think that if we used our data<br>effectively and we actually did have<br>retrospect in policym that we were you<br>know had an<br>evidence-based assessment system for<br>policies that we wouldn't end up like<br>this so if I can note the the 2014<br>Charter Schools experiment here that<br>experiment wasted I think<br>it's I say wasted I mean it spent about<br>$50,000 per student in in charter<br>schools um just just to experiment with<br>if they worked or not right that's fine<br>experimentation is good for policy<br>making I I think that it's great to make<br>sure we know what yeah $ 48,4 21 per<br>student which is six times the amount of<br>of Public Funding that we currently have<br>and we're trying<br>again I'm not sure why I think that<br>there's pretty clear evidence to suggest<br>that maybe that funding would be better<br>spent improving the education system<br>that's available to everyone and that<br>everyone is currently in and that we're<br>dealing with the outcomes<br>of and so I think that we get lost<br>behind this idea of ah yes we want to<br>improve teacher autonomy e go<br>like here you go child of schools um<br>rather than you know Pay Teachers more<br>make it a more attractive job have<br>better teachers make school better I<br>feel like it's pretty clear chain of<br>logic um and I think that we that we<br>kind of miss the obvious things a lot I<br>like you<br>know one way think that we would very<br>easily get to a wiser future<br>is the best education system in the<br>world is Finland right the reason that<br>teachers are paid more there isn't just<br>because you know they like they ask for<br>it and then whoopy do it's because the<br>attitude towards teaching as a career is<br>very very different it's a very esteemed<br>career it's very difficult to get into<br>and obviously that that change took a<br>long time and I'm not saying that we<br>should make teaching harder to to get<br>into now but teachers are very very<br>respected in Finland and you know almost<br>as respected as doctors because it's<br>recognized there that it is one of the<br>most important jobs in society and I<br>think that New Zealand lacks that a lot<br>um my teachers have been as important as<br>my parents in in bringing me up it is so<br>important that we we pay teachers a wage<br>a salary that reflects their work and<br>their um their work and their their<br>stamina as well because we talk so much<br>about you<br>know brain brain drain and and and you<br>know people moving to Australia and Etc<br>and oh it's such a shame oh what do we<br>whatever are we going to do right but<br>like one of the biggest sectors where we<br>lack labor is is teaching and there is<br>such an easy way to fix that which is<br>just pay them more and make it a more<br>attractive career because no one with<br>higher education in mathematics is going<br>to go into a teaching career in<br>mathematics if their cap salary is is<br>$100,000 because it's just not a it's<br>just not realistic to invest in a higher<br>education and then go into High School<br>teaching even<br>though we need good Math teachers with<br>mathematics backgrounds<br>and you know and there's a really clear<br>way to do that so I think that we kind<br>of have missed that step of the equation<br>and it would be really good to go back<br>and fix it but um sorry how long do I<br>have rambling a<br>okay<br>finally I do think that we have to be<br>mindful of young people in<br>decision-making and societal development<br>economic development of course I've said<br>that already but<br>um I've worked with a lot of Junior<br>students this year on the there's these<br>new exams called the co-requisites in<br>year 11 and there's been a lot of fuss<br>about them and our school's very lucky<br>we have good outcomes with them but I<br>sat down with them all I was tutoring or<br>I was or I was you know running a<br>workshop or something and they all had<br>very strong opinions about the testing<br>system and you know very important<br>opinions and things that the ministry<br>should should probably be hearing and I<br>think that if there's one takeaway you<br>have from this it's go into a school sit<br>down with a child and ask them<br>to<br>complain and you will hear a lot of very<br>enlightening things and a lot of very<br>good advice for legislators<br>so well thank you all we've got lots of<br>food for thought here I not sure I can<br>even um summarize effectively before we<br>open it up for some some questions um I<br>suppose it does all boil down<br>to how we<br>organize maybe not just a learning<br>democracy but a learning<br>society and<br>the loud voices within that yeah so<br>anyway I'll open it up for questions the<br>floor don't have a question or an<br>observation<br>or um thank you for your<br>presentation I think for a wiser future<br>everything begins family like the Early<br>Child Hope development is important the<br>proper care from the parent the guardian<br>in raising the child giving the child um<br>good food U good environment send a<br>child to school to study and to learn<br>education lead to<br>employment and when a job creation in<br>the country you are paying taxes to the<br>government and where this money goes<br>into Public Funding for<br>better Hospital better education better<br>transport better everything thing so in<br>this way support wiser future this is my<br>opinion thank you thanks very make an<br>observation about that so uh and the not<br>too yeah not sure if it's still the case<br>but it was in not too F in past seven<br>workers for every uh retired person uh<br>uh before 2050 My Man shows me right<br>I'll be two workers for every retired<br>person um so who's paying for what<br>F this is a this is a reality de that's<br>the Democratic Cliff I was referring to<br>now all of us gr here no here who are<br>going to be in that super um Community<br>you know work our lies list to the<br>Mantra of pedo superannuation and health<br>and um I saw an analysis the other day<br>Corp says that within I think it's 20<br>years 100% of our um tax take will be<br>spent just on superannuation and health<br>100% so there's nothing left for<br>anything else is very real issues for<br>now know where to go with it we're the<br>only ones that pay so we have to think<br>very clearly<br>about uh how it is we are going to<br>generate the uh economic<br>wealth uh and the question of<br>enough you know and we may need to visit<br>some of the<br>assumptions about what's<br>fear um and um have less um Reliance on<br>um some of the things we can't rely on<br>up I like to question<br>this um and I'd like to start by asking<br>um our to students from Wellington girls<br>college I had the pleasure of teaching<br>economics there by the way for two years<br>and I just loved the place um but why is<br>it that the fact that people are getting<br>old is regarded as a<br>cost<br>um I there's a A New Concept called<br>liquid aging and it starts with the idea<br>that U used to be that I mean I can<br>remember when I thought 30 was old<br>probably do two things 30s<br>old and then it was 64 that was old um<br>and uh and I think even the Beatles<br>would some of the Beatles would agree<br>the 64 and when they got there it wasn't<br>quite as old as they thought it was um<br>you<br>know there's a role that F going back to<br>the family and the wise um ideas and<br>going back to uh the way I believe Mali<br>organized themselves prior to<br>colonization um we worked on the concept<br>of families having a role throughout<br>their lifetime and having importance and<br>significance and I think if we started<br>thinking about aging in a different way<br>in New Zealand um you know just for a<br>start if you want more babies um I think<br>we need grandparents um and valuing as<br>well as the role of teachers valuing the<br>wisdom and the role of grandparents<br>would be a good start we need more<br>caregivers and valuing that role would<br>also be a start um and uh finally I<br>think a lot of us uh still have even<br>without gray hair still have a lot of<br>brains um and we can still make a<br>commitment to work so um just like<br>comments from um this ofie on that topic<br>aging um it's a good it's a good it's a<br>good thought thank you it's um<br>it's it's something I've been thinking<br>about a lot recently actually because<br>well the Aging population in um rather<br>than 30 being old I don't think 30 is<br>old just to be clear um because I've<br>been trying to choose a degree to study<br>at University and it it it does get you<br>thinking what career is going to be<br>sustainable for me into the future as<br>there are fewer and fewer people that<br>that come as as that come to the work<br>for<br>um as as graduates and as as the birth<br>rate declines right because I'm trying<br>to think about you know okay<br>actually this Workforce is going to get<br>older and older how am I going to enter<br>it what is going to be best um and<br>obviously that topic includes at what<br>age what what age is too too old to be<br>working anymore or how how should we<br>Define the age of retirement and and<br>stuff like that and<br>um I think it's interesting that you<br>mentioned teachers because one of<br>the most important things about being a<br>teacher is that you have lived<br>experience to pass on to your students<br>and it's like what helmet was saying<br>about passing on um intergenerational<br>information and and sort of stories and<br>wisdom is I think if we valued<br>roles that<br>are you know roles like teachers more<br>and<br>and like caregivers that we would move<br>away from the idea that being that that<br>that aging makes<br>your makes makes your productivity<br>decline or your ability to work decline<br>because there are obviously roles where<br>aging you know you know makes you<br>physically unable to do your work or or<br>makes you you know too too tired to<br>attend the the whole day of work that<br>you're required to do right but if we<br>moved away I think from such<br>a such a heavy emphasis on on a<br>corporate lifestyle or a um sort of like<br>9 to-5 sort of<br>um desk desk<br>job centered e economy or centered um<br>sort of sort of societal Focus then I<br>think we would see a shift in attitudes<br>towards aging um you know and even with<br>digitalization right the the jobs that<br>are least likely to be more efficiently<br>done by AI are those that can be done by<br>any age it's it's teaching it's it's you<br>know it's it's caregiving it's it's it's<br>being it's ning Etc and so I think that<br>that's something really interesting to<br>think<br>about yeah<br>sure um oh should<br>we okay so I I definitely got something<br>to say about there so there it's an<br>unavoidable that there's like<br>correlation with our our age with cost<br>on health just happens especially as you<br>get gets exponential close you get to 80<br>and then the last two years of life well<br>that's where the cruise um most<br>concentrated but but that's just a fact<br>there's nothing to ring your hands about<br>that that just as that's a biological<br>reality so if if so that's a cost right<br>um the second observation I guess is uh<br>more important one the illusion that<br>you've made thinking to the to the<br>non-economic frame on value really um<br>even if you stick with an economic frame<br>the invisibility of the uh contribution<br>that is made you know uh and not taken<br>into the into the calculation of GDP of<br>all of the unpaid you know work and so<br>forth even moving away from the economic<br>frame that the you know the value that<br>occurs to us individually and<br>collectively of the the U roles that we<br>play as we move through our life cycle<br>here um increasingly in Western Society<br>those have been<br>minimized um if not negated to a large<br>extent and that's a gap that's a mistake<br>and so I agree with you that in fact uh<br>in traditional indigenous communities<br>the retention and value of of the roles<br>of our of our K and so forth is is<br>something to renew uh bless the lives of<br>blesses the lives of everybody in that<br>Circle the last observation I just make<br>is that um you know I'm I'm slow to um<br>you know um um Champion the idea of uh<br>uh having to continue to work you know<br>till you drop um thank you very much um<br>you know in China because of their<br>demographic Cliff they are increasingly<br>relying on people Beyond normal age of<br>uh to to to keep you know their nose at<br>the if people are are healthy and<br>willing and ulated with their<br>professional Endeavors go hard you know<br>all power to you but but but um again<br>the truth of the matter is is that that<br>won't be everybody's reality for a range<br>of reasons and we still are facing a a<br>Workforce crunch um so anyway that's a<br>postive reflection on the the range of<br>yeah of course you're you're absolutely<br>right people start using more medication<br>ATI and interventions as they age um<br>however the most expensive part is the<br>last two years five and the second most<br>expensive time in our health system is<br>Residential Care um so if we could do<br>more of that at home and continue uh to<br>Value caregivers we could save money<br>there and Sly the other most expensive<br>health care cost is child um having<br>children is that maternity care of this<br>is um my own study with um the<br>assistance of leg hook at stat New<br>Zealand um but where what what the real<br>issue real answer I wanted to give to<br>your question is I totally agree with<br>your point that someone who is going to<br>work for 8 to 10 hours a day building a<br>house reaches a point where that is no<br>longer physically<br>possible however um if they continue to<br>become a handyman or something which is<br>physically possible<br>they get the health and well-being of<br>the of the uh human connections which<br>means they're less likely to need<br>medical intervention they're less likely<br>to end up in residential care um and and<br>they and our costs don't grow it'll<br>happen um and thank goodness it will<br>happen the challenges at the moment is<br>that the intellectuals the wise people<br>are all saying you and shabil and um<br>Dominic Stevens all all saying we've got<br>this frightening aging Cliff coming up<br>and I think the wise thing needs to be<br>saying we're human beings how can we<br>make the most of all of our people and I<br>think that's what you're saying yeah<br>let's<br>feel so we've got L and then<br>Bri the last<br>two we time's run away with us it does<br>can I first comment on on how's<br>generational thing you know the<br>generation of men and women that went<br>through the depression and the Second<br>World War<br>created the society that we lived in in<br>the 50s 60s and70s they created the<br>wealthy State built the dams ran<br>families that actually they devoted<br>their lives to having my generation<br>which was one of their children really<br>weed nothing at all of that substance<br>and and nor can I say course and and I<br>think what we're relying on now is this<br>generation that has got facing up<br>pressures of environment of probably the<br>first generation that's going to<br>generally be poorer than its<br>predecessors and so in a way they may be<br>the first Generations can I just a<br>couple bits on babies U just after I was<br>B we had about 60,000 babies a year and<br>a 2 million<br>population in 20 years time 30 years<br>time we'll still have according to that<br>government satis who I hope to trust um<br>we still have 60,000 babies a year but<br>6,000 6 million population so each baby<br>now the opportunity cost of failing to<br>develop and give it a good chance as<br>much hard I could have fallen off the<br>way and it wouldn't have made a hell of<br>a lot of difference to the world but it<br>makes a lot of difference now I think we<br>come back to suzan's point 45% of<br>population growth in the next 20 years<br>is people 75 and over and really we have<br>to come back to some basics for example<br>why do we have a retirement age partly<br>because New Deal in the 1930s in the<br>United States Roosevelt wanted to create<br>jobs for young people so we decided<br>people should retire at 60 and we have<br>to realize that the retire<br>age as a fiction is a figment of Po<br>policy like Suzanne and I we were born<br>shall I say quite a long time ago and we<br>still around we're we're doing and still<br>able to be a nuisance we have the<br>highest apart from the U UK us working<br>AE number of Sher of population 65 75 in<br>the workforce and it seems to me as our<br>health<br>improves we could be totally rethinking<br>our nature of retirement and retirement<br>provision without going back to a<br>demeaning means tested regime for<br>retired people if we educate the<br>generation that's there more<br>consistently and coherent their<br>productivity will be will be better and<br>can I ask them one question you go to an<br>elite school really what are you doing<br>to think about the quality of Education<br>across other schools my final comment is<br>I've talk to a mass professor once and<br>he said you know if you're at a top<br>desile school every science lesson is<br>taught by a science graduate if you're<br>at a bottom the asy school you're<br>bloodly lucky to have half the lessons<br>taught by a science graduate what are we<br>doing to provide those sort of<br>opportunities and even more what are we<br>doing to discover<br>that just a cheeky comment we'll move to<br>Brig CU we're a bit tight for time so uh<br>I agree with you absolutely about um our<br>school I feel very lucky to be at school<br>that I'm at um I've received such a<br>fantastic education um I think in part<br>it's difficult for us to stand up to the<br>Des house system but um I mean in a in a<br>small way we were also at our protest at<br>Parliament it sort of stood stood as a<br>as a standing up for all of the schools<br>across the country regardless of this St<br>um who have had terrible um issues with<br>property as well so things like that<br>that's not exactly um education but just<br>standing up for those schools as well<br>cuz I mean regardless of this how we<br>were in a similar situation I don't<br>know um no generally agree with Millie I<br>think it is hard when you are a student<br>yourself to really get anyone to listen<br>to you but thank you for coming today um<br>but<br>uh I do care deeply about the equity of<br>the education system in this in this<br>country and I I I do wish there were<br>more ways for me<br>to connect with the realities of other<br>new zealanders other New Zealand young<br>people that don't have the opportunities<br>that I do and<br>I try my best<br>to within my own School make sure that<br>we bring<br>up those who you know um I do a lot of<br>work with kids with learning stability<br>and we our P drink system is free so we<br>are trying to create equity in our own<br>school and hopefully by the time I'm<br>older and I can vote and um etc etc I<br>will be we all will be able to do that<br>work to make sure that there's there's<br>more equity in the<br>system so final comment<br>Brig oops I hope I it I really like um<br>you know that overarching vision of<br>yours helmet about the learning<br>democracy because I think if we don't<br>put that into action we're going to have<br>real problems especially with the uh<br>distribution of our population because<br>the old people will also decide about<br>our future because of if we have that<br>distribution it's going to be extremely<br>difficult for young people to have their<br>say and so I think should there even be<br>an age where we should not be allowed to<br>vot anymore that's of course Devil's<br>Advocate but on the other being devil<br>educate if we don't have a learning<br>democracy and a really sound education<br>system we will look at things that<br>happened in Austria and in East Germany<br>it's last European election where the 16<br>to 19y Old voted fascist<br>55% so this is the future we were<br>looking to when if we don't have a sound<br>democracy in the Learning System I think<br>we have some really enormous challenges<br>um I wish I could say something more a<br>nice okay allow us to run over time it's<br>just been such a fascinating discussion<br>so I just want to take the opportunity<br>to thank everyone for for coming to this<br>morning and to the other two sessions in<br>the series and a big big thank you to<br>helmet to Millie and to Teresa for a<br>really um stimulating discussion this<br>morning with<br>we have recorded these three greatest<br>sessions and um we will make them<br>available to you um and I'll probably<br>also in the email when we send the link<br>out I'll um also ask you if there are<br>any topics that you'd like to see in a<br>in a de series breakfast session next<br>year um open to suggestions I think<br>there's a few possibilities coming out<br>of the discussions that we' we've been<br>having here um and I wanted to do a plug<br>the house of um Brig bernish Bri who is<br>the um the director of the um Stout<br>Research Center for New Zealand studies<br>um they have a conference on the 21st to<br>the 23rd of November this year on<br>poverty by Design addressing systemic<br>causes of poverty and options for change<br>uh in New Zealand and helmet I think<br>your organization is one of the sponsors<br>of yes look I'm going to be swanning off<br>to Vietnam for my 40th anniversary so<br>apologies for missing it I uh I really<br>am disappointed to this but so we have<br>some fers for that conference which will<br>be um outside if anyone's interested in<br>yeah just saying everyone is um invited<br>to register it's not just for academics</p></main><footer style="margin-top: 2rem;
