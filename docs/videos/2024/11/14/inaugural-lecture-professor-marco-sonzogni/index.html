Smith and I<br>have the huge privilege of being the<br>vice Chancellor here at toing Walker<br>Victoria University of Wellington and<br>tonight is one one of those nights where<br>that privilege is very much alive and<br>well because I have the opportunity to<br>welcome friends family academic<br>professional colleagues and our wider<br>Community to attend the inaugural<br>lecture of Marco sonzogni professor of<br>translation studies in the school of<br>languages and cultures um Marco as<br>everybody who knows him uh has an<br>enormous passion uh and uh I've I've<br>since learned uh as part of this that<br>this passion stems all the way back from<br>his upbringing where he was surrounded<br>by diverse languages and cultures he<br>haes from a small farming Village in<br>Northern Italy situated between the Sea<br>and the Alps and he Likens his life to a<br>journey of on a walker or translation<br>which has taken him across the globe and<br>eventually to New Zealand a place he now<br>considers home and when he first arrived<br>on these Shores all the way back in<br>2004 he tells me that he accepted the<br>job instantly before he told anybody<br>including his family and his mother's<br>response that sounds like a place that's<br>so far away it must be the last place<br>that has people on Earth but the people<br>who he has found and the people who he<br>has inspired uh and the people who have<br>benefited from this enormous expertise<br>are many not just in this University but<br>in this society and in the globe as a<br>whole that is important not only because<br>of the value that he's added but because<br>of the way and the narrative that it<br>fits within this institution to Head<br>anger Walker refers to our Mariah and<br>means the moing place of Walker the<br>moing place of canoe and like Marco<br>people from around the world have come<br>here to Moore their Walker and join our<br>community uh for Marco himself his<br>academic Journey started at the<br>University of Pavia in Italy where he<br>earned a ba in foreign languages and<br>literature he holds an MA in an Anglo<br>Irish literature and drama and a PhD in<br>Italian Studies from the University<br>College Dublin but it didn't stop there<br>he also has an MA in literary and<br>translation studies from this University<br>and an mlit in Translation studies from<br>Oakland with those<br>qualifications that has butus a career<br>which has resulted in his uh enormous<br>impact in in research he's a highly<br>respected academic who has acquired<br>numerous Awards and honors in 2023 he<br>was named an officer of the order of<br>Merit by the Italian government for his<br>contributions to Italian language<br>literature and culture he also serves as<br>panel chair in mass communication for<br>the global undergraduate award<br>celebrating top essays across the planet<br>and he's received Italy's prestigious<br>literary translation prize the montal<br>literary prize Professor Sone holds<br>numerous external engagement positions<br>including cultural advis advisor to both<br>the embassy of Italy and the embassy of<br>Ireland New Zealand and academic staff<br>and teaching partnership with the<br>University of<br>Xiang but as he says in his own words<br>the most rewarding part of his career to<br>date and it has many Waters and many<br>paddle Strokes of his walker yet to go<br>is his interaction with his students the<br>responsibility and the joy of<br>contributing to their lives and<br>supporting their intellectual and<br>emotional growth he has done this in<br>many environments and many people here<br>will have seen that in practice but he<br>also brings the kind of humility to<br>acknowledge as we've just been talking<br>about that during Co that was<br>challenging he tells me of opening up<br>his computer getting ready to deliver<br>his lecture online to uh large numbers<br>of students and after speaking for a<br>while and nobody responding he said can<br>you hear<br>me there was apparently a voice out the<br>back which said unfortunately yes I can<br>I'm told that person is in the audience<br>today so it must have been worthwhile in<br>the long term because he's come back to<br>hear Marco for at least a second<br>probably a third fourth and fifth time<br>but Marco believes that being a teacher<br>is about enabling others and what he<br>sees is the core mission of uh as an<br>educator and as part of a university<br>citizen to manage all of this and this<br>is another unique and defining principle<br>of<br>Marco uh is that it's an extraordinary<br>amount of work that he does and managing<br>that workload is somewhat of a Marvel to<br>all of his colleagues me included but he<br>readily admits that he's a<br>self-confessed and Unapologetic<br>workaholic although outside work you<br>will find him doing other things reading<br>anything from medical literature to<br>cookbooks or histo historical<br>biographies exploring cities on foot<br>which he believes is the best way to<br>truly understand place and its people<br>and enjoying classical music having<br>studied what seems like a Trilogy of<br>Trilogy of keyboards the piano the organ<br>and the harps Accord for many years his<br>lecture tonight between the lines my<br>life and translation he will share some<br>of the stepping stones from his personal<br>and professional Journey he will do this<br>by reflecting on the past present and<br>future of translation and why he agrees<br>with the Argentine intellectual writer<br>George Lewis gge who regarded<br>translation<br>as the more advanced stage of<br>civilization Marco thank you on behalf<br>of this University for bringing the ways<br>in which you have advanced all of our<br>civilization we are very much looking<br>forward to your lecture and it's my<br>great pleasure to now introduce<br>elct K good evening everybody uh the two<br>jokes I had have been used already so<br>anyways uh it's a huge honor to be to be<br>here with you all tonight and<br>uh yes it is true uh the student who<br>said uh can you hear me unfortunately<br>yes is in the audience and I can assure<br>you that his grades were unaffected H<br>not not only that but apparently he has<br>a a Victoria doctoral scholarship for<br>his PhD so uh anyway<br>um I come from a family of farmers and<br>teachers and that means essentially two<br>things that you are allowed to look up<br>in the<br>sky on condition that you keep your feet<br>on the ground and tonight I'm sharing<br>some of that uh some of that Journey a<br>part of that Journey but I want to do<br>that uh remembering two moments to the<br>very early moments at this University<br>when my little Wakka uh got accepted and<br>moured at this beautiful place<br>um I was welcom on the marai by the late<br>pish<br>Shasha<br>and when our nose touched he<br>whispered<br>Benvenuto speaking<br>uh half of the language and half of the<br>culture in him and shortly after that on<br>another occasion on the<br>marai um I saw theoi rnia and Kura who<br>was studying Italian at the time and it<br>was clear to me that beautiful uh Mari<br>saying that we look back to look forward<br>and that's what I'm going to do tonight<br>so you have to bear with me I'm going to<br>take you a little journey what has uh<br>contributed to making me the person and<br>the academic and the teacher that I am H<br>I will share a case study in Translation<br>because after all this is a lecture on<br>in Translation study<br>and then uh I will end with uh what I<br>call oaces with wishes and I think you<br>have a handout that I put in an envelope<br>for you as well as a bookmark and I want<br>to take this opportunity to thank my<br>friend and colleague Sydney shef for<br>Designing that beautiful uh bookmark the<br>illustration uh s looks like a bit<br>between the lines it's to WKA and it's a<br>piece of artwork in our a wonderful<br>collection here at the<br>University so uh things went wrong uh<br>very early uh that's a a premature<br>encounter with a book that's a Latin<br>grammar as my mother taught Latin and uh<br>I remember to this day uh some page 10<br>or 11 of that book The Beautiful opening<br>line of n ARA wuno which of course my<br>mom could go on and on and quote and uh<br>and there's a toy dog there um but<br>that's a a Sy I think a symbolic picture<br>I got exposed to language a acoustically<br>I could hear my grandparents maternal<br>grandparents speaking dialect I could<br>hear my father speaking dialect and then<br>I heard my mother uh reciting getting<br>ready for school in Latin and<br>occasionally in Greek and then on top of<br>that uh there was church Latin so when<br>you're small and you're little and you<br>want to sleep and you have your mother<br>on one side that goes on and on and on<br>with the Latin and the scansion in the<br>meter and you hear you can't fall asleep<br>when that finally ends then my father<br>started his lanis and Church Life<br>but that unsto the sense of beauty and<br>language is place and language is sound<br>and that became my skin so there's a<br>number of uh wakers here um you can see<br>them the one when I'm little that's a<br>little uh that's a river that I grew up<br>by and then when I moved to uh<br>University I had to choose between<br>English and Russian and uh I chose the<br>language that I thought I knew a little<br>bit better and that was English so I<br>moved to Ireland but that's a wonderful<br>example of a Siberian Waka and then in<br>the middle you see all those beautiful<br>work is that you recognize being our New<br>Zealand's<br>uh wonderful uh safety<br>video and I thought how beautiful um in<br>2013 2014<br>um I had an instance of what doctors<br>called pulmonary embolism not one not<br>not two not three three blood clots<br>um went on a journey inside my body uh<br>station in my heart for uh luckily uh<br>very little time and then Mo themselves<br>in my lungs and I remember one of the<br>nurse came and said be patient uh the<br>doctors will come and explain to you<br>what palmary embolism mean and I said oh<br>Jesus I said said I can explain it to<br>you if you like and I went on and on for<br>about 20 minutes explaining that<br>pulmonar lungs and but em history of the<br>world and then I realized that whoever<br>was sitting in the bed beside me got the<br>Fright of his life he said what was that<br>um anyway we're both still here and we<br>move on and that's our Mariah which I<br>always looked at when I when I was<br>inside and I looked up it looked like<br>the Keel of of a boat of a ship upside<br>down and so taaka rangi the flying canoe<br>which is the way Mari call a plane uh<br>for someone who to cross the world uh by<br>land by water and by air seemed very<br>appropriate and then there's a beautiful<br>image from my colleague nalani Who hats<br>from Hawaii that's her own drawing of<br>awaka and then um there's a Chinese<br>scroll that I love very much um for my<br>recent um Journey uh in China and some<br>sort of very weird and scary uh response<br>from artificial intelligence when I put<br>in Airship wangi out New Zealand that's<br>what I was<br>given before I continue my journey I<br>just want to acknowledge those who have<br>made this journey possible<br>um representatives from the embassy of<br>Italy you are here gra representatives<br>from the embassy of Ireland gar Mah and<br>representatives from the embassy of<br>China a very well welcome I'm going to<br>do it F<br>chanier thank you very much um and of<br>course my thanks to uh some familiar<br>faces that were here 20 years ago uh<br>thank you for your support for your<br>patience and for your inspiration I<br>would not be here today without this<br>amazing uh<br>support I'm going to move up quickly<br>because I know that life goes on and you<br>don't want to be here all night so a<br>snapshot that's the city where I was<br>born um Prof professing is about<br>believing yeah you profess the faith you<br>go you check out the etimology so um I<br>was born in the hospital in that City<br>and you will see why there's a goose<br>there um my neighbor my grandfather my<br>grandmother's favorite uh friend closest<br>friend my neighbor was a midwife a<br>village with M known as lady Tina she<br>delivered my mother and on the evening<br>of June the 6th she stormed into my<br>house and said to my mother do not go to<br>work tomorrow your Waters will break<br>your child will be born and it will be a<br>beautiful<br>gold so my parents paid the slight of<br>notice my mother did go to work Waters<br>did break in the middle of what in<br>Italian is called scrutin when<br>moderation Mar moderation she made it to<br>a hospital and sadly 50% of Lady Tina's<br>prediction was incorrect uh but she<br>professed her faith with such courage at<br>14 months later she did it again uh this<br>time she said and a beautiful boy will<br>be born and then my brother was born um<br>I mentioned my parents because both my<br>mother and my father and my brother<br>teachers in the humanities and in The<br>Sciences remain to me unsurpassed<br>models now that's the landscape You'<br>find at this time of the year and in<br>Italy the fields that shape me um I'm a<br>farmer's grandson after all and then the<br>beautiful sunset in Moscow what happens<br>in the world today pains me because of<br>the beautiful people I met in Russia the<br>beautiful language the culture and<br>before I could study and read the Poetry<br>of akova or Pushkin or the novels of<br>doeski and tto it was rachmaninov's<br>Liturgy of St John's costus that hooked<br>me into<br>Russian and that<br>beautiful the beautiful reassuring<br>energetic sentence as it was in the<br>beginning it is now and ever shall<br>beum<br>at then you have Dublin and uh I put<br>inishmore here the one of the uh Aron<br>Islands uh where I isolated myself for<br>two months learning<br>Irish grounding myself my second level<br>of indigen first the dialect and then<br>Irish<br>I was also lucky to put my translation<br>and interpreting skill at the service of<br>the peace process in Northern Ireland<br>where I could see evil and I could see<br>grace and I could see luck and I said to<br>my friends when I saw evil in the face<br>and Northern Ireland and I saw it again<br>in Kosovo where I tried to practice my<br>little knowledge of Flav languages that<br>evil did not look like artificial<br>intelligence it was human evil<br>and then of course white hangi when I<br>managed to go too late unfortunately but<br>I did go there grounding and in the<br>indigen number three that beautiful<br>sunset there and then my passion for and<br>my interesting translation grew out of<br>uh if it's difficult to translate or<br>interpret human words what about the<br>word of God and so I went to the holy<br>city of brindavan to study Sanskrit and<br>one of my future project involves<br>comparing different translation of the<br>bhavita I was training with monks<br>learning to become accepted to the<br>orders of<br>diksha and to the O order of<br>Sasa and again getting up early in the<br>morning the way that I did it in the<br>monasteries in Russia the way that I did<br>it in the monasteries in Ireland to hear<br>language place and sound become one and<br>finally<br>Hano when I thought about a title for<br>this lecture I said from home to Hano<br>Marco poo style said you can't do that<br>you can't do that but in a way if not<br>the first the second book I read as a<br>child was Marco<br>Poo's travel diary call it as you<br>like where he talks about the city as<br>Heavenly<br>Hanjo so when I went there for the first<br>time last<br>year after after convincing my mother to<br>join weat which she did was I said sorry<br>mother um there's another place for<br>sorry this is what we discussed at time<br>said there's another place for my ashes<br>to be<br>spread certainly the fields where we<br>grow rise<br>certainly beautiful landscape and County<br>SLO in<br>Ireland where one of my closest friend<br>and college friends is now<br>buried certainly out around New Zealand<br>and certainly West<br>Lake and then was my time around the<br>west lake with uh my non-existing<br>Chinese but with an antology of Chinese<br>poetry that I discovered a poem written<br>by a very distinguished Chinese poet a<br>poem that was written when this poet was<br>seven a poem about an<br>animal uh as you can see the town was<br>born we celebrate we honor we rever<br>the goose we grow it we uh groom it and<br>apologies if there are any vegetarians<br>in the room we eat it um and so from<br>Goose to Goose and you're going to look<br>at the side of my work in Translation in<br>a minute but before I do that I think I<br>have a little surprise for you I think<br>it would be nice if we could hear this<br>beautiful poem in the language it was<br>written and you're going to hear it from<br>y I'm going to read the first line which<br>uh yan yan works ataaka and she also<br>taught at the communication University<br>of Zang with me last year for all your<br>linguistic and cultural education and<br>you've heard Hazel um which I<br>italianized into Nutella and youve heard<br>uh Luca rigorously with a c and not with<br>a K and Elanor these are three students<br>from the communication University of<br>Zang that have come to finish their<br>studies that are mouring their wakas<br>with us it's a great great pleasure to<br>have you here now um I don't speak<br>Chinese but I decided to entrust uh some<br>uh more elevated form of intelligence be<br>it artificial or human to give me a<br>little sense of what the poem is about<br>and there was no uh hesitation that I<br>should give it a go when I uh<br>encountered the goose I heard it before<br>I saw it Ling Wang was asked to write a<br>poem as7 imagine someone comes around<br>and say look that's goes right upon and<br>so that<br>uh had to<br>be it had to be and of course qu qua<br>there it is I'm not going to go into the<br>translations but I got carried away with<br>this literation as you can see all says<br>the p paddlers is what you get in<br>crosswords and it applies to Ducks swans<br>and a goose if you like but I've<br>highlighted the word in my Italian one<br>because that's actually if somebody gave<br>me that as a translation in a trans<br>literally translation class would I<br>capacitor or not that's a bit too much<br>for a a child writing about a goose but<br>I have uh filled my translation with<br>everything that I learned from the<br>sounds of Irish the sounds of Russian<br>the sounds of Sanskrit the sounds of<br>Chinese and the sounds of Italian and we<br>I debated a long time about that K the<br>Chinese has word for green it's green<br>water and my stonch uh country boy I've<br>never seen green water I mean there's<br>grass inside on the on the on the bed of<br>the T but of course uh it could be the<br>vegetation mirroring and so I decided to<br>go for Kar which is the foundational<br>poetry one of the things that I uh makes<br>me get up in the morning and give the<br>everything I have For Better or For<br>Worse in my system is to work with<br>students um<br>when I started studying the history of<br>translation studies uh a number of<br>places were mentioned two in particular<br>two house of<br>wisdom the house of translation in<br>Baghdad but a lot of knowledge got<br>translated into Arabic and from Arabic<br>moved to closer to Europe and the house<br>of translation in Toledo and Spain where<br>everything got translated into uh into<br>Latin and then into the languages that<br>were beginning to surface and thinking<br>about the house of translation in Toledo<br>and thinking about Waka I'm going to uh<br>read a kakia uh which is um I'm going to<br>read it because I don't want to uh cause<br>any disrespect by misquoting it I want<br>to read this waka this karakia uh as a a<br>gift of thoughts and prayer to my<br>colleagues in Translation in Valencia<br>and other parts of Spain who are<br>suffering because of calam<br>this kakia is part of a longer text uh a<br>longer uh Kaka in fact um You probably<br>some of you know it and I'm going to<br>read it as a reminder that we have to<br>work with the planet and as a reminder<br>that the answers that we look for the<br>T marora sees the wind from the West<br>sees the wind from the south let the<br>breeze blow over the land let the breeze<br>blow over the ocean let the r TI Dawn<br>come with a sharpened hair a touch of<br>frost a promise of a glorious<br>day this is my house of translation<br>these are students that have come to do<br>their PHD in Translation studies and<br>have decided to give their gifts and<br>their time and share it with me um let's<br>not talk about<br>workload about what this all means but<br>they come from every part of the planet<br>and those The Echoes of those sounds of<br>translation the first house of<br>translation my own house with my parents<br>and my grandparents speaking languages a<br>house of Baghdad the house of Toledo<br>I've been very lucky the last 20 years<br>to build my own house of translation at<br>this University there's a lot of work to<br>do all this uh thesis are anything you<br>can think of translation and Mathematics<br>translation and the law translation and<br>the environment translation and<br>subtitling translation and dubbing<br>translation and artificial<br>intelligence translation and chemistry<br>translation and gaming I don't want to<br>leave anybody out because that's the<br>nature of translation translation is<br>everything the other title I thought for<br>this lecture was translation is<br>everything but there's a video with<br>yours truly in it that that goes around<br>when we try to get students into the BC<br>where I start that video by saying<br>communication is everything and I got a<br>lot of slack for that so I said I can't<br>possibly title the lecture translation<br>is everything but translation is<br>everything translation is language<br>translation is Place translation is<br>culture translation is creativity<br>translation is scholarship translation<br>is<br>lack these are three different different<br>responses that artificial intelligence<br>has given me by putting the word<br>translation in it and I could tell you<br>beautiful stories around it but I won<br>the one story that I will tell you it's<br>actually uh something that we have just<br>started at this University which is<br>evolutionary translation it's a concept<br>we are theorizing at the moment H I have<br>come up with um a sort of Manifesto the<br>uh we will launch the website later<br>again a huge mass thank you Sydney and<br>all the colleagues uh around the<br>university who have helped us uh develop<br>this New Concept and tring it I'm going<br>to read by way of theoretical thinking a<br>couple of things and crack a joke if you<br>allow me I know this is recorded but<br>interpretation entails and the<br>identification entails Contrition<br>entails visibility look at this one what<br>is loose and incomplete comes together<br>by gravity the unfathomable is unfolded<br>the unconceivable is named<br>the translation becomes the original<br>until you read the translation become<br>the original that could be a commentary<br>to the result of the US election but<br>we're not going to go there<br>um there's a lot of work and that work<br>is happening<br>because my Waka as a place to be more<br>that quick snapshot on Project forcoming<br>very quickly yes it's a<br>cockroach Primo leevi translated a uh<br>standards for the creation of a<br>particular filter and cockroaches were<br>used and killed to test that filter and<br>that becomes a metaphor for the<br>Holocaust I'm looking at what prompted<br>primoli to translate that there's no<br>record of it in his papers no record of<br>Standards I'm also hoping to do some<br>work with the Tourette Syndrome<br>Association here in New Zealand the way<br>that I did in Europe to make the life of<br>those afflicted by<br>Tourette um safer by transl little bits<br>about themselves that when they can<br>travel when they can move everyone<br>around them knows what's happening I<br>will look into the different<br>translations of the to understand how<br>elusive spiritual meaning can be within<br>and Beyond the word shus and montal have<br>been part of my life they continue to do<br>so that's a Ste from The Beekeeper I'm<br>translating a Italian Renaissance text<br>on bees so at the moment I'm spending a<br>lot of time reading about bees talking<br>to people that know everything about<br>bees I'll give you an update we're also<br>trying to develop for the first time in<br>this country a centralized<br>portal uh about translation with<br>information to make uh every Community<br>safe uh so rash bloomfi reminded us that<br>after all New Zealand in his View and<br>the view of Scholars is not ready for<br>another pandemic well I think Al can and<br>should be ready for crisis translation<br>too so we are in the process of creating<br>that portal and uh we we're seeking some<br>funding so if you hear any one has was<br>willing to give some money we're going<br>to make that portal happen and it's<br>going to be made by students and it's<br>going to made by Scholars inside this<br>University for the benefit of aroa and<br>benefit of our University uh our our<br>city and the region and of course uh the<br>rest of the world can look at our<br>example and finally susano be you may<br>think what sorry what what that uh what<br>is suzano be doing there one of the most<br>frustrating piece of translation I've<br>had to do is to translate Medical<br>document about a miracle so that the<br>Vatican could agree that suzano can<br>become a saint well one thing I can tell<br>you is that I already know that she is a<br>saint uh and my my thoughts and prayers<br>are with the sister of compassion in<br>Island Bay that have trusted me with<br>that work um sister Su kosgrove um<br>intending to be here she can't be here<br>because she's looking after a a sick<br>sister this is another beautiful story<br>and all my mar friends remember Sister<br>be so let's hope the translation can do<br>the impossible and<br>uh we can have our first New Zealand<br>Saint if that happened remember it<br>happened in this place<br>okay we we we're we're doing our best so<br>the way I travel is by Waka this is a<br>beautiful um drawing by a<br>extraordinarily talented Mar uh<br>illustrator story Hy morous and I<br>thought someone called story has a lot<br>of story to say a lot of story to tell<br>and I'm grateful that she allowed me to<br>use this as my walk my Tera my Tera waka<br>waka and Mya rangi W I'm flying on land<br>and I'm flying on Earth very quickly uh<br>this is a poem it's been part of my<br>study part of the book that I spent the<br>last 10 years working on um it's an<br>original poem I think it's a translation<br>99% of the scholar<br>think it's an original poem I think it's<br>a<br>translation um it's a story that my<br>colleague in Classics have helped me uh<br>on cover it's about a uh the Roman army<br>in Portugal about to cross a river and<br>uh not wanting to because they are told<br>that's the river liy and should they do<br>that they're going to lose their<br>marbles um but of course uh the the<br>general being the leader that he is he<br>steps in into the water crosses the<br>river and says see I remember you all by<br>name and he calls everyone by name I<br>wish that I could thank you all by name<br>and I thought that was a beautiful<br>lecture if I did that thanking you all<br>by name but I need to talk about<br>translation so I had to make the<br>statement that prove that it is in fact<br>translation it wasn't going to happen my<br>colleagues in Classics in this<br>University very generously friends and<br>college and classes around the world we<br>cannot find that detail where the<br>soldier calls the general calls soldiers<br>by<br>name so during lockdown I went around<br>and retrieved uh Shamus steps in<br>Portugal at the time and uh you can see<br>up there a statue in Pon de Lima that's<br>the river Lima in in the European<br>philology the two two meanings one is<br>lame l e i m which means to overflow and<br>another one which is the lame which<br>means to forget so the two Min came<br>together the river is the the river that<br>overflows but it's also the river of<br>Oblivion of Oblivion and of course the<br>locals you can imagine when anyone that<br>thinks is stronger than you that things<br>speaks a better language or things that<br>knows better tries to take over your<br>place um how can you prevent them from<br>doing so so the local spread the rumor<br>don't cross this River or you lose your<br>malos anyway no sign of that I call you<br>by name of soldiers so during lockdown I<br>Retreat step by step what he he did when<br>he was in Portugal and on one night I<br>saw that love I said that be a wonderful<br>hotel to go to but you can see there's a<br>little something in the corner and so I<br>emailed the hotel and I said can you<br>send me a picture of the painting that<br>is up there just in case there something<br>I need to<br>know and uh sure<br>enough that's a<br>painting and the Portuguese the text is<br>in Portuguese and that's where he read<br>the beat about the soldier the general<br>calling each Soldier by name<br>uh how do I know that shini was there<br>well he was there doing a number of<br>things do I know that he read that story<br>yes because one person was there when he<br>talked about the story and that person<br>was Michelle<br>legot poet from New Zealand who happened<br>to be there reading at the same time so<br>when I got hold of the program all the<br>pieces were coming together I went all<br>the way to Portugal but the final key<br>piece was Michelle Le and I emailed her<br>and she replied and said oh yes I was<br>there she said her husband sent me a<br>photo oh yes he did read the story there<br>and he talked about it anyway all this<br>to say that you need a great deal of<br>luck pretty much in any Walk of Life<br>anyway let me wind down to a close so<br>this is shini that reads another poem<br>which is a translation of another story<br>about another place about another Walker<br>a very beautiful Walker and he talks<br>about it is an unforgettable event as a<br>dream truth as imaginative promise and<br>as reliable field that's what I want to<br>be as a academic and as a teacher I want<br>every moment of coming together in this<br>place of Ming Walkers coming together as<br>an unforgettable event I'm actually each<br>day each class is precious um I'm sorry<br>to report that in 20 years of D<br>diversity I haven't Miss touch would I<br>haven't missed one day of work that must<br>be hr's either model employee or the<br>worst nightmare I don't know but anyway<br>dream truth yeah we we dreamed of truths<br>the first time I thought that I would<br>profess anything I had a dream that I<br>would be saving a a schol friend of mine<br>in school from drowning so I woke up and<br>went to school and I said hey I dreamt<br>of you you were drowning and I saved you<br>and he replied to me said can you<br>swim so reality check but we dream<br>truths and we make them become we<br>translate them into reality imaginative<br>promise one thing that I'm most grateful<br>for my time at this University is the<br>allowance to follow imaginative promises<br>and give them the reliable feel that<br>comes with true elastic<br>knowledge so here all my Walkers come<br>together you see a wonderful walk on one<br>side you see a dragon both of the other<br>and a story of<br>collaboration story of a miraculous<br>Unforgettable event a story of literal<br>the story is of the monks being a prayer<br>and seeing a an Airship to walk rangi<br>flying across above them until someone<br>has to come down because the the anchor<br>of the book get stuck in the altar<br>rails and the abot says this man will<br>drown unless we help him and the poem<br>finishes and so they did and the freed<br>ship sailed<br>and the man climb back out of The<br>it so when I look at what we stand<br>for when I look at what we want to do<br>what we look at what we try to do I see<br>connection I see<br>Community I see many Walkers becoming<br>one<br>here's another<br>reminder that alone we can achieve very<br>little but coming together we can do a<br>lot of<br>things coming together we make each<br>other better humans and we make each<br>other better<br>professionals so I want to finish up<br>with uh really two<br>um or one<br>I was thinking about two but this is<br>being recorded and uh the Second Story<br>um would probably get me into trouble so<br>I'll stick to one and finish up with<br>this one the first time that I heard the<br>word<br>Professor I was in the car with my<br>father and my brother and as he went to<br>get gas at the Press station and we went<br>and we got there and the petrol<br>station uh owner senor pansara very<br>nice authored person blue the blue suit<br>completely covered in oil and dirt from<br>fixing cars comes to comes to the car<br>and looks at me and my brother ready for<br>all this and then looks at me my father<br>and says Professor Mario are you going<br>on<br>holiday so I remember going home and<br>said Dad whatever job that is if he<br>means holiday I want to do it<br>um but um as soon as conscience and uh<br>and awareness became more into Focus I<br>could learn what a privileged job that<br>is both my parents taught for 45<br>years science on my father's side<br>Humanities on my mother's<br>side I have a lot of appreciation for my<br>colleagues who teach mathematics and<br>physics and chemistry and biology and<br>engineer every Sunday I would learn<br>names of Latin and names of animals in<br>Latin and name of Latins in Italian and<br>on my mother's side I've already told<br>you Latin and Greek and all the<br>languages are now leaving<br>me so um I think I'm going to end here I<br>want to thank you for uh being here<br>tonight making the time to be here um<br>sorry for spoiling the postelection<br>reading up on things uh I recommend a<br>beautiful Instagram post by uh Helen<br>Clark which I translated into Italian<br>for some of my journalist friends<br>in Italy thank you for having me here<br>thank you for your trust thank you for<br>your patience I think there's a line<br>that I will read if you allow me I think<br>I'm on time yes I will read it it's<br>about the it's about the kakia and it's<br>a joke on me so uh this is what when I<br>was doing my homework about this<br>beautiful<br>K which was actually recited when I did<br>my when I first arrived this is what it<br>says<br>um it's part of a longa kakia telling<br>how the Waka takitimu survived a storm<br>when exploring the coast of South<br>Westland because the Waka was well built<br>and well managed so thank you for<br>helping me<br>becoming much more well-built<br>and with gratitude to all those who<br>tolerate me every day almost always<br>well-managed<br>thank you very<br>much good evening I'm Sarah<br>I'm the dean of the faculty of<br>humanities and social sciences Taha arui<br>and it's my privilege uh this evening to<br>offer the vote of thanks on behalf of us<br>all to Professor Marco s sonon for his<br>inaugural lecture as professor of<br>translation studies at this<br>University this evening Marco has taken<br>us on a fascinating Journey aboard the<br>Walker of translation sharing with us<br>his experience knowled and passion for<br>languages and cultures in all their<br>diversity from a childhood and<br>Adolescence characterized by linguistic<br>and educational diversity through his<br>years as a student and teacher around<br>the world to his significant<br>contributions here at teahing aaka for<br>the last 20 years Marco's inaugural<br>lecture has demonstrated the depth and<br>breadth of the scholarly work over the<br>course of an impressive career to date<br>we frequently talk about the value of<br>interdisciplinarity in Academia how the<br>bringing together of different<br>perspectives helps us shake the<br>Kaleidoscope of our knowledge creation<br>to be able to see patterns in new and<br>informative<br>ways we usually reference<br>multidisciplinary groups each scholar<br>bringing a different perspective to help<br>address a research<br>question however in honoring professor<br>professor Marco sonon tonight tonight we<br>are talking about a single scholar who<br>has himself brought different<br>disciplinary perspectives to bear from<br>Italian Russian and Latin to the<br>languages of Music maths and chemistry<br>from Linguistics and philosophy to<br>medicine from translation theory and<br>practice to the analysis and creation of<br>poetry Marco's work is emblematic of<br>what we mean by<br>interdisciplinarity and work that is<br>positioned at the scholarly creative<br>Nexus Marco's lecture this evening has<br>also reminded us just how multifaceted<br>his work is he is a scholar of<br>literature an expert literary translator<br>an accomplished editor a scholar of<br>Intercultural communication a poet a<br>leading international Authority in the<br>field of poetry translation and I would<br>highlight here his critical Edition and<br>translation of the poems of Sheamus<br>heene a momentous volume that has<br>received significant critical<br>Acclaim Marco is also a researcher who<br>was always at the forfront of new<br>developments in the multi multiple<br>fields in which he works we have heard<br>tonight A little about his Innovative<br>research in evolutionary translation and<br>he's also always interested in the<br>challenges and opportunities for<br>language learning offered by the rise of<br>AI and how this presents opportunities<br>for the development of new pedagogical<br>models<br>I would like to end by talking just a<br>little about the very special qualities<br>that Marco brings to his role at the<br>University apart from being an Engaged<br>and collaborative scholar teacher and<br>practitioner Marco brings a very<br>particular and unique sense of energy<br>and enthusiasm to everything that he<br>does he sees opportunities and seizes<br>them he has a gift for convincing others<br>of the wisdom of new initi iives he is<br>adept at gaining funding and support the<br>relationships that Marco has built<br>within and Beyond the university<br>nationally and internationally are vast<br>and I want to acknowledge the importance<br>of these contributions to engagement to<br>building connections and community and<br>finally as the vice Chancellor mentioned<br>Marco works very very hard so thank you<br>Marco for our very personal inaugural<br>lecture we are enormously appreciative<br>and I want to also offer my personal<br>thanks for everything you've done for<br>our school of languages and cultures and<br>for the broader<br>faculty we're going to shortly uh journe<br>through to the hunter common room uh for<br>Refreshments uh after we've had the<br>closing kakia from Dr Mike Ross but<br>first please join me and again think<br>thanking Professor Marco sonon for an<br>excellent inaugural lecture<br>this closing just to sort of try to<br>capture some of the things that you
