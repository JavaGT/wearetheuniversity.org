It is shaped by the decisions we have made in the past and those we are making now. These choices encompass how we organize our society, structure and manage our economy, determine our investments, and decide whom we value and support. These pivotal decisions hinge on asking—and thoroughly answering—many critical questions.<br><br>The second event in the Dean’s Series, “How do we get to a wealthier future for all?” took place on September 26. Professor Jane Bryson led an insightful discussion featuring Dr. Ganesh Nana (a prominent economist and former Chair of the Productivity Commission), Professor Lisa Marriott from WSBG (expert in Taxation, School of Accounting and Commercial Law), and Reverend Murray Eldridge (Wellington City Missioner and former Chief Executive of Barnardos NZ). The panel explored what it might take to build a fairer New Zealand, addressing the widening gap between those who are wealthy and those struggling to meet basic needs.</p><h2>Transcript</h2><p

the<br>Wellington School of Business and<br>government oriki here at T Victoria<br>University of Wellington and it's um a<br>great pleasure to welcome you here this<br>morning um for the second in our um<br>series of getting to a fairer future for<br>all healthy wealthy and wise and so<br>today we're talking about the wealthy<br>bit how to get to a wealthier future for<br>all whatever that might mean we no<br>doubt uh Spike some debate about that<br>this morning um we've got three<br>wonderful speakers so uh to to talk<br>about getting to a wealthier future for<br>all um first of all we have uh Ganesh<br>Nana who is a high-profile Economist who<br>worked for bur for 22 years and was a<br>former chair of the productivity<br>commission um he also way back was a<br>lecturer<br>here um it's really good to welcome you<br>back Ganesh and we're looking forward to<br>what you have to say uh we also have<br>Professor Lisa Marriot who's professor<br>of Taxation here in the wel School of<br>Business and government<br>um and is a fellow of the charter<br>accounts Australia New<br>Zealand um and has worked in Industry as<br>a financial controller and accountant in<br>the UK and New Zealand um but she's been<br>donkey deep in Academia for the last 15<br>years and um last but not least we have<br>um the Reverend maray<br>edri um as you may well know muray is<br>the Wellington City missioner role he<br>took on in 20 18 um I'd also add he's an<br>Alum of of this faculty and this<br>University so it's really lovely to have<br>you back Mari um and he's worked with<br>Children and Families throughout New<br>Zealand for over 20 years in various<br>roles including as chief executive of um<br>Bernard's New Zealand so I'm hoping we<br>get um some interesting perspectives on<br>getting to a wealthier future for all so<br>the process<br>um will be that uh we have I have two<br>questions I'm posing I will POS the<br>first question and each speaker will get<br>8 minutes or thereabouts depending on my<br>time keeping to to speak about it and<br>then I'll POS a second question and<br>they'll get about 5 minutes and then<br>I'll open it up for General<br>discussion<br>um and I think I have some more slides<br>which I better show you yes so the third<br>in the dean series doing a bit of on<br>selling is uh at the end of October<br>Wednesday the 30th in the morning uh and<br>that's on getting to a wiser future for<br>all so um as you've attended today you<br>will definitely get the um the<br>advertisement of and ability to register<br>for that final session um it has uh<br>speakers um helmet modl the chief<br>executive of Na t um and<br>um Professor Marcus lak Rush who is our<br>chair in complexity science here in the<br>um business school and a third secret<br>speaker that I'm just confirming at the<br>moment but which will be revealed in The<br>Advertiser so hope we see you along at<br>that one<br>too so we'll um we'll kick off with with<br>question so in thinking about how to get<br>to a wealthier future for<br>all the first question I posed and it<br>may be that they don't answer the<br>question it may be they go completely<br>off piece but that's fine but the first<br>question I posed was in your opinion<br>what does a wealthy future for all look<br>like and what are the two or three key<br>challenges to achieving it so we'll<br>whoops okay<br>sound um k um thank you Jane and it's a<br>pleasure to be here and thank you for<br>the invite it's always great to be come<br>back to this August institution although<br>I was way up on that Hill a long long<br>time ago um just uh my name's Ganesh and<br>uh was an economist still an economist<br>was chair of productivity commission and<br>B and all those sorts of stuff but um<br>first generation New Zealand born and BR<br>just up the valley up there um to P who<br>immigrated here from India about 70 odd<br>years<br>ago uh acknowledge Mar<br>T and<br>acknowledge and um<br>tiwa as uh man aeral this here um<br>wealthier future for All Apologies I'm<br>probably going to go academic one of the<br>things is um problem definition so<br>there's some words in there that we got<br>to Define um but first did you all have<br>a good<br>breakfast yeah great awesome good night<br>sleep last night<br>yeah warm dry home roof<br>overhead nice meal night<br>before and you've all got a plan B to do<br>it again tonight You've Got A Plan B if<br>everything falls apart you've got<br>somewhere else you could probably go and<br>put your head down no<br>issues by my definition I would say<br>you're all<br>wealthy you've all got a home to go to<br>you've all got food on the<br>table things go B up you've probably got<br>a plan B with it's your neighbor or<br>your uh brother or uncle or mother or<br>daughter or Aunt or someone out there in<br>the community to latch on to to put food<br>on the table for you and give you a<br>place to sleep and the roof over your<br>head now if we all need a plan B well<br>we're probably going to get all together<br>and go down to the local school and<br>civil defense emergency unit or whatever<br>it might be<br>I would probably say from my<br>perspective that you're all<br>wealthy and to be<br>honest most of us are going to be<br>wealthy into the future on that<br>definition but the first thing is we've<br>got to Define what wealthy means and<br>you'll see from there that I'm not of<br>the interest well I am a little bit<br>interested but I'm not of the person<br>that thinks wealthy is defined by<br>dollars and cents<br>it's defined by those opportunities that<br>we all had to set ourselves up to get us<br>into this position<br>now um and I just go back to my parents<br>uh life in coming here 70 odd years ago<br>and they are now and would admit um that<br>they are way more wealthy than they<br>would ever have<br>dreamed they've had the opportunity so<br>being in business set up a business put<br>their kids through<br>University um we took courses they<br>probably didn't like or didn't approve<br>of but never mind um and their children<br>have have reached goals that they would<br>never have ever dreamed of<br>um I worry though that if they had come<br>here instead of coming here 70 years ago<br>if they' come here say sort of half a<br>century later if they'd come here 50<br>years ago I'm not quite sure that they<br>would have reached that wealth in any<br>way and I'm pretty sure that they would<br>have had lots of difficulty sending<br>their children through to the levels<br>that I have been promised enough to<br>achieve and so I think the the element<br>that I'd focus on in the title when we<br>talking about a wealthy future for all<br>I'm not sure we've got problems with the<br>wealthy problem uh to uh word in that<br>topic it's the last two words that I'd<br>focus on it's the for all that we here<br>in Alo the 21st century have the most<br>difficulty with I would say and I worry<br>and I don't want to go dark but I think<br>we have to be honest with ourselves<br>um I'm not sure we have an appetite for<br>the all the for<br>all one of the challenges I think is do<br>we have an appetite as individuals and a<br>community to<br>honestly um take up that for all<br>conversation we can all argue about<br>wealthy and whether it's the finances or<br>the opportunities or the education or<br>the health and all those sorts of things<br>but it's the for all thing when and I'm<br>not a philosopher but when in our<br>history over the last sort of 30 40 50<br>years have we lost that I would say<br>we've lost but probably subsumed that<br>egalitarian ideal that dare I say my<br>parents came here<br>for cuz I think that's the thing that's<br>missing I don't say it's missing I think<br>it's still there I'm an optimist but<br>somehow we need to resurface it because<br>we get diverted and the we I'll go into<br>probably in that second<br>conversation but um the challenge is<br>very much for us to look at wealthy uh<br>look at wealth from that broad<br>definition and then look at the full all<br>uh the broad definition of wealth and<br>and yes all of those things are helped<br>by having access to Dollars<br>absolutely uh and that's part of the<br>conversation and happy to go down there<br>but uh even if we do go down the<br>Dollar's route it's the for all that's<br>the issue uh in my opinion and as an<br>economist I think one of the biggest<br>challenges for the economics discipline<br>and economists and the way that we all<br>look at that economy is that for all uh<br>we're very good at and this was part of<br>when I learned economics way back here<br>way back whenever and partly for my<br>parents a long time ago and there very<br>um I suppose I might call it primitive<br>but um very low understanding of what<br>the economy meant basically was just<br>growing the pie and we we wouldn't have<br>to worry about how it was divided up<br>because back then as long as we grew the<br>pie we all sort of shared in it and that<br>was my father's philosophy and I sort of<br>Tau that on board and as an economist<br>was all focused on growing the<br>pie I think now as economists end in our<br>economics<br>conversations we've got a talk a lot<br>more about the for all how do we divide<br>up that point because I know as an<br>economist in terms of my training we<br>sort of a little bit energic to that<br>conversation we don't like talking about<br>distribution stuff because that's for<br>someone else to talk about that's not<br>real economics you know economics just<br>just do our employment and give<br>everybody opportunities and uh make sure<br>they've got dollars and then someone<br>else to sort of out that the<br>distribution but<br>unfortunately why get to that second<br>part but I think we get you now got to<br>start talking about that distribution<br>element a lot more openly let's talk<br>about that egalitarian values that most<br>of us I think hold dear but<br>unfortunately it's been subsumed and we<br>would be more honest and open actually<br>yeah it is part of my value set I<br>actually do want to put it in that<br>policy analysis out there um and when<br>we're talking about um<br>distribution uh from an economist<br>perspective I think the to in the RO<br>that we've got to talk openly about is<br>TX that's<br>well nice nice segue very good<br>segue k um and thank you for me as well<br>for the opportunity to come and um and<br>talk to you today um I am going to pick<br>up on a couple of things that that um<br>Gish has said because they they do sort<br>of link to I guess my my perspectives as<br>well<br>Kish you said you didn't want to go dark<br>I I probably am going to I think the<br>minute I hear the word wealth I'm<br>instantly thinking wealth inequality and<br>we we all I'm sure everybody in this<br>room has heard the 10% of households in<br>New Zealand hold 50% of the wealth or 5%<br>of households have 37% of the wealth or<br>but bottom 10% have virtually nothing<br>and<br>um whenever I teach I always make sure<br>that all of my students get inequality<br>in some way or another because it's so<br>important and one of the things I always<br>tell them is when we're looking at<br>wealth<br>inequality there is such an enormous Gap<br>in New Zealand so um income inequality<br>is not so bad wealth inequality is is<br>highly problematic and I tell them that<br>the top quintiles are the top 20% % of<br>households in New Zealand have 184 times<br>the amount of wealth as the bottom<br>quintile 184 times I don't think this is<br>in any way an acceptable level of<br>inequality in a country that as ganesa<br>said used to be very egalitarian now I<br>went back as part of my preparation for<br>this I me back to U not quite as far as<br>you but to the 1972 there was a a royal<br>Commission<br>it was a role Commission on Social<br>Security and one of the things that I<br>really liked about this particular role<br>commission was they were very clear<br>about what what we as a society wanted<br>now the focus was at that time on the<br>benefit system because it was a time<br>when when the numbers were increasing<br>but actually it was also more of a<br>discussion about what we as a society<br>wanted for everyone and where they<br>settled I thought was actually pretty<br>good they settled on belonging and<br>participating that was an acceptable<br>standard and that was defined as<br>everybody being able to meet and mix<br>with other new zealanders as a full<br>member of the community okay it's a<br>pretty okay standard it's not probably<br>what a lot of people might think of as<br>wey but it's a it's a good standard to<br>aim for now at that time what was<br>inadequate it was described as<br>inadequate was subsistence that was<br>maintaining life and health to have<br>access to the essentials of life now<br>we're there now we're at subsistence I<br>think a lot of people are not even at<br>subsistence so you know how did we move<br>from a standard that I think Society was<br>largely in agreement with which is<br>people being able to belong and<br>participate in society uh how did we<br>move from there to subsistence and<br>subsistence only for some um so I I<br>would say one of the things that and<br>it's probably fairly self obvious that<br>if we're looking at a wealthy future for<br>all we have to be thinking about<br>tackling that wealth<br>inequality so the other thing I went and<br>looked at and again uh it it continues<br>from what gisha said is I've been<br>looking at the transfer system so you so<br>tax is what we collect think the<br>transfer system is what we spend and<br>specifically I went and looked at this<br>year's budget actually this year's<br>budget for next year but on all the<br>additional expenditure that we have I'm<br>I'm not talking about the benefit system<br>so I'm not talking about uh the sole<br>parent support or the job Seekers not<br>that it's the additional<br>expenditure that we are making and<br>keeping people at that subsistence level<br>so it was 8.5 billion 8.5 billion and<br>working for families tax credits and<br>various sorts of accommodation<br>assistance and so on so um this is this<br>is something that we didn't have 30<br>years ago 40 years ago we didn't need to<br>have this enormous level of of transfers<br>from people who are for the most part<br>working but actually are still unable to<br>certainly they're not belonging and<br>participating they're they're needing an<br>enormous amount of government support to<br>be at that subsistence level so<br>um these numbers this transfers the<br>additional transfers these are<br>increasing very very quickly 50% in the<br>last 78 years or so and there's no<br>suggestion that this particular uh<br>trajectory is going to decline in any<br>way so how it really manifests itself so<br>we had that really nice high wealth ual<br>report from Inland revenue and treasury<br>last year we know that the the most<br>wealthy are paying lower levels of tax<br>than your average income earner uh so<br>what we're seeing is we're seeing<br>transfers from middle income New Zealand<br>to lower income New Zealand essentially<br>keeping all of those groups down where<br>you've got a group at the top who are<br>not contributing to the same extent and<br>our inequality Gap is getting larger and<br>larger<br>um I might leave that there and pass on<br>all<br>right thank you Lisa Marina Good Morning<br>Sounds every okay and thank you Jane for<br>the invitation to be here I was thinking<br>the last time I studied here was 41<br>years ago so um and Susan and I studied<br>together 41 years ago here we here up<br>the hill like Kadesh was it's lovely to<br>be here this this morning I have the<br>privilege of working with some of the<br>people who are doing life toughest in<br>Wellington they probably won't ever come<br>here um but it's a really interesting<br>thing and to pick up on gara's<br>point I see how hard their lives are but<br>every night I get in my car and I drive<br>home and I go home to a a warm house a<br>warm house and a meal and these people<br>never leave their<br>circumstances so that should be a<br>problem it should be a problem for all<br>of us<br>I saw an article a few weeks ago and it<br>it basically<br>said if scientists found a monkey that<br>existed in a tribe of monkeys who<br>gathered all the bananas together and<br>sat on them while other monkeys starved<br>they would take him out of the group and<br>they would study him as being a freak of<br>nature when humans do it we celebrate<br>them and we acknowledge them we put them<br>on the cover of magazines so what is it<br>that we've got while in this that<br>individual wealth versus Collective<br>important 5 years ago my wife and I<br>traveled to Brazil uh we were going to<br>the wedding of a young man who had been<br>a student with us when he was 17 and 17<br>years later when he was 34 he got<br>married and we went and we stayed with<br>his family for a week in K grandi in in<br>in Brazil lovely lovely people they were<br>lawyers and they lived in the most<br>beautiful house so we got to stay in<br>this house for a week and they had<br>servants and they had the most amazing<br>outdoor area with a pool and it was just<br>it was like paradise a beautiful<br>beautiful<br>house but it was a problem it was<br>surrounded by a concrete wall that was 4<br>M high and they had razor wire on top of<br>the wall and they had lights and they<br>had cameras and they had a steel gate<br>you had to drive through to get into the<br>house<br>because they were afraid of their<br>neighborhood and we got into a<br>conversation about what life was like in<br>New Zealand and they couldn't believe<br>that we didn't have walls around our<br>homes cuz cuz that how do you even live<br>like that and now my comment was that<br>when we fence our homes it's to keep the<br>dogs and the kids in not other people<br>out and that was a foreign concept for<br>them we don't want to live like that and<br>it struck me at the time is this what<br>wealth looks like cuz wealth in a in a<br>microcosm of that in a community that is<br>difficult to engage in and connect in<br>and people are scared that doesn't feel<br>like a wealthy<br>environment so this idea of of how do we<br>think about and we've all talked about<br>it this morning about what do people<br>absolutely need when you're talking<br>about the 1970s um it brought to mind um<br>as a 12-year-old standing on the street<br>down here in Lampton key in 1974 I think<br>it was with an elderly relative watching<br>the funeral procession of Norman Kirk<br>drive past and Norman Kirk said<br>something very significant he said<br>people don't need much just somewhere to<br>live something to do someone to love and<br>something to look forward to doesn't<br>sound like a highest fold and yet so<br>many of the people in our community<br>today don't have those things cuz I get<br>to see that every day and I I see it as<br>a great privilege and I say to people<br>when you sit with people who are doing<br>life really really hard and and some of<br>you will and gares comes and volunteers<br>for the witon City Mission and so he<br>gets to see some of this it does feel<br>like a real privilege because remarkably<br>they look like you and<br>I and they have a backstory like you and<br>I have it's just that Something's<br>Happened in the context of their their<br>life or their Journey that's put them on<br>a different trajectory than perhap some<br>of<br>us so what do we do about that is that<br>our<br>responsibility well I happen to think<br>that it is because I think if we're<br>serious about being both Healthy and<br>Wealthy and potentially wise then we<br>need to be in a community where we make<br>sure that everybody has at least<br>enough and so many of the people I work<br>with have virtually nothing<br>one of the things I say often these days<br>is that people don't become homeless<br>because they run out of money they<br>become homeless because they run out of<br>relationships why do they run out of<br>relationships primarily because of<br>mental health and addiction issues and<br>we see that so evident in our<br>community but often again economics<br>start to drive some of the differential<br>so we've opened in taranaki Street<br>earlier this year um a residential<br>alcohol harm reduction service everyone<br>else calls it a wet house I won't call<br>it that where people can come and live<br>and drink on the site why because they<br>need the alcohol to keep them alive<br>they're<br>alcoholics and if they don't have that<br>place to go to there is nowhere they can<br>go now there are lots of Highly<br>functioning alcoholics in our community<br>the difference between them and the<br>people I have there is their ability to<br>resour their own existence and so it<br>becomes an economic discussion as well<br>so it is really thinking about how do we<br>bridge the gap and how do we make that<br>difference happen we're about to open a<br>brand new building in um in 5 weeks time<br>from yesterday the date of your wise um<br>event so probably won't come um and it's<br>called fuamatu and its purpose is to<br>create a community where there's no us<br>and<br>them now that's not easy to do and the<br>the idea is to facilitate the community<br>learning how to care for<br>itself the interesting thing about that<br>project though and I started at nearly<br>six years ago as it started as a project<br>with a budget of $5<br>million my economics and and accounting<br>training really hasn't worked that well<br>because when we opened it on the 30th of<br>October it would have cost $50 million<br>so I should have been sacked by<br>now and I do intend at that time when I<br>open it on the 30th of October to open<br>it without debt and we're nearly there<br>you might have seen Ashley Bloomfield<br>hanging off a billboard in the weekend<br>that's all part of the campaign to try<br>and fund this building because if we can<br>open it without debt then all future<br>earnings and revenue goes directly into<br>Service delivery and we're going to get<br>there largely because of the generosity<br>of individuals and about 40% of the<br>money for that building will come from<br>central government the vast majority<br>comes from individuals in our community<br>many of them very high net worth<br>individuals and I'm not a fundraiser I<br>don't have for money my job is to enlist<br>people in a vision but it's about<br>creating the connection<br>between people that have something and<br>people that need something and how do we<br>make that connection work and I think at<br>the end of the day that's what this<br>conversation is all about how do we<br>ensure that everyone in our community<br>has enough I'm not talking about<br>everyone being equal because people<br>won't be equal I wish talk about equity<br>and fairness because they're the things<br>right thank you thank you all three of<br>you for really great perspectiv we will<br>um so we've had everything from what is<br>what is<br>wealthy how do we do the distribution<br>the for orbit the wealth in<br>equality um and how do ens sure people<br>have enough so we'll move to our second<br>question<br>which is what is essential to address<br>these<br>doing I think the the the critical thing<br>for me is is<br>well cutting to the chase how do we get<br>here um I'm an economist it was our<br>implementation of an economic philosophy<br>that did prioritize individuals over<br>um it hasn't delivered that economic<br>model and that economic policy and that<br>economic philosophy again we have to be<br>open about that rather than um still got<br>policy implementation that doesn't<br>accept that fundamental you talking<br>about evidence and data uh doesn't<br>accept that fundamental still thinks it<br>can deliver as long as we tweak a little<br>bit at the margins and I think the<br>fundamental challenge that we've got got<br>to get to is is dare I say is the<br>economics discipline and the economists<br>around the room and in this institution<br>uh and around Wellington because they do<br>the economic analysis they do the policy<br>analysis uh all the interventions to<br>justify government intervention or any<br>intervention in the economy is driven by<br>this model that puts individuals above<br>Community it puts individual Choice<br>above Community Choice um we've still<br>got a whole lot<br>of uh policy analysis tools that are<br>basically are targeted at increasing the<br>size of the pie not really interested in<br>how we divide up the PIP um and so<br>without getting too technical I will get<br>technical<br>um we've got uh in the in the economics<br>literature par optimality in in when not<br>allowed to intervene unless we've got a<br>par of improvement and that basically<br>means you can't take anything away from<br>me unless um well you can't intervene<br>with taking anything away from me you<br>can<br>intervene um as long as someone else is<br>getting better but no one else is<br>allowed to get<br>worse so that means a dollar taken away<br>from me is as bad as a dollar taken away<br>from one of the clients that go to the<br>social<br>Supermarket there's an equality there<br>that doesn't gel but that's the<br>economics we get<br>toward so we've actually got to as<br>economists get away from our allergy to<br>redistribution now allergic our allergic<br>response to any tax intervention is okay<br>you can't go into tax unless you can<br>prove that this redistribution is going<br>to<br>leave someone better off but no one<br>worse off it assumes the current<br>situation is<br>okay that's our policy analysis that is<br>still being implemented whether it's tax<br>um or whether it's welfare um or whether<br>it's um you know I say buying inter<br>Islander<br>fairies going to yeah anyway so that's<br>that's one of the first things is econom<br>has got to get past their own allergy to<br>distribution impacts and um the other<br>conversation similarly with um when I<br>was on the weeg and Welfare expert<br>Advisory Group and which was the I<br>suppose the the subsequent one from the<br>72 Royal Commission on social policy we<br>talked about adequate income we measured<br>those sorts of adequate incomes we put a<br>number out there let's continue to<br>measure that um but part of that is<br>let's reclaim our egalitarian values and<br>let's get out of this punitive<br>perspective on<br>beneficiaries they haven't done anything<br>wrong uh why do we consider that it's<br>okay to force beneficiaries into taking<br>out<br>work actually punish them if they don't<br>take out work when we've got another arm<br>of government actively putting people<br>out of<br>work and I can give you the economic<br>theories about why that's okay but<br>actually there's something wrong with<br>those economic<br>theories because it assumes those<br>economic theories that assumes the<br>current situation is okay and all we've<br>got to do is progress from that um the<br>other serve I put is why are all<br>economics departments and all the<br>universities in New Zealand parts of the<br>School of<br>Business sorry I just put it out there<br>why is economics sub you know what it<br>was a subset of business isn't it the<br>other way<br>around economics is way broader than<br>business but unfortunately business has<br>captured economics and that's how we get<br>this policy analysis which puts<br>individual Choice above Community Choice<br>my choice to be able to choose between<br>27 different brands of toothpaste on the<br>supermarket shelf is way more important<br>than the choice of a person having to<br>choose between putting food on the table<br>or uh going to the<br>dentist those two choices are equivalent<br>in the economic theory and because I can<br>afford my choice I take<br>priority so these something about the<br>economics discipline that we've got to<br>get really right because that drives our<br>policy<br>choices and that discipline you know and<br>I'm part of the discipline has a lot to<br>answer for so we've got to have some<br>courage in our economics and there are<br>some economists there are quite a few<br>especially outside of New Zealand who<br>have captured the new thinking or<br>different thinking uh I just encourage<br>that even more as one of the challenges<br>we're serious about the for<br>all ganes uh to be honest with you ganes<br>when you started questioning the<br>position of Economics I thought you were<br>going to say that it belonged political<br>yeah because um I often feel actually<br>like this with tax you know it's so<br>political that actually you know it's<br>very hard to separate the politics from<br>the actual discussion that we really<br>should be having um so bear with me one<br>moment I am going to talk to you about<br>TCH because<br>um I was going to say tax didn't create<br>this issue might not have solely created<br>it certainly contributed to it and it<br>definitely exacerbates it so in you know<br>we have um three tax on<br>yeah I'm sure that was intentional so um<br>there are three ways of of taxing at a<br>very simple level we can tax income<br>which we do really well in New Zealand<br>we can take something called consumption<br>which is everything that you buy and<br>again we do that incredibly well in New<br>Zealand the third arm is wealth and<br>that's what we don't do we there are<br>things at the margins yes the odd<br>transaction that will get picked up but<br>for the most part we don't tax wealth<br>and we certainly don't tax it<br>comprehensively like most other<br>jurisdictions do um I have no<br>particularly strong preference as to<br>whether that is a capital gains tax or a<br>land tax tax or an inheritance tax or a<br>wealth tax we just need something which<br>is going to tax wealth because this is<br>going to be one way that we can actively<br>start redistribution and instead of<br>redistribution from the middle to the<br>bottom you know it will be a broader<br>redistribution from the top yes we do<br>hear uh from those who have wealth that<br>they will leave the country if we<br>introduce a wealth tax well you know<br>good luck finding another place that's<br>not going to prot that wealth because<br>we're really one of the last few<br>standing that doesn't do<br>this and then I would ask why don't we<br>do this there is to my mind no good<br>reason for not texing wealth and yet to<br>see anything or be convinced or even<br>hear anything that actually suggests<br>that our policy in New Zealand as far as<br>not taxing wolf is the right way to go<br>instead as you probably have gathered I<br>think it was completely the the wrong<br>direction so i' I'd start I'd start<br>there<br>um I would<br>also point the finger at some of our<br>regulatory systems I look to the<br>influence that industry has in New<br>Zealand and I think why are we so<br>concerned rhetorical question why are we<br>so concerned with keeping industry Happy<br>Well we are a lot less concerned with<br>those who have very little and being<br>recorded so I'm actually not going to<br>call out the industries that I we all<br>know who I'm talking about but well<br>actually let's point to one that we all<br>know about we as taxpayers are now<br>essentially subsidizing the tobacco<br>industry and I can't believe that most<br>of us signed up for that yeah yeah<br>completely um uh ganish you made the<br>really good point business his has<br>captured economics and you know I think<br>that's that's absolutely right we are uh<br>very much as a society focused on our<br>governments are focused on keeping<br>business happy and actually what that<br>does is in that makes we lose sight of<br>the the people and our societies and our<br>communities who I actually think we<br>probably should be more focused on um<br>the other point that I was just<br>reflecting on is this organization you<br>know businesses<br>as Industries seem to be seem to be able<br>to organize themselves very very well<br>and the lobbying that we see now is is<br>pretty significant uh and it seems to be<br>working so I would question why we can't<br>do that as a collective to try to get<br>better outcomes for some of the people<br>in society are noted by big business and<br>business interests um if let me just say<br>one other thing um going actually<br>answering the question now what what is<br>um what would address those challenges I<br>would actually also say education so I<br>education I know is not for everyone I'm<br>not saying that that it is but the oecd<br>have a figure um along the lines of 50%<br>of um of um improvements in society over<br>the last 50 years can be directly<br>attributed to education and uh I would<br>like to see i' like to see ter education<br>being more available other education<br>being more available um you know I'd<br>like to see us pushing for no fees not<br>just U fees spre at the end so that<br>we're opening these opportunities for<br>people like we had 30 years ago when you<br>didn't have to make a choice about um<br>taking a job or going to University<br>because you would probably walk out with<br>an enormous student debt that you would<br>spend your next 5 years of work paying<br>off so I feel that those are some<br>choices we are putting on our our<br>younger people that you know that are<br>not choices maybe that that current<br>Generations have to make I will pass<br>back to maray thanks<br>maray thank you Lisa and to comment on a<br>couple of Lisa's points um I also<br>support the commitment to education<br>because education will be the thing that<br>starts to change the trajectory of<br>people's<br>outcomes and and in far as the wealth<br>tax goes that's also an area that I'm<br>I'm really interested in Radio New<br>Zealand have been doing a series<br>recently on well and wealth taxes and<br>interestingly enough they interviewed<br>some of New Zealand's highest net worth<br>individuals last week almost exclusively<br>they said they would be comfortable with<br>the wealth tax but they didn't trust the<br>government to spend it really<br>interesting uh concept my single largest<br>donor to my building project has given<br>me $8<br>million um they are a very high netw<br>individual but they why have they given<br>us money because they trust us to spend<br>with well and they believe in what we're<br>going to do with it so that's a really<br>important connection between you know um<br>Taxation and and connection into<br>resource and how it subsequently used<br>for me the biggest single issue that I<br>always talk about relates to<br>housing um housing is the thing that<br>drives most of the disadvantage I see in<br>the community at the moment and often<br>it's just the cost of housing and um and<br>we're not talking about home ownership<br>we're talking about the cost of tencies<br>and Leasing and rental properties and I<br>have um many of the people we deal with<br>are paying an excess of 60 to 70% of the<br>disposable income on their housing costs<br>and if that's the case they will not<br>survive they will not have enough to<br>live<br>them there was a Wellington city council<br>report done on housing and it came up<br>with three<br>conclusions that there wasn't enough so<br>it wasn't accessible enough um the stock<br>quality was insufficient so the um the<br>quality of our housing wasn't good<br>enough enough and thirdly it was too<br>expensive and that sounds like a<br>reasonable summary of what we all know<br>about the housing market the report was<br>written in<br>1906 some things haven't changed and yet<br>we're in a situation at the moment where<br>life is tougher I suspect for most<br>people than it's ever been and we're<br>getting senses of people now in our<br>community and it's the first time I've<br>heard this in in my 20 years in Social<br>Services is that people are becoming<br>hopeless so when people can't see out of<br>their current circumstances and they<br>lose hope that's a really difficult and<br>dangerous place for us as a community to<br>be<br>in and um so I mean every week the media<br>ring me ring me up and ask me to comment<br>on the cost of<br>living the reality is the answer is<br>always the same that we can talk about<br>Supermarket prices and we can talk about<br>the cost of<br>fuel but if you don't deal with the cost<br>of housing then it's all just it's all<br>just trial in<br>detail but there is some hope I think<br>and the Hope comes for me from from a<br>couple of places that I'll comment on<br>today the first is um I had the<br>privilege a few weeks too to sit on the<br>interview panel with<br>PSC for the new chief executive of the<br>um social investment agency which got<br>announced on Wednesday Wednesday this<br>week yesterday or the day before um<br>Andrew Coster the current Police<br>Commissioner has become the new chief<br>executive of the social investment<br>agency that<br>vehicle has the potential to change<br>government I think cuz his job is to<br>ensure that money is spent where it<br>makes the most difference and his job is<br>to um gather um Corral his colleagues<br>together the Public Service Chief<br>Executives and ensure that they fund and<br>operate in a way that reflects social<br>investment outcomes that's a very good<br>thing but the final thing I think and<br>and it comes down to us and how we<br>respond to our community and the thing<br>that's made this made the single largest<br>difference in the Wellington City<br>Mission over the last six years is a<br>commitment we made that we would treat<br>every person who came in our door with<br>dignity and with respect and without<br>judgment so my whole strategic plan for<br>the Wellington City Mission is wrapped<br>up in those three concepts dignity<br>respect and treating people without<br>judgment because when you put that as a<br>strategic filter over everything you do<br>and say is this the most dignified the<br>most respectful the least judgmental way<br>we can do this and if it's not let's<br>make it so it changes the way you relate<br>to your community and to the activities<br>you do and if we as a community can<br>adopt something similar in thinking<br>about those Concepts and it may be as<br>simple as when you walk past someone<br>who's sitting on the street um people<br>keep asking me should I give them money<br>um it's a wrong question<br>um what I encourage you to do is make<br>eye contact and say hello how's your day<br>going because you'd say that to anybody<br>else you can choose whether he gives<br>them money or not that's a different<br>conversation the idea that we create<br>dignity as we engage together properly<br>I'm going to<br>it thank you all that's great so I feel<br>like we should immediately<br>collectivise walk across to The<br>Beehive uh demand that we weth is taxed<br>in some form um and then come out and<br>hang out with me for the day yeah yeah<br>come and hang out with muray for the day<br>um support the social investment agency<br>and Lobby it uh and uh and well I<br>suppose internally within the within the<br>university we can maybe challenge our<br>economists on<br>their on their<br>paradigms<br>ex but yeah first of all we'll open it<br>up for discussion because I'm sure many<br>of you may have questions or comments<br>that that you would like to to PO to any<br>and my name is here move from nonprofit<br>Community uh representing couple of<br>organizations but thank you to all the<br>panelists really good talk um I have a<br>couple of questions related to the<br>overall talk first is thank you ganes<br>you shared the uh fact that your parents<br>came 70 years ago and if they would have<br>come 20 years ago things would have been<br>different I fall in the same category<br>not 20 more than 20 but the reason is<br>that if you look at immigration of this<br>country the intake is always more than<br>what is required here maybe New Zealand<br>is how there is sitting on a privilege<br>that<br>immigrants can be recycled and then<br>they'll go to Australia um I I know it's<br>hard but I would call it immigration<br>corruption secondly if you come to<br>taxation um cgt has been flocked to<br>death uh there are Gros there are cons<br>so it can be uh implemented it should<br>not be implemented but when there is<br>housing problem in New<br>Zealand and not introducing any tax at<br>housing at all is it not housing<br>corruption and I'll go go to the third<br>example like banana and<br>monkey when we celebrate those things on<br>the covers of the magazines is it not<br>corruption why we are tiptoeing against<br>around this world and not calling it<br>corruption that's my question and uh and<br>if you look at uh I mean um there a fact<br>here that smoking is subsidized and to<br>industri is being subsidized<br>we need to change the perception I grew<br>up as a child watching too much American<br>TV where even uh doctors were shown<br>enjoying smoking uh Sports people were<br>shown enjoying smoking but then the<br>perception changed and everybody went<br>against<br>smoking so why it is so hard to say that<br>New Zealand is a all seeker of country<br>we go home maybe a good meal sleeping<br>good bed but this policy coruption is<br>draining our pocket so why aren't we<br>you um I<br>suppose I'm not sure i' totally agree<br>with all of your comments but I get<br>where you're coming from I think um I'm<br>not sure it's that helpful to go down<br>the corruption route uh I prefer to be<br>The<br>Optimist uh and talk about the the<br>community that we want to build and the<br>AL that we want to build or leave for<br>our mapuna and I think that's the focus<br>of<br>uh the policy that we need to implement<br>and so for the immigration uh inquiry in<br>the immigration topic you know are we<br>comfortable as a nation leaving a legacy<br>where it's okay for some employers to<br>exploit<br>migrants because that's what we've<br>enabled by not having a labor<br>inspectorate that's fully funded it's<br>really that simple um I think the the<br>tax element uh and uh with all due<br>respect Lisa uh we can continue talking<br>about tax forever uh we're not going to<br>get there until we get a widespread<br>Acceptance in our community that tax is<br>okay there is nothing wrong with tax tax<br>is not taking away things from you it's<br>actually enabling us as a community to<br>deliver something for<br>everybody uh and I go back to that<br>economics analysis the problem we don't<br>get tax is because we've got an<br>economist have an inbuilt allergy to tax<br>because there's this thing called a dead<br>weight<br>loss that we're told in with stage one<br>economics I remember the learning about<br>the dead weight lck the moment the<br>government comes in and taxes something<br>there's a dead weight loss so there s so<br>tax is bad until we redefine or relook<br>at that ble and start talking about tax<br>is what it can enable we're never going<br>to get or make progress or maybe until<br>we do that that's when we make progress<br>on the different forms of tax so yes I<br>fully understand there are elements in<br>New Zealand that as corrupt we like to<br>think of ourselves as not but um<br>pointing that out yes but a lot<br>alongside a vision for the future that's<br>a more positive and to give our children<br>hope because I think that's what we've<br>got to<br>do uh I just going to make a a quick<br>point about corruption uh in general not<br>so much about immigration but our<br>um our government agencies that are<br>tasked with looking for corruption so<br>I'm thinking you know Inland Revenue<br>serious Fraud Office financial markets<br>Authority Commerce Commission you name<br>that they are seriously underreason<br>yeah yeah I mean we we may not find an<br>awful lot of corruption it's because<br>we're not resourced to actually go and<br>find it it is there um so I think your<br>your point in that respect is is um is<br>well made I might just pass on to Marie<br>for no I'm not sure I've got anything to<br>so um we talk about wealth in New<br>Zealand I'm thinking of<br>immigration there are people that come<br>to New Zealand for better employment<br>opportunity during the 80s many k left<br>New Zealand for other country and there<br>was shortage of IT staff so Foreigner<br>came to New Zealand to work as computer<br>programmer or um system analyst and all<br>that work permit will apply and some<br>stay to continue to work and apply for<br>permanent resident and some of this uh<br>overseas IT staff have become New<br>Zealander so I I think um Foreigner do<br>contribute to New Zealand economic<br>growth and also for investment like<br>business investment in New Zealand<br>create jobs bring Revenue to the<br>government and benefit everyone here um<br>but I look at this way New Zealand is a<br>wealthy country but we also respond the<br>core of humanity Ian like the church and<br>government do take in Refugee from war<br>zone and the church help the refugee to<br>Senter in New Zealand so I'm trying to<br>say is New Zealand are rich we should<br>gonto I must Adit from Le's comment the<br>others the sense of we're back with<br>McMillan Lord me Davidson in Kura um and<br>also of course we have to remember the<br>Royal Commission on Social Security in a<br>way distill that thinking and we saw<br>that right through until the mid 80s and<br>I think there are two critical things<br>that important there is that sense of<br>participation meant we had universality<br>in our benefits health education housing<br>from 1980s we've had school uh<br>desiles we've had targeting eventually<br>every benefit that we can we've had<br>public servants have become Gatekeepers<br>of the lives of individuals in a way<br>that they w't and it seems that I mean<br>the last shift from targeting to<br>universality ironically was moldun when<br>he got rid of the old age pension and<br>said everyone will get national super<br>and<br>and I think one thing I say what I think<br>is important is that that wealthy estate<br>was created by men and woman that went<br>through a depression at a second world<br>war so the generation before me believed<br>that they had an obligation to change<br>the<br>world now my generation I was a postwar<br>baby boom early postwar baby boom L than<br>even even Mar I think we've actually<br>acted more like plumbers in a social<br>system and infrastructure that's been<br>created and I think that's partly<br>because people like ganes who had a lot<br>of data I help give it to them um and we<br>sort of Judge the world in a really<br>mechanistic way and I wonder whether our<br>real hope for the future is the<br>generation that's coming through now<br>that knows that its life chances are<br>going to be less than that of their<br>parents and<br>grandparents and I think one of our real<br>obligations is to make sure that that<br>generation has the capacity if we're<br>really long-term thinkers to really<br>change and see things but I think we<br>have to come back to my My Generation<br>many of them politicians describe my<br>predecessors as gray singed uh gray<br>Jersey people who had no understanding<br>of the world and yet they're the ones<br>that b in the sense of change so I just<br>wonder what are we going to do to bring<br>that back you're the people at the front<br>of ask a question answers<br>um there was a lot of talk about need<br>for community and things like that we<br>actually have<br>organizations that will deal with these<br>things they're called trade unions um<br>some of you may remember them didn't we<br>Outlaw oh sorry and effective trade<br>unions deal with lots of these problems<br>they monitor workforces they deal with<br>problems like exploitation but they need<br>obviously the powers to do so um and<br>since 1991 of course we haven't had that<br>um the other thing I'd add that the oecd<br>which used to be sort of nice and<br>neoliberal has finally worked out that<br>effective trade unions are one of the<br>keys to most of the problems going on<br>economically and socially and the<br>easiest way to sort a lot of these<br>unions comment from the panel I I think<br>the other piece of Hope around um<br>Community organizations or institutions<br>is um is to look at uh structures within<br>tiari uh in terms of long-term thinking<br>and in terms of community more important<br>than individual now I'm not saying Marty<br>is any any better or worse than pakad<br>but I think the bringing those values to<br>the four again uh and yes re<br>reinvigorate unions I think that the<br>element is to reshape our thinking back<br>to what what are our values if you're<br>talking what is the objective of the<br>economy should be embedding those values<br>and in my opinion the objective is<br>leaving a legacy for our future<br>Generations that we have lost sight of<br>because the current objective of the<br>economy that we've assumed is just<br>delivering more and more to all of<br>us delivering more and more to some of<br>I wouldn't normally comment on unions<br>but um I will say that everybody is<br>deserving of someone going and debat for<br>them yeah and for those who don't have<br>support that's really important now<br>whether that's a union or some other<br>some other mechanism can I comment on on<br>men's um observation um I think we have<br>a generation of young people coming<br>through who are quite extraordinary they<br>can do things that you and I wouldn't<br>have even been a to Enis do<br>I I interviewed a young person well they<br>were early 30s so I think they young<br>person the other day and I wish I was<br>that bright when I was 30 it was just<br>there there's remarkable ways of<br>thinking and they have tool sets that<br>that you and I never had so this place<br>in particular um has a huge<br>responsibility and and potential to<br>create something really significant cuz<br>when I get groups of young people<br>together and they're pretty scary when<br>they're all together um they can they<br>can do almost anything and the things<br>that are obstacles and barriers for<br>people like me just don't seem to exist<br>with their young people so um I<br>completely support intercore we should<br>be backing our next Generation in any<br>can Mario um Helen Rook I'm the current<br>dean of the faculty of Health um um but<br>I'm a registered nurse of over 30 years<br>um one of the things that I've seen both<br>in my clinical and academic career is<br>that human beings um are inherently<br>selfish um on one hand and are also<br>inherently built for compassion um and<br>selflessness and um and so to balance<br>those things out it's quite tricky um<br>and I listened to somebody questioning<br>the DI Lama recently about<br>you know um you're all about<br>self-compassion and and yet you're still<br>sitting in isolation the Chinese still<br>have control over your territory um what<br>has self-compassion done for you because<br>you sit there alone and the answer that<br>really wisely um and said that the first<br>place that we have to start is about<br>self-compassion towards ourselves and if<br>we do that and we inherently look<br>internally we have the ability to uh to<br>look outward and to um you know change<br>the world slowly and gradually what the<br>question that I have is about who was<br>writing the new economic policies and<br>theories cuz I'd like to talk to them<br>really because if we're not doing that<br>you know I don't know I don't understand<br>I do understand a little bit about<br>economic theory but I'm not an economist<br>I'm a person who works alongside other<br>human beings to help them so I want to<br>know who's writing the new economic<br>theories and and maybe we could each<br>other can I make a comment and then<br>someone will give you a sensible answer<br>um firstly can I acknowledge you as a<br>registered nurse my three most senior<br>staff in the mission all registered<br>nurses and they have convinced me that<br>registered nurses can do anything<br>so um you made a comment about<br>selfishness um as a general observation<br>and there will always be exceptions I<br>think generosity and selfishness<br>inversely in relation to wealth I think<br>people who have more tend to share less<br>and if you don't believe that come and<br>sit in one of my services and you'll<br>find people who are the most generous<br>the most giving who don't have anything<br>pretty much but they will give you<br>something of what they have and um we've<br>constantly got to be reminded about this<br>cuz when someone gives you a million<br>dollar gift it's a big<br>celebration when someone gives you $10<br>it's probably a larger proportion of<br>their wealth than the million dollars<br>you got and we've got to be cognizant of<br>that but someone's going to give you a<br>decent answer well I I I'm going to hand<br>over to Ganesh for for the decent answer<br>but one that Springs to mind is Thomas<br>piki so I think he has done economic<br>well might be of economic um a bit of a<br>favor he's the one that that uh has<br>really introduced us to the idea that<br>returns to wealth are greater than<br>returns to income and it provides a<br>strong justification for taxing wealth<br>instead of taxing income but ganes will<br>explain that better well P has or PTI um<br>uh has done a lot of that recently that<br>work on redistribution or the<br>distribution and the historical changes<br>uh for quite a lot uh and that's the the<br>international perspective I think the<br>other two economists that I would uh put<br>always to talk about is um Mariana<br>masato who' been talking about uh active<br>uh in terms of mission based economy so<br>we don't focus on Industries and so what<br>would be the mission for us to S so<br>what's the North Star so it's not CH<br>growth it's the example from history was<br>we were going to put a man on the Moon<br>by the end of this decade and that was<br>the mission and all economic activity<br>was focused of bringing together that so<br>the mission now I'd say is how do we<br>build a New Zealand with no petrol<br>stations by 2035 full stop you know we<br>not all so petrol 2035 afterward so that<br>would be the mission so all of the<br>industry activity and bringing in New<br>so that's the the policy settings for<br>that or the policy questions and<br>responses uh and the other person I<br>would talk to I'll talk to bring in Kate<br>rorth Professor Kate rorth if some of<br>you maybe may have heard about the donut<br>economy model to me uh some economists<br>are very uh shall I say uh challenged by<br>that model because it's something<br>totally new well actually it's not that<br>totally new it's basically just economic<br>activity is bounded by constraints<br>there's a flaw a social flaw and there's<br>planetary boundary ceiling and you can't<br>go outside over those two and that's the<br>those are your flaws and economics<br>within constraints I that's what I was<br>taught in stage one economics you know<br>maximizing profitability subject to<br>constraints it's not new it's just the<br>constraints different the social flaw is<br>quite a conversation to have one of the<br>elements of the social flaw would be an<br>adequate income another part of the<br>social flaw is a right to<br>shelter you know we can all argue about<br>and economists will talk about dead<br>weight loss those are the rules that an<br>economy needs to operate under and need<br>start thinking about a model that's<br>comments you go that's yeah thank you<br>everyone that's really really amazing um<br>I I guess picking up on a lot of the<br>comments and and what you've said um<br>how do you think you can you can change<br>things especially<br>when if you think about I guess an<br>economy today and economy for the next<br>generation is probably even more reliant<br>on the kind of however you do it<br>Community<br>collectively Supply opportunities like<br>health education and Science and<br>Technology that's not individually<br>provided how can you sort of make Maxim<br>future I I think the first thing is to<br>recognize that we've changed a lot over<br>history uh so again let's not get<br>allergic to change uh and let's not try<br>and pretend that the economy we've got<br>today is going to continue forever uh it<br>needs to change the economic model needs<br>to change the business models need to<br>change we just need to respond we used<br>to have a business model where it was<br>perfectly okay to send kids down a<br>coold that were the rules that business<br>operates within the rules that we give<br>them so the new rules are AB C and D um<br>I think how do you do it we've got to<br>maintain that long-term Horizon and what<br>is the what is the North Star that we're<br>heading towards we've got no sense of<br>that B Star at the moment and it may<br>sound academic and it may sound all<br>fluffy and all you know the Strategic<br>Direction and all that sort stuff but at<br>the moment we've got an economy that is<br>just chugging along pretending that all<br>of the stuff out there is not relevant<br>we'll just carry on doing what we've<br>always done well give it a new North<br>Star and give it some more rules or new<br>rules it's going to operate in by the<br>way we're going to tax you uh and don't<br>complain because we're going to deliver<br>stuff you know that's the so it you know<br>I don't know the other is we need<br>leadership which is you scary but change<br>Always is scary<br>but uh<br>you<br>yeah we know that ecosystems go in<br>cycles and um often the example that's<br>used is the idea of a forest that burns<br>and then the the stuff that the burns um<br>forms the the basis for New Growth um to<br>pick up lens early I think as a as a<br>generation we<br>failed um I think we should have real<br>hope for the Next Generation so maybe<br>we're the maybe we we've been the the<br>time of the burning and the destruction<br>and the breakdown and actually there's<br>renewal coming I hope so and um<br>certainly um when I look at my children<br>my grandchildren they're they're going<br>to be better humans than I am I'm sure<br>and um so we should maintain the Hope in<br>that cuz you know it can't be broken cuz<br>otherwise we we've got a very difficult<br>okay well I'd just like to say a really<br>big thank you to Ganesh Lisa and maray<br>for really um<br>thought-provoking commentary<br>on the challenges that face us to get to<br>a fairer and wealthier future for all um<br>lots of food for thought from this this<br>morning and I hope we can bring some of<br>the threads through to our third session<br>on on um getting to a wiser future<br>for um and um I'm happy to think about<br>ways that we can continue the<br>conversation um next year kicking off<br>with another with another Dean series<br>because um I<br>just the things that are being brought<br>up are so rich and I hope that we can<br>Galvanize some action at some point at<br>the other end to begin changing things<br>maybe we can bring together some of our<br>economists and<br>start<br>interrogating economic models need some<br>friend so anyway can we show our<br>appreciation to</p></main><footer
