about complexity<br>and Leadership is Professor Susan H<br>house a professor of lifelong learning<br>Susan is the main coordinator of the<br>course leading and complexity for the<br>University of Oakland's MBA program K<br>Susan for someone who may not understand<br>the concept of complexities of<br>leadership what does that mean<br>I think complexities come from several<br>directions so first as a leader It's<br>never enough time yeah um there's never<br>complete information and if I ask<br>students what makes leadership<br>complicated they say it's the people cuz<br>they're all different and also I think<br>there's issues of power because power<br>changes things it changes how people<br>think and how they behave and then of<br>course<br>last does the context you're being a<br>leader in and that too affects what<br>should or could be done We Begin by<br>thinking about the context for<br>leadership then we talk about self-<br>leadership because if you can't lead<br>yourself how can you lead others and<br>then we think about leading people and<br>then we think about leading teams or<br>groups and then the last module is about<br>leading whole organizations aha I<br>think the way we think about leadership<br>has changed so years ago they<br>thought leadership capabilities were<br>born in you say he's a born<br>leader and then they thought maybe it's<br>more about the skills of leadership<br>which is kind of good because you can<br>learn skills you can't change what you<br>were born with and and more recently<br>it's about skills and attitudes and<br>behaviors and Valu<br>interesting where do we get our values<br>from Susan can they be T can all of<br>these things be taught wow I think it's<br>really easy to teach knowledge it's it's<br>not too bad to teach skills so long as<br>you have lots of practice but values<br>that's tricky there's evidence that you<br>can affect people's values within the<br>moment so if you tell a group of people<br>oh you're really clever it's good to be<br>clever and another group of people<br>you're not so<br>clever um then their perform You can<br>predict their performance there'll be a<br>big difference you haven't changed their<br>real ability and the same if you<br>persuade people you can get cleverer<br>intelligence is something you can grow<br>they'll actually do it was if you help<br>convince people that intelligence is<br>fixed and if you fail that's because you<br>weren't smart enough that becomes true<br>too so we can shape values we can shape<br>Behavior but the tricky bit is shaping<br>people's values so it sustains across<br>context and time and we don't know<br>exactly how to do that and then there's<br>also the ethical side of shaping values<br>so what right of I to tell somebody what<br>their values should be well all I can do<br>really is show them some evidence and<br>some options and maybe challenge their<br>existing values by showing that in this<br>situation they're not so<br>helpful and leave the responsibility to<br>for changing to the<br>individual one of the things that's kind<br>of interesting about this topic is just<br>how broad it is it's vague but it's<br>specific and it's like it just feels so<br>overwhelmingly big how does it work uh I<br>think it's yes to all of the above so<br>there are there's a multiplicity of<br>theories about<br>leadership and and they each have a<br>place and the all theories tend to<br>assume that the leaders know best and<br>they will direct things and they're<br>working within a hierarchical<br>organization and they have a<br>place but then the newer theories<br>recognize that sometimes our leaders<br>don't know what to do things change fast<br>um our organizations are flatter so they<br>have less power and so then those that's<br>another Suite of the theories and no one<br>Theory will suit every situation so I<br>think what we we'll be trying to do is<br>help students<br>to select between theories and and<br>recognize this situation that theory<br>helps me understand this situation but<br>when I face that oh that theory explains<br>what was going on then interesting so we<br>help come try the theories come alive so<br>it's like a suite of resources and ways<br>of thinking about things and then they<br>can tailor whatever their unique<br>situation is to the resource just like a<br>trade he has a bag of tools hopefully<br>our leaders have a bag of theories and<br>ideas and techniques I really love that<br>idea in what ways has leadership changed<br>over the years everybody's heard I think<br>of the fourth Industrial Revolution and<br>how fast technology is is changing and<br>and how our concerns have shifted<br>towards climate change and there's<br>geopolitical unrest and all these things<br>are affecting um organizations and the<br>world of business so people say that the<br>world in which leaders ship takes place<br>now is Booker they say so it's volatile<br>uncertain complex and ambiguous but um<br>there's another acronym that I like a<br>little bit better it's Banny and and<br>what it says is we used to go about<br>leadership with a suite of assumptions<br>we thought the world was Rob us it's not<br>the world is<br>brittle and we thought of people as as<br>resources who we could kind ofe they're<br>not people are<br>anxious and we<br>thought we could predict the future from<br>the past in a kind of linear way but<br>it's nonlinear um the rate of change is<br>escalating so we can't accurately<br>predict and we used to thought think if<br>as Leaders we work really hard we could<br>understand the situations but it's not<br>it's incomprehensible and that leaves<br>you to Banny these false<br>assumptions can really revolutionalize<br>the way you make decisions and the way<br>leaders orchestrate their businesses how<br>fascinating it is isn't it there's an<br>agility and there's a fluidity to modern<br>day leadership yeah absolutely yes so<br>what are the first steps in becoming a<br>good leader I think self-reflection is<br>is a massively important tool that<br>people have because if you don't know<br>what your values are and you don't know<br>what your strengths and weaknesses are<br>and you're not perhaps aware of your<br>biases then it's quite difficult to grow<br>from there I used to interview people<br>for jobs and they'd sometimes tell me oh<br>I've got 20 years experience at da da da<br>and as they're talking I'm thinking no<br>you've got one year's experience but<br>you've had it 20 times because they<br>haven't thought about their mistakes<br>they haven't listened to others they<br>haven't reflected on what's going on so<br>I think this reflection thinking about<br>what<br>happened hugely powerful I sometimes say<br>to folk the best coach you'll ever have<br>is you because no one cares more about<br>you or knows you better than you right<br>and if you're in a good place then<br>you're in a better position to lead<br>others<br>absolutely your<br>behavior really affects how others<br>behave so this is this so powerful um a<br>leader who wakes up in the morning and<br>hasn't had enough<br>sleep it affects their subordinates<br>during that day and they won't<br>know they don't know that at all but<br>it's it's quite a robust finding how<br>important is vulnerability what' you say<br>well I suppose if you're living in a<br>world where you actually know all the<br>answers and you have ultimate P being<br>certain is quite handy but if you're in<br>a world where this is really complicated<br>I'm not sure what to do I'm needing to<br>rely on all these people faking it is<br>quite unwise people want to trust you<br>you need to be honest and it's it's a<br>bit of a paradox because you you need to<br>be honest and<br>open but also quite calming so if you're<br>mid Panic maybe not share that<br>yep I understand and I understand that<br>um Can failure be a positive things for<br>leaders you don't learn anything unless<br>you fail occasionally but I think<br>um failing in a safe way is good as a<br>leader um sometimes folks say no problem<br>is so awful that you can't make it worse<br>so yes<br>cautiously um small EXP experiments that<br>may or may not fail but if they fail<br>it's not catastrophic is a really good<br>way to go forward in an environment<br>that's so complex that you can't find a<br>single path what makes a leader good and<br>who<br>decides well I think the subordinates<br>decide because if the leader decided we'<br>all be<br>fantastic um and what makes a leader<br>good depends on the situation if you<br>imagine now that<br>you're uh in a combat zone and you're<br>able people threatening you you don't<br>want a leader that diers but imagine now<br>you want somebody who says we're going<br>to do this you do that you do that but<br>imagine now you're designing a new<br>advert for<br>something really oh what do you think I<br>think this so a collaborative leader is<br>much better there does a good leader<br>need to be the most experienced person<br>in order to lead in a<br>group I think experienced in the art of<br>leadership would help but you cannot now<br>be more experienced and better at<br>everything that your team's doing you<br>you employ them because they're better<br>than than you are at all the tasks that<br>they do so no they don't need to be that<br>experience and I think<br>um part of it is about leading in a old<br>sense in delegating town as creating<br>certainty making sure things are<br>done but another part of it is creating<br>the<br>environment so people can Excel so<br>people want to work and so that they'll<br>give their best to your organization<br>without you saying please do this can<br>you do this and I'll watch whether<br>you've achieved it or not are there any<br>unique challenges to Leading people<br>specifically in<br>Alo some of the students work for quite<br>large organizations<br>and often their head offices are<br>overseas and their head office may have<br>an organizational culture that's not<br>quite the same as as here and I think<br>that's a challenge for our leaders they<br>maybe limited<br>influence and then other of our students<br>work for very small organizations and<br>then they're probably covering several<br>roles H and have quite a lot of<br>influence responsibility<br>so I think that's a little bit of a<br>difference and I also think you know<br>some senses we're isolated we're a<br>little country at the bottom of the<br>world and in another sense The Whole<br>World's here so sometimes you'll have as<br>many languages in the class as you have<br>people and um so that's a massive<br>privilege yes I think it is unique do<br>you look at things like indigenous<br>cultures inside like is there an element<br>of it that looks at kind of dealing with<br>Mary issues and um ship Mario isues come<br>up but so does how does this work in<br>Asia how does this work when you've got<br>a group of staff from this<br>Heritage<br>and there I think it's a topic for<br>discussion in the class where everybody<br>brings their stories I think stories a<br>wonderful way to learn we remember<br>stories and and if I have a concept and<br>we have stories about this and stories<br>about that I read you get to understand<br>this kind of ambiguous concept really<br>well layer stories around it what<br>leadership qualities does someone need<br>to inspire confidence in others role<br>modeling is good trust is good isn't it<br>um sometimes you have a Triumph of<br>confidence over competence so you don't<br>want immeasurable confidence all the<br>while I think a tolerance of failure and<br>curiosity yeah people feeling<br>safe to do their<br>best um what are the most important<br>communication skills a leader can have<br>yeah a lot of it's about communication<br>because you might have the best idea in<br>the<br>world and if nobody knows about<br>it I think in today's world<br>listening<br>because as you become a leader and you<br>get more power the truth is come be<br>hidden from you and you need really to<br>wonder am I listening am I hearing the<br>truth are people able to<br>share so I think listening is the most<br>important and I think<br>then<br>communicating<br>messages without a lot of go<br>and business speak so that people see<br>how your words have implications for<br>them listening caring and plain<br>speaking simple then isn't it um how<br>important is transparency when you're<br>building trust with other<br>people well who's going to follow a<br>leader that they know lies to them and<br>doesn't fulfill their<br>promises so yeah I think you've you've<br>got to be seen to be<br>fair and so having transparent processes<br>so even if<br>decisions aren't agreeable to everybody<br>that they can see how they came about<br>and that the process was all right do<br>you look at case studies yes we have<br>lots of case studies um they're often<br>quite short scenarios and so people work<br>through some of them online and then<br>some will have come to one conclusion<br>and some have come to another and then<br>they can talk about them in the live<br>sessions the last pillar of your um<br>courses leading teams and organizations<br>how will studying complexity theory help<br>students think about organizations<br>differently management researchers have<br>thought about organizations as systems<br>for a very long while and you can<br>imagine that traditional organizational<br>chart and they view organizations as<br>having inputs like a transformational<br>process where all the little cogs and<br>all the little departments work together<br>to produce these<br>outputs so that's one view of a<br>system complexity Theory says no that's<br>it's a system but the metaphor is wrong<br>it's an<br>ecosystem and so what you've got are<br>multiple agents or nodes in this network<br>in this ecosystem each of them is<br>agentic so uncontrollable to some extent<br>each has a the it's their own theories<br>and their own<br>opinions and as we know with ecosystems<br>that they're more robust the more<br>diversity you have in your<br>ecosystem and we also know from<br>ecosystems that they adapt more rapidly<br>if there's lots of connections between<br>the nodes and so it helps us think about<br>um how can we help our organizations<br>become more adaptable more agile and we<br>know ecosystems can seem quite resilient<br>and then go into catastrophic change<br>organizations do it too so how can we<br>anticipate that and manage that and then<br>we know ecosystems sometimes change and<br>so it helps us think about where do the<br>new ideas come coming from how can I<br>give oxygen to those ideas and suffocate<br>those ideas it's like an organic thing<br>that's it do you look at leadership um<br>how leaders can manage change within<br>groups of people in an organic way<br>because some people are terrified of<br>change and don't want it to happen other<br>people are open and flexible and really<br>important that leaders understand change<br>leadership must involve change otherwise<br>you don't need a leader if you just want<br>things to chug along um and again these<br>challenges with manag and change depend<br>on your kind of metaphor so if you have<br>the older metaphor of the closed system<br>then chain you want stability yeah and<br>then change is about unsettling is about<br>helping people become ready to change<br>and not to resistant and then managing<br>the change and then getting back to<br>stability now if you go to the<br>complexity Theory thinking about change<br>there is no stability change is<br>ubiquitous and continuous<br>and your job then is to keep the<br>business going in some but also be<br>looking for this change and making help<br>helping the organization become<br>adaptable to absorb the change quickly<br>completely different views of leadership<br>yes and do you cover things like Crisis<br>management a crisis is caused by a<br>catastrophic event that really affects<br>your business so one of the things is I<br>think beforeand trans stop having crisis<br>by some contingency planning and<br>dreaming at what happens if this<br>building falls up what happens if we no<br>electric what happens so that but once<br>you're in I think a situation of<br>Crisis it's got to be about calm<br>otherwise people can't think and I think<br>the leader's job then is to think<br>about something that<br>gets people a kind of temporary<br>prefixed and then allocate the right<br>resources I think it's about being<br>honest it's those paradoxes<br>between calming folk but also helping<br>people with the truth yes I don't think<br>there's a brilliant way to handle a<br>crisis there's going to be Fallout<br>there's also an external element to it<br>right in terms of written comms and<br>businesses and organizations during a<br>crisis can come under pretty intense<br>pressure um how important is it to get<br>the comms part of it right when you're<br>dealing externally as a leader we look<br>at some examples<br>of very poor efforts and then we asked<br>the class to uh improve them nice being<br>able to show folk different kind of<br>announcements and messages and saying<br>what's the risks here and how can we<br>make things honest but better beautiful<br>Susan that was wonderful thanks so much<br>if you found leading in complexity<br>interesting feel free to check out the<br>Innovative and world-class
