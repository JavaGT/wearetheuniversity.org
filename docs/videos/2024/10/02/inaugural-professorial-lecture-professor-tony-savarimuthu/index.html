the<br>deputy Vice Chancellor academic and I'm<br>your host for this<br>evening it is my great pleasure to<br>welcome you you all to this very special<br>occasion to celebrate the promotion of<br>Tony<br>saaru to professor at the University of<br>atago these lectures are a wonderful<br>opportunity for us to come together and<br>listen to our new professors talk about<br>their personal Journeys their research<br>platform and the impact their research<br>has had on others<br>I'd like to welcome colleagues students<br>and friends from across the university<br>and Beyond I'd like to give a special<br>welcome this evening to Tony's wife<br>Rexy uh to his son Rowan to his daughter<br>Ria to his sister shamila along with her<br>family and his brother-in-law<br>Robin all of whom are attending here<br>tonight uh to celebrate with us<br>all finally I'd also like to thank both<br>of Tony's parents who are joining us<br>remotely this evening via live<br>stream it's not easy to become a<br>professor at the University of atago in<br>order to be promoted to that level<br>candidates need to show that they are<br>outstanding in each of three areas<br>teaching research and service Tony has<br>clearly met all of these<br>criteria it's an honor and a privilege<br>to congratulate him tonight for that<br>outstanding achievement and I hope you<br>will join me now in doing the same and I<br>I'll just note that if I wasn't holding<br>this uh this microphone I'd be clapping<br>much and I hope you'll take every<br>opportunity to do more of that this<br>evening tonight Tony will share a little<br>about his research into the social<br>aspects of computing specifically he'll<br>discuss what it takes to create socially<br>aware<br>software the socialness of the social<br>software development<br>process and how one can develop AI<br>software for the overall good of<br>society Tony though will not only<br>discuss his research this evening he'll<br>also reflect on his academic career to<br>tell us a little bit about his own<br>personal Journey Journey about the<br>impact of his research on the profession<br>on his teaching and most importantly on<br>his<br>students but before he does that I'll<br>hand over to Professor Richard Barker<br>proce Chancellor of the division of<br>Sciences to introduce Tony formally and<br>give you a little more detail about his<br>academic<br>background thank you<br>Professor Brock<br>T Professor dick<br>T Professor<br>tenot it is my great pleasure to<br>introduce our speaker tonight Professor<br>Tony Savar Mutu from the school of<br>computing to give his inaugural<br>professorial lecture here at the<br>University of<br>otago as Professor Brock indicated Tony<br>was promoted to Professor in February of<br>this year and tonight we get to<br>celebrate this significant<br>achievement Professor sarim muu was born<br>in Tamil Nadu the southernmost state of<br>India and the home of the Tamil people I<br>didn't get much joy trying to dig out<br>some early history on Tony but he did<br>report that as a young boy he learned<br>batam the state dance of<br>tadu the oldest classical dance form in<br>India and perhaps tonight we're in for a<br>treat his his journey to otago is also<br>something of a mystery but from his<br>employment record I can glean that he<br>was a teaching assistant in computer<br>science at bits there's a lot of<br>acronyms in this subject bits Palani<br>India for two years in the early 2000s<br>bits stands for the beer Institute of<br>Technology and Science and then a<br>software engineer at Coral grid software<br>in chenai then part-time assistant<br>lecturer at bits again in chenai before<br>appearing as a teaching fellow in the<br>department of information science here<br>at the University o tago from 2004 to<br>2006 at which time he then transferred<br>to being a lecturer in the<br>department from 2006 and onwards Tony's<br>PhD is from the University of otago he<br>graduated in 2011 and was supervised by<br>the husband and wife combination of<br>maram and the late Martin peris T<br>maram sister shamila was also supervised<br>by this team which has led to some<br>curiosity including family member only<br>papers involving the peris and Savita<br>muu families and also a within family<br>publication where his sister and wife<br>are co-authors along with Tony is the<br>only three authors on the paper so when<br>I read this I thought I should go back<br>and double check as referees for this<br>promotion as Professor Brock has noted<br>promotion to professor at the University<br>of otago is far from easy and one must<br>Excel on on all three domains of<br>academic activity in research teaching<br>and service Professor Savari muthu's<br>research expertise is an agent based<br>systems which are vital to the<br>development of robust artificial in<br>intelligence technology and applications<br>highly topical in the world we live in<br>just right now and I'm sure we're about<br>to hear more about these agent-based<br>systems and what they represent so I<br>won't provide a spoiler to quote one of<br>the referees for his professorial<br>promotion application his seminal work<br>on Norm identification continues to be<br>highly cited and his work in the area of<br>multi-agent systems is highly impactful<br>a mark of the productivity of Tony<br>research is the output he has 133<br>quality assured Publications most of<br>which are first or second authored in an<br>H index of<br>26 This research has also been Rec<br>recognized by his academic peers for its<br>Excellence he received best paper runner<br>up award this year for his paper Tech<br>energy poty with artificial intelligence<br>challenges and opportunities at the<br>emergent Research Forum at the America's<br>International Conference he won the most<br>thought-provoking paper award in 2023<br>for his paper improving information<br>system sustainability by applying<br>machine learning to detect and reduce<br>data waste that appeared in the<br>communications of the associations of<br>information science journal and he's<br>also been recognized by this University<br>he received the otago business school<br>research impact award from the school<br>School in<br>2021 a significant feature of Tony's<br>research is that most of its work is<br>co-produced with his postgraduate<br>students which brings me to the next<br>domain in which academics must excel in<br>that of<br>teaching Professor Savar muthu's<br>teaching efforts book and the academic<br>Spectrum being concentrated at both<br>first year and postgraduate he has<br>supervised 13 PhD students five Master<br>students as well a further 12 honors<br>projects included amongst the pH DS as a<br>students whose work was recognized by<br>entry onto the dean's list of<br>exceptional PhD research in theago<br>business<br>school a standout feature of Tony's<br>undergraduate teaching is the personal<br>evaluations of his teaching by students<br>most of his evaluations scored a perfect<br>100% for Effectiveness something we<br>really see from our big first year class<br>teachers and this was maintained through<br>Co lockdown a period when many of our<br>students struggled with the online mode<br>of teaching and this was reflected in<br>evaluations I'm privileged to see for<br>other lecturers but not Tony's well<br>done unsurprisingly his teaching has<br>also received recognition and in 2021<br>Tony was nominated for a best teaching<br>award and best innovation in teaching in<br>the Oto business school he was nominated<br>for the Oto University Students<br>Association teaching award in<br>2013 and then again in<br>2015 and this was for one of the large<br>about 500 students and challenging<br>papers that he and his colleagues have<br>to teach business 106 a compulsory paper<br>for business majors and not an<br>especially popular<br>one but the best tribute I can pay to<br>Tony's teaching is in the words of his<br>first year teachers uh students Tony is<br>an outstanding teacher he really cares<br>about his students and professional<br>practice one of the best teachers<br>extremely intuitive and his lectures<br>kept my interest for the subject growing<br>Tony genuinely cares about this paper<br>and the success of his students and I<br>hope to have him as a lecturer in future<br>courses at<br>otago the final domain in which our<br>academics must Excel is service to the<br>academic and professional communities a<br>significant source of service to the<br>academic communities is via conference<br>support Professor s muu has served on<br>the steering committee of the Prima<br>conference series since<br>2014 he has been a program Committee<br>Member for a number of conferences with<br>AAR core ratings including<br>theas the foremost conference and<br>multi-agent systems the triple Ai and<br>the JC did say there were lots of<br>acronyms he was local Organization<br>co-chair for the top ranked<br>AAS 2024 conference which is AAR ranked<br>for this work he has also received<br>recognition winning best senior program<br>Committee Member award at the 17th<br>principles and practice of a multi-agent<br>systems Conference held in Brisbane<br>Australia in<br>2014 for the University he has been a<br>director of the software engineering<br>program since 2018 convener for six<br>otago PhD thesis Commerce representative<br>on the Sciences academic board chair of<br>the information Science teaching and<br>learning committees and one of the lead<br>two lead course advisers in information<br>science for 15 years I could go on but I<br>think that is enough for me it is now<br>time to hear from Professor Savar muu<br>himself please join me in welcoming<br>Professor Tony Saar<br>muu tenot tenot tenot so thank you all<br>for being here and and wakum so wakum is<br>what we say in Tamil to greet people so<br>I'm from the land of tadu as Professor<br>um Barker has said so thank you for the<br>um kind introductions Professor Brock<br>and Professor Baker and thank you U um<br>associate professor dick for your final<br>final remarks and and for your thank you<br>note so today I'm going to talk about my<br>personal Journey so I'm going to reflect<br>on my my personal Journey along with my<br>academic Journey as Professor baker has<br>mentioned these two Journeys have been<br>in intertwined a lot in in my case so<br>what I'm going to talk is a combination<br>of these two so it go back and forth um<br>presentation so my journey started in<br>the state of Tamil Nadu tamado is the<br>southernmost state of India I was born<br>at the center of the state in a place<br>called manaparai it's known for um a<br>particular dish called muruku so we all<br>love food um in India so I really enjoy<br>that particular dish and my parents were<br>teachers<br>um so I was quite privileged growing up<br>we had plenty um because they were<br>teachers uh they could we could afford<br>good education they could afford good<br>education but they have had a remarkable<br>Journey so I really appreciate my<br>parents because of the education that<br>they provided because when they were<br>they grew up they grew up in a poor<br>household so they come from a farming<br>background so um so they in India the<br>farmers have very little so they had<br>about three acres of land and they have<br>four kits in in both sides of the family<br>um they had several kits so it was<br>difficult to feed feed them but my<br>parents were quite uh determined so they<br>were the first borns in their families<br>and also they they spent spent a lot of<br>time commuting to school and they<br>literally had no electricity so as they<br>were growing up they experien poverty<br>and that that made them strong because<br>they were quite determined they were<br>determined to get a good education so my<br>dad walked about 16 kmers a day to get a<br>good education so they were the first in<br>many things the my father and mother<br>they both first borns and they were the<br>first to go to college they were the<br>first to go on to become um master's<br>degree holders so my mom has a master's<br>degree in history and my dad has a<br>master's degree in English so education<br>was a top priority in our household and<br>they also made sure that we learned the<br>lesson of perseverance whatever we do we<br>must do the best if you're studying we<br>must be the best if you're going to play<br>sports we must be the best so this was<br>something that was inculcated in us um<br>um as a part of our childhood um<br>education<br>so I asked my mom um so what do what do<br>you remember the most when I was born<br>and she<br>said lots of chaos so N I was born in<br>1979 and this particular uh space<br>station Sky lab was coming down and a<br>lot of villages had this chaos the<br>people were thinking it was just going<br>to land on top of them so they were<br>trying to sell all their cattle their<br>houses and so on so there was a large<br>amount of chaos I when I heard this I<br>thought that was not a good good start<br>but I soon found something good so this<br>1979 was also the international child<br>year of the child so that was a good<br>year because um it raised certain<br>interesting um issues about um about<br>children the child poverty and the Need<br>For Education educating the children and<br>so on so something good came out of um<br>this<br>year then my parents moved to a<br>southernmost tip of almost southernmost<br>tip of India to the bottom of India<br>that's 300 km from where I was born um<br>to a beautiful place called as vikr<br>singapur it's closer to a place called<br>popan Assam which some of you from India<br>might know um so it has this beautiful<br>waterfall this was 4 kmers from us and I<br>grew up in the Patty Fields so literally<br>that is a view from my house if I looked<br>outside I would see Patty Fields it was<br>such a beautiful environment for me to<br>grow<br>up and this was me when I was two and<br>three<br>respectively and you could see something<br>interesting<br>I have a stare I just noticed by looking<br>at these pictures<br>but so so this stair is harmless um you<br>know I didn't know that I had this<br>professorial stare when I was only two<br>and three because you know my my wife<br>tells me sometimes you have the stair<br>you just keep looking at things I'm<br>thinking you're you're thinking so so I<br>had this right from the beginning so I<br>was destined to be a professor right so<br>I'm just<br>joking and I had a very happy childhood<br>Ood as you can see from the pictures I<br>was really<br>Smiley and I and I went to Catholic<br>schools um so this was my High School St<br>Mary's and the brothers of the Sacred<br>Heart were very strict if you been to a<br>Catholic school at that point in time<br>you'll know how strict they were but I<br>was a good student mostly I was not<br>punished<br>mostly and I also played some<br>interesting spots for some of you this<br>might be quite um quite new uh probably<br>you might hear this for the the very<br>first time I played these ports called<br>teny and ball badmon so teny is the<br>circular ring we call that as um a ring<br>ball so it has exactly the same rules as<br>tennis but you need to throw this ball<br>across the net and it was quite good in<br>creating wobbly balls so when when this<br>ball twists it's really become difficult<br>to actually hold on to the ring ball so<br>it's quite hard to catch it um so I was<br>pretty good at it and I also played ball<br>batminton so this is the version of<br>batmon where we have a Woolen ball um<br>and um so this is pretty good because we<br>could play these ports even if it's<br>rainy or windy okay so with shuttle<br>shuttle C with shuttle Batman it becomes<br>difficult when it's windy but with the<br>ring ball in particular we could play<br>rains so I also was a troop Sergeant so<br>I represented my school um in the<br>National events<br>and I had a lot of fun with my<br>grandparents I said my grandparents were<br>poor yes they were poor but there was a<br>lot of fun so I spent about a month<br>every summer holiday with my uh<br>grandparents so my parents made sure<br>that I went and learned um the state of<br>the world I I must know the real how the<br>real world looks like so they've sent me<br>every month to my grandparents so one<br>interesting thing is I learned to swim<br>in a well because this was a very dry<br>land um so this is the center part of<br>Tamil Nadu so we didn't have any rivers<br>it was really dry so typically to make a<br>person uh learn to swim what they do is<br>they tie a dried vegetable so they they<br>tie it to the back and they just throw<br>the person in the B okay so initially<br>for the first 20 minutes you just cry<br>you cry and cry and then suddenly you<br>realize you're not dying so finally<br>after the 20 minutes you decide you can<br>actually swim okay so I learned swimming<br>when I was 10 and my sister was quite<br>capable she just saw me swim and she<br>just jumped she had no flotation device<br>she jumped and then she swam so she was<br>a natural okay I'm not natural she is<br>and another the another interesting<br>thing about um growing up with my<br>grandparents or visiting them is um<br>having fun uh in the context of riding<br>animals so buffalos are really really<br>soft even though they may look really<br>big and scary they are really soft<br>animals I spent a lot of time just<br>riding them as they're gracing you just<br>lie down on them and have a snooze okay<br>so it's it's really fun so I had a lot<br>of fun um with my<br>grandparents at the same time I also saw<br>how hard they worked as you can see here<br>there are a couple of AI generated<br>images um because I don't have the real<br>images um I learned something about um<br>agriculture as well U because the water<br>was scarce they need to really plan what<br>kind of um vegetables they grow um AR<br>soon learned if you grow go into the<br>field of tomatoes you get really really<br>itchy but that's a good opportunity to<br>go and jump in the well so I used used<br>to do it and I really hated plucking<br>flowers or harvesting flowers because<br>it's a real really boring job you know<br>this would be five or six hours long so<br>um so I did realize what I liked and<br>what I didn't like but more importantly<br>I realized the transformational power of<br>Education the reason why we had a<br>comfortable life is because of the<br>education of my parents so I didn't take<br>it lightly so I did work hard and I<br>topped the class both in my 10th<br>standard and 12th standard so these are<br>the two public um<br>exams and and you know there was there<br>is this article in newspaper where it<br>says I wish to become a doctor so at<br>that point what I meant was medical<br>doctor not the kind of doctor I had<br>become okay but I'm happy with the kind<br>of doctor I have now become but that was<br>definitely the medical doctor um and I<br>had a 95% score um in my 12th exam but<br>still that was not good enough to become<br>a medical doctor but I had several<br>office in engineering um so I got into<br>mining engineering Computer Engineering<br>chemical engineering and so on and I<br>decided to take up chemical engineering<br>because that was my second favorite<br>subject um I really wanted to become a<br>doctor but eventually I became um an<br>engineer so the reason why I chose<br>chemical engineering because of my love<br>love with organic chemistry for some<br>reason I really liked organic chemistry<br>I think my teacher had a big role and<br>salicylic acid was my favorite uh<br>compound I don't know why um so I moved<br>to the northern part of India so we were<br>in Tamil Nadu and we went I went all the<br>way to Rajasthan this is 3,000 km long<br>so the journey was quite difficult<br>because you need to take two buses and<br>two trains and it took three and a half<br>days to reach um Rajasthan and I became<br>an expert in taking these trains so some<br>of you here who may have taken Indian<br>trains they're usually punctual um so it<br>might be maximum of 4 hours late so the<br>then the then the Nell Express that<br>takes you to the city Chennai and then<br>uh the grand trunk Express takes you all<br>the way to Delhi and then you need to<br>take a bus so I would have spent about<br>two months commuting to the university<br>just going to the university and coming<br>back to my hometown because I was at the<br>University for six<br>years and I chose bit Palani um The<br>burla Institute of Technology and<br>science which is difficult to pronounce<br>and this was set up by the professors<br>inam Mighty um and this be this was one<br>of the prominent universities in India<br>and that had become the most modern<br>engineering school in India so that's<br>the main reason why I chose to go to<br>bits and I studied chemical engineering<br>because of my love in love with<br>chemistry but I soon realized chemistry<br>and chemical engineering are two<br>different things even though they have<br>um chemist somewhere in in the titles um<br>and it was all about the large scale<br>production so the reason why it was<br>interested in chemical engineering is a<br>distillation column where we have a<br>petroleum heavy residue and the<br>petroleum heavy residue can be then<br>distilled into kerin petrol and all<br>kinds of interesting liquids so that was<br>my main attraction to chemical<br>engineering so as a part of any<br>engineering degree you had to spend a<br>substantial amount of time um in<br>internship so I did my internship in the<br>East part of India in a state called as<br>bear and now it's a part of jarand in<br>India and<br>the The Institute called Central fuel<br>Research Institute was located in this<br>town um called danbad meaning a city of<br>wealth so they had become wealthy<br>because of coal and that's the reason<br>why that research institute is located<br>in that town but soon I became really<br>sick I was asthmatic so I had probably<br>six to seven episodes of asthma in six<br>months and I had to change my mind so I<br>decided to do software engineering so<br>again I went to University I finished my<br>first degree but I went to to the same<br>University back and um I had a<br>conversion program where I took software<br>engineering that's how I became a<br>software<br>engineer and my first St of research<br>came in the year 2001 where I was um a<br>graduate assistant um or a teaching<br>assistant um in a software engineering<br>um for a software engineering paper so<br>what is interesting about these two<br>graphs is um students as a part of their<br>study have to estimate how how many<br>lines of code they will write before<br>writing the code okay this is a part of<br>the software um um personal software<br>process and also they have to estimate<br>uh the amount of time taken so these<br>graphs show that students can do more<br>and less time so sound familiar so we<br>all actually um probably do the same<br>thing we think we can do more in less<br>time so this these graphs show that and<br>it is an example of um a planning<br>fallacy according to Daniel cyman um<br>especially um we underestimate the<br>amount of time taken so one thing that<br>we can do to prevent this is if you<br>systematically collect metrics we<br>collect data over time and then if we<br>know that we're constantly<br>underestimating we can add a buffer we<br>can do better okay so that's the first<br>state of taste of research for<br>me and I didn't want to miss out on the<br>industrial experience so after I<br>graduated I um I took up a job in<br>Chennai so I came back to the city of<br>Chennai again and the and the City of<br>Chennai formerly known as medras is well<br>known for its Tech hubs and the<br>Beautiful vegetarian food served on a<br>Banana Leaf which I still miss and and<br>the Chennai Super Kings for those of you<br>interested in cricket okay so it's no<br>well known for all these three<br>things so when I was in Chennai I had<br>two jobs so I had a weekday job and a<br>weekend job um so you can see um Mid<br>Journey has produced beautiful images uh<br>of myself actually it's not um M Journey<br>um some some others um flux Laura model<br>so you can see this it is pretty<br>accurate those of you who actually know<br>me 25 years ago um you know probably<br>look the same but I know that these are<br>not real because I'm not a Mac<br>person and and this hand is not mine you<br>know I I can look at it and say the hand<br>is not mine because this was trrain<br>based on just 12 images okay and I<br>didn't provide anything with my hand um<br>so I know I know it's fake um so I sent<br>it to my sister um and then she<br>immediately said it's fake it's not you<br>okay right so my first job as a software<br>engineer was on diamond processing<br>actually that was quite exciting because<br>I learned something about the domain<br>knowledge and it is an amazing world of<br>diamonds because not many people know<br>that 90% of the world's diamonds are<br>processed in India and it is a really<br>lucrative industry and we were working<br>on automating that industry where you<br>take a diamond Stone and it is usually<br>cut into many pieces<br>and it has amazing properties usually<br>colorless diamonds are the most valuable<br>diamonds if there is some tinge of color<br>that's useless so they processed it into<br>into many chunks and then these Artisans<br>worked on many devices many instruments<br>to polish it and then finally you get a<br>really shiny Diamond so the my first job<br>was in business process automation so we<br>we converted the plant from paper based<br>system into an electronic<br>system and as it was working working as<br>a software engineer about one and a half<br>years into the job we have completed the<br>project but the next project<br>surprisingly was the same project for a<br>different plant so now that we have<br>completed one project they wanted to do<br>the same thing over and over again it<br>made a perfect business sense but it was<br>not exciting for me so I had to make a<br>change so I really like teaching at bits<br>palalani so I was applying for PHD<br>programs everywhere in the world so I<br>got admitted into four different<br>countries<br>but I chose to come to New Zealand the<br>main reason was it had the one Le<br>program that offered software agents so<br>there was a software agent Research<br>Center some of you might know 20 years<br>ago Professor Martin pervis and<br>Professor Steven cranefield um created<br>that Center and I was quite excited<br>because I wanted to do something in<br>software agents I don't think there was<br>a there were a lot of other Australian<br>universities either so all the four<br>programs out of all the four programs<br>this is the only program that attracted<br>me so I came I chose to come here<br>another reason is Professor Steven<br>cranefield because he's quite good in<br>answering my my email so that's that's<br>that's that's the one of the main<br>reasons why I came to otago and I was<br>supervised by these three beautiful<br>people um I really admire them they all<br>have their own strengths um a lot of<br>different strengths so and they became<br>my supervisors and Dr Marian per pervis<br>was my primary supervisor I didn't meet<br>her as a part of my interaction but I<br>met her once I once I um reached here<br>and she has been amazing support thank<br>you Mariam for being<br>here and my PhD topic was on business<br>process modeling surprise surprise it's<br>the same as uh what I started so here is<br>a business process model and it is<br>modeled using a technique called as<br>colored Petr Nets interestingly colored<br>petrinet does not have anything to do<br>with those colors okay um it's a it's a<br>formalism and the my job was to take<br>this peret and then create this agent<br>based system where each of the tasks in<br>green can be encoded as an agent so<br>there are lots of different agents each<br>each agent does it own does its own<br>thing so we're moving from a centralized<br>system to a decentralized system and<br>there are a lot of advantages um for<br>example we don't have a single point of<br>control failure um in terms of a<br>workflow and also we can spawn a lot of<br>different agents and when you have<br>different agents we can solve the<br>problems more efficiently and so on so<br>that was a start of my research but<br>something interesting happened in<br>2006 um something happened before<br>something happened um I wanted to<br>introduce you to the concept of software<br>agents so software agent is a program<br>that acts on behalf of a user or a<br>program so you can think of robots<br>robots are the easiest to understand<br>because robots do something on our<br>behalf there are fight firefighting<br>robots um Rob the industrial robots and<br>so on so these have very interesting<br>characteristics so we have to designed<br>these agents using humanlike<br>characteristics and that appealed a lot<br>to me particularly the social ability<br>ability so Steven went to a conference<br>you we actually shouldn't send academics<br>to conferences because they change<br>topics um so you know uh I'm just joking<br>we should definitely send academics to<br>conferences I'm shooting my own foot<br>here uh so he went to a conference and<br>came back and said said can we actually<br>design agents that are socially capable<br>so you see a robot there shaking hands<br>right but at the start of this lecture I<br>said want I come um so it's a different<br>way of greeting but if you went to Japan<br>there will be a bow so there are social<br>norms and these robots if they're going<br>to live with us um in in any shape or<br>form we have to teach them to be<br>socially capable and that's that was the<br>birth of sociability for me um so I<br>changed my research topic I don't don't<br>think Mariam was very happy sorry Mariam<br>but but I think you got used to it<br>because I was so passionate about it<br>thank you for<br>understanding so sociability is not only<br>the ability of the agent to be friendly<br>it's the ability to for the agent to<br>communicate cooperate and coordinate at<br>the heart of all of this is social<br>Concepts there are a range of social<br>psychological Concepts that we use as<br>humans as humans we are very good with<br>social norms we know what to do what not<br>to do we have values such as honest y<br>Integrity Freedom equality and so on we<br>have reputation systems so we we know<br>what kind of reputation to assign to<br>different people of course we don't say<br>it out aloud but we know certain<br>reputation we have reputation for other<br>people we have the notion of trust we<br>have preferences and so on how do we<br>make all these Concepts computational if<br>you're going to create a software agent<br>that is computational all of these<br>Concepts should be translated into<br>software programs so that's the kind of<br>sociability I'm talking about<br>so as is learning about the social<br>ability some some changes happened in my<br>social world my sister Shala who's been<br>following me all around as I was growing<br>up also decided to join otago um so she<br>also joined the or same research group<br>under um two of the same supervisors as<br>as uh Professor bker noted and while I<br>was working at social norms she was<br>looking at reputation so it was a family<br>Venture we were looking at different<br>social topics<br>and I got married to her best friend she<br>introduced me to Rexy and we got married<br>in 2007 and they get G they got along<br>famously but they gang up upon me so I<br>wouldn't recommend I wouldn't recommend<br>marrying your sister's best friend okay<br>those of you are single please don't do<br>that<br>um and in 2008 my son was born and we<br>are also um quite famous in getting into<br>the newspaper because you know we time<br>things correct right at the right time<br>and he was a Christmas baby so um he<br>appeared in the the<br>newspaper and my sister and I we<br>graduated in 2011 and um one thing I<br>learned on my graduation day was about<br>sibling rivalry so she was she was<br>always behind me and she would always<br>follow me and beat me to it right for<br>example when I was swimming I was 10<br>years old and then I needed a flotation<br>device she did not she just jump jumped<br>into the well and she swam and then when<br>I left the job in the software industry<br>and came to otago she took up the job in<br>my company okay and in otago she came<br>and joined the same research group and<br>she had a scholarship but I didn't okay<br>so she always had this ability to excel<br>in whatever she wanted to do and the and<br>I waited for her to um submit her thesis<br>and fulfill the requirements to graduate<br>so I waited almost for a year so<br>something interesting happened in the<br>graduation ceremony because of the<br>alphabetical ordering she uh graduated<br>first and then she came back to me I bet<br>you on this one too so another lesson<br>don't trust your sisters okay they<br>always have this sibling rivalry and my<br>family grew um so I had two beautiful<br>cuts my daughter Ria and my son Rohan um<br>and my family started growing so<br>paralleling the growth of my social life<br>and my<br>family I grew in these three areas of my<br>research there are three different um<br>branches of my research resarch so I'm<br>interested in socialness in software<br>ecosystems so what are software<br>ecosystems so similar to the Natural<br>ecosystems that we live in where it has<br>some core components like wind um soil<br>and a and water and so on and a set of<br>living um living beings and non-living<br>beings and the interactions there are<br>different kinds of interactions there<br>are social interactions chemical<br>interactions biological interactions<br>similar to those this natural ecosystem<br>I'm interested in software ecosystem of<br>course software ecosystems are<br>artificial and man-made ecosystems at<br>the heart of these ecosystems is<br>software but software is not a solo<br>entity software is made up of other<br>software called libraries and and the<br>software can be part of another piece of<br>software so it's a complex entity the<br>software is not a a siloed entity it is<br>actually um an interconnection of<br>multiple entities and these run on a<br>range of devices and then there are lots<br>of people who are interacting with these<br>these devices<br>and I'm abstracting the the software<br>ecosystem into these three layers at the<br>heart of a um software ecosystem is a<br>software which you see in the center and<br>then you have two other layers um the<br>software development team at the top and<br>the set of uses at the bottom so it's<br>it's an abstraction of a software<br>ecosystem and there are also these<br>interactions between different layers<br>vertical interactions horizontal<br>interactions so this I showed this<br>particular slide to U my son and he said<br>dad what is a Pokeball doing in your uh<br>in your presentation actually it was<br>unintentional I I had no idea that this<br>was a poke ball<br>okay and my interest in software<br>ecosystem is in these three layers in<br>the first layer I'm the the core layer<br>I'm interested in how do we make<br>software more socially capable and in<br>the second layer I'm interested in how<br>what is the socialness among software<br>developers so it's this layer where we<br>have a set of software Developers<br>um interacting with each other and the<br>last part is how can we create software<br>that solves some of the social issues so<br>it targets um the users of the society<br>so in the rest of the talk I'm going to<br>spend time in giving you a glimpse of<br>what I did in all these three different<br>areas so the First theme was on<br>developing socially aware software which<br>ecosystem so these are some motivational<br>scenarios for creating socially aware<br>software in the future there are going<br>to be a lot of different robots in<br>healthcare um in customer service in in<br>education and entertainment and and all<br>of these pieces of software should be<br>socially<br>capable so not only for robots but also<br>for artificial agents such as these<br>avatars there are non-player characters<br>non-player characters can learn from<br>player the regular players the human<br>players for example the norm of<br>cooperation so they are cooperating to<br>fight this um evil dragon together they<br>are defeating the evil dragon there's a<br>norm of cooperation and we also have<br>these smart devices which should be<br>socially capable for example if you have<br>an awkward or a shy teenager that could<br>be a program that helps him or her to be<br>more sociable okay so these are some<br>scenarios um for creating socially aware<br>software so the first question that I<br>asked was how do we develop<br>computational approaches for normative<br>decision making so I'm interested in<br>Show social norms and we all aware of<br>social norms so these are your dos and<br>don'ts um so as we grow up we learn<br>these social norms so some common<br>classical social norms are prohibition<br>norms and obligation Norms so<br>prohibition Norms are those Norms where<br>we say Do not lter the park so don't do<br>something with the obligation you are we<br>are expected to do something you ought<br>to tip a waiter for a good service of<br>course it's not a norm here but it's a<br>cultural norm in the United States and<br>and when these Norms are violated there<br>are<br>sanctions now how can we bring the<br>concept of social norms to software<br>agents how can a robot learn to behave<br>socially for example if there's a robot<br>sitting here how can we program that<br>agent so that it is socially capable so<br>that's that's uh what I have been um<br>interested in the last 18<br>years so we created an architecture um<br>we were the first to propose this Norm<br>identification architecture where it's<br>based on a set of observations if there<br>is a robot sitting here it should be<br>able to infer the norm of this place say<br>for example it must infer that at any<br>point in time there's only one speaker<br>and if you are going to ask a question<br>you're going to put your hand up so can<br>it learn based on these observations so<br>an agent looks at the whole world and<br>observes and then identifies certain<br>certain norms and that's the that's the<br>concept of Norm<br>identification and we designed an<br>architecture I'm not going to go into<br>the detail so this is an AR we we<br>develop an architecture and then<br>Implement software code um that runs<br>this particular architecture so this is<br>based on a set of observations so there<br>are set of events that happen in this um<br>in this environment an agent records all<br>of those interactions as as event<br>episodes and then there are some some<br>special events that happen for example a<br>sanction is a special event when<br>somebody sanctions saying hey don't<br>speak um and so on so there there might<br>be yelling there might be some signals<br>nodding of the had some disapprovals<br>these are sanctions and the sanctions<br>form the basis for Norm identification<br>So based on a set of observations and a<br>set of sanctions um we use a norm engine<br>to identify<br>Norms so prohibition Norms can be<br>identified based on what an agent did<br>and as a result of that action it got<br>sanctioned for example if you're<br>littering you might be<br>sanctioned in an obligation Norm it is<br>the failure to do an action that caus of<br>sanction for example you did not tip<br>therefore you got sanctioned so<br>prohibition norms and obligation Norms<br>are the inverse of each other you can<br>write a in a logical way you can write<br>the same thing in two different<br>ways now I'm going to give you a glimpse<br>of what I did to uh encode this in the<br>context of a software agent let's take<br>this scenario of Park littering um where<br>an agent or a set of people um um are<br>walking in a park and and and they have<br>a sandwich and somebody drops the litter<br>the wrap and then they get<br>sanctioned now I'm I'm using a very<br>simple example which is made up of only<br>three events um so the the first box<br>here shows a set of events that an agent<br>observes so the first observation is an<br>agent a software agent observes the<br>world and what is happening is an agent<br>eats it it it litters and it gets<br>sanctioned okay so it's a very simple<br>model and based on observing all of<br>these particular sanctions then what it<br>does is it does some computation in this<br>case it looks at a window of History so<br>it can look at three events or five<br>events or 100 events U preceding a<br>sanction and then it uses conditional<br>probability so conditional probabilities<br>are amazing because we can we can turn<br>these into numbers and then what comes<br>out is conditional candidate Norms so in<br>this case after uh deliberation after<br>working out conditional probabilities<br>set of candidate Norms come out and when<br>we have a set of candidate Norms we can<br>prune uh certain certain candidate Norms<br>in this case I can prune out all the<br>other all the other events except the<br>littering action that is because<br>whenever we eat there are no not a lot<br>of sanctions associated with the eating<br>action so we can actually eliminate e If<br>you eliminate e we can actually<br>eliminate the sequences e and l e and<br>then we can identify uh the littering<br>Norm so now you might wonder why don't<br>we just give the norm to the agent okay<br>now if you give the norm then that's not<br>a good approach because typically for<br>every action the agent is going to ask<br>you is this a norm is this a norm is<br>this a norm that'll be quite annoying so<br>we need some learning capability where<br>it learns this norm and then it asks the<br>human is this a norm is littering the<br>norm because I have learned it so that's<br>a better approach for Norm<br>identification that's why we started<br>with<br>sanctions so give you another example so<br>this this is an example of obligation<br>Norms so tipping in restaurants um in in<br>tipping in restaurants the sanction<br>happens because tipping did not happen<br>so in prohibition Norms there is<br>evidence for an action that's happened<br>that has happened in the past which is a<br>reason for a sanction but in tipping<br>it's the lack of evidence for a<br>particular action the action did not<br>happen and hence um a sanction happens<br>so it's a little bit more involved so we<br>look at even history based on<br>observations and then we divide it into<br>two different lists those with sanctions<br>and those without sanctions and then<br>based on even sequences that are with<br>sanctions we again work out some<br>conditional probabilities and then we<br>work out um the top the one the events<br>with top probabilities for example in<br>this case an agent pays and it departs<br>but it forgot to tip okay and that is<br>the reason for a sanction so we we know<br>that there is something interesting with<br>this particular even sequence so what we<br>do is we again um do some magic we<br>identify super sequences of PD um the<br>pay and depart the super sequences<br>always include the Tipping action and<br>that's how you identify obligation<br>Norms<br>so we have proposed certain mechanisms<br>which can then be um tried across a wide<br>range of scenarios so I'm going to show<br>you some simulation scenarios where<br>agents identify Norms of course buying a<br>robot is quite expensive probably<br>Brendan knows it it's really really<br>expensive so we resorted to simulation<br>because after all we designing software<br>and we can simulate software okay we<br>don't have to deploy it um um on<br>Hardware so here is a scenario that<br>identification so here are a set of<br>agents that run around and when you see<br>a a square a red square within an agent<br>that ident that actually marks um a norm<br>that has been ident identified this<br>green agent has identified a red NM the<br>red NM corresponds to the prohibition NM<br>so there's one interesting observation<br>when I was doing my this was a part of<br>my PhD work when I was doing this um<br>Steven used to tell me oh that's that's<br>a Taurus it's a toroidal grid um and and<br>it took me a little bit of time to<br>understand what what he was actually<br>referring to so one day I really<br>understood it because it's nothing but<br>my tenite ring remember the tenic covid<br>ring a to toroid is a tenic covid ring<br>the rubber ball which is which is<br>actually it wraps around right in a<br>simulation model you know you wrap this<br>around to the bottom and you wrap this<br>part around on the side so it is<br>actually a ten covid ball okay so<br>there's a link between that game and my<br>simulation so here's another example of<br>um obligation Norms so in this case it<br>was a similation of uh the Tipping Norm<br>being identified there are lots of<br>Agents going and having meal and then<br>they are sanctioned by these blue agents<br>who are the waiter agents and and<br>eventually the norm is identified so<br>most of my work um uses simulations<br>okay so I'll stop it<br>there so that was one approach based on<br>sanctions another approach in real world<br>is we are influenced by others by<br>leaders and then we take up the Norms of<br>the leaders so we developed another<br>approach called a role model based agent<br>mechanism approach where Norms um<br>propagate on a on a network topology so<br>we created an um a simulation panel<br>using a particle collision model when<br>two particles Collide that represents<br>the interaction the more particles the<br>more collisions there are an agent<br>travels faster so it creates different<br>kinds of network topologies these are<br>this is very similar to what um um<br>Professor Peter wigam was talking about<br>in his IPL so we have a mechanism for<br>again creating these Network topologies<br>and then based on these topologies then<br>we see how Norms emerge over time so<br>there was another mechanism um for<br>studying Norms so more recently we have<br>we have been working with colleagues uh<br>from Massi University on the use of<br>large language models so I have to thank<br>Shan he and surangi karunga from Massi<br>uh for this joint work where we've been<br>looking at Social non competence in<br>large language models um this also joint<br>work with Steven um where we found for a<br>very simple problem um the problem of<br>Norm violation detection gbd4 is pretty<br>good um so it identifies in 86% of the<br>cases all the 10 Norms that are violated<br>so we gave Chad GPD 10 different norms<br>and we created stories 80 different<br>stories which had Norm violations and<br>chat chat GPD was pretty good so it was<br>good in most cases but there was a lot<br>of hallucination that we that we did see<br>it was trying to invent more details and<br>we also saw that it was able to identify<br>more prohibition Norms than obligation<br>Norms it is possible because we are you<br>know humans we usually say don't do this<br>don't do that I do that to my kids all<br>the time so possibly there is a bias in<br>the data set<br>um and this has been a prolific area of<br>research we published 45 papers it's<br>widely um many of our papers are highly<br>cited and um many of our papers appear<br>in in survey papers um which talk about<br>this particular field so now we quickly<br>um post some remarks so I have been<br>working in this area for<br>years but still it's a emerging emerging<br>research area one of the reasons is that<br>people work in silos and we often look<br>at only one social concept for example<br>for most of my career I've looked at<br>social norms and Sharma has looked at<br>reputation but we hardly integrated<br>these two and Stephen and I are<br>interested in the concept of trust but<br>we haven't had the opportunity to study<br>trust so what I'm trying to say is there<br>is a wealth of further research that we<br>can we can actually pursue if you<br>combined all of these because humans are<br>so socially intelligent and we are<br>intelligent because of all of these<br>Concepts but in the context of social<br>Computing we need to integrate all of<br>these Concepts to really make agents<br>really um really sociable and there is a<br>lot of scope for interdisciplinary<br>research from sociology psychology um<br>and and even within Computing science<br>because we can integrate Vision we can<br>integrate deep learning and so on now<br>into the second part of um my research<br>so the second part focuses on the<br>socialness of um software development<br>teams so for many of the projects I've<br>worked with associate professor lorish<br>who's here thank you Sherlock for many<br>of the projects U for the collaboration<br>um so we' looked at these rich<br>interactions that happen in software<br>development so one of the one of the uh<br>advantages of working in the software<br>engineering field is the large and Rich<br>data because software development is a<br>social activity there are huge<br>repositories of code who wrote what part<br>of what pieces of code bug repositories<br>email repositories and so on so um there<br>is wealth of data that is available um<br>and we can look into these social<br>interaction data to mine insights so I'm<br>going to highlight a couple of uh<br>projects um from my PhD student um<br>page so here is a mushroom diagram we<br>have created a lots of these mushroom<br>diagrams which are actually interaction<br>diagrams um between developers when they<br>work in different communities so this is<br>the python developer emails so as a part<br>of developing the Python language the<br>developers interact with each other and<br>um there are four different communities<br>and this paper looked at identifying<br>boundary spanners boundary spanners are<br>these uh people who contribute to more<br>than one community so these are<br>significant people um who are<br>responsible for keeping the whole<br>project together so they're responsible<br>for success of these projects and we<br>identified um The prominent boundary<br>spanners who span across all the four<br>communities and we also looked at what<br>happens when somebody leaves um for<br>example if these two people leave Guido<br>W Rossum and um Martin ju Lou if these<br>people leave who should now become the<br>new administrator because these are<br>open-source communities anyone can leave<br>at any point in time so based on the<br>network topologies and also the<br>interaction structures and different<br>centrality metrics we proposed an<br>algorithm um and we found Nick to be a<br>suitable replacement so Nick colan is a<br>um prominent developer from Australia<br>and our algorithm recommended it's Nick<br>so after this project was published um<br>what happened was Guido W rossom who was<br>was known as the benevolent dictator for<br>life he created the Python programming<br>language he resigned so he couldn't just<br>take it anymore so he resigned and in<br>fact Nick colen was chosen as a as a<br>member of the Python steering committee<br>Council so there was a good<br>acknowledgement that our approach worked<br>of course there is only one<br>acknowledgement we really don't know if<br>others leave whether the same mechanism<br>works but this was a good<br>acknowledgement and a second project<br>involved mining hidden decision-making<br>processes so a lot of decision- making<br>process in open source is is actually<br>hidden and they lie hidden in email<br>repositories so here's a process that<br>describes what happens when a decision<br>is being being made in Python to develop<br>a new module so whenever a new module<br>has to be developed they follow this<br>process so initially somebody proposes a<br>draft it gets accepted sometimes it get<br>rejected it moves into the final State<br>when it gets implemented and so on so<br>there are different<br>states and we wanted to investigate is<br>this what really happens this is what<br>they've advertised that that it happens<br>can we actually mind this exact process<br>from data so when we did data mining we<br>found that the process was not exactly<br>the same it was quite different there<br>are new notes there are a lot of<br>connections and so on and things get<br>quickly more complex because we also<br>wanted to study what happens between the<br>draft and the accepted state so what are<br>the decisions that have to be made<br>between a document being in the draft<br>State and the accepted<br>State and it gets really really complex<br>so this is only in the 20% zoom level it<br>was five times more complex than this<br>it's a really really complex process and<br>we use a process called as process<br>mining to extract all the decision-<br>making that happens so page um managed<br>to aggregate some nodes prune some nodes<br>and and he created this beautiful<br>diagram which actually shows the<br>decision-making process in Python and we<br>verified this process by sending this to<br>the python steering steering Council and<br>they said oh that's a beautiful diagram<br>so we we we knew all along this was<br>happening but you know you have made it<br>more explicit so that was an<br>acknowledgement that that we were doing<br>good<br>research so now I'm moving on to the<br>third part of my talk and the third part<br>of my research so this is something that<br>really excites me because here we are<br>working with AI software we creating AI<br>software for solving social issues so<br>this has been motivated by um by Mariam<br>so thank you Mariam I think right from<br>the beginning when I was when I joined<br>um the team and she has always been<br>interested in social issues um so thank<br>you um for inspiring me and the first<br>paper was with my wife and Mariam so we<br>looked at this uh this particular issue<br>that the crime data is not open source<br>so in some countries crime information<br>is available online for example in the<br>UK If you go to UK you can actually find<br>crime maps for every every city every<br>city every road and so on for example<br>are you safe in octagon at 3:00 a.m. on<br>um say a Saturday morning so you can<br>answer those questions and the data lies<br>in newspaper articles so we looked at<br>the Lo newspaper articles and we used a<br>technique called conditional random<br>fields to extract where these crimes<br>happen and then we map it on top of um<br>of a map so this is a useful thing and<br>Rexy found it really useful because she<br>was always scared when I went to a<br>conference she would always say are you<br>safe you know are you know are you<br>walking by yourself so that's that's a<br>good use case um for for this particular<br>project the the second project is the<br>project of jitan who's actually sitting<br>here um jitan was a PhD student and we<br>were interested in offensive language<br>reduction system and this was mainly<br>motivated after the Christ Church um<br>attacks um there's a large amount of<br>offensive language in um in online<br>social media so in this particular<br>project we looked at offensive language<br>in stack Overflow so what he looked at<br>is first of all what kind of offensive<br>language exists um whether it is an<br>offensive language or not when a comment<br>is posted on stack Overflow we can<br>classify whether it is an offensive<br>comment or not and on top of that we can<br>um classify it into different um<br>different types whether it's targeting<br>an individual or whether it's racial or<br>swearing and on top of that we can<br>identify what is offensive we can<br>highlight the words that are an<br>offensive um for example calling someone<br>you idiot and so on and on top of that<br>we can actually rephrase those comments<br>into to non-offensive ones okay so he in<br>his PhD work he looked at a range of<br>machine learning algorithms that can um<br>do all these four activities and for<br>this work um he received except<br>exceptional thesis award and he also<br>developed a software software prototype<br>which can actually do all all of these<br>four and the third project involves<br>reducing data waste so we introduced the<br>concept of data waste and I am guilty of<br>using database and I think many of you<br>may be guilty of um doing the same<br>because I take too many pictures of my<br>children and I also take lots of videos<br>and I not only store in my phone it is<br>stored in the cloud so we produce a huge<br>amount of data wase and in this<br>particular project we looked at uh data<br>wasas in the context of comments um<br>comments for uh app reviews comment for<br>hotel reviews and so on so on the left<br>you have some useful comments because<br>you know what is a problem um in a in an<br>app review on the right you have some<br>comments which which have no<br>informational value calling an app to be<br>dumb app or a total waste or too bad<br>cannot do M much with this it's actually<br>a waste because already this information<br>is captured in the rating because the<br>rating is a mandatory field um if it's<br>really poor um you might get a rating of<br>one out of five so this information is<br>already captured but the comment is not<br>really adding any extra value so it's<br>useless so we developed a set of<br>algorithms um machine learning models<br>and we showed um this problem can be<br>solved and we also Quantified um the<br>sustainability implications so just by<br>Saving um saving these reviews from<br>being produced so if we educate a<br>particular user not to post a particular<br>comment we can actually have substantial<br>savings um just in the app review domain<br>domain alone but I I believe we have a<br>lot of scope for sustainability savings<br>cost Savings Time Savings and CO2<br>emissions if we all decided um not to<br>create data waste so one last project<br>before I finish so this is a project<br>that is quite close to my heart<br>because this is about energy poverty so<br>I saw energy poverty firsthand not only<br>from my parents through their experience<br>I also saw that in my grandparents they<br>didn't have<br>electricity and but I had good time of<br>course I I can't Denay that because I<br>was growing up uh I was just visitor for<br>a month so this is closer to my heart so<br>in New Zealand there are about 100,000<br>households that suffer from energy<br>poverty and this is a fairly recent<br>project where the goal is to identify<br>energy poverty energy poverty is often a<br>hidden problem because people don't want<br>to publicize that they have energy<br>poverty so how can you use artificial<br>intelligence algorithms to detect energy<br>poverty so in this case um in a smaller<br>data set we we could could identify or<br>cluster people with um with the energy<br>poverty and on top of that we could look<br>into behaviors what kind of behaviors<br>are exhibited if they have energy<br>poverty do they turn off water heating<br>do they turn off um space Heating and so<br>on so that's shown by this particular<br>clustering so our goal here is to use AI<br>approaches to somewhat reduce energy<br>poverty can we suggest the time of use<br>for energy can we actually um use energy<br>micr GP can we get cheaper prices from<br>energy micro gits and so on so this is a<br>project that I want to invest more time<br>um in the<br>future so hopefully I have given you a<br>glimpse of all the three areas of my<br>research but the key theme and that<br>underlies all of these three different<br>branches is the ability to be social the<br>ability for a software to be social<br>ability for the software developers to<br>be social ability to create software<br>that can solve social issues so I want<br>to leave you with with some take-home<br>messages so the first message is<br>creating socially aware software is<br>becoming more and more important we<br>going to have a lot of devices that<br>should have this social capability not<br>only robots but also our mobile phones<br>um our smart speakers and so<br>on and in the second branch of my<br>research I looked at the social<br>interaction data there is a large amount<br>of the social interaction data and from<br>this data we can unearth some um key<br>insights for example we can unearth<br>hidden decision-making<br>processes and in the third uh Branch um<br>which is actually closer to my heart it<br>is all about creating software that can<br>solve social issues for example how can<br>we detect and reduce energy poverty and<br>all the three areas are quite exciting<br>to me I do not know what I would<br>prioritize in the future probably work<br>on all these three areas if there is one<br>message that I want all of you to take<br>away it's this one sociability is a key<br>property not only of humans but also<br>software so in the future we are going<br>to create more and more software which<br>is socially capable so with that I have<br>a lot of people to thank first of all I<br>would like to thank my mentors uh<br>Professor Martin pervis who would have<br>really loved to be here um and um Dr<br>Mariam peris and they played an<br>important role shaping my career early<br>on and I would like to thank um<br>Professor Steven Kenfield who has been<br>my mentor and a supporter throughout my<br>career he has been my Champion um at<br>aago so thank you Stephen for being um<br>very supportive throughout my entire<br>career and I and I just realized that I<br>have 98 collaborators I couldn't find<br>all the pictures but you know I would<br>like to really thank all my<br>collaborators um and particularly<br>Sherlock for all the contributions we<br>have published more than 25 papers and<br>interestingly I also saw that I recently<br>noticed that with Martin and maram I<br>published more than 50 papers and with<br>Steven more than 30 papers so they have<br>been subst stantial contributors um so a<br>big thank you and I also want to thank<br>all my PhD and master students their<br>success has been My Success so thank you<br>all um to all all all these students so<br>I want to also thank my honor students<br>and my research students I I can see<br>someone here shamala thank you and to<br>all my colleagues um all the Hodes of<br>information science all the former pbcs<br>of Commerce um all the former colleagues<br>in information science and computer<br>science and my colleagues at the school<br>of computing and associate professor gr<br>dick and the academic party today thank<br>you<br>um and finally I also want to thank not<br>finally I want to thank my parents um<br>who have been my my rock and my<br>supporters um and my family um Rexy uh<br>for your support and for your P patience<br>and for your kindness um and and for all<br>the sacrifices uh for our family and I<br>also want to thank um my children Rohan<br>and Ria um thank you for providing me<br>with the necessary distractions and I<br>also want to thank uh my sister Sharma<br>and and brother-in-law Ruben um and<br>family and also my brother-in-law Robin<br>and<br>family and I also want to thank my<br>prayer group um they have been a<br>substantial part of my journey um I I I<br>I thank them for the spiritual food and<br>also the real good food um that we Shar<br>there at times and finally and most<br>importantly I would like to thank my<br>Lord and Savior Jesus Christ who is the<br>true source of intelligence I've been<br>working with artificial intelligence but<br>I strongly believe it's it's him who who<br>is the source of true<br>intelligence with that I would like to<br>thank you all namii thank you very much<br>and nandri wakam<br>uh Oto Co gr<br>T um before I start professors Tena and<br>Professor seutu C well done well done<br>well done um so hello I'm Grant dick I'm<br>the head of school uh here at the school<br>Computing here at atago uh it's my job<br>now to well it's not really a job it's a<br>privilege and a role<br>uh to give a little context on Tony's<br>talk although I think it was actually<br>very well contextualized um but I also<br>perhaps just very briefly talk a little<br>bit about Tony and his life here at<br>atago um so uh it was mentioned that<br>Tony actually started um in May 2006 and<br>I know exactly the date because it was<br>exactly the same date that I started as<br>a lecturer so uh so I've got a a little<br>bit of a a bond there personally um and<br>also I remember as a PhD student uh the<br>many times we had here here and I'll<br>probably start actually with the<br>discussion here with with Tony as<br>himself okay<br>um Tony has alluded to in his his<br>presentation there many things that have<br>actually shaped his perspective uh<br>including the strong familiar links that<br>are great to see here today so it's<br>great to see everybody here um I don't<br>mean to singular out but I I will anyway<br>our particular interest is shy um as has<br>been mentioned here there is uh uh a<br>bond there of how you have studied and<br>and sort of um worked together um I've<br>put here as perhaps not fully<br>appreciated but I think you fully<br>appreciate the fierce uh sibling rivalry<br>that no no doubt led to both of your<br>successes um from a depart perspective<br>um I'd like to point out that I wasn't<br>actually here for this particular<br>instance but the fact that I know about<br>it tells us about the severity of it um<br>and I've heard that there have been new<br>rules in place uh drafted for the social<br>Cricket of that take place at the at the<br>writing Retreats because the two of you<br>were made captains of opposing teams and<br>couldn't actually resolve<br>anything okay um but more seriously<br>clearly there's a very strong family<br>value um that is is strong within you<br>and uh that that impact has uh really uh<br>impacted on the way that you conduct<br>your day-to-day life and your<br>professional life you are held an<br>extremely high regard by the students um<br>comments as<br>uh Professor Baka alluded to and your<br>and your teaching showing real pastoral<br>care and development to ensure their<br>progress uh and the many reports of<br>bringing Research into your teaching<br>particularly at 100 level in the likes<br>of comp 120 we're doing so is remarkably<br>difficult and anybody knows actually<br>trying to communicate your research at<br>100 level uh to a meaningful standard is<br>very hard and you do that very well so<br>thank you very much for doing that um<br>your strong work ethic is indeed born<br>out in your teaching um I was going to<br>make a joke here about an email that you<br>inadvertently uh hit reply alter instead<br>of reply where you said please don't<br>make me Teach business 116<br>106 in 2012 which I vividly remember um<br>however I can't think of a year since<br>2012 that Tony has not taught in at<br>least one of our large 100 level classes<br>and done so to an outstanding level as<br>again alluded to before uh most<br>importantly I don't remember a single<br>time where Tony has done this with any<br>form of complaint whatsoever and in fact<br>I I'm really not sure I've ever heard a<br>complaint come from you at all so um<br>again your input into these 100 level<br>classes uh and the ongoing sort of<br>development that you do in these classes<br>and so forth is very much welcomed by<br>staff and student alike um certainly<br>from the the students that are taking<br>the papers but the staff that get to<br>benefit from the developments at 200<br>level and the the outcomes from those<br>students at 200 uh when they arrive at<br>200 level and Beyond so thank you Tony<br>um moving on now to service in the<br>information science department in our<br>school of computing uh and the Wier um<br>university the the level is outstanding<br>it's simply<br>outstanding uh there are a few people in<br>the University environment that I<br>believe have understand the subtleties<br>around curriculum and student<br>development as well as Tony does um and<br>I say this from firsthand experience<br>from being on the promotions Committee<br>in Commerce uh the phrase don't worry<br>Tony wrote this was met with several<br>sides of relief on more than one<br>occasion in the when we were there so um<br>in fact I once joked to Tony um I'm<br>officially claiming it was a joke now um<br>but uh at the time maybe not uh that I<br>said he was putting a massive Target on<br>his back because of the quality and<br>attention to detail in his prop<br>promotion uh his proposals uh they were<br>so good that they were making us all<br>look bad and maybe he could tone it down<br>a<br>bit thankfully you didn't listen um so<br>we're very happy about that and as a<br>result Tony has steered and continued to<br>steer the curriculum committee uh<br>curriculum around software engineering<br>at atago uh an Tony is really leading<br>the way to towards making software<br>engineering internationally recognized<br>uh and a flagship program here at<br>atago um there are a few people with the<br>patience and Persistence of Tony to see<br>this through so again thank you very<br>much<br>Tony um I'll keep this short because we<br>all want to uh uh head over to the staff<br>Club in a minute so the last thing I'd<br>really like to reflect on is is um<br>Tony's themes of research and Tony has<br>really put some good detail into his uh<br>into his presentation today again<br>showing your good attention to detail<br>and all these things um but I think by<br>focusing on Norms and and bring bring a<br>social presence into into software Tony<br>really is at the Leading Edge of what is<br>an interesting field uh that warrants<br>closer inspection and bracing by a wider<br>research Community um we race ever<br>closer to autonomous software systems<br>guiding Our Lives um such as chat GPT<br>and related systems uh these systems<br>lack their fully the appre the ability<br>to fully appreciate Norms um customs and<br>expectations of their users and a<br>changing world uh the current approaches<br>that we use of Guard railing require<br>laborious efforts uh staffed by<br>thousands of workers in potentially<br>unsavory circumstances um moreover<br>they're not reactive and they can only<br>be effective and correcting erroneous<br>subsistent Behavior after the fact U the<br>research by Tony and his students really<br>shows promise in in providing true Norm<br>identification and adaptiveness in these<br>systems and for our own sakes I look<br>forward to seeing the continued<br>development of these techniques please<br>keep<br>going so uh with that in mind um it's<br>now my task to invite you all to the<br>staff Club for like ref refreshments and<br>some further discussion with friends and<br>family uh and that will commence at the<br>end of this straight after this so<br>please head over to the staff Club um so<br>in wrapping up uh I present Tony with<br>the customary token of appreciation from<br>all of us uh and as I do please join me<br>in congratulating Professor Tony s</p></main><footer style="margin-top: 2rem; background: #0001; padding: 2rem; text-align: center;"><p>We Are The University</p><ul
