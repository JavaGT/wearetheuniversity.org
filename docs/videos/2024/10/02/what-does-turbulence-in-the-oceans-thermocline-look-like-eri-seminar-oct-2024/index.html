At least, it seems smooth until we zoom in. At the small scales of centimeters to meters—the scales where turbulence dominates—the transition becomes irregular and steppy. To image these scales, we have created so-called ‘swaths’ using moored temperature sensors that sample 50 times a second and that move up and down with surface waves. Being 2D, the swaths provide a new perspective over the much more conventional approach of analysing 1D profiles. To help organise and interpret many thousands of swaths, we jump on the machine learning bandwagon and invoke a convolutional neural network. Taken together, our analyses aim to answer the question of what turbulence looks like in a stratified part of the ocean.<br><br>Biography: Ken Hughes is new to Waikato, having started as Senior Lecturer in July 2024 (previously at Oregon State University).

automatically generated and may not be 100% accurate.</p><p>okay well it looks should I get started<br>okay but looks like we're all here so<br>we'll just get started so I've been<br>asked to introduce Dr Ken Hughes so Ken<br>is a recently recent appointee at the<br>University of the W starting in July I<br>think this year so Ken is originally<br>from New Zealand did uh undergrad and<br>Masters at the University ofargo and<br>then moved over to Victoria that's Toria<br>Canada for a PhD and then after that he<br>did postto and was a research assistant<br>professor at Oregon State University in<br>the<br>US yeah so this is work that I was doing<br>sort of as I was leaving OSU and I had<br>sort of my start date here of July 1 and<br>I was like okay I'm going to get this<br>paper draft done before I leave and it's<br>been at 90% done for the last three<br>months because they haven't really<br>touched it once term finishes I'll be<br>able to get back to it as my plan um and<br>me just do the the last finishing<br>touches uh so yeah oceanographer I like<br>small scale stuff I like<br>turbulence um and this going to be<br>talking about just sort of this almost<br>accidental uh thing I came across that I<br>ended up turning into I think pretty<br>interesting study so the thermline<br>you've got at the equator you get warm<br>water at the surface you get cold water<br>therm is what happens in between it and<br>because it's we talk about layer or<br>stratified ocean it's very stable<br>turbulence is sort of the what's undoing<br>that stability so for the most part it's<br>layer but in turbulence we'll come and<br>churn it up a little bit um and that's<br>what I'm going to try and visualize and<br>ask answer the question what it looks<br>like<br>so I'm going to introduce three things<br>three things you need to know the first<br>one is Calvin Helm Holts below this is<br>sort of the textbook uh instability that<br>you learn if you do any kind of um<br>oceanography and so I'm going to show<br>you this is a picture I'll show you a<br>movie at the top we've got red fluid<br>that's going to be low density in the<br>blue we've got dense dense Earth fluid<br>and those two flows are going to be<br>going in different directions<br>so the low density and high density that<br>wants to keep everything stable the<br>sheer the currents going the different<br>directions that's wants<br>to undo that stability or create some<br>kind of instability which then turns<br>into the SoCal<br>before and it happens really quickly so<br>I'm going to go right back to the start<br>so nothing's happening there the flows<br>are just going in the opposite direction<br>gradient<br>and along that interface because of that<br>Shear you get these uh small<br>instabilities that then quickly turn<br>into big growing<br>instabilities now um a good way to think<br>of instability is sort of like a<br>wave at least the very initial stages<br>when it's kind of this size it's a wave<br>but it's a wave that's getting bigger<br>exponentially so if you've ever been<br>dumb enough to ride down the hill on<br>your bike and you take your hands off<br>the handlebars and you get speed wobbles<br>that's a instability essentially because<br>the wobble start off small and it's not<br>like you just fall over on the side the<br>handlebars wobble a little bit and that<br>wobble gets bigger and bigger and bigger<br>and so that's kind of what's Happening<br>Here it's a wave but it's an<br>exponentially growing wave and soon<br>enough that sort of other stuff takes<br>over bow form like<br>that<br>sensibility and that's kind of what<br>going to be looking for a little<br>bit part um oh it's also as I say<br>literally the textbook example textbook<br>on instabilities this is Calvin Helm<br>Holtz you can see it in the clouds if<br>you're<br>L the second thing I need to introduce<br>you to is where we are or where this<br>study is and it is in the equatorial<br>cold<br>tongs um<br>specifically here at 140° West kind of<br>the middle of nowhere in the<br>ocean but in that color scale is how<br>much heat is<br>being drawn down in the ocean by<br>turbulence effectively from across I<br>think the 22 Dee isotherm so where<br>ultimately warm water is mixing the most<br>with the C cold water beneath it so the<br>group I was part of has spent a lot of<br>time measuring this particular region<br>because as you see there plays a<br>disproportionate role in heat uptake in<br>the<br>ocean and so I've spent you know several<br>decals trying to work out all the<br>details of the turbulence that explains<br>that and here's sort of a a 3D view<br>um you've got as you go<br>west to<br>east um across the<br>Pacific<br>the<br>warm the the depth of where the warm<br>water I guess means the cold water goes<br>up as we go toward the east coast and so<br>we're somewhere in the middle and we're<br>amongst What's called the equatorial<br>undercurrent so that's at the surface<br>the flow is<br>from east to west and then there's a big<br>counter current going from west to east<br>so there's always this big fast current<br>going past the sensors the S the<br>instruments uh that I'll talk about in a<br>moment so that was the second part the<br>third thing I need to tell you is that<br>turbulence the way we measure is mostly<br>just measuring<br>Wiggles<br>uh so we take some sensor typically like<br>a temperature sensor that's measuring<br>really quickly 100 times a second Maybe<br>and you might drop it down you let it<br>fall through the water column at a meter<br>per second or something like that and<br>it's measuring the very high frequency<br>changes in temperature so if you imagine<br>some fluid and it's got cold water here<br>and warm water here and it's stirring<br>around a little bit if you will sample<br>through that you'll measure some kind of<br>fluctuation and if it's turbulent you'll<br>measure lots of big fluctuations if it's<br>not turbulent in this region you won't<br>measure fluctuations so zoom in on them<br>you cut your water column into little<br>like 1 me blocks and you can see there<br>okay this region is turbulent this<br>region<br>isn't then you start to play all these<br>games with turning this into Spectra<br>fitting Spectra and many people write<br>many papers on uh you know how you do<br>this where you should stop where noise<br>comes in whether you should use this<br>picture from 1959 or this other one from<br>1968 um yeah there's a lot of people I<br>think a lot of strong opinions on that<br>I'm kind of more of the opinion close<br>enough is good enough because these<br>things change so much you can clearly<br>see this area very different to that um<br>these Spectra very different they the<br>same shape but one is much higher than<br>the other and we do all of this we come<br>out with a number it's a turbulent<br>dissipation rate and we mix that to a<br>how quickly the ocean is<br>mixing and that's all well and good but<br>it's a very kind of onedimensional<br>picture you're just taking this profile<br>or either that or you're towing<br>something through the water<br>horizontally whichever way you do it<br>you're just getting a onedimensional<br>picture of the ocean so what I was kind<br>of stumbled upon was a way to kind of<br>look at it in two dimensions and I'm I'm<br>hardly the first person to do this so<br>that's my uh sort of picture from the<br>original the title slide that's guess a<br>simulation can imagine you drop<br>something through it or you tow<br>something through that you measure<br>something it tells you this water is<br>turbulent but it's not terribly<br>intuitive<br>um this is a another example you can<br>make things better instead of taking one<br>profile we just take lots and lots of<br>profiles in<br>succession but you've still got just<br>that it's hard to understand sort of<br>what's going on here this is a density<br>profile so anywhere sort of dips back<br>that means you've got dense water above<br>cold water<br>temporarily<br>um and you can go oh yeah there's lots<br>of turbulence in here because of all<br>these overturns and they're<br>gravitationally unstable they're going<br>to fall back and it's going to be<br>turbulent but there's a lot of guess<br>work that goes into it or at least G<br>diminish and this guy th he's got some<br>really good<br>cartoons and if you imagine some kind of<br>billow<br>you know and if you sample right through<br>it you might get this nice sort of s<br>shaped curve and you go oh yeah that's<br>probably an overturn um but you get that<br>same s shaped curve from going through<br>on a slight angle like this the same s<br>shape curve from going on a different<br>shape below and so if you've only got<br>one dimension of this picture you're<br>very much just assuming that you've<br>measured you know you've measured some<br>overturn but you can't<br>say what it is um another thing he did<br>was this is now that horizontal toe and<br>you get something that's just a as I say<br>a bunch of<br>Wiggles um yeah I'm convinced that's<br>turbulence and then his interpretation<br>is okay you know assum it's these<br>Billows and some of them were were<br>breaking some of them were just forming<br>and that's why we've got this<br>picture so I mean I kind of trust trust<br>him because he knows what he's doing but<br>still a lot of just squint and<br>belief um especially when this is what<br>these Billows look like you can see this<br>is an a simulation but if you again if<br>you were to put something vertically<br>through those or horizontally through<br>those it just depends on where you going<br>through it or what time of the event um<br>and you might see this is shape you<br>might see many is shapes so you're like<br>is that multiple individual overturns<br>is that the end EV end consequences Lots<br>uh the end of one big event is broken<br>into many things it's kind of tricky<br>without that TW dimensional<br>picture um also just as inside this 1974<br>picture not that I'm jealous of people<br>who had to do work without computers and<br>all that like modern technology I am<br>jealous of people who could write a two<br>sentence abstract and get it published<br>um nice and simple and to the point I<br>kind of wish we could go back to that<br>maybe a little bit I don't<br>know sorry thorp's name keeps Turing up<br>because he did a lot of work in the 70s<br>in Lo<br>n uh so I'm now going to talk about<br>various ways that people have addressed<br>this problem of we've only got one<br>dimension how do we get a two<br>dimensional picture of the ocean so<br>Thorp went out he put lots of<br>temperature sensors Lots like 12 um<br>maybe a meter half meter apart or meter<br>apart<br>and he did that and he you know measured<br>them I guess as the flow goes<br>past and he saw this temperature thing<br>which looks like kind of a mess but if<br>you convert that into a contour plot you<br>now see if you remember what that Calvin<br>Helm Holt Billow looked like you see<br>these braids where there's lots of<br>density gradient and then that kind of<br>overturning core in the middle so that's<br>kind of a pretty cool picture again it's<br>kind of see it almost if you're in the<br>time you can take that same idea and get<br>much much more elaborate guy Ben Haron<br>his name also turns up many times uh<br>they built this you can see it there um<br>you can see the people's heads for scale<br>down the bottom it's like five arms 100<br>temperature sensors on each arm<br>um and it's all kind of collected and<br>then on the right there's how it ends up<br>when it gets in the ocean you end up<br>with this 100 meter high moing with<br>multiple temperature sensors on there<br>you put that in the deep ocean you go<br>out and find some sea mount or something<br>interesting where lots of cool<br>oceanography going to occur and you end<br>up with these beautiful pictures of this<br>is kind of what I'm used to<br>seeing the ocean at this scale but you<br>can kind of keep you know enhance<br>enhance enhance um and you get down to<br>this picture of this long train of<br>Calvin<br>Hol and another set of pictures he got<br>there just this big overturning kind of<br>like when a rapid forms in a river<br>behind an obstacle gets hydraulic jump<br>same kind of thing is what he's seeing<br>in these pictures so let me just explain<br>the difference the top one is just the<br>temperature he's measuring and the<br>bottom one because I'm going to be doing<br>the same the bottom one is the<br>temperature gradient so the red stuff is<br>where there sharp layers and seeing<br>those layers just helps visualize things<br>better another way to do it is with EOS<br>Sounders<br>um what we're seeing here is nonlinear<br>turn away passing by and there's some<br>instability Waring on that and if you<br>have turbulence in the water column it<br>actually uh scatters sound in a um<br>measurable way just like Z Plankton<br>scatter sound so does turbulence so I<br>think fish and Z Plankton I think these<br>are all fish but what we're mostly<br>focusing on is the braids these high<br>density regions they scatter sound back<br>and we can see this cool physics<br>happening just by bouncing sound<br>um here's another<br>one this<br>is I think this was actually like lean<br>water above muddy water or something<br>like that was what was interesting about<br>this but again you're seeing these<br>braids in the echos Sounder image so<br>these people have seen these Calvin hel<br>inabilities and I get another example in<br>history I<br>forget so all of these people without<br>seeing C cvin hel Holts in in the wild<br>and it's kind of I think of it like a<br>geologist maybe finding a fossil you<br>might not be the first person to find a<br>fossil but finding one of these in the<br>wild is kind of like a writer passage I<br>guess for an oceanographer so I'll show<br>you the one that I found in a moment you<br>can get even more and more elaborate on<br>how you measure two dimensional pictures<br>of the ocean this is a<br>particle image velos<br>symmetry fire um you kind of light up a<br>little square of the<br>ocean 30 cm by 30 cm fire laser at it<br>and track particles as they move I think<br>this is my favorite picture um of<br>turbulence you can very much see all of<br>these edies uh moving around but of<br>course that's just a tiny little square<br>of the ocean and this thing is rather<br>elaborate you can't go out and put it<br>wherever you<br>want these people decided Well maybe you<br>can put it wherever you want you build<br>this one 3 m High big<br>contraction um and I think you let it<br>fall through the water column and you do<br>that same P technique as it's going down<br>very elaborate very cool but of course a<br>lot of effort so<br>I I got one more example of people<br>who have done stuff this is again going<br>back to just let's measure lots and lots<br>of<br>temperatures um this is a float we say<br>float in the ocean even though they most<br>of the time they're not floating on the<br>surface they just at or they're going up<br>and down or they're floating along at<br>some on some surface uh so this one's<br>floating along it's kind of moving up<br>and down slowly with the water and it's<br>got all these temperature sensors and so<br>as it's it's getting some SWA it's this<br>big as the instrument 2 met<br>High um and as like I say it's moving up<br>and down a lot but you can zoom in on<br>these swats there in this case you're<br>not actually seeing turbulence because<br>it's so late<br>the turbulence<br>is subdued for let be the word uh and<br>you were seeing just these layers are<br>slowly scouring and you can make out<br>little tiny um overturns there but that<br>was kind of their story is that we're<br>not seeing turbulence we've measured it<br>very very well but we're not seeing it<br>um so that was kind of cool and I'm<br>showing this one last because theyve got<br>this idea of a swap this 2 m High SWAT<br>and it's moving around I've got a very<br>similar<br>picture so all of these people they've<br>gone to a lot of effort to build<br>something that goes out and measures a<br>two-dimensional picture of the<br>ocean I opportunistically took a data<br>set that from 10 years ago that our<br>group our group's been out in this<br>equator spot for 15 20 years we've got<br>all of these data we've looked at them<br>in the standard one dimensional picture<br>of Imagine Towing something through or<br>the equivalent the flow is going past<br>the sensor um and we do the<br>one-dimensional analysis and that's sort<br>of the bread and butter but and this is<br>what this is called a kod rhymes with<br>iPod because it was built in 2005 and<br>that was um the hot new thing at that<br>time so it's pretty good name a group of<br>pretty good naming stuff I think um it's<br>got this tiny little temperature sensor<br>you can't even see it on the picture<br>because the temperature itself is sort<br>of a little bead on top of what you're<br>seeing there this thing is about a meter<br>high and it's got a temperature sensor<br>at the top temperature sensor at the<br>bottom measuring 100 times a second and<br>there and usually you put this on a<br>moing the moing has something at the<br>surface a big buoy and it the waves Go<br>pass and moves the system up and down<br>you know every time a wave passes things<br>going up and down for the most part<br>that's annoying because we want to tow<br>something horizontal we want<br>equivalently some kind of profile that<br>looks horizontal but really it looks<br>like this uh that's typically annoying<br>and something we try and get rid of um<br>by not dealing with anything from like 3<br>to 15 seconds where the waves<br>dominate but in my case this was what<br>actually made it possible because I've<br>got a temperature sensor here<br>temperature sensor here and the whole<br>system is sort of doing this up and down<br>motion and because the two temperature<br>sensors are sort of the same distance as<br>the movement up and down I'm taking<br>those and there's accelerometers on<br>there so you sort of know where they are<br>in<br>space um that's what this top image is<br>showing there that you've got the<br>vertical position it's going up and down<br>so this whole time it's kind of as you<br>measure the temperature in the position<br>you can get a two-dimensional picture<br>of the ocean um or a swall as I like to<br>call it and so that was what was on the<br>title slide as sort of a schematic of<br>that you're just tracing out a picture<br>and you keep doing this these things are<br>out there for a year at a time um<br>continually doing this and so I made<br>these very very long swats<br>effectively and looked at them and for<br>the most part nothing terribly<br>interesting is happening but every now<br>and again something interesting did<br>happen<br>um oh before I get to that so what I did<br>is I took this what we measure on the<br>two sensors turned it into sort of a<br>gritted two-dimensional product um and<br>got out these swats some of the time<br>I'll show you them in temperature some<br>of the time temp vertical temperature<br>gradient so it's the same picture this<br>bottom one just sort of<br>and as promised here's the Calin Helm<br>Hol bow that I happen to stumble upon<br>you can kind of if you know what you're<br>looking for squint and see it in this<br>picture you can see a bow just poking up<br>and pulling over another one here gets a<br>bit messy in the middle and so that's<br>why if I take the vertical gradient of<br>that it's um we can see those braids<br>that we saw before now I'll admit if<br>you're looking that line that's kind of<br>whatever<br>um I think you need<br>to if you know what you're looking for<br>it's pretty cool it's sort of jumped out<br>to me um and so I made this figure one<br>of the paper and then I wrote the rest<br>example but that's that was a cool<br>example the main story was that most of<br>the time nothing's really happening at<br>least at the dip that I was looking at<br>um so as I say I made these long wide<br>swats and here's what they look like to<br>start with and you don't really see much<br>because we've got such a narrow<br>swath and we've got a sensor at some<br>depth but the background ocean is sort<br>of like moving everything up and down<br>behind it so that swath is not really<br>measuring a fixed volume of water it's<br>just being measuring whatever it happens<br>to see so we need to sort of zoom in and<br>time a little bit so going to zoom in to<br>30 minutes I think yeah there we go this<br>is what our raw records look like um a<br>temperature and what I do is I do all my<br>work to put that into a p tour plot<br>effectively and when I do that I can now<br>start to see the colors of the<br>temperature I can follow particular<br>isorm<br>going up and down so I'm seeing that<br>background water kind of moving up and<br>down past the sensor and I've got that<br>reference thing I can calculate it so I<br>can flatten it all relative to that and<br>I get this new<br>picture and then once I've got that is I<br>can also as I say I calculate those<br>gradients accentuate the layering that<br>we<br>get and I was kind kind of little bit<br>surprised to see this this is one of<br>those things like that's kind of<br>interesting then you realize that people<br>from the 70s and 80s have seen this many<br>many times and wrote papers on it it was<br>a bunch of literature from that time it<br>sort of disappeared I'm not quite sure<br>why still been trying to figure this out<br>um so I'm going to have a bunch of<br>references to 40 50 year old papers they<br>were trying to figure this out but again<br>they had very much this one-dimensional<br>picture of the ocean and so they would<br>you can imagine them putting a a profile<br>through here and they see so it's like a<br>STI very stiffy looking profile is what<br>this is they had all these ideas of why<br>the stiffness arises um some of them are<br>good some of them questionable but by<br>having this now two-dimensional picture<br>of this layered structure you can see<br>that these layers are staying around for<br>a long time and you can kind of track<br>individual layers at least for 30<br>minutes or<br>so so that's one day where there's not<br>much turbulence this is what the<br>background ocean kind of looks like for<br>the most<br>part that was we<br>mixing this is just a picture this is<br>how I now visualize a whole 24 hours um<br>in one day and if you look at this<br>carefully you see all this layering and<br>then right around here I 11: a.m. um on<br>this day here is this splin I'm going to<br>zoom into<br>in a<br>moment uh this one here you see lots and<br>lots of layering and then all of a<br>sudden there's this Miss to it what I'm<br>using the word speckling um and so you<br>can imagine when the turbulence comes on<br>it's all kind of mixing up this is what<br>you see and we see it for in this case<br>12 minutes and then later in the day we<br>see it for sort of 3<br>minutes and so what's cool about that<br>again is like if we have profile one<br>profiles here again we might happen to<br>see one of these or we might miss it but<br>if we've got this long continuous record<br>we get a much different picture of it we<br>can kind of<br>not and in this case there's nothing<br>there's no obvious signat it's just sort<br>of the messiness of it the Kelvin Helm<br>holds inability I'm like okay I know<br>what that is I've seen that in many<br>and speaking of Mery turbulence that was<br>a weak turbulence day the opposite<br>examples when there just turbulence<br>throughout the whole day and you see<br>nothing you just see blue and red this<br>positive and negative values<br>um you can maybe say oh yeah there's<br>more turbulence for this hour there's<br>weaker turbulence and it's modulated<br>somewhat<br>but there's no real there is a a story<br>there um but<br>nothing terribly useful in terms of<br>pictures uh well maybe there is because<br>we've now<br>got I'm going to break this<br>um these 24 hour records well they come<br>in 24 they're a year long and then<br>they're saved as one day and then we're<br>going to f further break them up into 10<br>minute records and so I'm going to end<br>up with a Year's worth of 10 minute long<br>swats so whatever that is 60,000 of<br>these<br>swats and I'm going to check if I've got<br>all of these 60,000 swats can I say<br>something<br>useful or can I relate what the swats<br>look like with what our measured<br>turbulence dissipation is so this our<br>measured turbulence dissipation this is<br>what we had been doing and um<br>calculating for many many years the<br>swats is the new bit that I'm looking at<br>and<br>so here's here's five<br>examples um there's thing at the top is<br>called the bance renals number it's just<br>a measure of how strong the turbulence<br>is and you can look at that and go maybe<br>there's more layering here and there's<br>more spling over here but that's just<br>five examples I've got 60,000 examples<br>how am I going to deal with 60,000<br>examples well maybe I'll try and look at<br>more at once um you know let's look at<br>25 now and they're all ordered and again<br>I'm like okay yeah I can see some kind<br>of progression as I move from left to<br>right here but that's not going to scale<br>to<br>60,000<br>so 54 you can just make out that's full<br>page figure now<br>um so I'm going to jump on the bandwagon<br>like everyone else and<br>we use machine<br>learning um and I'll get to why I did<br>end in particular convolutional neuron<br>networks so a lot of IM image processing<br>or image recognition things you might<br>have heard of typically that's a<br>convolutional neuron Network so if<br>you've got a two-dimensional grided<br>product and image with pixels um those<br>are tend to be the best machine learning<br>tools uh the reason for that is because<br>it can recognize pixels like that are<br>next to each other if they are somehow<br>related it will pick it up and so you<br>split your data set into half of them<br>I'm going to train on I'm going to let<br>the machine learn the patterns and half<br>of that and then I'm going to keep the<br>other half and test on<br>it and if you're particularly interested<br>this is the whole<br>uh way goes through mat lab had a good<br>example on this handwritten digits<br>recognition thing all I did was instead<br>of giving it hand pictures of<br>handwritten digits I just put in my<br>thing<br>instead<br>um and so it's actually pretty<br>simple uh figuring out how to do this<br>not being an expert at all and then I<br>tell it the output is this buoyancy<br>rentals number the measure of turbulence<br>and it goes through all of this stuff<br>this doesn't take long takes like five<br>minutes on a laptop because these are<br>pretty small images pretty small data<br>set by modern machine learning<br>standards does it work uh pretty much on<br>the bottom is so this is now my test<br>data set the stuff that the machine<br>hasn't seen when it's training on the<br>bottom is what we<br>measured uh with the kod this Bo rals<br>number and on the right is what the<br>neuron Network predicted based<br>on it's<br>seeing what the image was that was given<br>and it's got it follows this one to one<br>line very well it's got plus or minus<br>order of magnitude um so it's not the<br>best but when I sort of eyeball that and<br>I was looking at those pictures like 25<br>or 50 at a time I could see that same<br>uncertainty we go back to<br>that on the as I move through a column<br>each of this<br>is one order of magnitude and I can look<br>at the left hand side and go oh they all<br>about the same I move over a column and<br>I can maybe make<br>out um some difference but you can<br>certainly see as you move from 0.1 to<br>one up to 10 it's like okay now I'm<br>starting to see some spling I'm starting<br>to see some messiness some turbulence um<br>but it's still the dominant picture is<br>still the layering once I get over here<br>to the right columns yeah it's<br>definitely turbulent the layerings<br>almost<br>disappeared and so that order of<br>magnitude I'm like yeah I agree that<br>these things are meaningful to that<br>level if I move down the rows though<br>that's like a now much finer grain it's<br>like one two three the differences<br>between the rows is what I can't make<br>them out and so I sort of trust that the<br>machine has learned this order of<br>magnitude accuracy and it agrees with<br>what I see when I'm just eyeballing<br>these things<br>there and so if<br>you're interested in if you're like me<br>and yeah well I was actually during Co I<br>was at home I'm like I should learn this<br>whole machine learning thing um so I<br>don't get left behind this was prior to<br>C GPT becoming a houshold name I like I<br>should Lun this so I jumped on started<br>doing some python tutorials did the<br>whole neural network calculus derivation<br>for first principles it was interesting<br>I might have lasted a couple of weeks um<br>with this Grand ambition then I sort of<br>gave up because I didn't have a<br>particular problem to work on as just<br>doing kbook problems then I ended up<br>coming back to it largely bya this and<br>have learned a lot along the way just<br>having a particular problem to work<br>on but for this one there's five I kind<br>of found five reasons why it work<br>particularly well one is that I had this<br>problem where I can ignore conservation<br>laws so if you're a fluid dynamics<br>person you know that you can't violate<br>conservation laws what goes in must come<br>out whether that's mess energy heat Etc<br>um anything that disobeys conservation<br>laws are going to be like not sure about<br>that but this one all I've done is taken<br>a picture of turbulence and got a number<br>out so I don't need to worry is momentum<br>conserved or anything whereas other<br>people who are<br>using neural networks to like put into<br>Ocean Models they have to be very<br>careful that they are getting the<br>correct answer that it all comes out to<br>you know everything's conserved so they<br>often do a lot of work they might like<br>manipulate the training or they<br>manipulate the answer at the end and it<br>can be a whole involved process for me<br>it was a nice easy thing and I could<br>take it input get an output and that was<br>all good second one is a small training<br>set like I say 60,000 images might sound<br>like a not but it's really not a lot 5<br>minutes on the laptop in fact in doing<br>this I finally worked out how my laptop<br>GPU Works um as you know gpus are better<br>for machine learning um so that was kind<br>of cool<br>random um byproduct there it's like 5<br>minutes versus 30 minutes of it's<br>running on CPU so it's a little bit<br>faster but 5 minutes is great for a<br>workflow it's not like I had to run it<br>come back the next day see what happened<br>like I'm used to doing with my Ocean<br>Models also if it took a couple of days<br>I probably would have not got over the<br>learning hump and I wouldn't have got<br>around to it um so was a good entry<br>point for that kind<br>of part the gritted<br>observations<br>um as I say I turn this you know these<br>raw measurements into this image of<br>2D thing with pixels really<br>helped fourth one the data sets already<br>labeled so I was kind of cheating a<br>little bit and I make the swats and they<br>have associated with them this buoyancy<br>Reynolds number now that buoyancy<br>Reynolds number actually comes from the<br>same temperature sensors that I'm<br>calculating the swats from so it's a<br>little bit circular but that's fine but<br>so when I'm saying that already labeled<br>is that I've got these inputs images and<br>I've got the buyy Reynolds numbers which<br>is the labels so I've got the inputs and<br>the<br>outputs<br>whereas I've got biological<br>oceanography colleagues that OSU they<br>were developing this um plank in<br>imaging uh and so they would take lots<br>and lots of images of Plankton and they<br>would use machine learning to authentify<br>them again convolutional new network but<br>they has a lot of manual labor up front<br>like theyve got I think was 100 species<br>of pton 40,000 images and someone's got<br>to manually go and label all those and<br>get and right so that's a lot of effort<br>avoiding that step is pretty handy and<br>dimensionality I've got a 2D image and<br>my output is a single<br>number many machine learning things the<br>output is just as sort of complicated as<br>the input if I had a input image and an<br>output image then I'd quickly get into<br>this multidimensional space because of<br>only got one number as the output it's<br>very easy to organize things I showing<br>you the like the rows and the columns<br>but I can just look at a page and even<br>if there's 50 I can look at that eyeball<br>that and look at 50 samples at the same<br>time because it's just onedimensional so<br>that made it kind of<br>easy the other takeaway was well how<br>come I showed you that one<br>stability below that was my sort of one<br>finding I looked through the rest of the<br>year and I couldn't find it I found<br>another set I was like kind of but I<br>wasn't convinced enough to put it in the<br>paper um so why were there so few of<br>those when I was showing you all those<br>early examples when people are seeing<br>them and it's because they they only<br>really form in<br>certain<br>situations um this is well<br>this is the top 150 M of the equatorial<br>ocean and this number when it turns sort<br>of yellow and red that means the ocean<br>is susceptible to these instabilities in<br>this particular case set this sensor<br>that I was looking at was down here in<br>the blue so for the most part I'm in a<br>region where I'd expect lots of layering<br>and not much of these Billows and only<br>see the Billows on<br>occasion so that's not surprising<br>another reason might be that we get as<br>oceanographers a little bit um caught up<br>in the idea of this Calvin Helm holon<br>ability because it is so nice and neat<br>and has this beautiful<br>structure but if you remember back to<br>that video showed we started off with<br>this perfectly stable like sharp<br>gradient between the red flow and the<br>blue flow um the ocean's always got some<br>background pre-existing messiness to it<br>and so what this paper showed was here's<br>the textbook<br>examples when you start off with some<br>quent background here's the much much<br>missier situation and if you start off<br>with a<br>miss<br>that clean instability can't form<br>because all this background stuff is<br>just stirring it around so there's a<br>good chance that<br>um we are sort of just the reality is<br>the ocean is just Missy um and so we<br>don't see these below except on these<br>very rare occasions when something just<br>happens that they come out nice and<br>cleanly or it could be the even more<br>complicated cases the ocean is in this<br>layered and isotropic stratified<br>turbulence there's a whole bunch of<br>papers recently trying to understand if<br>you take a stratified fluid and you<br>impose some turbulence on it what does<br>it look like you can throw a lot of<br>computing power at it and get this kind<br>of picture I was kind of hoping i' get<br>some pictures that look a little bit<br>like this my resolution is not quite<br>good<br>enough that was me to be<br>earlier so I'm going to finish there and<br>I'm going to leave up as I say my uh<br>favorite piece there which is my<br>beautiful fellow and hopefully I've<br>convinced you that it's more beautiful<br>than it might have looked like from the<br>outset<br>well be under<br>here I'll have<br>a how do you know your equipment doesn't<br>cause the<br>turbance so my post off visor has spent<br>a lot of time on that and so you build<br>it with a vein just like a wind vein<br>will always<br>turn so it's always facing into the flow<br>and he's got this great story where they<br>had to work out if you have it on a<br>Waring cable um it requires some kind of<br>talk you know the current will have to<br>turn it and it require some amount of<br>talk and the cable has got some tortion<br>or whatever that's GNA so he got two<br>goes um like tied it got them more in<br>line tied it and they fig somehow<br>figured out how much P would be required<br>and equated there to like how much<br>current speed was and there's an ongoing<br>discussion in our group we've got<br>different opinions on how much current<br>speed you actually need before it turns<br>into flow fortunately in this case the<br>current's always racing p in that uh One<br>Direction um but yeah definitely it can<br>be an issue in the slow flows that it<br>doesn't actually and you are just<br>measuring the wake and I've done a lot<br>of stuff when you're on ships you like<br>the stuff of the top you can't measure<br>because you're just measuring what<br>I have two questions the first one is<br>related to the instrument so so this is<br>this doesn't walk the wire right is it a<br>fixed dep fix so how did you determine<br>the the depth you deployed it<br>at the first thing is you just get it<br>approximately the right place when you<br>put it out there um and then you get the<br>pressure measurement tells you how much<br>and often you get the instrument back<br>and not not much of this mors but a lot<br>of Moorings you'll find that the whole<br>moing gets blown way over and the<br>pressure it will be like was going to be<br>at 100 m it's all of a sudden at 300 M<br>like this when it gets in currence these<br>instruments can do crazy things and it's<br>only measuring the pre you realize just<br>how much force can be acting on some of<br>these Ms I feel like yeah and that's why<br>I was wondering why it doesn't why it<br>doesn't walk the wire right then that<br>means cuz cuz right now you're sort of<br>limited to a 3 m SWAT right but if it's<br>a Walker knowing that there a lot more<br>power to do that or if you just have<br>multiple instruments on a string why was<br>one so what we usually do is we'll have<br>a moing we'll put five or six in the top<br>100 met and with that you get you know<br>Point measurements and you get some<br>course profile as you're implying um<br>but it was never designed for this kind<br>of thing i' I've sort of written in the<br>paper maybe we should plant like five of<br>them right next to each other instead of<br>a 2 met swap we'll get a 10 met swap I<br>think that would be really cool um and<br>there is some history of people going<br>out and doing just that well I think I<br>showed one of them you know you just put<br>lots and lots of sensors the wire Walker<br>concept doesn't work as well for<br>turbulence just because then you're<br>adding a whole bunch of vibration into<br>the system and then the next question<br>kind of comes back is how are you not<br>just measuring how do you know you're<br>measuring turbulence in the or as<br>opposed to something<br>else second question sorry um the<br>machine learning part so so basically<br>what your your labels were not generated<br>by human interpretation this is<br>basically generated through a<br>mathematical transformation of the data<br>so to me just being very critical right<br>that per correlation represents the fact<br>that the equation is pretty good at<br>ignoring the noise right and taking your<br>your data set into a single transforming<br>into a single number because not all<br>equations do that some equations<br>generate randoms right so that wouldn't<br>you say that your restri learning<br>results is more of a predict more of a<br>validation of the robustness of the the<br>way you um quantify right the the<br>turbulence characteristics as opposed to<br>a real sort of external<br>validation of the data set yeah it's<br>very much a internal consistency kind of<br>proof and I spent a lot of time I can't<br>even remember if I still need to do the<br>word smithing on how I'm going to write<br>this in the paper like yeah I agree it's<br>not some external validation or<br>different independent data set which<br>would be really nice but probably make<br>things more confusing um and so that's<br>why I went I threw out words like<br>exploratory and opportunistic and all<br>these kind of things in the paper just<br>to make temper down expectations and<br>so similar in a similar event<br>um and excuse my naivity why isn't it<br>why can't it be done in a<br>three-dimensional<br>space if you so to do it in a<br>three-dimensional space So currently<br>we've got<br>senses it's like we've got the vertical<br>and then we got the flow past that<br>creates two Dimensions to get the third<br>dimension we sort of need like a bunch I<br>guess of temper we need like a 2d array<br>of temperature sensors plus the flow<br>through to get a third dimension which<br>would be very cool um imagine people<br>probably try to do something like it but<br>oceanographers like to stick stick to<br>their low dimensionality modelers love<br>like taking models you get 4 XYZ and T<br>um and that's all very nice and useful<br>but observationalist we stick down to<br>one of two these two degrees two<br>Dimensions<br>Max so even though that is the case did<br>you play it all with the third dimension<br>like go um further south from where you<br>were just in one place and see whether<br>it was similar what you were getting<br>surely you attempted to do that I've not<br>no I've not attempted that's on the<br>I'm taking the approach of I'm going to<br>I've got the one data set that I've done<br>well I'm going to write the paper and<br>I'm not going to touch any other data<br>set else I'll get end up on a you know<br>rabbit hole and not get around to<br>cleaning up and finishing this one so I<br>want to get the the paper done and then<br>say okay this is our method and then we<br>can go ahead and apply it before I end<br>up not finishing project number one<br>we have any online nothing nothing in<br>the chat no I'll ask my less a question<br>than a suggestion so perhaps another<br>thing to do is to do unsupervised<br>learning right and just see what falls<br>out because because it seems to me that<br>there's a lot more you could do with<br>this data set uh and of course we have<br>people who are very good at unpress<br>learning good opportunities to what do<br>you mean a lot more you can do with this<br>data set well so right now we're you can<br>what what we can try and find out is<br>whether there's dial pattern for example<br>right in in the in the um vertical<br>structure of of the T radi because right<br>now that's not really I mean you can do<br>that need machine learning to find that<br>out I mean we have so many beautiful<br>methods with the time series to do that<br>you wouldn't need any machine yeah but<br>you could you could also um I don't know<br>to me because the red number is a very<br>good one as you have demonstrated right<br>I'm just wondering right because the the<br>cost of doing un supervised learning is<br>now so low right right it's it's like a<br>days work basically try<br>my argument against that would be that<br>this is sort of like the lazy machine<br>learning is the lazy way to do it I<br>guess you know with one dimensional<br>we've got all these Spectra all these<br>methods with all the analytical<br>formula isn't sort of the equivalent for<br>two dimensions and I'm like if there's<br>not an existing model for what a two-<br>dimensional thing should look like I'm<br>going to be lazy I'm going to throw it<br>in and see if there is any pattern the<br>supervised learning would be taking that<br>even further and saying just find Meed<br>up but then you've got to go two steps<br>back to what is the underlying physics<br>and so I haven't got around to the<br>question of is there physical or is<br>there like mathematical forms that I can<br>put to this that explains the pictures<br>the same way that the model is seeing<br>them because this is somewhat<br>unsatisfying yes it works but like any<br>machine learning it's Black Box we don't<br>necessarily know why it works so this<br>was just to prove that there is skill in<br>the image but i' much prefer to be down<br>this end of the I can also give it a<br>mathematical formula just in this case I<br>didn't want to do it all that work yeah<br>no I see that I totally see that so<br>that's why you guys are being defensive<br>because you like to be able to explain<br>things with physics whereas I'm being a<br>biologist I'm just trying to find the<br>pattern first when working on the<br>mechanism<br>later but I don't know what more<br>you expect to see extreme events for<br>example right so machine learning um<br>what there but that just comes out in<br>the dissipation<br>rate essentially yeah I've done other<br>stuff with a colleague who's doing other<br>kod machine learning things and he's<br>he's dealing with all the extreme cases<br>and trying to figure all that M out it<br>that ends up being you spend as much<br>time trying to understand all the what<br>it's learned and maybe I'm just saying<br>the same thing um yeah well okay so it<br>sounds like somebody's already doing it<br>so yeah people are doing it especially<br>with models we've got the three<br>dimensions and there's so many more<br>degrees of freedom um looking for can<br>you<br>explain or get things right based on<br>patterns that we don't usually look<br>for I thought the layering that was um<br>kind evidence from your data looked very<br>interesting I was trying to think of<br>what it might um what where it might be<br>coming from<br>and um whether or not there was some<br>periodicity so the um what is really<br>showing because in the derivative um<br>there's some oscillation and maybe that<br>is a periodicity that your data um plus<br>some machine learning maybe that made it<br>easier um could reveal and that would be<br>interesting for me unexpected yeah yeah<br>the layering is like I I briefly said it<br>these papers from the 70s and ' 80s they<br>tried to come up with theories and they<br>tried to explain this irregular steiness<br>of it um and yeah it's got oscillations<br>you can see the background it yeah I<br>wish I could figure it out but I'm not<br>sure how much I will learn in doing<br>so<br>um all<br>right yes well that's thank K again<br>well</p></main><footer style="margin-top: 2rem; background: #0001; padding: 2rem; text-align: center;"><p>We Are The University</p><ul style="list-style-type: none; padding: 0; margin:
