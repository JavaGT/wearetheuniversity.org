people of this<br>place and welcome you<br>here uh<br>t t to tanu to tanu to the house that<br>stands here greetings may you stand<br>forever um but in case of an emergency<br>and that may be under threat uh please<br>use the exits provided uh or an an<br>hold and let's remember at this time<br>Richard Tak so greetings everyone I'm<br>Richard Blakey Deputy Vice Chancellor<br>research and Enterprise University of<br>Vago and it's my great pleasure and<br>privilege to be welcoming you you here<br>tonight for this inaugural professorial<br>lecture where we celebrate the promotion<br>to the position of Professor of uh Peter<br>wigam um the order of proceedings is<br>quite straightforward we are all here<br>for the main event uh but uh we do want<br>to uh make sure we get the best out of<br>our regalia and our and our and our<br>Celebrations by having a number of<br>people in the academic party taroto uh<br>having various roles uh we will have an<br>introduction by the uh provis chancell<br>division of Commerce Professor Marie Ty<br>we'll have the main event and we'll have<br>a vote of thanks at the end before we<br>get uh invited to the staff club uh for<br>some refreshments so welcome here<br>everyone uh welcome to uh members of the<br>university community welcome to special<br>guests of our uh speaker both in person<br>and online I think some of those special<br>welcomes will be made uh ma made next<br>but um what my U role is is both to<br>congratulate Peter on his most<br>well-deserved promotion but also to give<br>you a little bit of an indication of how<br>special this is a promotion to the<br>position of Professor is the peak<br>academic promotion at this in any<br>University and we take the the the<br>process very very seriously we do<br>require that um the<br>um criteria are met for excellence in<br>research teaching and Service uh and<br>that is benchmarked by uh the use of<br>international referees it's not just um<br>excellence in specific time limited<br>areas but it's needs to be sustained<br>over significant periods Marie will tell<br>you a little bit more about Peter's um<br>um career and where he is Excel but in<br>reviewing the CV I could see that um we<br>have a a very uh clear case for<br>promotion here that<br>um teaching as it been at the highest<br>standard research has been highly<br>collaborative and uh collegial and<br>service has been multifold uh Peter was<br>um nominated for USA Awards lecturing<br>and supervising so both at undergraduate<br>and graduate research levels and there<br>is a specific indicator that to me talks<br>about how wide and extensive his<br>collaborations are he has collaborated<br>in PhD supervision supervising I think<br>29 doctoral students with members both<br>within and outside the university but<br>within the university other<br>collaborators have been from all four of<br>our academic divisions that is highly<br>unusual I I've invented an index that<br>I'm going to call the wigam index<br>because the number of of unique<br>supervisors for his 29 PhD students is<br>32 so that's an that's a ratio of more<br>than one that's a 32 divid 29 is 1.1 and<br>so anyone with a wigam index of more<br>than one is a highly collaborative and<br>sought-after uh supervisor so<br>congratulations on um getting the<br>highest wigam index uh of anyone in the<br>world today uh Peter and in particular<br>congratulations on behalf of the<br>university for your most welld deserved<br>promotion well done thank you very<br>much Professor Blake<br>T Professor Baka T associate professor d<br>t and Professor wigam<br>tqu<br>disley<br>Tama Colin Len Zara and extended Foo and<br>friends<br>denoto friends and colleagues denoto Oto<br>otoo cor Marie T tooa I have the<br>distinct<br>privilege and pleasure of being the pro<br>Vice Chancellor of Tula pakahi which is<br>the division of Commerce and that is the<br>division which professor wigam in his<br>Department of information science was<br>housed for 22 years and it is my<br>absolute pleasure to warmly welcome you<br>all here today for Professor Peter WAMS<br>inaugural professorial<br>lecture now Peter and I were discussing<br>this event earlier this week Peter<br>insisted that I did not spend long in<br>preparing for the introduction and in<br>true Peter style he said I could just<br>make something up and probably Wing<br>It Well Peter I'm not actually sure that<br>I could make this<br>up your remarkable achievements and<br>contribution to Academia The Wider<br>Community are actual facts which<br>rightfully have been acknowledged by<br>this very well-deserved deserved<br>promotion and indeed it was a slam<br>dunk Professor wigam received his PhD<br>from the University of South Wales after<br>which he continued his work in<br>Australia's Commonwealth scientific and<br>Industrial research organization as an<br>experimental<br>scientist his early research focused on<br>developing Innovative com computational<br>methods and models to better understand<br>ecological systems leading to an<br>exploration of a fundamental question<br>what is the best way to describe and<br>model spatial and temporal<br>processes this question has remained<br>Central to Peter's research driving his<br>curiosity and leading to the development<br>of an evolutionary algorithm that<br>explores sentence structure defined by<br>grammar a model now widely used in the<br>field of genetic programming<br>Peter's moved to New Zealand and the<br>University of atago in<br>1999 marked the beginning of a<br>significant chapter in his academic<br>Journey since joining us he has<br>continued to push the boundaries of<br>computational modeling applying his<br>expertise to a vast array of fields<br>including ecology economics Public<br>Health Medicine geography anatomy and<br>structural biology<br>his work has transformed how we approach<br>problems in both natural and social<br>sciences offering new insights and<br>methodologies to tackle some of the most<br>complex questions in these<br>fields Peter is a true multidisciplinary<br>researcher collaborating with experts in<br>a wide variety of fields from surveying<br>and design to botony zoology and even<br>adolescent sleep<br>studies his current work on on satellite<br>methods to detect methane emissions for<br>example as a cuttingedge project with<br>far-reaching implications for<br>agriculture and climate science<br>reflecting his ability to apply<br>computational models to real world<br>problems that matter on a global<br>scale at its core Peter's research is<br>about understanding complex systems<br>whether they be ecological economic or<br>biological<br>and using that understanding to improve<br>the world around<br>us in a time when Global challenges such<br>as climate change Public Health crisis<br>and economic instability require<br>innovative solutions Peter's work<br>provides powerful examples of how<br>computational models can be used to<br>address these urgent<br>issues Peter is a prolific publisher of<br>his research 58 Journal articles<br>and 64 refereed conference papers and he<br>has been awarded significant research<br>funding including six million MB<br>research<br>fund Beyond his research Peter has made<br>an indelible impact as an educator he<br>has supervised as we've heard 29 PhD<br>students including people in this<br>room and continues to publish with a<br>significant number of them his<br>commitment to Super vision and teaching<br>Excellence is obvious not only in the<br>number and variety of supervisions but<br>also in the amount of teaching that he<br>has been involved in as we've heard<br>Peter has been recognized with numerous<br>teaching Awards including two US USA top<br>10 teaching Awards and has been<br>nominated for two USA supervision Awards<br>supervisor of the Year Awards I should<br>say these awards are a testament to his<br>dedication for his students his passion<br>for teaching and his ability to<br>communicate complex ideas in a way that<br>inspires curiosity and<br>understanding one of the qualities that<br>truly sets ped apart is his ability to<br>make research accessible and applicable<br>he has not only excelled in the academic<br>circles but has also fostered strong<br>connections with<br>industry his collaborations with<br>companies such as silver Fern farms and<br>ADI instruments have provided practical<br>solutions to real world<br>challenges demonstrating how academic<br>research can be translated into<br>meaningful societal<br>impact whether it's optimizing business<br>processes or developing Innovative tools<br>for healthcare Peter's work Bridges the<br>gap between theory and practice ensuring<br>that the benefits of his research extend<br>university Peter's collaborations are<br>not only multidisciplinary but they also<br>span the globe from Partnerships with<br>the University of Illinois and the<br>University of Arkansas to his work with<br>organizations such as the environmental<br>defense fund and Global meane<br>Hub in addition to his academic<br>achievements Peter has made a<br>significant contribution to the<br>University of atago through his service<br>and Leadership roles as a key figure in<br>the school of computing he is actively<br>helping to shape its direction<br>Peter's cross discipline interests are<br>reflected also in his University Service<br>roles not only does he commit to service<br>roles in his school through divisional<br>board teaching and learning committees<br>and promotions committees but he spans<br>the divisions and the university with<br>his service roles enrolls on the<br>interdivisional undergraduate Board of<br>studies the chair of the ecology Board<br>of studies the chair of the e- research<br>Advisory Group group working party<br>member on Environmental Studies<br>University Research committee the uwalk<br>panel member and a senate<br>member having had the privilege to work<br>with Peter especially for the last two<br>years on our Commerce divisional board I<br>can honestly say that this is a<br>colleague whom is always ready with a<br>wise word a statement or a piece of<br>advice and who certainly keeps me on my<br>toes in any committee<br>meeting Peter Peter's knowledge of<br>various disciplines is vast and I am<br>always grateful to be able to tap into<br>it as we have heard a promotion to full<br>professor at the University of atago is<br>not a step taken lightly you must excel<br>in all three areas of the role teaching<br>research and service Peter wigam has<br>gone above and beyond in all three and<br>his work continues to inspire students<br>colleagues and collaborators<br>alike like many others I feel privileged<br>to work alongside professor wigam and I<br>am delighted to be able to warmly<br>welcome him up right now for his anoral<br>professorial lecture please welcome<br>uh<br>k<br>m<br>kto Mo tari<br>welcome the language of<br>models I should start by saying for the<br>people online Kiora to those in New<br>Zealand Kiora South America Kiora Canada<br>Australia the language of<br>models models broadly can be two types<br>you can build a scale<br>model and then test that in such things<br>as the physical environment or you can<br>build theoretical models computational<br>models I am definitely in the world of<br>computational models and here's<br>f<br>questions so and don't be fooled I<br>didn't build the Sterling engine<br>myself so I'm clearly someone who works<br>in computational methods uh they might<br>be mathematical they might be simulation<br>models we've done quite a lot of work in<br>these areas so this is a simulation<br>model of speciation over a food web uh<br>and structured in space but the main<br>area I work in is in using data and<br>understanding the properties of data and<br>this is the kind of flow chart of my<br>world so here's the real world or<br>there's some process in the real world<br>that I'm interested in understanding and<br>it's interesting to remember that you<br>start by sampling this world this is a<br>complex world that needs to be sampled<br>and there are assumptions in the way you<br>sample and there's simplifications of<br>course because you cannot represent all<br>of the complexity that's here but you<br>ultimately end up with a set of data and<br>from that you build a model of some sort<br>and that model could be just about the<br>properties of the the data it could be<br>because you're going to build a<br>simulation or perhaps you're going to<br>use it for prediction but either way the<br>most important aspect of any model is<br>that you want to be able to explain and<br>understand confirm hypotheses Test new<br>ideas related back to that initial<br>process that you were<br>sampling and this is really the world<br>that I like to live in and you might<br>think well that's going to mean<br>complicated models are the only way we<br>learn interesting<br>things and that's just not true here is<br>perhaps the most famous straight line<br>ever<br>drawn okay 1929 Edwin Hubble had<br>collected enough data on the distance to<br>Stellar objects through Lumosity and the<br>velocity of Stellar objects through red<br>shift think of it as Doppler shift for<br>light and from that he could draw a<br>straight line it was velocity given some<br>slope times distance and so beta 1 is<br>the gradient slope of this line a single<br>straight line allowed him to infer that<br>perhaps the universe was expanding<br>remember that took another 40 years<br>before that was settled but more<br>importantly he could calculate the age<br>of the universe and with the data he had<br>he came up with about 12.6 or 12.8<br>billion years which is just<br>extraordinary from the time it was made<br>in the quality of the data the thing to<br>remember is it was a straight line so<br>you do not need complex models to make<br>important decisions and uh important<br>knowledge very brief bit of uh history<br>so I did my undergraduate Bachelor of<br>honors degree and finished in 1983 at at<br>the Australian National University uh<br>after that I worked as a tutor I had a<br>business with two colleagues John bishop<br>and noville hope they were fantastic<br>people John taught me how to program uh<br>we would have been a great business but<br>we could not manage ourselves and<br>eventually this is serious unfortunately<br>and then eventually I joined<br>CSO um I I was in the same division<br>for the entire career of 12 years or so<br>what's interesting is that it started or<br>here are the three names at some point<br>we were the Division of Water Resources<br>then we were the division of water and<br>land and then as a final twist that no<br>one saw coming we were the division of<br>water it was an interesting place to<br>work I can tell you but uh during that<br>time uh I published a paper in 1990 we<br>were working on Expert systems these are<br>very simple ideas popular in the 80s if<br>I don't have a great deal of data and I<br>want to model a system well I'll go and<br>talk to an expert hello Richard and he<br>will tell me some information and I can<br>write out say a set of rules that<br>describe the process he's interested in<br>and I can then put that in a computer<br>and I can model it I can do simulations<br>I can do<br>predictions uh we were interested in<br>largely ecological systems and certainly<br>Geographic systems we were interested in<br>how space worked and so we developed a<br>uh spatial expert system and you can see<br>here's a grammar that describes the<br>language of space and this allowed us to<br>write rules that talked about how the<br>world interacted in a spatial sense and<br>how elements in space could talk to each<br>other and how that influence those<br>processes and it was quite excuse<br>me it was quite a successful quite a<br>quite a um successful<br>model uh our my favorite application was<br>that we worked with the Army at Paka<br>panel at the training range and we<br>modeled uh armored vehicle movement uh<br>for training which included unimogs and<br>apcs and leopard tanks uh to get those<br>rules though I was the expert so I had<br>to read the tank troop drivers's<br>handbook I had to go out on live firing<br>events and watch um and spent overnight<br>in an APC with light firing that was<br>completely horrifying and uh I wrote the<br>rules in the end to describe how armored<br>vehicles moved around a landscape how<br>they damaged the world and how much it<br>would cost to repair that damage so it<br>was a really successful project and it<br>was interesting because it involved<br>language and spatial<br>processes at some point during<br>that my wife or soon to be wife desley<br>said you should really get a PhD because<br>otherwise you'll regret it and which in<br>other words is I don't want to live with<br>someone who's constantly annoyed for<br>their rest of the lives and so at the<br>beginning of 1993 I started a PhD at the<br>University of New South Wales this these<br>are notes from my first year of doing my<br>PhD and I was interested in you know the<br>spatial expert system was a great idea<br>but you had to have an expert to write<br>the rules and I wanted to take data and<br>then some very flexible form of model<br>and learn that model structure from the<br>data right it seems like a sensible<br>thing to do and so this was my<br>machinations I was very good at playing<br>pool by the end of my first year of a<br>PhD and I'd made no progress at<br>all so what do you do at the end of the<br>first year well you go and get married<br>because that would make sense so after<br>the first year of a failed PhD we got<br>married and what do you do on a<br>honeymoon you go to bookshops and dizle<br>pointed out this book on complexity and<br>said oh this might be something you'd be<br>interested in reading and she was right<br>and in particular apart from it covering<br>uh interesting things about processes<br>and complex systems it also introduced<br>me to genetic algorithms and I thought<br>wow they seem really interesting and<br>just to give you an idea of why I<br>thought they were interesting they're<br>very good models to search complex<br>spaces so imagine well here is a think<br>of it as a fitness landscape and if I<br>look at it on this on from above we're<br>trying to find that spot in the middle<br>that is the lowest point of this<br>landscape here now of course you can't<br>Hill Climb this and yet a genetic<br>algorithm can find the solution we'll<br>just watch it run how does this thing<br>work it's a population of individuals<br>they breed together and we have sort of<br>darwinian and Wallace natural selection<br>that as I threw in Wallace uh to do<br>selection on individuals and they mix<br>their genes together they mutate<br>themselves and eventually if you're very<br>lucky they find some interesting<br>properties that solve the problem so it<br>was a really interesting fundamental<br>concept uh so with the honeymoon finish<br>I went back to starting the second year<br>of my PhD walked into the room where I<br>was sharing a room with Paul Darwin and<br>said Paul I like genetic algorithms but<br>they're all fixed length structures and<br>I want a variable length structure and<br>he said oh go and have a look at genetic<br>programming and fortunately remember<br>there's no internet here we can't do a<br>Google search uh but fortunately John<br>koser's original book was in the library<br>so I spent a couple of months and I<br>built a genetic programming system and<br>then wrote up a technical report<br>describing my conclusions it seemed like<br>a pretty good idea it could build<br>variable length structures it could<br>build variable length programs but it<br>was completely unstructured there was no<br>way of adding domain knowledge there was<br>no way of talking or constraining the<br>way in which things were expressed and<br>certainly you couldn't talk about first<br>order languages or any properties like<br>this so it seemed like a good idea at<br>the time but it had some<br>problems uh but I knew about<br>grammars so you'll recognize the name no<br>chonky probably through mainly uh his<br>work in public um<br>well not Public Health in in the whole<br>issues of disputes around things and<br>public good and so on noome Chomsky was<br>a brilliant academic in the ' 50s and<br>the 60s he redefined the notion of<br>language and came up with such things as<br>universal languages and Universal<br>grammars and uh he understood how<br>important a language was defined by a<br>grammar and in particular we can see on<br>this page and I'd read this paper many<br>years before you know any language we<br>can think of is an infinite set of<br>possible sentences which is true you can<br>say an infinite number of things in a<br>language but a grammar is a finite<br>device that encapsulates that in<br>infinite set of sentences and in<br>particular a grammar is a sentence sorry<br>that grammars can be viewed as sentence<br>generating<br>systems and I knew this<br>right and just to give you a brief idea<br>here's a grammar a really simple one<br>just cuz I need to use a bit of<br>terminology these on the left hand side<br>these are called non terminals so these<br>are going to be Rewritten to give me the<br>thing on the right hand side and on the<br>right hand side here we've got what's<br>called a derivation tree so we start<br>with say a<br>statement and then we're going to apply<br>this derivation so we get that section<br>there and then of course all the<br>non-terminals eventually have to be<br>filled in to the point where at the<br>end we've got that final set of terminal<br>symbols and that's a sentence in this<br>language defined by this<br>grammar okay so you've got this notion<br>of a grammar we've got this notion of a<br>derivation tree which talks about the<br>non-terminals and how they're expanded<br>and we have a grammar that defines this<br>infinite<br>language and we knew all of<br>this and it was only that um so there<br>was a visitor from um AT&amp;T in the states<br>William Cohen uh soon after I looked at<br>genetic programming<br>and uh we went out for a coffee with my<br>supervisor Professor Bob maai and we<br>were talking about grammar and William<br>said one sentence that made my PhD<br>because he said you realize if you take<br>two trees two derivation trees and pick<br>up the sub trees at the same<br>non-terminal and swap them it must still<br>be in the same<br>language and we all went oh yeah of<br>course it has to be and and so that was<br>the end of it so that solved the problem<br>of what we needed to do so here's an<br>example from our review paper in 2010<br>that I was a co-author on so here's the<br>idea these are two<br>individuals and these are the derivation<br>trees if I pick up this derivation at<br>the point NP and here's the other one<br>with NP I can swap them over so we've<br>got the the cat sat under a mat and the<br>Big Red Dog stood on the floor and I can<br>swap them over to create the floor sat<br>under a mat and the Big Red Dog Dog<br>stood on the cat and they're both now<br>still sentences generated from the<br>grammar it was such an obvious link that<br>we just couldn't see and in the same way<br>so this is now like the way you take two<br>complex individuals and mix them<br>together in the same way we can mutate<br>individuals I can pick a non-terminal<br>like NP and throw away the tree and then<br>just get the grammar to read generate a<br>sentence starting at that non-terminal<br>so we go from the Big Red Dog stood on<br>the cat to the cat stood on the cat we<br>don't care what it means but suddenly<br>that was it I needed ways of mixing<br>together Expressions I needed ways of<br>mutating so I could generate new<br>diversity and the problem was<br>solved so after that conversation I<br>spent a couple of months and I wrote my<br>own context free grammar uh system in<br>genetic programming and by November of<br>that second year I'd written up the<br>technical report describing the<br>properties of this language and this<br>model and it worked really well so for<br>example here's a grammar that talks<br>about we're trying to um model greater<br>glider density it's a marsupial in<br>Australia and I wanted to produce a set<br>of rules to do that um inference and so<br>here's a grammar that generates if then<br>L style rules and captures spatial<br>relation ships and we could search the<br>language expressed by that grammar to<br>find ways to understand about the<br>density of these marup and so things<br>like this result here was better than<br>all the other models in terms of data<br>had never seen in doing predictions we<br>clearly had a model that allowed us to<br>express language bias have search bias<br>domain knowledge and search for complex<br>models so I thought that was<br>great uh just as a warning so of course<br>because it was a grammar I could also do<br>math mathematics here's a tip for those<br>who are still doing a PhD don't involve<br>your wife spouse or any other partner<br>desle kindly offered to read a draft of<br>my<br>PhD she found a mistake and I'll call it<br>a typo on some part of my<br>mathematics right so now she goes around<br>saying one oh I gave you the original<br>idea because you gave me a<br>book and two I fixed the mathematics in<br>your<br>thesis uh so anyway I went back to csro<br>we started doing other stuff it was<br>mainly in ecology occasionally I'd use<br>this model that I'd built but it was<br>kind of I felt like I'd solved the<br>problem and we had other things that<br>were interesting to do I occasionally<br>did things I wanted to work with Dr<br>Peter crapper because I definitely<br>wanted to have a publication with that<br>name and uh and we worked on and it's<br>fantastic was a great friend so we did<br>things like rainfall runoff modeling uh<br>I worked a lot with Frederick recknagle<br>from the University of Adelaide mainly<br>on freshwater systems using the S using<br>the<br>model uh but<br>largely didn't really push the model and<br>was doing other things and this slide is<br>because I have to acknowledge Grant dick<br>and I'll come over and shake his hand<br>because Grant was a PhD student of mine<br>and we did some stuff on evolutionary<br>algorithms but um<br>post that<br>PhD I didn't really push anything about<br>my model my context free grammar genetic<br>programming system and Grant took it on<br>himself Grant took it on himself thank<br>you<br>to yeah Australian accent grunt took it<br>on himself to um push this method and we<br>published a few things together and he<br>wrote reference systems so people could<br>use the code and so on and he really<br>pushed and promoted the method and<br>because of that so here's an example<br>from 2017 people write things like wig<br>and pioner the use of grammars in<br>GP uh while grammatical Evolution<br>mainstreamed the use of grammar-based<br>approaches to the point where it became<br>one of the most popular methods in<br>genetic programming that's Grant without<br>that I would have been lost in the<br>history of things so you really I I<br>really do appreciate that what's<br>interesting so this paper from 2017<br>notice the conclusion at the end the<br>results show that in most of the<br>selected benchmarks we do about as well<br>as my version which really means and we<br>did worse in some um and they're<br>comparing it to a model that's nearly 25<br>years<br>old we had one other uh and I have to<br>indirectly thank uh some Irish people<br>Professor Michael O'Neal and Connor Ryan<br>in particular uh from University of<br>Ireland University of Dublin<br>um they really pushed this approach and<br>it was because and Euro dollars were<br>pouring into Ireland around the late '<br>90s early 2000s and so they really are<br>the ones who promoted the method uh but<br>unfortunately they don't like ground and<br>I very much we're invited to write a<br>commentary paper from uh lee Spectre who<br>was the editor of genetic programming<br>and evolable machines and he said write<br>a philosophical work so we said okay so<br>we got uh James McLaren who's a great<br>philosopher of Science and also a<br>philosopher in terms of biology and<br>evolutionary systems and so the three of<br>us wrote an article about evolutionary<br>algorithms and how they should work and<br>what would be the best style and in a<br>fairly Brave move by Lee Spectre he said<br>okay we'll do it as a special issue and<br>then I'll invite a whole bunch of people<br>to write commentaries about your<br>inflammatory piece of work and and you<br>can then get one rebuttal at the end uh<br>it was a tremendous piece of work<br>unfortunately it means there's a lot of<br>people in Ireland and Spain that don't<br>like<br>us okay let's uh change pace for a while<br>and talk about<br>cats so uh everyone's waiting for the<br>cats so I I have a cat called Olive and<br>we had a problem with olive well we<br>didn't have a problem with olive but uh<br>there were other cats that seemed to be<br>coming<br>in and eating her food and uh that seem<br>to be a bit of a problem so I thought I<br>can solve this<br>computationally and so just to give you<br>an<br>idea let me just start this up so the<br>very first thing of course was I just<br>had to<br>understand what was going on in the<br>laundry right because the laundry was<br>where her food was and in case you've<br>never written software to do things like<br>detect motion clearly it feels like you<br>just take two frames and add them<br>together and find the difference it's<br>not quite that simple so for example you<br>start by smoothing out the world you can<br>see me smoothing the world out here you<br>turn the world into a set of blobs so if<br>I stand nice and still it'll all<br>disappear and then up comes the hand and<br>of course in the end after all of that<br>you can start to track the object and<br>then of course I want to take pictures<br>of just the bit of the scene that's<br>actually moving around so we first of<br>all just wrote this<br>software so that I could find out<br>exactly what was going<br>on this was kind of strike one in our<br>family because I had to make lots and<br>lots of pictures in fact we ran this<br>system and of course there were members<br>in this room who were part of this<br>picture um people would drop by and and<br>say I'm running an experiment in the<br>look but uh this is not Olive this is<br>the other cat and uh just to point out<br>one thing this is the laundry door door<br>and you'll notice it's brown just<br>remember that because it's important<br>later on so we took thousands of they<br>were probably the most photographed cats<br>in New Zealand for about a month right<br>there were thousands of photos strike<br>one was that I wasn't allowed to look at<br>them till after 10:00 at night because<br>it was so fascinating I just couldn't<br>stop looking at them uh but<br>eventually I'd built up a large<br>repertoire of them and because of that<br>it was reasonably easy for me to build<br>another model that recognized whether<br>Olive was in the laundry<br>or the other cat and it was only one cat<br>that was eating all the food and that<br>cat had a really strange Behavior so<br>step two was that I just wanted to look<br>at their behavior so yeah this is almost<br>strike too um so you can see Olive would<br>turn up in the morning and maybe have<br>some morning tea and a bit of afternoon<br>tea and then pop in for dinner and the<br>Intruder would almost mimic those<br>timings if we look at another day it<br>looks suspiciously like the Intruder cat<br>was watching Olive she'd go into the<br>laundry come back out the cat door and<br>the Intruder would wander in and help<br>herself and she was a ferocious eater so<br>step three was that I started taking<br>videos to see what the behavior looked<br>machine<br>okay now of course once I knew<br>that we got uh to the the next stage<br>oops I want to just go back there<br>ah right I'll just make sure I don't<br>miss it so now I could identify the cats<br>now we get to the<br>treatment and uh we decided that the<br>best noise so I set up some speakers and<br>the best noise we decided on was a<br>really harsh harmonica noise because<br>that seemed<br>appropriate and so this is a sort of<br>thing that happened let's just get to<br>here<br>and it worked really well and I by the<br>way I I turn off the harmonica noise<br>after about 2 seconds on for this video<br>because it's so damn annoying so so that<br>worked well but the cat genuinely got<br>more and more interested right that's<br>the original behavior let's look at the<br>watch watch what it does<br>now right and I've turned off the sound<br>but you can see the ears it's still<br>playing right the harmonica is still<br>going it was desperate even though it<br>didn't look thin it was desperate to Wi<br>this that's right we're watching you<br>and so you think if I anthropomorphize<br>the cat it was watching olive go into a<br>room and nothing would happen then it<br>would go in and it would get you know<br>all hell would break loose and<br>eventually what are you going to do if<br>you're the smart cat well you'll come in<br>with her because clearly there's no<br>problems so of<br>happened and the harmonica goes off<br>because it didn't care about oliv so<br>much and it ran out and Olive eventually<br>she must be toned deaf she eventually<br>left<br>and uh because you know because it was<br>turned up quite loud we'd be at the<br>other end of the house and we'd always<br>we'd Rush down to see what happened the<br>interesting thing that was the last time<br>we ever saw the<br>cat right and it had gone through that<br>long process of working out what it was<br>Behavior was trying to do and it<br>realized it was just no point and so<br>we'd solved the<br>problem uh we've got a dog oops<br>sorry we've got a dog called Charlie and<br>I thought well gee I'm on a roll here<br>here so I checked with Charlie and said<br>have you got any problems I could solve<br>and he said no he's<br>fine so uh so I just carried on with<br>other things so here's a more serious<br>example simple model but one that<br>allowed a lot of insight uh really nice<br>work Kath how are you so I did a lot of<br>work with Professor Kath Dickinson this<br>is a PhD student of our who's now Dr<br>Harris so Kim was interested in looking<br>at um theago Grand skin skink and she<br>had four regions in McCrae and the grand<br>skink live on Rock Tours and then they<br>move through the Matrix be it you know<br>the surface area be it a pasture or a uh<br>grassland uh or some sort of plowed<br>region and uh we were interested in<br>their<br>behavior and so here are the four<br>sites and the we turned the rock TS into<br>networks because the Insight was well<br>realistically the way they move around<br>in this in this network is related to<br>The Rock TS and positions and you're<br>going to find that if you have a more<br>more rich and dynamic way of moving<br>around in different environments you may<br>that may be an influence on things like<br>the density of uh the ground skink and<br>the health and vitality and so on uh no<br>one knew what the uh home range was so<br>we just gradually looked at extended<br>distances but we knew it wasn't 14 km uh<br>but what this allowed us to do was<br>characterize the landscape environment<br>in a way that wasn't possible without<br>changing the way we thought about the<br>world which was a simple idea but it<br>allowed us then to measure properties of<br>these networks and Link those back to<br>things like the uh number of um the way<br>rock tools were used and where they were<br>living and so on so really interesting<br>simple piece of work um some work with<br>Matt Perry and gr hi Matt<br>um in uh we were interested in morphing<br>networks because it seemed like a good<br>idea at the time and so here's idea we<br>start with a regular Network and we just<br>gradually want to change it just flip<br>edges and move them around but not to<br>just make a random Network which is here<br>but to go all the way through a vast<br>class of different types of networks now<br>why am I interested in this well you<br>think what we'd like to do is say here's<br>a regular world and then there's a vast<br>array of different ways the world could<br>be connected and so we designed an<br>algorithm to go from a regular world<br>through sort of small world scale free<br>and all the way to something that looked<br>more like a star and okay there are<br>worlds that we wouldn't have touched on<br>but it meant we created a vast array of<br>different topological structures and<br>what do you do with that well you run<br>models over the top of it and what was<br>really attractive is that the x-axis<br>here is basically all the ways in which<br>the world changes so here was a simple<br>epidemiology model<br>um and this was a measure of uh the<br>selection strength required to achieve<br>half of the<br>population um being taken over by a<br>virus or a mutation and the unfortunate<br>results were that of course it's much<br>much easier to to propagate viruses down<br>here and no surprises this is kind of<br>the world we live in now so I think<br>everyone knows this but the way in which<br>our world is structured promotes the<br>propagation and uh<br>were the propagation of<br>viruses uh here's another sad<br>story well sad story in a strange way um<br>Caitlyn Owen um I think Caitlyn's here<br>maybe oh hi Caitlyn sorry um yeah<br>Caitlyn at the time Dr Owen was a summer<br>student and uh I'd come up with an idea<br>and after three weeks she said this<br>doesn't work and I went AR well let's<br>talk to Steve mcdonell so the professor<br>was just down the corridor and and he<br>said have a look at software effort<br>estimation it's an interesting field<br>that I've worked in and we went okay<br>well let's have a look at it and uh<br>here's a tip you know when a field is<br>having problems when most of the<br>Publications are things like my model is<br>better than all these other models and<br>everything else that's ever come right<br>and then the next paper will be my<br>model's better than linear models<br>decision trees random forests and your<br>mother right and it will just go on and<br>on this is the quality this is a good<br>indication of disciplines that are<br>failing and so we thought well look what<br>they need is at least a good Baseline<br>model that would make sense if they've<br>got a base that they can say well I'm<br>better than the Baseline at least you've<br>got to start and strangely enough there<br>was no decent definition of a baseline<br>model that we can find so we had to<br>write our own but no surprises think of<br>it a baseline model has got to be<br>simple it's got to be deterministic<br>right we want to run it and we get the<br>the same result if we give it the same<br>data twice uh it's got to use<br>qualitative and quantitative data it's<br>got to use numbers it's got to use<br>categories uh it's would be nice if it<br>could give some explanatory information<br>about Its Behavior and critically it can<br>have no parameters that are<br>tunable right you can't have a model<br>that's tunable and be a baseline model<br>so we defined this and our Baseline<br>model was just a simple linear model but<br>a linear model with a slight twist so<br>here's some example data that's used in<br>software effort estimation and a lot of<br>that data was highly skewed and I was<br>originally very suspicious that when<br>they said my model was better than a<br>linear model it's because they didn't<br>know how to use linear models right and<br>uh so the method we did was to say well<br>look I could automatically transform<br>variables by looking at their skewness<br>looking at their shape trying a few<br>functions on them a log and a square<br>root and a square measure their skewness<br>again and if it sort of fixes it up a<br>little bit I like things that look kind<br>of like a hump shape well I'll keep that<br>and I know how to turn the data back at<br>the end so I can build the model and run<br>it and then turn everything back so for<br>example this is the distribution if we<br>watch these last two here that's their<br>distribution when we apply a log<br>function so we've gone from data like<br>that to data that is much much<br>friendlier typically for a linear model<br>even though there's not a great deal of<br>theory that says it should be uh so that<br>was our Baseline model no parameters no<br>tuning and here's the bad news so the<br>Baseline model was now outperforming<br>everyone so for example here was a 40<br>page model um on using an ensemble of of<br>artificial neural<br>networks and the Baseline model beat it<br>on the three data sets that we had that<br>we could compare right this is the<br>Baseline model that we're trying to<br>propose once again it showed the Phil<br>really needed a little bit of uh support<br>uh a really simple model this is why the<br>world Academia is a strange world so we<br>published that and very soon afterwards<br>I got a phone call from New York so<br>Gregory goth uh from Communications of<br>the ACM calls us and interviews me for<br>an hour from New York because of the<br>Baseline model right it made no sense to<br>me anyway so he published that in the<br>magazine after the interview uh and we<br>all walked away saying I don't get it<br>and I never published in that field<br>again um strangely enough a few years<br>publication another Baseline model right<br>I thought you only needed one but anyway<br>um it's a Str strange<br>world uh here's a much more interesting<br>problem uh s's work with Professor Paul<br>glue from uh psychiatric medicine uh and<br>Brendan um degraph from public health so<br>uh we were interested in Social<br>contagion and uh what do we mean by<br>social contagion well even back to<br>Plato's time you know they knew uh<br>friends all looked similar or you could<br>say birds of a feather flocked together<br>so social contagion is about the fact<br>that you might see things grouped<br>together in space Pro probably because<br>they have similar ideas and so on so the<br>data we had was on deliberate self harm<br>from in Carle for two years at admission<br>to the emergency department and we knew<br>where the people lived that was the only<br>data we<br>had uh and of course they were<br>distributed in space so let me just<br>explain before we go to the<br>complications of it here's how if I just<br>had had a set of a space with some<br>points and we had Point data how do I<br>determine whether it's clustered or<br>dispersed so here are a set of points<br>that are clearly<br>clustered uh Ripley's K is the standard<br>method for doing this and all of this is<br>just saying measure stand at a point and<br>gradually increase distance and count<br>how many points you see and you can<br>imagine if it's really clustered you'll<br>see lots of points early on and that's<br>this black line here here so early on<br>small distances we see lots and lots of<br>points this gray envelope here is if we<br>take all of those points and just<br>randomly throw them on the space and<br>then measure Ripley's K and do that many<br>many times it's like an envelope of our<br>confidence envelope about the behavior<br>if there was just a random world that we<br>would<br>sampling so Ripley case quite<br>interesting and then these are dispersed<br>points so no surprises we are below the<br>envelopes start with and eventually<br>distances get large enough so okay so we<br>can measure clustering that's not going<br>to solve our problem because the world<br>is not<br>random so he had at least two things<br>that were interesting one was that the<br>people themselves that we were measuring<br>and asking about social contagion<br>weren't distributed through space in any<br>sense evenly this is their distribution<br>using the deprivation index thank you<br>Peter kampton for developing such a<br>wonderful measure and this measure is<br>effectively like economic quality so 10<br>is quite poor and one is Mari Hill and<br>uh you can see immediately the people<br>that we were trying to study didn't live<br>in that so if we were going to Generate<br>random examples of where they could have<br>gone we had to control for deprivation<br>so our randomization had to basically<br>follow this distribution so at least<br>then we'd feel like we've controlled for<br>deprivation<br>secondly in Vago you can't just live<br>anywhere you have to live in a house so<br>you can't live in spaces that are empty<br>and so on and so on so we had to get the<br>map of all the properties within inago<br>be very careful about where they were<br>houses and not warehouses and so on and<br>then we had at least places we could put<br>people so long as we ensured that the<br>deprivation<br>distribution inago also looks<br>suspiciously like a grid<br>and I was very fortunate to give uh an<br>introduct a talk on this work before we<br>published it and thank you David SES for<br>pointing out because he said well look<br>if it's on a grid and I'd said to him<br>well we're going to use an L1 measure<br>which is a Manhattan distance so you<br>think it's like you know from this point<br>here I can walk along that street and<br>then up and it feels like I can only go<br>in the<br>grids um and that's the way and so this<br>is called an L1 Manhattan distance and I<br>was going to use that to measure social<br>distance and<br>Peter was kindly pointed out by David<br>that you should get rid of the bias in<br>the fact that inago is a certain shape<br>and rotate the Manhattan distance and<br>run the models for the rotations because<br>we were trying to get rid of any effect<br>and hopefully showing there was no<br>social contagion so thank you David<br>because it was a significant Improvement<br>of what we were doing the unfortunate<br>results were that we could not get rid<br>of social contagion so up to around 500<br>M it appeared there was some strange<br>social contagion going<br>on there is no explanation for this and<br>it could literally be this is why<br>working in these areas are painful it<br>could be that maybe the um uh distance<br>to a<br>Dairy right is the co-founder that<br>actually would get rid of all of these<br>effects right maybe it's the distance to<br>a pub maybe it's some other you know the<br>closest distance to a park it could be<br>some spatial relation ship that would<br>remove this effect but we can't measure<br>everything so extremely difficult to<br>actually confirm it we just couldn't get<br>it couple more examples I'd just like to<br>briefly talk about so uh great privilege<br>to work with Professor Kim Meredith<br>Jones from the medical school and we're<br>looking<br>at um sleep data we've got about 130<br>adolescents and they've been measured<br>with a poly sonograph uh overnight plus<br>there's a whole vast array of data about<br>them behaving for several days there's<br>video data there's acceleration data for<br>days and days so I'll just explain what<br>this is so this is a called a<br>hypnogram and this is determined by<br>using a poly sonograph which is like an<br>ECG an EEG uh measuring temperature and<br>heart rate and in fact there's about<br>five or six seven measures and then you<br>have experts that have a vast manual<br>that explain how to code<br>States and each of these states here<br>each of these lines here is 13c coding<br>of behavior and so they take this vast<br>array of data and say over this 30<br>second period you were in the N2 sleep<br>State and they do that for every 30<br>second period over an entire night's<br>sleep so you can see here they were<br>awake they were awake at the end and<br>I've shown you this one because it's a<br>pretty Classic this is one of the<br>adolesence but they really do sleep like<br>the textbook says uh you typically fall<br>into a deep sleep early on this is why<br>if you get woken up after about an hour<br>or half an hour of sleep you'll be very<br>groggy because you've gone down to<br>N3 uh and then they'll pop up maybe to a<br>slightly lighter sleep here's their<br>first period of REM sleep and it's<br>shorter than then you have another<br>period of REM sleep after some other<br>deep sleep and then the third period of<br>REM sleep's the longest and this is the<br>classic theory of how people sleep so<br>this person was great but you can see<br>lots of noise here right it's it's not a<br>case that from the measurements they've<br>got that you were definitely asleep or<br>you're definitely not so from REM<br>especially you often get periods where<br>they say you're awake now it may be<br>physically you can't notice anything but<br>internally your brain is now in the<br>state that they've characterized as<br>being awake so it's fascinating data so<br>for this data we can do things like<br>build graphs that describe the state<br>transitions of hypnograms and if we've<br>got graphs like this at are State<br>transitions we can go and look at Markov<br>models we can look at Hazard models<br>because we've got data associated with<br>every individual uh I've done a little<br>bit of work with this but haven't got a<br>lot of traction with it in fact what I'm<br>really interested in doing a bit like<br>the uh let's do a baseline model I'd<br>like to build a model that was what's<br>normal and ab normal because uh I was<br>going to show but decided against it um<br>every hypnogram is<br>different and yet The Adolescents that<br>were being measured were all had been<br>screened to be all people who did not<br>have sleep problems so that whole<br>question of how do you measure normal in<br>its pattern of sleep is a really<br>interesting one I think so we can take<br>this sort of data and build features<br>from it but what's also more fun is that<br>of course 've got things like<br>acceleration they wear a bunch of<br>devices like accelerometers think of a<br>Fitbit but one that works and uh so we<br>can measure things like acceleration in<br>three dimensions we can measure<br>temperature and heart rate and so on and<br>for our period of sleep where they were<br>being measured they were labeled data so<br>we can build a model certainly of awake<br>and sleep uh and we can do that in two<br>ways one is to construct a set of<br>features from the data from the 30C data<br>so we build models that look a bit like<br>this or we can take the raw data and jam<br>it into some sort of neural network<br>which I continue to try to get to be<br>better than the features and I can't but<br>it's a work in progress but it's a<br>fascinating area because the data is<br>very rich it's very complex individuals<br>are all very different and there's lots<br>of interesting questions about that so<br>I'll finish up by the final model uh<br>very fortunate to have a wonderful PhD<br>student Christian<br>defo and uh Christians from Columbia and<br>we're modeling the source of methane and<br>there are satellites now like sentinol 5<br>that uh and using<br>tropine uh that can detect and there's a<br>new satellite that's just gone up<br>methane sat and they can detect<br>satellite they can detect methane in a<br>column and you'd say well problem solved<br>well we're interested in agricultural<br>methane and so it's diffuse so for a<br>start it's not like if you've got a gas<br>leak with methane it's easy to find<br>where the source came from you can see<br>the plume and you can go back and say<br>it's got to be here we're interested in<br>agricultural methane and the big problem<br>is that wind pushes methane around<br>everywhere so what we really want to do<br>is understand given a satellite<br>measurement of methane where did the<br>methane come from and how much was it<br>generating Beyond background levels<br>that's quite difficult and what do they<br>do these days what what they do right<br>now is you define uh a set of prize this<br>is like original guesses this is like a<br>bottomup model where they say there's a<br>thousand cows living in this area and my<br>god there Burpee will give that region<br>some number of um amount of methane per<br>per hour or per year or whatever it<br>might be and we end up with a set of<br>Prior<br>emissions and this is called an inverse<br>model we then take the wind<br>fields and we then try and simulate<br>based on our prior emissions so this is<br>our guess of where things came from and<br>then we let the wind push them around<br>and we end up with some simulated<br>predictions of methane<br>right remember we started with kind of<br>an informed guess Anda provides us with<br>some very good prize Well pretty good<br>prize um we've then got satellite data<br>that says where it saw the me thing and<br>we can use that as a feedback model to<br>work out where maybe it should have come<br>from and so from that we can then<br>calculate<br>new guesses as to where the emissions<br>are actually being derived from and of<br>course feed that back into the model and<br>start again this is a highly<br>computationally<br>expensive method uh and it's fraud of<br>course with a whole lot of errors in<br>terms of there's lots of uncertainty and<br>noise and so on but this is the standard<br>way right now that when New Zealand<br>quotes their yearly budget for methane<br>to the global climate change commission<br>this is where they've got the number<br>from<br>right what Our intention is of course we<br>need this data because we haven't got<br>measures of methane throughout New<br>Zealand from where they came from so<br>unfortunately we had to build these<br>models or Christian had to build these<br>models and run them on the itaro cluster<br>to be able to generate the data we could<br>use to train the models in the first<br>place and Our<br>intention is that we are running models<br>both at 100 kmers over the entire world<br>and at 25 km within New Zealand building<br>a large database that actually<br>supposedly models where methane comes<br>from and then what it looks like and<br>from that building a large neural<br>network to be able to predicted now the<br>real value here is that and we've got<br>some evidence the neural network will<br>work for this the value will be in the<br>future the neural network takes zero<br>time to run and so we can run our model<br>every day and certainly it needs<br>aggregations in space and time but it<br>does mean we could give possibly because<br>we're using just the satellite and the<br>wind data we can probably give more<br>accurate estimates of methane say over a<br>global year and let's say I'm do a<br>farmer and I'm running a new pasture and<br>supposedly it's going to reduce methane<br>over about a 3-month period based on our<br>mathematical models we may be able to<br>detect a change in methane because of<br>that and right now you can't do any of<br>these things accurately so it's a really<br>exciting time and uh uh hopefully that<br>will work I just want to finish because<br>I haven't really I've mentioned a few<br>PhD students but this is a really<br>touching uh book Lisa Dena uh Kath and I<br>supervised her for a masters and she<br>made this book for me so she made and<br>bound this small book and she put some<br>Shrubbery in it that's just one of them<br>that was inside and I it was really<br>touching so you know thank you for<br>believing in me as a student and a<br>person thank you for sharing your<br>knowledge thank you for always being<br>ready to<br>help and a student is shaped by the<br>support they<br>receive I thought it was just such a<br>really beautiful touching thing because<br>I think it's important to<br>remember the most important aspect is<br>you know it is people it is people it is<br>people thank you very<br>it and we a little over but you went a<br>bit<br>late uh tin<br>Co Grant dick uh welcome everybody<br>good uh good evening everyone um thank<br>you very much for coming and celebrating<br>this with Peter tonight uh I'm Grant<br>deck I'm the head of school of computing<br>here at the University of atago uh and<br>it is my role or rather my privilege to<br>be here tonight um to give a little<br>context on Peter's career at of tago uh<br>and I must say I do that actually with<br>as you can probably tell from the slides<br>with a bit of significant personal<br>Delight in seeing this today so I'm<br>quite chuffed to be<br>honest um so as has been mentioned in<br>1999 Peter joined uh the then Department<br>of information science uh notionally to<br>teach and to and and to conduct research<br>in the area of spatial information<br>systems um however it was very quickly<br>recognized again as you can see by what<br>was in the slides tonight that Peter was<br>a bit of a generalist<br>and so he was soon teaching across many<br>areas including machine learning and AI<br>uh Information Systems ecology and so<br>on since that time he has supervised<br>I've got 28 here I've missed one maybe<br>that was me um 28 PhD students and has<br>been alluded to many times already uh<br>most of the supervision has fallen<br>outside Peter's host Department of<br>school but what's also interesting is<br>that when the supervision was within<br>information science at the time almost<br>every every single supervision had some<br>form of Co co-supervision with academics<br>from without within another department<br>institution again through his uh<br>supervision Peter is leading by example<br>to show how basic computational methods<br>can inform and more importantly be<br>informed by other disciplines um we<br>could all definitely learn a lot from<br>Peter's model of supervision I certainly<br>did as I'll get to in a minute<br>um I'll move to Peter's service just<br>very briefly Peter's service covers all<br>the bases as has been seen here although<br>that's actually a bit dismissive of how<br>he's actually L his uh his his service<br>role uh roles such as cheering the board<br>of ecology directing the masters of<br>business data science program<br>participating on the interdivisional<br>board of studies all show an interest in<br>reaching far beyond the domain of the<br>school Computing and again aligning with<br>interdisciplinary<br>roles and then much like his teaching<br>and service Professor wigan's research<br>is wide and varied there really does<br>seem to be a theme in all of this that<br>you it is wide and varied uh we've heard<br>about the achievements in grammar based<br>evolutionary computation I'm sorry that<br>you're no longer welcome in<br>Ireland um but you have really<br>uh with your with your grammar based<br>evolutionary computation uh created a f<br>that has really taken on it a life of<br>its own in in the field of um<br>evolutionary<br>computation um as Peter mentioned he<br>developed the the the method essentially<br>30 years ago and to this day it remains<br>state-ofthe-art in many if not most<br>cases of its use um allowing a<br>demonstration of Peter's insight and<br>genius into the effective design of<br>representation and<br>search uh moving beyond that lasting<br>impact in evolutionary computation in<br>The Last 5 Years alone as again as<br>you've seen on here it's almost like I<br>should have seen your slides but you get<br>them from me as a surprise um a very<br>effective Surly surprise Peter has<br>published in the following areas<br>evolutionary computation machine<br>learning explainable AI software effort<br>estimation spatial analysis network<br>analysis po population genetics<br>Financial modeling and for some unknown<br>reason I'm not entirely quite sure about<br>research all I can say is that that's<br>quite an enviable and diverse array of<br>research topics to be uh studying<br>with um his current research as you just<br>saw again is no less varied including<br>ongoing PL projects and sleep analysis<br>meat markets which you didn't really<br>allude to very much today yeah methane<br>emission and methane emissions<br>analysis a true generalist Peter leads<br>the way in demonstrating how intelligent<br>well-considered simple applications of<br>traditional computational statistical<br>and machine learning methods continue to<br>have significant impact in a range of<br>broad disciplines again we could learn a<br>lot from his<br>approach I must be honest I am left<br>wondering what could have been achieved<br>if we could have channeled Peter skills<br>and knowledge into just one single<br>domain<br>I settled on tonight that something<br>along the lines of fully sentent and<br>weaponized cat doors that sing Monty<br>Python songs would be my<br>guess so while we've been robbed of that<br>dream uh we should instead think of the<br>numerous disciplines that Peter has<br>participated in and the meaningful<br>impact that he has made in those<br>places now as a final note um I would<br>like to acknowledge the impact that<br>Peter had has had on my life<br>personally um Peter was as mentioned my<br>honors dissertation supervisor that led<br>to him being my PhD supervisor um he's<br>never openly regretted that uh but I<br>certainly did make it difficult for<br>him um and has has been my chief<br>research collaborator and conspirator<br>ever since uh including many Corridor<br>and uh office Rants and Raves about how<br>to how to fix the<br>world Peter you have collaborated with<br>me and without doubt the most<br>interesting parts of my research career<br>uh and you have been an outstanding<br>colleague and friend uh throughout this<br>whole time<br>uh you have been there literally at<br>every major event of my adult life<br>you've been there when I started work<br>you've been there when I finished my PhD<br>you've been there when I was in Spain<br>and I got yelled by by those academics<br>you were at my wedding in London in fact<br>the only thing you haven't actually been<br>in in my adult life is the birth of my<br>birth of my daughter which let's be<br>honest would have probably been a bridge<br>too<br>far I did<br>try I owe a huge debt to you thank you<br>so so it's now my my task to invite you<br>all to the staff Club to join us with a<br>bit of refreshments and light banter um<br>but before I do I get to present PR with<br>the<br>gift so could you please all join me in</p></main><footer
