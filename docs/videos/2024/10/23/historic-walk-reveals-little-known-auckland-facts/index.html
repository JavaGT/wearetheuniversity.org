Avril Bell, an honorary associate professor of sociology, takes people to places of local and national significance on and around the University's City Campus.</p><h2>Transcript</h2><p style="opacity: 0.9; font-size: 0.8em">Transcripts may be automatically generated and may not be 100% accurate.</p><p>I think that local histories and stories<br>are incredibly important and Incredibly<br>powerful they make history much more<br>real for people when you learn about the<br>stories of the places where you live and<br>work and move around in your daily life<br>it makes makes history much brings it<br>much closer and I think just knowing our<br>history is incredibly important anyway<br>because if we don't know about our past<br>we can't really make sense of our<br>present if we don't know the his of our<br>nation we don't really know who we are<br>and as a country we've had a very long<br>history of forgetting our history uh we<br>haven't taught it in schools and we um<br>have genuinely ignored it it just covers<br>um a really important time period in the<br>history of Oakland from its founding in<br>1840 through to in 1865 when uh and<br>during that time period Oakland was the<br>capital in 1865 the capital moved to<br>Wellington<br>um and I think the location of the<br>University is an incredible gift for<br>telling this history because a number of<br>the sites that I take people to are<br>actually on the campus and then others<br>are very close just completely adjacent<br>to the campus the walk takes about 2 and<br>1/2 hours and is kind of roughly<br>chronological um we visit um various<br>memorials and also sites where um like<br>we're at the moment we're filming this<br>in Old Government house right so the the<br>former residence of the governor uh we<br>visit the site where the original<br>Parliament was uh located and some<br>military sites as well so because<br>Oakland was a a political Capital but it<br>was also a military Garrison Town one of<br>the really important things about this<br>particular time period it's not just the<br>founding of Oakland and this um period<br>where Oakland was the capital but it's<br>incredible shifts in the Power Balance<br>and the relationship between uh the<br>colonial government and Marty so even<br>though it's a a local story or a local<br>history because it's very much located<br>in these in the immediate environment of<br>the University it's also um an<br>opportunity to tell a really important<br>National story um because it's really a<br>period where the balance of power really<br>starts off in favor of Marty and by<br>1865 it's really decisive tipped towards<br>the settler government yeah I really<br>love taking people on this walk and<br>people who come seem to really enjoy it<br>as well um I always get really positive<br>feedback from staff they always comment<br>on how they had no idea about these<br>places and I seen them away with lots of<br>uh suggestions for other places they can<br>visit things they can read and so on so<br>yeah I hope it really Sparks an interest</p></main><footer style="margin-top: 2rem; background: #0001; padding: 2rem; text-align: center;"><p>We Are The University</p><ul style="list-style-type: none; padding: 0; margin: 0;"><li><a href="/">Home</a></li><li><a href="/about">About</a></li><li><a href="/contact">Contact</a></li></ul></footer></body></html>
