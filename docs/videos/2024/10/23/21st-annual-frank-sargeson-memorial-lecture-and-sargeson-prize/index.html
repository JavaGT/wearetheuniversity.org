for the 21st annual Frank<br>seson Memorial lecture and the sixth<br>annual Frank serson prize award ceremony<br>I'm Sarah sheath and I'm the convenor of<br>the English program here at wetto um and<br>I'd like to extend a few special<br>welcomes um the uh to our co-hosts the<br>friends of Hamilton libraries who are<br>here tonight and to the members of the<br>sis and Trust who I know are here I<br>can't see you but I know you're here<br>thank you for coming from Oakland for<br>this evening and I'd also like to extend<br>a special welcome to those of you who<br>are joining us on the live stream<br>tonight especially the prize entrance<br>from all around the<br>country Frank serson was one of New<br>Zealand's most influential short story<br>writers he was born here in Hamilton in<br>193 qualified as a solicitor in Oakland<br>traveled to Europe worked for a Time on<br>his uncle Oakley Sis's Farm in the king<br>country and by his 30s he'd settled back<br>in Oakland in the old family batch at 14<br>Esmond Road takapuna where he began to<br>live the life he really wanted to live<br>fully committed to writing and to<br>helping other people to<br>write it's particularly fitting that the<br>sardeson prize honors his memory and his<br>literary Legacy in his lifetime he<br>mentored a whole generation of younger<br>writers with advice and food from his<br>garden and shelter when they needed it<br>Cash when he could and that Dreadful<br>lamora Citrus<br>wine the prize that we offer in his name<br>continues that tradition of support<br>Frank also left an impressive<br>documentary Legacy his papers are held<br>in the Alexander Turnal library in<br>Wellington where they occupy<br>878 folders over 7.3 linear meters of<br>shelf<br>space this year the seson trust<br>supported the Turnal library's<br>application to have the seson papers<br>entered in the in unesco's international<br>memory of the world register this<br>register identifies items of documentary<br>Heritage which have worldwide<br>significance it brings the value of that<br>Heritage to wider public notice and<br>facilitates preservation access and<br>awareness we learned a couple of weeks<br>ago that our application had been<br>successful Frank's papers have joined<br>UNESCO recognized collections in New<br>Zealand as diverse as t or white tongy<br>the Women's Suffrage petition the minute<br>books of the Mari Lan court and<br>Katherine Mansfield's literary papers<br>it's particularly gratifying that Janet<br>frames papers were addited to the UNESCO<br>register this year too in the Centennial<br>of her<br>birth so there's one other personal<br>thing I'd like to say which is that all<br>of these events are special but this<br>one's particularly special for me um<br>some of you will know that I edited<br>Frank sarason's letters for publication<br>a few years ago and that box saw the<br>light of day because of the vision of<br>Harriet Allen who at the time was the<br>commissioning editor at random house and<br>Harriet now brings her world of<br>experience as a fiction Editor to her<br>role as the judge of this year seson<br>prize so thank you Harriet from me for<br>your support of all things<br>seson so I'd like to Now quickly explain<br>the structure of tonight's event and<br>then I'll hand over to Professor Quigley<br>who will in introduce tonight's speaker<br>Professor Selena tala<br>Marsh so the first part of the lecture<br>is going to be our annual lecture from<br>Selena and then I'll pop back up and<br>introduce Katherine who will host the<br>2024 Sison prize award ceremony and I'll<br>see you again at the end of the evening<br>so I hope that you enjoy what we have in<br>store for you so without further Ado<br>professor quickley<br>good evening everyone welcome uh to this<br>evening's lecture uh and also to uh the<br>announcement of the seson prize for this<br>year it's my great pleasure to be here<br>uh to

tonight's<br>events<br>although best known for his short<br>stories Frank serson was also a<br>playright and an acclaimed<br>novelist um more than any other writer<br>he captured a workingclass New Zealand<br>vernacular and the society that gave<br>rise to it he resisted the urge of many<br>writers to explain the behaviors of his<br>characters and left this up to the<br>reader to work out it was the style that<br>influenced the generation of younger New<br>time so it's our great pleasure uh to<br>have tonight's presenter uh poet and<br>academic Professor Selena tatala Marsh<br>with us uh to give the lecture Selena's<br>work as a performer and author has<br>shaped Pacific literature and culture<br>through her poetry and performances<br>Selena explores themes of identity<br>culture and

now<br>I know who you are so thank you so much<br>introduction Selena T tal Mar T tala is<br>the Sal Talan word for<br>Storyteller it is my grandfather's name<br>my grandfather hails from the small<br>village of newow in tuvalu my<br>grandfather was named after Robert Lou<br>Stevenson the most famous tuy talah<br>canonical Scottish author of tales such<br>as kidnapped and Treasure Island and the<br>Strange Case of Dr Jackal and Mr Hyde<br>for<br>as oral people are want to do they<br>record their histories and the names of<br>people places and<br>spaces so there's an entire generation<br>of tusitala running around in Tu<br>Valu and it's my absolute honor to stand<br>in his name as I realized the legacy of<br>tuala uh in my life<br>life I would like to thank Sher Sarah<br>sheie for her indomitable Spirit she has<br>repeatedly invited me to give this<br>lecture and I've uh always been overseas<br>when she's extended the invitation so<br>graciously um thank I I thank you for<br>your tenacity it was quite irritating at<br>times but I'm here thank you Professor<br>Quigley W University for inviting me to<br>to give this lecture thank you to the<br>Friends of Hamilton library for helping<br>support my visit thank you to the Frank<br>serson trust and its chair Elizabeth<br>atken Rose Elizabeth could you put your<br>arm up oh another person who looked at<br>me weirdly and I was like<br>just wonderful lovely to lovely to see<br>you Elizabeth and thank you for your<br>support thank you for letting me dig<br>around at Frank's batch in<br>takapuna thank you to my partner Pala<br>Melissa for never bulking at any of my<br>poetry experiments I come up with when I<br>said babe I want to bury Frank serson<br>Story the hole that Jack dug at Frank's<br>Place and dig it up five weeks later<br>will you help he just grabbed his<br>shovel he grabbed his pick and helped me<br>I dedicate this lecture to the late<br>great Professor Terry stum Terry also<br>co-supervised my PhD on first Pacific<br>woman poets and without his help I have<br>little doubt that I would have finished<br>even when ill Terry invited me to his<br>Home Lind Linda answered the door and<br>led me to her still Smoky office and I<br>emerged with a better structured<br>thesis Terry lectured me in New Zealand<br>literature and it was Terry who first<br>introduced me to the work of Frank<br>serson so I really dig<br>Terry and I really dig<br>Frank and sometimes in my imagination<br>they morph together you know what I'm<br>glasses in fact morphing is what I do<br>creating clashes and seeing what<br>surfaces is part of my poetry making kit<br>and here's the poem that surface just<br>from using the letters in our<br>storytelling<br>names<br>sesen and<br>tusitala saga's<br>tale made from the letters in<br>sages and<br>tusitala sages<br>see a star a sun rotate rise and<br>set sails toss on Sea's glass as Tides<br>surge a Sage's tale<br>starts States a souls<br>song runes State<br>sit rest<br>tales and I particularly love the<br>surfacing lines of sails toss on Sea's<br>glass as tide<br>surge given the location of Frank's<br>batch sandwiched between takapuna Beach<br>and the sea Side village of<br>dport and those last lines runes State<br>sit rest listen to Nature's<br>Tales runes are characters in the<br>ancient alphabet system of peoples like<br>the Vikings and<br>Anglo-Saxons and they're also mysterious<br>symbols used for<br>divination my burying and digging up of<br>words is a kind of runic<br>divination with nature adding her<br>decompositional composition to the mix I<br>dig up letters and words and part words<br>and rearrange them to tell a tale that<br>is part<br>Franks part Papa<br>mine but where did all this madness come<br>from<br>as a poet I also really dig found poetry<br>and blackout<br>poetry these techniques do not suffer<br>writers block<br>excuses as I tell my students often it<br>takes the language that's already there<br>and by extraction composes something<br>new found and blackout poetry has root<br>stretching all the way back to the 1760s<br>when some guy called Caleb witford<br>started reading newspapers sideways for<br>Laughs fast forward to the<br>1920s and you've got Tristan zaras<br>turning it into a wild performance art<br>in Paris and contributing to the D<br>movement then the 50s and 60s hit and<br>boom Brian gon and William burrow are<br>cutting up text like it's going out of<br>style but wait there's more<br>Tom Phillips takes a whole takes it to a<br>whole new level by painting over entire<br>Victorian novels and calling it The<br>humument Project which lasts<br>decades and just when you think it<br>couldn't get any weirder Austin Cleon<br>shows up in 2005 and makes it internet<br>famous with his famous blackout<br>newspaper blackouts the whole whole<br>thing is like a master class and<br>creative<br>theft the kind TS Elliot talked about<br>when he said immature poets<br>steal it's all about taking something<br>old messing about with it and making it<br>creation but knowing how quote your<br>difference makes a difference to site<br>mophead AKA myself I put an indigenous<br>spin on it by merging found and blackout<br>poetry with the<br>earth I think about Earth land dirt not<br>just as material to work with but a<br>medium to work through ideas about<br>identity<br>place and how to create decolonial<br>spaces how our Bloodlines connect or<br>disconnect us to our<br>landlines I explore this through written<br>drawn and spoken lines I call this my<br>practice the first time I began merging<br>found and blackout poetry with landlines<br>and blood lines was in New York in<br>2015 I was invited to read at the<br>asian-pacific American Institute at<br>NYU it was there I met people with laap<br>Bloodlines the original people of manaha<br>now known as<br>Manhattan I was taken to inward Hill a<br>park at the top of the island where a<br>rock marks the<br>1626 EX change of the island for a few<br>trinkets between the Dutch explorer<br>Peter minu and a few<br>representatives of a few subtribes of<br>the laap<br>people I wanted to do something I'd be<br>in New York for 3 weeks so I wrote a<br>letter to the<br>Earth asking what she'd seen in this<br>place asking what had happened<br>I asked Rock Earth Sky Tree and grass<br>for the stories of the<br>laap I buried it at the base of the Rock<br>and returned 2 and 1 half weeks later to<br>dig it<br>up that's the rock to my my left your my<br>right apparently I didn't dig it deep<br>enough and apparently one shouldn't<br>write and eat at the same time leaving<br>food smells on paper for Rous New York<br>squirrels to dig up and<br>eat and when I returned nothing remained<br>Paper but<br>nothing is still<br>something<br>nothing still had something to say<br>about the laap<br>people centuries of<br>genocide forced<br>migrations and the environmental<br>destruction of their Homeland laap<br>Hing their ongoing disappearing in US<br>politics and their tenacious struggle to<br>be seen and heard and have their<br>bloodlines and landlines<br>recognized nothing it seems is also<br>everything now excuse me for one minute<br>I've got to get my poetry book out of my<br>bag<br>so in my thir collection of poetry I<br>daota for 60<br>gilders Peter<br>minu for the whole sum of it bought<br>1626 that's<br>$25<br>today the whole of it the length of it<br>the breadth of it the Run of it the line<br>of it the soil Rock and sag of it the<br>trees on on it the birds in<br>it Peter<br>minu could not buy the people of<br>it lenapi like the last tulip tree all<br>28 years of it<br>disappeared<br>Lai<br>do a few months later I was reading at<br>the 2015 Taipei International book<br>exhibition and I discovered the 228<br>Memorial peace Park a magnificent Garden<br>filled with blossoming cherry trees xers<br>Palms ponds Pavilions Pathways and<br>shrines but beneath its beauty lay<br>history of<br>Massacre on February the 28th<br>228<br>government were<br>massacred resulting in thousands of<br>deaths at the site of the 228 Memorial<br>peace Park<br>since I'd be returning to Taiwan some 3<br>months later I decided to write a letter<br>about its history and<br>ask where does healing come<br>from Rock Earth Sky Tree Blossom<br>grass when I return three months later<br>followed by a very skeptical Adam<br>dudding who was doing a<br>article for the New Zealand Herald and<br>mocked me every step of the<br>way he uh we we dug up the fragments and<br>this time we did find letters among them<br>J or a d an a an E and A<br>J or an e a j and a D and an<br>A or a j an a a d and an<br>e<br>Jade a TAA in<br>Taiwan its buried<br>treasure Adam was for once<br>speechless well he had a few expletives<br>he couldn't quite believe it I wrote a<br>poem that began with the ti the that<br>that I named Jade as it title and Adam<br>headlined his piece for the New Zealand<br>poem in June this year I expanded this<br>experiment and made it communal I was<br>working in Mai with the postfire lahina<br>community wearing my other hat as the<br>co-director for the center for arts and<br>social<br>transformation I ran a writing workshop<br>at a kanakam moi owned Farm on the<br>gorgeous mackina coast of<br>Maui this organic farm had been in this<br>Hawaiian family for eight<br>Generations each generation had<br>struggled to keep the land and in order<br>to pay horrendous land tax driven up by<br>the billion dollar Resorts that popped<br>up all around it it had to parcel off<br>land and sell them to the same<br>$5,000 but after a few Generations you<br>kind of get into the know and a couple<br>of the young nieces are trained to be<br>lawyers and they took their case to the<br>court in Hawaii and had a special<br>exemption for uh generationally owned<br>land so their bills now about<br>$8,000 which they can just about<br>cover it's farmed by two women why<br>um one is an x-ray technician by day and<br>a farmer After Hours the other is a<br>heavy machine operator farmer after<br>hours and they are doing incredibly<br>well um I got participants to write a<br>love letter to Papa Han Moco Earth<br>Mother beginning with their first memory<br>of Earth dirt mud<br>we then buried their<br>letters that's the burial site we had<br>Digger there about 30 people including<br>family<br>members I returned three months later<br>with some of the participants to dig it<br>remarkably the first word and Earth was<br>Unearthed so I rearranged them and made<br>this found poem<br>title Earth<br>writing<br>AA<br>toes in the<br>grass you take<br>off you<br>ground when you don't want to be<br>forgot you and<br>us do<br>know farmer be all for you<br>round to<br>push<br>at we Spire the<br>who when invited to give this Memorial<br>lecture it gave me an excellent reason<br>to for once actually stop on esman road<br>edman road and takapuna and see where<br>serson actually lived and wrote and it<br>made complete sense to me to bury Frank<br>short story the whole that Jack D I<br>asked Elizabeth chair of the sis and<br>Trust if that would be okay she said of<br>course but just to mind the loquat tree<br>where Frank's ashes are buried along<br>with the ashes of Chris CA Kath cart and<br>Chris Cole<br>katley Po and I gave it wide birth when<br>looking for the right spot to dig our<br>hole<br>except when re returned 5 Weeks Later<br>I'd quite forgotten about Frank and<br>Chris and Chris as the low quats had<br>ripened and were looking plump and<br>delicious and paor had never tasted one<br>before<br>so Frank's low<br>quats how low you<br>squat in the dull glow of a mid<br>afternoon sun in<br>takapuna on Esmond Road hedged in and<br>abetted by avocado Roots its pendous<br>fruits and a dying something tree<br>leaning into Witness<br>marking a square of making before<br>raising the pick to Pock the good dirt<br>then dig a hole for<br>Frank low quat you Delight our Earth<br>ridden fingers with your plump flesh as<br>we press your small Suns into our<br>so we found a spot and buried Frank's<br>short story the whole that Jack dug<br>first published in<br>1964 now here's the lowdown for those of<br>you new to the story and thank you so<br>much Professor for giving us a context<br>to Frank's Aesthetics because I've<br>written it in honor of the spirit of his<br>storytelling picture this we've got Jack<br>your typical kiwi bloke built like a<br>brick out house from years of working in<br>the Quarry one day out of the blue he<br>starts digging this massive hole in his<br>backyard his mate that's our narrator<br>rocks up and finds Jack sweating buckets<br>working away in nothing but his boots<br>and small shorts<br>now Jack's not much of a talker and his<br>mate knows better than to pester him<br>with<br>questions so they just get on with it<br>digging together having a<br>yarn meanwhile Jack's Miss is losing the<br>plot she can't figure out why on Earth<br>her husbands turned their backyard into<br>a construction site her fancy friends<br>are all a flutter too sipping tea and<br>gossiping about Jack's said<br>but here's the<br>kicker Jack never explains why he's<br>digging not to his mate not to his<br>wife not to<br>anyone he just keeps at it day after day<br>night after<br>night there's war talk in the background<br>planes flying overhead but Jack reckons<br>his whole is more important than all<br>that<br>makes you wonder<br>e in the end Jack fills the whole back<br>in just like<br>that no<br>explanation no fuss leaves everyone<br>scratching their<br>heads and that's it that's the story<br>simple as on the<br>surface but like Jack's hall there's a<br>lot more going on<br>underneath you see it's all about what's<br>not<br>said the spaces between the<br>words classic<br>Sison makes you want to grab a spade and<br>start digging yourself just to see what<br>you might<br>find so what do we find in this<br>story well first off we've got mascul<br>masculinity front and center Jack's all<br>muscle and sweat digging away like a man<br>possessed it's a very physical very male<br>way of<br>expressing well whatever it is he's<br>expressing seson gives us a rightful eye<br>of kiwi bloke culture here and its<br>unspoken<br>undertones because there's this whole<br>mateship thing Jack and the narrator<br>they've got this unspoken<br>understanding no need for heart to<br>hearts or deep and<br>meaningful just two cobers digging a<br>hole<br>together it's beautiful really in a very<br>stoic very New Zealand kind of<br>way but here's where it gets<br>juicy all that silence all that's left<br>unsaid the story is practically bursting<br>with t<br>but it's all bubbling beneath the<br>surface Jack's not talking his mate's<br>not asking and we're left to fill in the<br>blanks it's like another master class in<br>kiwi emotional<br>repression and don't forget that war<br>lurking in the background like a tiny F<br>in the Mist Jack's digging while planes<br>fly overhead it's a not so subtle nod to<br>the anxiety of postwar New<br>Zealand maybe Jack's whole is his way of<br>dealing with all that unspoken trauma or<br>maybe it's his way of avoiding<br>it and we can't Overlook the class<br>divide Jack's Miss and her mates all<br>prim and proper with their books and tea<br>they're from A Different<br>World they can't fathom why a man would<br>just dig a<br>hole it's seson poking at the cultural<br>divide the intellectual versus the<br>physical and lastly there's this big<br>question mark hanging over the whole<br>story why why is Jack digging why does<br>he fill it<br>in Sis's not giving us any easy answers<br>he's making us do the work making us dig<br>deep into our own minds to find<br>meaning in the end the whole that Jack<br>Doug is about the holes in our lives the<br>gaps in our<br>communication the spaces between what we<br>say and what we mean it's about how we<br>express ourselves when words fail us and<br>how sometimes the most profound truths<br>are the ones we can't put into<br>words it's deceptively<br>simple but like Papa Tua Nuku<br>herself it's got layers upon layers of<br>meaning if you're willing to get your<br>hands dirty and<br>dig and I was and so was paa and like<br>Jack's mysterious whole my poetic<br>excavations are about unearthing hidden<br>meanings and creating new<br>connections when I buried Sis's story on<br>his own land I was in a sense returning<br>his words to the Earth that inspired<br>them just as Jack digging revealed<br>things about himself and his<br>relationships my Act of burying and<br>unearthing Sis's words reveals new<br>layers of meaning in my own work in my<br>poetry of<br>decomposition in sas's story Jack's<br>physical labor becomes a form of<br>expression for me the decomposition of<br>the buried text is also a form of<br>expression it's the Earth's way of<br>editing the text highlighting some parts<br>and obscuring<br>others just as the whole ins sereson<br>story becomes a focal point for the<br>characters interactions and<br>Revelations the decomposed text becomes<br>a new entity speaking not just with<br>Frank's Voice or mine but with the voice<br>of the land<br>Itself by engaging with sesan's work<br>through my burial and excavation<br>practice I'm not just interpreting his<br>story I'm extending it allowing it to<br>grow and change in ways that resonate<br>with our contemporary understanding of<br>identity expression and our relationship<br>with the<br>land in the end like Jack and his mate<br>we're all just digging holes of one sort<br>or another whether it's in our backyards<br>or in the realm of literature we're all<br>searching for meaning connection and a<br>deeper understanding of ourselves in our<br>place and the<br>world what we dug up five weeks later<br>was<br>riveting and when I say we I I I<br>I love this so much when I saw those<br>worms through his<br>text that was like oh my gosh because in<br>1969 Terry Sturm reviewed Frank Sis's<br>novel joy of the worm it was a really<br>Ty so we had a lot of fragments like<br>this and using only the dug words that<br>were dug up and inspired by one of my<br>favorite poems poets E<br>Cummings I made this<br>poem digging for<br>Words Jack dug moment to moment<br>carefully for years<br>shining trouble inside Jack<br>said can't worry make it<br>great

do a<br>line and she said are you digging if to<br>do hour spoil work Jack once she we<br>friends there me you jack all what going<br>good How folks be<br>win thank<br>you so what's it all for Miss as one of<br>my Intermediate kids would say<br>well um I found that in the composition<br>co-composition between Frank myself and<br>papa Tua<br>Nuku there were seven takeouts for<br>creativity seven takeouts for life that<br>with the first one is creativity often<br>emerges from chaos and<br>disorder no sign of some drunk other<br>way I love that because I'm sure Sam HT<br>was drunk when he visited my<br>Intermediate<br>that takeout number two creativity and<br>meaning often require digging beneath<br>the<br>surface the bottom of<br>beckon the bottom of of back in and<br>often times my uh creative writing<br>students will bring me their writing and<br>not actually see what they've<br>written and I'll just get them to sit<br>with it until we can see it see<br>it and I read recently how uh when uh<br>Maria rainia Ria real who was an<br>apprentice to dear and was going through<br>a writers writers block and kind of<br>moaning about it to<br>darar i' read about the response that<br>darar had had um given him which was um<br>you've forgotten how to see so go to the<br>zoo and see and come back when you've<br>seen and day after day Ry would go to<br>the zoo and finally he<br>saw and 75 poems later on the panda<br>bear he could really see so the bottom<br>of back in So for me it's not sending my<br>students off saying Go away and write it<br>again it's go away sit with it and see<br>what you've<br>got third takeout stream of<br>Consciousness thinking can lead to<br>profound insights and art in<br>life quote I rid question the the whole<br>pretty<br>new don't you just love that I just got<br>so excited I was<br>like I<br>read so see something and then don't see<br>it drop your seeing of it pick up<br>another kind of<br>seeing always with a curious mind<br>question and something pretty new will<br>surface<br>fourth takeout the process of creation<br>and living is often messy unpredictable<br>and resistant to strict order quote blow<br>Lunatic and sometimes when I'm in the<br>drafting process and I get stuck I<br>literally have to throw it out<br>and see where things land in you because<br>through that principle of contiguity<br>when you put two unlike things together<br>and you kind of see the magic that<br>happens in those unlikely connections<br>that's that process blow to<br>bits do the thing that people think<br>that's<br>crazy dig a poem bury a poem at Franks<br>that's<br>crazy fifth takeout the search for<br>creativity and meaning involves both<br>external exploration and internal<br>reflection quote front<br>well a breeze of The Harbor at the sand<br>which Veranda FL but the my eyes and<br>six takeout perspective is crucial how<br>we view things shapes our creative<br>output and life<br>experiences quote Big Range window<br>but how accept with<br>so I'm always hopping on to my<br>students concrete language over abstract<br>concrete how except with<br>things can we create a portal into story<br>that is uniquely yours because only you<br>have those things around you in your<br>world Big Range window not just your<br>little narrow narrow portal port hole<br>Big Range window how do I get a big<br>read someone<br>like and the last<br>takeout life and creativity both involve<br>cycles of building up and breaking down<br>filling and emptying quote filling in<br>again and shut it out<br>filling and again and shut it<br>out so I excavated another 15 of these<br>but these were the main ones um and<br>that's me thank you Frank for giving<br>back um don't quite know what we're<br>going to do uh with the hole in the Beck<br>Elizabeth but I'm pretty sure it's kind<br>of grown over<br>yeah it's flourishing excellent<br>excellent and I hope I haven't offended<br>well p and I haven't offended the dead<br>quarts yeah yeah y so thank thank you so<br>much for uh sharing this time with me<br>please go away and read some Frank<br>serson he's just brilliant and His short<br>stories are my favorite thank you so<br>much<br>thank you so much Selena Big Range<br>window little tiny portal you made for<br>us and took us on that amazing story and<br>how wonderful to think that that tiny<br>piece of land at Esmond road is still<br>producing such riches I think he would<br>have loved it thank you so thank you<br>again Selena and I'd now like to hand<br>over to Katherine for the rest of this<br>evening's<br>proceedings welcome to the sixth annual<br>Sison prize Selena it's been fascinating<br>to hear about your writing process I<br>know I've written pieces that I want to<br>bury in a hole in the ground I'm just<br>again we're hardwired to want to tell<br>and be told stories they can entertain<br>reveal persuade hide<br>connect<br>heal the entries we received this year<br>accomplished all of those things and<br>more and once again it's been a delight<br>to gauge the range of topics from urgent<br>to frivolous surreal to achingly<br>current that are engrossing the writers<br>of<br>aloa I'd like to acknowledge the passing<br>in April of s Vincent O Sullivan the<br>chief judge of last year's Sison prize<br>and one of our finest writers although<br>one of our most modest he insisted we<br>didn't need to use his title it was such<br>a pleasure to work with him on the 2023<br>prize and he and his beautifully crafted<br>gossipy emails are very much<br>missed some thank yous first to this<br>year's judge the legendary editor<br>Harriet Allen for selecting our winners<br>from an impressive<br>field thank you to the University of<br>waor who have sponsored the prize for<br>six years now I'm especially grateful to<br>our vice Chancellor Professor Neil<br>Quigley and our former pro Vice<br>Chancellor Professor Patrick Leman for<br>their support of what has become one of<br>our most prestigious literary<br>awards the open division winner receives<br>$10,000 while the secondary school's<br>division winner receives $2,000 and a<br>weekl long writing residency this summer<br>they will come and live in the halls of<br>residence here at tar or wle with all<br>meals provided an office in the school<br>of arts and a writing Mentor from our<br>flourishing writing studies<br>program thank you to Steve bronius and<br>Newsroom reading room for publishing the<br>winning stories thank you to my<br>colleagues here at the University and to<br>my assistants Connie Buchanan and<br>Abigail Marshall for their help in<br>narrowing down the Glorious<br>1,36 entries a record<br>number but thank you most of all to<br>everyone who entered the competition as<br>I say every year there would be no seson<br>prize without you and please send us<br>some more of your words next<br>year we're fortunate to have some of our<br>writers here tonight and shortly they'll<br>give us a taste of their stories but<br>I'll hand over to Harriet now who will<br>announce the winners and to our acting<br>proce Chancellor AK aorangi Professor<br>Bridget Masters aeri who will award the<br>certificates<br>thank you to the University of w for<br>their continued support and harboring of<br>the sergeant prize to Katherine Chi and<br>the other people involved in the massive<br>organization in the background and to<br>the writers who submitted their works or<br>1,36 of<br>them the Olympics were still on when I<br>was judging the the long list and I<br>toyed with the idea of saying such<br>things as winning involved Stam stamina<br>jumping higher staying on the beam<br>sticking to the Rhythm and nailing your<br>landing and there is something in such<br>an analogy But ultimately choosing a<br>winner is a subjective<br>undertaking the finishing tape that a<br>writer breaks through is not a clear-cut<br>line on a on the field of a stadium but<br>an internal one where words on a page<br>have transformed into scenes in your<br>mind that you're walking through<br>touching smelling<br>seeing a successful story makes you<br>engage with an event and characters as<br>if they were real and it makes the<br>reader feel and think and then pause<br>realizing they've been taken somewhere<br>that has impacted them in a stimulating<br>and unique<br>way if a story has failed to do that the<br>fault might be in the writing but it<br>might be in the reading a writer<br>therefore should never feel discouraged<br>if they have not made it to the top<br>handful and I'm sure there are many<br>promising works that didn't even make it<br>to the short long list and they may well<br>flourish as given a bit more time and<br>further<br>refinement the positive impact of this<br>competition is that it has prompted so<br>many people to put fingers to keyboard<br>or to hunt for that file that's been<br>lurking neglected in a dark corner of<br>their hard<br>drive the following stories though left<br>their mark on those who selected the<br>long list and then in turn on<br>me reading the secondary schools div<br>Vision assured assures me that the<br>future of writing is in very good hands<br>I found it hard to believe that this<br>long list could have been written by 16<br>to 18 year olds the pieces was<br>perceptive Lively and so well<br>written the six highly commended entries<br>are conversations in my mother's Garden<br>by Micah Bradburn of Vago girls high<br>school the rose bush by kism May alante<br>of St Dominic's Catholic College<br>Henderson the house that Jo Jack built<br>by our mayor colic of carpet<br>College the Crescent Ace constellation<br>by the Mina belari of to Tower<br>College I sang when I was 12 by Sue Park<br>of Glenfield College Sue was highly<br>commended in the 202 23<br>competition and a match deck by meline<br>Walker of w dios diois school for girls<br>caraz will come up first and then meline<br>also to join us tonight to receive their<br>certificates<br>con<br>in third place for the secondary<br>school's division is an exquisitely<br>written story about being a young<br>teenager facing the end of childhood<br>learning about the realities of<br>friendship we are taken to a batch on a<br>beach and can feel the sand under our<br>toes the smell of Manuka flowers in the<br>breeze it is that good this wasn't the<br>the only story about disillusionment but<br>the writing is so evocative while also<br>having such a lightness of touch it is<br>like that Manuka smelling Breeze not<br>that it's a gentle story it has the hurt<br>of lemon juice on a cut when the<br>metaphorical Saturn slips out of orbit<br>the story is Saturn's a orbit by Juliet<br>blly of w Maya College tasmin Juliet<br>piece Al and I meet up every day usually<br>at my place but occasionally at our tree<br>we swam in the sea until our fingers<br>wrinkled and our hear ties were crusted<br>into our hair by all the Sals we Tred<br>higher into the bush for a better view<br>of the bay then ran back down dodging<br>smiled roots and Stones until we collaps<br>in a giggling Heap out of breath aliot<br>brought me back to her family's batch<br>and we danced her dad's ancient Crowded<br>House CDs in the living room the sunning<br>floorboards creaking as we spun<br>I felt alive and happy and impossibly<br>grown up like a real version of the<br>perfect British children going on<br>adventures who appeared in so many<br>stories the approaching end of our<br>holiday didn't concern me those days<br>forever second place goes to work that<br>has also has an astonishingly confident<br>style it's a hoot of a story which fears<br>towards the caricature but only enough<br>to make us laugh at what is a very dark<br>tale what keeps it from being too<br>dimensional are the spot-on details such<br>as Mrs HRI outrage that someone in the<br>office has taken her favorite coffee mug<br>that actually happened in our office<br>once um all all the thrill she gets each<br>day from seeing her manager's plaque on<br>her desk the imagery is fresh Vivid and<br>exactly for the character the rain for<br>instance splattering on splatting on the<br>pavement like overwrite plums and then<br>later soaking up her stock stockings<br>like butter in a crumpet here's a writer<br>in command of every aspect of their<br>story which Rockets along to a scary but<br>also poignant ending in second place is<br>the contributor by Tess Tessa Marshall<br>of avide girls high school otah Christ<br>church we'll now hear Tessa read from<br>Koto my name is Tessa Marshall and today<br>I'd like to read an extract from my<br>contributor it's raining when Mrs hridge<br>leaves her house fat drops plummet from<br>the sky and splat onto the pavement like<br>override plumps how inconvenient she's<br>already running a tad late Mrs hrid HS<br>her handbag above her head and hurries<br>to her trusty 2009 Ford Fiesta fumbling<br>with the cold Keys when screen wiper<br>smear frantically across the glass as<br>she veers onto the a23 the drive to<br>workers as usual teaming with young<br>idiot drivers who never indicate<br>properly she sze and Jabs at the horn a<br>few times for good<br>you and I must add humor is very<br>difficult to get right she<br>does the top position however in the<br>second schools division is a story about<br>grief as indeed were nearly half of the<br>entries in the long list but this one is<br>also a celebration of a life and a<br>person what made the story stand out for<br>me though is that it is told through the<br>single color red this is not an easy<br>thing to do and yet the result is<br>neither mon monotone nor<br>monochrome I've said in the past that<br>short stories need to be like the Tardis<br>smaller on the outside but opening to a<br>whole world inside this is a Tardis it's<br>just two pages long and yet we come away<br>feeling as though we know the<br>grandmother we know the narrator we know<br>their relationship and we know about the<br>death we also given insight into growing<br>up in a country that is a different<br>language and culture from one's family<br>and how Traditions pass through the<br>generations and yet can be hard to<br>retain when away from their Source<br>furthermore we come to understand how<br>those traditions and how those key<br>people in our lives Center us it's a<br>seemingly simple story but but it is<br>Rich and<br>moving first place goes to burgundy<br>Bindy by rashma Tera of Linfield College<br>Tamaki makoro RMA is Rich RMA is here to<br>good evening everyone I'd like to thank<br>the University of w for this opportunity<br>it's honestly an honor to be here<br>today and here's the extract from my<br>story third try with a shaky hand I<br>placed a burgundy bendy on my forehead<br>is it<br>scented you'd always put the Bendy on<br>for me I could couldn't do it then you'd<br>braid my hair finishing it with a<br>delicate Red Ribbon you'd help me with<br>everything I remember your crimson red<br>sari flowing behind you in the wind your<br>burgundy Bindy a perfect circle on your<br>forehead I remember your red Masala mix<br>making every dish a delicacy I'd run to<br>the kitchen whenever I smart your<br>cooking saying that I could help but<br>you'd just laugh and give me a spoonful<br>of scarlet sambar knowing that's what I<br>really came for Amber red was the color<br>of the sunset when you told when you<br>took me to Gunda Fort you told me<br>stories about how once upon a time a<br>princess was living in those walls the<br>day I got lost in the crowded Market I<br>was surrounded by walls of by stalls of<br>chili and<br>tomatoes Scarlet flames of Fear Rose but<br>as tears began to well I caught sight of<br>a crimson Sor rounding the corner it was<br>yours eyes red with regret you held my<br>arm until we got home blaming yourself<br>for losing sight of me thank you<br>the open division was also tough to<br>judge because again there were so many<br>strong entries the six highly commended<br>stories are playing hookie by Jake<br>Arthur of tiangui Atara Jake won second<br>prize in the 2023<br>competition the clappers by Rebecca<br>Blacker of<br>bull weird fishes by Sara Booker of TI<br>fuara<br>Wellington at the buyers Risk by Gina<br>butson of Tamaki mcaro Oakland second<br>unit unit by Timothy Jones of Dum Blaine<br>Scotland and pink elephant by Deborah<br>Wilton of North Vancouver Canada Gena<br>joins us to receive her certificate<br>oh one level the winner of the third<br>place is a simple love story or at least<br>that's what it seems as its quiet style<br>beautifully evoked settings and gentle<br>tone lull the reader I hadn't realized<br>how much I was cheering these two men<br>along in their warm and caring<br>relationship until one of them wants out<br>and I found myself internally yelling no<br>don't say that it's a powerful piece of<br>writing that can pull you in and pull<br>you under so<br>unobtrusively it's a story about<br>different ways of seeing and the readers<br>is just as part of the story as the<br>characters in third place<br>is Michael by cello Forester of tamak<br>Tamaki makuro Oakland and cello I<br>believe is here to join us to read their<br>story<br>much later Grace gave us a ride home she<br>still seemed Tipsy to me but she told<br>she told us she'd sobered up and I<br>didn't feel like making a thing of it it<br>was quiet in the back seat Michael was<br>leaning his head against the window a<br>small circle of condensation forming on<br>the<br>glass I'd watched the Sleepy suburbs of<br>wui sliding by outside a dark blur of<br>yellow street lights and then saw there<br>in the window the reflection of my own<br>two shining<br>eyes they looked sad and somehow<br>hollowed I glanced over at Grace she was<br>staring straight ahead<br>I looked down at the denim jacket I had<br>on I wondered what the difference was<br>then between loving someone wanting to<br>be made in their image I realized I was<br>drunk and I realized too pety that I had<br>wanted Michael and me to walk home that<br>I had thought it might be more romantic<br>somehow with the empty streets and the<br>warm summer air and our love for each<br>other the trees so full and bursting<br>with life thank you very<br>coming second is a very different story<br>about a writer deciding to set up in the<br>space under his roof reliant on his wife<br>to come home from work to restore the<br>ladder so he can get down up there he<br>can't access Wi-Fi or any other<br>distraction from the novel he's been<br>failing to write it's Lively and funny<br>as well as<br>fishlyn the story away at the options<br>for his character's marriage while<br>downstairs his wife arrives home and<br>drinks champagne with an unknown<br>man real story is going on under the<br>writer's nose but he can't get down to<br>find it even if he was suspicious enough<br>to check it out and while his novel<br>advances very little and his biggest<br>progress for the day is a list of things<br>to Google in the process a short story<br>has been written because of course there<br>are two stories and two writers it's a<br>fresh and inspired short short story<br>about writing about finding a plot and<br>about the impediments to Creation in<br>second place is Robinson in the roof<br>Space by C Craig Cliff of OT denan and<br>entry<br>Cliff Robinson in the roof<br>space Robinson is making progress real<br>progress two weeks with this new<br>approach and he's ridden more than the<br>past year combined it's drastic for sure<br>leaving his phone beside the fruit bowl<br>climbing into the roof space above his<br>garage kicking the ladder away and only<br>letting Janet resurrect it and permit<br>his exit after at least 6 hours have<br>elapsed<br>to call it an attic would be misleading<br>there's only room enough for him to sit<br>on a desk chair lowered as far as it<br>will go and slide a tray designed for TV<br>dinners over his legs and Bash away at<br>his sturdy sluggish pre- WiFi laptop<br>it's not an attic no sir but a joke<br>keeps looping in his head I cleaned the<br>attic with my wife last night I still<br>can't get the dust out of her hair Janet<br>has never been up here she played no<br>part in cre the writing knock or<br>concocting the Rules of Engagement after<br>some negotiation she did agree to return<br>the ladder to the edge of the Scuttle<br>hold at an appropriate time some of us<br>have to work she said we both work he<br>replied you sell houses I will sell<br>books Koda thank you all and enjoy the<br>the first place getter is different yet<br>again it is a quintessential New Zealand<br>story it couldn't be about anywhere else<br>The Narrative is a New Zealand voice but<br>without being cliched for it's the way<br>of thinking that's so identifiably kewi<br>more than the language or dialogue<br>beginning with hunting it conjures up<br>the West Coast with tactile vividness I<br>felt I was there tramping through the<br>bush or standing on the seaspray cliffs<br>its story Catches Us in its fast paced<br>current involving us carrying us along<br>to a powerful conclusion and at that<br>point you realize it's a strongly<br>political story it unlike many attempts<br>at political fiction it hasn't hit you<br>over the head with lecturing it hasn't<br>guilted the reader with emotional<br>blackmail it isn't didactic nor shoe<br>horns in an agenda you can tell I've<br>read an awful lot of manuscripts over<br>the years um rather the politics arise<br>seemingly organically though in quite<br>but though in reality quite brilliantly<br>from the story itself and what's more we<br>can see and even empathize with the<br>different views we come away<br>understanding how easily we can try to<br>justify our actions how easily we can be<br>overtaken by The Thrill of the Chase and<br>potent and potential gain and how easily<br>we can compromise and confuse our values<br>I won't give away anything about what<br>happens but it squatted firmly in my<br>mind as a story that speaks with power<br>and urgency to where we in this country<br>are now the winner of the 2024 Sison<br>prize is grey wacky by Ben Jeff of<br>tiangui Atara Wellington please welcome<br>uh thank you for everyone involved<br>tonight um such a huge honor and thank<br>you for the lecture it was such a<br>beautiful lecture really yeah it was<br>amazing um this is just the opening<br>section of gray wacky<br>uh there is a certain way of butchering<br>a deare so that it become a can become a<br>backpack it's easier than it sounds you<br>slice a hole through the front leg<br>ligaments and push the back legs through<br>cut the head off and gut the thing and<br>you can quite happily carry the animal<br>for<br>Miles I didn't have a license to harvest<br>wild meat cing was all they paid me for<br>I normally left the carcasses where they<br>fell but Hana was craving red meat the<br>doctor said it was normal she needed<br>iron<br>I don't know why I thought of that my<br>memories have a habit of grouping<br>together in ways that don't always make<br>sense for example the smell of fenel<br>reminds me of a grandparent who died<br>before I was born the word Tha makes me<br>think of the way my fingers move when<br>tying a line to a hook A Certain Shade<br>of Dusk and I hear the distant bark of<br>my first sheep<br>dog the doctor smeared jelly over hana's<br>stomach and pushed it around with the<br>end of an ultrasound machine the monitor<br>showed a flip book scene of Shadow and<br>light you know In some cultures they eat<br>the Earth to get at the<br>iron Hana liked that detail I saw her<br>smile at it and imagine the taste of<br>soil she wanted our baby to be anchored<br>here to be of this<br>thank you Ben for that a wonderful<br>taster I want to read the story<br>now warmest congratulations to you and<br>to all of our winners and to all of our<br>entrance for Having the courage
