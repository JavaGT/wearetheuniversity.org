The desire to understand how places are made, how places change, and how lessons from one place can be applied to other places drives much geographical research. For human geographers, the relationship between people and place draws attention to the social processes that shape and are shaped by, with and through place while also revealing how places are connected. In this conception, place exceeds the material dimensions and physicality of location; place is thoroughly social. In this lecture, I will talk about the different places that have been the focus of my research as I explored approaches to sustainable development, innovations in environmental governance, and the intersections between science, policy and governance to enhance the management of social-ecological systems. I will also talk about the people I’ve worked with, learned from, and who have shaped how I think about the world.<br><br>About the speaker: Karen (Ngāti Maniapoto, Waikato-Tainui) grew up in the Waikato and was the first in her family to attend university. She obtained a BA and MSocSci from the University of Waikato, and a PhD from the Australian National University. Prior to moving to the University of Auckland, she had the opportunity to teach at the University of Waikato, and to be involved in research teams working in the Asia-Pacific region focused on resource management. A brief stint in local government while completing her studies stimulated an interest in understanding how different scales of government interact with each other and affected communities in the implementation of laws and policies related to the environment. This interest forms the basis of her research programme.</p><h2>Transcript</h2><p style="opacity: 0.9; font-size: 0.8em">Transcripts may be automatically generated and may not be 100% accurate.</p><p>man<br>welcome everyone I am so excited about<br>having this job tonight my name is Jr<br>and for those of you welcome welcome for<br>those of you that don't know me I'm<br>currently the acting Dean in the faculty<br>of Science and it's one of the greatest<br>Pleasures when you occupy this role or<br>the deputy Dean Ro to do the<br>introductions to the inaugural<br>professorial lectures and this one is<br>special for me because I also had the<br>opportunity to get to know Karen uh when<br>I was had a little stunt as being head<br>of the school of environment um Karen's<br>going to talk in her inaugural address<br>about many things and you'll get to hear<br>uh some of the work she's been up to I'm<br>sure so I don't want to steal her<br>Thunder but what I do want want to do is<br>hone in on a few points that I think<br>absolutely are the uh in capture if you<br>like why I personally think it is just a<br>fabulous outcome and a richly deserved<br>outcome that Karen fiser is now<br>Professor Karen fiser and so just to<br>just to hone in on a few things there<br>are the<br>metrics okay so we always do metrics in<br>Academia there's the fact that Karen has<br>published uh outputs across uh the<br>typical Journal articles more than 54 at<br>the point of uh application for<br>professor book chapters and I think a<br>performance in there as well um<br>and and um not only that and I might<br>point out that in social sciences that<br>is an outstanding level of productivity<br>and and in great venues but also has<br>attracted more than $8 million<br>research funding which just is<br>outstanding and that is a spectacular<br>achievement in Karen's area of research<br>and Science and I'd also like to point<br>out that her work sits at the Nexus of<br>um I would say um uh um let me just<br>check my notes here so I get this right<br>because I want to get this right it's at<br>the intersection of culturally<br>contextualized rights public policy and<br>environmental justice and Karen does<br>this from the perspective of being a<br>feminist Mari scholar and a critical<br>geographer and it's a really exciting<br>space to occupy and it is one that she<br>has used and applied through a range of<br>projects and most notably sustainable<br>Seas through the National Science<br>challenges and her work there and her<br>leadership in that space has been<br>outstanding I also want to comment on<br>what I actually think is Karen's most uh<br>stupendous contribution not just to this<br>institution and on behalf of this<br>institution but to society not everyone<br>would have this sort of a record and and<br>when I give you these numbers I want you<br>to understand that in in in producing<br>these numbers Karen brings a copaa Mali<br>View and uh perspective to her<br>supervision of research students and<br>that is a Time intensive approach to<br>supervision 87 students in total 12 phds<br>completed 21 honors students and a<br>staggering 54 Master students and I<br>think that is the most outstanding<br>that and I would say that across<br>teaching in general Karen has been a<br>stellar leader in education from the<br>work that she has done within the<br>geography discipline and the school of<br>environment to the work that she is<br>doing now in collaboration with some<br>amazing Educators who are sitting out<br>here in the audience today to develop<br>the pilot for the core course that's<br>going to come into that is on in<br>happening at the moment as a pilot but<br>will roll out across the university WIP<br>Pap at to Mato contemporary science and<br>alter or New Zealand this is the most<br>outstanding course I have ever had the<br>opportunity<br>to poke my nose into uh and it is an<br>absolute Testament to Karen's uh<br>consumate abilities as a as an<br>educational leader that we are going to<br>see something that I think everybody in<br>the faculty of Science and indeed the<br>university can be proud of it will be an<br>Exemplar for what others uh will do to<br>follow so thank you for your work on<br>that Karen and I'm going on but you<br>deserve it um the other point I would<br>make is in service and I want to just<br>refer to the generosity that Karen<br>brings to service she really embodies<br>across all of her uh approaches in<br>Academia all of the fields in Academia<br>she achieves and embodies the values and<br>principles of this University those<br>values being Excellence integrity and<br>service through that the principles ouri<br>principles of f man and K Yi Tonga<br>absolutely embodied Karen by the work<br>you do and it is an absolute privilege<br>to me to uh on behalf of the faculty of<br>science uh thank you for that work I'd<br>also note that her service and her<br>generous service is recognized in 2022<br>by her award by the New Zealand<br>geographical Society for distinguished<br>Ser service which is is uh really well<br>uh deserved as well Karen empowers<br>people she is uh um a collaborator<br>and I would note in particular her<br>incredible contribution to empowering<br>Mari and women in terms of her students<br>and also the staff and the people she<br>engages with and in the communities she<br>works with through her research uh you<br>embody what it takes to be a modern uh<br>professor in this University Karen I<br>congratulate you and also on behalf of<br>John who if he was still the dean would<br>love to be here congratulating you your<br>work has been exceptional your promotion<br>is very well deserved<br>yours thank you to everyone for being<br>here tonight um I I don't actually know<br>why you<br>are this is a very strange experience I<br>know I've always been really excited for<br>other people in this position now that<br>I'm in this position I think why are you<br>here like what could you possibly want<br>to hear from me for who knows how long<br>I'll talk for I'm like like a talking<br>goldfish give me the bowl and I'll talk<br>um graah Carol or M I'm gonna cry<br>because I'm G to talk about my parents<br>Co Karen Fisher a i' thank you very much<br>um J for that very generous um<br>introduction and I'd also like to Mi to<br>Ivon underhills who's giving her<br>inaugural at the same time and I would<br>have loved to have been there but I have<br>to give mine maybe that could have been<br>the excuse to not come actually I never<br>thought of that I'd also like to me to<br>Debbie<br>lens um for helping me with the sidif<br>foration process for the Powerpoints any<br>of my students who are hoping for black<br>calri on white I'm going to disappoint<br>you it's much more interesting than I<br>would normally do and um it is not my<br>work it is<br>Debb's I want to start with my origin<br>story I this is my opportunity to feel<br>like a Marvel<br>Superhero so I was born in topor in the<br>1970s to Graham and Carol Fisher when I<br>was around 6 months old we moved to Alo<br>near Tiara where my father worked as a<br>farm laborer and my mother was a<br>stay-at-home mom to my older brother and<br>I around 8 years and a little sister<br>later we moved to marville where my<br>father became a digger driver and<br>general laborer for a small business and<br>eventually a truck driver then a f or<br>welder at enum's chicken factory while<br>my mom worked as a cleaner and in the<br>local mushroom<br>factory everyone in my family in their<br>own way is interested in finding out how<br>things work whether it's my brother<br>wanting to open up my sister when she<br>was a baby to see what makes her<br>tick or my sister who at the age of<br>around 20 took a book out of the public<br>library so she could find out how to bog<br>the rust in her<br>car she got she traded that car in for a<br>ridiculous amount of money and she's<br>still proud of the fact that she did<br>that I don't think she should be or my<br>mother who adapted everything from<br>recipes to knitting patterns she was a<br>woman who knew what she didn't like<br>years later she also relied on books to<br>help her fix minor plumbing and other<br>household problems or my father who at<br>the time of his death was apparently<br>building a<br>forklift but uh out of bits and pieces<br>he had gleaned from work there's a lot<br>of head shaking in my family and looks<br>of<br>incredulity by no<br>judgment for me I was interested in what<br>makes the world tick I was that annoying<br>child who constantly asked but why then<br>cheekily argued that because isn't an<br>answer when my father lost patience with<br>me and tried to brush me off my poor<br>father it's worth noting he did not<br>accept that<br>argument that kind of curiosity is not<br>particularly unique for those in our<br>line of work rather it's the basis of<br>our origin stories and confirms the<br>suspicions that my brother has that I am<br>a<br>nerd like many young people heading off<br>to University and especially those who<br>are first in family I had no idea what I<br>was doing and I did the wrong degree but<br>I made it<br>work i' uh I'd always loved geography at<br>school especially physical geography so<br>when I finally enrolled in geography at<br>the University of waor in my second year<br>I was immediately hooked even though<br>geography at the University of wa Wu is<br>exclusively Human<br>Geography nevertheless geography<br>provided me with a way to make sense of<br>the world and the place of people in it<br>place is fundamental is a fundamental<br>Concept in geography for human<br>geographers place and places are more<br>than physical locations<br>theories about Place emphasize place is<br>socially constructed and imbued with<br>meaning through social<br>interaction rather than simpli simply<br>focusing on understanding place or a<br>place in isolation human geographers<br>have been interested in understanding<br>how places connect to other<br>places how places are shaped by<br>different social economic political and<br>biophysical processes in relation to<br>other places and how places and people<br>are co-constituted<br>exposures to Theory exposure to theories<br>of place and the concepts that extend<br>understandings of place provided me a<br>different perspective on things that I<br>had taken for granted growing up my<br>interest in economic geography and flows<br>of capital the role of the state<br>structural inequalities giving rise to<br>social iniquities and the interactions<br>across and within scales could be traced<br>to my observations of the kinds of<br>businesses present in marville there<br>were a lot of travel<br>agents the overheard Sation among the<br>children of Dairy Farmers regarding the<br>price of milk fat my family identifies<br>as sheep<br>farming the imperviousness of the town<br>to the manifestations of recessions<br>which I observed whilst working at the<br>best horse chainese takeaways and the<br>difference that social difference makes<br>to fitting in or not in different<br>spaces as a feminist geographer I know<br>these experiences shaped my subjectivity<br>and affect how I interpret the world and<br>seeking to understand and make sense of<br>people and places I'm Guided by Donna<br>haro's assertion that all knowledge is<br>situated imp partial rather than seeking<br>a universal truth I'm interested in the<br>messiness of<br>life I've grappled with ideas around<br>positionality identity difference and<br>subjectivity and practiced crit critical<br>reflexivity long before reading Jillian<br>Rose's work I was an Earnest<br>child I was very much influenced by<br>feminist geographers particularly<br>because I was fortunate to to study in a<br>geography Department in the 1990s where<br>feminist geographies gender and<br>sexuality were just taught it was just<br>the way it was and partly because this<br>kind of approach fitted with how I saw<br>the world and my place in it some of the<br>credit for that is due to my<br>father who told me from a young age<br>never to let anyone tell me I couldn't<br>do something just because I was a<br>girl but I'm getting ahead of<br>myself at the end of my bachelors's I<br>for a while at the the matam Mato<br>District<br>Council and various fixed term entry<br>level minion roles in planning property<br>and<br>Engineering after a couple of years I<br>decided to go back to University<br>initially I thought about doing a<br>planning degree but then I decided I<br>would go back to wut for a masters in<br>geography my early research interests<br>were in in in investigating or related<br>to investigating the role of the private<br>sector in International Development at a<br>time when official development<br>assistance and the promise of<br>development were not being realized and<br>neoliberal reforms had taken hold<br>somewhat paradoxically or perhaps not<br>this is also a time when calls for<br>greater levels of participation and a<br>more nuanced understanding of how power<br>dynamics effect development<br>interventions were being<br>made my engagements with debates about<br>development sustainable and otherwise<br>were grounded in field-based research in<br>the Philippines<br>my Master's research examined a<br>privately funded development project<br>proposed in 1996 by a conglomeration of<br>three corporations called the the<br>alliance the proposed Finance model was<br>a build operate transfer which is when<br>the public sector grants a franchise to<br>a private entity to finance design<br>construct and operate a facility for a<br>specified period after which ownership<br>is transferred back to the state in the<br>Philippines that period is normally<br>around 25 years<br>I became aware of the project through my<br>supervisor Peter urick who had been<br>asked to give his opinion on the<br>feasibility study for the<br>project the project proposed to treat<br>and convey water from one province behal<br>with an economy primarily based on<br>agriculture to another Province Sabu<br>which was becoming a site of<br>International Investment tourism and a<br>growing service<br>economy in keeping with neoliberal<br>reforms a suite of enabling conditions<br>facilitated this possible intervention<br>constitutional changes including a new<br>constitution following the end of the<br>Marcos dictatorship changes to laws<br>regulating foreign investment changes to<br>laws regulating the provision of public<br>services and special legislation that<br>provided the president with emergency<br>powers to address urgent issues such as<br>supply distrib distribution and<br>financing of water and to arrange for<br>privatization in the water supply<br>sector my research focused on<br>investigating consultation undertaken as<br>part of the environmental impact<br>assessment process with for the proposed<br>project I focused particularly on those<br>municipalities within the wah inabanga<br>Watershed the arrow is my work not<br>debies don't blame her um just to<br>illustrate where the um W in in abango<br>Watershed is in the province of<br>Bol in the feasibility study most of the<br>consultation had been conducted with the<br>beneficiaries of the treated water<br>including with people in Sabu with very<br>little consideration given to those who<br>within who lived within the<br>Watershed an important part of this<br>research involved traveling to the<br>Philippines other than a two-e holiday<br>in Queensland a year earlier I'd never<br>been overseas before so the Philippines<br>was a bit of a culture shock it was<br>ridiculously humid and a sensory<br>overload and to this day I am deeply<br>triggered I am still deeply triggered by<br>roosters and I continue to question why<br>my supervisor was in the Philippines<br>doing fieldwork of his own so he met me<br>at the airport in Sabu and we traveled<br>together to tuaran on the super cat fast<br>fery it was while we were traveling on<br>the fery that Peter suggested it might<br>be useful to discuss the kinds of<br>questions I should ask in my<br>interviews to say my supervision was<br>fely hands off is probably an<br>understatement but it suited me and he<br>was an amazing supervisor I thoroughly<br>enjoyed working with<br>Peter Peter had conducted his Masters<br>and PhD research in the Philippines so I<br>benefited from his relationships with<br>local and provincial government<br>officials who I went on to interview as<br>well as local families who showed me<br>great hospitality and let me stay with<br>them the family compound in tagbilaran<br>which is I couldn't get it I a decent<br>picture but it was basically in here<br>comprised at the time two<br>households my household was home to two<br>young people Anthony and indai around<br>both of whom were around my age and they<br>were living in the city while they were<br>attending college the other household<br>was home to their uncle and his<br>family living with a family for 6 weeks<br>provided me with a taste of life in the<br>Philippines including a literal taste<br>and I don't know if there are any of<br>Assan speakers but Dilly K on orista<br>means I don't eat<br>fish I like to say that to children and<br>they would look at me in shock and<br>horror given I don't eat fish or seafood<br>doing field work in a place where fish<br>is a staple not have been my wisest move<br>I tried eating fish at home to be polite<br>but gave up fairly quickly and fish was<br>often substituted with Spam or eggs or<br>cucumber I did enjoy other Foods though<br>Philippine mangoes are the best mangoes<br>in the world full<br>stop banana C is delicious how can you<br>impr proven a banana put sugar on it and<br>then like barbecue it makes sense though<br>longin were probably my favorite fruit<br>unsur surprisingly to those who know me<br>my favorite food was probably either<br>chicken adobo or Leon manoch which is<br>barbecued chicken so basically chicken<br>which is pretty much what it is here I<br>got to travel to many parts of the<br>province of Bal including a municipality<br>in the middle of the province that had<br>been relatively isolated until the 1990s<br>because it had been an NPA stronghold so<br>the new People's Army which is the<br>military armor of the Communist Party of<br>the<br>Philippines I conducted into interviews<br>with Mayors and others working in<br>Municipal governments throughout the wah<br>inabanga Watershed the governor and vice<br>governor of the province others working<br>in the capital as well as<br>representatives of non-governmental<br>organizations in the church who were<br>opposed to the proposal and a<br>representative of the project<br>proponent the provincial Planning and<br>Development Office gave me a space to<br>work and allowed me to interact with<br>people not otherwise involved in my<br>research but curious to know who I was<br>and where I was from at that time New<br>Zealand was mostly known for anchor<br>milk with my supervisor and a bunch of<br>geologists from somewhere in Europe I<br>traveled to caves that were GE<br>geologically interesting apparently um<br>but had also I was told provided safe<br>haven for people during the Japanese<br>Occupation in World War II I saw the<br>world famous chocolate Hills have has<br>anyone heard of the world famous<br>chocolate Hills oh wow um and I held a<br>Taria which upon reflection was probably<br>not a good thing given they are<br>nocturnal creatures and very<br>timid my travels involved buses Jeep<br>knes multicabs Hubble Hubble which is<br>when you ride on the back of you have<br>multiple people on the back of the<br>motorcycles we only had like the driver<br>and two of us so not many tricycles and<br>fairies um when I traveled to B Babu I<br>was accompanied on these excursions by<br>my brother Anthony who I called My<br>Bodyguard and who was referred to by<br>others as my companion or Catan<br>I attended the street dancing held<br>during the sandugo festival which was<br>actually held in a stadium um sandugo is<br>a the blood compact or first Treaty of<br>friendship between the Spaniards and<br>Filipinos which happened in bahal in<br>1565 between Miguel Lopez dagasi and<br>datu<br>sikatuna I shared what I knew about t<br>wangi in exchange for learning about<br>sandugo I attended Fiesta which is<br>basically just eating a lot of food and<br>learned the hard way to only eat small<br>portions I sang videi badly but with<br>worse I was in the Philippines when Hong<br>Kong was handed back to the Chinese when<br>Tyson bit Holyfield's ear the fight was<br>a very big deal in my family when Andrew<br>Canan killed Giani Vace kunan was of<br>Filipino descent so it dominated the<br>news for the beginning of the Southeast<br>Asian forest fires and just prior to the<br>Asian financial crisis<br>for those weeks in Southeast Asia I had<br>very little idea about what was<br>happening in New Zealand it was the<br>olden days and the times before internet<br>although I did have a hot mail I did<br>email some people my being in place and<br>growing understanding how the place of<br>behold came to be provided me with a<br>different perspective of these events<br>than if I had been in New Zealand<br>bizarrely hearing how bizarre playing on<br>the radio one day in the house felt both<br>familiar yet out of place because of my<br>Association of the song with a strong<br>New Zealand based identity<br>my time in the Philippines was an<br>adventure i' started my field work<br>feeling overwhelmed and out of place and<br>ended it by balling with my family and<br>feeling sad to leave and the months that<br>followed remembering the various people<br>I had met and the places I had been made<br>the writing up stage easier I still<br>think field work is the best part of any<br>research my experience of being in the<br>field was enormously useful for gaining<br>insights into the topic and the context<br>that were otherwise not accessible to me<br>for example prior to going to the<br>Philippines I had read about the bridge<br>to nowhere in the municipality of leok<br>which was criticized in the behold<br>Chronicle for being a white elephant and<br>a waste of development funding but it<br>wasn't until I saw it that I fully<br>appreciated what they<br>meant they had built half of a bridge<br>before it would seem looking up and<br>realizing that there was a 16th century<br>church or Cathedral of significance from<br>a cultural and Heritage perspective in<br>the path of the<br>bridge also the bridge doesn't go over<br>the river it they it gets decorated at<br>different times though so that's quite<br>nice my research found that although<br>participatory private development<br>projects tend to exclude or only<br>partially include affected stakeholders<br>in development process in the<br>development process key issue to emerge<br>out of the project that uh out of my<br>project was that of information<br>dissemination on many occasions those<br>most likely to be affected had not been<br>adequately informed about the project<br>and the potential impacts the eventual<br>sources of information often proed to be<br>representatives of Civil Society either<br>NOS or the church and in many instances<br>the<br>media the project proponent method of<br>disseminating information was primarily<br>to Target the municipal or government<br>level with technical information thus<br>disenfranchising the<br>Grassroots the question of whose<br>responsibility it is to disseminate<br>information and promote and encourage<br>participation was a contentious<br>point in addition to the bits that you<br>put in your thesis I learned that<br>research and researchers aren't always<br>or ever seen as innocent or neutral or<br>even wanted I learned that on the ground<br>realities are far messier than what is<br>theorized and the rigid boundaries<br>between the state market and Civil<br>Society don't always bear up as might be<br>expected I learned the limits of<br>critical reflexivity and that you can't<br>really know if what interview<br>participants are telling you is what<br>they actually think and I learned about<br>intersectionality positionality and<br>subjectivity though not yet in those<br>terms and how they shape research<br>interactions these lessons are<br>invaluable for a PhD for doing a<br>PhD upon completing my masters I had no<br>interest at all in doing a<br>PhD while the research experience had<br>been amazing<br>personal tragedy and other challenges<br>left me unsure about what to do so I<br>enrolled in a diploma in economics as<br>you<br>do we don't need to talk about that<br>other than to say I eventually applied<br>for and was awarded a summer scholarship<br>to work with Professor Kathy Gibson an<br>economic geographer at the Australian<br>National<br>University a few weeks into my summer<br>scholarship I I decided to stay in<br>Cambra because why<br>not I worked for research groups in the<br>research School of Pacific and Asian<br>studies for a couple of years before<br>utter frustration and mental boredom led<br>me to apply to do a PhD at theu I was<br>surrounded by PhD students and amazing<br>researchers and I wanted to do that<br>too I ended up doing my PhD in a school<br>very similar to the school of<br>environment the school of resources<br>environment and society which is now<br>known as the F School of environment and<br>Society my primary Supervisor was<br>Richard Baker a geography uh geographer<br>with experience working with indigenous<br>communities in Australia and my<br>co-supervisors were Andrew Walker an<br>anthropologist with experience working<br>in Thailand and Ian white who seem to<br>have expertise in lots of things though<br>I thought of him as a hydrologist I<br>don't know if he is he had worked in<br>kurbas and was one of those profs who<br>was involved with a lot of different um<br>PhD students<br>projects my office mates were honors and<br>PhD students working mostly in the<br>fields of soil science and Forestry I<br>learned words like rigth and saprolite<br>and soil microbial<br>biomass I took the opportunity to<br>explore places in Australia with friends<br>and peers doing phds that most people<br>don't get to explore like<br>bendale or<br>wombat or burrower or broken Hill though<br>people do go to Broken Hill and to dig<br>holes and label bags of<br>dirt I spent time in the lab mostly to<br>talk to my friend vaness but I was still<br>in the lab and you'll see I'm helping<br>Vanessa as she prepares her site by<br>taking<br>photos we also played a lot of<br>Boggle for my own research I returned to<br>the Philippines and continued to explore<br>my interest related to the role of the<br>private sector and the provision of<br>public goods and changes in governance<br>Arrangements that enabled this my<br>research focused again on water but this<br>time I looked at Urban water provision<br>in tagin the capital city of<br>whole again my research aligned with<br>debates related to sustainable<br>development and especially Target seven<br>of the U Millennium development<br>goals in 1992 prior to the UN conference<br>on environment and development or the<br>Rio conference a series of other<br>conferences were held related to climate<br>change biodiversity loss Forest<br>management and water amongst other<br>things the 1992 Dublin conference on<br>water and development established four<br>principles for managing Water Resources<br>the imperative provided by the<br>Millennium development goals and the<br>role of these principles especially<br>principle four dominated research<br>focused on Urban water provision and who<br>ought to have<br>responsibility the continued dominance<br>of neoliberal Logics in the late 9s and<br>early 2000s meant the private sector was<br>lorded by many as providing the solution<br>to the failures of the public<br>sector different models of privatization<br>from service contracts through to<br>divesture and the benefits of of each<br>were reported and debated those in favor<br>of the of private sector involvement<br>pointed to corruption lack of investment<br>aging infrastructure water losses poor<br>cost recovery and other economic<br>efficiencies at the hands of the public<br>sector whereas those opposed pointed to<br>the perverse social outcomes that could<br>arise when a public good such as<br>portable water is delivered by a profit<br>motivated utility private utility for<br>example inequities in terms of access<br>service coverage price increases<br>disconnections and Corruption notably<br>corruption was seen as a risk for both<br>private and public<br>utilities my research addressed<br>questions related to how development and<br>water governance were understood and<br>enacted across different scales for my<br>field workor I once again was based in<br>tuag Laren and and this time my<br>fieldwork was divided into two sixish<br>month blocks of time across 2003 and<br>2004 by this stage New Zealand was known<br>for the of the<br>Rings tangaran at that time was a fairly<br>small city of around 90,000 people and<br>around 15 and a half thousand<br>households despite being a fairly small<br>city the city was serviced by two<br>separate water utilities one operated<br>and owned by the city government the<br>tuaran city waterwork system and one by<br>the provincial government the provincial<br>Waterworks system however in December<br>2000 the provincial government entered<br>into a private public private joint<br>venture agreement that culminated in<br>behold water behold water utilities who<br>assumed operation for the water wck<br>system in December<br>2000 the provincial government retained<br>a 30% equity<br>share while Salon Philippines the<br>private company held a 70% share this<br>was not the first private water utility<br>to operate in the Philippines but it was<br>different to other<br>models at the time of my research Metro<br>Manila was served by metropolitan Manila<br>wwis and seage system through its two<br>private concessionaires Manila water<br>company and manad oops<br>sorry uh mainly L Water Services some<br>smaller scale private vendors also<br>supplied water in parts of manila<br>manila for the first six months I lived<br>with the same family IID lived with for<br>my masters this time there were four<br>hous holds in the compound and I lived<br>again with the younger family members<br>while their aunts and uncle headed the<br>other households in the compound<br>I bonded with many of the children in<br>the compound at least partly because I<br>could practice my V sign with them I I<br>would guess that my language skills were<br>that of around a<br>four-year-old I could have very basic<br>conversations after around 3 months I<br>infiltrated a small group of volunteers<br>living and working in Taren so five<br>Australians were there as Australian<br>youth ambassadors for development and<br>one um British person was there as part<br>of the Vol volunteer services overseas<br>it was really nice to speak quickly<br>again and to fall back into using<br>Australian<br>vernacular for the second block of<br>fieldwork I lived with the Australians<br>in a house we called the palace but it<br>wasn't really that palatial but it did<br>have flush toilets and there were<br>showers with reasonable water pressure<br>though it was still cold water and it<br>had high ceilings I'd hit my head on the<br>ceiling a few times in the previous<br>house so I appreciated<br>this for the research SE Arch I<br>conducted 364 household surveys in total<br>across Tarin and a neighboring<br>municipality and collected data on<br>consumption uses of water water sources<br>amount paid per month affordability and<br>opinions and experience related to Water<br>Services they were receiving I<br>characterized data according to water<br>utility and analyze these data according<br>to<br>income income level and land use<br>population density and Landscape as well<br>as household oh I said income these<br>categories reflected categories adopted<br>by the provincial planning and<br>development office and the tugan City<br>Planning and Development Office I<br>conducted interviews with<br>representatives from both water<br>utilities provincial and city government<br>um officials and um<br>officers the National Water Resources<br>board Nos and other key informants I<br>read Republic acts presidential<br>proclamations executive orders codes<br>policies regulations and implementation<br>guidelines to piece together the complex<br>web of laws and policies regulating<br>water supply I spent hours in the office<br>of the behold Chronicle the local<br>newspaper finding articles that discuss<br>matters relevant to my topic I limited<br>my time frame to the period 1995 to<br>2004 which is a long time when you were<br>reading hard copies and they read like<br>twister plot um novels so a story might<br>start say on page four then tell you to<br>go to the back page and then back to<br>page<br>two it's very timec consuming process<br>I read technical reports prepared as<br>part of development projects though I<br>never managed to track down the fabled<br>adab report that was frequently<br>mentioned but no one ever seemed to have<br>a copy and in fact no one had ever seen<br>it so I um but everyone referred to it I<br>also took lots of photos of water meter<br>Stouts this was my favorite I had people<br>on the lookout for me for water meter<br>Stouts which is just where water meters<br>are became obs with<br>them um I also took photos of reservoirs<br>pumping stations Wells and other sources<br>household relied upon households relied<br>upon to meet their water<br>needs I<br>theorized I'll put it on this guy I<br>theorize hybrid governance Arrangements<br>wherein public private engagement with<br>water provision and interjurisdictional<br>water sharing have emerged as a<br>consequence of global discourses and<br>local practice practices manif testing<br>in place I demonstrated how households<br>experience of water supply in the<br>physical environment influenced<br>decisions about household allocation and<br>perceptions about household uh human<br>environment interactions and water<br>security I also demonstrated how<br>household understandings of water<br>governance are divorced from formal<br>conceptions of water governance I<br>identified risks with an overemphasis on<br>network expansion without due<br>consideration of Water Resource<br>Management and how this may lead to<br>Greater levels of consumption I also<br>found that in this case privatization<br>had worked although people's<br>expectations and levels of the service<br>and perceptions of the relationship<br>between water<br>utilities and consumers differed between<br>those served by B water and those served<br>by tug Len City<br>water from this project I became<br>interested in novel governance<br>arrangements for for water and in<br>particular the interactions between<br>formal and informal institutions and<br>between statutary and non-statutory<br>processes and<br>practices after finishing the PhD worked<br>ATU for a few months as an RA and then<br>in January 2008 I moved to the<br>University of Auckland after a semester<br>teaching into geography tourism and<br>environmental planning at the University<br>of<br>years of uh we're a blur they are a blur<br>of new lectures and learning to<br>supervise on the Fly and trying<br>desperately to build my research program<br>I had financial support in the form of<br>new staff grants which led me to design<br>a small project focus on water security<br>and tourism based development in the<br>Philippines in a different municipality<br>this time and conducted yet more field<br>work but it was very it was a very<br>different experience in the sense I was<br>used to spending uh weeks if not months<br>in the field whereas this was this<br>project the field was reduced to two or<br>three weeks at the most for me doing<br>intensive field based research in the<br>Philippines got to be too hard and other<br>opportunities arose that me my Lone Wolf<br>researcher days were<br>over my research in the Philippines was<br>crucial in terms of building experience<br>confidence and gaining research SK<br>skills both in terms of the usual<br>writing methodological and analytical<br>skills that are developed through<br>research training as well as learning to<br>troubleshoot to be adaptable and to do<br>things on the<br>fly in the next phase of my research<br>trajectory I engaged in more<br>collaborative research activities that<br>were initially interdisciplinary but<br>invol evolved to include<br>transdisciplinary research one of my key<br>collaborators over the past nine years<br>is associate professor Meg Parsons in<br>2015 Meg and I were awarded a mden which<br>focused on co-governance and<br>co-management of the wiar river<br>following a treaty<br>settlement the project was the<br>culmination of a fairly long period of<br>Engagement with ntim man Porto which<br>arose somewhat<br>opportunistically I'd attended a hooie<br>at one of our mudi with my mother um<br>about something completely unrelated to<br>the WIA a to work and someone I spoke to<br>mentioned to me that the settlement<br>negotiations were taking place in<br>respect of the river I followed up with<br>someone in the trust board then started<br>going along to huie and wananga and<br>ended up working with and for ntim Man<br>portal on matters relating to the<br>WIA given my interest in novel<br>governance Arrangements I was curious<br>about how the proposed governance and<br>management Arrangements would be<br>operationalized and what they would mean<br>for NTI Man portal and the<br>river working with Meg is amazing for so<br>many reasons not least of which is that<br>she is a prolific<br>writer we produce at least six Journal<br>articles related to the project plus a<br>book and presented at numerous<br>conferences seminars and symposia this<br>work was driven overwhelmingly by Meg we<br>also worked with postgraduate students<br>and others in completing the work so we<br>have one honors dissertation and one<br>Master's thesis associated with the<br>project as well we've co-authored a lot<br>uh co-supervised taught on the same<br>courses and supported each other on a<br>range of different things we're both ex<br>wal grads who did phds in Australia so<br>we also have that in<br>common at around the same time we uh we<br>were rewarded the mden I also became<br>involved in the sustainable Seas<br>National Science challenge but this<br>opportunity was preceded by another<br>opportunity provided to me by Richard<br>leerin and Simon thrush who for whatever<br>reason I have no idea why involved me in<br>an interdisciplinary project called<br>Marine futures from 2012 to 2014 this is<br>also around the time that Nick Lewis and<br>I started working together he probably<br>wishes he could time<br>travel um Richard Nick Simon and I<br>designed and ran scenario workshops to<br>investigate management Pathways to<br>sustainable Marine management with<br>participants from a range of<br>organizations and agencies from<br>government to<br>NOS my involvement in Marine Futures put<br>me on the radar of those involved in the<br>early days of sustainable<br>Seas sustainable Seas was a hugely<br>important part of my life life for 9<br>years anyone involved with the science<br>challenges knows what I<br>mean I started as a project leader for a<br>project called navigating Marine social<br>ecological systems I had no idea about<br>budgets FTE Contracting Milestones or<br>the difference between a milestone and<br>an output but I was lucky to work<br>closely with a former PhD student Kate<br>Davies in delivering on the research so<br>we could learn<br>together Carolyn lunis was my theme<br>leader and she provided amazing guidance<br>to and me I had no previous experience<br>in leading a team of researchers or a<br>larger project with multiple work<br>streams I was used to doing things on my<br>own and on a Sho string or on the sniff<br>of an oily rag but we managed to make it<br>work in addition to generating research<br>outputs the project generated an<br>additional project that involved working<br>with research Partners in central<br>government industry and Regional<br>councils following this first phase of<br>sustainable Seas my proficiency and MB<br>speak grew and I learned to comply with<br>the demands of quarterly and annual<br>reporting sadly we didn't solve the<br>problem of how to better manage<br>cumulative effects which had been our<br>hard for phase two of sustainable Seas I<br>was appointed to the challenge<br>leadership team in 2019 to lead<br>enhancing ecosystem based management<br>practices research theme as a member of<br>the<br>CLT uh we were responsible for the<br>challenges strategic Direction science<br>quality activities and<br>management the projects and the<br>enhancing evbm theme focus on law policy<br>and governance arrangements to support<br>and enhance the implementation of<br>ebm projects and these themes considered<br>the relationship between to wangi tikari<br>and the marine environment policy and<br>legislation for ecosystem based<br>management scale in ecosystem based<br>management and ecosystem based<br>Management in kak<br>Tanga in addition to being the theme<br>leader I was a research on three of<br>these projects to varying<br>degrees the theme represented a<br>consolidation of my interest in<br>exploring institutional arrangements to<br>regulate access to and use of and use of<br>resources that goes back to my Master's<br>research and which continued through my<br>PhD research and the mom project the key<br>difference with sustainable C's research<br>was the inter and transdisciplinary<br>nature of the<br>projects I'd work with marine ecologists<br>and I just basically call anyone who<br>does science in the marine environment a<br>marine ecologist but this provided an<br>opportunity to also work with planning<br>researchers legal Scholars economists<br>and people who worked in the real world<br>Beyond<br>Academia the learning involved in<br>working with researchers with such<br>diverse backgrounds was immense and<br>provided me with invaluable insights<br>into the challenges of translating<br>science into policy the weaknesses and<br>strengths of legal legal Frameworks to<br>achieve social and ecological outcomes<br>and the potential for transformative<br>change through collaborative<br>non-statutory plans and Arrangements at<br>times it was also<br>fun one of the frustrations that I've<br>had as a researcher interested in<br>governance is how can you affect change<br>it is easy to critique but it is far<br>more difficult to take action<br>sustainable CES provided a pathway to<br>potentially bring about changes in how<br>the Marine man environment is managed<br>the academic work completed across the<br>challenge provides a strong evidence<br>base for resource managers whomever they<br>might be to take action<br>the outputs arising from the enhancing<br>ebm theme identified high level actions<br>to enact transformative change as well<br>as more targeted interventions to modify<br>processes and practices at smaller<br>scales I was very excited to co-lead to<br>applied policy projects that involved<br>working with regional councils to<br>consider how to embed ebm principles<br>into their planning and policy<br>processes these projects were sometimes<br>described as not being research projects<br>and to date I haven't published um<br>academic outputs from them but the<br>things I learned by working with people<br>in Regional councils and how I approach<br>other research projects including PhD<br>projects I supervis and also how and<br>what I<br>teach research activities in the final<br>two years of sustainable Seas emphasize<br>synthesis and research impact so the<br>kinds of outputs we produced were<br>directed to end users to support them in<br>utilizing the research in their own<br>practices these activities were<br>intensive in the sense of needing to<br>take the time to work with those likely<br>to use the products so they were<br>relevant to them and required different<br>kinds of writing namely I had to write<br>things in plain English with short<br>sentences and no jargon and the comm's<br>team turned my uninspired word documents<br>into guidance documents and briefs that<br>were far more visually appealing than<br>anything I can<br>do I couldn't find the photo I swear<br>there is a photo of the CLT but I was<br>unable to find it but working as part of<br>the challenge leadership team was an<br>amazing experience gained a ton of<br>experience in research leadership and<br>strategy while working with an amazing<br>group of people in addition to those<br>listed I'd also like to acknowledge Abby<br>Davenport and Lisa Bragg for their<br>excellent organizing of flights and<br>chloee<br>haki over the course of five years we<br>had many many many meetings to discuss<br>strategic and operational aspects<br>related to The Challenge in addition to<br>in-person meetings at Nea great point we<br>met on Skype for business zoom and teams<br>we were doing it before it was<br>cool I miss working with my colleagues<br>though I am fortunate to have kept<br>working with some of them on other<br>projects but I will admit I do not miss<br>the quarterly reporting it's just been<br>the 30th of September no quarterly<br>reports so far I've talked mostly about<br>my research but obviously there is more<br>to the job than that though my academic<br>career like many others I'm sure<br>doesn't divide neatly into the into<br>discreet FTE allocations of research<br>teaching and service there is<br>considerable blurring of these<br>categories which I've been actively<br>promoting as I've Advanced throughout my<br>career in many cases students have<br>provided the Catalyst for pursuing new<br>research interests and for enabling me<br>to work with different colleagues with<br>expertise in areas completely different<br>to<br>mine for example Kate Davies who I<br>supervised for her Masters and PhD was<br>my first transdisciplinary PhD student<br>and my first time supervising with Simon<br>thrush Mark Dixon and Richard laran Kate<br>developed a novel participatory modeling<br>method to enable the inclusion of a<br>diverse group of participants in a rapid<br>process of identifying valuing and<br>considering trade-offs associated with<br>the ecosystems ecosystem services in the<br>Monaco haror Simon Mark and I joined<br>forces again to supervise Andrew Allison<br>whose PhD involved developing a new<br>methodology for investigating the<br>controlling dynamics of shallow esterine<br>systems using a transdisciplinary<br>agent-based modeling approach I named<br>the<br>agents Victoria Sidle formerly jolins<br>introduced me to tuna fisheries and<br>Fisheries more generally and we continue<br>to work together on Fisheries related<br>topics and she also contributes to my<br>postgrad course most recently by<br>delivering a lecture on gender and<br>Resource<br>Management Victoria took the course<br>herself in 2009 and Kate took the course<br>in 2008 and Andrew took the course in<br>later 200 something<br>else and I got to feel a bit artsy as<br>one of Gabby o Conor's supervisor<br>supervisors for her creative practice<br>PhD that she pursued as part of the<br>sustainable Seas navigating social<br>ecological systems project in other<br>cases student projects have allowed me<br>to live vicariously through them and to<br>indulge in my development studies<br>interests as they researched a range of<br>Topics in the Philippines Thailand<br>Myanmar La tuvalu Chile Indonesia Samoa<br>Mongolia and many other places and other<br>cases students work aligned neatly with<br>current projects so such as those<br>focused on for example Urban water<br>supply freshwater governance and<br>management and Marine<br>management I've um had a few more<br>completions since then at Jr so I've<br>supervised a total of 93 postgraduate<br>students to completion across honors<br>Masters and PhD one of my current<br>students is supervis number 100 but I<br>don't know which one I have a<br>spreadsheet the spreadsheet will<br>decide I'm not sure but I reckon I could<br>come close to naming them though it<br>might take me a little little while and<br>I'm and I'm not going to do it now I<br>tend to forget the students I'm<br>currently supervising not the ones I<br>have<br>supervised the breadth of topics is<br>enormous which is exciting though<br>sometimes it can be a little tricky<br>trying to keep up and trying to keep up<br>to to date on the very diverse areas<br>that my students are<br>investigating one thing that Delights me<br>is seeing where my former students end<br>up and especially when they end up<br>working together as happened with a<br>cohort at Nea until<br>recently I've also worked with Summer<br>Scholars and a bunch of research<br>assistants on a range of different<br>topics I'm delighted to be in a position<br>to support young researchers and<br>learning more about the practice of<br>research and helping them to attend<br>conferences to broaden their experiences<br>beyond the confines of the beyond the<br>confines of the<br>thesis I've benefited from the<br>generosity of others so feel fortunate<br>to be able to pay it<br>forward something that has brought me<br>immense pleasure is helping to build a<br>community among geography researchers<br>across New Zealand in 2013 I founded the<br>women and gender geography research<br>network with with the very convenient<br>acronym of wigin<br>with encouragement from Nick Lewis and<br>support from Linda Johnston and Robin<br>Longhurst and others in the school of<br>environment and the New Zealand<br>geographical Society such as Anne pomoy<br>and John Overton the focus of the group<br>was Network collaboration and support to<br>further Equity outcomes and<br>intersectional Justice with a focus on<br>gender between 2013 and 2018 we had<br>regular online meetings as well as<br>in-person<br>symposiums we organized conference<br>sessions in New Zealand and Australia<br>and prepared had a special issue of the<br>New Zealand<br>geographer an Oakland based offshoot of<br>this networ network is the PO y writing<br>Collective who takes its commitment to<br>slow scholarship very<br>seriously wigren was a Association I was<br>connected to esoi or the engaged social<br>science Network and when funding for<br>that concluded it was difficult to M<br>maintain momentum that said wigin wigren<br>was reimagined and reformed as Gaga and<br>2020 which<br>Alor um thanks in large part again to<br>Linda Johnston so Linda and I currently<br>co- convene Gaga and we continue to meet<br>regularly Oakland is hosting next week<br>and we are planning to get together at<br>the upcoming New Zealand geographical<br>Society conference in November where<br>Gaga members are also convening a<br>session despite working in seeming<br>seemingly diverse locations there are<br>few obvious similarities between<br>tagbilaran and<br>unga I've been interested in trying to<br>find and to understand similarities<br>across difference the theoretical<br>Frameworks I draw upon which are many<br>and vared to be fair have departed from<br>economic development theory<br>post-development Theory and political<br>ecology but traces of these the theories<br>still inflict my thinking and how I come<br>to understand new problems and<br>ideas the places of my journey of<br>becoming an academic are not limited to<br>academic spaces or spaces of academic<br>activity and the people who have<br>mentored and supported me are not just<br>academic mentors there are so many<br>people I could acknowledge and thank and<br>I my usual uh approach is to not thank<br>anyone so that way I'm being<br>fair I could probably I could have<br>easily have spent the last 40 minutes<br>just talking about all the amazing<br>people I've encountered over the years<br>in addition to those named in various<br>acknowledgement sections of thesis and<br>articles there are a few others I like<br>to acknowledge and yeah I will miss<br>people um in addition to the ones<br>already named I would add Robin K who is<br>the head of school en environment and<br>has always been incredibly generous and<br>supportive along with previous heads Jr<br>Paul kench and Glenn<br>McGregor I work with wonderful<br>colleagues in the school of environment<br>as the geography discipline group lead<br>I've enjoyed working with the other<br>leads and arore especially when at times<br>things have been a bit tricky to<br>navigate I'm looking at you Mike<br>Ral Nick Lewis takes over from me very<br>soon Mel wall has provided me with<br>amazing advice and mentoring and and<br>mentoring on teaching and learning<br>design and more recently I've been<br>working with Caitlyn Barry who was a<br>learning design genius I completed the<br>women and Leadership program in 2012 and<br>was mentored by Julie Park and I also<br>met other amazing woman from um who were<br>doing the program from other parts of<br>the University so that was also really<br>good good thanks also to JC G Emma sharp<br>and Simon again for helping me to<br>prepare my promotion application last<br>year and to Brendan blue Nick Lewis<br>Kathy Campbell Jan Lindsay Lor striken<br>Richard leer and Willie Smith and many<br>many many others who've helped in<br>different ways with previous promotion<br>applications and my continuation<br>application and other things over the<br>years I feel I should also thank and<br>probably apologize to all of the<br>professional staff I've ever worked with<br>and thank you for your<br>patience sustainable Seas National<br>Science challenge ended on 30th June<br>2024 rather than rather than there being<br>a gaping void in my life I'm involved in<br>new projects some with new colleagues<br>and some colleagues I've worked with<br>before so um just to go through them the<br>emerging climatic pressures an amb<br>Endeavor Grant out of Lincoln agch has<br>nothing it all to do with lofer the<br>lofer is there for Julia Milani who I<br>where you there you are who I will be<br>working with on that project and to you<br>I say flippity jibbit now you owe me a<br>gin and<br>tonic um I'll be working with um Liz<br>mcferson at University of Canterbury who<br>I met through um sustainable Seas on her<br>RF for Discovery Fellowship which is<br>just<br>started and also I'm going to hang out<br>with Emma on hers where's Emma I saw you<br>before there you are um so that's really<br>exciting and I'm looking forward to all<br>of<br>that additionally for the last 5 years<br>or so I've been slowly working on a side<br>passion project to decolonize Ocean<br>Sciences I was going to decolonize the<br>ocean but I scaled it back so I plan on<br>hiring an army of raas to help move that<br>forward I have manuscripts I need to<br>return to Mig and emails that I haven't<br>replied to because I've been P<br>preoccupied by other things things<br>oops clearly I'm also looking forward to<br>marking I'm du to step down from some<br>service roles that I've hiled for a few<br>years so I look forward to sitting idly<br>and twiddling my thumbs because I think<br>that's what happens next so Kora</p></main><footer style="margin-top: 2rem; background:
