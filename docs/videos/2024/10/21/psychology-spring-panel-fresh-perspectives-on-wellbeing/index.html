a pleasure to um<br>present this to you from the School of<br>Psychology tiura henaro um here from<br>awaka where<br>um and um I'm just going to do quick<br>housekeeping and then hand over very<br>quickly because you want to really hear<br>from our amazing panel um so um<br>bathrooms are um out the door and then<br>behind this block that you see when you<br>walk outside of the door left and right<br>uh in case of uh emergency including<br>earthquakes we all head out these doors<br>or the back doors and then go down um<br>out towards the Old Government building<br>in this<br>area um yeah and without uh more of this<br>um oh yeah I just meant to say that um<br>we also record this um just so you know<br>um uh we record the session for some<br>people who could not make it um and get<br>and the people in the room have uh the<br>also the when if you have registered you<br>can get the link and you can rewatch it<br>later as<br>well um so I would to like to introduce<br>um Dr uh Georgia Carson who's um uh<br>working at The meligan Institute and uh<br>we have the amazing luck to have her as<br>a moderator of this uh evening because<br>she is actually not a psychologist and I<br>think that's a good thing because she<br>has like a little bit of this outside<br>View and has not is not going to tempted<br>to fall into all this jargon that we<br>tend to sometimes and so it's a great<br>pleasure to have you thank you so much<br>and I'll hand it over to you thank you<br>now hedwick um yeah so as as hedwick<br>said I'm I'm not a psychologist um I<br>have a doctorate in cancer metabolism<br>genetics and lots of molecular stuff but<br>I know very very little about psychology<br>um so my job is total toal M engagement<br>advisor at The malagan Institute of<br>medical research um up at the celvin<br>campus and so we do um immunology and<br>biomedical research um so clinical<br>trials and that sort of thing um but<br>it's not about me so tonight um we have<br>very very esteemed uh and I'm been told<br>not to have psychologists because I made<br>them stay of translating people that<br>work in the School of Psychology with<br>psychologists but they are very esteemed<br>panelists and so instead of reading out<br>their<br>bios okay instead of reading out their<br>bios which you will probably already<br>have and in some cases you already know<br>them um I will instead ask them to talk<br>a little bit more about their research<br>and um especially how this idea of<br>well-being intersects interacts with the<br>research so first of all because you're<br>closest to me Dr Chris<br>neelon sure um I tried to hand the mic<br>along to Ellie but she refused to to<br>accept it um yeah Koto my name's Chris<br>um I'm uh a clinical psychologist been<br>working the last couple of years mainly<br>with ACC um and um working in a<br>concussion recovery space little bit of<br>sexual trauma and uh General mental<br>health and then this year I've been<br>lucky enough to join the um staff in the<br>School of Psychology uh to try to come<br>back to some of my PhD research which<br>was I'm really interested in I guess um<br>the concept of mental disorder and I use<br>the word concept in the sense of how do<br>individuals think about mental disorder<br>what do they take it to be<br>um and how does that vary across people<br>and can we<br>maybe think of some<br>ways some ways of thinking about this<br>thing we call mental disorder or things<br>we call mental disorder maybe more<br>advantageous than others um and that's<br>probably enough to give you a sense of<br>what I'm interested<br>I'm<br>Ellie I and I do research that<br>looks<br>at a lot and um kind of more in a<br>clinical clinical space I am still in<br>the clinical psychology program so I'm<br>studying to become like<br>um yeah but uh my PhD looked at<br>perfectionism so setting like really<br>high standards for ourselves that aren't<br>always<br>realistic and how maldi so Mal<br>adolesence experienced that and how that<br>was different to our kind of uh more<br>general or Western understanding of<br>perfectionism um I also do a bit of<br>non-suicidal self-injury research so<br>self harm things like cutting um again<br>quite related to M but also more<br>generally um as well and then the last<br>thing that I'm really interested in at<br>the moment is kind of M student<br>experiences in Western institutions<br>versus m medium education yeah that's<br>me okay and Dr met Hamond over to you k<br>my name is Matt I study relationships I<br>study relationships from people hooking<br>up to people breaking up uh and all of<br>its in between hooking up and breaking<br>up uh so my research intersects with<br>well-being all the way through I mean uh<br>falling in love tends to be uh one of<br>the peak experiences people report<br>having in their entire lives uh it tends<br>to be associated with a heap of uh good<br>feelings and a heap of really terrifying<br>anxious bad feelings uh the same as<br>breaking up um easier to think about the<br>the bad feelings of breaking up but<br>there's a lot of good feelings that go<br>along with breaking up too sometimes and<br>the bits in between often involve<br>supporting one another and interpersonal<br>support and the support that people give<br>one another is one of the fundamental<br>things that we need for our well-being<br>uh behind air and food but but probably<br>third uh is is my guess yes K okay this<br>is uh very interesting and I'm looking<br>forward to digging into this more you<br>folks so I know it's a little bit of a<br>cliche to kind of start with definitions<br>and etc etc but I wondered if you folks<br>could tell me what your conception of<br>well-being like what is your definition<br>if people ask you because I think rather<br>than naively I've got more of a health<br>bias and so I think of well-being as<br>like not got cancer not got diabetes um<br>and and and maybe the mental health<br>stuff I'm like oh happy I I have a very<br>simplistic idea of it so maybe you could<br>give us a little bit more nuance and how<br>especially maybe how the public<br>understanding of of well-being might<br>differ to you as as experts if that<br>makes sense yeah oh what a big gigantic<br>cool question that is uh I guess part of<br>what we're going to get into later on is<br>also how this can differ across people<br>and across the world uh so I'll start<br>with the easier bit which is what do I<br>do in my research how do I study<br>well-being if if you were to come into<br>the lab and and and report your<br>well-being what would we be doing I<br>would be asking you questions and<br>getting you to answer them and you would<br>tell me uh in my research we trust<br>people to have the best uh idea of<br>whether they're well or not uh partly<br>that's an advantage of not being in a<br>super clinical space where I don't need<br>to worry too much about people being so<br>detached from what's going on in their<br>bodies and minds but for the most part<br>for the people I interact with I ask<br>them questions and and if they say<br>they're well I go that person's doing<br>well and if they say they're not at all<br>well then I'm concerned and for the most<br>part our research bears that out to be<br>really accurate because the people who<br>say they aren't well tend to overtime<br>become more sick become less well uh<br>report worse outcomes in their jobs and<br>their lives the people who say they're<br>doing better and their relationships are<br>doing better the complete opposite they<br>tend to do better in education in the<br>work in in their lives so yeah uh easy<br>answer from me probably more complicated<br>next um<br>wellbeing I think it is different for<br>everyone kind of like what Matt said<br>um yeah this this is a hard question you<br>can just you can just step it it's okay<br>um for me personally I think uh it's not<br>just like the medical or physical side<br>it is the it's the mental side but it's<br>also how you doing in your<br>relationships with your family with your<br>friends um for me personally like how<br>connected am I to my Mara um have I been<br>back to my marai um do I know my<br>language that kind of thing is it's<br>really important for my well-being and I<br>find that when I do those things I do<br>actually feel a lot better but I agree<br>with what Matt said about we kind of<br>trust that most people know what being<br>well is for themselves um something I<br>like to do with my students is ask them<br>hey what does wellbeing actually look<br>like for you and then in the lecture I<br>get them to talk about it and then I put<br>out blue photos of what wellbeing is for<br>me so it'll be like a picture of me with<br>my friends my cat that kind of thing um<br>and it kind of it makes people think a<br>little bit more about oh I didn't<br>realize that those things kind of come<br>into well-being or that they could and<br>yeah helps to broaden their kind of<br>perspective on that a bit more but yeah<br>so<br>um I kind of have two responses to that<br>question and I um am terribly indecisive<br>so I might just go with both um one is<br>that<br>I'm<br>frustrated I I<br>both and confused by exactly what in<br>full support of what you guys are saying<br>in terms of the um what do we mean by<br>well-being when it seems to vary across<br>everyone um and sometimes for me that<br>comes from it when you you see the word<br>well-being all over the place when we<br>were planning this evening we were<br>thinking like what word do we want to<br>use and wellbeing seems like the best<br>fit but we hear the word so often now I<br>almost feel it Like H A of a cliche it's<br>become a bit of a cliche and and but if<br>it invites the kind of consideration<br>that Ellie is is talking about and this<br>question of am I well then um then it's<br>a useful conversation to have for me um<br>how it intersects with my research<br>obviously I'm interested in mental<br>disorder and for me that relationship<br>this is the<br>second uh response that I have to this<br>question um mental disorder uh or<br>whatever labels we want to refer to that<br>significant challenges in one's mental<br>health um is sort of a smaller defined<br>concept um and outside of that<br>well-being uh problems in well-being<br>probably becomes an even bigger concept<br>and then well-being and each each step<br>we take out it seems to become a bit<br>blurrier almost and a bit harder to<br>Define um but I think probably the best<br>answer that I have heard one that stuck<br>with me was um by Simon Keller in the<br>philosophy department at ve he had a got<br>to get this right now um he had a a<br>tentative definition where he said<br>well-being one way we might Define it is<br>that it is<br>somebody's uh degree or their capacity<br>to live their version of their good life<br>um the degree to which they feel<br>prepared to action and carve out the<br>life that works for them and what they<br>want it to be um which is very blurry<br>which brings me back to that initial<br>frustration that's kind of where my<br>thoughts go with that question okay<br>because I know you in particular wanted<br>to kind of dig into that question a<br>little bit more about okay what is<br>well-being and how does that relate to<br>both mental health and what we are<br>calling mental disorders so maybe if we<br>could talk a bit more about that like<br>also who gets to decide is it that<br>person or is it their clinician or is it<br>their friends Ino and can may be<br>somebody that has uh we maybe would call<br>a mental disorder can they lead a good<br>life regardless or I don't know these<br>are just some question I'm thinking<br>about how ex the easy<br>questions sorry sorry I'm thinking of<br>more questions that I haven't even run<br>down no they they're very good questions<br>to be asking again it sort of fits that<br>and the the pictures that I've got in my<br>head um uh something like you know<br>recognized patterns of mental distress<br>that seem similar enough across the<br>population institutions like Psychiatry<br>and Clinical Psychology have have sort<br>of put put these labels in place because<br>the patterns they're not perfect but<br>they seem roughly similar enough and<br>we've put a label on<br>that there are probably there are<br>certainly patterns of mental health<br>difficulty that do not fit those labels<br>well um but outside of that tighter<br>concept of a mental health problem we<br>might have this Brader concept of mental<br>health which is used in different ways<br>and seems to be one facet of well-being<br>but then not having cancer is another<br>right in the physical health side of<br>things<br>um and so that's hope that hopefully<br>alludes to how I sort of see the<br>relationship between those things um but<br>the second kind of arm of the very many<br>questions you were discussing there are<br>um is perhaps a lot more challenging uh<br>the idea of who gets to decide I think<br>when we're talking about something as<br>contested and blurry as well being I<br>think Matt's initial answer is probably<br>on the money sometimes we've just got to<br>ask people there are certain particular<br>cases where something might be getting<br>in the way of what a what um we might<br>call Insight uh but outside of that most<br>of the time that the person's going to<br>be the the best measure of how well they<br>are in this broader sense but to<br>recognize and label particular patterns<br>of difficulty like the process of<br>diagnosis and who gets to do that that's<br>a more complicated question and I don't<br>know if we have time to to dig into all<br>that tonight yeah I might avoid that one<br>do any of you two have anything to add<br>to that cord at<br>all<br>not no okay um so to talk a little bit<br>more about Mental Health and again it's<br>yeah it's kind of like wellbeing it's a<br>bit of a buzz word do you have any<br>thoughts about whether the stigma around<br>mental health is changing like certainly<br>I can think of my parents and maybe<br>grandparents generation you didn't want<br>to say anything like about being<br>depressed or anxious and my generation<br>which is very Millennial and younger<br>they certainly it appears that we're<br>more open with saying hey actually no I<br>am struggling is that just<br>uh an impression I have not backed up by<br>data does anybody know um I don't know<br>about datawise but I think definitely<br>with the younger Generations it is a lot<br>less stigmatized but I think that comes<br>as a double-edged sword um on the one<br>hand it's amazing that people can be<br>open about this and not feel like<br>they're alone because I think that's one<br>of the harder things about the fact that<br>mental<br>illness was stigmatized for so long um<br>but with things like social media where<br>people can share unsafe um expressions<br>of mental health so things like on<br>Tumblr<br>um sharing pictures of like<br>anorexia um purging<br>binging cutting<br>behaviors uh and Suicidal<br>Thoughts if someone gets onto that side<br>of social media is really hard to get<br>off of that side because of things like<br>algorithms AI um so I think when people<br>are sharing their personal<br>experiences I think it's amazing and it<br>can be really really uplifting for those<br>who have also experienced that but there<br>is a line that does get crossed um and<br>as much as social media platforms can<br>try to censor<br>really un unhelpful<br>photos um there's only so much that they<br>can do and yeah algorithms don't work<br>that well to pick out every single like<br>um different word that people use for<br>those behaviors so I think yes um and I<br>hope that it<br>continues to become less stigmatized I<br>would say it's definitely more so for<br>things like anxiety<br>depression self harm even to a point but<br>for the more um things like BPD bipolar<br>disorder um schizophrenia I would say<br>that they're actually still pretty<br>stigmatized um because they have been<br>associated with really violent behavior<br>for a really long long time which isn't<br>always the case in fact it's more often<br>than not not the case um yeah that's my<br>thoughts anybody else anything to add<br>maybe about the stigma or about the<br>social media aspects of wellness<br>and sure that's some of my research is<br>into social media and connection<br>and what people would get out of it if<br>you're in the audience and and you hear<br>that and you go why would you ever want<br>to go on a website and and share<br>something like anorexia or what do you<br>gain out of that uh the relationships<br>person is going to say it's<br>relationships and one of the reasons<br>it's so untractable and so difficult to<br>get people out is<br>because uh we need validation really<br>deeply we love someone saying yeah<br>you're right it's a very human thing<br>deeply human yeah see right now you said<br>that I'm right<br>and and and I felt so good<br>you and and often when we're wrong we<br>want someone to tell us that we're right<br>if if you've ever gone home after an<br>argument with someone and your partner<br>has said well how how come they said<br>that did did they maybe they picked up<br>something that you didn't pick up how<br>frustrating is that even if that's<br>exactly what happened right what you<br>want when you go to a friend or a<br>partner I need it you want them to be<br>like no that's the worst person I've<br>ever heard about in the whole world<br>you're such an idiot yeah you want that<br>first and then later on maybe once you<br>have that validation you can get past<br>the things so validation becomes so<br>important and uh and I think that's the<br>one of the double-edged swords is that I<br>do think stigma has gone down and I<br>think part of that is the opportunity to<br>find sources of validation online<br>because you can now look up anything you<br>want to validate about anything online<br>and find at least one person who feels<br>the same way and go hey I've got a<br>friend now which is easy way to make<br>friends it's pretty hard to make friends<br>sometimes that was an easy way to find<br>the person online who feels really<br>lonely and go I feel the same way as you<br>do uh and so yeah with that acceptance<br>and and lowering of stigma we now see<br>some of the costs that come along with<br>that where there are things that are<br>being validated that we don't think are<br>healthy<br>I think bouncing off both of your points<br>there is some emerging concern and um<br>and I don't think the the data is we're<br>not at the stage where we've done the<br>empirical work but there's some emerging<br>concern um anecdotally and and sort of<br>theoretically around potentially the the<br>the depth of how far that validation can<br>take people and how that intersects with<br>that that question around diagnosis and<br>who gets to decide you know you've<br>probably heard the the big headlines<br>maybe around Tik Tock diagnosis and<br>these kinds of things and it is a<br>legitimate concern I think um people<br>identifying with a label that denotes<br>something is wrong with me<br>um but I think to to bring things back<br>around to to Allie's point there is<br>still a lot more at this stage at least<br>I think I'm comfortable saying there's<br>still so much more good that comes with<br>greater awareness of these kinds of<br>difficulties um we should be concerned<br>and cautious around some of the other<br>side of the sword that Ellie's talking<br>about but um it doesn't mean that we<br>need to to throw out all that good of of<br>having greater awareness and being more<br>able to have these these kinds of<br>conversations probably a n n positive<br>but we can still try to figure out ways<br>to navigate the these things that are<br>coming up as well yeah great um so maybe<br>also is part of this lowering of stigma<br>that we think is going on people and may<br>be more likely to reach out to um not<br>just social media but Healthcare<br>Providers and because I am aware that<br>there might be some members of the<br>public um also like me not um member of<br>the psychological Community um can we<br>just make sure that we've covered so<br>what I said in the first case about that<br>difference between because I still don't<br>think I have a good sense of this U the<br>difference between a counselor a<br>psychiatrist and a psychologist and so<br>you're starting to investigate which one<br>do I need what might somebody that is<br>aware that they want to address some<br>aspect of their well-being what might<br>they be able to expect from each of<br>these different<br>people I think that's a very useful<br>question to ask um because a lot of the<br>public are quite confused um yeah I<br>would regularly get referred to as a<br>psychiatrist by by people that I've been<br>working with for for a little while and<br>you're like is it worth having this<br>conversation get a t-shirt made yeah<br>yeah so um perhaps I'll start with those<br>two uh or the difference between and and<br>then you guys can jump in on the other<br>ones<br>um<br>Psychiatry<br>is a a part of the Medical Institution<br>so somebody trains they go through<br>General Medical Training and then uh<br>they special to become a psychiatrist<br>whereas a psychologist um or a and a<br>clinical<br>psychologist um we come from the science<br>of psychology and it's been sort of<br>turned around to okay so now how do we<br>use this science to perhaps find ways to<br>figure out um how we can help people but<br>not we don't have the background medical<br>training in practice that does come<br>quite a bit of overlap but that's the<br>key collaborate together oh absolutely<br>yeah um yeah but there is in practice a<br>fair amount of overlap coming at it<br>slightly differently I see the<br>fundamental difference or the<br>fundamental skill that a psych this is<br>probably a contentious question to ask<br>but the fundamental skill that a<br>psychologist brings I think is that we<br>try to<br>explain what is going on we try to go<br>Beyond just labeling and we try to say<br>okay but why is that happening how does<br>that make sense in the context of a<br>person's life and history um and what we<br>know about human behavior so and then we<br>work from that understand or that<br>explanation um and try to figure out a<br>way um that might help<br>um yeah do you guys have anything you<br>um I'm also probably biased cuz I am<br>studying to be a Clans like but um I<br>think kind of going off what Chris said<br>clinical psychologists do the explaining<br>part and then we also do the afterwards<br>okay how do we cope with<br>these um behaviors rather than my<br>understanding of Psychiatry is that they<br>quite often jump to um medication first<br>but that might be entirely wrong I'm not<br>100% sure um they can prescribe<br>medication we can't as cles neither can<br>counselors and that's because they have<br>the medical training behind them um<br>counselors I it's just a different<br>pathway really<br>um yeah I'm not 100% sure either so<br>sorry that might not be very helpful<br>no I I I think I share your your point<br>around it counselor is harder to Define<br>and I think that's be partially because<br>it is other a little bit because it's<br>less um legally constrained as well as a<br>term it's more open there are um yeah<br>it's less there is still reg some<br>regulation but it is less regulated and<br>so you get quite a lot of variety in<br>terms of different schools of thought<br>within counseling um some very much are<br>there to listen and validate and bounce<br>back some do offer support you get it's<br>hard to Define but generally for the<br>most part counselors are there to be<br>supportive listen and help you maybe<br>come up with your own problems but that<br>might not match all counselors because<br>there's a huge amount of variety there<br>as well but for instance like a GP would<br>be a good starting point for somebody<br>maybe to get advice to try to navigate<br>where to go absolutely GP are well<br>versed in helping people uh navigate the<br>system yeah great um Alie what you said<br>about medication thought that this might<br>be a good way to ask about um how much<br>do you think of of wellbeing as like<br>located in the body like what is it what<br>is the difference between and then use<br>that as a as a segue to go into maybe<br>some M more holistic conceptions of<br>wellbeing which I know we want to talk<br>um<br>yeah I mean I guess like I said at the<br>start I think of well-being as kind of<br>all of those facets of your life so I<br>think there is a part of it that is<br>within our bodies um but I think that<br>there are parts that are<br>like not tied to our bodies at all um<br>that's all I'm really going to say about<br>that but I can talk about the mildy<br>stuff<br>um yeah mildy I guess the way that I<br>view wellbeing is actually very<br>consistent with a mildy view of<br>wellbeing or whole order um hands up if<br>we've heard of T<br>tapaa<br>yeah mean so yeah you're probably<br>listening to me speak and you're like oh<br>that's something kind of familiar um we<br>also have a little booklet if you don't<br>have one front there's a little activity<br>in here and that is derived from um tap<br>because I feel like a lot of personally<br>as well until this year a lot of the<br>time we get told about TI SAA but we<br>don't actually know how to use it right<br>you're like okay I understand it's the<br>physical side it's the mental side it's<br>the relationship side and it's my like<br>spiritual side whether that's um<br>religion culture anything like that<br>but how do I actually put this into<br>practice and that activity in there is<br>like a really quick and easy way for you<br>to check in with yourself about which<br>side of my well-being am I doing really<br>well in and which sides am I maybe not<br>doing so well in at the moment and it's<br>yeah it's really quick really easy um I<br>think for mildy<br>too<br>um it's not just considering like what<br>wellbeing is it's considering what being<br>unwell is and actually I don't think<br>that's just for M I think that's for<br>everyone um because how can we know what<br>well-being is if we don't know know what<br>being unwell<br>is I feel like I'm saying well a<br>lot<br>well<br>sorry um but yeah for for Mali I think a<br>lot of it comes back to colonization and<br>I know that people are sick of hearing<br>about colonization but it actually still<br>has such a massive impact on<br>wellbeing<br>um yeah it's I mean it's led to people<br>being in lower<br>socioeconomics um<br>situations there are lower expectations<br>for Mali in terms of performance there<br>is negative media portrayal which then<br>leads to stereotypes and yeah I think<br>it's really really important to consider<br>all of those parts of being unwell in<br>order to understand what thriving um<br>actually yeah um back to the very first<br>question of this whole panel I think<br>wellbeing is thriving not just<br>surviving yeah did you steal that quote<br>from someone absolutely absolutely I<br>stole that don't quote me on that it's<br>not mine<br>but oh it's Aristotle according to<br>qu but yeah I think it sums up<br>well-being really really nicely um and<br>kind of I think what you said at the<br>start maybe as well yeah thriving rather<br>than just getting through the day um<br>that's my<br>ramble does anyone have anything to add<br>either on maybe that Mind Body<br>Connection yeah Chris I mean because I<br>know for instance I learned very late in<br>life actually that exercise helps me<br>feel better and it was it was<br>embarrassing I was like 26 I was like oh<br>my gosh this actually works isn't it so<br>disappointing every time you're like<br>dang it actually works to go for a walk<br>and get some fresh<br>air um but yeah so how much of it do you<br>think any of the other two that mind<br>versus body thing I'm I'm very body<br>biased but any thoughts on that I think<br>I grabbed the mic because I firstly just<br>wanted to explain my stupid Aristotle<br>joke um it was partially a joke um but<br>but one I what um how did you phrase it<br>surviving not thriving thriving not<br>surviving uh not just surviving um one<br>much more articulate than my broad<br>waffle point at the start but the gist<br>of what you're saying that goes back to<br>um and I'm not not a like ancient Greek<br>kind of scholar or anything but I'm<br>pretty sure it goes back to the likes of<br>Aristotle and the concept of udonia the<br>idea of like living of carving out a<br>good life um udonia udonia um have to<br>Google yeah yeah I had to Google it as<br>well but apparently<br>um look asking me about the the body is<br>opening a can of worms um my part I I<br>said that my research is focused in on<br>on the concept of of mental disorder but<br>the other kind of side of it is that I'm<br>really interested in uh in the in ideas<br>of embodiment that that the mind is not<br>separate from the body to begin with um<br>and a whole bunch of related ideas um<br>and asking the question of what does<br>mental disorder or this thing we call<br>mental disorder what does it look like<br>when we start from that kind of<br>assumption because woven through the<br>very idea of mental disorder is that you<br>can have disorder that is mental that is<br>somehow separate to physical right it's<br>it's like they belong yeah and we keep<br>them in different books and we have<br>different professions that look at them<br>and so on being different yeah right why<br>why our teeth are really fundamentally<br>important and not just to our physical<br>well-being our teeth to run on to to<br>Riff Off Your example are hugely<br>important to our mental health right you<br>screw up your your teeth or you have<br>anyone who's ever had tooth pain anyone<br>who's ever had ongoing difficulties with<br>their teeth how it affects your eating<br>how it affects your daily routine um it<br>all these things are deeply deeply<br>integrated to the point that questions<br>like where is um where is is<br>well-being it almost like yeah because<br>well-being is not some magical energy<br>right it's a category that we either<br>know we're feeling it or we're not we're<br>and yeah I I I I think it it's not that<br>it's in the body it's something we're<br>maybe achieving with the body or we're<br>not and when I say that I'm not meaning<br>that in any sense that the mind is is<br>separate um like a duet maybe between<br>the mind and the body yeah like a a Mind<br>Body Connection thing the oh actually no<br>no no no I can run with that the best<br>metaphor that I have heard is that if if<br>the body is the orchestra we are the our<br>mind is the music it's not separate but<br>it is something did you steal that quote<br>as well no oh yes I stole it sorry I<br>thought you saying did you come up with<br>it no I think I might I might put might<br>have this wrong but I think that was<br>Evan Thompson he<br>had uh he is a very he's one of my<br>favorite authors most people wouldn't<br>know who that is um another quote in the<br>same Vein from him is that mind is not<br>in the brain much like flight is not in<br>the wings of a bird gee that's<br>yeah I know I wish I could come up with<br>Snippets like that but he's talking<br>about how it's not really separate in<br>the first place even talking about a<br>mindbody connection implies that they're<br>separate really mind seems to be<br>something that we're doing with our<br>whole body and brain as we navigate our<br>environments move through relationships<br>and figure out how to live a good life<br>life um and I just think he puts that so<br>well so I thought I'd squeeze it in<br>there<br>following do you have any F any thoughts<br>about either that surviving and thriving<br>or anything related to that uh I I was<br>thinking about the connection to the<br>body and I really like to to OFA as as<br>the general idea being that if you have<br>four walls holding everything together<br>they all have to connect with one<br>another and it would be weird to say<br>that one wall is driving the other or<br>one wall is where the well-being lives<br>and the other three walls<br>are there too uh if and I and imagine if<br>you've gone on a first date with someone<br>or if you're out with someone and you're<br>not qu quite sure it's a first date yet<br>and the first time you hold hands and<br>and you realize that you're on a date<br>and there's like an electric shock<br>through your body there's no electricity<br>there right there's nothing got zapped<br>but there's that feeling there that is<br>your experience of of yourself in your<br>mind in your body uh someone else is<br>there and why there is something I would<br>call spiritual about that experience<br>because 20 years into a relationship and<br>you hold hands with your partner not<br>really an electric shock there anymore<br>for most people personal experience<br>there's apparently there are like 5% of<br>people who like still feel that so if<br>you're in that like 5% of people who if<br>they're in love with someone the<br>butterflies never go away they feel that<br>kind of in love thing um come chat to me<br>and because that's so cool and it's<br>really interesting to to do research<br>with people who are like I'm so in love<br>with my partner and they've been<br>together for 20 years and everyone else<br>is like oh get a room I don't want to<br>anymore yeah but I'm very happy for<br>those of you who um oh gosh my partner<br>isn't watching this no I'm sure<br>not but yeah the point of of wellbeing<br>not not just being inside your mind<br>being inside other people too or inside<br>your connection with other people I<br>think is uh entirely<br>psychologically accurate it's it<br>captures such a nice idea in Psychology<br>right now oh yeah C by everyone um what<br>I actually think that we are probably<br>going to see if we can take some<br>audience questions I have some more<br>question I have I have hundreds of more<br>questions if if you know we need um but<br>I did want to make sure that the<br>audience had an opportunity to ask their<br>party their questions as well I think<br>did we maybe have some microphone run<br>know this<br>works um my question is just<br>um inspired by some of your uh comments<br>on social media and wellbe and I've just<br>been reading this book about virtual<br>humans and the role of artificial<br>intelligence and<br>how we may have ai mind clones that we<br>talk to um you know because they've F<br>fed with all this data from social media<br>about us and they might be able to look<br>after us when we get old or they could<br>be a coach or counselor to us as well<br>because often people find some people<br>find it easier to talk to AI B then to<br>another human being so I just wanted to<br>get your thoughts on how do you feel<br>that that point you are making on<br>knowing that you are well or not how<br>does technology come into play in<br>telling you not the Tik Tok kind of<br>telling you but something wrong but will<br>it get more intelligent in being able<br>to figure out that something's not well<br>here I think there was a black Mar on it<br>yeah<br>um I don't know but I think like AI in<br>everything online at the moment like<br>every single social media platform's got<br>like that AI chat that you can ask<br>questions to chat GPT is so readily<br>available um I do remember hearing about<br>someone in the engineering school is<br>doing research on um like Ai and how<br>people use it and someone was talking<br>about how they have formed like a<br>relationship with an AI bot um so I<br>think people can form those<br>relationships whether or not that is<br>healthy for us I don't know um there are<br>dangers with parasocial relationships<br>but humans have formed parasocial or<br>that's sorry that's jargon um a<br>parasocial relationship is where you<br>form a relationship with someone that<br>you don't actually know through like<br>film um social media that kind of thing<br>so like influencers<br>celebrities yeah um and yeah humans have<br>as long as celebrities have existed<br>humans have done those kinds of things<br>we form parasocial<br>relationships um so I don't really know<br>if that's much different with AI um yeah<br>I don't know if I answered your question<br>anyone else want to have<br>a yeah in 2011 there was a v paper<br>saying that uh we'll be in relationships<br>with robots by<br>2050 uh two years ago was the first<br>reported person who is in a committed<br>relationship with a robot with an AI<br>brain I they just say they are yeah well<br>is how we say it with<br>everyone go down there right that's how<br>we trust anyone who's in a relationship<br>uh so yeah and there are so there's a AI<br>app called replica where you sign up and<br>you have a AI romantic partner the app<br>currently has somewhere between 300,000<br>and 500,000 users so you could fill an<br>entire Wellington full of people who are<br>in relationships with an AI app so uh to<br>your question that's the future um I<br>really am curious of of does that make<br>you stressed out if if people are<br>logging on to an AI app that's been<br>trained with all of your past recordings<br>all of the things you've noted down and<br>is a a Ellie or a Chris AI are you<br>comfortable with that is that a cool<br>thing for them to be<br>using I don't know feels like a privacy<br>problem to anyway I don't know<br>um it's not actually me<br>so I guess but yeah I've never thought<br>about that so I will continue to think<br>great thear response<br>um yeah I<br>I I'm I'm really glad to hear your your<br>thoughts on that Matt because um I<br>thought that would be the case right<br>that humans build relationships it<br>doesn't surprise it's not necessarily<br>surprising that we'll build it with<br>whatever we're<br>given the the question for me is uh what<br>underlies that AI system or whatever it<br>is that we're interacting with and who<br>owns it who um who benefits who owns<br>that data if you're not paying for it<br>then you are the product um and that<br>side of things uh really worries me and<br>also our ability to regulate these sorts<br>of things so our great debate in the<br>school recently was um which is a little<br>bit of a joking debate but it was on the<br>the topic of um is chat GPT my next<br>therapist um and there it was it was<br>surprising to me how convincing the<br>other side we uh Hedwig and I were on<br>the anti-i side um but it was surprising<br>to me that the the valid points that<br>others made we don't have enough<br>psychologists in this country for<br>example to be serving need if we can<br>scale up with something like AI there's<br>a lot of potential for good but there is<br>also a lot of potential for harm and it<br>is extraordinarily hard to regulate uh<br>what these chat Bots are going to tell<br>people um at the moment my senses that<br>they are very good at offering stock<br>standard advice but it's the kind of<br>advice that you could probably find with<br>five minutes of Googling anyway but it<br>gives it to you straight away and it<br>feels very truthy what it doesn't seem<br>to do is<br>really show I mean some there's some out<br>there that do are better at being a bit<br>more relational and but sometimes they<br>just they feel a bit off and they don't<br>really Val uncanny valy type thing yeah<br>they don't give you um and then what<br>they're not<br>doing is that that thing that I was<br>trying to say that psychologists are<br>often there to do to really listen and<br>build a working sense of what is going<br>on and offering tailored guidance based<br>on that most of the time they're<br>offering stock standard advice and one<br>of the risks there there's a lot of them<br>but one of them for me is that people<br>are going to listen they're going to go<br>well this is my therapist um well this<br>is you know this trusted AI bot it's<br>telling me to try this for example<br>exercise which absolutely is one of the<br>most robust things that we can suggest<br>in terms of mental health but for some<br>people they try to exercise and they<br>don't feel anything what does a person<br>do in that case and a lot of the time I<br>think they go well I tried the thing<br>that this fancy AI bot told me and they<br>feel disen heartened and then they<br>almost it lowers their motivation to<br>continue engaging with help um so a lot<br>of potential but a lot of risk as well<br>question thank you for the presentation<br>I comment on<br>wellbeing<br>um there are people that need medication<br>to get chemical balance in their head<br>we know that this Psychiatry with<br>doctors um to learn psychology is to<br>look for happiness and H like the way we<br>think the way we behave the environment<br>that we<br>s um watch movie that bring us some<br>laughter be happy and the socialize<br>people that we enjoy each other<br>company um sometimes I think we can<br>determine our life by<br>the way we live selection of<br>Lifestyle um in life there things that<br>we need any want but sometimes we Face<br>disappointment and that's where religion<br>come in to pray we trust that it God's<br>will the prayer be answered but there's<br>a transition period um the candidate I<br>going to additive habit like um additive<br>eating and sleeping all the are some m h<br>and the Breakthrough can be quite<br>difficult so in my opinion to live a<br>well balanced life to enjoy good<br>wellbeing is not only the person herself<br>or himself but also the environment the<br>external party so that's where God come<br>in Give Love and give support and it's<br>hope in Jesus this is my opinion<br>that we haven't really talked about<br>religion as much so I don't know no yeah<br>yeah I really appreciate the comment um<br>absolutely for a lot of people um some<br>form of Faith process or having the<br>community that religion often brings um<br>is and is a absolute pillar of of<br>well-being for for many many people um<br>it's not for everyone um but I think<br>that speaks to the the point earlier and<br>around people carve out or develop um<br>their well-being um in in different ways<br>um and yeah I I really Echo your point<br>around the role of the environment and<br>others around us and how we construct<br>well-being for ourself whatever that<br>yeah to the<br>body body stuff that you that you<br>mentioned um there's a bunch of<br>people not just injuries illnesses you<br>know but<br>people<br>bre into a bunch of negative um<br>repercussions you know not being<br>validated not having funding or whatever<br>it is so the role of a psychologist is<br>helping people Gras and grow that<br>awareness and channel that awareness<br>into what's going on with their<br>psychological wellbeing physical well<br>what do you think is the RO of the<br>psychologist to get people to increase<br>any ideas<br>um I think the role of the psychologist<br>is again this is coming from my personal<br>um thoughts about what well-being are<br>but I think the role of the psychologist<br>is to outlift all of those facets of um<br>someone's well-being<br>gone um I think people do it in<br>different ways is as well and part of<br>the psychologist client relationship is<br>figuring out what<br>works um for each client because it's<br>never going to be the same because<br>well-being is never the same for any two<br>people<br>um yeah I sorry I don't know if I<br>answered your question but those are my<br>thoughts<br>Chris I'm just trying to figure out um<br>question there's there's a couple of<br>thoughts one is that I think trauma is a<br>space where we're not doing stuff well<br>trauma doesn't fit with the systems of<br>care that we have particularly well and<br>I think that's what your question is<br>highlighting<br>um what do we mean by trauma and uh is<br>is a is a different kind of question but<br>these sorts of experiences that you're<br>talking about where trauma affects the<br>way people experience their body and<br>affects the way that they um look after<br>themselves and impacts on their physical<br>health and these sorts of things um and<br>the way that that is perhaps being<br>mismanaged when they try to access the<br>health system um I think your question<br>highlights a really key floor in that<br>space for me the role one of the major<br>benefits<br>of the of a psych uh one of the major<br>um oh the word is gone no um privileges<br>of being a psychologists is that most of<br>the time we have a lot more time than<br>other health<br>professionals and so when we're talking<br>about something like an experience of<br>trauma that crosses over our ways of<br>speaking about the mind and body and<br>it's presenting in physical ways and<br>it's presenting in psychological ways<br>and it doesn't fit um and it's a bit<br>different for everyone it doesn't fit<br>the ways of speaking that a GP might be<br>ready to receive for example um they<br>simply don't have the time in 15 minutes<br>when they're stressed and they're<br>thinking about how many patients they've<br>got to get through and so on they're<br>under so much pressure whereas a as a<br>psychologist one of the things that I'm<br>most grateful for is having the time to<br>sit and listen hear about a person's<br>experience and then to craft to<br>collaboratively sort of craft ways for<br>them to make sense of that in the<br>context of their history and I think<br>that simple Act of trying of trying to<br>develop a way for them to understand<br>those experiences that seem to differ<br>from those around them for example um is<br>really beneficial because if I can<br>understand it it's less terrifying less<br>scary and maybe then I can take the step<br>towards figuring a way perhaps not to<br>resolve it but a way around it or to to<br>somehow find a way to live my good life<br>um whether or not that's present I I've<br>kind of loosely uh addressed bits of<br>your question I'm not sure if I covered<br>sorry any other thoughts on no um if no<br>one has any other questions I I have one<br>we're maybe time for one more question<br>um so speak now orever hold your piece<br>um I guess I wanted to ask about that MC<br>mindfulness um thing that we talked<br>about in our preparation because before<br>speaking with you folks um that was my<br>primary level of interaction with the<br>idea of well-being and um seeing ads<br>every day for Better Health and and like<br>hundreds of is it better health or<br>better health or you know there there<br>seems to be a proliferation of apps and<br>companies essentially that are trying<br>to uh feed off that insecurity about am<br>I well enough I suppose do you have any<br>is it just it's capitalism itself or is<br>there something more Nuance to be taken<br>from<br>there I mean for me that's the gist of<br>it<br>umus but absolutely I hear your point we<br>we see that with mindfulness um we see<br>that with ADHD assessments um and and<br>the way that the algorithms feed us the<br>these opportunities for validation right<br>um and uh behind that screen many<br>companies making quite a bit of money um<br>and it's not usually Quality Health Care<br>that you're going to be offered um you<br>know mindfulness for example to<br>um is it has huge potential as a um a<br>framework of thinking that has<br>absolutely been stolen and westernized<br>from Eastern philosophical thought and<br>packaged for a western audience we can<br>have some feelings about that and maybe<br>think about that but um the way then<br>that it um is used or sold back or sold<br>to people um yeah is often not very true<br>to the<br>ways the wider Frameworks within which<br>those ideas were developed uh Buddhist<br>ideas for example and often key elements<br>of them are Stripped Away to so that<br>they represent things that kind of look<br>and feel good and make us feel like<br>we're doing something so that they can<br>sell it to us<br>um so I'm quite concerned about that<br>whole Space um it kind of comes back to<br>the to the AI question of who's behind<br>the model but um yeah did anyone else<br>have any thoughts on<br>that yeah I kind of just think it's<br>capitalism as well<br>um and yeah I've just heard horror<br>stories about bitter help in particular<br>um but every other podcast every other<br>YouTube video that have been sponsor<br>sponsored by them and so they're making<br>so much money off<br>of yeah off of people who are not<br>getting quality help um I think there is<br>maybe something to say for the fact that<br>it<br>like has contributed to the<br>destigmatization a little bit um and<br>it's yeah getting some stuff out there<br>to people who and they may not have<br>known about it before<br>but yeah overall I am not a fan um and<br>there are definitely better ways I think<br>the other thing is that there's so many<br>of them now that when you Google<br>something like you're Googling for help<br>all that comes up is all of those things<br>and it's just clogging and preventing<br>people from accessing places that are<br>actually going to help um and so yeah I<br>think that's really dangerous about them<br>as well yeah<br>Matt yeah the the idea of mcmindfulness<br>I think is really apply Nam because if<br>you were I also didn't make that up I<br>yeah if if you were in charge of<br>McDonald's and and someone came up to<br>you and said I don't think everyone<br>wants Burgers I think we just should<br>give Burgers to the people who need<br>Burgers you'd kind of get kicked out<br>like there's like the the idea of<br>packaging these things and is is is the<br>claim that oh our service is going to<br>work for everyone do mindfulness is a<br>thing we should just give everyone and<br>if if it doesn't work for someone it's<br>their fault but actually what you've<br>been talking about so much is well-being<br>is so what well-being means to you and<br>what it means in your environment and<br>given your history that there is never<br>going to be one Cal thing that works for<br>everyone even something like food sleep<br>exercise are things that humans need but<br>they need it in the way that they need<br>it exercise could be a marathon or it<br>could be walking to get coffee right and<br>so telling someone they need to exercise<br>or they need to do mindfulness uh is a<br>way to make money and isn't a way to be<br>responsive um I I do want to pass it<br>back to you Ellie uh we've said not what<br>not to do how do people get help what<br>should people do if they go well I need<br>help probably need to finish on a nice<br>positive note in this really nice<br>booklet on the back there's some um yeah<br>free text free call places there's also<br>um yeah places like TI<br>Mara um py suicide crisis helplines<br>things like that they're all really good<br>jumping points<br>um also reach out to your friends in Foo<br>um they're your friends in Foo for a<br>reason they care about you a lot um<br>particularly if you're someone who<br>everyone will come to you but when<br>you're not feeling great you won't go to<br>any anyone um I may be talking about<br>myself yeah uh reach<br>out it's really hard I know it's really<br>hard but they are there they do care um<br>and they can help you in finding help if<br>you do need it um for those of you that<br>are students at Vic uh mod order has the<br>student<br>counseling uh some of them are really<br>amazing the ones that I've been to have<br>been really great I can't vouch for them<br>all but the ones that I've have been<br>awesome so and it's free which is really<br>cool um yeah Chris do you have anything<br>to<br>add no but you've just flagged all these<br>positive things and I'm still thinking I<br>just wanted to jump<br>in on<br>bit I know yeah very very very briefly<br>uh bit help to add on to that dog pile<br>they got done recently for selling uh<br>the information that they had collected<br>um to advertisers um so they collected<br>information from vulnerable people and<br>then sold that to advertisers so yeah<br>you might see them online but I wouldn't<br>trust them to be honest that's my<br>personal opinion now POS and now<br>anything okay watch cat<br>videos they are that is so cute how can<br>you be angry and watch a cat video or a<br>puppy video if you're not a cat person I<br>understand but I'm a cat person um or<br>just cute animals honestly the easiest<br>and quickest way to bring your mood back<br>up<br>yeah uh please before we uh end off with<br>a car here and then we have plenty of<br>Kai food outside to stay on and um share<br>the moment and have more of Kuro<br>together uh but please um thank uh join<br>me in thanking the panel and Georgia for<br>this amazing discussion those was so<br>thoughtful and and and very funny as</p></main><footer style="margin-top: 2rem; background: #0001; padding: 2rem; text-align: center;"><p>We Are The
