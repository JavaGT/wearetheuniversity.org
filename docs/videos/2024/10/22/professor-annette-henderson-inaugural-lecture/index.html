She completed her PhD in Developmental Psychology at Queen’s University (2007) and a post-doc at the University of Maryland. Her early research focused on children’s word learning and cooperation.<br><br>Annette has explored how biological and experiential factors influence cooperation and prosocial behaviours in early childhood. Annette’s work also focuses on identifying the factors that support or hinder responsiveness and coordination in parent-child interactions.<br><br>With a toolkit of diverse methods, developmental psychology has revealed that the answers to these questions lie in infancy and early childhood. In this talk, Annette shares her journey as a developmental scientist, exploring what infants and young children understand about the shared nature of human behaviour and how this understanding shapes their ability to communicate and coordinate with others. She discusses the crucial role of social interactions in this development and reveals how a digital baby might help us unlock the mystery of how infant behaviour fosters responsive and coordinated social interactions. While many questions remain unclear, what is evident is that although infants are just starting their own journey into human society, they are prepared to be part of the team from the start.</p><h2>Transcript</h2><p style="opacity: 0.9; font-size: 0.8em">Transcripts may be automatically generated and may not be 100% accurate.</p><p>Coto uh welcome to this evening's<br>lecture by Professor Annette Henderson<br>my<br>name my name is Nikki Harry I am head of<br>the School of Psychology here at WP upo<br>the University of Oakland and it is my<br>pleasure to um introduce Annette to you<br>tonight so aned as I'm sure many of you<br>most of you know is originally from<br>Calgary Alberta Canada and earned her ma<br>and MSC from the University of Calgary<br>she completed a PhD in developmental<br>psychology at Queens University in 2007<br>and went on to a postto at the<br>University of Maryland her early<br>research focused on children's word<br>learning and<br>cooperation she was appointed here at<br>WIP upo in<br>2009 soon after arrival she founded the<br>Early Learning lab affectionately known<br>as<br>Ella as one colleague I approached in<br>preparation for this introduction said<br>Annette set up from scratch an extremely<br>impressive research program her research<br>lab was very labor intensive and<br>required extensive networking in order<br>to build up a participant pool another<br>colleague commented that Anette had the<br>courage to develop truly Innovative<br>projects that integrate areas advanc<br>methods and have the potential to shift<br>the way core developmental processes are<br>understood this early investment of time<br>and resources clearly paid off as a<br>nette has a series of very impressive<br>accomplishments her recent work has<br>explored the factors that influence<br>cooperation and pro-social behaviors in<br>early childhood and part of that has<br>involved collaborative work<br>investigating responsiveness and<br>coordination in parent child<br>interactions she's published over 50<br>articles including in the top journals<br>in her field such as child development<br>developmental psychology and cognition<br>she secured major grants including mden<br>and a Rutherford fellowship with<br>intriguing titles such as completing the<br>loop with baby x and I know we're going<br>to see baby x later on tonight and my<br>favorite born and raised to<br>cooperate I especially like that because<br>it sounds like the collective version of<br>Bruce Springsteen's Born in the<br>USA the L lab has been a training ground<br>for large groups of undergraduate<br>students as well as supported numerous<br>post-doctoral research students and<br>postdocs an it has supervised 66<br>research students to completion as one<br>colleague commented this involved a<br>tremendous amount of time and energy<br>andette has shared her hard work and<br>resulting infrastructure in the Ella lab<br>with other academics Annette is now the<br>director of our brand new school Center<br>for developmental science she has<br>numerous collaborations inside and<br>outside New Zealand and has served as<br>president of the austral Asian Human<br>Development<br>Association and it has also made<br>substantial contributions to teaching at<br>all levels with extraordinary student<br>evaluations I won't give you the numbers<br>um in 2011 she received a Dean's award<br>for teaching Excellence an Anette has<br>also been as all of us know a wonderful<br>School citizen um and was chair of our<br>Equity committee last year I want to<br>finish with a quote from um a newer<br>colleague Annette um who I asked to sort<br>of contribute some ideas for this<br>and I think this really sums it up<br>Annette is one of the most supportive<br>colleagues that I've been fortunate<br>enough to work with she went above and<br>beyond and helping me to learn the ropes<br>when I started my job she provided<br>Guidance with regard to teaching service<br>and research helping me navigate<br>daunting new processes and it does so<br>much to make our school a better place<br>and I feel lucky to have had her as a<br>colleague collaborator and friend<br>you<br>okay thank you<br>tenoa no Canada oku Mata no Canada<br>a a<br>Calgary a<br>Calgary k<br>tamako a NOOA Co Anette Henderson TOA<br>ten ten<br>Tena so greetings everybody thank you<br>Nikki for that lovely introduction is a<br>little bit embarrassing but it's lovely<br>so thank you very much um it's fantastic<br>to be here and um share this talk with<br>you before I get off any further I<br>heang heang he tangata so this faki<br>which speaks to the importance of<br>relationships and connections um was<br>actually born out of Devastation<br>somebody had to lose their whole entire<br>family to recognize that those things<br>that we strive for in our daily lives<br>like titles and material wealth actually<br>pale in comparison compared to the<br>relationships that we have with<br>everybody around us and it actually just<br>takes me looking around this room today<br>and knowing who's here to support me in<br>this today to recognize how much that is<br>true so thank you everybody for being<br>here tonight I know some of you work<br>here and and it's kind of expected for<br>you to be here but I really appreciate<br>it um but I also know there's many of<br>you who came from a far distance to be<br>here hibiscus Coast woohoo um and<br>Australia thank you Kelsey and my<br>fantastic wonderful sisters who came<br>here from North America to support me in<br>this<br>thank you um I also know that there are<br>people who are online who are unable to<br>be here today so my dad and his wife<br>darene thank you for watching and tuning<br>in and also I think a lot of my family<br>from overseas will be tuning in so<br>that's fantastic and maybe some people<br>who just saw this online and randomly<br>wanted to watch so nice to meet you um<br>and also I want to acknowledge people<br>who have passed in our lives and<br>primarily my mom who passed away 13<br>years ago after a really hard Valiant<br>effort battling cancer so I know she'd<br>be here if she could but my sisters are<br>here for her so thank you very much okay<br>and yanek and<br>Jackson my wonderful family you guys<br>will star in the show later so I promise<br>I haven't forgotten you so thank you<br>very much so preparing for the inaugural<br>has been very very strange because it's<br>not a lecture I'm not teaching you all<br>something you all know an awful lot I'm<br>also not giving a a research talk where<br>I have to go into a lot of details and<br>the inaugurals that I've been to that<br>have been part particularly special to<br>me have been ones that have had a little<br>bit of a personal flavor so hopefully I<br>struck the balance a little bit right um<br>I have a hard time not focusing on<br>details of methods so I've tried to pair<br>that back a little bit um but also I'm<br>hoping to share a little bit about me<br>and who I am and I'm hoping that each of<br>you will walk away from here tonight<br>knowing a little bit more about the<br>person who I am and the journey that got<br>me here today so to ease into the topic<br>I'd like to do a little thought exercise<br>with you so thinking about the last<br>couple of days I'd like you to think to<br>you um had a conversation with someone<br>who you didn't know very well but were<br>able to effectively communicate your<br>innermost thoughts have you worked<br>together with somebody maybe towards a<br>shared goal solved a problem that you<br>wouldn't have been able to solve on your<br>own have you helped someone in need or<br>have you comforted someone has someone<br>helped you or comforted you so I know<br>many of you in this room but not all of<br>you incredibly well but I can almost<br>guarantee that every one of you said yes<br>to most if not those answers those<br>questions now I know this not because<br>I'm in Psychology so can clearly read<br>everybody's<br>Minds I know this because of Decades of<br>research on human beings demonstrate<br>that humans are an inherently social<br>species our everyday lives are comprised<br>of behavior with other people if not for<br>other people people this connection with<br>others is key not only to surviving in<br>our societies but also thriving which is<br>demonstrated by the fact that giving and<br>connection to core other oriented<br>behaviors are fundamental to the health<br>and well-being models in aloa as well as<br>globally now the fundamental role that<br>these behaviors play in our everyday<br>lives is further underscored by the fact<br>that the development of these capacities<br>emerges within the first few years of<br>life so this evening I am thrilled to be<br>able to share some of the research that<br>I've completed as part of my career with<br>my res developmental team so far and so<br>when I've selected the research to talk<br>about what I've also tried to do is<br>Select different kinds of methods that<br>we use as developmental researchers<br>because I want you to learn something<br>but also that's one of the reasons why I<br>love what I do we have these questions<br>that we want to answer we have these<br>things that don't talk right babies<br>don't talk very well um and we have to<br>examine what they think and what they<br>know so I'm looking forward to sharing<br>those methods with you as well but again<br>in not as much detail as I might in a<br>big research talk but I hope you can see<br>the passion in my work and maybe you can<br>get some passion as well for<br>developmental science work now before I<br>go too much further I'd like you to<br>learn a little bit more about who I am<br>so who I am who am I well I'm a<br>academic and within that space I'm a<br>developmental scientist and director of<br>the air learning lab now of course these<br>identities are why we're technically<br>here today right but again looking<br>around this room this is actually not<br>why we're here today we're here for<br>because of these other identities that<br>form a foundational role in who I am and<br>my journey so far I'm a teacher I'm a<br>mentor a colleague a partner a mother a<br>friend an auntie a sister a daughter and<br>maybe a lot more but that's about it for<br>now and all these identities are who I<br>am and have played a FAL role in my<br>journey today so I guess the first<br>question is how did this person come to<br>be here today and what is it that I<br>actually do because I know some of you<br>still don't know the answer to that<br>question and wonder why I'm so busy when<br>students aren't in semester and I'm<br>technically supposed to be on research<br>and study leave maybe we'll be able to<br>figure that out today so we'll start a<br>little bit at the beginning so my last<br>name is Henderson that's on my dad's<br>side of the family my mom's um made a<br>name is stretch so that's Scottish<br>backgrounds but my family came from<br>Scotland to Canada a very long time ago<br>so long ago that when we would ask our<br>grandparents where we're from they'd be<br>just well just over the hill over there<br>so so really I'm Canadian um as my kind<br>of background so here's a picture of my<br>dad with his parents and his sister my<br>dad was raised um in Quebec and my mom's<br>family is from Nova Scotia the Atlantic<br>part of Canada this is my mom with her<br>parents had a Christmas dinner my mom is<br>from a family of farmers and so I had a<br>very large family and they all can't fit<br>on one slide so um that's a little bit<br>of the family from there so my parents<br>grew up in their respective provinces<br>and went to post-secondary education my<br>dad was the first Henderson to go to<br>postsecondary education where he<br>graduated with his mechanical<br>engineering degree from the University<br>of New Brunswick and my mom got her<br>training in SEC secretarial school at<br>frederickton business college my parents<br>met after they graduated from school<br>dated for a bit and then moved to<br>Calgary to start a family so I came into<br>the picture a few years later anyone<br>know what year I came in it's on the<br>slide but the music at the start maybe<br>was a bit of a clue<br>1977 perfect year the Year Elvis died<br>which is a little bit sad but<br>nonetheless great year for<br>music so here I am with my family you<br>might have heard me you heard me right I<br>was born on Christmas Eve fantastic time<br>to be born my sisters just loved me<br>right from the start the best Christmas<br>present they could have had but they're<br>here so maybe they got over it hopefully<br>but growing up in this household wasn't<br>easy my two sisters excelled at pretty<br>much everything that they did so it was<br>really hard to live up to them they even<br>got to wear matching outfits all of the<br>time and I never got to wear their<br>clothes my eldest sister Naina is 9<br>years older than me and my middle sister<br>di is five years older than me so for a<br>longest time I was a little bit of an<br>alien to them but again I think we're<br>moving past that now um this was our<br>family dog Sunshine great name for a dog<br>of mine and um a big part of my life and<br>I had to put this picture of here was um<br>my role in a performing art scholarship<br>program so we had to audition and we<br>received free performing arts training<br>this will come in very important a<br>little bit later in my story and this<br>picture here is di walking me to school<br>for the first day I was super excited so<br>excited that I never left school right<br>so you know that's you did a good job<br>walking me there um so this is the first<br>foundations of my life the second<br>foundations wasn't all Glitters and<br>sparkles as much so when I was 12 years<br>old my mom decided to leave the family<br>because she wanted to explore her own<br>career that was a challenging time for<br>all of us my sisters were away at<br>University so coping with that in their<br>own time and dad was stuck with an<br>adolescent pre-adolescent girl but we<br>made it through dad encouraged me to<br>stay focused on school because that's<br>what he believed was the most important<br>thing and we stuck by each other and I<br>made it through adolescence that's my<br>graduation from high school at that time<br>di had already had moved back home to<br>help support the<br>family I'm sharing this not because I<br>like bringing up the past and I actually<br>don't really like talking about this<br>stuff at all but thinking about our<br>history is really really important<br>particularly for a developmental<br>scientist because these early<br>experiences taught me at least three key<br>things that have played a role in my<br>successes to date the first first off<br>the importance of friendships and<br>relationships this couple here are um<br>were my dad and mom's best friends my<br>angel and Uncle Dawn we call them and<br>they provided incredible stability<br>during a difficult time they had me and<br>my dad over for dinner every week during<br>those challenging times and when the<br>time was right they introduced my dad to<br>his partner darene now wife who has kept<br>my dad happy for 30 years and she's been<br>a source of support for our<br>family the second one is perseverance<br>everybody in my family Works incredibly<br>hard to achieve those goals working<br>through some challenging times and that<br>perseverance is so important in Academia<br>we get rejected all of the time we have<br>so many struggles but these kinds of<br>things you have to Trek on you have to<br>just say you know what it's worth it<br>we'll just keep fighting and going on<br>third one citizenship so my family is<br>incredibly kind and caring and does an<br>awful lot for other people I guess Nikki<br>you even highlighted that in my<br>introduction my dad was a is a superstar<br>in that he does so many things for other<br>people often at a cost for himself now I<br>know the saying is nice people finish<br>last I truly disagree with that<br>statement I'd rather be kind and caring<br>and take a little bit longer to where I<br>got to than if I would have had it the<br>other way so putting these things these<br>three things together hopefully tells<br>you a little bit more about who I am and<br>kind of where I got to I give this<br>picture here because this was a reminder<br>of the talking point because this is me<br>getting an award from that young<br>Canadians group that I was a part of and<br>the award was voted on by my peers and<br>it wasn't the best performer or the best<br>dancer it was a person who tried really<br>hard worked hard and was kind to<br>everybody along the way so that is just<br>an important part to me I'm going to<br>glass okay so the other cool thing I<br>like about in is figuring<br>out why people chose the field and what<br>they were doing so did I always want to<br>be a professor so there's little Annette<br>here and if you ask me when I was<br>younger what I wanted to be when I grew<br>up um there would be a few different<br>kinds of answers but one would be a<br>teacher that makes sense I kind of do<br>that now but the other one which emerged<br>around adolescence maybe because of the<br>tricky challenging time was a<br>psychologist but it wasn't just any<br>psychologist I actually wanted to be a<br>psychologist on a soap<br>opera I wanted to be Dr Marina<br>Evans because to me it was perfect you<br>could do psychology during the day and<br>help all those wonderful people and then<br>you could wear ball gowns you could die<br>a few times and try out your different<br>decision-making processes so for me that<br>was perfect so when I would talk about<br>this career plan with my dad he always<br>had the best answer he would say yeah<br>okay sure Anette why don't you finish<br>University first and see where you go<br>from there it was perfect parents right<br>he never said no he said sure just get<br>your degree first so I'm clearly not a<br>psychologist on a soap opera so what<br>happened well the secret is I fell in<br>love with research and I didn't fall in<br>love with just any research I fell in<br>love with developmental science research<br>and that love was ignited during my<br>undergraduate degree at the University<br>of Calgary um and it was ignited during<br>my fourth year which is the honors year<br>at the University of Calgary and I'd<br>like to say that it was my honors thesis<br>that ignited that that passion but it<br>wasn't necessarily the honors thesis it<br>was a course that I took from a<br>professor Dr Suzanne Hala and this<br>course was on early cognitive<br>development in children and part of the<br>course was learning about developmental<br>science and research and how researchers<br>designed these different kinds of tasks<br>to tap into what children think about<br>the world it was just amazing to think<br>and hear about all this research I did<br>pretty well in the paper and at the end<br>of the course Suzanne asked me if I<br>would be her lab manager I thought well<br>I was taking a year off anyways this is<br>maybe better for my career than teaching<br>dancing which is what I was also doing<br>um so I said yes it was a fantastic<br>decision I learned how to set up a lab<br>we recruited participants right right<br>from the start spent weekends at the<br>mall talking to families but I got to<br>also go and participate in completing<br>the research so we were doing all these<br>tasks with children um across different<br>ages and diversity backgrounds and I<br>would always just sit there and think<br>why is this child doing this what are<br>they thinking and so I really did enjoy<br>that and of course it was no brainer<br>then for me to apply to do my masters<br>with Suzanne so I applied to do my<br>masters with Suzanne and got accepted so<br>that was great unfortunately partway<br>through my masters Suzanne became unwell<br>and was en able to continue in um as my<br>supervisor and in the field for a little<br>while she Tak had to take a step back<br>fortunately Dr Susan Graham stepped in<br>Susan Graham is a clinical psychologist<br>who also is a basic researcher so I was<br>like oh I can go back to wanting to<br>become Dr Bara Evans maybe because I can<br>learn about Clinical Psychology and<br>still do research well Suzanne Susan<br>taught me about word learning research<br>which you'll hear about in a little bit<br>so I completed my masters with Susan and<br>then it was time to apply for a PhD so I<br>got a accepted into the clinical program<br>at the University of Calgary and then<br>got accepted at the at Queens University<br>to do my general psychology degree with<br>Mark Saba now Mark Saba was gain he was<br>pretty much brand new doing some really<br>cool work and I was like I would really<br>like to work with him but he did not<br>take clinical students so I had to make<br>a decision and it was a really really<br>tough choice so I om and a because you<br>know I still want to be Dr Marina Evans<br>uh so I reached out to an academic at<br>the University of Calgary who who I<br>deeply respected Dr Penny pexman who is<br>a cognitive scientist so we can start to<br>see where this is going to go so I was<br>talking with Penny and she's like well<br>what have you liked about doing your<br>Masters and I said oh my goodness I've<br>just loved the research and Yeta I've<br>already told you all this um and she<br>said okay well why do you want to do<br>Clinical Psychology I want to help<br>people and she's like okay okay okay<br>sure that that's very Noble that's great<br>but what makes you think that you cannot<br>help people when you do a PhD and you're<br>an academic I just sat there and I kind<br>of stared at her and she's like what am<br>I doing right now and I'm like helping<br>me and she's like sat back he was like<br>mhm and then I like left and then I<br>thought about it for a while and<br>realized yeah I'm going to go to Queens<br>and I'm going to do my PhD and start my<br>career as a developmental scientist and<br>I haven't looked back since so there's<br>my story about how I got to where I got<br>to so what is developmental psychology<br>there's a lot of Psych people in here so<br>I can go kind of quickly through here<br>but developmental psychology is a<br>subdiscipline of psychology and our<br>focus is to look at stability and change<br>across the lifespan so we want to see<br>how people grow how they change across<br>the life and we have five main goals<br>here identify describe explain predict<br>and enhance so if you pick a certain<br>capacity you can plop it into X here and<br>identify the goals of psychology so what<br>do babies know about theory of mind how<br>does theory of Mind stay the same across<br>development what influenced the<br>development of it how does that impact<br>other aspects of development and how can<br>we enhance development or if this is<br>something that we necessarily don't want<br>to enhance and it's something that might<br>be harmful we might want to minimize so<br>developmental psychologists actually we<br>can't call ourselves developmental<br>psychologists particularly New Zealand<br>because that's a term for registered<br>psychologist which I'm not remember I'm<br>not Dr marinaa Evans um we are<br>development scientist or developmental<br>psychology researchers so developmental<br>scientist I<br>am I've been fortunate enough to be able<br>to dabble in each of these goals<br>throughout my career and so today I'm<br>going to talk to you about two of those<br>key main areas which is words and<br>communication and cooperation and then<br>go back to some social interaction work<br>at the end so you're going to see these<br>icons here as a bit of a snippet as to<br>when I've kind of addressed these<br>different kinds of goals in my research<br>hopefully doesn't get confusing and it's<br>helpful for you let me know afterwards<br>what you think okay so words I'm really<br>interested in words because of the<br>conventional nature of words and what<br>does that mean well the Power of Words<br>as effective communicative tools is<br>because of conventionality their<br>meanings are shared by other language<br>users particularly other people within<br>the a person's language community so<br>because of conventionality we can when<br>once we identify someone hopefully<br>speaks our Lang speaks our language we<br>can be fairly confident we can use our<br>words to communicate with them it's why<br>we can communicate with people we don't<br>know almost as easily as we can people<br>who we know quite well and as adults we<br>kind of take this fundamental fact about<br>language for granted we we adjust our<br>language quite easily right when we go<br>teach to students we try to use words<br>that the students might understand more<br>clearly but sometimes as as adults<br>conventional mishaps happened as I<br>experienced when I moved from Canada to<br>New Zealand now one would have thought<br>communication would have been okay<br>Canada mostly English-speaking New<br>Zealand largely English-speaking but<br>still some things happened I spent much<br>of my first year or so here wondering<br>why students kept asking me for<br>rubbers and why my friends were telling<br>me they were tramping all of the time<br>you don't tell your friends and<br>colleagues that in park particular so<br>yeah there's a few confusions and these<br>kinds of examples are hilarious and<br>maybe you might notice them more but for<br>me that is those are funny stories but<br>I'm interested in conventionality<br>because I want to know what children<br>understand about conventionality we know<br>kids learn words at an incredibly rapid<br>rate infants as young as 14 months of<br>age can learn a new word with one<br>exposure if this if the conditions are<br>right what I was curious about is what<br>infants understood about those words<br>that they're learning do do they<br>understand any of these kind of<br>fundamental facts about language so to<br>highlight why this might be important<br>let's imagine this little baby here and<br>it's they're playing with this object<br>and I and the caregiver says something<br>like oh you have a ball in any typical<br>situation the child would learn that<br>that object is called a ball so later on<br>when I later ask for a ball the child<br>will give me the ball that's great<br>that's word learning but an<br>understanding of convention would allow<br>the child to go one step further they<br>wouldn't have to be able to taught be<br>taught what other people think that<br>object is they can just generalize the<br>word ball to everyone else in their<br>language world and this is some of the<br>these are some of the research questions<br>that I looked at in the early kind of<br>parts of my career so through this<br>research using paradigms appropriately<br>for the age range I demonstrated that<br>infants as young as nine months of age<br>would not only learn new words in a<br>quick context like that they would<br>generalize the word to other language<br>users and they didn't just generalize<br>any information we taught them it was<br>only words that they would generalize<br>when I moved to New Zealand we continued<br>on with this work and we looked at the<br>extent to which infants expected words<br>to be shared but within linguistic<br>communities so infants were taught a<br>word by an English user for example and<br>we wanted to see if babies would<br>generalize to an English user but maybe<br>not a French user and by 12 months of<br>age they demonstrate that pattern<br>suggesting that baby<br>understand quite a bit about the<br>conventional nature of language early on<br>in their lives so when I moved to do my<br>PhD I wanted to continue to examine<br>conventionality because I thought that<br>conventionality is not just something<br>cool a fact about language but a it<br>might actually be useful for language<br>learning so to provide an example of how<br>it might be useful for language learning<br>imagine a situation like this a child<br>and their caregiver are walking down the<br>street and they see a photo of this<br>animal here the child might say<br>something like what's this and the<br>caregiver could say oh that's a squirrel<br>or that's special to where we live it's<br>a squirrel these are typical of what<br>caregivers might say in a labeling<br>context and in these cases the child<br>would learn that that object is indeed a<br>squirrel now consider if the caregiver<br>said something like this huh I don't<br>know maybe it's a squirrel or oo that's<br>special to a far away country we don't<br>have them where we live it's a squirrel<br>the question here is would children<br>learn in this case if children are using<br>conventionality to learn language they<br>should actually avoid learning the label<br>in this case because the caregiver is<br>providing a signal that that word might<br>not be shared by the linguistic<br>community in the first case the person<br>is claiming ignorance right they're<br>saying I don't know maybe it's a<br>squirrel we tend not to like learning<br>incorrect things right in the second<br>case the caregiver is providing a signal<br>of relevance the caregiver is<br>essentially saying you're not going to<br>see this thing again why bother learning<br>what it's called okay so children should<br>maybe if conventionality is driving word<br>learning they shouldn't learn in those<br>cases now when I was studying my PhD<br>lots of people were doing research in<br>that first row they were looking at<br>knowledge and ignorance and<br>demonstrating that infants even as young<br>as 24 months of age would avoid learning<br>in the cases when somebody has claimed<br>ignorance or uncertainty when providing<br>a label now that might be just because<br>people don't like learning incorrect<br>things which I already alluded to I<br>wanted to test conventionality further<br>so I wanted to see if they paid<br>attention to relevance because in<br>relevance cases the label is correct<br>right it's correct somewhere just not<br>maybe to New Zealand we don't have<br>squirrels here so I designed a study um<br>in which we manipulated this with<br>children so what you do in these kinds<br>of studies is you show children new toys<br>they've never seen before and don't have<br>a name for and then you tell them about<br>the object so in this study we told them<br>either these toys are from a store<br>nearby or special from kids who live<br>around here or these toys are for from a<br>store really far away and special to<br>kids who live over there so that not<br>relevant case we then teach them a label<br>for the object so somebody would come in<br>and provide a name for one of those<br>objects and then we put the pictures up<br>on the screen and we see if the child<br>will point to the object when we say<br>show me the usma for example all right<br>so when we did this study with children<br>this was for children four years of age<br>at this point in time we found that<br>children did not show learning in the in<br>the irrelevant condition so just telling<br>kids that the objects are from a<br>different far away Place hindered their<br>word learning this was really cool so<br>cool that when I told my supervisor he's<br>like oh my goodness I thought that was<br>not going to come out he's like you know<br>what you need to do replicate so we<br>replicated in that lab and then I even<br>had to replicate again in another lab so<br>after three studies we demonstrate that<br>indeed relevant information drives<br>children's word learning the next<br>question is is this information even<br>important to their everyday lives do<br>parents talk about conventionality so we<br>had parents and children come into the<br>lab and play with different kinds of<br>objects the relevant the most important<br>comparison here is the Box in yellow<br>which are objects that neither the<br>parent nor the children knew the names<br>of and in one case Cas they're<br>manufactured objects so clearly had a<br>name and the other one they were toys<br>that I made because everyone in<br>developmental psychology also does<br>crafts um and we wanted to see if<br>parents talked about them differently<br>and this is just an example of<br>transcripts from that study parents<br>definitely highlight their uncertainty<br>and ignorance they're like this is<br>really strange essentially saying you're<br>never going to see this thing before um<br>and also gave that information to<br>children so together these studies<br>demonstrate that infants are ready to<br>Comm communicate early in their lives<br>they expect word meanings to be shared<br>across people preschool preschoolers<br>seem to use conventionality to drive<br>their word learning and interactions<br>with parents carry information relevant<br>to conventionality so that work was<br>largely part of my PhD work and it was<br>awesome I really enjoyed doing it it was<br>super excellent research obviously cool<br>so happy to graduate and receive my PhD<br>from Queens so good decision to go to<br>Queens so it turns out the decision to<br>go to Queens was even better for another<br>reason it was there when I met a certain<br>handsome clever fiber optical engineer<br>who was also doing their his PhD um<br>along the way and so that of course is<br>yanic who is now my partner uh well has<br>been for a while uh<br>awkward and has been fantastic and an<br>important sour of support along the way<br>you can't even use words in these kind<br>of situations to communicate this but<br>also during that time um the lab group<br>so so my lab up there the people around<br>you they're the people who are going to<br>also be that amazing support and sense<br>of stress relief when you're having that<br>hard time through your PhD because it's<br>not all jazz hands all the time and I<br>had a running group where we did a lot<br>of running for stress relief so we could<br>also eat a lot um during the graduate<br>school and it kept me sane as well so<br>the PHD time was truly a special time<br>but it comes to an end and then you're<br>left thinking what am I going to do next<br>because you worked so hard for so long<br>for this piece of paper and now it's<br>like okay I would like a job but you<br>still can't get a job so now what so I<br>was thinking what do I want to look at<br>well as a developmental scientist I've<br>been studying older children older<br>children says the infant researcher um<br>and I really wanted to understand<br>younger children so I was like I need to<br>know how we study infants and I also<br>started to thinking about well I've been<br>looking at words what other kinds of<br>behaviors are shared across people and<br>then I thought well cooperation we<br>cooperate with other people all the time<br>and those activities are ones in which<br>we're working together and coordinating<br>our actions towards a shared goal so<br>what I did is I put in a grant proposal<br>for a postto fellowship in which I went<br>to go wanted to go work with Amanda<br>Woodward who is very well established in<br>terms of her work and INF cognition and<br>to look at the development of infants<br>understanding of the shared nature of<br>cooperation fortunately that application<br>went through and I was able to go work<br>with Amanda so we had to develop a new<br>paradigm because nobody had looked at<br>infant's understanding of cooperation<br>now if you're an infant researcher you<br>understand this but if you if you<br>haven't done a lot of research with<br>infants infants can't talk to you they<br>don't point to objects when you ask them<br>to point to objects incredibly reliably<br>so as a developmental scientist research<br>we use infants eye gaze to tell us what<br>we're they're thinking about the world<br>so we developed this cooperation visual<br>habituation Paradigm so so what this<br>means is we showed babies this video<br>action sequence of two people working<br>together to get a toy out of a container<br>we showed them this event over and over<br>and over again until they essentially<br>get bored so they're really attentive at<br>the beginning and then their attention<br>starts declining when their attention<br>declines enough that suggests that<br>they've figured out something about that<br>event okay all right so what we wanted<br>to know is what they were thinking about<br>the event as adults looking at this we<br>would say well the woman in the blue<br>shirt the Box opener is holding the Box<br>open for her friend who got the toy out<br>so that they could get the toy block<br>that is a cooperation event but that's<br>that event could also be interpreted in<br>another way it could be that the blue<br>shirt girl wanted the box and opened the<br>box and the other girl wanted the toy so<br>how we test what babies think about this<br>event is we show them two different test<br>events that are closely matched they're<br>closely matched in that they have the<br>same two objects they've seen before and<br>the only difference is in one test case<br>they reach towards the box and the other<br>one they reach towards the toy now this<br>is the person who'd been reaching<br>towards the Box the whole entire time we<br>wanted to see if babies think that she<br>should keep reaching towards the box or<br>if she should go to the toy which if<br>they think about it as cooperation<br>that's what they should think about<br>right she wanted the toy along it's<br>there she should go get it so babies<br>should find it unexpected and in<br>developmental science this means they<br>look longer when she reaches towards the<br>Box okay okay good now the joys of these<br>paradigms is not just one condition so<br>I'm going to show you a graph with just<br>the cooperation condition and the two<br>test trials we have many control<br>conditions that I don't have time to<br>talk about if you ever want to chat<br>about them over coffee read the paper<br>first because I don't want to have an<br>argument with you um and then we can<br>talk about it but what you can see here<br>is we did this with three different age<br>groups and the only age group where<br>there's a reliable difference between<br>those two bars is at 14 months of age 14<br>months of old look longer when she<br>reached towards the box which means that<br>they were like huh why is she going<br>towards the box cuz the toys over there<br>and so they interpreted that cooperation<br>event as a cooperation towards a shared<br>goal good okay that's enough methods for<br>now we followed up with that with that<br>attention visual prediction Paradigm so<br>instead of looking at infants overall<br>looking time we then look to see where<br>they think she should reach so in these<br>test events what she does is she starts<br>moving and then the question is is where<br>will babies look and they like what<br>adults would do we would look to where<br>we think the person should be reaching<br>so we see if babies look towards the toy<br>block and in this Paradigm when you<br>compare it with a non-cooperation case<br>again baby expected her to reach towards<br>that toy suggesting that babies have at<br>least a basic appreciation of the shared<br>ghoul nature of cooperation they can<br>they can hang those actions of two<br>different people together as working<br>towards the same thing so that took up a<br>lot of the time during my postto because<br>baby work is really hard but of course<br>during that time I also had a fantastic<br>time with my labmates and yes I got<br>Amanda Woodward to do jazz hands that's<br>fantastic that's her oops oh that's not<br>her anyway she's up there now now that<br>time was fantastic I was doing some<br>really cool research it also fantastic<br>because I was living in Maryland and<br>Maryland was only a few hours away from<br>my big eldest sister naen who I hadn't<br>spent a lot of time with up until that<br>point so I got to drive over to visit<br>her and her family for quite a few times<br>during that time so it was really<br>special to get to know you as an adult<br>and maybe you're still not mad at me<br>from being born at Christmas because of<br>that um so it was a fantastic time but<br>it was also sad because it was me and my<br>cat shinook and the rest of my heart was<br>still in Canada so my our other cat Pico<br>and yanx was working in Canada we got<br>married during the time which was<br>fantastic but after two years of the<br>postto that living apart needed to end<br>so the job market so applied to lots of<br>different kinds of jobs and one of the<br>offers that came in was to move to W<br>Papo um university of Auckland so it was<br>a tough decision because it's really far<br>from many other places that I was<br>familiar with but the head of school at<br>the time um Professor ameritus Fred<br>Seymour gave drove a really hard bargain<br>I would be sitting there and I'd ask him<br>questions about New Zealand and he would<br>write back with emails like this I'm<br>just about to go on the ferry for a boat<br>ride and go on an ocean swim<br>meanwhile I'm in the middle of a North<br>American winter so New Zealand was<br>looking pretty good um so yeah and I<br>came to visit yanic also got an a job<br>offer in Auckland so it all looked<br>pretty good so we packed up our life<br>went across the ocean and started our<br>life in New Zealand here to work in the<br>department of psychology then School of<br>Psychology now so we had to build a new<br>home and building a new home is<br>fantastic but trying to do it as an<br>early career academic is pretty intense<br>right we have all of our new teaching<br>that's tricky all these new service R<br>and acronyms man New Zealand you guys<br>love these acronyms right um but also I<br>had to develop a new lab I didn't have<br>anywhere where I could do all this<br>amazing research that I was supposedly<br>hired to do so there's um I've dug out<br>this recently and was showing my lab of<br>me drawing my lab my dad would be so<br>proud of my engineering skills um and<br>work to develop the lab during this time<br>I had many many endless hours with<br>Margaret I know you're here Margaret<br>thank you for all of your effort<br>especially earlier on in those years and<br>Peter Johnson and also my handy dandy<br>live-in engineer husband who um we spent<br>many weekends in the lab setting up<br>things and plugging in things to make<br>sure it still work so we got the lab<br>going but also during that time we were<br>meeting incredible new friends I started<br>here at a time where I don't know the<br>vibe in the school was fantastic the<br>colleagues that had been here for a long<br>time were fantastic inviting us for lots<br>of dinners sharing with us about New<br>Zealand<br>I also arrived at a time where more<br>Junior people had already started so I<br>had built in friends immediately um<br>everyone on my floor Nicole I don't know<br>why your name isn't on this sign in as<br>one of the offices but nonetheless nicoa<br>was on the floor I was beside Quinton<br>and Chris and I'd run run run run and<br>talk to them and run run run and talk to<br>everybody it was fantastic I knew we had<br>made the right decision from that time<br>it was good when Yanik and I had happy<br>hours with more than just the two of us<br>because it was an N of two for many of<br>the first happy hours but we got there<br>nine months later I had a baby no I'm<br>just kidding I the lab started um the L<br>lab ran their first session about nine<br>months after we started construction<br>which was fantastic I had my first<br>students my first research volunteers it<br>was just a really incredible moment so<br>part of doing developmental research is<br>you kind of need to replicate these<br>things that you did before so our first<br>step was to replicate those early<br>studies that I did in my postdoc so we<br>ran that conventionality l language<br>study which was fantastic and worked out<br>we also engage in a lot of communication<br>with the public we need to tell people<br>what we're doing so that the public is<br>excited about our research and comes<br>back and participates so we do some<br>newsletters to share with the with um<br>the the the people Ella update so my<br>team does a lot of these newsletters and<br>spends a lot of time on them so thank<br>you the lab seem to multiply so the next<br>year it doubled and the following year<br>it didn't quite double but we were<br>getting lots of people and it was<br>intense um but we were doing lots of<br>cool work here we were picking up on the<br>cooperation work we had previously shown<br>that nine-month-olds didn't understand<br>cooperation so Ying right there um he's<br>here thank you um Ying conducted a study<br>where she did active experience with the<br>9month of 9-month olds so 9-month olds<br>participated with the experimenter and<br>cooperated and that participation<br>changed how the 9month olds viewed that<br>event suggesting that active experience<br>is really important in shaping learning<br>in infants<br>Yin continued to build on this work in<br>her PhD in which now we knew that babies<br>kind of seem to appreciate some aspects<br>of cooperation we started to play around<br>with it a little bit Ying wanted to know<br>what do babies think about the<br>consequences of cooperation so as adults<br>when we work together with someone to<br>make dinner we expect to eat that dinner<br>together right and we expect to share<br>that dinner right Jackson share<br>equally um and we also expect that if<br>someone doesn't do as much work maybe<br>they don't get dessert or they don't get<br>as much stuff okay not always the case<br>but nonetheless Ying developed some<br>paradigms to test these questions and we<br>demonstrated that babies did seem to<br>appreciate at least some of these basic<br>concepts of<br>cooperation so things were really cool<br>at this point we were doing lots of work<br>on infants understanding of cooperation<br>in these looking time paradigms at the<br>same time people were doing all these<br>Behavioral Studies looking at how kids<br>cooperate but we were all doing things<br>in different parts of the world and not<br>communicating we had no idea if these<br>early looking time studies mapped on to<br>what they actually do in the real world<br>we also didn't know if this over time<br>started to show like these babies who<br>show these initial understandings are<br>they good Cooperators and there's also<br>evidence with adults that cooperation<br>makes us happy and healthy people we had<br>no idea if these things happened with<br>kids so while thinking about all this I<br>was like we really need to solve this<br>problem so we should do a study so the<br>Orca study was born so it's a<br>longitudinal study in which we looked at<br>the development of cooperation from<br>infancy through to about 8 years of age<br>um that study took a little while to get<br>funded I did have a few margins that<br>didn't quite go through but fortunately<br>at some point in time it did so we were<br>able to start the study that study<br>started as five data collection waves<br>with over 200 families coming into the<br>lab and I was able to build on that when<br>I was fortunate enough to receive the<br>Rutherford Fellowship as well so this is<br>a really big study with many different<br>measures I'm not going to talk about<br>them all but I'm going to highlight some<br>of the findings from two key PhD<br>students who ran this work and I'd also<br>highlight that Khloe Moore who is in the<br>house helped run most of those studies<br>um as well so thank you Chloe for being<br>here today to share this with me so<br>Nicole was a PhD student who looked at<br>the cooperation stuff and there's a lot<br>of words on here I'll let you read the<br>words I'm not going to say them all but<br>basically we showed that the looking<br>Time stuff is different from the<br>behavioral stuff and the behavioral<br>stuff is different from motivation stuff<br>so all of these things are very diverse<br>constructs and we're not quite sure what<br>to make of that quite yet but it's<br>important to do these things all in one<br>study because if we didn't we'd think<br>that these things are all related and<br>maybe there's just it seems to be that<br>there's different capacities that feed<br>into it parents play a role in shaping<br>children's Cooperative behavior and<br>infants peer cooperation is influenced<br>by warm-up interactions so this makes<br>sense right when we meet someone new if<br>we don't get along with that person<br>we're like we're not going to cooperate<br>well with that person but nobody had<br>really looked at that with kids and most<br>importantly they have kids come in and<br>do these studies and they meet each<br>other and nobody looks at what happens<br>when they meet each other so we kind of<br>actually surprisingly came across this<br>finding to show and showed that children<br>who have a somewhat awkward initial<br>inter interaction tend to be less able<br>to cooperate as well with that beer<br>Nicole um Cena Cena gibart came into the<br>picture and she was interested in<br>looking at the pro-social behavior side<br>so we had extended the cooperation study<br>to other pro-social behaviors and she<br>also found that helping sharing and<br>comforting are also incredibly diverse<br>constructs and not only are they<br>different from one another which some<br>other people had already shown you can't<br>even average tasks within helping so a<br>child who helped in one context wouldn't<br>necessarily help in another context so<br>researchers were adding these things all<br>together and averaging but for us we<br>weren't able to do that so again raises<br>lots of questions but makes sense we<br>can't get people to help all the time<br>and some people maybe in our school and<br>University they might help sometimes but<br>not other times right so we need to kind<br>of figure out these individual<br>differences to try to kind of get more<br>help in all these cases Cena also showed<br>that pro-social behavior is tied with<br>happiness children who helped more<br>quickly were more happy and watching<br>other people engage in pro-social<br>Behavior made children happier and have<br>more positive emotions so all these<br>things are coming together showing that<br>cooperation and communication are<br>happening early in life the next<br>important well another important<br>question is where are these things all<br>coming from some of you might be like<br>might be thinking to yourself<br>nine-month-olds man they know an awful<br>lot that's amazing well infants are<br>engaging in coordinated interactions<br>with the people in the world from the<br>moment they're born they might not be<br>grabbing objects and cooperating by<br>taking toys out of boxes but they're<br>engaging in coordinated cooperation Loop<br>for me to illustrate this to you I<br>pulled a really one of my favorite ones<br>Collection<br>what so C so if you're ever depressed or<br>having a bad day just like play this and<br>it makes you happy um when I'm mad at<br>Jackson maybe I just play this I<br>remember oh look how cute he is never<br>happens never um anyway so what you saw<br>is this is a coordinated interaction<br>Loop one of the partners does something<br>the other one responds and it Cycles<br>around to a wonderfully beautiful<br>Cooperative interaction these<br>Cooperative interactions are driven<br>primarily by responsiveness<br>responsiveness of the caregiver to the<br>infant and the infant to the caregiver<br>so responsiveness is a key variable to<br>capture these early coordinated Loops so<br>interestingly enough I was pulling stuff<br>together this year I realized I do a lot<br>of responsiveness stuff in the different<br>kinds of studies that we do so it took a<br>long time to figure out for me to figure<br>out how I was going to get there but<br>here we go this is how I got here so if<br>we think of responsiveness as a key<br>variable that influences interactive<br>Loops we can think of it as a parenting<br>behavior in this case if we're just<br>talking about the parenting<br>responsiveness so I Maria corkin was a<br>PhD student of mine and lizes and she<br>didn't look at responsiveness<br>necessarily in her main part of the<br>thesis but used this model for her work<br>and I wanted to pull it from her thesis<br>because it helps me think about why we<br>want to look at responsiveness and why<br>do we want to think of the different<br>factors that influence responsiveness<br>and this is because like I said<br>responsiveness is a key part of those<br>interactive loops and we see variability<br>in responsiveness across caregiver diets<br>and relationships and that variability<br>is shaped to different outcomes so<br>identifying the factors that influence<br>responsiveness is really important for<br>identify identifying ways of enhancing<br>relationships and interactions so I've<br>been a part of a few studies that have<br>looked at this but I'm going to<br>highlight one tonight and this is a<br>study that wasn't designed necessarily<br>to look at responsiveness but does so in<br>a way by looking at factors that<br>influence responsiveness namely parents<br>health and well-being a stressful<br>situation and the marital relationship<br>and this study comes from our wonderful<br>resilience and well-being study which is<br>led by nicoa overall and her Reach team<br>and I am come into the Child Development<br>arm of the study and this study was<br>designed to look at parents' conflict<br>engagement and recovery from conflict<br>and how that influences the family and<br>child and health and well-being over<br>time one key indicator of high quality<br>parenting in our study is caregiver<br>responsiveness now this study received<br>funding in<br>2018 it was a longitudinal study that<br>was supposed to go for three years 8<br>plus 3 goes to<br>2021 what happened during that time<br>awesomeness really was what it was right<br>we had this incredibly stressful<br>situation Co was stressful for everybody<br>it was really stressful for families<br>with young children so while we were<br>doing the study Nia and the Reach team<br>had this fantastic idea that we should<br>do more research and come out reach out<br>to our families to see how they're doing<br>during the lockdowns it was fantastic<br>because we had all of this data before<br>the pandemic so we could look to see how<br>change happened so what I want to do for<br>today's talk is just pull on one key<br>find that we found out in that study<br>about caregiver responsiveness so what<br>we found out in that study<br>is parents who were stressed reported<br>lower levels of caregiver responsiveness<br>so there stress reduced the extent to<br>which they could be responsive to their<br>child and this was particularly the case<br>in this covid-19 lockdown where even<br>controlling for their initial stress<br>levels those increased stress from the<br>pandemic also reduced caregiver was<br>associated with reductions in caregiver<br>responsiveness but the story wasn't all<br>sad for us because we found something<br>that actually helped buffer or reduce<br>the negative impact of that stress on<br>caregiver responsiveness and this was<br>the Cooperative co-parenting so the<br>extent to which parents reported having<br>the other parent who is cooperative with<br>them in it and helping them help raise<br>their child they did not report those<br>reductions or they were less likely to<br>report those reductions in in caregiver<br>responsiveness so this study um provides<br>some really neat new data to show that<br>stress particularly in a particularly<br>stressful time is associated with<br>reduced responsiveness but that<br>cooperative co-parent Ing and aspects of<br>that marital relationship can help it<br>out so identifying what factors shape<br>responsiveness like I said is important<br>because then we can start to figure out<br>why responsiveness might increase or<br>decrease and hopefully support optimal<br>outcomes in children this could work if<br>we could actually design studies where<br>we had a caregiver being responsive and<br>manipulating aspects of the child to see<br>how those changes in children's Behavior<br>influences caregiver resp responsiveness<br>now we can't do that we can't tell<br>children hey child stop responding to<br>your caregiver now they don't listen to<br>us often but you know we can't do that<br>in an experimental Paradigm we can do<br>the reverse so we know from lots of<br>other research that researchers have<br>asked caregivers to stop responding to<br>their child and you can see what babies<br>do they don't like it very much they get<br>very frustrated so we know one part of<br>the loop but we don't know the second<br>part of the loop we don't know what<br>caregivers are particularly sensitive<br>too inel now so my team um in<br>collaboration with Mark sear who has<br>affiliations with the Auckland<br>bioengineering Institute and soul<br>machines a company have been working to<br>develop baby x baby x is a novel<br>interactive experimental tool to test<br>how that we would like to use or are<br>using to test how infant shaped<br>caregivers interactive responsiveness<br>this study has been going on for a long<br>time this is one of my second most<br>enjoying collaborations I met Mark over<br>10 years ago over dinner when a speaker<br>was here Alison gnik very cool speaker<br>very cool dinner and Mark said hey you<br>do research with babies and I said yes<br>goes check this out and he showed me his<br>digital baby and it was a it was amazing<br>it was super realistic even then and I<br>said okay what are you doing with this<br>he's like well I'm going to make it act<br>like a real baby and I said okay so do<br>you have data and he said no I said well<br>do you want some so that dinner this is<br>why dinners and social interactions can<br>be really important to our lives um<br>fueled this decade long um collaboration<br>so we've done a ton of different kinds<br>of studies looking at caregivers<br>interacting with their own baby<br>caregivers interacting with another baby<br>caregivers interacting with their own<br>baby through a digital device all in the<br>name of creating a library and<br>understanding all the different ways<br>that caregivers and infants interact to<br>help us inform the development of baby x<br>we've finally gotten to the point that<br>we are conducting our first study with<br>baby x and this is Florian who's our<br>research manager for the study and doing<br>a spectacular job I don't know where you<br>went oh there you are woohoo thank you<br>floran I'm still working with Mark and<br>we've added to our Cooperative team and<br>this was fundamental um adding in these<br>new collaborators because just talking<br>to them and the kinds of information we<br>can develop for our study with these<br>collaborators and we have some students<br>in the house who are working on the<br>project too so I'm not going to explain<br>baby x to you I'm just going to show you<br>baby<br>x what's this I think that's a get for<br>another one of the<br>insects do you think it could<br>be this one yeah bugs bugs ah bugs bugs<br>bugs yeah oh you got in the way<br>hello peekaboo peekaboo where did you go<br>where did I go I can't see you you can't<br>see me peekabo peekaboo we are not<br>controlling baby x baby x is<br>responding socially contingent Pig here<br>is a what it's a farm<br>animal animal yeah pek is an animal it<br>is<br>are you okay do you need to suck on your<br>thumb are you sure you need to do<br>that sock Thum need<br>sock how come you need sock do you feel<br>nervous me feel happy oh good that's<br>very<br>good woof woof woof woof good job woof<br>woof there he is<br>dog doggy Douglas doggy Douglas is that<br>W is that the dog's name<br>Douglas doggy<br>Douglas I like it wolf wolf what about<br>the cow what's the cow's<br>okay so you can actually watch baby x<br>videos forever it's quite entertaining<br>what we're using is we're using baby x<br>who is what we argue is our plausible<br>simulation of a baby to test the effect<br>of changes in infant behavior on<br>caregiver Behavior so we're able to<br>complete the loop in this research or at<br>least make a first step to hopefully<br>completing this Loop in understanding<br>how babies and children shape caregiver<br>responsiveness and I had to do a sh<br>Shameless plug because we really need<br>dads so in this kind of literature with<br>parents there's so much parent data on<br>moms we know what moms are doing all the<br>time with their children but we can't<br>get dads in there as much so if you do<br>know any dads of who have a one-year-old<br>child please um tell them about this<br>neat study so in the research so far<br>I've showed you how I've achieved the<br>five goals of Developmental Psychology<br>by looking at words and communication<br>cooperation and social interactions I'm<br>so happy to be here but there's still so<br>much more work to do we have big studies<br>stuff with our raw studies to still<br>follow up and look at the Orca study has<br>a ton of stuff to actually understand<br>how these outcomes happen across time<br>we'd like to use baby x to hopefully<br>enhance caregiver responsiveness and not<br>just parent responsiveness but<br>caregivers of maybe children who are<br>working at an early Child Care Center<br>maybe to see to encourage them to kind<br>of be more sensitive to aspects of<br>infant Behavior we're also looking to<br>collaborate with a German German<br>University the kind research group who<br>is studying the development of kindness<br>and children and have an intervention to<br>enhance kindness and caring in preschool<br>and primary school age kids babyx is not<br>just a tool for this particular study<br>there's ton of stuff we could look at in<br>developmental science and I'd really<br>like to get the lab moving and get the<br>research not just in the lolb but in<br>developmental science out into the<br>community more so we're making some um<br>directions in that Sam recently tested<br>at motat which is fantastic we'd like to<br>make connections across and get our<br>research out to other people in the<br>field because we still have some limited<br>understanding of the families and the<br>children of<br>AOA so there's lots of other research<br>highlights that I didn't get into I went<br>to vanu to do some research on<br>cooperation Quinton kindly allowed me to<br>come along with one of his research<br>trips Russell and I and Quinton and the<br>team went to vanu watu to talk about<br>language with the the communities uh<br>Karen and Liz early on in my time at the<br>University of Auckland invited me as an<br>adviser in the growing up in New Zealand<br>study I'm really grateful for that it<br>was fantastic to just be there in those<br>early years and it's it's been great<br>working with you and continuing to work<br>with you I'm part of an international<br>collaboration replication effort working<br>with Yim who's a current PhD student and<br>working with a community organization<br>and collaborating first with Kelsey Dean<br>on school gardening and kids and now<br>with Emma sharp and being able to look<br>to see how gardening and cooperation out<br>in the in the dirt right with kids help<br>shape their health and well-being I love<br>this job because of science<br>communication so you can tell I like to<br>talk sorry but part of the joys is<br>actually talking to the media not just<br>talking about my research talking about<br>other people's research helping the<br>public understand what it is we do and<br>what this can tell us about development<br>and I am looking forward to to the<br>future of being the inaugural director<br>of the new center for developmental<br>science so has it all been jazz hands I<br>show a lot of jazz hands and I seem<br>really happy and passionate which I am<br>but there are challenges there always<br>are we moved labs in the middle of a<br>longitudinal study that move in the lab<br>was interesting per se but Chloe was<br>there and helped me through it which was<br>fantastic and did the rest of the lab<br>along the way um life is a balancing act<br>so it was really easy to well not easy<br>but I was an academic for a while and<br>then I became a parent which became a<br>particularly incredible interesting time<br>in my life to try to juggle everything<br>then on top of that we had a pandemic<br>which added things even more but as a<br>developmental science challenges breeds<br>resilience and strength and happiness<br>maybe anyways resilience nonetheless so<br>life was pretty challenging there were<br>times that I've experienced losses from<br>afar couldn't get there in time but<br>through that my relationships have<br>become stronger with the people here in<br>New Zealand and my family so thank you<br>to the colleagues who have supported me<br>through those tricky times being a<br>parent Yanik it's been fantastic to<br>raise Jackson with you Jackson you are<br>wonderful you are fantastic and you are<br>clever and amazing and I know you get a<br>little bit sad that you're sharing me<br>with everybody he is very jealous of my<br>students um for those of you who are not<br>in there but I love you and you are you<br>and I am me and we're together and it's<br>fine<br>okay um the lockdowns they were<br>stressful but they were also a lot of<br>fun we had to parent yanuk and I both<br>have stressful jobs so we just divided<br>and conquered um I loved seeing yanuk<br>and Jackson dress up when they were<br>drawing that was neat but it was truly<br>some special family time my lab is<br>fantastic every year I've got a<br>fantastic lab so I just pick random<br>years of pictures to show just how<br>amazing they are but Co was amazing we<br>pulled together to keep doing good re<br>research doing research in tricky times<br>but we still kept it going and it was<br>because of the team working together and<br>I also want to highlight the raw study<br>again that was very tricky to do the<br>covid lockdowns I was doing all that<br>stuff and not really being able to um<br>contribute as much as the rest of the<br>raw team so that team produced some<br>really important data for the covid<br>lockdowns and I'm incredibly grateful<br>Nia for leading that team and yeah<br>amazing stuff so here I am almost there<br>takaa<br>takahara so I am standing up here giving<br>this talk but as you can see my success<br>is not just mine alone it's a huge<br>amount of team and people throughout the<br>years who have played an important role<br>in this and I started writing a list of<br>literally all the professional staff and<br>the technical staff and everybody who<br>has helped me along the way and I just<br>it would look really bad on the slide<br>but please know I mean you're here today<br>and I'm incredibly grateful the<br>professional staff the technical teams<br>the research support teams my La lab is<br>a is a beast there's a ton of technology<br>and I always require help and I'm just<br>incredibly grateful for all the support<br>that I've experienced from this<br>University over the years this is a big<br>text slide here are all my collaborators<br>hopefully I've remembered everybody<br>recent collabor re um students the re<br>the bolded ones are students who are<br>currently working with me or I'm<br>currently actively collaborating with<br>them<br>and above this I also have undergraduate<br>volunteers take part in the lab they<br>learn how to do some of our research and<br>from that they get hands-on experience<br>with with research and they also ask us<br>for reference letters along the way and<br>many of those people have been your<br>students and have become successful<br>academics too I know Joan's in here<br>somewhere and there's many other ones as<br>well denina you were also um and I also<br>want to highlight um Christina wiy who's<br>been<br>love you um she's been a research<br>assistant in my team for a very long<br>time and has been incredible for<br>everything so thank you Christina for<br>all your support for all of the<br>developmental people in the team thank<br>you and to my current students you guys<br>are fantastic I've been a little crazy<br>this year but you're holding it together<br>and I really appreciate you of course<br>the funders I've put the successes I've<br>had with funding behind this is a whole<br>ton of of not successes okay so I'm<br>incredibly grateful for the re people<br>who have funded This research cuz I<br>can't do it without funding it's<br>expensive it's resource intensive we<br>have to code a ton of data and that's<br>washing a lot of videos of these family<br>interactions so thank you to all the<br>funders and for people who have written<br>those grants with me and helped me with<br>those grants and finally to the<br>thousands thousands of parents infants<br>and children who have volunteered their<br>time for our research thank you to them<br>for being a part of the team so I<br>started out with a fatoki that talks<br>about the import of people in our lives<br>I hope that you've seen that the people<br>in my life have been so important and<br>the research is awesome and being a<br>professor is amazing but it wouldn't be<br>so fun I if I was doing it all by myself<br>and actually it would have been<br>impossible so I want to end with this<br>end my presentation with this faka<br>because as I move forward<br>fak faka I'm going to keep thinking<br>about the things that I've experienced<br>and the people who I've known so I can<br>move forward and thank you to you
