I'm<br>Margaret Highland and I'm the DVC<br>research here at sading<br>aaka uh this is a policy Hub event<br>that's run in Partnership uh between<br>Victoria University of Wellington we<br>host the policy Hub and the University<br>of<br>ockland uh the policy Hub aims to bridge<br>the gap between academic and policy<br>community<br>today we are launching a project which<br>will take a multidisciplinary approach<br>to deepen our understanding about how to<br>M to build and maintain uh trust uh the<br>aim then is to apply that knowledge to<br>key challenges such as how to maintain<br>trust and how we adapt to climate change<br>and how to ensure trust is maintained<br>with increasing use of<br>AI um uh there there's a lot on the the<br>agenda today so I'll try and keep it<br>brief but there's a few introductions<br>first and in reverse order here um so<br>I'm opening it as a representative toing<br>aaka and my colleague uh Professor<br>Stuart mcnorton from the University of<br>ockland will provide the closing<br>comments uh Stuart as well as being a<br>professor at the University of ockland<br>in education was the inaugural Chief<br>science advisor at the Ministry of<br>Education<br>um and now to our speakers uh Dr Mona<br>kille is the academic lead for the<br>policy Hub and she's a senior lecturer<br>in comparative politics with a<br>specialization in the study of Elections<br>political parties in public<br>opinion uh she's here at Victoria<br>University of Wellington she's also the<br>director of the internet social media<br>and politics research<br>lab um and in case you didn't know him<br>um Professor sir Ashley Bloomfield as<br>director general of Health LED New<br>Zealand's Public Health response to the<br>covid-19 pandemic uh he was appointed a<br>KN companion of the New Zealand order of<br>Merit in uh 2023 and has a range of uh<br>well-deserved accolades behind his name<br>uh what you may not know is that he<br>joined the University of Oakland in 2023<br>as a professor in the School of Public<br>Health health and he is currently the<br>acting chief executive of the Karan<br>Research Institute ESR so I'll now hand<br>comments<br>kotu thank you very much to all of you<br>who have joined us in the room here<br>today and there are many also joining<br>online and I<br>understand colleagues gathering together<br>at the University of Oakland uh thank<br>you very much for welcoming us for<br>hosting us here Margaret um and I want<br>to just acknowledge uh Nick Smith who's<br>the vice Chancellor here in the room and<br>our vice Chancellor daor freshwater in<br>Oakland who I spoke with just yesterday<br>very interested uh and supportive of<br>this um initiative that we're getting<br>underway jointly between the two<br>universities uh and just a quick nod to<br>uh Andrew Jackson uh at un at Victoria<br>University Lisa Wong at ockland and Leah<br>and her team for getting us here and set<br>up and uh ready to go today so what I<br>want to do is share with you some data<br>from uh the What's called the idelman<br>acum trust barometer uh here in New<br>Zealand and I'm just going to get the<br>there we go so this survey which has<br>done uh in 29 countries around the world<br>uh looks at trust in institutions and I<br>want to share with you the data from the<br>latest wave of this survey which has<br>been going for about 20 years actually<br>internationally uh and just to show you<br>where trust is at in New Zealand to help<br>set the scene now some of the data I'm<br>presenting uh when Mona presents she's<br>got some similar uh trust metrics but<br>from a different survey the numbers<br>might be slightly different but you'll<br>see the patterns are actually very<br>similar so when we talk about trust<br>which is of course essential for<br>functioning societies not just<br>democracies but for any society to<br>function you need two aspects of trust<br>to be strong first of all the trust<br>between people between citizens we have<br>to as we go about our daily lives trust<br>that the people next to us in our work<br>sitting in the lecture theater our<br>neighbors and across Society will abide<br>by the the sort of the written and<br>Unwritten rules we have to trust each<br>other that we're going to do the right<br>thing most laws are not uh actually<br>enforced by the police they rely on<br>people just accepting that this is<br>society's uh the norm that Society has<br>set and that people are going to trust<br>are not just going to do it but they're<br>going to trust that other people do it<br>because if you don't trust other people<br>are going to do it there's very little<br>incentive to do something yourself but<br>second and this is what we're going to<br>focus more on today is trust and<br>institutions and Edelman acum trust<br>barometer looks at trust and four key<br>institutions<br>government private the private sector<br>non-government organizations or civil<br>media uh as I said this is a survey down<br>in 29 countries it's just over a<br>thousand respondents per country there's<br>good Trend data over time and here in<br>New Zealand the organization Acumen<br>carries out the survey and then presents<br>the data comparing New Zealand to the<br>other 28 countries and it includes as<br>you will see a mix of countries both<br>High inome middle income countries<br>developing and<br>developed so from the latest survey data<br>and these data were collected in<br>November 2023 actually so just after our<br>general election here in<br>Al and you can see New Zealand in the<br>middle there so that this is an overall<br>metric of trust in institutions we're in<br>the early 50s there<br>one of the interesting things here is<br>that the average for uh developing<br>countries is quite a bit higher than the<br>uh the average for developed<br>countries and you know we could<br>speculate and maybe this will come out<br>in our panel discussion as to why that<br>might be but it's it's very interesting<br>to see which countries are in the top<br>five and that's quite consistent over<br>well so most of the data I will present<br>are about trust and insti tions but<br>there is there is also a question in<br>this last survey about trust in people<br>who do you trust to do the right thing<br>in New Zealand and there are two uh uh<br>data points here I particularly want to<br>point out the first is<br>scientists now there is a there has been<br>this view articulated that following the<br>pandemic especially there's been this<br>decline in trust and Science And<br>scientists in fact that's not the case<br>it's held up quite high and I think<br>Mona's got a data point from another<br>survey in New Zealand that uh that shows<br>this as well that minus 4 for new uh<br>globally is is interesting because<br>actually uh uh for for New Zealand sorry<br>is interesting but it hasn't plummeted<br>it's in it's stayed in the 70s and it<br>actually had increased slightly during<br>the<br>pandemic the other one I want to point<br>to here and this is the one uh trust in<br>citizens of my country and again New<br>Zealand's pretty much right on the<br>global average 63% it's actually a bit<br>higher now than it was through um the<br>middle of the pandemic interestingly<br>when the way we behaved as a country<br>showed high levels of trust between<br>people although we did find out this<br>other aspect of us that we're quite good<br>Dober iners as well if people are not<br>abiding by the rules but here we are so<br>63% we could say about 2/3 of of kiwis<br>similar to the global average uh trust<br>that other people in their country are<br>going to do the right thing<br>Trends are your friend and I think this<br>is interesting and just a comment to<br>make about these four different groups<br>first of all for business we've seen<br>this quite significant increase and<br>sustained increase in trust in business<br>in alar and it sort of happened during<br>the pandemic and it's held<br>up trust and NGS dipped down pre<br>pandemic and has come up again but I<br>find this quite interesting that there's<br>not a high level of trust in<br>non-government organizations and Civil<br>Society organiz ations and I I I wonder<br>if this is about the question and for<br>those of you who are here in the room<br>you may have passed the Wellington free<br>ambulance people collecting today and I<br>think if you asked about specific<br>non-government organizations like Red<br>Cross for example or IHC or bernardos or<br>whatever it might be we might find there<br>was a higher um there was a higher level<br>of trust because I find this quite<br>surprising in New Zealand maybe<br>something we'll get into as a panel<br>trust in government over overall<br>uh went up quite significantly during<br>the pandemic as you can see and then<br>it's dropped back to what it was at its<br>pre-pandemic<br>level uh so if you think about that<br>figure in the overall uh metric which<br>was 51% trust in government's a bit<br>lower than that it's the trust and<br>business in particular that pulls that<br>up uh and um the media well we know from<br>quite a lot of surveys that there's a<br>lower level of trust in the media in New<br>Zealand and in fact it's lower quite a<br>bit lower<br>than it is in other countries the<br>average of other countries but you can<br>see it it did go up during the pandemic<br>and in fact people turned to the<br>mainstream media as their main source of<br>information especially at 1:00 uh there<br>was nothing else to see uh you know you<br>there was a sort of live show um uh IMDB<br>ratings that um any show would kill for<br>right Trust in Media sources now this is<br>quite interesting because if you think<br>back to that previous slide was there as<br>low Trust in the media generally<br>actually uh there is a high level of<br>trust in the in in the mainstream media<br>in uh General traditional media in New<br>Zealand uh than for example social media<br>and if you look at our our result here<br>in Alti compared with the global average<br>on social media we are quite skeptical<br>of social media as a source of<br>information compared with the global<br>average uh so low level of trust in<br>owned in uh traditional media but<br>actually pretty reasonable level of<br>trust in as a source of information in<br>general news although again quite a bit<br>lower than the global<br>average this is a bit telling people who<br>worry in New Zealand establishment<br>leaders not trusted to to tell the truth<br>and I just want to point out there are<br>two aspects of this purposely trying to<br>mislead by saying things they know are<br>false or are gross<br>exaggerations and I think that latter<br>bit is is is a particular issue for the<br>media the catastrophizing of things now<br>this is not a new thing Lynden B Johnson<br>I think it was in the late 60s said if I<br>walked on water across the pomac<br>tomorrow the headline the next day would<br>be president can't<br>swim so it's not a new thing but it's<br>it's very much more apparent now because<br>the new cycle is so fast and if every<br>story is leading out with failure and<br>crisis then it feels overwhelming for<br>people and I think this may well be one<br>of the issues where uh and you can see<br>actually people people are more likely<br>to think that journalists are grossly<br>exaggerating or not telling the complete<br>truth than they are government or<br>Business Leaders quite a significant<br>difference<br>there just want to move on uh now to<br>this issue of and quite handily the<br>survey last year looked at the<br>integration of innovation into<br>society so this is trust in these<br>different institutions that they will be<br>introduced into society in a way that is<br>safe understood by the public beneficial<br>and accessible and you can see in Altera<br>we've got quite low levels of trust comp<br>compared with the global average in<br>these different institutions even in NGS<br>I mean again I find this quite<br>surprising but there's some really good<br>information here and the four the the<br>four uh innovations that were looked at<br>with with green Energy gene-based<br>Medicine Ai and GMO foods and you see<br>it's green energy is actually there<br>pretty reasonable levels of trust in<br>that Embrace people Embrace that<br>Innovation people are really not that<br>sure about Ai and I think that's an<br>interesting one for us because it's it's<br>the coming wave it really<br>is oh someone's more interesting than I<br>am obviously but uh there we go so just<br>Innovations going back to that trust in<br>science actually who is that that people<br>expect<br>to have a role and and want to lead the<br>introduction of those Innovations it's<br>scientists and Technical experts much<br>higher level of trust in those two<br>groups than in government business even<br>NOS to introduce these Technologies and<br>I think this is an important point for<br>you universities to note because that's<br>where people tend to see a lot of our<br>our scientists are based not all of them<br>I'm part of a crown Research Institute<br>now so we've got quite a uh We've our<br>science system is wider than<br>universities but a lot of our scientists<br>are associated with universities as our<br>out technical experts and they've got a<br>key role to<br>play in building the trust that is<br>needed to to ensure that these new<br>technologies are introduced<br>not rocket science this but when people<br>were asked what is it that you want uh<br>what's important to help keep or earn<br>trust to help us introduce these new<br>technologies two key things here and<br>it's pretty basic but it's really really<br>important hear our concerns and let us<br>ask<br>questions communicate pluses and minuses<br>people want to know what are the risks<br>what are the benefits and the risks in<br>again back to help me find information I<br>can trust where is I most I get most of<br>my information about new technologies<br>and Innovation well actually National<br>media<br>again as<br>trusted ahead of social media it's a<br>trust it's trusted ahead of friends and<br>neighbors people also use Dr Google a<br>lot find that in<br>medicine so there's the sort of<br>dissonance between quite a low level of<br>Trust in Media but actually people do<br>tune to it as a source of information<br>and one would assume that there's a they<br>trust the information even if they may<br>be frustrated as it were more than<br>anything else with with the media and my<br>final slide here and this is an oecd uh<br>report that came out in February last<br>last year<br>2023 and so the second part I've<br>highlighted it here recommendations for<br>further strengthening trust and all of<br>these are reposit and they're all things<br>that are being talked about at the<br>moment making Public Services more<br>responsive<br>integrating long-term thinking into<br>policymaking and that's a real challenge<br>it is a real Challenge and we talk about<br>our short electoral cycle that's only a<br>part of it actually it's a we need a<br>political environment that is going to<br>both uh encourage and support long-term<br>thinking and there are many areas where<br>we could apply this to at the moment and<br>be much better off as a country<br>infrastructure climate change adaptation<br>health and<br>education uh countering the spread of<br>Miss and disinformation and I think a<br>better term now I I've T tend to use<br>this term now harmful inaccurate<br>information it's less loaded it's less<br>loaded because one person's so-called<br>misinformation may be another person's<br>truth but actually if it's harmful and<br>inaccurate that's the information that<br>we should be most worried about and<br>reinforcing New Zealand's Integrity<br>system and there's been quite a bit in<br>the media on this lately hasn't there<br>this is about you know lobbying access<br>to ministers and and in the government<br>and Trust in the public service so with<br>that I'd like to hand over now to to<br>Mona who's going to talk in particular<br>about uh the Trust In in institutions<br>and democracy and Altera around<br>you uh thank you very much K Kor um<br>Ashley Bloomfield uh and thank you all<br>for showing up today to our not so small<br>public lecture I have to say so I'm<br>going to talk about about trust in<br>elections and other Democratic processes<br>in New Zealand today so I'm not<br>introducing you to a specific trust<br>survey like Ashley did but I'm<br>introducing you to the New Zealand<br>election study which we are running<br>in-house here at Victoria University<br>also a cooperation with Auckland by the<br>way uh since the 1990s um and I will<br>mostly show you results on political<br>trust from this postelection survey that<br>uh is more than uh a trust survey it's<br>mostly a survey that is explaining<br>voting behavior but I think it's very<br>important to look at uh trust in times<br>of Elections because these are<br>heightened periods of political<br>communication um who can also kind of<br>engage or do not engage people uh in<br>politics um the other study I will show<br>you some results from is the New Zealand<br>social media study of which I'm one of<br>the pis as well and which we run since<br>the 2020 election um and which is<br>graciously funded uh has been funded by<br>the office of the vice Chancellor the<br>deputy Vice Chancellor research the<br>gamma foundation and now also partly<br>through an MB Endeavor smart ideas Grant<br>um and so as I will make the point uh<br>that we in particular need a healthy uh<br>information ecosystem I think and Ashley<br>has already been talking about uh<br>thisinformation I will show you a little<br>bit of results from that study as well<br>which is in particular studying false<br>and harmful information um but let's<br>Jump Right In uh first of all a few<br>results on trust in mostly political but<br>also some other institutions in New<br>Zealand from the New Zealand election<br>study Ashley has already uh shown you a<br>lot um and he has mentioned uh that I<br>have a different data source but the<br>pattern is kind of the same and good<br>news for a lot of people in the room<br>scientists are number one here if we<br>Rank by trust so the vote of confidence<br>in US is High um and I think this is<br>also an important point to make that we<br>need to<br>um make informed uh contributions to the<br>public debate as scientists and go out<br>of the universities and engage people<br>and communicate our results because<br>people have a high trust uh in US uh and<br>so we cannot just hide uh in the Ivory<br>Tower um some of the abstract<br>institutions this is actually something<br>that we see across a lot of countries<br>still receive very high trust like the<br>justice system government Parliament um<br>uh but some of the ones that I will<br>specifically look in today is more like<br>let's say the specific parties and<br>politicians who are usually<br>traditionally low when it comes to<br>political trust you could now rightfully<br>argue okay so people associate that with<br>specific parties or specific politicians<br>that they dislike you could also<br>rightfully argue as long as like the<br>general institutions receive rep um<br>support and in particular the a regime<br>type like democracy we are still good I<br>won't fight you on this one because I<br>agree with you but I think it's also<br>interesting um to look at the ones that<br>are traditionally low and try to explain<br>why um because if they mess up for a<br>long time this will erode the trust in<br>the general institutions and then we<br>have a real problem in a democracy um so<br>let's look at trust in politicians uh as<br>the first uh group um which is uh<br>something that is usually very low so<br>here we have the statement most po<br>politicians are trustworthy on a scale<br>from one to five uh so one uh is<br>basically like um very strong agreement<br>with that statement um and no so sorry<br>uh one is um very low disagreement<br>basically with that statement and five<br>is very high agreement and you see that<br>over the last three elections um this<br>has been declining three elections are<br>already a trend and as you say Trends<br>are friends um and so this means it's<br>it's actually not a friendly Trend um so<br>it is decreasing which should con<br>concern us um so a lot of this has to do<br>with the perceptions of politicians uh<br>of course um how people view them uh<br>which is important um so we have some<br>statements here uh regarding the<br>perceptions of politicians from the New<br>Zealand election study in<br>2023 um and here we have like most<br>politicians behave with great integrity<br>and I think it's kind of uh very some<br>that uh at least can I point to that one<br>yes I can um that at least like a<br>quarter of new zealanders somewhat<br>disagree uh with the statement that<br>politicians behave with great integrity<br>um so that means uh basically uh around<br>uh more than 25% uh we have like uh lost<br>in this most politicians care only about<br>their own interests so um over 40% of<br>the people somewhat agree with such a<br>statement um which is probably also uh<br>very<br>some um if we look at most most<br>politicians care only about the<br>interests of the rich and the powerful<br>you see that this is like almost equally<br>divided 50/50 as many people who<br>somewhat agree we have the same amount<br>like almost the same amount of people<br>who somewhat disagree with that h and a<br>large group is also split in the Middle<br>with naida um but that in a society many<br>people believe that politicians only<br>care about the interests of the rich and<br>the powerful is not a good thing um so<br>most politician act in the best interest<br>of us uh of all of us um somewhat<br>disagree is again um around 25% so again<br>like um a quarter of new zealanders are<br>not on board with that one um we see<br>already the image of politicians is not<br>very good um standards of honesty and<br>integrity of elected politicians in New<br>Zealand here we have like the same<br>picture before like almost split in half<br>the majority of people sits like in the<br>middle and says uh neither uh they are<br>adhering to standards of honesty and<br>integrity and this is not something we<br>would want uh to see uh in a<br>democracy um so what affects trust in<br>political institutions um so now we move<br>on a step from the descriptive results<br>to some multivariate regression results<br>and I bet a lot of people were like oh<br>my God I always hated math don't do this<br>to me so I promise I will not lose you<br>on this one um so let me explain like a<br>multivariant regression this means we<br>take a lot of independent variables so a<br>lot of factors that we think might<br>affect the dependent variable which is<br>either trust in politicians or trust in<br>political parties or trust in social<br>media and we look at which of those<br>independent variables explain which um<br>um amount of variance of the dependent<br>variable so we throw a lot of uh stuff<br>on the wall and see what sticks and<br>where we have a positive or A NE<br>negative significant effect so what<br>affects trust in X um or you can in<br>other words say we throw that into the<br>cocktail shaker uh and see like what<br>comes out significant um so let's look<br>at the first dependent variable trust in<br>political parties um so um usually uh to<br>walk you through this we have like the<br>zero line here and what is like below<br>the zero line is like a negative effect<br>what is up the zero line is like a<br>positive effect uh in this plot what and<br>the other questions then is it<br>statistically significant I want to draw<br>your attention particular to the ones<br>that I have like in circled in Orange<br>here because uh this is the point uh<br>that I want to make our dependent<br>variable is trust in political parties<br>we actually see that like regular users<br>of high quality newspapers in New<br>Zealand this has a positive effect uh in<br>political Trust on the other hand we see<br>like online uh news websites regular<br>users of those negative effect uh on<br>political trust Ashley you have already<br>made the point negativity biased all of<br>those click bats that always make all of<br>us angry that exaggerate um so you click<br>on the uh president walked over water uh<br>thing and something completely different<br>uh shows up then this is not like<br>enhancing your trust in political<br>parties um people who think uh that most<br>uh politicians or strongly agree with<br>the statement that politicians spread<br>fake news they have lower trust uh in um<br>political parties so here we are already<br>coming to a point that I want to make<br>today I will tell you that uh social<br>media is not the bad guy it is actually<br>disinformation uh on on the internet<br>that is the problem um High political<br>efficacy has a positive effect um uh on<br>political uh on trust in political<br>parties so efficacy is a term that<br>political scientists like to use for<br>people um believing that they can<br>influence politics and they have power<br>and they have a say um and you see if<br>people believe that that has a positive<br>effect uh on their trust in political<br>parties so it's upon parties to empower<br>people to think they can make a<br>difference your vote makes a difference<br>uh political engagement makes a<br>difference and those kind of things if<br>you have been contacted by a political<br>party through social media this has a<br>positive effect as well again my point<br>is social media is not the bad guy<br>actually parties can use it to their<br>advantage to connect uh with citizens so<br>if you have been contacted by a party<br>that actually has a positive effect on<br>your trust in parties um let's move on<br>to trust to a specific party does that<br>look different let's start with the<br>National Party um so don't worry I come<br>to the labor party next um so we see<br>this as well um we see actually um a<br>positive effect of trust in the National<br>Party um for TalkBack uh radio the same<br>effect we don't see for the lab party in<br>this case I can see tell you that there<br>is apparently a center right bias of<br>talk back radio towards the National<br>Party um but we see something that we<br>have seen before already uh use uh<br>regular use of high quality newspapers<br>has a positive effect so this seems to<br>be consistent it will also show up in<br>the labor party model um so um high<br>quality newspapers are a friend of trust<br>um if you have been uh following<br>um on the other hand the labor party on<br>social media this has a negative effect<br>on your trust in the National Party<br>surprise uh negative campaigning um uh<br>and of course also we have more labor<br>party uh supporters that are following<br>uh the labor party uh on social media um<br>on the other hand if you follow the<br>national party which I have not<br>encircled and should have um this if you<br>follow the national party this has a<br>positive effect which means they are<br>kind of doing a good job there um so if<br>you follow them this has a positive<br>effect uh on on your uh the probability<br>of trust in the National party so let's<br>look on the labor party on the other<br>hand there we have a negative effect of<br>TalkBack radio so which confirms the<br>bias hypothesis um but uh the use of<br>highquality newspapers again positive<br>effect following the labor party on<br>social media positive effect negative<br>effect following the national party uh<br>on social media um so negative cing in<br>um in this election um though we have<br>been told many times this was the most<br>negative election ever it wasn't<br>actually if you compare it to other<br>elections we we measured negative<br>campaigning on social media um so this<br>only has like a negative effect like<br>alienating people uh from politics if<br>there's overall more negative than<br>positive campaigning and if we look at<br>that at social media there was still<br>more positive campaigning from both<br>sides than negative campaigning so it<br>might affect the trust in the other<br>party but it does not alienate you from<br>politics so it's not as dramatic in New<br>Zealand<br>um so trust in social media finally um<br>so trust in social media is low uh in<br>New Zealand extremely low and I also<br>would not make a point to in general say<br>you should believe everything that you<br>see on the internet quite the opposite<br>is good when you are suspicious of some<br>things H and check two or three times<br>before you share something um however to<br>make my point if you think that uh you<br>have come across fake news uh online uh<br>sometimes or often this has a negative<br>effect on your trust in social media<br>whereas people who think that they<br>hardly ever come across fake news um<br>this has like a a positive effect so<br>again social media is not the bad guy<br>it's disinformation um so um to the<br>question how can uh trust be maintained<br>uh in the social media age of political<br>Comm uh campaigning because in this age<br>of political campaigning a lot of the<br>it's the fourth age of political<br>campaigning a lot of the political<br>communication goes via social media so<br>we have to care about um what the<br>quality of social media is um so how how<br>bad is it uh for New Zealand so these<br>are results from the New Zealand social<br>media study now um and I have uh started<br>measuring most of these variables<br>um during the 2020 election for the<br>first time where you see that all of<br>these like half truth fake news<br>full-fledged conspiracy theories if we<br>take half truth and fake news together<br>and call that Miss and disinformation<br>this is all still like uh pretty low<br>back then then I didn't had funding for<br>a while that is that's the Gap in the<br>data that's why you should always fund<br>us um and so just a very subtile<br>statement um so in February 2022 I had<br>funding again to run the study<br>permanently since and currently we have<br>cleaned up uh the data until October uh<br>2023 so you see like um since then with<br>the height of thisinformation was<br>actually in February 2022 because this<br>is the freedom Convoy protests in front<br>of Parliament and there was never more<br>dis misinformation out there than during<br>that time on social media but then it<br>actually drops during routine times of<br>politics uh again um and most of the<br>time we are not like over like 5%<br>of all posts uh on on Facebook of all<br>the parties and the party leaders that<br>we are studying in that sample sometimes<br>occasionally it Peaks and if we come to<br>election times um naturally of course<br>the dis misinformation increases as well<br>it also depends a little bit it's mostly<br>confined to small French parties and<br>they are come and go and so this also<br>affects the sample of course uh if<br>there's like a party like um Advanced<br>New Zealand the New Zealand Public party<br>shuts down misinformation goes down uh<br>and of course this is reflected uh in in<br>the data but um the the uh while New<br>Zealand truly is not a post truth<br>Society like the us or India are these<br>days um and the major parties um still<br>stay away from spreading too much<br>disinformation so this seems to be an<br>outspoken consensus we see some Hal<br>truth from them so like bending the<br>truth but this has been existing all of<br>all times but I think the the um so<br>there is a lot of good news in here for<br>New Zealand the not so good thing is<br>that all of my points at the end are<br>basically um higher than they were in<br>2020 so this is also increasing uh for<br>New Zealand um in a in a certain way in<br>particular we have seen in the last<br>election half truth among the um also<br>major parties uh and the Parliamentary<br>parties uh in greasing and a half true<br>is probably um it's not like a fully<br>made up an intentionally and verifiably<br>false story but it is something where<br>you slightly bent the truth um let's say<br>to give you an example um one of my<br>favorite examples is like a survey that<br>one of the big parties ran and they had<br>a slight lead in who um new zealanders<br>trust with the economic recovery um of<br>the country postco but just slightly<br>like two to three percentage points but<br>the graph was like like half as high for<br>one of the parties than for the other<br>and this is like a misleading in a very<br>intentional way when the graph is like<br>half as as high and so this is what we<br>code as a half truth because it would be<br>exaggerated to call call it full-fledged<br>fake news but you also don't want to<br>miss out of that stuff and these kind of<br>half truths we have seen increasing in a<br>2023 election compared to the 2020<br>election what we don't know if this is a<br>sign like a first step into the Waters<br>of uh full-fledged fake news and if the<br>parties go there or not H this is<br>something uh we cannot uh predict it<br>could be or it couldn't so it my<br>conclusion if political trust in New<br>Zealand can be kept on high levels<br>depends on politicians and political<br>parties committing themselves to high<br>standards of political communication and<br>upholding the principles of a fair and<br>honest Democratic discourse um that we<br>have mostly seen in this country so far<br>it depends on how social media is used<br>which is probably not going anywhere<br>anytime soon um social media is not<br>necessarily the bad guy a commitment and<br>consensus among the Democratic parties<br>not to use disinformation as political<br>communication strategy and to refrain<br>from too much negative campaigning is<br>necessary um and uh so I this is<br>tempting for parties um actually uh<br>disinformation spreads quicker gets more<br>likes gets picked up by the traditional<br>media more so there is a lot of<br>incentive to do that but it's very<br>shortsighted because in the long run<br>this will erode the trust in political<br>institutions this is something that the<br>Democratic parliamentary parties need to<br>keep in mind a healthy media System<br>including including high quality<br>newspapers we have seen the positive<br>effects of high quality newspapers here<br>and strong broadcasters so the current<br>dismantling of the media system that we<br>see in New Zealand is not helpful it is<br>also a little bit like interesting that<br>I did not find any kind of big positive<br>effects um uh like for broadcasters<br>because in a lot of countries we have<br>seen Public Service broadcasting has a<br>positive effect on political trust um so<br>there is room to grow I think um and the<br>healthy media system plays a big role<br>finally parties and politicians engaging<br>with citizens and commuting a feeling of<br>empowerment is very important so<br>encouraging political efficacy so that<br>you have the feeling that you can change<br>something when you participate also um<br>democracies are dependent on political<br>participation um so I think this is the<br>last Point uh I want to make and that's<br>it from my side for the moment we now<br>panel all right so we move on to the<br>panel uh discussion now and I have the<br>honor to share that one I will skip<br>Ashley and me for the introduction<br>because Margaret has nicely done that<br>already but we are fortunate to have<br>some other panel members joining us here<br>as well um and I start with Annie um who<br>is uh like the second one from the uh<br>this is from the right from my side yes<br>um and so Annie is a lecturer in teava<br>amoi and her research focuses mostly uh<br>on Eevee and local government<br>relationships and we are in particular<br>Keen to hear from her today um how<br>engagement with communities uh also has<br>an effect on political trust uh in New<br>Zealand um H then we are very lucky um<br>that Rebecca krid who is sitting right<br>uh next to Annie um is joining us today<br>so Rebecca is the Deputy Public Service<br>commissioner um and so she can tell us a<br>lot about uh the public service and how<br>you are taking care of um um ensuring<br>that we have trust in institutions and<br>the public service uh in New Zealand and<br>finally we have uh Colin peacock um so<br>who has uh just reminded me that we had<br>a media watch uh in the past together<br>already because of that Media Watch I<br>had to buy all of my codess who work<br>with me in the New Zealand social media<br>study and without whom this wouldn't be<br>possible had to buy pizza because I<br>promised it on his show for their work<br>um but yeah so his Media Watch uh show<br>is very well known I guess on Radio New<br>Zealand um let me start uh with Annie um<br>and and a question uh for uh you um so<br>um so how actually important is it um<br>that uh we involve communities uh in<br>decision uh making process for building<br>trust uh in government and so what are<br>the the pros and cons what where do the<br>um thank you very much um for the<br>question and for everyone in attendance<br>today um I mean the the obvious first<br>answer to the question of whether or not<br>Community engagement is important is of<br>course yes but then the the flow on for<br>that from that is uh well how does that<br>happen and who is involved in that and<br>who are the communities of Interest so<br>what we're talking about here is<br>contextualizing and um identifying the<br>communities and how those um how their<br>engagement and how their interests might<br>differ both in what they believe but<br>also in how that engagement happens um<br>and so I've been asked here in with my<br>sort of um uh molitics haton and so the<br>community of interest that I'll be<br>talking about is of course mildy<br>communities and it was interesting to<br>see on the slides and some of the<br>findings you've heard from both of your<br>studies um whether or not those same<br>fightings would be true should you look<br>at M communities in particular should<br>you look at um the trust of mildy<br>communities in certain governing<br>institutions within e institutions<br>within rang and so forth whether or not<br>those those levels would shift whether<br>or not those public expressions of how<br>we relate between people and Leadership<br>might differ um within that so um you<br>know maybe a next part of the the the<br>research but um y I kind of had three<br>three points to to think uh to think<br>about and and the first was that uh<br>trust in it in itself should be mutual<br>and reciprocal uh that it doesn't happen<br>if we're just focusing on the trust in<br>leadership it has to go go both ways and<br>so without uh taking us on a a massive<br>historical journey of of Al um within Al<br>this means the treaty relationship when<br>we're talking about Mali this means what<br>do that relationship looked like how was<br>it developed manifested and then been<br>maintained throughout history because we<br>know at that initial phase of signing<br>the Treaty of Wang in 1840 there were<br>high levels of trust it wouldn't have<br>been signed if Mali weren't trusting<br>this group of people who were coming<br>into Alor that there would be respect on<br>both sides well we then know that post<br>the signing trust levels declined and<br>there are no surveys to tell us this but<br>there are multiple uh uh opportunities<br>to see how this has happened and the<br>crown has knowledge these the fact that<br>we have a treaty settlements process a<br>treaty settlements process that is aimed<br>at addressing the acts the emissions the<br>breaches of the treaty tells us that<br>there has been numerous breaches and<br>trust between this initial relationship<br>and so that gives us this indication<br>that if we are to maintain a trust<br>between communities and institutions<br>that it is hard work that it has to be<br>worked in and those initial uh<br>agreements that are made have to both be<br>maintained but also uh developed and<br>shifted and changed with how Society<br>changes the idea of it being a living<br>document if you<br>will um we can then bring that forward<br>to today so these are s sort of the<br>history of t or whitei but in the last<br>you know six months or so we've seen the<br>wangi tribunal produce rapid urgent<br>inquiry reports around potential<br>breaches of the Treaty of wangi uh and<br>without kind of delving into the the<br>weeds of what all those reports say one<br>of the consistent them that have come<br>out so we're talking about the 7aa<br>report the mildy wards report um the<br>very recent treaty principles Bill<br>report consistently the Whitey head<br>tribunal has told us that the process<br>the relationship between Mali and the<br>crown has been breached irrespective of<br>the actual proposed breach in terms of<br>those legislative changes actually the<br>relationship between Mali and the crown<br>has been questioned because M weren't a<br>part of creating these or developing the<br>the incentive for these policy changes<br>this very recent treaty brill's<br>principle one of the core findings of<br>the white Tangy tribunal is that they<br>said there was no policy incentive no<br>evidence policy incentive for this to<br>come forward and again without wanting<br>to delve into what that that bill is it<br>tells us that there is some breach of<br>trust whether or not you agree with it<br>um there is there is evidence to say<br>that trust has been an issue when it<br>comes to this space a continuous<br>contemporary<br>issue uh the next point I wanted to make<br>that is that trust as a value doesn't<br>sit in isolation um and so when I was<br>considering what Trust might mean within<br>uh T Mali and thinking about it as poror<br>as truth we never talk about poro as<br>just being the only thing we aspire to<br>do porno and Tika always come Hand in<br>Hand p so sort of trust and Justice um<br>but also a whole plethora of other<br>values um that inform why we trust<br>something and how we trust something and<br>so we have a very clear example in the<br>last couple of weeks um the death of the<br>king to haa where we saw thousands and<br>thousands of people uh to stand upon t m<br>to go to the Ken Tanga to show their<br>support and that is essentially because<br>they trust the institution that the<br>kingy Tonga is and that isn't to suggest<br>that there are not debates within that<br>that isn't to suggest that everyone has<br>the same views on leadership and<br>government governance but it says that<br>this institution of the K Tonga since<br>1858 has asow values that Mali have<br>continued to agree with they can<br>recognize themselves within what the<br>king Tonga stands for as a governing<br>structure as a key political structure<br>within<br>ala<br>um again and then sort of the final<br>point that I wanted to make is that uh<br>trust can be manifested if the outcomes<br>reflect the community um and so one<br>another great example we have around the<br>maldi community was the development of<br>the maay report which was a or is a<br>constitutional vision for what Al out<br>door can be where everyone is involved<br>where those issues of mistrust that have<br>manifested that have been addressed to<br>some extent and then pulled back at<br>different times might be developed<br>within uh reimagining what a<br>constitutional framework might look like<br>what a value system might look like when<br>something like Trust is actually the<br>center of<br>this um and so you wanted me to talk<br>about the risks and risks and benefits<br>the pros and cons um I think um I kind<br>of shifted that language in my head as<br>sort of the challenges and and<br>opportunities here um but what I think<br>is really important and what we we have<br>an opportunity here to do is that um we<br>have to understand the trust between<br>communities and leaderships as being<br>reciprocal as being um both earned but<br>also necessarily maintained by both<br>parties um and that this is kind of what<br>at the core of it where there have been<br>issues of mistrust it's when there's not<br>that mutual respect there are those core<br>principles those core treaty principles<br>which are well researched around active<br>protection around the recognition of RA<br>and so forth which aren't being uphold<br>upheld um and so we have opportunities<br>of trust as the lens to think about how<br>communities that we are all involved in<br>uh might feed into political leadership<br>in different Dynamic um durable ways um<br>uh with the sort of visions of Al or<br>that we might all have um and so I will<br>leave it at that thank you Annie and by<br>the way you're absolutely right if we<br>break those results down for for Mari<br>communities the trust is lower we also<br>see them attacked more by disinformation<br>uh my D um data shows that as well um<br>Colin you guessed it I come to you for<br>the media<br>and so what what role does the the media<br>play in in influencing um uh levels of<br>trust uh in New Zealand and also is<br>there anything we can change to ensure<br>that this is happening okay yeah two<br>very good questions two very different<br>questions in a way um so I've been a<br>massive nerd and written a load of notes<br>here but I'll just try and Scoot through<br>them uh and if you want to pick up any<br>uh points of that in the questions I'll<br>be happy to answer that but first of all<br>just might seem very basic um but the<br>media news Med in their day-to-day job<br>just inform people about what public<br>institutions do and what their role is<br>um institutions of scale or spend money<br>and are obliged to track the public<br>awareness of what they do commission<br>surveys on this and are often shocked<br>and disappointed by the results that<br>people don't understand what their<br>services are I know for a fact that<br>happens at Radio New Zealand where I<br>work um and I'm sure that's a broad<br>thing as well happens elsewhere so<br>beyond that then the news media expose<br>to the public what those institutions do<br>do perhaps what they fail to do the<br>Public's eyes and ears in that the next<br>level up uh the accountability for that<br>so public agencies are they doing their<br>jobs uh if not where does the buck stop<br>who's responsible for that when things<br>go wrong and indeed have things gone<br>wrong often there are claims made about<br>things going wrong highly contested uh<br>claims and counter claims being made and<br>the media are pretty good um at doing<br>this in a way that other sorts of media<br>like social media uh so much more<br>effective than just spraying allegations<br>around on social media and trying to get<br>people to comment on them so media are<br>good at using the official Information<br>Act you know going all the way to the<br>Ombudsman if you have to having a a long<br>time frame following up these things<br>being persistent uh also applying uh<br>things like anonymity um where it's<br>necessary and judiciously doing that um<br>understanding about protector<br>disclosures and whistleblowers things<br>like that so those are things that good<br>media organizations and good journalists<br>can do when they've got um you know the<br>resources and the scope to do it um so<br>then you could also flip this around a<br>bit and say the media can also have a<br>role in influencing levels of trust in<br>scrutinizing other people's attempts<br>perhaps people with the genders uh to<br>undermine or challenge uh people's level<br>of trust and competence of public<br>institutions I'm thinking for example of<br>you know campaigns that might be led by<br>Lobby groups where that might might not<br>be understood by people if the news<br>media expose it they might understand<br>that there are agendas and pressures<br>behind that um thinking for example at a<br>big scale on things like uh campaigns<br>for the funding of certain medicines and<br>what pharmac should and shouldn't do and<br>who should be calling the shots on what<br>farac does um is that a big deal can be<br>um and then even just a recent example<br>the newsletters or pamphlets delivered<br>around Wellington about the city council<br>from a group called better Wellington a<br>lot of uh well some misinformation in in<br>those newsletters and once it was<br>explained to people who do engage with<br>news media um who interrogated where<br>those were coming from who was behind<br>them then that's something that I mean<br>you could say it undermines a bit of<br>trust in institutions because of the uh<br>the amplification of those allegations<br>and the existence of that pressure but<br>knowing full of facts behind uh what<br>goes on there that probably in in the<br>long run is a good thing for trust um<br>and then also for influencing levels of<br>trust the media themselves should<br>promote the message about themselves<br>that that's the way they work they're<br>accountable to Regulators um different<br>kinds of regulators in different ways<br>self-regulation or the broadcasting<br>stands Authority backed by by law um but<br>still they're accountable to Regulators<br>in a way that a lot of commentary isn't<br>online and social media for example and<br>also that the media can demonstrate that<br>they you know police themselves and will<br>report to some extent on their own<br>shortcomings or often it's more like the<br>shortcomings of other media<br>organizations but anyway they do a bit<br>of that so the second part of the<br>question then um if that's the role and<br>that's what media can do to influence or<br>uphold the level of trust uh what needs<br>to change to ensure that happens so I<br>broke broke that down into two parts the<br>first thing is basically just its<br>sustainability and that means<br>guaranteeing that journalism can survive<br>um and that means sources of revenue for<br>commercial broadcasters uh who are in a<br>very difficult uh kind of digital<br>economy right now for for a lot of<br>reasons it's difficult for them to hold<br>on to their revenue um and then on the<br>public side that there is a kind of<br>consensus no matter who's in charge of<br>the state um that uh there is a<br>commitment to funding um both public<br>media organizations such as the one I<br>work for rnz and also that there is I<br>don't think people quite understand how<br>much public money it's between I think<br>it's around about $270 million a year<br>now goes into media content uh from from<br>taxes via things like New Zealand on air<br>funding of other things so if there's a<br>consensus that that can continue that is<br>uh some sort of guarantee that that role<br>the media plays can go on then there's<br>another thing is we have very out ofd<br>media regulation system as I've<br>mentioned different Regulators for<br>different media hardly any regulation<br>it's 30 years old it's out of date uh<br>and there's very very very little will<br>uh politically to do anything about that<br>possibly for Fears of you know having<br>debates about free speech and censorship<br>and all that sort of stuff but that's a<br>whole story of its own so then below<br>that just nuts and bolts things the<br>media can do uh to make sure they can<br>keep uh fulfilling their role in in<br>building trust first thing measuring<br>trust in themselves a bit better than<br>has been done some of the surveys like<br>the Edelman survey that we've heard<br>about blunt instruments really in terms<br>of what people trust um people's use of<br>media when you interrogate that that's<br>more interesting and find out what they<br>trust and don't and Dr Bloomfield had uh<br>pointed to some examples where when you<br>ask that question you get different<br>results for different kinds of media uh<br>also<br>um I think uh when you ask what people<br>value rather than what they trust I<br>think you get different results there<br>the media also very bad in New Zealand<br>and they know this that they don't<br>represent their own Mutual interests<br>very well<br>um the director general of the ABC in<br>Australia was here recently talking<br>about all the forums they have the<br>Walkley Institute and Press Club all the<br>stuff we kind of don't have that in fact<br>um a couple of your colleagues at<br>Oakland University uh s Gman Gavin Ellis<br>they have hosted forums through the K2<br>Center for informed Futures and I've<br>attended a couple of those and those are<br>the only times I think some of those<br>editors and Executives get together<br>anymore um so that's a bit of a shame<br>and they need to do better at things<br>like submitting on legislation that<br>where the public interest has to be<br>served uh about things like protected<br>disclosures um it's very hit and miss<br>where the media has input on those<br>things um and then um there's also a<br>general problem that news if we're<br>talking specifically and the media isn't<br>all about news but news has become a bit<br>depowered within media organization so<br>if you take the example of that<br>controversy over the New Zealand Herald<br>running a Hobson's pledge advertisement<br>on the front page I mean whether you<br>think it was a right or wrong decision<br>as far as we know that decision was made<br>you know not probably against the<br>recommendations and and the objections<br>or or concerns of news editors um the<br>decisions made higher up because it's<br>about revenue and I think news is not<br>really at executive level at some of the<br>media companies anymore um so that's a<br>bit of a problem and then yeah finally<br>we've got AI all of that stuff uh coming<br>up people do want to know I think where<br>it's being used and we're going to see<br>instances of that where it really has<br>the potential to um make people wonder<br>quite what journalism is being produced<br>by when and under what circumstances<br>that's something I think our media have<br>to catch up with um very quickly uh in<br>order to um to to boost trust uh so yeah<br>I think the other thing they can do just<br>finally is just pointing to that problem<br>that's been raised by both our speakers<br>earlier about social media the<br>reliability of it people know it's less<br>reliable they do know they're blending<br>their use of it they're reading that<br>even if they're using mainstream or<br>Legacy sort of media sources as well um<br>but if the media can even put pressure<br>on social media to point out that these<br>companies really don't enforce their own<br>terms and conditions of use they allow<br>most egregious abuses of of trust and<br>you know scam ads involving you know the<br>Prime Minister you know just think if<br>mainstream media did that um you know<br>the amount of money and lawy they'd have<br>to engage to get out of that and<br>inquiries they'd have to hold and uh the<br>process they'd have to go through so<br>that's completely unbalanced so um I<br>think those are things that if the<br>public understood it better and that<br>media played a bigger role in that would<br>help build trust in institutions in the<br>end thanks for listening to my TED Talk<br>and if you have any questions later go<br>any of that yeah thanks for reminding us<br>also of the Watchdog role of the media<br>which of course is very important the<br>media is seen as the fourth estate by<br>political communication Scholars you<br>usually um so they also have to be make<br>sure as you reminded us to there's a<br>healthy level of mistrust in political<br>institutions too we need to hold them<br>accountable at an election and you guys<br>are making sure that we do that um but<br>let's move on to Rebecca and let's talk<br>accountability um so what actually what<br>actions does the public service uh<br>commission uh take uh to help to build<br>maintain trust uh uh in New Zealand um<br>and how much is this a focus of your<br>work<br>dinoto um so really interesting for me<br>reflecting on what's been said already<br>and um and for me I came uh in a couple<br>of the<br>key uh roles that I've had well in fact<br>throughout my entire Public Service<br>career trust and confidence and<br>integrity has been just a massive<br>massive driver um and and a huge Focus<br>so I went from the very um the very<br>trusted cabinet office where you provide<br>your trusted advisors you know um to<br>minister is to being the director<br>general of security where um there was a<br>lot of negativity towards the the nzis<br>and we especially got it from the media<br>was um uh a lot of um either fumbling<br>incompetent I'm not looking at you not<br>looking at you actually I love Media<br>Watch absolutely love it um uh or or you<br>know a kind of you know uh you know Bond<br>spies type of um stereotypes and so<br>really there was an enormous effort made<br>to make<br>the work of the service more transparent<br>and to and to explain its value and to<br>be much much more open with the public<br>and with the media and it was pretty<br>difficult at times and we you know we<br>certainly made some mistakes along the<br>way but that process of increasing<br>transparency accountability much<br>stronger oversight um so really strong<br>oversight from the Inspector General of<br>intelligence and security um and and I<br>mean I even went on talk back radio um<br>in order to explain the work of the<br>service to ordinary new zealanders who<br>were ringing in and asking questions and<br>so there's there's something and and by<br>the end of the time there there was I<br>think a greater appreciation of the sort<br>of work that's going on the fact that<br>you need to have this kind of<br>organization and that it with proper<br>oversight it all does the right thing<br>and then coming into the Public Service<br>Commission it's been really really<br>interesting for me seeing I mean I knew<br>this already because all Chief<br>Executives deal with the Public Service<br>Commission and we're part of the public<br>service leadership team so there's a big<br>culture among those Chief Executives<br>about<br>um you know um the we discussed these<br>issues a lot amongst ourselves as um as<br>Ashley would know<br>um so the Public Service Commission<br>measures trust in the public service on<br>a quarterly basis through a survey<br>that's called kiwi's count and it's<br>interesting because it is different from<br>the Adelman results um and uh and and I<br>think and the reason uh is that it's got<br>a different Focus it's got a it's a<br>subset it's it is trust in the public<br>service um the Adelman is I think that's<br>phrased as government leaders and so it<br>has got a different focus and I think it<br>includes politicians and it includes<br>local government um I wish to just um at<br>this point uh put in a good word for<br>politicians who I know you know they<br>they always do badly on trust certainly<br>the ministers that I've worked for over<br>a number of years have been incredibly<br>hardworking and um dedicated uh but<br>anyway we we know that there is a<br>perception um out there um so the<br>interestingly in terms of the kiwis<br>count um<br>results what uh what people what those<br>results show is that in terms of uh when<br>people are talking about the a recent<br>experience they had with the public<br>service if they asked about was that<br>something you know was that a an um uh<br>you know would they do they have trust<br>based on that experience it's about 80%<br>positive um and if you're talking<br>generally about you know whether you<br>have trust in the public service it's<br>about 70% over time um it has been going<br>up over time it had a big spike um<br>during Co and thank you very much Ashley<br>because I think the fact that you stood<br>up there day after day because a lot of<br>this is about just standing up and being<br>um answerable and accountable to the<br>questions and when things go well you<br>can say that but when things don't go<br>well you have to front up to that um you<br>have to say a mistake has happened you<br>know um and we have to own it um but but<br>and it's gone down from there but it's<br>still it's still interestingly above<br>where it was um before covid in terms of<br>trust in the public service that doesn't<br>mean it's Universal um you can see<br>there's a heck of a lot of concern at<br>the moment about education and health<br>and so if you ask about those specific<br>Services you get you get a different qu<br>you know answer um for qu for a while we<br>were wondering whether there was new<br>zealanders were just more trusting<br>generally um the O some done some<br>research recently that shows that uh new<br>zealanders are not more trusting than<br>other people we're about average so it<br>isn't that that's uh that conjecture was<br>shown not to be the case interestingly<br>also New Zealand is unusual in that we<br>have a much more ethnically diverse<br>population and usually where High trust<br>is shown it's in countries that have<br>less ethnically diverse populations um<br>and I think it's a real credit to um how<br>we have proceeded as a nation which is<br>not to say that everything is is perfect<br>by any means but it's something that's<br>going to be really important for us as a<br>very diverse uh country to continue with<br>in the Public Service Commission we see<br>uh public trust as being an outcome of<br>the work um<br>and it it is an incredibly important<br>outcome in its own right and you get it<br>from doing the work right from doing the<br>right work um and from every day having<br>public servants across the country who<br>um who front up in their engagements<br>with members of the public in a way that<br>is<br>competent empathetic um and and um<br>efficient effective and and gives the<br>services that new zealanders have the<br>right to<br>expect the three um areas of work I just<br>wanted to sort of Chunk it down about um<br>how we approach<br>um trust and confidence um there are<br>sort of three areas that i' just like to<br>focus on uh that the Public Service<br>Commission is very actively involved in<br>um the first first of them is that there<br>is a sort of formal sense of providing<br>guidance and minimum standards in terms<br>of ethics and uh uh accountability and<br>uh and transparency and so there are<br>standards and guidance on Integrity<br>Public Service principles there's<br>guidance on conflicts of interest we<br>provide a lot of support across the<br>public service uh ahead of Elections to<br>ensure that public servants behave in a<br>politically neutral way um we have a lot<br>of guidance you know uh very clear uh uh<br>guidance on um to prevent bribery and<br>Corruption we we provide um uh<br>transparency in terms of Public Service<br>responses to the official Information<br>Act how how responsive they are whether<br>they're complying with the ACT uh we<br>have an Integrity Champion Network that<br>we lead throughout the whole of the<br>public service all public service uh<br>agencies have a public service<br>Champion um the Public Service<br>Commission uh conducts investigations<br>and reviews where it has to we<br>administer the protected disclosures<br>that's the The Whistleblower legislation<br>so there's all of that kind of the hard<br>levers and guidance that's out there um<br>to agencies but as well as that there's<br>the kind of soft levers about um the<br>fact that culture is actually the most<br>important thing of all and as I said the<br>public service leadership team gets<br>together regularly um every two weeks<br>and also has Retreats together where we<br>we tell literally tell chief executive<br>stories about things that have gone<br>wrong or um areas where we've had to<br>front up and be accountable and there is<br>a very very well-known phrase of own it<br>fix it learn from it and I think when<br>Peter Hughes left we all had t-sh you<br>know there was privately paid for um<br>t-shirts made that said own it fix it<br>learn from it that we all wore when he<br>when he left because it was such a such<br>an important message for us so that's<br>the kind of that's the kind of first<br>area<br>um secondly I do want to come back to<br>this point that um<br>that people<br>trust<br>competence uh kind kindness um uh a<br>human encounter with a public servant<br>that they that they feel heard that they<br>feel that they got the service that they<br>wanted so just getting really good<br>Frontline Services is a hugely important<br>part of why new zealanders trust uh the<br>public service and as I said when based<br>on the uh experience that people had of<br>their last encounter with with an actual<br>public servant or an actual Public<br>Service um it was higher than their<br>perception generally about the about the<br>public service<br>and so so there's a really big effort<br>going on about just satisfying um what<br>people's expectations are for the<br>services that they get lastly I want to<br>talk about the importance of diversity<br>and inclusion um and ensuring that the<br>uh the workforce that we have reflects<br>the diversity of New Zealand as a<br>country and uh so there's been a really<br>big push over um for a number of years<br>now and it's uh and it's a requirement<br>and the legislation for for the public<br>service as employers to really work<br>actively to ensure that our Workforce<br>reflects the community that we serve and<br>there has been a really significant<br>change in the the kind of shape of that<br>Workforce as a result um there is a<br>specific legislated requirement to be to<br>um build uh competence and capability in<br>terms of T Mali um and to ensure that we<br>have workforces that are able to um uh<br>to<br>uh work in that world and to meet the<br>expectations of maldi as well and I do<br>think these are incredibly important<br>drivers of trust and confidence those<br>are expectations that are in Chief<br>Executives um you know that are<br>requirements for them um and it is<br>monitored and uh and uh you know they<br>have an accountability to the Public<br>Service<br>Commission so those are my that is my<br>story thank you Rebecca I directly have<br>over to Ashley I got his permission to<br>skip the last question to him and give<br>him like the chance for a final comment<br>before we hand over to Stuart who's<br>waiting online thanks m i mean great<br>insights from the panelists a quick<br>comment on what we learned about trust<br>through the co9 pandemic during the<br>first lockdown and particularly through<br>2020 the public was being surveyed every<br>week about their trust in the<br>government's response and week in week<br>out it was over 90% of people which<br>clearly transcended<br>political uh<br>affiliations um ethnicity differences<br>and so on and if you dig down and find<br>out and and I've thought about what was<br>it and it was the fronting up Rebecca<br>hinted at this trustworthiness is got<br>three components competence reliability<br>and honesty and it's okay as Rebecca<br>said to front up and say we don't know<br>in fact that builds trust it doesn't<br>undermine it or we got it wrong and be<br>accountable for that and one of the<br>challenges is we don't create any space<br>for our politicians to do that because<br>the next morning when they get<br>interviewed by Mike hosking at 5 to 7<br>like I did 25 times the first question<br>is when are you going to<br>resign and I got that three times from<br>Mike so uh the the point here is that<br>being honest being transparent is<br>actually not something politicians<br>should fear and actually we as a country<br>as Citizens and our media need to create<br>more opportunity for and space for<br>politicians to be honest<br>uh this is the first in uh some work we<br>intend to carry on with and we will<br>email you about what the next steps are<br>and we may even invite you to give your<br>thoughts and we' certainly welcome<br>feedback on today's seminar uh and so<br>with that I've spoken enough and I'd<br>love to hand over hopefully we can beam<br>Stewart uh in from the University of<br>ockland for some closing comments and<br>then is Margaret closing us or is it no<br>it's Stuart so Stuart over to you and uh<br>well I hope you can hear me not<br>brilliant now it might have been a<br>mistake inviting me to have the final<br>comments you see I'm a developmental<br>psychologist and an educational<br>psychologist so I I want to fill a gap<br>which I perceive which is to do with the<br>educational response to what we're<br>talking about and I I won't belay with<br>the point other than just other than to<br>say I'm I'm really hardened by the data<br>that suggests teachers are are trusted<br>uh highly actually in terms in terms of<br>the relative standings and I'm curious<br>and this is almost an analytic Point<br>actually relating to next steps uh what<br>is it about teachers their roles and uh<br>their characteristics and what is the<br>implication for the way in which we<br>might select uh and also train our<br>teachers uh given given that high Trust<br>environment uh another another comment<br>which does flow from what you've all<br>said which is again a reflection an<br>educational reflection is how do we<br>develop the<br>skills that uh might be required to be<br>able to engage in a trustworthy trusting<br>way with each other and I just make a<br>point Ashley your your comment about the<br>relationship between trust and social<br>cohesion is true on a school level so if<br>you take the unit of analysis of a<br>school it matters greatly whether or not<br>um you can engender trust between the<br>citizens and and a school uh and their<br>social cohesion and some schools do that<br>better way better than others and we can<br>learn a lot from what those schools<br>do uh a comment about the skills<br>themselves I don't want to lose uh the<br>point that there are both cognitive<br>skills that we need to enhance as well<br>as social emotional skills that we need<br>to enhance if we are if we are to engage<br>in a collective response to um to the<br>challenges that you've all outlined in<br>terms of developing trust and making<br>sure there's trust I'm curious in terms<br>of the service just by the way uh what<br>the age breakdowns or the or the cohort<br>or generational breakdowns might suggest<br>about so to go beyond the time series<br>data to ask the question about what's<br>happening generationally around<br>uh the patterns of trust and uh who we<br>trust and how we trust and perhaps the<br>last comment really uh so that we can<br>get on with what I see in the run sheet<br>is networking or uh talking to each<br>other perhaps is is a comment about the<br>research side of this how I know in in<br>my field educational sciences and the<br>sorts of f cry we might have which is to<br>do as I say with uh an educational<br>response there's precious little funding<br>um and I know this sounds self- serving<br>so that's my epia ahead of time but<br>there's precious little funding for<br>asking the hard questions about how we<br>might actually in a research and<br>development sequence uh come up with the<br>ways in which an educational response<br>could develop the skills that are<br>required I note here just asn't the side<br>that one of the recommendations in the<br>in the um in the uh the review the the<br>recommendations to do with the terrorist<br>attack the um the report is specifically<br>about the educational response and how<br>education has a responsibility to be<br>able to develop the sorts of social<br>cohesion uh and Trust relationships that<br>you've been talking about so it just it<br>just um leaves me to say thanks to you<br>all for a most engaging and and St<br>ulating conversation uh Ashley thank you<br>for alerting us to the fact that this is<br>only the beginning in a sense of of a<br>project and uh let me ask and make a<br>plea<br>for people such as myself educators are<br>being involved um those who are not<br>perhaps seem to be directly um involved<br>at a at a governmental or institutional<br>level but in fact might have<br>responsibility ities for children uh to<br>be engaged and contribute to your work<br>so thank you um each of you Mona Annie<br>Ashley Colin Rebecca um it's been a a<br>delightful and as I say very<br>enlightening and a stimulating<br>conversation all right thank you all<br>very much I hand over to Ashley to say<br>all good then you are all released and I<br>have the honor to close that<br>than</p></main><footer style="margin-top: 2rem; background: #0001; padding: 2rem; text-align: center;"><p>We Are The University</p><ul style="list-style-type: none; padding: 0; margin:
