For Professor Maren Wellenreuther, one of her most vivid memories is walking through the forest with her father, whose deep love for the natural world sparked her own curiosity. Always encouraged by her parents to ask critical questions, that inquisitive nature has stayed with her, shaping every facet of her life. In this talk, Maren shares stories from her research on flies and fish as part of a broader endeavour to capture and understand the rich diversity of life on Earth.</p><h2>Transcript</h2><p

really<br>auspicious<br>occasion plant and food research<br>put uh it's lovely to have people here<br>today from plant and food research in uh<br>in Oakland but also we've got people<br>from fakat two from Nelson where are our<br>Nelson people today it's thank you so<br>much for coming it's just a marvelous<br>occasion to be able to celebrate uh<br>Martin's success in this way and it's<br>uh my name is Jr and I'm theut Dean in<br>the faculty of Science and I can say<br>that today because it's the it's the<br>first day of our new Dean last month I<br>was the acting Dean and it's lovely to<br>go back to being the deputy Dean one of<br>the greatest things the greatest<br>pleasures of being uh a deputy Dean or a<br>Dean is that you get to introduce<br>inaugural professorial lectures and they<br>are such a trick because getting to be a<br>professor is the absolute Hallmark of an<br>academic career and it is an incredible<br>test<br>to um to what you have achieved Marin<br>that um The Faculty of science was able<br>to support your your application for<br>promotion and the University of ockland<br>recognized your achievements and and<br>here you are as as a professor um tenot<br>tenot tenot Couture it's just so lovely<br>to have everybody here uh making this<br>room warm now it's my custom in<br>introducing an augural lectures just to<br>shine a light on a few of the things<br>that I think make um make our professors<br>outstanding and and um Martin I just<br>want to hone in on the fact that you are<br>one of our joint Graduate School uh um<br>professors now on a on a part-time<br>position at the University of Oakland<br>generally based in Nelson in plant and<br>food research and um it's incredibly<br>difficult from these roles to actually<br>get promoted to be Professor so I think<br>there's an extra extra<br>um moment of celebration in here to<br>congratulate you on that because it is a<br>very very challenging thing because uh<br>you don't get to have all the time and<br>lares that the rest of us have in the<br>University sector to be able to meet all<br>of the academic standards and the fact<br>that you've done that is absolutely<br>fabulous so I just want to hone in on a<br>few things and I'm going to start with<br>the teaching because as a joint graduate<br>um School uh uh academic uh one of the<br>key aspects in that role is the super<br>vision of students and to bring students<br>through the university and to uh share<br>what the crown Research Institute can<br>offer and all that you bring to that<br>environment and in your time with us<br>you've graduated now 11 PhD students<br>possibly more since your application<br>went in six Master students seven honors<br>to completion and you've also supervised<br>another nine posts which is an<br>incredible<br>contribution to our research community<br>and to society um you've had large<br>numbers of students and interns and<br>particular you've had a particular focus<br>on Mii and Pacific island students as<br>well you've been mentoring people<br>through into the science sector and uh<br>as I said that is an enormous<br>contribution to society you don't have<br>to do taught classes necessarily as a as<br>a crown research person coming into a<br>joint graduate school and you have overd<br>delivered um Alan I didn't really mean<br>that because we really love what you're<br>doing in that delivery but you have<br>delivered exceptionally in terms of your<br>contributions to the taught curriculum<br>in the school of biological sciences and<br>we are very grateful for the impact that<br>you have had uh in terms of<br>scaffolding scaffolding the evolution<br>education through particularly that<br>undergraduate<br>curriculum aside from the teaching side<br>of things Martin you're an absolutely<br>outstanding researcher you had at the<br>time of your uh promotion application<br>106 Publications with outputs in<br>worldclass uh venue news including<br>nature Communications in your field over<br>3 and a half thousand citations you are<br>a lorded academic uh researcher with a<br>therof Fisher Scientific award for<br>excellence in 2020 the Royal Society to<br>arari Hamilton award 2018 science New<br>Zealand early career researcher award in<br>2017 and the award that I was the most<br>intrigued by the KVA King King King<br>Charles King car sorry the 16th Gustav's<br>personal award from the king in 2013<br>which sounds absolutely exciting not<br>only that in terms of metrics your<br>granting success is unbelievable you've<br>had over close to $25 million secured in<br>funding over 38 grants um Pi on 33 of<br>these prestigious grants from Marsden to<br>MB Swedish research Council European<br>commission um you're a star in the<br>research space and we are very fortunate<br>that you have formed a very strong<br>relationship ship with the University of<br>Auckland you're also a wonderful mentor<br>and we really appreciate all of that<br>mentorship work you do with our students<br>and our staff and as befitting of a<br>professor you are a marvelous Citizen<br>and leader in this University you have<br>uh an international reputation via your<br>editorships your network of<br>organizations that you belong to<br>National responsibilities and co-<br>cheering for example the PBF panel for<br>biological sciences you're a group<br>leader in your own institution and have<br>been for some time at plant and food and<br>you locally uh contribute into things<br>like the school of biological sciences<br>maren Club an allr amazing citizen<br>fabulous researcher and wonderful<br>contributor to Academia and you<br>thoroughly deserve your promotion to<br>Professor please join me in<br>congratulating Martin on her very very<br>and I I deliberately haven't talked<br>about your story because you're going to<br>do that the floor is yours Professor<br>thank you so much thank you so much um<br>yeah K Koto um it's really nice to see<br>so many friendly faces here and I truly<br>appreciate you all coming so for those<br>of you that have not been to an oral<br>lecture before these are as you heard<br>for newly appointed professors to share<br>the story of how they um got to where<br>they are now so in short or in brief<br>like I would basically be walking you<br>through my life as a scientist to<br>explain how I got here and I have to<br>admit that I initially uh struggled a<br>little bit to find a title for my an<br>oral lecture because when you look at my<br>research path at least from a distance<br>you may think that I've been working on<br>quite different research themes but I<br>think that once you dig a little bit<br>deeper you may um realize that there are<br>connected by a common theme and that is<br>really a desire to understand the<br>building blocks of biodiversity or the<br>threats of biodiversity and that's why I<br>thought that unraveling the tapestry of<br>life is actually quite a good metaphor<br>for my scientific path now um I thought<br>before we get into the different sort of<br>scientific chapters that Mark my own<br>scientific journey I would like to go<br>back all the way to the beginning of<br>where it all started my childhood to<br>actually understand what made me um want<br>to become a biologist in the first place<br>all right so here you see me with my<br>family on a beach holiday in Denmark so<br>this is me with my mom and my dad and my<br>brother and on the right you see me a<br>little bit older sporting a haircut<br>courtesy to my dad now my um parents<br>really raised me to be like an sort of<br>um friendly um easygoing and confident<br>child and I played for most of my<br>childhood sort of in the outdoors in the<br>garden and in the woods and both of my<br>parents are really big nature lovers my<br>mom is an avid Gardener and she's still<br>spending most of her days now tending to<br>her plans and my dad also made a real<br>point of spending a lot of his free time<br>in in the outdoors um he would often<br>like to create these biodiversity<br>hotspots in my mom's Garden much to her<br>dismay because they really looked like<br>areas where someone had forgotten to use<br>a lawn mower but he also really likes to<br>go on big walks and he would often take<br>me with them on these walks and he would<br>always try to spark my curiosity and get<br>me to ask<br>questions um I never planned to become a<br>professor um it wasn't part of my life's<br>road map and I think that is probably<br>true for the majority of<br>professors um however looking back at my<br>childhood I do have to say that I was<br>raised really among um Prof you know<br>among teachers and University lecturers<br>and professors so I think you can<br>actually say that I come from a truly<br>academic household my mom and my dad my<br>mom actually she um earned a master's<br>degree um in um majoring in pedagogy and<br>German and then when she W had children<br>she became a teacher but while she was<br>studying towards her master's degree um<br>some of her fellow students said that<br>she should attend the lectures of Martin<br>vanro my dad and the rest is history now<br>my dad um he got a PhD in sociology and<br>he was um um you know he um his lifelong<br>journey was to understand how students<br>learn and how to best teach and like so<br>many academics he was very passionate<br>about it and he would often bring home<br>his newest ideas you know something he<br>read the new theories something like<br>that and just to give you a little bit<br>of a flavor of the sort of things that<br>he would bring home to us to discuss<br>with us I show you some of the books<br>that my father published during his<br>career and because not all of you are<br>fluent in German I will translate them<br>so um from left to right so on the left<br>you see um one of his books for for<br>pedagogic which means as much as<br>research based School pedagogy then you<br>have le and l v which means as much as<br>teaching and learning but how then we<br>have building the which means as much as<br>educational theater or theater of<br>education and then my favorite<br>quantitative for inong cens shaft which<br>means as much as you can yeah<br>quantitative research methods and<br>educational science and I think you can<br>see two things there so one he truly<br>really was um Keen to understand as I<br>said how students learn and also how to<br>best teach but I think a more important<br>theme that is emerging and that's been<br>really relevant to me and my upbringing<br>was that my father this whole his whole<br>approach to his um work was really<br>empirical and really research based and<br>that actually set him quite apart from<br>the majority of his colleagues<br>particularly at the time and my dad I<br>would definitely say um he was quite<br>fiercely empirical and also fiercely<br>skeptical and this is why I think the<br>next photo of my dad quite nicely shows<br>his spirit so this was a photo that my<br>dad asked me to take off him we were<br>walking through Washington DC and we<br>walked past the National Academy of<br>Sciences and he saw this quote by Albert<br>Einstein and he read it I read it out to<br>you the right to search for the truth<br>implies also a Duty one must not conceal<br>any part of what one has recognized to<br>be the truth and he connected with that<br>and he said Mar take a photo um of<br>course for the rest of our trip um we<br>went to the Smithsonian Museum for<br>natural history and there we really<br>bonded over over all shared love for<br>nature and we looked at you know um<br>butterflies examine Scallon and sort of<br>went through the greenhouse we were<br>captivated by all the plants and I<br>really think it was this dual nature or<br>this dual connection the love that my<br>parents had always shown me for nature<br>but combined with their quite empirical<br>way to view the world and being quite<br>researched focused all the way through<br>and so I I I still remember my parents<br>is often shaking their head and laughing<br>and saying so funny right that we two<br>parents with a background in education<br>gave rise to two children that have<br>become scientists you know my my brother<br>has a PhD in physics he works at a<br>synchron like a particle accelerator so<br>yes but I think for me it was the only<br>way like I really for me biology was the<br>way to go and so I knew actually from<br>quite a young age that I wanted to<br>become a biologist and I still remember<br>when I was 15 I said to the rest of the<br>world I want to become a biologist and<br>so I went<br>to um you know I was raised and born in<br>gutan and went to school there and right<br>after I finished school I went straight<br>to the university in gutan and it's a<br>great University Town 100,000 people<br>over 30,000 students really buzzing and<br>I immersed myself in biology so I did my<br>bachelor's degree there and I loved it<br>and I also made really good use of my<br>semester breaks on one of them I joined<br>an expedition that was going to Borneo<br>um to learn something about amphibians<br>around the mount kabalo National Park<br>and that's me joining that expedition<br>and I spent two months there but really<br>importantly I also learned during that<br>trip of how to dive and that was one of<br>these lifechanging moments for me<br>because I dived and I saw kind of the<br>life under the ocean surface and it was<br>one of those moments that just<br>went and when I ascended I knew two<br>things I knew I was really in love with<br>the ocean and also knew I wanted to<br>become a marine biologist so after that<br>I I sort of sprang into action and I<br>moved from gutting to the University of<br>Hamburg and I focused on marine biology<br>majoring in fisheries and hydrobiology<br>and was fabulous because we were very<br>small cohort um we were very tight and<br>um we got to go out on these research<br>Expeditions these big research service<br>that were run by the European Union or<br>these European sort of research vessels<br>like here the valta Havoc 3 and we spent<br>weeks and weeks Out on the Ocean um<br>being sort of involved in fishery<br>surveys and I loved it even though my<br>tummy didn't quite agree with that and<br>I I also though learned during those<br>trips that I had a real interest and<br>better understanding more the sort of<br>the interactions between the different<br>species and also species in the<br>environment so ecology and so knowing<br>that I and also knowing that I couldn't<br>do that easily at the University of<br>Hamburg with that major I actually put<br>pen to paper and I wrote an application<br>to spend the last year of my master's<br>degree in Australia so I applied for a<br>grant from the German academic exchange<br>service to pay me or to fund like my<br>last year of research towards my<br>master's degree at the University of<br>Adelaide and they did and so I flew over<br>to study this little guy there kilus<br>nropes The mpip Purge which is a very<br>abundant refes that is found around<br>Australia and I got to dive around this<br>island that you see on the right hand<br>side of the slight West Island which has<br>the field station of Adelaide<br>University and my thesis was really<br>investigating the effect of pram density<br>on Predator foraging Predator being that<br>fish and it was um a really important<br>time for me I had to improve my English<br>quite a lot and it was I would say<br>definitely a period of quite immense<br>personal and also academic growth and we<br>would spend weeks on this island um<br>often underwater you know um collecting<br>data and I've chosen those two photos<br>because I think they actually quite<br>nicely show what was going on during<br>that time so on the left hand side you<br>see me um wearing my purple dry suit um<br>holding a spear gun in my hand with a<br>very nervous nervous smile that was<br>because West Island was an island not<br>just with cold Waters but also we had a<br>big seal Colony there and lots of sharks<br>and so me going in the water to spear<br>this little fish that I was studying was<br>not an easy feat I told myself that<br>having a purple dry suit would hopefully<br>help to make sure that the Sharks knew I<br>was no seal<br>but also you can see that living on an<br>island for a while you develop a bit of<br>a unique sense of fashion and this is me<br>here um probably still in my pajamas but<br>sorting out um set Spear Fish samples<br>and formalin tubes so that was really my<br>time there in Australia and it marked I<br>would say the first really big<br>significant chapter of my scientific<br>journey and Sean conel he really taught<br>me during that time the ropes of<br>experimental ecology um and I got my<br>first publication from that time you see<br>me here with a seal um in which we were<br>able to show that it was really pred<br>density that was most important for<br>influencing Predator foraging<br>Behavior well then came a bit of a<br>because well I should say that actually<br>I should say it a bit<br>differently diving with in the cold<br>Waters around um West Ireland and being<br>surrounded by Seals and sharks really<br>set me up quite nicely for the next<br>chapter of my scientific career which<br>was to join Kendall Clemens lab um and<br>you can see he also had a good sense for<br>fashion and basically um being a diver<br>was almost you know mandatory for<br>joining his lab particularly at that<br>time now<br>um the focus of my PhD project was to<br>really look into the ecological factors<br>that were associated with speciation and<br>New Zealand triple Fin fish and these is<br>a really amazing group of fishes in New<br>Zealand um many million years ago one<br>triple fin arrived in New Zealand has<br>then Diversified into many species<br>around about 26 different species and a<br>lot of them are found all around New<br>Zealand they have the highest diversity<br>here they're also New Zealand's most<br>abundant Reish so if you jump anywhere<br>in the water and you open your eyes<br>Under Water you probably see one and we<br>were really interested of what has<br>actually caused this great diversity a<br>lot of them were overlapping so what has<br>actually caused that Kendall at the time<br>he had a m Grant to investigate that and<br>I was fortunate enough to be awarded a<br>top achiever doctoral scholarship on top<br>of that so we were well funded and then<br>we were basically spending probably the<br>next three years diving around New<br>Zealand all the way from the three King<br>Islands down to Stuart Island and during<br>that time I observed well over 20,000<br>fish<br>underwater fabulous time I learned a lot<br>and just in short to say what we've<br>really found um by doing the research<br>for the next years was that we are<br>dealing here with an adaptive radiation<br>that was triggered by an ecological<br>opportunity meaning that there was a lot<br>of unoccupied space around New Zealand<br>and when the first triple finin came and<br>was able to diversify there were so many<br>different habitat sports that it could<br>move into and so what we have in New<br>Zealand is actually really remarkable we<br>have these different tripin species that<br>occupy quite different habitat types we<br>have some World Records in this country<br>because triplefins are found all around<br>the world except Antarctica but in New<br>Zealand we have the only asine triple<br>Fin and the only pelagic triple<br>fin fabulous time Kendall was an amazing<br>supervisor and I learned a lot and um we<br>got eight Publications from my thesis<br>and thanks to kandle also got the Maring<br>CR priz for best ecological thesis for<br>the year so after that I had a bit of a<br>moment where I really needed to sit down<br>on a bench and think about my next step<br>because I really loved Marine ecology<br>but I was also deeply aware that doing<br>research in Marine ecology is often<br>quite pricey you often need a skipper<br>you need to go<br>diving boat and so I I thought why don't<br>I become a terrestrial ecologist truly<br>you only need like a field car petrol<br>and a butterfly net and I know that's<br>very simplified but it appealed to me<br>and I did that so I applied for a grant<br>for a postdoctoral position to work on<br>insects and not any insects damel flies<br>beautiful damel flies and I moved all<br>the way to Sweden to the University of<br>Lund to study these copterx damsel flies<br>they're found over most parts of Europe<br>near freshwater bodies and what I was<br>really interested in was to understand<br>how climate is inducing rain shifts in<br>these insects and how that in turn is<br>impacting species interactions and so I<br>was working on two damel flies at the<br>time kopter Virgo this really dark<br>species there and kopter splendent and<br>you can see um pointer is probably not<br>working so well but you can see that<br>they have different ranges so one is<br>found further north than the other and<br>what I knew from being based in Lun<br>which is region one I knew that they<br>were able to hybridize but at a low rate<br>and so we were really interested is<br>given that there that copter splendent<br>the one with the wing spots is currently<br>expanding northwards what does it mean<br>in terms of hybridization rate when<br>actually it comes into contact with<br>kopter Virgo that haven't actually<br>encountered female of this other species<br>before what does it do to the<br>hybridization rate and so what we did is<br>that we<br>sampled um the species at two more<br>points and we looked for the likelihood<br>of matings between them to describe the<br>hybridization rate and so we did that at<br>the range margin which is area two so<br>that was absolutely the most northern<br>point where copterx plan was plance was<br>found and was already quite rare and<br>then then that's why I cars there we<br>caught splendens in region two put them<br>in a car and drove them up to the area<br>that we're expanding into and we were<br>looking at the hybridization likelihood<br>there um and how did we do that so how<br>did we actually look at the likelihood<br>of hybridization so we caught females<br>and when we had the female we would<br>actually attach a cotton string like we<br>make a little threat you know we would<br>make a little tie around around the<br>thorax and the abdomen of the female and<br>then we would attach that cotton string<br>to a bamboo stick so you have this<br>bamboo stick in your hand and the female<br>is flying at the end and you can go to<br>like in the video where you saw the<br>males are flying near the rivers they<br>have territories there so you move your<br>FEMA with a cotton you know with a<br>bamboo stick over there and you have the<br>FEMA fly right in front of the male and<br>you can see if the male wants to M with<br>her so you're reporting that so that's<br>what we did for a long time so we're<br>catching femas tethering them to bamboo<br>sticks and then walking along the rivers<br>recording hybridization or mating<br>likelihoods and this is what we found so<br>we found as I said region one and Lun<br>was low at the range margin<br>significantly increased and then even<br>further so it really showed that these<br>climate um induced rain shifts can<br>really have an impact on species<br>interactions and species mixing as<br>well now I should also say it wasn't all<br>easygoing being a post and yet another<br>or being in yet another country wasn't<br>wasn't easy and being a post do was also<br>not easy um at the same time when all of<br>this was happening I also started a<br>family I had my first and second child<br>there was definitely ongoing pressure on<br>us to publish um when I looked around at<br>um Lun University to further my career<br>and to take on some extra training a lot<br>of it was only given in Sweden<br>and I definitely felt or I had at least<br>a moment where I felt a sense of<br>isolation and I took this all in but of<br>course the way I am I do like to Spring<br>a little bit into action and this is why<br>I have this photo here because you know<br>I took this in thought about it and then<br>I asked myself well what can you do<br>about it and so there are few things<br>that I did and I want to briefly reflect<br>on them I put my hand up and I became<br>the organizer of the seminar series at l<br>University and that was great because it<br>gave me access to budget um to invite<br>researchers from all around the world<br>and it really helped me to build my own<br>network I also joined the steering<br>committee of the loan postdoc society<br>and with this I was able to actually<br>organize training for international<br>students um I also decided that I wanted<br>to become a docent which is equivalent<br>to the UK title um of a reader and I<br>enrolled in weeks and weeks of pedagogy<br>training which was really helpful and<br>got me to think a lot and then I also<br>joined the female stem Network and<br>shortly after became the coordinator of<br>it and last but not least I put my hand<br>up to proactively contribute to teaching<br>I will touch on the last two points a<br>little bit more so as I said I joined<br>the female stem Network became the<br>coordinator and that was fabulous<br>because with this I was able to really<br>do organize a lot of networking events I<br>organize conferences and I got to meet a<br>a lot of people but I also started<br>writing about it I wrote a book chapter<br>and I also organized a special issue<br>that was entitled woman's contribution<br>to basic and applied evolutionary<br>biology which was quite a success we had<br>heaps of contributors you can see um<br>them here on the front page and I also<br>got to write an editorial for it with<br>Sally Otto um that was entitled<br>highlighting the change the changing<br>phase of evolutionary biology and I had<br>contributions in that editor torial from<br>some of my scientific Heroes like<br>Rosemary Grant Mary Jane West iard and<br>Josephine pton and I also passed on my<br>learnings and I talked about it at<br>several other places or other<br>universities such as mcquary University<br>in Sydney but also while I was doing a<br>lot of the P pedagogy training I got<br>thinking about course design and course<br>Concepts and all of that and as I said I<br>was a bit frustrated that a lot of the<br>things were only um given in Swedish but<br>I also noticed that there were some real<br>gaps in the curriculum at the time at<br>Lun University and so I actually<br>designed a course or wrote A Course<br>concept um applied at the faculty for<br>funding and they funded it and I want to<br>brief and and and the course was all<br>about science communication because I<br>noticed there was nothing that was being<br>taught at lond university around that<br>particular topic yet I felt it was<br>probably quite important so this was an<br>extremely rewarding experience<br>experience we got funded for several<br>years to um do that and it was a one<br>week intense PhD course it was open to<br>students across all of Scandinavia and<br>every year we were fully booked out and<br>we were teaching that and we were really<br>giving these students a communication<br>toolkit and we had journalists coming<br>and actors and bloggers and all these<br>great people very rewarding<br>experience well but of course my<br>research life also continued at the same<br>time so I got another post doog at the<br>time and this time a mariku post doog<br>and I should say that at this part of my<br>career I sort of started to add to my um<br>ecology and evolution background<br>genetics and that has stayed with me<br>ever since so the question that I was<br>looking at for my mariku post was really<br>what maintains genetic polymorphisms<br>which is a really fundamental question<br>and evolution and I was still working on<br>damel flies um um and here um I changed<br>model systems a little bit so here I'm<br>now working on a shn elgance which is a<br>species that is characterized by a<br>female limited genetic poly color<br>polymorphism it's controlled by<br>mandelian Locus and a single dominance<br>hierarchy and you can see the three<br>female mphs here on the slide you've got<br>an androme and fusin and auskin Absol<br>mph and they differ in color so<br>now what is maintaining this female<br>color polymorph ISM because in any<br>population that you're looking at in<br>Europe they are polymorphic all three<br>females are always there and what we<br>realize so the team and I what we found<br>is that this um polymorphism is<br>maintained by negative frequency<br>dependent selection because of Mal<br>mating harassment just to explain that a<br>little bit more to you so what happens<br>in these damer flies is a little bit<br>akin to Predator prey Dynamics where<br>Predators will learn what is the most<br>common prey in a year and they will form<br>a surch image and then go<br>disproportionately for that prey now in<br>this damel fly they will learn which<br>morph which color morph is the most<br>abundant in a year and they will<br>disproportionately go for that morph and<br>because they have repeated matings and<br>their force matings it is extremely um<br>um it reduces the fitness of the morph<br>and so in the next year that morph would<br>be less common so if a Mel would go for<br>androcom because they're the most common<br>morph<br>in the next year they're probably less<br>common and then in the next year other<br>moves are more common and so you have<br>these Cycles over time that is really<br>maintaining this color polymorphism in<br>um nature and just to say a few more<br>words about this melting harassment is<br>something very common in damsel flies as<br>I said males force culations and there<br>are repeated culations by males and here<br>you're looking at the gene expression<br>plot a volcano plot because looks like<br>this you've got females on one side<br>males on the other and we are now<br>looking at genes that are differentially<br>expressed between males and females and<br>if you look at it you see the most<br>important one pheromone detection it's<br>probably related to mate searching or<br>something like that but then you see in<br>all of these blue dots these are<br>actually immunity um genes so that is<br>because these matings are very stressful<br>and they often actually um incurring<br>injuries and why is that this is a penis<br>of finition elegant smell and they have<br>things like appendices such as brushes<br>hooks Grabbers and spreaders in demer<br>flies because they have repeated matings<br>when a male is mating with a FEMA the<br>first thing he will do is try to remove<br>sperm from previous matings and then you<br>need these sort of appendages but it<br>often leaves injuries they also have<br>sexually transmitted diseases so females<br>try to avoid males in this species they<br>ideally just want to make once um hence<br>the polymorphism and the<br>Cycles I got for my um work on Dam ofly<br>spaces an award from the Swedish King<br>like you heard and was quite a humbling<br>experience to go up to Stockholm to the<br>palace and to meet him and to receive<br>this award and it was really towards<br>contributions um to biodiversity<br>research and it came really at a time<br>when my particular research on genetic<br>polymorphisms was sort of increasing and<br>continuing and I got also promoted to<br>associate professor at the time I<br>started my own group and I got a bigger<br>Grant from the Swedish research Council<br>to look at genetic polymorphisms in<br>another model system uh inversion<br>polymorphisms actually this time and I'm<br>looking at this other model system right<br>here I guess you can't really see it<br>because it's quite small but I'm here on<br>the L foron Island um chain looking at<br>rotting seaweed and my new model system<br>was actually this it's pretty hard to<br>see probably but you see maybe some<br>things flying you have to go quite close<br>um so these are seaweed flies they they<br>live in rotting seaweed they are a lot<br>less charismatic than damel flies but<br>you know I always like to get my hands<br>on numbers and data and so they suited<br>me very well and most importantly they<br>had this really interesting genetic<br>polymorphism an inversion polymorphism<br>on chromosome one which included a lot<br>of genes and had these massive<br>phenotypic effects on males so not<br>females this time right with this neural<br>Elegance we had these color moves here<br>we're actually having a big genetic<br>polymorphism and it's mostly impacting<br>males it impacts Mes in many traits but<br>the most important one was actually size<br>so you can have either the alpha or the<br>beta inversion and if you have two times<br>the alpha you're 9 mm in size and if you<br>have two times the beta you're 3 m MIM<br>in size and H carot types Alpha betas<br>are 6 mm in size so that's a three-fold<br>size difference I mean just imagine that<br>in humans it's massive it's massive and<br>it has huge<br>consequences um so we were again trying<br>to understand what is maintaining this<br>genetic polymorphism in nature because<br>like with AA you could go to any<br>population it was polymorphic so what is<br>maintaining it and I should say even<br>though we were studying and seaweed<br>flies these inversion encoded<br>polymorphisms are actually really<br>important across the tree of life and<br>here just to show you some of um some<br>good examples where in inversions encode<br>really important traits or ecomorphs for<br>instance inversions can encode different<br>mating systems as you can see in white<br>throated Sparrow or roughs or they can<br>cause phenotype genotype associations as<br>seen here by Tima walking sticks or n<br>long butterflies or that can even cause<br>these really behavioral ecotypes like<br>seen and fire ends or rainbow trout but<br>I was working on seed flies but really a<br>model to understand what is maintaining<br>these big you know genetic polymorphisms<br>in<br>nature and we we did work we did do some<br>work in Europe and we were looking at<br>these inversion frequencies across space<br>so you see a map of Europe there or part<br>of Europe<br>Scandinavia and you see in these pie<br>shards the different inversion<br>frequencies and you can see it's<br>polymorphic in all populations you also<br>see that there's a slight Clin of beta<br>declining towards the Baltic Sea and<br>cines are always classical signatures of<br>natural selection and action what we did<br>during my um Swedish research Council<br>grants was really to expand This<br>research to North America because the<br>fly is also found in North America and<br>we sampled 8,000 kilomet of the<br>coastline and looked at the inversion<br>frequencies and again absolutely<br>polymorphic right but no clle we looked<br>everywhere we looked for salinity<br>latitude temperature anything nothing so<br>we were really puzzled like what is<br>actually maintaining this genetic<br>polymorphism if there's not such a<br>strong link like cliental link with<br>environmental variables and so we did<br>something that you can do very well with<br>um insects we did an experimental<br>Evolution experiment and I won't go into<br>I won't go too much into it because I<br>don't have the time but we basically did<br>a 10 generation experimental Evolution<br>trial on this fly where we were able to<br>sort of disentangle the growth phase<br>from the U reproduction phase and we<br>were able to look at inversion effects<br>um of these different phases and we were<br>able to show that when it comes to the<br>growing phase that actually being yellow<br>being a beta that they have much better<br>survival and faster development in that<br>situation and that is really important<br>when you're in a resource pool<br>environment like rack beds that are very<br>thin there's not a lot there you know<br>that rotting seaweed or like a rack bed<br>that gets washed out to sea because of<br>the tide in those situations being beta<br>is best however um it is much better to<br>be gray when you are in a resourcer<br>environment plenty of rack bed no rush<br>to develop fast because if you are alpha<br>you are much better at forcing<br>populations here as well and and also<br>the females are much more Fant and so we<br>are dealing with in a with a situation<br>where we are having a life history<br>tradeoff that is basically maintaining<br>this polymorphism in nature so balancing<br>selection<br>um after this came a bit of a Reflection<br>Point again because my research was<br>going really well um you know we were<br>really getting into it we got good<br>grants I had students but then my<br>partner at the time Damian Daman Moran<br>he got a job offer at plant and food<br>research a permanent position and then<br>after being interviewed I also got a<br>permanent position offer and that's<br>almost like a dream come true right for<br>scientists having like suddenly two<br>permanent<br>positions but it was outside the<br>university and I thought this was really<br>scary because I'd never been outside the<br>University<br>and so at that time um Richard um um<br>Richard new camp and relle Constantine<br>were in Lun that were on there on their<br>sabatical and I still vividly remember<br>walking with Richard in the park and<br>literally saying to him am I going to<br>commit academic<br>suicide and he said no and I'm really<br>glad he did because honestly I do think<br>now which is like more the last chapter<br>of my life it was you know probably the<br>most rewarding part of my scientific<br>career because what this move allowed me<br>to do was really to connect my um<br>fundamental research with you know all<br>the way to an impact to an applied sign<br>side and that was something that took a<br>little while to learn still learning it<br>I think but it's been extremely<br>rewarding to learn that and to be able<br>to actually translate science all the<br>way to Something That Matters to to<br>Industry to people um and so at first of<br>course you can imagine moving countries<br>and changing is not easy so at first I<br>said I want to be 5050 so I stayed at<br>Lun University for 50% of my time I<br>still had students research grants I<br>finished that and then went for 50% to<br>pfr and Nelson was a hell of a commute<br>um I did that for three years and then I<br>fully um based myself in New Zealand and<br>shortly after an opportunity came up to<br>join the join graduate school um between<br>plant and food and the University of<br>Oakland which I then um joined um in<br>2018 as an associate professor and I've<br>been here ever since and it's been<br>fabulous because with this I've had<br>really access to great minds good<br>colleagues I was able to teach and also<br>meet students so it's been a really um<br>interesting part and you know going to<br>plant food and Nelson I was able to<br>continue my sort of more fundamental<br>interest in research and I was given a<br>lot of freedom to do so and just one<br>slide on that so I really the the my<br>sort of fundamental research on um<br>genetic polymorphisms has really stayed<br>with me particularly Focus as I said I<br>sort of moved into inversion<br>polymorphisms but then a big focus on<br>structural genomic variance and and and<br>how they really matter in Eco<br>evolutionary Dynamics I've worked a lot<br>on that but over the years I've also<br>sort of moved more and more to New<br>Zealand relevant examples for my<br>research of course one example here is<br>the Snapper genome version two that<br>we've just published and that shows you<br>sort of on the outer ring the 24<br>chromosomes and the inner ring show you<br>the different types of structural<br>genomic variance that we were able to<br>explain to describe such as deletions<br>insertion duplications inversions and<br>translocations all the way in and we<br>have been studying how they impact Eco<br>evolutionary Dynamics and the phenotype<br>so that has been going on but I will not<br>focus on those aspects for the rest of<br>my talk I actually want to move on a<br>little bit more to the applied side now<br>because as I said that has been<br>extremely rewarding and so I want to<br>talk a little bit more of how I have<br>been using my knowledge in ecological<br>genomics to really trying to achieve a<br>little bit more of an applied outcome<br>and really achieving some impact and so<br>one thing I wanted talk about is um<br>fisheries management the other one is<br>aquaculture so first how can we actually<br>use genomics in New Zealand to inform<br>fisheries management I give you two<br>examples one is really to reveal the<br>stock structure of species that are<br>otherwise difficult to study such as<br>hokey deep water or how can we use<br>genomics to inform Seafood<br>traceability um and here I will use<br>Snapper as an example so a little bit<br>this is actually a project that came to<br>us by industry walking through the and<br>saying we would like you to look into<br>this we do not know at the moment Hoke<br>is our most important commercial deep<br>water species um it's currently managed<br>as two stocks but industry was wondering<br>is it actually um are there actually two<br>stocks are we managing it properly or is<br>are there maybe three are there more is<br>there one so what we did is that we work<br>together with industry we sampled 12<br>sites around New Zealand and also two in<br>tesia and got 500 individuals we got<br>whole genome sequences for all of them<br>and then we plotted it and this is just<br>a but it shows you two clusters this is<br>the whole genome information from all of<br>those 510 individuals and you clearly<br>see all of the hokei from Australia<br>cluster and all of the hokei from New<br>Zealand cluster which indicates we did<br>additional analysis to that but it<br>indicates that New Zealand hokey are<br>genetically one or they mix quite a lot<br>at least and so we have been said<br>communicating that with the New Zealand<br>and Australian fishing industry to<br>inform their<br>management another species here Snapper<br>this is an example of how genomics can<br>be used to inform Seafood traceability<br>now hokei they migrate quite a lot they<br>go all the way to the sub Antarctic<br>islands and all of that but Snapper<br>moves a lot less and so when you have a<br>lot less movement you can get all this<br>genetic structure and so we really<br>wanted to understand a bit more about<br>snappa structure<br>it's so we had 10 sampling sites and<br>again 350 genomes and this is what you<br>get for Snapper quite a different<br>situation you actually get a Southern<br>and a northern cluster and you see<br>there's quite a bit of sort of flow<br>between the two they're not like<br>completely separate clusters but there<br>there are clusters nevertheless and if<br>you put this pattern on a map looks like<br>this so you've got as I said the<br>northern red cluster and the blue<br>Southern cluster and you have these<br>mixing zones around Mahia Peninsula and<br>Cape ranga but what is actually really<br>cool if you look a little bit deeper you<br>also see that from the different<br>sampling sites that we have that a lot<br>of them<br>contain um local genetic substructure so<br>all the ones that are encircled with<br>blue actually have local genetic um<br>local genetic signal and so what you can<br>do with that um genetic signal you can<br>use that for SE for traceability because<br>if you have a fisherman that got quota<br>to catch something on the west coast and<br>is landing that you can actually check<br>if it's truly from the West Coast or<br>maybe instead from gisburn so that's<br>extremely powerful and for that sort of<br>work I got the Hamilton award in<br>2018 which was great because it really<br>opened doors to a lot more and having<br>your SS being heard and being recognized<br>and I got to speak at Parliament shortly<br>after um talking about things such as<br>you know the use for genomics and how we<br>can really use it for sustainable<br>management we don't use genomics at all<br>for fisheries management in New Zealand<br>and I think there's a real opportunity<br>to do so it also opened um the doors to<br>contribute to some sort of more<br>decision-making and working groups there<br>were several but I gu just one example<br>for instance I was part of the working<br>group um that was initiated by the Prime<br>Minister Chief science advis adviser jet<br>jera at the time um called the future of<br>commercial fishing in ataro new New<br>Zealand and so we put this report<br>together and this was really really um a<br>rewarding experience to be able to<br>contribute to<br>that and this is kind of what we put<br>sort of um these sort of ideas in the<br>report you know what could a future look<br>like this is what we're doing on the<br>left hand side at the moment this is how<br>we're doing fisheries management we're<br>using using all the length and you know<br>abundance data and things like that from<br>Trolls but actually if we add to that<br>genetic data um we can really get<br>improved insights into stock structure<br>how many individuals are there<br>connectivity to really model the genes<br>to ecosystem response of a fishery so<br>this is a vision but I think it's a good<br>one so the last part that I want to very<br>briefly touch on is also how genomics<br>can be used to inform aquaculture which<br>is really important for New Zealand<br>we're an island nation we have a lot of<br>opportunity and so we've been focusing<br>on a number of species but the species I<br>want to highlight is austral Asian<br>Snapper it's a species we've been<br>selecting because of such huge<br>importance in New Zealand it's a really<br>important customary species um but also<br>one of our big inore fishery species and<br>also important for recreational uh<br>fishing and um it also thrives in the<br>warm Waters around the North Island<br>which is important because at the moment<br>our only finfish species chinox Salon is<br>in can be farmed around the south<br>island<br>so we've been really lucky because a lot<br>of this work that I'm showing you you<br>know whether it's Fisheries genomics or<br>aquaculture we've been doing that<br>together with industry with Mari and um<br>that gives us often access to resources<br>that make the research so relevant for<br>instance here for the aquaculture<br>research we are using a c pen that we're<br>leasing from n seafood and they are<br>sponsoring a lot of the work as well and<br>we can just scale things up and run them<br>at a semi-commercial level which has<br>been quite um important and just to show<br>you one of my last graphs this is just<br>to show you how we have been using<br>genomics to accelerate<br>breeding um breeding gains in the<br>australasian Snapper you see in blue our<br>selected strain and in green and<br>unselected strain just to give you a bit<br>of an idea of what that can look like<br>and what you can achieve with fast and<br>improved selection and it doesn't just<br>Inc uh increase the growth rate in our<br>case by 30 40% but we're also getting<br>when we're comparing the improved and<br>the non-improved Snapper line we're<br>getting much better survival and<br>improved fcr so food conversion<br>ratios now my last slide really just<br>some quick Reflections because it's not<br>easy to put all of this together from<br>the last I don't I know 20 years or so<br>but looking back a few things that I've<br>learned some<br>Reflections well often people have said<br>why do you have so much energy how do<br>you do this and I truly think that if<br>you do something that really awakens<br>your<br>curiosity and and gives you meaning that<br>you do have a lot of energy so I would<br>always say to everyone stick to your gut<br>don't do something because other people<br>tell you to do that or because it's<br>trendy honestly like follow a little bit<br>your own path um definitely also noticed<br>like um it's okay to be ambitious it's<br>not really about us what we are doing<br>here it's okay to have these big<br>ambitious projects and have a Long View<br>and definitely put on your piece of the<br>puzzle help others with<br>theirs I also um I'm a strong believer<br>of that we all need to sometimes leave<br>the Ivory Tower I mean I find it<br>sometimes really uncomfortable and would<br>like to run the other way but I sort of<br>pushed myself and say come on let's do<br>this and if we all do that that's really<br>important because I think making our<br>research matter is so important and we<br>just sometimes have to do it however we<br>want to but a little<br>bit I also really think it is quite<br>important to always be open to a<br>challenge and to be able to critically<br>discuss this maybe that's my father<br>coming through but I think we all have<br>our own ideas and our own ideology and<br>our own believes but you have to be able<br>to move that to the side and look at it<br>and really critically and openly discuss<br>this this very very<br>important and yeah last but not least<br>have fun at work and definitely<br>celebrate success being a scientist is<br>not always easy it looks great when you<br>put it together like this and when I<br>hear other people talk about it but<br>there have been lots of steps that<br>weren't so smooth or that were hard or<br>where things didn't go that way and so<br>when they do go well definitely<br>celebrate them really really<br>important and that's my last slide um I<br>think I mean I talked a lot about myself<br>now but we all work in teams and<br>everything I presented today it's big<br>teamwork you know I mean kudos to<br>everyone involved I had heaps of people<br>supporting me over the years um and not<br>just my scientific colleagues also of<br>course family and friends that have<br>always been there supporting me um<br>thanks for my Nelson foro being here and<br>also CL people so thank you so much for</p></main><footer style="margin-top: 2rem; background: #0001; padding: 2rem; text-align: center;"><p>We Are The University</p><ul
