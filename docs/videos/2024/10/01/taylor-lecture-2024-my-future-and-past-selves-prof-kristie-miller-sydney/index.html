and<br>Gwen Taylor lecture the first of two<br>lectures uh since due to the pandemic<br>which some of you may remember a few<br>years ago uh we were not able to have<br>this event for a few years so we've got<br>a backlog so this year we're able to<br>have two in a row uh so tonight we have<br>the first of two so just to say<br>historically what is uh Dan Taylor was<br>the professor of philosophy at tago from<br>1960 to 1970 after having previously<br>taught in Ghana and Quinn Taylor was a<br>lecturer and Senior lecturer from 1967<br>until she retired here in<br>1982 uh and their Fellowship has been<br>allowing esteemed visitors to come and<br>spend some time here uh for over 30<br>years so we're very appreciative to have<br>that as an ongoing thing that the<br>university can't take away which is good<br>uh so tonight very pleased to have uh<br>Professor Christy Miller from the<br>University of Sydney she's the Chalice<br>professor of philosophy there as well as<br>the co-director of the center for time<br>which my kids have been finding very<br>funny but uh she works primarily in<br>metaphysics particularly on the nature<br>of time and temporal experience H as<br>well as a bunch of other stuff like<br>personal identity persistence<br>composition and explanation she has<br>written many books most recently the<br>normative status of time bias and<br>another one called out of time<br>co-authored with Sam Baron and Jonathan<br>Talent she's got uh many many papers my<br>personal favorite is one called<br>stuff which has the memorable line that<br>says the world is full of stuff and some<br>things which I have quoted more than<br>once in my own work<br>so uh it's true she has previously held<br>Arc decas an arc senior re research<br>fellowship and an arc future Fellowship<br>she's a fellow for the Australian<br>Academy of the humanities she's appeared<br>on the BBC and the ABC television<br>talking about how to build a time<br>machine and has written a lot of public<br>facing work as well including on<br>psychology and on all sorts of stuff so<br>we're very lucky to have Christy here<br>tonight she oh and she's the<br>editorinchief of<br>synthes so we're very lucky to have her<br>here tonight and tonight she's going to<br>tell us about should I care about my<br>future and past selves and if so should<br>I care about them as much as my current<br>self so we'll have about 50 minutes of<br>talk and then some questions<br>Zach yes so that is indeed what I want<br>to talk to you about um so this is uh<br>sort of the culmination of a bunch of<br>different projects that are coming<br>together here okay so let's suppose that<br>I had walked in here this evening and I<br>bought a bucket with me doesn't have to<br>be read and the bucket is full of<br>well-being and so I picked one of you<br>lucky people and I say okay Mike here's<br>your bucket I say the job that U I'm<br>giving you here is I've got this bucket<br>full of well-being and I want you to<br>disseminate it across yourself through<br>time so maybe to do this you might sort<br>of Imagine pulling yourself out from<br>this current moment and looking down at<br>yourself through all the time from the<br>moment you're born or whenever you think<br>you start coming into existence if you<br>think you exist before then before then<br>up until the moment that you die or<br>after if you think you exist after death<br>uh and so your job is Take the bucket<br>and figure out how to disseminate that<br>well being across yourselves all through<br>time now seems like there's two uh<br>proposals that you might instantly<br>entertain about how to do this so one<br>proposal is well I'm going to take my<br>bucket and I'm just going to evenly<br>distribute it across all of these cells<br>like I give going to give them all the<br>same amount of this well-being however<br>much that is depending on what's in my<br>bucket second thought you might have is<br>well what I'm going to do is not<br>distribute the well being equally but<br>I'm going to look at all my and I'm<br>going to try and make it the case that<br>by Distributing the well-being I give<br>them all the same amount right so if<br>there's some poor self in there that was<br>having a really shitty time and had<br>really low wellbeing I'm going to top<br>them up a lot so it's not distributed<br>evenly but still the goal is to kind of<br>even out the wellbeing now I take it<br>that if you had either of these thoughts<br>it's some evidence that you think that<br>uh that you should be caring equally<br>about the well-being of all of<br>yourselves right so I guess that's kind<br>of the thing that would MO motivate<br>either of those two proposals with<br>respect to what to do with the<br>well-being in your<br>bucket and what I want to suggest is<br>that that initial um intuition which is<br>uh yes I should uh care equally about<br>the well-being of all of these selves is<br>the correct one to<br>have all right so yes that is the way we<br>should go okay so at this point you<br>might be thinking I don't know what your<br>I don't have insight into your heads but<br>one thing you might be thinking is well<br>like this is going to be a very quick um<br>thing she's going say here and it's<br>going to be super obvious so here's what<br>I want to do uh I do want to argue for<br>that conclusion that you should care<br>equally about all yourselves but I'm<br>going to give you a bunch of cases and<br>some of them I think are going to pull<br>you in the direction of thinking that<br>that can't in fact be right if that's<br>not already the intuition you have so uh<br>I'm going to introduce those cases and<br>I'm going to say there are a bunch of<br>people who think that what they show is<br>that you shouldn't in fact care equally<br>about all yourselves and then I'm going<br>to try and convince you that they're<br>wrong about that so it won't be so much<br>D okay so let's start with the most<br>important thing Annie so this is Annie<br>the Labradoodle um there she is with her<br>ball uh Annie is in fact sadly no longer<br>with us but since she's four-dimensional<br>in some sense she's obviously still out<br>there in the block okay so here's the<br>most important thing to know about Annie<br>she loves<br>balls this is important I want us to<br>imagine that Annie is forming<br>preferences over the following uh two<br>states of Affairs she can either at this<br>time be given one ball or she can be<br>given two balls now Annie loves balls<br>and what's more she loves two balls<br>twice as much as she loves one ball<br>there's no there's no diminishing<br>returns when it comes to balls my<br>friend uh okay so it seems like if we<br>ask if I were to ask one of you what do<br>you think Annie should prefer from the<br>one ball or two ball option I take it<br>you're going to say she should prefer<br>surely she should prefer the two balls<br>right she loves them twice as much that<br>seems obvious and what's more you might<br>think it would be an irrational<br>preference for her to somehow prefer the<br>one ball to the two let's change the<br>case now though let's suppose she's uh<br>forming preferences over one ball now<br>and two balls in 3 months time<br>right now what should she<br>prefer well your initial thought might<br>be well it's uh in all relevant respects<br>this is just the same case right the<br>only difference is that the balls are<br>separated temporally but she still get<br>twice as much ball compared to one so<br>obviously she should prefer two balls in<br>3 months time to one B now and then you<br>might think oh but wait that's going to<br>depend on various factors so you might<br>worry look maybe uh in 3 months what's<br>happening is that she uh we put aside<br>the the two balls now but we put them<br>somewhere such that uh they age and<br>become Mankey over this three months<br>right in which case she'd be forming<br>preferences over one clean ball and two<br>Mankey dirty balls and let's suppose she<br>cares a lot about dirt you might think<br>well in that case you would have a<br>reason to prefer one clean ball over two<br>dirty balls likewise she might be<br>thinking about this case and thinking<br>well you look dodgy you tell me I'm<br>going to get two balls in 3 months time<br>but like I you know I can't be certain<br>of that a ball now is worth two in 3<br>months time because the 3 months time<br>balls are uncertain and the current ball<br>is certain right so she's comparing uh<br>highly probable wall with less less<br>probable two balls so I want us to<br>imagine that that's none of those kinds<br>of things are going on so I want us to<br>imagine that uh the balls are<br>qualitatively the same whenever she gets<br>them and what's more that she's equally<br>likely to get them whenever they are so<br>the only relevant differences I want you<br>to think about are how many balls are<br>there and when are they<br>right no other factors are to enter in<br>here so at this point you might be<br>coming the thought that okay then she<br>obviously should prefer the two balls to<br>the one ball because this is relevantly<br>like that first case it's just that<br>there's a um they're temporally<br>separated now of course course we know<br>that's not what people and we're all<br>people that's not what people are like<br>so uh Reams and reams of um studies in<br>Psychology and economics show that in<br>fact people prefer um less of a good<br>thing as long as it's temporarily near<br>near to them so when you ask people<br>would you prefer 80 bucks now or 103<br>months they'll often prefer the 80 bucks<br>now and if people of if people are<br>labradoodles if it's lab Doodles we have<br>in mind then they May well have the view<br>that they'd prefer fewer balls now<br>because they're now to more balls later<br>right this is a kind of common<br>um and in fact uh you find the same<br>thing with respect to negative um<br>experiences so suppose I say to you look<br>you have to have this dental surgery<br>you're not in pain now but there's some<br>bad stuff going down in there and it's<br>going to have to happen at some point<br>but it's going to get worse if you delay<br>it so you can either have um a 2-hour<br>surgery in 9 months because there will<br>be degradation of the<br>oral whatever it is during the period or<br>you can have a 1hour surgery tomorrow<br>here's what we know a bunch of people<br>are going to delay the surgery they're<br>going to prefer a surgery that's twice<br>as long and objectionable as long as<br>it's further away from where they are<br>right and people do this all the<br>time so these kind of preferences are<br>known as nebi preferences near bias is a<br>preference for having good stuff<br>temporally close to you and bad stuff<br>temporally far<br>away okay and in economics and<br>psychology they're predominantly<br>interested in future directed nearby so<br>they're predominantly interested in the<br>idea that you have a preference for<br>having uh good things temporally in your<br>future rather than temporally far away<br>and a preference for having um bad<br>things temporally further away rather<br>than temporally nearer but there's also<br>retrospective nearby us which is just<br>the backward facing one it's having<br>preferences for having things in the<br>near past rather than the far past um<br>there's not a lot of research on that<br>but we have some at the center of time<br>which shows interestingly people are<br>actually near biased<br>retrospectively so here's a question are<br>these preferences rational or does<br>having these preferences make you<br>irrational<br>and the answer to this question uh well<br>the actual answer obviously doesn't<br>depend who you ask but who you ask is<br>going to uh make a difference to um what<br>the answer is you here so here's<br>something interesting if you ask<br>economists they're going to tell you one<br>thing and if you ask philosophers who<br>Are All Made of Stone and<br>male uh make of that what you will um<br>they're going to say another thing so<br>economists as we'll see in a second are<br>going to say that um it's not<br>universally the case that being near<br>biased is irrational now notice that<br>coming back to this original question I<br>asked you about um whether you should<br>care equally about yourselves if you are<br>near biased and if being near biased is<br>rational then it turns out that it can<br>be rational not to care equally about<br>all of yourselves cuz what are you doing<br>if you're near biased well effectively<br>you're privileging your closer selves<br>over your further away selves right um<br>if you've got well-being you want to<br>distribute more of it to your<br>temporarily close selves and less of it<br>to your temporally further away selves<br>if you've got whatever the opposite of<br>well-being is like the bucket full of<br> I guess that would be and you have<br>to distribute that I didn't bring that<br>one but like I could have right I give<br>you that and I say have at it um if<br>you're inclined to want to give most of<br>it to the very far away selves right uh<br>then again what you're doing is um<br>caring differentially about where these<br>selves are so if nearby turns out to be<br>rational then it turns out that you<br>ought not care equally about all<br>yourselves or at the very least that<br>it's permissible not<br>to and what economists say is yes that's<br>where we are so they think it's<br>permissible to care differentially about<br>various of elves depending entirely on<br>where they're located now there are some<br>constraints on this there are some bad<br>ways of being near biased as we'll see<br>but there are plenty of perfectly<br>permissible ways philosophers on the<br>other hand take the view that you are it<br>is not rationally permissible to care<br>differentially about yourselves just in<br>virtue of where they're located and<br>we're going to um see some arguments for<br>is okay so we're back to Annie this is<br>an adorable picture sorry I just<br>couldn't<br>resist uh<br>all right so<br>uh here's another important aspect of<br>this talk liver treats liver cake in<br>fact so what are we doing when we're<br>near biased well one way of thinking<br>about what's going on in near bias is<br>that you're discounting the value of<br>experiences or well-being or Goods uh<br>depending on how far away from you they<br>are in time so uh if I prefer that bad<br>things and more bad things happen to<br>myself when it's further away as opposed<br>to near one way of modeling that is to<br>think that uh I am discounting the value<br>of what's happening to the to the<br>further away guys relative to the near<br>guys right so of course if the if I if I<br>value them less then it makes sense that<br>they get the and the nearer selves<br>get the good stuff so returning to the<br>economists this is liver cake this is<br>homemade liver cake I didn't make it cuz<br>I can't cook although conceivably could<br>cook liver cake but there are lots of<br>online recipes if you're there thinking<br>oh that looks delicious it's not for<br>humans it's for dogs but you could eat<br>it I take it so I want you to imagine<br>that uh this uh liver cake is going to<br>be Annie's if she gets it right now it's<br>worth 100 units of pleasure let's just<br>imagine that we can measure pleasure in<br>units um but supp she has to wait a day<br>until the end of tomorrow now remember<br>when we're thinking about this case<br>we're not imagining that I make the cake<br>now and then I just let it get stale for<br>24 hours so we're not imagining she's<br>comparing fresh cake now to stale cake<br>tomorrow the Cake's going to be rebaked<br>Cake's exactly the same but it from her<br>current self's perspective if she gets<br>the cake tomorrow it's only worth half<br>of what it's worth if she gets it now<br>namely it's worth to her now only 50<br>units one way of putting that is she's<br>50% now let's suppose she does that<br>again so from a current perspective<br>she's now um thinking about what the<br>cake is worth to her if she gets it in<br>two days what's it worth suppose she<br>discounts that next day by 50% again<br>right so at this point the Cake's only<br>worth 25 units by the end of this the<br>second day and suppos she continues<br>along like that well this is to say that<br>she has a kind of exponential discount<br>function and all that means is that when<br>she's discounting the value of the cake<br>to her she's discounting it by a<br>constant amount in this case 50% which<br>is a whopping discount function right W<br>good thing we don't discount like that<br>otherwise our elderly sales will be<br> okay so she's discounting<br>exponentially compare that to a<br>different case so again we've got the<br>same liver cake again she discounts it<br>by<br>50% uh if she has to wait a day for us<br>but then uh from her current perspective<br>waiting an additional day doesn't result<br>in her discounting by 50% that<br>additional day she's only discounting by<br>25% right and then the day after she's<br>discounting by 10% and as the time<br>progresses the discount rate gets<br>smaller and smaller so this is a<br>non-exponential discount function and in<br>fact it's a hyperbolic function what's<br>going on with hyperbolic function so two<br>things one is that the discount rate<br>itself is not the same over time and<br>importantly what this captures is the is<br>the following feeling that Annie might<br>have which is look it's really costly to<br>wait one day for my liver cake right I<br>really want it now I'm desperate so so<br>it's really worth a lot less to me if I<br>have to wait one day but now suppos in<br>said I have to wait two days waiting two<br>days is not as twice as bad as waiting<br>one day like that extra day it's a bit<br>worse but like it's not uh as much bad<br>again and so on and so forth like by the<br>time you make her think she's going to<br>wait eight days that Eighth Day makes<br>very little impact on her compared to<br>waiting for day seven typically you and<br>I are hyperbolic Discounters weight we<br>we're very um we're very impatient<br>initially but once things are far enough<br>away the discount function gets um<br>smaller and<br>smaller so let's suppose that uh the<br>function that Annie ends up having is<br>one in which she prefers 3/4 of a liver<br>cake now to a whole cake in 5 hours time<br>so she she really wants her cake now and<br>she's prefer prepared to have a quarter<br>of a cake Less in order to get it now<br>rather than have to wait for 5<br>hours okay so this should seem familiar<br>to anyone who has a lab oodle or<br>anything in the Ood family<br>but now suppose she's thinking about<br>what happens if she if she's comparing<br>getting 3/4 of a cake in three month's<br>time versus a whole cake in 3 months and<br>5 hours right from her current<br>perspective well it seems like very<br>plausible and in fact she would have<br>this discount function that at this<br>point she prefers the whole cake in 3<br>months and 5 hours over the 3/4 of a<br>cake in um three months right because<br>that additional 5 hours doesn't make<br>much difference to her when it's 3<br>months away<br>so her preferences have flipped in the<br>sense that um the difference of that 5<br>hours makes flips her preferences when<br>it's uh now as opposed to when it's in 3<br>months time now this is the thing that<br>economists go apit about they're like no<br>this this this be no good they say right<br>so Annie's problem they say is not that<br>she's discounting the value of this<br>liver Cate the further away it goes her<br>problem is that she has this kind of<br>function which allows her preferences to<br>flip so they say this is madness because<br>in both of these cases all we have is a<br>difference of 5 hours in terms of weight<br>time and the only difference is when the<br>difference of 5 hours is right and that<br>shouldn't make a difference it shouldn't<br>make your preferences flip so that's not<br>the right kind of function they say you<br>shouldn't be a hyperbolic Discounter so<br>this kind of graph um represents<br>hyperbolic and exponential discounting<br>and you can see the difference right so<br>the hyperbolic discounting you get this<br>very sharp discounting because you're<br>really super impatient when you have to<br>wait for things right now but it kind of<br>flattens off because once things are a<br>certain distance away each unit of time<br>doesn't make very much difference to<br>you so that kind of discounting they say<br>is irrational but exponential<br>discounting is<br>fine and here's the the here's a way of<br>kind of representing this right so<br>suppose you're um forming preferences<br>this home of bags of cash so you can<br>have your $50 bag now or your $100 bag<br>in six months time and suppose in that<br>case you prefer the $50 now to the $100<br>in 6 months but now you're supposed to<br>be imagining what seems like the same<br>scenario you've got two bags of cash<br>separated by 6 months but you've just<br>pushed them a little bit further in time<br>and now weirdly your preferences have<br>flipped the other way so this is meant<br>to be<br>um unattractive in<br>preferences philosophers think yeah<br>that's not good but they think uh in<br>General near bias preferences aren't<br>good so in general it oughtn't to be the<br>case that we care more about some of our<br>um future selves over others of them and<br>they're going to give us a bunch of<br>arguments which don't go via this kind<br>of worry about hyperbolic verses<br>exponential discounting so what they're<br>going to say is<br>look there's something very odd about<br>just caring when a self is located in<br>terms of uh how much you care about the<br>well-being of that<br>self in particular you might think that<br>temporal location is kind of arbitrary<br>in the following sense it's not<br>normatively relevant to the preferences<br>that you're forming so to give a sense<br>of what you might mean by this kind of<br>idea of arbitrariness and maybe to get<br>your intuitions um pumping here that<br>there's something to this idea uh let's<br>go to pait<br>so uh pait is very hung off about<br>Tuesdays here's the case who probably<br>many of us know this case so uh he<br>introduces his character called a<br>certain headest but I'm going to call<br>him Bert cuz I I don't know why paet<br>didn't name him uh so he's a henst uh so<br>he cares about the quality of his future<br>experiences to be fair I feel like we<br>all care about the quality of our future<br>experiences we don't need him to be<br>ahead in this right uh so he has he<br>cares about like what happens to him on<br>all of the days and on any day that he's<br>doing stuff he prefers that he's not be<br>that he's not in pain and that he is<br>having pleasure including any Tuesday at<br>which you know experiences are happening<br>however he's this has this feature which<br>is he being future Tuesday indifferent<br>so on any Tuesday he cares in the normal<br>way about what's happening to him so if<br>you go up to Herbert on a Tuesday and<br>punch him in the head it's painful and<br>he protests and he's not happy about<br>that right and he says this is not uh<br>this is not good I'm going to<br>HR however when he's prospectively<br>thinking about future Tuesdays he<br>doesn't care about his experiences on<br>prospective future Tuesdays so that<br>makes it rational for him for instance<br>if he's choosing between a very painful<br>operation on a future Tuesday and a not<br>painful one on a Wednesday<br>um he prefers the painful operation on a<br>Tuesday to the less painful one on a<br>Wednesday because he doesn't care about<br>the pain on<br>Tuesday now it's important for this paet<br>case that Herbert doesn't have false<br>beliefs so it's not as if prospectively<br>he thinks that Tuesday pain just doesn't<br>hurt right so clearly it would be very<br>rational if every time a Tuesday rocked<br>around you didn't feel pain because that<br>would be the day to schedule all of your<br>dental appointments and paps M and so<br>forth right that would be<br>great uh that's not the case and what's<br>more he doesn't believe that to be the<br>case so he knows that when Tuesday rocks<br>around these painful things are going to<br>be painful nevertheless it's just a b<br>fact that he doesn't care about Tuesday<br>pains and paa thinks well something has<br>monumentally gone wrong here with<br>Herbert and I tend to agree and one<br>diagnosis you might have is that it<br>looks like that set of preferences is<br>just um horrendously arbitrary and why<br>is that well because there's nothing<br>normatively relevant about Tuesdays<br>right the pains are the same what's more<br>there's just sort of nothing about the<br>nature of a Tuesday which means that you<br>ought to not care about its pain in the<br>same way you care about a Wednesday pain<br>or a Monday pain or a Sunday pain that<br>kind of temporal location just shouldn't<br>factor into your preferences if you have<br>that if you share with paet that<br>intuition then you should think that<br>arbitrariness is a bad making feature of<br>preferences and you should think um look<br>if being sensitive to the temporal<br>location of something is being sensitive<br>to something arbitrary then that is a<br>reason not to have those kind of<br>preferences so that is what many<br>philosophers have in fact um<br>argued okay so uh one thing that they're<br>going to say is look um if you're near<br>biased you're really just like Herbert<br>right Herbert has this uh kind of weird<br>proclivities here that he's kind of<br>discounting completely discounting the<br>um Tuesday pain well if you're near<br>biased you're very much like him so um<br>it just turns out that for some reason<br>you care about CS depending on where<br>they are in time right so you you happen<br>to be carrying about ones that are<br>temporally closer rather than temporally<br>far away um but that's that's no<br>different than caring than failing to<br>care about Tuesday pain because there's<br>nothing normatively relevant about how<br>far away something is relative to you in<br>time these things are on a par and so<br>it's arbitrary and so nearby is<br>arbitrary and so it's irrational that's<br>one form of argument that you find<br>philosophers<br>making here's another form of argument<br>look surely what it is to be rational is<br>to want it to be the case that your life<br>goes not worse what whatever else you<br>think rationality might consist in like<br>this seems like a plausible thing to say<br>but what are you doing if you're near<br>biased well you're preferring a future<br>that has more pain and less pleasure<br>right if you weren't near biased it<br>would have less pain because you'd have<br>less pain up front rather than more pain<br>later and you'd have uh more pleasure<br>later rather than less pleasure sooner<br>so what you're doing is you're choosing<br>between multiple ways your life could go<br>there are possible Futures there's a<br>future with more pain and less pleasure<br>and there's a future with uh more<br>pleasure and less pain and you're<br>choosing the former over the latter and<br>how could that not be irrational right<br>sure right that's the thought okay so<br>this a second argument rational people<br>care that their lives go better being is<br>effectively life that goes<br>wor here's another uh related kind of<br>argument that you find which is look as<br>an empirical matter of fact people who<br>are Less near biased who have uh less of<br>a discount function are are richer and<br>healthier and let's just suppose that<br>being rich and healthy is a sort of<br>associated with well-being I mean it's a<br>startling claim but I'm going to go out<br>and a li here so here's what we know<br>people who discount less actually do<br>have higher income they have more<br>savings they make better investment<br>decisions they tend to smoke and take<br>drugs less I that's a bit who knows<br>about that one but uh they have lower<br>levels of obesity and drug drug and<br>alcohol use and other high related uh<br>risk behaviors they also tend to engage<br>in more preventative Healthcare I guess<br>they're doing yoga and generally they<br>have lower levels of mortality like<br>neias kills you people okay so you might<br>think well surely a life that has uh<br>more money and more health is better<br>than one that has less of those things<br>near bias gives you less of those things<br>so here's a pretty good reason to think<br>that you shouldn't be near bias right<br>it's another kind of argument you find<br>so taken in totality these arguments are<br>supposed to tell you that uh near bias<br>is irrational and you should care<br>equally about all these future s and<br>that seems to be Gris to my meal right<br>because I started off by saying uh<br>here's a very plausible thing you should<br>care equally about all of yourselves so<br>so far I'm just um singing to my own<br>choir all right so this might all seem<br>obvious it's clearly not obvious to many<br>people but but here's another case and I<br>think this case pushes in the opposite<br>direction so I want you to imagine that<br>you're waking up in hospital and what<br>you know is that you need a 2hour<br>painful surgery and unfortunately this<br>is one of those surgeries you have to be<br>awake for because you've got to like say<br>stuff like to the left to the right ow<br>um so you wake up and in the moment<br>you're quite groggy so you can't<br>remember if you've just had the<br>operation although the full memory of it<br>is going to come back if you've had it<br>um or if you're about to have it so you<br>see a nurse walk past and you say to him<br>Yo which which predicament am I in right<br>this is a perect case and he goes off to<br>consult some notes and while he's away<br>you Ponder to yourself like do I prefer<br>that when he comes back he tells me that<br>I just had the surgery or that I'm just<br>about to have it and paord says look in<br>this case uh he prefers to find out that<br>he just had the surgery rather than that<br>he's just about to have<br>it and what's more pafford says okay<br>let's tweak the case a little bit<br>everything is exactly the same except<br>that if I already had the surgery it was<br>actually 10 hours long it's the longest<br>surgery that's ever happened for this<br>procedure it was bad if I'm still to<br>have it though it's only going to be 1<br>hour so if I had it it's 10 times worse<br>than if I'm about to have it and here's<br>what pord says I still prefer that when<br>the nurse comes back he tells me I had<br>the past surgery I'd prefer 10 times the<br>amount of pain as long as it's in the<br>past rather than in the future so if<br>this Pro preference turns out to be<br>rational if we think yeah that's the<br>right thing to say then that's also to<br>say that uh you ought not to care about<br>all of yourselves equally right<br>effectively it's to say that you ought<br>to Discount the value of the well-being<br>of past selves relative to Future ones<br>and in this case you actually have to<br>discount them a lot right this is a<br>whopping kind of<br>difference so the question is what what<br>should we make of these kinds of cases<br>okay so when paord uh came up with this<br>case there was in fact no empirical<br>evidence about what people do uh which<br>preferences they have other than you<br>know paord self- ascribing uh however um<br>at the center for time we've done some<br>empirical work and we know that as a<br>matter of fact most people prefer to<br>learn that they had the painful surgery<br>yesterday and they continue to have that<br>preference even when the surgery if they<br>had it yesterday was 10 times longer and<br>more painful right not everyone so this<br>is I mean you never get 100% of people<br>agreeing on anything but um but a<br>majority of people have this kind of<br>preference so palit turns out to be<br>right about this so this preferen is<br>known as future bias future bias is the<br>preference for having good stuff in the<br>future rather than the past and bad<br>stuff in the past rather than the future<br>and again one way of thinking about this<br>is it involves discounting the value of<br>past experiences compared to Future ones<br>which means of course that past bad<br>things are effectively less disvaluable<br>to you relative to Future bad things and<br>future good things are more pleasantly<br>um have more pleasant value than uh past<br>things okay so here's some interesting<br>things about future bias so<br>uh paa went on to say here's something<br>cool um I would definitely have that<br>preference about my own painful and<br>pleasurable experiences oh and people<br>are people are future biased about<br>pleasurable stuff as well um so<br>obviously you can imagine that there's<br>some pleasant thing it can either be in<br>the future or the past where would you<br>prefer it um people prefer it in the<br>future and they continue to prefer it in<br>the future even when it will be less<br>good but pford says here's something uh<br>that seems right to me I don't think I<br>would have that preference about other<br>people's experiences so suppose that I<br>am forming preferences over uh Zach's<br>pains so Zach has to go into hospital<br>he's going to have to have a procedure<br>it can either be 10 hours of pain or 1<br>hour and it can either uh be uh in the<br>can either have been in the past or in<br>the future pford says look uh when I'm<br>forming preferences over the locations<br>of his operation all I care about if I<br>care about Zach is that there's less<br>pain I'm just going to prefer that he<br>has the the less Long operation I'm not<br>going to care where it is and some<br>people think that uh that's some reason<br>to think that future bias is um<br>irrational because they think somehow<br>you're taking a more rational and<br>disinterested uh perspective when you're<br>think about Zach's pains than when<br>you're thinking about your own so this<br>is an interesting uh kind of hypothesis<br>and there was again no data on this so<br>we ran some studies and interestingly it<br>turns out that here uh pafford's<br>intuitions about what people will think<br>in this case turn out not to be<br>Vindicated so he thinks that people are<br>are in fact going to be time neutral<br>that is not future biased about the<br>experiences of other people but it turns<br>out that that's not true they are in<br>fact future biased about other people's<br>experiences as well so if you ask me<br>about Zach's operation I'll say I prefer<br>that he had the 10hour painful procedure<br>yesterday than the 1 hour procedure<br>tomorrow um levels drop off a little bit<br>compared to the first personal case but<br>they're very similar so that's<br>interesting here's another interesting<br>case so um Casper hair runs this case so<br>he says here's another thing that I<br>think might make us think that future<br>bias is irrational so here's the the<br>case that he comes up with he says look<br>uh my wife is going to be unfaithful so<br>I know this but I also know there's<br>nothing I can do about it I think he<br>he's off somewhere in the in the UK<br>anyway he cannot intercede so he says<br>the following I'm not super<br>Keen he says it very much like that uh<br>but look there there's two ways things<br>could have pan out either she's already<br>been unfaithful yesterday or she's going<br>to be unfaithful tomorrow either case<br>the probabilities are the same the<br>downstream consequences are the same the<br>only difference is when it's happening<br>and he says look I'd prefer it didn't<br>happen at all but given that it's going<br>to happen I don't care when it is shag<br>yesterday shag tomorrow it's all the<br>same to me that's not quite what he<br>says okay so he thinks here's something<br>interesting I care about the locations<br>of my pains and Pleasures um but in this<br>case this is not a direct pain or<br>pleasure right I mean it's it's not it's<br>a negatively valenced event but he's not<br>directly experiencing it and he says<br>unlike pains and Pleasures in this case<br>I'm indifferent about where the thing<br>happens so again we were intrigued by<br>this we thought is it true that the<br>regular punter uh shares C and he also<br>makes the claim that he's a man of<br>relatively normal psychology I thought<br>that was also intriguing given that it's<br>Casper hair I thought maybe<br>not would be like me asserting that in a<br>paper so we ran the study we didn't use<br>Unfaithful women um but we used uh other<br>sorts of things like this and<br>interestingly it turns out that Casper<br>is wrong about this too so a majority of<br>people still have future bias<br>preferences when the things in question<br>are uh violence events but not events<br>that you experience directly like for<br>instance um wives being unfaithful to<br>you so people are still future bi<br>they're a little bit less so the the<br>percentages of people come down a little<br>bit less a little bit um but you still<br>get these future bias<br>preferences and so one thing that people<br>had said about this kind of case is um<br>if Casper is right about the way people<br>are this could have been another reason<br>to think that future bias is irrational<br>because you might think why would it be<br>that um you're only future biased about<br>your own uh experiential States but not<br>about other peoples and not about um<br>these kind of non-experiential States<br>but that actually turns out not to be<br>the case people do have future bias so<br>if future bias is irrational it's all<br>over the place right it's across uh<br>third person first person and it's<br>across various different kinds of things<br>and um here's something further so you<br>might think look lots of people are<br>future biased but of course that doesn't<br>mean they think they should be right so<br>we all do things that we think are not<br>the best things for us right that's a<br>sad thing about Prudence so it could be<br>or could have been that people feel<br>people people feel people feel the pool<br>of being future biased but on reflection<br>they think to themselves this is not a a<br>rational thing to be right so again we<br>ran another study in which we tried to<br>probe not only what preferences people<br>have but what preferences they think<br>they should have so is being like this<br>permissible and in fact is it even<br>obligatory and here's what we find all<br>of the people who are future biased<br>think not only that it's permissible but<br>also that it's obligatory<br>they think you should prefer more pain<br>in the past to Less in the future and if<br>you're not like that something bad's<br>wrong with you right so this is really<br>interesting too that people make these<br>kind of normative judgments so there's a<br>kind of interesting puzzle here which is<br>on the one hand when we think about near<br>bias philosophers and almost univocally<br>and economists AB with respect to<br>certain kinds of discount function all<br>think that that kind of preference is<br>irrational on the other hand uh when<br>people think about future bias um<br>ordinary non-philosophers typically um<br>have that preference and they typically<br>think it's obligatory and what's more we<br>find that a majority of philosophers<br>agree with them right so uh you have<br>this kind of petitioning in which<br>philosophers are thinking that near bias<br>is bad but future bias is at least<br>permissible and possibly obligatory so<br>when I learned this I was mly puzzled<br>because it seemed at least on the face<br>of it you might think look the same<br>kinds of arguments apply in both cases<br>so near you know the arguments against<br>nearby proceed by um someone noting that<br>it seems like the temporal location of<br>something isn't normatively relevant you<br>shouldn't be sensitive to it so you're<br>forming arbitrary<br>preferences um and the same seems to be<br>true in the case of future bias right<br>you're just forming preferences over<br>different things in time so if location<br>in time doesn't matter why would future<br>bias be rational what's more in the case<br>of near bias you're preferring a worse<br>life over a better life well in the case<br>of future bi you have the same<br>preference right you're you're<br>preferring a life that overall has<br>considerably more pain to that has less<br>so long as of course the pain is you<br>know in the past rather than the future<br>but why should that be rational so I was<br>puzzled I was like there surely these<br>two things should stand off all together<br>what's going on<br>here so so far the what I want to do in<br>kind of introducing this future by stuff<br>is to push back a little bit against the<br>idea that it might seem obvious that you<br>should care equally about all yourselves<br>because if I gave you those cases you<br>were thinking yeah I I would prefer the<br>past operation that's much longer and<br>what's more I should prefer that then it<br>seems like um you do think that future<br>bias is at least permissible and so you<br>do think you should treat different<br>selves differently so why might that be<br>so is there one way to think about this<br>is is there any ground that could make<br>it the case that near bias is irrational<br>and future bias is rational right if if<br>that's the kind of intuition people have<br>what could ground that being true so<br>here's one possibility uh some people<br>have thought that look it's obvious you<br>should prefer painful experiences to be<br>in the past because then then they're<br>quote over and done with they're somehow<br>receding away from you as opposed to if<br>they're in the future they're like<br>coming towards<br>you and one way people have tried to<br>sort of press this idea is in terms of<br>some kind of picture about the nature of<br>time itself so the thinking here is look<br>there's a way that time could be such<br>that time really does uh pass and flow<br>so on this kind of picture of time uh<br>there's a fact of the matter about which<br>events really are genuinely present<br>namely it's these ones but now it's<br>these ones no now it's these ones right<br>so as time passes different events<br>become the really objectively present<br>ones and that makes in that there are<br>kind of absolute non-perspectival fact<br>about which events really are past and<br>which really are future this is not just<br>a subjective matter and so the thought<br>is that on this kind of model of time<br>things really are in the objective past<br>and so something about them being in the<br>past rather than the future makes it the<br>case that it's rational to Discount<br>their<br>value okay so uh one thing to say here<br>is that um this model of time is false<br>so that's not super helpful but even if<br>it and that's something that I um you<br>know mostly argue for but even setting<br>that aside let's let's go with it let's<br>just suppose maybe the world is like<br>that even though it's<br>not um it's still super hard to see why<br>that justifies discounting the value of<br>the past right suppose there's an<br>objective fact about things really being<br>past rather than future why should that<br>fact alone even if it obtains make it<br>rational for me to care less L about<br>those past things compared to those<br>future ones right I just I fail to be<br>moved by why that would be the case so<br>maybe this is a kind of failure of<br>imagination so that doesn't seem right<br>here's a better way of having a go uh<br>that's an actual argument as to why that<br>can't be right so I want us to imagine<br>that we have access to a time machine<br>it's going to take you back in time and<br>deliver you to the past so when you get<br>in the machine you're going to be in the<br>machine for two hours and you're just<br>ordinary personal time you're going to<br>have a tea and some cookies<br>biscuits uh and the flight it's going to<br>take this 2 hours of du your time and<br>you're going to arrive 300 years into<br>the<br>past all right so now here's the thing<br>you need to know so tomorrow there's<br>going to be a a dental<br>event if you and you have two options<br>you can travel uh Back In Time by<br>leaving tomorrow or you can leave the<br>day after so if you travel tomorrow then<br>the dental event that's going to before<br>you is going to happen once you reach<br>the<br>past now the good news about this is<br>that uh when you're in the time machine<br>it has certain kinds of pressures so it<br>changes your mouth in various ways which<br>makes the underlying Badness of the<br>dental event significantly less bad than<br>it would have been had you not been in<br>the time machine on the other hand you<br>are 300 years in the past and so um<br>Dental Pro you know dental anesthetics<br>and dental procedures are just way less<br>good and so the procedure itself will be<br>much more<br>painful alternatively uh if you don't<br>travel tomorrow you travel the day after<br>and Swit case you'll just have the<br>dental procedure tomorrow like the<br>dental emergency will arise and you'll<br>go off to the dentist and in that case<br>um the underlying condition will be<br>significantly worse but the procedure<br>and the technology will be much better<br>so here's what's going to happen either<br>you depart tomorrow and you'll have<br>three hours of painful procedure in the<br>past or you depart the day after<br>tomorrow and you th have three hours of<br>painful procedure in the future tomorrow<br>and again I want us to hold other things<br>fixed so you might be worried about<br>sepsis by having your operation in the<br>past right using their dodgy um<br>sanitized things okay they're super<br>careful back there like there you know<br>and there's no chance so what whatever<br>the risk of that arises from this dental<br>procedure it's the same whether you have<br>it tomorrow or 300 years ago good news<br>Okay so suppose this feel about time is<br>correct and suppose that the fact that<br>something is in the objective past makes<br>it rational to Discount its value then<br>what should you prefer with respect to<br>when you travel in time well you should<br>absolutely have a preference here and<br>you should prefer that you go tomorrow<br>because if you go tomorrow then the<br>procedure you undergo is 300 years ago<br>it's in the objective past and<br>consequently the three hours of pain is<br>worth less pain than the three hours of<br>pain would be tomorrow right and it<br>doesn't even have to be worth that much<br>less to make that<br>rational so in fact this kind of view<br>which says that you should discount the<br>value of objectively P things says that<br>it's uniquely rational to get into the<br>machine and travel to the past that just<br>strikes me as<br>badshit why why should see seem like the<br>right thing to say here is you should be<br>indifferent between these two options in<br>both cases you're just having 3 hours of<br>painful procedure with the very same<br>kind of risks and<br>rewards now an obvious thing to say at<br>this point is but look what's mattering<br>in these cases is not uh whether the<br>operation is in the objective past or<br>the future but ra rather where it is<br>kind of in my subjective time so in both<br>of these cases you might think there's<br>something about the surgery which is<br>kind of future directed in both of these<br>cases I can anticipate the surgery from<br>my current perspective right whether<br>it's 300 years ago or whether it's<br>tomorrow and in both of these cases I'm<br>not having a memory of the surgery<br>already having happened so it's causally<br>Downstream from where I am and you might<br>think that that's the thing that makes<br>it the case that we should be<br>indifferent across those two options and<br>I agree that is the thing that's playing<br>the relevant role here but what that<br>tells you is that whether things are in<br>the objective past or the objective<br>future that can't be doing work right<br>that's not what matters so it can't be<br>that a future bias is uh rational that<br>what grounds its rationality is some<br>substantive feature about the nature of<br>temporality itself this case just shows<br>us<br>that so here's another stab you might<br>have of trying to partition things to<br>make near bias rational and future bias<br>no the other way around near bias<br>irrational and future bias rational so<br>maybe you think the cases aren't<br>analogous because you think look here's<br>a thing we can do with near bias we can<br>do trading between the near future and<br>the far future I can spend all my money<br>now and not save any in super well I<br>can't because the government's not going<br>to let me but in you know uh I can make<br>it the case that I have uh less of a<br>good thing now rather than more of a<br>good thing later by spending now and not<br>saving right that's a trade I can<br>actually do but whatever pait's uh<br>preferences are with respect to the<br>location of his operation there's<br>nothing he can do to make it the case<br>that he had a 10-hour surgery yesterday<br>right either he had it or he didn't and<br>uh so he's not in a position to kind of<br>act on that preference so maybe if think<br>that future biased preferences therefore<br>don't matter the way that near biased<br>ones are because you can't make yourself<br>worse off by acting on them so first<br>thing to say there is that even if that<br>were true it's hard to see how that<br>could license future bias being uh<br>rational right the mere fact that you<br>can't act on a preference and bring<br>about the bad outcome doesn't seem to<br>suggest that the preference is in fact<br>um rationally obligatory to have that<br>preference like that would be a weird<br>view but also think it's just false that<br>future bias preferences don't have an<br>impact on us and here's why so uh first<br>case so this is uh Annie again but when<br>she's like about seven months old and<br>this is Freddy on the left uh her little<br>brother so uh we bought Annie this is<br>not the toy we bought her it's kind of a<br>weird looking toy but in the example<br>we're supposed to imagine that we buy a<br>chew toy for the dogs uh but they can't<br>both chew the toy at the same time<br>because that's clearly going to lead to<br>like some bad stuff uh and the toy is<br>very robust so whenever you chew it you<br>get the same amount of utility right<br>it's not it's not one of these two toys<br>that kind of degrades it's it's got It's<br>very this actual one is not but the the<br>imaginary one's very robust so they have<br>to decide between them who choose first<br>and who choose second you get to chew<br>for an hour so Freddy is future biased<br>and he reasons as follows look if I chew<br>first then after I finish chewing I'll<br>have to sit here and watch Annie chew<br>for an hour and I'll be watching all<br>this future chewing happening and I'll<br>be thinking that could have been me<br>right and my past chewing is now worth<br>less to me than the future chewing is so<br>I'll be thinking well this is a I should<br>have chosen to chew second I'll have a<br>lot of regret so he thinks he reasons<br>through this and so he thinks I should<br>prefer to chew second in this scenario<br>what's more he thinks actually I should<br>pay something to get to chew second so<br>I'm actually prepared to pay three<br>minutes of chew time I'm prepared to<br>chew for only 57 minutes to make it the<br>case that I chew second so I don't<br>experience that regret of having chewed<br>first so notice that none of this<br>requires that Freddy can change anything<br>about the past he's not um you know<br>bringing it about that some operation<br>was yesterday nevertheless it's<br>affecting his behavior it's a it's<br>affecting when he wants to chew but it's<br>also making it the case that he will<br>settle for a smaller temporal allowance<br>of chewing in order to get to chew<br>second so his future bias preferences<br>are in fact um making an<br>impact here's the second case so this is<br>a case from Megan Sullivan we're<br>supposed to imagine Carrie who is into<br>the CrossFit craze this is what you get<br>if you Google CrossFit cuz I didn't know<br>what it was so Carrie has decided that<br>as part of her CrossFit craze craze uh<br>she's going to do 45 minutes of hard<br>workout every day and she's decided that<br>45 it has to be 45 minutes of suffering<br>to kind of count as um fulfilling her<br>goal so it's uh one of these days she's<br>uh done a lot of workout she stops after<br>45 minutes for a brief moment to reflect<br>on whether she's done enough of a<br>workout but she reasons as follows well<br>I'm future biased I did do 45 minutes of<br>workout but the suffering is now all in<br>the past but 45 minutes of past<br>suffering is not actually 45 minutes of<br>suffering because I'm discounting the<br>value of past suffering so I definitely<br>haven't suffered for 45 minutes in fact<br>if I discount the value of the past<br>altogether I haven't suffered at all so<br>she thinks oh man haven't achieved my<br>goal I better do a bit more right and<br>depending on how much she discounts the<br>past that's going to determine how much<br>more CrossFit she has to do and you<br>might think whoa no wait that that is<br>some whacked out reasoning right she's<br>she of course she's done her 45 minutes<br>okay so if you think that then you think<br>that there's something wrong with that<br>kind of future biased reasoning and that<br>might give you reason um to think that<br>irrational okay so um these are some<br>considerations that I think bear on this<br>idea that it's not the case that um<br>there's some obvious disanalogy between<br>near bias and future bias such that you<br>can preserve the idea that um near bias<br>is um irrational and future bias is<br>rational here's something so here's<br>another stab at something you might say<br>so one of my colleagues uh psychologist<br>at UCLA has a kind of psychological<br>explanation for near bias uh future bias<br>which uh borrows heavily from um James<br>and Heather's paper so they have this<br>very nice um paper a while back which<br>kind of set the agenda here which is BAS<br>basically given a kind of evolutionary<br>explanation for why you might expect<br>creatures to have future bias and uh<br>various psychologists since then have<br>kind of taken up the idea of trying to<br>figure out what the psychological<br>mechanisms the the kind of synchronic<br>mechanisms are that could ground that<br>being the case so the evolutionary story<br>very roughly go something like this look<br>we have both attention and affect um<br>centers and you might expect that<br>evolved creatures will do better when<br>they tend to attend more to Future stuff<br>over past stuff right so uh causation is<br>asymmetric we can causally influence the<br>future but not the past so it seems to<br>uh follow that we ought to attend more<br>to what's going on at Future times than<br>past times because at Future times there<br>are things that could eat me at past<br>times I've either been eaten in which<br>case it's a mute question right or it's<br>or I escaped them at Future times there<br>are things I can eat but in the past<br>I've already eaten future times there<br>are things I can mate with etc etc right<br>so I should be attending more towards<br>the future stuff likewise you might<br>think the effective system is there to<br>go to motivate us and I should be<br>motivated differentially towards the<br>future rather than the past because<br>after all the future is full of things<br>that I can eat or or and of things that<br>I need to avoid eating me and so on so<br>we'd expect there to be a kind of<br>asymmetry of affect and emotion and<br>what's more we know that um there are in<br>fact sort of psychological measures of<br>these things so we know that when people<br>uh imagine things as past as opposed to<br>imagining them as future that um they<br>are in fact imagined to be less<br>effectively um arousing when they're<br>imagined as past relative to Future<br>right and so the thought here is that uh<br>both of these things are playing a role<br>here and in fact um they're kind of<br>bootstrapping one another up because the<br>more you attend to something the more<br>affect you tend to generate and vice<br>versa and then the thought is look um<br>this is then explaining why people are<br>future biased because uh things that you<br>attend to attend to and that tend to be<br>more um affect inducing tend to be<br>things that you are kind of drawn<br>towards that you more highly value<br>either positively value or or or<br>negatively value right so it's very<br>likely that we're going to um attach<br>more value to Future things than past<br>things and then there's going to be a a<br>much more nuanced kind of psychological<br>story about the mechanisms for that<br>which I won't go into so here's a<br>thought you might have though which is<br>well in that case you might expect that<br>um creatures who are future biased will<br>in fact do better in various ways right<br>because after all future Bice is the<br>product of these kind of attention and<br>affect systems and those are adaptations<br>which are going to make us um perform<br>better so that's a uh an interesting<br>idea and in fact at the center for time<br>we were kind of interested in the<br>connection<br>between uh future bias and well-being so<br>we ran another batch of studies like<br>what what if anything is the association<br>there and it turns out that um contrary<br>to what I was imagining uh you do in<br>fact get a positive Association so<br>people who are future biased on a on<br>some range of measures of well-being do<br>actually have higher well-being and you<br>might think well we've got a nice<br>explanation for that it's because those<br>people have these kind of attention and<br>affect systems that are even more<br>directed towards the future than the<br>past and that gives you certain kinds of<br>well-being benefit so you can imagine<br>someone thinking well in that case<br>there's a kind of a reason to be future<br>biased right there's this kind of<br>relationship between future bias and<br>well-being so we don't just have an<br>evolutionary story we have a kind of<br>rationalizing story I think that's not<br>right either so let's imagine that it's<br>the case that um getting super fit um<br>massively increases your well-being I'm<br>sure this is false let's imagine it's<br>true and let's also suppose that it<br>makes you go green because uh engaging<br>in this really heavy duty fitness<br>program releases this green<br>melanin so as you walk around you can<br>see that people have really high bulbing<br>because they're like glowing at<br>you okay so do you have a reason to be<br>green well there's certainly a<br>correlation an association between being<br>green and having high well-being right<br>but it seems like the right thing to say<br>is not that you have a reason to be<br>green for suppose I gave you a button<br>and you could just press the button and<br>all the melan in you would and you would<br>be released and poof you you'd be green<br>but doesn't seem like you have a reason<br>to do that because after all greenness<br>is only kind of an indication of<br>well-being in so far as it goes via this<br>um uh physical fitness thing right<br>merely being green in and of itself<br>doesn't promote well-being so you don't<br>really have a reason to be green per se<br>rather you have a reason to go to the<br>gym and um have this you know super fit<br>theme going on and as a kind of causal<br>by product that will turn you green<br>fortunately or unfortunately depending<br>on how you think of these things so I<br>think future bias is like that so uh<br>there are these adaptations of affect<br>and emotion and you do better<br>unsurprisingly if you kind of um<br>differentially attend to the future<br>rather than the past and that does<br>causally often make it the case that<br>people are future biased but it's not<br>one and the same thing you can be future<br>biased without having that pattern of<br>attention and affect and you can have<br>that pattern of attention and effect<br>without being future biased and there<br>doesn't seem to be any reason to be<br>future biased per se merely bringing it<br>about that you have those preferences<br>that's not going to increase your<br>well-being right um what increases your<br>well-being is going to be something to<br>do with attention and affect so I don't<br>think that this gives us any reason to<br>think that um future bi is rational so<br>where does that leave us so uh it looked<br>as though we have these kind of<br>intuitions which suggest that um people<br>find Future bias very compelling and<br>they often think that it's um rational<br>perhaps even obligatory and if it is<br>then we should in fact treat various<br>different selves differentially right we<br>shouldn't care equally we should not we<br>should not be caring about past selves<br>as much as future<br>ones and I've tried to find something<br>that might ground it being the case that<br>that's the right picture but I just<br>don't think there is anything I think<br>the right thing here is to say is if<br>being sensitive to temporal location is<br>arbitrary because that's not normatively<br>relevant then we shouldn't be near<br>biased and we shouldn't be future biased<br>either because temporal location doesn't<br>matter and there's no difference between<br>past and<br>future uh that is different in kind to<br>the difference between near future and<br>Far Future and so these two things stand<br>together and what I think the right<br>thing to say is not that you should be<br>both although that would be one way of<br>going rather I think the right thing to<br>say is that you should be neither you<br>should in fact when I give you the<br>bucket of well-being you should be<br>Distributing it Distributing it evenly<br>rather than for instance giving it all<br>to your future selves rather than your<br>past selves and that's it thanks<br>thank you very much uh so we have some<br>time for questions if you have a<br>question please put your hand up and our<br>bton there is a philosopher who approves<br>of having a hyperbolic discount rate and<br>thinks it plays an important role in<br>human life it's David<br>Hume uh I I could tell you more about<br>that but that's not what I'm really<br>going to get into right<br>so um uh the<br>uh question so does it actually have to<br>be<br>hyperbolic<br>uh he thinks that uh uh discount rate<br>declines over time yes that that it<br>should it does and it's a good thing<br>that it<br>does but so he's actually against<br>exponential disconn like he thinks we<br>should discount and what's more we<br>should discount I just want to get clear<br>we should it should be hyperbolic it's<br>not that it's okay it's not that any<br>discount function is fine so hyperbolic<br>is fine it's that we actually should be<br>hyperbolically<br>discounting or presely he doesn't maybe<br>he doesn't he's not quite so<br>prescriptive he thinks that it is in<br>some ways fortunate for us that we do<br>this right what's the what's<br>thees us sorry sorry why why so why yeah<br>why is it fortunate oh because um in the<br>short term um suppose you know something<br>is bad for you in the long term but good<br>for you in the short term right you know<br>like he's thinking of a criminal act<br>right yep yep yep um and um if it's<br>happening right now um then uh because<br>you know you get a short-term increase<br>in your welfare and you you're you you<br>you you you don't have a discount rate<br>you're inclined to do the criminal thing<br>right okay now you're looking forward<br>right into the future Y and you're<br>thinking of what kind of Institutions<br>you will use to structure your<br>preferences and govern your behavior yep<br>then<br>because when you're thinking of your<br>future decisions the fact that you'll um<br>you know let's 6 months from now I could<br>get a big buzz of doing a criminal act<br>but then there's the longer term bad<br>consequences of it so I will be in favor<br>of<br>Institutions which um don't allow me to<br>do<br>that right that's that's the<br>model anyway but that's not what I was<br>follow that reasoning did you follow<br>that reasoning<br>it's you're not even getting but that's<br>not what I was going to talk about okay<br>sorry sorry sorry yeah so talk about<br>that later so so that seems like a wild<br>that that story seems wild to me but<br>yeah um so uh but the the the other<br>thing I was going to say is look what's<br>what is it it's a truth maker for claims<br>about something being rational oh<br>God right and I'm not just going to make<br>this like a sort of mean problem right<br>I'm going to make it main problem um<br>which is that um you know there seem<br>various Norms of rationality that people<br>have and people have different though um<br>R Norms of rationality um they're<br>prescribed by economists and various<br>other people so what's makes one Norm of<br>rationality correct and another<br>not well I think in a way there is no<br>direct answer to that question but you<br>might say that a norm of rationality is<br>a good Norm of rationality<br>if it tends to promote survival and<br>flourishing in a me members of the<br>species yep then we've got a root right<br>from uh these affects you know these<br>future biased aects that you want to<br>Discount to claiming that they are<br>actually rational because what makes a<br>norm of rationality a good Norm of<br>rationality is if people follow that<br>Norm of rationality and um you know it's<br>good for them as as as as individuals so<br>there you have a a reason for um<br>accepting the future bias as um uh uh as<br>a better Norm of rationality than the<br>others there's your truth maker or<br>potential truth maker and that's going<br>to endorse that Norm of rationality<br>rather than one you<br>suggest okay good so so the first<br>setting hum asde uh so there there's<br>this question like what makes things<br>rational<br>so that I personally do not want to take<br>a stand on so all of this I guess is um<br>against a backdrop of taking on some<br>stuff that my interlocutors typically<br>assume so obviously there's various<br>views you could have here you could be<br>kind of humean about um preferences and<br>rationality and think that there are<br>kind of there are there aren't really<br>substantive constraints on rationality<br>right there's just the preferences you<br>have and whether they can hear in the<br>right You Know instrumental sort of way<br>and most of of the people in this<br>dispute uh think that there's something<br>more substantive right so pait and all<br>these other people are taking it for<br>granted that there's some kind of<br>normative wolf here so everything I want<br>to say is something like conditional on<br>you thinking that here's the sorts of<br>things you should think okay so uh I<br>just want to put that out there because<br>I don't want to make it sound like I<br>actually think that there are these um<br>Buffy normative constraints but if there<br>if there were then I think something<br>like arbitrariness might be um one of<br>them okay so then the your thought is<br>look um here's a plausible thing you<br>might think which is uh things that make<br>you do better for some for some way of<br>catching that out um are things that<br>rather<br>right right uh and I guess the question<br>then is going to be how we it's going to<br>be in the devil and the detail right so<br>in the case of future bias and these<br>patterns of attention and AFF effect so<br>we can all agree that you do better if<br>you have those kind of adaptations so<br>you attend and you affect in those ways<br>uh and we can agree that in this world<br>those things tend to be causally<br>associated with being future biased so<br>the question is but does that um is that<br>going to ground there being a norm of<br>rationality that says that future bias<br>itself is rational and I guess I'm<br>thinking that the case of the green<br>people is supposed to try and undermine<br>that idea which is that no look the the<br>norm of rationality says whatever you<br>know what's going to become rational<br>just is having those kinds of um<br>attentional proclivities or whatever but<br>it doesn't make being future biased<br>rational just because it's a kind of<br>causal Downstream um result in some<br>people of having those kinds of<br>things we've got other people in the so<br>well Charles and I can talk about take<br>it up over dinner yes very<br>good but I agree that's an interesting<br>it's a thing I have tried to pursue not<br>because I want to vindicate future bias<br>but um K thanks<br>um I wonder if you face this question a<br>lot um when when you're collecting data<br>about future discounting I wonder if<br>people continue to entertain an<br>irrational hope about the possibility of<br>change in the future event as in they<br>don't really Pi um correctly construe<br>this will definitely happen it seems to<br>me very human to um when we're told for<br>example you either get the<br>$100 um right now or the $80 in the<br>future to also add a variable Anything<br>could happen over the next two days<br>before this $80 comes in it might be<br>anti speaking slightly more economic<br>terms it might be low a low possibility<br>or probability but the effect size is<br>near infinite therefore some very low<br>probability T times some massively large<br>number for example the infinite could be<br>the negative doesn't happen or um the<br>money is absolutely life-changing and<br>all my Hons go through the roof um I<br>think so my question is yeah do do it<br>seems to me intuitive that people are<br>not going to fully remove that<br>possibility because that's part of human<br>reasoning they're go they're going<br>to assume that an event in the future is<br>something they have agency over changing<br>or uncertain events might occur before<br>it does yeah look I mean I think that's<br>a that's a fair question I mean all<br>questions are fair but that's a good<br>question um so I think all of this<br>research is going to be um held hostage<br>to some extent to the fact that you're<br>dealing with people who might not take<br>on board all the stipulations of the<br>things that you're saying and that's<br>going to be true kind of across the<br>board for all of this kind of thing so<br>you know you're trying to factor out<br>various things including you know<br>probability and difference in you know<br>payoffs and how much you value the thing<br>at the time and so on so forth and in<br>fact you have to in what you want is to<br>actually Factor everything out right you<br>want to hold all else equal but that's<br>actually super difficult and in some in<br>some cases it seems very unnatural to<br>hold all else is fixed so there's always<br>a danger that whenever you're running<br>these kind of studies you're not getting<br>the kind of clean data you might hope<br>because it could be that people are are<br>in fact not holding fixed that the<br>probabilities are exactly the same which<br>is kind of what you're worried about but<br>there's other things they might um you<br>know not hold fixed they might worry<br>that by the time the future like maybe<br>Annie thinks well by the time 3 months<br>rolls around maybe I won't value balls<br>anymore I mean that's crazy obviously<br>she would never think that but she could<br>so um yeah look I agree I mean I think<br>it's all it's going to be always very<br>hard in experimental research to um try<br>and uh do the study in such a way that<br>you really do hold all those factors<br>fixed best I guess the best we can do is<br>try and find vignettes that are<br>sufficiently plausible where you kind of<br>can stipulate in a in what looks like a<br>kind of plausible way that people are<br>fairly certain that the things are going<br>to happen at the relevant time and<br>they're going to still value them but of<br>course you're right that um some people<br>might be thinking well nothing's ever<br>you know maybe there maybe the Earth<br>will blow up tomorrow or something um I<br>sort of Doubt though that that's maybe<br>that's playing some roong I kind of<br>doubt that the um that's a full<br>explanation that people are in fact time<br>neutral but that they're always doing<br>this thing um just because there are so<br>many studies with you know kind of<br>robust findings um but it certainly I<br>would be surprised if it wasn't playing<br>some roll so it may well be that people<br>are not as time biased in various ways<br>as it looks like because they actually<br>sensitive to perfectly rationally<br>available proper considerations like<br>probability because there's a flip side<br>which I thought you might end up caught<br>on Morton's Fork here that if you if you<br>do say you want to construct a real<br>situation then um I don't think you can<br>I think many people would say you<br>couldn't eliminate the sense of the<br>subjective experience ey in a given<br>moment um you know even if they're not<br>moving forwards through time because<br>that's not the theory of time we're<br>following you know that that sense of<br>there is just Perpetual now wherever we<br>happen to be<br>located in time you know the ony instead<br>of the metaphysics so I'm not really<br>seeing what role that plays so like uh<br>you asked me to form preferences over so<br>there's a machine that dos out food and<br>I'm held hostage somewhere I'm work for<br>a company are us um so they won<br>let me leave the building so I have to<br>eat if I'm going to eat I have to eat<br>the um meals from that um vending<br>machine the vending machine is kind of<br>cutting so when I go up it can kind of<br>read my taste at that very moment and<br>figure out either what I like or what I<br>don't like so we can be sure that the<br>food it gives me either has whatever the<br>food is like I don't need to know what<br>my preferences will be the food that I<br>get will either be tasty to this amount<br>or untasty to this amount right I don't<br>need to have a view about what I like in<br>the future I can either have you know um<br>in two days a meal that is um untasty to<br>20 points or you know however we going<br>to kind of spell it out or in four days<br>one that's untasty to 40 points seems<br>like I can for<br>obviously this is not factoring<br>everything out um right but things like<br>that seems like they can factor out um<br>some aspects of the things that you're<br>kind of worried about and I'm not sure<br>what the being located<br>now problem is sorry we can yeah we move<br>along in the questions but good next<br>question here oh Ki um I'm a counseling<br>psychologist so I'm just I'm bringing it<br>to some kind of application yeah um<br>which is very interesting philosophy was<br>my minor um but I'm just thinking about<br>the success of working with people who<br>see a future<br>self and they move now and in the near<br>future because the future self is based<br>on values that they have so they will<br>slip they will spin off the line of<br>being with their future self but it<br>actually helps keep them on track so<br>actually having a bias for future self<br>can be actually quite therapeutic<br>if that self is not it's not ideal or<br>perfect but it's my best self so we can<br>make decisions in the Here and<br>Now with that person in mind which is US<br>does that make sense uh so I don't think<br>uh I'm still I think I'm not completely<br>seeing why uh why nearby is helping them<br>here right so I see that they're kind of<br>projecting forward they're seeing<br>themselves close by and themselves like<br>fur away and presumably they're seeing<br>one thing I I assume you're gesturing<br>towards here is the idea that the nearer<br>selves are more like them they they<br>they're more confident they share their<br>values and so forth than like the far<br>distant sort of<br>selves but aiming for that future self<br>with the values that matter to me can<br>keep me on track so a bias towards<br>future s could be actually very helpful<br>I see so you're not this is not the<br>defense of nearby us this is Def fure<br>bias bi<br>uh right yeah so you might you might<br>think that sort of connects to the stuff<br>on attention and affect in a way that um<br>uh attending to and feeling motivated<br>towards your future selves has various<br>good making features of which that is<br>one whereas doing the same of your past<br>selves maybe doesn't because there's<br>nothing you can do about them for a<br>start um and if things went badly then<br>you're just ruminating on the Badness of<br>the things that you know and if things<br>went well that's great but that's not<br>going to help you yeah uh yeah so that<br>that might very well be true um and uh<br>yes so we've got some work using those<br>kind of zimbardo scales of like past and<br>future orientation I think that's really<br>interesting so I think you might be<br>right about that so I guess there's an<br>interest kind of comes back to one of<br>Charles's question which is does the<br>fact that having that profile of sort of<br>attending to and thinking about your<br>future selves in a way that you don't<br>think about your past selves does that<br>make it then rational to as it were in<br>some other sense kind of care about them<br>differently if you did have if if you<br>had clients and suppose you actually did<br>have a bucket of well-being in your<br>office so they come in and like you<br>actually can give it to them and they<br>can disseminate it let's grant that they<br>really should be they do better by kind<br>of looking forward and kind of thinking<br>about how their lives they want their<br>lives to go and planning and stuff and<br>not looking back but do you want them<br>when you give them the bucket to just<br>give the well-being to all their future<br>selves like these I guess these<br>questions come apart and I'd be<br>interested to hear what you think about<br>the latter if you really did have the<br>bucket<br>well they have to have compassion about<br>the trauma and the things that they also<br>got wrong so the wellbeing would be<br>distributed okay but it's about the aim<br>aim is for future self got it yeah so<br>I'm I'm totally down with that so it's<br>interesting so I like what you said<br>there about the trauma so you might<br>think yeah look of course we want to<br>distribute the well-being back there as<br>well because after<br>all that that was them and there's<br>motivation to want to care about them in<br>a maybe in a maybe the um directedness<br>is a little differently but never less<br>so you want to care yeah so I think<br>yeah thanks for the talk um I found a<br>kind of disjunction between what people<br>want and well-being sort of going back<br>and forth um so when I was 15 I wanted<br>to um get a chalupa at every Taco Bell<br>on the west side of Los Angeles I don't<br>know what that is but I'm assuming it's<br>not a good thing to want when you it<br>seems very benign for a 15-year-old boy<br>that's the that's the thing you're<br>describing one of my one of my okay I'm<br>glad to hear that cuz I was getting a<br>bit worried what happened in your<br>childhood but I mean I wouldn't have<br>thought of of that satisfying that<br>preference as contributing significantly<br>to my well-being and I also wouldn't<br>think of that that way now right um so I<br>I have trouble sort of understanding the<br>the sort of ask people what they want um<br>as a way of gauging<br>um well-being bucket<br>distribution now I just want to ask<br>about that yeah so that's a good<br>question so that's another thing that's<br>kind of in the background of all of this<br>is uh it's up for grabs obviously what<br>well-being is for a start so people are<br>working with different Theory like you<br>know some of them are coming from a<br>desire satisfaction Place others are<br>coming from a kind of objective list<br>place so there's going to be a dispute<br>about like what the well-being itself<br>consists in and so of course it's going<br>to be the case that if you have an<br>objective list Theory it's not going to<br>be that just getting what you want is<br>thereby getting well-being so I take it<br>the people in this debate um whatever<br>what they do agree about is like like<br>whatever well-being is it's the thing<br>that um you should be rationally<br>promoting and then I guess the thought<br>is that um it seems like with future<br>bias and near bias that uh given that<br>you're forming preferences over the same<br>thing but simply at different times or<br>the same kind of thing but just like<br>more of it at one time or another that<br>if that thing has some constitutive<br>connection to well-being like it's a<br>pleasure or a pain or a whatever<br>then it seems like uh those preferences<br>uh can be uh rationally evaluated with<br>respect to well-being so you might I<br>don't know exactly what the connection<br>is say between pain and<br>well-being and I don't want to take a<br>stand on that um but it does seem like<br>if you think there's some connection<br>there then it seems plausible that if<br>you're preferring a life with more pain<br>then you are preferring a life with less<br>well-being right if all you're doing is<br>this comparative<br>thing we've got a bunch of interested<br>people and a reception with food food<br>and drink to go to in our future so I'm<br>just try to get a few more questions and<br>then<br>uh thanks very much for your talk um I<br>was intrigued that you said the majority<br>of people have this near preference in<br>relation to to money and that they<br>prefer to have $80 today instead of $100<br>in a year's time and that seems to count<br>against all kinds of savings and<br>investment schemes basically which<br>operate the other way around yeah um but<br>we're we're told that the majority of<br>new zealanders have very poor savings so<br>um the my question though is do you<br>think therefore this um near preference<br>in relation to to money provides a<br>policy justification for compulsory<br>superannuation yes schemes uh may be<br>quite a significant difference between<br>Australia and New Zealand actually you<br>were suggesting your state requires you<br>to save this is not the case so much in<br>New Zealand superation are largely no<br>they're largely voluntary here or not as<br>compulsory certainly as they are in<br>Australia so you think it does these<br>these pref provide a justification for<br>compulsory superannuation schemes uh yes<br>would be the quick answer so I guess the<br>the more texted answer would be<br>something like look on the assumption<br>that I'm right A near bias is irrational<br>and on the assumption that you want your<br>government to kind of create a system<br>that promotes overall well-being in your<br>community and has so you might have the<br>view of course the governments just<br>shouldn't aren't in the business of um<br>interceding in people's lives so you<br>might have a kind of hands-off view<br>which is like this is my house like you<br>can build roads but like don't mess with<br>me so so obviously if you have that view<br>then you might think look near bias is<br>irrational but like that's on you like<br>dude if you want to it up you just<br>go right for it right so that's there's<br>that kind of policy view if you have the<br>view that government should in some<br>sense be kind of trying to promote the<br>well-being of its citizenry then I think<br>yeah that it is an argument for<br>compulsory superannuation which I gather<br>is why Australia has pretty heavy Dy<br>compulsory superannuation because the<br>thought is like people do save and<br>people will save for old age but<br>typically they don't save enough so the<br>problem is not that so people are so<br>nearby that they just don't care at all<br>about their 80-year-old self but uh<br>they're discounting just enough that<br>they're spending just a little bit too<br>much now so they're just not going to<br>have enough you know in old age and<br>that's why you need policies that will<br>yes the there are many psychological<br>costs and delayed gratification so you<br>know brain energy and so on and that<br>would tend to um affect the uh gradient<br>of the discount rate so you do different<br>discount rates apart from hyperbolic<br>yeah the other thing about our<br>expectations of probability in the<br>future um you have to take those into<br>account and there are different models<br>of how you change the reliability of the<br>probability the significance of it and<br>also the other factors you're using to<br>weight that in terms of you know the<br>well-being that loone um how you're<br>going to Define it but um the also<br>looking at the past things there's more<br>mechanisms involved there in the way<br>where renumeration enriching your social<br>contacts in the future because of joint<br>memories um sory lessons all those<br>things have to be modeled in slightly<br>more detail so in modeling the future<br>and the past economists use these BX<br>based models longer ones with feedback<br>so you can incorporate all these factors<br>and balance them up more carefully is<br>that a good framework to use to approach<br>the discounting of<br>time uh yeah okay so there's there's a<br>couple of different couple of things in<br>that okay so I'm going to partition that<br>into two so the first question is kind<br>of about delayed gratification I think<br>it's worth saying something about that<br>because uh all of this kind of nearby<br>literature connects to all that delayed<br>gratification literature and psychology<br>and the kind of um Walter Michelle<br>experiments with the<br>marshmallows uh and people often think<br>that what's going on in those cases is<br>that um what it is to be nearby us is to<br>be is to fa fa to be able to delay<br>gratification right and so there's this<br>rhetoric which is like you've got these<br>kids and that the kids that don't take<br>the that can delay the marshmallow are<br>going to do better etc etc so maybe<br>that's sometimes true uh so I don't want<br>to Hitch my wagon to that idea though so<br>uh there's lots of evidence that uh<br>children when you kind of give them<br>these tasks are differentially able to<br>delay gratification but that can also be<br>uh a sort of response to the environment<br>that they grow up in so some kids are<br>such that it doesn't make sense to delay<br>gratification CU they have very low<br>priors that the thing is going to happen<br>if they do delay right so there's a kind<br>of a probability effect so if you live<br>in an environment where you're kind of<br>um resource poor if you have resources<br>now you should take them now right you<br>should hang around hoping that there are<br>going to be resources later so many of<br>these children in some of these<br>experiments might be acting perfectly<br>rationally and there's this uh there's<br>this rhetoric that um you know there's<br>all these poor children who are eating<br>their marshmallows now and like that's<br>explaining why that they have these poor<br>lives going on and no that may not be<br>what's going on right it's that they're<br>coming from a resource poor environment<br>where of course you eat your<br>marshmallows when they're there right<br>that's the sensible thing to<br>do uh so I think it's worth making that<br>point and that sort of connects to your<br>second thought which is uh all about all<br>of these other kinds of factors right so<br>it's about factors of factoring in<br>probability factors of you know<br>factoring in various causal influences<br>that the past things have had on current<br>you you know memories and so forth so I<br>think all of these factors are going to<br>be important in explaining why people<br>are um actually<br>discounting right but most of this is<br>going to be such that those preferences<br>don't count as nearby as I'm<br>understanding them right so all of those<br>things are going to be sensitive to<br>things like um How likely is this thing<br>how confident am I it's going to happen<br>how much how valuable is it when it gets<br>here what are the downstream causal<br>consequences of it being here rather<br>than there right there's lots of reasons<br>why you might prefer things to be sooner<br>rather than later because they have<br>Downstream consequ like clearly if I'm<br>going to win money I want to win it<br>sooner rather than later because there's<br>all that interest I can get uh if I'm<br>going to become famous I might prefer to<br>become famous sooner rather than later<br>because there's that all that trading on<br>the fame I can do there's no point<br>becoming famous when I'm 87 right what's<br>the seems like that boat has well and<br>truly sailed by then in so far as one<br>ever would want to become like I do not<br>want to become<br>famous um so so I think you're right<br>that the actual the psychological<br>explanation for what people are doing<br>which makes them have refences for where<br>things are is it going to be incredibly<br>complicated it's going to appeal to like<br>zillions of different um factors and I<br>think figuring out what those are is<br>really interesting and important and<br>figuring out which of them are uh<br>rational is also really important but<br>those things are separate to the<br>question I'm interested in which is like<br>what rationality does the mere role of<br>temporal location play right so um<br>that's the thing that I care I mean not<br>the only thing I care about but it's the<br>thing I care about here which is I just<br>want to focus on where it is is where it<br>is a rationality making relevant feature<br>um bearing in mind that these other<br>things likely are we'll ask you what you<br>think when you're<br>87 uh I invite everybody to continue the<br>conversation across the way we have a<br>reception setup in the link stud in the<br>Student<br>Union just follow the crowd but um this<br>has been I think a lovely example of how<br>apparently kind of abstract theoretical<br>consideration ations in the metaphysics<br>of time can directly impinge on<br>questions about superannuation policy um<br>and that's what philosophy is good for<br>so thank you very
