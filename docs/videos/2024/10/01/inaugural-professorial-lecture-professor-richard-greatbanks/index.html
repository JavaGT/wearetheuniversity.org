name is sh Brock and I'm the<br>deputy Vice Chancellor academic and it's<br>my great pleasure to welcome you to this<br>very special occasion to celebrate the<br>promotion of of Richard great Banks to<br>professor at un at the University of<br>atome these lectures are a wonderful<br>opportunity for us to come together and<br>listen to our new professors talk about<br>their profession personal Journeys their<br>research platform and the impact their<br>research has had on<br>others I'd like to welcome colleagues<br>students and friends from across the<br>university and Beyond including cluding<br>those joining us tonight via live<br>stream I'd like to give a special<br>welcome to Richard's wife Joanne great<br>Banks who's here in person to celebrate<br>Richard's success with us all this<br>evening thank you all for<br>coming it's not easy to become professor<br>at the University of atago in order to<br>be promoted to that level candidates<br>need to show that they are outstanding<br>in each of three different categories<br>teaching research and service Professor<br>great Banks has clearly met all three of<br>these<br>criteria so it's an honor and a<br>privilege to congratulate him tonight<br>for that outstanding achievement and I<br>hope you will join me right now in doing<br>the same and I would be clapping very<br>hard right now if I didn't have a<br>tonight

experiences events and<br>challenges that have gone on to shape<br>his interest in these two<br>domains but tonight Richard will not<br>only discuss his research he will also<br>reflect on his academic career to tell<br>us a bit about his own personal journey<br>and about the impact of his research on<br>the profession on his teaching and most<br>importantly on his<br>students but before he

behind Technical and managerial<br>roles Richard moved to Academia and<br>completed his PhD at the University of<br>Manchester in the year<br>2000 shaped by his background in<br>manufacturing and engineering ing<br>management Richard's thesis was entitled<br>performance measurement Ines and<br>operational<br>perspective Richard's research Focus has<br>remained applying business Improvement<br>Concepts techniques and approaches to<br>the problems of real businesses and<br>organizations especially within smmes<br>not for-profit social Enterprise and<br>Health Management<br>in 2005 Richard and Joanne moved to New<br>Zealand and Richard took up a senior<br>lecturer position in the department of<br>management as already stated a promotion<br>to full professor at the University of<br>atago is not a step taken lightly you<br>must excel in all three areas of the<br>role teaching research and service and<br>as has also already been said Richard<br>great Banks has certainly a achieved<br>this over his career as an<br>academic as a leader in research on<br>Performance Management and Leadership<br>Richard seeks to understand the role of<br>lean thinking in business decision<br>decisions sorry and performance in<br>particular in the health sector Richard<br>publishes in the top uh journals in his<br>field and serves on editorial boards as<br>well as co-chairing<br>conferences Professor great Bank not<br>only excels in research but is an<br>experienced and outstanding teacher<br>having taught across all levels<br>Richard's teaching is extremely well<br>received by students he is an excellent<br>communicator and innovator of teaching<br>material having receive received<br>outstanding feedback and teaching<br>accolades across and throughout his<br>teaching<br>career Richard continues to lead course<br>design and development including the<br>most recent new subject design in<br>leadership and management which he is<br>leading for our Masters in Business<br>program Richard has an impressive<br>supervision profile a passionate<br>supervisor of many PhD and DBA students<br>as well as imcom mbuzz MSC Mill and MBA<br>students Professor great Banks's service<br>commitments have been wide Reaching<br>Across the management department the<br>division of Commerce and the<br>university Richard was academic leader<br>for executive programs for 3 years in<br>which time he was responsible for the<br>academic development of the atago MBA<br>program he then sat on his Department's<br>teaching and learning committee and was<br>the com Commerce rep for The Bachelor of<br>Health Science undergraduate degree<br>combined working and operational<br>group at the end of 2017 Richard was<br>appointed associate Dean academic for<br>our division and remained in the role<br>for six years stepping down at the end<br>of last<br>year I had the pleasure of working with<br>Richard in this role first as an h and<br>laterly as a<br>PVC I hugely appreciated and valued the<br>work that Richard did in this role and<br>thoroughly enjoyed working closely with<br>him on various<br>projects as associate Dean academic<br>Richard has repres presented our<br>division on what probably feels like<br>hundreds of committees but namely<br>programs and paper working group The<br>Board of undergraduate studies the<br>academic Integrity advisory committee<br>the co academic Planning Group the<br>Student Success Advisory Group the<br>student advisoring committee exams<br>committee graduate year review panels<br>and the program and Department

Health<br>Alliance leadership team from 2014 to 16<br>and he has also run workshops with<br>industry Partners such as philanthropy<br>New Zealand and ADM<br>instruments now that is just a snippet<br>of the career of Richard great Banks so<br>far and I'm sure we will learn much more<br>this evening from the professor<br>himself as I said I have been very<br>fortunate to work alongside Richard for<br>a number of years and in particular the<br>last year or last year when I uh became<br>uh PVC I worked very closely with<br>Richard in the PVC role and I was hugely<br>appreciative of the support and advice<br>received Richard did an excellent job of<br>helping me with all academic areas to<br>ensure that I was prepared and informed<br>about any university-wide initiatives<br>and that I was a breast of all<br>developments that were happening in our<br>own<br>Division I always knew that I could<br>trust and rely on<br>Richard and I really valued his support<br>and his wisdom Nami<br>Richard in a nutshell I am privileged to<br>work alongside Professor great Banks and<br>I am delighted and privileged to be able<br>to warmly welcome him up here tonight to<br>give his a noral professorial lecture<br>please welcome Professor Richard great<br>Banks<br>namii Cor great Banks taco inua no no my<br>Hari<br>welcome thank you for being here<br>particularly on such a such an evening<br>when I'm sure many of you had to time<br>your run from Commerce without getting<br>too wet I really do appreciate that so<br>thank you<br>uh in putting this presentation this<br>lecture together I've actually found it<br>difficult to separate my<br>industrial background career from my<br>academic career the two are each a<br>product of the other and the person who<br>stands before you today is a product of<br>both those two experiences so I've<br>chosen to present my journey almost uh<br>uh from a perspective of looking at all<br>the different steps that have influenced<br>me and influenced my view of leadership<br>and my view of uh of management and my<br>passion for performance<br>uh should also<br>my there we go that my interpretation of<br>performance is somewhat different to<br>other academic disciplines so when I<br>talk about performance I don't<br>necessarily mean that in a HR way what I<br>mean is the measures and the metrics<br>that are used on a day-to-day basis<br>uh for all the day-to-day activities and<br>how they connect with the objectives the<br>organization so my focus is<br>organizational performance performance<br>and the way that that is developed and<br>put together and utilized by leadership<br>uh I've really come to believe that<br>leadership and performance measurement<br>are inextricably linked to together just<br>as two separate sides of the same coin<br>are linked together uh and so I wish to<br>tonight it's an<br>indulgent activity putting this together<br>and it caught me by surprise I have to<br>say uh by looking at all of these things<br>I've not got that in front of me so I'll<br>just look at the it it's taken me by<br>surprise but by looking at all of these<br>things you you have a unique perspective<br>of almost looking at your career and<br>where you are today from the perspective<br>of<br>distance uh and so that's caught me off<br>guard once or twice as you'll perhaps<br>see later on in the<br>presentation uh I've also looked at i'<br>I'm very fond of looking at Japanese and<br>management techniques for leadership I<br>think they're very Progressive in that<br>way and they also fit with my<br>manufacturing background so I've chosen<br>to look at two things hansai which is a<br>Japanese word for<br>reflection that's about looking at your<br>personal faults and trying to improve<br>and rectify those and also kaizan which<br>is continual Improvement which is<br>something that I've<br>lived all of my career both in industry<br>and also in in<br>Academia and when you put those two<br>Concepts together you have the<br>beginnings of a learning organization<br>and a learning organization is what we<br>should aspire to and so uh I think those<br>important effectively we've got<br>intersecting arcs of my life here we've<br>got<br>different uh influences and different<br>ways of looking at things so uh I I I<br>beginning I was a happy<br>child uh how things change I was the<br>first child to William or Bill as he<br>prefer to be called and Hill M<br>greatbanks an<br>electrician and an office clerk I had a<br>wonderful childhood uh I remember it<br>being safe warm loving<br>nourishing my dad was always making<br>things in his shed he was interested in<br>technology and science and even as a<br>three or four year-old he would try and<br>explain things to myself and my younger<br>brother like magnetism or atoms or<br>different charges AC and DC and the<br>difference between those he was an<br>amazing figure from that<br>perspective my mother was equally<br>amazing she was gifted in the kitchen<br>she was gifted on the sewing machine she<br>made<br>most of her own<br>clothes so I was well looking back from<br>the perspective of indulgence I was I I<br>I realized I was incredibly lucky to be<br>family in August 1971 at the age of<br>36 my father suffered a major<br>aneurism he was admitted into Hospital<br>and he passed away four weeks<br>later at the age of 32 my mother found<br>herself the sole parent of two young<br>boys aged seven and nine and what I<br>remember most about that is the strength<br>that she had the strength to carry on<br>the strength to keep Family Life the<br>same the strength to take on not only<br>her mother's role but the father role as<br>well and that has been I I I realized<br>again looking back that that has been a<br>huge powerful influence on me throughout<br>my life from that early age the the the<br>presence of a strong female a weini<br>TOA is really really important and has<br>been throughout my life and I<br>acknowledge a number of weini to in this<br>room<br>tonight I think it's uh I I I I just<br>age I still wear my dad's watch I have<br>it<br>here I had it fixed a number of years<br>ago uh and I wear it I wear it for<br>special occasions or where I feel I need<br>his strength and occasionally I take him<br>out for a drink as<br>well he used to enjoy his<br>beer so life continued as a three of us<br>for a number of<br>years my mother would eventually meet<br>and<br>marry Brian who was to have a huge<br>effect positive effect on my career and<br>my life in general and I will spend a<br>bit of time explaining that in a<br>second but as I progressed through<br>school I was an unremarkable<br>student looking back I felt somewhat<br>distracted from my secondary school<br>studies and although I was never<br>tested Joanna and I are pretty sure that<br>I have some form of dis dyslexic<br>impairment I left school essentially I<br>left school at 16 essentially with one O<br>level in<br>art that isn't the best career start to<br>me my stepfather Brian was the training<br>manager of British Aerospace chadon a<br>local large Factory near where I lived<br>and he suggested that I apply for a<br>technical<br>apprenticeship I duly complied I went<br>for some uh aptitude tests I had a<br>number of interviews and I was lucky<br>enough to get offered a place on the<br>1978 Co<br>cohort and so I started a working career<br>fitter from my perspective something<br>miraculous happened at that stage all of<br>a sudden when I was faced with working<br>with my hands and then learning about<br>those processes through a college<br>program what I found was that everything<br>just clicked my studies clicked I<br>started to be connected to and enjoy the<br>process of learning to the point where I<br>couldn't get enough about learning about<br>engineering and putting things together<br>and all the things that came with it and<br>so in a word I began to excel at my<br>studies uh even though they were hnd or<br>hnc actually High higher National<br>certificate uh I just enjoyed the<br>process and something blossomed<br>obviously late in life but for me it<br>blossomed and I guess I've never looked<br>back since in that way and that story is<br>evening so I had this passion for<br>engineering and working with my hands<br>and I worked in a large Factory I<br>completed my apprenticeship as an<br>aircraft systems fitter on my 20th<br>birthday the next 9 years I progressed<br>through several shop floor technical<br>supervision and managerial roles in<br>Aerospace and over that time I think I<br>left at about 30 and over that that time<br>that is a very very formulative uh<br>formative period in anyone's life and so<br>that experience really shaped me from<br>boy to man uh and I'm very proud of that<br>so over this time I also was studying<br>part-time one day a week uh Aeronautical<br>Engineering and then I was lucky enough<br>to get onto a part-time uh Bachelor of<br>Science degree in leads which is a<br>different city from Manchester about an<br>hour and a half away uh and so over this<br>time I I was continuing my education as<br>well as the other four days of the week<br>working in a large Factory in various<br>what we have here is some Snippets of<br>that factory I don't want to spend too<br>long on these but this is the typical<br>environment that I grew up in here we've<br>got fuses being made that's the typical<br>process of making one there was a<br>factory with many Fus lares and wings<br>and once they were complete at that<br>factory the wings and the fards got<br>shipped by Road 60 miles to a different<br>Factory so a British Aerospace had two<br>very close factories I was uh I I was uh<br>I had positions in both of them as we'll<br>see the second Factory was in South<br>Manchester this is Woodford uh the<br>aircraft that you see there has got a<br>special place in well many people's<br>hearts but that is uh an aircraft called<br>an ATP Advanced turbo prop doesn't<br>really matter what it is except that it<br>was the very first one that this company<br>had made and the pressure<br>and the intensity of that process and<br>this is where the Arc of my life comes<br>in I was just happened to be at the same<br>place at the same time as that project<br>and as someone who was on a management<br>development sort of trajectory I got<br>roped in along with many other people<br>that was literally 12 14 16 hour days<br>sometimes in the factory working on all<br>the things that happened there<br>so we would have uh we would have lots<br>of things going on and that's that's it<br>moving into what we call finals which is<br>the final fitting phase of that before<br>it went to flight sheds and it then flew<br>off and went through testing so again<br>that's the second Factory and that's the<br>exactly the environment that I spent<br>many years in that's the the same<br>aircraft is the white one that you see<br>above that's when it was finished and<br>rolled out set one as we used to call<br>it and basically it was that's how it<br>looked and that's what the process<br>was I re I<br>remember having to go in at 7:30 in the<br>morning and have a meeting with uh a<br>whole host of people in terms of<br>progress of what was done overnight what<br>was done the following day incredibly<br>pressured there would be the Airline<br>customer who was waiting for that<br>product sat there listening there would<br>be the CEO sat there listening and it<br>was a very intense cauldron of all those<br>things<br>happening one of the things that<br>happened whilst I was at that factory I<br>got seced to uh I got seced to a<br>customer Improvement performance team I<br>went I got a call one morning to go into<br>the ATP executive office I went there<br>and one tip always look at a whiteboard<br>if you go into someone's office it can<br>tell you a lot of interesting things and<br>on the Whiteboard along with a lot of<br>other names was RG hyphen West Coast and<br>I thought oh that's interesting what<br>what what is that and within about 10<br>minutes I knew what it was it was West<br>Coast America I couldn't believe my look<br>in one way I also wasn't sure how to<br>explain this<br>so within 24 hours was I was on a 747<br>heading for Seattle and had to look at<br>two companies one based in Seattle one<br>based in uh Santa Anna in California and<br>I spent about three months there<br>flitting between the two looking at our<br>products or their products that we<br>bought from them as suppliers and trying<br>to make sure that they were on schedule<br>they were on time I learned a very<br>valuable lesson in one of these<br>companies I went in there and as a as a<br>young person of 27 with perhaps not as<br>much experience as I believed I had at<br>the time I went in in there and rattled<br>the factory to get our product out of<br>that and the next day I got summonsed<br>into the CEO uh CEO's office of Cory<br>switches Cory switches still exist in<br>Seattle and the CEO promptly said if you<br>don't retract all of these issues that<br>you've just caused me I will cancel all<br>the British sh space contracts that I've<br>got I will simply not make any of these<br>switches for you now that sounds<br>ridiculous we teach that uh in supply<br>chain at least we teach that the that uh<br>the customers have the power over that<br>well I was a customer but I didn't have<br>any power in that situation and I come<br>to realize that that was because our<br>order was Tiny and right on his doorstep<br>was Boeing seattleu gave him thousands<br>of orders and and for him to cancel ours<br>was absolutely of no consequence to him<br>so I learned a valuable lesson there<br>that whilst you can push people<br>sometimes you have to be careful in how<br>process I show you this book because<br>whilst I was in Seattle on a weekend<br>just browsing I went into a book shop as<br>I always do I have a passion for<br>books and uh I went into a book shop and<br>one book caught my eye this idea of<br>world class manufacturing very much me<br>had not heard of it before I bought that<br>book personally bought that book and<br>took it home and started reading it and<br>I didn't know at the time I didn't know<br>at the time that uh that book would have<br>a profound effect on my career and what<br>I was actually what what what I would do<br>future so here uh we have a different<br>part after that cment I took my final<br>role in a space before I left it I was<br>uh part of a team of people team of<br>managers who looked after Airbus<br>components so what you see here these<br>are what what I call stringers they can<br>be anything from 4 to 60 ft or 30 odd<br>meters long sometimes they're milled out<br>of aluminium uh and that is you can just<br>about see there if I can point this see<br>all these things at the bottom and the<br>top those are these items here so you<br>get a sense for the scale and they would<br>run the complete distance right the way<br>along a a wing so I had part of I was<br>responsible for four supervisors uh part<br>of a 50 million pound business at the<br>time this is back in the uh early '90s<br>120 skilled people working four shifts<br>two two night shifts two day shifts very<br>frustrating time from a managerial<br>leadership perspective very difficult to<br>get in fact almost impossible to get<br>everybody around the same table at the<br>same time when two people are in and<br>crossing over and two people arew in<br>building so that was the last major job<br>I had in Aerospace a number of things<br>were happening at this point and it says<br>here the carpet tile incident and I'd<br>like to explain what that is do we have<br>any accountants in here please can you<br>just show your hands if you're an<br>accountant okay Ralph forgive me it's<br>not meant to upset you but okay uh so I<br>was in that in that role I was told to<br>go and get myself an office downstairs<br>on the shop floor for presence and so I<br>was close to the issues that were going<br>on and to cut a long story very short I<br>found an office space and I asked one of<br>my friends or asked one of the people in<br>maintenance to come and put some carpet<br>towels down that's all it wasn't a big<br>office probably from here to the doors<br>about that<br>size I got a call in fact I didn't get a<br>call the accountant ran downstairs we<br>never used to see accountants on the<br>shut floor it's a strange experience but<br>he ran downstairs a couple of weeks<br>later really shouting and balling about<br>the cost of the carpet tiles the carpet<br>tiles couldn't have been more than<br>perhaps £100<br>that and we had a large Factory and<br>everywhere had the same carpet tow so<br>they weren't expensive and we had almost<br>a standup argument about how I the<br>audacity of me getting these carpet<br>tiles without going to see him for this<br>10050 or whatever it was and that stuck<br>with me I tried to understand why that<br>was the case and what I realized was<br>that actually because he could see that<br>on a Ledges somewhere it became visible<br>and there therefore it was something to<br>pin on a person and go down and sort out<br>forget the fact that in the AA space<br>with all the inventory that we had okay<br>we couldn't see any of the problems I<br>was it took sometimes it took two hours<br>to find the right part before someone<br>could actually add value and work on it<br>and so it made me realized that by<br>visibly seeing things accounting has got<br>a very myopic view of the world and<br>there are many many things that are<br>equally if not more important that can't<br>be counted and can't be uh uh considered<br>in an accounting frame and that struck<br>me at the time and that stayed with me<br>ever since as well and hence my interest<br>in performance measurement that might be<br>the one event or incident that set me on<br>a path for the rest of my life<br>there was both inspirational leadership<br>and really poor leadership at Aerospace<br>and I was beginning to see this I was<br>about 30 at the time I just about<br>completed my<br>degree<br>and I remember the phrase never waste a<br>good crisis there was one point where<br>myself and the rest of the leadership<br>team were brought into uh were brought<br>into the factory at 7:00 a.m. in the<br>morning on a Sunday morning for visual<br>effect and that time there was two<br>shifts crossing over the day shift and<br>the night shift or night shift and day<br>shift and we were all brought in purely<br>so that the effect of that could be seen<br>and it was a crisis we were going to<br>lose some work but to do it at that time<br>was purely for effect and it actually<br>had a great had a it went around the<br>factory like wild fire huge huge big<br>what's going on sort of feel in which uh<br>the executive in charge capitalized<br>on I was also beginning to read around<br>this and to see other ways of doing<br>things and that caused me to reflect<br>on is this the best way to run a factory<br>is this the best way to run an<br>organization I was starting to question<br>mind at this time I was completing my<br>degree I went to lead's poly Technic one<br>day a week as I said for 4 years 34<br>weeks a year uh 34 weeks in a year it<br>was a superb educational experience<br>there were eight of us we couldn't<br>afford to do that now we were taught as<br>one group of eight one cohort of eight<br>and I know that for instance Paul has<br>really pushed the idea of cohorts and I<br>think that's a where we can I think<br>that's a superb idea that was a great<br>experience for me very very close group<br>all the way through highly supportive of<br>each other uh it's sad that perhaps we<br>could we can't think about doing things<br>now my mother was so pleased when I<br>graduated I could I almost got a sense<br>that she felt her work was done she she'<br>raised my brother and I to the point<br>where I could stand on my own two feet<br>it was a very very uh strong feeling and<br>that's what she wrote in a book that she<br>presented to me only in the dictionary<br>does success come before work<br>congratulations on your degree M and<br>book so I was beginning to question the<br>idea of Aerospace I had a lot to be<br>thankful for I've been given an<br>apprenticeship I was a skilled<br>man I had Tech and Bachelor of Science<br>Education I was well on my way to being<br>a chartered engineer and I had excellent<br>career<br>prospects and<br>so it was a big decision but also at the<br>same<br>time there was constant arguing about<br>the right to manage as from a managed<br>manager Viewpoint the right to manage<br>was Management's right to make decisions<br>which in my opinion at least doesn't<br>exist it's a<br>fallacy but at the same time it sets<br>management directly opposed to unions<br>and a Workforce and it just sets us off<br>on the wrong foot and it did every time<br>in that factory and there was a myopic<br>focus on labor<br>utilization forget the fact that I<br>didn't have work for someone to do I was<br>expected to go around and police<br>smoko breaks to 10 minutes or 15 minutes<br>and then get them all and Rouse the<br>troops and get them all off and yet I<br>couldn't find the work that they needed<br>to do and so again it was this issue of<br>focus on on the Small Things without<br>realizing the big things are in trouble<br>and I just felt at that time that it was<br>uh there was better ways to do things<br>and I I i' I'd read about that and so I<br>guess I in my own mind I thought I want<br>to research this I want to know more<br>about this and the natural having just<br>finished a degree that I enjoyed<br>immensely the natural step was to look<br>Academia this is the plaque that I got<br>it's in my office at the moment I nearly<br>brought it but it weighs a ton and I<br>didn't want to drag it over here uh this<br>is a a bit of a Stringer if you just<br>look carefully a number of points come<br>to mind first of all colleagues is<br>spelled<br>wrong secondly you can see there that<br>there are fingerprints on it that was<br>because when it was given to me it was<br>still wet the varnish hadn't even<br>dried okay and in the middle there<br>though it's difficult to see there were<br>some Machining marks and it actually<br>says to Richard from his colleagues<br>especially Tim Tim was the manager of<br>the Upstream process that used to give<br>me all the problems and I had to<br>therefore solve them and this is one of<br>a problem where that that little<br>indented area had some discrepancies in<br>it that it was my role or my people's<br>role to fix and so there was this<br>constant situation of supply chain<br>issues between the two of us we were<br>very good friends but it caused immense<br>problems in terms of the<br>business so that sort of sums up it was<br>a perfect perfect gift but it sums up<br>the organization on the very last minute<br>not quite right but just about<br>fulfilling the<br>expectations and I I keep that for that<br>reason I think it's uh it sums up<br>perfectly that<br>organization I was still beginning to<br>read around this and as I said that was<br>one of the drivers for leaving Aerospace<br>it was a great position a blue chip<br>company but I just felt I honestly felt<br>if I<br>didn't there was I I felt there was a<br>better way to do things and if I didn't<br>leave then<br>then I would never leave at all and I<br>didn't want to be in that position and<br>so I looked for a job<br>outside I ended up having experience of<br>three UK universities in a relatively<br>short time I went naturally to an<br>engineering department the first one was<br>in Stafford Stafford poly Technic at the<br>time which later became Stafford<br>University with the that uh change<br>across the education sector I worked in<br>the department of computer TR<br>engineering it was largely teaching<br>focused in fact there was hardly any<br>research expectations teaching contact<br>hours were between 10 and 14 hours a<br>week for 34 weeks so highly highly<br>focused on teaching I enjoyed it<br>immensely however within about two weeks<br>of starting that job I'd also been<br>offered a position at a much closer poly<br>Technic Manchester Metropolitan un<br>University as it was as it came to be<br>and so I basically took that job on the<br>basis that I could defer starting for an<br>academic year and so I had one year at<br>Stafford knowing full well that I was<br>actually going to finish in the July and<br>start in Manchester Metropolitan<br>University in the<br>September I joined Manchester Metro<br>Metropolitan University in the science<br>and engineering faculty in the<br>department of mechanical uh engineering<br>and again it was very similar focused on<br>teaching very little research uh<br>expectations and again a very similar<br>role I was undertaking my MSC at<br>Manchester at the time I did it by<br>thesis uh<br>and my examiner for the MSC and then I I<br>embarked on a PhD the supervisor for the<br>PHD was Professor Ruth Bowden who worked<br>at Manchester School of Management in<br>umist and it was just a natural<br>progression when an opportunity came up<br>that I made the move to umist yist was<br>very prestigious in institution it been<br>around since<br>1824 that's the building on Saville<br>Street there is a whole campus behind<br>that uh but again I I joined that that<br>organiz ation and I had a huge shock all<br>of a sudden there was a research<br>requirement to publish I was my my<br>teaching was cut in not in half in in a<br>quarter and all of a sudden it was a<br>completely different environment there<br>was expectations for publishing<br>expectations for external grants and<br>awards I was quite successful at<br>external grants within 8 years of being<br>in that institution I I helped to bring<br>in either lead or or a uh Pi or uh<br>associate Pi nearly a million pounds<br>worth of funding mainly through Teaching<br>Company schemes Teaching Company schemes<br>are where a student is embedded in a<br>company and works on a big project with<br>academic support really I'm surprised<br>New Zealand don't have<br>those and so I started working at umist<br>Manchester School of Management and I<br>was there for the next day<br>years my thesis as was pointed out by uh<br>Professor Ty was looking at the idea of<br>performance measurement by now I really<br>was passionate about performance<br>measurement the way that our day-to-day<br>activities and the way that we measure<br>them could connect and drive the<br>strategy of the organization and the<br>implications for leadership through that<br>really<br>important uh it it looked at<br>fourme companies and basically in a<br>nutshell it it it identified that<br>strategically managers and leadership<br>are incredibly good at looking at<br>strategy and bringing new strategies on<br>and deciding what the next strategy is<br>and changing<br>strategies but what we're incredibly bad<br>at in fact the PHD really identified<br>that we hardly ever do this is then<br>deciding what are the new measures that<br>we have to put in place for instance one<br>of my companies was a spend about 2<br>years and a uh nearly a million pounds<br>in reorganizing the whole Factory so<br>that it could make product quicker so<br>the lead time was<br>shorter and it was successful at doing<br>that but it didn't change the way it<br>measured performance it didn't have any<br>data to say that we've been successful<br>at that strategy and now we have this<br>and when I explain that to the managing<br>director his jaw nearly fell on the<br>floor and that is a typical situation we<br>don't pay hardly any or we we hardly pay<br>attention to the performance measures<br>that go along with<br>strategy so there's a lot of work or<br>there was a lot of work to be done there<br>now uh one of my favorite quotes by<br>Albert Einstein uh not everything that<br>counts can be counted and not everything<br>that can be counted<br>counts I put this in the front page of<br>my PhD and I think it's worth repeating<br>please I think that sums up a position<br>uh that unless you have the performance<br>measurements in place you can almost say<br>anything and you can't you don't have to<br>prove it or it's really important to<br>prove and so again my reading was<br>continuing I was an academic by this<br>stage uh but I also connected the idea<br>of leadership leadership and performance<br>to the point where rather than seeing<br>them as two parallel or symbiotic<br>Concepts what I actually saw is actually<br>one concept that had a side of<br>performance measurement and had a side<br>of leadership and the two were<br>inseparable in my mind and I honestly<br>believe that to be be the case I think<br>performance measurement needs leadership<br>and Leadership definitely definitely<br>needs performance measurement and if the<br>two aren't there then it's not quite as<br>as as effective as it should<br>be during my PhD uh the balance<br>scorecard and most of you will have come<br>across that at some point uh developed<br>by Kaplan and Norton was becoming<br>prominent in the literature it was also<br>becoming prominent as a practitioner<br>perspective<br>and uh I attended one of the early uh<br>early performance measurement<br>Association conferences back in 1988 in<br>in uh Cambridge and I met two people who<br>have been friends for the rest of my<br>life uh Dr uh Mike Bourne and Dr Andy<br>Neely now both professors uh Mike<br>Professor Mike Bourne's professor at<br>crownfield of business uh performance<br>and uh Professor Andy NE OB is uh senior<br>Vice Chancellor at the at the University<br>of Cambridge both have been to denen<br>both have been here several times in<br>fact Andy Neely was here what three or<br>four months ago Ralph with an<br>organization conference that Ralph put<br>together I still keep in touch with<br>those two and the idea of sort of the<br>idea of performance from that conference<br>changed in my mind from being a<br>manufacturing concept to being one that<br>brings everybody together accountants<br>Finance marketing operations everybody's<br>interested in it and so it blossomed<br>into this thing that I sort of I I felt<br>was really important as a as a<br>leadership concept and I started to to<br>that<br>so this sort of some up really my point<br>or or to this point my time at<br>Manchester through Aerospace through uh<br>through three<br>universities I guess the the main point<br>I'd take away from from that is my the<br>drive to move from Aerospace into<br>Academia was really born out by the idea<br>that if you've only ever worked in one<br>organization then you don't know how<br>things can be<br>different luckily I've worked in three<br>different UK universities and this is my<br>fourth and so I'm lucky that I've got<br>that perhaps<br>perspective so let's just pick one or<br>two papers uh that I think and I've only<br>picked a a selection of these across the<br>the 20 years or so perhaps even longer<br>uh but these have have all mean<br>something to me and I've got some value<br>in the sense of performance and<br>Leadership so the first one one is uh<br>International Journal of operations<br>management 2000 it probably my first uh<br>reasonable<br>publication uh it was undertaken with a<br>student Master student band Dal uh it<br>was based in a factory and it basically<br>looked at the idea of what's called uh<br>overall equipment Effectiveness I won't<br>go through the detail of that it's a way<br>of measuring<br>utilization and this was used in the<br>concept of manufacturing but it could be<br>used at a university we could look at a<br>key resource<br>like like lecture theaters and the use<br>of lecture theaters and we could use<br>overall equipment Effectiveness to<br>measure that it's used in hospitals it's<br>used in many type of service<br>Industries this was the the the paper<br>found that whilst it wasn't fully<br>understood generally across uh across<br>the the academic Community it was a very<br>powerful mechanism for understanding<br>resource utilization and so that was<br>something that that uh really was looked<br>at in uh in a lot of detail and it's<br>probably my highest citations it's been<br>around a while obviously but 600<br>bad second paper uh this was published<br>with a a former PhD student of mine<br>Grace McCarthy who's now the dean of<br>business business at<br>wenong uh I still keep in touch with<br>Grace this examined leadership and the<br>the the connection with business<br>Excellence models business Excellence is<br>a an element of quality there's a whole<br>framework and science around this but<br>this looked at the idea of what did<br>those models give in terms of Leadership<br>Excellence and two companies were looked<br>at one in England one in the in Germany<br>uh we were looked at survey data as well<br>from a a series of people who had put<br>self- reports into this efqm process of<br>quality management and came up with the<br>the some of the ideas of well first of<br>all it identified implications for<br>multi-site leadership that way you've<br>got different entities in different<br>places that needs to be thought about in<br>a slightly different way uh it also<br>identified organized organizational<br>leadership as the critical uh element<br>for business Excellence that without<br>that you wouldn't you couldn't use<br>business excellence and business<br>Excellence is still going it's very<br>popular in the states and Europe not so<br>much in Australia and New Zealand but<br>entity uh this is the first paper that I<br>published really wholly from here wholly<br>from atago it was published with David<br>tap you all know David he was a manager<br>at the DCC at the time I went knocking<br>on his door said I'm interested in<br>looking at some of these things and<br>David uh kindly let me into the<br>organization and basically looked at the<br>way that he was implementing the balance<br>scorecard within his area at the<br>DCC uh<br>again really popular area uh it at that<br>time it was only just being used in<br>service Industries so manufacturing had<br>been there and done the balance<br>scorecard but service industries were<br>still working on that and I know that<br>Robin G has done some work here looking<br>at balance scorecard in health and<br>continues to look at that so it's again<br>this idea of uh of migrating across<br>different sectors and<br>industries uh again it looked at from a<br>leadership perspective it looked at how<br>important leadership was in not only<br>bringing the balance scorecard in but<br>making it effective making it useful to<br>the<br>organization in 2012 or 13 uh I com I<br>edited a book with a long-term friend<br>grahe Manvel I've done a lot of<br>Publications with Graeme graem is based<br>in uh in the Arab Emirates uh United<br>Arab Emirates at the moment we worked on<br>this for about a year uh and it was<br>quite a hectic process I have to say<br>trying to chase 18 academics from seven<br>different countries and get them to put<br>something in place we did it eventually<br>it was published by ga uh and has been I<br>don't know how you how you measure<br>success within a book it's certainly<br>certainly not brought any huge income in<br>but it has uh it has been adopted in a<br>number of places so it was a context<br>based uh look at really third sector or<br>not for-profit sector and it was in in<br>the context of what happened or what was<br>happening in the third sector the not<br>for-profit sector in the UK and several<br>different areas post GFC and the<br>implication was that after GFC most<br>governments were broke and therefore<br>said to the third sector to the<br>voluntary<br>organizations you get on and do this<br>we'll we'll we'll fund you but you can<br>do it and so there was a huge amount of<br>uh emphasis placed on<br>voluntary sector Community sector not<br>for-profit organizations to take up many<br>of the services that prior to GFC the<br>government had provided and that really<br>set that sector in place for a massive<br>change and it's still being reverberated<br>now uh another paper was measurement of<br>not for profits this was with gra again<br>published in the European management uh<br>journal in 2000 this looks at the idea<br>of of performance measurement and the<br>effect on hybridized<br>organizations effectively a hybridized<br>organization is where a not for-profit<br>tries to act in a commercially uh in in<br>a commercial way it starts to get driven<br>by uh starts to get driven by<br>competition starts to get driven by some<br>of the issues that for-profit<br>organizations have<br>contracts and and salaried staff and all<br>the implications around that and so we<br>looked at uh UK housing UK housing<br>authorities have gone through a number<br>of changes and basically they've gone<br>from third sector organizations<br>voluntary organizations Community<br>organizations<br>into essentially commercial<br>organizations and that transition has<br>been incredibly stressful for some of<br>those organizations this looked at the<br>way that process happened and also<br>looked at the role of performance<br>process uh this is one paper that was<br>undertaken by Dr adal akal one of my<br>former PhD students I understand ad deal<br>is online in Pakistan listening to this<br>I hope he is anyway I've kept in touch<br>with him uh<br>I his friendship means a great deal to<br>me uh a deal did this work looking at<br>health and uh look looking at lean<br>manufacturing and Health Supply chains<br>from a managerial perspective and what<br>adal found I think this was absolutely<br>inspired Health Supply chains and lean<br>manufacturing are essentially the same<br>thing they're the same thing they talk<br>about Supply chains and they talk about<br>leaning the supply chain so adal looked<br>at two sets of literature the lean<br>thinking literature and he also looked<br>at the health supply chain literature<br>they should have reflected each other<br>they should have been so interconnected<br>and the diagram here is a network<br>analysis so those are I think it's about<br>119 lean papers all shown in red and the<br>health supply chain was something like<br>196 papers all shown in green and this<br>plots where each is cited so it shows a<br>relationship between a paper published<br>and then that paper being cited later<br>on and you can clearly see that the two<br>are completely separate there is very<br>very little interchange between the two<br>when actually we should have seen a huge<br>connection there and I think adal uh was<br>incredibly uh perceptive to to look at<br>this and see this this issue so that was<br>uh paper that I completed with GRE<br>Manvel again in<br>2023 uh this was in housing studies this<br>looked at again UK housing we were<br>trying to amend the idea of how do the<br>how do housing uh organizations change<br>so it is a a subsequent paper from the<br>one I described a few moments<br>ago here we we looking at the idea of<br>institutional isomorphism what what I<br>mean by that is institutional Theory<br>suggests it gives us a way of how<br>organizations uh tend to mimic and react<br>and uh copy copy other organizations and<br>typically we see the private sector do<br>things and then the public sector and<br>the not for-profit sector copy some of<br>those things so here we were looking at<br>the measures that we used at U in UK<br>housing associations and how those<br>copied different performance measurement<br>approaches that were found in the the<br>private sector and again uh useful study<br>highlights the role of the<br>organization's strategic metrics in<br>sensing external change so what we found<br>there was that<br>when an organization senses externally<br>something has<br>changed then the way that they respond<br>to that is by<br>developing a new set of measures and so<br>there's a relationship between external<br>change in an environment in the sector<br>and the way that the organization first<br>of all senses it and secondly responds<br>to that and so it brings performance<br>measurement well and truly into that<br>picture and actually that hadn't been<br>looked at before there was a call uh in<br>2016 uh in in a similar Journal that<br>said that we need to take I uh<br>institutional Theory and apply it to the<br>and this is one of the first instances<br>of that being done and we're currently<br>working on the idea of how to look at<br>detail so that's just a snippet of some<br>of the the perhaps key papers that<br>I've published over the last uh over the<br>last 20 years or so certainly since be<br>being part of umist and uh being more<br>focused on Publications so what have I<br>learned in terms of performance and<br>practice first of all two-way<br>communication I think is a something<br>that sticks out there are many leaders<br>who will say they have an open door<br>policy when actually their door is<br>absolutely barricaded<br>shut two-way communication is not just<br>about an open door policy it's about<br>being able to listen and putting<br>mechanisms in place one of the best<br>examples I I was I I saw happen to be in<br>a taro uh in denen was Dr Phil ker who<br>was the former CEO of atago poly Technic<br>Phil established something called poly<br>ears uh and that was an anonymous<br>process by which any member of staff<br>could raise any point and that would be<br>sent to fill and fill with either field<br>it out to the person who could provide a<br>better response all would deal with that<br>himself it didn't need to be anonymous<br>but many of them were and by doing that<br>I feel that that is true two-way<br>communication and true Open Door<br>leadership and we don't seem to have a<br>lot of that around the place I think<br>that's a an issue that we could all work<br>on<br>more the academic's<br>role as a Critic and conscience of<br>society we've heard heard that lamented<br>times I find it interesting that if that<br>is lamented that that's our role then<br>isn't it also appropriate to have the<br>same critique applied internally to the<br>organization I don't believe we've been<br>tolerant enough of that<br>internalization and therefore I think it<br>takes a strong leader to be tolerant of<br>that it takes a strong leader to listen<br>to critique to be<br>able to withstand<br>it the real issue is when people do not<br>raise problems do not<br>challenge potentially because they're<br>either frightened or intimidated or<br>potentially value their own career too<br>much so from a leadership perspective we<br>should embrace challenge it's a healthy<br>organization we should not see this as a<br>pain in the<br>backside I think all too often we do and<br>that's something that I would ask all of<br>us as leaders in the university to to<br>bear in mind it's a healthy organization<br>that can withstand that it's an<br>excellent leader that can withstand that<br>decried uh focus on improvements which<br>the customer values this goes back to an<br>aerospace example and really really<br>quickly<br>there was when I was over in the states<br>one of the things I was working on was a<br>company with with<br>uh<br>uh what was it called uh L and Aerospace<br>they made a component and to cut again<br>to cut a long story short this component<br>was being retrofitted back into aircraft<br>that were in service with British<br>Airways and Midland Airways and etc etc<br>and there was a whole delay in making<br>some of these components and that's one<br>of the reasons I was out there to try<br>and speed this process<br>up and after understanding the problem<br>it became obvious that the delay was on<br>a component that actually would make no<br>difference to the airline at all the the<br>delay there was two components involved<br>the delay was on the component that<br>would make no difference the other<br>component was all available and that<br>would see a huge increase in service and<br>so I suggested why don't we instead of<br>waiting till we've got these two<br>components why don't we fit one<br>immediately the one that we've got<br>available the one that would make a big<br>difference and then at a later date fit<br>the other one where the customer<br>wouldn't see anything and I think the<br>idea of quality management and looking<br>at all of these sorts of things it's<br>incredibly important to focus on the<br>customer and to understand what makes a<br>difference there are many Improvement<br>projects that we might like to do but if<br>they don't make a difference if they<br>aren't tangible and felt by the customer<br>whoever we Define that<br>as then there's a question mark of<br>whether we should do<br>that uh something that from my Ada time<br>is the the standards you walk past are<br>the standards you<br>set uh as lire knows and Tim and a<br>number of other people here have all<br>been Adas you are constantly challenged<br>particularly with the are area of<br>academic Integrity constantly challenged<br>about the issues around that and<br>students putting themselves in those<br>positions and the idea<br>of the idea<br>of keeping the standards strict and<br>defined and maintaining those is<br>sometimes very difficult to do I found<br>it difficult anyway uh but the standards<br>that you walk past are the standards you<br>set the standards that you let go by and<br>sorry Brandon I didn't see you there<br>you're in Ada as well probably other<br>people in here that have been that my<br>apologies<br>Brandon and uh and the the standards<br>that you set are incredibly important<br>and so without realizing it if we walk<br>past the standard or we walk past<br>something and we<br>don't recognize that as a problem then<br>we're actually accepting that as a<br>so I came to a profound uh profound sort<br>of understanding perhaps late in life<br>around this I realized that we we think<br>about organizations as entities we see<br>the buildings we see its presence in a<br>location we even talk about this is the<br>place I work I go and spend much of my<br>life there but in actual fact in actual<br>fact organizations are just a collection<br>of people and even more organizations<br>are a collection of people at a given<br>point in time and a collection of<br>leaders<br>and that means that if we've got<br>different leaders coming and going then<br>we also have different<br>priorities and different views of<br>interpretating things I'd go as far as<br>to say<br>that perhaps I wouldn't be personally<br>stood<br>here if there was a a different set of<br>of leaders in place I think it's that<br>profound it certainly felt that to me<br>and so so the idea of understanding the<br>personal element I think is really<br>important you can find yourself at odds<br>with people you can find<br>yourself not seeing eye to eye or being<br>out of favor and so from a leadership<br>perspective I think that is incredibly<br>damaging and one of the things that<br>again leadership should be it should<br>look to bring on leaders it should look<br>to develop the next set of leaders and<br>give people every<br>opportunity to succeed and take on<br>leadership roles whatever they may<br>be uh nearly there so in terms of<br>future future sort of work from my<br>perspective I saw this<br>as part of my Ada experience and<br>particularly during covid and I know Co<br>has been and gone it had a profound<br>effect on us all I think most of us are<br>glad to see the back of it unfortunately<br>it's not likely to be the last unplanned<br>disruption that we have in fact we're<br>likely to have many many more more<br>frequently I think<br>all all the science around that seems to<br>speak to<br>that I like that quote as well Charles<br>Charles handy the world keeps changing<br>it's one of the paradoxes of success<br>that the things and the ways that got<br>you where you are are seldom the things<br>to keep you there I think that's a<br>profound<br>statement uh so one of the experiences I<br>had through covid was the idea of Rapid<br>decision making and all of a sudden for<br>this institution at least and most<br>universities would be similar and<br>certainly the people I've spoke to in<br>others seem to indicate that all of a<br>sudden under covid there was this<br>massive change and as Ada with the<br>responsibility for the connection<br>between<br>uh Commerce and the center for what was<br>going on I mean there were daily<br>meetings on this when Marie was reading<br>out the meetings there was involved with<br>involved in I almost shed I was going<br>back to a very stressful State just<br>thinking of those and many people were<br>involved in those not just me but what I<br>found was or what I saw was this change<br>and I've tried to show it here this is<br>is some work that I presented with Ralph<br>a little while ago but under normal<br>conditions the major decisionmaking<br>mechanism is high it's major basically<br>it's a strategic leadership team level<br>and it's relatively slow and that's not<br>a criticism that's just an<br>observation and it's slow because we<br>have monthly meetings we have board<br>agendas we have agendas that that don't<br>change that much it's just the way we do<br>things<br>in the university and something deep<br>down in me sort of said well if if we're<br>going to have more disruption or likely<br>to have more disruption and if this had<br>this massive change that under<br>disruption we had first of all a much<br>more rapid sense of decision making or a<br>need for much more rapid decision making<br>and that decision making was also made<br>lower down the<br>organization down at the divisional<br>level even the department level and I<br>was bombarded and sure the other Adas<br>were bombarded with questions around<br>well what about this what about that and<br>so I think there's an interesting issue<br>to be looked at and it's something that<br>I intend to spend effectively most of<br>the rest of my career trying to<br>understand is under disruption<br>particularly unplanned disruption what<br>is the way that an<br>organization uh can maintain itself what<br>what what do we have to understand how<br>do we have to operate differently<br>there's a really nice model I've chosen<br>not to provide it here for time but<br>there's a really nice model by Snowden<br>uh who looks at four stages or four<br>different areas of managerial and<br>Leadership and that's something that I<br>intend to<br>utilize so this is something that I<br>wonder whether we need to learn more<br>from and whether we even as a university<br>need to exercise ourselves our<br>leadership ability in different<br>scenarios and think are there projects<br>that we could devolve and also do<br>quickly and do in less time and not<br>through the standard processes and<br>that's a<br>challenge that's an absolute challenge<br>to many people in this room but it's I<br>think something that if the university<br>can learn to behave that way it stands a<br>better chance of responding successfully<br>in the future to other forms of<br>disruption<br>just before we finish I wanted to tell<br>you a little bit about me as a person<br>this is uh STS 132 space shuttle launch<br>back in I think it was 2010 I'm an<br>absolute as you might expect having an<br>aerospace background I'm an absolute not<br>for Science and Technology and I was<br>lucky enough to see one of these go up<br>uh very lucky as it turns out cuz they<br>hardly ever go up on time and I was just<br>sat there nonchalant waiting for this to<br>happen and it did uh one of the very few<br>times Atlantis has gone up on time so<br>that was one of the highlights I guess<br>I'm a science not I'm I avidly read<br>about Popular Science to the point where<br>I've got into some stuff about quantum<br>mechanics it's called the theoretical<br>minimum I think that's still well above<br>my practical maximum uh but nonetheless<br>I'm interested in Reading and and I've<br>constantly got two or three books going<br>on around<br>that I don't mind getting my hands dirty<br>I took an engine out stripped it down<br>put it back in and it worked Believe It<br>or Not uh and those of you who know me<br>well know that I have two dogs these are<br>two balvini and Becks I'd just like to<br>tell you a story about these two just a<br>few months before this picture was taken<br>when they were a little smaller and<br>puppies I was taking them for a walk I<br>used to live in St Leonard's and those<br>of you who know me know that I used to<br>live in the cottage that is on the same<br>plot as a vice Chancellor in fact that's<br>the fence that is the vice Chancellor's<br>property and I looked down I got on my<br>phone I was just checking something and<br>then I looked down again and these two<br>little puppies were the other side of<br>that fence they climbed through now I<br>had a series of thoughts it was Haren<br>who was the vice Chancellor she'd only<br>been in there not very long and my<br>puppies were on her property the other<br>side of the fence do I go around and get<br>them what do I do I had this this pause<br>and I thought given the alternative I<br>slowly pulled each puppy back through<br>the fence okay puppies are<br>date so uh I also like lson I've put<br>that up there I'd like to offer my<br>appreciation and<br>thanks uh I'd like to extend this to<br>my colleagues past and present the<br>department of management is in such a<br>good place right now such a good place<br>didn't always used to be the case and<br>that is<br>largely due to the work that Professor<br>fion edar has put in and I thank you<br>very much for that we in such a great<br>place my point is my point is that we<br>need to ensure that we value that that<br>we keep it a good place because it's a<br>fragile<br>thing I'd like to uh I I was in a a<br>doctorial seminar earlier today and I<br>had the thought that we've got a great<br>set of PhD students particularly<br>management many of you are here tonight<br>I'd like to thank all my PhD students<br>adal uh Natasha wasn't mine but I've<br>worked closely with you uh Xiao uh<br>Muhammed Evelyn many many more you<br>all you all work in a second or<br>potentially even a third language you<br>are so eloquent you are so intellectual<br>in that second or third language and you<br>are stellar and long may it last well<br>done well done it's a privilege to work<br>with people like<br>yourselves I'd like<br>to mention all OBS professional stuff<br>you make the world go around<br>particularly and two points particularly<br>Rebecca and<br>Theresa certainly from a perspective of<br>an ADA perspective one of my main<br>objectives and I talked about this with<br>Rebecca was to try and lift the standard<br>of Commerce docu<br>mentation within bugs and bogs and we<br>succeeded in doing that and other people<br>were involved in that as well but that<br>was something that really was attributed<br>job I'd like to extend uh a thank you to<br>Professor Harland thank you Tony uh I I<br>emailed Tony last night and told him<br>that this was happening and Tony<br>graciously agreed to uh to come here uh<br>I had a uh I won't go through the<br>details but Tony was gracious gracious<br>enough to be a mentor to me a few years<br>ago when many people didn't want to know<br>Tony did Tony helped me through a period<br>that was really quite<br>profound and so Tony thank you I wanted<br>to say that uh there were times when I<br>didn't think I would ever be stood here<br>I'm sure there are many people in the<br>audience who had the same view uh but<br>thank you for for sticking by me then I<br>would also like to uh thank Professor<br>Pat Crag from an ada perspective and I<br>know there were many many people<br>involved in this but from an ada<br>perspective Professor uh KAG held the<br>place together when covid hit nobody<br>knew what was happening nobody there was<br>a time in one morning meeting and we<br>used to meet every morning at the start<br>where<br>we were talking about effectively<br>Chinese overseas students and we were<br>trying to understand the effect on each<br>different<br>division and I had this profound moment<br>where for one second I got a list of<br>students and I was reporting on them and<br>I was back at Aerospace I was back in a<br>progress meeting at 7:30 in the morning<br>this person's there that person's doing<br>that it just felt so natural to do that<br>not necessarily for a good reason but it<br>was a way forward to do that so I would<br>like to extend my uh my thanks to Pat<br>Crag I keep in touch with us still uh<br>and I've got an immense amount of<br>respect for<br>her uh I'd like to acknowledge my mom my<br>dad and Brian all played all have played<br>a really important part in my life in<br>guiding my life and my career and my<br>thinking and who I am today so I really<br>would like to uh acknowledge that<br>and finally I'd like to acknowledge uh<br>my wife Joan Joan thank you we came over<br>here together and this is another step<br>in that Journey uh and am incredibly<br>you uh Kaki ano o a<br>K I'll see you around thank<br>you K Ed t<br>uh I'm a longtime colleague of Richard<br>as you heard he has been here since 2006<br>and so I am delighted to be here today<br>thanking him for providing us with some<br>very interesting insights into his<br>journey as a practitioner in the<br>engineering sphere as well as a<br>researcher and educator so thank you<br>Richard I'd also like to take this<br>opportunity to express my thanks to all<br>of you for joining us here today to<br>celebrate this important milestone in<br>Richard's career and I know you must be<br>immensely proud and grateful to have you<br>here with us as<br>well Richard during your IPL you have<br>acknowledged the significant um<br>influence and impact that your mother<br>has played in your life and I'm sure we<br>can all appreciate the challenges that<br>come with bringing up two young boys as<br>a soul parent upon the passing of of<br>your father the influence of your mother<br>not only touched and informed your<br>childhood and your experiences growing<br>up but importantly your mother played a<br>very significant guiding role in your<br>life through<br>adulthood um and in management we often<br>talk about those sociocultural factors<br>that impact us and families are also<br>important um to the values the ethics to<br>the way we live our lives so um we<br>appreciate that the significant<br>impact um and we've got no doubt that<br>your mother was an extremely important<br>person in your life and that she's had<br>such a positive influence Ence so it was<br>nice of you to recognize and ack<br>acknowledge that in your IPL your<br>passion and enthusiasm for all things<br>operations I feel like you've been<br>treading on a bit of my territory in<br>terms of people management as well has<br>been M um made patently clear to us<br>tonight and we can see um that your<br>engineering career with Aerospace<br>provided the impetus and the motivation<br>that sat behind your research career and<br>it was indeed those observations that<br>you made in um Aerospace both good and<br>bad in terms of leadership and<br>management that has inspired your<br>academic career and your research our<br>tra<br>trajectory uh this type of uh external<br>engagement is one of the key means by<br>which we can ensure our work has um<br>impact by giving back to our community<br>and that is something that you've done<br>and you've also done that in the<br>classroom as well you've used your<br>knowledge to enhance and support the<br>employability of our students and that<br>is um a significant impact in an<br>environment such as the one in which we<br>work alongside of your research and<br>teaching Endeavors more recently you've<br>demonstrated dur ability to provide<br>strong academic leadership and whilst I<br>know it wasn't the focus of the talk<br>tonight but uh our PVC Marie has touched<br>on that and I would also like to touch<br>on your role as associate Dean academic<br>for the division of Commerce and the<br>leadership that you provided through Co<br>um was much appreciated uh by the likes<br>of me and others in a head of Department<br>role um and also just in in line with<br>that role you've taught our students to<br>be socially responsible and ethical in<br>their business practice and I noticed as<br>well that that was brought up um with<br>your role in terms of student Integrity<br>I think there would be um not a student<br>that would walk through your door<br>thinking they were going to get an easy<br>pass and I think you've conveyed that<br>message uh very well here looking<br>towards the future it's great to see<br>that you have um determined a career um<br>path or research um Direction and you're<br>going to be researching the role of<br>leadership in the event of disruption I<br>think um Co has taught us that<br>disruption is all around us we're in a<br>very tumultuous environment and it is um<br>there will undoubtedly be other similar<br>disruptions to that which we experienced<br>um with Co and so going forward looking<br>at um how we might um develop our<br>leadership through those disruptions is<br>a very Salient um objective for um a<br>researcher to do and I'm sure it's<br>definitely something that'll have an<br>impact on organizational<br>success so in concluding on behalf of<br>the university the division the<br>management department and our colleagues<br>here i' would like to thank you for<br>those contributions and to congratulate<br>you on your first um public lecture as a<br>professor I'd like to present you with a<br>a gift of appreciation and recognition<br>from the University thank you very much<br>thank<br>you and just um in closing I'd just like<br>to invite you all to join us over at the<br>staff club for uh refreshments and um if<br>you want an alcoholic drink you can pay<br>for it but um you come come and have<br>come and have a drink with us it would</p></main><footer style="margin-top: 2rem; background: #0001; padding:
