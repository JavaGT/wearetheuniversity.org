I caught up with Yash and Sabrina<br>from our MBA Programme to discuss their journeys of professional transformation. Let's take a look.<br>Today, we'll explore what you'll learn in the MBA Programme, career opportunities, and hear from<br>a current student and a recent graduate. Would you guys mind introducing yourselves? <br>- Hello everyone. My name is Sabrina. I work for Fisher &amp; Paykel Appliances as NPI Launch Manager.<br>I'm a current student of M-7 cohort. <br>-Thanks, Sabrina. I'm a Delivery Lead and my name is Yash Dayal. I work<br>for Westpac New Zealand. I'm a recent graduate as well. <br>- So, what attracted you to our MBA, Sabrina?<br>- That's a very hard question, Mike. Well, it's not; I'm just joking! First of all, MBA is something on<br>my list since in my, I guess, early 20s. It's something I need to do for my life. Second,<br>after working for about 10-15 years, I definitely feel like the continual improvement and the growth<br>of my mindset is the key to keep growing  my career. And third, Auckland University is second to<br>none. It's my choice.<br>-  Great! Thanks for sharing, Sabrina.  <br>How about you, Yash. <br>- Thanks, Sabrina. Yeah that's very<br>similar to Sabrina's thoughts as well. As part of my career development, the MBA was identified<br>as a key piece for me to progress and move. The other second piece was the reputation that<br>our University had. It was second to none, and that really was a driving force for me<br>to be part of the MBA there.<br>- Cool, thanks! Could you tell us about <br>the top skill you learned in<br>our MBA Programme and how you've applied it so far?<br>- Yeah, sure. The top skill I've learned<br>from the MBA Programme is resilience. I realise <br>that's a skill I can use both in work and life.<br>At work, you know it's not just about work; sometimes politics. If you get up to a certain level<br>of your career in life, you have a different things happening in your life. Resilience is<br>something that you need to allow you to bounce back next day. Like today, I'm sitting here talking<br>to you, Mike, literally. A lot of things happen to me already in life and work but I need to<br>sit here, carry on my life, put on a positive attitude. This resilience skill I learned<br>from MBA I think is very, very important.<br>- Thanks for sharing. How about yourself, Yash? What top<br>skill have you learned from our MBA and how have you've applied it?<br>- As you can imagine there's many<br>skills you learn across the MBA, but the one that really stands out for me was the entrepreneurial<br>thinking, and the reason why I draw on <br>that so much is because, especially in this<br>day and age with so much ambiguity, it's how you navigate that. But having that constant approach<br>of finding those key resources, advocating for them, and sort of driving forward with<br>a very optimistic view really has helped us, especially in work as well as within the MBA.<br>- Great! Sabrina, which part of the MBA journey surprised you the most?<br>- I would say<br>it's the support of the MBA Team and the teaching itself. These two really surprised me a lot. <br>I work full-time. I'm also a mum, have a family. Initially, I started my MBA journey full-time. After<br>one quarter, I feel like it's a bit challenging for me, so I reach out to the teaching staff. They<br>ultimately adjust my course based on my scenario. So, I feel very supported from this sense.<br>From the teaching facility itself, the variety of the courses covered - really defines what<br>is MBA. It touches every single point. If you want to be a CEO, that that's a course you want to do,<br>you need to learn. I'm not saying that you have to have an MBA qualification to be a CEO, but<br>definitely, MBA give you the potential of yourself. You know you can do it. <br>- Fantastic! Yeah and how<br>about you, Yash, how did you balance everything?<br>- As everyone would know, it always starts off<br>with a good plan. The MBA actually started for me almost a year and a half ago when I was looking<br>for the courses, and understanding which university select. But also having that 'family plan', I called<br>it, which was making family aware that this is what I'm committing to for this period<br>of time and the support. And it also applied to my work life as well, making sure my employer was<br>comfortable with my approach, and the way we were doing this. And last but not least, reaching out to<br>the University of Auckland staff and making sure we were supported along the way. So those three facets<br>really brought it to life for me as well.<br>- Great! Tell us, Sabrina, how did the MBA enhance your<br>career?<br>- Right! I start my new job three months ago at a Fisher &amp; Paykel Appliances. I wouldn't say it's all<br>through MBA, but it's definitely related. So that was beginning of this year, we were doing a <br>group project. One of the students in <br>our group works for Fisher &amp; Paykel Appliances and<br>the organisation we're going to study on Fisher &amp; Paykel Appliances. One day, I was just browsing on their<br>website looking for some information, then I got to the career web page. I realised, oh, that sounds like me, and<br>I applied. I've gone through three interviews then got <br>the job. The student was not involved at all in<br>our group. He didn't even know until I almost got my offer. I was like, "Hey ... I've got<br>my offer, we're gonna work together". So, it is through the group project, but I would say I probably<br>wouldn't look at Fisher &amp; Paykel Appliance's website - because <br>I wasn't intentionally looking for anything - but<br>somehow I bump into this opportunity through our group work then I look into this website. <br>It definitely helped me to change my career, change my industry, and a step up of what I do. <br>- Fantastic!<br>It's really helpful, congratulations! <br>- Thank you, Mike.<br>- And I guess it's about exposing you to<br>a lot of different things you wouldn't normally be exposed to in your day-to-day life.<br>- Exactly<br>those opportunities the doors opened I wouldn't imagine through this course<br>if I didn't take this course. <br>- How about you, Yash, how's the MBA helped with your career?<br>So far, what was really promising was, through that ambition and drive I've expressed at work,<br>my leaders actually saw that, and they had a chance, through my learnings from the MBA, to<br>validate those and give me greater roles and greater responsibilities. What that's meant<br>for me is navigating different roles but also applying my learnings, and it's given me a better<br>exposure to the financial services industry, which would then, in turn, support<br>future growth and future learning opportunities for the organisation and myself. <br>- I guess<br>having gone through an MBA, you you pick up these things and you're just sort of hungry to use<br>them. And when you do use them at work, it gets you noticed right?<br>- Yeah, spot on and one one big caller<br>for me was, it's not just applying the tools that you learn, or the tricks, it's how you apply it,<br>and how you actually put them or integrate them that actually creates benefit for the<br>organisation and your customers in the end.<br>- Great! Sabrina, could you tell us what advice<br>you might have for people thinking about doing an MBA?<br>- My advice is believe in yourself. Just do it.<br>Don't just think, just do, just go for it! <br>That's my advice, Mike. It's a big dream.<br>No that's great and congratulations on you doing it! That's fantastic! How about you<br>Yash, what advice do you have for people thinking about doing an MBA?<br>- That's a tough one. When<br>I reflected, or if I were to reflect on it, the key point is: No MBA is created equally, right?<br>First of all, being very clear and concise on where you want to go to, and the University of Auckland<br>ticked all the boxes for me. So, remember, "What you <br>pay what you pay is what you get," kind of thing.<br>But the important aspect is the MBA journey for me when I started off was more for career development. But<br>when I step back and look at it really, it's been a transformation journey - a very transformative<br>journey, I would say. And for me that's brought to life: You're not just alone. You have a amazing<br>cohort, you have amazing lectures and support that go on for life. It's the part of the alumni<br>that you form. Those are the <br>important aspects for me that have come through.<br>But you know similar to what was mentioned, it's "Take the leap." Because once you throw yourself<br>in, embrace every opportunity you got and that's the only way can to learn and grow.<br>- Great! Thanks for sharing.<br>Thank you for joining us. I hope you've <br>learned something about our MBA Programme.
