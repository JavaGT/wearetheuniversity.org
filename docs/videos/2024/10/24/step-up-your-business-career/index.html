My name is Deepika Jindal and I'm the Programme Director for the Master of Business Management.<br>Thank you for joining me today to learn about our Professional Programmes at the University of Auckland Business School.<br>We will be talking about all the Professional Programmes, particularly around the Master of Applied Finance,<br>Master of Business Analytics, and the Master of Business Management.<br>Our programmes are designed to cater to a wide range of academic backgrounds and professional skills.<br>As a Human Resource Management researcher and practitioner, I'm very passionate about career crafting. Career enhancement<br>is not just about moving up the ladder. It's also about crafting a career that takes you in a new direction.<br>If you are a recent graduate, you may be taking stock of your current experiences and considering pivoting to a different career.<br>One way to do that is through formal education.<br>If you are an experienced professional, career crafting means looking at your career in a different way.<br>Maybe you are in the scientific or creative world now,<br>but you dream of becoming an entrepreneur or taking up a corporate leadership role. To make a meaningful change,<br>you need to create your own opportunities. Through our Professional Programmes,<br>You will gain more than knowledge. You will also have lots of opportunities to network and apply what you learn.<br>You will not just reflect, but experiment to discover what you like and what you don't like.<br>Our programmes are designed to let you test, to let you practise and get a stronger understanding of what really interests you.<br>In order to help you craft a career that is meaningful and rewarding for you personally.<br>These programmes are a fast track to your success. In just 15 months,<br>you can earn a master's degree from New Zealand's leading Business School.<br>These programmes are designed to give you specialised knowledge and technical expertise and help you build your professional network.<br>And you will get hands on experience with a real industry project, which is a key feature of all these programmes.<br>So we have today with us two students and one alumni who have studied in these programmes and are also currently studying.<br>So what we will do is we will start with introductions, and perhaps I will start with you, Steve.<br>Could you tell us something about yourself very briefly? Sure.<br>So my name is Steve Limpus. I graduated from the Postgraduate Diploma in Business in April, specialising in business management,<br>and I am currently studying the Master of Business Management, specialising in strategic management.<br>Thank you Steve. What about you, Vicky? Yeah. So my name is Vicky Peng, and I just recently graduated with a Master of Business Analytics.<br>And my specialisation is supply chain management. Thank you for your introduction.<br>Now onto you Zeera. I'm Zeera, and I am currently a part time student of the Masters of Applied Finance programme.<br>And my specialisation is financial analytics.<br>Awesome. Thank you so much for your introductions. So what I will perhaps do is kind of explore your purpose behind enrolling in this programme.<br>So, um, Vicky, what was your purpose? Why did you enrol into your programme?<br>So actually my background is in the hospitality management back in AUT,<br>where I initially focused on the role in hotel and customer service and doing my final internship working in a hotel.<br>I realised that I enjoy working with data, and that experience motivated me to pursue a Master in Business Analytics,<br>a field that I believe will have a bright future due to the growing demand for data analytics expertise.<br>And my purpose to shift my career path is to broaden my career prospects and open up new opportunities for myself.<br>That is so good, Vicky. And that is something that I also talked about previously when I was talking about career crafting, because, you know,<br>it's only through experimentation that one can know about one's interests, what you like, what you don't like.<br>So Zeera tell us something about your academic and work background.<br>And why did you then decide to enrol into your current programme?<br>Okay. So my undergraduate, it was in health sciences.<br>I was also from another Auckland based tertiary provider,<br>and I was fortunate enough to take the scenic route to come to a vocation that I love, and it's the health care sector.<br>So, along the lines I picked up a few sort of commercial certifications in analytics.<br>And I have now come to a specialised niche, quite niche intersection between health care management and improvement of health care delivery,<br>informed by data leveraged by innovative technologies.<br>So that's sort of where I've come to.<br>And I have found myself dealing with a lot of financial information that I had no clue what they mean.<br>So, having come from public sector and into the private sector and having experienced all these,<br>this burnout, sort of corporate pressures, I decided to venture out on my own as an independent contractor.<br>And that had led me to equip myself with tools that I can sort of manage my contracts better and also provide a better solution to my clients.<br>So hence why the Masters of Applied Finance. Yeah.<br>Thank you. Yeah, I love the idea of, you know, taking the scenic route.<br>And I think that sometimes during that scenic route, you like things, you stop and you look at the view and you gather some things, you apply it.<br>And I also like the idea of how, you know,<br>you are taking the learnings from your programme and trying to see how much of that works in your current settings or not.<br>So really good to hear that. So coming to you, Steve, tell us something about your background.<br>And I do know that you are a working professional.<br>So how do you know that works for you? Are you able to bring the skills that you are learning back to your role?<br>Sure. So, my background is a little bit different.<br>I'm a motor mechanic by trade. I came to the<br>I came to the programme for personal and career reasons.<br>The personal reasons are that I had been helping my sons, with their undergraduate degrees.<br>They had both moved out of home at that stage, and I was a bit of a loss with without my boys at home,<br>and, my wife challenged me to find out about study opportunities that might be available to me.<br>I didn't think there would be any. I didn't have an undergraduate degree.<br>I didn't have university entrance either. So, to my delight, I discovered there was a programme.<br>And that was the Postgraduate Diploma in Business. I had to apply for it.<br>I wrote an essay saying why I thought I could do the programme and why I thought the university might want to have me here.<br>I remember being very nervous and being very excited when my application came back and I had been, had been approved.<br>So that was tremendously exciting. I thought that the opportunity to study at university had passed me by many, many decades ago.<br>And there's probably a lot of people out there who who might feel that they're in the same boat.<br>But, there is an opportunity here at the Business School to, to do a diploma and then to eventually do a master's and even beyond that.<br>So some interesting personal reasons there for me. In terms of career,<br>Yes, I can bring those learnings that I have here at the university back to my career.<br>I think for people in my situation, technical skills, trade knowledge is something that we,<br>that's sort of imbued in us over decades out in industry.<br>What I found that I learned, starting with the diploma and now continuing with the master's degree, are those soft skills,<br>particularly around people management. We bring our technical skills with us, but the people management side is quite different.<br>Learning about things like reflection is one of the key things that I learned early on and have applied in my career.<br>It's helped to make me a better manager.<br>And critical thinking I think as well, learning to analyse situations, analyse business, and then apply those.<br>in a way that's useful to our employers, for example.<br>So, I bring a lot back to my work from from my study.<br>Yeah. Thank you Steve. And you know, your story is fascinating.<br>And you are what I would call a career crafter.<br>So you have been crafting a career and bringing a sense of meaning into what you do,<br>and you've also been shaping your identity and with what you are saying, our professional programme is giving you an opportunity to be able to do that.<br>So staying with you, you mentioned that you've got a family, you've got sons, you've gone through the university system.<br>So how did you balance your studies or how are you balancing it at the moment?<br>Well, I think a key thing, especially for people who are considering starting a diploma or a master's degree<br>the first thing is that you really have to be passionate about it, because you do have to make sacrifices.<br>If you're working full time. You have a career, you have family, you have friends.<br>You know, something has to give.<br>So you have to be passionate. You have to really enjoy it.<br>I really enjoy my studies. So, when I make a sacrifice, it's not really a sacrifice because I love doing it anyway.<br>I think it's really important,<br>If you have a - if you're living with a significant person in your life that you have that sort of understanding partner,<br>because that helps a great deal, it's not something that you do on your own.<br>It's quite a big, big task, and you need that sort of support and encouragement from the people that you care about.<br>So discipline and a supportive family environment did play a role.<br>And would you like to add anything to that Zeera? Because I think you also have a young family.<br>I do. I guess, we were chatting about it early before, so I,<br>I have a little six year old boy and he takes a lot of attention, as they all do.<br>But also, it sort of gave me a bit of, like an anchor.<br>Right? And resonating with what Steve was saying in regards to having a supportive partner,<br>like for me, the theme is more, it takes a village.<br>So I've invested in a village being University of Auckland Business School.<br>And, so for me, it - on top of my family and friends.<br>So for me, when I'm here. Look, I've paid for this.<br>I'm here. I'm not - I'm, I'm dialled in. This is four hours of your life,<br>that you've dedicated. That's a - that's a big thing for me.<br>Yeah. That is so good to hear. Steve, did you want to add? Can I just pick up on something that Zeera said?<br>I mentioned that, you know, enjoying your studying,<br>being passionate about it is really important.<br>But I think when you, when you want to achieve something big in life and a master's degree would certainly be that,<br>you need a reason that's sort of outside of yourself.<br>And I just when you talk about your son, you know, when, when things get tough, I think of my sons and,<br>part of wanting to achieve and wanting to do well and complete the programme is to be a good role model.<br>So I think, yeah. And it will be different for different people.<br>But certainly, that resonated with me when you talked about your son.<br>It was a key part of, how I motivate myself when things get a little bit tough, when there's an assignment<br>due, you know, when I might rather go to the movies?<br>You know, it's - it's thinking about them and being a good role model for them.<br>Um, helps me get through it. What about your programme supporters?<br>I mean, the programme team. I feel like Marco for the MAppFin, Marco and Elly have been, they're<br>part of my village. They -<br>At one point, I had a last minute childcare crisis.<br>Marco gave me a green light, you know, bring him along.<br>And I didn't end up having to, but I felt like I was in good hands.<br>I felt like I, you know, it's scary territory for me.<br>I had no finance background whatsoever. And leaning in to your programme team and the peripheral sort of support services like the,<br>the bigger Business School, I think that was - I've utilised that before.<br>I know that that's a big, a major sort of support for me as well.<br>I love the idea of, you know, the university being that big village, kind of a support system.<br>And, that's what our programmes are.<br>So we offer that kind of a community environment where you network not just with each other, but with that broader community.<br>So, Vicky, would you like to talk about what was the highlight in your programme?<br>Yeah. So I would say the highlight of my programme would be I had the opportunity to choose and delve deeply into the specialisation that interests me,<br>such as marketing, fintech and supply chain management.<br>So my specialisation was the supply chain management.<br>So for the entire programme, for the first three quarters, we built a very solid foundation in business analytics.<br>So. Covering the topic, such as the business intelligence architecture, data management, and stat analysis.<br>And then when we move into the last two quarters, we will focus on our specialisation.<br>So where we're getting in-depth knowledge and hands-on experience in areas such that you mentioned management and logistics.<br>And this experience helped us to apply our theoretical knowledge to the practical scenario as well.<br>Yeah. And because you are the only alumni on the panel, so you would have done your industry focussed project.<br>Yes. So what was your experience with that? Yeah. So my industry consultancy project was an incredible experience for me.<br>So we had the opportunity to work as a team in a project provided by Grant Thornton, one of the biggest consultancy companies in the world.<br>And our project is to start analysing a reverse supply chain for glass recycling in New Zealand, which is very practical and fascinating for us.<br>And doing our project, we need to understand the business requirements and the stakeholder expectation to define our project scope accurately.<br>And this foundation allows us to proceed with the further data analysis.<br>And also for this project we also work under a very tight timeframe of ten weeks.<br>But our hard work paid off where we present our final result to our client.<br>And throughout this project, we received a lot of support from both our company and the school and our industry<br>mentor from Grant Thornton, they provided us with lots of guidance,<br>clarification and support whenever we need it, while our academic supervisor offered<br>the expertise in consultancy practice and helped us to solve any technical,<br>any technical, uh, issue during the project. And this collaboration enhanced our learning experience.<br>Also teach us how to apply our skill and knowledge effectively in a real world setting.<br>That was a great opportunity for you to, you know, engage in real life learning with one of the best organisations in the world.<br>So, Zeera, any, experiential learning opportunities that you have gone through while studying this programme?<br>And by that I mean, for example, any networking with industry experts, any guest speakers that had an influence or an impact on you?<br>That's actually, I think, one of the, the highlight of this programme, and Marco managed to successfully secure senior leaders from,<br>for example, New Zealand Super Fund and<br>the financial strategist from Auckland Council and even a chief investment officer from a US based hedge fund.<br>And these are academically astute and also practitioners in their fields.<br>And the events were engaging and motivating and also sort of gave us insights as to the breadth of what the industry is,<br>not specifically just for someone who wants to<br>I guess, specialise in finance, but also some who are, for example,<br>like myself complementing my current career with financial skills.<br>So the guest lectures were designed perfectly to complement each of the quarters.<br>And obviously they were of amazing calibres as well.<br>So that was that was one of my highlights from MAppFin.<br>Yeah. That's so good to hear. What about you, Steve. Any? Yeah, sure.<br>There's a couple of things I'd like to talk about.<br>So just last week, we had an hour and a half with Scott Bishop, who is a chief innovation officer.<br>And he was sharing real world stories from his career with us.<br>And it was things like when he worked at Microsoft with Bill Gates and when he worked at Amazon with Jeff Bezos.<br>I mean, these are - I never expected that I would be in a room hearing first-hand stories about these people, from an expert in innovation.<br>So, I mean, that was just one example. It was fascinating.<br>Scott was such an interesting speaker.<br>The other thing I'd like to mention is, aside from, guest speakers and experts from industry who come in to visit us,<br>is just how much fun and, just how much engagement we have with our peers.<br>I'm a mature student, as they say.<br>And I just have so much fun, with my peers, people in my study groups, the average age of my classes is probably between 25 and 30.<br>They'll help me with WhatsApp when I can't connect with the group.<br>And I'll give them the long view on some of the history of some of the topics we're discussing.<br>So, just the interaction with the peers has been brilliant.<br>So, so fun. They're so energising and inspirational.<br>It's amazing. Yeah.<br>And you know, that peer cohort support is so important for one to, you know, to be able to learn well and also be engaged within the programme.<br>So any other cohort related experiences that really stood out for you and you would want to talk about?<br>So, I mean, my cohort experience is also excellent as well.<br>We are a kind of very fun and dynamic cohort because we have very diverse cultural and educational backgrounds.<br>Like what Steve say, actually, our age is ranged from twenty-something, or maybe 22 or 23 to maybe 40 or 50.<br>So it's very diverse. And some of my cohort is already pursuing their second master's degree,<br>while other is already in their managerial position and want to expand their knowledge and skills in business analytics.<br>And there are also some people like me, who just recently graduated with their bachelor's degree and want to shift their career focus.<br>And this diversity really enriched our discussion and our learning experience during the lecture, because everyone had their unique perspective<br>and then it just sparked ideas. I'm a big believer of social capital, and I believe that, when we are with others,<br>when we're learning with others, that adds a richness to both our professional and personal lives.<br>So, coming back to that last bit, if somebody has to join or enrol into your programme, what kind of advice would you give them?<br>The first piece of advice would be to feel the fear and do it anyway.<br>If you want to do it, you can do it. I had some doubts myself.<br>But I found out that I could do it. And I think that holds for anyone.<br>I think if you want to do it, you can complete the programme. You can achieve at the level you want to achieve at.<br>So, yeah, just do it like Nike says. Some other tips or some practical tips.<br>We talked earlier about, yeah, we have busy lives and we have to fit in our studies.<br>One of the things that I do to, sort of mentally set the scene for study is to play some music.<br>So it just helps to signal me that this is my, my study time.<br>Having a good study space, if you can manage it is a good idea.<br>Use the resources. So there's so many resources, right?<br>The library. I love the library. Whether I visit online or actually come in to campus and get into the library.<br>It's an amazing place. And maybe some things that you don't think about, like the university gardens<br>down the road is a really nice place, you know, to just go for a walk, get some sunshine and fresh<br>air, that's always a good idea. Take notes would be my other piece of advice.<br>I have a stack of notebooks full of notes. Very valuable tips.<br>Thank you, Steve. What about you, Vicky? Any advice? Yeah.<br>So, I mean, my tip would be like something. Define your goal for your programme.<br>So what do you want to get from this programme and what motivates you to get deeper or go forward for this programme?<br>When you define this goal expectation for yourself that can help you to move forward.<br>Rather than just stay in a circle. And the second thing for me is just like,<br>be prepared for the demand for this programme, because we all know that our programme is run in quarters.<br>It's only ten weeks, it's very tight and stressful, and that expect to work until late night,<br>or even early morning or work doing weekend and facing stress.<br>But I will believe everyone will get used to and adapt to this, managing the workload and stress.<br>Thank you. Very valuable tips. What about you Zeera?<br>So my advice is for anyone who's considering to take any programme at the Business School at the University of Auckland is to reach out to the staff,<br>reach out to even the student advisors, and if needed, to the programme team as well.<br>Because as I have done that with Masters of Applied Finance, Marco and Elly,<br>they gave me prompt responses and really positive engagement, and that cemented my decision to come to the University of Auckland.<br>Excellent. Thank you. We pride ourselves on our programmes, as being applied and experiential.<br>So on that note, I would like to thank the three of you, Steve, Vicky and Zeera for joining me today on this chat.<br>And I absolutely had a great time listening to your experiences and hearing such<br>great things about how it has added value to your life. And to those watching,<br>I hope that this session provided you with some insights that might help you in making those big choices that you may need to make in the future.<br>If you have any questions or want to explore more, you can write to us or visit the University of Auckland website.<br>Thank you.</p></main><footer style="margin-top: 2rem; background: #0001; padding: 2rem; text-align: center;"><p>We Are The University</p><ul style="list-style-type: none; padding: 0; margin: 0;"><li><a href="/">Home</a></li><li><a href="/about">About</a></li><li><a href="/contact">Contact</a></li></ul></footer></body></html>
