of Oakland um<br>first working under or together with the<br>professor Jill Dobby so thank you Jill<br>for spotting such an amazing talent and<br>then joined the university as a lecturer<br>in 2012 actually same here when I<br>arrived uh she has over 150 publication<br>in top of venues and several Awards um y<br>sing commission has been dedicated to<br>advancing AI algorithm and technology<br>for the good of society<br>she is the funding co-director of the<br>center of machine learning for social<br>good and Y sing is one of the most<br>brilliant and hardworking uh generous<br>academic that I have met it's not<br>uncommon to receive emails from yinka<br>3 and as a head I'm truly honored to<br>have as a part of my school the title<br>for tonight talk is shaping the future<br>harnessing AI for good so please put<br>sink thank you Joan um for the kind<br>introduction uh ten kotoa um good<br>evening everyone um I'd like to thank um<br>everyone for being here today um I'm<br>really honored to be able to take this<br>opportunity not just to share my<br>research I'm doing today but the journey<br>that brought me<br>here from the early moments that sparked<br>my curiosity to the experience that<br>shaped my life uh I'll be discussing how<br>these moment led me to the work I'm<br>passionate about um AI for social<br>good so um as with all inaugural<br>lectures I'm going to give you a little<br>bit about myself um I'm originally from<br>Malaysia I was born in quanton and<br>that's a little pin there is um the<br>location of my town I was born in this<br>is this town is on the east coast of the<br>peninsula Malaysia um it's a town which<br>has beautiful beaches um both both my<br>parents were teachers um they taught<br>math and physics at high school and from<br>a young age I saw firstand their passion<br>on for education and how tiredly they<br>work to inspire their students and their<br>dedication left or Mark in my life as<br>well so when they say ex your experience<br>shape your path this is definitely true<br>so my dad received a scholarship to<br>pursue his Masters in Education in<br>Pittsburgh and that was in 1984 I was<br>six so now you guys know how old I<br>am the whole um family moved to<br>Pittsburgh so the photo here you see uh<br>is the photo that my dad took of us and<br>um I am the one on the left my sister is<br>in the middle and that's with my<br>mom uh we lived in Pittsburgh for two<br>years um I also like mention I have a<br>brother he's coming uh he's not there<br>yet um and and this was particularly<br>significant in my life because my dad<br>also did some courses in computer<br>science at that time and it was the<br>first time I've ever seen a computer lab<br>at a university so this was very<br>inspiring to me um I got to use a<br>computer um and um it is a moment I'll<br>never forget because they were rows and<br>rows of great pinball machines that's<br>what I thought at that time so when my<br>parents returned to Malaysia my my my<br>and us when family went back to Malaysia<br>my parents had saved up money to buy us<br>a piano but instead my dad got<br>us an IBM<br>286 so this is a similar one that I had<br>um and I would spend hours on it playing<br>games now it isn't surprise when we all<br>grew up this this my I'm on the far<br>right and my sisters in the middle and<br>then my brother it wasn't a surprise<br>that all three of us had somewhat of a<br>interesting career choice so I'm a<br>computer scientist and You' got two<br>electrical<br>engineers so um I think part of it is<br>that exposure to computer and that<br>passion that my dad had um and showed us<br>that computers were cool now moving<br>along ahead um there are certain M<br>moments in my life that I like to talk<br>about about this is the school where I<br>comp completed my form six which is<br>equivalent to uh year 13 here so we took<br>a national exam called um<br>stpm which serves as an entrance exam to<br>public universities in Malaysia um it is<br>similar to the structure that they have<br>in Cambridge a levels um so while I was<br>waiting for my results I decided to take<br>a job as a temporary<br>teacher so as was just out of school<br>high school I took a job as temporary<br>teacher I taught math to 13 and 14 year<br>olds and the classes were organized<br>based on grades starting from class<br>grade uh Class A and you go down from<br>there I taught classes d and e so on the<br>first day I went in I got so much advice<br>on crowd control in<br>highsight this was a warning sign for me<br>so I taught a couple of months and it<br>was really challenging um but one of my<br>most memorable experience was on my last<br>day so one of the class students came up<br>to me during um to the staff room during<br>recess and they were like oh can you<br>come back to a class with us and I went<br>back um with<br>them surprisingly what they had done<br>done was they knew it was my last day<br>they bought a<br>cake and um and we had the cake together<br>and but wasn't what it wasn't cake but<br>what it there some of them had come up<br>to me afterwards they said thank you<br>thank you for caring basically and that<br>was the moment that I knew that I was<br>going to join<br>Academia so fast forward um I did I went<br>to University of Malaya I did my<br>bachelor's degree in computer science<br>and this was the graduation ceremony<br>where my degree was confirmed um the<br>person that was conferring was um his<br>Royal Highness Sultan nazarin sha at the<br>time he was representing his dad um the<br>royal ro highness um the late Sultan aan<br>muhib sha who was the chancellor of the<br>University of<br>Malaya so after completing my degree I<br>decided that I want to specialize so I<br>did a MERS in software<br>engineering so after I did my master in<br>software engineering I sort of thought I<br>actually have a propensity for research<br>I really like this so what did I want to<br>do so<br>I decided to delve deeper so I searched<br>around for um um what I wanted to do so<br>I knew I want to do a different type of<br>research I want to go into machine<br>learning<br>basically so I applied for a position in<br>University of tago and I was fortunate<br>enough to actually uh receive a<br>scholarship so I channeled my inner kiwi<br>and said sweet she'll be right and<br>jumped on a<br>plane so um my PhD focused on machine<br>learning and that was in<br>2004 um which I when I started um I was<br>supervised by Richard o'keith and Nathan<br>rry they were fantastic<br>supervisors and they started um then<br>they taught me what research was um in<br>machine learning and they actually<br>taught me what a good supervisor should<br>be U uh in terms of that was the first<br>time I've actually sort of looked at<br>what a good PhD should supervisor um<br>should be<br>um<br>so 3 years later this is the day I<br>submitted my PhD for<br>examination I found a photo of it<br>um and<br>then I did I had a graduation ceremony I<br>don't in that photo in the on the left I<br>don't remember what I did with my<br>chocolate fish for those who graduated<br>from atago um when you submit your PhD<br>for examination you get a chocolate fish<br>I don't remember what I did to it I<br>think I ate it by this time<br>um now the photo that you have in<br>graduation we walk down the procession<br>this is on Joy Street and the person<br>next to me is um Nathan um he was my<br>supervisor he was my second supervisor a<br>month after this particular photo was<br>taken<br>um I was hired at aut uh by Professor<br>Albert Yip I spent three years there um<br>teaching it was a more of a teaching<br>position and then later um in 2010 um<br>Jill hired me as a research fellow and<br>this is where and I this became my<br>family so growing up in Malaysia there's<br>a couple of things um one thing that we<br>face every day and experience um well<br>not every day but some of the things<br>that we experience is what we call<br>flooding so growing up in east coast in<br>peninsul Malaysia I experience Monsoon<br>Seasons everywhere and it will rain for<br>weeks on<br>end most years we Face flood incidents<br>and this is a sign significant problem<br>so and Malaysia has the and flooding is<br>the most prominent um natural Hazard<br>that Malaysia face each year<br>approximately 28,000 square kilometers<br>are inundated and<br>4.82 million people are affected so the<br>damages can cause to a billion ring it<br>which you divide that by three uh for<br>New Zealand and that's yearly so most<br>Malaysian have one story related to<br>flooding and mine is one that's<br>particularly memorable to me was the day<br>was one that occurred at school I was a<br>school kid we were at school and<br>suddenly Water started rushing into our<br>classroom and in a panic we scrambled on<br>chairs and then later on table to<br>actually hope hope hoping that the water<br>would go down it might sound bizarre uh<br>but that was the reality of the<br>situation that we lived in so flooding<br>isn't just a statistics there but is<br>part of our lives and underscores um the<br>need for Effective solution and<br>resilience in planning our communities<br>so it comes to where I'm coming from<br>from this point so the ability to<br>contribute to creating technologies that<br>would make a world a better place have<br>been something I careed a lot about and<br>I believe AI can do this and I have<br>devoted my career um to improve AI<br>Technologies so imagine a world where<br>technology could dramatically improve<br>lives of people and from vulnerable<br>communities AI has the potential to do<br>this but it is not a magic solution to<br>truly make an impact we need to ground<br>innovation in rigorous research act<br>responsibility and bring together the<br>different voices to<br>collaborate AI is already being used to<br>further all 17 um un sdg goals and from<br>eliminating poverty to sustain establish<br>sustainable cities and communities and<br>providing quality education uh for all<br>AI has opened new<br>possibilities but the power also brings<br>with it the need to assure it is<br>harnessed and trusted and you in<br>responsible ways and the RIS are<br>monitored and managed actively to avoid<br>unintended<br>consequences<br>so this comes to my next baby the sorry<br>my kids are up front this is my other<br>baby at work<br>baby so um in<br>2022 there was a call for uh<br>centers uh specifically I was really<br>excited because this is a platform where<br>we could support Technologies and<br>projects in AI for social good uh more<br>strategically together with Professor<br>Jill Doby and Dr Daniel Wilson we<br>founded the center of machine learning<br>for social good now the mission of the<br>center um is to Advanced fundamental<br>knowledge in machine learning and data<br>analytics while addressing the most<br>challenging and pressing Health<br>environment and societ societal problems<br>of our time so this is a first center in<br>Alora uh focusing on social good by<br>using machine learning in a<br>collaborative way with domain experts as<br>a catalyst to solve high impact societal<br>issues so today I'm going to talk about<br>three case studies that we've actually<br>worked<br>on now the first one um is on harnessing<br>AI to safeguard<br>biodiversity now this Center was founded<br>on the principle of co-production<br>aligning early with stakeholders for our<br>first Le project we wanted something<br>something that resonate with our mission<br>so we partnered with tahiki a local<br>community near um Oakland specifically<br>on wahi island now one of the problems<br>challenges they have faced is they've<br>managed to eradicate well managed to<br>actually reduce the number of stoes uh<br>population just to a couple of breeding<br>pairs so as we know stes are a pest in<br>New Zealand specifically a significant<br>threat to native birds and we want to we<br>wanted to actually propose an AI<br>solution for them to actually allow them<br>to manage their sted population<br>specifically we developed we are trying<br>to develop an AI system to re-identify<br>individual um stoes to support the<br>ongoing conservation efforts so there<br>has been a lot of um work that's been<br>done to look at identifying specific<br>species but to re identify individuals<br>was a different ball game<br>altogether the re main reason why we<br>want to do that is it's important to<br>allow us to precisely track the thirat<br>population to make sure that there's<br>only that few that were there and there<br>is no much no more than that so before I<br>continue IID like to acknowledge the<br>students involved um in this project<br>which I've underlined their name Justin<br>D Yugo and Thomas<br>now um beyond that um one of the things<br>that toiki had was um camera traps or<br>trail cameras they had about 210 of them<br>so they have that data so what we did<br>was we asked to see they ask whether<br>they could share the data and what we<br>wanted to do was to come up with a tech<br>or an AI solution for them to allow them<br>to re-identify individual stes and for<br>population tracking and management to do<br>that we had two things we had to first<br>get the images we had to detect whether<br>there was there was whether there was<br>sto or no sto using Ai and then in the<br>next phase we tried to re-identify<br>individual stes so what we did first as<br>any AI um researcher would do was try<br>something out of the box so we took an<br>AI technique called YOLO which stands<br>for you only look once um and it is a<br>technique that allows us to quickly and<br>accurately detect objects and in images<br>and<br>videos so we specifically chose this<br>because it was open source and we wanted<br>something that was that would allow<br>tooray wakiki to use without incurring<br>extra cost on them for<br>them so of course AI never works when<br>you first try it out so this is what we<br>get so you see that this image we have a<br>it's detected something with a bounding<br>box the Box around it and you look at it<br>you say it's class there's a category<br>with a confidence level so you see that<br>there's a sto but it looks like a sheep<br>apparently to to um to the AI and this<br>looks like a dog to the<br>AI and the next one it misses the sto<br>all together and it detects that there's<br>a train at the<br>back and of course it detects other<br>things things as well so this one turned<br>into uh a bird instead of a hedgehog so<br>we did something else called fine-tuning<br>fine tuning and machine learning is a<br>process of adapting a pre-trained model<br>here is the YOLO model um for a specific<br>Tas or use case so we took those images<br>we trained the AI models<br>further and what we can see now is we've<br>managed to actually detect the sto<br>properly um and we've done that well too<br>we've done that well too now actually<br>managed to actually detect that although<br>it's bit obscured and it's actually<br>managed to also look at um detect Tech<br>Hedgehog as well because we gave it some<br>Hedgehog images as<br>well so um it's actually working pretty<br>well you can actually detect the stoes<br>and with different confidence levels and<br>different type of angles so it's all<br>good but there are still issues so when<br>we realized that the if the sto was kind<br>of obscured from a very different angle<br>this is a angle where we had it going um<br>the camera was just facing down on it at<br>the back of his head it detected as a<br>WKA this is a no no this is not a WKA so<br>we had to do uh further fine tuning and<br>what which meant that we did something<br>called Data augmentation a data<br>augmentation is artificially generating<br>new data from existing data and this<br>allows us to actually get you a more<br>diverse real Real World um data data set<br>and this typically um allows the process<br>to generalize to unseen data and overall<br>improv performance of um real world<br>problems when we do data<br>augmentation so that was the first step<br>now the Second Step here is that we<br>wanted to re-identify individual stes<br>now this is a key problem that we had<br>and it's actually quite a challenging<br>problem<br>our Reid model needed to meet two key<br>criterias once one it must learn<br>effectively from only a limited number<br>of identified individual available this<br>is Avail available known as label data<br>second the model needed to have the<br>ability to transfer Knowledge from<br>previously seen individual to help them<br>distinguish between individual they have<br>never encountered before so the core<br>architecture we use and this is a game<br>changer was the um open ai's clip model<br>this is a new type of deep learning<br>architecture this stands for uh clip<br>stands for contrastive language image<br>pre-training and this was introduced in<br>2021 so what is interesting about this<br>is that it uses<br>a image and text together um it's<br>trained on 400 million image text pairs<br>in a self-supervised manner<br>essentially what it does is Maps the<br>text and images into a specific same<br>specific embedding<br>space so that's the first step that's<br>basic architecture so we altered this<br>particular<br>architecture in our technique uh called<br>care so clip based animal<br>reunification we use this textural<br>guidance generator to extract semantic<br>knowledge about stoes the knowledge then<br>guides our model to focus are more<br>important visual content um and this is<br>through the text guide attention model<br>and this improves our accuracy of the<br>individual<br>identification so what did we get so<br>this is still very preliminary um this<br>particular project we have managed to<br>identify stes so the first three stes on<br>top are the same stes the three stes on<br>the bottom are also one particular<br>another sto so there's two stes on this<br>particular image you might say you<br>saying it's very easy we can detect it<br>too so this is a harder one so the top<br>ones are one sto and the bottom one is a<br>different sto for us we we actually have<br>a hard time differentiating between<br>those but the AI could differentiate<br>between um these two stes and you might<br>call how so I will tell you a trick that<br>we did the top data is actually from<br>Tiana those are STS from Tiano and the<br>bottom ones are STS from weiki so we<br>know that there are unless they cousins<br>visiting up from the south we know that<br>they are actually different<br>stes and that's uh one thing so I sort<br>of point out to our uh about our Center<br>and our Center really um focuses on<br>co-production so one of the things that<br>we did very early on is we actually went<br>and visited to kuray hiiki now image<br>credit to this the photos were taken by<br>chill so we have our students and we<br>went and visited them to actually<br>understand their needs and understand<br>what they<br>needed um and that's that's our trip on<br>that particular day we had a fun<br>day so the next um project I'm going to<br>talk about is Lake water quality<br>monitoring using machine learning so<br>maintaining water quality is essential<br>uh for the health of ecosystem human<br>population and sustainable<br>development so<br>this is not without<br>um I specifically chose this example<br>because it resonated with me I have an<br>experience when I was about eight or n<br>years old my dad took me to visit a<br>family friends land um in the district<br>called Su lbang it's actually a District<br>close to Quan<br>town now Su lbang used to be a tin<br>mining town and there was a lake on the<br>land um where my my Dad's friend own but<br>the lake had become contaminated with<br>harmful metals like arsenic because of<br>the abandoned mind polluting um the<br>nearby ground water for years so they<br>tried all sort of methods to clean it up<br>during that visit that day I was very<br>very young I learned a couple a lot of<br>things I learned what arsenic was I<br>learned what litmus paper was which was<br>great but one thing that was really<br>bizarre to me and I remember it till<br>this day was that they finally what they<br>did after they did all the testing was<br>they brought out a bucket of<br>fish live fish and they threw it into a<br>pond I asked what it was for they said<br>well if it lives it's clean<br>enough so when I forward passw to this<br>day I had a privilege of being part of<br>the MBI TI program which was mounted in<br>2020 uh where we explored how Ai and<br>data science could be applied to real<br>world environmental issues so at that<br>time we had we're trying to look for use<br>cases Karen Brian suggest that we look<br>at uh order quality and I that<br>immediately immediately stuck with uh me<br>so the goal was to explore how machine<br>learning can be used to monitor Lake<br>water<br>and so what happens nowadays is that<br>there's different ways of monitoring it<br>so you can have have Institute water<br>which means that somebody goes out and<br>test the water this is very late very<br>precise but very very expensive and<br>costly but with machine learning we've<br>have the poent to potential to monitor<br>the water quality more efficiently<br>across larger area with better temporal<br>spatial<br>coverage so why do we care specifically<br>why do we care about harmful argade<br>blooms these are<br>Al balloons that have serious<br>consequences so first of all they can<br>harm local ecosystem by depleting the<br>oxygen in the water secondly they can<br>destroy aquaculture Industries<br>contaminating shellfish and farms and<br>thirdly they can harm humans where<br>they've produce toxin that could<br>contaminate drinking water and even<br>cause poisoning if ingested so the<br>challenges that we have is I said it was<br>really expensive to collect these data<br>you might get five to 20 points per Lake<br>up to a few hundred per region and<br>different lakes have different<br>biogo Optical properties which means<br>that what works for one Lake might not<br>work for a different Lake for example<br>Lake W carry is a shallower lake and<br>Lake too is a deeper Lake both with<br>different Tropic<br>States so what we wanted to do and I<br>will say that what and say I say<br>Collective we because most of the work<br>was was done by my PhD student<br>Oli and he also has just also point out<br>that he just um submitted his PhD for<br>examination as well um but what we<br>wanted to do was to build an accurac and<br>comprehensive model to monitor lake with<br>remote sensing data and Institute<br>measurements so the remote sensing data<br>we're dealing with is satellite data so<br>satellite goes around the earth once or<br>twice uh a today you're getting a lot of<br>data that way but all of these data is<br>called un we call unlabeled data because<br>you don't have the ground truth to it<br>but you can match it up with institu<br>data where the environments and<br>scientists has gone out and collected<br>the data<br>so what this allows us to do is combine<br>both remote sensing and Institute data<br>and we can leverage the strength of both<br>of these methods to generate a better<br>model to predict what the water quality<br>looks like and track changes across time<br>so one of the things that we did was we<br>built this machine learning model called<br>semi-supervised learning that leveraged<br>the data from satellite and also<br>Institute data and we called this wash<br>dusting passan regularization and we<br>applied it in a semi-supervised manner<br>over mixture density Network this is an<br>ongoing case study this was one of the<br>earlier case studies that we did for<br>Lake White carry so the shape of it<br>changes a little bit because there's<br>cloud coverage we're trying to map the<br>um the the Lake based on satellite<br>imagery and when um the green means that<br>is okay red means that it has a high<br>chlorophyll concentration or in pro at<br>proxy to alga<br>blooms we actually were able to um<br>predict um<br>quite<br>accurately um the concentration levels<br>and we compared it against um and we<br>compared it against um information that<br>we<br>had so um most of this and I this one<br>thing that I really um really really<br>appreciate with uh projects like this<br>and I'm really um super happy with um<br>this particular project because it is<br>all open source most of my projects are<br>open source because I believe in<br>collaborating with<br>others so um if you want to look at more<br>about this project is on a tial platform<br>and tial is a community website designed<br>to bring environmental scientists and<br>data scientists and Academia together<br>and to share resources and<br>collaborate now of course it would be<br>uh really a m of me to actually not<br>bring It full circle and talk about deep<br>learning algorithms for downscaling<br>extreme precipitation considering<br>flooding was where I started uh this<br>journey on so for the final case study<br>I'm going to talk a little bit about our<br>deep learning algorithm for downscaling<br>extreme weather precipitation this was<br>done last year by Thomas he was a master<br>student at time now he's a PhD student<br>and conjunction with niwa uh Nish rampal<br>and Peter Gibson from Nea and one of the<br>things in um I'm going to talk about is<br>how we develop a deep learning algorithm<br>for downscaling extreme precipitation so<br>climate model while essential for<br>simulating future weather and climate<br>conditions often operates at very coarse<br>level so these are insufficient for<br>capturing local scale phenomenon so<br>especially extreme precipitation events<br>like extreme<br>rainfall so one of the projects that we<br>did was trying to look at Global and<br>Regional climate models and these models<br>gives us a big picture view of<br>precipitation patterns but their<br>resolution is often too course to be<br>able to capture local<br>variations especially for extreme<br>weather events um like intense rainfall<br>so downscaling is a technique used to<br>bridge this Gap it translate this course<br>scale model data into high resolution<br>data for local prediction so typical<br>downscale meth methods while useful<br>often struggles to predict extreme<br>precipitation due to the Rarity and<br>complex uh complexity of these events so<br>for example um<br>normally current techniques such as uh<br>regressive methods um often over fits to<br>underpredict high intensity uh extreme<br>so don't don't predict as much as it<br>should be whereas while low intensity um<br>events are often over predicted so those<br>are problem so so to actually solve this<br>well no not really solve but to improve<br>on<br>this we developed an ensemble based<br>algorithm called quantal regression<br>Ensemble and what this does is it looks<br>at disaggregating the precipitation<br>intensities so what we're doing is we're<br>training a bunch of weak Learners or<br>training a bunch of models um for each<br>of those quantales and combining them<br>together overall it reduces um the mean<br>squared error by about 5% which is<br>actually pretty<br>good so that's the third uh project I'm<br>I have sort of um actually sort of<br>mentioned so there are a selection of<br>other projects that we do in the center<br>and these I'm going to mention some of<br>our other AI for social good projects<br>quite quickly um<br>so alongside different collaborators um<br>my students have and I have been<br>involved in various diverse projects<br>focusing on assisting un SG goals so<br>we've worked on on our voices um led by<br>um Kane who is here today um and this<br>project aims to understand the diverse<br>experience of Youth in outa to help<br>improve policies and service for their<br>well-being we've also worked on a<br>personalized glucose level forecasting<br>projects that uses AI to help with type<br>two pre-diabetic uh to manage their<br>health better um we've gone through um<br>focusing on Extreme um event air quality<br>events to enable quicker response to Pro<br>protect Public Health we've gone we've<br>completed a whole range of uh work this<br>um this is just a sample of the projects<br>that we've been working on in the past<br>three<br>years so some of the key takeaways going<br>through all these type of project what<br>did I actually learn from this so the<br>first is that the first step is to<br>clearly Define the specific challenge<br>that we want AI to solve some of the<br>problems that people bring to me has no<br>AI component to it and AI they don't<br>need AI to solve it so understanding<br>where and when AI can be applied and<br>when AI shouldn't be applied is actually<br>the first<br>step so the next is essential essential<br>to engage with stakeholder early on in<br>the process these this means working<br>with communities and stakeholders as<br>well as experts and policy makers this<br>gives us a well-rounded understanding<br>and help ensures that the AI solution<br>are both practical and relevant and<br>that's from day<br>one and the final one<br>is while off-the-shelf AI might work um<br>we have to acknowledge that there isn't<br>a one-size fitall um solution AI methods<br>must be adapted for specific problems uh<br>that we are tackling and is crucial to<br>remain flexible and open to tailored<br>approaches so before I finish I'd like<br>to actually take a moment to celebrate<br>the success of my current and past<br>students so without your efforts we<br>wouldn't have been able to achieve what<br>we<br>have<br>so beyond that as I conclude I also like<br>to take a moment to express my sincere<br>gratitude first I want to acknowledge<br>the former and current head of schools<br>Joel Robert and joavan Jill thank you<br>for bringing me on board as a research<br>fellow<br>and your ongoing mentorship and<br>guidance um Robert um I appreciate your<br>steadfast<br>support and Giovani your leadership and<br>encouragement have made a significant<br>impact on my<br>career each of you have played a crucial<br>role in my<br>journey I also want to extend my<br>appreciation to all my current<br>collaborators I have I hope I haven't<br>left anybody out I was very worried when<br>I was actually creating the this list um<br>your dedication expertise have enriched<br>our projects and making them possible<br>and<br>impactful to my current and past<br>students thank you together we're making<br>a difference and I look forward to our<br>continued<br>collaboration and most importantly I<br>must acknowledge my family my parents my<br>husband Chris and my kids Your Love<br>patience and support means the world to<br>me and I couldn't have done it without<br>you so thank you once again for coming<br>in your time and I hope you guys grab a</p></main><footer style="margin-top: 2rem; background: #0001; padding: 2rem;
