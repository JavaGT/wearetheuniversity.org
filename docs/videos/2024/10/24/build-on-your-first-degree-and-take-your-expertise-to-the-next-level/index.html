Graduates of our PhD and Master of Commerce programmes emerge as specialists,<br>ready for roles that demand in-depth knowledge and make a tangible difference in the business world.<br>When you study at New Zealand's number one business school, you'll engage with today's leading business minds.<br>Then you'll have the opportunity to deepen your expertise in a subject area you care about.<br>You can choose from three pathways within our new, revitalised Master of Commerce.<br>Depending on the type of project you'd like to undertake and your appetite for research.<br>You can choose to work on a bigger supervised research project,<br>a smaller research project with some extra courses, or a consulting project with a New Zealand organisation.<br>If you're considering business consulting or other professional careers,<br>our new applied research pathway in the 180-point MCom enhances your research and consultancy skills to prepare you for those roles.<br>As well as the new pathway options for you in our restructured and updated MCom programme,<br>we also have exciting new courses such as Responsible Business, Economic Development<br>and Wellbeing, Financial Machine Learning and Information and Digital Economy.<br>You'll cultivate critical thinking and problem solving abilities to tackle complex challenges and thrive in a dynamic work landscape.<br>You can become a specialist in an area of your choice: Accounting, Commercial Law, Economics, Finance, GLMI,<br>which is International Business, Innovation and Management, Information Systems, Marketing or Operations and Supply Chain Management.<br>We've got you covered. The University and the Business School award a number of scholarships for our MCom students annually.<br>Our doctoral scholarships offer opportunities for students to work on a funded research project supervised by our staff.<br>We advise you to apply for a scholarship at the same time as your application for admission,<br>and to check out the Business School website for information on PhD scholarship funded research projects.<br>If you're considering an academic career, you'll need to have a BCom Honours, or equivalent, or a masters degree in a business subject<br>to get into the programme.<br>If your masters is not in business or you don't have research training or experience, we have bridging programme options for you.<br>So I caught up recently with two brilliant research students from the Business School and my colleague,<br>Associate Professor Fernando Beltran from the Department of Information Systems and Operations Management.<br>We had a conversation about what it's like to undertake the PhD and research masters.<br>Let's take a look.<br>Joining me today are some current research students from the Business School and my colleague, Associate Professor Fernando Beltran.<br>- Rachel, would you like to introduce yourself, please?<br>- Thank you.<br>My name is Rachel Ma. I'm studying a Master of Commerce in Economics.<br>- Lahiru.<br>- My name is Lahiru Gunasekara, PhD candidate in Operations and Supply Chain Management.<br>- And Fernando.<br>- Thank you. I am Fernando Beltran, Associate Professor of Information Technology at the Business School.<br>Rachel, can you tell us what drew you to the MCom degree and about your background prior to this?<br>Thank you. So I joined the University in 2019. I did a conjoint in Bachelor of Global Studies and the Bachelor of Commerce,<br>where I majored in International Relations, and I studied German European Studies.<br>For my BCom side, I majored in Economics. For my Global Studies research project,<br>it's very similar to what I'm doing for my masters thesis.<br>- So my current research should build on that.<br>- Fantastic.<br>Thanks, Rachel. Lahiru, what drew you to the PhD programme and what's your background prior to that?<br>I completed my undergraduate in Sri Lanka, after completing my undergrad,<br>I went on to pursue my masters degree in China.<br>After that, I wanted to pursue a PhD degree as well.<br>And I followed three criteria, I would say. First one was the country, then the university, and finally the superviser.<br>So New Zealand, Auckland University, and my main superviser, Professor David Robb and Dr Subhamoy Ganguly,<br>they all were a perfect fit for me to come to New Zealand for my studies.<br>And the main reason for the PhD was that I always wanted to do a contribution in academia in terms of research,<br>and I always preferred to pursue a career in academia.<br>Very good. Thank you. That's great.<br>So as you can see from these examples, our research-oriented programmes enable you to build your career pathways and benefit you in a number of ways.<br>First of all, they build on your earlier study and take you to an advanced specialisation,<br>and in that you develop advanced specialised knowledge in your chosen field.<br>You learn career-enhancing research skills, whether for practical industry employment or for further study.<br>They prepare you for advanced qualifications, as is the case in the PhD.<br>They can really broaden your career pathways, taking you into management situations,<br>consulting, any business or government roles, NGOs and into academic careers.<br>- Over to you, Fernando.<br>- Thank you. Can you briefly describe what your research is about and how it will impact our communities?<br>- Rachel?<br>- So, I'm studying behavioural and experimental economics<br>with Professor Ananish Chaudhuri. And our research is focused on luck-based and merit-based inequality, which is<br>very, very important to our society because we know that inequality relates to everyone in the country and in the world.<br>And it's not only income inequality, but also related to the educational side of the society.<br>So it's more than just a business context.<br>- Lahiru.<br>- I work in the emerging discipline of circular economy, in particular, I'm looking into used product take-back.<br>So what do you mean by that? We know organisations keep selling products, as consumers<br>we buy them. And at the end of the day, we throw them away to landfill.<br>So what I'm working on is how to get organisations to take back those used products in order to recycle them.<br>So with the environment in interest, many organisations, not just in New Zealand, globally<br>are engaging in this used product take-back, but it's not easy due to the uncertainty of the returns coming back to them.<br>So I'm developing some tools to help retailers to use them in order to make sure that their take-back process is<br>optimised, cost-effective and sustainable.<br>So my research approach is practical, whereas I'm working with some of the organisations,<br>like one of the major retailers in New Zealand and also one of the global electronic equipment manufacturers in two of the projects.<br>So what we call practice-based research. So I'm collaborating with them after identifying two of their problems that are research-worthy.<br>So I'm trying to solve a problem for them,<br>and I'm trying to generalise it as a global solution where any retailer in the world could use and also, work on my PhD with that.<br>That's amazing. And what have been the highlights of your degree course so far?<br>Course-wise and academic-wise, I think we really have a lot of great workshops within the faculty as well as at the University as a whole,<br>because I attended a few research-based workshops and they talk about how to do literature review,<br>how to use our resources like the library to find the resource that you need.<br>I personally find it very, very useful, especially for our research students and for masters students in particular,<br>because if you just joined the University as a research student, and very often we don't quite know how to find that resource.<br>- So that's why I find these workshops really, really useful.<br>- That's great.<br>- What about you, Lahiru?<br>- I can mention maybe two of the key highlights.<br>One of them is quite recent, where I actually participated in a research conference<br>in Paris, so that I could couple it up with some academic meetings in the Europe region.<br>And it was one of the major conferences in my field from 2023.<br>And one of the perks of being in academia, I must say, and the Business School always sponsors us,<br>the PhD students and encourages us to go participate in those kind of conferences.<br>And the other one is, so when it comes to my PhD thesis,<br>it's a collection of three papers, what we call a thesis with publications or with papers.<br>So it's not an easy journey to get a paper published.<br>So I was able to get my first paper published in one of the major journals in the field.<br>So those are two key highlights as a PhD student at the Business School.<br>And apart from that, I've been able to participate in some other competitions and case competitions<br>and events of that nature to get some achievements.<br>- That's great.<br>- Wonderful. Tell us, how have you found working with your research superviser?<br>I met Professor Ananish Chaudhuri in 2021.<br>So I became one of his students in one of the courses that he taught.<br>And since then, he provided many insightful comments and knowledge throughout even my bachelors studies.<br>And he helped a lot for other research projects of mine.<br>And so now, I think how he impacts me the most is not only the knowledge, but also the passion and the compassion.<br>So passionate, and the time management skills as well.<br>It's very, very useful not only for my research project itself, but also for my studies as a whole.<br>- And how about your experience Lahiru?<br>- It has been wonderful.<br>In summary, I've worked the most with my main superviser, Professor David Robb, and I was one lucky PhD student.<br>Like, I was lucky to be picked up by him at the airport when I arrived in New Zealand.<br>And even after that, he and I have had a family-like relationship.<br>Like I've been invited to his place many a time. Got to know his entire family.<br>But apart from that, when it comes to the PhD supervision itself, he's very caring, detailed<br>and he guides me all the time to come to my achievements.<br>And also I meet him every week or the most every two weeks.<br>And he has been a wonderful superviser, and my second superviser as well.<br>Very helpful to get my milestones achieved and to get my work done.<br>And most important, especially I have had some downtimes with the Covid lockdowns.<br>I think many of my colleagues as PhD students went through that.<br>But my supervisers were really helpful, like, emotionally, as well, you know, to pursue the PhD career.<br>So thank you for sharing such wonderful experiences.<br>And now let me tell you from a staff perspective, from my own perspective, what this experience has been about.<br>So as a superviser, my work starts way before my students arrive in New Zealand.<br>Most of the time they are international students. And I engage with them on their email, just back and forth<br>trying to find what is it that makes them tick, and why they want to work with me.<br>And finally, after a long process, usually when they finally arrive<br>we start a series of conversations just like you've been having with your supervisers, regular meetings.<br>But there's a very special ingredient in all of this is that, when you come from abroad<br>I do it as my mission to actually try to bring the students<br>into our environment, not just to deal with the student as one more student<br>but someone who's going to spend with me three, four, sometimes five years.<br>And that is very important in my consideration from that moment, a good relation has to be established with clear<br>roles and clear activities and everything like that.<br>But at the end of the day, as human beings getting to know each other and having common passion for something<br>they are going to work on for a long time.<br>The University offers plenty of support for our research students, especially when it comes to, for example, research commercialisation.<br>Through things like the University's Centre for Innovation and Entrepreneurship and other services.<br>So perhaps I can ask the students what other support services have you accessed as a research student here at the University of Auckland?<br>- Rachel, first.<br>- Okay. So I think based on my experiences, I really, really enjoyed all of the academic workshops.<br>And also within the Department of Economics, we have regularly scheduled presentations.<br>We invite not only the students, but also some faculty staff and some other professionals from outside the University.<br>And we invite them to give presentations, to share their experience and to share their studies as well.<br>So that's what I really, really enjoyed based on my experience so far.<br>- Lahiru, what about you?<br>- Well as a PhD candidate, there are many services I've accessed.<br>So one of them is the services provided by the library, because we can book an appointment with them whenever we want<br>especially to get some guidance towards how to look for literature.<br>And there are many tools available, reference management tools and other software that the University has subscribed to.<br>All the major software and tools that we can use free of charge as students. And the School of Graduate Studies organise a lot of<br>workshops. Sometimes it may feel like a trivial topic<br>but for example, how to work with your superviser.<br>Like starting from topics of that nature to more technical topics like how to do a literature review, how to get a publication done.<br>So I've participated in more than 40 workshops so far, because I keep a record of all the workshops I've participated in.<br>And also, because I work with the industry, I've received the help of UniServices to draft some collaboration agreements<br>because I'm working on some long-term projects.<br>So apart from what I mentioned, like you name it, there is a support service that any student can get in the University.<br>That's fantastic, Lahiru.<br>So, what advice would you have for people who are thinking of pursuing a research-oriented programme or a PhD here at the Business School?<br>- What would your advice be, Rachel?<br>- I think personally, I have two pieces of advice.<br>First is really make good use of the University website, because I think here at University of Auckland, we have a very, very detailed<br>designed website that literally contains everything that you need for the programme and the details for the supervisers and potential topics,<br>everything that you need. You can find it on the website. So do have a good look at that.<br>And the second piece of advice is, if you're just thinking about doing it, maybe just reach out and start early.<br>Reach out to your supervisers and reach out to your student advisers; reach out to any staff, and they'll be happy to help.<br>Very good. And Lahiru, your advice please.<br>So I've mentioned about my criteria of PhD selection earlier.<br>So when it comes to an international student, first you need to think about the country.<br>Second, the university. So the country, quality of life and things like that.<br>There's no doubt when it comes to New Zealand,<br>then the university, the University of Auckland, number one ranked in New Zealand and globally within the top.<br>But most important, the selection of your superviser. As Fernando mentioned, it's a long-term relationship, like 3 to 5 years potentially.<br>So how to do that? So a few things that could be done, like one thing is you need to look up about the discipline of your superviser,<br>what kind of publications they have done, what are their research interests and whether that discipline fits with what I'm interested in.<br>That's one major thing. But another key thing is talk to your potential superviser's<br>current and former PhD students to decide whether the superviser is,<br>a type of a person that you can fit with, like, because personally, I may have preferences to guide me in a micromanagement level.<br>Or sometimes some students prefer to be let alone to do your individual work on your own.<br>And so it's better to clarify the expectations at the beginning,<br>like especially when you do the initial communications with your potential superviser.<br>So then after you start your PhD journey, it would be a wonderful journey all together once you have said things cleared.<br>Such good advice. Thank you all very much indeed for sharing your experiences.<br>Thank you so much for joining us to learn about our Master of Commerce and PhD programmes.<br>I hope you've gained insights into our programmes and their suitability for your interests and career goals.<br>To learn more, please contact us or visit the University of Auckland website.</p></main><footer style="margin-top: 2rem; background: #0001; padding: 2rem; text-align: center;"><p>We Are The University</p><ul style="list-style-type: none; padding: 0; margin: 0;"><li><a href="/">Home</a></li><li><a href="/about">About</a></li><li><a href="/contact">Contact</a></li></ul></footer></body></html>
