But how well does the system of public law in Aotearoa New Zealand create conditions and provide processes that promote good decision-making and meaningful accountability? <br>In this lecture, Professor Knight examines governmental decision-making in our small-ish democracy in the South Pacific. <br><br>Professor Knight reflects especially on the vast array of processes that insist ministers, officials, and public bodies render account for their decisions and allow others to appraise their justification. In so doing, he assesses the extent to which these processes encourage wise decision-making by government. A particular focus of his enquiry is the way decision-making and accountability in New Zealand are coloured by the small-ish nature of our democracy and its institutions.</p><h2>Transcript</h2><p

am the vice Chancellor<br>of Victoria University of Wellington to<br>hinger Walker and it's my enormous<br>pleasure today to Welcome All of You<br>family friends distinguished guests<br>academic professional colleagues<br>students and our wider Community to an<br>event that I've been looking forward to<br>for some time the inaugural lecture of<br>Professor Dean<br>Knight there are many elements about<br>Dean<br>uh there's Dean the man there's Dean The<br>Scholar there's Dean the public<br>intellectual and I was asking Dean as I<br>often do before these events if he had<br>any anecdotes humorous or otherwise that<br>would humanize<br>and give a context to the Towering<br>intellect that we have sitting in the<br>front row it was very clear that the<br>answer was<br>no but I've I've had others who I've met<br>between the photo and here who have<br>embellished other elements about him so<br>starting in that order starting with the<br>man as anyone who knows him in addition<br>to his love of lordine has a love of<br>coffee and a love of rugby he's an aid<br>rugby player he's played throughout his<br>University career both in RTR and<br>overseas<br>and as yet and I have some trepidation<br>in saying this and some concern not just<br>for my not just for Dean but for the<br>University and the law school he's yet<br>to properly<br>retire he continues to play with his<br>local Club who are named the mixed<br>veggies and as I have learned in the<br>last five minutes every player in the<br>mixed veggies has their own vegetable<br>and Dean and you can read into this what<br>nightshade he also founded aro's first<br>gay men's rugby team and over the years<br>he's continued to strongly advocate for<br>gay and inclusive rugby through the<br>international network of gay rugby clubs<br>he served as chair and has recently been<br>recognized as a life member of what that<br>Global Association is if we then move to<br>the the dean the academic and starting<br>at the beginning uh he's an alumnus of<br>this esteemed law school and this<br>wonderful University toing aaka he began<br>his academic Journey here up in kelin<br>and then in the way that he covers so<br>many spares of life he transitioned<br>seamlessly down to when this building<br>was opened he completed a bachelor of<br>law with honors and a bachelor of<br>Commerce and administration he then<br>moved overseas and completed a master of<br>laws at UBC the University of British<br>Columbia and a PhD at the London School<br>of economics and political science where<br>he further as I understand refined his<br>taste for<br>coffee he rejoined the university as an<br>academic in 20 in 2005 and after a<br>number of years practicing with an<br>austral Asian law firm and has<br>specialized in litigation Public Law and<br>local government it's in that role that<br>he has built an impressive series of<br>academic credentials covering judicial<br>review of administration and action<br>local government and democracy and<br>constitutional reform he's been involved<br>in the New Zealand Center for Public Law<br>co-chaired the austral Asian chapter of<br>international Society Public Law and an<br>executive committee member for the Law<br>Society and Association of Australia and<br>New Zealand but if we then seamlessly<br>move into the third domain or the third<br>theme I'd like to talk about he has<br>transitioned not just within the Ivory<br>Tower but out to become a genuine public<br>intellectual and at a time when<br>universities are reasserting not only<br>what we are good at but what we are good<br>for this is such an important role for<br>all of us he's received the University's<br>New Zealand critic and conscience<br>Society award last year for his<br>exceptional contribution to providing<br>independent expert commentary ini is<br>impacting New Zealand community and<br>future<br>Generations<br>he's served on editorial Committees of<br>not just the Victoria University uh of<br>Wellington law review and legalities but<br>also the Australia New Zealand Journal<br>of society of law he has inspired<br>generations of students in this in our<br>law school and I regularly talk to law<br>students and I often ask them who their<br>favorite lecturer is and while the other<br>names occasionally come up here as a<br>perennial uh favorite uh among our law<br>students uh in in 2021 he was awarded<br>the teaching Excellence award an<br>Accolade for the educator whose teaching<br>philosophy focuses on creating curious<br>citizens in a capital city he does this<br>by infusing lessons with his passion for<br>public law building intellectual<br>communities through collegial<br>discussion-based learning challenging<br>students to engage with and learn from<br>the Civic word civic world that<br>surrounds them and for any of the<br>students who have come to his lecture I<br>also noce that he hands out<br>Donuts his inaugural lecture today is<br>wise decisions government accountability<br>in a smallish democracy I'm hoping and<br>expecting that de will examine<br>government decision- making discuss the<br>processes that ensure accountability and<br>evaluate how well these processes<br>encourage wise decisions consider how<br>the small size of our democracy affects<br>decision- making and once again Fosters<br>accountability ladies and gentlemen it's<br>my huge pleasure to Welcome to the<br>greetings greetings everyone my name is<br>imana I'd like to acknowledge the people<br>to whom the place we meet tonight is<br>precious<br>in greetings friends greetings in the<br>three official languages of our nation<br>and can I add warm Pacific greetings to<br>toala<br>especially thank you to the vice Chan<br>for the lovely words of welcome and<br>giving away my<br>secrets and to you my family friends<br>colleagues and fellow constitutional<br>train spotters for joining for some<br>Rants and reckons on wise decisions<br>government accountability and a smallish<br>democracy I want to start by saying it's<br>lovely delivering these remarks in a<br>place that very much Feels Like Home<br>this has been my house of law for many<br>decades you've heard from uh the the<br>vice Chancellor as a student of the<br>mid90s mid 1990s and then as a lecturer<br>from 2005 onwards and I am blessed to<br>have joined a vibrant faculty with folk<br>who care deeply about education and are<br>passionate about Illuminating law and<br>life through research and scholarship<br>and professional uh staff who tirelessly<br>support them in that mission support us<br>in that that<br>mission<br>mahim<br>colleagues I think of these Halls as our<br>Civic space where we join together in<br>community for conversations about law<br>life and learning conversations about<br>the ups and downs of<br>society conversations about how<br>collectively through our Democratic<br>processes we can grapple with the wicked<br>problems of our world and ultimately<br>improve the well-being of our peoples<br>that starts with curiosity and asking<br>good questions and requires good<br>citizenship built on humility and<br>empathy to unlock the power of<br>cooperation to be honest the only slight<br>regret is tonight's remarks are entirely<br>dactic I cherish Law's tradition here at<br>tarang aaka of learning through<br>collaborative dialogue discussion based<br>learning the language of the Socratic<br>method has rightly been largely retired<br>so to the anxiety of the seating chart<br>replaced in my classes with yellow<br>cardboard name plates for all but if any<br>of you wants to take a question mid<br>lecture just feel free to give me a<br>not now in today I learning and teaching<br>I combined as one as AO recognizing the<br>reciprocity that exists in education and<br>in that Spirit please treat these<br>remarks as beginning a conversation that<br>I hope might follow tonight where we<br>continue to learn from each other on<br>this uh important<br>topic first I a little bit more about my<br>Pathway to this lect turn tonight and<br>you've heard some of that from the VC<br>I've been pondering about the tuns that<br>have brought me here honestly I think<br>it's been quite happen St although there<br>there have been probably been some<br>preent uh<br>moments I grew up in the poong valley in<br>the menowa to son of a sheep farmer and<br>primary school teacher and it's lovely<br>to have dad taking notes I hope in the<br>front<br>row my late mom would have loved to have<br>been here too but I still get the real<br>sense of Joy when the occasional student<br>in one of my classes comes up to say<br>they were taught by Mrs Knight at<br>Primary School in ashur and for them to<br>remember her real passion for<br>learning so a farm boy along my siblings<br>Reese and bronwin who are here tonight<br>also and I should confess probably a<br>reluctant farm boy who escaped to the<br>capital city as soon as he<br>could but first educated a rural school<br>then onto a small low desile State coed<br>High School in paliston North Friberg<br>high school a school where teachers<br>involved pupils and governance and the<br>stewardship of community in a way that<br>was actually quite unusual at the<br>time now one particular memory from that<br>time is a letter to the edit editor in<br>about a decision taken at a fellow<br>school to suspend and expel a pupil for<br>drinking half a can of beer on a ski a<br>school ski trp breach of a zero<br>tolerance rule about alcohol it was<br>said well some 17 year-old boy thought<br>that that was fair and un um unfair and<br>wrong and you can see those rans and<br>wrong I didn't know it at the time the<br>school's actions were successfully<br>review in the m and Sims case Sims was<br>one of my Rugby coaches by the way um<br>and it's a case I continue to teach<br>Public Law students today so hold that<br>incident in the back of your mind will<br>come back to it now and<br>then University followed first and<br>family to do so I think Ambitions for<br>accounting and finance but so soon<br>falling in love with the Intrigue of law<br>with passionate lecturers who help grow<br>my love for Law and government and good<br>friends were happy to lend me notes for<br>the lectures I missed or to the fat<br>about law while playing pinball to all<br>hours of the morning I'll nod to some<br>other points on the journey as I go but<br>here's where I'd like to start exploring<br>ideas about wise decisions government<br>accountability within the context of our<br>smallest democracy because at the heart<br>of my discipline whether you describe it<br>as public law constitutional<br>administrative law or government law<br>lies the aspiration for good decision<br>making and robust accountability and our<br>challenge is identifying designing<br>appraising and improving the structures<br>and processes that contribute to that<br>aspiration for a system operated by<br>humans and in Alo in New Zealand by<br>relatively small numbers of humans<br>now I want to talk about judicial review<br>at some depth including its strength and<br>weaknesses in the good governance<br>project before positioning it amongst<br>its siblings and the network of<br>accountability processes alongside their<br>contribution tonight's not a night for a<br>big normative argument it's more<br>Reflections about how we might think<br>about accountability and wise decision<br>making and where that inquiry might take<br>us first something about accountability<br>and accountability that is dialogical<br>there are many ways we might Define<br>accountability but I'm a real fan of<br>Mark Bowen's framing of accountability<br>as a social<br>relationship for him accountability is a<br>relationship between an actor and Forum<br>in which an actor has an obligation to<br>explain and to justify their conduct of<br>the Forum who can then pose questions<br>and pass judgment and the actor May F<br>result now this is focused on expost<br>Factor appraisal of a decision whether<br>Express politically legally or as a form<br>of<br>learning of course we also control Power<br>in other ways especially the way we<br>distribute power or structure its<br>exercised and importantly in a small de<br>democracy by enlisting good people<br>channeling their Spirit of service and<br>honing their bureaucratic skills but<br>here I'm looking at responsibility after<br>the fact and we'll fidly remember that<br>natural dialogue arising from for<br>example ministerial<br>responsibility there's a direct and<br>formal accountability relationship<br>between ministers as actors and<br>Parliament as a forum ministers are<br>expected to explain and justify matters<br>that uh happen in their<br>portfolios MPS then interrogate<br>ministers and make judgments about their<br>stewardship of government office witness<br>here oral and written questions or<br>ministerial appearances before um select<br>committees especially during our new<br>wonderful scrutiny<br>weeks judgment is typically expressed<br>inally often in parliamentary debates or<br>utter utterances outside Parliament to<br>the media and the<br>public and ministers May then face<br>consequences such as uh public appr<br>probium or diminished electoral<br>prospects and if the confidence of their<br>colleagues or the elector is sely tested<br>loss of office these political<br>accountability conversations we hope<br>help ensure wise decisions are made and<br>for me thinking about accountability in<br>this way is helpful because it<br>foregrounds relationships expression and<br>dialogue and that idea of governing and<br>overseeing as a form of expression and<br>dialogue is also one that just Justice<br>me power and I tried to amplify our<br>recent book on the Constitution<br>especially the different voices used by<br>different actors within the system K<br>Matthew now my partner Alan is the<br>linguist in the family and he tells me<br>that law should actually be talking<br>about discourse not<br>dialogue kind of take his point on that<br>but I just would like at this moment to<br>pause and acknowledge his love support<br>and feedback during my intellectual<br>Journey and our life together the Lord<br>for so how does this conception of<br>accountability animate the mechanisms of<br>administrative law especially my first<br>review let's be honest this isn't the<br>way folk normally speak about judicial<br>review judicial review is often<br>presented as the gold standard mechanism<br>of administrative law the rule of law in<br>action we tell our students I think I<br>make them raise their hands we say the<br>law judges riding in on their white<br>horses coming to the defense of citizens<br>oppressed by some action by the massive<br>State apparatus using their special<br>judical power to cure defects in the<br>decision or decision-making process the<br>premier remedial<br>jurisdiction spoiler alert this model of<br>administrative law and judicial review<br>sometimes described as a red light<br>grounded in classic libertarian<br>philosophy now leaves me somewhat<br>cold I still remember the moment reading<br>unsurprisingly in a cafe in Vancouver<br>while working on my Alm thesis at UBC<br>under the supervision of Phil Bri and<br>West Pew it was then that I discovered<br>the green light the natural<br>contradistinction to the red a different<br>model of control and accountability as<br>explained by Carol harow and Rick<br>Rawlings but based on a different theory<br>of the state more concerned with the<br>promotion of credential decision- making<br>in the collective interest in order to<br>improve continuity as in order to<br>improve Community<br>well-being importantly for me with an<br>appreciation of how our Governors as<br>human beings make decisions and how they<br>are influenced by a complex system of<br>setings incentives processes and<br>cultures this conception is obviously uh<br>communitarian and purpose and Echoes the<br>work of the realist movement along with<br>Martin Lin's functional style most<br>interested in in how power and law is<br>applied in<br>practice of course in Al New Zealand we<br>might nod to S Jeffrey's work the new<br>Public Law from the 1990s where he<br>exhorted us to be concerned about the<br>sprawling mass of reality about how<br>public decision law decisions are made<br>and how decision makers can be<br>influenced in the content of those<br>decisions and can I Mi to S Jeffrey wo<br>there he is my former teacher as a<br>student I still remember reading your<br>Manifesto for public law in that heavy<br>pink covered uh course book and it's an<br>extract that I still share with students<br>today but back to judicial review and<br>it's place in administrative<br>law and I know there's a few L lay folk<br>here a few rugby players at the back too<br>um so I need to explain a little bit<br>more about judicial review on a basic<br>level as you may have picked up judicial<br>review is exactly what it says it's<br>reviewed by a<br>judge government decisions can be<br>challenged in court to determine their<br>propriety now in reality it's a little<br>more complex so we might sharpen our<br>definition a bit judicial review as<br>review of discretionary governmental<br>decisions by judges of the high court in<br>accordance with the principles of of<br>administrative<br>law the Fe in that in that and I just<br>want to explain it in a slightly<br>rejected<br>order the idea of discretionary<br>decisions reminds us that Parliament has<br>deliberately delegated discretionary<br>power the power to choose and decide to<br>ministers officials and public bodies<br>often in circumstances when it's more<br>efficient and effective for decisions to<br>be made on an individualized basis a<br>adapted in the light of a person's<br>individual<br>circumstances and the concrete facts<br>applying by those with particular<br>expertise and experience and with the<br>nimbleness to deliberate in ways that<br>suit the type of the decision before<br>them so think of the recor at paliston<br>North boys high school being charged<br>with decisions about discipline whether<br>an infraction meets the legislative test<br>of misconduct principles directors know<br>that and they know the context of uh the<br>school and the school<br>grounds now the idea of governmental<br>decisions tells us judicial review is a<br>creature of public law and is interested<br>in the propriety of decisions which have<br>some degree of publicness or<br>government either institutionally a<br>decision made by a public actor or<br>functionally a decision with a<br>governmental character even if made by<br>someone other than a state<br>official or conceptually and this is I<br>think the best way to think about it a<br>normative judgment that accountability<br>for a particular decision is best<br>rendered against public law<br>standards so that's governmental<br>decisions the idea of review tells us<br>the Court's role is supervisory only<br>it's not the Court's role to perform the<br>judge of ministers officials or public<br>bodies or to substitute their view for<br>that of the primary decision maker and<br>there's good constitutional reasons for<br>that first and more foremost that<br>deliberate delegation of authority<br>by the legislature to the executive the<br>important reference to the high court<br>judges of the high court that reminds us<br>that judicial review is part of the<br>Constitutional Birthright of our senior<br>courts and as a creature of the common<br>law we don't need to look to Parliament<br>to legitimize the authority of the<br>courts to supervise governmental<br>decision making the power to do so<br>arises from the very idea of<br>constitutional balance<br>judicial review is where our grand<br>constitutional principles the rule of<br>law legislative Supremacy separation of<br>powers democracy it's where those<br>principles are operationalized and where<br>the interaction is<br>mediated finally the principles<br>administrative law provide the standards<br>for appraising the governmental<br>decision decision makers are expected in<br>general terms to avoid illegality<br>procedural impropriety and irrationality<br>but each of those expectations has a<br>much more granular set of expectations<br>lying<br>underneath generally speaking too these<br>standards are created by judges<br>according to their normative vision of<br>justice and the rule of law in other<br>words judges are responsible both for<br>Designing the expectations of decision<br>makers and the general rules about how<br>the courts will scrutinize governmental<br>decisions and applying those rules in<br>individual cases when hearing and<br>determining applications for judicial<br>review repeat again judicial review is a<br>creature of the common<br>law that said the intentions and wishes<br>of parliament our elected branch of<br>government still heavily color the<br>assessment of the propriety of<br>decisionmaking because much of judicial<br>review is about ensuring the exercise of<br>Power by the delegate is faithful to the<br>terms of the<br>delegation thus in practice many of the<br>expectations policed by the courts on<br>judicial review will be Parliament<br>instructions about how a particular<br>decision a particular P sorry a<br>particular power should be exercised<br>intertwined with those General common<br>law<br>rules now it might seem a little bit<br>odd but in judicial review cases judges<br>don't get to rule on whether they think<br>the decision is wise or not their role<br>is keeping out an eye out for Flaws in<br>the application of the law or the<br>process adopted such as an incorrect<br>understanding or application the law a<br>failure to take into account relevant<br>considerations taking into account<br>something that is irrelevant making the<br>wrong decision for the making the<br>decision for the wrong motives or for an<br>improper purpose not personally<br>exercising the discretion entrusted to<br>them not following the required process<br>such as by not following the legislative<br>steps adopting an unfair process or<br>failing to give those particularly<br>affected to say or failing to act UNP uh<br>failing to act<br>impartially and those are some of the<br>more granular grounds of review that's<br>sit under the the the tripart tripartite<br>grounds that I started with and the<br>Rector in The Sims case remember that<br>failed on several counts misunderstood<br>the meaning of gross misconduct didn't<br>consider all the relevant circumstances<br>why because he rigidly applied a school<br>policy and excluded his his personal<br>exercise of discretion<br>now the substantive outcome and reasons<br>are only scrutinized to make sure the<br>decision is not absurd illogical or<br>agous and that the decision maker hasn't<br>taken leave of their senses or acted<br>irrationally in other words the courts<br>will check that the decision is not<br>manifestly<br>unreasonable or occasionally perhaps in<br>some contexts not unreasonable in the<br>ordinary sense importantly the merits of<br>the decision as we we call it are off<br>limit to the court<br>by that we mean fact finding evaluation<br>the weight to be given to the the<br>factors that should be considered and<br>the overall judgment and reasoning and<br>in The Sims case the judge reminded<br>himself that it was not his job to<br>decide what the optimal decision was it<br>was sufficient for him to note that the<br>suspension or expulsion was open to the<br>director if he properly grappled with<br>the<br>matter now that divide between law and<br>Pro on the one hand and substance and<br>merits on the other is<br>fundamental it recognizes constitutional<br>principles in play including leg just of<br>Supremacy and the separation of powers<br>acknowledging that Parliament gave the<br>job to decide to a particular executive<br>actor not the courts for good<br>reason but it also recognizes that the<br>rule of law and other principles<br>mandated important role for the courts<br>in policing the legal framework and the<br>process for the decision to be<br>taken judges need to balance as I put it<br>the competing impulses of both vigilance<br>on the one hand and restraint on the<br>other now we might be able to explain<br>that in institutional relational<br>terms two questions are implicated in<br>judicial review as Tom Paul explains<br>first there first order questions of<br>individual Justice and the propriety the<br>wisdom of a particular decision the wise<br>decision angle and SEC second order<br>institutional questions about whether<br>and how much the supervising Court<br>should quible with or second gear the<br>decision of the primary decision<br>maker alternatively we can talk about a<br>principle of Relativity as Timothy<br>indicot invites us to as a way of<br>acknowledging that carefully navigated<br>relationship between the supervising<br>court and primary decision<br>maker now our tradition here in alod New<br>Zealand has been to hardwire those<br>questions of balance into grounds of<br>review with pretty rigid character uh<br>characters sorry<br>categories with pretty rigid categories<br>and predetermined balance and the judges<br>bring variability by fitting things into<br>different categories in individual<br>cases but I'm not sure we can continue<br>to rely on our swee of grounds to do the<br>sophisticated work we demand of<br>them and I'm resisting the urge looking<br>at my clock here uh for a deep dive here<br>into some hardcore methodological<br>questions and the appropriate design of<br>judicial review use meta<br>structure this was my PhD project at the<br>London School of Economics under the<br>guidance of Tom Paul and Martin Lan but<br>just forgive me I guess a brief rant for<br>the train<br>sporters I worry the evolution of<br>administrative law has unsettled the lay<br>of the land whether it's those the<br>complexities of Human Rights whether<br>it's the Constitutional shifting of<br>gears when t or or wangi or Tik are<br>implicated or when the Global and the<br>domestic legal systems come into<br>contact even structural changes of the<br>state and the EB and flow of the public<br>private divide un unsettle the usual<br>balance and modern day legal drafting<br>often overlooked complicates things too<br>with more sophisticated instructions<br>being included with parliament's<br>delegation of power the evolution of<br>public law now can I just pause here and<br>say<br>and just acknowledge my colleagues here<br>at viin or Mahi elsewhere and the Motu<br>who are experts in these as these<br>different aspects of Law and who have<br>enriched my<br>appreciation of them through<br>conversations and<br>scholarship it's through collaboration<br>that we've been able to take the<br>intellectual Journey forward and there's<br>many of those people in the this room I<br>acknowledge you and and others<br>elsewhere back to judicial review in<br>judicial review we all agree context<br>matters circumstances matters and<br>there's much there's much agreement at<br>least theoretically on the key factors<br>and context which are going to change<br>that<br>balance things like relative expertise<br>whether the primary decision maker or<br>supervisory court is more adapt at<br>solving the question and issue<br>institutional competence whether the<br>processes available to the primary<br>decision maker or supervisory Court are<br>more suitable for resolving the question<br>especially any forensic limitations<br>facing the court might be the magnitude<br>of the decision whether the effect of<br>the decision is significant including<br>the extent to which the decision<br>seriously implicates fundamental human<br>rights or other constitutional<br>norms and I say cognate accountability<br>whether other grievance mechanisms<br>provide adequate accountability<br>not but how should this context affect<br>supervisory method that's what we're<br>still debating I'm doubting our grounds<br>of review approach based around<br>pre-existing uh balances is responsive<br>enough but there are other<br>options and intensity of review approach<br>would bring these Dynamics to the<br>foreground by inviting courts to<br>explicitly work through those different<br>contextual factors to decide the depth<br>of scrutiny to be applied in any<br>particular<br>case and a contexture of your approach<br>moves completely away from Doctrine and<br>leaves the court to decide in the round<br>and in the light of the particular<br>circumstances whether something has gone<br>wrong of the nature and degree that just<br>uh justifies the intervention of the<br>court it's fair to say there are pros<br>and cons of each of these approaches<br>especially when judged against the rule<br>of<br>law but I worry a problem of language is<br>hindering our ability to shape an<br>approach which is fit for the challenges<br>of today and tomorrow our judicial<br>review discipline in New Zealand has so<br>far failed to negotiate a standardized<br>way of talking about this idea of<br>Relativity or that balance and I worry<br>we've got bulged down in debates about<br>language difference latitude variable<br>intensity height and scrutiny hardlock<br>margin of appreciation contextualism and<br>let's add from recent days comedy as<br>well the language of difference is<br>especially unloved here it seems despite<br>it being terminology which has strong<br>currency elsewhere in the common law<br>World worries perhaps about a sense of<br>judicial subservience and unfaithfulness<br>to the rule of law but worries that I<br>think i'mm misplaced especially in the<br>light of D David daen House's famous<br>characterization as difference as<br>respect and the Democratic virtue of<br>judicial humility I wonder if Tom<br>heckman's language of weight whether and<br>how much weight should be given to the<br>views of others here the primary<br>decision maker might be a more familiar<br>term and a pragmatic compromise that<br>better fits our linguistic<br>culture in any event it's method not<br>language that is my Prime concern but<br>watch the space as this question of<br>Relativity or margin of appreciation as<br>it was called is before The Supreme soon<br>and an appeal relating vac to<br>vaccination and Defense Force Readiness<br>requirements don't pop your popcorn just<br>yet let see what they do with that<br>that's enough wake up guys back there um<br>tricky methodological questions embedded<br>in the Java<br>supervision want to come back to that<br>question of what's judicial review got<br>to do with wise decisions and government<br>accountability I want to start first<br>with<br>accountability and we can redraw a<br>judicial review as a form of dialogical<br>accountability be Beyond its traditional<br>rule of law framing and in doing so<br>Center on ministers officials and public<br>bodies as actors and actors in<br>conversations designed to engender an<br>exact accountability so continuing BR<br>boen structure of actor Forum the other<br>key participant in that conversation is<br>the court the high court as the forum<br>for accountability supported in many<br>respects by an applicant who has<br>prompted the need for an account to be<br>rendered and<br>scrutinize ministers officials and<br>public bodies render account but<br>explicating what they did and explaining<br>why they say it is Justified and<br>justified in terms of good governance<br>expectations that I previously<br>outlined the supervising Court in<br>conjunction with an affected applicant<br>interrogates that account both directly<br>through contestation and indirectly<br>through the presentation of a counter<br>narrative and ultimately judgment is<br>exacted through ruling by the<br>supervising Court explaining whether the<br>profit explanation passes master<br>consequences in flow especially if the<br>appraisal was adverse remedies changing<br>legal settings may be issued in other<br>words the applicant may have the<br>interference or adverse treatment<br>remedied at least through a directive<br>that the decision maker must have<br>another guy making the<br>decision or Consequences may come home<br>to roost for the decision making<br>themselves again program loss of<br>reputation or even<br>office now this framing as dialogical<br>accountability is subtle but shifts the<br>emphasis back to the familiar idea of<br>rendering account in our culture of<br>justification at least against specific<br>expectations but what are judicial rev<br>wise decisions I just want to make some<br>observations about this we're seen first<br>the courts on judicial review don't ask<br>whether a decision is wise per se in<br>fact their admin admonished not<br>to at best the courts on judicial review<br>ensure there is a sound framework and<br>strong settings which encourage good<br>decision- making by the primary decision<br>maker and there's some real virtue in<br>that secondly and to put it another way<br>I guess judicial review is exibly more<br>concerned with bad decisions than good<br>judicial reviews negative and parasitic<br>floors operationalized in terms of the<br>grounds of review framed as bases of<br>judicial<br>intervention that said I think we can<br>acknowledge some hortatory or educative<br>role for the court but only if we<br>reinterpret and flip the grounds of<br>review into a positive statement about<br>Prudential decision making a tripartite<br>duty to act reasonably fairly in<br>accordance with law as Lord cook once<br>put<br>it that's a rough but perhaps too<br>abstract model of decision making and as<br>the justiciable flaw get more granular<br>and context becomes more complicated<br>there's a risk some things might get<br>lost in translation the inverse of a<br>grand of review may not squarely Express<br>a meaningful Duty for the decision<br>maker but this impr promising work on<br>this front it's pleasing to see the<br>crown Law's bureaucratic Bible for<br>officials drop the negative framing a<br>judge over your<br>shoulder in favor of to Ari people who<br>provide guidance and Direction and make<br>a fear fist of speaking directly to<br>decision<br>makers about what good decisions might<br>look like but there's a fair bit of<br>interpretive license being brought to<br>bear on that project and it's a tricky<br>one thirdly there's some um uncertainty<br>and doubt about how influential judicial<br>review actually does in practice sure<br>anecdotally we can all recall instances<br>where an adverse ruling on judicial<br>review has led to positive changes to<br>the underlying decision making practices<br>and I have in mind especially<br>immigration rulings on the relevance of<br>international law obligations others<br>here from government will have uh also<br>others too I'd love to hear more about<br>them but we haven't corroborated the<br>systemic cultural reaction to judicial<br>review and empirical<br>studies we lack the large and long dudal<br>empirical studies of England and<br>elsewhere about the impact of judicial<br>review on decision making in<br>government something for the future<br>perhaps<br>in terms of frequency we reckon and it's<br>probably it's a little bit more than a<br>reckon but we reckon there's about 22<br>250 judicial review decisions a a year<br>based on a pilot project undertaken by<br>Eddie Clark William Britain and me a few<br>years ago just pause there and compare<br>that to the magnitude of decision the<br>number of decisions made by the state<br>each and every day it's the smallest<br>democracy we can literally put all the<br>Judiciary decisions for a year into a<br>folder or two and then analyze the<br>numbers the people involved and the<br>trends but it's only a work in progress<br>at the moment and much more to be done<br>there so it's probably not unfair to say<br>that judicial review here remains<br>sporadic and peripheral as Stanley the<br>Smith described the position in England<br>in 1958 we suffer as Justice Hammond Pro<br>put it from problems of<br>supply judges don't get to appraise many<br>decisions and often whole fields of<br>decision-making avoid the judicial eye<br>we also tend to get ere excited and on<br>guilty of this over excited by current<br>developments where we probably make more<br>warranted and the parity of cases and<br>this is probably the fourth point also<br>speaks to one of the drawbacks of<br>judicial<br>review making an application to the high<br>court is a big deal formidable expensive<br>and reliant on Savvy lawyers and Out Of<br>Reach of many concerns about<br>accessibility and the privilege of some<br>speak loudly here how many parents can<br>afford to seek judicial review when<br>their kid gets suspended from the rowing<br>team for riding suitcases on the bar<br>baggage<br>carousel accessibility and<br>privilege finally there might be a<br>subtle shift of orientation place in<br>judicial review itself of late as judges<br>are positioning or repositioning<br>themselves more Sly in the good<br>governance project through the selection<br>of a particular form of Remedy and this<br>is a work in progress of the at the<br>moment because I think we're<br>increasingly seeing the courts Grant<br>declarations only declaratory relief<br>only pronouncing an answer on a legal<br>question or inviting or identifying a<br>rule of law defect without going on to<br>quash or modify the decision lying at<br>the heart of the challenge through their<br>coercive Powers we're seeing that a lot<br>intility cases along with many of the<br>judicial cases challenging pandemic<br>restrictions in doing so I think the<br>courts are speaking more directly to<br>decision makers about good decision<br>making then alleviating individual<br>Justice for Citizens through C of<br>Remedies albe it perhaps complainants<br>may still feel feel Vindicated by those<br>words on the page<br>so stepping back I think it's a<br>relatively MX scorecard for judicial<br>review and its relationship with wise<br>decision making perhaps with some<br>pressure that they do<br>more but let's put judicial review to<br>one side and let the green light shine a<br>bit<br>brighter because within our smallest<br>democracy there are a myriad of other<br>institutions and mechanisms that<br>encourage good decision- making and<br>provide a mechanism for students to<br>students mechanism citizens to raise<br>Grievances and seek accountability I ne<br>to to go to the high<br>court um I'm talking of folk like the<br>omds the auditor general regulations<br>Review Committee administrative<br>tribunals inquiries white tring tribunal<br>and other<br>Watchdogs I worry that these bodies<br>often sit in the shadow of judicial<br>review<br>we might think of these bodies as<br>comprising the Integrity branch of<br>government say that again we might think<br>of these bodies as comprising the<br>Integrity branch of government because<br>our traditional division of branches of<br>government to three legislative<br>executive Judiciary I think or I wonder<br>about whether it's still fit for purpose<br>and we can just recall how folk got tied<br>up in knots recently trying to explain<br>the constitutional place of the Whitey<br>TR for me the answer lies uh in<br>remapping our<br>institutions rather than trying to<br>shoehorn them into existing blunt<br>categories and some Scholars of<br>government law abroad are awake to this<br>blind spot and it's now become<br>fashionable to label these organizations<br>as part of the fourth branch of<br>government or guarantor institutions<br>that is those institutions charged with<br>ensuring Fidelity and a governance and<br>promoting a health<br>democracy for myself I prefer that<br>language of Integrity Branch it's been<br>um sometimes used in Australia as I<br>think it neatly expresses the function<br>Integrity of course if we drop a truly<br>functional classification it might be<br>the courts on judicial review fall<br>within that Integrity Branch too<br>separate from their work adjudicated<br>into part disputes between citizens but<br>that might be a tad too<br>radical there's also a case I think to<br>be made for for universities as<br>knowledge institutions to be recognized<br>in the Integrity Branch especially in<br>the light of our mandated critic and<br>conscience<br>role the value of the Integrity Branch<br>brand is it brings the heavy lifting of<br>these other institutions into the<br>daylight commensurate with the strength<br>and frequency of their contribution to<br>the good governance<br>project often these bodies only will<br>soft power the power to counsel<br>recommend encourage without coercive<br>Force but they're often masterful in how<br>they provide accountability and promote<br>good decision- making in ways that are<br>distinctive take for example the<br>UTS and in their maladministration uh<br>jurisdiction they're empowered to hear<br>complaints or investigate decisions made<br>by departments officials and many public<br>bodies their ultimate power is only<br>recommendatory they have no power to<br>quash decisions but they can recommend<br>decisions be retaken apologies be<br>assumed practices<br>changed more importantly the basis on<br>which they judge the justification of<br>the government of governmental decisions<br>differs from the courts on judicial<br>review sure they're charged with<br>ensuring the decisions are lawful<br>reasonable and made by a proper process<br>but they can call out decisions also if<br>they're based on factal error unlike on<br>judicial<br>review<br>perhaps based on leg isal practices that<br>are unjust or discriminatory or even if<br>they're wrong in the Al's opinion the<br>short point is the accountability<br>conversation here has a different Focus<br>or accent and the modality of those<br>conversations is different to more<br>inquisitorial more informal more<br>collaborative and that still all fits<br>with our framework of dialogical C<br>accountability can't put up the slide<br>but you remember the list actor we're<br>talking about Department and officials<br>forum is the onits the explanation<br>interrogation is based around a broader<br>set of maladministration<br>stands judgment is expressed in a form<br>of Correspondence or opinion and<br>consequences May flow not through coer<br>of power but through soft power and a<br>different Suite of advisory options just<br>last week the onboards recommended a<br>school apologized to a pupil for the<br>improper way it made the decision to<br>expel them or another s case for faing<br>to provide any reasons for a decision<br>again something that may not be<br>forthcoming with the court and we can<br>scale out that analysis across the<br>Integrity B Branch to foreground how the<br>nature of the accountability<br>conversations differ due to the<br>different standards and<br>benchmarks for example the auditor<br>generals focus on Effectiveness and<br>efficiency waste and prty and financial<br>prudence and a deep concern for systemic<br>Improvement<br>we to appreciate the different ways of<br>justification is rendered and<br>interrogated for example the way the way<br>Tangi tribunal explores putative treaty<br>uh breaches by inquiry processes based<br>in Tik and with a rich focus on history<br>and narrative and to recognize how<br>different consequences May flow from<br>judgment ex exacted by different<br>forums for example the way the gravitus<br>of the regulations Review Committee<br>underscores the force of its concerns<br>when expressed in collegial<br>correspondence with ministers and select<br>committies and that's not just an<br>explanatory or descriptive<br>exercise characterizing the<br>accountability conversation this way<br>also allows us to engage in more<br>systemic normative exercise assessing<br>the efficacy of each and their<br>Collective Effectiveness<br>too does the conversation with the Forum<br>in practice avoid the concentration<br>and misuse or abuse of power from a<br>legal or constitutional perspective does<br>it ensure the legitimacy of our<br>Governors through their responsiv<br>responsiveness to the<br>preferences of those they serve a<br>Democratic or political<br>perspective does it promote the<br>Effectiveness and efficiency of outcomes<br>through continuous feedback and<br>Improvement a learning perspective<br>different evaluative criteria needed for<br>different types of accountability<br>conversations and as mentioned also the<br>strength of the different forms of<br>accountability is not irrelevant to<br>judicial review as relativity in<br>judicial review is often responsive to<br>the force of non-judicial<br>accountability ultimately this is an<br>attempt to take us Beyond merely saying<br>more accountability is good<br>hoay the desire of the state and Arc of<br>administrative or has undoubtedly<br>ushered in more instances of<br>accountability more supervision more<br>judgment but in doing<br>so accountability has become atomized<br>leaving us feeling like there's less<br>paradox so as well as ensuring the<br>accountability conversations on a micro<br>level are providing value we also need<br>to be able to reaggregate those<br>conversations to hear the chorus of the<br>choir too and here I know the office of<br>the audit General especially is doing<br>some excellent reflective work in a<br>series of discussion paper on this<br>changing nature and expectations of<br>accountability but whatever way we look<br>at<br>it accountability in New Zealand and Al<br>New<br>Zealand accountability Al in New<br>Zealand is a complex system with many<br>moving<br>paths so just to conclude tonight I've<br>shared with you some different ways of<br>thinking about accountability of the<br>administrative State and how our legal<br>making in many respects the trajectory<br>of these remarks from the glit the<br>glitzy lights of judicial review red<br>lights perhaps to a towards a complex<br>network of accountability conversations<br>replicates the trajectory of my own<br>intellectual Discovery and importantly I<br>think a research agenda that sits ahead<br>thanks for sharing in that Journey with<br>you my name is Je<br>mclay I'm the acting dean of the law<br>faculty before I begin properly I just<br>want to acknowledge that well there are<br>many old faces in the<br>room well know to us there are many new<br>faces in the room um some of who might<br>fear may be the first time they've ever<br>been in a university law school um but I<br>just like to say that whether you're an<br>old friend or a new acquaintance we<br>welcome you to this very long expected<br>party um you're very welcome we're<br>insanely proud of our little law school<br>things more equally more fearly but we<br>are insanely proud for some of the<br>reasons you have already seen tonight<br>what I want to do<br>is first of all to say something about<br>the lecture and then to say something<br>about Dean two parts are really divided<br>into Professor Knight and Dean but<br>before I do that I particularly want to<br>welcome the KN<br>went it's really great to see you here I<br>particularly acknowledge Craig Dean's<br>father I acknowledge Mrs N issues um you<br>must be also insanely proud of your dean<br>as I'm sure your mother would have been<br>today I also just on behalf of my<br>colleagues want to acknowledge um Ellen<br>there are other academic spouses in the<br>room it is not an easy<br>gig academic life is not the Bel not the<br>the um what it bells and whistles sweet<br>roses that everybody thinks it is there<br>are people in this room who constantly<br>ripping us about that but it's hard work<br>and it's hard work supporting it so I<br>just want to acknowledge<br>you on all of our behalfs with thanks<br>or<br>so I just want to say some things about<br>professor's night lecture there are<br>three it seems to me purposes of in AAL<br>lectures even if they delivered after<br>someone's delivered several thousand<br>lectures probably in this room the first<br>is to show accomplishment the second is<br>to show that he actually has some<br>content he knows something and then to<br>promise what he's going to do in the<br>future now I'm not going to speak about<br>Dean's accomplishment because it's<br>self-evident and obvious from what<br>you've seen already I would like to<br>speak a lot about the content but at<br>7:30 last<br>night I dispar of receiving Dean's<br>lecture so the good colleague that I am<br>I did suggest a number of other lectures<br>that Dean could give<br>tonight and he has not delivered any of<br>them my particular favorite is why you<br>shouldn't trust the man who gives out<br>Donuts in his class another one was it's<br>not even a<br>Vibe always saying public FL is of vibe<br>it's not even whether it's even more at<br>all Dean hasn't given that lecture for<br>the particular reason that as much as my<br>private nor Soul would like those things<br>to be true it absolutely isn't for the<br>dean the reason the de has given us<br>tonight<br>soly one of the mysteries of New Zealand<br>I'm very glad there won't be comms or<br>questions from the audience this may um<br>TR Le the ey of one our distinguished<br>audience the great mystery of New<br>Zealand Public Law is not its Brokenness<br>is not what doesn't work and often The<br>Narrative of the last 60 or 70 years and<br>I say this by people who have been<br>principally responsible for fixing much<br>of that<br>Brokenness is that it remains broken the<br>central mystery of New Zealand Public<br>Law and I think of much of our country<br>is it actually works that on the whole<br>New Zealand is very well governed as<br>much as we might moan and as much we<br>might have complaints as much as we<br>might have Secondary School students<br>protesting on the the B of parliament<br>not in<br>classrooms it actually works in a way<br>that most countries would be deeply are<br>deeply envious of and that's the central<br>mystery that Dean's work has engaged<br>tonight why it works and how it works<br>what the role of Courts what the role of<br>decision makers what the<br>role of lawyers what the role of<br>much Woodman a the auditor general all<br>those other important his power and<br>that's the promise of Dean's lecture<br>that like all law that history and the<br>future New Zealand Public Law remains<br>Unwritten remains<br>Unwritten because a we just don't know<br>all the things we could there many there<br>are some people in this room whose work<br>has illuminated little bits of it large<br>bits of it there are people in this room<br>who have made large parts of New Zealand<br>Public LA but we still don't understand<br>enough people misunderstand the point of<br>these functions they're not celebration<br>they actually challenges but when you<br>become a professor you no longer have to<br>worry about pa1 and pa2<br>forms the promotion forms you're<br>responsible for what you want to do with<br>the rest of your career and Dean is<br>shown Us in this lecture tonight that<br>that's exactly what he's going to do<br>second part of my thanks is to Dean now<br>there are many of our colleagues in this<br>room who would do a much better job of<br>thanking de Knight and I will and I<br>apologize and you would do a much better<br>job than I would do now let the part<br>tell the whole I can only tell you some<br>things of this extraordinary<br>person I tried to figure out a word that<br>would summarized Dean the word teacher<br>you've heard from the vice Chancellor<br>about his Excellence wordss but that's<br>actually not de's important contribution<br>to teaching de cares in in a way that I<br>think very few of us can't and frankly I<br>and sometimes infuriating about his<br>teaching he really cares teaching public<br>law in New Zealand is not for the<br>fainthearted New Zealand has and will<br>always have a deeply contested Public<br>Law Constitution and constitutional<br>future that's the reality and deemed<br>teaching has been at the Forefront of<br>trying to figure out what we can say to<br>our students about this history and this<br>future scholar we could say scholar and<br>there's plenty of evidence for calling<br>him a scholar scholar is a great word<br>but actually it doesn't really describe<br>the richness of what de actually does<br>for many of the reasons the vice<br>Chancellor said scholar is one thing<br>Dean is a particular many of my colle<br>particular he's great attention to<br>detail great in the<br>footnotes but that's not Dean's only<br>contribution in what he does that's<br>inadequate as well I thought we could<br>describe him as a comrade because Dean<br>and I had been involved in many fights<br>sometimes against our loving institution<br>most we are the loyal opposition<br>that but that probably takes a degree of<br>radicalism I don't think Dean and I<br>really actually share the other word<br>starting to see that came to mind was<br>colleague and colleague is a really good<br>word and describes much of Dean but<br>colleague is the kind of person you me<br>at the the water caller once a day I<br>thought it's great they work in the same<br>building as I do but that's not actually<br>Dean the word that I ended up figuring<br>out is a word that's actually much<br>misused now in English um use just a lot<br>in front of it is the word friend<br>because Dean is most of all our friend<br>Dean is our friend who when you need to<br>have your thesis formatted on the day<br>it's due we'll do it for you all 100,000<br>words of it and Dina is also the friend<br>that spends all of that time then<br>instructing you about the wrong font<br>used and then tell you about how your<br>orphan controlled is somehow not working<br>I still don't know what orphan control<br>is Dean is the dean is the friend who<br>you can rant and Rave at about a certain<br>attempt to change a certain name<br>say to you oh actually I think that's<br>probably a good idea and then he's such<br>a friend that he figures out a way we<br>can agree by pointing out the<br>administrative<br>failings Dean is simply po the friend of<br>all of us at this law school and I'd<br>just like to acknowledge that you are<br>deeply loved by the people here we are<br>deeply honored to be here tonight to<br>celebrate not just your achievements but<br>also to challenge you for your future<br>work so I'd ask you to join me in</p></main><footer style="margin-top: 2rem; background: #0001; padding: 2rem; text-align: center;"><p>We
