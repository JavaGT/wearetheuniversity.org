The size and composition of these communities however are determined by both small-scale interactions of bacteria with each other and with their plant host that determine growth and survival, as well as large-scale features such as the proximity and abundance of other plant species that contribute immigrant inoculum. The maximum population size of epiphytic bacteria is limited by Carbon availability on the plant surface and differs among plant species due to the differing amounts of exudates. These Carbon sources and therefore sites of bacterial colonization on plants are spatially heterogeneous, with the majority of bacteria residing in localized sites harbouring relatively large, mixed species cellular aggregates. Cell density-dependent behaviours, often modulated by so-called quorum sensing signal molecules facilitate preferential survival of bacteria at such sites during stressful desiccation conditions. Bacteria also modify the local environment on plant surfaces by their production of hygroscopic biosurfactants that make liquid water more available. Epiphytic bacteria readily escape from the surface of plants and strongly influence the composition of airborne bacteria nearby. Such airborne bacteria are a primary source of immigrant bacteria for the establishment of epiphytic communities on plants that typically harbour few or no resident bacteria early in their development. Because of the differing amounts and types of surrounding vegetation present during the development of new tissues of a given plant species, the composition and size of epiphytic communities on crop species is very context-dependent and can be strongly influenced by management practices that influence the agro-ecological context of a given crop plant and can be strongly influenced by inoculation of immigration-limited crops by beneficial bacteria.<br><br>Biography: Steven Lindow is a plant pathologist and microbial ecologist whose research focuses upon understanding epiphytic bacteria interactions on plant surfaces, with an emphasis on studying ice nucleation and fruit russet.

many<br>microbiologists Steve really requires no<br>introduction I may embarrass him by<br>describing him as a granddaddy of<br>microbiome microbiome research of f<br>micob research um but he really is he he<br>has he did a a lot of foundational work<br>that influence our understanding of how<br>bacterial life adapt to and interact<br>with plants um through the surface to<br>the state um so Steve has been a faculty<br>member at UC Berkeley for a long long<br>time and he's also a member of the naal<br>Academy of Sciences I think that's<br>sufficient credential for you to take it<br>very very seriously thank<br>you thank<br>Jerry thanks for uh coming L um going to<br>try to cover kind of a broad perspective<br>on the very issues that relate to<br>microbial life on<br>leaves I know many of you would have<br>heard uh kind of microbiome research<br>certainly gut microbiomes in humans and<br>animals as big these days and even if<br>you've heard about plant microbiome it<br>usually been on the roots but today<br>we're going to talk about the<br>microbiology of the aerial parts of<br>plants because uh we think it's<br>that's Focus no no no it's the um you<br>have to turn off the laser M<br>okay uh the the folar microbiome is<br>probably almost as large as the<br>microbiome on Roots itself in that U you<br>see here a stata for size comparison and<br>all these little little objects all<br>across the surface here are all<br>bacterial cells mostly bacteria and a<br>few<br>fungi plants are all colonized with very<br>high numbers of microorganisms and they<br>vary from about 10,000 to about 100<br>million bacteria per square centimeter<br>when you add them up over the all of the<br>leaves and above G parts of the plants<br>in the world you get about avagadro's<br>number of bacteria probably larger than<br>that of the ocean uh but it's it's a<br>quite a large number and uh there very<br>important for various processes we'll<br>talk about that today and much of the<br>studies of of plant microbiome has been<br>coming from the study of plant pathogens<br>historically because we know that many<br>plant pathogenic bacteria live as<br>healthy microbes on plant surfaces so we<br>think of plant pathogens such as that<br>that causing bacterial Brown spab bean<br>and and fire blight disease of Apple<br>these exist for most of their life as a<br>as a Safi on the surface of healthy<br>plants in previous picture we showed<br>there's various large numbers of<br>bacteria most of them are not pathogens<br>but they have a variety of other traits<br>that we're going to talk about so most<br>of the work on on folar microbiology<br>come from the study of bacterial plant<br>pathogens and it was possible to predict<br>disease based on the population sizes of<br>these bacteria as basically reservoirs<br>of potential pathogens living on the<br>surface of plant as bacterial numbers<br>increase the probability of disease<br>would also then<br>increase but we also know though that<br>most of the bacteria on plants are not<br>plant pathogens and they have many other<br>traits that we want to be talking about<br>and most of those are in fact protective<br>of plants and most of these<br>non-pathogenic bacteria actually provide<br>uh considerable protection against plant<br>pathogens because when applied uh<br>preemptively they can prevent the growth<br>of pathogens and a classic example of<br>that would be that a fire BL disease of<br>pears and apples where the flower parts<br>of plants emerge into the world nearly<br>sterile and this is something we're<br>going to come back to several different<br>ways but the the female part of the<br>flower is basically sterile when it<br>emerges and then if the pathogen has<br>been brought to that open habitat by an<br>insect in this case carrying the<br>pathogen when Amal Ava that pathogen can<br>then grow to high numbers and diseases<br>and very very likely to happen but we<br>can know though that if various<br>non-pathogens arive in that habitat<br>first that largely prevents the growth<br>of the pathogen you see the little red<br>chops that those PA pathogen populations<br>remain quite low and disease can be<br>prevented so just a simple example then<br>of how many of the microbes on plants<br>are in fact protective just like gut<br>microbiomes are protective against human<br>pathogens but it has practical<br>implication because in fact there are a<br>variety of non-pathogenic bacteria<br>including pseudomonas fessin strain that<br>we found some years ago that when<br>applied preemptively onto plants in this<br>case almond trees can be allowing can<br>prevent them the growth of the the wrong<br>bacteria if you would and one of those<br>wrong bacteria that we're going to talk<br>a little bit about is that of ice<br>nucleating<br>bacteria that is we were all taught<br>incorrectly that water freezes at0<br>degrees cels but that is not true that<br>water has a potential to super cool to<br>remain in a liquid state to quite cold<br>temperatures in the absence of a<br>catalyst for that liquid to solid phase<br>transition and certain bacteria that are<br>quite common on plants like Pamona singi<br>are very efficient as acting as a<br>template for catalyzing ice formation we<br>call ICE nuclei in this case they can<br>cataliz ice when water cools only to<br>around minus one or minus two degrees<br>CSUS in the absence of these bacteria<br>the water will easily super cool down to<br>minus1 where it's in small droplets pure<br>water to around minus 40 degrees Before<br>ice will then form and this is important<br>then because plants many of our uh<br>agricultural plants are very susceptible<br>to freezing and it's not the cold<br>temperatures that causes Frost damage we<br>call it but in fact the formation of ice<br>in the tissues and it's the presence of<br>these bacteria on the plants that then<br>elicit then the frost damage so much of<br>my work then has been driven by an<br>understanding of the cial Ecology of<br>plants specifically related to ice<br>nucleating bacteria to avoid or to inhan<br>the super cooling ability of plants so<br>in this case you see that plants that<br>were growing in a sterile condition corn<br>and bean and so on without the bacteria<br>present can easily super cool to around<br>min-6 degrees ice nucleation is very<br>very unlikely at temperatures above that<br>temperature in the absence of these<br>bacteria and in fact then the freezing<br>temperature of the plant is driven then<br>by the populations of these bacteria so<br>if we have high numbers of bacteria like<br>a million cells per gram of tissue the<br>plants will super cool no more than to<br>around minus two degrees but as we<br>decrease the population size of bacteria<br>we see then that the temperature at<br>which the plants can super cool to<br>before they're likely to freeze<br>approaches that temperature of around<br>minus 6 where they're going to freeze no<br>matter what so plant ice formation in<br>Plants then is largely driven by the<br>presence of these bacteria and if you<br>were foolish enough to get up in the<br>middle of night and watch Plants freeze<br>like I've done here these super these<br>Citrus leaves in the upper left show<br>that darkened area near the center of<br>that top Leaf is where a bacterium has<br>triggered ice formation and Ice was<br>slowly spreading through and across that<br>leaf surface and that is what happens<br>thousands and thousands of times in a<br>plant canopy but again it seems to all<br>be driven by the presence of nucleating<br>bacteria and just like the presence of<br>non-pathogenic bacteria can preemptively<br>prevent the growth of uh pathogens non I<br>forming bacteria can also prevent the<br>growth of the ice nucleating bacteria so<br>in this case these plants were all put<br>in a freezer at minus5 without any<br>bacteria growing in the greenhouse<br>reasonably devoid a bacteria they<br>obviously super cooled and were not<br>damaged even at minus5 when we<br>inoculated only with a nucleating<br>bacteria they grew to high numbers and<br>it was doomed to freeze at a temperature<br>around minus two or so but in the middle<br>you see that those plants were first<br>inoculated with a non- nucleator and<br>then that the nucleating bacteria then<br>could not grow to high numbers and you<br>see most of the leaves escaped any<br>damaging<br>ice now the ice nucleation phenomenon<br>we'll talk a little bit more about is<br>really interesting and that it's it's<br>encoded by a single Gene in the<br>bacterium these are very large genes for<br>bacteria are in four to five kbn size<br>and they encode a very very highly<br>repetitive uh highly repetitive in in od<br>day repeating 48 amino acid sequen canly<br>repeated over and over and over some 20<br>to 50 times so they're very large<br>proteins which this basic unit this 48<br>amino acid block computer modeling shows<br>to form these little uh rectangular<br>structures that are on the surface of<br>the membrane which have hydrogen bonding<br>groups from Serene and Greening which<br>overlap almost exactly with that of an<br>Ice Crystal you see on the right so if<br>you look at this the hydrogen bonding<br>oxygen molecules for example on the Ice<br>Crystal it matches exactly their<br>hydrogen bonding pairs in the ice<br>protein so it basically acts as a<br>template upon which water is held into a<br>structure look like a Ice Crystal then<br>would allow it to grow<br>spontaneously so it's an interesting<br>biological phenomena but it hasn't<br>really important amplification so here<br>you can see artificial snow production<br>if you've ever gone skiing most ski<br>resorts make artificial snow anymore and<br>most ski resorts that make artificial<br>snow use the backr that I discovered to<br>catalyze ice formation you can buy it<br>it's called snowmax it's a Freez dried<br>gamma irradiated culture of camonos<br>florus singi mixed with the water<br>sprayed up in the air and the ice<br>freezes in the air as ice crystals<br>rather than falling as freezing rain if<br>you would to the ground so it became a<br>big project for which I get zero dollars<br>but the world is better place I guess<br>because we can make artificial<br>snow but it's also very important in a<br>greater schema of things in the global<br>precipitation process there's thought<br>that this is one of the major players in<br>rain and snow production naturally so<br>we'll be today talking a lot about the<br>growth of these bacteria on leaves and a<br>little later on I'm going to talk about<br>their escape from leaves to go up into<br>the sky the quite large number it's<br>about a million per square meter per<br>hour escape and go up into the sky and<br>um they would interact with<br>clouds the clouds we see are almost all<br>below freezing they're all super cool<br>water drops basically cold fog and that<br>fog just like it doesn't rain out of fog<br>it needs something to make those drops<br>big enough to fall out of the sky and<br>that requires ice formation in the<br>clouds and so we see then a bacterial<br>cell interact with one of these super<br>cool drops it will cause that to freeze<br>and by a couple of different processes<br>make those particles of ice get bigger<br>and bigger in the clouds and eventually<br>they fall from the clouds because<br>they're too large to be held up there if<br>it's cold all the way to the ground we<br>call it snow but most of the time it MTS<br>on the way down and we call it rain but<br>most of the rain in the temperate world<br>except for very close to the equator<br>starts as ice so we've had RAC recent<br>Rec L Rainer those were all triggered by<br>Ice formation and a large percentage of<br>that is thought to be these bacterial<br>cells because they're active at such<br>warm temperatures meteor dust and<br>certain minerals can also caliz ice but<br>much colder temperatures minus1 to<br>minus5 degrees these bacteria catalyze<br>ice at minus two so even warm clouds can<br>uh cause the formation of these<br>precipitation so it's s to be quite<br>important in the global like I say the<br>water cycle and that's LED people to<br>speculate about again one of the many<br>ways that people are screwing up the<br>world if you would in this case the<br>Sahel region in Northern Africa is<br>increasingly drier and drier over the<br>decades and the Sahel region uh used to<br>be kind of green there used to be<br>grasses and all but the humans bride in<br>goats and sheep and remove much of the<br>vegetation and that vegetation removal<br>there's a lot of speculation is allowing<br>that or preventing the development of is<br>nucleating particles to get into the air<br>in that part of the world can't prove it<br>it' be very difficult thing to prove but<br>it's thought that it might be<br>interrupting the the global<br>precipitation cycle because of that and<br>if you ever look out of a window<br>certainly if you're flying across the<br>United States the western part of the<br>states are are pretty Aid towards the<br>east it can BN more wet much of the<br>Central North America including most of<br>the United States used to be a large<br>grass covered prair it's now been<br>cultivated and now we grow corn and<br>soybeans as endless expanses of corn and<br>soybeans in the spring and early summer<br>it used to look like up the right upper<br>right it was covered with green grass<br>and you could imagine plumes of these<br>bacteria making your way into the sky<br>that clearly isn't happening anymore<br>because it's been denuded we see the<br>cultivated land for much of the Year<br>there' be many parts of the world many<br>parts of the Year there wouldn't be a<br>source of these bacteria so again is<br>this precipitation process going to be<br>altered by agriculture in many ways<br>again hard to prove but it's something<br>that people worry<br>about and again it might be effect on<br>climate and we talk about climate and<br>CO2 but there may be a direct effect of<br>these bacteria on the climate because of<br>the change in the radiation balance of<br>the earth so we see light coming from uh<br>the Sun much of it is reflected back<br>into the up into the Sky by<br>clouds and the role of these ice<br>nucleating bacteria I nucleating<br>particles in general is to make the<br>clouds brighter clouds that have large<br>numbers of small particles are brighter<br>they're more reflective of the sunlight<br>than clouds that have bigger<br>droplets and it also affects the way in<br>which the radiation can escape back into<br>space by making the high clouds the very<br>high cus clouds uh thinner so it might<br>be a very direct effect by making the<br>clouds darker than they normally would<br>be by reducing the numbers of these<br>Airborne particles so again the cloud<br>physicists I'll have a lot of interest<br>in what we're doing on Plants because of<br>this effect direct effect on the<br>radiation balance of the<br>earth so let's get back to Earth then on<br>the leaves where this is all<br>happening what is driving these<br>populations it seems to mostly be the<br>amount of potential carbon to be<br>consumed as food by these microbes and<br>this is basically on the menu of a plant<br>so the primary sugars glucose glucose<br>fructose are the major carbon sources on<br>most plants there are variety of others<br>lesser molecules certain organic acids<br>and amino acids but note the the units<br>there micrograms or so per Leaf it<br>doesn't sound like very much but if you<br>do the St geometry you can generate<br>around 10 to 100 million bacteria with<br>the 10 or so micrograms of carbon that<br>would be on a typical leaf and it turns<br>out that plant species vary in how much<br>of these nutrients that they have<br>certain plants like tomatoes and beans<br>and all have relatively high amounts of<br>carbon available and other things like<br>peas and corn and so on are much less<br>and it seem to be largely structured by<br>the cuticular surface the diffusion of<br>nutrients from inside the plant is<br>restricted on many plants so there's<br>much less available carbon to be<br>eaten but the important point I want to<br>point out is that the nutrients that are<br>available for consumption are not<br>uniformly distributed so we made a<br>variety of the biological sensors and<br>the first one I want to talk about is a<br>carbon sensor for fructose in this case<br>we take a fructose dependent promoter<br>and have it drive an unstable variant of<br>gfp so the cells harboring this<br>synthetic will only produce green<br>fluorescent protein if fructose is<br>around and they will because the protein<br>turns over quickly it will remain green<br>only if they see fructose at the instant<br>and when we grow up a biosensor like<br>that spray it with grow it up without<br>fructose around so there's not<br>fluorescent spray it on a plant come<br>back an hour or two later you'll see<br>that there little green cells all over<br>the surface of plant but you come back a<br>day later there's still cells all over<br>the plant but there are only a few areas<br>where the nutrients are apparently still<br>available to allow the production of the<br>green fluorescent protein which we<br>interpret then as being just a small<br>wisp of nutrients over most of the plant<br>and only a few areas where nutrients are<br>actually relatively abundant and might<br>continue to come to the plant we think<br>of this as kind of a nutritional aases<br>are relatively uncommon on the plant but<br>it also seems to be where most of the<br>action on a plant comes from because if<br>you do an Imaging like one of my<br>students who took thousands of images of<br>the plant surface you could see this<br>kind of sparse colonization of the<br>bacteria over most of this image and<br>then you see this large object in the<br>Middle where we see a microc colony<br>there might be a 100 thousand or so<br>bacteria in this Colony most of the rest<br>of the part of that image is largely<br>devoid of the bacteria and we think this<br>is driven by the fact that these<br>bacteria are being fed by that local<br>oases of nutrients where they're coming<br>out often at the base of triom and then<br>other places where we can't really be<br>sure why there are nutrients there but<br>presumably it was driving the potential<br>to grow large colonies of these<br>bacteria and these oases are relatively<br>uncommon if you look at uh large and<br>large numbers of these U images and look<br>at this at the number of Aggregates that<br>we see on the plant as a function of how<br>big they are you see we have literally<br>thousands and the ver Y axis here on the<br>top is on a log scale you have thousands<br>of times where you'll see a few cells<br>together in a given location and as the<br>number of a as the aggregate size gets<br>bigger and bigger you see there's only a<br>few few Aggregates that are so large so<br>we get an aggregate of 10 or 100,000<br>bacteria there may only be a couple on a<br>leaf but if you look at the bottom graph<br>where we're looking at the cumulative<br>portion of all the bacteria that are on<br>that leaf as a function again of<br>aggregate size here on the x-axis and<br>let's just use 100 cells as a cut off<br>you'll see that about half of all the<br>bacteria on the leaf are in these<br>relatively large Aggregates of 100 cells<br>are bigger and that these individual<br>cells that we see all over the leaf<br>don't add up to very many of the total<br>population and that reminds me an awful<br>lot of human colonization here's a<br>demographic of map of United States any<br>country is going to look similar so you<br>know we live over here in Berkeley and<br>if you were to fly from there over to<br>New York you're going to fly over a lot<br>of farms and desert where there's hardly<br>anything when looking down on the plan<br>there very few people there but then you<br>eventually get to Chicago and you get a<br>huge City all of a<br>sudden California is the most urbanized<br>state in the United States if you've<br>ever visited we got huge deserts and<br>forests and mountains but most<br>California live in cities and that seems<br>to be the case with the microbes there<br>are reasons why we live in the city<br>because there's jobs there and water<br>systems and all that have been<br>engineered to allow us to live in these<br>places and I'm going to talk about<br>microbial engineering of the leaf in<br>just a second because the microbes live<br>in these few places where they do live<br>because there were already resources<br>there where I'll talk about how they<br>actually are modifying the leaf to live<br>where they do<br>live but before we do that let's think<br>again about these microbial cities it<br>seemed to be very important to be in a<br>microbial City not only is that going to<br>be a good place to grow up but it's also<br>a good place to stay alive and so what<br>we're seeing here is the fraction of<br>living cells as a function of the size<br>of aggregate that they're found in let's<br>just use 100 cells as a as a cut off<br>again you see all those cells that were<br>in these relatively small Aggregates on<br>T 50 cells they're mostly dead after<br>they've been exposed here the yellow<br>line for wet and dry conditions for<br>seven days and we think the drying is<br>particularly detrimental to the survival<br>of the bacteria on the leaf and they're<br>not surviving when they're when they're<br>part of these individual cells very<br>small individual cells it's only when<br>they become part of these large<br>Aggregates are they actually alive so<br>these images that you saw earlier of the<br>bacteria spread around on the leaf most<br>of them were probably dead under the<br>kind of typical envir enal conditions<br>that they have to uh survive out in the<br>real<br>world but it also has other practical<br>implications about how does a leaf<br>become colonized we'll talk about<br>immigration of an oculum to the leaf<br>here in a little bit but it turns out<br>that especially if you're not a<br>particularly fit organism for growing on<br>a leaf like certain human pathogens like<br>salmonella that we don't want colonizing<br>our tissues they can in fact survive<br>quite well if they land amongst one of<br>these large Aggregates on the leaf so in<br>this case we had some differentially<br>color marked strains of salmonella and<br>when it landed then on a empty part of<br>the leaf without any other bacteria<br>around and the y axis here is again the<br>percentage of the cells of salmonella<br>that were actually dead after 24 hours<br>after we had<br>inoculated and you see contrast that<br>with the dark green bar where it landed<br>amongst some other<br>cells it was largely alive it landed in<br>this big pile of other microbes and that<br>seemed to allow it to then survive so<br>the successful immigration of a microb<br>to a leaf is also driven by the<br>pre-existing communities the microbes<br>that were already there are<br>protected so this s seemed to be a<br>better image of what a life on a leaf<br>looks like so here's one of those<br>Aggregates this is a scanning electron<br>micrograph and you see it's kind covered<br>with this polysaccharide or<br>slime uh that you could easily imagine<br>being quite protective on a sunny day<br>the sun is coming down that slime is<br>probably acting as somewhat of a<br>sunscreen it's probably binding water<br>that that is a group that was growing<br>there because of the resources allowed<br>to develop such a large population and<br>to produce enough of that protective<br>slime so again that is basically what we<br>think is where most of the microbes on<br>the leaf are actually<br>at but a microbiologist would look at<br>that and they might also say to<br>themselves warm sensing that they may be<br>density dependent behaviors which has<br>become quite a Hot Topic in microbiology<br>and that we know that microbes although<br>their individual cells have a program<br>changes in the way they behave when they<br>are part of a group than when they are<br>more solitary that's what we call Quorum<br>sensing in this case it's driven by<br>their ability to produce and perceive<br>these small signal molecules one of the<br>most common ones and the most studied is<br>that of these nasil homerian lapon that<br>are produced at very small amounts<br>constitutively by the bacteria when<br>they're alone in the world that molecule<br>can diffuse away from the producing cell<br>as you see up here on the upper left and<br>it doesn't see the signal molecule<br>anymore because it's diffused away so it<br>knows it's solitary and so it has a<br>program Behavior that's appropriate for<br>that kind of setting but when it become<br>part of a large group and all of its<br>neighbors are also producing the same<br>signal molecule then it changes in its<br>regulation of different traits and human<br>and animal pathogens many regulate their<br>production of virulence traits by the<br>reception of these signal molecules<br>pamono singi is opposite it actually<br>suppresses many of its veillance traits<br>when it's part of one of these large<br>groups in this case camonos singi a very<br>common Leaf colonizer When We Make<br>mutants that are blocked in its ability<br>to produce and perceive the signal it<br>actually becomes more virulent and<br>probably because it also is more uh<br>motile here a wild type strain did not<br>want to leave that Colony but when it<br>was unable to perceive the signal<br>molecule you see it's now swimming away<br>from where the colony was originally<br>inoculated so the signaling process<br>seemed to be very prominent in many<br>species like<br>ponus but it also then um raises this<br>question about whether the behavior of a<br>microbe is really under its own control<br>how much of it is going to be kind of<br>happen stance or or controlled by things<br>outside of its own control in this case<br>these bacteria have other neighbors on a<br>plant those other neighbors we now know<br>can produce the same signal molecule as<br>in this case plant pathogen sudono singi<br>we found that about 12% of the bacteria<br>on a plant make a signal molecule of P<br>sudon theingi the plant pathogen can<br>also proceede and interestingly we find<br>about 8% of them can produce chemicals<br>that interfere with the signaling of the<br>pathogen to its own signal<br>molecule so again we think of it earlier<br>but ponus thinks it wants to become<br>varant so it produces or doesn't produce<br>a signal molecule but what if it has<br>neighbors around which has other ideas<br>can they then influence the behavior of<br>ponus and obviously the answer is yes or<br>I would be talking about it this case we<br>have neighbors that produce the same<br>signal molecule of camonos sering this<br>case it's a strain of arnia that makes a<br>large amount of the signal molecule<br>maybe a hundred times more than the<br>pathogen itself itself normally would<br>make when we inoculated pamon singi<br>alone on the left hand bar and we let it<br>grow on the plant for a couple of days<br>and look at how many lesions had it made<br>it made in this case 35 lesions when we<br>had mixed it with a winia and inoculated<br>to plant you see the number of lesions<br>went we down but it might have been due<br>to competition and other things that<br>were responsible so to account for<br>whether it was simply comp competition<br>versus this communication change we<br>blocked the ability of the UIA to<br>produce a signal by adding a gen<br>enabling the production of an enzyme<br>that simply destroyed the signal and<br>there you see then that the amount of<br>disease is very similar to that of the<br>pathogen by itself that it was a<br>presence of this extra signal molecule<br>which stops sudam monos singy from<br>moving around on a leaf prevented its<br>ability to get into the leaf where it<br>could cause disease that was responsible<br>for disease and the opposite was also<br>true that when we had strains like this<br>strain 114 which interfered sudam onos<br>sing's ability to make<br>signal uh now compared to the pathogen<br>alone we see like two or three times<br>more likelihood of disease because the<br>cells are more active they are not<br>suppressed by the presence of the signal<br>they're moving around and apparently<br>finding their way into the plant where<br>they would then cause disease so again<br>conceptual now what are the traits that<br>are needed for living on a leaf bacteria<br>that live on Plants seem to be rather<br>unique many soil organisms do not<br>survive at all well on leaf and so we<br>were very interested and what are the<br>traits that seem to be particularly<br>important among these bacteria that grow<br>on the surface of<br>plants so we were fortunate that one of<br>the earliest strains sequenced was ponos<br>singi by the joint genome Institute and<br>so we hadn't in hand then the ability to<br>start doing transcriptomics of this<br>bacterium early on and we are very<br>interested in what are the traits that<br>were expressed when it was growing in<br>culture compared to when it was growing<br>on the plants so we have now basically a<br>a histogram of the patterns of gene<br>expression that we saw when the bacteria<br>were on the surface when they were on<br>the inside of the plant or when we grew<br>them in a mineral medium that had salt<br>and peroxide and low iron and various<br>conditions that we thought might mimic<br>what the leaf surface look like if you<br>just look at this tree showing the basic<br>pattern of gene expression not too<br>surprisingly we see there's a different<br>pattern of the genes when the bacteria<br>we removed from the plant before doing<br>transcriptomic as compared to on the<br>inside of the plant<br>but quite concerningly you see that the<br>pattern of gene expression that we saw<br>in any of these other culture media were<br>very very different than the patterns we<br>saw when they were in or on a plant so<br>for a long long time people have been<br>sitting these back in culture but in<br>fact they had very very different<br>behaviors when they're you know in plant<br>in or on the plant probably something we<br>should have guessed but it's very<br>disconcerting that in fact a lot of what<br>we learned about in culture probably<br>wasn't telling us very much about what<br>was actually happening in and on the<br>plant but just a couple of snapshots<br>about what are the kind of traits that<br>seem to be particularly highly expressed<br>when we were on the surface of the plant<br>we'd wash the cells off and done<br>transcripton mix one of the things that<br>really stuck out was that all the genes<br>that were involved in Feller motility<br>and chemot taxis were upregulated you<br>see in the red bars and another trait<br>that we're going to talk a little bit<br>more about later on would be uh<br>tryptophane biosynthesis it wanted to<br>make a lot of tryptophane when it was on<br>a leaf and we'll come back to that in a<br>minute and conversely when you got the<br>bacterial cells out of the inside of the<br>plant and done the<br>transcriptomics what are the traits that<br>seem to be particularly important there<br>were a lot of them involved in plant<br>toxins things that would damage plants<br>and this is something we knew already<br>quite a bit about but both cells on the<br>surface in the red but especially inside<br>the plant in the green these several<br>different toxins were all induced okay<br>but what was really quite interesting<br>would be this other group of these<br>compatible solutes these are molecules<br>like NN Proline tros these are molecules<br>to allow the cells to tolerate low water<br>conditions and we would expect them to<br>be upregulated on the cells that were on<br>the surface of the plant because that<br>dries up frequently and you see that in<br>the red that yes cells often leave<br>surface we trying to survive<br>justification conditions but look at the<br>green bars which are the cells that were<br>on the inside of the plant they were<br>even more strongly<br>upregulated suggesting that the inside<br>of the plant that we would have all<br>considered to be kind of moist and juicy<br>was actually very dry and it is because<br>you think about how plants<br>work gases have to diffuse into the<br>intercellular spaces to supply the<br>carbon dioxide for photosynthesis and<br>all so the in the cells lining the<br>inside of a plant are actually mostly<br>separated by air and the cells that were<br>on the plant or inside the plant had to<br>tolerate that very dry condition and one<br>other trait that we're going to talk a<br>little bit about in a little in a second<br>is seringa factant one of the many<br>biosurfactants that are produced by the<br>bacteria they were prod upregulated both<br>in and on the plant so yes there were<br>very different traits that were<br>upregulated when you were on the inside<br>of the plant and when you were on the<br>surface we might<br>expect but the traits that I want to<br>follow up on that would be a couple of<br>these related to Syringa and ction with<br>these<br>biosurfactants and also tryptophane why<br>was it trying to make so much<br>tryptophane when it was on the leaf<br>surface let's talk with tryptophane<br>first tryptophane is the immediate<br>precursor for one of the most important<br>plant hormones indol acetic acids so if<br>you think back to your<br>biology oxin bio indol acetic acid is<br>one of the major hor plant hormones that<br>have evolved in plant<br>development in Plants as well as in<br>bacteria these are all ultimately<br>derived from tryptophane as the<br>immediate<br>precursor it turns out that virtually<br>all bacteria that you see on a plant<br>produce indol atic acid very few don't<br>make indolacetic acid and it seemed to<br>be very important for them to have made<br>endol atic acid and it also suggests<br>that many of the traits that we see the<br>normal traits of plants like flower<br>excision and fruit excision or the<br>development of epidermal cells here make<br>what we call fruit ret is regulated and<br>produced because of the oxin that these<br>bacteria are making so the fruit ret an<br>important agricultural trait where the<br>cells of the fruit die prematurely as a<br>fruit matures uh is very big economic<br>problem especially in California where<br>grows a lot of fruit for Fresh Market<br>compared to a fruit where we did not<br>have the oxin producing bacteria present<br>uh it's again thought to be something<br>that was originally d by the plant and<br>weather but it's actually driven by the<br>microbes that are living on the plant<br>that are making the<br>hormone and again it seemed to be very<br>important for those bacteria that make<br>the hormone because when we made mutants<br>of the bacteria that were blocked in<br>that pathway that converts tryptophane<br>to endol atic acid and we applied an<br>equal mixture of the wild type and an<br>oxin deficient strain onto the plant<br>looked at how that ratio changed after<br>we inoculated on the plant you see that<br>basically there was a substantial<br>increase in the ratio of The Oxen<br>producing to The nonproducing Strain<br>suggesting that The Oxen really was<br>important even under short periods of<br>time for his ability to do what it<br>needed to do on the<br>plant and based on that argument earlier<br>that it was the amount of carbon on a<br>plant that was driving how many of these<br>microbes were present why not we naively<br>thought that it was simply oxin was<br>being produced by the bacterium to sound<br>somehow cause more nutrients to come to<br>the<br>surface but it seemed like it's probably<br>a little more complicated than that<br>because we we had other biological<br>sensors that we developed this case we<br>made a biological sensor for sucrose we<br>took a sucrose responsive promoter in<br>this case drive a promoterless ice<br>nucleation Gene and then ask how many<br>ice nuclei could be made in the presence<br>of the sucrose the thinking being then<br>that if we compareed that normal plant<br>in the purple with a plant where we had<br>extra oxen being applied that there<br>ought to be more sucrose available<br>because the oxin was going to somehow<br>make nutrients like sucus more available<br>but it was the opposite we did it over<br>and over we always got the wrong answer<br>this case we saw less soup gross present<br>on the plant in the presence of The Oxen<br>compared to the quote normal plant so<br>less sucrose uh was available in the<br>presence of oxin but the opposite was<br>true for fructose we already described<br>the fructose recorder this case we see<br>in the green compared to the blue the<br>presence of oxen actually made fructose<br>much more<br>available lower sucrose more<br>fructose okay what is this trying to<br>tell us but we try to think about again<br>what is life going to be like on this<br>Leaf because go back to those 10<br>micrograms of sugar that we talked about<br>on a whole leaf and on a leaf you know<br>it gets wet from rain or Dew you<br>dissolve 10 micrograms of sugar on in<br>that solution it's G to have to be<br>really<br>diluted it appears then that in fact<br>these microbes are really good at eating<br>very dilute carbon<br>sources but more importantly they have<br>active uptake mechanisms for these<br>different sugars in this case fructose<br>is taken up by a different mechanism<br>than that of<br>sucrose and more importantly those<br>uptake mechanisms for the<br>monosaccharides like fructose are much<br>more efficient than the than the uptake<br>mechanisms of sucrose so we tried<br>growing the bacteria at these very very<br>low concentrations we would expect on a<br>leaf and that units are important so<br>we're looking at a fraction of a<br>milligram per liter of carbon which is<br>what we think is the the concentration<br>that they actually see nothing like the<br>10,000 times more that we would<br>typically GR than in the laboratory and<br>one more importantly what you can see is<br>0.02 uh milligrams per liter really<br>really low concentrations and it took<br>about 50 or 100 times more<br>concentrations of sucrose for them to<br>also start responding to the sucr to so<br>it looks like they really can't grow at<br>the expense of suos on the plant because<br>it's never high enough concentration and<br>what they're actually doing is<br>converting in some way or another<br>sucrose to the monosaccharides fructose<br>and<br>glucose so it appears then that what is<br>happening is that this oxin that the<br>bacteria are making are acting on the<br>plant to in induce invertases the<br>enzymes in the plant that convert to<br>sucrose we remember is the dominant<br>carbon Source that's available in or on<br>the plant uh to the glucose and the<br>fructose the bacteria can actually eat<br>at those low concentrations in the plant<br>that the plant is<br>providing now one last trait I want to<br>mention that is quickly these<br>biosurfactants<br>and when you'll see DW drops on a plant<br>or raindrops on a plant the leaves of<br>most plants are relatively hydrophobic<br>they got a hydrophobic cuticle the<br>cuticle is there to uh prevent the<br>nutrients from escaping and also<br>preventing water from going out of the<br>plant when it's dry but they're usually<br>pretty waxy surfaces and it's not<br>uncommon to see you know drops of water<br>on the<br>surface much of the surface would<br>actually be not colonized not<br>colonizable because there not going to<br>be any water present CL Le so we thought<br>naively yes many bacteria have the<br>ability to produce detergent like<br>molecules kind of amphipathic molecules<br>with a hydrophilic end and these long<br>asil chain chains which act like<br>detergents and sudam sying is one such<br>byic sying aaum that's known as we<br>thought well it's going to allow the<br>spreading of water on the leaf to allow<br>it to be wetted better but it turns out<br>that it actually sering of facton the<br>detergent has two other properties that<br>seem to make a lot more importance to<br>the bacterium on the plant and one is to<br>change the nature of the cuticle on<br>which the bacterium is<br>sitting so we could test that by peeling<br>off tiny bits of the cuticle away a very<br>thin layer on the surface of the platin<br>we peel it off put it on top of a<br>chamber where we had some trated water<br>and watch the tridium diffuse across<br>that cuticle into an upper chamber and<br>that's what we're seeing on this graph<br>basically the accumulation of of<br>tridium so an intact uh cuticle uh a<br>slow diffusion of trium but then when we<br>applied some sering aaon you see the<br>rate at which the trium is now moving<br>across that cuticle went up<br>dramatically so it seems like it's naely<br>dissolving that cuticle it's somehow<br>modifying the nature of the cuticle to<br>make it more porous to polar molecules<br>like water or maybe um some of these<br>polar sugars and so on so that is one of<br>the traits that many bacteria have the<br>ability to produce these detergent like<br>molecule and the other trait that I<br>wasn't really aware of until we started<br>working with sing aaon is that many of<br>these type of molecules are very<br>hydroscopic they bind water in this case<br>the sying effecta made by suding combine<br>two to five times its mass in<br>water so again bacteria are by Nature<br>aquatic organism here we're having them<br>grow on a frequently dry leaf<br>so having the ability to somehow hold on<br>to water might be quite important so we<br>wanted to know what's the presence of<br>this detergent leg molecule that could<br>bind water making the bacteria more<br>hydrated or less water<br>stressed and we could again develop and<br>use biosensors to tell have the bacteria<br>tell us how water stressed was the<br>bacteria so in this case we used a<br>promoter for Proline biosythesis Proline<br>is one of the<br>common uh compatible soles<br>perine makes water more accessible to<br>the inside of cells so we're gonna link<br>that again to a gfp reporter and as the<br>cells are going to see water stress are<br>going to try to make Proline to deal<br>with the water stress and they're going<br>to turn green The Greener they are the<br>more water stressed they will be and so<br>we put that bior reporter gene into<br>ponus<br>and compared how green the wild type<br>strain became compared to a mutant that<br>we made that was blocked in the<br>production of the<br>bioact what we're looking at is the<br>distribution of the greenness of the<br>large number of cells each of these<br>little dots is the how green a<br>particular cell was so here's a fraction<br>of cells as a function of how green they<br>became basically we're seeing that the<br>wild type cells never got particularly<br>green not at anywhere near green as did<br>our sering aact and mutant suggesting<br>that they did not have the ability to<br>hold on to the water and when we put<br>them on a plant and exposed it to a<br>typical environment they were more water<br>stressed so it did seem like our simple<br>model was probably correct that the<br>bacteria making the sering aaon as you<br>see the balls and chains here theath<br>molecules that surround the bacteria<br>were now binding water and cells were<br>essentially sitting in little puddles of<br>water maybe it's a little simplistic<br>maybe it's a little film but basically<br>they were making the bacteria much less<br>exposed to the dry environment that they<br>otherwise could<br>tolerate and it was quite true though<br>that compared to the uh survival in the<br>field the wild pipe does much much<br>better in a field condition where put<br>these recombinant strains compared to<br>the mutant which is on the bottom so it<br>looks like then was very much a local<br>environment where the cells were making<br>themselves more<br>wet now I to finish up talking a little<br>bit about<br>U the bigger question about how do<br>things get onto the plant in the first<br>place and remember we tried to convince<br>you that certainly young tissues like<br>flowers or young leaves as they first<br>emerged into the world are largely<br>uncolonized so where is the oculum<br>coming from to grow on those plants<br>and if you could see in this apple<br>orchard picture it would seem likely<br>that there would be a lot more bacteria<br>available on the surface of these<br>grasses than would ever have been<br>present on these young flowers flowers<br>are virtually sterile and this case and<br>California the flower the grasses have<br>been growing all winter they have a<br>million or more cells on a even blade of<br>grass so there's a huge number of<br>bacteria there compared to the flowers<br>and could there be movement of those<br>microbes up onto the leaves we're<br>thinking it's Airborne but it might also<br>be contributed by insects that might fly<br>between the two but studying first the<br>Airborne aspect of this we did a simple<br>experiment Berkeley is in the San<br>Francisco baraya so we Face the Pacific<br>Ocean we're on the east side of the<br>Pacific Ocean the winds almost always<br>blow from the West so the winds are<br>coming off the ocean they haven't seen<br>any plant material since it left Asia<br>you know 3,000 miles away so we could<br>take pristine air as it was coming off<br>the ocean and we took vacuum pumps down<br>to the edge of the water and we could<br>sample a cubic meter of air onto<br>filters and uh we also had other vacuum<br>pumps that would bring another sample<br>simultaneously in this case about 30<br>meters Inland so there were grasses and<br>things that right down to the edge of<br>the<br>water so we would then quantify how many<br>microbes in that cubic meter compared to<br>that cubic meter the upwind and downwind<br>air if you and it was much more dramatic<br>than I would have expected and when you<br>compared the numbers of microbes that<br>you saw<br>above uh the upwind air had about oh<br>well the downwind air had about six<br>times more bacteria in it even after<br>they had flowed only you know about<br>three times the size of this room it had<br>already been populated by airbone back<br>shff presumably from the<br>plants and we could do analysis of the<br>communities that we had captured on our<br>filters by DNA analysis of the signature<br>genes and you know here's a list of the<br>kind of taxa that we found most abundant<br>in the in those air samples and we're<br>going to compare the upwind air the<br>communities on the plants over which<br>they had flown and then the downwind air<br>that 30 m Inland and this look at a<br>couple of the more typical bacteria that<br>we see on plants like pantoya very<br>common bacteria on many plants was very<br>abundant on our plants as well and then<br>it was also quite abundant in the<br>downwind air basically was not present<br>in the upnd air and you could pick out<br>some of your other favorite bacteria but<br>it basically showed us that the air even<br>after a relatively short distance had<br>become much more plant-like in the<br>so that led us then to think then that<br>the communities that are on the on the<br>plants if it's being inoculated by<br>airborne bacteria might be strongly<br>dependent on the communities of plants<br>nearby I won't show you the data that<br>seem to suggest that soil is not a<br>particularly good habitat to get the<br>bacteria upon on mind it's probably<br>other plants they unique traits that<br>plant associ bacteria<br>have and so again if you have a<br>community if you got a context like this<br>where you got different kind of plant<br>species around it's probably going to be<br>a very different process depending on<br>who your neighbors are is they're going<br>to be the sources of the Airborne<br>inoculum and I want to finish up talking<br>about the way we're again messing with<br>the world in agriculture because we're<br>growing corn and whatever and these<br>large Fields where there aren't any<br>other green plants in the<br>vicinity but the first question then is<br>how context dependent is the communities<br>on the<br>plants are if as a given plant species<br>are you the driver is selection<br>happening because of the characteristics<br>of you as a plant host or are you going<br>to be simply sampling from many other<br>potential colonizers are there a variety<br>of microbes that you could Harbor and<br>you're kind of at the whims of who your<br>neighbors are supplying that an<br>AET so my brother is a farmer in Oregon<br>in North West part of the United States<br>and he raises in large Fields uh three<br>major crops one is uh Fescue it's a<br>common crap grass for pastures and Lawns<br>and things he raises crimson clover<br>really pretty crop and wheat and so what<br>I did I used Fescue as like a a sentinel<br>plant we grew fescue in the greenhouse<br>so that it had any other bacteria on it<br>and we transplanted them out into the<br>middle of his field so here you can see<br>some uses to see in this picture where<br>the red clover has got some Fescue<br>plants that I put in the middle of it we<br>came back couple three weeks later and<br>we harvested the Fescue plant to see<br>what was the<br>communities and if it was driven by<br>selection from the plant we would have<br>expected that the communities on the<br>Fescue would have been very similar no<br>matter what setting we' put them in but<br>in fact it was very different and uh I<br>don't remember which which is which the<br>yellow was the wheat and the red was<br>Clover or whatever you'll see in this uh<br>principal component analysis plot that<br>the communities were very different same<br>these fields aren't that big there was<br>in about a kilometer one or so but it<br>was their local neighbor that was seem<br>to be driving what the communities were<br>there was a substitutable community on<br>the plant and it was driven by the<br>nature of the in the local plant<br>community so this a lot of implications<br>in terms of Agriculture I'm interested<br>in a lot of diseases and Frost and<br>agriculturally relevant microbiology if<br>you would and frost especially is a big<br>issue in California we raise a lot of<br>citrus Naval oranges and tangerines and<br>other things they're subject to freezing<br>in the winter time but the orange grows<br>uh are growing in different kind of<br>context in this case you see a Grobe<br>that was grown next to this field of uh<br>grass many of the orchards are large and<br>they grown only in large blocks where<br>their neighbors all were other citrus<br>trees and they usually remove all the<br>vegetation in these Orchards with<br>herbicides to prevent competition for<br>water and things so here we would have<br>had a setting where we knew that there<br>was probably a thousand times maybe 100<br>thousand times more bacteria per unit<br>area of those grasses than ever would<br>have been found on the citrus trees<br>especially following the summer our<br>summers in California there's not a drop<br>of rain for about five months it get<br>about 43 degrees celsus terrible place<br>to grow your an epide but then winter<br>comes and it gets cool and rain and the<br>communities we then think happen from<br>these communities coming off of these<br>other plants that were earned by so what<br>we looked at then was was the<br>communities on these citrus trees very<br>different in this setting compared to<br>this l<br>sitting and so again we we looked at<br>trans six where we had obvious sources<br>of inoculum like in this case this is<br>the edge of the the Citrus Grove and<br>there were other grasses another thing<br>here and we were in a look different<br>distances into the Grove to see whether<br>the communities on the edge of the Grove<br>where it's very close to the grasses and<br>then move into the large Groves so here<br>we collected not only airborne bacteria<br>not with vacuum pump but by just<br>watching them deposit onto Petri dishes<br>for an hour and you could see that there<br>was a very dramatic difference in the<br>microbiology of the air if you would in<br>this case we're looking at the<br>deposition these are how many back<br>culturable bacteria we deposited in an<br>hour on a PE dish and we had this on<br>several different Orchards with<br>different settings the green ones where<br>we had surrounded these grasses nearby<br>and the red one is where it was<br>surrounded only with other Citrus where<br>there wasn't any real obvious Source if<br>you would and you'll see two things the<br>red ones are almost all much lower in<br>the rates of deposition of the bacteria<br>than was the on sorted where there were<br>grasses<br>nearby and you see the green one<br>especially see it slopes downward so<br>here is the right on the edge of the<br>Grove next to the grass and as you move<br>into the Grove away from the grass you<br>see that the rate of deposition<br>decreased and decreased and eventually<br>got to this low level that you saw when<br>they were in an area where there wasn't<br>an obvious<br>source that was Associated then not only<br>with the rates of deposition but the<br>actual numbers that we saw on the trees<br>so the green ones again are the<br>communities log cells per gram again we<br>see the green ones show a slope downward<br>there's about 10 times fewer bacteria<br>per unit area on the interior of the<br>Grove then on the edge and again the<br>green ones were for the most part all<br>higher than any of the red ones where<br>there wasn't an obvious source of<br>inoculum<br>nearby and fortunate for us and and<br>unfortunate for The Growers who were<br>collaborating with us we had freezing<br>events that happen in these<br>Groves we had already measured the super<br>cooling temperature we could put these<br>leaves in uh tubes of water and cool<br>them to see when they would start to<br>freeze that's what we call the super<br>cooling temperature and you could see<br>that those uh leaves that were collected<br>uh from trees that were adjacent to<br>Citrus had a much higher ability to<br>super cool compared to those on the<br>bottom one where they were just jent to<br>grass and again we see the strong<br>gradient there was much less super<br>cooling near the grasses and much more<br>Super cooling as you moved into the<br>Grove so 25 trees in was about a 100<br>meters or so and the frost that we<br>eventually saw showed the same pattern<br>we actually had damage to the fruit that<br>were hanging on the tree<br>more damage near the edge of the Grove<br>where there was the bacteria present and<br>probably the ones that didn't have the<br>grasses present there was much less<br>freezing<br>Events maybe a little more<br>understandable would be some of similar<br>work that we've done with grapes grapes<br>are a big crop in California obviously<br>and the highest value of grapes are<br>growing in the northern part of the<br>state where freezing is quite common in<br>the<br>springtime and<br>based on what we had studied with Citrus<br>and the airborne bacteria at the beach<br>we were very worried about what the<br>effect of these agricultural practices<br>like the growing of cover crops between<br>the roads so this area where the high<br>value grapes are growing is kind of<br>hilly erosion is a problem so they often<br>would want to have vegetation there<br>during the winter to kind of stabilize<br>the soil and improve soil health and so<br>on but we thought it would be a major<br>risk to the grapes if that was in fact<br>providing a source of an Ulin would move<br>up onto the new newly developing grape<br>choots so he set up some very large<br>plots replicated blocks each block was<br>about three or four hectares in size<br>because we needed to get far enough away<br>from other sources of binocul to show<br>that so here is where two of these<br>replicated blocks came together here<br>where we had removed the vegetation<br>early in the winter with herbicides and<br>another where we had allowed the<br>vegetation to grow and then we collected<br>the tissues from the grape fines and<br>looked at in this case super cooling<br>capabilities and the hot colors the<br>yellow and the red are where we had<br>removed the vegetation and the color<br>color the blue and the gray is where the<br>vegetation had been allowed to be there<br>and the y- axis is showing again the<br>super cooling point the more Super<br>cooling reflects the lower numbers of<br>ice bacteria and you can see a quite a<br>substantial effect about 2 to 3 degrees<br>cus colder before those plants were<br>likely to have Frozen had frosts<br>occurred because of the lack of the<br>inoculum of in this case ice nucleating<br>bacteria that presumably were coming<br>from the<br>grass so just want to finish up and and<br>talking<br>about agriculture I came from an<br>agricultural<br>background I think our fundamental work<br>that been talking about has important<br>implications in terms of growing plants<br>correctly and again this is the way most<br>of the developed World grows plants<br>anymore in huge Fields without any weeds<br>uh and the real question is where's the<br>inoculum going to come from on these<br>large Fields because remember we talking<br>about you know the grass is right next<br>to the grave but in a large field if<br>you're in the Middle where is the Anum<br>going to come from so we did some<br>experiments to see what how much of an<br>edge effect is there will you see a<br>different pattern of colonization of the<br>plants in this case some little corn<br>plants next to<br>some stuff okay and so we did a a large<br>experiment we're right in the middle of<br>it I'll show you the preliminary data<br>this is a field in<br>Minnesota this is my post<br>Kyle and we were fortunate we had these<br>gigantic Fields so they were you're only<br>seeing just one edge of this huge field<br>that was about 100 hectares in size but<br>they bordered on nice green trees and<br>grasses and things on the edges and what<br>we were doing then is to collect these<br>developing corn leaves uh near the edge<br>of the field and then moving further and<br>further away from the vegetation to see<br>what we would<br>find so this so far is what I can show<br>you uh let's just look at the corn as a<br>good example so we were looking only<br>when the plants were relatively young<br>because we thought that would be the<br>most important time to look at the<br>colonization process before everything<br>be turned green and they shared an OCT<br>among<br>themselves and this is now based on DNA<br>analysis the total numbers of uh of<br>bacteria that were found on our Edge<br>plants those trees and everything we saw<br>indeed they do have like 10 to 50 times<br>more bacteria on them early in the<br>spring but more importantly look at the<br>gradient as we move into the field so we<br>got about 100 meters into the field you<br>could see that the total numbers of<br>bacteria on these young corn plants<br>after a week or so after they emerge in<br>the soil are about 10 to 20 times lower<br>than they were near the edge and we've<br>also done Community analysis we find out<br>who's on those plants in addition to how<br>many were on the plants and we see a<br>very different pattern at the back area<br>on the edge of the field look a lot like<br>the surrounding plants and the ones on<br>the inside look substantially<br>different so it would seem then that<br>there really is a fairly large kind of<br>biogeographical feature to the<br>colonization especially early in the<br>development of these tissues and I would<br>just summarize everything we talked<br>about<br>today is that the colonization of PR<br>seem to involve very different processes<br>that happened at different scales so<br>early on we talked about all these genes<br>and surfactants and what have you we<br>think that's all happening at very very<br>small scale probably within micrometers<br>these bacteria are tiny relative to the<br>large leaves that they're sitting on and<br>that they can only influence local areas<br>of the leaf but they do need to alter<br>the leaf surface to make waterm<br>available or causing sucros to be<br>converted into fructose and so on we<br>think that's all happening at very small<br>scales but at Big scales<br>this whole immigration immigration<br>process which is important in getting<br>organisms on the plant is also really<br>important so I think we have to kind of<br>think of it as a very complex process<br>that's actually going to be<br>happening my final scale point then is<br>that again humans are messing with the<br>world it's pretty clear climate change<br>is happening we talk about carbon<br>dioxide but think back to the you know<br>climate brightening of the clouds and<br>everything<br>but agriculture especially we think that<br>there<br>are problems in the way we are growing<br>plants that might make them much more<br>susceptible to diseases by eliminating<br>what would be a normal community that<br>would happen on these plants especially<br>if we have pathogens that might merge<br>from say the the debris from a previous<br>crop here onto a young developing plant<br>it might be arriving on a plant that's<br>under colonized and is going to be more<br>susceptible to Invasion by the<br>pathogen so how can we avoid that if<br>we're not going to grow them in huge<br>Fields maybe we should inoculate those<br>plants with beneficial organisms and if<br>you follow the agricultural microbiology<br>field this is really really big these<br>days all the corn and soybeans in the<br>United States anymore are inoculated<br>with different microbes usually to<br>stimulate root growth and what have you<br>but we think might also include microbes<br>that might also restore more of a<br>natural community on the leaf<br>surface I'll just stop there and you<br>know while I'm having fun in New Zealand<br>and all these are the people working on<br>the hard part in the lab Despina did a<br>lot of the aerobiology Aden worked on<br>our<br>biosurfactants and uh Monica did our<br>biosurfactant work gene expression so<br>much great we have time for questions um<br>teaching is finished so I don't think<br>anybody so the primary limitation is<br>PO how much time do we have I'm go<br>you're go okay great any questions in<br>Zoom Mar first<br>sorry all can we go over the<br>super not I it but um with theing<br>bacteria and citrus chip the ones that<br>had the um that were closest to the<br>grass did they have the the citrus trees<br>have more isting bacteria on them than<br>closer I'm having a hard time here I can<br>summarize<br>hello hi um I just had a little bit of<br>trouble understanding the super cooling<br>effect in the ice nucleating bacteria if<br>you could just clarify so with the<br>Citrus Orchard the um citrus trees<br>closest to the grasses had more ice<br>nucleating bacteria on them so what<br>effect did that have on Frost damage was<br>that a beneficial effect or a<br>detrimental effect I didn't quite<br>understand that<br>the most of the Agricultural plants that<br>we grow are sensitive to freezing so in<br>this case the grasses would be<br>considered a risk factor for this case<br>oranges or flowers and you name it so<br>that there's a few points for which ice<br>nucleation is beneficial but it's kind<br>of a unique most of our plants are very<br>intolerant of ice formation and those<br>bacteria the nucleators that would move<br>are going to be real much of a risk okay<br>so in the Citrus Orchard in the grape um<br>example studies you showed us it was<br>actually a detrimental effect to have a<br>cover crop or other species growing<br>around the desirable fruit same thing I<br>the being very beneficial for soil or<br>there's a tradeoff in terms of increased<br>Frost risk and all okay<br>so thought you were gonna say<br>oh if I a great<br>grower I worry about my soil Health<br>right the the car crops are going to be<br>very important for that and erosion and<br>all those other things but there may be<br>a major risk for the frost<br>damage I didn't talk about it that we've<br>been looking to see are there plant<br>species that could be poor colonizers<br>poor host for the ice nle bacteria that<br>you might intentionally grow in between<br>your rows and the answer seem to be kind<br>of yes there are some PLS vary in how<br>many of these nucleators they'll support<br>and so there are certain Lums and things<br>we found that might be a good compromise<br>in terms of allowing the beneficial<br>growth of your covercraft but without<br>the risk of the immigration of the<br>interesting really enjoyed that thank<br>you very much I have a question about um<br>bacterial with you looked at bacterial<br>distributions within the leaf whether<br>there were regions within the leaf that<br>had these Aggregates of<br>bacteria they have Aggregates of<br>bacteria like like on the<br>surface<br>one that kind of local geography on the<br>leaf it's places you'd most likely find<br>them the most common place is at the<br>base of cular<br>triom certain plants have these these<br>little hairs and as the base of the<br>hairs they have the ability to secrete<br>chemicals on Leaf often for defense<br>against insects and what have you but<br>they seem to exude nutrients as part of<br>that and so those those are the most<br>likely place to find them the other plac<br>is along veins and that might be partly<br>because of the Escape of nutrients from<br>the FL that's exposed most prominently<br>at the veins but partly a physical<br>phenomenon because you get What's called<br>the coffee ring effect that also occurs<br>on Plants whereas the water evaporates<br>from Leaf it<br>evaporates last along the veins and<br>things and it kind of draws any bacteria<br>that might be just suspended in the<br>liquid to those last evaporating places<br>so you get this coping effect fact<br>you're physically moved around by the<br>water as it<br>evaporates the reason I ask about inside<br>the leaf is that there's a current<br>debate about the um relative humidity if<br>you like the saturation Point Within<br>leaves inside and there's some models<br>that suggest there's recondensation of<br>water so there's wet patches or wet<br>locations within the leaf and I was just<br>wondering whether bacteria are found<br>there or<br>not<br>of quite they're almost always much less<br>abundant than they're on the surface<br>and some bacteria passively get into the<br>leaf and seems to just accumulate there<br>but in relatively low numbers if they're<br>pathogens then they can actively change<br>the nature of the leaf and they can grow<br>to huge numbers but assuming we're not<br>talking about a pathogen the numbers<br>that are inside of the leaf are 1% or<br>something what we might see on the<br>surface um<br>yeah whe whether those are particular<br>places where there are wet patches or<br>what have you not much has been done on<br>that<br>so I have one question of my own so in<br>in doing this work have you um<br>identified morphological or<br>physiological traits of plants that are<br>predictive of their ability to Harbor<br>ice nucleating<br>bacteria the number<br>most harder waxier smoth surfes<br>CIT like<br>be have kind of waxy Leaf you know and<br>you see them wet water makes little<br>drops on top of PE whereas other PL it<br>kind of a film it's<br>that Serv how thi the wax cuticle is and<br>the structure of waxes waxes are make<br>little PL like look at the magnification<br>of our Leaf surface<br>it's looks C like a like a snake or<br>something the wax crystals<br>a rough versus a smooth surface the<br>smother those lay down on the<br>surface the harder it is for water to<br>escap great thank you any more<br>questions<br>more um I'm sure you're familiar with<br>the movement to EST establish like uh<br>Prairie patches around you know areas of<br>Farmland that aren't in use and how do<br>you think it would be best to balance<br>the desire to restore the function of<br>the Prairie and potentially the cloud<br>formation with the potential damage to<br>the crops nearby with more ice<br>nucleating<br>bacteria entomology has been a lot of<br>interest to in<br>these these<br>strips England not England especially<br>almost always see like head and things<br>around you<br>and those have always of as really a<br>because they good reservoirs for<br>beneficial insects and all we think that<br>that might also be a source of these<br>bacteria but the big ISS we're trying to<br>get out with some of<br>these what would be the size needed to<br>be a good<br>source so My worry is that if we have to<br>dedicate a large fraction of the area to<br>something that's unpr Ive it ever be<br>practical to have enough of these<br>you that's why the that we're trying to<br>get at in the field or what we're<br>getting at is<br>how how how far effect can you expect<br>from these sources of immigrant and and<br>if it's a very short Source then you can<br>imagine it take a lot of these<br>preparations to make it work so don't<br>know the answer but I'm worried there<br>will<br>be<br>thanks thank you yeah thanks Steve great<br>presentation really enjoyed it you<br>covered really a lot of ground in that<br>presentation and when to try to put<br>things together the fact that you<br>demonstrated that the ability of a<br>pathogen to cause disease is partly<br>influenced by its<br>neighbors and I guess the reciprocal<br>it's true the the the the ability of a<br>biological control agents to prevent<br>disease is also controlled by its<br>neighbor and that the bacteria that end<br>up on the plant are completely dependent<br>of where that plant<br>grows it it seems to me it brings into<br>question how much you can<br>extrapolate experiments you do in one in<br>one setting to another in particular I<br>guess the the the the extreme example<br>would be can we even think of<br>extrapolating what we do in The Glass<br>all but as you were talking I was<br>thinking a lot of what we're trying to<br>do practically is the kind of things<br>that you've done and I've done as well<br>in terms of inoculating plants if if we<br>can't get enough sources of natural<br>dispersal into our plants and flowers to<br>get the<br>protection can we artificially inoculate<br>them to achieve the same goal and I<br>think in the ultimately that's kind of<br>why I was finishing up with these<br>probiotics that a lot of the big<br>companies are now selling microbes to<br>for specific inoculation on the plants<br>and that may be our only practical<br>solution is to artificially create<br>colonized plants and especially we could<br>figure out how to make it work well from<br>Simply seed inocular ation for an annual<br>plant because we can't think about<br>spraying the vast acreages of corn or<br>something with these microbes but<br>they're already being inoculated with<br>inoculation onto seeds if there were<br>particular strains that could grow well<br>on the seeds leaning as it develop in<br>the seed that might achieve some level<br>of the normal<br>Community but that's going to be a lot<br>of work<br>too any more questions well if not I'd<br>like to thank Steve for having this<br>wonderful</p></main><footer style="margin-top: 2rem; background: #0001; padding: 2rem; text-align: center;"><p>We Are The University</p><ul style="list-style-type: none;
