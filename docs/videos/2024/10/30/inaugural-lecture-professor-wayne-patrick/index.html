Life without them is inconceivable. Some of the reactions that are essential for life would take millions, if not billions, of years if there were no enzymes. Being such powerful catalysts, enzymes have also become essential tools for biotechnology. Professor Patrick is obsessed with enzymes. His research group addresses fundamental questions about their structures, functions and evolution. His team also uses their findings to engineer enzymes with improved properties. In this lecture, Professor Patrick discusses the insights that come at the interface of biochemistry and evolution, and he argues that enzymes should become New Zealand’s ultimate high-value export.</p><h2>Transcript</h2><p style="opacity: 0.9; font-size: 0.8em">Transcripts may be automatically generated and may not be 100% accurate.</p><p>my name is briany James I'm the Provost<br>here atang aaka Victoria University of<br>Wellington and it is my very great<br>pleasure to offer a warm welcome to all<br>of you here this evening a warm welcome<br>to family and friends to distinguished<br>guests to colleagues both staff and<br>students and to our wider<br>Community welcome to the inaugural<br>lecture of Wayne Patrick professor of<br>biochemistry in the faculty of science<br>inaugural lectures are a fascinating<br>little Quirk of the traditions of<br>universities when we ask somebody who's<br>probably given hundreds if not thousands<br>of lectures during their career to give<br>their inaugural lecture because this is<br>us welcoming our newest Professor to our<br>ranks and inviting them to give their<br>first lecture to the public as a<br>professor having achieved what is<br>actually the highest level of academic<br>rank that you can so congratulations are<br>always in order but also it's a welcome<br>time for us to come together and<br>celebrate the breadth of experience that<br>we see on our academics so it's my very<br>great pleasure this evening to introduce<br>our newest<br>Professor now the tradition of these<br>introductions is there should be some uh<br>little familial anecdotes some jokes um<br>personal touches but Wayne's been fairly<br>unforthcoming um in providing such<br>material um and I was going to ask his<br>boss Professor Nikki Nelson but um she<br>says she's got plenty of dirt she's<br>saving that for the vote of thanks so<br>you got that to look forward to at the<br>end so I will limit myself more to a<br>little review of uh of of Wayne's career<br>today Patrick uh Professor Patrick<br>gained his BSC from the University of<br>atago and then won a prince of Wales<br>scholarship to do his PhD at Cambridge<br>following that he went to the US and<br>spent four formative years as a<br>post-doctoral fellow at Emory University<br>in Atlanta where he learned to Love<br>American football and the Atlanta<br>Falcons I must say not the winningest<br>team of the<br>NFL after eight years overseas uh Wayne<br>returned to New Zealand he bounced<br>around some of the Lesser New Zealand<br>universities uh before he joined us here<br>at Vic in 2018<br>and and here he leads an<br>interdisciplinary research group that<br>addresses fundamental questions about<br>enzyme Evolution and why life is the way<br>it is so just the small<br>questions the group also used their<br>fundamental insights to engineer enzymes<br>for applications such as biosensors and<br>better RNA vaccines so actually we've<br>all got something to be thankful for<br>there Wayne modestly attributes his<br>success to the 60 plus students and<br>staff from 15 different countries who<br>have trained in his group this includes<br>13 PhD students eight Master's students<br>16 honors students and no fewer than<br>nine post-doctoral<br>fellows he's supported the work of this<br>group and himself by bringing in what is<br>frankly an eye-watering array of<br>external research<br>income including a ruford discovery<br>Fellowship for Marsden grants and three<br>MB smart ideas grants now as an ex<br>Deputy Vice Chancellor research and<br>naturally nosy person I see that array<br>of externally funded research and I<br>think well what's he done with it let's<br>have a quick look at his Publications so<br>you do the academic equivalent of Google<br>stalking and you jump on scopus and I<br>must say I was relatively surprised to<br>find only 13 Journal articles that had<br>only been cited 128 times<br>turns out Patrick Wayne is a grad<br>student in Albuquerque um whereas Wayne<br>Patrick has a rather more impressive uh<br>array of 64 articles that have been<br>cited well over 3,000 times and whil<br>it's doing all of that his intellectual<br>curiosity and creativity means that he's<br>also been the lead inventor on five<br>patent families and alongside a former<br>PhD student he's currently working with<br>Wellington univ Ventures to spin out a<br>company based on biosensor<br>technology now obviously it's not just<br>us here at Vic who have recognized his<br>contributions at the interface of<br>fundamental biochemistry and applied<br>biotechnology as he's also been uh<br>recognized with several prestigious<br>Awards including the research Excellence<br>award from the New Zealand Society for<br>biochemistry and molecular biology and<br>he's previously been named New Zealand's<br>young biotechnologist of the<br>year now Wayne is not just an<br>impassioned researcher he has taught<br>extensively at all levels and I<br>commented as I was on the way here<br>obviously a lot of students here this<br>evening and that is a incredible<br>Accolade for an inaugural lecture so<br>thank you to the students for<br>coming universities are places where<br>knowledge is created and shared and<br>Wayne shares his love for the power of<br>biochemistry to answer the big important<br>biological questions by finding creative<br>ways to connect his students to<br>molecules that they can't see he aims to<br>empower all of our students with<br>transferable skills for their future<br>careers an example being his molecular<br>modeling assignment where he employs<br>Cutting Edge 3D model modeling software<br>and virtual reality so that students can<br>appreciate and experience protein<br>structure and biomolecular<br>interactions as you're likely realizing<br>if you didn't already know way wants to<br>push forward all aspects of his<br>discipline and I think a great example<br>of this was when he was president of the<br>New Zealand Society for biochemistry<br>molecular biology when he wrote and<br>introduced the society's Equity policy<br>making it among the first of New<br>Zealand's life science societies to<br>forly commit to diversity and inclusion<br>across all<br>operations similarly here at the<br>University he doesn't hesitate in taking<br>on leadership roles he spent three years<br>years as the Director of the center for<br>biodiscovery he's been Deputy head of<br>the school of biological sciences twice<br>I believe and now he's stepped into the<br>role of associate Dean research for the<br>faculty of Science and he is as<br>passionate a champion for the research<br>of others in his discipline as he has<br>always been for his own discipline<br>throughout his<br>career if like me you're a nosy Google<br>stalker and you jump onto his website<br>for the for his research group you'll<br>find pictures of all of them out there<br>tramping and playing mini golf uh so<br>it's a pretty it's a pretty clear thing<br>that Wayne's enjoyment of the outdoors<br>and trail running and tramping is having<br>as much influence on his friends and<br>colleagues as his<br>researches and it is this enjoyment and<br>love for his work that we are looking<br>forward to hearing more about this<br>evening as Wayne takes us through his<br>inaugural lecture enzymes I have known<br>and loved he will try to explain his<br>decades long obsession with enzymes and<br>he will introduce the insights from his<br>research group that come at the<br>interface of biochemistry and evolution<br>and he will argue that enzymes should<br>become New Zealand's ultimate high value<br>export it's my great pleasure to<br>Patrick thanks Bry I'm kind of reminded<br>of that Toby Keith song A as one good as<br>I once was nevertheless let's get<br>started it's quite a day to uh to give<br>this an augural lecture I woke up this<br>morning of course thinking about having<br>to uh give a public lecture to a diverse<br>audience about protein structure uh<br>protein function protein Evolution<br>protein biotechnology then I logged on<br>to the news websites and found that the<br>Nobel Prize for chemistry is just been<br>awarded in those disciplines today uh so<br>uh so I hastily changed a couple of<br>slides I will say though that whilst the<br>ending you know now involves the new uh<br>new flavor um my sleepless night last<br>night wasn't because I got the midnight<br>call from Sweden so spoiler<br>alert um instead I thought I would uh<br>I'd start this lecture<br>um here with my uh official PhD<br>graduation photo as good a place as any<br>I think uh to start the story if you<br>have watched really carefully I've<br>already stripped off some layers uh<br>partly because I thought it would be<br>stuffy in here uh but mostly because<br>that's like the nice ceremonial eye<br>candy but actually this is the this is<br>the the Gown that I wore on this on this<br>day in this photo and so struck me that<br>it's kind of a bit battered now after<br>lots of formal halls and lots of<br>Cambridge colleges it's kind of old and<br>tired and so it seemed seemed<br>appropriate that I should roll it out<br>for uh for an occasion like this uh at<br>this point in my career the other thing<br>that I had in my suitcase the other<br>artifact that um that left Cambridge<br>with me was this um PhD thesis there on<br>the right large some might say<br>self-indulgent though I like to point<br>out that was only single-sided printing<br>in those<br>days um and it contained a huge amount<br>of of data and information about two<br>enzymes alanine reses and phosphor<br>riosol and th isomerase Emily's here she<br>already knows where the story's going<br>Parker there two emilies in that line of<br>sight um putting this uh lecture<br>Together made me realize that really was<br>the start of a of a long and complicated<br>love affair with these protein molecules<br>called enzymes so I started by by<br>looking at my own CV Google stalking<br>myself rnie uh and trying to compile the<br>list of all the enzymes that that me and<br>my group of worked on uh since since my<br>PhD I know this is kind of already the<br>part where the biochemists in the<br>audience are looking at this list and<br>thinking oh yeah that one yeah yeah<br>that's a good one one of my favorites of<br>course you did of course you<br>did but but everyone else who I<br>appreciate as most of you are like come<br>on now come on slide three and you've<br>lost me already uh and not only that but<br>these are clearly not real<br>words and so we all know there's no such<br>thing as a s<br>hydras uh but my goal for the next 40<br>minutes minutes or so is to try and<br>convince you that in spite of their<br>ridiculous names uh these enzy molecules<br>are are fascinating uh they are worthy<br>of study they Inspire quite fundamental<br>thought-provoking questions about the<br>nature of all life on Earth because as<br>we're going to talk about every cell and<br>every organism is packed full of them uh<br>and not only that but in the last part<br>talk about this idea that knowing more<br>about enzymes really presents this<br>interesting and unique econom<br>opportunity for New Zealand so<br>dovetailing into some of the biotech<br>stuff that we've been doing over over my<br>previously so I do think no matter<br>whether you're a biochemist or not<br>you've probably run into enzymes in your<br>day-to-day life so for example you may<br>have something like this in your laundry<br>uh obviously this is pel's best powder<br>because it's the one that's got enzymes<br>in<br>it as it says on the ingredient list<br>they have some role in breaking down and<br>removing stains so already hinting at<br>some of the magical powers the<br>mind-blowing functions that these<br>molecules can<br>have they're way more interesting and<br>cooler than just being able to break<br>down and remove the stains in your dirty<br>clothes though um as I've alluded to<br>every cell in every organism including<br>every cell in your body right now is<br>busy doing hundreds and hundreds of<br>chemical reactions molecules are being<br>made and broken constantly in front of<br>my very eyes um and the only reason<br>those reactions are happening on a time<br>scale that's remotely compatible with<br>Biology with Life as we know it is<br>because they're being accelerated by<br>enzymes so enzymes are really the<br>proteins inside cells that catalyze<br>reactions take some really tricky<br>chemistry and bring it into a time scale<br>appropriate for life to give you an<br>example um one of the ones I teach about<br>in BIO 1111 you know there's an<br>essential chemical reaction for making<br>the building blocks of RNA one of the<br>key molecules in ourselves with no<br>enzyme if we just waited for that<br>reaction to happen it would happen about<br>once every 74 million years or so and so<br>life's not going to start that way right<br>there needs to be something that<br>accelerates those reactions in order for<br>all of the functions the molecular<br>functions that constitute Life as we<br>know it that's why the functions of<br>enzymes have fascinated me for uh for my<br>entire<br>career those functions are<br>determined uh by their beautiful and<br>intricate structures and so hopefully if<br>Tiff and Matilda and Jordan are here<br>they'll recognize these figures and be<br>intimately familiar with these<br>particular structures um they they're<br>made these enzyme molecules or proteins<br>they're made as chains of amino acids<br>there's a 20l alphabet of the different<br>types of amino acid and that determines<br>how those chains fold into these as I<br>say these beautiful and intricate<br>structures whether they curl into those<br>helical structures form sheets or Loops<br>or strands uh in three-dimensional space<br>like the the picture on the left there<br>um you see on all the lumps and bumps<br>the negatively charged Parts positively<br>charged Parts the parts that like water<br>the parts that want to be away from<br>water and that determines their<br>function and really at the heart of an<br>enzyme structure and therefore its<br>function is that intricate fold places<br>just a small number of the amino acids<br>in exactly the right place that that<br>enzyme will recognize one or two<br>substrate molecules one or two chemicals<br>inside the cell and put them in just the<br>right environment for a for a reaction<br>to happen at a speed that's consistent<br>with biological processes all of this of<br>course is happening on a scale that's<br>much too small to see with the naked eye<br>much smaller than the white powder in<br>here um the nanometer scale and so as<br>you can tell by the time I'd got to the<br>end of my PhD I'd really drunk the co a<br>about how uh you know the awesome power<br>of enzymes I had had a look at these<br>three biochemistry textbooks that were<br>all in my office uh last week um and<br>they've all got statements along similar<br>lines about the characteristic features<br>that Define enzymes the one here I've<br>pasted at the bottom is from the only<br>one of these that has an ebook uh<br>Garrett and Grisham that says<br>characteristic features of enzymes are<br>catalytic power specificity and<br>regulation you know they can do one job<br>really really well they catalyze one<br>reaction with speed and precision and<br>they do it exactly when the cell needs<br>it when the cell doesn't need it anymore<br>that enzyme gets turned<br>off the whole rest of the network<br>functions until it's needed<br>again I was all into that by the end of<br>my PhD but there was a question that<br>puzzled me uh and that was The<br>evolutionary one so if all of these<br>enzymes are such powerful and specific<br>catalysts that do one thing and one<br>thing only where the new ones come from<br>and new enzymes born that way they born<br>sort of as these beautiful uh kind of<br>the Pinnacle of of protein<br>Evolution seems unlikely we knew even<br>back in my PhD days that new enzymes<br>could emerge in biology really quickly<br>because you know we've spent last<br>century or more introducing human-made<br>chemicals into the environment so we<br>knew already even in the '90s that if<br>you introduce a human-made pesticide or<br>insecticide uh into the environment<br>maybe in a decade or so the soil<br>bacteria will have figured out how to<br>eat that for breakfast they would have<br>evolved enzymes that could metabolize<br>that chemical similarly and perhaps even<br>more frighteningly I suppose um the<br>phenomenon of anti microbial resistance<br>now here we've got um a whole bunch of<br>different antibiotics on these little<br>white filter paper discs on a lawn of<br>bacteria you can see that in some cases<br>the antibiotic works and the bacteria<br>can't grow up to the edge of the disc<br>with the antibiotic but in the ones down<br>the bottom you know the bacteria don't<br>care at all that there's an antibiotic<br>in that filter paper disc and the reason<br>they don't carear about it at all is<br>that they've evolved enzymes to break<br>down those antibiotics so enzyme<br>Evolution can be rapid and have these<br>you know transformative and important<br>effects uh but at the end of my PhD<br>there was really unanswered questions<br>about where what was the evolutionary<br>process that gave rise to this and how<br>could it happen uh so quickly in in<br>biological<br>systems I was really<br>fortunate to uh to spend this time at<br>Emory University like Brian he mentioned<br>working with uh with a very um key<br>Mentor in my career called airo matsura<br>and so he had he was also<br>puzzled and fascinated by this problem<br>and here's here's one of the first in<br>his own postdoctural time um to discover<br>and characterize a so-called promiscuous<br>enzyme so he found an enzyme that uh had<br>evolved to do its job in a Cell um but<br>he figured out that if it was given a<br>different substrate a different sugar<br>instead of the one that normally nibbles<br>um just a little bit low activity on the<br>side it could break down that other<br>sugar as well so it had this kind of<br>Moonlighting you know it would slip out<br>and have this secondary<br>function and that made sense in the<br>context of kind of standard evolutionary<br>models about how life might have begun<br>you know the very first enzymes uh on<br>the planet in the primordial soup there<br>been the sense that they probably when<br>when life first arose they were probably<br>multifunctional sloppy did a bunch of<br>different reactions and through regular<br>old kind of evolutionary processes of<br>Gene duplication and Divergence you'd<br>evolve families of more specialist ones<br>so ancient primordial enzymes sure they<br>you know we we had a model that said<br>they were likely to be slow and sloppy<br>but Aero found a modern enzyme that had<br>vages of that same kind of um kind of<br>those those properties um and so that<br>outstanding Christian in the field then<br>was how special was a chiro's enzyme you<br>know was was that just a one-off fluke<br>that we found uh you know a modern<br>enzyme with this ancient primordial kind<br>of property to it um I should also say<br>that airo is was relatively eccentric as<br>you could tell from uh from his official<br>staff photo on the depart to a website<br>in those days should point out that uh<br>his vision is<br>perfect the glasses are completely for<br>Comic effect uh but it's also full of<br>these Pearls of Zin like wisdom um and<br>so I arrived in his lab I was like yeah<br>love your work you know I've spent the<br>last three and a half years in Cambridge<br>studying this enzyme called phosphor in<br>3 lat Sumas um I've got this great idea<br>to look for enzymes that have<br>promiscuous PRI activity and Cher said<br>Wayne I've found one enzyme you need to<br>find all the<br>enzymes I said jro it's impossible um<br>techniques for doing that won't be<br>2024 uh but sure enough we thought about<br>experiments that would try and<br>generalize this finding and so you know<br>as as a mentor he was great at getting<br>me to think big and think Broad and<br>think<br>fundamental um and I was also kind of I<br>was like but the other problem with Cho<br>is that even if I do manage to do this<br>it'll be this real kind of skim over the<br>surface you know I'll find lots of<br>examples if it all goes well but I won't<br>be able to explain them all in the<br>beautiful biochemical detail that I know<br>and love so don't worry Wayne take the<br>lwh hanging fruit others will fill in<br>the rest of the<br>details uh and he was tuned out to be<br>right and So eventually after thousands<br>of hours in the lab um I figured out how<br>to do the series of experiments to<br>really looked at how common and Broad<br>this property of promiscuity was in all<br>the enzymes from the lab backacter<br>ecoli um so did kind of over 100<br>experiments and the big reveal was uh<br>that it was really really common and<br>that was surprising at the time now it's<br>kind of that's the thing uh but it<br>really kind of led to this new view of<br>enzymes that in over 20% of my<br>experiments I could remove one enzyme<br>from eoli and find a promiscuous one<br>from somewhere else in eoli that could<br>take its place because it had this<br>little bit of side activity that uh that<br>would be become essential in the absence<br>of the one not<br>removed so really led to this growing<br>sense this new view of enzymes that that<br>wasn't like the one in the textbooks you<br>know the textbook view was and is this<br>idea of beautiful specificity and high<br>activity but instead my work in a cheros<br>lab helped to craft this new narrative<br>that there was messiness and noisiness<br>and sloppiness everywhere the metabolic<br>networks that we memorized as<br>undergraduates were uh way too simple<br>and way too clean and<br>tidy other formative thing that happened<br>to me in my Emory years was that uh I<br>asked Monica girth to marry me and so<br>and so about two minutes before this<br>photo was taken when we propped our<br>first digital camera on that rock in the<br>foreground um and so I do want to uh<br>point out that I've really been<br>privileged and honored to live to live<br>the dream of every nerdy science boy you<br>know not only did did I uh did I get to<br>marry the cutest girl in the lab uh but<br>we designed experiments together we uh<br>we wrote papers together as our career's<br>gone on we've won grants together for<br>the last 10 or 12 now years now we've<br>we've run a joint lab group together it<br>really has been uh as I say an amazing<br>privilege it's only just been a few<br>little kind of arguments over the<br>kitchen table around the best protocols<br>to make electric competence hours and<br>that kind of thing but over overall this<br>isn't the secret to marriage I don't<br>know what<br>is um so I came back from uh from the<br>US um full of these ideas controversial<br>ideas textbook breaking ideas the<br>textbooks all wrong they don't know<br>anything about enzy uh and so set about<br>establishing my own independent research<br>career and I really do at this point<br>want to stop and say that nothing I'm<br>going to say for the rest of this talk<br>is really done by me so uh so from here<br>on in it's been uh the other great<br>privilege of my career to have had this<br>team of amazing enthusiastic smart<br>energetic uh scientists work with me<br>students postdocs research assistants<br>International visitors so if you come<br>and visit me in my office um the history<br>of of Team enzymes is there for you to<br>see uh whether it's in the list of uh<br>the compiled set of thesis on one Shelf<br>with small amount of creative license<br>taken uh with Jordan competence here at<br>the printers right now so that she can<br>walk across the stage and graduate in<br>December not sure if pink was a color<br>but choice if it was she would have<br>taken it uh it's been a longstanding<br>thing in my group that every fortnite we<br>have meetings in which everyone comes<br>along with a little printed out set of<br>bullet points about what they've been up<br>to and my real time history of the lab<br>is therefore contained in these<br>ringbinder after ringbinder of every lab<br>report that's happened since I first got<br>a group and of course there's the top<br>shelf where all of the major events in<br>the history of my lab group have been uh<br>have been<br>commemorated if you're worried about<br>health and safety Bry which I'm sure you<br>are um I'll just point out that the<br>photo up there was taken on Sunday after<br>the earthquake on Sunday morning and so<br>uh in fact the earthquake restraints on<br>fine here they all are in order of<br>appearance in my group<br>um those of you who are in my group uh<br>who are in the audience will be<br>frantically looking don't tell me if<br>I've forgotten<br>someone um there's 66 names on that list<br>and so like any true academic uh I'm<br>going to take the next 66 hours to do<br>justice to their work um uh at least I<br>should but of course I don't have that<br>much time so instead I think I have to<br>apologize because I'll do justice to<br>none of their work in the way that it<br>could or should be done as I say though<br>the main point is that it's been this<br>huge privilege to have all of these<br>people uh work with me over the<br>years I'll give a few little Snippets of<br>the kind of stuff that we've uh that<br>we've done and I'll start with uh with<br>my first uh PhD student Valerie Sue who<br>really took what I'd done in a cheros<br>lab to the next level so she had this<br>Blockbuster PhD good advice for early<br>career researchers make your first PhD<br>student a really good one so it's a high<br>bar for those who<br>um so she looked for promiscuous enzymes<br>but that could do something novel so i'<br>said I'm going to remove an enzyme from<br>the metabolic Network and try and find<br>one to take its place she said I'm going<br>to look for promiscuous enzymes that<br>give a bacterium a little head start on<br>the path to antimicrobial resistance and<br>so effectively she took a non-pathogenic<br>lab strain of of eoli bacterium exposed<br>it to every antibiotic we could find<br>about 240 different antibiotics and<br>asked it to evolve resistance by using<br>you know a promiscuous enzyme that<br>didn't evolve to do that job because<br>these this lab strand had never seen<br>these drugs before and the results were<br>kind of horrifying so in almost 40% of<br>cases a non-pathogen like eoli already<br>had kind of the functions inside it to<br>give these first little steps towards<br>fullblown resistance wasn't full-blown<br>resistance like I showed you before it<br>was a matter of kind of you know growing<br>uh you know grow at slightly higher<br>concentrations of a drug than uh than it<br>could without those promiscuous enzymes<br>but nevertheless if you're weren't<br>nervous about antimicrobial resistance<br>before you should be now because it's<br>really easy to arise uh in in bacteria<br>based on just the enzymes I've got<br>inside them<br>already at the same time students<br>starting with Matilda um started doing<br>that deep dive into the real uh kind of<br>mechanistic and structural aspects of of<br>promiscuous enzymes that I'd longed to<br>do in a chiros lab um and so Matilda's<br>PhD was really unprecedented at the time<br>and its and its depth um so she had a<br>case in which um collaborators had<br>evolved a different<br>bacterium removed one enzyme and and<br>evolved it so it had to use another<br>enzyme to take its place and there was a<br>series of changes in that enzyme<br>mutational steps involved in that<br>process so Mata did this amazing deep<br>dive into exactly how every one of those<br>changes in the protein um decreased the<br>old activity increased the new activity<br>how those traded off not only that we<br>solved structures of all of the enzymes<br>so an absolute Atomic level resolution<br>we could explain how a change in the<br>evolution of a bacterium had manifested<br>at a molecular level um and it was all<br>in the context of the evolving bacterium<br>you know how these mutational changes<br>caused it to grow faster or slower in a<br>bunch of different environments so this<br>real uh kind of Blockbuster in her case<br>at connecting all the dots between um<br>Evolution all the way down to kind of<br>atomic level explanation of how of how<br>these molecules work to affect that<br>evolutionary<br>outcome we did a bunch of those kind of<br>studies through those through those<br>years with the other people listed on<br>that slide as well but one thing that I<br>kept noticing and became really obvious<br>is we're doing all these Evolution<br>experiments changing the functions of<br>enzymes making bacteria evolve new ones<br>they never evolve them to be as good as<br>the enzymes uh in the<br>textbooks and so that evolved to a point<br>where of course you know the enzyme was<br>good enough that the bacterium grew fine<br>bacterium didn't need the enzyme to be<br>any better it was happy the way it was<br>in its lab environment where we were<br>kind of giving it a good chance of life<br>um but it really kind of got me thinking<br>about just how biased is our view of<br>enzymes you just how wrong long are the<br>textbooks you know that the textbooks<br>are full of these examples of massive<br>High activity Exquisite specificity<br>Exquisite regulation um and we could<br>never evolve that kind of stuff in our<br>experiments um and the answer is that<br>our view is incredibly biased so Chelsea<br>vica's uh lockdown project during the<br>pandemic was to make this figure this is<br>a tree of life many of you are probably<br>familiar with the idea it summarizes all<br>the genetic diversity of all the kn<br>organisms on the planet mostly bacteria<br>not very many ukar like us you know the<br>plants and the animals and the fungi and<br>humans um and a few more of the ARA um<br>and the rule of the game Chelsea played<br>was to say if a single enzyme had been<br>characterized from one from a branch on<br>this tree of life uh should color that<br>Branch red and the branches on this tree<br>are hundreds of species each one of<br>those species has thousands of enzymes<br>there might be a million enzy enes in<br>each branch of this tree and Chelsea<br>colored it red if one of the million had<br>been characterized by by a chemist<br>somewhere you can see there's pretty<br>vast suades of black where we just have<br>absolutely no idea about anything to do<br>with the biochemistry the enzymes the<br>metabolism of uh a vast number of<br>species on the planet may not surprise<br>you to learn that we're incredibly<br>biased and towards knowing a lot about<br>ukar um over half of what we know about<br>en as ukar and within that is a<br>relatively uninteresting biochemically<br>species called Homo sapiens that we know<br>the most about um and<br>so it struck me that we needed to do<br>something about this we needed to bring<br>uh the knowledge of enzymes in line with<br>our emerging knowledge of the diversity<br>of all of biology and Chelsea and Jordan<br>and others have have taken on this task<br>so for example it's a pretty interesting<br>black<br>line here uh and that's the one that<br>includes ouria most closely related to<br>us so procaryotes most closely related<br>to the<br>ukar only recently discovered another<br>way of saying that I suppose is that uh<br>you could put this picture on your<br>mantle piece because if you go back 100<br>million Generations or so in your family<br>tree there's a pretty good vet that<br>Grandpa looks something like<br>this um<br>discovered in 2020 and Chelsea and<br>Jordan immediately jumped in there and<br>decided to characterize some of the<br>enzymes because no one had ever done<br>that before uh and so for example um in<br>Jordan's recently completed PhD she<br>picked on one and did this beautiful<br>kind of uh dive into the structure and<br>function of this enzyme there never been<br>from an organism where no enzymes had<br>ever been studied before and found that<br>it was kind of weird it's uh does three<br>jobs the one in humans only does one<br>uh but at the same time all of that<br>detailed biochemical characterization<br>that she did let her s you know it<br>became obvious how this unusual enzyme<br>that had never been glimpsed before<br>could evolve into the type of enzyme<br>that are in us and and our relatives on<br>the eukariotic<br>branch so some real kind of fundamental<br>look at uh at this ungs diversity at the<br>molecular<br>level so I guess you know in terms of<br>this uh fundamental Research into<br>enzymology and metabolic biochemistry um<br>take-home message in my mind at least is<br>that textbook biochemistry needs to meet<br>the messy reality of<br>biology um and in fact you know rather<br>than defining enzymes with<br>characteristics like catalytic power<br>specificity Exquisite regulation um<br>probably more accurate uh um definition<br>might be slow and sloppy diverse easy to<br>evolve I just have to write the textbook<br>next I suppose I'll get on<br>it that's the fundamental stuff for the<br>last part of uh of the talk I want to<br>switch and talk about how this knowledge<br>of enology uh can be used in more<br>applied ways here's a quiz question um<br>so one thing about moving back to New<br>Zealand and starting my own lab group is<br>I realized how expensive everything is<br>here in terms of lab reagents and so<br>molecular biologists and biochemists<br>like me all around the world spend a<br>Fortune of mas and money uh buying ultra<br>high value enzymes so every molecular<br>biology lab in the world will have a<br>tube of enzyme one of many enzymes like<br>like this one um that retail for prices<br>like this hundreds if not thousands of<br>um I reped earlier um and that's our<br>discounted price um whereas it struck me<br>that I'd move back home to New Zealand<br>to a country where what we did uh as the<br>backbone of our economy was to sell<br>biological products like this to the<br>rest of the world and so at the going<br>price of $169 a ton uh you could buy<br>almost six tons of logs uh or you could<br>buy this<br>one of these biological products I posit<br>is a better uh economic backbone for our<br>country than the other an ultra high<br>value near weightless uh exportable<br>commodity and so in parallel with all<br>this fundamental stuff about enzyme<br>Evolution um enzyme diversity um we've<br>leaned into this idea of trying to find<br>more examples of ultra high value<br>enzymes that could be Bonafide um export<br>earners from New Zealand<br>building the biotech uh Community here<br>obviously not all enzymes cost that much<br>and I bought this on sale for 11 bucks<br>from countdown um not on my PE<br>card uh but there's a market that could<br>be had if you think I'm crazy I just<br>wanted a quicker Side based on something<br>I found while researching for this<br>lecture it's a company you might have<br>heard of in Denmark called Novo Nordisk<br>so it was founded in 1923 101 years ago<br>uh by three clever Danish<br>biochemists two of whom were a married<br>couple actually as it turns out I only<br>learned that yesterday um so they<br>figured out how to prepare and purify<br>and formulate and sell A protein that<br>you might have heard of called insulin<br>uh and fast forward 100 years 100 Years<br>of innovation of hiring thousands of<br>incredibly smart people a constant focus<br>on research and development last year<br>the headline was that the value of Novo<br>is now greater than the rest of Denmark<br>combined and so my point if you're in<br>bt31 I've stood on this soap box before<br>we can do this Denmark has roughly the<br>same population as New Zealand Denmark<br>has a proud history of primary<br>production it's changed its economy to<br>one that develops and innovates and<br>exports things like<br>this so what have I done about it not<br>that<br>here we have however uh tried to use<br>enzymes for biotechnological purposes<br>and so um back in the day Robbie and<br>Susan managed to we we licensed an<br>enzyme uh to an overseas company called<br>entics generated a little bit of royalty<br>income at that time Danny had this uh<br>great uh PhD in collaboration with lanch<br>so um back when it was a little New<br>Zealand startup company before it became<br>what it is now which is a multi-billion<br>dollar US biotech Juggernaut we've got a<br>patent with them um for all we know<br>Danny's mutated alcohol dehydrogenase is<br>in one of their production strains um<br>Tiff who I saw around somewhere earlier<br>is uh is the world expert on this enzyme<br>uh RNA liaye and we got really close to<br>commercializing it it would have been a<br>version like this an enzyme in the<br>freezer of molecular biologists around<br>the world with an international company<br>called Perkin Alma who fired their<br>business manager got a new one and was<br>less interested in our product um but<br>really it's been the most recent work<br>with uh Chris and Lee and others uh in<br>this kind of cheap and cheerful kind of<br>setting that has uh start of my biotech<br>Empire I hope um so Lee worked on um a<br>little test for wine makers wine makers<br>need to do lots of tests in order to<br>make good quality wine as cheaply as<br>possible with the biggest possible<br>profit maret margin Sal it more<br>expensive than Australian wines um uh<br>and so she made a test for the nitrogen<br>containing compounds in grape juice<br>something that wine makers need to know<br>about they need to know quickly they<br>want a simple answer she designed this<br>test using enzymes that were new to<br>science but built on technology that was<br>started uh by uh Dave aley and alist<br>brown out there um VW owned IP um uh to<br>give them what they wanted yellow not<br>enough nitrogen in your grapes this year<br>blue too much uh so you can manage it<br>accordingly and assistant wine makers<br>and wine makers around New Zealand like<br>this young guy in blenham tested our<br>prototypes they really loved it so I've<br>got to the point where uh the reason I<br>was in the lab on Sunday was not to take<br>the photograph of the wine bottles um it<br>was to work with Lee to prep our first<br>um sample of these enzymes for potential<br>commercial sale so we've uh just prepped<br>with Alisa's massive amount of help um<br>this valuable cargo we've prepped uh<br>this magical blend of enzymes to affect<br>this test and we've just sent it just<br>arrived this morning uh to a major wine<br>supply company in Australia where<br>they're hoping to roll it out to Aussie<br>wine Growers over the summer season and<br>so looks like a lot of white powder<br>actually less than half a gram of the<br>white powder is the enzyme part the rest<br>is just filler but we're not telling<br>them that um and if this goes well and<br>they sell the kits that they want to<br>sell this summer that'll be about 35<br>,000 in sales for uh for less than half<br>a gram of enzyme that Elise and Lee made<br>um this month<br>um exciting times for us and we're<br>hoping to do a licensing commercial<br>licensing deal with this uh with this<br>wine supply company not exciting enough<br>for your average venture capitalist for<br>whom wine is too small of a market uh<br>but it turns out that Lee was smart<br>enough to realize that her enzymes could<br>also detect related metabolites that are<br>markers of chronic kidney disease and<br>getting into the biomedical kind of<br>market for these kind of tests adds a<br>lot of zeros on the end of your business<br>modeling um and so what we're fleshing<br>out now is tweaking the test uh in such<br>a way that it might be in a form to<br>enter um biomedical Market the back of<br>the envelope calculations for this are<br>kind of frightening in some ways make<br>very conservative estimates about<br>getting it into one of the big American<br>Pharmacy chains like CVS Walgreens they<br>sell a few tests for price they sell<br>similar tests all of a sudden that's a$<br>150 to $200 million Market in sales per<br>year and the fun part of the back of the<br>envelope calculation is it would take<br>about this much enzyme about 2 kilos and<br>so we can make this in New Zealand we<br>could have an export Market of those<br>kind of quanta uh using the technology<br>that we have here right now I think<br>that's um something to hold on<br>to of course it's a fast moving field as<br>I said right at the start woke up this<br>morning and uh Nobel Prize has been<br>given in it I just want to reassure you<br>that we're on top of it um um the two<br>guys on the left Deus hus and John<br>jumper um what they came up with Alpha<br>fold is already totally uh<br>run-ofthe-mill in our group we've had<br>students for years using that to predict<br>protein structure production the Real<br>Genius on the slide in terms of protein<br>uh structure function and design is<br>David Baker um his amazing tools for uh<br>for Designing entirely new enzymes from<br>scratch don't look anything like the<br>ones found anywhere in biology are<br>mind-blowing and um very fortunate to<br>have a new PhD student Isaac green<br>starting uh next month uh and he's going<br>to be using that to design our next<br>generation of of proteins to uh to be<br>involved in this RNA vacine work so it's<br>exciting times but if I was going to<br>leave you with one image I think it<br>should be this one that uh based on what<br>I've told you the future of New<br>Zealand's export industry doesn't have<br>to be dependent on things that we sell<br>for 170 bucks a ton and put on ships to<br>ship a really long way to get to the<br>Target markets but instead if you leave<br>the bright future in the hands of<br>Google's new generative AI app uh you<br>could make something on this kind of<br>scale but ship it to those offshore<br>markets and something that looks like<br>this and that would would be much more<br>befitting so finally then I really do<br>just want to end by saying that um that<br>the real Great Joy of being in Academia<br>is not giving lectures it's not writing<br>grants uh it is um hanging out with<br>these guys and so here's a selection of<br>of photos of group members through<br>different kind of eras of it I suppose<br>um everyone whose work I've talked about<br>um today is in there somewhere and as I<br>say it's um it's really all due to them<br>that understanding up here and I I'm<br>you way way<br>way I'm super super tempting to roast<br>you at this point but this is a very<br>so Fijian language week I'm uh Professor<br>Nikki Nelson the dean of Faculty of<br>Science and I'm delighted to give the<br>vote of thanks I feel very privileged to<br>be up here to thank you for your<br>inaugural lecture Professor<br>Patrick making sure you're still on the<br>screen in the video so your dad can<br>watch it later great thanks be tough um<br>I acknowledge the chor I acknowledge the<br>probost and any other senior leadership<br>in the room that I've missed all our<br>colleagues friends<br>Monica uh thanks for coming I'm hoping<br>the students here haven't been red and<br>appropriately to come with marks or<br>anything like that you can tell me later<br>if that's the case um it's a real<br>pleasure to have everyone here tonight<br>this evening we've been honored to hear<br>Professor Patrick shar's enthusiasm for<br>enzymes with us his contagious<br>excitement uh just reminds us that we're<br>standing in the frontier of an really<br>exhilarating<br>field as exemplified by the Nobel Prize<br>today<br>um what struck me most about Wayne's<br>lecture is his vision for our future the<br>new technologies that are letting us<br>study the structures and functions of<br>enzymes from weird and wonderful<br>microorganisms alongside that we're<br>witnessing this dawn of Aid<br>driven um pro protein design and soon<br>we'll have the capacity to create<br>artificial enzymes tailored to catalyze<br>whatever we please and and that is<br>beginning it's not it's not a future<br>that we haven't seen yet that's already<br>in<br>place I think Waynes um showed us of his<br>really ambitious efforts to bridge not<br>just academic research but to take it<br>into practical<br>application and and launching a biotech<br>company to bring enzyme based biosensors<br>that's just an amazing achievement so<br>well done thank<br>you um cutting Cutting Edge work uh but<br>Wayne's uh Forward Thinking approach is<br>evident also in other areas of his work<br>and his contributions to leadership<br>within the faculty of Science University<br>um and The Wider scientific Community is<br>enormous of really valued having his<br>Council as a deputy head of school and<br>currently as the associate Dean research<br>and our<br>faculty his dedication is to advancing<br>his own work but also those of his<br>colleagues and his students um other<br>researchers in our organization is<br>really uh really valued so thank you<br>Wayne um I note standing here quite<br>nervously because I do actually have a<br>reasonable amount of dirt on Wayne um<br>and but I promis that I would treat this<br>occasion very formally so the PC way of<br>be of describing Wayne and you can ask<br>me later about what that really means is<br>an enthusiastic brainstormer of<br>unconventional<br>Solutions a critical thinker and a<br>realist uh but you know the Muppets and<br>the guys that sit up on the balcony W<br>off and<br>Stadler more over a wine later so to<br>conclude look I just want to<br>congratulate Wayne on a fantastic and a<br>gr lecture like I said it's a real<br>privilege to be up here doing this job<br>um you should be immensely proud uh not<br>only of your presentation tonight<br>because it was super interesting and we<br>were awake the whole time laughing so uh<br>but just all the outstanding work of<br>your career so far and as a professor of<br>this organization you should continue to<br>Contin contribute in that way please uh<br>look uh that's the end tonight I I<br>welcome you all to come next door and<br>have a ni ball and a wine and chat to<br>Wayne and just enjoy each other's<br>company and you know thank you all so<br>much for coming but at this point let's</p></main><footer style="margin-top: 2rem; background: #0001; padding: 2rem; text-align: center;"><p>We Are The University</p><ul style="list-style-type: none;
