However, the extent to which wild populations can adapt to rapidly shifting environmental conditions remains controversial, as evolution is typically considered to be a slow, incremental process. While the biological effects of some anthropogenic pressures – such as pollution and overfishing – have been well studied, the potential evolutionary impacts of human-driven forest loss are largely unknown. My research group focuses on understanding the evolutionary impacts of deforestation on the endemic insect fauna of Aotearoa. In this presentation, I highlight how deforestation has driven dramatic shifts in both insect wing length and colour, providing an exciting new “textbook example” of rapid anthropogenic evolution. I will discuss the key genomic mechanisms underpinning these changes, and explore whether reforestation will reverse the evolutionary impacts of deforestation.<br><br>Biography: Dr McCulloch is a Research Fellow based at the University of Otago. His research focuses on understanding the key ecological and genomic factors that have shaped the evolution of the unique insect fauna of Aotearoa.</p><h2>Transcript</h2><p style="opacity: 0.9;

mlla from University ofo<br>joining us so um Graham did his<br>undergrad and PhD again at ataro um he's<br>post stocked at the University of<br>Queensland um he's now back at the<br>University of AO working as a researcher<br>um been involved in a couple of mar<br>projects<br>um and yeah I mean the work he's going<br>to talk to today it's about um New<br>Zealand stream insects particularly one<br>of our stonefly species Al land pea um<br>it's some really interesting um<br>evolutionary patterns<br>um so yeah I'll let ground take over<br>cool all right thank you very much Frank<br>um thank you for organizing us and thank<br>you Joshua for helping do this and thank<br>you Chrissy for the invite um she<br>invited me a couple of years ago<br>um so I'm only about two years too late<br>so today I'm going to talk about these<br>guys here these are stoneflies and these<br>guys are really cool and if you're not<br>convinced they're cool now hopefully you<br>will be by the end of the<br>seminar so as Frank said I'm a<br>researcher at University of otago um and<br>most of my research involves using<br>genomic tools um to understand really<br>cool questions about Evolution and<br>ecology<br>so this is back in 2006 um believe it or<br>not that's me there was no gray here uh<br>the reason for that is it's before I did<br>my<br>PhD um and also before I had kids and so<br>in 2006 I decided to do a<br>PhD<br>um and so I did it with John John over<br>there with the stonefly um and it's fair<br>to say John knew absolutely nothing<br>about stoneflies when we<br>started um and I knew even less and so<br>now this is team stonefly in<br>2024 Frank you're featuring this um and<br>so we have a number of different people<br>involved in this now so we've got a huge<br>number of students involved who have<br>driven driven a huge amount of This<br>research so a lot of This research is<br>actually driven by students and I'll try<br>to point that out as we go um and then<br>we've got collaborators we've got<br>physiologists we've got people who work<br>on um stonefly<br>behavior um we' even got a um someone<br>who's a phys a psychologist in there<br>strangely um and so it's a really<br>diverse group we've got now and it's<br>really<br>exciting um so today I'm going to talk<br>about anthropogenic<br>Evolution so if people know about<br>anthropogenic Evolution the cool thing<br>about it is it happens really fast um so<br>we're not looking at something that's<br>going to happen over millions of years<br>we're looking at something that's<br>happening over tens of years or hundreds<br>of years and probably the most iconic<br>example of this is these moths here so<br>these are peer moths um back in about<br>1800 um everyone in Britain was<br>collecting pepper moths um probably<br>because there was nothing else to do<br>back<br>then and so every moth they found back<br>then was this peppered<br>color we then went through the<br>Industrial Revolution so late 1700s<br>early 1800s and what happen is all the<br>trees suddenly got dark they got covered<br>in smog um we can see in this bottom<br>bottom picture there and suddenly it was<br>actually an advantage to be melanic so<br>by about 1900 98% of the moths were<br>melanic so that's pretty incredible<br>isn't it within 100 years you've gone<br>from almost completely pepper to almost<br>completely<br>melanic so in the last 30 40 years<br>there's been a real push to clean up<br>again clean up all the smog and suddenly<br>the trees have changed color again so<br>the trees are now back to what they were<br>before we can see in this top photo um<br>and suddenly it's an advantage to be<br>peered again and so the most recent<br>survey in about 2010 about 90% of them<br>were back to that pepper color and so<br>this is a really iconic example of um<br>anthropogenic Evolution what I'm going<br>to talk to you today is about two<br>examples of an trenic evolution in New<br>Zealand insects these two examples are<br>even better than these for two reasons<br>one is about some endemic species from<br>flies and the main driver we're looking<br>at here is<br>deforestation so that's when people cut<br>down or burn down the<br>forests and here we have a picture of<br>the South Island<br>some of you North Islanders may not<br>recognize it but this is the South<br>Island this is the other half of New<br>Zealand um and has undergone extensive<br>deforestation so almost more than 70% of<br>our forests have been lost since the<br>arrival of humans so initially there was<br>a lot of burning um when the Polynesians<br>arrived and that really intensified<br>particularly in the last couple hundred<br>years when Europeans arrived and so now<br>we have a huge amount of deforested<br>areas<br>um and so when you have this<br>deforestation you present the animals<br>that are in the surviving area a couple<br>of different<br>options disperse or<br>die or maybe<br>evolve and when you look at that picture<br>there it's actually quite a stark<br>contrast isn't<br>it you got the nice green there and then<br>you've got a completely different<br>habitat when it's deforested not only<br>don't you have the trees you have<br>everything associated with that you have<br>different Predators you have different<br>wind conditions you have different um<br>humidity different um sun and so it's<br>quite a big<br>change and so here we are back to the<br>hero of the show The<br>stonefly so if you don't know Stone<br>flies you will know them soon so Stone<br>flies are stream invertebrates they have<br>nymphs that live in the streams for<br>between 1 to four years depending on the<br>species then they have these very<br>short-lived adults and so the adults are<br>living for maybe 1 to four weeks um and<br>then they they'll fly around they'll<br>mate back into the stream and go back<br>into NS again and<br>so the first aspect I'm going to be<br>looking at is<br>wings so we're looking at anthropogenic<br>flight um and so as I said they normally<br>NS turn to these adults but in some<br>cases particular in New Zealand we end<br>up with these guys so these here are<br>wingless<br>adults uh this is a stonefly that our<br>team discovered in Monga which is just<br>overlooking Den airport about five years<br>ago um so that that um black stonefly as<br>you can see it's got absolutely no wings<br>and about a quarter of our Stone flies<br>have no wings at all um and that's<br>really unique so we don't have that<br>anywhere else in the world and this is<br>actually what appealed to me initially<br>when I start started to work on the<br>system was just a huge number of species<br>that seem to be have no wings I wanted<br>to know why they didn't have wings and<br>what was the genetic basis for us why<br>does this keep<br>happening um and as you can see they<br>actually look really<br>cool um so there's there's three<br>examples of some<br>stoneflies and all that we knew when I<br>environments um and so most of my last<br>15 years I spent a lot of time going up<br>to these albine environments so I've got<br>a couple of students here I've got Kaho<br>up there and an around there Brody on<br>the other picture um and we spent a lot<br>of time going up to these environments<br>collecting these samples um which you<br>can imagine is actually a really fun<br>do and one of the one of the first<br>things I was really interested in is is<br>it the Alpine environment so that was<br>what was record recorded as causing this<br>Wing loss<br>but there wasn't really any evidence for<br>it and so this here is a picture a a<br>figure showing um full wi species um on<br>our Y axis we've got<br>elevation um don't worry about the<br>x-axis at the moment um the full Wing<br>species are in black and the wingless<br>species are in red and so when we look<br>at it like this it seems like elevation<br>seems to be a pretty good proxy for<br>whether they have wings or not um it's<br>worth noting that this this is actually<br>combined across a whole lot of different<br>species so for example if we said a<br>th000 meters is that cut off that sort<br>of differentiates most of the full wi<br>species from the vial Wing species or<br>the short Wing<br>species can move it up to the still<br>looks like pretty<br>good what we really want to do is put a<br>line through here though so that line<br>there would separate everything above<br>that line would be red so be viid winged<br>or winged um and most of below that line<br>would be<br>black and that line is actually a real<br>line so on the xaxis we actually have<br>the elevation of the local tree line so<br>we can see a picture there of the tree<br>line so this is when you go up a<br>mountain this is as far up the mountain<br>as the trees<br>go and so what this is saying that<br>anything above that line is above the<br>tree line and almost always it's got<br>short<br>Wings below that line it's almost always<br>got full<br>wings and so what this is saying it's<br>not elevation per se that's causing<br>these things to lose their wings it's<br>line um and the really cool thing is we<br>can actually look at this also within a<br>species so this is the land of PE of<br>fenestrata this is the first stone fly<br>that I ever really worked on and it's<br>actually got two different morphs we've<br>got a big full winged morph you can see<br>there it's also got one there with faal<br>wings or really tiny little wings and<br>both of these morphs are found basically<br>throughout the Lower South Island so<br>this map here shows them um the vdual<br>wing ones in red and the full Wing ones<br>in blue so you can see they're they're<br>all over the<br>place and so we can do the same sort of<br>analysis with these guys it's not quite<br>as clean as when we look at those um<br>inter specific um comparisons but again<br>you can see that almost always above the<br>tree line things have short Wings below<br>the tree line they have full wings and<br>we do have a couple of places there<br>where we find both the full wind and the<br>together and one of the really cool<br>things we found is you can actually see<br>this transition when you go walk up a<br>stream so these are two streams um on<br>the Rock and pillar range which is about<br>an hour in land from<br>denen and what we did is we walked up<br>the Stream and took samples every 100<br>met and then we could record whether<br>wind um and this graph here shows as<br>graphing elevation versus proportion of<br>theal winged morphs so at the bottom at<br>about 300 at 200 300 M everything's got<br>full winged as we started making our way<br>up the mountain at about 600 M we<br>started to notice oh there's some Vidal<br>Wing ones coming in and eventually when<br>you got to the top of the mountain<br>everything was fored winged so you can<br>actually see this transition within<br>individual streams so these are two<br>individual streams about 5Ks apart and<br>we're seeing the same transition in both<br>streams um and in both cases this<br>transition seems to be associated with<br>the tree line so basically below the<br>tree line everything's full winged the<br>moment you get to the tree line you're<br>sort of starting to get a 50/50 mix and<br>then by the time you 100 m above that<br>again so what's actually causing this<br>why is this tree line so<br>important well the reason we think is<br>quite obvious when you're actually out<br>there um is the wind so when you're<br>doing the sampling you're in the trees<br>it's nice and calm there's no wind<br>around everything seems fine the moment<br>you get out of those trees the wind<br>picks up and particularly up at those I<br>mean the rocking pillars the moment you<br>get out of those trees it is really<br>windy and so what we think is when<br>they're above the tree line these things<br>can't really survive up there without<br>wings um they're not good Flyers to<br>start with um and they're stream<br>invertebrates so they're very much have<br>to get back to their stream the moment<br>you get blown away from your stream<br>you're gone from the population so<br>you've got two options here you either<br>get better bigger and better wings and a<br>lot of insects do that or as the stone<br>fles do they just give up and get rid of<br>their<br>wings and so this is actually really<br>important what we know now is that it's<br>the forest that seems to be um linked to<br>Wing loss rather than altitude and so<br>then when when we come back and think<br>about<br>deforestation we can actually start to<br>make predictions what's going to happen<br>when you cut down<br>forests so we have a a potential<br>conceptual idea of what's going to<br>happen there so a long time ago<br>everything was forested we would expect<br>most things to be full winged as those<br>forests get cut down we would expect<br>less obviously less Forest cover so less<br>that are going to be full wind and then<br>in areas where there's no Forest we<br>disappear um a lot of this work was<br>driven by Brody there we can see he was<br>a PhD student of ours um currently in<br>Brisbane um and what he was particularly<br>interested in is the tree lines<br>um and so we got two pictures here one<br>is of a natural tree line um you can see<br>it it's quite impressive it's basically<br>a straight line uh that's at about 1100<br>met but what actually happens when you<br>have a lot of burning is your tree lines<br>actually get lowered so it burns<br>everything at the top of the tree line<br>everything at the top of the gullies and<br>all you end up with is a little bit of<br>Remnant tree in the galy and this tree<br>line is can be 200 300 400 M lower than<br>originally and so we looked at at five<br>locations here and what we did is we did<br>the same sort of transics that we done<br>on the Rock and pillar in these<br>different locations so to see what sort<br>of transition we get from Full wi ones<br>to reduced Wing<br>ones the only one with a natural tree<br>line is Bing bur so this is in fand it's<br>got a natural tree line at about 1,100<br>M and then we had four locations with<br>lowered tree lines so these tree lines<br>had been artificially lowered because of<br>burning and so our first figure there is<br>showing the frequency of lightness ones<br>versus the the elevation um you can see<br>they all show these curves where you<br>start off with full Wing ones at the<br>bottom and they go almost fixed to vial<br>Wing ones at the top but you can see<br>this occurs at different<br>elevations we can then correct that to<br>where the tree liners<br>and what you can see is almost in every<br>single location it's all to do with that<br>Alpine tree line so if you're below that<br>tree line you're full wind you're above<br>the tree line you proed you<br>went but the crucial thing is here is<br>these tree lines have actually moved<br>these tree lines weren't actually<br>already at always at this location so<br>this is where these tree lines used to<br>be they used to be 100 200 300 M further<br>Upstream so what we've actually seen has<br>happened is we've actually seen this<br>really rapid adaptation<br>so these populations used to be full<br>wied and then the tree Line's gone and<br>then suddenly become short winged which<br>is really<br>cool um and so we got some really cool<br>publicity for this this is about four or<br>five years ago um that was in the New<br>York Times when Evol when insect lost<br>their wing their homes Evolution clip<br>their<br>wings uh and then this has just come out<br>in New Zealand Geographic check it out<br>if you get a chance uh by Kate Evans and<br>gazelle gazelle Clarkson um just talking<br>loss and so we know this that<br>deforestation has lowered these tree<br>lines and it's caused this sort of Rapid<br>Evolution but what actually happens in<br>the lowland<br>areas so we know that there's huge waves<br>of the otago region that are completely<br>now deforested so this would have all<br>been even at lowlands would have been<br>completely covered in forests and so<br>this is lead by Gracie um a master<br>student of ours who finished last<br>year um and what we did is we we looked<br>for a sort of similar to what we had<br>with those elevational gradients this<br>time we actually had a latitudinal<br>gradient so at the bottom at Jimmy's<br>creek site number one that's completely<br>forested um Bowmont and Canadian have a<br>bit of forest a bit of scrub The Willows<br>has a bit of scrub and then eventually<br>we go to places which have completely<br>lost their forest and so do we see that<br>that same transition in the lowland as<br>mountain and the answer is<br>yes so the pie charts here show the<br>proportion of full winged ones in black<br>and your vedal winged ones or reduced<br>Wing ones in<br>white so the the four to the South<br>completely full of fourwing ones as we<br>start to transition into this deforested<br>area we start to get<br>mixtures and then we we're fully<br>deforested<br>we've completely lost wings<br>again and again this this stuff has only<br>been around for 800 years this this lack<br>of forest so 800 years ago this would<br>have been fully forested everything<br>would have been W would have been fully<br>winged so we see this transition<br>happening really<br>fast um that's just another way to look<br>at it looking at these sort of<br>particular cines showing they show the<br>same sort of pattern as we see when we<br>clients so that was that's really<br>exciting um<br>what I'm particularly interested in as I<br>said at the start is the<br>genomics um there was a couple of big<br>questions I was interested in one are<br>the full Wing ones and vdual Wing ones<br>related how are they related to each<br>other are they two different Gene pools<br>or are they the same um I done some<br>earlier I'd done some mitochondrial<br>markers which suggested there was no<br>difference but what will we find with<br>genomic markers and the second thing is<br>to find the gene that's involved or the<br>genes that are involved in<br>this and so what we did is we sampled uh<br>full wi ones and vestigal Wing ones from<br>eight populations so these eight<br>populations have where we know we have<br>mixtures of both both forms we then did<br>some genotyping by sequencing so that's<br>uh getting the genome cutting it all up<br>and comparing sequences across them so<br>we've got about 50,000 Snips across the<br>genome so it's sort of giving us this<br>genome WI analysis of what's going<br>on uh the first thing to notice here is<br>we ended up with three different um<br>groups so we got a fan group a rock and<br>pillar group and an umbrellas Mountain<br>Group and I'll have a look in a bit more<br>detail on these<br>groups this is fand this is up Mount<br>Burns track which is amazing track if<br>anyone gets a chance to go up<br>there and what we were expecting to find<br>is one of two<br>things either we are going to find<br>everything is is mixed together so<br>there's no difference between the full<br>wi ones and the resid wing ones or we<br>were expecting to find maybe all the the<br>falling ones would be in one group and<br>all the foring ones would be in a<br>different<br>group we found something completely<br>different so this is a PCA showing the<br>relationships among the different<br>populations and in fact we actually<br>found three<br>groups so all the full wi ones together<br>so at the bottom of the stream so all<br>together<br>but what we found was there was actually<br>two completely independent vdal Wing<br>populations so what that means is these<br>two populations at the top are different<br>from the populations at the bottom and<br>they're also different from each other<br>which is really unexpected this suggests<br>that they've actually probably gone up<br>to the top of that mountain and been<br>time and we found exactly the same<br>pattern on the Rock and pillar range<br>three different<br>groups so the full wi ones were all<br>together and then the two Vidal Wing<br>populations again different from each<br>other and this is really incredible<br>because these populations in this case<br>are only be three k apart and they're<br>different and then this is our Central<br>group and here we found a different<br>pattern completely completely different<br>pattern again so these ones are all<br>reasonably closely clustered together<br>but we can separate them out by<br>stream but in this case we found no<br>difference between the full wi ones and<br>stream so why is that why are we getting<br>this different pattern in different<br>regions so most of these places the tree<br>line is at about or the mountain itself<br>is probably only goes up to a th000<br>met so 800 years ago before there's been<br>there would have been probably no Vidal<br>Wing ones up there at all everything on<br>that mountain would have been full<br>winged so only in the last 800 years<br>when we've had this little bit of<br>deforestation has there been this<br>habitat for these Vidal Wing ones to<br>come so again we what we've got here is<br>we've probably got new Wing loss in each<br>of these<br>locations so if you cut down the<br>trees suddenly these things start losing<br>and so the question I always had is why<br>is there so much Wing loss How come<br>every time you go to the top of a<br>mountain you find these forid your wing<br>once it's a really interesting thing<br>when you think about it because if you<br>lose your wings you don't actually<br>spread around much which makes it quite<br>hard to explain and how come every time<br>we have this deforestation these things<br>seem to rapidly adapt and lose their<br>wings and so there's probably a couple<br>of different options from from a genomic<br>perspective anyway so one we've got<br>different denovo mutations at each<br>location so each time they're coming up<br>with a different<br>solution um to their conditions and<br>losing their<br>wings the second option is you have a<br>mutation<br>once and then that spreads to all the<br>different places and so we wanted to<br>was and so we've been looking at this<br>sort of trying to find the genes<br>involved in Wing L for at least the last<br>seven years uh what I'm going to talk to<br>you about is the most recent one and<br>these are results we've only got through<br>in the last couple of<br>weeks and what we did here is we took<br>again we took we went to places where we<br>know we had mixtures of them we had<br>mixtures of full wi ones and shortwing<br>ones we took 40 of each and we did whole<br>genome resequencing and so that's trying<br>to get the whole genomes of each of<br>these individuals and compare them<br>across each<br>other we then looked for<br>outliers and by out I mean particular<br>Snips in the genome that differentiate<br>the full winged ones and the viid wing<br>ones and so for each of those locations<br>we had outliers so we had outliers at<br>Six Mile blackjacks and mount Burns and<br>then we wanted to look for ones that<br>locations and we found one gene with a<br>whole lot of outliers in it across each<br>of those locations and so we got really<br>excited we thought right we found the<br>gene<br>this is excellent it's going to be one<br>of the genes that they've worked on in<br>drop because they know about 10 genes in<br>dropa or more than that that involved in<br>in Wing loss they all have really easy<br>names to remember like vdle wingless<br>apterus and then we've got the game and<br>it's angiogenic factor with G patch and<br>FHA<br>domains<br>so it has no known role at this stage in<br>Wing<br>loss um we know angiogenic means it's<br>got something to do with blood vessel<br>development um but that's all we really<br>it so what we then did is we took we<br>went well we know it seems to be<br>involved in these three locations how<br>about we look at other locations where<br>we have this sort of mixture and so we<br>went to I think there's about 12 or 13<br>locations here where we had a mixture we<br>took a few full wings and a full reduced<br>Wing ones and we sequenced the first um<br>Gene and because it's a coding sequence<br>we could then translate that to amino<br>acids when we looked at it initially we<br>didn't see anything anything that<br>interesting when we looked at it just<br>looking at the um the<br>bases and so here we can see we've got a<br>whole lot of samples here um I haven't<br>shown them all on here so example at the<br>top it says fourwing n equals 10 I've<br>only shown five but we've actually got<br>10 10 in there and then we've got the<br>full winged n equals 30 probably only<br>got half of them in there if we start<br>looking at the four Wing ones and forid<br>Wing ones from fand what we found is a<br>giant oh giant a five amino acid<br>deletion in there that differentiated<br>the full wi ones and the viid wing ones<br>and that happened at every single sample<br>and so we're reasonably confident that<br>this is what's causing the difference<br>when we looked at the central ataro ones<br>didn't seem to have that deletion but we<br>found one amino acid change that was<br>consistent across every single one so<br>that's across 30 proced Wing ones and 30<br>full Wing ones if you got an AA you got<br>full wings and if you got an S there you<br>got for CID wings so a for all your wing<br>s for short<br>wing and so that was really exciting so<br>it seems to suggest we have these shared<br>mutations underpinning Wing loss<br>in different regions they've sort of<br>come up with these different solutions<br>in fand we have one mutation in central<br>mutation and probably the way I think<br>about this is as Evolution at two time<br>frames um so you've got this ancient<br>Evolution this may be not ancient it<br>might have happened over 50,000 100,000<br>years ago or maybe a bit older than that<br>where this Vidal winged ecotype has um<br>evolved up in the mountains and spread<br>advantageous and then we have this<br>contemporary Evolution so<br>deforestation we see these guys turning<br>up again but in this case they're not<br>actually they're not Reinventing the<br>wheel they're not coming up with new<br>Solutions they're using this sort of<br>mutation that was developed a long time<br>ago for the alpine conditions and it's<br>com now becoming really useful in these<br>and so that's that's the wings what I'm<br>going to talk about now is<br>color um I'm going to give a little<br>disclaimer here please do not tweet<br>share this um we've just been this has<br>just been embargoed by quite a major<br>scientific journal um so enjoy this<br>forget about it for two weeks and when<br>nuts so again this is something that was<br>led by by Brady<br>Foster and so again we're looking at<br>exactly the same species of<br>stonefly as well as losing Wings it has<br>two different color<br>morphs so we've got this this uh a brown<br>color morph and we've got one which we<br>call a melanic<br>coloror so the question is why do we<br>have these two color<br>morphs so also in the environment we<br>have this guy here this is<br>ostr and when you look at it you can see<br>it looks almost identical to Z land PE<br>fastrada and so I got a picture of the<br>two on the fern there um in the field<br>you can't really tell them AP Park you<br>can tell ostop has slightly slightly<br>squarer slightly shorter<br>Tails um but really they look very<br>similar and so one thing you can also<br>notice as well as being black they have<br>some very distinctive color patterns so<br>on the forearm they've got a yellow and<br>on the shoulder they've got a really<br>white patch too I get in trouble with<br>entomologist by saying that insects have<br>forearms and shoulder<br>patches um and so I keep doing it to<br>mainly and so you guys will probably<br>actually recognize what this color PN is<br>you see it a lot in the insects and you<br>even see it in some frogs and some other<br>vertebrates and so this is warning<br>coloration and what we know about ostura<br>is it's actually toxic and so it's full<br>of cide it feeds on wood<br>and if you squish it smells like almonds<br>don't squish na of insects people um and<br>so what we think is happening is that<br>these at fenr are actually mimicking the<br>ostra and what's actually incredible is<br>this color pattern is even seen in some<br>vertebrates and some mamals so war in<br>coloration says stay away some people<br>don't<br>listen sorry I had to quickly transition<br>from that side<br>um I actually looked for a picture of<br>Chris CHR Chris luxen with the yellow<br>tie but he didn't have one David seamour<br>did have one but it was a bit slow to<br>put it on there um and so we were<br>interested in the stonefly color and so<br>what we did is we took photographs of<br>each of these and then from that we<br>looked at particular parts of it and we<br>derived a melan melanization index so<br>this is showing how melanic these things<br>are so looking at that that graph on the<br>minus 4 scale not very melanic further<br>further to the other side three or four<br>five they're very<br>melanic and then we can actually do<br>exactly the same thing with ostra and we<br>overlap uh and anything that overlapped<br>we could consider maybe a mimic anything<br>that doesn't overlap non-<br>mimic and so we were quite quite excited<br>about that but the question we kept<br>getting get kept getting is is it really<br>mimicry<br>um and what people were really trying to<br>say are are the birds actually avoiding<br>the melanic cander<br>peer our normal response was of course<br>it's mimicry just go out and look but<br>apparently reviewers don't accept that<br>as an<br>answer and so we actually had to to<br>demonstrate<br>this so our first thing we did was some<br>predation experiments so these uh Stone<br>flies they have been dead for many or<br>for several years they was stored in the<br>freezer um we got them out P them to a<br>tree and our plan was to see where the<br>birds eat them so we put a non- mimic<br>and a mimic beside each other and<br>hopefully the birds were going to avoid<br>the<br>mimics we put these out um walked away<br>for 20<br>minutes came back wasps were absolutely<br>all over them um several of them have<br>been decapitated<br>already um and so this wasn't going to<br>work<br>we went and talked to um a behavioral<br>entomologist in our<br>department um she was very excited that<br>the Wasps were eating them in fact she<br>asked for we were quite distraught at<br>this stage she asked for details about<br>how they ate them which part of the<br>brain they ate um but luckily she<br>actually came up with a solution for us<br>and that was play<br>models and so this is quite often used<br>in behavioral ecology and so what we did<br>is we made clay models of these things<br>we made them identical apart from one<br>was with made with brown clay and one<br>was made with black clay and then we set<br>them up as you can see on the other<br>photo beside each other on the streams<br>them and so yeah 50 peers and um and<br>then a couple of deforested a couple of<br>deforested sites and the good thing<br>about Clay is you don't need to set up<br>cameras because you you can actually see<br>whether the birds or other insects have<br>eaten them by the marks they leave um so<br>at the top we can see the sort of<br>typical marks youd get from a<br>bird quite direct quite often<br>triangular uh rodents have very<br>distinctive marks based on their teeth<br>and sometimes you'd find these little<br>insects and<br>so focusing mainly on the bird pration<br>because that's what we're interested in<br>in the<br>forests um about 25% of them had been<br>attacked within I think we s them up for<br>three days almost yeah a quarter of them<br>have been attacked in the forest of the<br>non- melanic ones and then the melanic<br>ones less than 5% so that's a<br>significant difference and so this seems<br>to suggest that birds are going for the<br>brown ones and not going for the melanic<br>ones which really supports our<br>argument we also set them up in<br>deforested areas as you expect<br>significantly less attack rate because<br>there's no not that many birds around<br>and as far as we could tell the birds<br>weren't really discriminating so the<br>birds probably didn't know that the<br>melenic ones were poisonous there which<br>is great in fact there was actually more<br>attack on the melanic ones and the non-<br>melanic ones outside the forest probably<br>because they stood out<br>more and so hopefully that's convinced<br>you it actually is<br>MRE um what again I was in is the<br>genetic basis of mimic so what's causing<br>the<br>mimicry as I said with the wing loss<br>stuff this can be quite hard it's been<br>many years on it um our first thing we<br>tried was genotyping by sequencing<br>approach so cutting up the genome um<br>comparing these regions across I think<br>it was 48 melanic and 48 non- melanic<br>ones and what we've got here is an<br>outlier scan all those black dots um<br>there's about 200,000 of them um are<br>showing regions of the genome that don't<br>differ between melanic and non melanic<br>and then we've got six regions that do<br>differ<br>um the one region that really stood out<br>is a gene called<br>ebony um as you can see here this is<br>known in dropa and it makes drop<br>mutations and it make drop<br>black so we managed to find that Gene<br>really easily so I think the moral of<br>the story there is either you need to<br>try for 10 years just keep trying or you<br>um as like would had it have it there<br>was also a seven base paer indel right<br>beside the snip and this indel seemed to<br>differentiate the melanic ones and the<br>non- melanic ones and this is really<br>useful for us because um collecting<br>stonefly NS is much easier than<br>collecting adults so you can go to the<br>stream and you can go get 100 200 NS<br>quite easily um to get that many adults<br>would take you 10 20 trips back to that<br>St<br>and in fact we what we normally do is we<br>get them as nymphs and then raise them<br>in the lab and so now we had this marker<br>that would actually tell us whether<br>things would be melanic or<br>not um so this is again looking at the<br>melanism index so that same melanism<br>index we looked at before but in this<br>case we've sorted them out by genotype<br>so everything with the lower Le um was<br>non melanic everything that was<br>heterozygous was almost certainly non<br>melanic and and everything with that<br>high almost everything was melanic and<br>so this seems to explain over 70% of the<br>color<br>variation what I was particularly<br>interested in when Brady was doing this<br>was the distribution of this mimicry and<br>so he always noted that mimicry only<br>seemed to be found at certain<br>sites and so when he was looking for for<br>example a population where he wanted to<br>get 48 of each he said well you've got<br>to go to the leaf you've got to go among<br>a to get it because it's the only place<br>where there's lots of<br>mimicry um so he looked at samples um<br>from across the Lower South Ireland<br>anything that had a mimic you can see is<br>covered in is marked with yellow<br>anything without mimicry is marked with<br>blue so you can see there's a lot more<br>places with blue than there are with<br>with<br>mimics um and what we didn't actually<br>notice is it seems to be associated with<br>forests which kind of makes sense when<br>we think about it so we know that ostera<br>the thing they're mimicking feeds on<br>wood that's how it makes it Cyanide and<br>it's particularly common in Forest but<br>then you go out of the forest it's quite<br>rare and so we would expect to see<br>exactly the same pattern without the<br>Lander pea mimics we would expect them<br>maybe to be common in the forest then<br>the moment you get out of the forest<br>they're going to be a bit more rare rare<br>for a couple of reasons one um they<br>stand out so that bright banding is<br>actually making them stand out and if<br>birds don't think they're poisonous<br>they're just standing out for no reason<br>and getting eaten and also we know that<br>melanic pigment is actually quite<br>expensive to produce so if you're going<br>to produce this all this melanism and<br>there's no benefit to it um it's just a<br>waste of waste of<br>resources and so this particular<br>research was L by Steven NE there this<br>was actually his honors<br>project um and as we can start making a<br>prediction like we did with the wings<br>what's going to happen when we get rid<br>of the<br>forest so let's say 800 years ago lots<br>of melanic ones as that Forest<br>disappears proportion of melenic ones<br>decreases and then when the forest's<br>gone the proportion of melenic ones<br>completely<br>disappears okay so we did some sampling<br>in different<br>streams U again Lower South Island this<br>is the best place to be sampling um we<br>did them from nice forested streams uh<br>if you look at that Map There's not that<br>much Forest but is actually sampling<br>from forest streams is very easy because<br>whenever there's a nice bit of forest do<br>kindly puts a nice track right through<br>the forest straight to the<br>streams sampling from deforested streams<br>on the other hand is actually a bit<br>harder um there's a lot of deforested<br>area but it's all being converted into<br>farmland and for some reason farmers<br>don't really like you scuffling around<br>streams and so again the first first<br>thing we did was some genotyping by<br>sequencing uh this is to look at the<br>relationships among the different<br>samples um and then among the melanic<br>ones and the non- melanic ones in each<br>each region so what we found is we<br>actually had four<br>subclades um sort of by<br>region and the important thing here is<br>also to note is we have mimics and non-<br>mimics within each<br>subate and looking at this there's no<br>real difference between the mimics and<br>ially and so we can actually have to<br>start to have a look at these streams<br>and so this these are two streams they 4<br>kilm apart um at Whiskey we found 50<br>over 50% of them were melanic and then<br>we go to deforested Stony<br>stream 20% of them melanic so quite a<br>quite a big um drop in melanism in that<br>deforested<br>area and here's another another pair<br>they're very close together chorus again<br>only a couple kilometers apart from<br>gilen at Claris about 40% of them are<br>melanic Gil felen 14% so almost a third<br>decrease<br>again and then we can look at that<br>across the whole of the Lower South<br>Island so on on that side we got the<br>deforested ones the key with that is<br>looking at the brown almost everything<br>is not melanic you go into the forest 30<br>40% seem to be<br>melanic um some of you will notice that<br>at the top there samples F1 and D1 seem<br>to have a lot of melanism including D1<br>which is um it's actually obscured there<br>on the thing but it's just below that no<br>tweeting sign um seems to be almost<br>fixed for mimicry and so these are two<br>samples at the Northern end of the range<br>so they're just north of the whitei<br>river um and when we look at them<br>genetically we actually find these are<br>completely fixed for melon<br>and this is actually a really important<br>point so what's happened is we assume<br>sometime in the past these things have<br>lost that brown oil they've become fixed<br>for melanism and now in the deforested<br>area they're still fixed for melanism<br>there's no genetic material for them to<br>work on so they can't actually shift the<br>do and then Steven put this through some<br>fancy stats um taking into account<br>latitude itude the relationship among<br>populations and this is basically<br>looking at the mimicry frequency across<br>these different<br>populations so in our deforested one<br>we've got a mimicry frequency of<br>typically about<br>10% we go to the forested ones always a<br>lot higher 30 40<br>50% um and then we got a summary overall<br>which suggests again yeah three-fold<br>reduction in the deforested<br>zones what you will notice is that even<br>in the forest in most cases um that<br>frequency sort of hofers somewhere<br>between 30% and 50% it doesn't seem to<br>get<br>fixed um and what we think's going on<br>there is some frequency dependent<br>selection so if that was at 100% and<br>these particular Stone flies were<br>significantly outnumbering the ostura<br>when a bird ate<br>it most of the time when a bird ate one<br>of these stoneflies it wouldn't actually<br>have any problems because it would be<br>eating these guys here which aren't<br>toxic and so the key is you don't<br>actually want to be outnumbering the M<br>the thing that you're mimicking you<br>don't want to be outnumbering the toxic<br>toxic model so that's why we think it's<br>it's not typically not at<br>100% um this is again looking at it with<br>that genetic marker exactly the same<br>thing as we found last time and it seems<br>to be that same mutation linked to<br>melanism across all<br>populations and again explaining about<br>and what we can actually look at because<br>we actually have some samples from<br>different know um time frames of<br>deforestation we can actually look at<br>the rate of of melanism loss with<br>deforestation and so on that x-axis we<br>have deforestation timing so this is<br>number of years before before present<br>when this deforestation happened and<br>then on that y AIS we have the frequency<br>of this eony mement so in green here<br>these are our currently Forest<br>sites so again at 40 to 70% um frequency<br>melanism uh we know some of these sites<br>were deforested during the initial<br>burning period so um Polynesian<br>burning and then we also have some sites<br>around for example theago Peninsula<br>which would have forested a bit more fre<br>recently so maybe only 150 years ago and<br>from that we can actually start<br>how quickly deforestation is causing the<br>shift in<br>mimicry and so we've got three lines<br>there these are from our three different<br>um subclades that we mentioned and what<br>we can see is there's very similar<br>Trends across all these different<br>subclades so no matter where you are if<br>you lose the forest you lose mimicry at<br>a reasonably consistent rate this is<br>about 1 to<br>generation and so what was really<br>exciting about this system is it's<br>actually quite a complex system<br>involving a whole lot of species<br>interactions so that first thing I<br>talked about with the wings we have<br>quite a simple thing you lose Forest<br>suddenly gets windy you lose your wings<br>this one we've actually got a whole lot<br>of things involved we've got Predators<br>we've got a a model and then we've got<br>the predators eating the model and we've<br>got a whole lot going on and so this<br>deforestation seems to completely break<br>up all these inter all these particular<br>relationships<br>and which then causes these this<br>melanism to<br>disappear um and so the reason this is<br>embargo this has just been accepted into<br>science about three days ago um so we're<br>obviously quite excited about it what<br>I've done here is I actually highlighted<br>there's ones involed Steven Gracie Brody<br>and Kaho are all students which is<br>really exciting um in the case of Steven<br>this was his honors project um Kaho was<br>doing summer project with us at the time<br>and this is his first paper so hopefully<br>here and so I'll just quickly finish up<br>looking at um potential future shifts<br>and so what I think was really cool<br>about the moth example that I mentioned<br>to start with is that we had a shift to<br>melanic moths and then as the pollution<br>disappeared we had a shift back in the<br>other<br>direction and so the question is will we<br>flers and this is quite a quite a big<br>question now because we've got huge<br>amounts of um forestry happening either<br>both we've got um planting of<br>plantations and then we've had this real<br>push over the last um 10 years to really<br>uh reforest with Native Forest so this<br>is work led by Kahu who's doing a um<br>honest project at the moment and if we<br>are to be believed the government has<br>27 100,000 I don't know million 627<br>million trees to be planted um over the<br>last um eight<br>years and so this is um some of the<br>sampling Kaho and I did at the start of<br>the year what we've got is two<br>photographs at two different dates uh<br>one is Robert Creek back in 1985 we did<br>not do sampling back in 1985 K who<br>wasn't born until about 20 years after<br>that<br>um what we did we just sampled in Robert<br>Creek in 2022 this is just south of<br>Queenstown uh the point of these two<br>photos is at the top we can see almost<br>everything is deforested apart from a<br>little bit of native Forest at the side<br>and then now there's been these<br>plantations and so there's been in the<br>last 30 40 years we've seen this change<br>from deforested Habitat to to this<br>Plantation and so then we looked at<br>those two aspects we looked at we looked<br>at melanism has that shifted and then we<br>looked at<br>wings so we looked at the frequency of<br>the Ean in the native Forest it was<br>about<br>40% we then looked at the deforested<br>area and obviously that's going to be<br>lower and it was higher okay so no shift<br>between the native forest and the<br>deforested<br>area why is that we're not quite sure um<br>we're looking at quite a small distance<br>between the forest and the and the<br>deforested area probably only a<br>kilometer and perhaps the birds are<br>actually flying across that area perhaps<br>there's G flow across the stone flies<br>across that area so we're not actually<br>seeing that drop that we've seen in<br>other<br>regions um Plantation doesn't change<br>either so let's let's try Wings maybe we<br>have some more Lake um in the native<br>Forest every single thing was winged<br>which was what we expect in Native<br>forests the forested area that's better<br>down to 25% so when you go into that<br>deforested zone most things have lost<br>their wings then we look at the<br>reforested<br>area starting to shoot back up again so<br>what it looks like is when you put this<br>Plantation in these things seem to be<br>gaining their wings and this is only<br>we're looking at probably 30 years we've<br>gone from 25% up to<br>70% and so this is very preliminary at<br>this stage um but it's something we're<br>going to keep exploring as we go and and<br>will be the focus over probably the next<br>couple years of<br>research um that's all I've got for now<br>so just thank you to University of atago<br>um for paying my salary and again to<br>Maren fund for paying my salary a few<br>acknowledgements here and again thank<br>you to Chrissy for inviting me Frank for<br>introducing me Joshua for sorting<br>you of questions<br>question hi great thank you um just<br>wondering for that Future Part that you<br>finished on do you have any access to<br>temporal samples like Museum samples<br>that would complement that work uh<br>unfortunately no so people don't tend to<br>collect well they collect Stone flies<br>but not in the numbers that we need um<br>so for a lot of these things you need 50<br>100 samples to actually to actually get<br>them um we've had one person in the<br>South Island Brian Patrick who's<br>collected samples um but generally it's<br>only been two or three samples per site<br>though and at a broader SP scale and for<br>that but yeah still looks pretty good<br>ringless forms other<br>questions um while you were collecting<br>the other information were there any<br>patterns associated with um the<br>generalized count and and um and size<br>differences of individual um Stone flies<br>between the the um forested and<br>deforested um<br>areas uh not something we've looked at<br>specifically um generally the generally<br>there is a size difference between the<br>full winged ones and the fal Wing ones<br>uh sometimes the fal Wing ones are much<br>smaller and sometimes they're much<br>larger um so whatever that means I I<br>don't<br>know yeah yeah they could be driven by<br>side conditions of temperatures and<br>things like probably independent CH you<br>a question<br>yeah so you're talking about obviously<br>with your wingless and winged it's a<br>genetic polymorphism of course one of<br>the other ways animals can kind of adapt<br>to new situations by through phenotypic<br>plasticity is there any examples of of<br>wing loss is it always a gen genetic<br>polymorphism or is it also a plastic a<br>conditional response it could very well<br>be plastic in some situations um so what<br>I'm focusing on here in particular is<br>the difference between the full Wing<br>ones and the procure Wing ones we also<br>have another form of wing loss which is<br>quite common where they're only not Wing<br>loss it's just Wing reduction and so it<br>might only be a 20% ring reduction up in<br>alpine conditions and I suspect that may<br>be more plastic um it doesn't seem to be<br>associated with the markers that we've<br>Charlie you got question um the<br>reviewers address this but um for the<br>I'm very curious about those um those<br>clay mimic um mimicry experiments<br>because birds are tetrachromats and<br>weird Tri uh is there is there a long<br>history of using clay as a way to to<br>replicate yes the answer is yes um um<br>yeah luckily there seems to be a lot of<br>um<br>lot of information a lot of papers<br>published in that um the paint we used<br>was a UV paint um that they always seem<br>to use um and so the birds they see that<br>UV and apparently it's it's very bright<br>for them so yeah they seemed happy with<br>it it's a good question though that<br>there's a lot of Pap where they've used<br>caterpillar<br>mimics done prod experiments been<br>published in science as well um I got a<br>question I got a few questions actually<br>so we're g to talk after lunch but um<br>um in the sub antic Islands I think<br>there's a few Stone flies that um are<br>wingless I'm just wondering if you guys<br>have had any you know thoughts about<br>investigating that because of course<br>that would be you know adaptation<br>towards windy conditions um but be<br>interesting to think about the<br>evolutionary history there you know when<br>they colonized and then SE lost in Wings<br>yeah so there was I mean Oakland Islands<br>there's about five species and the good<br>thing there is I think there's three<br>wingless ones and two that are winged um<br>I suspect that one of the winged ones<br>and the wingless ones are the same<br>species and so these sort of Studies<br>have a lot more power when you've<br>actually got these polymorphic species<br>um we've done some work on them all we<br>know is that they colonized those<br>islands five 10 million years ago and<br>haven't haven't had a chance to go down<br>there and have a look at them but they<br>would be quite cool yeah cool<br>just think about the obvious effects of<br>um wingless State wingless status on Jee<br>flow are you also interested in looking<br>at the interaction between like wingless<br>or wingless and other traits like the<br>melanism or some other traits yep yeah<br>definitely looking at those things and<br>so<br>um yeah it's kind of hard to work out<br>how these things are moving around if<br>they losing their wings um we suspect<br>it's probably an ancestral polymorphism<br>so something that's been in the<br>population for a number of years and is<br>spreading through initially we thought<br>through winged<br>hgot um but our last L of sequencing<br>every single<br>hetus um stonefly happen to be wingless<br>which yes it may actually be a dominant<br>mutation which makes it harder to<br>explain how it's spreading around but<br>yeah we'll definitely explore those sort<br>of things in the<br>future I think you might have something<br>so if you if you just kind of hover over<br>says just kind of hover over where it<br>says um you are screen<br>oh um yeah one last question just you<br>know the mimicry systems cool but so<br>complex you think about geographical<br>Mosaic theory of evolution and you how<br>there's different moving Parts there<br>with the clay models to G the sense of<br>the type of birds that were doing the<br>pration just because I think about you<br>know obviously our a form has taking<br>such a hit and such an impact of<br>invasive you know non-native mammals uh<br>with you know that adds another sort of<br>you know complicating factor into the<br>system you know yeah yeah so we don't<br>don't know at this stage um we're going<br>to set up some cameras cameras over<br>summer uh we suspect it's probably Paka<br>Waka as one of the major ones because<br>every time we went to the streams um to<br>put these clay models down they would<br>come down they would be interested in<br>what we're doing um possibly something<br>like New Zealand robins and some places<br>might be another good option yeah yeah<br>yeah okay yeah cool all right uh other<br>questions I think we'll another
