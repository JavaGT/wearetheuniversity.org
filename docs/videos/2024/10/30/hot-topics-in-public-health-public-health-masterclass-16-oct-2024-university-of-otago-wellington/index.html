medicine down in denen um and<br>it's my my pleasure to be the MC for for<br>this online master class we've got a a<br>great selection of presenters today<br>talking about a wide range of of topics<br>um across the spectrum of Public Health<br>and I think this is a great opportunity<br>to see some of the the diversity of the<br>things that we do in public health um<br>the format of the this webinar is that<br>uh we have a presentation from each of<br>our presenters lasting around 10 to 15<br>minutes um during that time you're<br>welcome to submit questions into the Q&amp;A<br>um that should be at the bottom of your<br>screen there um that we'll talk we'll uh<br>give to our presenters at the end of the<br>the session so when you if you're<br>putting in a question there please write<br>in your um who that question is um going<br>to be addressed to which of our speakers<br>uh you want to answer it um so that I<br>can put it on to the right person so<br>We'll have each speaker for 10 to 15<br>minutes and then at the end we'll have<br>the Q&amp;A session um which hopefully we'll<br>that um also just to let you know that<br>this session will be recorded um and<br>you'll be sent if you've registered then<br>you'll be sent a link to the recording<br>um to look at after the after the<br>session okay and uh with that I'd like<br>to to introduce our first Speaker who is<br>Rose crossing a senior lecturer in the<br>Department of Public Health at a Christ<br>Church campus and she's going to uh<br>present on what would a public health<br>approach to metamphetamine look like in<br>practice so thank you very much Rose<br>cool thanks everyone um so today we're<br>going to be talking starting off by<br>talking about<br>methamphetamine um so just to ground us<br>all methamp amine is a a strong<br>stimulant drug um you will sometimes<br>hear it called PE or ice and this is<br>methampetamine in its Crystal form but<br>it can also come as a powder the drug is<br>able to be swallowed but it is typically<br>smoked or injected and when people use<br>methamphetamine it can induce feelings<br>of euphoria and energy and alertness um<br>but on the negative side can also bring<br>on feelings of paranoia aggression and<br>hyperactivity and the effects can be<br>quite longlasting anywhere between 4 to<br>12 hours depending on the dose and on<br>the<br>person so um I guess the key message<br>really is there's really quite a lot of<br>methamphetamine in New Zealand so in the<br>last 12 months Customs have seized<br>almost 3,000 kilos but nevertheless<br>prices of meth continue to decline in<br>New Zealand and if we believe the laws<br>of supply and demand that would suggest<br>to us that there is still a high Supply<br>despite all the these SE me Wastewater<br>testing tells us how much<br>methamphetamine is being used in<br>particular regions in the first quarter<br>of<br>20204 uh there was an average of almost<br>18 kilos per week of methamphetamine<br>used in New Zealand but that's not<br>equitably distributed so there are<br>really um Stark Geographic differences<br>in the way in which methamphetamine is<br>used um and the New Zealand Health<br>survey data tells us that uh just over<br>1% of people aged uh 15 over in New<br>Zealand report having used<br>methamphetamine in the last 12 months<br>and so that works out to about 50,000<br>people um and again there are some<br>demographic differences with men more<br>likely to use methamphetamine than women<br>uh and people with disabilities more<br>likely to report using methamphetamine<br>than those that than those<br>without so methamphetamine is a class A<br>drug under the misuse of drugs act<br>getting caught with methamphetamine for<br>personal use or possession uh can have a<br>penalty of up to 6 months imprisonment<br>or a fine and Supply or manufacturer can<br>result in life imprisonment it's also<br>important to note that the utensils used<br>are also illegal so this is things like<br>the pipes used for smoking<br>methamphetamine um and in New Zealand<br>about half of all of our drug offenses<br>are related to<br>methamphetamine in<br>20221 there were almost 2,000<br>convictions for lowlevel offenses so<br>this is possession of the drug or<br>possession of utensils<br>and this is still occurring despite the<br>fact that we have what is called the<br>discretion Amendment and our misuse of<br>drugs act which says that police can uh<br>can charge someone with possession or<br>with low-level drug offenses if it is<br>required in the public interest so in<br>almost 2,000 cases in that year the<br>police decided it was in the public<br>interest to uh have a criminal penalty<br>for possession or utens or possession<br>what that works out to then is for<br>methamphetamine is that it's 50/50 if<br>someone is caught uh with for lowlevel<br>offenses La possession it's basically<br>50/50 as to whether or not there'll be<br>prosecution or whether or not there'll<br>be an alternative Justice response so<br>quite a high burden uh coming through<br>our our justice<br>system the uh National Drug intelligence<br>Bureau estimates that methamphetamine<br>harm cost New Zealand about $864 million<br>per year and we need to think about harm<br>in a way that is beyond just the effects<br>of the drug itself and a useful way of<br>thinking about harm is to start with<br>harms to self so this is harms to the<br>person using the drug this can include<br>medical consequences psychological harm<br>addictional dependence the loss of<br>relationships uh tangible losses through<br>potentially losing a job or being<br>imprisoned or uh you losing loss of<br>finances so these are harms that are to<br>the person who is using the drug but<br>it's also really important that we think<br>about harms to others and this isn't<br>just the people who are around the<br>person using the drug their fun now<br>their friends their family but it is<br>also about wider societal harm and the<br>harms to myth from methampetamine are<br>again really diverse this could be<br>things like injury perhaps um you know<br>there is a a car crash and the person<br>driving was affected by methamphetamine<br>but other people were injured there are<br>crime impacts um so obviously there is a<br>because it's a class air drug there is a<br>it is a black market supply so there is<br>crime associated with methampetamine<br>Supply and<br>manufacturer there is economic cost um<br>to our health system to our justice<br>system to policing to uh Community<br>Services harm occurring to family um and<br>through loss of relationships or family<br>disruption and really just damage to<br>communities and the way in which<br>communities break down um and can break<br>breakdown when a lot of people in that<br>Community are using<br>methamphetamine and this is from a study<br>that uh I published last year now which<br>is a way of objectively looking at harm<br>taking that broad definition of harm and<br>when we look at all of the uh a big list<br>of drugs across New Zealand both legal<br>and illegal you can see that<br>methamphetamine sits at number two um so<br>it's the second most harmful drug in New<br>Zealand after alcohol uh the harm is<br>roughly 50/50 between harms to self and<br>harms to others um and it is the most<br>harmful of the illegal drugs in New<br>Zealand but it's really important to<br>think about harm and where harm comes<br>from so some of those harms that we<br>talked about before are harms that occur<br>from using the drug itself so you know<br>from using methamphetamine can result in<br>cardiac problem so a direct harm arising<br>from the drug but there are also drug<br>polic see harms and some of these harms<br>are created by the fact that uh we are<br>in a Prohibition environment and this is<br>a really famous um famous diagram in<br>drug policy circles and what it tells us<br>is that harm is high at both ends of the<br>spectrum harm is high when we have<br>commercial promotion of a drug say for<br>instance like alcohol harm is also High<br>when we're in an ultr prohibition kind<br>of environment and that's where we are<br>with methamphetamine and other illegal<br>drugs in New Zealand and what we've<br>managed to do is Miss the mark both<br>times where strict legal regulation<br>results in lower harm and we've managed<br>to to overshoot it at both<br>sides so our national drug policy tells<br>us that minimizing harm is really<br>important doesn't actually mention the<br>word use it tells us that the the focus<br>should be on minimizing harm but the<br>misuse of drugs Act is very much focused<br>on preventing in use as a way of<br>preventing<br>harm in drug policy we often talk about<br>the three pillars so we have Supply<br>reduction so this is things that are<br>used to try and stop a drug from being<br>present so this might be Customs<br>policing prisons um you know seizures<br>effectively demand reduction and this<br>can be in this includes drug treatment<br>so for people who are using a drug and<br>who are trying to stop but it also<br>includes uh preventative measur so<br>things that stop people from initiating<br>drug use and harm reduction and this is<br>how programs that are intended to reduce<br>harm without necessarily requiring<br>abstinence so those are the three<br>pillars in practice however what we<br>really have is something that looks a<br>little bit more like this where Supply<br>reduction gets the focus of our drug<br>policy and all of its resources demand<br>reduction gets less and harm reduction<br>however what evidence we we should<br>really ask ourselves if we're interested<br>in evidence-based policy making what<br>evidence do we have that this current<br>approach to drug policy is working and<br>the answer is there is very little so<br>the<br>unodc uh tells us that Global Supply of<br>methamphetamine is near its highest<br>point on record so there were 367 tons<br>globally seized in 2022 this graph is of<br>seizures globally at the bottom and the<br>most recent year of data is the third<br>highest Global Supply on record data at<br>both population and individual level<br>tells us that criminal penalties has no<br>deterrent effect on people using the<br>drug and that countries with stringent<br>uh drug policies do not have lower<br>levels of use than countries with<br>liberal ones and the global Commission<br>on drug policy came out famously uh<br>quite recently and basically the<br>prohibition has failed to achieve its<br>goals whilst also resulting in harm so<br>that's Supply reduction not working if<br>we think about demand reduction so<br>particularly treatment we have no<br>effective pharmacological treatments and<br>the evidence for efficacy of the sort of<br>Psychosocial treatments for<br>methamphetamine uh is is relatively<br>mixed um there is no uh you there is no<br>kind of uh gold standard of treatment<br>for for methamphetamine dependence or<br>methamp mean harm so Supply reduction<br>isn't working demand reduction has mixed<br>evidence that's however where we're<br>putting our money so I beg the question<br>then if most of what we're doing isn't<br>working and in some cases may actually<br>be increasing harm we have to ask them<br>why do we keep doing it and what are our<br>Alternatives so the alternative is to<br>take a public health approach and<br>there's been some really great work<br>coming out recently um particularly from<br>Canada uh about defining what a public<br>health approach means in practice that<br>it would include harm reduction would<br>include regulation it takes into account<br>the determinance of Health it<br>encompasses treatment it encompasses<br>prevention and importantly it also<br>includes stigma reduction however what<br>it does not include is a criminal<br>justice approach to<br>drugs so what could this look like in<br>New Zealand there was um I was part of<br>an awesome came um a couple of years ago<br>in collaboration with the Helen Clark<br>foundation and the New Zealand drug<br>foundation and we published this report<br>called minimizing the harms from methan<br>Fain and we proposed different models<br>for how we could actually reduce harm<br>from meth in New Zealand the first thing<br>we need to look at is our drug laws<br>absolutely decriminalization would be a<br>step in the right direction but that<br>does not change anything about the<br>fundamental drug Supply or buying drugs<br>out of a black market so we can look<br>towards models of sensible Public Health<br>regulation and there's an excellent book<br>published from the UK from the<br>transformed drug policy Foundation that<br>gives us a blueprint to do this we need<br>to expand and fund programs like Tiara<br>aanga which was a Northland program that<br>tried to take a a more holistic view of<br>reducing methamphetamine harm that<br>encompassed people's uh overall harder<br>and well-being and looked at the ways in<br>which people could be supported to<br>reduce the methampetamine use we also<br>need to look for low barrier treatment<br>services and better funding of harm<br>reduction harm reduction itself is an<br>interesting concept because what it<br>refers to is all of the policies and<br>programs that aim to minimize the<br>consequences the harm of drug use<br>without actually requiring<br>abstinence it is grounded in human<br>rights and it's all of its criteria for<br>Success are about quality of life and<br>well-being and the provision of<br>non-judgmental non-coercive services<br>that incorporates and empowers the<br>voices of people who use drugs basically<br>home reduction services are about<br>meeting people where they're<br>at this could include things that we<br>already have but could be expanded like<br>needle exchange programs like drug<br>checking like safer drug use information<br>but we can also look to International<br>examples of how we could expand our harm<br>reduction offerings to include<br>supervised consumption facilities safer<br>smoking kits and safer Supply to try and<br>reduce harm as part of our overall drug<br>policy response<br>but to do that we're going to have to<br>overcome some really big barriers partly<br>due um really centered around stigma<br>reduction and the way in which we do<br>that is we need to engage with people<br>who have got lived and living experience<br>of methamphetamine use and harm build<br>Partnerships engage in dialogue bring<br>both evidence and values to bear and<br>advocate for political courage and for<br>political change but in doing that we<br>actually have to overcome some big<br>barriers in ourselves because we have<br>this kind of War on Drugs history that<br>is embedded within our psyche and to be<br>able to effectively reduce<br>methamphetamine harm using a public<br>health approach we have to challenge our<br>own narratives and our own<br>understandings about methamphetamine and<br>the people who use it thank you K rose<br>that was really really interesting thank<br>you so much for that presentation if<br>anyone we've got a couple of questions<br>in the the um Q&amp;A um but if you've got<br>any questions at all um again don't<br>hesitate to to throw them into the Q&amp;A<br>there and just put Rose's name on it so<br>we know who to to put put it towards<br>there um but we'll um we'll address<br>questions at the end of the the<br>seminar<br>um our next speaker is all the way from<br>Wellington in the virtual virtual world<br>um and as a senior liter at um in public<br>health the Department of Public Health<br>and the Wellington campus Janine St and<br>she's going to be presenting<br>onoo corero um the development of a<br>supportive care needs assessment tool<br>for vano Maru um experiencing cancer so<br>Jenny uh to first of all I'd like to m<br>to the timot foo and Foo participants in<br>our study I'm doing this up front just<br>in case we get short on time at the end<br>also want to m to the study Advisory<br>Group and the research team in<br>particular T Albert from man toodi<br>Bridget Robson and Dr Virginia signal<br>here at the University of Rago<br>Wellington um and also acknowledge that<br>uh the study to develop this Tool uh was<br>grant called Janine Ste TOA um so C<br>everybody my name is Janine steeman as<br>has been introduced I'm a senior<br>lecturer here in the<br>ENT Department of Public Health in piki<br>Wellington I GRE grew up here in um on<br>the lands of um out in the P area and<br>have worked in the health sector um all<br>of my life um like many of you no doubt<br>online I'm a mom sister auntie and have<br>been touched um more times than I'd like<br>um by cancer so thank you for joining us<br>today and uh listening to my<br>presentation about our study to develop<br>a supportive kid assessment tool<br>Mar uh so just a bit of background or<br> a papa on the project as everybody<br>knows cancer and chronic conditions uh<br>has a massive impact on people uh and<br>that we know that there are inequities<br>in for example survival<br>inequities um in some Cancers and some<br>of the reasons we know for those are<br>things like uh screening programs um not<br>reaching Marty the same maybe there's<br>Advanced disease at diagnosis maybe High<br>rates of comorbidity there might be<br>things like uh lower um or less optimal<br>access to cancer uh cure and um for<br>reasons perhaps related to things like<br>racism the design of our health system<br>all those kind of Big Ticket<br>items so when it comes to the person in<br>the Faro though assessment tools can be<br>useful to help um figure out what what<br>their needs are and what can be done to<br>help them while they're on that uh<br>path uh we do know that supportive care<br>needs for farom Mali um our knowledge of<br>that is growing but it's still limited<br>it can't be assumed and it may be<br>different for different people and may<br>change over time we also know that um<br>our uh indigenous um Foo over in<br>Australia gavi and Co have been<br>successful in developing a supportive K<br>needs assessment tool um for indigenous<br>Australians so uh the the FY or the M I<br>guess for that is been laid um and<br>through a prior study we did with some<br>Fano Mari um the need for some type of<br>assessment uh was identified in that<br>study called w a<br>corpal so that's the background to uh<br>why this study was<br>undertaken so the methodology uh we<br>embraced with our study was to take a<br>copaa Marti approach informed by Whitey<br>and particularly looking towards um<br>Marty rights to health and Health<br>Equity uh copaa Marty um and formed by<br>Graham Smith work um so Marty ways of<br>doing things<br>Customs led by Mari um and guided by<br>Mari principles like uh<br>k um face to face um Manar share and<br>host people and be generous those kind<br>of principles underpinned the study we<br>also sought expert advice um so Gail<br>Garvey who I just mentioned before was<br>um an advisor to the study also um Dr<br>Nina Scott um which many people who work<br>in the cancer space will no doubt be<br>aware of and um Community<br>Representatives like Cheryl Davies from<br>here so the objective of our study was<br>to develop a Marty specific supportive<br>care needs assessment tool by Marty um<br>by modifying sorry an existing<br>supportive care needs assessment tool so<br>similar to our Australian colleagues we<br>uh worked with the um<br>sf34 um the supportive care needs survey<br>short form so 34 questions were<br>contained within that survey that was<br>our starting point we undertook some<br>processes to modify that which I'll talk<br>about um next and uh we also wanted to<br>get stakeholder perceptions of how that<br>how tools might be optimally integrated<br>into practice so stakeholders consisted<br>of uh kayina um kahi uh cancer nurse<br>spaces so a little bit about who we<br>included in our study so we looked for a<br>diverse range of people from different<br>ewi Urban rural ages and stages in um<br>their treatment or cancer pathway so<br>some may have been survivors for<br>instance we focused on uh adults so 18<br>or old older um who had received a<br>cancer diagnosis and who were well<br>enough to participate recruitment uh<br>occurred primarily with the support of<br>uh timot uh which is a mar cancer<br>Support Program based here in the Hut<br>Valley uh networks with Mighty providers<br>uh dhb hospitals cancer networks and the<br>Cancer<br>Society so stage one we had three stages<br>to our study stage one uh we undertook<br>um semi-structured interviews with Marty<br>Faro and stakeholders uh and focus<br>groups and looked at the SF 34 in<br>particular and identified things that<br>people liked or uh didn't like then we<br>looked for concordance or discordance<br>between the Faro interviews and the<br>stakeholders and uh developed version<br>one of our tool we then took that out in<br>stage two to help us refine that again<br>with a separate uh well a different<br>group of fom Mari who had received a<br>cancer diagnosis and but the same um<br>same uh<br>stakeholders uh and then we took the<br>feedback from that to develop our second<br>version of the toour and then we took<br>that back to the stakeholder group again<br>uh for a final refinement and also to<br>develop up some instructions for people<br>who might uh use the tool um I will just<br>uh put these up because the study was<br>undertaken uh during Co so like uh many<br>studies it uh took a a bit longer than<br>um we would have liked or than we<br>initially planned um and so a couple of<br>our zooms with stakeholders uh sorry a<br>couple of our HW stakeholders were<br>undertaken via Zoom because we were in<br>course all right right so to give you an<br>example of some of the feedback we got<br>um through our different stages um<br>question one um was around pain and<br>there was concordance between K Mahi and<br>Foo around the importance of pain being<br>included uh that it might change for<br>people throughout their journey and it<br>was important to keep it near the top<br>and to ensure at the visit when the<br>assessment was being undertaken that<br>people's pain was that they weren't in<br>pain or that their pain was being uh<br>managed or in control and uh there was<br>also recommendations around wording of<br>uh some of those<br>questions uh questions 6 seven and 8 in<br>that uh hening AR space particularly<br>mental health<br>um Foo felt those words uh s made it<br>sound very serious and of course they<br>but um saw that it was potentially<br>leading towards a diagnosis and they<br>thought these kinds of feelings would be<br>normal actually uh as part of going<br>through the process of receiving a<br>cancer<br>diagnosis uh and kahi also thought that<br>uh Foo wouldn't like necessarily things<br>to be spoken about in such a way so<br>encouraged us to um merge those<br>Christian or or that co-a if you like<br>together um in the development of our<br>tool so in our toour we developed eight<br>um questions over eight domains um I'll<br>just pause a second to let you run your<br>eyes through<br>those um I will say we drew off um<br>obvious mod models of Health like bu<br>tapaa and the May Hunter<br>model there's two that come obviously to<br>here just move to our next slide uh so<br>stakeholder perceptions of how to<br>integrate such a tool uh was to be<br>mindful of the scope of practice of the<br>person who is using it so there could be<br>social workers nurses kayina um all<br>sorts of people might be able to use<br>such a tool that it was important uh to<br>take a relational practice approach so k<br>um to have a style about the person so<br>gentle kind flexible and<br>that which we ended up adopting as the<br>name of the tool um so for the people<br>administering the assessment to be using<br>the range of Senses they have rather<br>question the people who are using the<br>tools had knowledge of T Mari and were<br>able to pronounce the mighty words that<br>uh were being used in the tool and that<br>of course they were all over support<br>resources that were available in the<br>community they take a manner enhancing<br>approach but also on a practical level<br>mindful of it systems because they're<br>country there was also request for oral<br>and visual um approaches to be taken<br>with the<br>assessment here's an example of um how<br>the tool might be used so once the needs<br>been identified then an action plan<br>would be developed there's a<br>prioritization scale you'll see on the<br>left there so critical emergency might<br>be something requiring someone to call<br>an ambulance straight away maybe the<br>person's actually in quite a lot of<br>distress or unwell right through to<br>something minor like maybe The Lawns are<br>long and they need to be mowed but it's<br>not um a high priority in in this very<br>short space of time we also um in line<br>with the desire for manam or that<br>self-empowerment approach as well three<br>action levels so what could the foo the<br>person be doing what could the the<br>actual broader Foo be doing maybe they<br>could help mow The Lawns for instance<br>and what could services do could it be a<br>referral through to winds for support if<br>needed as an example<br>there so some points of differ for the<br>tool that we developed so obviously as<br>I've mentioned we drew off Marty models<br>of Health it's more of a community<br>focused um assessment tool the uh sf34<br>lend itself more to be used in the<br>clinical setting in a hospital uh<br>space uh I won't read through them all<br>um I will just mention T Marty there<br>given that's been quite topical in the<br>news uh in the last couple of days uh is<br>for T Mar to be used to open the space<br>so maybe kyoda might be how it's opened<br>and to take a participant lead uh will<br>reflective use of T from there on out uh<br>one thing we did do uh was wanted to<br>make sure that comorbidities were um<br>included in our tool given the number of<br>marifano who uh do have<br>multimorbidity and also uh addition or<br>grouping of what we called party par<br>sensitive topic so that might be around<br>sexual health and um those types of<br>topics we to next uh so we are in the<br>highlighted area here testing the tool<br>acceptability and feasibility with the<br>support of New Zealand Cancer Society<br>we've received funding to uh undertake<br>that next step for this toour thank you<br>caner<br>society and that is me for this session<br>k<br>and thank you so much for that<br>presentation it's it was really really<br>interesting and I think very important<br>work um and thank you to everyone who U<br>is providing their reactions there it's<br>really it's really lovely to to get the<br>response from the audience through your<br>your clips and um hearts and thumbs and<br>uh Venezuela<br>um I'm going to move on to now to our<br>next speaker and just remind people that<br>there's the Q&amp;A session at the end of<br>the the presentations where we'll um<br>address the questions you've given to us<br>in the Q&amp;A so keep them coming in and<br>let it make sure you you tag who it's<br>for now our next presenter is um Richard<br>Egan from the uh Department of PR<br>preventive and social medicine down in<br>uh denen he's also he's an associate<br>professor there and he's a um also the<br>co-director of the social and behavioral<br>Research Unit um and he's going to talk<br>about spirituality and Public Health<br>existing emerging or<br>Richard K Simon and Koto<br>Oto um thank you for coming along and uh<br>fantastic talks um thank you Rose and<br>Janine and not surprisingly it was<br>fabulous to see Janine that tool and um<br>and the inclusion of of spirituality so<br>I just like to acknowledge that<br>yeah so today I'm going to talk about uh<br>spirituality in the public health um<br>context which it often isn't and<br>uh I I'll answer my questions at the end<br>um today I'm my aim is to raise the<br>awareness of spirituality in widor um in<br>the within the scope of Public Health<br>and um health promotion and uh see how<br>it is a public health issue I'd like to<br>start with a a question that comes from<br>Trevor Hancock who's one of the the<br>Godfathers of both public health and uh<br>health promotion he say why do we create<br>a structure our society in such a way to<br>create ill health and is there way to<br>structure our society as to create<br>health and it's it's kind of one of<br>those questions that we think about in<br>health promotion particularly of how can<br>we create an environment where people<br>can be well and what might the place of<br>spirituality be in that and I'd just<br>like to sort of leave that as an<br>underpinning question if you think about<br>the scope of Public Health and health<br>promotion a definition we often use uh<br>comes<br>from uh from Winslow about this idea of<br>science and art of preventing disease<br>prolonging life and promoting Health uh<br>health promotion uh I'll talk about the<br>otwa charter later that's our definition<br>of of health promotion and then Fran<br>Barm talks about the new Public Health<br>which combines the best of epidemiology<br>and health promotion uh and talks about<br>a healthier Kinder world and one that we<br>can change as people so that's s the<br>scope of Public Health if you think<br>about the scope of spirituality I'd like<br>to present a uh what I call a conceptual<br>framework and it has these five elements<br>um first up is what is spirituality it's<br>that ubiquitous question then we<br>published a paper on this based on<br>hospice work there's a lot of work in in<br>spirituality that happens at end of life<br>and um the key components of of this one<br>were around beliefs values meaning and<br>purpose connectedness identity awareness<br>and for some people spirituality is seen<br>through a religious lens and notably we<br>said that this could be understood at an<br>individual or population level and<br>public health is about population level<br>approaches the most ubiquitous<br>definition in the spirituality in health<br>literature comes from pelski<br>and it's it's similar to ours though<br>it's probably broader talks about being<br>Dynamic and intrinsic uh including uh<br>the similar things around meaning and<br>purpose and trans<br>Transcendence and then through things<br>like self family others nature um<br>beliefs and values Etc so there are some<br>key definitions uh that are in the<br>public health and uh spirituality and<br>health<br>literature I'm part of an HRC project<br>looking that spirituality and healthc<br>care which I'll I'll mention briefly<br>later uh but uh associate professor<br>Moana woki and Dr hooker Eddie Valentine<br>have put together uh some work on<br>wer and uh they've said this uh<br>including and connecting to Marty<br>mazen's um uh talk about wua uh as being<br>the Ultimate Reality for Mari and about<br>the inherent sacredness uh to Mari<br>existence and I'm very careful to always<br>quote uh I guess Marty experts on this<br>area but I think it's a very important<br>area to consider so I want to uh mention<br>it<br>here a new area that's been published<br>recently and this comes from a 2024<br>article about spirituality is a<br>determent of Health um we published<br>something in a in a chapter in a book on<br>this but this was uh really a major<br>publication and I guess challenging the<br>Public Health Community to think about<br>uh spirituality not just as a dimension<br>of Health as I'll mention later but also<br>as a um a determinant um which is sort<br>of the causes of the causes and I think<br>that's something that uh there's a lot<br>more work to be<br>considered in terms of the second<br>component is the principles so um how we<br>how we understand health and um hold<br>impacts on uh how we practice so we have<br>heard about tapar already kyota Mason<br>jewelry the hospice framework uses that<br>similar model the fontal faray and many<br>of the other pafic models use this and<br>then there this one's from oncology in<br>the Netherlands all of them can aining<br>spirituality as domain a dimension a<br>component of that so that that has a<br>huge impact on how we understand<br>Health in terms of the evidence uh<br>there's a growing body of evidence in<br>fact there's 70,000 plus peer-reviewed<br>Publications on spirituality religion<br>and health outcomes and one of the best<br>ones came from this um excellent uh<br>article um in Jama the Journal of<br>American Medical Association a very high<br>impact journal and the the key things<br>here are that that spiritual is<br>important to most people with serious<br>illness in fact fact in our New Zealand<br>national study we found that 69% of<br>people at end of life wanted spiritual<br>care so it's frequently desired it<br>influences decision making however it's<br>frequently unaddressed so this was a<br>review article across the world um in<br>2022 um and it it is associated with<br>Better Health outcomes so the the<br>research is<br>suggesting and here's a whole lot of<br>areas which I won't go through I just<br>wanted to show you that there's many<br>areas uh that have had study in the in<br>spirituality uh that it has an impact so<br>when spiritual care is considered it has<br>an impact on these areas the Canadian<br>study was an interesting one this was<br>another review most of these are review<br>articles but it said that religion and<br>spirituality influence Health behaviors<br>and as a health promoter I particularly<br>interested in that because we don't talk<br>about spirituality u in the causal<br>pathway and our understanding and our<br>needs analysis and planning for health<br>promotion programs<br>much um the evidence is such that it's<br>now impacting policy these are a whole<br>range of guidelines the two on the right<br>are Australia left ones in Scotland uh<br>New Zealand and America and the Ministry<br>of Health guidelines on support of care<br>and and cancer um suggested that um we<br>should consider spiritual needs of<br>people with cancer I can tell you this<br>is just this is aspirational it<br>continues to to be aspirational in the<br>recent um uh strategies that came out<br>the end of the labor government's term<br>there's five strategies and almost all<br>of them had something about spirituality<br>the overall health strategy uh the whole<br>order Mary strategy and the Pacific<br>Health strategy which I particularly<br>like where it says not only Pacific<br>peoples but all parts of the health<br>system to Value physical mental and<br>spiritual<br>well-being and then there's some<br>surprising places that spirituality<br>comes up in policy treasury now has a<br>what calls a y order framework and at<br>the center of this framework of<br>well-being uh is WIA at the center of<br>the health equality and safety<br>commission uh framework is Wu<br>Tonga and if we think about a good death<br>which is something that we don't talk<br>enough about in public health because we<br>all die we talk about how to how to<br>prevent death a lot but actually we're<br>all going to die and part of our work is<br>thinking about how we can die as well as<br>possible<br>and it's very good work from The gretan<br>Institute in Australia it's talking<br>about the importance of access to<br>spiritual care and emotional<br>support the fourth component is the<br>Zeitgeist and this is the idea of why<br>are we talking about spirituality now um<br>in sort of a a postmodern post-religious<br>um age uh I think one in New Zealand is<br>because of people like Su Mason jury<br>Valentine Etc about the importance of<br>spirituality the fact that we now are<br>largely um becoming less and less<br>religious uh we have this idea of this<br>long dying um and what what's replacing<br>spirituality and also there's some<br>interesting work on the de dispirited<br>Health Care<br>Workforce and then finally this concept<br>of the numinous and and this is the the<br>idea of um spiritual religious or<br>inspiring moments that happen in all<br>sorts of ways different for different<br>people uh there's research on this<br>around blue space Green Space you know<br>that um connection with land connection<br>with sea um and connection with a so if<br>you like those are the five components<br>of the U conceptual framework that's<br>what we're talking about with<br>spirituality but if we come back to<br>Public Health so this 20 years after the<br>Ottawa Charter the Bangkok Charter um<br>emphasized mental and spiritual<br>promotion oh sorry I'm on the wrong<br>slide this is the this is the the public<br>health um uh<br>slide so the Bangkok child 20 years<br>later emphasized spiritual<br>well-being um in health promotion in New<br>Zealand when when we talk about it and<br>teach it we talk about the two Poe of<br>health promotion one is the ud Char the<br>other is Titi and of late there's been<br>more discussion of the Wu aanga or the<br>oral health um article or the oral<br>article of uh<br>TTI uh which may be understood as<br>honoring and uh considering uh<br>spirituality so I think even within the<br>first three articles the the ones we<br>know best uh there's argument that<br>spirituality is a component of<br>those then if we think about the otwa<br>charter I think there's five strands of<br>the Ottawa chter that many of you will<br>know I think in each of those strands we<br>could consider the place of spirituality<br>in healthy public policy in many I've<br>already showed there are many examples<br>of spirituality there so but how do we<br>operationalize and develop it create and<br>support environments um advocating for<br>environments that allow Spirit spiritual<br>flourishing I think could be part of<br>Health promoter work and strengthening<br>Community Action enabling communities to<br>name their identities beliefs values<br>these are critical components of<br>understanding communities and working<br>with<br>communities developing personal skills<br>um thinking about healthy choices we<br>talk about making healthy choices the<br>the Easy Choice what about considering<br>spiritual skills and spiritual literacy<br>about 80% of new zealanders are not<br>actively religious and yet they arguably<br>have spiritual needs so where does that<br>spiritual literacy come from and then<br>finally working with our colleagues who<br>get 98% of the health budget um thinking<br>about what what about thinking about a<br>whole person person- centered approaches<br>and where does spirituality need to be<br>addressed uh within a dominant medical<br>model mostly in um health promotion we<br>often talk about these four things<br>smoking alcohol and drug misuse and<br>abuse nutrition and obesity and physical<br>activity um and I think there's a quite<br>rightly we think about these things<br>considering that they they're so<br>important the causal pathway of things<br>like cancer and heart disease however we<br>don't talk much about the place of<br>spirituality both in the research and in<br>the<br>interventions so I think spirituality um<br>may be uh uh a particularly important<br>component in public health research and<br>uh and practice without it we're not<br>seeing the whole picture we're not<br>understanding perhaps the current and<br>the future terrain and missing both a<br>determinant and a dimension of<br>well-being and as many many in the the<br>literature on spirituality and public<br>health has said that we're ignoring a<br>lever for societal<br>well-be finally i' just like to to a<br>plug for a project that we're looking at<br>the<br>um this is a a big HRC funded Health<br>delivery project uh it's it's a national<br>project where we're looking to um<br>understand spiritual care uh map<br>spiritual care and work with um ewi and<br>stakeholders to improve spiritual care<br>uh into the future for the 21st century<br>we're doing virtual hooie and face<br>to-face hooie and a range of other<br>projects uh love to um have your<br>contribution uh we've got a website<br>um spir spiritual wellbeing. NZ it's got<br>a whole lot of um information there and<br>also opportunities for you to to um have<br>input into<br>this so<br>finally spirituality in public health I<br>asked the question does it exist yes I<br>think it's inevitably part of our own<br>implicit positioning is it emerging I<br>think yes also it's increasingly part of<br>our research agenda and practice is it<br>ignored I think unfortunately yes up<br>until recently but this is changing<br>increasingly it's part of our<br>definitions our determinant our evidence<br>Yoda y Richard thank you very much for<br>that it's um and thank you uh for for<br>all your acknowledgement um I'd like to<br>just acknowledge our three speakers um<br>for them fantastic presentations showing<br>some of the the breadth of uh what we do<br>in public health across across the<br>country so now we have uh the the Q&amp;A uh<br>session um and i' um again encourage you<br>if you've got any questions to to fire<br>them into the Q&amp;A you can just sneak one<br>in um before we before we close I'm<br>going to um open it up with uh with rose<br>to start with<br>and looking at some of the the questions<br>we've we've got here for Rose um so a<br>couple of the questions were looking at<br>um the use of uh meth and and Pregnant<br>and lactating woman and you know uh what<br>are some of the impacts on the on<br>children and um on children's<br>development from<br>there thank you that's a really<br>important point and I'm so glad that<br>people raised it um so the short answer<br>is is yes so meth in use during<br>pregnancy and lactation can have quite<br>significant impacts um on the on the<br>baby um these can include things like<br>pre-term birth uh low birth weight um<br>there is the potential for a a baby to<br>experience withdrawal if use has been<br>heavy in the in the close kind of leadup<br>to birth um so experience withdrawal<br>symptoms um and it can also have quite<br>significant impacts on brain development<br>and behavior so it is a significant<br>issue our data on this in New Zealand at<br>a population level is exceedingly poor<br>um so we don't have decent uh that's a<br>general comment about our drug use uh<br>population level data actually it's it's<br>really bad the most recent um good data<br>set we've got is from 20072 2008 which<br>is simply not good enough so it is a<br>problem it is a significant problem as<br>to the magnitude of that problem I can't<br>answer the important thing I'd like to<br>say I think about this is that to me<br>that is exactly the issue you know the<br>type of issue that reinforces for me the<br>need to take a public health approach if<br>we think about things like um we want<br>women who are pregnant to be able to<br>seek help from their Healthcare<br>Providers why would they do that if they<br>feel like they're going to be<br>stigmatized or shamed or criminalized so<br>you know that whole aspect of stigma<br>reduction becomes really important<br>because we want people to be seeking<br>help when they seek help we want them to<br>have access to appropriate Services we<br>we can't tell people oh yeah that's<br>great that you're seeking help wait two<br>months please or you're going to need to<br>travel 3 hours please like we need<br>services that are low barrier to entry<br>and are appropriate um for New Zealand<br>and for its context so a super important<br>public health issue but one that to me<br>really reinforces why a public health<br>awesome thank you um I'm just going to<br>move on to to Janine now move it around<br>a bit<br>um so we have a question here um do you<br>see this tool is being um used by<br>Primary Health Care Professionals and if<br>so would this include primary health<br>conditions with limited knowledge of<br>tari or ter<br>Mari uh cure a good question uh I guess<br>what I would um hope that over time we<br>would get to is that it would be able to<br>be used by a range of different health<br>professionals including in that Primary<br>Care<br>setting um regardless of the health<br>professional I think that K be careful<br>um Do no harm is an important element uh<br>that we want to be taken with the use of<br>this tool so um thus the training the<br>identifying uh the identification of<br>some training to be able to use this<br>tool<br>um so that would require as we we're<br>still in the process of developing up<br>what that training might look like<br>and how formal that might be um but<br>knowledge of T Marti and Tel Marti would<br>be a requirement of that I also do as<br>with one of my other hats um uh teach<br>how Mar to fourth and fifth year medical<br>students and I would say that uh the<br>training of medical students and thus<br>our future medical Workforce definitely<br>in includes some use of toel and how and<br>Marty so I think the workforce is<br>changing that is coming through um yeah<br>so that would be my response to that<br>question<br>ker K thank you Janine um now one for<br>Richard spinning him around<br>um is the Ministry of Health currently<br>active on operationalizing spiritual<br>health across either health promotion to<br>to the health<br>system I think the short answer is<br>no um there are pockets of it happening<br>uh you know Janine gave us a very good<br>example of it happening in research and<br>supportive care for<br>Mali uh Mali providers around the<br>country Healthy Communities for example<br>I know in South ockland you know they<br>use a Wier focused approach so there's<br>parts that it happens but there there<br>isn't a consistent approach uh and I<br>think that's something that still needs<br>to happen so there's still work to be<br>done<br>um I'm just going to cycle through again<br>just quickly um a couple more questions<br>um well so back to Rose<br>um and I guess uh in terms of overcoming<br>barriers and how do we factor in you<br>other those barriers be it things like<br>gangs or government policy or so on and<br>um also there's another question which<br>kind of along a similar theme um but<br>relating it to um current um proposed<br>oxide yeah um so I<br>guess the the the issue of gangs is an<br>important one right and it's a it's a<br>function and part of the fact that we<br>have a black market right so if we have<br>a if have a black market and drugs then<br>that comes with uh it comes with crime<br>and social harm that exists because of<br>our drug policy settings not necessarily<br>because of drug that drug per se so I<br>think it's really important to kind of<br>consider um this idea of of what some<br>people call legalization but I think<br>that that kind of has connotations that<br>are that are unhelpful to people but<br>this idea of of regulation of of strict<br>Public Health government kind of<br>controlled regulation of a drug as a way<br>of overcoming um overcoming a black<br>market and Gang Related crime and harm<br>because certainly you know drug drug is<br>drugs are a significant source of profit<br>for gangs in New Zealand um you know and<br>the there was a question that came in<br>about nitrous oxide and the recent<br>decision that was made um to make it<br>harder to get and it comes back to that<br>same question of what we don't want to<br>do under any circumstances is create a<br>black market in drugs that's it is<br>unhelpful to do so and we lose control<br>of it once there is a Black Market<br>involved and it creates more harm um you<br>know I think I'm very much publicly on<br>record saying that I disagree with the<br>the recent changes to the way in which<br>um nitrous oxide is being regulated<br>because it has relatively low amounts of<br>harm um and therefore a harm reduction<br>approach would be far more appropriate<br>um and we could look at ways to try and<br>reduce harm through things like bit age<br>controls or not selling the really large<br>canister or harm reduction advice to<br>people using it without taking an<br>approach that is very kind of<br>heavy-handed and has the potential to uh<br>create a black market and then cause<br>harm in terms of overcoming barriers<br>that's the million dooll question right<br>like um drugs is one just one of those<br>topics that is politically seemingly<br>very scary and intractable um and we<br>just we have to keep trying through<br>those methods that we talked about<br>through bringing both values and<br>evidence to bear and through ongoing<br>dialogue um and through challenging<br>stigma wherever we see it um because<br>change happens very very slow but then<br>very fast and I'm just waiting there for<br>the the moment where the change is going<br>fast thank thank you Rose I was just<br>going to fire one um over to Janine now<br>um regarding um uh the approach that<br>you've you've suggested and how um it<br>may place a lot of expectations on on<br>nurses and doctors and public hospitals<br>where there's there's already a lot of<br>stressful overwork in that y thanks for<br>that um good point um I do want to just<br>acknowledge that our health sector is um<br>definitely and the people obviously who<br>working in it stretched and stressed but<br>nonetheless do a pretty amazing job I<br>think um the although my presentation<br>went through quite quickly but this tool<br>is particularly developed for using the<br>community setting um acknowledging that<br>that sf34 tool that we built it off was<br>Prim primarily focused in the hospital<br>seting so we've developed ours more for<br>use in the community seting we often<br>there's a bit more time to develop<br>relationships it might take more than<br>one visit for instance to work through<br>the toll if all the chrans if um<br>someone's in quite a lot of pain for<br>instance it might be a priority to<br>actually sort that out in the first<br>instance with that person<br>um yeah so more Community uh focused uh<br>use of the tool rather than hospital<br>setting<br>SCA um I just want to squeeze in one<br>more for for Richard to keep it all<br>balanced um before we we wrap it wrap it<br>up and it was um again it was about the<br>um Hospital context and spirituality<br>support in that um because it's often<br>limited to just from chaplain so what<br>more could be how could we do more to um<br>professional development for clinical<br>staff well in the last 5 years we've<br>been teaching uh spiritual care in the<br>clinic to medical students we're now<br>teaching it in second third and fourth<br>year it happens through whole Mari as<br>well I'd like to acknowledge Janine and<br>Co um so our future doctors will know<br>one how to do potentially spiritual care<br>history taking uh and the big thing is<br>how know how and when to refer on to<br>spiritual care experts are<br>chaplain um in connection to that there<br>was a question about I love this word<br>spiritual imperialis imperialism um I<br>think that's an important component you<br>know that that frostz doesn't happen U I<br>have a whole section in my teaching<br>about the ethics of spiritual care uh<br>just like other areas of medicine and<br>health for nurses and doctors he other<br>Healthcare professionals it must be done<br>in with in beautifully ethically ethical<br>ways cuz you you're talking about<br>dealing with the essence of a person uh<br>so therefore um your own beliefs cannot<br>be um projected on people it's about uh<br>go thank thank you Richard and um I just<br>want to it reminds me for me really to<br>um just thank our panelists um for such<br>interesting and and a diverse range of<br>topics that they've covered but I think<br>it really captures the the idea that<br>public health should be should challenge<br>us to do better and to challenge the way<br>we think about things already um so I<br>think you've seen some excellent<br>examples of that that here<br>today<br>um if this is of um you know stoked the<br>fires of of interest in you and you're<br>you want to learn more um we do offer um<br>Public Health courses at at the<br>University of atago<br>so you can see there I've put up a quick<br>slide showing that um so we have a range<br>of postgraduate um courses available um<br>across across the country in Christ<br>Church needen Wellington there's a range<br>of papers and it's a very flexible um<br>program that allows you to to follow<br>your your passion and your interest it's<br>um and you can see here just again some<br>of the range of the things that we do um<br>so follow the link there Google us do we<br>still Google is it now do we you chat<br>gbt or Bing or whatever your verb is um<br>to find us on the the internet Google<br>stalk our presenters to find out more<br>about what they do um and again please<br>show a a round of applause um virtual<br>Applause for our our<br>presenters and um thank you so much for<br>for coming along and uh sharing this<br>this time with us and um engaging in<br>what we we we love to do okay take care<br>everyone stay safe</p></main><footer style="margin-top: 2rem;
