special<br>occasion to celebrate the promotion of<br>sun young M to professor at the<br>University of<br>atago these lectures are a highlight of<br>my week as I'm sure they are of many of<br>yours they're a wonderful opportunity<br>for us to come together and celebrate<br>our new professors and hear them talk<br>about their personal Journeys their<br>research platform and the impact their<br>research has had on<br>others I'd like to welcome colleagues<br>and<br>students and friends from across the<br>university and Beyond including those<br>joining us by live stream this evening I<br>would also like to give a special<br>welcome to Professor Mar's family who<br>are with us here in person this evening<br>including her mother and I think her<br>sister who's here as well thank<br>you uh it's not easy to become a<br>professor at the University of atago in<br>order to be Pro promoted to that level<br>candidates need to show that they are<br>outstanding in each of three<br>categories teaching research and service<br>Professor Mah has clearly met these<br>criteria<br>it is an honor and a privilege to<br>congratulate her tonight for that<br>outstanding achievement and I hope you<br>join me now in doing exactly the same<br>and I I just want to tell you if I<br>wasn't holding this microphone I would<br>be clapping very hard right now so<br>thank you and I hope you'll take every<br>opportunity to do more of that this<br>evening the primary focus of Professor<br>Mar's research is to find the most<br>effective and efficient way to improve<br>the oral quality of life for patients<br>needing a tooth<br>replacement I must confess I myself am<br>uh Midway through a tooth replacement<br>right now so I can't tell you from<br>personal experience how grateful I am<br>for your research and engagement uh in<br>this area uh so thank you thank you very<br>much Professor Mar's presentation will<br>take you through her 15-year Journey as<br>a a as a a professional and specialist<br>Pro I'm going to get this wrong<br>prosthodontist in<br>Academia she will reflect on the impact<br>of her research on patience on the<br>profession more broadly on her teaching<br>and most important Ely honor her<br>students but before she does that I'll<br>hand you over to Professor Carl Lions<br>the acine dean of the faculty of uh<br>Dentistry to formally introduce<br>professor marah and give you a little<br>more detail about her professional and<br>you uh Koto coal<br>takua uh it's my very great pleasure uh<br>to be here this evening uh on behalf of<br>Professor Paul Cooper uh who gives his<br>apologies and for not being able to be<br>here and sends his very best wishes to<br>congratulations it's also my very great<br>uh pleasure and privilege to introduce<br>Professor sang ma uh sang on this very<br>special occasion<br>it's also really good to see Sun Young's<br>mother<br>here thank you for all that you've done<br>and for giving us sang uh for so much of<br>her time here at the<br>faculty and I'm sorry that uh Sang's<br>today um but I'm sure that they would<br>very much have enjoyed Sun Young's<br>presentation and also to celebrate your<br>as Professor Brock said it's an<br>extremely rigorous process that assesses<br>an individuals academic achievements as<br>a leader in three areas teaching<br>research and contribution to community<br>and<br>profession I've known Sun young for many<br>years and we're both specialists in the<br>same discipline uh which is pronic<br>Dental Specialty which among other<br>things replaces missing teeth and<br>missing tissues with uh substitutes made<br>from different<br>materials outstanding is the word to<br>describe Sun young and her<br>achievements as a teacher sang has<br>taught every Dental student who's<br>graduated from otago in the last 15<br>years she's also had a lead role in<br>teaching postgraduate students<br>particularly students specializing in<br>proston as well as students specializing<br>in any and other areas especially the<br>surgical disciplines involved with<br>Sun Young's LED curriculum development<br>at undergraduate and postgraduate levels<br>and the quality of her teaching has this<br>year been recognized by the university<br>who have awarded her a university of<br>otago award for excellence and<br>teaching as a researcher Sun young has<br>over a 100 Publications including<br>referee Journal articles book chapters<br>and Conference<br>proceedings Sun Young led research at<br>both the undergraduate and postgraduate<br>levels as on a number of Journal<br>editorial boards has supervised 14<br>doctoral students many many BDS BDS<br>honors and summer students ship projects<br>it's been awarded over half a million<br>dollars in research grants and has three<br>times been awarded the S John wal<br>Research Institute supervisor of the<br>Year<br>award Sun Young's also been awarded a<br>Global Research award by the<br>International Association for dental<br>research recognizing her research in the<br>research within the university sang has<br>a number of leadership roles including<br>associate Dee postgraduate in the<br>faculty of<br>dentistry and has on numerous committees<br>within the faculty and the division in<br>the profession Sun Young's been an<br>external examiner for graduate programs<br>in pronic around Australia as well as in<br>Malaysia she is a dentist member of the<br>health practitioner a disciplinary<br>tribunal in New Zealand as a past<br>president of the New Zealand Association<br>of proston and restorative dentists and<br>is only the second New Zealand<br>prosthodontist to be president of the<br>peak Professional Organization for<br>prosthodontics in Australia the Academy<br>of Australian and New Zealand<br>prontis congratulations S Young on all<br>you've achieved and on your promotion to<br>Professor now to introduce Sang's IPL s<br>is going to show us as a dental<br>prostodoncia and<br>titanium and has also LED research on<br>other tooth replacement options designed<br>and produced using digital<br>Technologies primary focus of sun<br>Young's research has been as Stuart said<br>to find our ways to improve oral health<br>related quality of life for patients<br>needing replacement of teeth and again<br>as sang said as Bri as Stuart said<br>Sang's presentation will take us through<br>her 15-year Journey as a specialist<br>proston in<br>Academia very much looking forward to<br>Sang's presentation and I'd like to<br>invite you to take the stage and present<br>your inaugural professorial lectur son<br>congratulations and thank<br>you uh thank you st and thank you Kyle<br>for the kind introduction um this<br>evening and thank you everyone for<br>coming today I'm very surprised to see<br>so many people here<br>um I promise myself that I won't get too<br>emotional at the beginning I'm already<br>emotional as it is so thank you very<br>much for um attending my IPL and special<br>thank you to my mom who's here and my<br>sister who'll be watching from Zoom um<br>today so I'm going to take you through a<br>little journey of my 40 something years<br>of my lifetime and 15 years um as a<br>specialist prothodontist<br>so I'm from Korea um I'm sure everybody<br>knows where Korea is this is me being<br>born only 100 days old my mom told me<br>not to put this one on because I don't<br>look that great on the photo<br>apparently uh with a little bit of a<br>hair sticking up like this um probably<br>not a best look for my students<br>hopefully they're not taking any<br>screenshot of<br>this and then my beautiful my beautiful<br>mom um holding me in the Prem and me as<br>a little child um um listening to an<br>instruction that if you ever get lost to<br>stay put and don't run around like a<br>little crazy kid<br>and so I spent my childhood in Korea and<br>um I'm a big sister to Heron my si uh my<br>younger<br>sister and I finished my primary school<br>which goes for six years in Korea and<br>then moved to Christ Church in New<br>Zealand so my family moved to New<br>Zealand in mid<br>1994 um it was a big change moving from<br>Korea to New Zealand well one there is a<br>big language barrier we didn't really<br>speak much English I probably knew the<br>alphabets that's probably it um my<br>family did very well sessioning into<br>Christ Church um there was a quite a<br>good Korean community in Kasher which<br>helped us a lot as well I started my<br>high school in ker so I went to rang<br>Rural High School um girls high school<br>in cres I think maybe a couple of the um<br>audience here might be an alumni from<br>the high<br>school um I learned English as a<br>beginner um had to go to a second class<br>to learn um English as a second language<br>person I was quite glad that at least U<br>mathematics and chemistry there's a<br>universal language so I didn't have to<br>learn<br>that after I finished my um High School<br>in 1999 and my students I'm sure be<br>quite surprised I was born in 20th<br>century<br>I finished my birthy and this came<br>through then we turned um we were moving<br>into the new century and there was a big<br>ho about the Y 2K that the computer is<br>going to crash down and we might go back<br>to<br>1900s uh obviously that did not happen<br>because I made it to otago in<br>2000 they didn't quite get my name right<br>because there was a space between son<br>and yang and they thought son was my<br>first name Young must be my middle name<br>well it's<br>it's not<br>true and when we are moving<br>to to danan um I heard this news um on<br>the radio that government has finally<br>decided that they were going to cut the<br>tuition fees down for the in so what a<br>great time to do the industry in 21st<br>century so I started my Health Sciences<br>first year um probably the hardest time<br>all my lifetime doing um Health Sciences<br>at otago I pretty much lived at St David<br>lecture theater and spent pretty much<br>morning and night in science Library it<br>was pretty cold it was quite a bad<br>Heating and of course I was very<br>stressed but thankfully after a whole<br>year of hard work I got few mails in the<br>letter box so this is how we used to get<br>the um<br>results so now we didn't rely on<br>internet or I'm not sure how the<br>students find out these days but um we<br>got bunch of envelopes if you got more<br>than one obvious you got into more than<br>one um health professional programs I<br>got multiple and one of them was um<br>Dentistry so I was very<br>happy I think my mom told me that um<br>that was her happiest uh moment of her<br>lifetime you know second to me being<br>born of<br>course um that she always wanted um me<br>to be in some kind of health<br>professional um<br>career so I started my danry journey in<br>2001 you'll notice that this fure that<br>has been taken it's actually taken in<br>1993 so this is um based on the Korean<br>way of reading the dates so year uh<br>month and then the day so back in 1993<br>we happened to come to New Zealand for a<br>little trip so this is before we moved<br>to New Zealand um and we happen to go<br>past the University of tago D school and<br>funny enough I had a photo taken in<br>front of it so I have this feeling that<br>my mom had this all planned out for her<br>um which I didn't know about obviously<br>um and thankfully I did get in otherwise<br>it would have been a horrendous um<br>problem so I made it to the dental<br>school in<br>2001 so my BDS Journey started in 2001<br>with 61 wonderful um<br>classmates uh we got along really well<br>we had a wonderful time in four years at<br>the dental school we were um very well<br>looked after by Paul Pierce and B Alti<br>um Paul had to help me in my second year<br>because I didn't know how to finish a<br>custom tray finally left I now I know<br>how to do it and I teach my students how<br>to make those um so I was very very um<br>well looked after when I was at the<br>dental school and I I can't thank enough<br>all the Das the reception stuff and the<br>academic stuff that helped me throughout<br>my four<br>years I was taught by Professor Brian<br>Monte um I looked everywhere trying to<br>find his photo but unfortunately I<br>couldn't find one and if you do um<br>remember Professor monted you recognize<br>his special signature that he used to<br>use and I did have a copy of that so I<br>after the industry so I graduated on<br>time<br>thankfully and just like everybody else<br>did half my classmate went to Australia<br>so I followed the sunshine going from<br>the needan to Sunshine Coast um finding<br>my first job as a general dentist in a<br>hospital working for Queensland<br>Government after about a year of this I<br>prob probably had enough vitamin D so I<br>moved on to Sydney which was as hot as<br>Queensland I must say and I spent<br>approximately 6 months in the Sydney<br>resident in Sydney um I met this<br>wonderful man um Bill serson who is a<br>pronti um who who has now retired from<br>Sydney Dent hospital he taught me pretty<br>much everything about wax up he had a<br>beautiful two uh a pair of hands that um<br>could do anything and everything and<br>when I told him that I got into um dein<br>PRS at Taro he gave me a handmade um set<br>of tee that he made out of different<br>colored acrylic resin so I'm very much<br>thankful for bill for all the wonderful<br>skills that he has shed me when I was<br>there for 6<br>months after approximately 2 years of<br>spending in Australia I thought there<br>was time to move to<br>denan so I traded in the sunshine and I<br>moved to um denan again and that's how<br>my three years um of Journey of becoming<br>a specialist Pro<br>started I'm sure this um I'm sure<br>everyone can agree who is specializing<br>in um prothodontics or any other<br>discipline Deon then certainly is not an<br>easy Journey but hopefully it is a<br>wonderful Journey for<br>everyone so this slide is dedicated to<br>my mom because I sometimes wonder if she<br>actually understands or knows what I'm<br>doing at school she knows that I'm not<br>an<br>orthodontist um I try to explain to her<br>but I think after about five minutes or<br>me trying to explain about the industry<br>she probably gets a bit sick of it and<br>um probably turns away a little so this<br>is just an example of what you can<br>achieve and decline the prothodontics<br>not just um full m rehab all the time<br>but improving someone's life and<br>changing someone's lives um for better<br>function Aesthetics um<br>Etc I had wonderful um teachers along<br>the way during my three years of the<br>program one of whom is who<br>here um Sergio definitely showed me how<br>to be practical in my um professional<br>life he I've learned how to not say<br>anything too stupid when he gave me the<br>very long stare which I later found out<br>after my graduation that it doesn't mean<br>that I have to say anything he's<br>actually thinking<br>um I had other um teachers like alen<br>Payne D Pon<br>carons uh who have taught me through my<br>undergraduate degree as well as my<br>post-graduate<br>degree I think everyone will agree that<br>when you are doing your declin program<br>that you can't um possibly do your<br>clinical work without the support of<br>your dental<br>assistant um I had a wonderful three<br>years of En Cooper who sadly has now<br>passed away and I I have to say I don't<br>think I would have been able to do my<br>DEC condem Without<br>End um she looked after me my entire<br>three years checked up me um at<br>lunchtime to make sure that I was eating<br>I have other people doing that now still<br>uh fed me before my second patient came<br>through in my afternoon um fed me<br>cordial to make sure that I wasn't going<br>did one of the reasons why I chose to do<br>prothodontics is because of the um<br>wonderful experience that I had in my<br>removable pronic so sometimes my<br>students ask me why did you choose to do<br>pronic and I sometimes wonder what<br>there's a rhetorical question because<br>why could how could you not love pronic<br>you're changing someone's lives for the<br>better I love the r r PR for the fact<br>that you could actually talk to your<br>patient while you doing the the<br>treatment for them because a lot of the<br>these patients sometimes are unable to<br>um wear what you make for them um<br>potentially because of the some of the<br>changes that happened after they lose<br>their teeth so when they come with a bag<br>of dentes that they couldn't wear before<br>you sometimes wonder can I actually do a<br>time so in the '90s um dental implants<br>became very popular for a dous patient<br>patients with notate to be able to um<br>help them along the way so that they get<br>better retention and the support and<br>these are some of the examples of the<br>tiny little meal structur that can give<br>Journey when the patients are provided<br>with dental implants um some of the<br>comments that you get often they say<br>that they can eat apples they can eat<br>any tough meat and they can function and<br>enjoy the lifetime just like anybody<br>else<br>for a patient like this at the very<br>bottom that she said that last time when<br>she went swimming in the open ocean she<br>actually lost her dentures and after she<br>got her implant she actually is able to<br>wear her teeth again without having to<br>worry all the time that she's going to<br>um having to go down to the bottom of<br>teeth so that led me to doing my decent<br>um thises looking at whether the bone<br>levels around Mula to and over dangerous<br>actually stayed um stable over long<br>term so these are some of the examples<br>of attachment systems that you can use<br>and provide for your patient and<br>sometimes there is a question as to<br>whether the rigidity of these implant<br>attachment may affect the level of the<br>implants and the findings that I had of<br>through um looking at the radioraps and<br>to see the changes that happened over 10<br>years it showed that no matter um what<br>kind of loading protocol you do for your<br>mandula andov danger the long-term<br>stability actually did not<br>matter this gave me um a wonderful<br>opportunity to be able to publish in the<br>international Journal of prothodontics<br>and also gave me my first exposure in<br>the international platform so I went to<br>the ICP which is the International<br>College of prontis where I presented my<br>research data and this is the first time<br>that I met um pronti from around the<br>world so I'm there very thankful for the<br>supervision that I get I I gained from<br>Alan Mari and also Andrew who joined at<br>time so deant just wasn't wasn't just<br>about doing research or seeing patience<br>all the time but we also had great time<br>as a group um I had wonderful three<br>other classmates that went through de<br>them with me in pronic and other<br>discipline um friends that we got along<br>really well the multidisciplinary<br>treatment planning and um working<br>Journey so after declining graduation I<br>had my bags all packed up ready to go<br>back to Australia until<br>somebody asked<br>me if I will<br>stay I wasn't quite sure about that<br>option um but as you can see the final<br>outcome of this um conversation that I<br>did stay in otago and that's um that was<br>my first year starting as a senior<br>protonics so I've been incredibly lucky<br>with my career that um even though New<br>Zealand seems very far from rest of the<br>world it gave me a lot of opportunities<br>to be able to go around the world<br>visiting other people presenting my<br>research and make a new friendship with<br>I think one of the first um interaction<br>that I had other than the ICB um<br>conference I had in South Africa was<br>actually attending the igp CRA workshop<br>for young pontic Educators so the person<br>at the bottom um that's Professor Jo Zab<br>who gave me a lot of inspiration to be<br>able to work as a pronti and he was the<br>one that set up the igp um YP Workshop<br>so this is where we um gather together<br>people around about the same age or<br>about in the same um time of their<br>career to be able to talk about some of<br>the journeys that they're going through<br>and some of the um goals that they may<br>have that they like to share<br>together so I really enjoyed this time<br>to be able to um share our experiences<br>together and make our new<br>friendship I was also very lucky to be<br>invited at the Academy of pronic B by Dr<br>stre CER who I also met at the YP<br>workshop and they gave me another um<br>inspiration and um encouragement to be<br>internationally so some of the other<br>research that I've been involved in is<br>looking at the attachment systems that<br>we use um for the maxilla so<br>traditionally for the maxillary implant<br>over dentes uh we tend to provide at<br>least four implants to be able to<br>support a removable processis for This<br>research um we have actually dropped the<br>number of implants into three so it<br>gives them gives the patient less um<br>burden in terms of the surgical<br>morbility as well as the financial um<br>commitment so the 10year data that we<br>collected we looked at the the surgical<br>placement and how um successful it was<br>in terms of the implant<br>stability as well as the pronic outcome<br>and the outcomes that we saw over 10<br>years was that the narrow implants that<br>we use for the maxilla on the idential<br>maxilla was um possible to be able to<br>support a Max denter without the P<br>support so that the so that now you are<br>able to give the patient Back The Taste<br>sensation and possibility of reducing<br>the bulk of the acrylic<br>resin you'll see that there's two<br>different types of attachment system<br>that we use one is a splinter version at<br>the at the top where you have two bars<br>connecting three implants and the three<br>um single<br>attachments um we are very happy to see<br>that both of them work very well for our<br>patient and especially for a single<br>attachments where you can reduce the<br>cost down for the patients as well so<br>this could be one of the um ways forward<br>to be able to provide patients who are<br>unable to adapt with the max denter by<br>so the question is what kind of<br>attachment system should we be offering<br>to our patients so that you are keeping<br>up with the protic success the<br>maintenance should be kept lowy for our<br>patients and at the end of the day it<br>this is about the patient satisfaction<br>preference so Studies have shown that<br>there are multiple different types of<br>attachment systems available for<br>patients and this was um published some<br>time ago so I'm I'm sure since then<br>there's been multiple different um types<br>available now especially with the cat<br>Canam being available some of the things<br>that you can buil in House at the same<br>time so our study have shown that with<br>the cochron review that we did in terms<br>of which type of attachment system is<br>most effective for connecting implants<br>to denta um just like a lot of the<br>studies that we saw um previously that<br>sometimes there's not enough um evidence<br>to be able to determine which one is<br>better than the other and I I'm suppose<br>this gives you another reason to<br>research sometimes research um gives you<br>opportunity to push the boundary a<br>little bit at the same time whether it's<br>going to be a positive result or<br>negative result you don't know till<br>you've done it and one of the research<br>that we've been involved is zonia<br>implants at o Tigo where we um have used<br>a one piece of cona to be able to assess<br>the impact of with using mitual So-Cal<br>meal free implants can be alternative<br>option and there have be multiple um<br>researchers involved in this including<br>pain I have to admit that um One Piece<br>implant is not the easy want to deal<br>with in terms of from the procontic<br>perspective that you are somewhat stuck<br>with the type of the patries or the<br>matrices that you're using and sometimes<br>if the patrix start to wear and it's<br>gone beyond um the repairability this<br>could be um quite a limiting factor for<br>zonia implants so we've concluded that<br>with this type of research or with this<br>type of treatment modality that unless<br>the patient has been proven to be<br>allergic to Titanium maybe it's a con<br>implant is not the first choice but a<br>second<br>choice so I've talked about patients<br>where um missing all the teeth what<br>about missing just a one front Toth<br>because this is something that you very<br>commonly see and into practice and<br>especially with the ACC um this could be<br>a question that you should be able to<br>answer for your patients as<br>well so when you are dealing with<br>patients with single missing Toth on the<br>front<br>part sometimes you'll see quite a bit of<br>resorption or changes that happen as the<br>bone heals around the area so socket<br>shrinks in and the mucosa start to<br>shrink<br>inwards so sometimes a patient may be<br>able maybe able to see the changes<br>that's occurring as the bone is moving<br>inwards and sometime you might see a big<br>recession that happens as the bone is<br>shrinking away from where the tooth used<br>to<br>be so if you going to answer another<br>question what's better than doing<br>another degree so I've embarked on my<br>PhD I still sometimes wonder why I did<br>that um especially if you are working a<br>full-time academic as well um obviously<br>Saturday and Sunday Kind of counts as a<br>working time um so PhD it took me a long<br>time to be able to complete this while I<br>was working full-time um but I'm great<br>that I'm very very grateful that um that<br>I was able to complete<br>this so as part of my PhD um what we<br>looked at was using a different type of<br>implant to be able to um restore the<br>single missing tooth on the interior<br>section or the single missing tooth on<br>the front part of the tooth so you'll<br>see that with this kind of implant<br>called um Southern Coe AIS what they've<br>done is rather than just following the<br>um shape or the direction of the implant<br>they actually converted by another 12<br>degrees so that the implant axis is now<br>or the screw axis is quite different<br>from the implant axis so this gives you<br>an opportunity to be able to move the<br>screw Channel which is where you put the<br>screw in so that you are connecting the<br>implant Crown to the titanium implant um<br>away from the visible area which will be<br>um aesthetically<br>unpleasing so we follow this patient for<br>5 years and to see where the Tilted<br>implants could be placed immediately<br>after the extraction of an front tooth<br>followed by Rehabilitation of allery<br>crown to be able to provide our patient<br>results so from this um we found that<br>the 12 degree platform switch of the<br>implant was definitely a good W to be<br>able to restore a patient that needed an<br>immediate tooth replacement and the the<br>zonia apart was also a successful option<br>to be able to provide a patient with<br>aesthetically demanding<br>cases uh I'd like to thank all my<br>supervisors um PhD is not easy for both<br>the students and the supervisors I'm<br>sure um I went<br>through two different supervisors so<br>Mike Swain was my first primary<br>supervisor but unfortunately he moved on<br>to another University see um Jules keer<br>um unfortunately passed away suddenly<br>and so I lost my second supervisor along<br>the way I think by that happened um I<br>think none of the Academia atago wanted<br>to be my supervisor<br>anymore<br>H but Allison Rich um stepped in so I I<br>am very thankful for her support that<br>she gave me throughout my PhD journey<br>and obviously work um St on as my<br>supervisor throughout my so many years<br>of my PhD as<br>well part of my PhD because it was a<br>clinical um trial I have to thank my um<br>wonderful detal assistant Janice she<br>helped me along the way to be able to<br>collect all these data and it's not easy<br>um having to do clinical trial at the<br>dental school bringing patients um to be<br>able to make sure that they're going to<br>come to the appointment have all the<br>setups done so that um you are able to<br>collect all the data on time so I'm very<br>thankful to Janice for the support that<br>me so that gave me opportunity to be<br>invited to uh another conference um that<br>was just signing up as part of the noble<br>bu care so they set up what's called<br>foundation for or Rehabilitation where<br>they invited three um young prontis or<br>periodontist who came to talk about um<br>some of the different modalities that<br>they could provide for patients with<br>missing<br>too I learned a lot um as part of being<br>the foundation for or Rehabilitation one<br>different types of presentation skills I<br>learned from different um very<br>well-known lectures and some of the tips<br>and advice that I got given from the<br>way research um yes it's a lot of hard<br>work and sometimes you wonder why doing<br>that because some maybe seeing a patient<br>or um teaching might be more fun way of<br>spending time research sometimes can be<br>quite lonely and you wonder whether<br>you'll make it to the end but I am very<br>glad that I've done both my decl and PhD<br>because it gave me opportunities to um<br>see the around the world um I never<br>thought they'll be invited to speak at a<br>big meetings at International platforms<br>or or uh meet other people who think<br>like me or to be able to support me<br>career um I want to thank um one of my<br>mentors um that are they I have um so<br>this is Professor jar which I mentioned<br>earlier um he's been a great um support<br>throughout my career who has shown me<br>that um you can do anything if you set<br>your mind to it and this is um one of<br>the editorial that he put up in the igp<br>when he was the editor and chief to show<br>that women in pronic that they could do<br>a good job as well as the men in<br>pronic<br>um sometimes Pros could be quite M<br>dominated area um it's starting to<br>change of course but this gives another<br>um platform where the women are shining<br>through to show that um pronic um can<br>definitely always also be something that<br>well as part of my um research Journey<br>um as sure mentioned it's not just about<br>research but also leadership skills that<br>you have to learn um and develop<br>throughout your career um s Koka<br>developed what's called f Future Leaders<br>in procontic also known as flip uh where<br>he invited um young pron wantest to be<br>able to join the group and share some of<br>the knowledge and learn about something<br>different from just the everyday<br>Dentistry or Pro dontics so I'm very<br>grateful for the opportunity that I got<br>Workshop so digital dentistry and imp<br>plans it definitely is an exciting time<br>in protonics um digital Dentistry to be<br>honest didn't really exist when I did my<br>decline Dent um program we still took<br>the um we didn't have any cbct that we<br>were using to be able to plan the um<br>implant treatment if I say that now to<br>my post grade you don't need cbct<br>they'll probably laugh at me like is she<br>joking is she from 20th century well I<br>am but things have developed so much<br>that it's sometimes quite a hard um job<br>with so with the development of digital<br>dentistry and also some very um<br>wonderful and hardworking students I met<br>along the way in my career they given me<br>the opportunity to be able to use this<br>as part of my research projects so<br>clearine and celest um they were one of<br>my elective students that worked on how<br>well undergr students are able to use<br>intro scanners um Gloria and Jessica<br>worked on the 3D printing of the cat cam<br>materials for the ders and Louisa who<br>also worked on the cat cam Milling units<br>and how well it Mills for zonia<br>materials so these are some of the<br>opportunities that my students gave me<br>and also the experience that they allow<br>me so that I can<br>enjoy using the teaching as part of my<br>research<br>Journey other students um along the way<br>that I met um three boys up here they<br>did a great job um presenting at the<br>okra um showing the um differences in<br>the impression materials that they could<br>use and how that impacted on the um<br>models that they get out of it zou um<br>really blew my mind that he worked so<br>hard um trying to pretty much um learned<br>everything about implant treatment<br>planning software and he did a great job<br>winning the iadr competition both in New<br>Zealand as well as the AZ<br>Division I think your proud this moment<br>comes when your student presents um at<br>an International Conference that you<br>also once presented when you first um<br>finish your de Journey so Abit here um<br>he was a decent student who graduate a<br>couple years ago now a lecturer at um<br>Jordan University of Science and<br>Technology he presented did he he did<br>such a great job that I thought I was<br>listening to a a professional lecturer<br>um and he presented his research on the<br>denter of course there are other areas<br>that I've been also interested in other<br>than cat Cam and implants um sometimes<br>the students may come with different<br>ideas that they like to pursue and I'm<br>very H very glad that I took that um<br>chance and opportunity and learn about<br>different areas of the industry not just<br>about drilling and filling but also um<br>some of the areas that that my students<br>may be interested in and of course it's<br>time so this is uh Meg chin um who was<br>one of my first Deon students who did<br>research under me um she worked<br>incredibly hard probably lived at the<br>dental school day and night um I just<br>wondered why she was even paying rent at<br>her place because I saw her all the time<br>at the dental school instead um I think<br>definitely hard work pays off because<br>when she um submitted her manuscript for<br>her declin and thesis or part of the<br>decl and thesis this was the comment<br>that I got from the editor-in chief so<br>although it's got my name at the bottom<br>because I was a corresponding author I<br>must say all the um hard work was done<br>by Maggie to show that no Corrections<br>were needed for her um manuscript that<br>she submitted so what a wonderful time<br>um and the experience I had um working<br>with Maggie and supervising her um to be<br>able to achieve this kind of level at<br>deing<br>students um I have to say my passion<br>in research is still within the clinical<br>trials that run with uh patients whether<br>they are missing just one Toth or<br>multiple teeth um clinical trials is not<br>always easy especially because it is<br>very patient dependent and I think<br>Claren can definitely um agree to that<br>she spent hours um trying to find our<br>participants so that they can come and<br>sometimes might even bribe them with the<br>if here so that they are going to attend<br>their year one recall uh so this is our<br>current research that we're doing at the<br>moment where we are looking at using a<br>small diameter implant to replace the<br>posterior tooth or back tooth so that<br>you don't have to um graph the area to<br>be able to put a much larger implant<br>which is at the moment a normal practice<br>so with this research we are currently<br>working with our colleague um M AA at<br>Dubai uh Morman used to be the senior<br>lecturer here at otago he got another<br>opportunity and moved on to Dubai but we<br>continued um our connection between<br>otago and his new um place and I very um<br>excited to see that we are almost<br>reaching our year1 D here at otago as<br>well so M has shown that with his group<br>in Dubai that um all of his implants and<br>the crown survived whether you use a<br>regular diameter or narrow diameter<br>implants in the posterior tooth and<br>there was no differences in terms of the<br>impant success and the periodontal<br>outcome um they've had multiple<br>procontic maintenance issues um for our<br>otago research although we are just<br>about to finish our year one data I have<br>to say the protic maintenance issue was<br>much fewer here with the we had a better<br>Pro<br>inago I thought<br>no I better wipe that on my YouTube um<br>recording but it will be very exciting<br>time when we both join our data together<br>to be able to publish in an<br>international<br>level so moment is still very active um<br>in terms of research and it was great to<br>see him in Singapore for the ITI<br>conference where he um presented his<br>preliminary data um for the Dubai group<br>um I did a very quick um data<br>presentation in Malaysia when I was<br>examining the Malaysian students for D<br>clent um and then hopefully we'll be<br>doing something together as a combined<br>um<br>effort so I have to say a lot of thank<br>yous to people who have helped me<br>throughout my 15 years at Oto and that's<br>not including my de in time or BDS time<br>old these are some of my colleagues that<br>I met and helped me through uh my<br>journey as 15 years of academic um I<br>spent a lot of time looking for photos<br>on social media so I stalk everybody<br>like as if there was no tomorrow some<br>pictures were so fuzzy I didn't know<br>what to do with them and I had to ask<br>somebody which will who will name will<br>remain nameless to go and get other<br>photos so that I could put something<br>together today so thank you for um all<br>the support that you've given me I am<br>forever grateful for all the time that<br>you spend listening to my<br>complaints and I I want to thank all the<br>um members at the South surg which we<br>used to have back in the old school um<br>where I used to treat our<br>patients Janise um and Cooper um Elvie I<br>couldn't find her photo so she's not<br>there um thank you so much for all the<br>support that you give me so that I could<br>continue with my cono<br>practice um the bottom photo is our<br>regular group although we haven't quite<br>met regularly this year um we do go out<br>for dinner now and then the B cluther<br>group one's right there<br>um it's nice to see our friends outside<br>the dental school to be able to talk<br>again and I want to thank my family at<br>lond Street specialist um I started<br>working at lond Street specialist um<br>approximately about two and a half years<br>ago and I've never looked back and it's<br>been just a wonderful wonderful time<br>spending time with me Mary Jane who um<br>reminds me different things like<br>paperwork and Pauline who I'm sure<br>sometimes wonder what is she doing with<br>the patient that's not how Sergio does<br>it and for Sergio who trusted me to work<br>at his practice so what a journey I've<br>had um at London Street especially<br>because I used to go in as a student<br>when I was a deant I went back as a<br>patient to see Chris Robertson to do my<br>braces again and now I work there and<br>well um<br>I I have to thank all my um protist um<br>friends both in New Zealand and<br>Australia<br>um this is these boys groups are such a<br>wonderful people that I work with and<br>balce ideas of each other to be able to<br>support our Network um and to be proud<br>of um protist in austral Asia who can<br>also do a great job um internationally<br>so thank you to the New Zealand<br>azp my ICP friends um who I met along<br>the way um starting from 2009 so I've<br>been to ICP pretty much every time<br>there's been a conference we meet each<br>other every two years um although we<br>don't see each other that often every<br>two years we see them it's almost like<br>we just met them yesterday and what a<br>wonderful friendship that I've gained<br>and I always trash um treasure this um<br>until I finish my career as a<br>prothodontist so thank you to all my um<br>great friends at the ICP these are some<br>of the people that um supported me<br>throughout my career and one of them is<br>here bernades thank you um I mentioned<br>him multiple times already in my<br>presentation he has given me strength<br>when I needed the most throughout my<br>career um working at University most of<br>time it is very enjoyable and wonderful<br>time but there are also some ups and<br>downs that I'm sure everybody will agree<br>so George definitely has given me some<br>strength um as I went through my 15<br>years Journey as a prothodontist<br>uh my second thank goes to Sri Coker um<br>he has opened so many doors for me to be<br>able to um attend and present at<br>different platforms and that has given<br>me the opportunity um for the<br>international exposure so thank you s<br>for such wonderful opportunity you give<br>far uh I went through so many photos<br>that I've taken um I'm sure I'm missing<br>quite a few students like um K said that<br>I taught I don't know probably<br>approximately 1500 students since I<br>started working at OT tiger I couldn't<br>possibly put 1500 students in one slide<br>these are some of my very few that um<br>I've<br>included I couldn't have done my job<br>without the student support that they've<br>given me um some of the unexpected days<br>and surprises that sometimes I wonder<br>how that even eventuates but they<br>definitely keeps me they definitely keep<br>me young and contemporary learning new<br>language from them like slay this and<br>slay that um I'm not sure how they even<br>started but I'm definitely keeping young<br>while I'm um at the University teaching<br>undergraduate<br>students and if I did miss you out on<br>the fire Choice hopefully the wall of<br>all the thank you cards that I received<br>from my student could do the Justice um<br>for the students who may be watching on<br>Zoom<br>uh these are three of my um closest<br>friends that I went through my Dew so<br>the first one right next to me is Conant<br>L who is also protist the other two um<br>are doing pontist um work and of course<br>Rohan who wasn't quite made it to the<br>photo um every year we see each other um<br>and talk about the good old otago times<br>and it's great to see otago alumni um<br>doing really well um across the ditch<br>Australia and<br>finally because I'm sure everyone's<br>wondering how many other people are you<br>going to thank now you<br>one um I want to thank my grandfather<br>who passed away um before<br>Co I um he I I loved him very much when<br>he was alive and I still love him very<br>much and even on his very last day he<br>asked me if I was doing okay in New<br>Zealand and I'm very grateful that he<br>remembered me until the last<br>day um I want to thank my mom oh my God<br>I'm crying a little<br>bit I want to thank my mom um she's<br>probably the strongest woman that I know<br>in the world um she puts up with me all<br>the time coming back home talking about<br>D and dental school for at least an<br>hour she's wondering when I'm going to<br>go back and do some work now um thank<br>you Mom for everything you've done<br>you've sacrificed so much so that I can<br>be here on this day um being promoted to<br>Professor my sister couldn't be<br>here um I did tell her to watch on Zoom<br>whether she is doing I don't I'm not<br>sure because younger sister never<br>listens to older<br>sister but if she is<br>watching um I'm not sure if I'm that<br>nice to her but I'm sure I am you know<br>but thank you so much for attending my<br>IPL today and um hopefully I'll be here<br>for the next now they 15<br>years<br>so what an act to follow um Co War T um<br>I'm uh professor at the the school I<br>lucky enough to have worked with sun<br>young now for um about 15 years uh and<br>I've got a couple of things I want to<br>briefly say and then I get the really<br>good bit of of thanking her for her<br>presentation um firstly I think uh<br>whilst I take your point about seeing<br>your student graduate it's also possible<br>the most proudest day of your life is<br>the day you see one of your colleagues<br>who was a student become a professor in<br>the same place you became a professor so<br>um that makes me emotional so very very<br>proud um fantastic what a what an<br>amazing<br>journey um the second thing I was going<br>to say so I I knew S young as a as a<br>postgraduate student but really we<br>didn't start to work together until one<br>of our PhD students lost one of her<br>supervisors and in a meeting um we were<br>desperately trying to find someone to<br>help her sonang was a junior staff<br>member she put her hand up she said I'll<br>do it and it wasn't easy um and I<br>learned something about Sun young then<br>and that is that she is somebody who<br>puts her hand up when others are often<br>sitting on their hands she'll put her<br>hand up to do hard stuff and when she<br>sees a student or a patient who's in<br>trouble she'll put her hand out to help<br>them she'll also remind them how lucky<br>they are to get her<br>help and how tired he is because she<br>works very hard and in fact in some ways<br>you're the architecture of your own<br>demise because you are known as the to<br>go to when you need help you're somebody<br>who will do things and I think that's<br>I'm sure your colleagues from practice<br>will agree um we really appreciate that<br>so um I have the opportunity now to say<br>gam ham for your fantastic presentation<br>and uh we have a small gift for you</p></main><footer style="margin-top: 2rem; background: #0001; padding: 2rem; text-align:
