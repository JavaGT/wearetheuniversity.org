Her inaugural professorial lecture addresses features of the development and application of environmental protection law in Aotearoa New Zealand. She illustrates how a disparate collection of academic research and teaching interests can combine with legal practice, community activism, and an added dose of serendipity, resulting in an exceptional decision to protect an outstanding natural feature, Te Waikoropupū Springs.</p><h2>Transcript</h2><p style="opacity: 0.9; font-size: 0.8em">Transcripts may be automatically generated and

Victoria<br>University of Wellington to head angle<br>Walker and it is gain my privilege<br>tonight to welcome all of you uh family<br>friends distinguished guests academics<br>and professional colleagues and students<br>to tonight's Main Event the inaugural<br>lecture of Katherine irons professor of<br>law this event like many things that are<br>wonderful has taken a long time uh<br>although Professor irons has promoted to<br>this Prof this her position in January<br>2020 the inaugural lecture has been res<br>scheduled three times due to lockdowns<br>the business of university life and no<br>doubt many other<br>vicisitudes I'm thrilled that we can<br>finally host it here<br>tonight Katherine's interest in law as I<br>understand it was sparked first by her<br>father a philosophy lecturer here at<br>deaka who suggested he try it she's just<br>been telling me about her stories<br>growing up as the daughter of John Irons<br>a man who as standard didn't wear shoes<br>until she was 13 when he finally had to<br>take a sabatical in<br>Scotland uh and who had a really<br>colorful series of upbringings which I<br>know Katherine will talk about and I<br>won't steal her Thunder but I think<br>we'll hear about nuda camps and and<br>hippies within the Frameworks of law<br>that we would otherwise get um initially<br>and I've just described Catherine as a<br>Renaissance lawyer and I think that has<br>borne out through her early interest she<br>a range of subjects<br>philosophy uh and credit to her father<br>political science maths and computer<br>programming but it was ultimately that<br>law that resonated with her it came<br>naturally and she found herself drawn to<br>the arguments and the reasoning and she<br>quickly realized that it was not only<br>what she was good at but it was what she<br>also loved she then uh extended that as<br>an aluminous her at to her aaka to study<br>a Bachelor of Arts and a bachelor of<br>laws with honors and she went on to then<br>do a master of law<br>at Yale University in the United States<br>in her career she is an award-winning<br>researcher on environmental law<br>indigenous rights and statutory<br>interpretation in keeping with her<br>Renaissance interests her expertise is<br>wide ranging she focuses on projects<br>that have spanned fundamental principles<br>the rights for nature and human<br>responsibilities climate adaptation<br>environmental futures toxics I don't<br>know what they are but they sound<br>worrying and<br>Antarctica she's won numerous Awards<br>research awards from this University<br>publication Awards in resource<br>management and law from the resource<br>management law association and Senior<br>education awards from the international<br>Union of conservation of nature Academy<br>of Environmental law but in keeping with<br>that<br>Renaissance uh focus and that<br>Renaissance ability she's also a leader<br>in external engagement<br>and has extensively uh contributed to<br>our broader community in a whole number<br>of ways she as works as an advisor for<br>the New Zealand Council of legal<br>education and an adviser for the<br>environmental law initiative and she<br>also actively engages in volunteer work<br>including serving on Boards of Human<br>Rights and environmental organizations<br>which have spanned her career she<br>currently has a role with the<br>international Union of conservation of<br>nature one of the largest International<br>environmental organizations in the world<br>in<br>teaching she uh she shares how she looks<br>to encourage students not just by<br>understanding the laws but also<br>critically evaluating their flaws and<br>considering how they can be improved she<br>highlights how it's often about asking<br>the right questions identifying problems<br>and assumptions and knowing how to make<br>a good<br>argument uh and clearly that is all uh<br>assembled via her teaching meth methods<br>to earn her an international teaching<br>award only a few short years ago however<br>in this career which has been littered<br>with accolades from research to<br>engagement to teaching she also has<br>perhaps one of the most competitive and<br>the most prestigious awards given out by<br>her host faculty in law which is first<br>biscuits outside Academia Professor<br>irons has naed Walker known known for<br>her her work and walking on treadmills<br>and she encourages her students to keep<br>active she's also the mom of two boys<br>who I understand are here in the<br>audience and two white cats who I<br>understand are<br>Trump tonight wearing her mother's<br>greenstone and her father's academic<br>robes in a lecture entitled unconfirmed<br>and unseen precaution and protection in<br>environmental law professor irons will<br>address the features of the development<br>and application of environmental law and<br>AR illustrate how despite<br>collection sorry illustrate how a<br>disperate collection of academic<br>research and teaching interests can<br>combine with legal practice Community<br>activism and an added dose of<br>serendipity resulting in the exceptional<br>decision to Pro to protect an<br>outstanding natural feature this is a<br>leure that I'm thoroughly looking<br>forward to and I'm sure you are too so<br>with no further Ado it is my enormous<br>pleasure to introduce to all of you<br>John<br>taku um greetings to all of you and I<br>started with Papu anuku of Mother Earth<br>and I'm acknowledging all of the<br>distinguished guests here um we've got<br>honorable justices of our courts um<br>Chancellor I believe the vice Chancellor<br>of course um lots of very important<br>everybody all you very important people<br>here um thank you um and thank you the<br>vice Chancellor for your kind words I am<br>absolutely delighted um to be able to<br>give this inaugural lecture it does feel<br>odd being a professor here or a lecturer<br>certainly you been here a Professor for<br>4 years having lectured here for more<br>than 25 all right um I was a student<br>here my dad was a lecturer here we used<br>to go to the gym when I was in primary<br>school right I don't feel very<br>new um so in honor of the occasion um I<br>thought I would prepare something new um<br>something that could illustrate the<br>value of my research um and something I<br>hadn't already talked about before and<br>of course was most people here didn't<br>know what i' talked about before so I<br>could have just used something<br>old and I was like that was really smart<br>wasn't it um and everyone will know uh<br>that I know the people around me will<br>know how smart that wasn't um but that's<br>okay did it anyway so an inaugural<br>lecture is typically divided into thirds<br>um the first Parts got an introductory<br>comments um that might explain there<br>something about me or explain the<br>influences I told the first things about<br>influences that explain the choices on<br>my research career the second's about<br>the over<br>trajectory of a career um maybe an arc<br>of how all my bits fit together and then<br>the third is a specific example from the<br>overall work something that you might<br>want might be able to take away you<br>might have learned you know something<br>say about law um but it does have to be<br>aimed at a general audience I know at<br>least one person who says very endearing<br>things to me like you're not going to<br>talk about law are<br>you um but that's okay I'm so grateful<br>uh the first part so about the various<br>life life for influences on the<br>trajectory and I've got that divided<br>into three things always come in threes<br>you know that there's the childhood or<br>upbringing uh study and early career in<br>my 20s pretty much and then current<br>family and the problem current family<br>going what how do what do we do all<br>right so um I think always family is<br>always first past and present and um a<br>number of people here did know my<br>parents um even more knew my father as<br>he taught philosophy as has been<br>mentioned I am going to go out in the<br>limb and say that we were um what about<br>as hippie as you could get for someone<br>who had a<br>job um but uh I've been told he did the<br>quote hippie philosopher thing um very<br>well uh long hair um little leather<br>headband um a bushy Ginger beard bare<br>feet yeah until I was 13 and his<br>research Focus was of course ethics<br>right particularly the philosopher Hume<br>and I believe okay so um my mother had<br>an afro um not a good photo I couldn't<br>find a good one with the AF and<br>everything but there the was sometimes<br>longer sometimes shorter you can't<br>really see all of the here but um mom<br>was apparently very different a people<br>magnet with the X Factor um and for<br>whatever reason we always had a steady<br>stream of people in our house<br>particularly for dinners and parties<br>also working bees it was a big thing um<br>70 picture an old double Bay Villa in<br>the middle of Kori um a large bunch of<br>men and women on top painting the roof<br>and everybody's topless<br>and it's like damn hippies right um so<br>both my parents emphasized service and<br>helping other people I recall that our<br>very own Roger Clark was part of the<br>group that started the New Zealand<br>branch of Amnesty International uh in<br>the mid-60s dad came back um we were in<br>Oxford um we got this gwn Oxford um for<br>his PhD um uh we came back in ' 69 um<br>and of course he then joined uh Roger<br>and others um proceeding to write things<br>for them there was a publication on<br>torture and I know I have it somewhere<br>in a box but I couldn't find it easily<br>quickly but we've got a I found the um<br>uh what do you call the library catalog<br>record for it uh he was also this is<br>while he's a lecturer right um he he was<br>the chair of the New Zealand foster care<br>Federation um that's the pick from the<br>Dom post um from 75 I believe I didn't<br>write that down um and lots more media<br>and writing appearances uh there's an<br>interview here um<br>and paper from conference every year we<br>they got a philosophy or foster care<br>conferences um in the school holidays uh<br>so we also had a lot of foster children<br>in fact back in that first slide I was<br>had piggybacking one of our foster<br>children Keith um and they we had quite<br>a few that seem to me as a child seem to<br>stay for very lengthy periods of time uh<br>I was out collecting on weekends for<br>Coro you know or any NGO with the good C<br>was right back in the days when<br>everybody used cash and Primary School<br>Edge children were allow to go<br>collecting for it right um and we<br>apparently had one of the few openly<br>socialist households in karori I didn't<br>know that um I knew we stuck out like a<br>sore thumb but that was about it um I<br>did spend a few years at NTI piki my<br>parents were good friends of Donis and<br>Bill Nathan we spent Saturday mornings<br>learning too I even went on tour as part<br>of a haker group um but you can I did<br>stick out like a sore<br>thumb even my Pew Pew's<br>white all right um so why do I mention<br>all this really early background or<br>partly because today it's not so common<br>um it's not the same mind with different<br>mindset that kids learn nowadays and<br>grow up with right um partly it's also<br>because there's lots of people here I<br>know that know my parents and I thought<br>that's something that resonates um or<br>we're doing the same thing at that time<br>right um and but also like my parents<br>well certainly my mother passed far too<br>young but both my parents passed um<br>already uh my mother when she was only<br>33 uh and then my father when he was 56<br>um so and i' so I've outlived both of<br>them right so that was normal to be um<br>but I think it influenced my choices for<br>research and career as well in three<br>ways one it was normal to be a<br>University academic lots of our friends<br>were um standard conversations you know<br>with philosophers in the kitchen um that<br>I would sit and listen on the little<br>side bit um they were normal to argue<br>and have big ideas and I see Fiona<br>smiling brilliantly because she was one<br>of them right um and and more<br>importantly it's normal to argue what's<br>a good reason for something right for<br>anything doesn't matter you got to know<br>whether you've got a good reason um and<br>but then I also think third it's that<br>duty of those who can to work to address<br>social justice all right where you can<br>and Mal and environmental justice were<br>certainly both part of that um in the'<br>70s growing up um at the time there'll<br>be a lot of people who remember this and<br>a lot of people who have no idea right<br>but at the time there was quite a strong<br>political divide on social environmental<br>matters um despite Earth Day top left<br>there were fights over Lake monopod um<br>think big projects huge infrastructure<br>projects you know um it's been in the<br>news oh this is like think big again I<br>know people don't think it's quite the<br>same but we had that same kind of divide<br>um same in relation to Marty RS um Dame<br>Fina Cooper and her landm March all<br>right the establishment of the white<br>tongy tribunal in 75 n glavish is kior<br>where you basically pretty much fired<br>for saying Kor you know on a um as a<br>phone U what you call receptionist yeah<br>um there were strong opinions both ways<br>yet I'd still describe the overall theme<br>of that time growing up um and a<br>household as well as the country as<br>Peace Love environment and human rights<br>um when I was at Law School uh in the '<br>80s um longy came in but the who it was<br>really important for law legally the<br>huak case um I don't think I have got<br>them up yeah the huak case and then the<br>state owned Enterprises case two huge<br>decisions in terms of Marty rights that<br>um I don't know change completely<br>certainly what the country thought about<br>this legal effect of the Treaty of white<br>Tangi right um its principles and and<br>its effect in statutes um it it was<br>really exciting I was a student um at<br>law school and then I remember um when<br>these were handed down within four weeks<br>I think one was the 2nd of June and one<br>was like the 29th so four weeks apart um<br>and both did I'm not going to go into<br>what they did do but they I remember my<br>first job at the law in the law reform<br>division at the Department of Justice<br>I'm having a brainstorming session on<br>what we could do with these cases um and<br>I do know it influenced drafting at the<br>time<br>um so that brings me to another theme of<br>my trajectory when working somewhere<br>like the law reform division you don't<br>specialize um you at least as a graduate<br>but I worked on privacy I invented those<br>lovely information privacy principles<br>that came out in the 1993 act right I<br>still remember that Eureka moment um I<br>worked but I worked on the Bill of<br>Rights that we also got family law um<br>the new RMA we have that too um but<br>notice they're all completely different<br>areas of law You' do that in public law<br>family environment nobody not today<br>would span all of those yet when you<br>work in these departments you're<br>expected to be across all of them right<br>so um we gen once I was asked to do<br>something on criminal law and I was like<br>what criminal law I was hesitant but I<br>was thought no you have to it's a core<br>area of law everybody's got to do that<br>it's fundamental everyone's got to do<br>criminal law you had to be able to work<br>on any topic um so uh yeah next was my<br>Master's Degree yeah that's okay you<br>um the my Master's Degree yeah just<br>looking for a seat right just squeeze in<br>um so I jumped at the chance to do a<br>human rights Fellowship um working on<br>international law of indigenous<br>self-determination I visited the UN in<br>Geneva observing the working group on<br>indigenous peoples was called<br>populations but we can call it peoples<br>then moved to Australia to take up a<br>teaching position on international law<br>one subject Aboriginal rights the other<br>and helping out with environment um so<br>yeah taught International environmental<br>law and all of that early scholarship<br>was about improving interesting<br>indigenous rights in law and mostly<br>international law um we returned to aloa<br>our when we had our first child uh<br>that's the P of Faro and I really mean<br>Faro The Wider family all those Aunts<br>Uncles cousins close family friends<br>everybody all the draw cards to come<br>back to Wellington You know despite the<br>weather right um we we thought we<br>thought about it I quite like the<br>weather in Australia um but uh I uh but<br>yeah we came back and I do here have to<br>pay special um tribute and mention to<br>our dear Aunt Isabelle who played a big<br>part in our lives then um and also left<br>us far too young so having children has<br>actually been a huge part of who I am<br>today and for that I'm maternally<br>grateful um they've certainly made life<br>a lot more fun and more real and oh it's<br>not that one there okay forgot to put on<br>the Yale and The Graduate slide um<br>that's right so this<br>this was actually uh I know it looks<br>stupid because it was a video that I<br>took a screen a trying to take a screen<br>still of but this was them they got a<br>slot on the TV1 news right they had like<br>a five or six minute article about them<br>on the TV1 news and yes they were monkey<br>boys um so it won't be a surprise to<br>other parents to hear that having<br>children has had an impact on the type<br>of work they've done right my first<br>teaching here was actually international<br>law um and I'm not doing that now you<br>might not know that um Professor Alberto<br>costy that was before he came in that<br>was to fill in for Bill Hastings I don't<br>know how many people remember he went<br>off to be chief chief censor at short<br>notice together and I got asked to teach<br>it um as a new parent uh that was<br>actually knew with the second child I<br>had already found I didn't my first I<br>had already found I wasn't able to<br>travel quite so easily do the<br>international law that made it really<br>hard to keep up with the research and<br>the conferences um and especially when<br>I'd been going to International meetings<br>and my writing I'll talk about in a<br>minute has been very much about<br>observation and comment right so I<br>thought I better have switch to domestic<br>topics and so I thought oh I'll do just<br>domestic environment and domestic and I<br>wouldn't have to travel so much right um<br>so that so I did I switched um back then<br>0 say '95 to 2010 right I did not feel<br>like I had a research trajectory I can<br>tell you that two maternity leaves about<br>8 years parttime young children I did<br>feel honestly that I spent most of the<br>time running around after boys um who<br>didn't like to sit still um they're<br>doing really well<br>now so but I did learn really quickly to<br>explain things in a way that they could<br>understand you know knowing what they<br>knew from their perspective um it's like<br>I knew everything that they knew you<br>know pretty much um so I used that skill<br>in my teaching here explaining by<br>putting things into terms that and and a<br>context that students would know um of<br>course for every moment there comes a<br>time when they're generous and<br>well-meaning explanations become just so<br>annoying right like the eye roll why are<br>you still talking when I stopped<br>listening ages ago um how how many<br>parents have received this text I've got<br>this more than once I know I'm Not Alone<br>um but I I mention it now not to make<br>fun of the kids but because I actually<br>think it's really important to reach the<br>generation who wants or anybody there's<br>just too much information out there you<br>don't have time to read everything I<br>feel like I don't have time to read<br>anything and I like reading right um you<br>actually it's really important as part<br>of our research and as part of our role<br>um and especially if you want to achieve<br>change to reach this tldd generation and<br>you know writing another 100,000 words<br>is not usually well not always I'm going<br>to do that so I actually regard the Ted<br>Talk I did in 2015 um on my research to<br>a human right to healthy environment as<br>really valuable quite apart from family<br>reasons I won't go into that um but<br>there were around 1,00 people at that<br>Ted Talk I was asked by a good number of<br>them afterwards to where they could sign<br>up for my movement and I'm going oh yes<br>that's a great idea but no I don't have<br>a movement I probably shouldn't as a<br>professor I'm a card carrying paper<br>piler right if you want organization you<br>might need to get me a PA right but um<br>I've always been happy to help you know<br>where I can I'm not going to list them<br>all um but I have helped schools um some<br>of our graduates<br>uh Community groups Hau ewi sometimes um<br>with General skills but also sometimes<br>explicitly applying my research um I<br>just as an example I was one of three<br>academics the sister garuru um pro bono<br>as an academic with their submissions to<br>the EPA Board of inquiry in the trans<br>tesman resources um seabed mining<br>application I've drafted two treaty<br>claims and provided background research<br>into some novel potential avenues for<br>addressing environmental justice um I've<br>set on quite a few voluntary boards from<br>primary school you know to<br>322 350.org Eco Amnesty International um<br>for the Alo and New Zealand Branch um uh<br>the I'm currently on the international<br>board for uh the international Union for<br>the conservation of nature iucn I don't<br>know how many people know that it's<br>actually one of the largest<br>environmental organizations in the whole<br>world but we don't see them here cuz<br>they do most of the work in non-d<br>develop you know in the developing world<br>you know we are more of a contributor to<br>their work<br>um I but I do also chare their task<br>force on Antarctica in the Southern<br>Ocean and have been a commissioner in<br>the toxics inquiry pesticides and nasty<br>chemicals that you don't want near your<br>body or breathing them in right so um<br>and yes I've been an adviser to the<br>environmental law initiative um love<br>that organization and those people um<br>mostly on law reform matters but also<br>ideas for legal challenges so is there a<br>theme you know is there a trajectory<br>theme um well I do one of them I suggest<br>is service right service that was you<br>know brought up probably learned in<br>childhood and one of them is the arguing<br>about ideas words and ideas full<br>explanations of course um but not a lot<br>of<br>specialization right so that does lead<br>me so there's all sort of the influences<br>that lead to the<br>trajectory so um mine I don't think my<br>trajectory looks at all like any of the<br>other uh in professorial inaugurals that<br>I've attended certain certainly in other<br>disciplines you know you get someone who<br>chooses something early on maybe like<br>for a PhD and they've been doing that<br>thing ever since whether it's nany's ice<br>CAD drilling you know or looking down<br>microscopes at pictures of crystals and<br>trying to figure out what they're doing<br>you know um most recently Dean Knight<br>and his an augre lecture on judicial<br>review I thought that was really focused<br>right and I'm going I don't have any<br>Focus I'm not sure that there's any one<br>thing that neatly describes what I've<br>been doing and it was Nick that came up<br>with the Renaissance and I go I'll take<br>that one I'll take the Renaissance<br>um I think it's partly the nature of the<br>law degree right it is skills-based I I<br>was told in my first job you need to be<br>able to apply it to any topic so what<br>have I done hundreds of presentations<br>not talking about my lectures there's<br>many more hundreds of those um I've<br>written about 88 refereed Publications<br>um I think 69 are sole authored and some<br>of the research reports some of those so<br>author BS um not all lot of them are<br>joint but some of them have ended up the<br>size of PhD thesis um so goodness knows<br>how many projects are still like mostly<br>written um I'd like to say they're in a<br>drawer but the draw is only metaphorical<br>um they're most likely to be in a pile<br>somewhere maybe in a box stack somewhere<br>like my old office um don't tell Carol<br>um so I've written quite a few articles<br>um so in terms of the types right I've<br>written quite a few that are based on<br>observing debates just identifying<br>patterns creating Frameworks and then<br>use the framework to classify what I've<br>seen right I love doing that I love<br>putting examples into a diagrams or a<br>matrix um I like paying attention to<br>figure out where people are coming from<br>what do they say when they use these<br>words or then they you know especially<br>when they're arguing um I ask why a lot<br>some people find that really annoying um<br>but uh I have found it gets sort a you<br>know a whole another layer of that<br>figuring out what people are meaning<br>when they're talking so in law I might<br>wonder what tools have you used in your<br>statutory interpretation are they the<br>right ones I'll come to that in a minute<br>um in Environmental Protection you might<br>ask oh what approach is that is that<br>anthropocentric is that Ecentric where<br>are the other species in this decision<br>is that all about people and their needs<br>or<br>Renaissance you know trying to put it<br>all in a big picture but also you have<br>to know all the examples so in terms of<br>research types I'd say I spend a lot of<br>time in synthesis um but also Discovery<br>from observation and so there's not a<br>lot of people don't think of law as<br>being about Discovery but it can be<br>right U most people think that's science<br>so I'll illustrate some of the different<br>projects with examples um my writing and<br>I thought what I might do is go take<br>photos of all the front of them I just<br>didn't get quite get round to it so he's<br>didn't realize you'd be steering at this<br>slide for so long sorry um but uh in my<br>article I've got one I did one in<br>902 um on challenging State sovereignty<br>I wrote that as a y human rights fellow<br>I started with observations from the<br>debate at the working group on<br>indigenous peoples I saw how the states<br>and Indigenous peoples were effectively<br>talking past each other and when they<br>used the word selfdetermination they<br>were literally describing different<br>things um I felt it was like a Joan<br>Mitch moment you know almost<br>anthropological so I described their<br>positions I explained the different<br>perspectives on the law I figured out<br>what I thought the law actually was<br>right and then I just wrote it up um I<br>found other people found that really<br>helpful it still gets cited and it's<br>been excerted for anthologies so that's<br>again a type of knowledge creation You<br>observe and you document and you try and<br>analyze um for an article uh for UCLA on<br>indigenous rights of democratic<br>participation um in international law<br>um so in international you've got two<br>you've got different areas you know<br>different areas even of human rights law<br>right and so you've got an area say of<br>indigenous rights you've got an area of<br>women's rights or children's rights<br>you've got um say political rights I<br>mean now you've got an area of human<br>right to health but often different<br>people some people specialize and some<br>people work on just those areas and um I<br>was reading all the cases and thought I<br>was going to write this particular<br>article and as I'm reading the detail I<br>realize that these two different areas<br>the indigenous rights the area of<br>indigenous rights addresses political<br>participation the area of political<br>rights and participation addresses<br>indigenous people's rights and they said<br>completely different things so I simply<br>pointed that out and no one else had<br>noticed it so again it's this I it<br>almost I feel like it almost didn't<br>matter what the topic was CU I just like<br>noticing those kind of things um of<br>course I took 72 pages to do that but<br>that's why you can that's why you<br>publish an American Law Journal<br>as long as you have enough footnotes you<br>can have as many words as you<br>like um so another project in that vein<br>could be my 2017 article on<br>environmental justice um I noticed the<br>American debate on environmental justice<br>and it's a huge debate in the States on<br>environmental justice it's race-based um<br>but it it ignored indigenous Concepts<br>and Indigenous people's requests for<br>what they consider to be environmental<br>justice um so that's a huge amission<br>over there and I just figured out a<br>different framework way of looking at it<br>um and illustrate it with case studies<br>to show that that my framework was more<br>useful than their right um than one you<br>know three elements are better than two<br>right so I really enjoyed those big<br>survey projects um here uh in New<br>Zealand I did undertake um with the<br>courtesy of a very patient law<br>Foundation um a big survey of hundreds<br>of court of appeal cases trying to<br>identify in patterns um identify<br>patterns in how judges use parliamentary<br>history materials um and that's in their<br>decisions uh in judgments and then do<br>they have any rules have they figured<br>out or are they are they saying they've<br>got rules or am I do I have to figure<br>out the pattern myself and say this is<br>what I think they're doing right um I<br>that is not I don't really care about<br>the substance of the law it doesn't<br>matter what area of law what statute<br>they're interpreting I just wanted to<br>know the method um and I've written that<br>up um so another paper of surveyed the<br>use of Marty words and legislation that<br>was back in I think it came was 2010<br>somewhere back then before I went on<br>sabatical in 2011 um so but it's it's I<br>guess that type of thing is what I'm uh<br>doing rather than a subject area so much<br>the examples I've given are mostly<br>indigenous but um I've done it in<br>environmental law but most of my<br>environment ones have actually been<br>fairly no I say some of my articles have<br>been fairly standard I might look at the<br>science and then say oh how is the<br>science reflected in the law and that I<br>certainly did that on my article on<br>pesticide regulation that was 2018 um<br>pesticides are one of the toxic<br>chemicals killing our natural world<br>footnote we should refuse them we should<br>buy organic um but possibly the one with<br>the biggest breadth is still in progress<br>um that's taken a huge look at science<br>modeling and other research on 11<br>different environmental topics again<br>it's the big picture make a map deep<br>where they fit right and focusing on<br>predictions for 2050 I know I've given<br>already some talks on that but and and<br>written some of it up I just haven't<br>done anything with it sitting in the<br>drawer that one U definitely joins a lot<br>of dots um so you might be surprised to<br>learn that there are any topics that<br>I've published on more than once right<br>um but I have I've a couple articles on<br>statutory interpretation Le a couple um<br>legal personhood for nature maybe four<br>or five co-governance climate adaptation<br>law um and the precautionary principle<br>environmental law that's one that I've<br>actually worked on across a lot of<br>statutes probably taught it more than<br>I've written it but that's that is one<br>that's woven its way throughout my work<br>throughout my career as well um and I'm<br>going to come back to that one in a few<br>minutes if if there is two themes that<br>keep coming back and one of them would<br>be statutory interpretation and the<br>precautionary principle and then<br>obviously keeping a focus on indigenous<br>rights um so I do want to offer two<br>illustrations now um one on stri<br>interpretation and then um precaution<br>and then I'll I'll get to the case<br>eventually<br>so um I don't I didn't choose the skill<br>stat interpretation I think it chose me<br>right um this is lawyers and<br>philosophers bread and butter um I tell<br>students that a law degree doesn't teach<br>you um really sort of what to think as<br>much as it teaches you how to think uh<br>and especially about how to argue and<br>argue about the meaning of words right<br>it doesn't matter what the conclusion is<br>the point is to get the right method and<br>you need the right reasons for your<br>argument does that sound familiar right<br>and the right evidence um and they only<br>come from a good<br>method why do we have to teach people<br>how to figure out um the meaning of a<br>word don't we do that naturally the<br>English word English language as we know<br>uses words in a lot of different senses<br>um but think of a dictionary there's<br>more than one meaning you look at one<br>word and there could be six different<br>meanings okay so how do you know which<br>meaning is the one that got put in the<br>statute right so I mean just taking an<br>easy example you know the word animal<br>right you know there's more than one of<br>those if we have an animals protection<br>act Animal Welfare legislation we<br>probably don't expect that to cover<br>humans do we but aren't humans animals<br>it's one of the meanings in the<br>dictionary right we get argum literal<br>arguments and it's one of the literal<br>meanings isn't it so we get literal<br>meaning arguments like that all the time<br>but you can't say I'm just being literal<br>because there's more than one literal<br>meaning right so um you need you could<br>go the other way right insects covered<br>by Animal Welfare legislation that<br>protects against causing you know harm<br>or unnecessary unnecessary suffering how<br>about flies or cockroaches right are<br>they covered um do we just not worry<br>about enforcing that or do we actually<br>think they're a different group of<br>creatures you know they're included in<br>animal as well right in one meaning of<br>animal so I really mention this I mean<br>the lawyers know this already um but I<br>so I mentioned this more for the non-w<br>in the room simply to stress that the<br>meanings of words depend on the way<br>they're used and that means they depend<br>on their context and the intent or the<br>purpose for which you're using them um<br>and then that goes especially when<br>they're put into statutes for a<br>particular reason sometimes words are<br>defined in a statute but mostly they're<br>not um so statutes are written in<br>ordinary words that were're meant to be<br>able to understand so we devised rules<br>right about this is law devised rules<br>about what you can look at and what you<br>should look at in order to determine the<br>meaning of words it's not a freefor all<br>um in the first year course in laws 123<br>um we teach students how to precisely<br>identify what it is about the meaning of<br>a word that doesn't seem quite right in<br>the fact situation um like whether a a<br>rule and a statute applies to it um and<br>we also have an 11-point<br>process um for figuring this out I guess<br>the first three are identifying the<br>issue that's not really part of 11<br>points but the last one has got four<br>included so you could say it's a 12<br>Point process um I liken this and we<br>make students go through every single<br>one you have to learn how to do each one<br>all right properly with the right<br>reasons and the right method um and uh I<br>liken it to the snowplow approach for<br>learning to ski right you get taught<br>when you first learned a ski you get<br>taught a particular approach that when<br>you get good you'll never use a game<br>unless you get into trouble you hurt<br>something and then you have to revert<br>back to basics all right um so you could<br>think of it as training wheels on a<br>bicycle as well once you get Goods you<br>don't need your training wheels but we<br>make students do every step um they're<br>not always relevant to solving each<br>problem in fact they'll never probably<br>get every only in an exam right when we<br>test them will you get every step<br>relevant to a real problem um to a<br>problem but if you try and skip over<br>them when you're not good at them all<br>then you'll come a Cropper right um only<br>when you master it can you progress to<br>jump tuning so experienced lawyers and<br>judges are jump turning skares and quite<br>rightly they skip over the steps they<br>know they don't need okay but it's not<br>helpful if they miss ones that actually<br>help them solve the problem for example<br>we don't want them to completely miss<br>looking at the purpose of the<br>legislation do we especially if there's<br>evidence of that purpose that helps them<br>solve the problem um but even<br>experienced lawyers don't always get<br>those jumps right um within the just<br>within the last two years I couldn't<br>remember the exact year and I just<br>didn't go back and look um either last<br>year or the year before<br>um I've seen a publicly available<br>opinion from a large Law Firm that's<br>interpreting a noun in the RMA looking<br>at whether an unexpected fact was<br>included in that<br>noun um it only looked at the<br>dictionary only step one it was signed<br>off by a partner in that large Law Firm<br>honest um so I can understand why the<br>high court might say you don't go<br>looking for say meaning and post Haw<br>information papers put out by the<br>ministry for the environment but that<br>doesn't mean you don't go through your<br>steps that one post talk paper doesn't<br>invalidate all the rest of the steps<br>right I mean it's not all bad um indeed<br>the best interpretation I've seen maybe<br>unfortunately for most people is from<br>Inland Revenue they've got some great<br>legal opinions I'd be very careful if<br>you to pick battles with them um so<br>judges approaches to interpretation um I<br>going say variable right I don't think<br>it's necessarily a personal method<br>because there's one high court judge and<br>again I'm not going to name them here<br>like public I'm happy to talk about them<br>but<br>um one high court judge has talked up<br>both the best and the worst examples of<br>ir stat interpretation method I've seen<br>so I think it's not personal um but<br>maybe it's the case they were given<br>right or maybe they didn't get good<br>arguments from the lawyers you can blame<br>the lawyers that the judges can all fall<br>always fall back on that I didn't get<br>the right arguments and I'm not allowed<br>to go looking on my own right if they<br>haven't been given so um but judges<br>decisions do have serious consequences<br>so they're meant to get it right um it's<br>definitely much better and I'm going to<br>give one example and this one everyone<br>knows then who the people are but I can<br>do this because this is the Supreme<br>Court right um so the 2013 decision and<br>it's maybe not the current Supreme Court<br>either but the 2013 decision of the<br>Supreme Court in Bull Cole right that<br>allowed the resource consent to mine the<br>bull Plateau for coal and a whole bunch<br>of snails died and all sorts of things<br>right um it was a huge deal it was also<br>a Split Decision over the interpretation<br>of the statute and its Amendment and in<br>my opinion only one judge I say split<br>that means different judges they<br>different opinions right um only one<br>judge got the method of statutary<br>interpretation right um that was the<br>then chief justice the right honorable<br>Dame shanas um that decision she was in<br>descent though unfortunately she was not<br>the majority um that came out in 2013 I<br>was um talked about it in class in 2014<br>um that was law I never felt I don't<br>know I never felt able to just write it<br>up as open criticism I probably should<br>have um I just wasn't as bushy<br>um not as I am<br>now um um I've thought of it did anyone<br>go to David mclin's lecture last week um<br>he showed uh I was think I need to<br>channel David mlin he showed how<br>commenting on judicial decisions can<br>basically be a Blood Sport<br>um so so this detail this dovetails<br>nicely into um the discussion of the<br>precautionary principle in New Zealand<br>environmental law because that's another<br>one that typically entails um<br>interpreting a statute and and of course<br>we're getting to the case it's one that<br>was key to the environment court report<br>on the water conservation I say case<br>it's the environment Court makes<br>decisions and cases this particular one<br>was actually a report to the minister so<br>but of course in my head we say<br>environment Court we say case um so<br>excuse me if I keep saying case not<br>report but I've clarified it so um<br>what's the precautionary principle oh<br>this got okay so the precautionary<br>principle it's going do one at a time<br>all right um this is this is from my<br>class um this says that we can take<br>precautionary measures even in the<br>absence of full scientific certainty<br>about the effects of our actions on the<br>environment all right quite easy quite<br>simple we can act to avoid a threat of<br>harm even if there's not enough evidence<br>to prove causation or precise results<br>why because once Clear Proof becomes<br>available it might be too late to fix it<br>and it's the old rule better safe than<br>sorry stitching time saves nine you know<br>that kind of um so it departs though<br>from standard legal rules about<br>causation and so a lot of lawyers have<br>difficulty with<br>it um what it's meant to do though is in<br>maybe not be used as a as a sword but<br>it's meant to be able to be used as a<br>shield to defend your decision right if<br>I'm want to make you know uh I mean I'll<br>come to some decisions think of fishings<br>in the news Maui Dolphins Hector's<br>dolphins seabirds getting caught on<br>hooks everything right the minister<br>could make a decision says you know what<br>I think we've reached the limit of those<br>I'm going to make a decision to either<br>maybe make some more ban some more<br>trolling some sitting put some hooks on<br>or I'm going to make a decision ision<br>that protects those birds or seals<br>whatever it is be precautionary and<br>there there's not evidence that's not<br>conclusive evidence not enough for<br>causation for a case you know that you<br>might win on to say that yes that would<br>happen if I didn't do it but I don't<br>need it this is a shield that says I can<br>take that anyway okay that's what it's<br>important for um but of course they vary<br>because it's really a principle it's an<br>idea the most common theme is literally<br>this States shall be more cautious when<br>information is uncertain unreliable or<br>inadequate the absence of adequate<br>scientific information shall not be used<br>as a reason for postponing or failing to<br>take conservation and management<br>measures but quite reasonable quite<br>normal in the I got the CBD the<br>convention on biological diversity they<br>have one like that um where they<br>actually use it as a um a significant<br>reduction or loss of biological<br>diversity in that convention and that's<br>the same idea afterwards um obviously<br>management measures in one measures to<br>avoid or minimize a threat you know<br>wording changes slightly but same idea<br>the Rio declaration formulation I to do<br>this is the lowest common denominator<br>again applies to any topic the lowest<br>common denominator because all the<br>states could agree on it right and you<br>know what it's like when you try to<br>agree on something you get out you cut<br>out all of the controversial bits you<br>and also sometimes it's the weakest<br>version but that's okay um so this one<br>says the precautionary approach shall be<br>widely applied to States though it adds<br>according to their capabilities where<br>there are threats of serious or<br>irreversible damage lack of full<br>scientific C shall not be used as a<br>reason for postponing costeffective<br>measures to prevent environmental<br>degradation so you can see that they<br>change slightly but the idea is there um<br>so we have we had Fisheries act in 96<br>the 92 with the CBD and the Rio<br>declaration and New Zealand goes oh we<br>should have a precautionary principle I<br>bet you someone like Jeffrey Palmer<br>probably had something to do with<br>it um but uh I didn't do Fisheries back<br>then so I don't actually know um what<br>went into it um but then they went and<br>drafted it in a really weird way they<br>got the drafters got to thought oh we<br>need to be a bit more precise than just<br>this General principle let's break it<br>down make it a little bit easier for<br>people to follow so they go oh all put<br>it's only a principle taken to account<br>the following principles but they go<br>decisions should be best based on the<br>best available information decision<br>makers should consider uncertainty you<br>should be cautious that's uncertain and<br>then in the absence or of information or<br>uncertainty and then um you've got this<br>Shield as a defense right you can't be<br>used as a reason for postponing off so<br>it's a little bit different from the<br>others but um<br>it's it's um you can see what the the<br>minister when they introduced it said<br>this was the implementation of the<br>precautionary principle by the time it<br>came in this was um National um<br>government but yeah it was a uh it was<br>said to be the precautionary principle<br>so it started off really well Justice<br>previous Justice Ellis in '98 um uh<br>applied it in a case which reduced Rock<br>Lobster um total allowable catch and it<br>was upheld as a precautionary decision<br>right and then then the Fisheries<br>companies started challenging that first<br>one that best available information<br>right the one that said ministers should<br>use take into account the principle that<br>ministers should use um and we actually<br>had it wasn't sorry squid fishery wasn't<br>the first um we actually had a series of<br>cases because if I'm going to give the<br>full thing on the Fisheries act let's<br>make another half hour so I'm not going<br>to do that but we had a series of cases<br>that challenged these individual<br>elements and ministers precautionary<br>decisions on Banning sitting for you<br>know Maui Dolphins um or sea lions and<br>squid fish iies or any they all got<br>struck down because there was something<br>in the information that the department<br>put up to the minister that someone else<br>said oh no they should have had this and<br>the court goes they probably should have<br>um the only one um I was going to say<br>yeah what I've done is yeah I've cut<br>there's only after Ellis the only other<br>judge that I think again got it right on<br>statut<br>interpretation was Justice France when<br>she was in the high court so now she's<br>on the Supreme Court anyway um so now we<br>should be maybe we should be trying to<br>fix this so just as an illustration<br>though there were models no one of the<br>things you do um see marine mammals like<br>eating the same fish that we like<br>catching for food for Commerce um and<br>they often get caught in our Nets uh and<br>then they die and if we catch too many<br>of them like that then these species<br>will go extinct much sooner than if we<br>didn't do this we didn't we weren't<br>fishing they have what they they set a<br>maximum amount of fishing related<br>mortality and when you reach that limit<br>then you have to stop fishing so of<br>course the Fisheries companies want a<br>really high limit so they can keep<br>fishing and a lot of Environmental Group<br>saying we don't think that's precaution<br>enough we you know this is one of those<br>ones where it will be too late um so as<br>low limit was set on a model and then<br>someone said no you should have used a<br>different model um they used the same<br>model they've been using for years but a<br>new one came out and Justice Frances<br>it's okay to be precautionary you're<br>allowed to do this court of appeal said<br>no you need to know the numbers you need<br>to know all the possible numbers that<br>were numbers available you didn't give<br>them to a minister go back and do it<br>again and you're going we didn't even<br>get down to D all right we just this is<br>just a you didn't use the rest available<br>information I think I'm probably<br>spending a bit long on this but I hope<br>it's okay but within another case<br>challenged Orange ruffy um and I know<br>there are some people who work for the<br>law firm that did this I don't know if<br>um the ABS this so D which was the<br>effect of bringing in the shield right<br>so the orange ruffy quota was decided<br>the minister decided to reduce the total<br>allowable catch um and it was challenged<br>both on the information but then also<br>purpose they go wait a minute that D<br>said it was for the purpose of the act<br>the shield was only to defend the<br>purpose of the ACT our purpose of the<br>ACT has got two purposes it's got<br>conservation and<br>fishing right and the conservation is<br>often interpreted as sustaining the<br>fishing so and they argued this is I<br>think this was Chapman trip um they<br>argued there is no presumption in favor<br>of presuming the resource for future<br>Generations this is the utilization of<br>the fishery the minister was advised oh<br> let's not defend this case um and<br>they pulled it and we went to law reform<br>and things but I personally think I'm<br>why do I give you these I think they<br>literally got the interpretation they<br>used the wrong method they got it wrong<br>and as huge consequences right Ellen<br>France knows how to do it she still<br>thinks she's right I've asked<br>her so Eli where are you when you need<br>to take a Fisheries case all right um<br>something needs to go to the Supreme<br>Court on this one but um uh you know I<br>was suitably outraged I um wrote an<br>article in 2004 it was published in6 I<br>gave conferences on it it was back then<br>um I got a little be in my Bonnet I<br>looked at Australian law Canada law<br>American international law um I taught a<br>whole when I taught International no it<br>was environmental law and I taught a<br>whole half the course just a week on<br>each of these different parts of it um<br>and and it was one of those great things<br>for classifying things in boxes and<br>making Frameworks so I figured that's<br>you know I this is something I know<br>something about I think we should do<br>some more of it right so I went and<br>looked at the RMA um and that's<br>something I also did in class and took<br>the resource management at cases that<br>used precaution tried to figure out what<br>was going on um I Greg senson got a PhD<br>now when he was a research assistant I<br>got him to research some updates for me<br>um and then and then he hopefully put<br>them on a PowerPoint slide which I'll<br>show you in just a minute um but there's<br>something very different for about the<br>incorporation of the precautionary<br>principle in the RMA right first it's<br>actually not in the statute it's a<br>general principle of environmental law<br>so<br>um Can courts use it can we got a<br>statute can they just bring in these<br>general principles there's the first<br>question and if so how right but here's<br>the funny thing different judges have<br>done different things this is Greg's um<br>I think very helpful slide even though<br>right here is a bit bright um but uh the<br>judges have done different things ever<br>since they've been putting it into this<br>everything they've been taking cases on<br>it I'm not going to go through what all<br>the words mean so I don't read all the<br>words this just an illustration the<br>yellow cases are one line of authority<br>you get the McIntyre and then all these<br>other yellow ones follow McIntyre shely<br>primary school is another one it takes a<br>very different approach and then all<br>these other grade out cases they take<br>they follow Shirley schools and they're<br>all completely different and then<br>they've got they do it in different ways<br>some look at it as a burden of proof<br>some look it as a standard of proof and<br>some say this is a general principle<br>that comes into overall broad judgment<br>when they had that right though that<br>doesn't mean much maybe to most lawyers<br>in the room but just take most non-<br>lawyers sorry um um but I hope it means<br>something to the lawers but<br>um uh it really it's just showing that<br>that different when you don't amaz when<br>you don't know the whole picture on the<br>framework or you haven't had the right<br>arguments on the principle you actually<br>don't know what it's meant to do right<br>um so may obviously there were different<br>fact situations involved and they did<br>what they thought was the most sensible<br>way to resolve that problem in front of<br>them which is what judges do um but it's<br>not helpful for developing a framework<br>or enabling other people to follow what<br>you've done if everyone's got different<br>things and they don't understand it um<br>so I mean it is clear now that the<br>precautionary principle is inherent in<br>the AR it's inherent in the definition<br>of um effect um a potential effect there<br>um and in the direction on how court<br>should be considering consents for those<br>who want that that's section 104 but um<br>and supreme court has got guidance on<br>how um it might be applied um when you<br>might want to decline an activity your<br>response depends on the facts and<br>question but think about a lawyer making<br>arguments in court if they want to use<br>it um you're trying to present your case<br>and or your client's case and in the<br>best way persuade the judge that you've<br>got the right and one way to do that is<br>oh I've got some precedence on my side<br>and you say oh look I've got a whole<br>line of Precedence on my side I'm going<br>to pick the yellow ones you might not<br>even notice the other ones I might not<br>realize it's a whole different way of<br>looking at it because you've found like<br>20 cases that support you um uh which I<br>can totally understand but I do think<br>that has led to a um I don't know say<br>it's a blind spot I'm uh there are<br>people who know more about the RMA here<br>than me um but and they know know more<br>about the practice of the RMA I'm just<br>the nerdy one who gets to write about<br>you know the rules right but um it did<br>really make me think that practice<br>needed a bit of academic assistance<br>sometimes and I know the academics need<br>a lot of practical assistance but<br>sometimes I think the practicing people<br>could help with some academic um so that<br>brings me<br>to the um the third and the last part to<br>wot poooo Springs so how how did I get<br>involved in this case this Cas before<br>the environmental this these sets of<br>proceedings right it's not a normal case<br>um the precursor that's why I've got<br>here is Magnolia Lowe's brilliant<br>brilliant very good um I she made a<br>really good documentary about my work<br>you know and I'm the ha Hazard thing and<br>I made you made it look really good<br>right um that aired in May 2020 late May<br>2020 Kevin Moran um uh saw the<br>documentary and he simply cold called me<br>to be the<br>lawyer right their NGO um NGO called<br>save our Springs to help protect to wot<br>poo Springs in the environment Court um<br>and I thought oh my goodness that is<br>exactly what I want to do um it seemed<br>like the perfect marrying of academic<br>and practical all in the service of<br>Environmental Protection um my I did<br>have to overcome a couple hurdles like<br>oh I need a practicing certificate right<br>now so that wasn't instant um but so I<br>got my barister brother Steven to file<br>urgent filing of proed apparently we<br>didn't know this at the time when came<br>to us you had like one week to file a<br>response I don't think given knew it<br>either um so uh but then I know I I<br>needed a senior rmaa lawyer to take it<br>on so I called Sally jip I knew Sally<br>knew what a good argument looked like<br>and because I you know there's a lot of<br>people I've mentioned here I had to take<br>out cuz I had it too long I had to take<br>out all of the extra paragraphs I've got<br>another three pages maybe I use it at<br>morning tea tomorrow about all of the<br>stuff about the people and the thank you<br>but anyway I'll just talk about the<br>stuff so what was tiu Springs about well<br>under the resource management act RMA um<br>there's a part nine which enables the<br>minister for the environment to make<br>water conservation orders you don't have<br>to read all the text um but it's like<br>you know I need visuals and I like<br>seeing what's up there they've been<br>likened to being the equivalent of<br>national parks for water bodies right so<br>and you can see the section 199 has got<br>a purpose of a conservation water<br>conservation order it's to recognize and<br>sustain there a and b outstanding<br>amenity or intrinsic values which are<br>afforded by Waters in their natural<br>state or if they're not maybe they've<br>been degraded then their values which<br>warrant protection and then it can do<br>all these other things um you can<br>preserve it as far as possible in its<br>natural state you can protect its<br>characteristics um which are considered<br>to be outstanding and there's a few<br>there habitats fishery wild Scenic<br>characteristics scientific value<br>recreational historical cultural or<br>spiritual purposes I just reversed those<br>um and and if it's insignificant in<br>accordance significance in accordance<br>with<br>tikari so in order to protect the water<br>body the water conservation order can<br>can put in it can make things mandatory<br>some things it can't do it wants to<br>leave to maybe a Regional Council to do<br>um some but it can set some limits some<br>parameters it might set limits on water<br>flows right or May maybe allocation if<br>you want to irrigate from somewhere um<br>it can set you know water quality limits<br>you can put restrictions on temperature<br>and pressure like from discharges all<br>sorts of things and there have been a<br>bunch of um really significant water<br>conservation orders made U mostly for<br>outstanding wild and Scenic Rivers but<br>there had never been a water<br>conservation order for an aquafer on<br>underground spring um but then there had<br>never quite been a water body like T poo<br>poo um this is a picture actually and I<br>thought there are pictures in It's not<br>officially a judgment it's a report but<br>there are pictures in this report which<br>is like an environment court judgment um<br>so yeah this is one of them first<br>respect must be paid to hwa she's one of<br>the three main tanif of the whole<br>country aloa um and guardian of tioo<br>she's believed to rest beneath the<br>surface of those Springs um and guards<br>them but she guards them from the<br>mountains all the way out to the Sea the<br>fari papa arur marble aquafer is part of<br>a highly complex and vast cast<br>hydrogeological Artis artisian system<br>that cast system and the taka River and<br>its tribues all feed the spring um it's<br>uh the largest cold water Springs in the<br>southern hemisphere every second um<br>between every second between 10,000 and4<br>18,000 lers of water are released every<br>second and it's just constant boil right<br>a huge upwelling um and you look down<br>and it actually doesn't look very far it<br>looks maybe four 5 m it's actually about<br>15 it's huge right um it's one of the<br>clearest fresh waters in the whole world<br>um 76 M Clarity you can see 76 M down I<br>think I can't see 76 M but my glasses in<br>the air right so um yeah anyway that um<br>I believe it's second only to U the blue<br>lake lake Ru Mighty fena U which is<br>Nelson L National Park so very similar<br>right right next door there so some of<br>the clearest water ever measured wonders<br>of the natural world um so there's<br>that's the dancing Springs next to it um<br>and I just put the map you can see the<br>flat the one on the left has got the<br>hills with the native vegetation and<br>then the cleared Plains but on the right<br>the red<br>is the recharge area so it's there's a<br>big recharge area all the way up um but<br>how does it get so how does that water<br>get so clear right oh sorry forgot um I<br>had a the schematic cross-section to<br>show the marble that huge great big<br>block underneath right solid marble then<br>you think wait a minute how does water<br>soak through Marble there's apparently a<br>lot of fishes um as an if SSU are fishes<br>and cracks and channels that the<br>waterers carved over the years um that's<br>most of it but um I'll come to that in a<br>minute so but how does the water get so<br>clear um it's these the<br>Unseen all right the little Stiga um<br>creatures that eat any plant or other<br>Carboniferous material that washes down<br>the water they basically keep the water<br>clean so if we want to keep clean water<br>we have to keep these guys alive and but<br>um<br>for is one of the most sacred places in<br>MOA golden Bay it's a registered<br>and um and it's they give it the name<br>tuna W it's a spiritual and physical<br>source of life so um the evidence is<br>lots of evidence that went before the<br>court um these Springs are all inspiring<br>they're spiritually significant for<br>everyone not just sacred to maneno and<br>Kaki though um non-mar regard these as<br>very spiritual place um however<br>monitoring data primarily gathered by um<br>friends of golden Bay it's an NGO showed<br>that nitrates in the springs um have<br>been increasing for a number of years<br>right um yet there were different views<br>about where these nitrates were coming<br>from many farmers wanted more irrigation<br>and with water quality dropping there<br>were many others very concerned for the<br>health of the Springs worried that it<br>was farming that was causing the nitrate<br>and also worried that like other places<br>where you've got nitrate levels there<br>may be another 10 or 15 years of our<br>bold still to come and it's already<br>going down so there's big worries there<br>um but that was disputed we've seen it's<br>a huge aquifer you see the recharge area<br>water comes in from all sources up the<br>hills down the Valley from the National<br>Park from Farmland um that's just<br>simplifying it and then it seeps<br>underground right but some water some<br>places it goes really really slowly and<br>some places it goes quite fast that's a<br>shallow so some of it and then but a lot<br>pretty much all gets channeled up or no<br>not all sorry part bits of it get<br>channed up um into the Springs most of<br>it goes out to sea underneath right but<br>from isotope dating apparently the water<br>that comes out at the Springs ranges<br>from 2 years old to more than 100 years<br>old and an average I recall of about 8<br>years they were using so but obviously<br>if you look at any particular water that<br>um it would depend on you know where it<br>came in to how long it took and where it<br>came from you know what it carried so<br>the Tasman District Council had expert<br>scientists who developed and used models<br>for what they thought was happening to<br>the water flows and where the nitrate<br>was coming from this did not suggest it<br>was largely from the farming Valley they<br>thought it was coming actually from<br>elsewhere particularly the um outside<br>the national park GS and other things<br>like that um applicant the applicants<br>for the water conservation order in this<br>case which I'll come to as you what do<br>you call pref that um but many others<br>simply thought that beggared belief<br>given the history and the trajectory of<br>the results of the nitrate levels so<br>what did they do about it<br>well num trust and Andrew U um a retired<br>scientist in Golden Bay they applied for<br>a water conservation order under the ACT<br>um under part nine um they were using<br>the brilliant Marie Baker Galloway and<br>Rosy Hill at Anderson Lloyd um in<br>Queenstown um and that went to a special<br>tribunal which reported in early 2020<br>I'm missing out all the you know<br>procedure stuff in between that special<br>tribunal recommended a water<br>conservation order but with some<br>discussions and findings that basically<br>everybody disagreed with something in<br>it um so then they went to the<br>environment court and that's what given<br>um and sa Springs wanted to do was like<br>we need to go to the environment court<br>now you know so now um we might need<br>some lawyers there was some attempt at<br>mediation expert witnessing expert<br>witness conferencing um that was in 2021<br>um but eventually it had to be resolved<br>by the environment Court um and the<br>hearings for that were in 22 there were<br>a few issues but fundamentally I'm going<br>to say three cuz I'm simplifying this<br>right one was where the nitrates are<br>coming from that was a big issue what<br>was the maximum level that could be set<br>for nitrates in the water to protect the<br>springs and what was the maximum<br>available of water this huge system you<br>know with rivers and aquifers and<br>Farmers have got B holes going down into<br>the aquifer right um uh what was the<br>limit the maximum amount of water<br>available for irrigation so those three<br>I'm going to tell you that were the<br>three broad big issues the source and<br>limit was partic for nitrates were<br>particularly important because that<br>would then determine who had<br>responsibility for making the changes<br>right and yeah so um I'm not going to<br>summarize the whole case then it<br>wouldn't be a nural that would just be a<br>lecture right so I'm just going to pick<br>those three things that I used my<br>research for um the statutary<br>interpretation method the precautionary<br>principle and then the use of Tik to<br>help interpret words so on statutory<br>interpretation one debate was over<br>whether the words protection and<br>preservation in section<br>199 needed to focus only on preserving a<br>current state remember they talked about<br>preserving and protecting Waters in<br>their natural state is that only current<br>or can can you contemplate<br>Improvement right to protect something<br>can you do you are you freezing a state<br>um if you choose a lower nitrate limit<br>than what you've got now because you say<br>oh it's a bit High we need to go lower<br>are you just improving it you're are you<br>allowed to do that and that's actually<br>an issue that on the words of the<br>statute you go oh damn um we need to<br>argue about whether you're actually<br>allowed to even set a lower limit right<br>um so that's a legal issue about the<br>permissible interpretation and in one<br>sense it's an argument about whether to<br>take a narrow literal meaning of<br>preserve and protect that's freezing a<br>state um or an expansive maybe purposive<br>contextual this idea of your protecting<br>the qualities of the springs and that<br>might mean improving them so you can see<br>how two one word can have these two<br>different meanings um so we have rules<br>now um that we had them before different<br>act but uh the meaning of legislation<br>this is a rule everyone has to follow um<br>well certainly<br>judges um must be ascertained from its<br>text and in light of its purpose and<br>context and so Asain from the text that<br>might be the dictionaries you know how<br>we just use the words but then what was<br>it trying to do and what's the wider<br>context and then we have also another<br>section said words must be applied to<br>circumstances as they arise and you're<br>going yeah and right now this means<br>basically that words must simply be kept<br>in step with the times I mean a really<br>simple example sometimes it's called an<br>ambulatory approach that was one of the<br>steps on my slide but a really simple<br>example would be think of the word<br>vehicle um you can have the word vehicle<br>enact and 20 years later it means<br>something it covers a wider range of<br>things than it did when that Act was<br>passed so they weren't maybe envisaging<br>all those new fancy things that we call<br>vehicle later but can we still include<br>them yeah cu the word has expanded its<br>meaning you apply it to circum same word<br>different um Ambit you might say so<br>ascertaining a meaning is not just using<br>a dictionary or applying just a<br>precedent but you need to consider the<br>application to the current context and<br>the policy and purpose right of the<br>legislation as is it as it is now the<br>only previous decision that faced that<br>or that considered that interpretation<br>issue about preserve and protect was<br>from<br>2004 so and they decided on a narrow<br>current state um<br>answer but they had only taken a narrow<br>when you go read it I go oh what method<br>did they use they only looked at<br>dictionary definitions you go oh we can<br>do better than that and we can say<br>they're wrong right so no consideration<br>of purpose and today we've got this I<br>mean they had that back then as well<br>someone should have told them off back<br>then but um uh there's certainly no<br>suggestion you can't that you could only<br>do that you had to look at these wider<br>things so we did we provided that that<br>information about the legislative<br>history the purpose we referred to the<br>current context of fresh water here in<br>aroa the mechan the state of the last 20<br>years and you know the changes and the<br>new mechanisms that are coming to<br>protect it this and the requirements on<br>councils to be following like T all of<br>that context can be taken into account<br>in applying words to today's<br>circumstances so then you choose up an<br>interpretation that bests uphold it and<br>the one that's most consistent so in<br>this case if any water body in aloa<br>could be justified being returned to its<br>pristine state it would be this water<br>body wouldn't it the clearest for water<br>in the world um so another way to look<br>at the interpretation and that<br>definition of current state is Tia um<br>remember the status of the waters as<br>tuna W maybe we're getting too Technical<br>and making a distinction between a<br>slight scientific degradation you there<br>only two two nitrate and ecoli and<br>there's a long list of water quality<br>indicators so there only two out of a<br>long list of say was it about nine um if<br>only two is degraded do we can we maybe<br>give it a general label and still call<br>it in its natural state if Tik suggests<br>that it's still tapoo they're still<br>sacred they're still natural Waters<br>guarded by hwa they're still in their<br>natural state according to Tia right so<br>um can we use that to help interpret the<br>terms well it was great timing the<br>environment Court asked lawyers that<br>great timing we just had Supreme Court<br>decision and transman resources which<br>used Tia to do exactly that a statutory<br>interpretation tool um and there was was<br>also very topical um with the Alis case<br>and changes to legal education but as a<br>result I taught it in RMA we'd had<br>justice Cooper give presentation at the<br>law school I think Jeff mlay hadn't yet<br>given his on that um so but I was able<br>to give not only the ttrl case but also<br>the other cases before it that supported<br>using this um and yes the environment<br>Court did take the meaning of waters in<br>their natural state that was consistent<br>with tianga that enabled that wider with<br>that and the purpose and context we got<br>we're allowed to improve we're allowed<br>to drop the nitrate levels and try and<br>improve those two elements and take an<br>expense of<br>interpretation so final bit is on the<br>precautionary principle in this water<br>see now you laugh at this I um I don't<br>have a I don't have a um a watch or a<br>phone on so I have no idea how it's<br>going I only did a word count that's<br>okay um oh over when and so I started<br>about an now oh sorry I'm actually out<br>of time aren't I but that's all<br>right I'm just do I'll give you the<br>water con and that's funny the vice CH<br>said oh you can take as long as you like<br>go so I didn't know I'd have to actually<br>use<br>that so I first noticed the inclusion of<br>the precautionary principle in one of<br>the Pary grounds of appeal right um<br>technically not an appeal but you know<br>effectively and Loosely see so I<br>genuinely thought the way those those<br>submissions on um precaution was I<br>thought it was garbled completely<br>garbled didn't make sense and I wondered<br>if I was missing something genuinely I<br>thought this is the he's a really good<br>lawyer and I thought nah I'm missing<br>something then I thought maybe it's just<br>that choice of selective precedence and<br>I could address that remember the<br>different options um there was a lot of<br>scientific uncertainty in this case<br>right the biggest uncertainty were the<br>NIT trats coming from the tesman<br>district council had one set of<br>assumptions the applicants got lawyer uh<br>scientists from Neer and other sets of<br>and they took years of argument to try<br>and resolve um and they didn't come to<br>an agreement the environment Court<br>resolved it for them right so that's<br>best left to someone else to elaborate<br>all I wanted to say here is uncertainty<br>in also risk we have risk the sticker<br>for no one knows what level of nitrs it<br>takes to cure all those little creatures<br>right the see no one when the delay no<br>one knows if they're still down there<br>doing their work we get the water years<br>doer what so if we want to continue to<br>receive that W it seems that's not like<br>exactly the kind of wi and damage BRS<br>ordinary princip protect the other so we<br>had that we in part one cuz we have<br>go really statute um and<br>then um and given what i' seen elsewhere<br>Fisheries act that's why I mentioned<br>this and then the confusion in the<br>AR Go swing after your Thor so I can um<br>sorry we detail the purpose his<br>here the cage explaining the different<br>elements threshold threat get M type of<br>action what Supreme Court said what with<br>that go was how<br>mization next had been brought to dat<br>was how it could and how should be<br>retired in this particular case it was<br>very ad you a some search High call and<br>my thought was targeted the all not and<br>um but just 15 pages about footnotes<br>told quite unus sub missions um that<br>with 55 pions yes they up but they you<br>turn off I think that's the think the<br>line was<br>one report said when I saw was 55 Pages<br>by out say it but then I read it it was<br>actually surprisingly readable oh thank<br>you not as well but it was worth it<br>right um I I think might that I think<br>this again those submissions and the way<br>they assisted will be a high fold in my<br>career because um act we giv<br>instead one of the other Cil insist<br>himt what he<br>say<br>good reti<br>now so all that nudy research actually<br>make a difference right the environment<br>Court found it possible to consider a<br>cautionary principle and that found it<br>was essential to findings on light TR so<br>what I did there was but I'm going to<br>skip up this don't read the any but what<br>I got is all these ques from the<br>environment rep about how we have to<br>focus on<br>thean the Ean and we had to do it in<br>last<br>Cru it's not appropriate in terms of<br>thatal allocations be La you know we s<br>us some to certain approach under the<br>other cases however it's a principle<br>intentional law these GRS and and in the<br>absence of being able to deride rely the<br>limits you know um we have to do them we<br>acknowledge submissions spr his West<br>time so um yeah that's pretty much all I<br>have to say about the c i thoughted that<br>Running Oh you might have notic second<br>number the character<br>yeah um there are 877 about and this s<br>her boss and 34 Pages that's report um I<br>got break down if you want to know it<br>but I can just say afforded that to the<br>great on the trust TRS in his reaction<br>was<br>God um but uh but please don't let the<br>size turn north cour CU know was D how<br>this clusion reached a significant<br>decision<br>for and I only just touched the Su in<br>what<br>15 in this case they are the findings um<br>and uh and there are other San findings<br>you should say and you remiss I didn't<br>mention because matter is here the<br>spiritual vales and they found that the<br>spiritual vales were a significant<br>characteristic of all these Springs as<br>the first time time that has been done<br>contion order<br>really all that kind of stuff but exra<br>guid and then so inclusion right in<br>terms of trajectory I'm just about a few<br>anybody but seriously and we just Pro<br>that I did<br>not I did a word cod that told me how<br>many minutes it would take it was not<br>that many so now I talk fast too you um<br>I<br>theed so the other one it's La about<br>skills right the skill of determining<br>what the knoww is and statute CES the SK<br>of the there's also the<br>ofing right and use a white PRS the<br>method's good but you also need to use C<br>Justice here for third service you only<br>need to with all the we can<br>um it's not quite the best but could be<br>positive<br>I without and no<br>fund<br>and springs 10 so this that you can go<br>the faster one that you got 10 so just<br>for the<br>acting and it's my fishal hard and was<br>privilege to speak on my colleagues<br>tonight to acknowledge E's theer<br>contributions and also<br>tonight before I do that I just want to<br>acknowledge people in the audience I<br>would to acknowledge first as I always<br>like to do this students with come um<br>it's a rare it's a rare trip out AC come<br>to teachers all<br>nowadays f is not going to be at all<br>examinable but um the fact that you've<br>turned up show this regarding when she<br>called Kathy and the contribution she's<br>made is so second relation to see um<br>Kathy's friends<br>and colleagues who have come on all<br>tonight I know me I just the privilege<br>of Le properly today<br>they and she's Sly privileged to avoid<br>worth until she get quite AIT<br>Mar in professional terms I also want to<br>acknowledge um K's parents I didn't know<br>her mother obviously but this is a kind<br>of full C event because one of my VAR<br>few stud May my first lecture at the<br>indust was in F John ISS you think and<br>for a slightly conservative maybe still<br>slightly conservative person who mostly<br>SE them<br>shoes te<br>find I would have use a little bit of<br>and most to your<br>Fab but he also convinced me as many<br>people in this room know that my<br>philosophical lities somewhat theed and<br>serious as my career and this<br>philosophically oriented such she<br>like but I also want to particularly<br>acknowledge um has his sons Ruben and<br>James anybody who knows Kathy knows how<br>proud she is she talks to you a lot and<br>how much she loves you and I know this<br>because she did something this year that<br>no say would going do she not only<br>attended a function a stup function that<br>your son was DJ but she descended into a<br>place that no one should ever go the<br>support here son and I think few to<br>still I also just want to a to your<br>daughter anybody who spoken to Kath in<br>the last few years how in the house<br>entirely I think that has a daughter and<br>what you want to off<br>to so one of the purpose of the these P<br>things are twofold assignment made<br>twofold want us to talk very briefly<br>about the nature of the of the vure and<br>this is obviously daunting task in this<br>particular regard because we're several<br>lectures I<br>think but also to talk about e so these<br>are the professor 's DET versus the KY<br>Division and they not necessarily the<br>same thing at all how first talk about<br>Kathy it's talk about Professor ir's<br>lecture so I'm not really very competent<br>to talk about many things SCH but I'm<br>particularly not competent to talk about<br>environment War other than to say that<br>environmental war that Kath has RIS to<br>Niger CL they're very important to me<br>about more in general Humanity courage<br>and help so youve already seen the<br>obvious importance to Cath of community<br>which came what may not been obvious to<br>some of you in this room is to bring to<br>which C K's scholarship tends to<br>understand community in general New<br>Zealand that she is somebody who believe<br>very much that more comes from tin<br>places and from tin Beals and much C's<br>work hasn't been involved in very<br>particular places and see one example<br>Springs but also for example<br>where B where is that she knows H on<br>people and places and some of you might<br>have wondered well how does that relate<br>to interpretation because you some of<br>you on this room with thinking there is<br>nothing more boring what this war D than<br>a statute and kathen and I share<br>Revelation in fact there is nothing more<br>interesting and exciting for the<br>statutes the statutes for me and I think<br>for Cassie are kind of the altimate<br>representation of hum they are<br>representation how fug attempt to create<br>communities through words and they do s<br>a profound way to try a new world and<br>the statutes that we passed and and make<br>about them are our contribution that<br>world<br>creation Kathy's giving me some senses<br>it's not a dry GL T War it is so I keep<br>on saying the many away it's that war is<br>a part of ultimate Humanity it is<br>something that takes the meaning of of<br>words that are constructed particular<br>context and tries to De how they want to<br>fight other conts and how Community WS<br>around those groups and how the<br>communities many ways created by those<br>GRS so war is an active communist active<br>was war is was a matter of Courage k<br>talked about the LA reform division some<br>of you probably never heard about the<br>gome law division used to exist in New<br>Zealand it is Je Jeff ning he knows how<br>poome it was it was one of the great<br>guardians of New Zealand Liberty even<br>before the New Zealand B of Rights<br>Act the only one of the few Gatherings<br>before the new right said but the law<br>division of Justice was run by awesome<br>people and KY I think was very Laing to<br>be a member of was and they took very<br>seriously in the idea protecting was<br>thatc to protect but also that courage<br>to recognize and think you need to be<br>changed but that's not the courage that<br>I think Willers really need because<br>everybody has the courage to think the<br>world should be a better place lawyers<br>need the courage to actually try and<br>make the world a better place and look<br>that's a difficult process because that<br>that is an imp perfect frustrating<br>annoying um she if you want had humility<br>emphasized to you you should try and do<br>mors to it's very difficult<br>you never predict quite what the cons<br>directors are but nevertheless you need<br>the courage<br>diing and so kath's work will FS to it<br>the last is Pope we only do law Le I<br>only do law because I believe that human<br>needs to we make better than our world<br>can be better place to live and kath's<br>giving you that states tonight right<br>that more is ultimately about hope that<br>we can do better that we as a community<br>can figure out better ways of solving<br>our problems than fions the St just<br>using our fire this there is hope and I<br>just want to acknowledge the<br>environmental you need a special kind po<br>at the<br>moment and I acknowledge not just Kathy<br>but my other environmental colleagues<br>some of you may here that they have to<br>teach the reality that things are not<br>going they great but also they need to<br>inspire they have inspired some of the<br>students that actually you as the fishy<br>pop that we Eng make a difference and be<br>other and qu told in doing that so<br>that's the lecture I don't know I really<br>summarized what K said but one of the<br>great things about just you sh what<br>people are really like and that's a<br>really important value all my colleagues<br>are diverse Kathy has her own particular<br>way of doing scholarship ding did his<br>own scholar the other day but that's<br>what's great about my school we have<br>such different Scholars who take<br>different approaches Kathy is much more<br>like towards my<br>scholarship a little bit little bit<br>chaos a little bit of taking the bright<br>brightest sh thing is the m i approach<br>the dean a bit more down the the middle<br>but um that's what gives our Val Val<br>that we have people do just F them<br>shakes I just want to say something very<br>briefly about I see one this about Dean<br>there are many col in this room all of<br>whom would have different stories about<br>K different things they could talk about<br>there might be stories about um how<br>impatient KY might be when we don't pass<br>emotions at faculty meetings there might<br>be stories about your energy or her<br>I but one of the things I wanted to<br>really recognize I think Le haven't seen<br>Le I think she's here hi Le um and<br>picture and I have seen C I don't think<br>many other people maybe his children<br>have seen the word I think about Kathy<br>now is not any of those but is the word<br>compassionate because one of the things<br>odd things happened our faculty is<br>orance to actually left<br>faculty who had been idty Dean for about<br>forever essentially and that left us<br>trying to fill the Gap and so right it's<br>part of that Gap no one can f w Gap from<br>but Cassy for reasons that only known to<br>Kathy decided to set interest a somewhat<br>a becoming Dena students and no academic<br>wants to be the Dena students actually<br>is is perceived to me career death<br>because essentially you spend your<br>entire time trying to work your way<br>through in I want to be very frustrating<br>University roles in order to help<br>students and none of those things I<br>should unfortunately that was like prob<br>well<br>reflected but absolutely credal to the<br>way the it works because without people<br>I care step up in those jobs a lot of<br>good things will not happen in this<br>univers CU actually goals AR really<br>important what are important people who<br>compassion Ure with and I could give you<br>a thousand examples of of K K's passion<br>that role picture you do a thousand more<br>could do another thousand still that<br>students and these University scho<br>universities struggle things go wrong<br>things are perfect but at the stes they<br>do that shut to be honest sometimes and<br>one of our jobs is to see not the person<br>in front of us who in distress or done<br>something wrong but see the person will<br>be when they get through that so and I<br>would just like to acknowledge kath's<br>contribution in that regard because<br>Kathy did that students who were now in<br>lawyers in our community and without<br>Kathy without without Kathy they would<br>not have finished his studies and I<br>think in many ways that's the most<br>profound thing that any of us hands or<br>lives at risk so I would say thank you<br>get that but there's one other person I<br>need to thank you s the r you behind him<br>behind here sorry um there's another in<br>s some confusion was<br>are so I just want to acknowledged I<br>show that this particular career in<br>general over the last 30 years I think<br>it's had a lot of energy not just from<br>Kathy but also a lot of support from her<br>H and I just want to drw on that I know<br>that's particularly true of the last 18<br>months I think that sometimes some of<br>the members of K family may have<br>suggested they should keep on doing job<br>as de students or that maybe she should<br>limit her time maybe she should not<br>spend 20 hours a day doing it but I just<br>want to acknowledge thanks not only my<br>colleagues but also for the students<br>that K C during the time for a would if<br>her and we say thank you to you I and to<br>cathine we're supposed to say old riches<br>that we owning someone to promise that<br>they would do more of the same and<br>there's no point here saying I'm going<br>to hold Kathy to account because you<br>know Kathy every already has many<br>promises to keep and it might actually<br>be our job to help her select some of<br>those<br>promises and maybe rather than telling<br>her to hurry up we might need to help us<br>slow down little bit otherwise thank you<br>Kathy thank you for being our colleag<br>thank you for my students and thank you<br>for tonight</p></main><footer style="margin-top: 2rem; background: #0001; padding:
