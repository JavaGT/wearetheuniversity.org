the<br>here t uh t uh to tanu to tanu and to<br>the house that stands here uh greetings<br>and may you stand forever if that's<br>under any threat and uh we may need to<br>evacuate out of this house please follow<br>the normal instructions for earthquakes<br>drop cover and hold uh exits are outside<br>and I believe we uh gather together um<br>and we remember those that have past in<br>communities ihaka Co Richard Blakey Tako<br>good evening everyone welcome to this<br>wonderful event my name is Richard<br>Blakey I'm Deputy Vice Chancellor for<br>research and Enterprise and I'm the host<br>for this inaugural professorial lecture<br>where we celebrate uh the wonderful<br>occasion of Professor Chris J being<br>promoted to our highest academic uh<br>level at the University um I we'll just<br>give a little brief overview of the<br>process and the the order of proceedings<br>tonight um largely uh to indicate what a<br>significant event it is to those here<br>welcome uh to those online welcome as<br>well uh to be promoted and that's why we<br>put our regalia on that's why we uh stop<br>what we're doing and come and gather to<br>hear about the research and teaching and<br>service the things that have come<br>together in someone's life to to lead<br>them to this uh Peak promotion uh in the<br>University system it's a promotion or an<br>appointment that is not uh taken lightly<br>that uh clear criteria have to be met of<br>sustained Excellence uh and sustained<br>Excellence is uh is critical and<br>Leadership across the three key areas of<br>academic life across teaching across<br>research and across service and the<br>purpose of the IPL is to allow the<br>professor to profess on those areas uh<br>should they wish to partic choose a<br>particular area or focus on some things<br>and in particular it's usual to<br>acknowledge those that have helped and<br>support uh the team effort that's<br>required this to be achieved what we<br>will see uh so the order of proceedings<br>is that I'll um say a few words and then<br>introduce Professor Linley Anderson as a<br>as the uh acting dean of the den school<br>of medicine to give a more formal<br>introduction so you know more formally<br>some of the qualifications that Chris<br>brings Chris will give her IPL uh<br>Professor Tim Stokes will uh summarize<br>and give us a v of thanks and um Megan<br>given as the PVC and Sciences has a very<br>important task of us inviting us all to<br>the staff club for the fellowship that<br>will follow um I don't want to say too<br>much but I'm I'm um really pleased to be<br>officiating at this IPL for you Chris<br>because I've got to know you through one<br>of your key University Service roles I<br>know from your track record that your<br>commitment to teaching is very high<br>including publishing uh in in and about<br>teaching and education and medical<br>research uh that your research is very<br>strong collaborative uh focused on<br>outcomes and impact but uh your service<br>to the university I've come to know<br>through your role as associate team<br>postgraduate in the division of Health<br>Sciences a job that is huge a job that<br>has involves such a wide range of of<br>disciplines and programs and sitting on<br>the graduate research committee with you<br>I know what a what uh care for the<br>students well-being and outcomes for the<br>students you bring to that role so for<br>that service thank you and uh it's great<br>to be here with you in person because<br>for those of you online uh you're going<br>to be in the position that we are<br>usually in of seeing um Chris on a on a<br>TV monitor because Chris usually Zooms<br>in from her rural home to join us at<br>those meetings so<br>um uh as well as thanking you for for<br>that service I thank you for all your<br>other service and um as I ask Linley to<br>come and give you a more formal uh<br>welcome and introduction I would like us<br>to all all joined together in<br>congratulating you and me offering those<br>congratulations on behalf of the<br>university for such a an awesome and<br>well earned promotion so thank you very<br>much<br>kiar<br>tenoa um no<br>my Linley Anderson TOA so welcome<br>everyone uh present and to those who are<br>attending online my name is linlee<br>Anderson I'm the ing dean of the denan<br>school of medicine and it is my role but<br>also my great pleasure to introduce you<br>to Professor Crystal J and to tell you a<br>little bit about her so first of all I<br>want to acknowledge some rather<br>important people in the room her<br>sister-in-law Trish bites her<br>grandchildren Luca Eva and Leo Mo her um<br>unfortunately her son couldn't be here<br>that's Kenny and but also attending<br>online some important people people are<br>Russell and Vivi in Taiwan and Mark and<br>Jess in Wellington so welcome to you all<br>now to tell you a little bit about Chris<br>so Chris's parents um Jill and Ivan<br>Smith uh um lived in uh well many places<br>but her mother was a social worker and<br>her dad had several careers one as a a<br>gold and coal miner and the other as a<br>presbyterian minister so<br>Chris first came to denan when her<br>father came to University to study to be<br>a presbyterian Minister then they went<br>back to night caps and I looked up night<br>caps has a population of about 300 I<br>think um so Chris was admitted to the<br>University of otago in<br>1991 as a 28-year-old mature student to<br>do a ba she studied<br>fulltime as a single parent with three<br>small boys uh no mean feet so she was<br>invited to do honors at the end of her<br>second year and majored in Social<br>anthropology she was then admitted to<br>her PhD completing in<br>1998 she first worked in the university<br>in the injury prevention unit uh and<br>then got a job as a lecturer in the<br>department of general practice she was<br>the first medical Anthropologist to be<br>employed in a medical school that's just<br>incredible<br>um in in New Zealand this meant she<br>bought a particular anthropological<br>perspective on clinical practice and<br>qualitative research and she bought that<br>lens to the Department of general<br>practice and Rural health and to the<br>denan school of medicine just some of<br>the areas she's worked in youth in Asia<br>this is her research youth in Asia<br>prevention of age related workplace<br>injuries and Rural health and well-being<br>she's made a substantial contribution as<br>as um Richard said to the postgraduate<br>program in the department of general<br>practice going on to be um become the<br>associate Dean postgraduate for the<br>division of Health Sciences this medical<br>Anthropologist thrived in medical school<br>uh in the medical school and the<br>department of general practice and Rural<br>Health appointed her head of Department<br>from 2012 to<br>2016 this was the first non doctor<br>appointed as head of Department of<br>general practice and the first woman so<br>congratulations um just she's also been<br>a journal editor a conference organizer<br>a mentor of uh women's staff and<br>academic staff generally she's had lots<br>of different roles in the department the<br>division The Wider University and<br>internationally<br>she's currently in Phase retirement and<br>has been working<br>part-time uh in her out of work time she<br>loves to go hiking and ebiking and<br>four-wheel driving around central atago<br>she loves a good DIY project too but her<br>she says her enthusiasm uh kind of<br>outstrips her<br>competence um she also has one small<br>overindulged dog so it is my very very<br>great pleasure to welcome professor J<br>Crystal J to the stage please join with<br>her uh can you hear me all right thank<br>you thank you for that um very kind<br>introduction both Richard and Lindy now<br>before I begin there's just a few people<br>um let's see if I<br>can get that<br>going there we go few people that um no<br>longer that I'd like to acknowledge so<br>uh you can<br>see uh that's my uh late collaborator<br>Tony Egan my um partner Peter Bristo my<br>father here and here we were making that<br>box um my stepmother Pat Bel camp and my<br>uh stepfather who only died a fortnight<br>ago so there are a few other people<br>unable to be here um tonight as ly<br>mentioned My Three Sons but also my<br>mother Jill Tapper and um my<br>mother-in-law elel Bristo who is 97 and<br>doesn't travel very easily so when I was<br>21 I was married with three very small<br>children and living in the small rural<br>Southland town of winon I had no idea<br>then that I Would One Day become a um<br>professor at the University of Vago so<br>I'm just going to wander down memory<br>lane for a for a minute<br>my parents settled in night caps as<br>Lindy said um in 1973 so as you can see<br>night caps is a very little town very<br>picturesque my father was to be the<br>Presbyterian Minister there and my great<br>great great grandparents had farmed<br>there about 100 years earlier I was 10<br>years<br>old so at that time nightcaps had a a<br>thriving um a thriving horse training<br>and racing community and there were<br>almost as many horses in the town as<br>people and so we used to ride it was an<br>old trainer called Johnny Sinclair who<br>would let us ride his horses but anyway<br>when I turned 11 my parents had the<br>precence to give me a horse of my very<br>own and my horse this is her here shaba<br>that's me when I was about 11 or 12 she<br>had no fancy Providence she came from a<br>small herd that ran Wild on the one of<br>the nearby Hill Farms a local horse<br>trainer had her for about 3 days and<br>then she was<br>mine I spent every every hour of my<br>adolescence were not in school on<br>Horseback and my horse was spiteful<br>contener willful stubborn prone to<br>biting bucking and bolting she used to<br>frequently break out of her small<br>Paddock former posy of other breakouts<br>um these were race horses that she<br>inssite to RI as she galloped through<br>the town and she that Stampede over the<br>the night caps golf course which of<br>course didn't make either us very<br>popular with golf club members or horse<br>trainers she would walk perilously close<br>to Bar Drive fences I had many ripped<br>gum boots she had sit down Crossing<br>creeks in the summer which um I learned<br>to just sit on on top of her instead of<br>getting off she'd shy imaginary dangers<br>but she was mine and I absolutely adored<br>her my parents never suspected that I<br>faced death every time I rode her and it<br>never occurred to me that I should<br>perhaps mention this to them I've often<br>wondered to what extent all of those<br>near-death experiences and believe me I<br>still have the scars formed the adult I<br>became I learned to face the unknown and<br>certain death head on<br>and an apt metaphor for life um I think<br>became when your horse throws you off<br>you pick yourself up off the ground<br>check all movable parts are still<br>working catch your horse get back on and<br>just get on with it and the other<br>important um memory I wanted to share<br>was was um our our holidays school<br>holidays were always spent adventuring<br>camping and tramping in Central ataro<br>and because my father was the<br>Presbyterian Minister we could always<br>take the holidays off somehow and um so<br>this is mostly around gleni but my<br>father grew up there and about the time<br>we moved to night caps we acquired a um<br>Family crib this this place here um in<br>black and white and U that's me and a<br>friend on Horseback and uh and here<br>that's also me but you can't really see<br>me<br>um so this was near Paradise in glenor<br>and it became our holiday base so most<br>of our school holidays were spent<br>exploring the head of the lake and my<br>father's beloved 1942 Will's Jeep here<br>here here and um here as you can see it<br>always had about a million kids hanging<br>off at this was in the off-road but<br>before the days of seat belts and they<br>were always um you know heap of kids<br>perilously uh in danger of losing<br>legs so where it couldn't go we hiked<br>and I consider myself very fortunate to<br>have had these experiences and looking<br>back I think I can see that my academic<br>career has benefited from many of the<br>values instilled U from this childhood<br>notably I think prag ISM and<br>perseverance and her desire to get the<br>job done so fast forward s years from<br>being a winon housewife and I was living<br>in Golden Bay at the top of the South<br>Island as a solo mom on a benefit with<br>three young children I drank a lot of<br>old mot cider back before it became<br>trendy and when it was cheap and truly<br>terrible and I had a lot of fun playing<br>with my my three kids and playing in a<br>pretty awful band and um feel free to<br>have a<br>giggle so what became apparent to me<br>during that period was that with no<br>skills or qualifications I could look<br>forward to doing seasonal ulted work and<br>earning the minimum wage for the rest of<br>my life so in 1991 I moved my young<br>family to denan and I was admitted to a<br>ba at um university of atag L he's<br>already said I'm major in social<br>anthropology with a minor in religious<br>studies and following my honors year I<br>EMB backed on a PhD and so 33 years<br>later here I am delivering an IPL so it<br>as customary and ipl's um to not to note<br>major influences on your academic career<br>and I would like to acknowledge my<br>father Ivan Smith again um he reinvented<br>himself several times over his adult<br>life he left school to work in the gloi<br>sheelite mines at the age of 14 to help<br>support his nine younger siblings he<br>gained a grade a mechanic certificate<br>before buying and working a quartz gold<br>mine at Skippers and then he returned to<br>glenor as a roading contractor all<br>before he was<br>25 and he was responsible for a large<br>chunk of the gleno road and I have<br>another photograph to show famous<br>photograph famous in the family but this<br>was actually also the advertisement for<br>I can't remember what um breed of diesel<br>um the caption read God makes mountains<br>and man moves them so um anyway and um<br>an accident resulting in<br>life-threatening injuries and a long<br>Rehabilitation resulted in a total<br>change of Direction one of his friends<br>at at his funeral said this was akin to<br>um Sir Colin me announcing that the PE<br>his rugby career that he was going to<br>ditch rugby to take up ballet and so in<br>this case Dad shifted his family to<br>denan to study Greek and theology before<br>we moved to night KS as the Presbyterian<br>Minister and when the parish went broke<br>in the 1970s he turned to fixing<br>Machinery at the Ohio colines and<br>retired as the foreman of the<br>underground Tradesman he sort of done a<br>full circle so the major academic<br>influence during my years as a student<br>was the brilliant Anthropologist<br>Professor Peter Wilson now I tried so<br>hard to find a photograph of Peter and<br>this is one from my um from my my uh<br>graduation day which I managed to locate<br>he's become incredibly elusive The<br>elusive Peter Wilson but he wrote<br>several highly influential and engaging<br>books which you can see there um I have<br>a feeling that he was actually the the<br>inaugural professor of social<br>anthropology but his classes were just<br>riveting and thought-provoking and I've<br>got really fond memories of fourth year<br>classes held under the cherry tree on<br>the lawn in front of the clock tower in<br>Spring and Sue Carell if you're watching<br>this you'll remember those too because<br>we were in the same class now Peter's<br>anthropology had extraordinary depth and<br>width and he kindly agreed to be my<br>primary PhD supervisor the lesson that I<br>learned from Peter was the things we<br>take as the most ordinary and mundane<br>are actually the most extraordinary and<br>deserving of anthropological attention<br>Peter encouraged me to go widen in my<br>PhD thesis which explored the<br>intersection of medicine and religion<br>over human suffering and the responses<br>to to it so medical anthropology of<br>course is underpinned by assumptions<br>that Affliction is universal across the<br>existence of humanity and that all human<br>communities and societies have responded<br>to this through the development of<br>knowledge competencies in specialist<br>roles I was intrigued by something I<br>read in an an Anthony gens book um I<br>can't remember which one now but it<br>suggested that medicine and religion are<br>both sociocultural responses to The<br>Human Experience of Affliction and<br>suffering<br>and the aims of both to restore<br>equilibrium comprise this response so I<br>conducted ethnographic research<br>exploring the meanings of suffering and<br>help-seeking strategies of four groups<br>one was Christian Pentecostals one was<br>the local Congregation of Christian<br>Scientists uh there were secular medical<br>doctors and Christian medical doctors so<br>long story short and perhaps<br>unsurprisingly individuals um<br>understandings were related to their<br>understandings of self- deity humanity<br>and embodiment and of course aligned<br>with broader explanatory Frameworks of<br>their affiliations I developed the<br>notion of embodied Integrity as a<br>framework that encompassed both material<br>and non-material understandings and<br>experiences of embodiment and wholeness<br>but I never went very any further with<br>this very interesting work and the hard<br>copies of my PhD thesis were destined to<br>prop up the computer screens on my<br>office desk and some of you will<br>remember that so anyway in 1999 brimming<br>with useful energy and enthusiasm I was<br>appointed as Lindy said to a lecture<br>position in the then Department of um<br>general practice and I've always<br>described myself as a medical<br>Anthropologist but over the years I've<br>sometimes wondered if Health researcher<br>with a background in anthropology is a<br>more accurate description and this is<br>because I've often worried if I've<br>traveled in a different direction to<br>developments and my discipline of origin<br>not least because I don't teach in an<br>anthropology program and nor am I I'm<br>not confident that I'm up to date with<br>the latest literature in fact I know I'm<br>not and as I've grappled with my my<br>occasional crises of disciplinary<br>identity I eventually realized that it<br>is my anthropological lenses which is<br>the result of anthropological training<br>that has the greatest impact on the way<br>that I approach research how I read and<br>interpret data and the conclusions that<br>I<br>draw as Michelle Fuko observed<br>disciplines represent ways of knowing<br>seeing and interpreting the world and<br>the theoretical framework that informs<br>my own anthropology and underpins my<br>work as an orientation to social<br>construction as<br>that's combined with a commitment to the<br>critical interpretive medical<br>anthropological projects of embodiment<br>and political economy that's quite a<br>mouthful um but my own theoretical<br>lenses reflect the anthropologists<br>sociologists and social theorists of<br>course that had the most impact on me<br>notably Clifford GS um Pier bouru Nancy<br>sheeper Hughes Margaret lock Arthur<br>Kleinman and of course Michelle<br>Fuko so this orienting theoretical<br>perspective it's very much reflected in<br>the fact that my researchers<br>predominantly reliant on qualitative<br>methodologies and this is a great segue<br>into the imagin anthropological<br>imagination which is what I want to talk<br>about next as an undergraduate I<br>remember being enthralled with Marilyn<br>st's 1987 article entitled out of<br>context the persuasive fictions of<br>anthropology it's a fabulous title and I<br>can't remember what year we did that and<br>it might have been third or fourth year<br>probably but amongst other things that<br>introduced me to the idea that<br>anthropologists in their anthropologies<br>are situ uated within generational or<br>cohort Horizons and of course this is<br>reflected in their theoretical tool cuts<br>and at this time a younger generation of<br>anthropologists um including Paul<br>rabenau George Marcus and Michael fiser<br>had been reflecting deeply on the<br>political Association of anthropology<br>with colonialism and its role in<br>constructing the other the discursive<br>nature of the concept of culture<br>fundamental to anthropology had been<br>recently exposed as an exercise an<br>interpretive and constructionist fiction<br>and ethnography the distinctive<br>methodology of anthropology is a highly<br>problematic constructive practice angst<br>ridden discussions aided by the very<br>affordable boxed why known as<br>FC at frequent potlucks of my social<br>anthropology cohort reflected these<br>burning theoretical and methodological<br>issues what was the point of social<br>anthropology was ethnography morally and<br>ethically justifiable did the data we<br>collected mean anything at all beyond<br>our own imaginings was it ever possible<br>to get out of One's Own Way were we<br>simply perpetuating Colonial<br>epistemological<br>violence now according to Jennifer<br>goetti Forin um Imagination is integral<br>to culture and to<br>cognition without imagination creativity<br>and Innovation would be<br>impossible David sneath and colleagues<br>observed in 2009 that the social<br>imaginary which is attributed to<br>philosopher Charles Taylor has become<br>increasingly trendy in Social<br>anthropology not least because it<br>provides a substitute for the vexatious<br>baggage associated with the term culture<br>and this social imaginary is evident in<br>Clifford gs's 1973 claimed that culture<br>is the stories we tell ourselves about<br>ourselves and of course for social<br>Anthropologist the notion of the social<br>imaginary is delightfully opaque and<br>indeterminate because imagination is<br>Central to the tasks of<br>anthropology following GS anthropology<br>itself could be described as the stories<br>we tell about our and others and in the<br>process of doing so we're actively<br>constructing both ourselves and the<br>others that we<br>research the imagination is Central to<br>understanding the entanglements the<br>disentanglements and the positionality<br>implicit and reflective research and the<br>analysis and interpretation of<br>ethnographic and qualitative data<br>requires creativity and playfulness and<br>intuition which are all imaginative<br>qualities according to George Marcus and<br>Michael fiser the central Endeavor of<br>anthropology is cultural critique and<br>it's underpinned by the understanding<br>that all culture is humanly constructed<br>eloquently phrased by GS as webs of<br>significance that we ourselves spin I've<br>always loved this<br>quote even though it was written a long<br>long time ago um seite Mills described a<br>sociological imagination that<br>encompasses the relationship between<br>individuals communities and<br>sociohistorical contexts so what's an<br>anthropological imagination<br>according to Nancy sheeper Hughes one of<br>my favorite anthropologists in medical<br>anthropology the anthropological<br>imagination orients around the critique<br>of medicine and medical practices around<br>Health subjective illness experiences<br>and the articulations of these within<br>cultural political ecological and<br>societal contexts Harry Walcott who's<br>another of my faves framed<br>anthropological critique in terms of the<br>difference between looking and seeing<br>reflexivity and engagement of course are<br>the key characteristics of the latter<br>kind of vision bingin and Hazard argue<br>that the anthropological imagine<br>imagination is an attitude of critical<br>reflection towards common sense which<br>brings us back to um my old supervisor<br>Peter Wilson in learning to see<br>anthropologically the ordinary and the<br>taken for granted become problematic so<br>that one's own life is no longer<br>sensible but peculiar and unique it's<br>the result of global and local<br>historical political and economic Etc<br>processes and I was hoping to capture<br>some of this in my um IPL poster so here<br>you can see that I'm holding a posy of<br>flowers and these are wild flowers that<br>have been picked along a popular cycling<br>track near C where I live and they tell<br>many different stories all of which<br>illustrate and provoke imagination so<br>first of all I find them aesthetically<br>appealing and their presence in the<br>landscape is emblematic of the Pala of<br>central atago that I'm familiar with and<br>very fond of and of course because the<br>photographs and black and white you're<br>going to have to take my word for this<br>and use your own<br>imaginations um it's the blue of Viper<br>bu gloss the white of fever F white<br>clover wh hound and<br>yo purple of th and bua the pink of<br>sweet Brier and mow the red of red spian<br>and the yellows and Golds of meline<br>evening primrose and Californian Poppy<br>and they also represent the medicinal<br>tool kit imported by European Colonial<br>settlers to AOA and thus continuity with<br>what Arthur Kleinman might have<br>described as the repertoire of several<br>European folk Health um care sectors but<br>at the same time these pretty flowers<br>are visible reminders of colonization<br>and its impacts the violent reshaping of<br>the AR landscape through farming and<br>Mining and the construction of infra<br>infrastructure such as Railways and of<br>course the emblematic sweet Bri and time<br>which cover the central ataro Hills<br>today are the feral descendants of early<br>capitalist ventures in the<br>area so next I want to move on and draw<br>on my research record to perhaps to<br>illustrate or perhaps expose the<br>application of my anthropological<br>imagination through my academic career<br>so in preparing for this lecture I've<br>assembled my research which covers a um<br>bewildering array of Horizons I've tried<br>to organize it into thematic categories<br>which is itself was a highly imaginative<br>exercise and I apologize because these<br>slides are quite busy although I'm only<br>going to elaborate on one or two<br>examples from each category but I need<br>to say all also that while I use the<br>term imagination to describe the<br>analytical and interpretive work of<br>anthropology there no way implies that<br>the lived and embodied experiences of<br>research participants are not real so um<br>so the first really strong theme is<br>imagining clinical education and um<br>actually you'll see in these that where<br>I have um where I have a uh these These<br>are students um who student research<br>where I have been supervisor so that's<br>what that means a strong thread running<br>throughout my academic career concerns<br>medical<br>education and the question that's long<br>interested social scientists and medical<br>Educators alike which is what are<br>medical students really learning in<br>medical<br>school arguably the set of or the<br>purpose of medical curricula is to<br>produce the kinds of doctors that<br>Society wants and you can read any set<br>of undergraduate medical course learning<br>objectives to get a sense of that it's<br>well documented that all learning<br>environments expose students to<br>unofficial informal and frequently<br>Undeclared normative practices that<br>might or might not be congruent with the<br>messaging of the formal and official<br>curricular and you're likely familiar<br>with the term hidden curriculum which<br>connotes this phenomenon so in medical<br>education the hidden curriculum is said<br>to Encompass unofficial but implicit<br>expectations unintended learning<br>outcomes Behavior that's modeled by uh<br>teachers and clinicians medical student<br>culture and other things as well as well<br>my late former colleague Tony Eagan was<br>a well-recognized expert on clinical<br>education and I worked with him on<br>several projects and the first of these<br>in the very early naughties focused on<br>medical Educators and it showed that<br>medical Educators or at least the ones<br>who were motivated to participate in our<br>study use role modeling to counteract<br>the negative messages that they thought<br>students were receiving through the<br>hidden curriculum this included not<br>taking consent seriously enough informed<br>consent or being disrespectful of<br>patients through<br>lateness um disc courtesy or<br>inappropriate humor and in this study<br>participants identified an explicit<br>tension between the institutional goals<br>and the formal learning<br>objectives of the medical school and the<br>clinical settings in which medical<br>students do much of their learning so<br>the key finding here was that the hidden<br>curriculum equips students with values<br>attitudes and behaviors that are aligned<br>with the medical profession which they<br>will join after graduation and this led<br>to a study using ethnographic method in<br>which medical students were shadowed on<br>Ward rounds by Dr Kelby smithan who<br>would go on to conduct his own PhD<br>research on discourses of general<br>practice that students encounter during<br>medical school and their influences on<br>vacational choice so this study showed<br>that teaching and learning opportunities<br>were often missed because of course<br>service provision and patient care are<br>necessarily the priority for clinicians<br>students often felt excluded on Ward<br>rounds and they expressed bivalence<br>about their educational value they<br>didn't consider themselves to be a<br>member of the team when they felt in the<br>way but they did when they felt useful<br>and were included in team discussions<br>about patient care and students reported<br>that they learned more effectively on<br>smaller educationally focused World<br>rounds that incorporated bedside<br>tutorials and opportunities to practice<br>examination skills so these were the<br>findings that were presented in the New<br>Zealand medical journal and somewhere<br>else um I've forgotten what but the<br>really interesting stuff was published<br>in anthropology and medicine and also<br>and health where we used Fuko social<br>theory to show that medical schools are<br>disciplinary blocks that medical<br>curricular represent normalizing<br>Technologies of self an in vengas<br>communities practice model describes a<br>mechanism by which students engage with<br>the professional Technologies in the<br>clinical workplace so very briefly um<br>communities of practice often form<br>organically around a shared Vision or<br>purpose and they're distinguished by<br>Insider shared values and practices we<br>turn this communities of clinical<br>practice or cocp and we showed that<br>these are potent vehicles for students<br>internalization of the normative<br>professional behaviors and values that<br>lead them to become one of the medical<br>tribe one of us and Google Scholar tells<br>me that this work's been cited over 500<br>times which um for those of you who are<br>not anthropologists it's pretty<br>extraordinary so anyway there<br>reassurance that's been of relevance now<br>the second thematic that I wanted to um<br>draw on is imagining Primary Health Care<br>and general practice<br>and in this theme I want to focus on a<br>project investigating general<br>practitioner obstetric gpos for<br>short around 2008 Dr dor Miller who is a<br>colleague in the department of Women's<br>and Children's Health invited me to be<br>part of a project exploring the decline<br>of general practitioner OB Obstetricians<br>following a change in maternity care<br>funding model in the 1990s that saw GPO<br>numbers plummet now prior to 1990 gpos<br>provided most of New Zealand's maternity<br>and obstetric care but by 2004 only<br>about 5% of pregnant women registered<br>with a GPO as their lead maternity um<br>care provider so at that time there was<br>a midwife shortage and the Ministry of<br>Health was interested in attracting GPS<br>back to maternity care to help alleviate<br>this so we set out to find what<br>distinguished the few gpos still<br>providing maternity care from those who<br>had<br>withdrawn our participants considered<br>that the Contemporary LMC model isolated<br>the maternity care providers and this<br>made them vulnerable particularly in<br>rural areas it also wasn't adequately<br>funded enough for GP participation so<br>those GPS who were still providing<br>maternity care viewed it as an integral<br>part of general practice and they often<br>did workarounds in the form of under the<br>table local care uh shared care<br>arrangements with other maternity<br>providers so the key finding was that if<br>GPS to be were to be enticed back to<br>maternity care the legislation and<br>funding would need to support shared<br>maternity care the findings these were<br>the findings that were published in the<br>Journal of Primary Healthcare and also<br>in the Australian and New Zealand<br>Journal of Obstetrics and<br>Gynecology however the published the<br>article published in medical<br>anthropology called tossing out the baby<br>with the bath water which I have to say<br>is my favorite title of all of my<br>Publications it drew on Michelle um Fuko<br>social theory to show how the landscape<br>of maternity care is made up of Truth<br>games generated by the disciplinary<br>blocks of the maternity care professions<br>and stakeholders revealing the highly<br>moral nature of the of the political<br>economy<br>of maternity care so specifically the<br>former gpos who participated in our<br>study harbored deep grievances relating<br>to the loss of obstetrics from the<br>previous Cradle to grave philosophy of<br>general practice and the policies that<br>at that time encouraged competition<br>between maternity care providers in this<br>terrain contested and competing<br>discourses were evident around the<br>physiology and the management of<br>pregnancy and childbirth what's normal<br>and or natural what constitutes risk how<br>should it be managed and what<br>constitutes safe clinical practice and<br>most importantly who should deliver<br>it another strong theme throughout my<br>research career is aging and I want to<br>pick up on a relatively Recent research<br>project funded by um a university of<br>atigo research<br>Grant in 2018 the news media highlighted<br>various crises in rural Health Service<br>availability and and access and<br>Workforce shortages in rural regions um<br>as I mentioned previously Midwifery was<br>one of these Fiona Doan Noble who was<br>then a colleague in the department of<br>general practice and Rural Health um now<br>working at curtain University and is a<br>rural researcher with a nursing<br>background invited myself<br>um and I she she was part of the<br>research team with myself and associate<br>professor Lincoln Wood in the department<br>of management uh and we were able<br>assisted by Judy McHugh but we set out<br>to explore how health was maintained and<br>how health need were met in an isolated<br>small atago<br>community Co intervened and by the time<br>we' actually completed our data<br>collection and Analysis I think we<br>realized that the data were telling<br>several stories that were much more<br>complex than what we' anticipated on the<br>face of it participants described Health<br>in terms of well-being and satisfaction<br>with rural lifestyle and Community<br>participation but we were struck by<br>participants descriptions of the<br>articulation between Community<br>environment and individual abil<br>and this attracted us to the jeel<br>thematics of asset-based<br>community and Jennifer pry ruger's<br>Health capability framework the freedom<br>this the um Health capability frame<br>framework is uh in a nutshell the<br>freedom to choose to be healthy and the<br>ability to achieve this<br>um being dependent on contextual issues<br>and motivation ability previous choices<br>of course and the available<br>options reality is many of you are aware<br>of is frequently described in terms of<br>deficit comparisons to urban populations<br>in the asset-based approaches of Jake<br>Matthew and Cunningham sought to remedy<br>this by focusing on the ways in which<br>local rural assets can support Community<br>agency autonomy and empowerment and our<br>study participants referenced Health in<br>terms of well-being that was strongly<br>supported by the local assets of the<br>community and so this included Community<br>Support networks landscape livestock<br>family history rural lifestyle and<br>values and they also talked about<br>capabilities required to be rural fit in<br>particular mobility and physical<br>functioning however behind participants<br>accounts of well-being L several<br>potential threats and this led to the<br>imagining of a third thematic latent<br>precarity while precarity has been<br>typically defined in terms of employment<br>and income security we identified<br>several forms of precarity that lured in<br>the background of even the most<br>successful rural lives and<br>livelihoods these included latent<br>economic precarity particularly for<br>Farmers this was the ups and downs of<br>global markets weather events such as<br>the one we've just<br>had latent social precarity described<br>the potential um impacts of social<br>isolation for Rural dwellers of all ages<br>while latent functional precarity<br>concerned potential declines in fiscal<br>capabilities and was particularly<br>associated with aging grineer and<br>colleagues had observed that precarity<br>is disempowering it can also have a<br>domino effect so if a latent form of<br>precarity becomes actual or experienced<br>precarity then a lifestyle can become<br>unsustainable very quick very<br>rapidly aging adds additional forms of<br>latent precarity and it exacerbates<br>existing rural latent precarities for<br>older<br>adults however latent precarities can be<br>managed and experienced precarities<br>mitigated and we concluded that this<br>depends on the balance of individual<br>capabilities and Community assets so we<br>confirmed what others such as norak<br>keting and the Canadian context have<br>already said if we want rural<br>communities to be good places to grow<br>old in then National rural health and<br>aging policies need to be better aligned<br>with mesolevel regional policy and with<br>Community level<br>initiatives now the concept of latent<br>precarities is a good segue into the<br>last project that I wanted to talk about<br>this evening which is imagining<br>microplasma Bas so this is what you've<br>been waiting for<br>Jeff if high levels of stress and mental<br>health issues of course well documented<br>within the New Zealand Health New<br>Zealand agricultural sector and in 2017<br>the latent precarity of contagious stock<br>disease was actualized for farmers in<br>several regions including Southland<br>atago and Canterbury in the South irand<br>and the form of an outbreak of<br>micoplasma bovis now this is an exotic<br>bacterium that causes mystis and<br>arthritis and adult cattle and pneumonia<br>and<br>calves and in May 2018 the minist for<br>primary Industries NPI for short um<br>announced the implementation of a<br>biocurity intervention with the aim of<br>eradicating in Bas from New Zealand and<br>Professor Duan Noble invited me to<br>collaborate on a project that would be<br>funded by Lottery's health research<br>exploring the psychosocial impacts of<br>the outbreak on affected rural<br>communities in Southland and ataro so<br>the team included myself and Dr Jeff<br>noler another Anthropologist um who's<br>here today and Mark Brian a Veterinary<br>epidem ologist in Southland and this<br>project offers a really neat<br>illustration of the ways in which<br>multidisiplinary not just<br>anthropological imaginations are<br>reflected in the stories that become<br>rarified in academic<br>Publications initially and while we<br>waited for the outcome of our Lottery<br>health application we followed the Ovis<br>drama as it unfolded through the news<br>media like the rest of New Zealand but<br>this interest translated into a summer<br>student project conducted by Dr Caitlyn<br>Boyce and the resulting<br>publication revealed the story of ovas<br>is told through the news media so here<br>farmers were portrayed as Ordinary<br>People desperately trying to save their<br>livestock fighting a microscopic foreign<br>viral Invader at the same time as<br>fighting with the structural violence of<br>the bureaucratic regulatory apparatus<br>administrated by MPI through the Ovis<br>eradication<br>program the lotteries Health Project<br>showed that farmers endur disruption to<br>the seasonal rhythms and of farming an<br>income because of the embova outbreak<br>but the processes of the eradication<br>program itself exacerbated the traumatic<br>impacts of the outbreak in fairness this<br>was the largest biocurity intervention<br>ened to date in New Zealand and it was<br>acknowledged by MPI to be a massive<br>learning<br>experience so this is what we reported<br>in the first submitted manuscript and we<br>could have left it there but we went on<br>to tell several other stories that<br>reflected team analysis sessions and the<br>interpretive synthesis of our<br>disciplinary imaginations we drew upon<br>hamas's system and life world framework<br>to explore the collision between Paddock<br>and policy around the highly contested<br>application of a clause from The primary<br>sector recovery policy which guided the<br>intervention specifically that recipient<br>recipients of crown compensation for<br>losses that are the result of the<br>actions of the crown this this referred<br>to stock culls some Farmers lost entire<br>herds more than once so farmers<br>recipients should be quote no better or<br>worse off than others who are not<br>eligible for compensation end quote and<br>a data except in this particular<br>publication describing how a team of MPI<br>cleaners spent days cleaning screws<br>removed from a contaminated cowshed so<br>the farmer wouldn't be better off<br>instead of buying a box of new screws<br>for the refit which is much cheaper in<br>case you were wondering went viral<br>throughout the New Zealand news media so<br>he Mar's framework work enabled us to<br>tell a story about the colonization of<br>the farm life world by bureaucracy and<br>in short the imposition of Bureau<br>bureaucratic policy and prce over Rural<br>and farming<br>pragmatism we also Illustrated how<br>cattle beasts embodies several forms of<br>moral Capital within the moral economy<br>of the farm an adaptation of pbor Jew's<br>symbolic forms of capital according to<br>anarie mole the farm is a moral economy<br>because animals require care and in<br>order to survive and thrive being a good<br>farmer stock productivity and herriage<br>breeding all reflect forms of moral<br>capital and the economic worth of these<br>forms of moral Capital was fiercely<br>asserted by Farmers over and above the<br>paper value of a stock unit and<br>compensation claims and similarly we<br>realized the participants were<br>describing their Journeys through the<br>eradication process in a way that evoked<br>Ben ginip and later Victor tuna's<br>descriptions of liminality and a<br>nutshell liminality consists of three<br>three phases so the first is separation<br>from normal life Andor social status the<br>second is a period of<br>sequestering apart from one's community<br>and the third is a reintegration back<br>into society with a new identity or<br>social status so each phase is often<br>marked by ritual and in the case of ovas<br>it was um certification by NPI officials<br>that provided a passage across these<br>thresholds so<br>the eradication program um showed a<br>progression through three distinct<br>phases for impacted Farmers each<br>associated with ambiguity confusion and<br>uncertainty an official separation from<br>usual farming routines was triggered by<br>the suspicion of ovas on a<br>property farmers were sequestered with<br>this somewhat alarming signage a fix to<br>their fences while they waited for test<br>results stock calls standown periods and<br>then compensation claim outcomes an<br>official release from the Intervention<br>Program and permission to resume farming<br>business was the Final Phase however<br>while the liminality of ovas was<br>anchored on the Farm's property<br>boundaries the lional space of Bas<br>lingered long after the official exit of<br>the farm from Lial status and Farmers<br>carried forward the trauma of the<br>experience and an ambiguous social<br>status not least having to repair their<br>reputations of being a good farmer and<br>stock<br>Trader so turning our attention to the<br>Frontline work interviews we showed that<br>local veterinarians experienced moral<br>distress during the Early Intervention<br>days when veterinarians who were working<br>with the local farmers were sidelined by<br>the uh eradication Pro program and we<br>also showed that Frontline workers were<br>were working within a boundary space<br>brought into existence by the outbreak<br>and which was characterized by<br>instability chaos and flux while meeting<br>their various operational briefs within<br>the space Frontline workers broken<br>several things these were knowledge and<br>information resources and M materials<br>but they also broken relationships<br>between the Intervention Program and the<br>community specifically for the benefit<br>of their farmer clients who were often<br>also<br>neighbors and this um led to Frontline<br>workers describing their in between<br>positioning as somewhat ambiguous<br>because they carried quite ambivalent<br>status quite ambivalent status in the<br>eyes of farmers and NPI so farmers<br>frequently view them as agents of the<br>bureaucracy MPI viewed them as local<br>add-ons in a briefing paper to the then<br>Minister for primary Industries we<br>offered a set of recommendations for<br>implementing biocurity interventions<br>that have appeared in subsequent MPI<br>documents so specifically seeking<br>solutions from within rural communities<br>that included Regional and<br>interprofessional networks and the<br>formation of a standing army of rurally<br>based experts in various Fields who can<br>be called upon to help shape process and<br>policy for the next inevitable biocurity<br>incursion and this work's already<br>received about 50 citations in only<br>three years at this point I want to say<br>something about the conept of moral<br>economies um which has emerged very<br>strongly as a meta theme threading<br>through much of my research while I<br>prepared this lecture in my early<br>research career This Thread is more<br>implicit and covert for example<br>exploring the moral standpoints of<br>sufferers of what was known as<br>occupational overuse syndrome in the<br>early u0s and the health professionals<br>that treated them in the last 10 years<br>or so it's become a more persistent and<br>explicit thematic exploring forms of<br>moral Capital that circulate within<br>moral economies um so that's a a slide<br>that shows some of that work I've talked<br>about Ovis but there are many other<br>projects here that I haven't mentioned<br>uh it might seem like stating the<br>obvious to say that Health Care is<br>deeply moral for a start as EA kinman<br>has<br>observed it involves the the recognition<br>of the need for care in others and the<br>capacity to respond to this need in New<br>Zealand equity and fairness within the<br>healthcare system are well recognized as<br>human rights and therefore moral issues<br>vulnerability and deservingness living a<br>healthy lifestyle being a good patient<br>are all forms of moral Capital that<br>citizens can trade for health care and<br>the theoretical framework of moral<br>Capital has been much more fully<br>developed and extended by a former PhD<br>student of myself and and Professor<br>Peter krampton Dr Patrick BOS in a<br>recent social science and medicine<br>publication so I have a few concluding<br>remarks to make<br>learning to see anthropologically is<br>intrinsic to the process of learning<br>anthropology in 2005 I wrote that within<br>the dispersed and reflexive discourses<br>and practice of modern postmodern<br>anthropology there are no equivalence to<br>clinical guidelines only the experiences<br>interpretations and critical theoretical<br>reflections of other situated<br>anthropologists working with an enormous<br>variety of settings fields and<br>traditions and interlocking communities<br>of practice our own anthrop ological<br>imaginations are the primary instrument<br>in our disciplinary toolkit by which to<br>come back to gats we tell stories about<br>ourselves and others because any story<br>about others is of course at the same<br>time a story about ourselves and in the<br>process we imagine ourselves we imagine<br>others and we imagine our own<br>anthropologies my own career is<br>reflected a particular moment in time in<br>New Zealand<br>anthropology and I think medical<br>anthropology in New Zealand will<br>continue to evolve as it reflects the<br>anthropological IM ing of contemporary<br>and future cohorts of medical<br>anthropologists as Marilyn strin noted<br>in 1987 the fictions that anthropology<br>creates through the process of<br>interpreting and theorizing in order to<br>understand complex social phenomena must<br>in turn be critically examined as the<br>socially constructed frames and<br>representations that they are so what<br>does an anthropological imagination add<br>what's its value in a medical school in<br>a Health Sciences faculty or division<br>what I've observed in teaching health<br>professionals mostly General<br>Practitioners as students developing and<br>flexing their own anthropological<br>imaginations during my courses applying<br>anthropological interpretations to<br>things they've previously taken for<br>granted and using this to challenge<br>their own clinical students to take a<br>wider and more critical look at the<br>truths of biomedicine to consider the<br>standpoints and knowledges of others to<br>be reflexive and to situate their own<br>practice within broader political and<br>moral economies I think the student<br>evaluation that I was most chuffed with<br>came from a GP teacher who wrotes<br>something along the lines of Chris<br>taught me that everything I thought was<br>real<br>isn't so adding anthropological<br>imaginations to the disciplinary<br>imaginations of health professional<br>academics adds enormous value to Health<br>Sciences research the benefits can be at<br>a clinical consultation level medical<br>anthropology has contributed enormously<br>to improving cultural competency in<br>clinical settings and to our<br>understanding of what it's like for<br>patients for clinical students and<br>health professionals and as Al kinman<br>observed what matters to them has also<br>contributed enormously to exposing and<br>explaining Health inequity and the<br>structural violence of Health Systems<br>and the global forces that perpetuate<br>these as Nancy B observed in 1992 an<br>anthropological imagination is also<br>about imagining radically different<br>human<br>possibilities Professor Katherine Pand<br>brick in 2018 argued that by Framing<br>conversations about health in terms of<br>quote moral values political power<br>structural vulnerability<br>historical legacies clinical care and<br>ecological relationships end quote<br>amongst other things medical<br>anthropology challenges disciplinary<br>imperialism it's not entirely clear to<br>me if Panter brick was referring to the<br>disciplines of anthropology or medicine<br>but the sentiments certainly applicable<br>to both she writes that quote medical<br>anthropology sits at the intersection of<br>the humanity social sciences and<br>biological sciences seeking to transform<br>our understanding of what matters to<br>people in terms of health and well-being<br>end quote and this is why medical<br>anthropologists and other social<br>scientists belong in a medical school<br>and in Health Sciences faculties and<br>divisions all academics bring their own<br>disciplinary imaginations and<br>theoretical toolkits to research and I<br>contend that when a research team has an<br>anthropologist or two or any kind of<br>social scientist for that matter the<br>collective team tokit was vastly<br>expanded the recognition of patterns<br>both descriptive and latent within any<br>data set is always dependent on the<br>disciplinary imaginations brought to<br>bear on it the stories we tell through<br>our research outputs not only reflect<br>our imaginings but also develop and<br>extend our disciplines in<br>multi-disciplinary research teams the<br>potential exists for analytical and<br>interpretive synergies that are far<br>greater than the sum of the team's<br>individual<br>parts so I want to finish for think by<br>thinking My Three Sons whose childhood<br>was largely dominated by my studies<br>ironically by the time I finally<br>finished and got a pay a real paying job<br>that' all left home so um I also want to<br>say thank you to the many research<br>students uh some of whom are here today<br>that I've supervised uh over the years<br>for all the conversations that have<br>enriched my life because supervision has<br>been the favorite part of my job I<br>always loved it I've learned so much<br>from all of my students um thank you<br>very much to all my past and present<br>colleagues and workmates in general<br>practice and Rural health and The Wider<br>university community and the division of<br>Health Sciences to my parents and all my<br>friends there's too many of you to think<br>individually but you all know who you<br>are and lastly thanks to everyone for<br>attending my IPL either by person or by<br>video link and particularly my<br>grandchildren who probably have better<br>things to be doing on a on a Thursday<br>evening thank you very<br>much t ctoa uh I'm Tim Stokes I am<br>professor of G practice and the head of<br>Department of G practice and Rural<br>Health M SK bson and it's a real<br>pleasure to be able to end Chris Dre's<br>inal lecture by offering a few words<br>about significance of her<br>IPL I think the first thing I'd like to<br>say is anthropological<br>imagination Chris brought<br>her anthropological imagination to<br>research across a broader areas of<br>Health Sciences her body of research<br>that you can eclectic but it is held<br>together by a strong unified theoretical<br>perspective on the anthropo<br>imagination um expressed through a<br>number of areas for example clinical<br>practice moral<br>economies um G and Prim health care and<br>I just want to reflect on three of those<br>drawing on Chris's TV<br>Chris is a distinguished Anthropologist<br>she has<br>published at least she has published<br>certainly three papers which have H<br>indexes of about 100 one paper nearly<br>300 that for someone working in the<br>social sciences is extremely high praise<br>multiply that by maybe 10 or 100 if<br>you're working in quantitive research<br>the first of those papers published in<br>health in 2009 was on communitive<br>clinical<br>practice and that's just one of a number<br>of papers because Chris has built a<br>program of research on Community clal<br>Practice over a number of years<br>involving some of the people here and<br>also I think most importantly who's not<br>here who passed away a few years ago is<br>Tony Eagan who many of us remember<br>well second<br>paper I think the Google Scholar hit<br>rate is nearly 170 it's called what is<br>spirituality published immortality again<br>Chris has worked with many colleagues<br>over the last few years to develop a<br>strong research program of work around<br>spirituality working with many people<br>collaborative in atago Richard leagan<br>for example and also Jess young who is<br>here on a s of<br>dying and the third area of work that<br>she worked with which Sheed to was work<br>with people like me people like General<br>Practitioners<br>okay and she commented on the body of<br>work that she done in this field very<br>well and a number of people here I see<br>an Eastwood here who I think that your<br>masters of general practice with Chris<br>many years ago but I also want to<br>reflect on one particular paper and this<br>paper is number three it has a citation<br>made of 110 it's a paper just by Chris<br>Dre it's a published in the journal<br>Family Practice in 2002 and in 2002<br>family practice was one of the house<br>ranked journals of Primary Healthcare<br>internationally it was called if I<br>recall quotative research and family<br>practice and the importance of that<br>paper were twofold the first importance<br>in in the literature was that Chris<br>delineated the way that quty research<br>was used not only in general practice<br>departments but also in public health<br>meing departments and publica wasn't<br>actually used in medical with n<br>Department back in those days because if<br>you go back to the 1990s and 2000s there<br>was very little qualitative research<br>done in medical schools and to do it was<br>actually seen a mly deep<br>interactivity so Chris's achievement<br>should be seen as being part of over the<br>last 20 30 years of transforming the<br>field so it is now normal to think<br>qualitatively it is now normal in some<br>states to think sociologically and<br>indeed<br>anthropologically that paper emphasized<br>the importance of theory in building<br>ideas and also emphasized the importance<br>of working with health practitioners not<br>just GPS but other partitioners to<br>actually use theory in their own<br>research qu research and down I en Rich<br>the field and because has been usually<br>influential in<br>that and the last thing I want to say is<br>reflect on that paper from a personal<br>level because I was completed I in 2002<br>I just finished a PhD in the UK I worked<br>with a medical sociologist and it was<br>primarily using goffman's work on<br>interactionist sociology to explain<br>difficulties between<br>patients I read ch's paper and thought<br>this great really interesting it was one<br>of these papers that was building the FI<br>for us to work with social scientist in<br>general practice Department also some of<br>the work that Chris has supervised I<br>think it might have been we niel's work<br>was around removing patients and my own<br>work had been on removing doctor's<br>patients from Doctor's lists so we<br>corresponded Chris very kindly offered<br>me some comments on one of my<br>spiritually papers which I look back<br>today and saw I did actually acknowledge<br>you um on some model building which was<br>really light and on the personal note<br>that contact with Chris to come and run<br>the samon M department on a long holiday<br>2005 and then out the blue in 2013 a<br>head hunting firm asked me if I would<br>like to come and take on the job I have<br>now the chair of general practice I<br>remember my work with Chris and I<br>remembered the work that this department<br>did and I won't get into that story but<br>it is the reason I'm<br>here so I would like to close really by<br>thanking Chris for your work as a<br>colleague and I haven't said and I<br>haven't even s them out all the support<br>you've given me over the years and<br>others over the years in
