nothing like a room full of<br>teachers to be on time and in their<br>seats and in the front rows and engaged<br>yeah great audience to have um I'm<br>Amanda wolf it is my complete pleasure<br>to be here um chairing this day we've<br>got some fantastic speakers and um<br>little bit of food lined up for you um<br>so we'll just kick off um just to<br>welcome you to the pipa Campus of tahang<br>AA information for the<br>access<br>great um the um dean of faculty of<br>business and government um asked me to<br>uh create a day around the theme of<br>preparing students for University in an<br>AI world and so what I've done is just<br>to by the way of by way of kicking us<br>off is just to break those three parts<br>down a bit um the first bit when I think<br>of preparing students in this era I see<br>it as having four component parts<br>there's the the knowledge content the<br>the foundations and the fundamentals<br>that we usually think of going along<br>with teaching and learning um but<br>increasingly I'm focusing on the<br>learning process it's all good well and<br>good to have some content in your head<br>but actually being able to get and find<br>what you need when you need it is<br>increasingly important and along with<br>that is the awareness of our students of<br>themselves and the contexts in which<br>they live and work and are moving<br>into um we're really excited here at the<br>University to be taking a couple of<br>really fresh areas of focus on what's<br>coming in what we're doing while we're<br>here and what's going out again the<br>transition into University are really<br>important here and at all universities<br>where we are really concentrating on<br>what actually we need to do to help all<br>our Learners be ready for what's coming<br>next a lot of that philosophy has been<br>built into our refreshed Bachelor of<br>Commerce degree which we are piloting as<br>we speak this summer and will be<br>launched um fully in 2025 with a<br>reconfigured uh core program we've got a<br>brochure in your bags to explain more<br>about that um and then of course the<br>transitions out of University with what<br>I prefer to call a world ready graduate<br>as opposed to a work ready graduate um<br>and we've set some really ambitious<br>graduate attributes for um these<br>students as they leave our University um<br>and actually we've been we've been<br>reminded to keep focused on these by the<br>other universities who've who've<br>approved our design of this new degree<br>so we really want our graduates to to<br>not only um be able to find analyze data<br>and make sense of it but we want them to<br>um be able to incorporate TTI and<br>everything they do in their work and<br>their um<br>investigations um to really critique the<br>interrelationships between business and<br>government taking advantage of our<br>location here in Wellington and actually<br>when you think about it business with in<br>the absence of awareness of government<br>is going to be a restricted perspective<br>and similarly um government is heavily<br>in the U I was going to say the business<br>of helping business but you know what I<br>mean um government is really involved in<br>the infrastructure of our economy and<br>our society so that's a really important<br>and um potentially unique factor of what<br>we are producing in our um in our degree<br>and we've got a whole bunch more um<br>graduate attributes that we're<br>interested in I won't read them all um<br>but really Preparing People to make a<br>positive social impact um to um apply<br>critical and creative thinking<br>collaborate communicate and all of those<br>sorts of<br>things um in the context of the<br>transition of Learners into University<br>we've undergone um a fairly lengthy<br>series of consultations internally using<br>uh amazing resources from other<br>universities who've also focused on this<br>and really thought about what are our<br>first year learning principles um this<br>is a a draft uh but courtesy of the<br>owners of this process um they've been<br>really they've encouraged me actually to<br>share it with you and we welcome any<br>feedback on this um and I won't go<br>through each of these sections in detail<br>but we're trying to pick out the nonn<br>knowledge content f focus of University<br>to really focus on the whole person to<br>take the time to welcome them in make<br>them feel part of this huge place by<br>finding where they fit where they belong<br>finding their people finding their<br>identity groups um guiding them<br>welcoming them then there is a how we<br>focus on getting the content that we are<br>introducing in that first year um suited<br>to the transition pedagogy theories so<br>that we're relevant so that we're<br>scaffolding so that it's developmental<br>so that right from the start we're<br>engaging Learners in reflecting on<br>what's Happening so this isn't the old<br>model of they come in a line of people<br>that we see passing through the years we<br>dump stuff into them and out they go the<br>other end it's a much more engaged and<br>interactive process and I'll have a<br>little bit more to say about that more<br>specifically um in the later part of the<br>of the program and of course um we're<br>really taking our pastoral code of<br>conduct obligation seriously in being<br>proactive in well-being and support<br>instead of<br>reactive um the refreshed Bachelor of<br>Commerce degree has two 100 level<br>courses which is a shift from seven in<br>previous years and we then staircase<br>into two at 200 level and a Capstone at<br>300 level the distinguishing features of<br>the becom as I mentioned already the<br>integration of business and government<br>but we also focus on Grand challenges so<br>that students are able to think about<br>business disciplines in the context of<br>something they're passionate about be it<br>climate change or plastic waste or um<br>cost of living or whatever it is to<br>really enliven our subjects and to help<br>them find the ones that are most<br>interest of most interest to them and<br>maybe discover complimentary areas of<br>study so that they become more rounded<br>um graduates when they when they come<br>out alongside this we offer um uh tools<br>for study and work in business and<br>government this is not a remedial course<br>this is actually helping them step up<br>from what they already have in terms of<br>study and work um skills and tools into<br>an enriched environment which we then<br>intersect with what they're learning in<br>the grand challenges course so um we're<br>more than happy to chat with you further<br>about this um or follow up um with us at<br>any<br>time and finally we've got in the AI<br>World um and we'll be focusing on that<br>quite a bit today but just to say that<br>um obviously we've got the the outward<br>looking um features of moving into a<br>changed environment so how is AI going<br>to change the envir environment of work<br>that our students are moving into<br>therefore within our catchman in the<br>University how are we helping to develop<br>those new<br>competencies and then um through that<br>process ensuring that the human our<br>Learners are well equipped to make sound<br>decisions in that AI world so getting<br>that balance between the human and the<br>Machine happening is one of our main<br>objectives wastage of my time babbling<br>up here I would like to introduce my<br>colleague um Maya calich from the school<br>of Information Management um Maya is<br>doing some absolutely amazing work um<br>and it was it's really a delight to<br>welcome her here to share some of her<br>thoughts about as it says here<br>information in daily life business<br>government and society and for our folks<br>joining us online if you have any<br>questions for any of us we are<br>monitoring the um the the chat and we<br>will try and get to as many of those as<br>we can or follow up as um need be folks<br>in the room um again hopefully we'll<br>have some time for you to um interact<br>you<br>then uh welcome to the audience in front<br>of me and to the people online it is my<br>pleasure uh to speak to you I usually<br>speak either in front of the group of<br>students um that are studying<br>information related topics or a group of<br>experts who are investigating and<br>researching uh information related<br>topics so you are my first teachers<br>audience I'm very uh very honored to<br>speak in front of you um as I Was<br>preparing for uh this lecture I wondered<br>what on Earth made me suggest such a<br>huge and complex topic such as<br>information in daily life business<br>government and Society so just a<br>disclaimer I cannot possibly exhaust or<br>discuss all the complexities of the<br>topic uh but I hope to raise some of the<br>challenges we are all facing and maybe<br>spark some discussions that you might<br>take and then um develop further um<br>among yourself or with your students um<br>so my name is Maya kich I'm an associate<br>professor in the school of information<br>management and I teach and research<br>issues related to information management<br>but also information Behavior<br>information experiences so I take this<br>broader holistic view of how information<br>impacts our lives and um I have been in<br>Academia for the past 20 years studying<br>information science which was a<br>fascinating Journey because it enabled<br>me to observe not just my own<br>interaction with information but also<br>how information world is changing how<br>technology is influencing the way we<br>communicate the way we learn the way we<br>work uh the way we create legacies for<br>the for the future um so through that<br>lens I will talk about information and<br>information World recognizing that AI is<br>just a part of um that world significant<br>part and we are definitely facing a<br>paradigm shift uh but still um<br>information world that has been uh<br>complex and complicated for many decades<br>and um as time goes by and I had a<br>conversation with uh James um our<br>student who will talk later uh how it<br>will be interesting to see over time uh<br>what aspects of AI will become<br>normalized over the years so something<br>that we still find challenging uh and<br>questionable what will become normalized<br>what will become part of our normal<br>daily routine what parts we will uh just<br>discard and what new challenges will uh<br>emerge<br>um so when we talk about preparing<br>students for um university uh in an AI<br>world for me it is also preparing<br>students to um um to be able to apply<br>and live information ready uh in today's<br>world so through then that lens I will<br>talk about um information in daily life<br>business government and Society but<br>before I start I would just like you to<br>take um a minute and think about about<br>from the moment you woke up this morning<br>I won't ask you to share that with me so<br>just think about for yourself what were<br>some of the pressing information needs<br>you had how did you go about them what<br>were some of the information systems<br>apps devices you used um and what were<br>some of the challenges and complexities<br>or feelings that accompanied that<br>interaction with information and systems<br>you had today<br>so just maybe 30 seconds for you to<br>gather your<br>thoughts there's quite a lot of murmur<br>in the room I hope the audience online<br>is considering this as well so if you<br>had um what we can call a typical<br>information day um You probably woke up<br>and relatively soon um grabbed your<br>phone either to check the weather<br>forecast either to check messages from<br>your family or friends either to check<br>hopefully not your work emails that<br>early in the morning um or to maybe do<br>some um housekeeping activities paying<br>the bills ordering food uh or any other<br>activity uh maybe you also did not feel<br>ready to be overloaded with information<br>so you stayed away from news you stayed<br>away from opening work emails uh you did<br>not want Google and other services to<br>suggest anything for you today so maybe<br>you wanted to um safeguard that first<br>hour of your day uh for some other<br>activities for yourself or with your<br>families whatever you did uh it included<br>interaction with information um then if<br>you took the train or drove to the city<br>or even walked you were probably<br>surrounded by information at every<br>corner either the posters Billboards<br>catching conversations from people<br>passing you by um or anything else that<br>came from the environment so maybe<br>awareness of the weather today<br>um nature clouds trees Seasons but also<br>what may have informed you are probably<br>the memories information triggered so<br>maybe you remembered a November day 10<br>years ago maybe like myself you are not<br>from New Zealand so November is always<br>time when the first snow starts falling<br>um so maybe you had those um embedded um<br>information related memories so your<br>environment was full of uh information<br>that you gathered through various senses<br>so not just through physical um or<br>digital uh items or objects as we like<br>to call them uh all that is something we<br>call the red thread of information this<br>is the concept information Scholars<br>often use to describe that<br>omnipresent uh information thread that<br>we through the structure to the fabric<br>of our lives uh that connects<br>devices<br>environments um<br>infrastructure thoughts cognitive<br>aspects um communication with other<br>people so the Red Thread that actually<br>uh goes through our lives and connects<br>all these examples that I talked about<br>today um but something to keep in mind<br>here and I will discuss uh this presence<br>uh of the red thread of information in<br>our life in more details uh something to<br>keep in mind is that information can't<br>be easily defined I won't even go into<br>the discussion what is data and what is<br>information and what is knowledge<br>because if you get a group of people who<br>love and study information it is<br>inevitable that they will fight about it<br>in in about 30 seconds uh but how we<br>perceive and Define information can be<br>quite different from one person to<br>another so just keep that in mind uh as<br>we go through the following<br>points um I also forgot to mention if<br>you have any questions or examples of<br>your own write them down and I will uh I<br>won't talk at you for 45 minutes so I<br>will finish a bit earlier to give you<br>time to ask questions share um your own<br>experiences and examples uh or maybe uh<br>raise something with your colleagues or<br>if nothing else just to have that longer<br>morning tea which we are all looking for<br>and also for people online feel free to<br>put it in the chat box and um hopefully<br>Li will tell me uh what those are um so<br>the first point I wanted to discuss<br>today uh is about informed decision<br>making so we can all agree that we need<br>information whether we want information<br>or not we needed to make informed<br>decision and this is relevant for um our<br>students in their studies for our work<br>for our family for our communities<br>environments however what informed means<br>is different from one person to another<br>and it also very much depends on the<br>value uh we place on information<br>so whether you or your students are kind<br>of um people who will go and extensively<br>search for information look for<br>Different World Views and World points<br>compare them contrast them before you<br>are ready to make a decision or you are<br>more likely to go just with the you know<br>first few hits that um Google returns or<br>for example asking um alexar Siri to<br>give you an answer and accepting that as<br>informed enough to make a decision um<br>that differs from one person to another<br>what is relevant for our students<br>especially in in today's world is uh to<br>be aware of that so we don't always need<br>to change the way they look for<br>information and the way they make<br>decisions but they need to be aware of<br>the consequences different ways of<br>decision making um has in relation to<br>the information they sought and they<br>they applied in their own<br>lives um that decision making as I said<br>depends on the value and um it can um<br>support various uh aspects of our daily<br>Liv so decision- making for example<br>which train to catch um what clothes to<br>wear or something far more serious in<br>relation for example to health aspects<br>uh or uh nutrition or anything else um<br>as I said because we live in this uh<br>complex world uh where information comes<br>from many sources uh it is also<br>important to keep in mind uh that<br>informed decision making can vary from<br>one situation to another and from one<br>day to another um however it is also<br>connected to uh the roles and<br>responsibilities we have in our lives<br>and for that reason um one of the<br>exercises I always like to do uh with my<br>students is to get them to journal and<br>to think about their information needs<br>and their uh interaction with<br>information systems and how that<br>affected their ability to um not just<br>make a decision but also um conduct a<br>particular role whether that's a role of<br>a family member or role as a student in<br>your schools or in our universities or<br>as a worker in whatever place they work<br>in uh but also responsibilities so if um<br>you are seen as a person who has<br>expertise in a particular area what does<br>that mean in terms of your<br>responsibility to find the right<br>information to value that information<br>and to inform other people so to build<br>information literacy uh skills of others<br>that is also a useful exercise to do so<br>to ask students uh to go and teach an<br>information literacy skill to somebody<br>uh else in their community and then<br>observe um possible differences and<br>challenges that come along that um so<br>that red thread of information weaves<br>through decision making but also helps<br>us to fulfill our roles and<br>responsibilities uh however it also<br>helps us to create or maintain or change<br>uh our perception of our identities for<br>many people in a aroa um identities are<br>complex and made of multiple belongings<br>to different groups and it is<br>interesting to observe uh in our own<br>personal lives how information supports<br>or hinders that identity so what is in<br>our immediate um personal space of<br>information that speaks about our<br>identity that speaks about our belonging<br>to a particular culture um information<br>that might be written in multiple<br>languages if we are living in multiple<br>language household or information that<br>helps us on a daily basis to pass on uh<br>knowledge and customs and traditions of<br>uh groups we belong<br>to uh it is also important so if uh you<br>are facing situations where people have<br>Dementia or any other um particular<br>circumstances where those identities may<br>be challenged or fractured how you can<br>use information space and interaction<br>with uh systems and devices to help uh<br>maintain that identity to help bring<br>information back uh when it's most<br>needed there's a lot of conversation<br>around smart houses um internet of<br>things that and other um interconnected<br>uh information related activities that<br>can uh support your daily lives and some<br>of us might be very enthusiastic about<br>that idea uh some of us might not want<br>anything that<br>um that is based on surveillance or um<br>taking our personal information even if<br>it means offering personalized<br>Information Services uh but it is<br>something to consider so whatever um<br>part of Technology we bring into our<br>lives how is that support ing our<br>information environment we also need<br>information um to unleash our<br>creativity and with AI uh this is an<br>interesting conversation now nowadays a<br>couple of days ago I had a meeting uh<br>with a colleague overseas and um this<br>colleague is in his 70s and we had a<br>strongly worthy discussion about whether<br>or not we should include AI generated<br>images uh in a book chapter we were<br>writing and I had some ethical and<br>aesthetical<br>um concerns just trying to look for the<br>right word um and he called me old<br>fashioned oh how oldfashioned you are<br>you don't want to use Ai and it can it<br>can be so creative it can do far better<br>things than I ever could um and I think<br>the point he was trying to make is I'm<br>older than you and I'm embracing this uh<br>AI world I'm embracing opportunities and<br>I was like um let's let's hold on for a<br>moment and let's discuss possible<br>challenges so the question when<br>especially when working with students is<br>also how to help them they will probably<br>most of them naturally Embrace um<br>opportunities that comes uh that come<br>with deel development of Technology but<br>also how to um bring that awareness to<br>their mind that uh there are always<br>challenges and even when you are using<br>something and I'm not saying that you<br>shouldn't um there are many many<br>opportunities we will come to them later<br>as well but uh how to use them<br>responsibly so responsible AI is is a<br>very uh big an interesting topic to<br>teach at the moment so just a little<br>note on the creativity<br>side and then information that supports<br>records and<br>Legacy um we all need recordkeeping in<br>our lives whether to provide our<br>identities in various um official<br>environments um for example when we are<br>moving countries that can be a<br>particular challenge uh to prove and to<br>maintain records of your identity um<br>health records interactions with Health<br>Systems these are all examples uh where<br>we need to think about what portion of<br>all the vast amount of information we<br>are creating and producing today is<br>actually a record a record of what and<br>what do we want to keep um working with<br>students uh it is always an interesting<br>discuss discussion when you talk about<br>relationships that form and then um<br>possibly break apart so you are creating<br>all those photographs maybe exchanged um<br>social media posts emails text and so on<br>and then after a relationship changes<br>the nature or ends what do you do with<br>that record of a relationship so that<br>that's a good example that brings<br>complexities of information world uh to<br>that personal um level of connecting<br>with people uh and living our lives uh<br>and also Legacy in terms of what we<br>leave behind do we um just create and<br>pile up information and then say yep I<br>have um a full email account of<br>communication I have many hard drive uh<br>discs or uh cloud storage spaces full of<br>information that I created is that a<br>legacy so how can we use information to<br>tell uh stories of our lives and also to<br>Cate stories of of our lives uh we do<br>some of that uh on social media but um<br>the personal space of information is far<br>more intertwined and<br>complex um and that inevitably brings me<br>to digital footprint and afterlife I<br>know students learn a lot about digital<br>footprint in uh schools but one of the<br>aspects of it is um something we don't<br>talk enough about and it is related to<br>death and dying and uh how information<br>uh persists long after we are gone so<br>what happens um in today's world where<br>digital immortality is not a science<br>fiction scenario so there are uh<br>services that can train AI based on your<br>information to digitally resurrect you<br>to uh serve as a replica or as a<br>surrogate of what you were as a person<br>while you lived and this is a<br>significant challenge for society<br>because um developments are going ahead<br>of um ethical and psychological research<br>that that can actually estimate<br>consequences of interactions with such<br>dead Bots and um replicas of um real<br>people and this is a challenge for uh<br>those who die and then their identities<br>persist in digital space and weave with<br>the life of Living but also for those<br>who are exposed<br>um to such information whether they want<br>to or not usually when I start talking<br>about this topic that somehow the<br>atmosphere gets colder in the room so I<br>won't talk about this a lot but I'm just<br>um bringing this as one example of that<br>red thread of information that continues<br>uh even after um a person is<br>gone uh and also as a final point for<br>this slide is intentional versus<br>accidental collections so we I think<br>uh unfortunately still have that<br>inherited mindset that just because<br>something is digital the space is<br>unlimited and it does not have<br>consequences if we just pile up and pile<br>up things uh but it does so when we talk<br>about information we need to keep in<br>mind sustainability we need to take keep<br>in mind that maintaining all these<br>storage spaces also has consequence and<br>uses energy and costs um the but also uh<br>us as individual people so thinking<br>about how to promote that mindset of<br>deleting is really necessary in an<br>information<br>Ag and the reason why I talked about all<br>these things through personal<br>perspective is uh because this is<br>something that will underpin um the way<br>students study at our University and the<br>lovely slide um Amanda had about all the<br>aspects uh of um values and all the<br>aspects that underpin those values at<br>our University actually had these<br>elements in it so how can students use<br>information to fulfill their role uh<br>while studying working and having uh<br>Families how they can make informed<br>decision how can they interact with<br>University Systems which are sometimes<br>challenging on their own uh and actually<br>make good use of them uh make them work<br>and support their learning rather than<br>fighting with the systems and trying to<br>squeeze their learning um in in within a<br>space that might not work for them this<br>is particularly true for um neurod<br>Divergent students or um any of those<br>people whose minds work in a different<br>way so um for example when you have a<br>screen and I I had many examples of<br>students not submitting assignments just<br>because they could not see the submit<br>button in system so uh switching<br>conversations from something is wrong<br>with you if you don't see the submit<br>button to how can we make make this<br>system better and work for um diversity<br>of<br>people um but it is not just for<br>individuals uh this is also similar for<br>personal and business contexts so<br>business contexts also need information<br>to make good decisions um to support<br>different roles and UH responsibilities<br>within businesses so access to the right<br>information but also restriction of<br>access um comes in relation to those<br>roles and responsibilities uh businesses<br>that uh use information to make clear<br>what their identity is and to unleash<br>creativity of their um<br>employees um are likely to be more<br>successful businesses in today's world<br>um records so particularly organizations<br>that must comply with public records act<br>uh need to think about which records<br>they need to maintain uh those<br>organizations and businesses uh that are<br>likely to<br>um fulfill official information uh<br>requests how can they maintain their<br>records in a way that will help them<br>find the right information at the right<br>time make sure they are not giving<br>anything sensitive away um and use those<br>records to demonstrate compliance but<br>also to maintain their um businesses in<br>disruptive<br>types um and also um Legacy aspect is<br>Rel there as well so for example<br>businesses change you know they are shut<br>down they are merged so Legacy aspect uh<br>that relies on information comes through<br>in that context as well um and also<br>digital footprint of a business is<br>something uh I think very interesting<br>for students to study so to look at web<br>pages social media presence uh of<br>various companies and the trails they<br>left online um over for example the last<br>decade if they are a business that<br>existed for um so long so uh thinking<br>about that digital footprint um it is<br>easy to find connections between<br>personal and business context and if<br>students have awareness of their<br>personal context they're more likely to<br>have awareness of the business context<br>as well so when they come as workers um<br>they will be to use amand words word<br>world ready uh not just work ready so uh<br>there are connections that can then<br>strengthen both personal uh and work out<br>of<br>things uh I also wanted to use<br>government as an example through that uh<br>but maybe at the moment it's it's a bit<br>challenging um story however governments<br>also<br>um rely a lot on information to<br>demonstrate their relevance in society<br>to uh show their roles and<br>responsibilities uh and also to shape uh<br>the future of our information societies<br>through their policies and um through<br>their program so interaction between<br>business and government and individuals<br>uh particularly in the area of various<br>information policies and how those<br>affect our lives um is is a really<br>interesting example to think of so<br>anything related to privacy surveillance<br>um digital literacy digital inclusion<br>intellectual property basically every<br>government policy is in some way<br>information points so if you need<br>examples to um work through uh with<br>students and to think about that<br>omnipresent aspect and nature of<br>information in today's world uh it is<br>interesting to read through some of<br>those policies through that information<br>lens um increasing complexities in<br>today's uh world are inevitable and as I<br>said some uh of these will slightly<br>diminish as we go on some of these will<br>increase and if you look at information<br>environment in the past 40 years we've<br>seen ups and downs in in uh many aspect<br>of information World um it it is a<br>changing technological landscape and<br>because of that changing social and uh<br>legal landscape as well although um a<br>regulatory environment tends to go a bit<br>slower and is very often reactive rather<br>than proactive when it comes to tackling<br>some of these um Technical and societal<br>challenges uh this is inevitably<br>intertwined space uh so when we think<br>about um how a new piece of technology<br>or a new digital environment or a new<br>system that we are using in our study<br>and work uh how that uh will impact our<br>work we also need to think about what<br>will change how will people's behavior<br>change what will our students and our<br>colleagues do differently so AI is a<br>wonderful example of um who embraced<br>what and who didn't how did we um use AI<br>for example to support and um increase<br>our productivity but also what is the<br>price we are paying so how to maintain<br>this balance so it is always a balance<br>between um technological social and<br>legal<br>landscape<br>um we we pay a price we are all<br>experiencing information overload so how<br>many of you were in a situation where<br>you went to check something on your<br>phone and by the moment you opened it's<br>Google suggested a news article to read<br>or you saw a message from your friend or<br>from a family member and you know couple<br>of minutes later you completely forgot<br>about what you wanted to do I think this<br>is our daily experience and it happens<br>to everybody so how can we increase our<br>liter literacy skills uh to help us cope<br>um to help us manage that feeling of<br>being um overloaded with information<br>when information becomes a burden<br>because that has consequences so you<br>might not spend as much time as you<br>initially intended on finding the right<br>information uh if you're bombarded with<br>it all the time so we need to develop<br>strategies to deal with information<br>overload uh cognitive and effective side<br>of it on a daily<br>basis uh for those people who use<br>multiple languages in their uh daily<br>life and environment um that information<br>overload can come from even more sources<br>and be even more complex so this is also<br>something to keep in mind and maybe work<br>on developing strategies to uh to cope<br>with information overload in those<br>particular linguistic settings um and<br>then also information overload that<br>comes with Transitions and uh going to<br>University is definitely one of Life<br>transitions that uh some students will<br>experience so um life transitions are<br>many and when we talk about changing<br>Landscapes uh uh our whole life is a<br>series of transitions some are big some<br>are little uh however information and<br>information Readiness and skill literacy<br>skills can um ease those transitions can<br>help us prepare for those transitions<br>but can also develop that reflective<br>mindset in our students to um help them<br>consider what was successful um in this<br>for example transition to University how<br>did I use those tools and systems and<br>information uh around me how did I use<br>Community a network of people um to<br>build a solid structure that supported<br>my transition um we all like to tend<br>tend and like to um come to New<br>environments and start from scratch<br>either thinking that our previous<br>experiences are not that applicable or<br>thinking ah I need to be doing something<br>else but we actually should build on<br>previous experiences so students that<br>come to uh our University already have<br>some great skills when it comes to<br>Information Management digital<br>technology um studying and learning<br>strategies and just coping with um<br>social world around them so we tend to<br>build on those strategies but it is also<br>important to make students aware that um<br>they should use those previous<br>experiences to help them transition and<br>to be more successful so we are always<br>more successful if we build on uh<br>something we previously learned and that<br>helps coping with information<br>overl now information disorder is<br>another um dark aspect of living in an<br>information world and by information<br>disorder uh I mean uh dealing with all<br>sorts of false and inaccurate<br>information usually captured under ter<br>under terms misinformation<br>disinformation Mal information uh all<br>referring to inaccurate information or<br>false information but uh different in<br>the extent of intentional harm that is<br>caused um by spreading false information<br>and this information disorder can come<br>from taking information out of context<br>so even though information may be in its<br>Essence accurate taking it out of<br>context makes it inaccurate or uh false<br>which brings me back to the value of um<br>recordkeeping and making sure that uh we<br>understand wider context as well as<br>particular piece of information in front<br>of<br>us<br>um and this is becoming increasingly<br>complex uh when I taught information<br>literacy skills 20 years ago you know we<br>had structured way of uh demonstrating<br>this is relevant because you know the<br>author is relevant you can easily uh<br>distinguish true from false uh you can<br>tell that uh the source is reliable but<br>this is not the case anymore you can<br>have very very convincing uh false<br>information and take it as accurate and<br>then um spread it um unconsciously<br>further on and sometimes you are just<br>not sure and this can cause significant<br>challenges not just in our workplaces<br>and in our study but also within our<br>families if we uh are faced with<br>different and contrasting opinions so um<br>equipping information um equipping Sor<br>students with information literacy<br>skills is not just about distinguishing<br>between writer wrong information but<br>also understanding the impact it can<br>have uh on people's lives and<br>um that cognitive and effective feeling<br>that that that follows it so how how can<br>we actually um preserve our well-being<br>in a world that is informationally<br>disordered in some way as I said these<br>are all big topics so if I continue I<br>might uh we might skip morning tea<br>completely so I won't go into uh more<br>details but if you have some thoughts<br>that you would like to share or discuss<br>note them down and we'll come back to<br>them<br>later uh another increasing complexity<br>is fragmentation of information spaces<br>and by that I mean multiple devices<br>multiple online spaces Cloud storages um<br>accounts email accounts social media<br>accounts bank accounts Health accounts<br>all sorts of not not to mention all the<br>loyalty wordss and things uh we uh have<br>because we want to are forc to have so<br>this is all uh making our information<br>spaces fragmented so when you find<br>yourself in a situation that you need to<br>find H that essay I wrote two years ago<br>or something uh some other information<br>that is of relevance uh it is becoming<br>increasingly challenge uh challenging to<br>find that information however<br>fragmentation has other consequences as<br>well and that is we forget we forget<br>where we gave out our information or<br>personal um addresses and date of births<br>and credit card numbers and and so all<br>sort of things so this is making us<br>vulnerable um in our information spaces<br>um while there are some promising<br>directions that AI can um bring those<br>fragmented spaces together and bring you<br>more control over those spaces it is<br>still you know a train algorithm that<br>uses a lot of private and personal<br>information and has access to that<br>information so this is uh another<br>awareness to to keep in mind as we<br>balance uh pros and cons of um a living<br>AI um data ownership data sovereignty to<br>different concepts but uh I brought them<br>together here is another increasing<br>complexity in today's world when we talk<br>about data ownership we can um we can go<br>back to that personal example of for<br>example you took a photo but that photo<br>contains other people so who has the<br>right who has uh who has access to that<br>photo who has the right to share that<br>photograph um I have an 11year old<br>daughter so every time I share<br>information and photo uh of her and I'm<br>very much pressured by our overseas<br>family to um almost live stream that<br>aspect of her life I need to ask her<br>because it's her on that image um and<br>also for students I think it pays to<br>bring attention to the fact that yes you<br>might be recording and taking photos of<br>every single aspect of your life now but<br>imagine yourself 20 years or 10 years<br>from now on looking at those images or<br>sharing those images with your new<br>partners children or uh whoever will be<br>in your life what aspect of it do you<br>actually want to preserve and what will<br>make you<br>uncomfortable so thinking about data<br>ownership on that um personal level but<br>then extending uh we also read give away<br>information to businesses the other day<br>I was buying and we were trained to do<br>that the other day I was buying a<br>t-shirt uh in a store on lton key and uh<br>the lady selling said okay can I have<br>your phone number and I actually started<br>saying my phone number because before I<br>stopped myself thinking why do you need<br>my phone number I'm just just charge me<br>I will pay and I don't need a receipt<br>you don't need to have my phone number<br>but we are so used to um giving that<br>information away so who who owns our<br>data um is another big discussion to<br>have and then data sovereignty as a<br>concept that implies that data produced<br>about a nation within a nation for a<br>nation should stay under control of a<br>nation which makes um International and<br>Global businesses um challenging which<br>makes legal environment challenging and<br>which makes conversations uh our<br>governments have quite challenging so<br>the question also is how much say we<br>have especially when it comes to<br>indigenous um information and Indigenous<br>data<br>sovereignty um I think I mentioned uh<br>privacy and surveillance to some extent<br>but we are also um willingly living in a<br>world where cameras are all around us<br>and it can be easy to forget and in many<br>aspects this is for our own safety but<br>in many aspects it is also not entirely<br>necessarily so thinking how to train uh<br>how to teach our students how to help<br>them devel that mindset to be um aware<br>of that constant um surveillance and<br>what actually that means for the privacy<br>and protection of our personal lives uh<br>also as we age uh as we maybe Embrace<br>Technologies in our home that might<br>actually monitor us to help us um live a<br>more healthier and safer lives what does<br>that mean if um you know streaming of<br>Our Lives is shared with a medical<br>professional or a family member who is<br>not living with us in the household so<br>these again um delicate lines between um<br>privacy and surveillance is another<br>topic to think about in an information<br>World<br>um and the final point is around<br>knowledge and Open Access and this is an<br>interesting discussion in uh an<br>Information Society because it brings<br>together Different World Views is<br>knowledge for everybody is open access<br>something that is our right that is<br>given or are they sit there situations<br>where um some should not be as easily<br>accessible where we should not Grant<br>Open Access and it is an interesting<br>conversation to talk to and to have with<br>um students uh as they go through their<br>education to see how their ideas of what<br>knowledge is how they can use resources<br>to create and to learn but also how they<br>can share um<br>information they create uh how those um<br>World Views change I have an interesting<br>example um about<br>tattoos um I research information<br>experiences of people with tattoos and<br>that question about intellectual<br>property and knowledge and Open Access<br>is very interesting uh because when you<br>ask them um because many people look for<br>inspiration for their tattoo images<br>online and then maybe have um more or<br>less complex conversations with their<br>tattoo artists about uh what can and<br>cannot be copied so interesting<br>discussions about intellectual property<br>uh but when you ask them to whom does<br>your tattoo belong and then there is<br>silence H does it belong to the artists<br>does it belong to you as a wearer if<br>your tattoo has elements that connects<br>you to your family doesn't belong to<br>them as well so such life examples that<br>are very relatable uh to people on<br>everyday basis are interesting examples<br>as a conversation starters for these big<br>questions around knowledge and uh<br>intellectual property and Open<br>Access um and these complexities of<br>course have impact on uh people but also<br>government so um this was just a run<br>through um some of the complexities and<br>some of the characteristics of our<br>information worlds but uh I want to to<br>kind of um bring some positive side to<br>this um final part uh there are<br>opportunities and there are many<br>opportunities for uh studying living and<br>working in information and AI world the<br>future of work is changing the other day<br>I listened to a presentation where they<br>talked about research um that's aimed to<br>use uh virtual reality to help workers<br>who are either sharing uh spaces or or<br>are working while commuting or are just<br>in environment where they can't focus to<br>use VR sets to create virtual working<br>spaces even when they are physically<br>present in different uh settings so that<br>is an interesting D direction to observe<br>how our future of work will change not<br>just in terms of working physically or<br>remotely but in terms of practices in<br>terms of interaction with people in<br>terms of<br>productivity uh digital inclusion is<br>another um big area to uh keep in mind<br>and to work on um as we saw over the<br>past<br>decades there were many many instances<br>where people were left out and this is<br>still happening uh but it is also<br>important to um give that opportunity to<br>be excluded if you um want to so there<br>are still lot of business services<br>government services that are pushing<br>that digital environment um without<br>taking into consider ation um the effect<br>that that might have on some people who<br>are not ready or do not want to uh be<br>digitally included so that conversation<br>about digital exclusion and inclusion<br>that has been going on for decades is<br>becoming redefined um in an AI<br>age another interesting opportunity is<br>around um migrating societies so there<br>are millions of people uh who are<br>migrating today uh some voluntarily many<br>uh forcibly displaced<br>due to conflicts due to uh natural<br>disasters climate change and so on so<br>how can information and AI World support<br>um those migrating societies what<br>happens um when people migrate from one<br>context to another is that information<br>landscape and by information landscape I<br>mean uh the way they perceive<br>information the way they understand<br>information apps and services they use<br>that becomes fractured and coming into<br>new environment people need to rebuild<br>those spaces so how can we work on those<br>fractured information spaces and<br>Landscapes together to support uh<br>migration is a huge phenomenon in<br>today's<br>society um and then finally life and<br>death in Information Society the way we<br>live the way we die the way we live our<br>Legacy has significantly changed and<br>we'll keep on changing so thinking about<br>um creating our Legacy and creating our<br>digital Footprints as we go around<br>rather than a retroactive exercise uh is<br>another important area to keep in<br>mind so I want go into uh many more<br>details because I would like to wrap up<br>now and give you an opportunity to um<br>ask question and discuss I will just um<br>finish with um emphasizing so what we do<br>in our Bachelor of Commerce and I will<br>just briefly uh talk about Information<br>Systems which is one of the majors<br>within but it is also uh a perspective<br>an aspect that is embedded in all the<br>other Majors so it is very<br>interdisciplinary um in nature and it<br>connects people processes and technology<br>which is uh what information world is um<br>all about but the reason why I'm<br>emphasizing Information Systems is very<br>often students come to us thinking Ah<br>that's building something that's too<br>techy for me I don't want to have<br>anything to do with that however we are<br>all um encountering and using<br>information systems on a daily basis<br>so thinking whatever the subject of the<br>study is either in um secondary<br>education system or tertiary uh students<br>are regularly interacting with Business<br>Systems um Uber um ordering um Pizza<br>going to McDonald's and interacting with<br>those screens there um ordering a<br>receipt for um health issue<br>communicating so there's that embedded<br>information system aspect in every<br>single part of our lives so um getting<br>more familiar with information systems<br>as an area of study but also as a<br>perspective uh within the Bachelor of<br>Commerce um is uh I think important to<br>bring attention to and it supports<br>interdisciplinarity because information<br>is of relevance in business in health in<br>education in government um everywhere uh<br>I would just also like to emphasize that<br>we um focus a lot on work integrated<br>learning so many of our students um<br>study and work at the same time but also<br>University assessment tend to bring um<br>those experiences together and I think<br>this will be particularly important in<br>an AI world uh so studying but also<br>experiencing how uh our businesses and<br>government are<br>shaping uh all right I think I will uh<br>stop here and just um instead of me<br>talking about concluding uh things<br>around what it means means to study<br>information what it means to study in an<br>information world and what it means um<br>to be prepared to study in an AI world I<br>would just like to open um for for<br>questions or any comments you might have<br>it's nothing else what went through your<br>mind seen um the bio of me here um I'm<br>the associate Dean learning and teaching<br>here it's a fairly new role for me but<br>I've been at the University for 30 years<br>uh following in philosophy and public<br>policy I'm actually based in our school<br>of government and from most of my<br>academic career I've taught<br>professionals inw Professionals in the<br>public service so I'm an Unapologetic<br>academic nerd I've probably got much<br>more content than we have time for so I<br>may zip through a few slides um but you<br>will have them later for your reference<br>I've already modified the topic of my of<br>my presentation<br>um following Maya's comment that we<br>can't possibly cover all the<br>implications of learning and assessing<br>so I've just said<br>some um really um fantastically<br>following Maya's comments about our<br>students and their<br>experiences this slide shows I suppose<br>my teaching philosophy where we have a<br>um a transfer model where the<br>individuals come in with all sorts of<br>experiences knowledge skills<br>dispositions aspirations and so on and<br>then they go out following some duration<br>in our University uh with knowledge<br>skills Etc that they put to some sort of<br>use and I guess what I want to say is<br>first of all we're focusing on the<br>environment where geni is part of that<br>transfer model but also that the poll of<br>the future comes into the university so<br>I'm countering the idea that we have a<br>linear progression through where<br>students come along and get added to<br>somehow and go out bigger different<br>better than they were coming in and I'll<br>Circle back around to that concept when<br>we talk about<br>motivation um I often look at what um<br>words mean the semantics of them which<br>leads me to focus a little bit on what<br>we think think about when we look at the<br>word generative so generative AI<br>generative learning a classic definition<br>of artificial intelligence produced<br>instantaneously by<br>co-pilot what I do with my students is<br>get them to put their queries into AIS<br>and have a look at them to start to<br>develop their critical um attention to<br>the kinds of questions dealing with<br>information that Maya already introduced<br>to us so here if I were um taking time<br>with my students I might guide them to<br>notice some of the terminology that's<br>used some of the anthropomorphizing<br>Tendencies do your students refer to and<br>talk to their AIS as a person as a as a<br>he very often rather than an it um what<br>does it mean to say mimicking humanlike<br>creativity what does it mean to say<br>models learned<br>um and use knowledge aren't those human<br>characteristics so it's just a kind of a<br>sensitizing uh area at the moment for<br>thinking about gen AI but that leads me<br>to look at what education psychologists<br>have said about uh what they call<br>generative learning so the idea that<br>Learners not the machines Learners<br>generate their understandings and this<br>allows them to use use their knowledge<br>to generalize categorize and solve<br>problems and this definition comes from<br>the National Academy of Sciences second<br>addition on how we learn or how we learn<br>to or something like that I do have all<br>the references I've used that aren't AI<br>references in the slid pack um for you<br>to um have a look at<br>later um so I as I go through this<br>presentation I'm building up a series of<br>observations about gen I in the<br>university and the first one is getting<br>our students to use gen in an<br>environment where we can help them<br>critique and think about what they're<br>doing and think about this<br>anthropomorphizing tendency to keep<br>clear um the next thing to focus on in<br>my my model of transfer of learning is<br>the motivational aspect so again from<br>the same National Academy of Sciences<br>report drawing attention to what<br>motivates human learning and therefore<br>what Educators can do to support that<br>and these Concepts or these strategies<br>or tasks are not knowledge focused and<br>this won't be news to you at all as<br>Educators but the point I want to make<br>with respect to motivation and this has<br>been a little bit of a Epiphany moment<br>for me is to make sure our students know<br>why we are doing what we are doing and<br>if we expect them to use their<br>motivation to deepen their learning that<br>we're really clear that that's why we're<br>doing and what we're doing and that<br>they're doing things like reflective<br>journaling to help them see their<br>motivations because that poll of their<br>future where they're heading enters into<br>the effectiveness of the learning<br>opportunities that we provide for<br>them so the idea that we're explicit in<br>our um philosophies with our students<br>especially at the tertiary<br>sector if we are able to um to um to<br>energize their their motivation and<br>their<br>Curiosities then I think it's an easier<br>task to inject AI use into that um<br>structure so that AI is no longer seen<br>solely as a way to shortcut to change uh<br>to cheat to um to um step away from the<br>learning objectives that we have but<br>becomes naturally part of what they want<br>to do because they're getting the um the<br>feedback from what they're doing<br>relative to their motivations and their<br>challenges so again in our um in our<br>introductory courses for business<br>subjects we're using brand challenges to<br>create that motivational pull and we are<br>encouraging and enabling and allowing<br>them to use AIS we're obviously all of<br>us in a little bit of a a learning uh<br>Zone ourselves and how this works and<br>how their use is actually um increasing<br>their learning and how they are drawing<br>on their own experiences and working<br>together in a more realistic kind of<br>environment so um we hope from day one<br>to normalize the use of AI um as and<br>when it's appropriate for one thing it's<br>hopeless to to ban it um that's not<br>realistic we know that our students are<br>using AIS and they will use them we'd<br>rather they're transparent and critical<br>users rather than attempting to hide and<br>dissemble and um<br>be dishonest about their uses but that<br>does lead to the really crucial question<br>of who's work are we seeing and what do<br>we think about<br>that um the um this slide reminds me<br>because the image is borrowed from a<br>wonderful series of resources at the<br>University of Sydney so again I will I<br>will refer you in the references to<br>those resources but there's um an<br>amazing uh collection of resources for<br>us all as<br>Educators um videos up-to-date blogs<br>really keeping on top of what's new<br>every trimester they're refreshing what<br>the AIS are up to they're refreshing<br>what we do in Ai and assessment<br>wonderful blogger called um Dan Daniel<br>Leo I can't remember his first name for<br>sure anyway I had hoped to show a little<br>bit of a video for him narrating some of<br>what's going on there but anyway this is<br>just the reminder to have a look at that<br>resource because it's really rich uh but<br>what we're doing in the bcom course in<br>this area is<br>um kind of not expecting every element<br>of what our students do to be about<br>content intake and uh content ex um<br>outputs so in class we're having them<br>think about uh a particular Grand<br>Challenge and engage with their group uh<br>this particular example involves<br>creating a picture of how they see a<br>grand challenge but what we're really um<br>hoping to um see is them starting to<br>work together recognizing how they're<br>drawing on their own experiences when<br>they talk about Grand challenges<br>following that we have them do<br>individual work using AI to carry on and<br>create a a picture for themselves that<br>they've tried in this participatory<br>environment and give us some explanatory<br>notes that make it personal to them and<br>we're asking them to declare their use<br>of AI so the in-class activity looks<br>like this we require them to get<br>together in a group uh make a rich<br>picture and upload a selfie to prove<br>they've done it<br>that's all we're just looking at<br>activity what we are balancing and again<br>from Maya's presentation the word that<br>came through to me very often was<br>balance and you notice a lot of her<br>terms on her slide were this and this<br>this and this but we're constantly in an<br>environment where we're trying to<br>balance um and here I'm focusing on the<br>balance between where students work with<br>AI and where AI is doing work for<br>students and this leads us to focus on<br>thinking about AI as an assistant it's<br>assisting students to present their<br>ideas or it's assisting them to augment<br>their ideas to take a kernel of<br>something they're struggling with and<br>thinking about and want to bump up a<br>notch or two and using AI to better<br>enable them to show what they really<br>want to show versus AI doing the work<br>for them pressing the button and say do<br>this task for me and in that context um<br>as many of you probably will already<br>have explored the AI can do those things<br>really really really well to a degree<br>that's difficult for us to detect even<br>critical Reflections can be done on AI<br>by giving AI your characteristics where<br>you live what your hobbies are what last<br>book you read and what the concept is<br>the teacher wants you to reflect on and<br>it will spit out something in your<br>persona that is supposedly your critical<br>reflection the the third point there is<br>where we're actually underutilizing a I<br>where individuals are just attempting<br>kind of a surface level response to<br>their learning their curiosity is not<br>engaged they don't feel motivated to use<br>AI in an assistive and augmented kind of<br>way and we have to then ask is that<br>learning ending up less than we would<br>like to see are they somehow falling<br>behind the bulk of the class when<br>they're doing this<br>and it's a different kind of um example<br>of the digital divide or digital<br>inclusiveness and exclusiveness that I<br>think we have to be increasingly alert<br>to sadly or realistically or<br>unfortunately or excitingly these are<br>quite ambiguous differenti<br>differentiations it depends on the<br>student it depends on the task it<br>depends on the discipline it depends<br>ends on all sorts of things um back to<br>my original model we've got thousands<br>and thousands and thousands of variables<br>we're dealing with and you all know this<br>as well there is no one student there is<br>no one right way to do anything the<br>world is ambiguous and this is no<br>exception um this slide here is a<br>compilation from four of the seven<br>universities that have publicly<br>available AI guidelines and it's attempt<br>to kind of show the kinds of things we<br>might ask students to do with AI<br>Assistance or augmentation or even this<br>particular um format uses creation which<br>is the doing for but in some disciplines<br>or in some aspects of tasks and<br>assignments that might be something we<br>would accept so again it's horses for<br>courses it's how we um think through<br>exact when and where and how we want AIS<br>to be used in our classes and our<br>assessment<br>work um so we have to decide how we want<br>to use AI in assessment what tasks what<br>they need to um have what they need to<br>be able to find um here it's probably<br>the case that in all our<br>disciplines uh functionality is improved<br>by having some stuff in our minds even<br>though you can look up uh a<br>multiplication times table online some<br>for some tasks you actually kind of need<br>to just have that recall and every<br>discipline has some of that stuff we<br>want students to just have embedded but<br>the rest of it they can just get somehow<br>what is that in our<br>disciplines um increasingly we're<br>focusing on creating tasks that are<br>authentic I'll come back to that or um<br>tasks s that allow us to track the<br>process of the work and the thinking<br>that's going on as a both of these as<br>opposed to just focusing on the<br>output authentic um assessment is<br>another classic example of ambiguity<br>here um but it's inherently valuable<br>when we think about it it um is<br>connecting what they're learning in the<br>classroom to what they'll need to do in<br>the world um it's motivational because<br>of those real World challenges it can<br>include um a larger spectrum of reality<br>so that the real world activity is<br>embedded in a society and a culture<br>that's meaningful for the students it<br>can be used to counteract some threats<br>to academic Integrity because of its<br>realism and it can promote Equity<br>because it brings students experiences<br>into the<br>task um but it um uh and it also is<br>partly a way to get around um the<br>content um incure type of answers that<br>students might<br>give um but the ambiguity comes into<br>play as well because what's a what's an<br>authentic scenario for me is not<br>necessarily the same as for you what<br>elements of reality are meaningful um<br>are real our context background<br>environment so perception dependent or<br>variable it's not only about how tasks<br>represent knowledge for practice but how<br>they represent the reality more fully<br>that a student um is aware of the<br>complexities that again that Maya um<br>reminded us about um and how<br>authenticity is actually often intention<br>with learning tasks that we might want<br>to see demonstrated so the more we<br>attempt to be authentic the more real<br>the less likely we are to kind of<br>isolate the learning tasks we want to<br>see so we have to think about how we<br>support learning in that<br>context um I asked um this one's chat<br>GPT how authentic assessment can be made<br>gen AI proof it came out with a sort of<br>a c minus answer from my perspective um<br>I've been trying to gather ideas for<br>assessment that are AI resistant um and<br>this is um just a poor kind of um list<br>for that but again it's just illustrates<br>how we can um see what um just the way<br>of getting ideas and seeing what's what<br>in many<br>cases um what we can do and it's hard um<br>and this is something that I've heard<br>from colleagues who say in this new geni<br>gen AI enabled Environ ironment or even<br>in contexts where we we say I want you<br>to do this without AI but they do it<br>anyway the assessment becomes<br>exhausting because you have to sift<br>through and try to judge what is what<br>isn't what are they actually knowing and<br>understanding themselves contrast to a<br>previous era when we gauged<br>understanding by the output we said you<br>can't do this thing unless you<br>understand it now that's harder and<br>harder to detect so one way we can do<br>that is to really work with our rubrics<br>and really be explicit with students to<br>say things like you can write whatever<br>you want for as long as you want but<br>you're only going to get credit for this<br>particular element whether we are<br>assessing how well they use AI or<br>whether we're assessing how well they<br>actually can know something or do<br>something so I think we can um work much<br>more explicitly with communicating what<br>we expect to see it won't happen<br>overnight it's a it's going to take a<br>few I don't know years to to get these<br>things you know and we'll continue to be<br>um adjusting to them but I think that's<br>one thing that we can um be alert to um<br>University of Sydney has developed this<br>Lane one versus lane two ways of<br>thinking about types of assessments<br>and this has actually gotten traction<br>quite globally now um Lane one is where<br>we need secure in-person um Assurance of<br>learning and Lane 2 is where we're using<br>um assessment to help students learn um<br>in one way or another and it's um more<br>High trust because we can't uh we can't<br>ensure that it's students own work the<br>message here the lesson here is<br>uh the worst place to be is in the<br>middle of the road crashes happened<br>there so we can be really clear about<br>when we need Lane one assessment it may<br>likely be that we'll use that type of<br>assessment less and less which seems<br>counterintuitive because a lot of us<br>think we need to go to more secure<br>assessment more pen and paper exams less<br>opportunity for students to use AIS to<br>do their work um and gradually Shifting<br>the culture into a high trust model<br>which says we're going to secure test<br>less often but it's more important so<br>when in a student's path of study do we<br>need to assure they've learned something<br>certainly by graduation I don't want to<br>graduate a financial analyst who loses<br>company's money I don't want to graduate<br>an engineer whose Bridge falls down you<br>know we need those assurances but don't<br>perhaps need them every step of the way<br>and our students need to gradually<br>understand that it's up to them to<br>undertake formative assessment<br>activities it's up to them to learn<br>start to learn for themselves eventually<br>they'll need to demonstrate it but not<br>every step of the way so again have a<br>look at University of Sydney fabulous um<br>resource uh there<br>um the final point I want to touch on is<br>um something I've done with my students<br>and it's a it's a I want almost there's<br>not it's not counterintuitive so much as<br>um there's a word I keep fishing for and<br>I can't find it's where you do something<br>so that the opposite happens where you<br>you know you you you tell your children<br>um chocolate tastes bad um but they<br>actually say that must be because tastes<br>good it's kind of reverse psychology I<br>guess kind of thing so what I'm trying<br>to do here is find a way for students to<br>appreciate themselves as human<br>thinkers and the counterintuitiveness<br>aspect of it is human thinking is<br>incredibly flawed and<br>biased and if human thinking is<br>incredibly flawed and biased we don't<br>want them to think AIS are perfect so NE<br>NE do we have AIS all bad humans all<br>good but both and therefore in Balance<br>so that's where we're heading um and so<br>the way we can work through that is to<br>start to point out that first of all you<br>don't think entirely inside your brain<br>you think by writing things down you<br>think by looking things up you store<br>information in places you can access<br>more or less accurately or easily um and<br>and the the access you have is broader<br>than you yourself so that's one aspect<br>of it but the the limits and<br>compensating activities is what I really<br>want to focus on so my starting point is<br>to um talk about the problems that have<br>been identified with<br>genis um and their human anal um<br>analogues degenerative thinking where<br>the data gets cycled through outputs and<br>becomes narrower and narrower and more<br>and more biased rarer data gets harder<br>to find humans do this too if they limit<br>their news sources and their social<br>media networks the information just<br>becomes<br>degenerative and with that the erosion<br>of<br>diversity and I had one colleague um<br>know it was a it was a piece in the<br>conversation where a teacher said if I<br>see the student use the word tapestry I<br>know they've used a gen because it turns<br>out there are like 50 words that genis<br>use all the time which aren't part of<br>students normal<br>vocabularies that'll change but you know<br>it's that idea that the erosion of<br>diversity but the one I really focus on<br>is this idea of<br>hallucination so this is IBM which is a<br>computer company and this is how they<br>Define ai hallucination and what I love<br>about this definition<br>is how it uses this anthropomorphic<br>language um it's a chatbot that<br>perceives patterns um it creates outputs<br>you know um that are nonsensical or<br>altogether<br>inaccurate and so I asked my students<br>well what do we mean by AI perceives and<br>they pop it into a AI um a gen Ai and<br>and the answer is well actually um AIS<br>don't really perceive<br>they don't experience or interpret the<br>world they process data so here we're<br>having students sensitive to the<br>anthropomorphizing language of these<br>genis but also starting to um recognize<br>what generation of information is<br>circling back around to geni versus<br>generative learning and just sensitizing<br>that<br>distinction then we look at human<br>hallucination so a false perception<br>through one of the Sens is how that's<br>defined but um scientists and<br>researchers have pointed out that<br>actually the brain doesn't process all<br>the perceptions that we have um even<br>sitting in the room your perception is<br>quite restricted if someone were to fire<br>a gun in the room we would all go like<br>that but in the absence of something out<br>of the ordinary we go along we go along<br>and our brain expects things to happen<br>happen in a flow and it's only those<br>disruptions that stand out which means<br>that perception is really subjective it<br>means what my brain is attending to and<br>how I am forming my conclusions based on<br>a very small selection of perceptual<br>input hence brain generated<br>hallucination which by the way is what<br>we could say about any opinion we have<br>regardless of whether the facts are true<br>on which I've based my opinion I haven't<br>located that opinion directly from the<br>facts<br>necessarily so<br>um one thing to have notes is your kind<br>of security blanket and not look at what<br>you want to actually say but I think<br>right um which just leads to<br>the comment that I would hope students<br>have reached already looking at the<br>IBM's definition of of AI hallucination<br>as perceiving patterns and judging them<br>and we judge them to be wrong to point<br>out that the generation of anything is<br>not the same as the Judgment of that<br>thing and while AIS can generate stuff<br>content and humans can generate<br>understandings only humans can make<br>sense of anything that's<br>generated so what I want to leave<br>students with going through this<br>exercise is a a mature and balanced<br>understanding of themselves as human<br>flawed but nevertheless uniquely capable<br>individuals and the AIS as<br>tools and one of the things about the AI<br>as a tool is to say that this contrary<br>to I think a lot of the whizbang stuff<br>going<br>around it conceptually is no different<br>than assists to learning we have all we<br>have always had I'm of the generation<br>that had very little tools when I<br>started my schooling but I had mom and<br>dad I had dad for math I had mom for<br>writing those are assistance and it's<br>just kind of taken that and put it on<br>stilt somehow um and we need to just<br>keep alert to those<br>distinctions so so I want to um leave<br>you with what I hoped were the nine<br>points that I wanted to touch on in my<br>some implications of of um geni for<br>assessing and learning help students see<br>the machine as a machine it's an ongoing<br>process and the flashier they get the<br>more we have to keep reinforcing that<br>message and therefore articulate the<br>differences between machine and human<br>be explicit in supporting motivated<br>learning it will take a lot of the<br>exhausting pressure off us eventually if<br>we can actually be as we get better at<br>that we can't outrun AI if I'd shown you<br>the Snippets of those videos from the<br>University of Sydney it's just amazing<br>what these things can do we cannot<br>outsmart them and outrun<br>them um AI does not pose conceptual<br>challenges for facilitating learning<br>um we may be moving to an environment<br>with fewer tests but where we test um<br>matters we must I think use more<br>authentic assessment I've got that in<br>inverted commas because what's authentic<br>is not a one siiz fits all and certainly<br>not restricted to um simp simple or<br>simplistic scenarios if we really want<br>to have that pull of the future coming<br>into the classroom effec ly and the<br>process of content generation and sense<br>making are distinct and Only Humans Do<br>sense<br>making so thank you very much for your<br>attention um we've got about five<br>minutes in that I will call students out<br>with suspected AI because it is so<br>important to not um have them use it if<br>they're claiming it to be their own work<br>so this is what I do I have a c set of<br>eight criteria that says along the lines<br>of I have noted that your work um has<br>suspicions I'm suspicious about some of<br>it generated by uh generative Ai and<br>these are the characteristics of that a<br>it is using language that would not be<br>used by a stage two student B you have<br>gone way beyond the brief of the<br>assignment and I suspect this wasn't<br>your own work C and I go down for eight<br>criteria your work has one or more of<br>these features could you come and see me<br>because we don't accept your work<br>presented um by someone you know that<br>has been done not by you when you get<br>this assignment we have to know that you<br>did it so then um they have a chance to<br>come and see me and explain the biggest<br>one that I would say is really important<br>if there is one<br>reference uh which is more at University<br>level but you would also have this that<br>is made up by hallucination it is<br>academic misconduct immediately and that<br>is an immediate fail so what happens is<br>generative AI will pull the name of a<br>journal theory in Social education<br>something like that pull a title and<br>that looks appropriate pull an author in<br>that looks appropriate and make up a<br>smashed up reference that is completely<br>and utterly false at that stage is<br>academic misconduct and cannot be<br>accepted for anything so that is an<br>immediate fail um and my students know<br>this and I warned them at the start that<br>this is what generative AI is and that<br>they're not if they're not clever enough<br>to know that don't use use it um because<br>it's you're going to get caught and my<br>tutors are taught to search through a<br>few of the references that look weird um<br>and quickly pull it out so that is I'm<br>I'm really strict on it and I had 20<br>students out of 100 used generative AI<br>last year when it first came out and I<br>pinged every single one of them you can<br>tell it's not their language you can<br>tell it's gone far from the brief so I<br>give them not an accusation but like<br>your work has the features of one<br>student has come back and defended that<br>it was her work every single other one<br>took the resub I gave<br>them um everyone that had a misquoted<br>reference was failed because it's it's<br>not their work um so yeah I am a bit<br>firm on this I'm sorry but we really<br>need you guys at at high school level to<br>hold out against AI they don't have the<br>intelligence to be able to critique it<br>well enough so don't use it at<br>University not one student in any of my<br>courses can use it at supervision level<br>of PhD not one student can use it<br>because what I want is critical and<br>creative thinkers who have the ability<br>themselves to know what is fact from<br>fiction and I can't do that if they're<br>dabbling in and out of it so they're not<br>even allowed to use it for brainstorming<br>because I need to know that their brains<br>are working so I'm a little bit on an<br>extreme position here but I'm going to<br>keep holding it out because we know that<br>genit isn't our friend it is a tool that<br>we can use for for a few<br>efficiencies but not a critical thinker<br>it isn't a human which we need okay keep<br>going so there's APA isn't particularly<br>complex because you can have there's a<br>site you can go to a most University<br>sites that says how to generate an APA<br>Citation and you just put in the<br>reference and it will generate it for<br>you the trouble is if they just put in a<br>URL um it isn't really telling us how<br>and where they found it so you would<br>even have author date title retrieve<br>from and I've just marked 20 of my<br>initial teacher education assignments<br>there's some of them are seated here<br>lovely to see you guys um and they're<br>expecting students to do that now we<br>need to lift our game on referencing<br>particularly at the senior end of school<br>and there's citation um you can easily<br>put in a reference and it will tell you<br>how to write it yeah you can just look<br>it up they're on waata university has<br>one for example QA just complete silence<br>I would agree completely and utterly<br>that there hasn't been enough leadership<br>in this and I would say we need to be it<br>we're in this moment which is a bit like<br>the reminds me of the Millennium where<br>digital learning started and everyone<br>was like get on the wave we've got to be<br>on the wave or we'll be left behind and<br>that's the same narrative we're given<br>all the time about AI we are now having<br>schools that have no cell phones because<br>it turned out to be so silly we have<br>data that shows that if the schools<br>adopted digital to an extreme they did<br>far worse than if they didn't<br>so we know that and the same will happen<br>with AI we know those that adopted it<br>the students will stop thinking for<br>themselves and they will become lazy it<br>is just completely and utterly obvious<br>so what we need to do is be very<br>critical and very cautious and hold a<br>line because we know what good teaching<br>learning is and we don't need to allow<br>generative AI to take over so I just<br>think we need leadership in this space<br>Sorry I do have a few reckons on this<br>and it is a little does I do go off a<br>bit but at the same time I think that we<br>need some leadership here that says it<br>isn't that great for us we need students<br>thinking otherwise we'll have a<br>generation that in five years that<br>doesn't know how to think and won't even<br>be able to tell what is AI and what is<br>not so our University discourages us<br>from using them because they found to be<br>a little bit um problematic nonetheless<br>they are a tool that can be used and I<br>would encourage teachers to consider it<br>if it's at least indicates something I<br>know our students use it they tell me<br>the person in my group used it for the<br>group work so um yeah we know that chat<br>zero can generate some useful data you<br>would then have to go on to say here's<br>the evidence I have it's one of a piece<br>of many pieces of<br>evidence um just back on how to change<br>the assessments so what I've done in my<br>courses because I'm absolutely insistent<br>that students do their own work is I've<br>shifted my assessment a lot more to<br>creative and critical thinking that's<br>more specific to the exact context we're<br>working in so for<br>example if we are studying Environmental<br>Education policy I'm using Concepts such<br>as sustainability or something I will<br>make the assignment far more specific<br>around that and particularly around um<br>for example uh a field trip an event<br>that happens a guest speaker so it's far<br>more generated by knowledge within what<br>we have exposed them to so that someone<br>outside of that for a generative AI<br>cannot know what that was and it's far<br>more difficult for them to be able to<br>regurgitate that so we actually have had<br>more specific um assessment schedules<br>because if it says I expect you to use<br>you know these three concepts to refer<br>to this reading to do that kind of thing<br>it gets harder and harder for students<br>to game that and I've brought into every<br>single course I teach um an in-class<br>handwritten test in my case it's open<br>book because they can bring in some<br>notes but they have to write on the day<br>and I haven't had one complaint from 350<br>students that they're still handwriting<br>assessments um at stage two and three<br>where I'm teaching um and that is the<br>most accurate assessment I have in the<br>whole year because it can only be done<br>right then on the spot and actually it's<br>really really useful stuff and I say<br>don't even worry about you know trying<br>to be clever you will find the questions<br>for example using the concepts in educt<br>315 um explain this cartoon there's<br>nothing that you you have to have a<br>brain and I warned them that at the<br>beginning of the course there'll be a<br>test at the end if you haven't engaged<br>with the course you'll find it hard so<br>we've got to get a little bit more<br>clever and that's an<br>in-class yeah so uh the kind of 30% test<br>at the end the course that I would have<br>is saying using the ideas generated<br>through this course tell me about this<br>write a letter to the minister so stuff<br>that they have to think for themselves<br>that wasn't particularly covered in the<br>course but all of the ideas are there so<br>the students which have attended have<br>engaged actually fly um and it's a<br>really nice way to encourage them to<br>engage all through it's what NCA doesn't<br>allow us very well to do because you<br>have to engage we're going to move on to<br>a slightly different topic so just to<br>introduce um a little bit of my<br>background so I'm involved in initial<br>teacher education and social science and<br>particularly social studies education um<br>so the other thing that I have been<br>doing is writing the latest New Zealand<br>curriculum to M AO and I have been<br>involved in the consultation over NCA<br>and I have done probably now about eight<br>years of work on NCA transitions to<br>University so on the back of that I'm<br>going to give you um a few more of<br>Roman's reckons and why we have a<br>problem with NCA emerging that has<br>become very very clear over the past 20<br>years so without further Ado we're going<br>to continue because lunch is w waiting<br>so what I'm going to do is a little bit<br>of where are we at we're in a really<br>really tricky moment and I'll explain<br>that for NCA right now and curriculum<br>policy in New Zealand um and then what<br>do we know about the transition of NCA<br>graduates and University success the<br>evidence is becoming very very clear<br>around some things and what steps could<br>we use to support Student Success having<br>got a slightly problematic assessment um<br>system running in New Zealand so I'll<br>make a start on that don't worry we will<br>have time for questions so where are we<br>at so if I showed you this slide and I<br>showed this slide to my initial teacher<br>education students last week we're in a<br>really tricky<br>moment we have<br>simultaneously three curriculums running<br>and I have no idea which curriculum to<br>teach my students um you have no idea<br>which curriculum you should be using we<br>have the 2007 one which hasn't been<br>disestablished it's still there we have<br>the Tomato AO all of the curriculum<br>documents which there was only three<br>finished maths English and social<br>sciencehistory it has now been<br>completely removed from every website<br>you could ever look about the middle of<br>the year and then we had two emerging<br>ones none of them useful for us at<br>secondary so I train secondary students<br>English 0 to6 a draft mathematics 0<br>to8 put up your hands<br>curriculum about half I'm finding about<br>half of schools are still using it at<br>some extent put up your hands if you're<br>using some of tatoo or some of<br>yeah and then we have this emerging one<br>which has meant to have arrived for term<br>four and hasn't arrived yet for English<br>and math and it's the only one there so<br>we we have had to teach our um teachers<br>and training three curriculum this year<br>and they're expected to know all of it<br>because every school could be using one<br>two or three um pragmatically the 2007<br>is the most steady option in some ways<br>um but we know there was this curriculum<br>moment which happened the last couple of<br>years which is really different so we're<br>in a really really tricky place and I<br>don't know any country in the world with<br>this amount of chaos around curriculum<br>and assessment right<br>now so as you know we had these other<br>drafts arrive and when I taught Henry<br>even last year we were teaching the<br>draft history's curriculum the<br>integrated history social science<br>curriculum and we had drafts and math<br>and English that were rolling out into<br>the schools but not prescribed yet all<br>of these have now been removed every<br>single one so that one's an interesting<br>moment we have this assertion from the<br>current government that by the end of<br>the year we will have the full years 9<br>to13 math and English curriculum still<br>hasn't arrived and we three about about<br>three weeks of finishing school to be<br>implemented next year um and then we<br>have science technology Health learning<br>languages the Arts and social sciences<br>to be Rewritten again in place next year<br>to be taught in<br>2027 so that is really important and<br>then if we look at the lineup between<br>the curriculum and<br>NCA and I have to say I was behind the<br>scenes one of the reasons why we are not<br>implementing level two and three right<br>now because it just made less and less<br>sense because there wasn't a curriculum<br>so if you look at these dates here we<br>have um a number of years of curriculum<br>development in the meantime NCA just<br>going H as b as development of the whole<br>of level one with no curriculum in place<br>that they were making up their own<br>curriculum development of level two and<br>three making up their own curriculum<br>last year all curriculum areas were<br>developed with Big Ideas until some of<br>the quality of that work became so<br>apparent that it really wasn't<br>curriculum writers who were making up<br>that curriculum for the NCA assessment<br>um so me amongst others wrote to the<br>minister and said just stop everything<br>is getting sillier and sillier and<br>you're going to have to redo it so we're<br>in this moment now with the level one<br>now in place but level two and three<br>paused and here we have still no<br>curriculum to develop so I mean no<br>country in the world would wish this<br>upon their teachers this is just this is<br>just absolutely ridiculous that you're<br>expected to be able to be operating in<br>this place here so on the back of that<br>we have a strong strong critique<br>emerging of NCA and how it is failing us<br>in many ways so some of these are some<br>of the headlines in the news and a book<br>put out New Zealand initiative who now<br>hold a very high status position within<br>the current government in their opinions<br>um critiquing NCA and how it was failing<br>many of our students<br>um for their<br>Futures this critique even came in from<br>the ppta so in 2017 very unusually<br>because the ppta is very Pro NCA always<br>has been they put out this report that<br>said<br>basically NCA full short in<br>manageability um no secondary teacher<br>would disagree the pendulum has gone too<br>far towards assessment at the expense of<br>curriculum and then it was the worst<br>decision in the world to try and put on<br>better Public Service Targets on meeting<br>5% Pass rates because this exacerbated<br>the trends towards schools focusing on<br>credits rather than high quality<br>learning so the ppta very unusually came<br>out and said that that was 2017 by 2018<br>the then labor government announced the<br>NCA review on the back of some of the<br>work we had done at University here and<br>other factors that basically said the<br>system is failing us um they said they<br>would identify a whole lot of different<br>aspects for change including enriching<br>and strengthening literacy numeracy and<br>reimagining NCA for powerful<br>learning um removing barriers like fees<br>so they started the spenca review<br>massive<br>consultation um and then announced a<br>change package which had these seven<br>criteria about making NCA more<br>accessible strengthening literacy and<br>numeracy enhancing marari having fewer<br>and larger standards simplifying the<br>structure and showing clearer pathways<br>and keeping NCA level one as an optional<br>level they had announced initially that<br>it could be removed now optional so<br>nonetheless that momentum started a<br>change that got out of step with<br>curriculum development um and led to<br>this this is a level one English current<br>um four Suite of achievement standards<br>two internal and two external so what<br>they the consultancy group suggested is<br>that to reduce the fragmentation the NCA<br>was creating in schools we reduce it to<br>smaller larger um<br>standards however what is what is now<br>happening of what you know of these<br>standards what is now<br>happening schools are dropping entirely<br>level one or dropping the externals and<br>so kids end up with 10 credits because<br>you only need 60 to get through to level<br>two so there was no incentive to do this<br>full Suite of larger ones so now<br>students are are being taught even<br>less um than what was intended so this<br>was one of the reasons I just said we<br>just have to stop um this isn't solving<br>the problem of the gaming which is going<br>on so let me explain what I mean by<br>Gaming and just to bring us up to date<br>um this was the 5ifth of April<br>announcement from The Beehive that the<br>government will be rephasing NCA um with<br>an entire review of level one undertaken<br>by ero additional review of other<br>aspects including methods for<br>externals um the senior curriculum will<br>be developed and an<br>implementation plan developed from aro's<br>evaluation and then NCA level two and<br>three fully implemented by 2028 level<br>three by 2029 so everything has been<br>dropped back um and on the back of that<br>the whole of the NCA Ministry of<br>Education team made<br>redundant um most of the new curriculum<br>team made<br>redundant and by then about 35% of all<br>schools had dropped NCA level<br>one so you wouldn't wish this upon any<br>minister of Education this huge mess<br>that we're<br>in on the back of that we have falling<br>rates of uee attainment and basically<br>until about um 2020 there was a increase<br>in UE to some extent um the bottom line<br>there is the uee line uh purple<br>um and NCA level one is in blue NCA<br>level two in red and NCA level three um<br>is year 13 level one so there's a big<br>gap between getting NCA and uee there's<br>always been that Gap and it hasn't<br>decreased over the years and now it's<br>starting to grow so we have um falling<br>rates of students even able to get uee<br>anyone have a guess why that might be<br>why fewer students<br>okay good yeah yeah we have a cohort<br>going through that are significantly<br>behind up to two years behind in in<br>their learning and no country in the<br>world except Japan has nailed this and<br>what they did is stop every student from<br>proceeding until they did six months of<br>extra after school work so they<br>stop they be very<br>popular and they paid the teachers to<br>teach from 3 to 5 o'l every day for six<br>months and that cohort caught up but no<br>other country in the world has done it<br>so that cohort coming through right from<br>preschool through to university is<br>behind on every single front so you're<br>right the other thing is literacy<br>falling and falling and falling and that<br>I think we're starting to see correct so<br>that's the bit I'm going to call gaming<br>um I'll repeat the question so students<br>doing courses that aren't actually<br>literacy and numeracy rich or able to<br>get them into university has increased<br>um so I'm going to look at that now and<br>why that's happened from our research so<br>um just one last Quick catch up so this<br>is the percentage of students leaving<br>school with at least NCA level one um<br>sadly there's more and more leaving<br>without any qualification and the fact<br>that schools have dropped NCA level one<br>will only increase so you can see that<br>15%<br>2022 um there's been a decrease and an<br>increase over time so uh what Jan<br>Marshall the head of nzqa said is we<br>know that about 25% in late 2023 were<br>not planning on offering a full<br>assessment program for NCA level 1 and<br>this means that for about 10% of school<br>levers they will not have any<br>qualification as they leave school and<br>that will increase as if schools drop<br>NCA level one so that's an a side there<br>so we were going to have a bit of a<br>catch up on what you've been noticing<br>but what I'd like to do is just push<br>through a little bit on the research and<br>then pause and um have a little bit of a<br>a look at what you've been noticing from<br>your end so a little bit on some of the<br>research we've been doing about the<br>transition of NCA graduates and<br>University success um that has been<br>conducted over the past eight years so<br>one of the things I talk to my<br>university lecturers about is that there<br>is huge differences in the setup of NCA<br>from University I don't need to go<br>through these but basically the ability<br>to pick and choose assessments is a<br>really different concept than University<br>we do not allow I have students every<br>year that say I don't like that<br>assignment can I do my own and it's like<br>I'm sorry sweetie this doesn't work like<br>this at University you do all of them or<br>there's no alternative but that is<br>encouraged within NCA picking and<br>choosing avoiding externals all of that<br>encouraged um and we have a lot of<br>holistic assessment like I was talking<br>about that celebrates being there for<br>the whole course NCA doesn't it has this<br>fragmented approach to picking off bits<br>of learning that you can then achieve in<br>small bits um we don't have resets we<br>ask for them every year from students<br>NCA now only has resets for fails but<br>there was a case that went around the<br>country of a student doing 16 resets you<br>know between American excellence and the<br>poor teacher having to Mark and Mark and<br>Mark and Mark so um some of the big<br>differences there so when we did we did<br>a survey in 2017 this was a group of us<br>from the faculty of Education that had<br>become increasingly concerned with what<br>we were seeing coming through from<br>school um and we asked students about<br>how well NCA had prepared them for<br>University and in many ways students<br>love NCA parents love it teachers love<br>it it's allowing a flexibility of choice<br>of assessment a mix of internal external<br>um that allows you to never get your way<br>through with a huge amount of<br>flexibility some people believe that<br>develops self agency self-<br>responsibility managing time loads um<br>stress levels the research suggests it<br>doesn't always it allows you to avoid uh<br>difficult things but nonetheless it does<br>allow some of that personal autonomy to<br>develop so the problematic thing that<br>students themselves admitted so this is<br>from their comments from the survey is<br>that um they felt they lost the breadth<br>of knowledge they felt the assessment<br>load was so heavy there was little room<br>for thinking um that the internals gave<br>him a false sense of achievement but<br>when you did the external you didn't<br>always achieve to the same level so the<br>research confirms that<br>um the other things the student said<br>about assessment was there was no redos<br>once it's done it's done um university<br>is not as flexible school was easier by<br>far at University's no Second Chances if<br>you met up uh there's no option of a<br>better grade um and then at University<br>the assessments are so close together<br>and worth more than any assessment was<br>at high school um school made it<br>impossible to fail as they gave you<br>multiple times to research doesn't<br>happen at Uni um and uni marking was<br>hard to comprehend at first so um this<br>was a survey graph that said I had<br>difficulty coping with the reading and<br>or writing for my University work<br>probably um we've got there about 35 to<br>15 almost 50% of students agreeing or<br>somewhat agreeing that the University<br>reading and writing was difficult for<br>them this one here I could just<br>highlight a couple of the bits here<br>about how<br>University uh required much more time<br>management skills and that needed<br>Improvement you can see that big um<br>agreement in the Middle with the circle<br>around it a hard time making new friends<br>and feeling like I belong um and<br>struggling to keep up with the amount of<br>work were also uh features that we heard<br>from students arriving um to<br>University so what we noticed on the<br>other side and um this is why we put in<br>place this research around about 2014 we<br>noticed a significant decline in student<br>ability and we were confused what was<br>going on um because the students hadn't<br>got Dumber why were they performing this<br>well um so so the science and math<br>faculties were particularly critical of<br>what was coming through the door to the<br>extent that our engineering software<br>engineering program put in place a test<br>um for every student they said we no<br>longer trust NCA we need a test to<br>measure where students are at and of<br>that test about a third failed<br>dramatically a third somewhat nearly<br>passed and a third flew through so they<br>picked up that third that nearly p and<br>heavily resourced them um but this was<br>uh this was quite alarming to them so<br>we're trying to work out what was going<br>on back there so what we had noticed<br>when I put in place some initial<br>research around what my students who<br>failed had done an NCA and found that<br>they had avoided anything difficult<br>particularly High literacy and high<br>numeracy standards particularly physics<br>algebra any English that required the<br>essay and and chosen every other thing<br>they could to avoid writing so writing<br>emerges as a really big issue for our<br>students at transition um and what Aaron<br>Wilson did was look at a range of school<br>desiles and found that even the<br>opportunity to learn was reduced for<br>students in low desile communities so<br>they weren't even exposed to certain<br>stuff and this was done through<br>streaming but also a teacher saying<br>actually I'm just going to teach you to<br>the achieve level not the Excellence<br>level or what all these things reduced<br>opportunities to learn particularly<br>marked um by Mar Pacific and low socio<br>economic students so we now know that um<br>particularly Canterbury canterbary<br>University Engineering has to retach<br>almost the entire year 13 syllabus in<br>math physics calculus because the<br>schools haven't taught it so the I'll<br>show you some evidence of that what we<br>found is that the social sciences<br>weren't struggling as badly on that<br>transition in fact if You' done<br>geography English or history by and<br>large you were reason well set up for<br>University so there's a thing going on<br>between Humanity social science and the<br>stem subjects and NCA was particularly<br>hollowing out the stem subjects so<br>there's a reason for that and it's<br>mostly to do with incremental learning<br>that maths and science require if you<br>don't know how to do multiplication you<br>can't do Algebra you cannot go further<br>and it's very<br>incremental so at the same time as um<br>all of our literacy and yacy rates were<br>declining on our International measure<br>NCA was Rising so these are the years<br>between you can see there particularly<br>that rise happened around about 2008<br>through to<br>2015 anyone know why that was the case<br>Henry might be able to tell us he was in<br>my course when we studied<br>this okay what's going on why is NCA<br>rising and rising and rising and rising<br>down<br>absolutely so what happened at this time<br>was that the government brought in<br>better Public Service standards in about<br>2010 and said to the schools we now need<br>you to get 85% Pass rates at level two<br>so the schools very quickly and they<br>said we'll publicly report this in the<br>newspaper every school will be reported<br>so the schools rapidly Rose to the<br>occasion we know that education can be<br>manipulated so they encourage students<br>into lighter and lighter weight courses<br>and got these incremental Rises that um<br>looked like very very very high rates of<br>achievement but uee that line across the<br>bottom there did not change so the<br>students weren't getting brighter they<br>were just getting civer at navigating<br>their way around NCA which allows that<br>flexibility which is really the biggest<br>problem we have with NCA and that's why<br>we call it gaming because everyone's<br>doing it because they are avoiding the<br>complex language avoiding complex maths<br>so this is what we find now this is um<br>2023 data from Enz QA<br>all you have to look is broadly um uh<br>that we have um external assist um<br>achievement standards only 13% got<br>Excellence at that internal assist wow<br>25% could get Excellence on that um but<br>the number of externalist achieve uh<br>achievement standards set across the<br>country is now down to about only um<br>onethird of the or even less<br>3 uh 3 million versus 8 million<br>achievement standards or number of<br>credits so schools have gone more and<br>more and more and more into internal<br>assessment um and less and less to the<br>external where there's more rigor um of<br>you know of knowing that one and I'm not<br>blaming schools on this this is clever<br>navigation of students the the whole<br>system incentivizes this type of<br>behavior but it's got worse and worse<br>and worse um so n NC algebra this is a<br>level one<br>um some alarming work by a student of<br>mine Sarah H for her Masters looked back<br>at who was doing algebra so this is<br>called the MCAT you guys know the MCAT<br>it's now removed but basically every<br>school in the country was expected to do<br>it in September it's one day one hour<br>every year 11 student does it and what<br>happened is that now we have if you look<br>at that disl 10 blue less than 50% of<br>schools even put their kids through that<br>test and that's DL 10<br>so the desile weight down the bottom two<br>and three and one you know one two three<br>schools always had low rates but they've<br>even decreased but now they're almost<br>the same as desl<br>10 so that is a case of teachers<br>students parents everyone removing the<br>opportunity to even do this algebra what<br>are the implications if you don't do<br>year 11 algebra what happens if you want<br>to study Physics calculus later on in<br>school you can't it's such an<br>incremental subject that if you don't do<br>it then there's absolutely no chance<br>that you'll be able to pick up math<br>later and so we have this devastating<br>fall in numeracy across New Zealand<br>encouraged by NCA as students have done<br>that so alongside that the evidence came<br>out particularly around about March 2022<br>of a deep and worrying level of literacy<br>decline so particularly this finding<br>that only 65% of 15-year-olds had basic<br>proficiency so that's the ability to<br>read something like make a contract if<br>you are renting a house so only 65% of<br>students had that emerging through<br>school um which uh is confirmed by our<br>own internal data natural monitoring and<br>so<br>on um when we look at our curriculum and<br>this is some research I've done with<br>history teachers and so on what we found<br>is that our ecliptic in open choice of<br>curriculum has encouraged some of this<br>decline so schools that were choosing<br>the history of surfing or as in a girl<br>school doing the history of<br>perfume highly appealing to student<br>interests but very low in quality of<br>knowledge and requirements of of<br>critical thinking so this is all<br>compounding an um NCA which allows a lot<br>of that navigation around these ones um<br>and this incredible uh focus on allowing<br>students to choose and follow their own<br>interests um<br>doesn't allow them to learn about worlds<br>beyond their own world and have a<br>pedagogy of disruption which is what<br>Thea would cause call the ability to<br>learn something that you didn't know<br>before you arrived at school that day um<br>and our curriculum experience um is has<br>allowed a lot of that as well so digital<br>technology I missed this earlier what<br>our own internal research found is that<br>most students in New Zealand now have<br>access devices at school but most types<br>of devices were negatively associated<br>with P scores even after controlling for<br>socioeconomic um and this was<br>particularly the case for tablets and<br>interactive whiteboards almost no merit<br>whatsoever in those things so the report<br>concluded digital devices have the<br>potential to enhance learning but there<br>are very few situations where this<br>currently happens and many in which<br>learning may be<br>hindered So Co lingering effects I won't<br>go on with this one but basically our<br>discussion before highlighted that we we<br>have this emerging issue and<br>particularly in poorer communities um<br>where students are two levels behind<br>curriculum levels um and the attainment<br>has<br>fallen the other slightly worrying thing<br>is the rise of psychological distress by<br>age if you look at this graph here the<br>older age group 75 plus if you look at<br>that on the far right turquoise by and<br>years marginally different but not much<br>what happen through the co years for 15<br>to 24 year<br>olds and this is the incredible toll co<br>co took on our young um that we are now<br>bearing the brunt of as well so for us<br>at University the mental health issue is<br>so prevalent in requests for extensions<br>for students that can't sit in the room<br>anymore uh for students that can't<br>present orally a lot of this is coming<br>through to us at University as<br>well so where are we for time<br>we've got a few minutes so let's have a<br>little bit of time for questions and<br>then I've got a one<br>slide to finish on basically<br>oh we can do five minutes yeah you you<br>can eat quicker um so let's just have a<br>quick quick look some new things the the<br>literacy numeracy co-requisites which<br>have come in this year we have there's<br>reason for these low Pass rates<br>55,000 students um sat these tests in<br>May this<br>year 46% p in numeracy 59 in reading and<br>46 in writing and this is going to be a<br>very long fix in New Zealand it<br>basically has been 15 years of decline<br>in literacy it'll take 15 to fix maybe<br>10 if we're lucky but can I just quickly<br>explain what happened in literacy we<br>used to have a national literacy program<br>till about<br>2012 and that program had books<br>resources trained every teacher in<br>literacy every teacher is a teacher of<br>literacy including you guys in 2012 hi<br>parata then national uh minister of<br>Education took out all of that funding<br>and put it into kahoi AKO K AKO is<br>allowed to choose whatever they want so<br>the focus on literacy dropped<br>immediately because you could choose<br>student agency you could choose some<br>other project and so literacy never did<br>not become a feature since then so<br>that's like uh we're coming up 12 years<br>since then 13 years of not being a<br>feature required in schools and the<br>resourcing stopped so from that moment<br>we have had a big problem in literacy so<br>this is an example of the literacy corck<br>right between 150 250 words your local<br>council's developed an outdoor space um<br>suggests why one of these options would<br>benefit so the students have to be able<br>to write by themselves and that's why we<br>need to not give them an opt out of<br>writing all the way through schooling<br>which is happening a lot or you can do<br>the visual static iment you can do um<br>the poster you can do the oral you can<br>do this no actually literacy means<br>writing as one as part of many other<br>features they have to be able to write<br>150 words so that's set benchmarked<br>against International about it was<br>actually about year nine but now year 10<br>and now it's going up to year 11 um and<br>this will take many years to fix um so<br>this is my tips for how to help students<br>succeed if they transition toward<br>University and this reflects back to the<br>pipeline that we have here so expose<br>students to complex language including<br>more abstract vocab we have to focus on<br>vocab we have to do the additional uh<br>teaching around literacy we have to<br>notice punctuation um focusing on<br>Concepts language be intentional about<br>teaching this because it won't happen by<br>osmosis and it won't happen through um<br>chat gbt so do the externals all of our<br>research confirms these have a huge<br>impact on future success especially for<br>stem um and economics students so if you<br>if they did even One external they<br>perform better at University because<br>what the externals do is they put<br>together a body of information and then<br>ask the student to deliver that and<br>that's really good for their cognitive<br>um enhancement do maths we did a study<br>at University last year at<br>Vic there was three subjects which were<br>predictors of success at University one<br>of them is math that was the most<br>confirming any student that did math<br>even did better in Humanities and social<br>science why why is math such an<br>us statistics could yeah it's a way of<br>thinking problem solving excellent It's<br>problem solving it also requires a fair<br>amount of diligence you don't get it the<br>first time often so there's a load that<br>goes with it that you wouldn't have in<br>some other subjects what are the other<br>two predicts of success can you guess<br>them two other subjects that's high<br>school that were if the students did<br>them they did immediately better at<br>University by<br>far um history is one we found in the<br>past and history because of that high<br>language load is a predict of success<br>and English with expository essays not<br>English with static images um languages<br>well done so if you do a language all<br>those students perform better so if your<br>parents make your kids do language um<br>because what is why<br>language you can't make it up you have<br>to learn something so that cognitive<br>load increases there's one more subject<br>that correlation foration are<br>they l or they doing because they are<br>bright prob both there's also a high<br>socioeconomic thing going on there<br>exactly exactly and these are I'm just<br>telling you these but they are CAU up in<br>it there's one more subject that if you<br>do you do better<br>in um not<br>elite uh<br>music yeah so basically music maths and<br>languages including tari including<br>Pacific languages all of these enhance<br>our students performance um and they are<br>certainly the middle class are doing<br>them right so there's a factor there<br>but nonetheless they show that so and my<br>last Point don't allow AI encourage l in<br>this Le of critical thought we've had<br>discussion on this one so let's have um<br>this is my last slide this was me a<br>weekend ago walking across this hairy<br>bridge in high winds um<br>basically should be resilient Learners<br>only develop when something more<br>difficult is encountered and overcome<br>that's how we build resilience we don't<br>build it from exposing them to only what<br>they knew only their interests you have<br>to do something lean into something<br>difficult to de develop resilient<br>learning um and NCA allows us a cop out<br>which is why I'm so critical of that<br>system and it really has to go and I'd<br>gone okay we kind of R have time for<br>questions I'm I'm not going anywhere um<br>does anyone have one burning question<br>and then we'll break for<br>lunch so even the change we put in place<br>of the four largest standards I think is<br>failing us because the gaming culture is<br>so prevalent now and so I think we<br>either have to fix that or have a<br>different fix um so what I think is<br>required is<br>compulsion every student has to do<br>English math science I don't know at<br>level one and that's required because<br>what that would do is everyone would<br>then teach it and every student would be<br>expected to learn it that's a really<br>different<br>culture that's a quick a quick answer<br>very problematic yep all righty do you y<br>are you am I hopeful oh thoughts are you<br>guys my hopeful thoughts is that you are<br>the teachers that know best how to teach<br>you know what students need you're the<br>experts in the classroom rise the<br>occasion because this will be a rocky<br>ride the next three to five years and<br>you guys just need to keep teaching<br>because you are the experts and the<br>students relate to you and all of that<br>expertise you have forget the curriculum<br>forget NCA teach well because um we're<br>in for a really rough couple of years<br>fixing this out why back in at the<br>moment so um we we we're just a couple<br>of minutes off quarter past and we don't<br>have the floods coming in um I'm not<br>going to take valuable time from our<br>next presentation with a long-winded<br>introduction um I've invited Brad to say<br>what he will about himself um and it's<br>just my um perfect pleasure to welcome<br>you Brad um I know we're all looking<br>forward to what you have to say of<br>Greener shoots in 2025 what an<br>interesting topic for us um Brad will<br>have to leave really sharply at two<br>o'clockish okay all right we got a<br>little bit of time so we'll just manage<br>that and then our final event of the day<br>is a panel with a current student a<br>recent Alum and our academic um speakers<br>from this morning so hopefully we just<br>go from really interesting to really<br>interesting to really interesting um<br>with that Brad thank thank you good and<br>good afternoon everyone fantastic to be<br>here very weird to be on this side of<br>the uh lecturn um stage rather than in<br>your lovely seats uh my name is Brad<br>Olson I'm the chief executive and<br>principal Economist at infometrics where<br>a private sector consultancy uh started<br>40 years ago um far before I was born uh<br>in the midst of some big changes in the<br>New Zealand economy uh and it's pretty<br>fantastic to still be going and still<br>looking at uh quite a lot of the<br>important topics that we see in everyday<br>uh Society uh I attended University here<br>uh at uh Vic back 2015 through 2018 is I<br>think and I say ish because a lot of my<br>lecturers would possibly ask if that's<br>true given that I wasn't the best<br>attending student there are two reasons<br>for that one because yes I was lazy and<br>that's how University unfortunately<br>seems to work but more importantly uh I<br>was on University Council h no not<br>University Council academic board and<br>the faculty board here so as a true nerd<br>I came to University ditched my lectures<br>and went to the boardroom instead um I'm<br>also fortunate uh in the work that I do<br>to appear quite a lot in the media and I<br>say fortunate I don't know if that's<br>true no one's tried throwing tomato yet<br>so I'll sort of take it as a good enough<br>start uh but it does mean that we sort<br>of get to talk about quite a variety of<br>things out there in the economy uh<br>yesterday I spent quite a few hours on<br>the phone at various media talking uh<br>about Regional economies uh the likes of<br>the closure of the mill and todor uh you<br>know some pretty challenging economic<br>Trends tomorrow morning at 7:25 I'm on<br>the hits talking about the best shapes<br>flavor so you know you really can't pick<br>it uh in this role what I thought I'd do<br>for you for sort of the next half an<br>hour 35ish minutes is take you through a<br>presentation that sort of got um three<br>elements to it and the brief uh for a<br>group like this is a bit tricky one I<br>want to give you a general economic<br>update uh because I'm good in it and<br>because I think you'll be interested uh<br>because the economy has a pretty big<br>impact on everything two I want to give<br>you a bit of a view of where we think uh<br>particularly parts of the jobs Market is<br>heading over the next five years or so<br>uh will have I think implications uh for<br>the people that you're teaching uh and<br>again sort of The Wider environment that<br>you're operating in and because although<br>I don't have firstand knowledge I do<br>hear secondhand that uh resource and<br>content creation is always uh valuable I<br>thought I'd provide a few uh bits and<br>Bobs that I certainly would have found<br>fairly engaging as a student that<br>hopefully you might be able to uh rip<br>off and use as well uh we do questions<br>at the end if that's all right just<br>because there is a method to The Madness<br>of the presentation uh those online I<br>don't know how you ask questions<br>probably put up a hand and something but<br>again we'll do that towards the end<br>first things first uh is the green ass<br>shirs that we're seeing in the economy<br>it's been pretty tough it's obviously uh<br>a difficult environment out there the<br>unemployment rates Rising spending<br>activities down the government's not<br>spending as much either uh but interest<br>rates have also been falling recently<br>when they start to come down when people<br>actually refix onto those lower mortgage<br>rates they'll have a bit more money<br>available and so that is why we're sort<br>of thinking that there are Greener<br>shoots more next year rather than right<br>here right now how do we get to the need<br>for greener shoots and quite clearly not<br>so green shoots at the moment that one<br>doesn't work this one might that one<br>might there we go look at that I'm I'm<br>great with the technology uh inflation<br>is back in the box now I remember as I<br>was saying to some before inflation<br>wasn't really an issue uh when I went<br>through both high school or university<br>um you could have almost just drawn a<br>line at at just below almost 2% and gone<br>look it's pretty well fine at that point<br>at infometrics we have a bunch of<br>spreadsheets uh for all of our data that<br>we bring in and we hadn't updated our<br>food price index spreadsheet uh between<br>February 2007 uh 17 and I think January<br>February 2022 um until that point which<br>it just wasn't that important and then<br>it was uh because the usual uh issues<br>around both supply and demand came into<br>play and I think that's important<br>because we sort of can see that still<br>coming through in the numbers uh now I'm<br>uh I don't know what sort of<br>presentation style I have but to be<br>honest I'm pretty sure that you can all<br>uh read so there's very few words here<br>there's just lots of pretty pictures uh<br>because I think that's a good way to<br>describe stuff long story short the red<br>box is where we're trying to get to with<br>the inflation battle somewhere between<br>2% uh well between one and three ideally<br>2% all the time uh had been outside of<br>that quite considerably for a while uh<br>and it was a good generation a good 30<br>years ago apparently so I'm told by the<br>history books uh that this last happened<br>you can see here that not all parts of<br>inflation have trended down in the same<br>way uh the headline inflation rate the<br>Orange Line back at sort of just over 2%<br>but pretty well in the in the right<br>ballpark uh tradeables though are<br>overseas based inflation uh sort of<br>driving uh a lot of that Decline and the<br>inflationary pressure that we've seen<br>basically that's oil prices uh coming<br>back quite a bit and so again<br>encouraging to see there's less pressure<br>um on petrol and what have you also so<br>nothing really to do with us in New<br>Zealand we didn't uh contribute to lower<br>oil prices we just get them imported in<br>so encouraging but not really driven by<br>us the Goods Market uh you can see there<br>in the light blue line a little bit more<br>to sort of your fundamental economics of<br>supply and demand if you will funly<br>enough when you hit households with a a<br>massive shock to their income and they<br>can't spend as much they don't spend as<br>much particularly on uh bigger and<br>larger goods and someone said to me the<br>other day they wouldn't get out of bed<br>for E less than a 70% sale at brisos and<br>I think that sort of highlights that<br>again on the goods front you just can't<br>convince people to part with their cash<br>quite as much the essentials are<br>happening sure uh but after that not<br>quite so much uh the likes at the other<br>end of the spectrum the areas we still<br>concerned about uh the likes of<br>non-tradable domestically based<br>inflation uh still too high curving down<br>slowly but surely uh but again a lot of<br>the time those pressures being driven by<br>items that are not going to be as<br>influenced by interest rates uh we're<br>seeing at the moment in particular the<br>likes of local government rates the<br>likes of uh people's rents and the likes<br>of insurance all going up now for a lot<br>of households even if interest rates<br>crippled again tomorrow those would be<br>three things that they desperately need<br>to try and put in the essentials part of<br>their uh spending so not quite as<br>influenced and then very lastly is<br>Services inflation uh when we're paying<br>for people's time wage rates have gone<br>up over time and I don't need to tell<br>any of you about the concept of sticky<br>wages uh and it tell takes a bit of time<br>then for even a Slowdown in that<br>pressure to come through we'll get to<br>that more in a moment but just a bit of<br>a scene Setter uh there we're thankful<br>as well uh that we're seeing uh interest<br>rates now come down because inflation's<br>in a better spot uh Now The Reserve Bank<br>will uh swear until the black and blue<br>in the face there was no u-turn and no<br>change in what they were doing I would<br>humbly submit that maybe there was a<br>change between the light blue line and<br>the green line uh but that's just a<br>personal opinion uh you can see though<br>look a pretty big shift uh there but<br>even then market pricing expecting quite<br>a bit more in terms of interest rate<br>Cuts already coming forward so again<br>long story short inflation was too high<br>we needed to try and diminish demand<br>because Supply can't immediately respond<br>demand has now suff uh sufficiently<br>diminished now we can ease back you will<br>note and I think this is again sort of<br>an important uh theoretical economic<br>point that where interest rates might<br>eventually land are not as low as where<br>they were before the pandemic and so it<br>is that feeling that we're not trying to<br>get to low interest rates we're not<br>trying to stimulate the economy we're<br>just trying not to strangle it quite so<br>much uh and so it is that sort of<br>everyone will talk about equilibrium<br>points I tell people it's the goldilock<br>Zone because it really is sort of wiiz<br>not too hot not too cold uh when it<br>comes to consumption now the other<br>interesting thing and this is what I uh<br>did enjoy learning as I sort of got into<br>the um sort of uh economics game uh out<br>uh in the real world away from just the<br>textbooks is that although your model<br>tells you something how it appears in<br>real life is not always the same just<br>because the official cash rate comes<br>down 50 basis points doesn't mean that<br>your mortgage rate does to demonstrate<br>that uh here are some of the special<br>mortgage rates you can get out there in<br>the market you've got over 20 plus% uh<br>deposit out there the six month and the<br>one-ear rate now the big one here is<br>this start is up until the end of<br>October at the end of October the<br>official cash rate had fallen 75 basis<br>points the one-ear uh fixed mortgage<br>rate had fallen 134 and what that sort<br>of means and what we're telling our<br>clients at the moment around the country<br>is just because there are further cuts<br>to the o come doesn't mean there will be<br>a one to one fall uh in your mortgage<br>rate now this is not personal financial<br>advice but anyone who does want to ask<br>about their mortgage and I swear it' be<br>like half of you based on every other<br>conversation I've ever had uh as an<br>economist honestly people come up in the<br>streets one thing they ask uh is that<br>again maybe it's not that there will be<br>sort of as large continued interest rate<br>Falls next year but the important thing<br>is that people will be refix onto those<br>lower rates as they do so they'll have<br>more money available to spend on not<br>their mortgage and that means more<br>consumption out there in other parts of<br>the economy now because we were talking<br>about housing and I honestly I swear<br>that in terms of media we would do sort<br>of one housing story for every other one<br>story about anything else in the economy<br>so I always do go through it because we<br>have a fascination with it in New<br>Zealand uh but again from sort of a a<br>pure uh supply and demand point of view<br>it does actually have some interesting<br>implications at the moment unfortunately<br>uh I have learned that despite getting<br>told ced's parabis back in high school<br>that apparently doesn't apply in the<br>real world and honestly if it did jesz<br>this job would be a lot easier but uh we<br>have seen a real turnaround uh in how<br>housing activity has gone you can see<br>house prices here upping themselves 40%<br>or so over the pandemic period through<br>to sort of late 2021 uh and then falling<br>back a bit and you can see that our<br>forecasts are into the future we're the<br>lowest in the market but we think house<br>prices are relatively is uh flat into<br>the future now taking a step back<br>normally if you said interest rates are<br>going to go down therefore households<br>are better able to service a mortgage<br>they have more money and all of that<br>there should be more demand there should<br>be more buyers in the market right and<br>so that should sort sort of uh per up<br>activity there's we think there's a few<br>things going on though one future<br>population growth isn't going to be as<br>strong we've got net migration that's<br>now sort of curving out uh the other<br>side uh We've also got the reserve banks<br>debt to income limits so even though you<br>might want to get a mortgage uh if the<br>has already used up its allocation of<br>DTI you might not be able to get one uh<br>and of course we've had a lot of<br>building over the last couple of years<br>and so for the first time in possibly my<br>entire economics career Supply is having<br>an impact uh on the housing market I say<br>that because uh certainly even right<br>here right now we're seeing Supply come<br>through uh this chart looks at the<br>number of houses available for sale on<br>the market across the country and you<br>can see that number has now increased<br>sort of the highest point it's been<br>since about 2015 or so again very simple<br>supply and demand says that if there are<br>more sellers out there who are looking<br>to sell and no real change in buyers as<br>of yet uh then there's a bit more<br>competitive pressure to sell in much<br>more simple terms if you go back to sort<br>of 2021 when interest rates were fairly<br>low uh Rock Bottom sort of levels you<br>could walk into the bank and about 3<br>minutes later you'd walk out with as<br>many money bags as you could possibly<br>imagine uh and you go along to the open<br>home and you and 50 other people would<br>be there and you'd throw your money bags<br>on the ground and uh try and buy the<br>house and of course the seller who was<br>has got lots of demand and only one<br>house will take whoever's going to offer<br>the most amount of money uh and if you<br>weren't that person you load up your uh<br>money bags into your wheelbarrow and<br>then walk uh next door with the other 49<br>people who missed out and you rents and<br>repeat until hopefully you got a house<br>you go back through uh then to sort of<br>late 21 more into 2022 or so as the<br>housing market was turning interest<br>rates were Rising you went into the bank<br>and about three months later they let<br>you out after looking through every Uber<br>Eats and McDonald's report uh receipt<br>you never submitted because of<br>legislation and other things and you<br>might eventually get some money but not<br>quite as much because of those High<br>interest rates uh and you went down to<br>the uh the the one house fa sale on the<br>Block and he sort of said look you're<br>the only person selling I'm the only<br>person buying um you're probably going<br>to have to adjust your expectations for<br>when you know houses were getting bit up<br>and and it sort of you know rocket high<br>prices but let's see if we can come to a<br>deal and eventually you would it took<br>about double the amount of time on the<br>market in more recent times what you've<br>been seeing is that you've got still<br>that one person who's got limited uh<br>numbers of money bags coming out of the<br>bank and they come along to the open<br>home they're like look I'm the only<br>buyer who's coming through today there's<br>still not a lot of me either you give me<br>your best price or there are five other<br>houses on the street that will um so<br>what are you going to do I have a bit<br>more uh there's too much Supply uh<br>excess Supply not enough demand<br>relatively speaking Therefore your price<br>is going to go down buddy uh and that is<br>what we're seeing house prices are<br>literally falling so again it has been<br>nice as an economist to know that sine<br>demand do actually work um the other<br>constraint of course well you just say<br>it because you're always like okay the<br>model the model says but like real life<br>please uh you can see on this one as<br>well one of the real constraints on<br>buyers at the moment is that although<br>your house value might be lower because<br>you're paying still a relatively High<br>over history house price relative to<br>your income and because you don't buy<br>your uh house outright with cash you<br>don't save up seven whole incomes over<br>seven years and spend nothing else and<br>then buy outright you have to pay it<br>with a mortgage you can see here that<br>the proportion of income you're having<br>to spend on a mortgage out across the<br>economy is it sort of record highs in<br>fact uh for those of you uh who might<br>have been like my grandfather and said<br>yes Brad but what about the 80s when<br>interest rates were at 20% good question<br>we have run the numbers because I hated<br>getting this question back in 1987 uh<br>when interest rates were about 20 odd<br>per uh the average New Zealand household<br>was spending about 48% of the average<br>household income to service the mortgage<br>today you're sort of spending about 50<br>51% or so um so it is actually wildly<br>worse now at sort of 7% interest uh<br>interest rates than it was at 20 or so<br>let's talk now about the jobs uh Market<br>it is challenging out there at the<br>moment you've seen of course the<br>increases coming through uh in the<br>unemployment rate uh one of the big<br>challenges we're seeing as well though<br>is that funly enough again to fairly<br>simple levels of supply and demand at<br>the moment there is not as much work<br>going around and therefore businesses<br>don't require as much labor therefore<br>the number of jobs are out there on<br>offer in the market has fallen quite<br>substantially in fact the number of job<br>ads out there on job sites seek trade me<br>and the Likes down at the lowest levels<br>excluding the lockdown since about 2013<br>or so and so again we're seeing a very<br>difficult uh jobs Market out there for<br>people that are moving uh and that has<br>implications uh in a few other areas now<br>of course we've seen the unemployment<br>rate increase and we think that's still<br>got a bit to go uh the latest figure<br>showed a 4.8% unemployment rate uh and<br>that was a little bit uh not quite as<br>bad as we thought part of that though is<br>because we're now seeing more people<br>that are just becoming totally<br>discouraged in the September quarter uh<br>we saw 14,000 fewer new zealanders in<br>work uh of those only 5,000 were uh an<br>increase in unemployment the other 9,000<br>went elsewhere they're not looking for<br>jobs they're not available for jobs<br>they're not keen some of them are going<br>back into study uh which is a fairly<br>natural response that we see in the<br>labor market um when it's very good<br>labor market and you can get heaps of<br>money by just walking into a job no one<br>wants to go as much to University and<br>similar or to Polytech at the other end<br>when the jobs Market gets tougher you go<br>and retrain and try and sort of set<br>yourself apart a little bit more the<br>difficult difficulty that we see at the<br>moment uh is that the unemployment is<br>very heavily concentrated amongst our<br>young people in fact up until June we<br>saw that around about 2third of all of<br>the increase in unemployment over the<br>last year was concentrated in the under<br>30s uh which makes it also not too<br>surprising that that group are now<br>heading overseas they're probably<br>thinking of doing an OE at some point in<br>the next 5 years or so and sort of went<br>well look I was going to do it in a<br>couple of years now there's not a job<br>there's not a great job prospect I might<br>as well go and have a bit of fun now uh<br>and then maybe try and find some money<br>overseas eventually come back as the job<br>market uh starts to turn up now the<br>interesting uh thing with all of this<br>again to my favorite supply and demand<br>graphs is that when you have a lot more<br>people looking for jobs and not quite as<br>many jobs available uh you see quite a<br>shift around in the likes of wage<br>pressures now we don't of course see<br>wages go down uh but what we have seen<br>is go back sort of two years and people<br>were willing to jump ship just about<br>every day uh for an extra couple of<br>dollars uh per hour in terms of uh<br>payment and and that's because that was<br>on offer you know you'd sit down and<br>people were just offering some eyeing<br>amounts as a business Runner you were<br>going I've got work to do I desperately<br>need someone uh and that means that I'm<br>going to have to put a good offer of<br>wages on the table that also meant that<br>once I got that person in I went gez as<br>a business owner now I have to figure<br>out how I pay for this now more<br>expensive resource I might increase my<br>charges oh there goes bit more inflation<br>and there goes potentially the wage<br>price spiral that we're always worried<br>about thankfully didn't happen but as<br>you can see here that increase in<br>unemployment has really quite sharply uh<br>brought back just how many uh or how big<br>the wage increases uh have been uh and<br>that is becoming a little bit more<br>normal where again those pay agreements<br>uh that are coming out uh have been<br>bigger in previous years uh not so much<br>in more recent times we've of course<br>seen also a bit of a shift uh in the way<br>that people work uh and and one of the<br>fun ones that certainly as a uh gen Z<br>myself uh sort of coming into the<br>workforce uh I'm not quite quitting<br>quite yet uh but we have seen a<br>continued sort of shift in the level of<br>working from home and I guess I just<br>highlight this because I think it is a<br>big one particularly for the Next<br>Generation coming through around how<br>they're equipped to sort of work uh<br>sustainably by themselves um that was<br>certainly one of the rude chops of<br>coming through uh to universities I went<br>from having a fairly structured program<br>where I got told what to do and got told<br>off if I didn't to sort of you know it's<br>on you and if you're going to stuff it<br>up then that's a good 10 grand down the<br>hole um every year until you Buck up uh<br>which was good learning not for me I was<br>fine everyone else though that I knew<br>questionable uh you can see here though<br>the level uh of working from home fairly<br>sustained at about a third of the<br>workforce uh back in 2006 and 2018 we<br>didn't really know how many people<br>worked from home but those green bars<br>indicate how many business how many<br>people should have been able to work<br>from home we don't know if they did or<br>not but that's how many sort of had the<br>opportunity too so you can see that sort<br>of increase quite substantially over<br>time the other shift we've seen is a<br>much larger number of twits out there in<br>the economy now I think a few of you<br>will be sitting out there and going yes<br>I know a few twits I just can't name<br>them all the time which is possibly true<br>but not for the reasons you might think<br>that's because the twits are the Tuesday<br>Wednesday Thursday workers we have seen<br>with that working from home shift uh as<br>you can see here the biggest Falls in<br>public transport use in Oakland have<br>been on Mondays and Fridays because<br>funnily enough if you going to work from<br>home a long weekend is your better<br>opportunity uh but it's just it's it's I<br>think useful to start using uh some of<br>the data that we've got out there in the<br>economy to sort of make some fairly<br>useful points I mean this is good<br>everyone tells me yes of course the<br>roads are a bit uh easier to drive on on<br>Mondays and Fridays and that uh but it's<br>sort of nice again to sort of confirm uh<br>some of those figures we're seeing a<br>shift like I said before in terms of uh<br>the number of people coming into the<br>country and heading out uh net migration<br>is falling quite rapidly now as those<br>arrivals figures come back again not as<br>much demand for foreign labor because we<br>don't have as many job opportunities<br>we've got very few and we've of course<br>got more labor capacity here at home but<br>with that spare labor capacity that<br>can't find its own job uh the Blue Line<br>the number of Departures is increasing<br>and in fact you can see here it's the<br>largest number uh of Departures that<br>we've ever seen on record uh the<br>challenging thing when we look through<br>it is again we know why a lot of the<br>younger people are going sort of in<br>their 20s and 30s um last year though we<br>had around 11,000 uh people aged 0 to9<br>who left the country uh they are a<br>little bit too young for the OE uh and<br>it does sort of show that again people<br>are actually more permanently moving as<br>entire family units uh which does have<br>implications because we've got a very<br>low birth rate and that means that over<br>time not immediately but in sort of 20<br>to 30 years time there are going to be a<br>lot of people that leave the workforce<br>and not quite as many that come in uh so<br>unless we're all starting to use cck GPT<br>and similar to do our jobs or are<br>willing to do three times as much work<br>we're going to find ourselves in a very<br>tricky<br>situation the world's also continually<br>changing and one of the things that has<br>fascinated me the most this year is uh<br>with the 40th anniversary Adam metric is<br>uh going back and looking at how the<br>economy Str the economic structure has<br>shifted over time uh this looks at GDP<br>shares in<br>1984 through uh to 2024 and you can see<br>just how massive those have been uh the<br>likes of manufacturing used to make up<br>good sort of 22 203% of GDP uh it's<br>worth quite a lot less below 10% at the<br>same time business services Professional<br>Services uh all of that uh has massively<br>increased going from just over 10% uh<br>back in the 80s now through to over a<br>quarter of all economic activity coming<br>from that area so uh two critical things<br>the one big shift two you are very much<br>helping uh support the bulk of the New<br>Zealand economy into the future the<br>single largest proportion of economic<br>activity so thank you uh I have to say<br>there we are uh and this gets to the<br>point where I wanted to make just<br>briefly around uh how those sort of<br>changes are coming through uh for the<br>likes of the students that you'll be<br>teaching and where they might be heading<br>off to next uh we are seeing some<br>difficult times at the moment again uh<br>because there's lower economic activity<br>because there's not as much demand for<br>jobs and similar and you can see here<br>that our expectation for employment<br>growth is sort of Fairly uh uh horrible<br>until sort of mid 2025 and the big sort<br>of view there at the moment is that once<br>interest rates come through and people<br>actually have a bit more money in their<br>back pocket they will spend that more<br>money then business sales get better<br>then businesses need more people and so<br>on and so forth until that point though<br>there's a lot of households out there<br>going look I know if I can last or to<br>next June I get more money and I'm okay<br>but until that point I'm worried that I<br>get fired because unemployment is still<br>Rising there's still not enough money in<br>the economy for the number of jobs that<br>might be there uh if that's the case<br>even if I haven't yet been let go I'm<br>going to act a bit more like that as a<br>household I'm going to limit my spending<br>I'm going to keep a bit more uh in<br>reserve and so you can see it takes<br>until that sort of second half of 2025<br>for employment growth to really uh start<br>to spark up again what does that mean<br>though longer term because again we're<br>going through a very unusual situation<br>where we sort of went in in 2019 the<br>economy's in normal is economic zone Co<br>hits we lock down the economy it can't<br>work the economy takes a dive we get out<br>of lockdown we start to stimulate the<br>economy like never before and funly<br>enough it responds and so it sort of<br>goes into it goes too high we bring in<br>higher interest rates to try and curb<br>that high level of economic activity uh<br>and it's now done so and we're trying to<br>Now find that goldilock zone what we<br>have done then is looked out sort of at<br>2029 or so and gone where will the jobs<br>be uh relative to now the biggest<br>increas is in health uh and the biggest<br>primary driver is that is because we<br>have an aging population uh and that<br>requires more and more services over<br>time uh more older people who require<br>more services who live longer uh will<br>come through net group the most but it's<br>that second group what we call<br>Professional scientific and Technical<br>Services that's where good old<br>economists uh sit that's where<br>accounting uh business analysts<br>consultancies uh and the lik set as well<br>uh so again the really outside of that<br>big demographic shift is that Focus uh<br>on what we do think of as highly skilled<br>jobs it is where that critical thinking<br>comes into play when I came through to<br>the uh Victoria University Wellington<br>open Day in 2014 it must have been I sat<br>down with a careers adviser and I see<br>I want to do a double degree I want to<br>do a Bachelor of Arts uh majoring in<br>international relations and political<br>science and a bachor of Commerce<br>majoring an economics and public policy<br>they said awful idea do do you can't you<br>can't do that much work uh do that in<br>the first year then pick two of your<br>four majors that you actually want to<br>continue with and I nodded along<br>vigorously and then completely like<br>normal disregarded that advice and did<br>all four for my entire degree the reason<br>I tell you that is not because I'm<br>clearly bad with numbers and don't<br>listen uh but more importantly because<br>doing that sort of uh conjoint degree<br>meant that I got the good sort of<br>theoretical and practical understanding<br>uh here at the business school but also<br>got the critical thinking uh part that<br>helped uh and still continues to help in<br>the humanity space today around how do<br>we sort of think about some of those<br>complex issues uh for the world so that<br>professional scientific and Technical<br>Services is a huge part if we don't get<br>that we don't get productivity growth in<br>the country we don't get development uh<br>over time we don't increase people's uh<br>living stand standards and pay and what<br>have you so I'm quite glad to see that<br>still there but it also is a bit of a<br>rod for our own back that we do need to<br>continue to push<br>towards a few business Trends uh that<br>again I think sort of jel in probably<br>with the conversations that you were<br>having earlier this morning uh but also<br>things that I think uh if you can push<br>in your roles uh will ensure that we<br>have a much stronger uh much more<br>forward-looking uh Workforce into the<br>future and that's looking at the<br>proportion of firms that are currently<br>innovating in 2023 now the fact that<br>none of not all of any of these bars are<br>at 100% sort of concerns me uh the<br>reason I show you this is because we<br>have seen time and time again that when<br>economic downturns hit we see young<br>people get kicked out the the quickest<br>if you're a business leader you go look<br>I could either kick someone out that's<br>got 20 minutes experience or someone<br>that's got 20 years which one do I keep<br>it's sort of a no-brainer except for the<br>way that we're doing business these days<br>is changing rapidly having to figure out<br>how to use different Technologies how to<br>innovate is more critical than ever<br>before and so I show you this because<br>one a lot of businesses are innovating<br>and two you're very much setting up<br>people to innovate uh tomorrow why is it<br>important well uh because I've sort of<br>been there firsthand when it comes to<br>trying different things and thinking<br>about those innovative solutions this is<br>going to sound a little bit old school<br>but back uh in uh when we started we<br>headed into lockdown as a firm uh we<br>were trying to write lots of economic<br>notes what's happening in the economy<br>how bad is it going to get is this the<br>Great Depression 2.0 things were<br>changing so rapidly that by the time I<br>drafted a note sent it through to the<br>forecaster he signed it out things had<br>changed already and so we couldn't<br>actually issue it to clients and so I<br>went to the managing director one day uh<br>on a zoom call while I was sitting in my<br>flat in Wellington on my ironing board<br>because I didn't have a real desk and I<br>said to him look can I use my corporate<br>credit card to buy a zoom account so we<br>can do webinars for clients and he<br>looked back at me on the screen and said<br>Brad I understood less than half that<br>sentence but sure go for it what's the<br>harm that next day we helded a webinar<br>for 400 of our clients and that was four<br>times as many clients we'd talked to in<br>the last four years is alone uh it sort<br>of just got me that again you know it<br>wasn't fancy it wasn't particularly well<br>polished it was again from the ironing<br>board uh but it came through and it was<br>that sort of level of innovation that<br>we're now starting to see more and more<br>of uh we're seeing as well today just<br>how important using digital technology<br>uh is as well and in particular uh and<br>and I I won't ask anyone in the audience<br>to uh provide their age but it's always<br>an interesting view how many people go<br>either not along or or sort of look at<br>me with a questioning look back in my<br>parents day they tell me if they wanted<br>to go up for a nice meal at a restaurant<br>they'd ask around they'd get a good<br>recommendation and then they'd Go My<br>Generation if I can't look at a menu<br>online and figure out what I'm going to<br>pre-order I'm not going there it could<br>have the best reviews ever I'm not going<br>if I can't pre-order so again sort of<br>how we use technology uh is important<br>doesn't mean you'll have to get into Tik<br>Tok videos I promise uh but thinking<br>about sort of those uh those Innovative<br>outcomes will be important to the<br>economy in the future the other one uh<br>the other sort of to that I wanted to<br>profile this chart looks at the<br>proportion of work or the proportion of<br>employees uh that businesses train in<br>various things every year now sort of<br>thankfully given that we have um still<br>some fairly poor health and safety<br>results health and safety uh trainings<br>at the top the two that I want to focus<br>on the most though uh is the management<br>skills there in the middle you can see<br>that it's sort of only a smaller<br>proportion uh of people get management<br>skills both in terms of the bar there is<br>not quite as long but also the majority<br>of the bar is a smaller proportion of<br>the workforce in that business only one<br>to % of that Workforce in any business<br>there uh getting management and<br>supervising skills um I'm not saying<br>that that becomes the new thing you<br>teach in your classrooms but again that<br>sort of element of leadership and<br>management is something that we're quite<br>wo for at in New Zealand and the other<br>one down the list a little bit more uh<br>is computer skills uh now I'm not going<br>to lie as someone again who now runs a<br>business if anyone comes into my<br>business and can't use uh some of the<br>basic uh tools if they can't use Excel<br>they're probably not getting a look in<br>the front door when I went to high<br>school that wasn't something that that<br>we did a whole bunch of and so I'm not<br>sure where everyone is at at the moment<br>I'm sort of hoping I'm preaching it to<br>the converted uh but those sort of<br>skills how to use technology and similar<br>is really critical uh as we go forward<br>and sort of similar you can see the<br>proportions here with most a lot of<br>businesses now focusing on cloud<br>computing so again uh how we're using<br>technology uh is changing quite<br>substantially the one that worries me<br>when we went through all of these<br>figures uh on sort of business activity<br>is how many people are using the web to<br>order now I've just told you important<br>it is and that's true you'll see here<br>though that even in 2022 uh quite a few<br>businesses were still not online there<br>and it does sort of speak to the fact<br>that again we're uh seeing in some<br>businesses quite a shift in terms of who<br>has uh older workers who have uh younger<br>workers who have a bit more of a mix in<br>the middle uh but a real sort of focus<br>area there for us I'm going to skip<br>through this next one the this bit is<br>one of my fun ones around spending and<br>again comes a lot back to the likes of<br>uh supply and demand my favorite concept<br>um but I think this makes it a bit real<br>after quite a bout of inflation how do<br>kiwis actually spend their money we've<br>got again all of our models and similar<br>uh but this gives you a bit of an idea<br>for the first time ever in the 30 odd<br>years that we've been tracking how new<br>zealanders spend their money every<br>single category saw an increase in<br>spending in the uh couple of years<br>through to 2023 compared to 2019 and<br>that's not unusual given that we have<br>seen High very high levels of inflation<br>uh but it is I think important to sort<br>of see the the hierarchy of needs that<br>people have you put a roof over your<br>head to start with you feed yourself the<br>reason other expenditure is there is<br>that's where interest payments sit uh as<br>a proportion and then you go down<br>through the lanks uh ranks Insurance<br>that's in uh miscellaneous which is why<br>it's so High um education is at the<br>bottom not because we don't value it but<br>because it gets paid for by government a<br>lot more than it gets paid for by<br>households so a little bit out there uh<br>but you can see the likes of alcohol<br>Alcohol Tobacco drugs uh Communications<br>uh Footwear and shoes again more of a<br>want than a need<br>and so just again I think interesting to<br>sort of see those Dynamics play out when<br>we look at Food uh because it is one of<br>again my more uh favorite topics so you<br>can see uh various uh levels of shift<br>here the biggest one uh biggest increase<br>came through on grocery food when we dug<br>into that that was around the likes of<br>noodles and and often particularly<br>convenience Foods uh it is a real big<br>Trend across the country that we've seen<br>that although people are still very keen<br>of course to get their veggies and their<br>fresh meats and similar convenience is<br>now much more important option to a lot<br>of households uh so just an interesting<br>Trend one that I will give you though uh<br>you'll see there was a very minor<br>adjustment in the likes of Meat ptry and<br>Fish now um I'm going to try crowd<br>participation participation we'll see<br>how this goes how many of you are in<br>your classroom sort of straight up<br>economics teachers in the room hands up<br>please how many of you have given you an<br>example at some point in your career<br>around the likes of inferia and normal<br>goods and the move from uh Min to stake<br>is the example I got taught is that what<br>still sometimes used<br>the fascinating thing is that when I've<br>looked into the detailed data for the<br>first time ever we've gone back towards<br>mints we've moved away from stake and<br>gone back towards mints in the last four<br>years or so because of the pricing<br>element so fun fact that you can use<br>there it is still very much an inferior<br>normal good uh relationship it's just<br>that sometimes when the old budget gets<br>a bit stretched you have to push back uh<br>the other way uh and then you can see<br>that just lastly uh with a bit of a<br>shift in the relativity so proportionate<br>uh proportional wise you the percentage<br>Point change but increase coming through<br>on food as a household I value that the<br>most other expenditure there with my<br>interest rates is the next biggest thing<br>that I put my shift and money towards<br>and then miscellaneous with the likes of<br>insurance then the other stuff funly<br>enough wreck uh and creative and culture<br>don't care as much about don't need to<br>go and be quite as fun because I've got<br>sort of Life to Live um so again<br>interesting how you sort of see that<br>play out now I said I'd give you a few<br>examples to steal and I sort of would<br>recommend well feel free to steal them<br>because again these are the ones that<br>always I think get the most interest<br>here inflation of course is very<br>difficult when you put uh you know the<br>likes of an index up on a chart and you<br>have to talk about how you have to<br>adjust the price of phones and how<br>stuff's changed over time here is my<br>very simple example of inflation two<br>minute noodles everyone knows what tent<br>noodles is now this is even better<br>because I'm presenting here at a<br>university and let me tell you that when<br>people get to University this is a<br>staple item and you can see there uh<br>this is liter this is just straight up<br>prices you can see back in 2011 or so<br>you paid about $250 in the supermarket<br>for the cheapest five pack of terent<br>noodles and it then basically stayed<br>around that price in fact it even got a<br>bit better up until inflation really<br>started to get going and then in more<br>recent times it started to curve out<br>again if you've never seen a better uh<br>if you've seen a better example of<br>inflation Trends please let me know<br>because I'm happy to replace it but I<br>think that's pretty on uh when it comes<br>to those uh ones the other one again uh<br>from trying to sort of describe the<br>supply and demand piece with sort of a<br>few more specific examples is uh<br>everyone's uh luxury necessity the<br>chocolate bar uh you can see increases<br>in the chocolate bar price over time<br>it's sort of hovering around at the<br>moment because every now and then you<br>get a good special at the supermarket<br>and stats picks up only the cheapest<br>price uh but you can see that it has<br>sort of trended higher over time that's<br>because Coco production across the world<br>is now the lowest in eight years and so<br>funnily enough demand hasn't changed if<br>anything that's probably gone up uh but<br>production is now quite a bit lower and<br>so again we've now seen that the price<br>of Coco on the international market is<br>triple what it was uh a couple of years<br>ago an even more Stark example now I<br>give you that because everyone likes<br>chocolate it's very relatable but how<br>many of you have bought olive oil in the<br>last couple of<br>weeks how any of you made it here today<br>and you know you had to choose one oil<br>and you chose olive oil and not real oil<br>sort of gets me but you can see very<br>much there the sharp increase uh in<br>olive oil prices again over uh the last<br>sort of year and a bit and again very<br>much to uh demand and Supply here is the<br>amount of olive oil produced uh in the<br>global economy or at least in the EU<br>which is a major producer and so again<br>you can sort of see very clearly that<br>increasing or sort of sustained level of<br>demand uh decreasing Supply means that<br>your price uh has adjusted quite<br>substantially um more than have to send<br>the slides out as well afterwards I just<br>sort of thought Jesus someone had showed<br>me this back at high school I reckon I<br>would have got it I got it eventually<br>don't get me wrong my economic SE was<br>fantastic Mr blogs put fun boys high but<br>uh these I think might well be uh<br>helpful right the last couple that I<br>want to uh discuss with very very<br>briefly and then I'll turn it to<br>questions I promise uh is around those<br>gr shs normally in the economics game uh<br>you can never get an economist happy<br>we've always got something we want to<br>moan about next and so I've tried to<br>change my presentations around to end on<br>a little bit more uh of a high note we<br>know that unlike almost any other time<br>in New Zealand's economic history we've<br>actually we're primed now for a better<br>economic Trend back if you look at the<br>liks of the GFC people didn't know that<br>interest rates were going to come down<br>they weren't aware that an economic<br>stock was going to hit so they weren't<br>uh thinking about that and sort of ready<br>to spend again this time we knew it was<br>going to happen we knew we got told that<br>there was going to be a recession we got<br>told the interest rates were going to be<br>higher and we were told that once we got<br>rid of inflation things would start to<br>calm down and people are now responding<br>like that you can see on this chart that<br>around sort of 30 40% of uh new lending<br>uh and refix on the mortgage book has<br>been fixed for just six month rates<br>people are primed they know that they<br>will get lower interest rates soon so<br>they're sort of moving towards that that<br>means two important things firstly uh<br>we're a bit uh more ready for that<br>better economic time to come normally<br>we'd say it sort of takes 12 to 18<br>months for monetary policy to work for<br>uh those better Economic Times to come<br>through because we're ready for it this<br>time it might just take those more six<br>to n months which is why we think mid<br>2025 is when things start to perk up a<br>bit more the second just because<br>everyone's going short doesn't mean it's<br>necessarily the best option and as I<br>said before not personal advice but<br>worthwhile looking at the differences<br>there because last time I looked the<br>onee fixed interest rate uh was actually<br>quite a bit lower than the six month<br>even though you get to refix on it uh on<br>the second one sooner so again some<br>Trends and the biggest one for me<br>probably the most important economic<br>indicator out there it's not GDP because<br>gosh would be here forever without<br>trying to explain it is money uh if you<br>and I and everyone else there have money<br>in our wallets and we're willing to take<br>it out and spend it then the economy is<br>starting to do okay if we're not it<br>suggests that either we don't have money<br>because we don't have a job we do have<br>money and we're too scared about the<br>economy to actually spend it and so the<br>fact that you've started to see that<br>little bit of a curve up in uh spending<br>activity this looks at monthly card<br>spending it's not huge still down on a<br>year ago still a depressed economic<br>environment but a little bit of a trend<br>change does uh suggest that we starting<br>to see those early signs there is light<br>at the end of the economic tunnel it's<br>slightly longer tunnel than we hoped for<br>but it is genuine sunlight this time<br>rather than another train coming down<br>the tracks with that I'll turn off uh<br>the economic fog horn I'm going to take<br>a breath for a moment I hope you all<br>will too uh but more than happy to take<br>any and all questions thank you very<br>seeing in youth unemployment is purely<br>because of of that piece where<br>businesses are going look I have to make<br>a tough choice around who I keep uh and<br>it's generally last and first out I mean<br>and that has like I said very<br>unfortunately but it's been the way it's<br>always been what is I think um<br>exacerbating that a bit more is that<br>during the pandemic you had and and I<br>exper I expect some of you will have<br>experienced this yourself you had a lot<br>of young people sort of on the custom<br>sort of 16 17 18 age group who were<br>going look I could stay at school and I<br>might not particularly like it all that<br>much I might be sort of you know a<br>moderate student or I could go out and<br>get some pretty serious money out in the<br>economy because people willing to pay<br>big we didn't have migration coming in<br>and so that normal migration Gap had to<br>be filled by uh you know often and it<br>was younger workers we saw youth<br>employment at that point for like the um<br>15 to 19 age group increased by like 10<br>12% over the last couple of years that<br>group then is the first one that starts<br>to get biffed out uh when businesses<br>don't need as many people and<br>importantly as migration comes back in<br>and then businesses have a choice do I<br>get someone who's got some skills from<br>overseas or someone who has no skills<br>than is available I used to take the one<br>that was available because they were<br>here and no one else was Now sort of<br>I've got more Choice um so that is<br>coming through a lot more we are<br>certainly hearing from a few more<br>business people that they are trying to<br>keep their young people on board and I<br>think the difference at the moment is<br>that the smart businesses those who have<br>gone gez it was really difficult to hire<br>the last couple of years I've really<br>struggled uh to try and bring people in<br>now if I let people go I'm going to find<br>myself in two years time desperately<br>trying to hiire them back and they're<br>not going to be there so I'm actually<br>trying to secure my supply chain because<br>this the labor market is sort of a<br>longer term burn but for a lot of other<br>businesses they're going look I don't<br>want to get rid of people but just quite<br>simply I had this many people to do this<br>much work now I've got this much work<br>and that many people I've got to trim it<br>back a bit not going to lie on this is<br>worth casting no shade to those who<br>signed the letter I feel like calling it<br>a bunch of economists is put there are<br>no Bank economists uh there's one I<br>think maybe two private sector<br>economists that wouldn't I would call it<br>more sort of an academic economics group<br>and I'm not that's not casting any shade<br>it's just that I I feel like if you had<br>like one teacher and a whole bunch of<br>other people and they said it was a<br>teachers group you'd probably equally go<br>that SP on the nose anyway look there<br>are quite clearly political views on<br>that in terms of the right level uh of<br>spending and similar I would fall and I<br>feel this is really um Orthodox<br>economics that you don't want to try and<br>over stimulate the economy and that<br>although it might not have directly been<br>why inflation got higher high levels of<br>government spending had uh meant the<br>last couple of years that you had quite<br>a lot of money that was uh purely<br>fueling higher prices particularly for<br>wages across the economy than actually<br>delivering a whole lot of productive<br>stuff also means and I think this is<br>probably almost more uh my worry and the<br>reason that I don't support the<br>particular L and I do broadly support<br>the thrust of how the government is is<br>thinking to limit its spending although<br>not always uh the way and manner that<br>they might be doing it is that you want<br>generally uh the economy uh to be or<br>sorry the government to be acting sort<br>of counter cyclical when the private<br>sector is going great guns and doing a<br>lot of building and doing a lot of<br>investment doing a lot of business<br>activity government doesn't need to prop<br>up the economy all it's going to do then<br>is rebadge other economic activity it's<br>going to displace and it's going to lead<br>to price<br>increases when the economy comes off the<br>boil when the private sector can't<br>invest is when the government should<br>push ahead and so sort of a classic<br>example of that at the moment is the<br>construction Market the number of<br>building consents in the economy got<br>about 10 20% higher than the actual<br>building sector could cope with and so<br>everyone paid huge amounts more for<br>their uh buildings across the country<br>now K Ora and the government don't have<br>as much money because they spent all of<br>their money over the last couple of<br>years they haven't got as much now so<br>they can't actually sort of lean in<br>against it so I would rather that we<br>sort of try and balance it out so that<br>government can spend a bit more in the<br>leaner Economic Times but I think also<br>this is a consequence of really<br>borrowing 5 years worth of money in one<br>year in Co and some point you've got to<br>pay that back either you keep sort of<br>taking out a mortgage on your mortgage<br>on a mortgage or you have to sort of<br>trim it back um I must say I think the<br>challenge though and you see this<br>particularly in Wellington uh where<br>there's been a lot of cutbacks of course<br>in the public sector and a lot of other<br>areas and now people are going well you<br>know I've lost Services what I think uh<br>I would have almost rather have seen<br>from government instead of sort of<br>everyone gets a six or 7% across the<br>board cut as Government go here are my<br>top 10 priorities let's resource those<br>top 10 priorities appropriately and I'm<br>sorry if you're not on the top 10 list<br>and you don't get as much resource and<br>you might have to trim it back but what<br>you're seeing now is the government<br>trying to plow ah head with a number of<br>initiatives and then finding they might<br>not have as much resource because I've<br>sort of had a trim across the board so<br>again being a bit more strategic about<br>it a little bit more surgical than<br>Sledgehammer would be helpful but as a<br>country we've spent quite a considerable<br>about more proportionately as a<br>percentage of GDP in previous times we<br>haven't necessarily got the right<br>results from it so I'm okay with us<br>limiting back the spending but there is<br>a Goldie Lock Zone I think that's sort<br>of the point we went from probably too<br>low to at one point very high and now<br>we're trying to find somewhere else in<br>the<br>middle both of those questions and and I<br>say this because at an aggregate level<br>if you don't get this one this sector<br>working and doing better the rest don't<br>really matter all that much is the<br>primary sector uh AGR tech and and what<br>have you it's it's just such a big part<br>of what we do you couldn't replace it<br>easily overnight you couldn't replace<br>all of the jobs the export the money<br>that goes into it uh but we can get some<br>productivity gains over time uh and if<br>you do that then you get sort of wider<br>gains because then we could export some<br>of that technology uh and similar but it<br>is stuff across the board I think um<br>probably depends a little bit on what<br>part of the productivity picture we look<br>at like rocket lab and some of that<br>advanced um rocketry and and sort of<br>what sits both in the manufacturing and<br>Engineering sort of space huge huge<br>potential uh but also sort of you're not<br>going to replace an entire sector of the<br>New Zealand economy with that<br>immediately like that will be a longer<br>burn uh but you look at other things the<br>likes of um oh sorry to that point if<br>you don't have good education if we're<br>not having people that can do their<br>times taes we're not going to generate a<br>lot of Rocket scientists so like that<br>that's fairly critical on how we support<br>people through the education system<br>there uh but you look at the the other<br>area that I often look at is<br>construction um we're actually less<br>productive now on construction than we<br>were 30 40 years ago and I do think that<br>a large part of that is because we want<br>to do everything custom you look at um<br>for example any of you from denen or<br>down no you're all from oh there is<br>someone so like hospital I think is a<br>very good yet very challenging example<br>why have we over the last 40 years not<br>come up with the New Zealand hospital<br>build blueprint and gone you know what<br>Chuck one there we need one in F day<br>Chuck one there we need one toonga<br>cheuck one there no it has to be bespoke<br>which means that we spend inordinate<br>amount of money on all of these<br>different designs then when they don't<br>pan out we spend a bit more money trying<br>to fix it and what have you same with<br>skill builds same with uh the likes of<br>even roads and similar you look at the<br>likes of State Highway 25A uh the reason<br>that got banged up<br>on budget and on time in fact ahead of<br>time is because they stole a bridge from<br>another site and took it there and said<br>we're going to bang that one up like it<br>some of that productivity stuff is<br>looking at it and going how do we<br>actually sort of make this streamline<br>because we seem to make a lot of<br>complexity for ourselves we might need<br>to that's why sort of to my point before<br>don't try and recreate those breaths<br>email me steal them like I don't care<br>I'd rather you use them and make it<br>useful than you sort of spend your time<br>trying to recreate them because I sort<br>of feel like as a country we need to<br>figure out how we can legitimately and<br>legally rip off the goods stuff and make<br>it context dependent for us but like<br>results than that now so the latest<br>inflation for Q3 um September quarter<br>was 2.2 so we're back in the band we're<br>very very close to back in the band well<br>very close to the midpoint we're back in<br>the band uh core inflation is falling in<br>as well so I think that's encouraging<br>the worry I think is that we're starting<br>to see across the world uh and you see<br>this particularly in the US for example<br>uh that once we sort of lose what we<br>call Price discipline it it does um it<br>can take a bit of time to bring that<br>back and I guess to that point before uh<br>that I was making wage rates and similar<br>there was a worry I guess that because<br>for the longest time no one was willing<br>to put up prices for the decade after<br>the GFC every business in town New<br>Zealand Australia the world sort of if I<br>up my prices and the competitor down the<br>road is going to undercut Me by not<br>changing their prices and they'll get my<br>business so I'm going to try and hold<br>the line whereas through the pandemic<br>people went you know what I've had I was<br>budgeting for a 5% increase in my cost<br>this year but I got 10 so I'm I'm<br>already 5% down next year I was thinking<br>it might another 10% but I'm 5% down so<br>that's now a 15% Gap I need to raise<br>through and I got inflation wrong last<br>year so I add an extra 5% on top of that<br>so I'm now at 20 uh and maybe just maybe<br>uh because I'm worried about future<br>inflation I'll just add a little bit in<br>ahead of time so you get 25 so<br>businesses sort of went from being very<br>disciplined on pricing to very not uh<br>and so I think what you're starting to<br>see now is just that worry from The<br>Reserve Bank over how quickly they can<br>bring interest rates down uh it's clear<br>that they're happier to go faster<br>because there's not as much inflationary<br>pressure in the economy uh and they<br>think that there's obviously quite a bit<br>of weakness so they're trying to sort of<br>go faster with your 50 basis points we<br>had been wondering whether they might go<br>75 uh in the November meeting next week<br>we think that's sort of a little bit off<br>the table just because some of the data<br>hasn't been like as egregiously bad as<br>we thought it might have been you know<br>if the economy really was cratering uh<br>then you know they'd be calls for doing<br>more the big question I think is that um<br>all of this exists in sort of a<br>backwards frame the latest inflation<br>data we have is really from about 3<br>months ago at this point uh you know a<br>lot of the spending data we've got is a<br>couple of months old so we're trying to<br>make sort of future decisions for what<br>might affect the economy in 12 months<br>time Based on data that we had three<br>months ago so there's a little bit of<br>what we call the coordination problem of<br>trying to marry that all together long<br>story short we've got enough information<br>at the moment that the New Zealand<br>economy is weaker it's not generating as<br>much inflation therefore we can bring<br>interest rates down but to that graph I<br>show towards the start we're not<br>bringing them down to ultra low levels<br>and trying to stimulate the economy<br>we're just trying to sort of take our<br>foot off the break so it's not an<br>accelerator but it's less break that<br>we're trying to<br>apply data funly enough to get and this<br>is one of the frustrations with New<br>Zealand data and a lot of data around<br>the world very good levels of average<br>numbers and and sort of you know high<br>level Aggregates trying to figure out<br>the distribution of anything of of<br>spending of you know housing outcomes or<br>whatever very difficult because we sort<br>of have to get some fairly expensive<br>surveys and as you'll probably all<br>remember the last time we did a census<br>back in 2018 at didn't work out so well<br>20 23 was better but does just mean that<br>distribution stuff is a bit more<br>difficult uh in general and this is<br>you're going to I I suspect laugh but<br>this is correct when we about halfway<br>through the pandemic treasury did an<br>update of New Zealand sort of income<br>distribution estimates and one thing<br>that came through was that New Zealand<br>had actually become uh less unequal than<br>before which seemed very wild when uh<br>people's house prices had massively<br>increased and a whole bunch of people<br>couldn't Buy what it was was you had<br>three groups in society on this model to<br>try and simplify and tire paper into a<br>few seconds you had a bunch of renters<br>you had a bunch of homeowners and then<br>at the end you had a bunch of really<br>really wealthy people who had a few<br>homes but also just lots of wealth and<br>like stocks and stuff the renters didn't<br>change they didn't really go anywhere<br>they didn't sort of have a massive<br>increase they didn't have a massive<br>decrease your group in the middle who<br>had houses their houses got uh more<br>expensive so their wealth increased and<br>so they became closer the middle point<br>of that second group came closer to<br>where the really wealthy people were so<br>technically on the distribution you had<br>no change in the people hardest hit in<br>society but the sort of pretty well off<br>and the very well off became ever so<br>slightly closer so inequality went ever<br>so slightly down that's the very broad<br>shift of it I I think the worry that<br>we're seeing at the moment is that there<br>are still a number of people in society<br>uh you look at the likes of the housing<br>register the number of people looking<br>for uh State housing you look at the<br>number of people going to food banks<br>number of people on benefits all of<br>those figures are increasing so I think<br>that's why as well in a lot of the<br>economic data there's almost never a<br>time that I get a question like this one<br>where I can go you know what here's a<br>spreadsheet and exactly here's your<br>answer it is normally a sort of a level<br>of triangulation of how can I find a few<br>data points that try and push us towards<br>the right area so on the whole I think<br>we're still in a pretty good space<br>particularly relative to other countries<br>you know New Zealand is still a fairly<br>good place uh to grow not saying that<br>we're without our issues though and I<br>think that's the issue is that those who<br>are down uh in the most challenging<br>parts of society in ter their income in<br>terms of particularly their housing<br>situation uh that's where the issues<br>come from MSD does a very good report<br>every year or two where they look at<br>some of these figures and the thing that<br>always strikes me with that is that<br>there's only really one metric you need<br>to care about it's not food prices it's<br>not the cost of fuel it's not anything<br>else it's housing almost pure and simple<br>how people's rental costs go how<br>people's income uh relative to the likes<br>of mortgage payments go is the biggest<br>determinant of whether or not they've<br>got money left at the end of the week so<br>so housing and and I'm genuinely uh you<br>know more upbeat about housing at the<br>moment the uh home ownership rate<br>increased for the first time since the<br>'90s last year uh sort that one out and<br>I think we're on our way to a better<br>Society<br>overall thank you so much Brad thank you<br>all</p></main><footer style="margin-top: 2rem; background: #0001; padding: 2rem; text-align:
