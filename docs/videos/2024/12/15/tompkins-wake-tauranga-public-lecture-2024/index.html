engage<br>engagement with the law and legal issues<br>in 21st century<br>R it's our legal obligation as lawyers<br>to uphold the rule of law and if the<br>rule of law is to be upheld we need<br>people to care about the values<br>underpinning the law and to engage<br>positively and critically with legal<br>issues in an informed<br>way uh we've been blessed by the caliber<br>of speakers uh in this lecture since<br>it's the inaugural lecture in 2021 so<br>far we've had justice Susan Gladbrook<br>the Chief Justice uh Dame Helen wi<br>kelman last year Natalie coats speaking<br>about Tik hunger uh and our guest<br>lecturer this year continues um to<br>uphold the Mana and the quality of of of<br>speaker that we we've been blessed with<br>he has a distinguished career not only<br>as a lawyer but also as a politician<br>Wellington born and educated<br>was a partner at Brandon brookfields uh<br>in the late 80s to 1990 and then from 91<br>to 2002 at belali where he acted as a<br>young partner

government Yes<br>Minister on his role as attorney general<br>and hupu toi on try settlements uh both<br>would make excellent Christmas gifts for<br>your friends and<br>family but on a more serious note um on<br>a more serious note if more people could<br>read<br>hangi uh our public discourse on on<br>matters Rel to the treaty would be<br>greatly improved because it's a terrific<br>book and Chris's legal and political<br>career and in particular his very<br>important work as Minister for tra and<br>negotiations I think stands as an<br>example of what can be achieved when<br>tolerance Good Will and open-mindedness<br>are combined with a sense of fairness<br>and a desire for justice so it's my very<br>very great pleasure to ask you to help<br>up<br>Roo I'm so so honored to be asked to<br>give this lecture uh earlier this year<br>Victoria University asked me to give the<br>lria Seal's lecture in honor of lacricia<br>whom some of you uh may have uh or may<br>remember uh took a very principled stand<br>on the end life<br>legislation uh and uh to be asked to<br>speak here uh given the previous<br>speakers uh fills me with trepidation<br>but before I talk about that can I<br>simply acknowledge the University of w<br>the vice Chancellor whom I've known for<br>many years would be very disappointed if<br>I didn't say he was an outstanding Vice<br>Chancellor U leading the uh University<br>into a great future uh and of course one<br>of the jewels in the crown um is this<br>particular law faculty which in the last<br>34 or so years has grown to play such an<br>important role<br>in legal education in New Zealand and I<br>acknowledged the dean uh and uh I had no<br>idea I mentioned to her a few weeks ago<br>I had been up and upia for a case in the<br>Constitutional court she knew exactly<br>what villagers were involved and what<br>the issues were so she's a Dean who's<br>right on top of things uh and uh I did<br>say to her um and to one of her<br>colleagues who teaches private<br>international law or the conflict of<br>laws which has always been my favorite<br>subject and I help teach it at Victoria<br>she said there's a bit of a gap uh in<br>the curriculum there so I've offered my<br>services to the law faculty uh teaching<br>choice of Law and taught and Forum<br>convenience and all sorts of other<br>interesting subjects because it is such<br>a magnificent subject can I also<br>acknowledge Tomkins wake uh James told<br>me that when he came back from fresh<br>fields to go to the firm it was still a<br>relatively small firm well it now has a<br>floor uh in my building where bankside<br>Chambers is in shortland Street uh and<br>it's growing here uh and it is one of<br>the bigger law firms uh in the country<br>with a huge<br>reputation and I think it's a sign of<br>their contribution to this community uh<br>that it takes part uh and sponsors this<br>very important<br>lecture I said I was filled with<br>trepidation because on the way and<br>Marcus uh told me uh who had given the<br>great address over the years I wasn't<br>too worried about the Chief Justice with<br>respect Susan glazbrook terrifies me but<br>it was uh it was Natalie coats who<br>worried me because um uh Katherine cook<br>from Tomkins wake and I were trying to<br>organize the itinerary and I said well<br>I'm in court at the moment uh and I just<br>hope I can get my submissions through<br>I've been acting for rangitane omano 2<br>an interested party in a uh Maca case uh<br>which runs which covers the coastline<br>from kpet to manowa 2 and one of the<br>council acting as Natalie coats who uh<br>is representing Niti rooa based in otaki<br>and so I finished my submissions she was<br>about to start but I ran out the door uh<br>to uh come up here uh but she she is a<br>formidable opponent uh and a person with<br>a tremendous future ahead of her so I<br>hope uh that I don't uh fail you tonight<br>with my address and uh I hope I don't<br>Fame anyone um can I also acknowledge<br>just to show you a I'm getting old but B<br>the memory is not all that bad can I<br>acknowledge someone in the audience<br>tonight I haven't seen for it must be<br>well over 30 years uh retired Lindsay<br>Moore and I appeared before him and he<br>he told me he and I'm sure he won't mind<br>my telling you his age he's 85 and<br>retired now he was from davies's Burton<br>Henderson and more went on the bench<br>years ago there he is up there H and I<br>appeared before him in a very<br>interesting case which he instantly<br>remembered maybe it was because of my<br>crummy submissions but uh it was a<br>person who was uh very sad story<br>chopping trees or trimming<br>trees and there was a huge power line an<br>interprovincial power line going through<br>and he came within the Ark of the of the<br>uh around the uh the actual um line and<br>was electrocuted and died and so we had<br>to deal with that issue but it's great<br>to see you again and um it was always a<br>pleasure to<br>appear before you because well you never<br>yelled at people uh you were always<br>thoroughly Pleasant and you let us get<br>away with blue murder<br>um so let me some people say why are you<br>talking about prus well let me tell you<br>why a couple of months ago uh I was in<br>London and visited one of my favorite<br>haunts hatchards Bookshop in<br>Picadilly the primary purpose for my<br>visit to hatchards was to find a book I<br>could read on the long flight back and<br>we've all done that before<br>um I did purchase Shalom lappin's latest<br>book the new<br>anti-Semitism the Resurgence of an<br>ancient hatred in the modern world uh a<br>topic which both both greatly disturbs<br>and interests me but with respect to Mr<br>lapen I didn't think I could cope with<br>reading a book on the ancient lethal<br>Obsession for 12,000 mil then I came<br>across the recently published book book<br>by Robert Harris entitled precipice and<br>maybe it's his background in journalism<br>but frankly Harris's books have always<br>been to me extremely<br>readable as you know they take us from<br>ancient Rome there His Brilliant Cicero<br>Trilogy to an alternative history of the<br>Second World War Fatherland to the hunt<br>for the men who signed the death warrant<br>of Charles I act of Oblivion he's a<br>master uh of engaging with the facts but<br>does so in a readable and an enjoyable<br>way so I purchased precipice and for<br>12,000 mil I read and enjoyed the book<br>as some of you may know and thank you<br>for the exhortation to people to buy my<br>two books for a Christmas present can I<br>I'm not Robert Harris's agent but I may<br>you know buy it and uh read it um at<br>oopi um as some of you may know it's set<br>in the summer of 1914 that and probably<br>glorious uh summer before the Great War<br>opened a chasm in the world Harris had<br>access to many documents in the<br>possession of the bonom Carter<br>family and through those documents he<br>constructed what I thought was a<br>brilliant<br>novel uh not only about a clandestine<br>love affair but also about the emerging<br>chaos of the<br>world the story centers around the<br>relationship between prime minister<br>Herbert asworth and The Honorable<br>venisha Stanley who was the daughter of<br>Lord and Lady Sheffield although only 26<br>she's in the midst of a romantic<br>engagement with a 61-year-old liberal<br>prime minister every day the Prime<br>Minister wrote to her how he found time<br>for personal letters Escapes Me Ireland<br>was on the verge of Revolution and a<br>European war was on the horizon and the<br>novel describes the dazzling uh life of<br>Venicia and how a prime minister faced<br>with so many problems manage to spare<br>time each day to write to her as War<br>breaks out and the political wrangling<br>over military strategy commences we see<br>the unveiling of a world disaster so<br>this is a novel about love it's a novel<br>about power about how the son of<br>Northern non-conformists Rose to the<br>highest in the land it's a story which<br>one reminds us once again uh that in the<br>leadup to the first world war the great<br>States people and monarchs of the age<br>committed a Litany of errors and plunged<br>the world into a<br>catastrophe the promise in<br>1914 was that quote the boys would be<br>home for Christmas but that was a<br>foolish prediction the survivors<br>returned home some 4 years later their<br>lives ruined their lives destroyed and<br>as we know that wasn't the end but<br>merely the Prelude to the continuation<br>of the first world war in those Dreadful<br>years 1939 to<br>45 that is why and it surprises some of<br>my right-wing friends that I'm a great<br>supporter of the conscientious objectors<br>who took a principled stand against The<br>Madness of the first world war for some<br>years I was a trustee of the archible<br>Baxter Memorial trust uh and was<br>delighted when former deputy prime<br>minister Grant Robertson dedicated the<br>memorial some years ago it's just off<br>George Street in denan and its<br>development caused controversy all those<br>years later there were numerous white<br>feathers left at the memorial the day it<br>was dedicated so precipice is a good<br>read a reminder of how the world almost<br>slept walked into a cataclysm Little<br>Steps may may not mean very much but<br>they can lead and in the case of the<br>years 1914 did lead the world into a<br>disaster uh so this is the inspiration<br>for my speech tonight because to put it<br>bluntly if we're not careful uh then I<br>think we'll end up on a precipice and<br>could find ourselves in an environment<br>no one either wanted or expected a<br>couple of years<br>ago I don't intend to be a Jeremiah and<br>list all the possible areas where things<br>could go wrong but having been attorney<br>general and Minister for Treaty of wangi<br>negotiations I want to spend some time<br>on two topics first race relations and<br>secondly the relationship between<br>Parliament and the<br>Judiciary for nine years I was so very<br>lucky to be the min for Treaty of white<br>tongy<br>negotiations like the honorable sir<br>Michael Cullen before me I regarded it<br>as the most interesting portfolio I had<br>although I have to confess and I can't<br>tell you anything the Spooks were indeed<br>interesting as well I was very fortunate<br>to have a supportive Minister of Finance<br>in Bill English and a really interested<br>and supportive prime minister in John<br>key in those years the key National<br>government achieved a great deal this<br>was a continuation of the work of Helen<br>Clark's Administration and before that<br>the bulgier administration which had<br>started the historical process in the<br>1990s it's always been<br>bipartisan and both National and labor<br>governments can be pleased with what<br>they have<br>achieved we all know that the historical<br>treaty settlement process is not perfect<br>for one thing the most powerful<br>institution in the land the crown seems<br>to hold all the cards when negotiating<br>with ewi it was my experience however<br>that skilled negotiators often achieve<br>far more than they could have expected<br>when the negotiations began for example<br>TTI Krueger was a masterful negotiator<br>for nuho and managed to persuade the<br>crown that urua should be taken out of<br>the national parks regime given its own<br>legal personality and that Toho should<br>run it there are many examples of that<br>across the<br>Motu what I want to emphasize this<br>evening is that those settlements have<br>been highly successful and I want to<br>point you to a number of examples first<br>Roka not Natalie's client in otaki but<br>the rwa based in<br>tooa its Ro is the southern wetto rwa<br>ewi development limited is the<br>commercial and investment arm of Roka<br>its role is to manage the settlement<br>putia to ensure that rwa have adequate<br>Financial Resources to support its e<br>members its initial settlement was $50<br>million in land claims with payment made<br>and<br>2012 participation in the W River ewe<br>settlement that delivered about 30<br>million uh spread through payments over<br>14<br>years and participation in the cni E<br>forestry treeo settlement which gave rwa<br>a stake in the land underlying kangaro<br>forest and access to<br>rentals I just want to tell you what<br>they have achieved since<br>settlement over the period 2013 to 2024<br>inclusive the development arm of Roka<br>has delivered an internal rate of return<br>of about<br>8.1% per anom this performance is not<br>only well beyond what might one might<br>earn an interest at the bank or what<br>funding would cost the crown but it's<br>also substantially above balance kiwi a<br>funds which take equivalent risks and<br>have tended to return 5 to 6% over the<br>last decade total distributions to Roka<br>uh of around $41<br>million and a growth to the balance<br>sheet to over<br>$250<br>million quite apart from Economic<br>Development Roka has continued to<br>provide Health and Social Services to<br>the communities who live within its<br>takiar these Services include transition<br>to adulthood supporting rangatahi who<br>have been in state care to transition to<br>Independence mental health services for<br>adults chronic conditions Services katoa<br>Services uh copapa Mori and Western<br>therapeutic service which supports Faro<br>to keep their tamariki out of state care<br>and that's just some of it the ewe also<br>has a number of Partnerships with the<br>crown which are delivering very very<br>good<br>results so Roka has always aspired to<br>uphold themselves in their relationship<br>with their people their communities<br>their fena and waterways through the<br>values that underpin<br>ranga ranga to rwa is not about<br>asserting Authority but is about<br>leadership about being responsible to<br>others and for others about being able<br>to bring people together and maintain<br>and enhance the well-being of both<br>people and the land the wonderful<br>wonderful people and as long as I live I<br>will never forget the day as minister<br>they took me in a bus around the RO uh<br>from the Kay through to TIAA Mutu the<br>wonderful kind gentle people who have<br>achieved so much for their people and<br>the broader community in South wetto let<br>me also talk about an e at the other end<br>of the country I've acknowledged I've<br>been acting for them uh in the MAA<br>hearing ritan man were<br>too rangitane settled in 2016 with a it<br>was a relatively small Quantum of about<br>13.5 million today the asset base is uh<br>about 21 million it's asset get rich and<br>cash poor if one includes other<br>rangitane representative entities one<br>adds another 13 million or so to the uh<br>to the<br>kitty the Investment Trust has always<br>taken a conservative approach mainly<br>investing in the property Market they've<br>done a number of joint ventures in<br>paliston north for example with the<br>quest<br>Hotel once again this is an ewi which<br>has provided wonderful social services<br>in its Community theyve been a provider<br>of Fano order health and well-being<br>Services since<br>1993 not needing to wait for their<br>settlement uh to begin the pathway but<br>more so leveraging of various government<br>policies and their services include a<br>General Medical Practice funo Ora<br>practice nurses breast screen health<br>promotion nutrition and physical<br>activities program uh smok<br>uh treatment uh Cancer Care coordinators<br>Financial mentors employment hubs food<br>banks and so many more theyve built an<br>excellent relationship with the paliston<br>north city council and the horizons<br>Regional Council they've been working<br>with the community to improve the Mano 2<br>hour they've developed PA sites along<br>the river and have recently launched<br>hear kahi where one can click on a QR<br>code along the river<br>and learn a lot of the history of both<br>the A and<br>ritan so from a very low commercial base<br>rangitane have worked incredibly well<br>over the last decade they want to<br>exercise their rangat Tanga without the<br>crown telling people what is best<br>they're not asking for handouts they're<br>simply asking the crown to work<br>honorably with them by listening to them<br>and supporting their Pathways there are<br>so many other examples I could give of<br>ewe that are doing great things<br>particularly following their historical<br>treaty settlements the point I want to<br>make is that the these E are making a<br>significant commercial and social<br>contribution to New Zealand and are<br>working hard in their communities to<br>complement the work of crown agencies<br>and so often they're more effective than<br>Crown agencies it's often said that if<br>this country's not careful we could be<br>in a similar economic position to<br>Argentina by about<br>2050 so it baffles me that so many<br>people regard or look at e in a negative<br>light regard e with suspicion regard the<br>legitimate aspirations as Tong of fowa<br>as something to worry about rather than<br>something to rejoice in ewi commercial<br>Enterprises are generally excellent and<br>we should be supporting them as major<br>contributors to the new economy we<br>should also be recognizing the<br>significant social and Community role<br>they play the crown has to understand<br>that the settlement commitments don't<br>end when the settlement legislation<br>receives its third reading in Parliament<br>if there's one phrase I hate it's the if<br>someone says to me oh well that<br>settlement's done and dusted it's never<br>done and dusted the obligations<br>continue that's why I set up the<br>postsettlement commitments unit in<br>2014 its purpose was to develop a<br>register of commitments and make sure<br>that those commitments are understood<br>and honored by all Crown agencies into<br>the future and that also include well<br>not the local government and agency of<br>the crown but I think local government<br>also has access to the register of<br>commitments as you may be aware the<br>major problem with the crown is so often<br>it has no institutional memory that's<br>why the unit was established and when<br>Kelvin Davis became the minister for<br>Crown marui relations he built on my<br>work and developed T ariti and that<br>agency has done an excellent job and I<br>commend kovin for that<br>initiative that's why I'm disturbed at<br>the pro proposal to disband Tara fiti<br>and transfer its functions to tuni ketti<br>the ministry for Mari<br>development I don't think tpk<br>understands the important Mandate of<br>teiti and I don't think it will do a<br>particularly good job upholding Crown<br>treaty commitments into the future so<br>far as I understand the primary<br>responsibility for upholding treaty<br>commitments is going to be done in tpk<br>Regional Offices it won't work in my<br>experience and I say this advisedly tpk<br>was always an incompetent Ministry after<br>I became associate minister of Mai<br>Affairs I asked John ke for example if I<br>could form reform to Turi fena Mai<br>because John luxon who had been minister<br>in the<br>1990s uh said uh it needed to be<br>reformed and told me that the settings<br>weren't quite<br>right and so John Key said go for it<br>this reform was an opportunity to<br>address a very difficult question about<br>about making uh tangoa land more<br>productive PWC had published a report<br>some years earlier that said if if<br>Marian could be made more productive it<br>could with inputs of a couple of billion<br>dollars contribute more than six billion<br>dollar to the Mari economy I would have<br>thought it was worth the investment tpk<br>had no AB ility to deal with the issue<br>and so policy support had to be provided<br>to it so that this important Tu a could<br>be addressed I don't think the change to<br>disband T fiti is a good one it has some<br>simply outstanding civil servants I<br>always used to refer to them or the<br>people in the office of treaty<br>settlements as the Jesuits of the Civil<br>Service many of them are going to lose<br>their jobs or be transferred into the<br>Wasteland of TP K and I feel very sorry<br>for them because I think the work they<br>did was extremely important and that<br>what is happening is simply<br>wrong the greatest threat to treaty<br>settlements is the crown and the fact as<br>I have said that it has no institutional<br>memory uh and I to give you an<br>illustration of that I remember during<br>the kerodex debate meeting with<br>officials from from the from the<br>ministry for the environment you may<br>recall that EA kicking up a fuss about<br>essentially FMA 10 being part of the<br>kerx reserve and I said to the<br>officials could you tell me about your<br>understanding of the 1992 fishery<br>settlement and they looked at me the way<br>a Jersey car looks at you extraordinary<br>vacancy they had no idea about what I<br>was talking about and that's why Tara<br>fitti is important you can't delegate<br>those tasks to the Regional Offices of<br>tpk that you need an organization like<br>Tata fiti with its eye on the ball and<br>in private life since leaving Parliament<br>there have been a number of occasion<br>when e have contacted me and said are<br>the settlements defective in some<br>respects what do we do about it Woodburn<br>Air Force Space is an example because of<br>pasas and you could go to T fiti engage<br>with the minister for Crown Mari<br>relations and things were sorted out um<br>thanks to what Co did in that particular<br>case as a result of the Coalition<br>agreement drawn up between the three<br>parties a number of legislative reforms<br>were initiated in<br>2023 the reform to the marine and<br>Coastal act 2011 following the decision<br>of the court of appeal in the Edwards<br>case several members of the Coalition<br>were appalled at what they thought was<br>the deliberate re reading down of the<br>requirements of section 58 of meca I<br>don't intend to say too much about this<br>topic tonight because the Supreme Court<br>has today uh just uh begun uh hearing<br>the appeal from the court of appeal and<br>it would be inappropriate comment on<br>something which is very much a live<br>issue before the court what I can say<br>however is that legislating at the same<br>time uh before all levels of appeal have<br>been heard is unusual and not<br>necessarily desirable it goes without<br>saying that Parliament can legislate to<br>respond to a negative judicial decision<br>some years ago the Supreme Court<br>delivered a decision which the then<br>speaker Lockwood Smith said raised an<br>important question of privilege it<br>concerned the way the Supreme Court had<br>treated parliamentary privilege in a<br>matter before it concerning<br>defamation the privilege of this<br>committee which I chaed thought the<br>Supreme Court had got it wrong and we<br>decided that we needed to clarify the<br>law of parliamentary privilege so<br>parliament passed the Parliamentary<br>privilege act 2014 which is being<br>Incorporated in the parliament bill<br>which is currently being considered by<br>Parliament the point is that the reform<br>occurred after the Supreme Court<br>decision and was done in a careful and<br>deliberate manner there was no rush to<br>legislate as I said to someone the other<br>day uh when the foreshore and seabed Act<br>was passed about 20,000 people marched<br>on Parliament when the marine and<br>Coastal Act was in its final legislative<br>change uh stages about a 100 people<br>marched on Parliament the issue had been<br>settled on all parties in the parliament<br>at that time New Zealand first was not<br>there uh dealt with the issue<br>professionally and I particularly<br>acknowledge and men David Parker who is<br>Shadow attorney general detoxified the<br>argument refused to indulge in argument<br>by epithet uh dealt with the matter for<br>his party in a very responsible and<br>measured way and uh I have a lot of time<br>for David Parker and um I received the<br>rank of KC when I represented the I uh<br>the new New Zealand and the icj Judith<br>received it a little while ago and I<br>really think David Parker was a very<br>good attorney general and he too<br>deserves the<br>rank the government's indicated it<br>wishes to introduce legislation to<br>provide greater guidance for the court<br>uh on treaty Clauses uh the Minister of<br>Justice has expressed concern about<br>Provisions like section four of the<br>conservation act that provides that<br>those administering the ACT shall have<br>regard to the principles of the treaty<br>he says such General Clauses are<br>unacceptable and greater Precision is<br>required well there's nothing new here I<br>spent some time talking about careful<br>drafting of legislation in my first<br>speech to Parliament and as attorney<br>general I was always insistent that<br>generalized Provisions were<br>unsatisfactory every time I considered a<br>treaty Clause I refused to have the<br>general approach but preferred the<br>specific for example when the historic<br>places Act was reformed in<br>2014 uh I insisted on a specific<br>provision so one not<br>get that that bill is on the ver either<br>on the verge of or is about or has been<br>introduced I'm not too concerned about<br>that uh although the minister is not the<br>first one to have considered the need<br>for careful<br>Drafting and as you all know the treaty<br>principles legislation has excited much<br>debate throughout the land I agree with<br>those who say the legislation is foolish<br>and<br>misconceived it seems to proceed on the<br>basis that the treaty is one between<br>races which is wrong it's one between<br>the crown and Tonga def fenua it should<br>never have been agreed to it's going to<br>cause huge hurt throughout the land a<br>coalition agreement is nowhere as<br>important as a treaty between the crown<br>and Mai I can really do no more than<br>what the first minister of treaty<br>negotiations said in a recent letter to<br>The Herald and I do want to quote he<br>talks about the Titi Islands the Titi<br>islands are situated just south of<br>rakiura Stewart Island for many<br>centuries nahu members visited the<br>island to M Harvest mutton birds and do<br>so to this day similar food Gathering<br>activities occurred throughout New<br>Zealand by local uh um um Mai members<br>the right to do this was recognized by<br>the English common law when European<br>settlement began known as customary<br>rights they were confirmed by the treaty<br>and survived whatever Powers were<br>transferred to the British crown by the<br>treaty such customary rights therefore<br>were not created by the treaty and<br>remain in existence until either<br>abandoned or extinguished by legislation<br>once lost they can't be recovered<br>accordingly the nahu treaty settlement<br>in 1998 ack knowledge this position and<br>confirm their exclusive right to harvest<br>mutton Birds if as act suggests all new<br>zealanders must have equal<br>rights then in the future everybody can<br>Harvest mutton birds or Nah whose rights<br>would need to be extinguished by<br>legislation with compensation paid for<br>the loss it's difficult to see any<br>benefit to anyone from that in the 1980s<br>Doug says Parliament inserted the phrase<br>the principles of the treaty and<br>legislation and invited the courts to<br>declare what they were for the F past 40<br>years it's tried to do that so the<br>intention of the party is in 1840 can be<br>fulfilled<br>today the courts have held that the<br>treaty gave the government the right to<br>introduce its policies required parties<br>to act in the utmost good faith obliged<br>the government to consult with tangena<br>over any matters which affect them and<br>pay compensation if there were breaches<br>in its attempt to follow the principles<br>the government over the past few years<br>has introduced practices and procedures<br>which many find<br>unacceptable this is the reference to<br>the previous government these include<br>giving preference to Mari over other<br>kiwi and the provision of some health<br>services and in the case of potable<br>water giving Mari the so ability to<br>decide what constituted acceptable water<br>standards but it's not the principles<br>which are the problem rather it's the<br>way they've been used to justify certain<br>policy positions why why it is necessary<br>then to change the principles is hard to<br>Fathom and then majestically he says the<br>treaty was a declaration of Good Will by<br>the crown and Mari endless debate over<br>the words and differing versions doesn't<br>really help when most fairm minded kiwi<br>regard each other with respect and and<br>wish Each Other Well nor is it helpful<br>for Mari uh leaders to continually blame<br>colonization the fact colonization<br>occurred is not going to change we need<br>to appreciate that we are all different<br>with distinctive cultures and sometimes<br>specific needs tangena as our indigenous<br>people have a very special place and we<br>would all be the poorer without it<br>finally he says the ACT party claims<br>that no other country is successful when<br>it treats its citizens differently due<br>to their particular race that is<br>nonsense amongst others in Sweden the<br>Sami reindeer people the first nation<br>bands of Canada and the United States<br>and the Aboriginal tribes in Australia<br>have all recognized rights protected by<br>law as countries they are no less<br>successful than we are we are blessed to<br>live in this beautiful country and able<br>to debate issues freely in doing so we<br>should do so respectfully well I can't<br>add to that because I agree with<br>everything he said there's a side to me<br>that says introduce the<br>bill refer it to a select committee and<br>then annihilate it through the power of<br>argument but it's fair to say and I keep<br>pretty good contact with all my buddies<br>and various e around the country that<br>it's really<br>hurting it seems to be a hostile and<br>unnecessary act many years ago as part<br>of the confidence and Supply arrangement<br>with New Zealand first Helen Clark<br>agreed to something similar New Zealand<br>first MP Doug won introduced legislation<br>to delete all the provisions of the<br>treaty from legislation the legislation<br>was garbage but it received a first<br>reading and then was voted down after it<br>was returned from select committee I was<br>on the Justice select committee at the<br>time it was fairly obvious from day one<br>the bill had been badly drafted was<br>incoherent and should not proceed there<br>are some who say well it was good enough<br>for Helen to agree to something like<br>this why not luxen I think the point is<br>that things have moved on so much since<br>the early 2000s that coupled with all<br>the other changes which have been<br>introduced since<br>2023 it's seen as a hostile act the<br>world is a different place the<br>circumstances are different uh that is<br>why in my opinion the bill and the fact<br>of the bill uh is going to have serious<br>retrograde consequences for the<br>community so what I've endeavored to<br>show and there's a lot more I could say<br>but by reference to those matters in the<br>first part of this address is that if<br>we're not on the precipice we're in<br>danger of heading in that direction in<br>many many areas of governmental activity<br>there's a perception of hostility toward<br>ewi and Mai if we're not careful we run<br>the the risk that things could unravel<br>very quickly indeed in particular treaty<br>settlements may not be regarded as full<br>and final if the Crown's Cavalier about<br>recognizing its commitments under<br>settlement legislation then why should<br>people regard them as full and final the<br>meca situation is serious for the<br>reasons expressed but I've got to be<br>careful what I say the treaty principles<br>Bill uh has the potential to cause huge<br>damage there are other issues I could<br>refer to but are the main ones at the<br>present time it seems so<br>unfortunate given the very good space we<br>were in a few years ago settled ewe are<br>achieving so much not only for their<br>members but for the wider Community they<br>huge contributors to New Zealand with<br>the potential to contribute even<br>more The increased use of ter seems to<br>upset a few people but this is an an<br>inevitable development we should all be<br>so pleased about I remember meeting s<br>muray of nauri or nauri and naah a<br>couple of years ago she told me how she<br>was beaten at primary school for<br>speaking too these sorts of things did<br>happen and we're moving into a good<br>space with the use of too who cares if<br>the ministry of culture and Heritage is<br>also known know as Mana to<br>taonga and when you think about it toa's<br>been called toaa since since it opened<br>and I don't even think it has a um an<br>English term these changes are Petty and<br>unnecessary and contribute to the<br>feeling of hostility on the part of mini<br>Mari John key is right he told the<br>national party it's at its conference a<br>couple of months ago to tone down the<br>stuff and I don't think he would have<br>tolerated David Seymour's bill for a<br>minute I have a feel and I know what he<br>did with the kerx legislation because I<br>was in his office and it he said well<br>the Mari part is going to pull out of<br>the Coalition or the confidence of<br>Supply Arrangement he said that Bill's<br>going nowhere and that's what he would<br>do uh with the uh legislation he I could<br>almost imagine him saying it David this<br>bill's not going to proceed and if<br>Seymour had a tantrum and said he go to<br>the Cross benches John would have<br>responded along the lines of something<br>like we do whatever you like but you<br>need to know that I'll personally stand<br>against you in Epsom and I will destroy<br>you<br>um John John just didn't take prisoners<br>and frankly we've got to bring an end to<br>this treaty principles idiocy as quickly<br>as<br>possible the second topic and I'm<br>conscious that like M thater I could go<br>on and on and on uh until the men gray<br>suits still are in U I want to say<br>something about Parliament and the<br>Judiciary<br>because I think there's a a<br>deteriorating relationship here and I<br>don't think it's a very good look for<br>Parliament to be dealing with the treat<br>with the uh the Maca reforms at the very<br>time uh that uh the Supreme Court's<br>dealing with the the first big appeal<br>and they used to be the natif fatwa or<br>case talks about mutual respect and<br>mutual restraint you not seeing a lot of<br>it at the moment there's always going to<br>be tension between the branches of<br>government and I've already referred to<br>the way Parliament responded to the<br>decision of the Supreme Court and and<br>Lee and the Attorney General when with<br>respect the Supreme Court got it<br>completely wrong on parliamentary<br>privilege<br>um so what's causing the problem One<br>automatically does blame the political<br>class for not showing judges enough<br>respect commentators like Sir Jeffrey<br>Palmer have always proclaimed that the<br>Judiciary is the safest branch of<br>government<br>well that's not right at all there's no<br>safe branch of government all the<br>branches have to act with circumspection<br>respect and recognize<br>boundaries there is admittedly a slight<br>tendency on the part of senior courts<br>these days to uh read down legislation<br>the current approach uh this new<br>approach to statutory interpretation<br>that gets me from time to time is this<br>can't possibly have been the intention<br>of Parliament and interpret the bill as<br>they think fit if judges do move too far<br>into being political operators then the<br>political class is going to react judges<br>may not like a legislative provision but<br>it's not for them to ignore very clear<br>statutory language I have concerns about<br>the waitangi tribunal because for some<br>years it's been acting outside its<br>original mandate um it has a tendency to<br>play politics and I refer you to through<br>my example over to Turi fena which I<br>said had the ability to make a major<br>contribution to the economy what were<br>the key aspects of that reform first<br>decisions about Mari Lan should be made<br>by a majority of engage owners not<br>simply owners the anti- deluvian<br>registration system needed to be updated<br>to provide Mari with the same quality<br>regulatory Service as the land transfer<br>system provides dispute resolution<br>procedures needed updating and as James<br>will know the high court<br>rules you will know the high court rules<br>were updated in<br>1984 to modernize civil procedure in the<br>country um and U the idea was the judge<br>should no no longer micromanage cases<br>but let parties get on with it intervene<br>only where necessary and I was Keen to<br>see those reforms in the Mari land Court<br>they were very worthwhile reforms a huge<br>amount of policy work was undertaken by<br>John Grant in particular the M mlc<br>judges were opposed to the reforms uh<br>they adopted a political stance they<br>published articles on the mlc website<br>attacking the reforms they needed to be<br>told by someone whose name I better not<br>mention to take them down some mlc staff<br>complained to the tribunal uh but that<br>that was essentially a stitch up while<br>Mari lanc Court judges didn't sit on<br>that particular tribunal the tribunal<br>still CRI empis the lack of consultation<br>which was wrong never before had a<br>legislative reform had such a<br>comprehensive consultation as attorney<br>general moreover I authorized the<br>publication of exposure drafts to enable<br>consultation to be more effective it was<br>probably the most consulted on uh and<br>carefully drafted piece of legislation<br>in my career that notwithstanding the<br>tribunal was critical uh and uh that<br>involvement in politics by the Judiciary<br>was inappropriate and<br>unconstitutional uh judges should not be<br>uh sub seeking support for opposition<br>from uh opposition MPS the tribunal<br>needs reform which goes beyond the<br>appointment of new members some members<br>are highly excited by the appointment of<br>Richard Preble to the tribunal it will<br>mean nothing some years ago I appointed<br>Paul Swain the former labor MP for matak<br>a really good fellow he was a crown<br>negotiator for me particularly in<br>taranaki I thought he'd make an<br>excellent contribution in his 5 years on<br>the tribunal the presiding chair never<br>appointed him to one hearing the<br>tendency was always to appoint those who<br>could be relied on to be supportive of<br>the presiding judge and the same thing's<br>going to happen to Preble so don't hold<br>your<br>breath the tribunal's done some very<br>important work over the years<br>particularly in the historical area but<br>the time has come for a number of<br>important reforms um I think it needs to<br>be chaired by um a former Senior High<br>Court Judge uh its membership needs to<br>be much what it was like when the<br>tribunal started people like Paul Tim<br>John neone eminent new zealanders from<br>Georgina to huu from various areas uh<br>with various um areas of expertise who<br>can be relied on to write wise reports<br>in the public interest and the tribunal<br>of Administration needs to be radically<br>reformed um another example of where the<br>tribunal acted politically was in<br>relation to the<br>fuia report published in 2018 it<br>specifically criticized me for the work<br>I've been doing with fak toia said I was<br>pushing those negotiations along for<br>political reasons uh and that was simply<br>just plain wrong I'd been working with f<br>toia for seven years and when they<br>indicated to me that some of their<br>internal disputes were resolved I was<br>very happy even an election year to try<br>and move toward a settlement indeed I've<br>been criticized on the pip pip I tooku<br>Morgan a year or so earlier for not<br>giving uh fakoya negotiations priority<br>so if the tribunal wants to play<br>politics they run the risk of<br>undermining the important work it<br>undertakes inevitably there is going to<br>be push back from politicians I don't<br>think that appointing a few new members<br>is going to be sufficient I think<br>wholesale reform is<br>required as I said there's always going<br>to be tension between Parliament the<br>executive and the Judiciary sometimes<br>that tension's a good thing but we need<br>to be very careful that it doesn't go<br>too far and create a crisis uh and as I<br>say there are signs that we could be<br>heading in that direction there are many<br>other topics I could address but I've<br>chosen the ones I've talked about<br>tonight because I have some real anxiety<br>that things aren't going too well I<br>cannot really understand why these<br>punitive and negative policies towards<br>Tanga to fenua need to be pursued as I<br>see things as I've said the growth of<br>Tero is fantastic we in this country are<br>all in this project together Tanga fenua<br>are not the enemy as I've endeavored to<br>show with both ritan and Roka<br>these people are outstanding<br>contributors to their community and to<br>the long-term economic and social<br>prospects of their Pho much of what is<br>happening for Mari appears to be<br>mean-spirited Petty and hurtful it won't<br>achieve anything we need to be far more<br>optimistic about this country and<br>recognize the contribution that everyone<br>has to make<br>the world was plunged into chaos in<br>1914 and very few people saw it coming<br>even when war was declared everyone<br>thought it would be over soon in 1914<br>very few people could have foretold the<br>outcome of World War I the destruction<br>of three Empires two of them the the<br>Roman off and the hapsburg one very<br>ancient the foundations being laid for<br>the rise of extremist M and another conf<br>conflagration some years later lives<br>ruined opportunities Miss foolishness<br>and carage now I'm not saying that this<br>is the inevitable fate for New Zealand<br>if we're not careful I doubt whether<br>we'll have a civil war but the point of<br>this address unlike the Americans but<br>the point of this address and the<br>reference to the concept of the<br>precipice is to illustrate that in some<br>areas we're not in a good space and all<br>players need to be very careful not to<br>go too far they also need to be aware<br>that what may seem to be little steps of<br>no<br>confidence can have devastating<br>consequences I'm fond of saying as I<br>said in both my first and last speeches<br>in Parliament that some countries have<br>problems and New Zealand has a project<br>it's a project that will challenge<br>people from time time it will irritate<br>people but that's no bad thing we should<br>be the best little country on Earth we<br>can do better in the areas I've been<br>talking about tonight we can do better<br>on I have the uh task of moderating<br>questions and and so I'd like you to<br>think about sever of the questions you<br>might like to ask<br>Chris and I would just make a couple of<br>comments so that you've got a chance to<br>and asking a question himself um I was<br>pleased Chris that you I clarified that<br>and it shows the the maturity of T now<br>that Mecca doesn't mean the gold match<br>of discussion about<br>that<br>days and I was reflecting on the<br>situation we have with K and the as<br>wondering R and Rani would be better to<br>stay<br>over so uh one question I have for you<br>in in relation to the<br>uh the courts and parliament's<br>relationship uh of comes on the heels<br>of inies discussion recently on that<br>very issue um and the decision in the<br>Alis case in which Justice Will Young<br>was the desending judge and the<br>proposition that uh the T decision has<br>overturned longstanding rules of how<br>customary law is incorporated uh into<br>our law and not left a framework to<br>replace it so I don't know if you'd like<br>particularisms oh well<br>um that decision could have been reached<br>without reference to Tung but the<br>problem I have of the decision is that<br>the<br>maai committee on<br>defamation looked very closely at reform<br>of the law of defamation in the early<br>1990s and one of the things they<br>specifically looked at was whether or<br>not there could be an ability on the<br>part of um the executives of an estate<br>or family members to seek a declaration<br>not damages a declaration that a<br>deceased person had been<br>defamed and for some reason I asked Doug<br>Graham who was Minister of Justice at<br>the time why he didn't U uh legislate<br>for that and he couldn't remember but it<br>never got into the defamation act 1992<br>so I think it's an area which is<br>probably an i it's an idea whose time<br>has come but it's not for the judges to<br>make law it really should have been for<br>Parliament to look at it as part of any<br>reforms to the defamation act that's the<br>way I do it but um but the other point<br>is I think if you were going to go down<br>that path you could have got to a<br>particular end without Reliance on ton<br>that's the way I say it but I just think<br>there are some areas<br>that um and I always recall Justice<br>tipping in relation to limitation which<br>is one of the reasons I was so keen on<br>reform of limitation he said in relation<br>to the limitation Act in a case<br>this legislation is so hopeless that I<br>can't the courts can't do anything more<br>with it it's the legislature has to deal<br>with it and that's why under the<br>chairmanship of Justice Blanchard<br>Jeffrey parber who was president of the<br>law commission put together a group to<br>Act was the judge Willie young was the<br>Des judge in the Fitzgerald case and in<br>the Walker 2 case because he said that<br>the uh the the very carefully drafted<br>privative clause in the tto who Claims<br>Settlement legislation um meant what it<br>said and the majority had a slightly<br>you<br>saidar believe the treaty principles<br>should or or will go forward I just<br>wanted you to comment on view that the<br>real damage there is not potential for<br>legislation it's<br>emboldening people who hold an views and<br>that will<br>oh yeah well it will go ahead as I<br>understand it's going to be introduced<br>toward the end of the year it will go to<br>a Select Committee hearing it will be<br>destroyed uh by submission and then it<br>will die but it's the damage that's done<br>I I don't know whether whether you see<br>it in the the university but I certainly<br>see it out there and I'm not going to<br>give you too much graphic detail but in<br>recent years maybe it's postco I don't<br>know but people feel liberated to<br>express themselves in rather unpleasant<br>terms one<br>Sunday um I was just sort of wandering<br>along Willer Street to towards Mary of<br>the angels and someone walked past me<br>and said um effing lawyer and made some<br>vile remark about<br>M and a few days later I was in uh the<br>Canterbury Club of all play<br>and someone came up to me and clearly<br>inebriated called me a loser and all<br>I've ever done is apologize to Mari and<br>why don't I get lost and so people have<br>always held those views about me some of<br>them totally justifiable but um but you<br>know you've got I I I just see there's<br>this real anger out there and people and<br>of course there are the the uh the<br>keyboard Warriors who Express themselves<br>and so we we've got a a cheap deing of<br>discourse and we want to we we just need<br>to not to allow too much license for<br>that sort of thing to continue of course<br>what we're what we're seeing in the<br>United States is sort of the apotheosis<br>of vulgarity uh people calling you know<br>one guy a fascist and his comments are<br>disgraceful and uh you've got a<br>cheapening of political discourse there<br>which is part and parcel of American<br>politics I mean if you go back to<br>um Grover Cleveland's time I am a nude<br>um uh what was the great campaign ma ma<br>where's my P gone to the White House ha<br>haa because Grover Cleveland had a child<br>outside of woodlock so I mean it's<br>always been cheap over there but by and<br>there have always been some rather<br>unpleasant specimens here uh with<br>maldone and others uh but you know by<br>and large people of we rained in and um<br>but I'm seeing a deterioration in that<br>regard so it's not the bill it's that's<br>see I am worried about the Treaty<br>principles<br>Bill I'm worried about<br>meca<br>um we we've got there are a lot of<br>little things that pin pregant people<br>but there are some bigger issues as well<br>and you see<br>the in me I I have enough confidence to<br>know that the treaty principles bill is<br>nonsense uh and can be defeated by<br>of<br>argument but um that is not and I I I'm<br>not arrogant enough to speak for my<br>tongue of toen with friends but it's not<br>how it's being received and so I think<br>about oh well I'm very I mean the work<br>it's done on the historical area has<br>been superb it's in the and clearly the<br>tribunal continues and will continue<br>forever to have a role shutting down the<br>tribunal is<br>impossible but um I have a particular<br>beef about the way they dealt with the<br>tou fena reform uh and I thought that<br>the work they did was suboptimal and<br>criticized process in a way that was<br>totally unfair<br>and didn't really get to the heart of<br>what the reform was all about and I<br>think there have been other instances<br>where that has happened and so my<br>preference would be to see a smaller<br>group of people appointed to the<br>tribunal the as I said the very wise<br>people uh who it started with and get<br>back to that original notion that Matt R<br>I just think that was consultant and we<br>did have a problem with it um I'm not<br>sure that sheling was the answer that<br>toate the whole<br>process<br>a it what it was wasn't it well I just<br>uh you and I will have different views<br>on it I was appointed associate minister<br>of bar Affairs in 2011 and began a<br>six-year reform process uh and there was<br>and and urur was involved uh and he was<br>targeted um particularly in this area in<br>2017 that uh it was going to be another<br>form of confiscation total utter<br>nonsense the toui fen reform was not<br>about confiscation of Mari land it was<br>about providing a better service to bar<br>and why shouldn't toui fena or or or the<br>fenua have the same standards of<br>registration and dispute resolution that<br>General land systems have that's what it<br>was all about and so that people who own<br>the land could get access to the land<br>and I was particularly uptight about the<br>question of landlock land after the<br>mayor of RTI came and saw me and told me<br>about and and brought a a guy along and<br>he said I wanted to get access to the<br>Faro land which was<br>landlocked and the farmer said yeah walk<br>on oh I need vehicular access get jumped<br>on see you in court<br>and so that issue needed to be looked at<br>uh landlock land is a form of well we we<br>all know what landlock land is is de<br>facto confiscation so there were those<br>sorts of issues that we were trying to<br>Grapple with and the I'm sorry but my<br>thanks so much for um what do you make<br>of this um talk around the campire and<br>forgive me I might quite this I'm about<br>the law<br>if took out<br>aftering that there may attempt to try<br>and doing citizens initiative referendum<br>on the<br>same well I suppose we've had citizens<br>initiated referenda on a variety of<br>things over the years was compulsory<br>Super<br>One battery<br>hens I put it you know the category of<br>battery hens but I mean you're quite<br>right it could<br>happen and um God help us if it does<br>because you'd really unleash some<br>pretty uh you know my little exchange of<br>pleasantries with people wandering up<br>towards St Mary's would be chicken feed<br>uh compared with what we would have in<br>this country and if it would be<br>corrosive unpleasant extreme and do<br>disant well you're absolutely correct<br>and I always laugh when I hear the term<br>Mari privilege because it's an oxy<br>waron and um it comes back to my point<br>about the<br>Roka and the ragit tanes they are<br>providing Services throughout the<br>community natti TOA in poru East is<br>another one doing fabulous work with the<br>uh Pacifica Community as well and it's<br>not a question of oh we'll look after<br>our our lot and the rest can you know<br>put up with things as best they can it<br>is they are there for the community and<br>that's why um you know we can be so<br>proud of what's happening and and<br>rejoice in many of these contemporary<br>developments and just um there other<br>stuff<br>unnecessarily we can hear<br>you your concern<br>significant evidence at the moment that<br>a high proportion of the population feel<br>that they're effectively excluded from<br>having any effective voice and decisions<br>that are taken either at the level of<br>central government or through local<br>government and when one looks at the way<br>political parties for example have<br>evolved over the past few years it seems<br>clear that<br>increasingly the major political parties<br>are run in order to keep other voices<br>out rather than to say we're on open<br>membership our policies are determined<br>by our membership as a whole and from my<br>perspective the the inability to renew<br>our democracy so that people feel that<br>their voices count and that one person<br>one vote really means something is part<br>of the problem that we have to address<br>and I'd welcome your comment on that oh<br>I think it's it's very that what what<br>you say about political part parties is<br>true I joined the National Party fresh<br>out of school in<br>1975 and I was a member of the Kori<br>electorate and it had about 6,000<br>members and I worked in the candala<br>branch which had a thousand members of<br>the and it was a<br>broad-based party and um I don't know<br>what the membership is now but I can<br>tell you it's substantially reduced on<br>that and and so the perception is in<br>some circles and it to the the labor<br>party as well that they're<br>not reaching out to sufficient numbers<br>of people and and you've got a an Ever<br>decreasing number<br>of people who have enormous sway<br>actually when it comes to the the<br>selection of<br>MPS and I mean but it's a pro it's not<br>just a problem here it's a problem the<br>world over I mean look at the state of<br>the conservative party only the<br>conservative party in a really Advanced<br>State of Decay would have selected Liz<br>truss as their leader and um so um uh<br>you know the L us lasted longer than her<br>so we and and look at the state of the<br>Republican and Democratic parties I mean<br>it's a worldwide phenomenon at the end<br>of the day I would say people need um<br>you can sit on the outside complaining<br>looking in or you can get involved</p></main><footer style="margin-top: 2rem;
