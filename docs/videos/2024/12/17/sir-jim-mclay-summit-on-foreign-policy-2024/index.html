100% accurate.</p><p>spee<br>tenot tenot<br>Teno greetings and welcome uh I'm Jim<br>mlay and I'm your Master of Ceremonies<br>for this virtual conference which<br>through dialogue seeks to address issues<br>relating to peace stability and Security<br>in the Pacific<br>region this is the second such event the<br>first was held about 12 months ago and<br>it was founded on a partnership with<br>Kings College London uh which had been<br>initiated by a former British cabinet<br>minister sir Oliver<br>Lewin it that conference provided an<br>opportunity for dialogue a dialogue on<br>peace and Security in the Pacific region<br>it addressed many issues that were of<br>increasing concern within that region uh<br>and was one of a series of virtual<br>conferences held globally on on a<br>quarterly basis a number of countries<br>with interests in the region<br>participated in the previous conference<br>and this is a follow on from that<br>virtual GA<br>gathering again this time we seek to<br>identify possible points of tension in<br>the Pacific region we ask what might<br>trigger a deterioration in the the<br>region and how risks of that<br>deterioration might be reduced and we<br>seek to identify the long-term features<br>of a peaceful<br>region as with last year's virtual<br>conference in due course the proceedings<br>of this virtual conference will be<br>posted online uh we are thereby<br>developing an online resource focused on<br>security within the region the<br>participants are M Sarah Lee acting<br>divisional manager Pacific Regional<br>division Ministry of Foreign Affairs in<br>Wellington his Excellency Makoto asaa<br>ambassador to New Zealand from Japan his<br>Excellency Tom udal ambassador to New<br>Zealand from the United States of<br>America his Excellency Wang zong<br>ambassador to New Zealand from the<br>People's Republic of<br>China<br>um Juliana<br>lafa acting High Commissioner for Samar<br>in New Zealand Professor Robert Patman<br>from the University of atago and<br>Professor Alexander gesi from the<br>University of<br>w each question will be addressed on a<br>consistent<br>basis first one of the two academics<br>will pose a one of four questions I will<br>then invite each country representative<br>to respond and comment in turn the order<br>of speaking will be rotated so that each<br>uh speaks in a different order from the<br>previous uh<br>intervention uh I do ask that<br>participants observe the time limits<br>which have been agreed uh in fairness to<br>all other<br>participants I will then conclude the<br>discussion with some brief and hopefully<br>relevant<br>comments Professor Alexander Gillespie<br>of W University will pose question one<br>to be followed in order by the United<br>States Japan New Zealand China<br>Sumer Professor gesi what are the points<br>of tension in the Pacific K good morning<br>uh first thank you to all the<br>participants the the speakers and the<br>team that's how pull this event together<br>it's a critical point in I believe<br>history at the moment and where we can<br>find peace and cooperation with the<br>Pacific is our foremost goal to answer<br>the question or to Poe the question what<br>are the points of tension in the Pacific<br>many people would say it's about climate<br>change others would suggest it's about<br>security and a further group might<br>suggest it's about development but to me<br>the biggest tensions that we Face are<br>miscommunication<br>mistakes and mishaps and so I believe<br>the goal that we need to be focusing on<br>most critically is that we can<br>understand each other and that we can<br>find points of cooperation around what<br>sustainable development and peaceful<br>competition looks like in this part of<br>the<br>world thank you Professor gesi I'll Now<br>call upon the United States followed by<br>Japan New Zealand samaa and<br>China Ambassador<br>y thank you so much Teno tenot<br>aoto<br>deoa Rio<br>inoa thank you Mr uh sir Jim mlay and<br>all the other participants and it's<br>great to be here with my uh diplomatic<br>colleagues the um Pacific Island region<br>faces daunting and mounting challenges<br>most of all the climate crisis is the<br>Region's top security concern bringing<br>Rising Seas stronger and more frequent<br>storms warmer oceans and severe imminent<br>threats to people in the Pacific and the<br>Pacific Way of<br>Life illegal unreported and unregulated<br>fishing is pervasive throughout the<br>region damaging the marine environment<br>and depriving Pacific Islanders of<br>livelihoods food and economic<br>security health continues to be a<br>challenge in the Pacific as the<br>covid-19 pandemic demonstrated a halted<br>tourism which is struggling to rebound<br>and Vector born diseases and outbreaks<br>continue to threaten the area and many<br>countries struggle with these chronic<br>diseases meanwhile as pit<br>2050 strategy for the Blue Pacific<br>continent States heightened geopolitical<br>competition impacts its member<br>countries increasingly those<br>countries the impacts are things like<br>pressure and coercion which risks<br>undermining the peace prosperity and<br>security of the region and by extension<br>of the United<br>States in facing these challenges<br>the Pacific region remains an enduring<br>foreign policy priority for the United<br>States including with Congressional<br>bipartisan support the United States is<br>a proud Pacific partner we have deep and<br>long-standing ties to the countries in<br>the Pacific who are not only our<br>neighbors but also our friends and with<br>whom we share many core<br>values the United States is committed to<br>engage its specific neighbors to<br>preserve an open secure and prosperous<br>coercion our country share an enduring<br>commitment to Freedom democracy rule of<br>law human rights and Regional peace and<br>stability in the Pacific thank you so<br>much really appreciate being here<br>thank you Ambassador y Now call on<br>Ambassador<br>osawa thank you very much for inviting<br>uh us to this very important events so<br>Professor the Alexander JP uh clearly<br>mentioned three challenges One Security<br>and second one is the uh<br>the uh climate change and the third one<br>is the development aspect we Al we think<br>all the three aspect effect is are very<br>important challenges but uh maybe for uh<br>I would like to First be the uh focus on<br>the first aspect on the second and third<br>aspect maybe I will make a comments for<br>further questions for the coming<br>questions so in the security issues in<br>the Pacific region the security<br>environment is becoming increasingly<br>severe due to challenges due to changes<br>in the global balance of power and other<br>factors<br>in this context values and principles<br>such as Freedom democracy rule of law<br>human rights peaceful resolution of<br>disputes are<br>important we also believe that this is<br>important to maintain and strengthen a<br>free and open International order based<br>on rules in accordance with<br>international law including the UN<br>chapter so that the rights freedoms<br>responsibilities and sovereign of all<br>Nations regardless of size of Power are<br>protected by international law rules and<br>Norms wherever in the world unilateral<br>attempts to change the status quo by<br>force or cohesion cannot be tolerated<br>Japan is committed to maintaining and<br>strengthening and free and open<br>International order based on the rule of<br>law so as to lead the region toward<br>cooperation rather than vision and<br>confrontation in order to avoid tensions<br>countries with important<br>responsibilities for peace and<br>prosperity in the oania region need to<br>continue dialogue and close<br>communication at all levels thank you<br>very<br>much thank you very much Ambassador and<br>Lee and let me add my thanks to those of<br>the esteemed colleagues who have come<br>before me to you for organizing this<br>Summit the points of tension in the<br>Pacific well Pacific countries have<br>identified the points of pressure and<br>the points of tension in their region<br>and as Ambassador Udall mentioned they<br>have set them out and the 2050 strategy<br>for a Blue Pacific continent and also in<br>the boy Declaration on Regional<br>security and as you'll see in those<br>documents the Pacific defines security<br>and a comprehensive holistic way with<br>human security health security and food<br>security as important as more<br>traditional traditional security<br>challenges such as cyber security or<br>political<br>stability this broad definition is<br>really important in the context of a<br>region where still more than 20% of the<br>population of many Pacific island<br>countries live in<br>hardship the Pacific is as others have<br>mentioned of course at the front line of<br>the adverse impacts of climate change<br>which is threatening livelihoods and<br>sovereignty and in some cases<br>communities are facing existential<br>threats as a result of climate change<br>impacts again as others have mentioned<br>the frequency of natural disasters is<br>increasing in placing tremendous social<br>pressure and economic stress in the<br>region eight of the 20 countries in the<br>world with the highest annual average<br>losses<br>as a share of GDP from natural disasters<br>are in the Pacific region our home<br>region we are now of course all acutely<br>aware of the social and economic<br>vulnerability of the region in the face<br>of<br>pandemics the need to address all these<br>critical development needs and limited<br>revenue streams in much of the Pacific<br>is resulting also an a growing debt<br>sustainability challenge the growing<br>debt burden in some countries is<br>limiting options for governments to be<br>able to provide public services and<br>respond to external shocks and to also<br>build the resilience of their<br>economies access to Natural Resources is<br>increasingly in Risk due to illegal<br>unregulated and unrep fishing<br>unsustainable extraction processes and<br>climate change again and this is<br>threatening key revenue<br>streams then we move to transboundary<br>threats such as drug smuggling Wildlife<br>poaching cyber security challenges which<br>are requiring our region to work even<br>more closely together on these shared<br>security challenges the nuclear Legacy<br>and unexploded ordinances is also an<br>ongoing pacif um ongoing issue<br>particularly in the melanesian and North<br>Pacific<br>regions and within this context the<br>Pacific has as again as others have said<br>become increasingly significant as a<br>theater for strategic competition which<br>has implications for regional security<br>and also for New Zealand's<br>interests as our Deputy Prime Minister<br>and Minister of Foreign Affairs the<br>right honorable Winston Peters said in a<br>speech in Port morby in May this year<br>the Pacific family of Nations is not<br>immune from shifts in the Strategic<br>environment and he noted that since<br>returning as foreign minister he has<br>been struck by the extent to which<br>geostrategic Dynamics have sharpened in<br>the region<br>China's recent testing of a nuclear<br>capable intercontinental ballistic<br>missile into the South Pacific nuclear<br>free zone the first in 40 years<br>demonstrates how the Strategic<br>environment in our region is<br>changing while an increase in interest<br>from countries outside the region into<br>the Pacific prevents really important<br>development opportunities and other<br>assistance opportunities it also does<br>increase the risk of De<br>destabilization taking a a short-term<br>opportunistic approach to engagement and<br>shifts the focus potentially away from<br>Pacific<br>priorities having said all that on<br>geostrategic competition I want to<br>reinforce that as articulated by the<br>Pacific Islands Forum the unequivocal<br>message from our region is that climate<br>change Remains the single greatest<br>threat to Pacific lives and<br>livelihoods just taking the opportunity<br>to zoom out a little as well there are<br>concerning Global trends that have the<br>potential to impact seriously in the<br>Pacific changes in the rules-based<br>system internationally could reduce the<br>strength of the Pacific's voice on<br>issues that are vital to Pacific's<br>interest shortening Supply chains could<br>have negative impacts on countries that<br>sit at the end of those Supply chains<br>like in our<br>region and finally Global challenges can<br>and do pull International engagement<br>away from the issue that are Pacific<br>priorities such as again and finally<br>climate change<br>thanks thank you very much U Sarah I now<br>call<br>on acting High<br>Commissioner laf for her<br>contribution thank you very much<br>excellencies ten<br>ten tala and a very warm Pacific welcome<br>we acknowledge College de organizers the<br>University of fat support and<br>Arrangements that has enabled us and<br>facilitated this significant dialogue we<br>are indeed grateful for the opportunity<br>to share our views relating to Regional<br>peace and stability in our region and<br>sore acknowledge with much appreciation<br>the solidarity which is led to our<br>convenient convening of this Summit<br>excellencies our dialogue is timely<br>considering much has happened in the<br>past few months and years the<br>endorsement by leaders of the<br>implementation plan for the pl Pacific<br>2050 strategy and the reform of the<br>regional<br>architecture as our Pro Pacific leaders<br>we continue to advocate for our vision<br>of a resilient Pacific of Peace Harmony<br>security social inclusion and prosperity<br>that ensures all Pacific peoples can<br>lead free healthy and productive lives<br>we have been through some of the most<br>challenging<br>times however we have pressed to push<br>for our values and commitments to ensure<br>a safer PL Pacific region our respective<br>countries which are already vulnerable<br>have been continuously subjected to the<br>multiple Global crisis that are<br>multi-dimensional and complex in their<br>scope and<br>nature Regional security means different<br>things to different people and countries<br>for some security is putting food on the<br>table food security sending children to<br>school and providing productive<br>employment for our people people other<br>aspects of security at least for<br>low-lying Pacific Islands is climate<br>security then there is cyber security<br>and inevitably drug and human<br>trafficking are gradually becoming<br>increasingly prevalent in the Pacific<br>and just a sort of it is frightening and<br>will post another major security risk to<br>our region eventually a priority concern<br>for most of us in the Blue<br>Pacific um an example for sore we do not<br>have a Defense Force we only have a<br>small circle of development Partners all<br>of which are specific comparative<br>advantages and they do not compete but<br>complement each other sore does not have<br>a Defense Force and even if we do it<br>will not it will never have the capacity<br>to protect us from external<br>forces we remain resilient and<br>optimistic about our forward-looking<br>Economic and Development Prospect was<br>cognizant of our shared security and<br>development challenges in the pl Pacific<br>region We Trust in our Collective<br>strengths and unity as foreign members<br>as framed and articulated by the 2050<br>strategy and our respect for the<br>sovereignity of each of our members we<br>continue to see unprecedented levels of<br>bilateral engagement with several<br>countries driven by a range of interests<br>in our region including access to our<br>Pacific Ocean and<br>resources the overlay of geopolitical<br>competition further magnifies the comp<br>and complicates matters particularly so<br>in our PL Pacific region<br>region the increase in Dynamic security<br>challenges in our region is alarming<br>also climate change Remains the single<br>greatest threat to our security<br>well-being and prosperity and a critical<br>priority for our region it is timely<br>that cop 29 is underway and we are<br>hopeful that our joint Alliance of small<br>island States will continue strategic<br>Solutions advocating and also for active<br>engagement on this critical issue we<br>need to ensure sure that cop 29 delivers<br>on some of the crucial ask and ongoing<br>push for Urgent Global Climate action<br>while the work drags its feet on action<br>we continue to have face the<br>consequences we acknowledge and reaffirm<br>our United stance on the issue of<br>climate change and together we push for<br>the needed outcome at cop 29 as stewards<br>of the largest ocean the emerging St<br>globally around misinformation and<br>disinformation leveraged by foreign and<br>domestic actors May Translate into a<br>severe risk for Pacific to Pacific<br>social cohesion and political<br>stability we demand all countries<br>especially the big emit to make rapid<br>deep and sustained reductions in<br>emissions to keep the 1.5 degree goal<br>alive for us in the Pacific we are not<br>on track to meet this 1.5 degree goal<br>much of our development efforts will<br>continue to be<br>reversed and this is a window to secure<br>a liable livable future for us is<br>coasting faster than for everyone else<br>thank you very<br>much thank you very much acting High<br>Commissioner and finally on this<br>wangal thank you thank you s Jim and<br>Professor Gillespie uh for inviting me<br>uh I have a confession to make uh I only<br>had time to look at the questions over<br>the weekend and uh I'm not sure that<br>having reviewed these I'm not sure that<br>these are the best or even the right<br>questions to ask in relation to the<br>Pacific but one to the uninitiated the<br>questions list listed give the wrong<br>impression that we in the Pacific are<br>seeing a significant spike in tensions<br>or on the even on the brink of serious<br>confrontation or conflict which is not<br>true not only does it not reflect the<br>realities in the region but more<br>dangerously it may feed into a rising<br>Narrative of divisiveness Confrontation<br>conflict or even War which once<br>entrenched may be<br>self-fulfilling second the list does not<br>reflect fully the priorities of the<br>Pacific island countries themselves as<br>encapsulated in the 2050 strategy for<br>the blue continent for these countries<br>the greatest threat or challenge is<br>consistently and clearly climate change<br>and the focus of their efforts is<br>addressing climate change reducing<br>poverty and achieving sustainable<br>development and third I'm a little bit<br>disappointed that there is not enough<br>representation of Pacific island<br>countries in our<br>discussion we should have engaged more<br>of them and listen to them on what their<br>views aspirations and priorities are<br>that<br>uh would help to make our conversation<br>more sensible and more useful and for<br>the current participants uh we could as<br>well use the time more productively<br>talking about how we can work together<br>to support the pic's or the Pacific<br>island countries in meeting their<br>priorities including through a<br>successful cop 29 which is currently<br>underway thank<br>you thank you very much uh ambassador<br>for and particularly for the caution<br>that you have expressed I now move to<br>question number two uh and I POS this<br>question initially to Professor Robert<br>Patman what could trigger a<br>deterioration of the situation in the<br>region tenot Couture um greetings to<br>everyone um I'm delighted to have the<br>opportunity to introduce this question<br>and a big thank you to Professor alesp<br>answer Jim clay for facilitating my<br>participation uh this question I'm just<br>reflecting on the comments by the<br>Chinese Ambassador um even if we don't<br>accept there is a a situation of great<br>tension in the Pacific at the moment um<br>there are a number of factors I would<br>when we're trying to identify triggering<br>factors it's quite useful to distinguish<br>between specific triggering factors and<br>what I call a contextual factors um<br>specific triggering factors might be for<br>example one several that have already<br>been mentioned um continuing uh effects<br>of climate change uh another one might<br>be escalating geopolitical rivalries in<br>the region or a contextual Factor might<br>be the erosion of the rule International<br>rule of law which facilitates tensions<br>escalating rather than diminishing so<br>having said that I I'd be very<br>interested uh in the comments of the<br>panel on what might trigger a a<br>deterioration of the situation in the<br>Pacific region thank you thank you very<br>much Professor Patman I now call on um<br>acting High Commissioner lafa to be<br>followed by China the United States<br>Zealand hi commissioner thank you very<br>much<br>geopolitical competition and<br>geostrategic maneuvering will continue<br>to shape the SEC Pacific security<br>landscape in our region it has continued<br>to<br>undergo significant developments in<br>recent years and an important aspect of<br>this change is the increasing attention<br>and engagement from major Global Powers<br>while the increased attention arising<br>from geopolitical competition can be<br>welcome for Pacific Nations it can also<br>have a destabilizing effect on small<br>island States and can be<br>counterproductive to larger Powers<br>attempts at gaining influence in the<br>region there is a significant risk that<br>the prosperity of Pacific nations may<br>become secondary amid this geopolitical<br>tussles in this context it is important<br>that we have a clear coherent<br>streamlined and responsive Regional<br>architecture that supports our<br>Collective political ambition<br>challenges and development needs<br>including an effective partnership<br>engagement mechanism with the 2050<br>strategy in place we are now committed<br>to and accountable for the delivery of<br>our leaders Vision we are weathering<br>unprecedented times that calls for Unity<br>solidarity and strengthened institutions<br>as we continue advocacy for peace<br>security and Harmony in the region we in<br>the pl Pacific at International and<br>Regional dialogues are convinced that<br>united we are stronger together not only<br>to address our common challenges but to<br>realize our economic potential and make<br>an impact on the international agenda we<br>also embraced effective inclusive and<br>durable Partnerships with shared values<br>and goals that contribute to better the<br>lives of our people thank<br>you thank you very much um acting High<br>Commissioner and now call on Ambassador<br>Jong for his comments thank you uh in<br>relation to this particular topic uh if<br>there is any one uh issue that for us<br>deserves our attention it is the zero<br>some cold war mentality that frames the<br>region in terms of great power<br>competition or even<br>rivalry as a result we're witnessing<br>NATO attempting to expand extend his<br>tentacles to this part of the world<br>we're also seeing the rise of exclusive<br>block or even Quai military alliances in<br>the region such as quad oras openly<br>targeted at other countries in many ways<br>the region is already heavily<br>militarized with a widening network of<br>military bases and increasing troop<br>presence from outside the<br>region as far as China is concerned<br>apart from military attaches as part of<br>our diplomatic missions China does not<br>keep a single military base nor do we<br>deploy a single soldier in the region so<br>if you want to scope for tension points<br>or triggers for increased tension in the<br>Pacific you know where to<br>look none of the above uh the widening<br>uh military<br>networks uh the rise of uh exclusive<br>blocks and so on and so forth is<br>anything the Pacific island countries<br>themselves want to<br>see uh because as ambassador to New<br>Zealand I'm also uh doubling as<br>ambassador to the Cook Islands and Nei<br>I've had some recent conversations with<br>the prime ministers of both Island<br>countries and they've reaffirmed to me<br>very clearly uh as as we've heard uh<br>from other Pacific island leaders uh<br>these countries do not want the South<br>Pacific to become a theater for great<br>power competition or even confrontation<br>and conflicts they don't want to take<br>sides and they don't want other<br>countries agenda or will to be imposed<br>on them they don't want other people's<br>words to be put in into their mouth and<br>they want their priorities to be<br>respected and their Partners to put<br>money where their mouth is if all our<br>governments could truly understand and<br>respect that I think uh that would do a<br>great service to peace and prosperity in<br>the region thank<br>you thank you very much<br>Ambassador uh I now call on Ambassador<br>yudal the um Pacific Islands are<br>increasingly becoming an arena for<br>geopolitical activity making some<br>countries vulnerable to debt diplomacy<br>political interference and security ties<br>inconsistent with the existing<br>Regional architecture this competition<br>could lead to increased militarization<br>and security tensions in the region a<br>weakening of Pacific island the Pacific<br>Islands forum and other Regional<br>organizations the erosion of trust<br>between Pacific island countries and<br>external partners and heightened risk of<br>conflict over resources or Maritime<br>sovereignty<br>disputes insufficient action on climate<br>change the climate crisis is an<br>existential threat to many Pacific<br>onland Nations failure to take<br>meaningful action to mitigate climate<br>change and support adaptation measures<br>could result in increased displacement<br>and migration due to sea level rise and<br>other climate impacts exacerbation of<br>existing social and economic<br>vulnerabilities leading to instability<br>loss of territory and sovereignty for<br>some Pacific island nations increase<br>competition for scarce resources such as<br>freshwater and aable land unsustainable<br>exploitation of resources the Pacific<br>Region's Rich natural resources are<br>attracting growing interests from<br>external actors raising concerns about<br>unsustainable exploitation if not<br>managed carefully this could lead to<br>depletion of fish stocks and damage to<br>marine ecosystems threat Ing livelihoods<br>and food security environmental<br>degradation and pollution from Mining<br>and other extractive Industries<br>displacement of local communities and<br>loss of traditional<br>livelihoods social and political<br>instability arising from resource<br>conflicts weakening of regional<br>institutions the Pacific island Forum<br>plays a crucial role in promoting<br>Regional Co operation and addressing<br>shared challenging challenges a<br>weakening of the PF or other Regional<br>institutions could result in reduced<br>capability to coordinate Regional<br>responses to climate change security<br>threats illicit Finance drug trafficking<br>exposure and other challenges a less<br>unified voice for the Pacific in global<br>forums and diminished effective iess in<br>attracting development assistance and<br>investment and then finally internal<br>instability and governance challenges<br>some Pacific island countries face<br>internal challenges such as political<br>instability corruption and weak<br>governance a deterioration of these<br>conditions could undermine Economic<br>Development and social progress erode<br>public trust and create conditions for<br>unrest reduce capability to to address<br>transnational crime and other security<br>threats cause backsliding on Democratic<br>norms and practices that form the<br>Bedrock of Pacific island country's<br>Independence thank<br>you thank you very much Ambassador<br>Ambassador<br>osala as previous speaker clearly<br>mentioned so the irland countries do do<br>not want to be involved in the<br>international tensions at the same time<br>we are wor of attempts of in the world<br>to unilaterally change the status quo<br>through force of cision expansion of<br>milary power in a manner that lacks<br>transparency and increased military<br>activity so in addition moves that<br>Foster division in the International<br>Community could trigger a worsening of<br>the situation<br>the development and testing of nuclear<br>weapons is a serious threat Japan will<br>lead realistic and practical efforts to<br>realize a world without nuclear weapons<br>Japan has hosted the Pacific Islands<br>leaders meeting or Pal uh since<br>1997 and at the pal 10 in June uh in<br>July sorry of this year Japan leaders<br>Pacific of leaders of Pacific island<br>countries agreed to work together to<br>maintain and strengthen a free and open<br>International order based on the rule of<br>law on the basis of shared values and<br>principles in the P 10 leaders<br>declaration Japan and the leaders of<br>pacifican countries expressed strong<br>opposition to any attempts to<br>unilaterally change the status quo<br>through the thre or use of the force or<br>intimidation the issue of climate change<br>is also very important as a potential<br>impediment to Regional stability it is<br>an urgent issue for Japan and Pacific<br>Islands which share the recognition of<br>the single greatest EX existential<br>threat to the peoples of the Pacific<br>region uh we mentioned also the uh in<br>the P pal 10 declaration that maybe uh<br>we will mention at the pre following<br>questions thank you thank you very much<br>ambassador finally on this question<br>Sarah<br>Lee thank you as we have all I think<br>mentioned the Pacific faces a multitude<br>of security threats uh and and all of<br>the definitions that we have talked<br>through and that is in a context where<br>capacity is constrained and when there<br>are lots of competing challenges to<br>resolve consecutive New Zealand<br>governments have therefore prioritized<br>our engagement as a region and with<br>Pacific partners bilaterally<br>to work alongside them to come up with<br>Solutions together to the shared<br>challenges that we face so coming at the<br>end I guess of this cluster of responses<br>to this particular question I wanted to<br>focus simply on one issue which is<br>regional<br>cooperation an ongoing risk to Pacific<br>cooperation is fractured Regional Unity<br>due due to a a range of different things<br>some of those can be domestic or sub<br>Regional um distractions or<br>disturbances the Pacific Islands forum<br>is so important it allows us to come<br>together in our own unique Pacific way<br>to have a true dialogue a a taleno and<br>it allows us to be able to in an era of<br>increasingly complex Global challenges<br>to come together and caucus in a way<br>that has never been as<br>important if we want to face the global<br>challenges that Professor Patman<br>outlined it and his introduction to this<br>question we need to make sure that our<br>regional voice is heard loud and clear<br>as as a region our voice is more<br>effective and more heard more loudly and<br>clearly when we speak as a<br>region further escalation of strategic<br>competition in the Pacific could also<br>destabilize the current institutions and<br>the arrangements that underpin our<br>regional SEC our region security so we<br>need to work really hard to maintain the<br>value and the impact that working<br>together as the Pacific Islands Forum<br>brings us all thank<br>you thank you very much uh I now move to<br>question number three uh and I pose to<br>Professor gespi the question what<br>immediate steps can be taken to reduce<br>risk and then I will invite comments in<br>ordance of the rotation uh from the<br>various participants Professor gesi<br>thank you sir<br>the question of what immediate steps can<br>be taken to reduce risk is obviously<br>dependent on whether you focus on<br>security or development or climate but<br>to my mind we need two principles that<br>go above all of these concerns the first<br>one is a clear commitment by all<br>participants in the region that they<br>are driven to reduce tension and<br>minimize risk the second one is an<br>agreement that we adopt goals that<br>reflect the needs Direction and voice of<br>the Pacific island countries and that<br>they are at the Forefront of these<br>deliberations going<br>forward thank you very much Professor<br>goes and I now invite<br>um Ambassador<br>Jan thank you sir Jim uh let me if uh<br>with your<br>Indulgence uh speak to China's approach<br>in the South Pacific in relation to<br>questions uh both three and four<br>together as both of them relate to the<br>possible actions we can take either uh<br>individually or<br>collectively we have a long-standing<br>relationship with Pacific island<br>countries together we have agreed to<br>establish a comprehensive strategic<br>Partnership of mutual respect and common<br>Prosperity the basis of the partnership<br>is mutual<br>respect respect for the Pacific iseland<br>Count's sovereignty and Independence<br>respect for their will respect for their<br>culture and traditions and respect for<br>their commitment to Unity for Collective<br>Strength the aim of this partnership is<br>as fellow developing countries to<br>achieve common<br>Prosperity that's why we have focused<br>over the years on development<br>cooperation with a view to helping uh<br>Pacific island Partners to uh deal with<br>uh the challenges from uh climate change<br>uh poverty and uh the longer needs of<br>sustainable<br>development again the aim is to help uh<br>these countries to achieve common<br>Prosperity rather than to Pedal<br>influence or compete against anyone<br>unlike some others historically we don't<br>have Colonial Ambitions or traditions<br>and we have an actual track record to<br>prove that going forward<br>we have no interest in so-called<br>strategic competition with any country<br>in any region of the world including the<br>South<br>Pacific the support and assistance we<br>extend other countries including uh the<br>Pacific island countries responds to the<br>needs and requests of the receiving<br>countries themselves rather than serving<br>our own<br>agenda one area we focus our efforts on<br>is climate change again the number one<br>priority for uh the Pacific island<br>countries domestically we lead the world<br>in progressing towards fulfilling our<br>commitment on greenhouse gas reductions<br>hitting some major targets ahead of<br>schedule a few examples China is already<br>the biggest producer of new and<br>renewable energy which already accounts<br>for over 40% of its instored capacity<br>for power generation China is the<br>biggest producer and biggest market for<br>EVS accounting for over 50% globally on<br>both<br>accounts the market penetration of EVS<br>on the Chinese automobiles Market stands<br>already at over<br>35% China finally China plants the<br>biggest number of trees globally<br>accounting for over a quarter of<br>increased Forest cover in the entire<br>world over the past 20 years and<br>internationally we've been supporting<br>our fellow developing countries<br>including Pacific island countries<br>through South South coroporation<br>including belt and Road initiative<br>Corporation we do that by building up<br>the infrastructure to improve<br>connectivity power growth and enhance<br>resilience against climate change and<br>other natural<br>disasters by opening up our markets a<br>more recent move is to provide all Le<br>developed countries with quota-free and<br>tariff free access to Chinese markets<br>for their export<br>and we do that by providing climate<br>change specific assistance through<br>financing training and helping Pacific<br>island countries with Accelerated Green<br>energy<br>uptake in doing so we don't attach<br>political strings impose our will on<br>others will make empty promises when we<br>make a commitment we do deliver and<br>we're glad that our contributions are<br>helping to make a difference in people's<br>lives in Pacific Island countries and we<br>won't apologize for enabling these<br>countries to get more attention and thus<br>leverage more resources from other<br>partners as an unplanned and almost<br>accidental part of the impact of our<br>cooperation with these<br>countries our only hope is that all the<br>other partners of the Pacific island<br>countries could do the same by providing<br>support and assistance to the Pacific<br>island countries through concrete<br>priorities our cooperation with Pacific<br>island countries is Advanced both<br>bilaterally and through multilateral and<br>pureral mechanisms including the China<br>pic Center for climate change<br>cooperation we also stand ready to<br>explore with other partners<br>opportunities for tripartite or<br>multi-party coroporation and in this<br>connection we welcome The Proposal<br>uh from the deputy um Secretary of State<br>uh Kurt Campbell uh at the recent uh<br>Pacific island Forum meeting and we're<br>ready to explore such opportunities with<br>the United States and any other partner<br>to help together uh the Pacific island<br>countries to meet uh the challenges they<br>face but let me also before I conclude<br>uh made a brief comment on the regional<br>archit<br>ecture the existence of multiple<br>sometimes overlapping mechanisms in the<br>region is a reality that has evolved<br>over many years each has its own reson<br>thre and each has its own strengths and<br>weaknesses they should be and often are<br>complimentary while coordination and<br>consolidation is necessary and useful<br>they're not mutually exclusive and they<br>shouldn't be used as instruments to<br>exclude or Target other countries or<br>mechanisms if that is the case it would<br>be counterproductive and very<br>wasteful while China advances our<br>cooperation with pic's again through the<br>China pic mechanism we also acknowledge<br>the important role of the Pacific island<br>Forum in the regional architecture we've<br>been for many years a dialogue partner<br>and supported the operation of its<br>secretary<br>both politically and financially going<br>forward we'll continue to do so thank<br>you thank you very much Ambassador I now<br>Lee thank you so um I agree with the<br>previous comment that actually the<br>challenges here are both immediate and<br>intergen or the response to the<br>challenges are both immediate and<br>intergenerational so that the the<br>comments that I make in relation to this<br>question three and the question that<br>comes up as number four need to be taken<br>together uh in response to the<br>challenges in the region New Zealand has<br>been lifting its engagement by deepening<br>its Partnerships with Pacific island<br>countries and coordinating efforts with<br>other<br>donors as non-forum countries look to<br>strengthen their cooperation with us we<br>need to make sure that that cooperation<br>is done in a manner that is specific Le<br>and serves the needs and the interests<br>of for members first and<br>foremost supporting Pacific lead<br>responses to Regional issues is also a<br>key way in which we can embed the key<br>principle of the batawa Declaration that<br>the region has the collective capacity<br>and commitment to make its own uh to<br>meet its own security<br>challenges as our Minister the right<br>honorable Winston Peters has said<br>himself an immediate increased effort to<br>coordinate support for the region is<br>needed this has started but like-minded<br>countries in the Pacific must improve<br>their coordination and also raise their<br>ambition this means helping the region<br>address the social and environmental<br>priorities set out in the 2050 strategy<br>which I've been so pleased to hear all<br>of us talk about<br>today Partners must also ensure that<br>they're working with the Pacific values<br>and interests as their drivers and there<br>may well be times when we need to advise<br>Partners to change behaviors that demote<br>Pacific priorities interests and values<br>or our commitment to democratic Norms in<br>the region<br>thanks thank you very much U acting High<br>Commissioner<br>lafa thank you very much um for S more<br>we believe a United stance in a global<br>Arena through implementation of relevant<br>decisions is key an example for us in<br>the pl Pacific region is the support by<br>our partners of some of the Pacific<br>violence for list declaration such as<br>the Declaration for preserving Maritime<br>zones in the face of climate change<br>related sea level rise this is a<br>priority for the Pacific and with<br>members who are costal States we must<br>catalyze the initiative to work<br>collectively to build wider<br>international support including through<br>adoption of similar practices to create<br>a global Norm for preserving Maritime<br>zones the patawa Declaration the board<br>declaration the raratonga treaty the<br>ocean of<br>Peace um 2023 which will be further<br>discussed by leaders in the next fif<br>meeting and most importantly in AIA is a<br>declaration agreed at the Commonwealth<br>heads of government<br>meeting that it paves the way forward<br>for robust ambitious Innovative and<br>transformative action for a commonwealth<br>of shared ocean Prosperity resilience<br>and<br>sustainability this Builds on National<br>and Collective efforts to protect the<br>ocean and use it sustainably<br>the significance of the apia Declaration<br>to which 56 members of the Commonwealth<br>were called on to support and to which<br>LPM alluded to and I quote the AIA<br>Commonwealth ocean declaration for one<br>resilient common future must be in lined<br>in the sand from which the world<br>collectively transforms ocean<br>exploitation into protection and<br>sustainable stewardship and we look<br>action um another key aspect as<br>mentioned earlier is the need to deepen<br>and strengthen<br>partnership securing strategic<br>Partnerships is vital for a resilient<br>region we hold great potential in<br>champing our own development pathways<br>through strengthening assisting<br>Partnerships and pursuing new ones we<br>must look at um inam members<br>partners and cooperations and move<br>Beyond donor recipient relations and<br>with our partners we focus the focus<br>should be for genuine and durable<br>Partnerships that are sustainable and<br>where we sit as equals excellencies the<br>ocean is Central to our identity and our<br>livelihoods and our future as large are<br>L as large ocean States the ocean also<br>unites us it sustains Us in the world a<br>resilient ocean means one resilient<br>planet and a resilient region we must<br>protect preserve and sustainably use the<br>ocean and the resources there in Mar<br>marine pollution including Plastics must<br>be curved and eliminated we also seek<br>greater Economic Development especially<br>in the wake of covid-19 pandemic which<br>devastated tourism dependent economies<br>for all the Pacific we need better<br>protection for our oceans and Fisheries<br>resources including bolstering local<br>capacity to compact illegal unreported<br>and unregulated fishing optimizing our<br>strength in our engagement with our<br>partners and relevant International<br>organizations and in multi financial<br>institutions can post efforts in<br>supporting our development<br>aspirations our access to conal finance<br>is a necessity if we are to achieve our<br>rebuilding efforts the choice between<br>rebuilding our economies and servicing<br>our debts is an immediate and Urgent<br>dilemma no country can pursue the<br>sustainable development goals and be<br>expected to also pay for their debts the<br>multi-dimensional vulnerability index<br>provides a window to access contal<br>Finance<br>and must be<br>supported excellencies we are convinced<br>that we are stronger together we must<br>seize this opportunity to Define and<br>build a resilient and sustainable future<br>for our peoples and<br>places the Pacific can make can make a<br>huge difference but the pro Pacific with<br>the help of our partners can be<br>transformational thank<br>you thank you very much the high<br>commissioner's plea for the ocean<br>reminds me that we and the pafic don't<br>just call it an ocean we also call it<br>home I call on Ambassador<br>yugal than thank you so much and and uh<br>to address the immediate steps that can<br>be taken to reduce the risk um to<br>address the risk in the region the<br>United States has implemented several<br>initiatives in close coordination with<br>Pacific island countries and our<br>partners in the region including number<br>one Pacific partnership strategy the<br>United States prioritized engagement in<br>the Pacific region through its first<br>ever Pacific partnership strategy<br>launched in September<br>2022 this strategy outlined four key<br>ongoing objectives strengthening the US<br>Pacific Islands partnership fostering a<br>United Pacific Islands region connected<br>with the world promoting a resilient<br>Pacific Islands region prepared for the<br>climate crisis and other 21st century<br>challenges and empowering Pacific<br>Islanders and their economic Prosperity<br>number two partners in the Blue Pacific<br>the United States also joined with<br>Australia Canada Japan New Zealand and<br>the United Kingdom to launch the<br>partners in the Blue Pacific initiative<br>a strategic coordination mechanism aimed<br>at supporting a prosperous secure<br>resilient free and open Pacific region<br>can Canada Germany and the Republic of<br>Korea have since joined this initiative<br>and then number three enhance diplomatic<br>representation the United States<br>expanded its diplomatic president<br>presence in the Pacific increasing its<br>representation in<br>Samoa the Cook Islands and Nui and<br>opening new embassies in Soloman Islands<br>Tonga and Vanuatu this increased<br>diplomatic engagement aims to strengthen<br>ties with Pacific island countries and<br>better address Regional<br>challenges the United States will<br>maintain its Global Leadership in<br>combating the climate crisis while<br>partnering with the Pacific Islands in<br>adapting to and managing the impacts of<br>climate change on lives health and<br>livelihoods at the 53rd Pacific island<br>Forum leaders meeting in August 2024 the<br>United States announced a contribution<br>of an additional 20 million US dollar in<br>funding for the Pacific resilience<br>facility thank<br>you thank you very much uh Ambassador<br>and finally on this question Ambassador<br>osawa thank you very much so to reduce<br>the risks it is essential that each<br>country with responsibility for the<br>region oppose attempts to which inally<br>change the status quo uh through force<br>of cision and work together to maintain<br>and strengthen a free and open<br>International order based on the rule of<br>law for these purposes it is essential<br>to continue dialogue and close<br>communication and as the previous<br>speakers stressed commonly stressed<br>cooperation in the Pacific<br>region as expressed in pal 10 Japan for<br>its part will strongly supports<br>the regional uh unity and cooperate<br>cooperate in realizing the vision for<br>the future as outlined in the pf's 2050<br>strategy we will also work together to<br>address the issue of climate change<br>which is the single greatest threat to<br>the survival of Pacific island countries<br>at pal 10 Japan announced a new<br>initiative the Pacific climate<br>resilience initiative<br>and all up all Japan effort that<br>mobilizes all of Japan's technology<br>knowhow and Financial<br>Resources Japan will provide assistance<br>to Ireland countries with a focus on uh<br>three points one is strengthening<br>disaster prevention capacity two<br>promoting<br>decarbonization and three supporting<br>Ireland countries of efforts Japan will<br>continue to<br>uh to make any efforts to help Pacific<br>island countries thank you very<br>much thank you very much Ambassador I I<br>now turn to question number four uh<br>which I will pose to Professor Robert<br>Patman and then then to the participants<br>what does a long-term peaceful and<br>sustainable cooperation for the Pacific<br>look like Professor Batman thank you sir<br>Jim um this is a demanding question um<br>during the Cold War period um the search<br>for stability and order was often<br>prioritized over the pursuit of justice<br>but we now live in the postc Cold War<br>era at least three decades into it plus<br>and increasingly an in we live in an<br>interconnected world and it seems to me<br>that we had to achieve sustainable peace<br>in the Pacific region we have to<br>reconcile U what is seen as injustices<br>on the ground in the Pacific with wider<br>imperatives for Global Order um and to<br>do that I think the voice and this point<br>has been made repeatedly by other<br>speakers so I'm not saying anything<br>original here I I think the voice of the<br>Pacific island nations must be heard and<br>respected and must be T articulated with<br>agency I I now look forward to the<br>comments of our esteem<br>colleagues thank you very much uh now to<br>so in in the midst of the increasingly<br>complex environment surrounding the<br>region Japan strongly supports the 2050<br>strategy of the PF which embodies the<br>unity of the region and hopes to take<br>its relationship with the Pacific irland<br>countries to a higher level and move<br>forward together toward the future so<br>maybe the supporting the uh the effort<br>of the PF country is very important<br>essential one Japan will also strengthen<br>the P process through genuine<br>partnership greater cooperation and a<br>spirit of transparency and<br>accountability so pafic irland countries<br>face such challenges are small and<br>dispersed far from International markets<br>and vulnerable to environmental changes<br>such as natural disasters and climate<br>change taking into account the unique<br>challenges of Pacific island<br>countries Japan will Implement<br>development coroporation and more than 6<br>uh<br>6,00<br>500 personal exchanges and human<br>resource development in the three years<br>until the next Palm 11 in line with the<br>joint action plan adopted at Palm 10<br>Japan supports Regional efforts to<br>ensure a coordinated response to<br>security change challenges in the region<br>and intends to contribute to Regional<br>peace and stability by strengthening<br>close Cooperative relations with the<br>Pacific island countries thank you very<br>much thank you Ambassador uh now uh I<br>lafa thank you very much excellencies<br>for the pl Pacific our high level<br>response lies in implementation of the<br>2050 Blue Pacific strategy endorsed by<br>the Pacific Islands fum leaders in<br>July endorsed by the Pacific island<br>Forum leaders its long-term Vision<br>Values and thematic priorities to ensure<br>sustainability and a resilient Pacific<br>region of Peace Harmony security social<br>inclusion and prosperity resonate with<br>the strategies we continue to advocate<br>for for S more our national strategies<br>Focus is on empowering communities<br>building resilience and inspiring growth<br>employment rate is increasing as well as<br>the number of tourists entering the<br>country since preco and reopening of our<br>borders on foreign policy s has<br>continued to strengthen its bilateral<br>ties and remains an active player in<br>different Regional and international<br>foras to pursue our national goals and<br>priorities as well as help respond to<br>the growing Global challenges and<br>meeting our International<br>obligations from s's experience we<br>successfully hosted chogm in 2023 we<br>took on the role as a new chair of AOS<br>from 2023 to<br>2024 and we also hosted the S agreement<br>signing of our new partnership framework<br>these commitments not only maintain<br>Samos leadership role in championing<br>Pacific and seeds priorities but also to<br>play a more active role in shaping the<br>agenda and Approach at the multi<br>multilateral Arena through un and also<br>other International<br>organizations Regional stability has<br>never been more critical to maintain<br>peace and security prosperity and<br>well-being of all Pacific peoples<br>perhaps we ought to remind ourselves<br>again of the potential available to us<br>under the pl Pacific<br>identity and our commitment to democracy<br>human rights and the rule of law we have<br>a powerful voice that we can take beyond<br>our immediate region and to engage<br>proactively in every opportunity that<br>comes our way the 2050 strategy provides<br>for the basis of strategic Partnerships<br>and meaningful engagement to cater for<br>shared resources we are indeed committed<br>to deeper regionalism and to<br>multilateralism and we urge us all and<br>our partners to recommit to our regional<br>institutions so more further stress the<br>importance of the rules based based<br>International order founded on the UN<br>Charter and adherence to relevant<br>international law and respect for legal<br>and<br>diplomatic<br>processes as a small Pacific Island<br>state we recognize that the well-being<br>of our PL Pacific is underpinned by an<br>expanded concept of security inclusing<br>of human security environment and<br>resources security addressing<br>transnational crimes including cyber<br>security and the need to build<br>resilience to national disasters<br>um we further stress the importance of<br>the rules based International order<br>founded on the UN Charter and adherence<br>to these international law and the<br>peaceful resolution of international<br>disputes and at the same time we respect<br>and assert The Sovereign rights of every<br>member country to conduct its National<br>Affairs free of external influence and<br>coercion we thank you thank you very<br>much indeed uh High Commissioner uh<br>Ambassador<br>UD thank you the uh United States<br>envisions a resilient secure and<br>prosperous Pacific region where all<br>Pacific peoples can Thrive we are<br>committed to supporting a Pacific Le<br>vision for the region that prioritizes<br>partnership and respect as outlined in<br>our Pacific partnership strategy we have<br>four long-term goals<br>for the Pacific Le Vision number one a<br>strong us Pacific Islands partnership<br>this includes fulfilling existing<br>commitments such as the compacts of free<br>association and expanding diplomatic<br>engagement by open opening new embassies<br>and increasing Staffing in the region<br>number two a unified Pacific Islands<br>region connected with the world this<br>involves strengthening Regional<br>institutions like the Pacific Islands<br>forum and coordinating closely with<br>allies and partners like Australia Japan<br>New Zealand and members of the partners<br>in the Blue Pacific initiative number<br>three a resilient Pacific Islands region<br>prepared for the climate crisis and<br>other 21st century challenges<br>recognizing climate change as the most<br>sign ific threat to the region the US<br>aims to help Pacific island countries<br>build resilience and adapt to climate<br>impacts promote sustainable development<br>and advocate for stronger Global action<br>on climate change and then number four<br>and finally empowered and prosperous<br>pacif Pacific<br>Islanders we are committed to increasing<br>trade and investment in the Pacific<br>Islands EX expanding peop to people ties<br>including through the Peace Corp and the<br>United States seeks to align with the<br>Pacific Islands forum and the 2050<br>strategy for the Blue Pacific continent<br>for work emphasizing Regional<br>solidarity<br>self-determination and sustainable<br>development Guided by Pacific values and<br>priorities the history prosperity and<br>the future of the Pacific Islands and<br>the United States are inextricably<br>linked thank you thank you Ambassador<br>zong thank you uh as I indicated uh I've<br>largely exhausted uh what I have to say<br>uh on this part of the discussion when I<br>commented under question three but I<br>have only one point to emphasize uh that<br>is uh the same point I made at the<br>outside of our discussions and hopefully<br>uh if there's another uh un call call uh<br>or a c call to this exercise next year<br>hopefully we could uh we could invite<br>more representation from the Pacific<br>island countries because at the end of<br>the day it's about them is about their<br>needs their aspirations and their<br>approach and I'll leave that uh uh with<br>the organizers to ponder maybe after the<br>meeting but otherwise I would like to<br>thank the organizers for putting this<br>together very useful discussions thank<br>Le thank you so as we've all uh spoken<br>of this morning Pacific leaders have<br>clearly articulated their vision for the<br>region and it's incumbent on officials<br>like me uh to identify way to bring to<br>life that Vision through enhanced<br>Regional cooperation deepened bilateral<br>Partnerships and a genuinely all of<br>government focus on working alongside<br>Pacific Partners on Pacific<br>priorities we in New Zealand see<br>ourselves as having an absolutely<br>non-discretionary interest in working<br>with Pacific Partners to bolster their<br>resilience identify Solutions together<br>and work to address the variety of<br>security challenges that we've been<br>discussing this<br>morning but in response to the question<br>about what long-term peaceful<br>cooperation looks like I wanted to focus<br>a little on not what we will do but how<br>we will do it New Zealand's approach to<br>long-term peaceful and sustainable<br>cooperation is as follows it's<br>cooperation that respects the priorities<br>of Pacific Partners it's co-investment<br>that supports Pacific countries to<br>exercise their independent and their<br>agencies in their own<br>territories it is capacity building<br>efforts that are co-designed with<br>Pacific partners and contribute to their<br>resilience over the long<br>term and it is engagement with partners<br>and by partners that is consistent with<br>our interests and values undertaking<br>transparently and with a focus and<br>supporting on of good<br>governance with those words I wanted to<br>take the opportunity as the last speaker<br>to thank sir Jim professors professors<br>Gillespie and Patman and your colleagues<br>behind the scenes for bringing us here<br>today to participate in this important<br>dialogue I'd also like to thank their<br>excellencies the ambassadors as they<br>appear on my screen from China the<br>United States and Japan and acting High<br>Commissioner from s for being with us<br>and sharing your insights and I want to<br>thank you very<br>much uh we've come to a point in our<br>discussions where I was originally to<br>have summed up some of the major points<br>and encapsulated some of the major<br>points or that had Arisen in over the<br>past hour or so uh however it seems to<br>me that we have first of all we have a<br>small amount of time available to us uh<br>which we should use constructively but<br>secondly it's important to uh<br>acknowledge that we have thus far<br>focused on an agenda which inevitably<br>the organizers had to to assemble and<br>invite on which we invited comment but<br>it's equally important that we hear from<br>the individual countries on any issue<br>relating to the Pacific that they<br>consider to be important so subject to a<br>few comments I will make in a moment I'm<br>going to ask each of the participants<br>whether there is anything further they<br>will want to say and I will take a few<br>minutes to talk about the issues that<br>have been highlighted from my<br>perspective uh and thus um give you some<br>opportunity if you want to consider what<br>additional comments you might like to<br>make what the the advantage of this sort<br>of gathering electronic or virtual<br>Gathering is that it identifies shared<br>concerns and shared challenges and that<br>has certainly been the case with with<br>this discussion you have listed a whole<br>range of issues of which climate change<br>is easily the most um mentioned and the<br>most important and it's perhaps<br>significant that we are having this<br>discussion as the cop 29 meets in Baku<br>aaban to discuss further progress on<br>addressing climate change um other<br>issues of of considerable importance<br>include IR fishing uh Health uh the the<br>singular importance of Freedom democracy<br>rule of law and a rules-based society<br>and the need for coordinated development<br>focused on identifiable outcomes those<br>are the issues that certainly were<br>highlighted from my point of view but<br>above all you were speaking of the need<br>for a regional for regional cooperation<br>for us to speak as a region and for<br>there to be a an identified voice of the<br>Pacific island countries<br>use Su and example so with those<br>comments I now I'm going to work my way<br>down the original list and ask whether<br>any of the participants wish to make<br>some additional comments on any issue<br>not dictated by the questions not<br>dictated by uh what others have said but<br>simply express our view which will I<br>have I'm a corner point for our um<br>future discussions of this nature so I<br>start if I can with Ambassador yugal do<br>ah um sir Jim M clay thank you so much<br>for leading this effort uh and uh I just<br>want to thank all of our esteemed<br>colleagues that have been on this uh<br>discussion for your contributions and<br>everything that you have uh done to try<br>to move the these issues forward and and<br>let me say your four questions were I<br>believe very very insightful and focused<br>us on the important issues in the region<br>now let let's uh be frank with everybody<br>and be candid uh there are big big<br>challenges in terms of what's going on<br>in the Pacific and as we've heard uh<br>climate change is an existential threat<br>and and uh we all need to focus on that<br>uh geopolitical competition another big<br>challenge illegal fishing transnational<br>crime human trafficking economic<br>Prosperity big big challenges and I<br>think the solutions are um and our goals<br>are for a resilient secure and<br>prosperous region working together as a<br>region through existing groups like The<br>Pacific island forum and I'd really<br>underline that there there's a strong<br>architecture here everything I've been<br>doing in the three plus years I've been<br>here is try to strengthen the Pacific<br>island Forum the United States will play<br>our part through our Pacific partner<br>strategy we look forward to working with<br>Pacific Partners to achieve their vision<br>for the region through the 2050 strategy<br>once again thank you so much thanking<br>thank you for focusing our attention and<br>we really look forward to working uh<br>with everyone around the<br>table thank you very much Ambassador and<br>for your contributions both the most<br>recent and equally important those which<br>were responded to the various questions<br>Ambassador<br>oawa thank you very much so maybe I have<br>nothing to add so maybe uh I Japan would<br>like to continue to be uh good friends<br>for the Pacific island countries and uh<br>we will uh continue to have the Palm 10<br>meeting uh with the Pacific island<br>countries and uh the cooperation with<br>other important Partners is also uh very<br>important I would like to continue to do<br>that and lastly thank thank you very<br>much for sir Jim MRE and uh other<br>professors and to have to invite us to<br>such an important meeting thank you very<br>much thank you indeed Ambassador for<br>your contribution and for Japan's<br>contribution to the to the<br>Lee thank you again and I think um I<br>think I've said most of what I wanted to<br>your Co your questions allowed us to<br>talk through the full range of<br>challenges that we see in the Pacific<br>region and how we are working together<br>to address them I did want just briefly<br>to too the the comments of the acting<br>High Commissioner from sore in relation<br>to the importance of oceans issues and<br>to congratulate her government for a<br>really successful hosting of the<br>Commonwealth heads of government meeting<br>in late October where those issues were<br>really importantly uh which provided a<br>really important Spotlight for those<br>issues so given I hadn't focused in my<br>answers on those environmental and<br>oceans issues specifically I thought I'd<br>take this opportunity to too k thank you<br>thank you very much I think we can all<br>Echo your comments about Chum and its<br>successful hosting by the government of<br>sama a singular achievement of which the<br>Pacific can be very proud<br>um hi<br>commissioner<br>lafa thank you very much for the<br>opportunity um<br>excellencies and also to facilitators we<br>are very grateful for the opportunity<br>given to us and we also acknowledge the<br>kind assistance of all our partners um<br>for the assistance provided to S which<br>enable us to successfully host um troab<br>we are also grateful for this<br>opportunity to participate and we note<br>the importance of the support from all<br>our partners and if we would like to um<br>acknowledge the comments made by the<br>Chinese Ambassador it will be very<br>appreciative perhaps perhaps for the<br>next forum to invite our Pacific island<br>um colleagues so they can uh contribute<br>to these very important dialogue uh once<br>again thank you very much for this<br>opportunity and um we wish you all a<br>good day today thank you thank you very<br>much I'll call on Ambassador zong in a<br>moment but I should caution<br>professors Patman and gesi that I will<br>ask them for some brief comments in a<br>moment um Ambassador Jalen thank you sir<br>Jim for letting me uh have the last<br>words at least among the Diplomatic<br>colleagues uh and listening to the<br>discussion today um if there is any one<br>word that we can take away or take home<br>uh I think it must be it must be<br>cooperation cooperation within the<br>region cooperation uh uh with the extra<br>Regional uh partners and cooperation and<br>coordination among the extra<br>coordination part Partners both at the<br>regional level bilateral level and<br>sometimes in the at the global level as<br>well and<br>cooperation uh uh that should be based<br>on respect uh that should focus on<br>implementation and delivery of results<br>so that we could help the Pacific island<br>countries to achieve their goals uh for<br>peace and prosperity for themselves and<br>for the broader region as well as the<br>broader world thank you<br>thank you very much uh Professor<br>Patman yes I'm just sort of reflecting<br>on Chinese ambassador's comments and I<br>agree I I think we're living through an<br>international<br>transition uh in which we have problems<br>which do not respect borders such as<br>climate change which is a real challenge<br>for the Pacific Islands region as among<br>amongst many other places in the world<br>and the same time we have<br>reinvigorated uh geopolitical<br>competition and what I take out of about<br>discussions today is that we must not<br>lose sight of the fact not just in the<br>Pacific but in the rest of the world we<br>are challenged by problems uh which may<br>be described as B trans band issues uh<br>they cannot be solved unilaterally by<br>any great powers in the world I'm<br>talking about climate change Global<br>pandemics problems like transnational<br>terrorism and also problems of an<br>extended global economy and so we must<br>not lose Lo sight of the utter need the<br>real need for international cooperation<br>this is not a wishy-washy response it's<br>self-interest we cannot solve these<br>problems unless we cooperate and in that<br>sense the 21st century is different and<br>uh we need to um be mindful of the<br>dangers but also be alive to the<br>opportunities that it presents thank you<br>thank you very much Professor Batman<br>Professor gespi thank you s the the the<br>purpose of this Gathering like the one<br>last year was so that we could all start<br>communicating directly with each other<br>often I found in my experience that<br>countries talk past each other and what<br>the goal here was was that we could<br>share our understanding to what we<br>consider to be concerns and also what we<br>can think to be<br>Solutions I see a long and difficult<br>road ahead but fundamentally at the<br>moment I'm optimistic because the amount<br>of Goodwill I see with the participants<br>and a shared vision now we just have to<br>build that pathway to what cooperation<br>looks like but from here I see a good<br>future<br>cooperation which will res deliver<br>outcomes I think cooperation in fact<br>should be a byword of these discussions<br>but it must be cooperation focused on<br>outcomes you can measure it you can<br>manage it and that should be the<br>challenge thank you all for your<br>participation I've enjoyed my RO limited<br>role and trust that we will have similar<br>cooperation in the future thank you very</p></main><footer style="margin-top: 2rem; background: #0001; padding: 2rem; text-align: center;"><p>We Are The University</p><ul style="list-style-type: none; padding: 0;
