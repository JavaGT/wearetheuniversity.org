and<br>Keegan Wells to deliver the graduation<br>Teno tenot<br>tenot I want to start by acknowledging<br>monena members of the University Council<br>The Honorable Vice Chancellor and the<br>USA executive here today Emma Hana<br>Kellum and Emily<br>K graduates FAO friends extended family<br>dad<br>welcome you have spent many years<br>studying working tirelessly at a<br>worldclass institution and with the the<br>best university in New Zealand and<br>somehow it's been decided that I am the<br>best person to deliver your graduation<br>address I am as honored to be here today<br>as I am<br>unqualified how did I end up here a<br>question I have answered many a times<br>mostly to Keen University staff trying<br>to figure out how to recruit more<br>International students<br>my adult life began quite early I moved<br>out at 15 years old to escape a<br>turbulent home and learned quickly how<br>hard it was to navigate my own life with<br>distant support from my father I<br>finished high school worked multiple<br>jobs and by the time that I was 17 I was<br>ready to explore the world setting off<br>on a gap year traveling by<br>myself somewhere along the way I saw a<br>video from someone's semester exchange<br>and thought to myself yeah that looks<br>like a pretty cool gig so with the dumb<br>confidence that only a teenager could<br>possess I packed up my life and moved to<br>denan you can imagine my absolute shock<br>when I then landed at denon's<br>International<br>Airport thinking that one of the<br>greatest pranks of all time has just<br>been pulled on me there's no town no two<br>buildings and farmland as far as the eye<br>can<br>see but just after a quick two and a<br>half hour shuttle ride and an incidental<br>tour around in Eden I arrived at the<br>beautiful place I was to call home for<br>the next years lucky for me my<br>three-year undergraduate degree turned<br>into five with a master's add it in and<br>now one final additional year being your<br>student union president this three-year<br>degree has truly been the best six years<br>of my<br>life but I I'm a firm believer in<br>celebrating your successes I also know<br>that so many of us are consumed with the<br>next task The Next Step that we never<br>really stop to celebrate you absolutely<br>deserve to be so proud of yourselves of<br>your accomplishments and of the<br>connections and support systems you have<br>created<br>in the occasionally insed cardboard<br>boxes that we call<br>Flats I hope you take a moment today<br>even if it is many drinks in later<br>tonight to stop and really be proud of<br>what you have<br>accomplished but after today the big<br>worldwide awaits this world is far more<br>complex than any of us could ever<br>understand and luckily for us we are<br>also the same group of people tasked<br>with solving the issues of this complex<br>world my role as your graduation speaker<br>is to give advice on how to handle this<br>for me it kind of feels like the<br>recently educated leading the recently<br>educated but that is never a reason to<br>not try here are five lessons I have<br>learned from a hectic few years one be<br>naive when you are the least experienced<br>person in any given room you have the<br>biggest opportunity to learn take these<br>opportunities when you at the very<br>bottom you have no reputation to risk<br>but are in the best seat to judge<br>character this is truly a<br>gift two advice is free and people are<br>always more than willing to give it you<br>can pick and choose what you listen to<br>but it absolutely never hurts to<br>ask three a little bit of stubbornness<br>and a bit of stupidity can take you<br>quite far most of the moments I reflect<br>on in my life usually begin with me<br>asking the question how hard could it<br>really possibly be and so far it's been<br>hard occasionally but nothing has gotten<br>me yet you accomplish something you move<br>the normal and in no time you are able<br>to overcome the obstacles you wouldn't<br>have dreamed to been possible to just<br>swing the BET and pray is not really a<br>bad approach to many of things four and<br>I think the academics are going to love<br>this one everyone is an idiot everyone<br>no one around you truly knows what they<br>are doing everyone is just trying their<br>best and making stuff up on the<br>Fly not the speech though luckily I find<br>there's aort a disarming piece in<br>knowing this it also means to never<br>assume malice of others when it is<br>probably just ignorance this should<br>encourage you to be compassionate at all<br>times five<br>communication communication is the most<br>important tool that we have discussing<br>debating breaking down barriers learning<br>from each other is the only way that we<br>will be able to make change from a<br>university context and now I'm probably<br>once again talking to the people behind<br>me we buy into this insane notion that<br>the Arts and Sciences are Polar<br>Opposites of each other or at least<br>competing if we want to solve the vastly<br>complex issues of the future we cannot<br>be putting ourselves into these neat<br>little boxes and ignoring others we have<br>to be able to communicate with each<br>other we have to be able to communicate<br>verbally face to face but we also need<br>to be able to communicate our research<br>our findings our work that is not<br>possible if we stay in our neatly<br>labeled Echo Chambers<br>but these all of these lessons they<br>require optimism they require hope they<br>require the belief that tomorrow will be<br>better you have to have<br>optimism and there was a term that I<br>recently learned that I find to be<br>worthwhile here exential Joy it's the<br>exact opposite of existential dread<br>which is something that we constantly<br>hear<br>about but what we don't hear about so<br>much is the great celebration the<br>excitement of being able to be the<br>people to solve these complex problems<br>of the world to have the opportunity of<br>depolarizing politics to be the people<br>that break down barriers this is<br>exciting and we all have joy in us and<br>not because we've done anything in<br>particular to really deserve it or earn<br>it in any way but because we are lucky<br>enough to have it hardwired into us<br>things will distract us from this Joy<br>from time to time but it does<br>remain there are more paths than there<br>have ever been to success and triple the<br>number of definitions of success our<br>world is changing quicker than ever<br>before but so are we the world is<br>complex and so are we continue to learn<br>preferably outside your field ask<br>curious questions and even if you're<br>scared of something do it and do it<br>scared the confidence will follow<br>graduates congratulations again I wish<br>you the very best of luck and hope you<br>approach every situation with low<br>expectations and high Stoke ten Koto<br>Teno kakaha tenot<br>thank you Keegan for speaking to us<br>today we are so glad you landed at our<br>airport and made Den need in your home<br>thank you for the reminder to

your<br>communities 29 years ago I sat where you<br>are now moments after Crossing this very<br>stage having been kept by Dr Judith<br>midot like many of you perhaps I had<br>absolutely no idea what the future held<br>or where my degree would take me and I<br>certainly never imagined that one day I<br>would stand here before you but that is<br>the remarkable thing about life if you<br>keep putting one foot in front of the<br>other taking one step at a time always<br>remaining committed to finding and<br>staying true to your purpose incredible<br>things will happen for you and remember<br>purpose is shared meaning is personal to<br>each of us and gratitude is the great<br>connector so today as we celebrate your<br>success let us take a moment to<br>acknowledge the people who have<br>supported you along the way there's<br>those in the room there's those watching<br>online and there's those who are no<br>longer with us but remain close in our<br>heart I will invite you in a moment to<br>stand and join me in showing your<br>gratitude and whatever way is right for<br>your family but do let us take this<br>moment together to make some noise and<br>show those who have
