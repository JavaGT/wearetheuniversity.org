the<br>first verse of the New Zealand national<br>anthem will now be sung first in Tero<br>and then in English the words are<br>printed on the inside of the back cover<br>are<br>all<br>seated I call on the public or to<br>degree nothing can be achieved without a<br>plan Workforce and a way of doing<br>things that faki speaks to the<br>importance of having a plan created<br>shared objectives and a way of achieving<br>them something critical to any<br>individual group or institution's<br>success by his own admission as an otago<br>Commerce student in the<br>1970s one day becoming Chancellor of the<br>University wasn't exactly part of Steven<br>Higgs<br>plan with the benefit of hindsight it<br>would have certainly been a role to<br>Aspire to but not something Steven as an<br>18-year-old fresh out of Karai Valley<br>High School even<br>contemplated he did however maintain a<br>close relationship with his Elma mat<br>after graduating with a bachelor of<br>Commerce in accounting and Finance in<br>1979 he went on to lecture in<br>professional taxation at otago for about<br>15 years served on an Advisory Board to<br>the business school and was then a tax<br>advisor to the university for many years<br>first through price Waterhouse as it was<br>then known and subsequently through his<br>own firm pulson<br>higs it was 2012 when Steven got a phone<br>call out of the blue from then<br>Chancellor John Ward inviting him to<br>join the university<br>Council Steven says that given his<br>long-standing connections with otago and<br>his desire to give something back to the<br>institution he jumped at the<br>opportunity Steven was appointed<br>pro-chancellor in 2018 subsequently<br>taking on the role of the 20th<br>Chancellor of the university in March<br>2022 until his term ended in September<br>this<br>year he says the Chancellor's job is<br>simple in theory to guide steer and<br>conduct the university Council working<br>closely with the management<br>team but the tail end of Co lockdown<br>the beginning of the University's<br>recovery from the pandemic negotiating<br>Financial challenges and changes in Vice<br>Chancellor meant it was anything but<br>simple for Steven and there was<br>certainly very little time for him to<br>get his feet under the<br>desk one of his first and most important<br>tasks was to come up with a<br>plan Steven was instrumental in the<br>development and Adoption of Pata the<br>University's key strategic plan which<br>defines what we will do and gives<br>direction through to<br>2030 Pata sits within the context of<br>vision<br>2040 which sets the aspiration for who<br>we want to be a TTI Le University with<br>our people and knowledge transforming<br>lives connecting communities and<br>nurturing the<br>environment it sets out how the<br>university needs to evolve to meet the<br>expectations of our students staff man<br>fua alumni and other key stakeholders as<br>a contemporary and financially<br>sustainable<br>institution as well as adopting Pata the<br>university has this year taken two<br>significant steps under Steven's<br>leadership toward implementing it first<br>the appointment of The Honorable Grant<br>Robertson as Vice<br>Chancellor Steven says that grants<br>senior leadership experience at the<br>highest levels of government including<br>his strong capability and experience in<br>financial management and strategic<br>thinking and his ability to navigate<br>complex issues during challenging times<br>are attributes which made him stand out<br>for the<br>role and second in May the university<br>proudly launched the first substantial<br>changes in<br>155 years to its brand following an<br>extensive consultation<br>process the new brand includes a new<br>talk<br>and a mai name Oto vaku Waka both<br>created in collaboration with manaa<br>symbolizing our special place in the<br>world here in OT denen and celebrating<br>our story as a place of many<br>firsts I know the new brand is something<br>Steven takes special pride in and while<br>it was at times a somewhat contentious<br>issue he found the engagement and Mahi<br>particularly<br>rewarding as he said when the new brand<br>was<br>launched it reflects both the history of<br>the institution and our shared vision<br>for the future there is work ahead to<br>achieve our various strategic and<br>operational Ambitions and the new brand<br>is a clear signal of the type of<br>institution we want to be World leading<br>and teaching and research unique<br>nationally and internationally connected<br>students of course being a chance isn't<br>all AG genda papers cheering meetings<br>and making big decisions there are more<br>public facing aspects of the role<br>conferring degrees and diplomas and<br>representing the university as an<br>ambassador at all manner of events<br>ensuring otago's High standing is<br>maintained with alumni and The Wider<br>Community both nationally and<br>internationally and despite being a<br>humble somewhat reserved man who doesn't<br>seek the Limelight Steven always<br>undertook these duties with great Manor<br>and a<br>plum as Chancellor he shook an estimated<br>12,000 hands at graduation ceremonies<br>just like this one saying a few quick<br>words to congratulation to each graduent<br>as they

you very much for that fantastic<br>performance we are very privileged to<br>welcome as today's graduation speaker<br>and a tago leader who as you have heard<br>has demonstrated a decades long<br>commitment to the<br>university it gives me great pleasure to<br>introduce my predecessor former<br>Chancellor Steven higs as speaker and I<br>offer him my warmest congratulations on<br>receiving his honorary doctor of laws<br>today while working with Steven I've<br>seen he is all about teamwork and he is<br>very clear that anything that's been<br>achieved has been because we have done<br>it together that speaks strongly to his<br>values his high integrity and his sense<br>of calm especially Under Pressure I am<br>grateful for the way he worked with me<br>as we transitioned the chancellor role<br>he has been a wonderful role model and<br>he leaves very big shes to fill and I am<br>confident when he delivers his<br>graduation speech his words of wisdom<br>will resonate with our graduates today<br>no<br>Steven please join me in welcoming Mr<br>Steven higs to deliver the graduation<br>address<br>good to go Chancellor pro-chancellor<br>Vice Chancellor counselors distinguished<br>guests esteemed faculty proud family and<br>friends and of course most importantly<br>the graduates of<br>2024 today's a very special occasion for<br>graduates and for all those in the room<br>who have supported you family friends<br>academics support staff and<br>others you all deserve acknowledgement<br>but clearly the heartiest<br>congratulations I reserved for the<br>graduates so very well<br>done as a former Chancellor of this<br>great institution I'm honored to share<br>this day with you I've been part of many<br>graduation ceremonies as has been<br>mentioned and each one was very<br>special I don't get to shake your hands<br>and congratulate you individually today<br>which was always a real privilege<br>but I do get to deliver the graduation<br>address so I suppose that's some<br>consolation I'd like to thank Senate and<br>Council for the wonderful honor today my<br>12 years on Council and especially my<br>time as as Chancellor created a real<br>passion for the University of ATO its<br>people and the value it brings not just<br>to students but to Society at<br>large as The Honorable Dr Clark well<br>outlined my connection to this<br>University spans from my student days a<br>few years ago few more than I care to<br>mention uh through to my time as<br>Chancellor from studying just hard<br>enough in year one getting a bit of a<br>surprise and ramping it up a bit after<br>that 8:00 morning lectures followed by<br>morning coffee and a game of pool in the<br>union<br>building and a few beers at the guard's<br>Tavern I hasten to add not in the<br>morning through to this very memorable<br>day I've always appreciated the career<br>and life opportunities that my degree<br>and my study at tago has<br>created so as a look at it you graduates<br>today I can't help but think how far<br>You' have come and how much you too have<br>in front of you your stage is certainly<br>set for for future success you just need<br>to identify what success means to you<br>and embrace it and assure you take time<br>to enjoy the journey along the<br>way as you all know there's no one siiz<br>fits all path to<br>success some people lead their lives and<br>the careers with goals and plans and<br>that's great as long as you're willing<br>to throw those plans out the window or<br>at least change them when life happens<br>and believe me life will<br>happen another option is to muddle<br>along I'm told that graduation speech is<br>meant to be just a a little bit<br>motivational so I'm not recommending the<br>muddling along option<br>today so what should you do what's my<br>advice do you want my advice regardless<br>it's<br>coming experts recommend that for a<br>graduation speech to be memorable it<br>should have a small number of key<br>messages I'm a realist I have no idea<br>who spoke at my graduation ceremony or<br>what they said and I don't expect you to<br>to be too different but I am going to<br>give it a<br>try so my key message is for today work<br>hard apply yourself be flexible and keep<br>learning take opportunities and overlay<br>that by doing the right<br>thing by being here today graduates<br>you've clearly shown you can work hard<br>and apply yourselves or you're just<br>superb at avoiding hard work by using<br>AI I hope both are true<br>and either way you've made it so again<br>very well<br>done they say or they certainly used to<br>say that there's no substitute for hard<br>work perhaps that is genuinely genuinely<br>becoming a bit less true with tech and<br>AI uh and robots and the likes but if<br>you ask any successful person the CEO of<br>a company perhaps of a university a<br>clever scientist a business person<br>serving clients or a parent looking<br>after a toddler they'll all tell you<br>counts success can be measured in many<br>ways good outcomes for society personal<br>enjoyment positive relationships<br>Financial reward to name a few whatever<br>combination you choose and I recommend a<br>balance keep applying yourselves to<br>achieving all of them as you've clearly<br>atago at the same time look after<br>yourselves your generation knows better<br>than mine that work life balance<br>matters not that I like the work life<br>expression as they aren't mutually<br>exclusive indeed for most people work<br>and life uh positively intertwined and<br>indeed<br>interdependent I can see the value and<br>principle of a 4-day working week the<br>benefits of working from home an<br>unlimited annual leave but I suspect I<br>might have a slightly grumpy old man<br>view about some of the<br>detail what I do know is that work<br>family family friends sport Recreation<br>giving back to your<br>community those are the healthy parts of<br>a balanced life I'm sure you know that<br>too but choosing and living the balance<br>challenge today be very proud of your<br>education to date and of your graduation<br>as I've said you have a great platform<br>from which to<br>launch but the world you live and work<br>in is changing all the time that change<br>will require you to be adaptable and<br>resilient and in your time at a tarer<br>you've already well demonstrated that<br>you have those attributes by living and<br>studying successfully it would seem in<br>times change also requires continuous<br>learning I happen to know a good<br>University that can help you with that<br>stay curious seek knowledge Embrace<br>challenges and change and take<br>opportunities which is message three<br>as alumni of ataro you join a network of<br>individuals shaping New Zealand and in<br>many cases the world's wider<br>future as Chancellor I had the pleasure<br>of engaging which is a flash way of<br>saying eating drinking and chatting with<br>a tago Alum around the world they<br>remember their time at ataro with great<br>fondness and I hope you do<br>too many of those Al are leaders in<br>their fields of work in their<br>communities and in some cases helping to<br>run their<br>countries you have the foundation now to<br>do the same and I'm confident you'll<br>take the opportunities in front of<br>you and many of you will be those<br>planning types I mentioned earlier and<br>you'll seek out and create new<br>opportunities by the way make sure you<br>get engaged in pressing issues and there<br>are plenty of those in this Modern World<br>Challenge the status quo and make sure<br>you're part of something bigger than<br>just<br>yourself my fourth point is do the right<br>thing<br>the world today is full of opinions<br>which is great having opinions and aing<br>those is how we Foster debate and how we<br>improve society and of course it's what<br>universities are all<br>about the world's also full of noise<br>so-called commentators and influencers<br>and members of the public who seem to<br>think they're in one of those<br>categories and increasingly there are<br>interest groups that do great work but<br>seem able to acknowledge only the narrow<br>views of their constituents<br>social media and much of the mainstream<br>media very happy to fuel strong and<br>varied opinion they feed on drama and<br>they exaggerate disagreement and<br>controversy in my opinion that's not<br>always so great so I strongly encourage<br>you to keep doing what you must have<br>been doing to be so successful in your<br>lives to date that is form your own<br>views after careful thought keep<br>considering others views debating<br>constructively agreeing where you where<br>you're able to and otherwise agreeing to<br>differ or shock horror<br>compromising compromising is not the<br>same as conceding and it needn't be<br>abandoning your<br>principles and if none of that works to<br>resolve other differences try what my<br>rock doing the right thing is not about<br>trying to please everyone that's just<br>not possible possible it's about being<br>true to your values while treating<br>others with respect even when that's not<br>easy to the graduates of 2024 cherish<br>your accomplishments to date cherish<br>your time at of<br>Targo and celebrate tonight wildly or<br>quietly whatever works best for you you<br>have well and truly earned that<br>right keep applying yourself to work<br>play and Community you've done that<br>superbly to date keep learning<br>take and create<br>opportunities and do the right thing<br>because the world surely needs more of<br>that<br>t thank you Steven for speaking with us<br>today and for reminding our graduates to<br>work hard apply themselves to be<br>flexible to take opportunities and to do<br>the right thing you spoke of being<br>something bigger than just yourself and<br>that completely encapsulates the service<br>and your leadership at Oto and you<br>reminded us of the importance of<br>constructive debate and<br>compromise on behalf of the University I<br>thank you and Gail for your<br>contributions and service and for<br>sharing your wisdom with our graduates<br>and for reminding us that paper scissors<br>rocks also works and we might try that<br>one later I ask the

cap<br>her granddaughter Grace and to know that<br>her husband Tim is in the audience on<br>what is a special Family Day in many<br>ways and like many of you perhaps all<br>those years ago I had no idea what the<br>future held or where my degree would<br>take me I certainly never imagined that<br>one day I would be standing here before<br>you but that is the very remarkable<br>thing about life

happen for you and<br>remember purpose is shared meaning is<br>personal to each of us and gratitude is<br>the great<br>connector so today as we celebrate your<br>success let us take a moment together
