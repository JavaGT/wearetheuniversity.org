the public aitor to<br>present a candidate for an honorary<br>degree<br>It is Well understood in University<br>circles that taking sabatical leave can<br>lead to unexpected<br>consequences sometimes it leads to a<br>change of research Focus but in some<br>special cases it actually changes the<br>direction of the rest of our<br>lives one such case in 1998 diverted a<br>medical family from Bristol one a<br>practicing GP the other a senior Lector<br>in anatomy into a dramatically<br>alternative future they arrived into<br>that future through the unlikeliest of<br>portals paliston<br>North the person on sabatical leave was<br>Helen Nicholson who had to that point<br>already had an academic career that was<br>not entirely typical Helen comes from a<br>small village in Hampshire with the<br>trail blazing Florence nightingale's<br>grave is in the local<br>churchyard she was the first in her<br>family to go to university studying at<br>the University of Bristol after<br>graduating as a doctor in 1979 having<br>met husband Phil at Medical School she<br>worked as a family planning doctor while<br>studying for a doctor of medicine and<br>anatomy and raising her children Naomi<br>and<br>Nick increasingly drawn to research<br>questions around human infertility she<br>took up an academic position in anatomy<br>at the University of Bristol in 1991 1<br>becoming the only woman in a large<br>Department in 1998 Helen applied for<br>sabatical leave to visit one of the<br>world centers of mamalian infertility<br>research Messi university in palmon<br>North during that sabatical she traveled<br>south to visit Professor Gareth Jones at<br>the University of otago with whom she<br>shared many academic and ecclesiastical<br>interests an astute Institute tional<br>politician Gareth recognized that he<br>might have found the ideal candidate to<br>follow him into leadership and anatomy<br>and other high officers at<br>otago in his assessment Helen was<br>already ready for leadership she had<br>shown at Bristol that she could lead<br>significant interventions to make<br>struggling academic units successful<br>again she was also in his estimation a<br>tenacious champion of anatomy as a key<br>element of The Wider medical<br>Sciences intrigued by her meeting with<br>Gareth Helen applied for the chair in<br>anatomy at otago she took up the role in<br>2000 and she and her family found<br>themselves in a dramatically New Life in<br>dened Her time of otago from that point<br>forward increasingly became<br>characterized by very diligent teaching<br>and research along with a dedication to<br>innovatively addressing compelling<br>issues in science her collaboration to<br>produce the award-winning documentary<br>donated to science on the use of donated<br>bodies for anatomical research and<br>teaching is some think she considers one<br>of her career<br>highlights she also saw this period as a<br>time of confronting and overcoming<br>cultural norms and Anatomy which had up<br>until then been an extremely<br>male-dominated<br>discipline alongside research teaching<br>and Public Communication Helen began to<br>quickly make good on her evident<br>leadership potential in 2003 she became<br>head of department and in 2007 she took<br>on the role of Dean of the otago school<br>of medical Sciences<br>a rapid Ascent into Senior University<br>leadership followed with the positions<br>of acting Deputy Vice Chancellor<br>research and Enterprise and then provice<br>Chancellor International then she was<br>the first appointee to the position of<br>Deputy Vice Chancellor external<br>2015 in early<br>2021 Helen took on what she thought<br>would be her final role before<br>retirement a called to serve as Deputy<br>Vice Chancellor academic as the<br>University was managing its way out of<br>the first year of<br>covid-19 her plan was to manage the<br>University's academic systems out of a<br>very difficult period and then<br>retire this high pressure role then<br>pivoted in an unexpected Direction with<br>the departure of Vice Chancellor Haren<br>Hayne to a role in Australia Helen<br>stepped into the role of acting Vice<br>Chancellor during what at the time<br>seemed like the recovery period after<br>the trials of 2020 her plan was to see<br>the University through to the<br>appointment of a new Vice Chancellor and<br>then<br>retire It's Not Unusual to turn to one<br>of our most Trusted Senior leaders to<br>guide the university during the search<br>for a new Vice<br>Chancellor it's very unusual however to<br>have to do so<br>twice Helen's years as acting Vice<br>Chancellor actually turned out to be<br>exceptionally challenging and placed<br>huge demands on her leadership following<br>hard on the exhaustion and disruption of<br>the early Co lockdowns the University<br>went through a febrile period of student<br>enrollments then a dramatically<br>escalating financial<br>crisis hadon led the first part of the<br>University's response and then hand it<br>over to the newly appointed Vice<br>Chancellor David<br>Murdoch when he began experiencing<br>health issues she delayed retirement and<br>stepped in<br>again by the time she handed over to<br>Grant Robertson as incoming Vice<br>Chancellor and July 2024 she had been<br>leading on and off for over 2 years and<br>the university had come through the<br>worst for all of us who worked here<br>through those turbulent times Helen was<br>a rock a solid point of calm and decency<br>someone we could trust and rely on she<br>chose to front with staff about the<br>extent of our financial and Staffing<br>challenges including one particularly<br>difficult old staff assembly when she<br>slipped and fell on ice just beforehand<br>and delivered difficult news and fielded<br>tough questions with a cracked rib<br>if the university feels like it is now<br>moving into better times it is in good<br>part because of Helen's<br>leadership and Third Time Lucky when<br>Grant Robertson arrived she finally<br>managed to<br>retire she departed with the Goodwill of<br>people all across the<br>university the University of Oto Awards<br>honory doctorates partly to recognize<br>outstanding<br>achievement but it also Awards them to<br>recognize and reinforce the values we<br>hold dear as an instit<br>ution values of not only academic<br>Excellence but also of service of<br>dedication of demonstrating decency and<br>care even in the most difficult of<br>circumstances values that give us the<br>leaders we need in challenging<br>times today we honor Helen Nicholson as<br>someone who has embodied all these<br>values true leadership it seems is not<br>revealed in the best of times it is<br>revealed in the worst of<br>times we honor her for being willing to<br>take on the role of leader in the most<br>difficult of circumstances we honor her<br>for her decency and compassion as a<br>leader and we honor her for her conduct<br>as the kind of person who could lead<br>through crisis and walk away from the<br>job having earned the respect and<br>admiration of her<br>institution Chancellor I have the

her as an<br>unflappable sorry as unflappable a<br>leader who didn't shy away from making<br>decisions but who also respected the<br>expertise of her team I am confident<br>that when she delivers her address today<br>her words of wisdom will resonate<br>strongly with our graduates<br>nor k please join me in welcoming<br>Emeritus Professor Helen Nicholson to<br>deliver the graduation<br>address tenot<br>C it's a great privilege to be with you<br>today I'm humbled surprised and<br>extremely grateful to have received an<br>honory degree not least because unlike<br>most of you I didn't have to sit any<br>exams I'd like to thank the University<br>staff and students for the support and<br>opportunities they've shown me since I<br>arrived 24 years ago and I'm especially<br>grateful for your Mahi commitment and<br>kindness over the last few challenging<br>Years to all our graduates<br>congratulations you made it not only<br>have you completed what is normally a<br>challenging journey to achieve your<br>degree or diploma but most of you did<br>this while while also NE negotiating a<br>significant<br>pandemic we shouldn't underestimate the<br>toll that covid has had on us us all<br>students and staff alike so well<br>done I'd also like to<br>congratulate um and thank your Faro and<br>friends I know that I wouldn't be here<br>without the love and support of my<br>family and friends and I'm sure the same<br>is true of the graduates I'd personally<br>like to give a big thank you to my husb<br>husband and children and my<br>friends so I've been asked to provide<br>you with good advice for the future now<br>as you can imagine I've sat through<br>quite a few graduations in my career and<br>I know that you will remember very<br>little of what I<br>say so here goes I have three things for<br>you to consider change courage and<br>care first change there's no doubt that<br>in the coming years the world will<br>change and so were your<br>aspirations granted I'm quite old but<br>when I attended my first graduation<br>there were no laptops in fact when I was<br>a third-year student our class was taken<br>over to the equivalent of the clock<br>tower to see the University's only<br>Mainframe computer this computer<br>occupied the whole of the basement of<br>the<br>building at the time there was no email<br>or social media and the first mobile<br>phone mobile phone that my husband<br>brought home for his a GP for when he<br>was on call was literally the size of a<br>brick and it came with its own carrying<br>bag because it was so<br>heavy who knows where technology will<br>take us in the decades to<br>come thankfully the training I received<br>at University has enabled me to navigate<br>changes in technology and culture and I<br>hope that you too have picked up<br>sufficient skills at ataro to able you<br>to cope with the changes that will come<br>your<br>way you too will change or at least your<br>dreams and aspirations<br>May if you'd asked me doing my medical<br>degree what I was going to do when I<br>grew up not that I think I've ever grown<br>up um I would have told you that I was<br>going to be a surgeon not get married<br>and not have<br>children and have youve as you've heard<br>from Hugh the public aitor that isn't<br>exactly where my life life has taken me<br>here I am on the other side of the world<br>happily married with two children and a<br>mapuna I certainly didn't expect to be<br>here today in the words of Forest<br>Gump life is like a box of chocolates<br>you never know what you will get so<br>accept that change will happen embrace<br>it and continue to use the skills you've<br>learned you've acquired to be a lifelong<br>learner and to adapt<br>now I have to<br>courage when change comes with change<br>comes opportunities and when an<br>opportunity comes our way we can respond<br>in several ways we can ignore it and<br>stay in our comfort zone or we can test<br>it and grasp it can I suggest that you<br>don't automatically dismiss<br>opportunities that are presented to you<br>but instead you're courageous and<br>consider taking on new<br>challenges it's by stepping out of our<br>comfort Zone that we<br>grow for me I had to be courageous to<br>move from my clinical medicine where I<br>was training to be a surgeon to go back<br>to do a research degree and become a<br>biomedical scientist when people were<br>telling me that I was a good clinician<br>and I should stay looking after<br>patients I had to be courageous and<br>persuasive to convince my family that<br>moving to the other side of the world<br>was going to be a great idea thankfully<br>that it took a little bit more work but<br>it's worked out okay for all of<br>us there are other times when you'll<br>need to show courage and these are times<br>when you have to be true to who you are<br>and what you<br>believe there will be times when you<br>have difficult decisions to make<br>certainly as the acting Vice Chancellor<br>I found that was the<br>case for example the launching of the<br>new Tero name fak ihu Waka and the too<br>and the Lo the logo did not receive<br>University Universal approval certainly<br>not from the ODT but I believe it was<br>University and in financially<br>challenging times that we've seen there<br>were some really tough decisions to that<br>had to be made that affected many<br>people's lives in these situations it's<br>always tempting to take the easy way out<br>and perhaps bury one's head in the sand<br>and do nothing but often this may create<br>even more difficulties down the line it<br>is sometimes easier to follow the crowd<br>but each of us is different and it's<br>important to celebrate who we are as the<br>writer Maya Angelo wisely said if you're<br>always trying to be normal you will<br>never know how amazing you can be so<br>during your journey through true life be<br>courageous stand up for what you believe<br>to be true and do the right<br>thing and finally caring which is the<br>most important of the three<br>themes you heard Prof Bron at the<br>faki what is the most important thing in<br>the world it is the people as I reflect<br>on my life it is the people who've<br>supported me walked with me and<br>challenged me that I value most I've<br>been fortunate in my career to meet some<br>amazing people um famous people they're<br>not so famous those who quietly get on<br>with helping others people are the most<br>important and they need to be cared for<br>and that includes you<br>yourself because only when you are well<br>can you care for others now I'm not<br>going to tell you to eat properly and<br>get enough sleep I'm sure you know this<br>by now but I would encourage you to get<br>to know yourself and understand what<br>you're good at and equally well what<br>you're not so good at this is important<br>as you consider the opportunities that<br>will come your way in the future in your<br>communities and as you work in and Lead<br>teams as you may have gathered by what<br>Hugh said I get bored easily I'm a big<br>picture person who's not always<br>interested in all of the minute details<br>I'm better at starting projects than<br>finishing them as my family will tell<br>you and knowing my weaknesses has help<br>me understand the importance of building<br>teams with diverse skills and<br>personalities and definitely not just<br>people who think like<br>me so what about caring for others<br>during Co jinda ad repeatedly encourage<br>us to be kind I don't think this is just<br>a message for when we're in the middle<br>of a<br>pandemic it costs nothing to be kind so<br>be kind to all those you meet whatever<br>their role or position may be and<br>however challenging you may find them<br>and we all have people that we find<br>challenging as an anatomist I know that<br>for the body to function well you need<br>all of the different organs and tissues<br>however insignificant they may seem to<br>work together the same is true in our<br>work and social lives<br>everyone matters not just those with the<br>fancy<br>titles so I do hope that you've enjoyed<br>your time at atago and that you have<br>made many great friends many of these<br>friends will be friends for<br>life 50 years on from when I started<br>University I'm still in touch with some<br>my many of my classmates via class<br>reunions and a WhatsApp group hold on to<br>these friends keep in touch with them<br>even if you end up in the different<br>parts of the world but if you do turn<br>your phone on to silent at night so that<br>you don't get all the pings so let me<br>finish by wishing you all the very best<br>for the<br>future remember to learn to embrace<br>change be courageous and care for<br>yourselves and those around you Nora<br>thank you hel for speaking with us today<br>and sharing three important messages<br>change courage and caring and thank you<br>for reminding our
