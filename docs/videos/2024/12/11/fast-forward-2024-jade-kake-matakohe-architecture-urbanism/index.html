six uh fast forward lectures<br>um uh thank you for battling through the<br>rain through um uh um the stormy weather<br>outside it's um a great pleasure to have<br>you with us tonight um little bit of<br>housekeeping to start with bathrooms out<br>the door and kind of straight across the<br>corridor<br>assembly area uh is out on Simon Street<br>I guess you want to take your umbrellas<br>with you should should things uh things<br>go A bit sideways um um if you need CPD<br>points um there's a along in various<br>spots around the room there's a kind of<br>QR code if you scan that that will take<br>you to where you need to go to to<br>register your CPD<br>points<br>um really important for us to thank um<br>jib who are the sponsors of the of the<br>fast foro lecture series have been for<br>15 years you know they tremendous kind<br>of support to um to the fast forward<br>program and to the school we certainly<br>couldn't do a lot of what um of what we<br>do without their um tremendous support<br>so I'm going to show you a<br>video of uh JB's new Factory<br>sh<br>w<br>um so um so again huge thanks to jib the<br>folk were telling me an amazing story<br>about the factory this new Factory with<br>all new kit in Tonga um last week um the<br>drying machines are so efficient they<br>produce the moisture comes out of the<br>jib as they're making the things but<br>they're so efficient at keeping the heat<br>um inside the Machinery that the factory<br>itself is cold and so they've now got<br>this new problem of clouds forming<br>inside the factory because the machines<br>are so efficient so they're having to<br>run around and make the machine slightly<br>less efficient in order to prevent Cloud<br>swarming um inside the factory<br>amazing um so um thank you for coming so<br>um tonight's speaker is Jade K we're<br>very excited to hear from her um to<br>introduce her very briefly so we can so<br>we can hear um as much as we can from<br>her um jade is um one of those people<br>that seems to be able to do everything<br>um I think what the Americans call a<br>triple<br>threat um you know so um um first I<br>think you certainly came to my attention<br>first um winning the Warren trust<br>writing award I think you won it two<br>years in a row yeah and then name made<br>me be a judge now so so you didn't so<br>you didn't get to avoid the three peat<br>um and also I'm incredibly active as um<br>an organizer as an activist um working<br>with local communities and um<br>particularly what hoping to hear about<br>tonight is um work as a designer in<br>particularly doing super interesting<br>Innovative things with Mai with Papa K<br>and also with um Civic spaces<br>particularly up in up in ther um and<br>really um of late seems to have a<br>accelerating output like a whole whole<br>stack of projects that kind are kind of<br>emerging into the public realm so we're<br>really excited to hear about those so if<br>you would join me and putting your hands<br>Kake oh oh am I on yes I did listen to<br>um thank you so much for coming out on<br>this wind windy rainy you know<br>unpleasant night I know it really puts<br>us all off actually we just want to go<br>home and be warm so thank you to<br>everyone who braved the cold to be here<br>um I raced down from farang which sounds<br>like very poor planning but I had an<br>important project meeting today that had<br>to be today and you know it just went<br>that way so I got straight in my car<br>from a meeting and and rolled on down<br>here and got lost in I had to call<br>Andrew I thought it was going to be in<br>that other room that's often in um great<br>so I think when I got invited to do this<br>talk obviously I traed about and do a<br>bit of talking about things that I'm up<br>to um and often I talk about Papa kinger<br>and that I which all projects really<br>close to my heart uh but I thought for<br>this one it might be nice to talk about<br>some of with the cultural landscape work<br>we've been doing in farang and I say we<br>meaning my Hau but also um M here which<br>is the um company that I founded about<br>six years ago we just turned six which<br>is in a tumultuous economic environment<br>nice to be six now um so um you know I<br>think a lot of the amazing things that<br>are happening in terms of regeneration<br>of fang they don't sit with us alone but<br>since I've been working alongside my<br>coatu I've been priv to be involved in a<br>lot of really amazing projects and you<br>can now start to see the changes in the<br>urban fabric of fang uh for those of us<br>who are from there it's somewhere really<br>dear to our heart and there's many um<br>layers of faka Poa and meaning in<br>history those aren't always visible<br>those aren't always on the surface uh<br>sometimes is a very Colonial or should I<br>say kind of ugly 7s kind of overlay and<br>you know it's been a real joy to kind of<br>work collaboratively to start to unpeel<br>those layers and reveal something new<br>and exciting for the future so I'm going<br>to whip through a few different projects<br>and besides showing um some of the cool<br>stuff our hway has been doing in terms<br>of integrating our cultural narratives<br>and our understanding of Tik konger<br>within Civic and and public spaces I<br>also wanted to show a bit of a spectrum<br>of collaboration ranging from the first<br>project where it was one of the very it<br>was actually the very first one that I<br>did besides our Papa ker that we were<br>working on at this the same time it was<br>the first cultural narrative public<br>space one that that we did and that was<br>really more around facilitating deciding<br>what narratives could be expressed<br>uncovering the history and there was a<br>bit of design interpretation but not<br>that much because a lot of the design<br>decisions had already been made um but<br>the things we got in were great and then<br>the next project there was more<br>collaboration again and greater design<br>role the next one was really quite<br>squarely in Partnership uh with the<br>other Architects and then the last one<br>I'll show we were the Sol Architects so<br>we've been kind of working our way up at<br>least in this space and why that last<br>one is right quite important and I'll<br>talk about it when I get to it is that<br>that was the first time we were both the<br>sole architect and we were also leading<br>the cultural narrative integration and<br>working alongside our com arts and our<br>artists um that's not to say we don't<br>want to collaborate collaborating is<br>fantastic but I do think that um it was<br>great for us to also be able to<br>demonstrate that we can do both of those<br>roles on a complex project um and it<br>opened last Friday so was actually<br>really excited to show you a little<br>sneak peek um also um this is not I<br>shouldn't say not very professional but<br>I haven't managed to get professional<br>photographs of these so these are all my<br>photographs um and I really must uh<br>think about setting aside money for<br>photographers in the marketing budget if<br>we're going to be doing um ambitious<br>projects that get shown a bit which is<br>like a little bit different to when<br>you're doing a project which is<br>beautiful and special but anyway so I'm<br>that's what I'm learning as a small<br>practitioner is actually like<br>photographs and things are important so<br>hopefully my photographs will make do um<br>so I haven't even clicked the first<br>slide<br>but that's what it's all about and also<br>what I want to thread through this talk<br>is a bit of information about our fua<br>and history so that you understand where<br>we are in the world and the things that<br>are important to us and sometimes and I<br>I will flick to the first slide very<br>soon um sometimes I feel like to outside<br>people they kind of see these squabbles<br>amongst and between our hu and they<br>don't realize that we're all really<br>really closely related and we all know<br>each other really well so like oh my<br>goodness this is really overwhelming but<br>it's like oh look they're yelling at<br>each other now it'll be fine you know<br>tomorrow don't worry about it which I<br>can say cuz I know how they all connect<br>but I think sometimes the complexity of<br>relationships is is something to Grapple<br>with in these kind of Mary spaces and<br>within our H boo<br>spaces cool<br>ah um I thought I might also share a<br>little bit of my Papa through what<br>I like to call a flash pep so it's not<br>like where you just say which is fine<br>know um The Flash one is where you kind<br>of take you on a little bit of a journey<br>so<br>um so and then I fly down to my river<br>which we call H which is like a a<br>calabash for bearing water which is a<br>really old word and an old name um<br>that's being reclaimed but it's also<br>known as ha and there isn't consensus<br>that it's hael Hil but amongst my Hau we<br>favor The Hil version but I wouldn't say<br>so I swim in my hour um from the<br>beginning which this isn't this is kind<br>of halfway through I can almost see my<br>house from here um and then swim down to<br>hour so um to the mouth of the hour and<br>to<br>just the name of<br>our<br>um so I climb up to the top and this<br>used to be a pass site OFA and I look<br>um um so what the name means<br>is is about the K tree clinging to the<br>the rock<br>face kohatu and there's no k k trees<br>there now but there was and that was the<br>um that was the too that that led to the<br>name<br>m and then the K you know a bit like k<br>just gets kind of shortened um and<br>that's<br>the so I name my business after this m<br>one because I was a t parite but two<br>because of this view where if you're<br>standing at the top you can see this<br>amazing Vista all around the harbor and<br>you can see all of those historic ker<br>historic path sites well probably not<br>all of them but like most of them and<br>you can see the Contemporary town area<br>and so I thought it was a bit of a too<br>around what the future might look like<br>um with our positive intervention uh and<br>reclaiming within this urban area oh<br>so six years ago<br>started um with a an ambitious dream<br>that I continue to have um I I can see<br>some really seasoned practitioners um<br>architects who who've been their own<br>bosses for a long time so you all know<br>that it's a hard hustle um but it's also<br>a real joy and a real privilege the kind<br>of work that we get to do and the<br>communities that we get to work with um<br>and here's our awesome team um fabulous<br>mix of skills and poer uh United by<br>kind of common belief and purpose about<br>what we're trying to do which is really<br>work walk walk alongside our communities<br>um something I often say to students<br>because I'm also teaching part-time at a<br>which is probably the wrong plug for<br>this audience I know we're uh<br>to but I did want to mention it because<br>something I often say to my students is<br>look around at your classmates because<br>they might be either who you start a<br>business with or who you end up working<br>with in the future and those<br>relationships are really important and I<br>mentioned that here because two of my uh<br>workmates are also friends from<br>architecture school and they uh agreed<br>when I said do you want to come work<br>with<br>me and okay on to the a bit about the<br>cultural landscape so this is the city<br>area um and you can see some of the<br>sight lines to important uh landmarks<br>that are outside of you<br>so tupar Haka which is oura p which is<br>the Western Hills U Manaya which is the<br>beautiful view you can see when you come<br>over the Bruins and you look out and<br>there's that jaggedy MOA um and a word<br>on manah so manah is also our our tuper<br>um and is the tuper for all of us who F<br>so it goes manah and then four<br>generations down from manah is tahi and<br>I really always worry about getting this<br>wrong yes that's I did get it wrong two<br>generations from T who's also listed as<br>an anonomous ancestor so we'll either<br>say it's one of those two two<br>generations down from him was tah puki<br>and he married Rai so RI and Ru which is<br>a very famous story that many of you may<br>have heard they were twins that came up<br>from the W on the back of a Manu they<br>were off to go marry up further north<br>and um the sister so Rai heard her<br>sister day too Whispering whispering in<br>the manu's ear that she wanted um on for<br>herself cuz they both set to marry this<br>guy and so RI is like no put me down<br>I'll wait for my brothers and my dad<br>here and so they put her down in on on<br>was another longer name that got<br>shortened and um from there she waited<br>but actually then she met T and mared in<br>and so we allend from Rai as well um<br>those of us who are from Fang um cool<br>maybe a little bit about projects oh no<br>more history um so that pink that pink<br>outline that pink outline is the<br>original kth Pur purchase so in terms of<br>Old Land claims old land purchases<br>there's a few that are recorded um that<br>they call Old Land claims and I don't<br>quite know the distinction but it was a<br>particular point in time possibly before<br>the native lanord I think that might be<br>the delineation and then there's another<br>set of kind of you know land titling<br>exercises but these early early claims<br>there's two main ones in the farang City<br>area one is the kth purchase and one is<br>the m purchase and the kth purchase is<br>this pink outline and you can see it<br>takes in like the town Basin area uh it<br>takes in like the CBD area and up into<br>Kensington region Western Hills so uh<br>covers all of the projects like the<br>areas where all the projects on that I'm<br>going to talk about today are in this<br>original kth purchase um and then this<br>historic photo uh which to be honest I<br>just grabbed from a document that my<br>cousin made and so it doesn't show the I<br>really want um but you can see some of<br>it which is a bit above the town Basin<br>but even from this image you can see<br>that actually the land's been<br>transformed a lot there's been a lot of<br>um land reclamation and land shaping and<br>something that's really significant<br>about that is that in 19 I think' 07 or<br>05 but I think it's 07 there was the<br>harbor board visting act and what the<br>piece of legislation did was claimed for<br>for the crown all of the land below the<br>high tide mark But in far we had a lot<br>of land below the high tide Mark and a<br>lot of land that had started being<br>dredged out of the sea anyway so areas<br>that were perfectly kind of serviceable<br>it was like okay well the harbor board<br>owns it now um so that was quite<br>challenging and it was a very big<br>legislative tool used to alienate land<br>in fanga day uh and in Fang District um<br>the white Tangy tribunal conceded that<br>we were left virtually landless so so we<br>ended up with I think we got 4% of land<br>which sounds okay when you think oh it's<br>about 5 1/2% Nationwide but if you go<br>further up to like the far north they<br>like got more like you know<br>25% 30% you know it's a lot higher than<br>farang day which is really really<br>low um cool so this is um this is a view<br>of the pedestrian bridge and I took it<br>when I was walking from my house to go<br>check out the utaki<br>park and there's the H ofasa the famous<br>hassa um which I think people have mixed<br>views about fair enough but and I think<br>it's been a real Catalyst project and<br>that's a really positive thing um my<br>main concern and I you know I've got<br>I've got the stage so I guess I can say<br>it is that I fear that our architectural<br>idity as TI toiro in particular is being<br>defined by haas's style which I don't<br>really think he himself would have<br>wanted it doesn't I to me that doesn't<br>align with the philosophy that he had um<br>but maybe the answer is that we just<br>need more strongly terai too<br>architecture that really reflects our<br>identity and culture and then this can<br>just be you know other things that are<br>there that are great that that have a<br>history and and a faka<br>POA um cool and this is um tah park now<br>the name is around the Confluence of<br>salt water and fresh water which is<br>pretty much what happens around this<br>point in the hour and it's also about<br>the mingling and kind of coming either<br>of<br>peoples uh as I said this was the first<br>one we did that was kind of a public<br>project and our role was reasonably<br>small but it was um quite significant<br>because there hadn't been a lot of<br>council Le projects where hapu had been<br>involved invited to be involved in that<br>way like it really I think has only been<br>happening for the last I don't know<br>maybe eight years um and so you know<br>this it's a really successful Park and<br>it's really well- loved um but the<br>scheme was pretty much when hu got<br>involved and then we were able to add<br>some things that um I think really<br>create a sense of place so these<br>patterns refer to the P um which which<br>I'm going to say used to be in the hour<br>so this location actually is um the real<br>name<br>iser and eher was a son<br>OFA<br>froma and he was probably about 12th<br>century centuary roaming about naming<br>places and and uh he stopped by the edge<br>of our banks of our a and you know had a<br>fire and roasted him up some Cody snails<br>for a kai and that was how this area got<br>its name um and he named many places<br>around the north um so that gives you I<br>guess a few Clues um one is that it's it<br>was probably a good Kai Gathering Spot<br>not too not too far from here um but<br>also from talking to our katua they<br>remember when the water was healthier<br>and we had had a lot more species and I<br>remember one time I sat down with one of<br>the uncles and I was like oh yeah okay<br>what was in there when you were a kid<br>all right L them and I was writing down<br>all the names of different shellfish and<br>and different um fish and things that<br>were in there and um I wouldn't I<br>wouldn't consider it a marking a kind<br>now it's just just not healthy anymore<br>but that's a goal in the future is for<br>our um for our Harbor and for our<br>waterways to be healthy enough to be a<br>to gather kimana again so this remembers<br>that even if it's not our current<br>reality it could be our future<br>um and this is really neat actually and<br>so um I think this also is quite nice I<br>mean the council wanted to do it cuz<br>they're like you know it's Interactive<br>Kids all love it which they do um but I<br>also think it speaks quite nicely to<br>this idea of Confluence and this meeting<br>Wasing um and it used to be it used to<br>to be a car park so this just really<br>improved things it's like I collect much<br>of fang what it used to be like maybe<br>isn't that great or what it is currently<br>isn't that great so like most<br>interventions are going to be kind of<br>positive and like this is a million<br>times better than having a car pack um<br>and my favorite narrative that got<br>introduced is actually um to do with<br>when kth was allowed to set up a well to<br>allowed to build himself a FY in this<br>area and so um he asked e<br>who is was a of that time I think it's<br>kind of early 1800s 1820s around that<br>era um and he's actually a grandson of<br>Tio Tui who was the one that um had that<br>Rumble and then you know the hu got its<br>name and so he was one of the main<br>youngest H at that time and so Kus said<br>to him well you know where are the<br>people of this land cuz it looked like<br>no one was living there and he's his<br>response and I've only actually seen<br>this in English so I'm not sure if he<br>responded in s which sh he bought of<br>because of the time period most of those<br>early kind of settlers and missionaries<br>they just learned to D cuz that's what<br>everyone spoke but I've only heard it in<br>English so I won't try to a mild it<br>retrospectively knowing that it could be<br>not what happened but anyway but<br>basically in English it was you'll<br>you'll find them towards the setting sun<br>and the gist of that was actually too's<br>territory extends from Far Harbor all<br>the way out west um through to through<br>Toria through that area and so they were<br>just there at that time um it wasn't<br>like they didn't have the Fino anymore<br>it's just like you know they moved<br>around seasonally and so you know the<br>collective that owned that land was over<br>there and I think for IAH he was happy<br>to let this you know settler have a<br>house no problem go for it um but there<br>was different I I I read some of the<br>things I've read he did try to<br>understand Tia and there was some famous<br>missteps like where he took a um a brand<br>from a fire that was a cooking fire and<br>then kind of mixed it up with<br>ah something that he shouldn't have<br>anyway he burned something he shouldn't<br>have that was kind of mixing tapu and<br>Noah and the people there was a child<br>and a woman there and they were just<br>horrified that he'd done that and then<br>they later died because of that breach<br>of taper like so you know those kind of<br>things would happen but from all<br>accounts he was trying to follow it but<br>it was just such a different system to<br>him and there was such different<br>understandings and so the point of this<br>story is he kept putting up fences but<br>because he put his house in his fences<br>right through a walkway where people<br>always would go they just would like<br>walk through his fence walk through his<br>house they would they were like well<br>this is the path that we take so you<br>know what do you mean and you know so he<br>kept having people walking through his<br>house and walking through his fence or<br>like knock his fence down and it took<br>him a little while to get it um but I<br>thought that was quite a nice thing to<br>carry through into this um park because<br>it reminds you of actually where you are<br>in the world and um the history of this<br>fua um here's some more photos this was<br>this<br>morning um yeah<br>and that's um oh and there are native<br>plant selections and so on which is<br>nice um yeah and there's subes um oh<br>yeah what I wanted to say about this one<br>is um so you can see in the background<br>there's like the water Funk front<br>precinct which is like it's kind of a<br>neocolonial development which is meant<br>to look older than it is but it was<br>actually built in the '90s um which is<br>why I really don't like it but also at<br>that time um Marty was specifically<br>excluded the council um wouldn't allow<br>us to have a presence there and so that<br>was part of why our Hau decided to set<br>up hia which many of you might be<br>familiar with which is the um mtic<br>Cultural Center um it took a long time<br>toing he said oh you know it was all<br>your it was like my great uncles and<br>stuff it was like you know all of your<br>comato of that time and he can name them<br>to any any of us who are alive now um<br>like for me was my uncle bin and charie<br>but he's like I was just a young fellow<br>then and then sudden I look around and<br>I'm the last one standing so he's like<br>held this coopa all this time for his<br>old people and it's you know it's only<br>been operational I don't know when it<br>opened maybe 8 years ago or something<br>it's not not been around that long<br>anyway but that was such a treasure<br>dream because this Waterfront area was<br>developed as this important sort of<br>public space and yet we were just<br>completely excluded from it um so no<br>love lost if those buildings come<br>down uh cool so this one is<br>toah Fang Civic Center and so this is<br>the next step of collaboration in my<br>little little sliding spectrum and so we<br>worked with Team Avery Architects on<br>this they were the they were the<br>Architects on the project uh krie Avery<br>was really fabulous to work with and we<br>also worked with literalist who were the<br>Landscape Architects local firm and<br>really we were brought in to support the<br>integration of the Habu cural narrative<br>and to ensure that our Tonga was kind of<br>meaningfully reflected in the design and<br>the it did carry through the whole<br>building and was considered through the<br>whole building particularly around<br>tikanga requirements and some of the<br>themes on upper levels that are used for<br>wayfinding relate to the wider cultural<br>landscape and there's stunning views up<br>there um actually the meeting before I<br>get on you know what I'll just take a<br>little journey um my meeting I had just<br>before I drove got in the car and drove<br>down here we were in a meeting room um<br>upstairs and it was amazing that because<br>of the view we could really easily talk<br>about different parts of the project<br>that we were working on so it's an Urban<br>Design scheme that we're working on um<br>and it's for an area they're calling the<br>knowledge Precinct and they were saying<br>okay yeah so that's that and someone<br>so's working on this and if you just<br>look to your left oh sorry that's that<br>to your left and that was actually<br>really amazing to be able to have that<br>Viewpoint and to in real time be kind of<br>talking to the project area that we're<br>now it was a kickoff meeting so we're<br>about to start a really interesting<br>project in this area uh but the main<br>thing around this building is really<br>this large art space so there's a really<br>large welcoming area um there's this big<br>kind of double height Mah that's quite<br>um I'd say imposing but welcoming at the<br>same time it really has a strong sense<br>of presence and um there's like quite<br>clear delineation with the paving and so<br>on um and the two part well again we<br>lightly touched over everything um but<br>two of the bits that we had really that<br>we did the design work for and had a<br>really strong influence on were this<br>Compass here um and this Compass this uh<br>K Fu on the paving in the middle that<br>refers to all of those important<br>cultural landscape Larks so there's um<br>Uka which is a par there's P Thai which<br>is another P it's kind of nestled at the<br>bottom of the Western Hills uh pohoy<br>which is up on the hill where the St<br>Andrews Church or or hope Fang day<br>Presbyterian now py Haka the Monga I've<br>talked about a lot Mania which I've<br>talked about a lot T which is another<br>par and so these all point to the<br>correct kind of compass Direction uh for<br>those different landmarks um something<br>really nice about this too is that<br>there's a little laneway that runs<br>alongside the building and there's a new<br>bridge that's being put in that's under<br>construction at the moment it's called<br>Lovers Lane and I'm sure it'll get a new<br>other name um but that is actually also<br>the pathway that went from poho PA to um<br>to tooa so it's like a direct line and<br>it's really nice to be able to I guess<br>walk in the um top of white the<br>footsteps of our tuper and really be<br>able to visually see and understand<br>those connections between the par sites<br>and have them kind of made real for us<br>again um and also why this is a star<br>Compass is because the other big um<br>intervention in this one of the other<br>big interventions in this space is also<br>this fence along the edge um oh I<br>already talked about Twi tah a lot so I<br>probably don't need to keep talking<br>about him cuz I was like thinking<br>probably a lot of people don't know who<br>is tiah<br>kaah but it is the name that's been<br>gifted for the building um and the<br>reason is that he was a really important<br>uh trer um but I also think that they<br>wanted to emphasize that idea of um<br>Kanga and and all kind of being in this<br>together um so it's nice to have his<br>name revitalized but then we must ask<br>ourselves who isah and um really<br>understand that fak connection um yeah<br>there's the there's the patent on the<br>underside of the<br>Sait uh and there's this fence now the<br>fence the silhouette is actually the<br>Monga it's the Western Hills but what is<br>really neat about it<br>is that oh it's the last slide isn't it<br>sorry I'm just flicking through and<br>there was also some um cord or around<br>marai that had been in the area<br>previously um and just trying to<br>recognize that in some way which was a<br>bit of a challenge cuz we were trying to<br>balance um how tapoo is this AR space<br>like it's not a mid ey but then what is<br>allowed on there as symbols to do with<br>food inappropriate and so the comar had<br>quite a robust discussion about what<br>that would entail and where that would<br>land um anyway I need to get to my last<br>slide oh no I'm inside oh look I'll get<br>back to<br>it um and there was some other ficado<br>around Riverwoods and uh like and a<br>connection<br>locally and this is where I wanted a big<br>carving to be but we didn't get one and<br>this is the slide I was trying to get to<br>um so this um amazing pattern where it's<br>lit up at night they each refer to<br>different constellations that are of<br>significance and so with that and the um<br>K FSU it's tying kind of Fina to K kangi<br>and it's drawing that connection between<br>stars and star navigation as well as<br>understanding where we are on land and<br>our physical connections to our cultural<br>landscape so it's very stunning lit up<br>at night and um I think you know<br>sometimes I think when we do big<br>projects like we only have kind of a<br>little role in the scheme of things but<br>I do recognize that um for a lot of<br>these kind of projects if we weren't<br>involved we wouldn't even have really<br>any of this cultural expression and what<br>makes it really feel worth it is when<br>our hu talk about these spaces and how<br>they feel about them and how they make<br>them feel and so um I have to be<br>reminded that um you know oh I'm<br>paraphrasing but you know that thing<br>where you know like there's no there's<br>no small parts only small actors um and<br>so I think architecture is a bit like<br>that cuzz it's so intensely<br>collaborative and I know we kind of get<br>raised up on this like startic mentality<br>but the reality is it's always a big big<br>team with lots of players and it's never<br>a single author even if you're kind of<br>the Project Lead and so sometimes we<br>just have to kind of rid ourselves of<br>those Illusions and you know accept<br>accept what comes with an intensely<br>collaborative process which is what<br>architecture always is um and the flip<br>side of that which is why I keep<br>thinking of that little paraphrased<br>version of a quote is also cuz sometimes<br>you do really small jobs but they're so<br>trans format of people's lives and you<br>go well this is never going to be a<br>magazine but the person or the people<br>who use this space and whose space it is<br>they love it it's changed their lives<br>for the be um I was thinking cuz we're<br>doing like a little extension project<br>for Kung and I'm like when we went there<br>and they talked about what they needed<br>and why and you know what difference it<br>was going to make to them I'm like I<br>just can't wait to be able to deliver<br>this for them actually cuz that's the<br>kind of thing that changes people's<br>lives so ah architecture we all love it<br>don't we yeah and there's um there's tah<br>from a distance and um oh yeah I'm going<br>right for time I was like how long have<br>I been talking about the history of f<br>day uh cool so I'm going to take a sip<br>of<br>water um great okay so this<br>project well I just really marked up a<br>map from one project with another little<br>box but um we've had kind of the fortune<br>of working on a couple of projects that<br>are in really close proximity and this<br>section is really interesting because<br>there's<br>F on one corner then there's Dairy house<br>which um is you know an existing<br>building but it's been renovated and<br>given a new life and so there's all<br>these new kind of commercial tendencies<br>in it um we've only worked on one of<br>them um but it's I think that it's quite<br>significant because of that kind of<br>visual connection and the place that<br>it's located in and then we've also<br>worked on another project that's on that<br>street corner<br>um and of ptery Avenue and portal Street<br>and it's you can see it's a bit of a<br>concrete jungle there's a lot of<br>concrete and at a bit of green um so<br>it's been kind of an interesting<br>experience to try to make these spaces<br>feel more grounded and connected within<br>the environment when they're in this<br>little pocket of<br>concrete um so I'm just these are just<br>some photos from the intersection um so<br>this is looking up towards P Haka um<br>this is looking you know down the road<br>Ro and you can see bedser<br>us which is the last corner to conquer<br>um and you can see their<br>F on one corner and then up above beds<br>us is actually a set of units I don't<br>know if they're still crying order they<br>were formerly crying order has you and<br>may still be but what I wanted to say<br>about those is that my auntie Sophie um<br>used to live in one of those and she was<br>a k down<br>but also at all of the M around town um<br>and she died when I was 11 so I you know<br>didn't know her that well I knew her as<br>a child know knows a old Elder in the<br>family but she was a really amazing<br>knowledge holder and really well<br>respected in Fang and so when I go to<br>any of the M around town her her photo<br>hangs in all of them and one it's really<br>helpful cuz I can just say you know<br>that's my auntie and you know where I'm<br>from um but also it makes me feel really<br>um proud of that that connection and<br>that relationship um you know that she<br>was so loved and respected all those<br>places that even the ones that we're not<br>directly descendants of they hang her<br>photo in that M because she was<br>important to them and so it's his handy<br>too if you K ker live just up the hill<br>in in the flat U and then this is the<br>other view towards the Western<br>Hills and again you can see it's quite<br>an industrial area um the M almost feels<br>the odds being in this location it's got<br>a little short art here and you know<br>it's a busy road and it's kind of noisy<br>and there's lots of industrial things<br>um so the name of<br>the but the name of the f is Kaka<br>pwi um oh and I wanted to say something<br>about these carvings and I really hope<br>I'm not getting the order wrong up the<br>top but um the one down the bottom<br>that's toti um and so he came in oh I<br>always get this wrong oh I think he came<br>in with pahad Ki and and was so with um<br>but he was also<br>where gets their name so they're the one<br>of the other main hoer interests in F<br>who I also upu and um what I can't<br>remember so I don't know why I'm saying<br>it out loud I could have just pretended<br>like I knew what I was saying but<br>basically I I don't think it's just that<br>they have a direct line of descent from<br>him although they may as well I think<br>it's that they specifically came into<br>farang under the protection of toong so<br>there's more of a story to tell but he<br>toong is an important ancestor and then<br>you go up and you can see that there's<br>two there's a there's a face and then<br>there's a figure and I think that the<br>face is Manaya and that the figure is<br>tahi but I might have it the wrong way<br>around but that's that's the order I<br>think it's in um and so you know I don't<br>know all the tup on this F but all of<br>them are really critical<br>T because this F actually it's pan<br>tribal for<br>for so k um he came from here so he was<br>from<br>Titi and then um he established his K<br>further up North and then um through I<br>think Frank Mena who was a member of<br>parliament who was like a buddy of his<br>he bought this land and he B his Timber<br>down from his ker and he built a FY that<br>was for the community and um so you know<br>he was he was well known he established<br>a FY on this this site and after he<br>passed away way EDI proper was<br>established on this site uh he was a<br>great innovator he bought in the telep<br>phone line um like in the back blocks<br>there was like up to 150 people on that<br>line at one point I think it was what<br>they called a party line um he also<br>established an early banking system and<br>so because of um he had all these<br>workers and they had a pay system and I<br>don't quite know the details but<br>basically it became an early form of a<br>banking system so we did all these like<br>really out there you know he ran for<br>Parliament didn't get in but did all<br>these really astounding things and and I<br>think it was probably after his death<br>cuz it' be a bit weird if it was before<br>but the street Nam PTO and and Kaa<br>Street in PTO a they were named after<br>him um you know after he had passed on<br>but by all accounts that wasn't even his<br>birth name it was like a name he gave<br>himself cuz P PN means Province it's<br>like just like a transliteration I don't<br>know what the car car relates to so I'm<br>sure the um powin Foo have got some<br>great stories to tell about him but<br>that's a little bit I know um there was<br>a really cool biography or little story<br>about it that P wrote and that's where I<br>learned a lot of that and also cuz one<br>year he won like a post humous like<br>Chamber of Commerce kind of award anyway<br>I was there at the ceremony and someone<br>got up and told these Amazing Stories<br>I'm like wow he's so interesting I<br>didn't know him except for the the m i<br>was named after him so it's actually so<br>cool hearing those stories and there's a<br>fabulous portrait of him that hangs in<br>the fdy okay but you can also see the<br>art is really short and you have to kind<br>of go at a funny angle so it's like<br>there's some sorry this is probably the<br>design brain but I'm like there's some<br>problems I would plan it differently um<br>and yeah so that's that's our pen tribal<br>but very f<br>m and there's da house that's been kind<br>of jazzed up and how now has new offices<br>in it um anyway so we're going to go<br>across the road um sorry to Kitty and<br>Chris who aren't here um because now<br>they're in my little walking tour um but<br>that morning we did go across the road<br>and had another look at the Radiology<br>clinic and so the Radiology Clinic um<br>Oakland Radiology Group is you know<br>obviously based in Oakland but they<br>opened up a clinic in far<br>and um they already had an architect<br>involved which was um AJ AJ Sutton at Ma<br>studio and his team and um really they<br>just wanted us to provide support around<br>the design of the front of house area<br>and their brief was they wanted a space<br>that was going to be welcoming for Marty<br>patients so that they felt comfortable<br>and safe and actually wanted to be there<br>cuz there's a real problem that people<br>just don't come or they won't make their<br>appointments um a lot of people won't go<br>because it's too far away it was all if<br>it's all the way in Oakland and they<br>live in kikle here it's really a big<br>barrier um but beyond that also people<br>just feel alienated and uncomfortable<br>and it doesn't feel like a safe place<br>for them um so we tried to you know one<br>meet that brief try to make it welcoming<br>for m f m patients and so they use the<br>service but also tried to you know in a<br>in a in a gentle way refer to our<br>cultural landscape and and provide those<br>connections um oh yeah there's view back<br>to the I I'm going in the door um and<br>actually sorry I should say that morning<br>when we had the opening um this opened<br>actually in January but Chris hadn't<br>been up been up to set cuz he's based in<br>Tamaki um but he's our our guy that<br>spends a lot of time on the drawings and<br>so he's been in the weeds thinking about<br>these two projects for a long time<br>especially the MB one but he hadn't<br>actually been in them so it's I know<br>that's always a surreal experience where<br>you've been living in the 3D model and<br>then you actually get to be inside the<br>building like oh wow oh it turned out<br>like this oh this is great and so um it<br>was really special to have him up cuz I<br>do recognize I get to traes around<br>around here then There and Everywhere um<br>and Chris spends a lot of time crafting<br>very accurate drawings for us and doing<br>a beautiful job um and we love him for<br>that um oh and I should me to Kitty now<br>now I feel like I'm just singling out<br>Chris Kitt's also fabulous but she's<br>more of a project architect so she'll do<br>a lot of early concept work client<br>engagement stuff with me do a lot we'll<br>do a lot of the concept work together we<br>kind of split it between us and um you<br>know then she'll kind of support the<br>rest of the team to get the document a<br>going um cool so there's inside um when<br>we at the opening the furniture wasn't<br>in yet um but what you can see from here<br>is that we included a social kitchen and<br>the idea is that if large groups came in<br>especially farno there's a space where<br>you can gather you can make a cup of tea<br>there's some Kai if you need it and<br>there's also a funo room which is beyond<br>there that can be open and available to<br>everyone but if you need to you can<br>close it down and it can be a private<br>space for Foo together together um<br>anyone who's been well if you're M and<br>you've been to hospital with farno or<br>even the clinic but especially Hospital<br>there's large numbers of you and there's<br>nowhere for you to go and it's always<br>really tricky to navigate in those<br>Health spaces and you just kind of make<br>do and you take turns and you break all<br>the rules around how many people are<br>allowed to be in the room um and I think<br>hospitals are starting to change in<br>response to that I get the requirements<br>are still really tight and we've been<br>working on some projects at F day<br>hospital and you kind of get the final<br>room in and you get this generous space<br>and then it kind of gets squeezed down<br>again and and you kind of try and fight<br>for more space again and it's it's like<br>it's It's Tricky but I do think that we<br>do need to change how we design our<br>health spaces noting that there's lots<br>of complex technical requirements they<br>still need to be spaces that work for<br>people um and I don't think the complex<br>technical requirements um should Trump<br>spaces that actually you know meet<br>people's needs and that includes people<br>in the Faro they bring not just<br>individuals there to receive treatment<br>or a service um so we I mean we didn't<br>do any of the big medical bits that out<br>the back and actually I think for the<br>architect they received a sketch from<br>the client and a lot of the things were<br>set in terms of certain Machinery needs<br>to take this space and be adjacent that<br>and so on um not to say that they didn't<br>have any ability to influence that but<br>the the client was quite clear on the<br>requirements where we got a bit more<br>freedom in the front of house space we<br>just like okay we'll just open that<br>right up and we'll make it welcoming for<br>fno um there's a waiting area make it<br>feel less like a waiting room even<br>though it is um there's the front desk<br>lots of lovely Timber<br>lots of Blues and greens again um this<br>is a like a feature wall that we did<br>with aex and and some aeton um so I<br>guess we were the artists on this one um<br>and I and it was Ali May tala who<br>doesn't work with us anymore she's with<br>the museum now but um aliia May LED this<br>piece of work so I wanted to acknowledge<br>her and um you can see man I in there<br>love oura um yeah more of the F no<br>waiting space um this is a Subway so<br>they were little Subway so we tried to<br>kind of color code them and have a bit<br>of a wayf finding system that made sense<br>and wasn't too tricky to get around um<br>another<br>Subway um and we called them first thing<br>in the morning so n was in there so they<br>were happy for us to take photos and I<br>didn't take a photo of them cuz they<br>stepped out of the out of frame but um<br>also there was um people there at the<br>front desk and they seem to really love<br>working there and like I know everyone<br>wants post occupancy evaluations and no<br>one will pay for them but it's nice<br>going and saying Hey how do you like<br>your building you know what doesn't work<br>it's okay you can tell me I'm not on the<br>job now um and usually it's it's really<br>gratifying because people are usually<br>quite honest they'll tell you the things<br>they love and also maybe the things that<br>don't work so take note of them too um<br>and you can see again a strong<br>connection<br>to um and then there's the beds us that<br>I I hope gets redeveloped and I hope<br>we're on the project cuz then we can you<br>know complete the corner um and have<br>that connection and I think that I<br>actually really thought I could talk for<br>a whole hour but I seem to have finished<br>and it's only 7:30 how good is that so<br>um Koto thanks for listening to my cour<br>at um so you okay for some questions<br>yeah go for it um so I I've got one to<br>start with um uh<br>world's<br>um government<br>changed a lot in the last 68 months um<br>but your work is on a much longer AR<br>than that is it getting<br>easier like do you mean in terms of<br>being able to do this kind of work yeah<br>like is there more acceptance of the of<br>that this is necessary this is<br>beneficial I I do think so um I know<br>that it's easy to kind of think<br>shortterm and think oh my goodness well<br>some of the policies and legislative<br>changes feel a little regressive oh no<br>they don't like mildy things whatever<br>but I do think that I might eat my words<br>but right now I think this is a bit of a<br>blip and you know it's just a political<br>swing but I do think the general<br>trajectory of progress is will hold firm<br>H because I think the um expectation and<br>the precedent been set quite strongly<br>and also for a lot of staff that work in<br>government departments who might be<br>client Representatives or might be<br>managing development processes or<br>procurement and figuring out what the<br>scope is they might have done a whole<br>bunch of projects where this focus is<br>just business as usual for them now and<br>Architects including the big firms and<br>also some of the big engineering firms<br>they've probably done quite a lot of<br>these projects and sure it's a continual<br>journey and not everyone's in the same<br>place yet but because so many people<br>have been exposed to this way of working<br>they're going to show up and be like so<br>oh obviously we're going to work with<br>the hu or work with the E depending on<br>where you you know like they'll bring<br>those assumptions and questions and<br>challenges to their client or the client<br>representative will take that to their<br>senior leadership and be expecting it so<br>I think it's a bit hard to undo but<br>again I could eat my words<br>yeah are there any other questions from<br>the<br>house um you mentioned<br>that<br>about yeah if you guys got the<br>opportunity to design something you um<br>to add to that identity you know what<br>would that Dre project be yeah um tribal<br>Parliament I don't know something like<br>something political and um really<br>reasserting that identity cuz I I know I<br>talked a lot about Fang but like<br>something about Fang is that um most of<br>the town area is owned by like five<br>families and most of those are um<br>Colonial descendants and the streets are<br>named after those original Colonial<br>people that are there to<br>and that hasn't changed so and it's an<br>old boys club of town actually it's like<br>quite a lot of political Powers<br>concentrated in a small number of people<br>and they're all you know friends who<br>like handshake agreements and God I hope<br>none of them in the room when I just<br>said that I didn't see any but really<br>that's that's how far day is run<br>actually and so that can be a bit of a a<br>barrier but um you know and we don't<br>have hardly any land left so I think<br>something that is quite a strong<br>assertion of identity uh that also is<br>something that has political status and<br>and man a bit like that Civic Center<br>really which is great but maybe<br>somewhere that isn't associated with the<br>colonial form of governance which is<br>what I would consider local government<br>to still be not saying it has to be its<br>future but I think it's its present and<br>question there's a sort of obvious um<br>question of where to next you know<br>um I wonder if we're not ous enough as<br>arits or Vision enough and I wonder you<br>want to share your Ambitions Visions are<br>your future oh yes I mean honestly I<br>want to see our land returned and I want<br>to see um our Hau e and Hau depending on<br>the area but if I'm thinking of f we're<br>very Hau Centric I'd love to see our<br>land return but with genuine partnership<br>and resources from government agencies<br>who've held that power and held those<br>resources to be able to hand over some<br>power and resources so that we can<br>actually transform that environment in a<br>way that kind of serves us all there's<br>no point giving our ho back land right<br>now we've got no resources to do<br>anything with it and so I do think there<br>needs one something I've been advocating<br>for which I don't know if it's going to<br>go anywhere but I've heard our ho have<br>had some good conversations with them<br>this is with K order so who knows what<br>their future is anyway um they've had<br>some really good conversations with our<br>hu where our hu is trying to argue for a<br>model where they do the development in<br>Partnership and then um King order<br>Returns the land but also provides like<br>um you know like a suspensory loan or<br>something anyway but Returns the loan<br>through some kind of mechanism and then<br>pays the rent that enables the H to pay<br>off that loan with the goal of<br>eventually owning it but also you're<br>getting a developed asset and ongoing<br>resources as opposed to a piece of land<br>that you might not be able to do<br>anything worth CU you got no money um<br>anyway without getting in the weeds<br>around tenure and like treaty law and<br>systems and you know I do think that we<br>need to have our have manaa being in<br>control of of these projects a lot more<br>cuz what I see actually on some of these<br>complex jobs that we've worked on<br>there's probably more than that but at<br>least two axes of power and there's a<br>real tension between our hoppu who we<br>think of as our real bosses and the<br>paying client which is a government<br>agency that might kind of agree to hand<br>overpower but then maybe Personnel<br>change and it PS this way or maybe they<br>are happy with handing over power until<br>it's a decision they don't like and then<br>they take it back and there's a little<br>bit of a seesaw and a little bit of a<br>power struggle um and sometimes it<br>starts really great and then someone<br>changes and the next person's got a<br>different attitude and it's amazing how<br>quickly you think a what is a robust<br>Arrangement can kind of erode and then<br>you know I might be shooting myself in<br>the foot saying this but I do think um<br>because on these big projects naturally<br>we work with bigger firms right we're<br>we're not equipped we don't have the<br>track work record to be doing these<br>really really big complex projects it's<br>our Hy that of us just to be in the<br>space but there's naturally a power<br>imbalance cuz we're a tiny tiny player<br>and we'll be working with a big big<br>company and it it is tricky to even that<br>out and we've worked with Partners<br>who've really tried but I just there is<br>an inherent power imbalance and so I've<br>often find it's like this shaped seesaw<br>and it makes these projects you get to<br>the end and you forget how hard it was<br>and you're like oh what a great outcome<br>everyone loves it but while it's<br>happening I go oh my God can't I just be<br>can't we just be the architect for M and<br>papa K it's like such an easier ride um<br>but then I'm reminded that we have a<br>duty to do it so um I don't know if that<br>answered the question I probably the<br>summary land back Hau have more control<br>then we might actually get to see more<br>ambitious Visions for our future and I<br>think we can see it with Nati fat for<br>example in Tamaki what happens when when<br>manaa have a bit more control and<br>resource we're starting to see some big<br>transformation as a result so yeah so<br>has there not being a treaty settlement<br>oh no okay that's a whole another story<br>so we got three overlapping mandates in<br>farang day which is<br>which causes all sorts of challenges but<br>actually as we are even though bits of<br>those here we might have settled we're<br>unsettled as F day and we're really just<br>a sort of Rogue band of Hau got no<br>formal structures nothing like<br>that and we might not anytime soon even<br>though they're trying to crack that nut<br>because the big thing for napi or at<br>least parts of napi and definitely Fang<br>is that the government has never signed<br>an agreement without a final settlement<br>clause in it and so our interpretation<br>of it it is they might say in our wangi<br>tribunal finding for the stage one<br>report oh you didn't sign you didn't SI<br>your sovereignty in 1840 but you've<br>signed it in 2024 when you signed this<br>agreement and so um you know our best<br>legal interpretations have been that<br>that would be the case unless they<br>remove the final settlement clause which<br>do<br>K do you have any advice for like<br>talking about Ambitions in the future do<br>you have any advice for students and how<br>we go about like what what should we be<br>asking our teachers and Educators for if<br>we want to become equipped become<br>approach like um I mean obviously<br>advocating for yourself is good but um<br>something that is coming is that we get<br>our competency standards from Australia<br>and the 2021 standards which are the<br>latest Fusion have some really important<br>competency standards around uh working<br>with indigenous communities and cultural<br>Concepts and there's a process at the<br>moment that's underway to develop an<br>addendum and to formally adopt those<br>here um and at the moment it says AB<br>original and straight Islander so and<br>Country so those words aren't going to<br>fly but I think it there's a deeper dive<br>into what that actually means for this<br>context before it's never been a problem<br>just to take them wholesale because<br>there's been no difference but now that<br>that exists um it's kind of pushing<br>change here which I think is already<br>happening but I think this is going to<br>push it in other parts where it's maybe<br>not happening and for anyone who doesn't<br>know those competency standards relate<br>to initial registration ongoing<br>registration but also um accredit<br>accredited schools of architecture and<br>what they teach so all of the schools<br>are going to have to be able to<br>competently offer that um so I don't<br>know if that doesn't really tell you<br>what you can do but it's coming and they<br>to<br>our yeah awesome question um so T<br>principles um they came about I don't<br>know out of well 20 2006 kind of onwards<br>2006 was T strategy which was at T M<br>flaxmere and then over the kind of years<br>that followed there was collaboration<br>between some of our leading Art Hall<br>members including Ro Hoskins and manaen<br>and Tamaki to develop this set of<br>principles which are really an attempt<br>to make translation of cultural ideas<br>tangible in the built environment cuz<br>we'd had a go before but it was always<br>like way to a Tong and people like what<br>does that mean how do I make it into a<br>built thing and so um a really practical<br>step but to me the principles have<br>always sat within a methodology and the<br>methodology is the really transferable<br>thing um so the work we be doing in far<br>uho have developed their own set of<br>principles T have developed their own<br>set of principles and we engage a t type<br>methodology with them but using their<br>own set of priorities which was always<br>the intention so it's totally scalable<br>and you don't even have to follow that<br>methodology but it's really adaptive and<br>it's meant to be flexible so you could<br>country k um why do you teach and what<br>does that add to<br>your yeah okay so what I'm doing at the<br>moment is that I'm developing an<br>architectural dictionary in C maldi and<br>then with the intention of running a<br>taught Masters program in C Mari like in<br>roio and what I want to do with that is<br>attract uh Carvers Weavers uh painters<br>Marty artists who already speak to and<br>have this base knowledge around M Mar<br>and then I want to bring them into my<br>program and then we're going to give<br>them these tools of the architect that<br>they maybe didn't have before and then<br>Elevate their status in that way and<br>then send them back to their communities<br>and we already have people who operate<br>that way and um I hope neither in the<br>room no they won't mind be saying it um<br>um like Graham t or rer they're both<br>trained as Kai for kaid but they're<br>really um have this status um a similar<br>status to architects in terms of design<br>lead across a number of things that they<br>do without formally being archtics will<br>recognize as such so that's what I'm<br>trying to do and aut which again I'm<br>sorry um Oakland un is also doing great<br>things and I've got some wonderful<br>colleagues here but the reason I went<br>there was because um they had set the<br>program up to have a regenerative design<br>and Indigenous focus and they seemed<br>really Keen to Resource my goals and<br>aspirations that were aligned with it so<br>I was like okay great and I work really<br>well that way if I've got like a hyper<br>ambitious idea and someone just goes oh<br>go for it I won't get I won't get in<br>your way and then I can just do it um so<br>love that for me um so that's the plan<br>that's what I'm working on I am teaching<br>just in the kind of I'm calling it The<br>mainstream program which isn't fair<br>really because actually it's really<br>Progressive but is taught in English is<br>really what I mean um and what I'm<br>trying to do I guess is<br>like like I'm a baby academic I'm like<br>you know I'm not even a proper academic<br>really so I really like to know how it<br>works first before I launch my program<br>and so I'm really trying to support our<br>students in line with our thinking of<br>you know indigenous Focus regenerative<br>focus and sharing what I've learned so<br>far in a really live way because I'll go<br>into these programs and I'll be like<br>cool this happened to me this week let's<br>talk about it and here's something I<br>learned yesterday and so sometimes I'm<br>learning along with them and it's a<br>really active line of inquiry that<br>aligns with our practice work so I think<br>that um interchange dialogue between uh<br>practice and teaching it can be a really<br>really fruitful space and the the of<br>traveling between two places is very<br>annoying but the teaching has been</p></main><footer style="margin-top: 2rem; background: #0001; padding: 2rem; text-align: center;"><p>We Are The
