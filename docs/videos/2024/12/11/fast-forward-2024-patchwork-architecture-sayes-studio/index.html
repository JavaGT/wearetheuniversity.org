They have rapidly developed a reputation for crafting modest materials into innovative spaces. Their first project, produced with Tim Gittos and called ‘DogBox’, was a finalist in Home magazine’s Home of the Year award in 2013. Their Kahutara House, and 10x10 have received New Zealand Institute of Architects National Awards, while Party Wall was recognised with the Institute’s prestigious Sir Ian Athfield Award for Housing.<br><br>Sayes Studio is an Auckland-based architecture practice specialising in residential projects. Led by Henri Sayes, the practice has become known for its ability to develop unpretentious briefs and constrained settings into sculptural forms and light-filled spaces. Founded in 2016, Sayes Studio has received New Zealand Institute of Architect’s National Awards twice—for Sawtooth Apartment and Brick House. The firm’s projects have been widely published in local and international media.<br>-</p><h2>Transcript</h2><p style="opacity: 0.9; font-size: 0.8em">Transcripts may be automatically generated and may

to this the last of the Fast<br>Forward lectures uh for 2024 um just to<br>start with a little bit of housekeeping<br>um if you need bathrooms through the<br>door over there over that side of the<br>lecture theater in the event and the<br>unlikely event unlikely event of an<br>emergency our assembly is out on um<br>Simon Street uh if you need see PD<br>points you'll see couple of spots around<br>the lecture theater as a kind of QR code<br>if you go and use that um code you'll<br>find yourself um at a spot where you can<br>secure CPD points for this<br>event uh one of the key things for me to<br>do is to thank jib um jib are kind a<br>massive uh sponsor the key sponsor of<br>this lecture series have been for many<br>many years uh we're really grateful to<br>um for what they do for the school um we<br>couldn't do lots of the things that are<br>the most fun to do without their support<br>so what I'm going to do is show you a<br>video about their<br>was<br>thank you<br>excellent so thank you to thank you to<br>jib Mark Gillum from jib is here tonight<br>if you've um if that's prompt reminded<br>you of some urgent jib specifying<br>question that you've got about fixing<br>patterns or fire rating I'm grab Mark<br>and he'll be able to square you away<br>look at he split<br>um one of the um the very fun things<br>that I get to do at the school is I<br>teach the um contemporary architecture<br>part of the history and Theory section<br>of the of the architecture program and<br>one of the things that's really<br>interesting to me is um the kinds of<br>things that the students are interested<br>in um and one of the things is um uh<br>about the age of The Architects that<br>they're interested in and so they're<br>often kind of putting a lot of energy<br>into studying folks that are kind of old<br>so Frank giri for example is<br>95 you know Rim callus is going to be 80<br>in a in a couple of months and so one of<br>the things that I say to the students I<br>really implore them to spend some time<br>looking at younger you know so the<br>archtics doing work um that Springs an<br>ideas Springs out of ideas and springs<br>out of concerns that are closer to their<br>generation and that's a little bit<br>symptomatic I think of a kind of wider<br>problem um in the profession that of<br>giving younger Architects um venues<br>where they can share their ideas and um<br>present their work and so that was the<br>impetus behind this particular section<br>which is a a double feature of um two<br>young architecture practices so we're<br>going to start with Henry SE of SE<br>Studio give the briefest possible<br>introduction so we can jump on to<br>hearing about his work um but um has won<br>a couple of national awards in the in<br>the last few years um and I think is now<br>developed a portfolio of really lovely<br>um houses um they're not expensive<br>they're not um using um uh Lush<br>materials um there's not um uh um kind<br>of concern for INT intricate kind of<br>elaborate craft but just I think it's an<br>architecture of care so producing kind<br>of beautifully resolved architecture<br>that is full of care so on that note I<br>wonder if you would join me in welcoming<br>Henry<br>S great um well thank you for having me<br>here today um as a very average student<br>of the University I attended this<br>lecture series many times so it was<br>quite a surprise and a real privilege to<br>be asked to talk to Andrew and it's a<br>treat to share the stage with sine Ben<br>who run one of my favorite architecture<br>firms um I'd also like to extend a<br>special thanks to jib where my wife<br>Nicole worked for four years um so in<br>addition to providing discounted product<br>on a few of these projects um<br>inadvertently helped finance one<br>also um<br>it's always enjoyable to be asked to<br>speak about my work to be able to take<br>some time come up for some air before<br>Burying my head back in projects<br>tomorrow as I went through the exercise<br>of linking together the commonalities of<br>the projects three things stood out they<br>all have they're all pretty generic<br>sites some have views uh some Vistas but<br>most are very Suburban they've all taken<br>a lot of work to discover an angle and a<br>direction and typically they have modest<br>budgets which has necessitated finding<br>value in the design rather than chasing<br>an<br>aesthetic um so today I want to talk<br>about some of the common threads that<br>run through our work which is more about<br>an approach than an aesthetic our work<br>is rooted in two<br>ideas logic and liity the first response<br>to a new project is to diagram and to<br>rationalize both the constraints and the<br>expiration in architecture that's<br>usually centered around how building<br>relates to context how you circulate<br>through and bring light into the space<br>and how those spaces are expressed as<br>physical form um but before I delve into<br>the project it's probably worth how<br>worth mentioning how I work um<br>essentially I'm a sole<br>practitioner um which means I do it all<br>um I'm not just kind of passing sketches<br>on to somebody else to execute um and<br>while there's some really big<br>disadvantages like managing time frames<br>and workload um it does mean you get a<br>lot of control and oversight over every<br>detail um you'll also see I'm a big p<br>big fan of plans I use two 2D<br>AutoCAD um which yeah I'm not sure if<br>anyone else really does these days um<br>but it's really key to the pro to to my<br>process in how I design<br>buildings um so let's begin this was our<br>first house built deep in the BBS of<br>Oakland<br>it was a side hustle where I where we<br>lived in the front<br>Cottage uh out the front while designing<br>the new place out the back it had a<br>really efficient floor plan three<br>bedrooms and a bit of volume and 115<br>square m the width was based on plywood<br>sheet modules and much time was spent<br>rationalizing the project in terms of<br>material quantities waste and building<br>efficiency I still like the fact that<br>it's simple enough to reduce to a paper<br>net it was designed at a simpler time no<br>kids a lot more spare time and a very<br>tight budget as a first outing there was<br>a lot of sweating the small stuff but<br>experiment um the project excels in its<br>efficiency of plan and form essentially<br>it's a good-look barn the gable roof<br>providing a gradient of experiences<br>across its length it's a good example of<br>where the logic of the floor plan and<br>the livity of rethinking a building<br>element combined to make a compelling<br>experience in this logic of efficiency I<br>had the idea to use prefabricated<br>trusses but invert them so they work<br>structurally but also set up the<br>Triangular geometry that's expressed on<br>the exterior and exposed structurally on<br>the<br>interior um the burm was a bit of fun um<br>essentially we just had some loose soil<br>hanging around at the end of the build<br>um and designed it into like a<br>landscaping feature to separate out the<br>entry and the um and and the lawn and<br>kind of get it to tie in with the<br>house within the open plan living space<br>the trusses start to Define and separate<br>out program the bottom cord hangs<br>horizontally over the living room then<br>has a sharp uptick<br>space the architecture and structural<br>elements really start to Define these<br>key interior<br>experiences like most Architects own<br>houses it had the working title of<br>overthought and<br>underfunded so it was about picking the<br>heroes of the project and letting the<br>rest Fade Into the<br>background color does a lot of the heavy<br>lifting in terms of defining and<br>separating<br>spaces um the rooms have strong<br>connections between one another so<br>you're always borrowing space and<br>consequently have an awareness of the<br>occupation of<br>others being pre kids we happily lived<br>with um a small safety from falling<br>Hazard um you know just to Aid these<br>connections as a first Aline this<br>project was pretty much everything I'd<br>HED to achieve as an architect it w a<br>local architecture reward was published<br>locally in John Walsh and Patrick<br>Reynolds book Country House city house<br>as well as internationally in DW dwell<br>which at the time was the shelter<br>magazine of choice job<br>done um Brick House is essentially<br>version two of the previous project<br>designed a few years afterwards and<br>again a house for us<br>there are clear references in the<br>sections and elevations to the previous<br>project but this one shows a looseness<br>in plan and a new more nuanced design<br>approach and a bit more<br>Swagger the logic of the<br>project was really driven by the<br>parameters of the site it's situated on<br>a middle lot with a big house<br>overshadowing it to the North a rway on<br>the south and houses on the other edges<br>essentially it was about dealing with<br>the entry and vehicles off the RightWay<br>and how the house opens up to the north<br>to create a private outdoor space<br>essentially there kind of like two<br>blocks in this in this plan you've kind<br>of got your garage block um wanting to<br>do something and you've got your living<br>block to do something and it was really<br>just about um positioning those to kind<br>of like create um and respond to those<br>parameters oh yeah and there's an<br>upstairs three bedrooms in a bathroom um<br>once we had that<br>framework was about using using the plan<br>form and geometry to link those opposing<br>programs it's a house of two sides<br>intentionally blank to the rway with a<br>cranked brick wall Bridging the garage<br>and the living<br>programs which in turn developed the<br>geometry and using S Heights and brick<br>privacy the north elevation is a further<br>exploration into the linking of these<br>programs while providing Eaves for solar<br>regulation and cover to the doors for<br>orland's dly<br>summer it's also where the geometry<br>really sings with a folded angul of feet<br>above the bank of French doors opening<br>Courtyard I was interested in the<br>gradients of light you get when you make<br>shapes and geometries with a crisp H<br>crisp homogeneous surface like plaster<br>board this really set up the inter<br>interior design expression a sort of<br>sculptural idea it was about creating<br>surface which had Mass so there's no<br>arraes or skirtings surfaces meet in a<br>way the interior is a Counterpoint to<br>the angular<br>exteriors there's a strong motif of<br>subtle curves all which provide an<br>architectural<br>moment seiling transitions div defining<br>spaces walls directing<br>circulation spiral stairs providing<br>efficient level Transitions and<br>Landscape elements separating program<br>edges by the by the time we built Nicole<br>was at Fisher and P so we thought we'd<br>be design a kitchen to accommodate some<br>nice<br>appliances we had the idea we wanted the<br>kitchen island to disappear so a<br>mirrored surface seemed perfect I'd<br>previously Flo the idea to a client it<br>had been quickly shut<br>down like most bespoke designs you're<br>building a prototype essentially<br>building the plane when you're flying it<br>so here we learned the limitations of<br>stainless steel manufacturing and<br>polishing along the way<br>balancing weight rigidity cost and the<br>logistics of moving a 300 kg blade<br>safely the Landscaping was designed just<br>prior to occupation and reference the<br>architectural design language of the<br>Interiors a retaining brick seat to the<br>Garden Edge<br>and a curve defining<br>space the garden itself is a wild mix of<br>specimen trees and a carpet of Ivy which<br>was slowly but more recently quickly<br>consuming the<br>house um this is a house I designed for<br>my mother<br>Morin um I thought of this project as a<br>literal Twist on a bungalow it employs a<br>familiar legible gabled roof to relate<br>to its Suburban context<br>the silhouette on ENT on the entry<br>elevation is symmetrical and<br>unassuming the organizing idea was about<br>creating something that was familiar but<br>surprising the brief was pretty loose a<br>bath a t a bath a fire and a table for<br>10 the house is designed as a<br>one-bedroom apartment with some spare<br>space for visiting family the idea being<br>that the house expands as an number of<br>occupants increases but never feels too<br>large when people<br>depart being a rear site the approach is<br>on the oblique at the end of a rway<br>rather than having a pure Street<br>elevation as a response the Gable cranks<br>on the ridge to form a welcoming entry<br>and the stair extends past to give a<br>clear<br>and the ceiling flicks up to these huge<br>panels of glass that look out into the<br>garden they're completely oversized for<br>the scale of the house it's more a wall<br>of garden than a window but that's the<br>levity of the place the generosity of<br>the windows which lead your eye to The<br>above the dining room was conceived as a<br>room in the garden with Windows on three<br>sides giving a Feeling of being immersed<br>in the<br>landscape the fix glazing gives the<br>opportunity to bring planting right up<br>to the windows amplifying this<br>idea it was about letting the garden and<br>the trees outside be the focal point and<br>the main moment of color and movement in<br>the<br>space the site had a collection of large<br>established native trees conveniently<br>located around its perimeter in scale<br>and permanence in contrast with the<br>Garden as this was a house for my mom<br>one of the key goals was was was to<br>ensure it felt like her house not a<br>Magazine spread so the<br>in the Interiors have a few textural<br>elements to Anchor the spaces like the<br>Winkleman tile shelf around the fire and<br>the kitchen island reinterpreting the<br>kitchen table an oak slab mounted on an<br>intersecting steel<br>structure and bean Square provides a<br>very Democratic space to socialize<br>around and here are a few moments just<br>for one the window seat providing a<br>moment of compression in the dining<br>space and allowing a handy spot to Pro<br>to supervise the progress of dinner<br>while the bathroom Skylight gives the<br>opportunity to view the tree canopy<br>above giving an awareness of place in a<br>setting um Pete Place uh this project<br>started life as an art deco duplex in<br>point Chev when the clients came to me<br>it was just over 50 square met being a<br>duplex it had a street presence that<br>bellied its size and a notable tree in<br>the front yard to add some planning<br>complexities<br>the new plan is quite linear but uses<br>changes in ceiling height and in floor<br>level to provide a variation of space<br>across its<br>length carefully plac fenestration acts<br>to further delineate<br>function the extension terminates in a<br>deep Window Seat which pushes the<br>program to the edge and manages the<br>circulation around the sitting space<br>there was a lot of structured thinking<br>about how to extend a very insula and<br>contained Art Deco form then layering<br>the fun and energy of the clients to<br>make it work for Modern<br>Life the aim was to tease out the core<br>idea of the Heritage elements and<br>reinterpret these throughout the<br>extension the long elevation picks up on<br>the existing roof slope of the duplex<br>and terminates back from the street<br>elevation ensuring that's always<br>the extension is modern but plays off<br>the original materials the solidity of<br>the form and the composition of the<br>elevations to create a sense of<br>continuity between the new and the<br>old and again on the rear<br>elevation you can see the weight of the<br>building over the windows where we<br>keeping the idea was translated<br>throughout the Interiors like Bings on<br>the ceiling details the key to a<br>heritage project and fundamental to<br>define the tone of a project this<br>extension was designed as a riff off the<br>original reinterpreting and twisting it<br>um the construction and fit out was<br>managed by the owners in here a few<br>moments they picked up and executed to<br>Perfection of note is a junction between<br>the new and the old floors a change in<br>Direction a Chevron reference and<br>them I've been lucky to revisit this<br>project<br>recently this time with some new owners<br>where we added two new structures to the<br>site to the front yard a garage and<br>workshop which doubles as a band<br>practice room and to the rear a studio<br>space and<br>fire the clients were super fun on this<br>one which is directly reflected in the<br>outcome the garage is curvaceous and two<br>tones of pink Art Deco on steroids the<br>studio was a particularly interesting<br>exercise design exercise and has been<br>thought of in its two states of use as a<br>studio with its doors and screens in<br>various stages of openness and when the<br>screens are closed as an active Edge<br>adding amenity to the<br>Garden the outdoor fireplace is embedded<br>in the wall of the building creating a<br>space for<br>socializing it was not it was important<br>not just to place a building in the<br>backyard but ensure that it was adding<br>more reason to leave the house and<br>garden um when I turned up for this side<br>I sort of uh groaned<br>inwardly the existing structure was<br>pretty shunky there was a three-story<br>commercial building right on the<br>Northern<br>boundary and a complex subdivision<br>consent tied with the tied in with the<br>feasibility of the<br>project it seemed to have or be adjacent<br>to every planning control and the<br>unitary plan but also it was well<br>located had some great aspect out to the<br>city and the domain and most importantly<br>a client with Clear<br>Vision it's often said that good clients<br>get good good projects and this is a<br>clear<br>example solving the constraints of the<br>site became the key logic of the design<br>response there was a couple of key moves<br>firstly in plan locate entering and<br>locating the services in the middle uh<br>allowing each end of the building to<br>have aspect to the east views uh to the<br>east there's a little Courtyard and to<br>the West uh views out to the<br>domain and in section focusing on<br>bringing light in and as we couldn't get<br>any from above sorry as we couldn't get<br>any from the north it made sense to<br>bring it in from above through skylights<br>this project has a a really strong<br>dialogue between the plan and the<br>section leveraging ideas of Pro Prospect<br>and refuge and simultaneously o<br>expansion nodding to the industrial<br>neighbors the form is expressed as a<br>Sawtooth with full width skylights which<br>not only provide a great spatial quality<br>but also a lively Sky View and what's a<br>environment due to the Heritage<br>overlay the clading is weatherboards and<br>Veranda was added to the front elevation<br>referencing The Cottages down the<br>road the other way down the road just so<br>you<br>know um photo shoot is often one of the<br>highlights of a project and this one was<br>uh of the project the messiness and<br>complexity of construction has passed so<br>it becomes a day for reflection and this<br>one was magic watching the sun roll over<br>the<br>site while the project was in perfect<br>order and waiting for moments like this<br>the Interiors were heavily led by the<br>owner and are unfussy and really work to<br>play up the architecture and light<br>quality they picked up on the angular<br>design language and chased it through to<br>the smallest fitting everything in this<br>project had a point be it the Sawtooth<br>elevation the ceiling wall Junctions the<br>termination of the wing walls vanities<br>or the folded steel Island when you have<br>such good light you don't need to do all<br>um and this is a large room you have<br>this large remu house was completed a<br>few years ago but still hasn't been<br>professionally photographed it's built<br>on a sloping bank with proximity to a<br>volcanic<br>crater the diagram and plan talks about<br>stretching the length of the site and<br>maximizing the northern aspect while<br>closing down the Neighbors on the east<br>and the<br>West the long section is about adding<br>volume to the center of the plan and<br>referencing the gabled neighbors while<br>this short section is about providing<br>generous cover for solar regulation<br>while still providing Sky views through<br>clear story Windows while the decks and<br>ground planes extend to crop out the<br>houses<br>below and here's a glimpse of it 26 M<br>long a Gable cranked and folded along<br>the Apex to provide an entry to the<br>southeast it has a two-tone material<br>pallet a solid Block<br>Base and a Timber uper upper to<br>reference the older keros houses in this<br>old<br>suburb spread over three levels and 450<br>Square met of floor area there was a<br>tight logic and how you create presence<br>without losing the human scale and layer<br>on that how we added levity by<br>amplifying those more intimate moments<br>volumes as a Counterpoint to large<br>houses I found a lot of value in doing<br>small jobs they're quick have flexible<br>briefs and a great way to test ideas<br>generally they're a lot of<br>fun I think this project shows that even<br>with something as praic as a shed in a<br>Heritage Street if you're aware of<br>context you can find motifs and<br>references that can be decorative<br>decoration and that's it that's my<br>chapter one thanks for having me and<br>like everyone else I'm looking forward<br>stage thank you very much h um so it's<br>now my um pleasure to welcome Sally Ogle<br>and Ben Anan Mitchell um from Patchwork<br>architecture um another um exciting<br>young practice um emerged in the early<br>2010s with um a project called dogbox<br>which was one of the most interesting<br>kind of houses of its era that had<br>essentially been kind of DIY into<br>existence by a bunch of youngsters and<br>yet it seemed to be so kind of full of<br>energy and potential and I've since<br>established a practice that's um<br>produced a whole um stack of um<br>award-winning um beautiful houses<br>including a project that won the Ian<br>athfield named award from the<br>nzia a couple of years back so if you<br>would join me and welcoming s and<br>beam well thanks for having us um thanks<br>for invite thanks very much for inviting<br>us up Andro um it is yeah as Henry says<br>it's nice to reflect on the work<br>occasionally rather than just chipping<br>away at at all the time um we are going<br>to probably talk way too fast because<br>Andrew's already told us we've got way<br>too many slides um we're going to<br>Loosely talk about some peers of<br>projects that one a bit older one a bit<br>newer that kind of take the same idea<br>and try it out in different<br>ways cool hi I'm Bean by the way<br>um yeah we didn't prepare notes like<br>Henry so we're just going to ramble and<br>flick through about 160 pictures so<br>um no the we've been harping on about<br>this house for like the last 10 12 years<br>so sorry if you've already heard all<br>about it but it's a good starting point<br>um just it was literally the start yeah<br>starting point of our practice and it is<br>kind of um reoccurring themes and other<br>projects<br>um so the dog box was built in wongi on<br>the cheapest section available at the<br>time in the whole of New Zealand pretty<br>much and um it was started um design was<br>designed around these trusses these um<br>five trusses that were bought from a<br>Pedic and tiu for<br>$400 um they didn't look beautiful and<br>blue like that were completely rusted um<br>so This Is Us painting them in one of my<br>dad's giant sheds in wongo<br>um yeah so so we took those objects and<br>designed this house that was kind of<br>about um designing something as lovely<br>as possible but as cheaply as possible<br>so every single decision we made was<br>about cost um so hling for materials off<br>trade me and using our own labor keeping<br>the thing as small as possible and also<br>right throughout the process it was<br>every decision we had no money we were<br>graduate Architects yeah um so so is the<br>ground FL plan um so the trusses are<br>basically um we in the inside of the<br>house is inhabit inhabited half of the<br>trusses and there's a little pop out at<br>the back just to get a little bit more<br>room um and one way that one of the ways<br>we made this house smaller was by<br>putting the hallway outside um so you go<br>upstairs outside and you have this<br>lovely sunny Miranda facing west where<br>you can circulate instead of like a<br>hallway it also means that all of the<br>rooms that are upstairs can open to here<br>and sunlight um there's also a sort of<br>outdoor bath and really the upstairs<br>expands Into The<br>Veranda um upstairs PL so you can see<br>these kind of cutouts uh pushouts<br>cuttings I don't know um but yeah the<br>bath deck and midle deck Greenhouse I<br>don't think it ever got used for a<br>greenhouse more for drying laundry<br>really good for that I've been living<br>there for the last seven years so I can<br>you know test it's a really nice place<br>to live you don't get wet in a storm<br>when you're going to your<br>bedrooms<br>um so here this is um me and Sally and<br>Tim and Caroline who are now spacecraft<br>Architects doing amazing work um so we<br>built everything<br>ourselves um which was the main way we<br>saved money yeah<br>um here's from above us like learning<br>everything as we went string lining<br>profiles<br>uh we learned a lot about concrete<br>formwork um including how much Timber<br>goes into making shuttering a lot like<br>we um but also because we were so cheap<br>we redened everything put it back in a<br>stack and then use that for the walls<br>and yeah um we used manual labor for<br>everything so we had no cranes or<br>diggers or anything so this was the<br>neighbors carrying um the talized poles<br>for a box of twoes or whatever it<br>was uh we didn't have scaffolding that<br>saving um that's a crane we made out of<br>forward<br>two<br>s um so here you can see the um external<br>circulation and that's sort of half of<br>the truss extending<br>path um so I guess like you part of the<br>reason we're showing this project is cu<br>the next one is sort of well how we're<br>relating those is that it's also<br>thinking about like does every single<br>part of your house need to be insulated<br>and warm and you know could could could<br>Parts be bit outside bit covered and so<br>you know B on the logic that building<br>things that are not insulated and<br>covered is presumably cheaper and<br>therefore you can get more or better<br>quality of the other parts by doing<br>photos um so we thought we'd hit the big<br>time with us we were on the front page<br>technically on the front page of the<br>Dominion um Building a Dream for<br>$160,000 um but you might remember it as<br>legal<br>um so after this we got a whole ton of<br>inquiries about people who wanted to<br>build a house for<br>$160,000 um and we said oh no was it was<br>we was all our own labor so it's at<br>least half it's like twice that and so<br>then we got all these inquiries for<br>houses for<br>$320,000 which is the most recent one<br>was yesterday from Austin Texas asking<br>if they could borrow our plans for the<br>do box because they wanted to build a<br>there so this is a more recent and not<br>yet photographed uh project in uh in the<br>Manu I guess would call that um<br>Riverside a Riverside holiday house and<br>it expands on those ideas of creating<br>semi indoor outdoor space um having all<br>of the<br>circulation in the building outside of<br>the insulation line and by doing so<br>getting more I guess<br>um these these clients had a really<br>tight budget and A really lovely site uh<br>it's not somewhere there that's going to<br>be their permanent home so they were<br>willing to maybe try some stuff that was<br>a little bit different to what you would<br>do if you were living there<br>fulltime the this project is it's it's<br>an idea you will have seen versions of<br>this um the hill house is a New Zealand<br>more recent New Zealand one as well but<br>of building a larger<br>shed and then some pods within that with<br>the the functions of the house so in<br>this case<br>um obviously big big Square shed with<br>this deck running right through big<br>roller doors on all four sides to get<br>views Sun um ventilation and then<br>there's smaller pods with the the<br>functional bits inside it so it's a<br>total spin sheet yeah<br>but 140 M uh for 112 Grand so one of the<br>things we really wanted to do on this<br>project was not do the feeling of a<br>total span shed but have that turn<br>into complex expensive nightmare um so<br>the the project was actually built into<br>by two super contractors one being total<br>span coming in and doing their shed um<br>we did have to engage with them a little<br>bit to get that to work because sheds<br>are not<br>designed to the structural level of<br>houses and so they had to change a few<br>things but we managed to find a pretty<br>amazing guy at total span uh paliston<br>North who seemed to get the idea that we<br>were trying to do something here and uh<br>dealing with him was a real<br>Joy so he yeah he was helpful um you<br>know K to to make it work for us and so<br>the the shed went up in about 2 weeks<br>and that was that and then it was a<br>dream job for a builder to come and work<br>in a fully enclosed environment and<br>putting these so the shed's fully<br>translucent and then these pods go<br>inside with the ability to put some roof<br>decks and Tents and things on the roof<br>um Big Deck running through the middle<br>of the<br>space and it works uh it got our clients<br>a lot more Square meterage basically and<br>because it is a place they come to<br>intermittently just being able to put<br>stuff inside the shed but not inside the<br>the<br>bedroom is is actually super practical<br>for their the way that they use this<br>space cool um this is a yeah 10 by1<br>house which is a project in Wellington<br>k um so this was like we've been doing<br>we've done a few houses in Wellington<br>and um we were Keen to try a different<br>approach that didn't involve so much<br>digging into the hill um because we<br>found that it actually just costs a lot<br>of money um you know you're paying a lot<br>of money in the ground at stuff you<br>don't get to appreciate basically<br>throwing money into a literal hole in<br>the ground is not very fun um so the 10<br>by 10 is it's basically a pole house<br>which is on a crazy site it's on a<br>triangle 190 s met triangle slope like<br>this but yeah by raising the thing up on<br>poles completely we're able to have like<br>just a really rigorous grid um plan uh<br>so this is the ground floor um so the<br>thing with pole houses I think where it<br>can be quite ugly or messy is when you<br>have like just talized poles everywhere<br>and just a sea of cross bracing so we<br>were quite intentional with us and we<br>work with um Spence homes<br>uh structur Engineers to uh design the<br>foundations and one of the first things<br>that they said was if you made that<br>entry steer room out of blocks we can<br>get rid of all the cross braces and you<br>can it can be like a kind of like a<br>share core like you'd have in a<br>commercial building um so that was a<br>real win I think and it's so nice to<br>have an engineer suggest something and<br>you're like yes that's an improv massive<br>Improvement um so upstairs plan like yes<br>so uh the downstairs is a 2.7 M grid and<br>upstairs is<br>900 as we do um yeah super efficient<br>plan um one really nice thing with this<br>was it pop you pop right up into the<br>center of the plan so there's no you<br>know it's very direct into all the<br>spaces<br>um and then you can wind your way up<br>onto the roof and it's got this yeah<br>beautiful big roof deck um which you<br>know is like we had a lot of comments<br>about you know is that the most<br>practical thing in Wellington to have a<br>roof deck you only get it go up there<br>one day a year and um but you do you<br>know you can go up there at at least at<br>least two or<br>three um but one of the things we did<br>was create this little we called it the<br>bus stop on the roof a little poly cabb<br>um room so that you could have furniture<br>up there and you could put it away and a<br>barbecue and things so that it didn't<br>end up on the road on CRA the road after<br>a b souly<br>there's no consistency with any of our<br>rendering or plans so just depends who<br>does it one thing about this the 10 by<br>10 H and going for a just fully elevated<br>try not to dig at all as it's the light<br>on digging uh very heavy on complex<br>resource consenting approach to a site<br>um the you know Digger and hunker down<br>is much more compliant so it's sort of<br>you know picking your battles basically<br>and on this one we picked a resource<br>consent nightmare but it it paid off in<br>stage um so you can sort of see how you<br>know that's the road down there um<br>massive cast and citu concrete staircase<br>coming up and then these pretty elegant<br>little uh G steel legs that's the um<br>office and entry stairs that are doing<br>all the work racing wise and nice view<br>out to Evans Bay and kind of see that<br>2.7 M grid through<br>there um yeah nice photos from Simon<br>Wilson um we used we kind of made up our<br>own cling system which was a real<br>nightmare at Council but it's nothing<br>it's it's there's other systems that<br>look kind of similar but it's just<br>anodized aluminium sheet 3 mil thick<br>it's just riveted o onto the uh cavity<br>and then we've got um aluminium Batton<br>solid aluminum bons and then the windows<br>that go right up and right down it's<br>kind of nice fun um oh yeah we've been<br>so a lot we've had we've got in awards<br>for some these projects in the inway do<br>like a stuff thing and so we've been um<br>trying to record some of the<br>comments um that was for the 10 by<br>10 um yeah again pole house but you know<br>you know you it's it's all beautiful<br>Greenery under there now and you can use<br>those spaces underneath and we were<br>quite conscious to think about the<br>underside you know because you're you're<br>basically seeing this house from<br>underneath the<br>roof lots of people like it's like a<br>modern thing we've got engineers and<br>we've got anchor piles and about that<br>yeah<br>um I guess we're always also this has<br>proba be a good example of trying to get<br>functional flat outdoor space on really<br>difficult sites um is is also something<br>projects uh this was my favorite<br>uh this is uh Hass Tangi uh relatively<br>recently completed which takes some of<br>those ideas of the 10 by1 house so it's<br>a it's a pole house again um hovering<br>over uh over the<br>ground uh in this case less to avoid<br>digging and more to avoid an Overland<br>flow path on the site and actually while<br>this was under construction was when we<br>were the floods up here so our clients I<br>think felt very relieved about the the<br>sort of approach we taken to the site at<br>that<br>point uh it's also again a super<br>efficient plan we were trying to be<br>pretty light on circulation and and<br>having um just sort of creating similar<br>to the 10 by10 the sort of Central in<br>this case where the Skylight over it and<br>everything sort of opens off that uh<br>entry entry down here from the street<br>it's actually corner corner site with<br>Road on on those two<br>sides um we one of the big things with<br>this place that we had to kind of<br>convince the clients about was leaving<br>the car at the road um because the<br>site's kind of a gully and as soon as we<br>introduced a driveway into the project<br>just got really complicated so we left<br>car on the street and then we convinced<br>them that all you need is a little shed<br>because no one puts their cars in<br>garages they just fill them with stuff<br>stuff well this is our Wellington<br>perspective Maybe like everyone ining<br>with a is it's filled with tools and<br>bikes<br>Kays so this is a little shed with a<br>roller door on it that is basically half<br>of a garage um because it doesn't need<br>anymore so this is um you can see they<br>you know sort of Hing again trying to do<br>those slender steel posts and rather<br>than rather than big talized<br>poles and<br>we also wanted to try out a new clading<br>on this one so this was um qbt 450 in a<br>press<br>tin stacco OSS aluminum St emboss<br>aluminium yeah so more commonly seen on<br>your classic uh tiled door and we were a<br>little bit hesitant we we'd actually<br>done a a house in Wellington maybe a<br>couple of years before this that was<br>fully clad and and zalom roof and walls<br>and that hadn't gone so well<br>for us in the neighborhood so we're a<br>little bit nervous about trying out a<br>again but I think it works it's really<br>lovely in the with the bush around and<br>and of getting those<br>reflections of um yeah the greenery<br>around the house and it actually sits<br>really well we think and it's finished<br>that<br>oh GV pool house so um this is kind of<br>happy sad project for me um gonville<br>pool I learned to swim I went to<br>gonville Primary School just so this<br>isn't WR anyway I went to gonville<br>Primary School just around the corner<br>from here and I swim in this pool um but<br>I think this is probably happened across<br>New Zealand where lots of councils have<br>closed their public swimming pools in<br>favor of you know private indoor pools<br>and things um that's what happened in<br>wongo anyway um so the pool yeah um<br>closed down in 2006 I think um and it<br>was it they just let it go really and<br>but it was leaking apparently 20,000<br>lers of water a day or something um so<br>yeah that happened then um they put it<br>up for sale basically I think someone<br>there was talk of it being demolished<br>you know they being houses town houses<br>there or getting subdivided so um my dad<br>bought the property which is this pool<br>complex that big Hall you can see and<br>then next door over one another small<br>Hall um for I don't know some small<br>amount of money um this is what it<br>looked like in 2009 is when he bought<br>it um uh so then yeah dad had a pretty<br>horrific accident in 2015 and could no<br>longer kind of do a what he wanted to do<br>with this project so uh one of the<br>things dad had been really good at doing<br>in wongo was buying old buildings and<br>sort of passing them on to new people<br>that had a I know a different Vision or<br>you know he didn't necessarily have the<br>energy to do stuff to all the buildings<br>but he could find a good person handed<br>on and and then and then they'd go from<br>there um so yeah when me and my siblings<br>had to figure out what to do with this<br>this uh um we um we found Frank and Emma<br>so Frank Stark and Emma bugged in and<br>they said sell it to us and we'll I<br>don't know we'll build a house maybe<br>maybe we'll get petrick to do it and I<br>was like great sounds good yeah um so<br>yeah they commissioned us to design them<br>a house on the site um the brief was<br>like the shortest brief I think we've<br>ever got it was like three bedrooms<br>Patchwork language um dry woman Dr art<br>yeah space for books and art um but they<br>also had a really small budget I think<br>they said 400 or something um and the<br>site was a swimming pool yeah site yeah<br>um so yeah this was a first first crack<br>at it really was basically um let's<br>let's demo some of these changing sheds<br>that are basically falling down and then<br>create this um long rectangular building<br>that just looks into the pool uh the big<br>pool and then we'll fill half turn it<br>into an<br>orchard um keep the mediumsized pool and<br>turn that back into a pool<br>um yeah and that was that so really<br>really basic planning and I think one of<br>the the kind of things we wanted to play<br>with from the start was this idea of the<br>little pool flag trusses so steel<br>trusses um that would reference pool<br>Lane flags and so we sort of designed<br>around that and then we called all of<br>the different rooms on the plan lane<br>lane one lane two lane three<br>um and these kind of um hwk knish uh<br>renders um so the truss is you can see<br>there they're kind of more pool flaggy<br>than they ended up being the little<br>colored info they kind of also reference<br>the uh so yeah this um one of those<br>projects that just kind of was quite<br>easy really like um Frank just we<br>weren't involved and um site supervision<br>but he was just he just he just like<br>hustled it into being basally um one<br>thing I did have to do a lot of was<br>talking to the steel fabricators in<br>wongi about what the heck what are these<br>things doing cuz it looks simple and<br>then you're like oh but it goes out<br>through the wall and then there's a it's<br>now it's a window and it's also<br>refeshing and it's also you know and<br>then that happens on a corner what<br>anyway um there you go um everything was<br>super peered back because it was all<br>about cost again like Frank was like<br>what color are the trusses and I said<br>whatever color you you know I want them<br>white but you can have whatever color um<br>and he was like well they just turned up<br>zinar sprayed and it's this great silver<br>color I was like great yeah leave<br>there<br>photos I thought this was a construction<br>to add on this one yeah and they built<br>it for like 450,000 so I don't know how<br>I like yeah I think just by getting a<br>builder on charge up basically and just<br>time um they've got plans for the other<br>buildings and things so and actually the<br>yeah like the happy sad thing like it<br>was said that these are getting shut<br>down but like they're the right people<br>to take this over I think and now<br>they've got community kind of<br>aspirations for the the other buildings<br>um and I'm really looking forward to<br>seeing that the garden will grow<br>up yeah and again great back on this one<br>too I thought that I thought that was<br>actually um this is another I this is a<br>pretty loose pairing of projects this<br>one is also in moroi and it's also sort<br>of reuse of an existing<br>building um it's an old RSA theater uh<br>that has been a martial arts center it's<br>a pretty weird building to be starting<br>anything with um it's got I think zero<br>Windows yeah um and the the taller part<br>at the back there is a concrete frame<br>structure but it doesn't have any flaws<br>in it it's it's just three stories<br>of terrible seismically prone concrete<br>frame um so this is some Glass artists<br>came to us wanting to convert this into<br>their studio and their house and it's<br>quite an urban sort of you know Central<br>wo um piece of ground and so<br>there obviously some challenges with<br>just what what the existing building is<br>in terms of its you know zero natural<br>light getting in um difficult earthquake<br>stuff they wanted so the Glass artists<br>wanted to turn the front half into a<br>glass studio and the back half into a<br>house and we now quite a few iterations<br>deep on this project uh this this was<br>one of the first ones turning the the<br>front the front into their studio and<br>inhabiting that that three story frame<br>uh cutting parts of it out and obviously<br>trying to get some light and creating<br>outdoor space in in in the<br>site uh we then looked at that was too<br>expensive yeah basically all this<br>structure going into holding up a<br>concrete frame that's doing nothing it<br>was just horrendous so version two just<br>ditches that entirely um and extends the<br>Gable of the front part of the<br>building and you know again like same<br>trying to make the most of what's<br>already there keep as much as makes<br>sense<br>get some light into the middle of the<br>block and create some private Garden<br>space also too expensive um so we're I<br>guess we sort of on to scheme three<br>which is probably a bit of a change of<br>brief as um just getting rid of some of<br>the program and and just making it house<br>and not not worrying so much about the<br>studio<br>space they also dropped the bomb on me<br>that um they were they wanted to grow<br>together but they actually don't like<br>living together so can we have two<br>houses sort of with the shared<br>laundry major pivot on the Bri yeah yeah<br>and it's been I guess we think this is<br>kind of an interesting project in that<br>um the the Adaptive reuse of these kind<br>of spaces that are lying around I guess<br>maybe more in the provincial centers<br>maybe is I think massively Complicated<br>by seismic issues and the costs involved<br>in making things usable again and and I<br>think particularly when it's in somewh<br>like woi where the cost to make it work<br>is just far the construction cost in<br>Moro aren't that different to what they<br>are in Wellington and Oakland but what<br>you the value you get at the end or the<br>rent that you can get at the end is<br>wildly different and so that's why we're<br>in like version three or four five<br>million of this project trying to cost<br>save it into a place where it's actually<br>there um we've got hurry<br>on second to last um H hook Ridge this<br>was always a joke name for the project<br>because um it was like you know there's<br>a hawk up on the Ridge and we and I<br>think Simon suggested it as a name and<br>his wife said sounds like a wine sounds<br>like a wine brand like I don't want that<br>so but we're stuck stuck<br>um so we swapped uh some photos for the<br>design work of this cabinets for our<br>friend and photographer Simon Simon<br>Wilson um and yeah we were like well I<br>how how much is your how much your<br>photos worth like what's a Photoshop<br>worth anyway I said to him I don't want<br>to do like a massive full set of working<br>drawings but you can have a SketchUp<br>model and a floor plan and he said fine<br>um so<br>we made him this reasonably detailed<br>SketchUp model but so this is um the<br>unconsented schedule one sort of uh 10<br>square meters yeah each one's 10 square<br>meters<br>um and built by Simon you know who's<br>photographer not a builder so it had to<br>be really<br>simple um and I guess I started thinking<br>about this always really love those um<br>you know like when you're in a coastal<br>community and there's just someone buys<br>a section and they move like a caravan<br>onto it and then they move a ship<br>container and then they have an<br>ablutions I don't know lean to it's like<br>maybe and then probably eventually get<br>rid of all that and build a big ugly<br>batch but um like maybe that's all you<br>need I think was the sort of starting<br>point of this project so somewhere to<br>sleep somewhere to hang out and when the<br>weather's bad somewhere to hang out when<br>it's nice in the shade you know or or um<br>out of the rain and very limited<br>cooking uh and you'll see the arrows so<br>there's a composting toilet way up the<br>hill and a shower way down the Gully and<br>yeah and again trying some of those<br>similar ideas to the dog box of semi<br>outdoor indoor shelter usable space just<br>extending the footprint of what you can<br>have<br>yeah um so there it is so this um<br>scaffold pipe basically straight off the<br>shelf um G pipe um with corrugated iron<br>screwed onto it and that sits on top of<br>these little wooden boxes Simon Salvage<br>the um the doors I don't know of trade<br>me or something um yeah and built it<br>basically single-handedly on his<br>weekends like somehow for very cheap<br>um but yeah it's quite lovely so these<br>are actually David's straight photos<br>because I think maybe photographers have<br>got a weird code where they won't<br>work um and there was actually only one<br>of those trying uh Tri schol buggies<br>kids were fighting over them so hard<br>that we had to photoshop that you know<br>that's that's two it's it's a<br>compilation<br>of um yeah so the the next project is um<br>as a a version of this idea<br>um and I think s's going to explain<br>probably how like you can take a simple<br>thing like this and then make it really<br>complicated so this one beautifully like<br>went together you know scaffold pipe key<br>clamp fittings and macro carer sort of<br>overplayed rain screen we used a pond<br>liner for the roof uh the second roof<br>cuz we're like well it's never going to<br>get wet that'll be fine staple gun it to<br>the side and Mee up yeah um but other<br>than that it's very traditional you know<br>um just stick frame<br>construction it's the tiniest fire we<br>have so many inquiries about this tiny<br>fire after doing the uh job like<br>I<br>um also someone made an exact copy of<br>this in the white cutter somewhere yeah<br>and without asking actually talking<br>about on the way here that we wish we<br>had some photos of there we ended up<br>having a bit of a oops Instagram war and<br>some discussions about copyright<br>infringement with those people um which<br>was<br>disappointing um we've recently done a<br>toilet Edition not to it's it's down a<br>little um walkway but it's possibly our<br>smallest project ever yeah guess the<br>size of a sheet of plywood or something<br>but it's a a we for weing only<br>so this is the take that nice simple<br>simply executed idea and turn it<br>into a much more complicated version I<br>guess and this this is a project in aora<br>which is uh right in the middle of the<br>able Tasman National Park uh top of the<br>south island so I is um not sure how<br>many of you have been there but it's<br>literally surrounded by the national<br>park with a small<br>cluster of<br>bches um it's incredibly beautiful um so<br>quite a so that's the the actual site<br>that sort of L-shaped piece uh a strip<br>immediately to the South and the<br>athfield batch just<br>here<br>um so you know no pressure it's probably<br>the most beautiful site you'll ever get<br>to work on don't mess it up um<br>so taking that that same idea of the big<br>roof and um smaller enclosures<br>underneath<br>it<br>and I guess adding a adding a courtyard<br>into that mix so the the the trees on<br>the site are quite the coner and Monica<br>are quite established quite tall trees<br>it's not a spot where you get the C VI<br>it's set back on the Jes and so wanting<br>to I guess carve out a decent clearing<br>within the site so that it was actually<br>a really sunny<br>badge uh<br>so yeah a couple of bedrooms couple of<br>bathrooms a living space and this big<br>Courtyard in the<br>middle and that again that big roof idea<br>so floating over these little boxes um<br>below and I is also you can't drive<br>there um you come in mostly by boat or<br>walking or flying um you can drive in<br>and then walk over the Esty if you get<br>your Tides right so that all obviously<br>adds a fair bit of complication to<br>building in that location so this is you<br>know materials coming in and that was<br>something that we obviously had to think<br>about quite a bit in the con in the<br>design processes how it was going to be<br>constructed um here's a diagram of how<br>that simple scaffolding structure uh got<br>got complicated so we so the other cabin<br>Simon's one the pipes just start at the<br>roof of the little boxes but this we're<br>like oh no we'll take the pipes all the<br>way down to the ground and then they can<br>build the roof first and then they can<br>build the boxes underneath and they'll<br>be out of the ring but they didn't do<br>that so um yeah maybe we shouldn't have<br>done that but so you can I guess start<br>to see some of that complexity<br>of basically when you take something<br>like that and then take it to an<br>engineer and say you know we want to do<br>this it's just all of a sudden there's<br>all these other factors and actually the<br>pipe's not scare pipe anymore it's<br>bigger diameter and then it has to be<br>poxy painted and zinc sprayed and um<br>then you need a building consent because<br>it's not a schedule one thing and so<br>suddenly it's a proper membrane roof<br>with yeah um it just<br>became it sounds like we're being really<br>negative about this project but it's<br>just it's just a much more complex<br>project and and doing that executing<br>that idea uh this is Roar who uh until<br>recently worked for us has headed over<br>to Sydney but this this project he he<br>was Project AR on I guess leading<br>leading this one and he also decided to<br>go to AA and live there for six months<br>in a tiny house with the builder who he<br>didn't know and be on site learning to<br>build and um I guess helping execute the<br>vision uh it's also a site where you<br>can't just call like there's no cell<br>reception in the air so it was kind of<br>an amazing opportunity was it was really<br>Brave of him I guess to go and do that<br>in this extremely remote<br>location um and I think he mostly had a<br>good<br>time we so we threw a whole bunch of<br>things we' never tried before on this<br>project which is probably one of the<br>things that made it a bit more<br>complicated than Simon's one and so this<br>is one of those things in this is um<br>short foot foundations which are we<br>thought it would be really really hard<br>to get concrete to our which is maybe<br>sort of partly true but um but these are<br>quite cool like so you put a sort of<br>plate on the ground and then you ram<br>these pipes in little<br>Roots um so no no concrete at all um in<br>the<br>foundations and then uh there's yeah<br>that's structure going up is also made<br>of sips um one of the things we were a<br>bit conscious of is that you can't just<br>pop down the road to Bunnings and so<br>everything has to come in but likewise<br>all your trash has to go out and so um<br>some of the things like the the sips you<br>know those are all made to order there's<br>no waste on site with those doing the<br>big roofs with just overhanging means<br>you don't need to worry about cutting<br>sheets on site again doesn't sort of<br>it's not critical where those things<br>start and stop um these are all actually<br>going to be clared in some really<br>beautiful TOA that we got miled uh which<br>is also what the is and so you<br>you know any wastage from that just gets<br>stacked in the corner for the fire in<br>the courtyard later so trying to you<br>know I'm sure there's still probably<br>been plenty of rubbish generated on the<br>site but trying to be a bit mindful of<br>that and and particularly because of the<br>location so this is these are pretty<br>recent photos as of last week<br>it's got the got the mini roofs on but<br>it does feel nice to create that<br>clearing you know there's just sort of<br>acres and Acres of moner and when you<br>come them into a sunny clearing so that<br>was the courtyard kind of is big enough<br>that it feels like it does<br>that and then eventually it might look<br>like this well hopefully sooner rather<br>than later um so again like just<br>creating some of those usable outdoor<br>sheltered covered spaces uh that way<br>that seems to be a bit of a recurring<br>that's it</p></main><footer style="margin-top: 2rem; background: #0001; padding: 2rem; text-align: center;"><p>We Are The University</p><ul style="list-style-type: none; padding: 0; margin: 0;"><li><a
