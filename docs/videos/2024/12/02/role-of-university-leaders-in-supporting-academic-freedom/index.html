the<br>university administrator Jerry fwell<br>famously remarked I want you to have all<br>want so long as you wind up saying that<br>the Bible's account of creation is true<br>and all others are<br>not now I haven't tried my hand at TV<br>evangelism yet but as a university<br>administrator I couldn't disagree more<br>with Reverend<br>forwell however my primary disagreement<br>is not about the role of<br>creation um if there's one critical<br>lesson I've learned uh in my time as a<br>university leader it's that how we have<br>conversations is as important if not<br>more important than what they're<br>actually about and ultimately where we<br>land whether that's in agreement or in<br>disagreement at its core academic<br>freedom is not about prescribing<br>conclusions and using the guise of<br>freedom to justify them it's about a<br>process it's about a process that has<br>rigorous scrutiny open dialogue<br>intellectual curiosity that leads to<br>informed conclusions this is a process<br>that allows us to learn allows us to<br>grow to challenge both ourselves and the<br>world around us for many I think 1979<br>certainly including my children might<br>seem like ancient history but I would<br>argue that the challenge to academic<br>freedom and the ways that we can engage<br>productively in complex issues are now<br>even more pressing today and across many<br>exhibits I'd submit to you that just two<br>weeks ago today Donald Donald Trump<br>secured the presidency of the United<br>States of America and arguably the<br>leadership of the Free World and<br>regardless of what you think about Mr<br>Trump I think one thing is clear his<br>campaign in an unprecedented way was<br>defined by polarization and<br>identity-based politics even his<br>supporters acknowledge this mode with<br>t-shirts that proudly and loudly<br>Proclaim I love Donald Trump because he<br>pisses off the people who I can't stand<br>it will not be a surprise to many that I<br>don't count myself among the T-shirt<br>wearers or one's admirers but I do<br>recognize the unsettling implications<br>that is Rise represents it reflects a<br>world that is increasingly defined by<br>division entrenched in Echo Chambers and<br>fueled by the weaponization of<br>misinformation from right across the<br>political spectrum and and unfortunately<br>this is not just an American phenomenon<br>here in ARA we are starting to see<br>similar patterns emerging social media<br>ecos ecosystems driven by algorithms<br>that value engagement over truth and the<br>fostering of self-reinforcing bubbles<br>where misinformation thrives what was<br>once confined to the fringes is now<br>seeping into the mainstream discourse<br>threatening not just political dialogue<br>but the Integrity of some of our most<br>fundamental institutions our health care<br>System our governance in the way we<br>govern and most relevant for us our<br>education system including of course<br>universities and my argument today is<br>that as a university as this University<br>and as universities in general we cannot<br>afford to fall victim to these derisive<br>modes of discourse our role as critic<br>and conscience driven institutions is<br>just too important as we witness the<br>erosion of the fourth estate<br>universities remain one of the few<br>Bastion left of reasoned evidence-based<br>discussion so my call today is that we<br>hold firmly on to all our teu the moing<br>posts that we anchor our walk to in<br>turbulent times especially the post that<br>is academic freedom today's panel<br>discussion is about ensuring that our<br>academic freedom tumu continues to be<br>strongly embedded within Solid Ground in<br>our university community with this goal<br>in mind as many people here will be<br>aware we're currently Consulting on our<br>draft policy which also covers freedom<br>of expression<br>and strives to strike that delicate<br>balance between providing Clarity and<br>certainty while also Rec recognizing<br>that context matters it also aims to<br>safeguard scholarly dialogue dialogue<br>grounded in evidence and driven by a<br>genuine desire to enhance understanding<br>and I think most<br>importantly it seeks to give our staff<br>the confidence that this University<br>Victoria University of Wellington to<br>head angle Walker our colleagues the<br>leaders and our wider Community will<br>support them as they exercise their<br>academic freedom even when their views<br>differ from what our own IND individual<br>opinions might be so my hope today is<br>that we can model the very principles<br>that we're seeking to uphold by bringing<br>the right people into the room by<br>listening to a range of different<br>perspectives by reflecting thoughtfully<br>on what we hear and through that process<br>be prepared at least in principle to<br>change our minds so it's not the most<br>recent but it's the first president of<br>the US George Washington who once warned<br>that if the freedom of speech is taken<br>away then the dumb and silent may be led<br>like sheep to the slaughter academic<br>freedom is not just a right it's a<br>responsibility it's our shared<br>commitment to ensure that reason<br>evidence and dialogue Remain the<br>foundations of our pursuit of knowledge<br>so let us approach today's discussion<br>with that Spirit working together to<br>Define and protect academic freedom for<br>the benefit of all to heading a walker<br>to heading<br>so I'm going to uh briefly introduce the<br>the minty slide this is a very<br>interactive session we're going to be<br>polling the University's opinions on a<br>range of different topics Guided by our<br>our very able uh panel uh and their<br>equal equally able convenor Professor<br>Longhurst who I will hand over to now to<br>introduce our panel members welcome to<br>Deen and thank you for coming and being<br>K welcome everybody thanks for coming<br>today and as Nick said my name's Robin<br>lus and it's a privilege to be able to<br>facilitate this panel discussion uh this<br>afternoon uh I would just like to say<br>before I introduce our panelists here<br>that uh justice s Williams passes on his<br>apologies he's unable to be here today<br>it turns out he had another engagement<br>however we uh we we still have three<br>wonderful panel members and we're uh<br>very appreciative that you are here with<br>us today so as as Nick said we are<br>running this session in a fairly sort of<br>interactive way we will be engaging with<br>the mty polls uh there are four of them<br>that we will likely get through if uh if<br>discussion allows uh there's also we<br>have some question questions from<br>audience members so as I say it's very<br>interactive uh I won't be asking our pan<br>panel members to weigh in on each one of<br>the miny polls but I will be leaving it<br>to them to to speak where they feel it's<br>appropriate for them to add their<br>expertise so without further Ado from me<br>I'm going to start at this end and uh<br>introduce you to our speakers one by one<br>you have had their bios but I would just<br>like to uh reiterate for you because we<br>have we're in a deemed company uh we<br>have Dame Juliet Gerard uh at the front<br>here who's a professor at the University<br>of Oakland and she's a biochemist whose<br>work spans many years it's both applied<br>of course and fundamental work uh Juliet<br>held the position of the prime<br>minister's Chief science advisor from<br>2018 to 2024 and I think you probably<br>already all know that about<br>Juliet uh what you might not know is she<br>first moved to New Zealand in 199 93<br>from the UK after completing a PhD at<br>Oxford University and began work as a<br>research scientist at uh crop and food<br>research so Juliet has spent six years<br>as chair of the masden fund Council uh<br>and as of course you all know<br>distributes um it's the biggest blue F<br>uh fund for Blue Sky research so um<br>Juliet I'm just going to pause there<br>before I introduce our next two<br>panelists and ask you if I can what made<br>you say yes to the invitation<br>today we were talking about this earlier<br>I was tricked into<br>it but but I think it's an incredibly<br>important topic so I'm really glad to be<br>here thanks Juliet so in in the middle<br>um I don't know if it's the rose between<br>the two Thorns or uh the<br>th uh so we have with us our our own<br>Mike Joy who's senior research fellow in<br>the school of geography environment and<br>Earth Sciences um and Mike describes<br>himself as a a late starter in Academia<br>first attending University in his early<br>30s to gain his BSC MSC and PhD in<br>ecology and after seeing firsthand the<br>decline in freshwater Health in New<br>Zealand U Mike has become as many of you<br>will know uh quite an outspoken advocate<br>for Environmental Protection Mike's<br>received a number of awards for the work<br>including the inaugural New Zealand<br>University's critic and conscience award<br>and just recently Mike of course you<br>also received the calican medal from the<br>Royal Society of New Zealand so<br>so we managed to talk you into<br>it yeah um I was a bit iffy about it but<br>I decided<br>to a couple of times I wanted to pull<br>out but um I'm here cuz I've got a few<br>things I want to get across so good we<br>like that and we're looking forward to<br>thank you and um uh furtherest down the<br>line is uh Professor Tracy McIntosh um<br>Tracy from NATO professor of indigenous<br>studies<br>ATA at the University of Oakland and<br>she's the chief science advisor for the<br>Ministry of Social Development Tracy was<br>a Fullbright visiting lecturer in New<br>Zealand studies at Georgetown University<br>in Washington DC and lectured at the<br>University of the South Pacific in<br>Fiji um Tracy I know you've sat on<br>numerous assessment panels boards<br>advisory groups commissions too many for<br>me to to mention here your recent<br>research um is focused of course on<br>incarceration particularly of Mari and<br>Indigenous peoples and on issues<br>pertaining to Poverty inequality and<br>social justice and I can't think of<br>anything more important so so welcome<br>Tracy and what enticed you to be here<br>today<br>look I think I follow on in the sort of<br>the ambivalence uh element so there's a<br>definitely we've got something really M<br>very much in common but I often talk<br>about productive<br>discomfort and what it can produce and<br>really drawing on really reflecting on<br>rangan Walker's work where I think in<br>terms of the nation he brought topics to<br>us both in his guys as an academic and<br>also in his in his role as as um what do<br>you called a conservative activist but<br>this this issue of productive disc<br>comfort about how we sit with ideas that<br>are difficult for us so I since I speak<br>about it I thought I better put it into<br>practice well we're delighted to have<br>you here today thank you so we're going<br>to go straight into our first scenario<br>it won't take you long to figure out<br>that these scenarios we're going to put<br>up are pretty curly there's no easy<br>answers to them there's no right or<br>wrong so you don't need to be concerned<br>that you that you won't<br>pass uh some of them have got three four<br>I think one of them's got five options<br>but the final option in each of them is<br>a is an open field we you may have some<br>ideas that are different from the ones<br>that we've put up there for you to<br>choose so you can feel free to do that<br>and then um type in the open text and we<br>will be displaying both the numerical<br>results of who chooses ABC and so on as<br>well as putting up the open comments so<br>be prepared for any comments you write<br>in there to be displayed publicly um but<br>anonymously but anonymously yeah yeah<br>good good good checking bnie thank you<br>so um uh the first thing you need to do<br>and most of you will be pretty familiar<br>with this now is to scan that QR code so<br>pole and then when everybody has done<br>that we will go to our scenario number<br>number one as I said before I don't<br>expect each of the panel members to<br>weigh in on each one of the scenarios<br>but we'll leave it to them as to what<br>they would like to speak<br>to Okay I think we're good to go with<br>scenario<br>one so I'm just going to summarize we<br>have a lecturer or associate professor<br>has an invited speaker this person's<br>known to have controversial d uh views<br>on gender come to speak to a large<br>sociology first year class the speaker<br>engages in research on the topic but<br>some say that that research is not<br>particularly rigorous the lecturer seems<br>to have a group that's split we have<br>some refusing to come to class some who<br>are saying they will protest but we're<br>not sure what that involves the<br>remaining third are very keen want to<br>hear what the speaker has to say there<br>will be a question in the final test on<br>gender<br>identity so you can see the options up<br>there okay huge number<br>there uh can we flick now I think we we<br>huge number I just carry on with uh the<br>class risking disruptions but a<br>recording for those that don't uh want<br>to attend wow that's quite a resounding<br>result on that<br>one let's go though we have 20 people<br>who have suggest Ed some other actions<br>let's go to the next slide and<br>see what people would like to type into<br>that okay while people are putting their<br>comments in there I will invite our<br>panelists if there is anything you'd<br>like to say to weigh in on this one what<br>you might do or the resounding result<br>for option one of just keep going with<br>class but offer a recording look I'm I'm<br>I'm willing to to start in on this one<br>and one of the things I'd like us all to<br>think about when we look at these<br>different scenarios is actually what the<br>what the poy tells you know what the<br>emotional response is because I think<br>that that we thinking of ourselves in<br>the sort of reason considered way but<br>for many of us across these scenarios<br>there's a really strong response here<br>it's not here it's here and I think it's<br>a really important element to think what<br>drives that what drives that feeling<br>that you get feeling that I get for this<br>one for example why why get it right<br>here so I think to consider this one I<br>want to consider it through a range of<br>of things so one I think about what do<br>we expect of academics what are our<br>expectations of them and here I'm sort<br>of following sort of Zigman Balman in<br>terms of responsible speech so sort of<br>thinking about what does that mean what<br>do we expect in regards to<br>considerations and Reflections in<br>regards to to methodologies that it's<br>not just a freefor all what do we think<br>what do we expect from our students<br>what do we expect in terms of<br>ethical Tia considerations what do we<br>think about those sorts of elements so I<br>think that those are sort of important<br>ways whatever the scenario is in in in<br>reflecting um across those particular<br>areas I also want to know on a lighter<br>note that if we get a third of the<br>students into the class it's sort of a a<br>a a contemporary anomaly but anyway um<br>I'll I'll I'll a light side on a on a<br>serious on a serious topic I think one<br>of the really important elements when<br>we're talking about speaking truth to<br>power<br>is who is powerful and the incredible<br>differential impacts of decision making<br>across groups we know that particular<br>groups that are<br>marginalized have far worse outcomes<br>across Health across Justice and across<br>all of those things we have to be<br>thinking about that in terms of what<br>responsible speech looks like for me if<br>there was a a different element of<br>looking there I think that it's<br>important for us to contest these types<br>of issues I'm not sure in this case<br>bringing a speaker in is the best way<br>that we truly do that I don't know if<br>it's a good faith um possibility I think<br>bringing the work of that person in and<br>looking at their work discussing it<br>having workshops around that work and<br>later on perhaps thinking about what the<br>invitation might look like in a<br>collective sense but if you're not if we<br>talk truth to power and we actually you<br>know one the things I see with academic<br>freedom and particularly the discussions<br>we're having at the moment we seem to be<br>producing and Garett Cooper um has<br>talked about this well we seem to be you<br>know producing these really powerful<br>victims you know you know that really<br>claiming victimhood from incredibly<br>powerful platforms so that's what I<br>would i' suggest I think for this for me<br>it's not an easy just do the class I you<br>know disruption is not a problem for me<br>you only have to look at at yesterday on<br>the absolute incredible importance of<br>disruption but just disruption for<br>disruption without taking all of those<br>things into account I don't know if<br>we're you know if we've been if we're<br>working in good faith and so I think I<br>think that that for me is how I'd<br>respond to this one k Tracy appreciate<br>that that's um really interesting useful<br>comments does any other panel member<br>yeah first of all I'm really interested<br>in um the extent to which people were<br>influenced by the tally it would be<br>great if we could do it blind I don't<br>know if we can or we can't because it it<br>became very apparent that one was<br>popular um I found this scenario really<br>difficult to Grapple with and I wound<br>back<br>to what's the principle here what are we<br>trying to do and I'm guessing that<br>whoever inviting this speaker is trying<br>to create a teaching moment about<br>dealing with contentious and different<br>ult ideas um and you want to do that<br>without forcing them on people or<br>penalizing them in an examination<br>process so I think where I landed was to<br>try and create an alternative pathway<br>that still met the same goal so could<br>you put in an opt out clause that you<br>didn't have to listen but if you didn't<br>listen for your assessment you had to<br>present to the class an eloquent<br>argument on why you didn't engage so<br>that we could use it as a way of<br>bringing everyone around a central idea<br>of this is difficult and why is it<br>difficult and bringing out different<br>perspectives thank you I think that's a<br>really interesting um<br>idea okay um can we hide the numbers and<br>Amanda yeah thanks<br>Bry M the screen mute the screen but<br>no okay you can see on the phone as well<br>we just need to go with that okay okay<br>try not to be swayed Everybody by the<br>room okay let's move on to scenario two<br>we have one here involving academic<br>freedom and<br>research so to summarize the scenario<br>you have the senior lecturer an expert<br>in chemistry of rare Earth<br>elements um she believes her her um work<br>as the future to Green energy<br>storage her Works attracted a lot of<br>attention from New Zealand green mining<br>Corporation who've just been given<br>license to operate a mine in a<br>conservation estate she's Keen to work<br>with them about to sign a research<br>contract head of school says no no no<br>and refuses to give approval for the<br>work to be carried out in the school and<br>you can see those<br>scenarios uh those um responses to that<br>scenario<br>there okay I think um I'll invite any<br>one of our panel members who might want<br>to speak to that before we have a look<br>at the open field<br>comments we have popularity again with a<br>but not overwhelmingly so as in with the<br>I just find it so unrealistic as to be<br>hard to imagine that anything I mean<br>mining's been going on in this country<br>for forever oh sorry not forever but for<br>a long time and and University academics<br>have been involved in that work and<br>whether it's gold or silver or coal or<br>all of those things and I would doubt<br>there's ever been a head of Department<br>that's told that person not to be<br>involved in that I think that's so<br>unrealistic and then to throw in the<br>it's it's it's a kind of a bug bear of<br>mine and it's it's what's making some of<br>my work recently um supposedly<br>controversial is pointing out that um<br>the idea that we can switch to this some<br>magic new energy source as fossil fuels<br>are not available anymore as a way of<br>carrying on living like we are um and<br>sort of that being seen as green Mar or<br>environmental um is a real problem<br>because if we do go down that pathway we<br>are just going to destroy what's left of<br>the planet that we haven't already<br>destroyed using fossil fuels and so that<br>would be the kind of scenario that I<br>would like to see around the freedom to<br>speak up about um the potential<br>downsides of the whole idea that we can<br>carry on living like we are and and it's<br>especially in the wealthy part of the<br>world the the 50% of us in New Zealand<br>who are in the top 10% of of wealth in<br>the world who are doing more than 50%<br>75% According to some measures of the<br>harm on the planet so yeah as just to<br>come back to the question it's so it's<br>so unreal is to be difficult to to talk<br>about thanks Mike you can be the head of<br>Department I just said that um Mike<br>could be the head of Department makes a<br>little bit more real yeah just I'd say<br>go for it go for the research but yeah<br>we need to be calling it<br>out I uh want to add on to Tracy's point<br>about the feeling in your gut um and<br>that's I think heavily influenced by<br>your training so full disclosure I<br>trained in chemistry and when I saw that<br>I'm like well of course it's say um I<br>was the least thoughtful in the place<br>where I knew the most and I think that's<br>worth thinking about because we don't<br>naturally bring in other perspectives um<br>so my gut reaction to this one was<br>obviously it's none of the head of<br>school's business but someone should<br>Joy but the point that you make Julie is<br>an important one the things that are<br>closest to us are the things that we<br>often have the least cons we we consider<br>the least so it is an important element<br>in regards to our responsible use around<br>academic<br>freedom okay I think we can move and<br>have a look at the another set of<br>actions slide now to see okay to Mike's<br>Point on realism I did have a similar<br>situation when I was a lecturer at<br>Canterbury in that I was offered a<br>contract from the US Military and I was<br>hugely conflicted about that and and<br>worked through it and it was fundamental<br>research all in the open literature blah<br>blah and and I came to my own conclusion<br>that it was legit and I was going to<br>pursue it and I did have huge push back<br>from various points in the University<br>because it never happened before so<br>there are scenarios where it might<br>happen maybe not with that specific<br>scenario but in other scenario<br>took a long time to work through it I<br>had the the opposite I guess in that<br>working in an agricultural University<br>that is funded by most of the research<br>is funded by the industry that that you<br>you you know speaking up against that<br>became very very uncomfortable very very<br>quickly<br>but yeah I I've noticed both in the last<br>scenario in this one the VC's come up a<br>few times Nick we've got talked to the<br>VC in this one and last time we had the<br>gender yeah can we scroll it oh yeah oh<br>look okay great so we're just coming to<br>grips with the technology here people<br>bear as bnie said bear with can I can I<br>come on that one about the does it<br>conflict with the values of the<br>University because that was another<br>thing that came up um where people would<br>you know I'm in an agricultural<br>University talking about the impacts of<br>Agriculture and um people would uh<br>editors from rural Publications saying<br>to the vice Chancellor why doesn't your<br>University have a policy how can you<br>have this guy saying this and this other<br>person saying the opposite as if we<br>would have a corporate view you know<br>which is the opposite to what we want<br>isn't it we we want the we want to be to<br>be open to have all views available<br>that's a good point and in fact Richard<br>I'm wondering about this might be a good<br>time for you to ask your<br>question oh can I've got your question<br>if you need it but but it was about<br>ensuring politically diverse views at a<br>university um which is exactly what<br>Mike's really is really talking about um<br>okay have you found your question I I<br>have found oh good um before I knew what<br>was going to be said or how this session<br>was going to be structured we were<br>invited to ask questions so this is one<br>that was chosen just I'm not getting<br>special treatment here um so my question<br>is in two parts so it's how can<br>University leaders ensure that<br>politically diverse views for example<br>support for or against Israel's conduct<br>in Gaza heterodox views on the<br>principles of the treaty or on<br>affirmative action or some now<br>apparently controversial but otherwise<br>Orthodox views on the existence of<br>biological sex are genuinely able to be<br>genuinely able to be expressed on campus<br>along with meaningful debates taking<br>place among people who disagree and<br>second part is and where is the line to<br>be drawn between speakers perhaps of a<br>more scholarly nature like Kathleen<br>stock and more pmics ones like Kelly Jun<br>Mel posie Parker thank<br>you thanks Richard and and I chose<br>Richard's question out because there<br>were a number that came through from<br>people along similar lines it was um<br>there was another one from somebody who<br>had said while they are politically left<br>of center and so are the colleagues uh<br>they they said they don't think that's<br>healthy and that universities should<br>actually Foster political diversity so<br>but how do we have those conversations<br>productively so that I I chose Richard's<br>question because there were a number on<br>that theme so I'd be interested to hear<br>from our panelists whether what your<br>views are on tolerance for sort of more<br>radical ideas or from from a whole range<br>across the political Spectrum how do we<br>Foster that kind of environment at a<br>university<br>um I just wanted to comment on the last<br>question about you know scholarship<br>versus just from my experience of being<br>of of initially with John Key saying<br>well that's just Mike Joy's<br>opinion um no it's not an opinion I mean<br>that's a great way for politicians to<br>put it down it's a conclusion after<br>gathering together all of this evidence<br>that that went before this is my<br>conclusion and that is so different from<br>an opinion<br>which is based on some ideology that you<br>have and I think that that's a good<br>distinction to split between you know<br>scholarship and and random<br>opinion I I mean I think in regards to<br>that political diverse elements we all<br>all of us here can think of people who<br>hold different political views than<br>ourselves that we've worked with that<br>they've been colleagues with that we've<br>done things with that we've argued with<br>and we've debated so we seem to be able<br>to do it on that at that level I guess<br>what you're talking about is how do you<br>do it as a as a much broader uh<br>community and at a collective level and<br>you know I still go back to those you<br>know about what it<br>means you know the privilege and<br>responsibilities of having an education<br>of actually you know sitting in a room<br>with overeducated people um which we all<br>are at the moment doing you know just<br>what it means what are the<br>responsibilities and our<br>accountabilities to be in that so if I<br>think about you know those and I think<br>it comes back to Mike there is a real<br>difference in regards to having huge<br>respect for someone's scholarship or the<br>way they present arguments or they<br>debate<br>arguments with other areas that I'm<br>going to be not just have a productive<br>discomfort from that I think are likely<br>just to cause Division and conflict so I<br>think there is something about the<br>maturity of us as as academics and the<br>maturity of the institution to have<br>quite a high risk<br>appetite in these areas so it's not a<br>closing down it's an opening up but you<br>know ethical concerns must always be in<br>play and that's why I think that if we<br>don't consider power we don't reflect on<br>power then the idea that you get<br>political you know it's like we can get<br>diversity ethnic diversity very easy in<br>a university really hard for us to get<br>equity and I think that's the same thing<br>there you know the idea that everyone<br>sits in the same similar powerful<br>position to be able to speak their<br>truth I think we have to be very uh you<br>know cognizant of what that may do but I<br>think we can do it at a small scale we<br>seem to struggle a bit more as we scale<br>up yeah I I think it's really risky to<br>other people who aren't educated I mean<br>I think that's a large part what's<br>happening in America um and so I would<br>rather call your opinion an opinion but<br>challenge you on the evidence that<br>informs your opinion um so you would<br>have an evidence informed opinion<br>someone else might have a quick reckon<br>and so I think we need to create spaces<br>where we interrogate the evidence behind<br>opinions and also be really clear on the<br>difference between the evident and the<br>values um so it's a hard thing to do but<br>I think we have to find ways to do it<br>and I'm interested I read a few of these<br>policies preparing for this and there's<br>a lot of really good stuff written to<br>scaffold good judgment but less about<br>who makes the judgment and I do worried<br>lots of these things are saying ask the<br>vice Chancellor I mean that's fine if<br>the vice Chancellor's engaging in these<br>debates but let's suppose Nick takes a<br>turn for the worst and becomes very<br>authoritarian you've just vested<br>everything in one person I think that's<br>risky so it's almost like we need an<br>ombudsman type figure who can say yeah<br>actually Mike you can slag off the vice<br>Chancellor don't leave it to the vice<br>Chancellor to to defend your right to<br>criticize lots of them do fantastic and<br>I'm sure Nick will but um just in case I<br>get caught for some defame clause in<br>your<br>policy but but I think we could um<br>scaffold people's judgment and think<br>really hard about who it is that makes<br>these decisions that isn't in a position<br>maybe thank<br>you I think we will move to scenario<br>three because it seem ways quite nicely<br>into how we make decisions about what's<br>going on within our um our Institution<br>tions so scenario 3 again I will just<br>give you an opportunity to to read that<br>it's sort of an interesting one for me<br>I've I've gone to protest since I was a<br>child you know my parents have taken me<br>to protest since I was a child I've been<br>involved in protest as some people in<br>the room know I don't like putting<br>people In Harm's Way so I'm actually<br>quite conflicted on this one even though<br>that I I I agree in the<br>principle um of it going ahead<br>with a real need for a lot of discourse<br>a lot of Engagement prior to it a lot of<br>a lot of talk a lot of action you know<br>if we think again about yesterday to be<br>able to disperse like that and to do no<br>damage and just be there for the co-a<br>just how significant how important that<br>is but I don't like putting people's In<br>Harm's Way I<br>it's I'm quite happy to go to those<br>things myself and I wouldn't so there's<br>a real Personal Al them and I think we<br>do need to bring those those elements um<br>in as well that's my that's my first<br>thoughts even though I probably would I<br>would agree<br>with uh largy with what's been<br>said in this<br>particular geopolitical<br>environment I would be consumed for my<br>students and I'd also be concerned that<br>they<br>could if not be harmed be involved in<br>the harms of others and what that may do<br>to the<br>copopa I just wanted to offer an not an<br>alternative but maybe and that is and I<br>don't know how much it costs but<br>deescalation training um that that that<br>I've been in those situations where<br>people are in your face and and having<br>those skills can can maybe save on a<br>fair bit of security cost and it's<br>something that that maybe the university<br>could could be involved<br>in I think it's about teaching I mean<br>we're a university we need to empower<br>the students St to do that safely so<br>protest is going to be increasingly<br>important at universities I'm guessing<br>and we need them to be student L and we<br>need to empower the students to do it<br>safely and yesterday is just such a<br>fantastic example of doing it safely and<br>I was on quoty place um I arrived in the<br>evening and I'm like where's the mess it<br>was astonishing um so teaching the<br>students how to protest safely I think<br>would be a fantastic goal for the<br>University yeah maybe not not effies I<br>don't know<br>LM thank you really helpful<br>responses and I'll just give you a<br>moment there to digest those ones that<br>are coming up on<br>screen someone says 50k of extra<br>security really but it's I think it's<br>security I mean the police came and too<br>that's interesting that's the state that<br>crowns<br>contribution I me could students run<br>security I suppose and the next question<br>that follows on from this too is if the<br>student St decide the that they don't<br>want to leave after the protest and we<br>end up in an occupation<br>situation and how that might provoke<br>again a different set of responses at at<br>that<br>point I think all of these are on a you<br>know context by context basis I think<br>that many of us recognize that<br>occupations have been done in the past<br>in the past and that there' have been<br>just reasons for it and there will be<br>occupations done in the future that have<br>that have very just reasons for it<br>occupations are often a a reasserting of<br>manake in places that have been have<br>been taken so just having an occupation<br>is is an immediate way that we respond<br>to the notion and the nature of an<br>occupation um again I think the same<br>there are principles that come into<br>place and and certainly occupation on a<br>un on University grounds is Health<br>there's safety there's a whole range of<br>those issues but it's I don't think it's<br>you can have a broader regulatory<br>environment that looks at the way that<br>we might make our decisions rather than<br>having a regulatory environment that's<br>already made that<br>decision this uh feels like it it might<br>be um an appropriate moment to move to a<br>question by um Professor Joanna Kidman<br>um and Joanna has asked me to read out<br>the question for her given that we've<br>just been talking a little bit about the<br>hio yesterday and about the way in which<br>that was a very peaceful protest um what<br>tidty or white tongy obligations and<br>responsibilities should University<br>leaders consider when protecting<br>academic freedom particularly of Marty<br>students and<br>academics I'm happy to go with it I<br>thought you might Tracy thank you I<br>think particularly in Article 2 response<br>is really significant here in regards to<br>what<br>what might look like in these sorts of<br>spaces one of the things around it<br>around the partnership it means that you<br>can't always hold all of the Power all<br>of the<br>time so we have to you know so you have<br>to be able to se and you have to be able<br>to do it these are around really high<br>trust types of relationships at a time<br>when trust has been eroded so I think<br>that you know again you know we're<br>in you know we're institutions of Higher<br>Learning and so I think and and that<br>would be just my first response I'm sure<br>others have got other responses but that<br>first one is really recognizing at the<br>University<br>levels particularly UH responsibilities<br>two I wanted to ask Tracy um I guess how<br>it works in the marai because all these<br>documents kind of track back to Oxford<br>or Cambridge in 1500 and something but<br>what what would the concept is there a<br>concept mean one of Jackson spoke about<br>this but many many people have spoken<br>about that you know one of the things<br>and I'm not equating the marai with a<br>university but I think that we can<br>mutually learn from each other so<br>certainly in regards to on on the marai<br>particularly on the on the ARA as as<br>opposed to being in the in the F tuna<br>you know you've got the sorts of<br>direct the speech could be seen as as<br>unrestricted but it's not unrestricted<br>in regards to a recognition that there<br>will be no consequences there will be<br>consequences and the most important<br>element of this is to uphold<br>relationships so people can speak you<br>know there is freedom there is very much<br>freedom of speech and so there not not<br>just the right of the of the speech but<br>actually in and this speaks much more to<br>the academic freedom on the practice of<br>that right what the practice of that<br>right looks like and under you know so<br>and one of the main elements is that one<br>there's a recognition there's<br>consequences for<br>speech um and that<br>relationships are seen as the most<br>important element to maintain and I<br>guess another one is just on the<br>whole what when you when you have to be<br>obviously you have to be a good speaker<br>to be a very good<br>listener and so that the sort of the<br>ability to F to uplift people and to<br>recognize and it might come back to your<br>question as well one of those spaces are<br>where you can have very very different<br>views and many of us would have seen<br>that in mud ey settings very different<br>views um High emotional set heated<br>settings you know and you come into the<br>house<br>and<br>relationships can still stay intact<br>where there has been a recognition that<br>that knowledge and expertise has been<br>shared and relationships have been kept<br>in tag you sometimes those relationships<br>get a bit shaky you know there are<br>consequences but I do think it's a<br>really good you know going back to your<br>your question Juliet we do that we do<br>that on a on a daily<br>really and it's not that you you know we<br>say you got to be accountable in this<br>environment God you got to be far more<br>accountable in that other environment<br>and in terms of peer review far<br>harsher so Tracy just a quick followup<br>for me how do we get better at doing<br>that as a university get better at the<br>relationships you know one of the things<br>and I was going to talk about it later<br>is about what it means when who you are<br>and what you are speaks and so being<br>a some of us are often seen just because<br>of who we are<br>as an unreliable<br>informant that we C we can't have the<br>sort of um reason consideration that<br>others can because we're so caught up in<br>our emotional cultural responses to<br>things so I think that you know<br>to to get to the point me it's the same<br>thing that we do everywhere I mean I I<br>was Tau very recently by a very highly<br>educated<br>senior uh<br>academic in a really quite complex<br>difficult area that um we're talking<br>around M as it so happened and she said<br>it's not my fault I don't know this I<br>didn't learn it at<br>school and I thought it was an<br>interesting response given that<br>what her area of expertise was I'm<br>pretty sure she didn't learn that at<br>school either um so you know that's a<br>commitment to learn it's a commitment to<br>sit with people it's a commitment to<br>understand others and we do that on a<br>small one and we do it on on a on a<br>broader ele element but it's the way we<br>do everything else if we think about our<br>own disciplinary training it wasn't that<br>we took it because it was simple and<br>there were no complex ideas or contested<br>ideas that we had to play around with<br>that was why we were impassioned by what<br>transfer okay thank you I think we will<br>scenario so a lot of support for the<br>third and the fourth one here especially<br>the making a public statement in the<br>media supporting the academic staff<br>member uh telling the politician that<br>universities need to uphold academic<br>freedom and so there's little else to be<br>matter so we're all aware of the Susie<br>wild Kai University of Oakland uh this<br>has certainly been a a topic of<br>conversation amongst colleagues<br>um Mike I'm going to invite you<br>yeah well I mean because I have some<br>real experience I I had some input into<br>the scenario um so just a little bit of<br>background um when I was at Messi uh the<br>vice Chancellor was um Steve Mahari and<br>uh I didn't realize until quite a long<br>way through but uh the CE of Federated<br>Farmers was Connor English brother of<br>Minister then Minister Bill English and<br>he would according to Steve rang the<br>university every few weeks and demand<br>that I be sacked um but then one day<br>came this letter from fed a legal uh a<br>lawyer's letter from Federated Farmers<br>saying this guy is uh he's made all<br>these statements and they're not true<br>and uh we're going to sue you for<br>defamation and it turned out that the<br>article I were referring to that I'd<br>written um was the version that read was<br>in a hard copy<br>and in in the online article the whole<br>thing what what it was was that<br>everything I'd said was referenced and I<br>could just hand over within minutes to<br>the vice Chancellor to the the<br>referenced version which was then sent<br>to Federated farmers who then we never<br>heard from again on on that topic um<br>which tells you a few things that what<br>what worried me was that this big<br>organization had no thought these things<br>that I was saying in this case about the<br>state of fresh water was<br>wrong but but but only because they live<br>in this kind of bubble and and<br>everything that I said was referenced<br>you know to the eth degree but so so in<br>that case the response was and and Steve<br>Mahari said to<br>me often that as long as you play with a<br>straight bat was his term um we will we<br>will protect you we will back you up but<br>never once did I have through all of the<br>trials and tribulations that I can think<br>of did the ever come out and support of<br>me they just the best I could ask for<br>was silence and um it was New Zealand<br>Association of scientists who came out<br>and support New Zealand ecological<br>society and individuals who came out and<br>support but never in my experience the<br>university something similar happened at<br>this University at not Nick but a<br>previous Vice Chancellor um and he<br>immediately took the the complainant to<br>be right and me to be wrong this<br>happened on a couple of occasions that I<br>had to then go through a some kind of<br>you know process of of defending myself<br>I was presumed guilty um until I could<br>prove otherwise so I mean it was it's<br>heartening to see what the people voted<br>for CU that's what I would love to have<br>happened but but that has not been my<br>experience up until now and I hope that<br>Nick will you know we it would be so<br>nice to think that when we take on this<br>role as critic and critic and conscience<br>that the university came in behind us<br>and and supported us and because I think<br>the public and and the awards and things<br>if anything show that they appreciate<br>that work why doesn't the university<br>appreciate it that's the the sad but for<br>us<br>that thanks Mike thank you Mike Julie so<br>as I written it's it's easy to answer<br>because it's solid research and we're<br>defending truth and beauty and academic<br>freedom what if it was<br>research there's a good question for<br>those who might not have heard it what<br>if it was<br>research so it it changes exactly who<br>decides it's back to that but but we<br>have had that scenario play out in New<br>Zealand in the pandemic um and and then<br>harder just to put the cat amongst the<br>pigeons in all of this as well we would<br>have those uh people colleagues who<br>would argue quite strongly that<br>universities need to adopt a more<br>neutral kind of position and so need to<br>be careful about when they come in and<br>put their weight behind academics and<br>when they don't and of course it's going<br>to depend on things like what's been the<br>peerreview process the quality of the<br>research and so on but that we the point<br>was raised earlier about us being a very<br>broad Community we don't necessarily all<br>share the same values we don't involve<br>ourselves in the same kinds of work how<br>do we create a place where everybody has<br>a voice I mean I'm playing de devil's<br>advocate here um if we are continually<br>kind of going into support<br>academics on one platform or another I<br>think there would be people who argue<br>that I think there was a good argument<br>in there around the need for a senior<br>leadership to really work hard in<br>explicating what academic freedom is so<br>that you might not have to do it then<br>for every individualized case the fact<br>is people don't understand it um well so<br>that maybe that may be that particular<br>particular role I think the notion of<br>neutrality is just a<br>falsehood and so I just don't think that<br>as a as a Institute of higher education<br>that we can just act like that's a real<br>thing um you know I'm a sociologist but<br>I don't think you have to be a<br>sociologist to know that that's just<br>like not true um and<br>so but but but<br>saying that we're not neutral doesn't<br>mean that we are politically centered in<br>one's space either but we recognize that<br>there'll be different types of<br>priorities and if we're looking at it a<br>straight government one they have their<br>own priorities so many of us can do<br>things that might go under the radar and<br>many of us it's it's going to stick out<br>at one time or another and that's and<br>that's why I think that that much<br>broader work becomes even more important<br>so that then when uh the university does<br>need to come in at a specific case<br>there is a much broader undersell that<br>you can point to that you can suggest<br>and that you can look at um but yeah the<br>notion of neutrality which i' I've heard<br>argued<br>recently it just seems it just seems you<br>know ridiculous it's just not true so<br>you know it' be impossible for us to be<br>in the positions that we have to say<br>that we're just you know that it would<br>it would expect that we're sort of these<br>neutral cannons that knowledge comes in<br>that we don't really analyze it or think<br>about it we're just going to impart it<br>and students are just going to be<br>acceptant of it and the broader public<br>on who on which we serve so um I don't<br>think there's a real issue around I mean<br>I expect politicians to be<br>political I got no role with it and I<br>expect um you know<br>really good faith considered<br>reflection based on evidence finding and<br>and the quality of the argument to be<br>something that we do and that we would<br>expect our senior leadership to<br>do thanks Tracy I I think that's a<br>really interesting point to make uh to<br>question throw up in the air that notion<br>of neutrality and instead for<br>institutions potentially universities<br>potentially to be thinking about perhaps<br>power relations and all the unevenness<br>that are involved in those power<br>relationships because it's not<br>necessarily going to be the same<br>decision made for a very senior<br>professor as it is for an early career<br>academic for example and so on so I<br>think that's an excellent point to<br>make other comments from the panel on<br>4 okay I think um Rebecca I'm looking in<br>your direction now and wondering if<br>you've got your question at the<br>ready I think Rebecca's got a good one<br>as we start moving into the latter part<br>of our session uh so sure everyone uh my<br>name is Rebecca um<br>I suppose I'd like the panel to<br>potentially uh address the elephant in<br>the room um which is the proposed uh<br>changes to the Education and Training<br>act um that seem to suggest that<br>academic freedom uh will be compromised<br>uh by the threat of government funding<br>um being withdrawn um I suppose my<br>concern here and I can hear it from the<br>panel as well um is that our current<br>government uh is really unable to<br>clearly draw a line uh between academic<br>freedom uh and our role as critic and<br>conscience of society uh and Free Speech<br>absolutism um and please correct me if<br>I'm wrong but I don't see any great<br>hurry from dpmc to find a new Chief<br>science advisor so I wondered if you<br>could talk to that<br>please I'm just wondering could<br>everybody hear the question from Rebecca<br>the micro it's not your fault re the<br>microphone's not not very loud so the<br>the question was about uh potential<br>amendments to the Education and Training<br>act and um this idea that all all<br>universities may need a statement or<br>policy whether those are the same or<br>whether those are different on academic<br>freedom and if uh if they don't<br>government May withdraw funding we don't<br>know yet in what direction this will go<br>but in many areas there's not high trust<br>in the current Co coalition government<br>and the direction of travel so um that<br>was the the question Rebecca's question<br>it it was about that intersecting<br>between academic freedom and our role as<br>critic and conscience of society<br>and okay<br>panelists and I mean I think it's time<br>for universities to stand up and stand<br>firm um and a lot of the conversations<br>about policies on academic freedom and<br>freedom of speech are framed within the<br>law but I think I'd rather turn it round<br>I think I'd rather hin in on the<br>tradition of universities on the fact<br>that academic freedom is our lifeblood<br>that we have to defend it and the law<br>needs to follow that um because you get<br>Dopey laws right and I hope lots of the<br>stuff in the draft policy keeps saying<br>if lawful if lawful but if there's a<br>really stupid law I hope that we would<br>break ahead um and that the university<br>would stand firm on that so I mean I'm<br>talking about something extreme like<br>women can't give lectures or something<br>there would be times when we would break<br>the law so I think we need to be leading<br>these discussions not not following and<br>and be brave um and yes maybe there'll<br>be Financial consequences but if what<br>are people saying don't obey first I<br>mean let's stand firm let's push for<br>what we think is right and really fight<br>for that and it's something where<br>universities collectively have a role I<br>leaders um I just wonder do is it the CR<br>is there any threat of the critic and<br>conscience part of the Education Act<br>Rebecca there's any threat to critic and<br>conscience but I think there's a real<br>disconnect between what the current<br>government will the party responsible<br>for that um those proposed changes um<br>and yeah this this concept around Free<br>Speech absolutism that that free speech<br>is kind of just across the board you can<br>say what you want and it'll be protected<br>and that's very very different um from<br>academic freedom and as Tracy pointed<br>out I I think that that is completely<br>misunderstood by the<br>public because because I see the<br>difference um you know they kind of get<br>lumped together academic freedom and<br>critic and conscience but I see the<br>critic and conscience part as a<br>responsibility you know that it's so<br>crucial that we we academics you know<br>like in my field freshwater scientists<br>95% are in institutions that are unable<br>to speak up they're not allowed to say<br>anything so that throws the<br>responsibility on us to to to be that<br>critic and conscience and to speak up<br>and it and I'd you know I don't know you<br>know some people just don't want to do<br>it and I I get that but but I wonder how<br>many are are worried or<br>it it definitely threatens opportunities<br>for funding is one reason why people<br>stay quiet you know and that's so so it<br>doesn't it cannot be in a policy it's<br>just a fear that you have and and and a<br>Justified fear I think that if you if<br>you stand up too many times you you'll<br>just not get funding for anything um it<br>can and rare occasions go the other way<br>um like it has with me where the last<br>three roles I've had have been funded by<br>uh outside people outside of the<br>University so sometimes you do get<br>rewarded for for being the squeaky wheel<br>but in most cases not so yeah<br>it's I would like to see more um I can<br>see how they're trying to undo this and<br>the government of this government would<br>like to undo that critic and conscience<br>role so yeah I think it's it's it's a a<br>responsibility rather than a freedom<br>that academic freedom part of it yeah<br>and then I think it's you know we<br>recognize there's a global turn there<br>and it's very interesting around sort of<br>that Free Speech absolutism um<br>particularly where you've seen it in the<br>US and states where it aligns with you<br>know books being banned whole whole<br>departments me you know you can't have<br>you know critical race Theory you can't<br>have all these booklets so you've got<br>this free speech absolutism that<br>actually is not um and so it changes<br>very much in regards to it so having<br>that really high govern government<br>interventionist element is a real shift<br>in our particular types of traditions<br>and the way that we do thing we have to<br>hold dear to it I don't think we should<br>just be reactive because we risk then<br>being reactionary and um so I think that<br>there's got to be something much more<br>responsive in this place<br>but you know there's there's much that<br>we have to do to bring people along with<br>us for people to see that it is a<br>worthwhile element in keeping I think<br>that many and you know it's one of the<br>the very annoying things about the real<br>world Notions you know what it's like to<br>live in the real world as if we don't um<br>or the Ivory Tower one I wish um you<br>know so you know around both of those<br>things around just how we create a much<br>stronger uh narrative that is<br>inclusive um of of those that can<br>benefit shift change be transformed you<br>know I always say that research should<br>be transformative and intent<br>um I don't usually say like it should be<br>I actually mean positively<br>transformative and intent um but I<br>recognize it just needs to be<br>transformative and and intent so there's<br>there's a huge amount of work for us to<br>do in that area and I think it is around<br>that accountability element the critic<br>and conscience and you know that for me<br>is the<br>lifeblood of the<br>University thank you and thanks for your<br>question Rebecca it's a very good one<br>and it does feel a bit like it's a watch<br>the space here right now um there was<br>another question that was submitted from<br>um somebody uh which I think is a really<br>good one and I we do we do still sort of<br>have 5 10 minutes left so this question<br>is what is the role of general or<br>professional staff in the exercise of<br>academic freedom and I think that's a<br>good one because increasingly we don't<br>have a division anymore if we ever did<br>between professional and academic staff<br>people span across roles so I I think<br>it's really useful to be thinking about<br>academic freedom in relation to<br>professional staff as well so I'm<br>wondering if any of our panelists have<br>any thoughts on that question we<br>certainly can't run a university without<br>them so it it it does show the<br>significance of professional staff but I<br>don't<br>know I don't know if we do do enough<br>work I I recognize that there are a lot<br>of places where those<br>roles have have you know that they they<br>encompassed both elements of<br>it but I think that you know when we<br>speak truth to power we act sometimes as<br>if the university is not powerful and we<br>have to think about how the power Works<br>within the university and where status<br>and hierarchy sits uh so I think there's<br>quite a lot of work to be done there to<br>ensure that all elements professional<br>staff academic staff um do feel that<br>I I was surprised when I read the draft<br>I I found it quite jaring that there was<br>a special category academic staff I<br>could see why but it felt quite<br>oldfashioned to me so I'd go back to the<br>point I made earlier about interrogating<br>people's evidence and I wouldn't have<br>thought it mattered what the job<br>description<br>said we do have five minutes left so I'm<br>going to take that as a real opportunity<br>because there may be somebody in the<br>audience there may be more than one<br>somebody in the audience who has a<br>pressing burning question that they<br>would like to take advantage of having<br>our panelists here with us so uh I'm<br>talking so that you have an opportunity<br>just to think about that question right<br>now to make it to make it short and<br>clear and<br>um<br>right K everybody um my question's<br>really especially Juliet's been saying<br>um so I'm John ha I'm AAL ition so it's<br>actually about statistics but um a lot<br>of people want evidencebased decisions<br>and Juliet mentioned that a couple of<br>times um and yet you get things<br>published in journals all the time that<br>use statistics but they misuse<br>statistics for sure and you know you get<br>a small P value something's highly<br>significant but the methodology was<br>totally inappropriate for for that<br>context and so people can be blinded by<br>science to some extent and so juliia get<br>idea that we we need to interrogate the<br>evidence is great but the journals don't<br>even do that properly so realistically<br>how how much weight do you give to<br>formed so I think it's about<br>consensus um and Naomi oresi writes<br>really well about this in why trust<br>science so yes Rogue studies somebody's<br>reckons dressed up with some Dody P<br>factors<br>um we should query but when there's a<br>really clear consensus then a patent<br>begins to emerge and she argues very<br>eloquently that we've missed something<br>as a scientific Community not to<br>emphasize that but something like the<br>ipcc has done it well right they've said<br>okay there's thousands of scientists<br>that agree and then these three blocks<br>in the corner that don't and so I think<br>we need to be more honest like this is<br>some preliminary data we need to check<br>or actually this study has been<br>replicated 50 times we're pretty<br>confident and lots of the incentives for<br>scientists are against doing that we're<br>encouraged to<br>overell um and I think we need to stop<br>doing that because it undermines trust<br>in the whole community so if we really<br>make a point of checking how much<br>consensus there is around a conclusion I<br>think that's that's one safeguard<br>against what you're saying or we could<br>just put the statisticians in charge of<br>deciding yeah bring it<br>um I just wanted to say that part of my<br>um you know critic and conscience work<br>has been calling out um Minister<br>Ministries government departments<br>misusing statistics and uh some shocking<br>examples from stats New Zealand of of<br>just breaking you know stats 101 rules<br>and and Publishing the data so yeah it's<br>a good point I'm I'm going to be brave<br>and go back into that previous question<br>about professional stuff but I want to<br>open it up a little bit more and say<br>there's at least three groups of people<br>within the university there are many<br>others but if I talk about academic<br>staff I talk about students and I talk<br>about people who are professional<br>employees of the University I think the<br>answer that we got before didn't pay<br>enough attention to the existence of a<br>distinction between freedom of speech<br>and academic freedom and I'd like to<br>give the panel a chance to come back to<br>that and ask themselves what's the<br>meaningful difference between those<br>things if we simply say everybody has<br>academic freedom I don't think that that<br>values the importance of what I believe<br>academic freedom critic and conscien<br>Society really means and the obligations<br>and responsibilities that fall on<br>academics in the University so I'd like<br>to hear a bit more thank<br>you so just by way of a little bit of<br>context the university as I think you<br>might know we've been working on a<br>policy led by um Professor Margaret<br>Highland and we have uh been going<br>around the traps thinking about whether<br>we need separate policies for academic<br>freedom as opposed to freedom of<br>expression the first one capturing I<br>guess a lot of what happens in in the<br>academic orbit but the other one about<br>the freedom to expressive view to<br>protest and so on and in the end we've<br>we've we've got those at the moment<br>captured in one policy but I um I think<br>this is where your question is sort of<br>sitting in relation to academic and<br>I don't think I'm going to give a a<br>really good one I I think my sort of<br>view and looking at it from the ockland<br>experience is<br>that a separation is<br>useful um just because it's so easy to<br>conflate and we've got freedom of<br>expression freedom of speech is one that<br>we have within or outside of the<br>University I have that as a as an<br>individual as you know we we have that<br>right under the particular restrictions<br>that might be in Place legal<br>restrictions whereas I think so I I<br>always think you need a preamble that<br>has that that has all of that that<br>element in but for me the academic<br>freedom element you know sort of an<br>interesting one I mean if it was called<br>academic responsibility academic<br>accountability academic something else<br>that didn't have freedom in it it might<br>be a lot more useful for us because of<br>the way that the freedom seems a free<br>for all and we know that there is no<br>place that is totally free but I I don't<br>think I'm really answering your question<br>but for me that is one of the just one a<br>foundational point that we and I<br>understand Margaret because it's been<br>such a difficult one putting them in<br>putting them out we've done the same<br>sorts of things it is really<br>tricky yeah I mean and in New Zealand at<br>least they're in different acts right so<br>there everyone's got freedom of<br>expression I I think my answer to the<br>previous question comes from my<br>background in The Sciences so there are<br>many professional staff that are doing<br>deep academic work who feel excluded<br>from the academic this academic that um<br>so they are Technical and academic<br>experts in their field and will be<br>co-authors on papers and things so I<br>think it's an arbitrary distinction um<br>which is why I think we need to<br>interrogate it Case by case but I think<br>maybe the gut reaction to that question<br>is grounded in colleagues that I've had<br>who are um deep subject matter experts<br>on a okay we'll go I think we'll we'll<br>last um I'm a lecturer in Psych um and<br>yeah I just wanted to say thank you<br>first for your conversation it's been<br>really really interesting to me um I<br>think my question comes from from we've<br>talked a lot about academic freedom in<br>terms of us as academics but I have this<br>real concern for our students um I think<br>academic freedom is super important but<br>how do we go about protecting our<br>students particularly those who are<br>minorities<br>from hate speech disguised as academic<br>freedom because personally I've<br>experienced being in a lectur and<br>sitting there and going cool okay um my<br>position is irrelevant um or that was<br>just really racist or sexist and as an<br>academic now that's something a mild<br>academic that's something I'm really<br>really concerned about in my um courses<br>even if it's from other students to our<br>minority students so I was just<br>wondering if you have any foral about<br>that sorry that's a really mean question<br>no not sorry great question thank you so<br>much I mean the emic violence and theic<br>Injustice that is still so deeply<br>embedded uh within the universities is<br>you know it's a point that I made right<br>on that very first scenario that the<br>idea that you know we have to look at<br>the way that power is and recognize that<br>the Imp the differential impact of<br>harm uh of around expression or around<br>the academic freedom is is so notice<br>notable and for many goes back<br>generations and that that that element<br>about what it means to sit in the<br>class um and I think that that U Miranda<br>Fricker's work is useful in regarding<br>particularly the emic Injustice element<br>for testimonial Injustice and<br>hermeneutic Injustice around how<br>students many students from a whole<br>range of things uh from gender sexual<br>orientation um ethnicity<br>status Soo economic have to sit into<br>class and what they actually have to be<br>subject to in a neutral<br>rational uh evidence-led way so you know<br>it's all a part of how do we become I<br>guess Nick coming back to your really<br>your first words about what what type of<br>maturity do we need as a community of<br>Scholars to be to be able to have these<br>it it does seem at the moment it's very<br>discussion okay we we we are out of time<br>uh the hour and a half has passed very<br>quickly and um it really was a privilege<br>to be able to facilitate the discussion<br>today so Bry is going to offer you a<br>more formal uh vote of thanks and it<br>wrap up but informally from me thank you<br>everybody T Koto C it's my great<br>pleasure today to extend the vote of<br>thanks uh to our panelists all of our<br>panelists who express some ambivalence<br>about being here um Juliet was tricked<br>Mike was iffy and and Tracy was prepared<br>to to sit in productive discomfort and<br>and Robin wrangled us all through 90<br>minutes of fascinating conversation so<br>so thank you for that the productive<br>discomfort framing I think is a good<br>framing for what we saw in the scenarios<br>that everybody engaged in in the first<br>scenario many people went with their gut<br>um but Tracy pulled us back and reminded<br>us to think and pause and to uphold the<br>manner of all involved in that we have<br>to think about responsible speech we<br>have to the concerns of everybody<br>involved in these conversations with an<br>eye toward understanding those par<br>dynamics that our last questioner raised<br>as well we need to be alert to powerful<br>victims always a good reminder the<br>second scenario Mike found unrealistic<br>and I am relieved that he did the idea<br>that a head of school could say no we're<br>not going to put that forward I am<br>relieved that you found that unrealistic<br>Mike thank you I feel reassured somewhat<br>and Juliet also reminded US during that<br>one that when we go with our gut we can<br>be least thoughtful about what we know<br>best and that's a great reminder for us<br>this is something that we feel<br>incredibly passionate about and we tend<br>to dive on in we're informed intelligent<br>people pause pause people slow thinking<br>is good thinking sometimes um the third<br>scenario about hosting a protest that<br>Drew us all to consider the context of<br>these questions and with regard to our<br>policy you'll note as you read through<br>that policy and I hope you are and I<br>hope you're going to make submissions to<br>it you will see that there's an awful<br>lot of it depends sort of thinking<br>because context is incredibly important<br>here in terms of policing a protest<br>$50,000 worth of extra security isn't<br>actually that much extra security and I<br>heard our CFO mutter under her breath<br>there goes the<br>budget but Tracy reminded us there to to<br>consider our responsibilities under<br>article two of TTI uh these decisions<br>that we make they have to be made uh<br>with respect and in the context of high<br>trust relationships in an environment<br>where trust is being<br>eroded but an event like this where we<br>fill a lecture theater with people who<br>are themselves filled with what Nick<br>referred to as intellectual curiosity<br>and a desire to enhance understanding<br>it's events like this that help us Shore<br>up respect that help us Shore up trust<br>and our panel<br>has helped us engage in these<br>conversations in an incredibly<br>thoughtful and passionate way thank you</p></main><footer style="margin-top: 2rem; background:
