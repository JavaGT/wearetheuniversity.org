I'm Brandon and I'm from Kura.<br>To be honest with you, in school,<br>I was quite naughty.<br>I was quite disruptive in class<br>and didn’t necessarily listen to the teacher.<br>Until I met my English teacher<br>shout out to Helen,<br>Miss Scott, because she sort of<br>gave me that beacon of hope.<br>She really emphasized the importance<br>that I go to uni. That was sort of,<br>my role model moment.<br>When I looked over, the subjects<br>they offered, I thought Business would be <br>really good to capture what I like <br>with logical thinking <br>as well as that creative side.<br>Those two things were what I was <br>really looking for in my learning journey.<br>So, when I first came to uni, it was <br>a bit of a culture shock for me.<br>You know, it was pretty funny when I <br>looked out the Business School<br>and I see the ASB tennis court right there,<br>the transition was tough no doubt, but<br>I tend to just be unapologetically myself<br>and I think that allowed me to thrive<br>in that transition.<br>So in my first year, it was a lot of fun,<br>but to be entirely honest with you,<br>I spent way too much time<br>not studying,<br>and I was sort of living my life<br>and then I lived it a bit too hard <br>and I messed around way too much.<br>So at the end of my first year,<br>I decided to get a bit more serious.<br>I really started putting myself out there.<br>That's why I started doing Talking To Locals.<br>I did Learning Through Leadership.<br>I won the Māori Business Student of the Year <br>joint winner for the Business School. <br>I did the Poetry Slam a few years back.<br>I’m configured to consider.<br>It’s recluse from the bottom <br>so it must be heaven at the top.<br>I actually got into the finals<br>but I didn’t win.<br>And at the end of my first year,<br>I was very lucky enough to have won<br>the Prime Minister's Scholarship to Asia<br>which immensely changed my life.<br>It was a whole study tour around India.<br>And that summer compared to the summer<br>before,<br>the self-belief<br>I felt was drastically different.<br>And then after my second year into my third year<br>the ball just got rolling on all these opportunities.<br>I went to Malaysia, went to China,<br>did all these other cool<br>and amazing things.<br>Overall that journey for me was really important<br>and the University’s whole support <br>system for me individually<br>has been really helpful and impactful.<br>So when I talk about<br>perhaps my career ambitions,<br>I am quite interested in utilizing<br>my International Business degree.<br>So I really want to be able to facilitate<br>some sort of trade between here <br>and another nation, <br>as long as I’m in a position where <br>I’m making purposeful work.<br>My Mum’s relationship and her aroha is<br>invaluable to me.<br>The biggest thing that she probably <br>would tell me is that<br>she’s quite proud of where I’m at.<br>As long as I’m following my passions, I feel that <br>she’d be proud of me<br>and that’s sort of what drives me <br>to continuously do more.<br>My passion to me, Nipsey Hussle said it, <br>is that the highest human act is to inspire<br>and I hope that I can achieve that<br>through whatever mahi <br>that I end up doing<br>throughout my life really.<br>Whether your path was smooth or <br>you encountered obstacles at every stage, <br>I just hope you gain one small saying away from my kōrero,<br>When one of us makes it<br>we all do.</p></main><footer style="margin-top: 2rem; background: #0001; padding: 2rem; text-align: center;"><p>We Are The University</p><ul style="list-style-type: none; padding: 0; margin: 0;"><li><a href="/">Home</a></li><li><a href="/about">About</a></li><li><a href="/contact">Contact</a></li></ul></footer></body></html>
