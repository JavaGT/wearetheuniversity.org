lectures<br>are a real treat for us they give us an<br>opportunity to learn a little about a<br>little bit about our talented academics<br>and to showcase the Excellence research<br>that occurs across the<br>university and as I've said before<br>promotion to Professor atat Taro is not<br>easily achieved and requires an academic<br>to show outstanding competence and<br>Leadership in teaching research and<br>service and Sara has demonstrated all of<br>these Sara is definitely a true ataro<br>person having received six<br>qualifications from the<br>University she's an accomplished teacher<br>and as we will shortly hear her research<br>focuses on sustainability climate change<br>and business she is part of networks and<br>collaborations with in ATA the Pacific<br>and<br>internationally and a particular<br>strength of her research is its applied<br>nature and equally important is that<br>Sara actively communicates her work not<br>just in academic journals but to The<br>Wider community and not Le least in the<br>ODT so congratulations Sara on your<br>deserved promotion I'm very much looking<br>forward to your lecture and I'd now like<br>to invite Professor Marie Ty the pro<br>Vice Chancellor of the division of<br>Commerce to provide a formal welcome to<br>an introduction to Professor Walton Nora<br>ten so Professor Nicholson<br>T

September 2<br>2023 and tonight we come together to<br>celebrate this auspicious<br>achievement Professor Walton grew up in<br>inago and attended the University of<br>atago where she completed a ba come on<br>in welcome where she completed a ba<br>majoring in anthropology and a bcom<br>majoring in management and as our vice<br>chancellor has pointed out two degrees<br>were not<br>enough and so Sara went on to do a<br>postgraduate diploma in tourism which I<br>remember fondly having been a classmate<br>with<br>Sarah which she was of of course awarded<br>distinction a postgrad certificate in<br>tertiary teaching and an mcom where she<br>was was also awarded with<br>distinction Sara then completed her PhD<br>in 2008 which was entitled contesting<br>Natures a discourse analysis of natural<br>resource conflicts This research<br>explored the discursive formations<br>involved in two environmental conflicts<br>during which organizations were not<br>permitted to carry out their proposed<br>extractive<br>activities in of logging and the<br>extension of a gold mine Sara utilized a<br>discursive analysis to review<br>stakeholder debate and concerns Within<br>These two different conflicts conf conf<br>sorry concluding the value and<br>importance of Greening and the need for<br>organizations and natural environment<br>literature to recognize the possibility<br>of multiple meanings of<br>nature Greening the environment and<br>sustainability have of course remained<br>at the Forefront of Sara's research over<br>the<br>years while completing her PhD Sara was<br>employed as a lecturer in the department<br>of management moving to a senior<br>lecturer in 2009 and then an associate<br>professor in<br>2019 before becoming full Professor last<br>year as already stated a promot motion<br>to fall professor at the University of<br>atago is not a step taken lightly you<br>must excel in all three areas of the<br>role teaching research and service<br>Professor Walton has certainly achieved<br>this over her career as an<br>academic as a leader in research on<br>carbon Footprints industry Readiness for<br>climate change Innovation for<br>environmental<br>sustainability sustainable and low<br>carbon<br>Transitions and analyzing and<br>understanding environmental conflicts<br>and<br>concerns Professor Walton has published<br>widely in academic literature as well as<br>featuring regularly in the ODT with her<br>column on sustainable<br>business professor Walton is passionate<br>about the real life application of<br>research having run or been in a team<br>member or being a team member sorry and<br>an impressive number of externally<br>funded interdisciplinary projects for<br>many years which have made impactful<br>differences to business<br>practice examples of her work include<br>the energy cultures program energy<br>transitions in<br>vanatu land use and Common Grounds at<br>mcra gold mine and work with brands on a<br>get ready for cl climate change project<br>with construction<br>companies I'm sure Sara will also inform<br>us today of her current projects which<br>include leading and Endeavor project on<br>circular<br>economy Project work with xrb on the<br>effectiveness of climate risk disclosure<br>and her collaboration with stuff New<br>Zealand in producing the climate action<br>report<br>card what is clearly striking about<br>Sara's research is its impact the impact<br>upon consumers businesses and society as<br>a whole Sara regularly appears in local<br>and National media and engages with<br>organizations such as rotary New Zealand<br>research Professor Walter not only<br>exceeds at research but is an<br>experienced and outstanding teacher<br>having taught across all levels<br>including ba and Executive<br>Education professor's Walt Walton's<br>teaching is extremely well received by<br>students she is an excellent<br>communicator and innovator of teaching<br>material having received excellent<br>feedback and teaching accolades across<br>and throughout her teaching<br>career Professor Walton leads course<br>design and development and was<br>instrumental in developing and<br>establishing the master of sustainable<br>business both on campus and dist<br>a program which has gone from strength<br>to strength over the last eight years<br>she also developed the minor in<br>sustainable business another<br>sought-after course for the atago<br>business<br>school Professor Walton has an<br>impressive supervision profile and I<br>know as a passionate supervisor of many<br>PhD and DBA students as well as master<br>of Commerce master of sustainable<br>business master of business and MBA<br>student<br>students Professor Walton's service<br>commitments have been wide reaching ac<br>across the management department the<br>division of Commerce and the<br>university Professor Walton has been<br>associate Dean research

to many boards organizations<br>and businesses across the<br>motto that is just a it of the career of<br>Professor Walton so far and I know we<br>are going to learn a lot more this<br>evening from the professor<br>herself I have been extremely fortunate<br>to work with Sarah for a number of years<br>Sarah's<br>commitment to people first is evident in<br>everything she does she has been<br>instrumental in in driving our<br>divisional strategy and importantly<br>ensuring that people feel included in<br>its<br>development Sara demands us to be<br>accountable for our actions or the<br>actions we don't take and this is clear<br>in her internationally recognized<br>culture change<br>research<br>agenda however Sara also demands that<br>people are listened to that they are<br>involved in decisions and that the<br>impact people can make in decisions are<br>recognized I thoroughly enjoy working<br>with Sarah I feel very fortunate to have<br>her by my side I admire her values and<br>her work ethic and thank her for her<br>support and her<br>guidance many of you know already that<br>Sara has not only been working hard over<br>the past few weeks or months on this IPL<br>as well as all the various day-to-day<br>tasks she continues to manage but she<br>has been training for the root bur<br>classic which is an adventure run over<br>the root bur track I'm not sure how an<br>Adventure Run and root bur track can<br>actually be used<br>together slog climb grunt but run 32<br>kilomet of hard grind I would say and<br>it's happening this<br>Saturday Saturday<br>Sara so let's get Sara up here so she<br>can complete her IPL and get back to her<br>training I'm absolutely delighted and<br>privileged to be able to warmly welcome<br>Professor Sara Walton to give her an<br>augural prophal lecture<br>Kaa Tena T um<br>C sorry that was supposed to be off at<br>the same time I remember to do that<br>someone's not doing it for me<br>um thank you all um for being here today<br>this is obviously quite overwhelming and<br>nerve-wracking and I haven't been sure<br>all week which is going to be more<br>nerve-racking this or um The Challenge<br>in the weekend right now it feels like<br>this but but when I finish I'm sure<br>it'll be the weekend thank you um to uh<br>Dr katai um Professor<br>Nicholson um and uh Professor Ty for<br>your introductions and um and Professor<br>Campbell for your thank you at the end<br>no doubt um I'm actually starting where<br>people normally finish um these lectures<br>so normally we finish with<br>acknowledgements um but I really wanted<br>to um to start because I don't stand<br>here as doing all this work by myself I<br>stand here because I've had lots of<br>people who have been helping support and<br>work with me over the years and some of<br>these are pictured here and some of<br>people are also be talking about um<br>during the talk today so I just wanted<br>to start with a bit of a shout out um to<br>the many people um that I've worked with<br>Plus plus I just wanted to acknowledge<br>um My Brother David and his wife<br>Katherine online hello this is where I'm<br>not going to get emotional hello Lan<br>James and Patrick hello to my cake club<br>members it's best club to have cake club<br>and my book club friends um as well also<br>to my friends Cari and Michelle my dear<br>friends from my University days who are<br>also um online um thank you for coming<br>my Southern Youth Development team it's<br>lovely to see you here and also to Jimmy<br>and and I hope this goes<br>okay um and finally obviously a special<br>shout out um to my family my mom online<br>with Rufus hi Mom and my Dad um who<br>passed away three years ago plus also to<br>my sons um Ben and Matt and my husband<br>and Peter who think that I love my phone<br>and my job more than them but clearly I<br>don't now another reason for putting<br>this up at the start is is that you all<br>now know who they are which means that<br>they can't leave and they're going to be<br>lectured to for 40 minutes by their mom<br>so that was my um my main no not really<br>my main motivation anyway there's lots<br>of people here and as I said I'll be<br>talking about them um<br>throughout okay one of the earliest um<br>public environmental conflicts in Alo<br>New Zealand um and one of our most<br>famous ones was the save um manapot<br>campaign around building the electric um<br>Hydro Dam on the lake now the initial um<br>proposal was to raise the lake levels by<br>10<br>m<br>264,000 people signed a petition against<br>raising the lake by 10 m um at that<br>point back in the day New Zealand had<br>2.8 million people and there were about<br>1 million people in the South Ireland so<br>it was a pretty significant um petition<br>um that went to Parliament the final<br>decision Revisited the original plans<br>and only raised the lake by 2 m so that<br>was the result of these protests and um<br>and the petition in<br>1973 the Guardians of the lake was<br>established to monitor lake and river<br>levels associated with the<br>dam and 1973 was also Monumental for me<br>because I arrived in altero New Zealand<br>from England um this is me on the way<br>and this is me with my family in inago<br>they came all the way from um England to<br>inago with our dog chimo um dogs are<br>always um uh part of our our Faro really<br>and so quite appropriate for me to have<br>chimo there too so that was considered a<br>bit of an adventure we came out in a um<br>in a boat all the way um from the UK and<br>I'm very happy that we did and most of<br>you know I'm a very proud um<br>kiwi okay but back to um to conflicts<br>and as Marie has um has already alluded<br>to my PhD was around environmental<br>conflicts and this was me in graduation<br>day another reason you can't leave the<br>lecture bin um and I was really<br>interested in these because it seemed<br>that the environment had won and these<br>particular conflicts and so what I<br>wanted to do was um to actually explore<br>those reasons um behind so this was<br>actually my research question I used a<br>discourse Theory um analysis to<br>understand what were the conditions of<br>possibility that enabled these<br>sustainable Beach proposals and um and<br>the proposal to extend the glob Hill<br>mine and refton to be turned down and<br>what I ended up looking at were two sort<br>of dominant discourses that were<br>happening at the time the first um came<br>from a lot of more of the local<br>community and some of the um Foresters<br>was around this notion of being able to<br>manage nature okay and this is part of<br>the sustainable logging scheme the<br>second one um uh which got termed um<br>well I guess part of the greeny was more<br>around protecting nature and this um<br>discourse was quite um clever in the way<br>in which it operated and particularly in<br>the way in which it managed to negate<br>the local or or um managing nature<br>discourse um to disestablish um that<br>position from being seen as credible so<br>for example our um prime minister at the<br>time Helen Clark was on TV and called<br>the West coasters feral so it meant that<br>that it started to negate their position<br>of being able to um actually H you know<br>say something legitimate around this<br>notion around sustainable logging so I I<br>looked at these the way these discourses<br>interacted and and how they actually um<br>were able to to create a certain um way<br>of defining and talking about nature<br>that actually became the dominant way<br>that we wanted um to think about it so<br>um since then the that I've developed um<br>from that I also um used to uh in a more<br>recent study with mccrae's mine um an<br>Oceana gold so not far up the road about<br>an hour up the road and this was with Dr<br>Jeff foot who's somewhere I think in the<br>audience um and we um we we were uh we<br>spent a day sort of talking with mcra<br>and we um interviewed lots of<br>stakeholders and partners around um the<br>mine and looked at um their views of<br>land use<br>um and and similarly we found kind of<br>similar aspects coming through to the<br>earlier study around this notion of<br>conservation um and preservation and<br>this was taken from the mccrae's mine<br>website um that talked a little bit<br>about how that study has started to<br>influence the way in which they interact<br>um with their<br>stakeholders okay but how did I get here<br>how did I get to be um interested in the<br>environment and be um studying um and<br>get to my to my PhD so as um uh Marie<br>has mentioned I came to University from<br>inago I was the first in my family to<br>come to University I studied a ba in<br>anthropology and a bom in management and<br>then I decided um that I'd quite like to<br>sort of change that and do a<br>postgraduate um diploma in tourism and<br>my dissertation was on perceptions of<br>crowding on the Kepler track at the time<br>I worked for what was um field and<br>travel I think it's now n z um and mford<br>sound and every day off I spent handing<br>out surveys on the Kepler track to<br>understand perceptions of crowding the<br>reason why I did that research was<br>because I went and knocked on the door<br>of Doc and said I'm came to do some<br>research on the keep the track what do<br>you need to know and they said well<br>we're really worried about crowding so<br>can you go and find out what's happening<br>with crowding interestingly enough when<br>I came back to UNI um a page a few pages<br>had been ripped out of that dissertation<br>in the library and so the library was<br>super that I was back to able to um to<br>get their copy of my dissertation back<br>in one piece again but then I did find<br>out also from anak car who's not here<br>today but um she was telling me that she<br>constantly still um cites this work<br>which is kind of mindblowing really that<br>you do a small study um handing out<br>surveys but yet the way in which has<br>thought about um crowding and<br>particularly around the Huts as opposed<br>to being on the tracks actually started<br>to change um the way doc was um doing<br>things so that was quite<br>interesting then I had a few Gap years<br>and I have put that one up there for you<br>to laugh um because we went to um<br>Edinburgh so um Pedro and I um met at<br>the Christ Church Park Royal and um<br>where we both worked and then um we<br>headed uh overseas and that um mainly um<br>spending time in Edinburgh and the<br>Shetland Islands as well as um traveling<br>around when I came back um from these<br>Gap years I really wanted um to study<br>again I'd really enjoyed studying and as<br>those who know me um I actually wasn't<br>very good at working um in businesses<br>because once I figured out how they<br>operated I then got a little bit bored<br>and wanted to go on and do something<br>else so um Peter tells me I'm never<br>allowed to leave this job because it it<br>means that I can go and study different<br>businesses at different times so I<br>looked around at the time and um what<br>was available and advertised on the<br>paper was a teaching assistant and the<br>management department at the University<br>of atago so that was actually what um<br>brought me back that position involved<br>20 hours teaching and 20 hours on my<br>masters and I decided to explore the<br>notion of career in a changing world of<br>work when I finished that I was offered<br>a lecturing position with one of the<br>conditions um to be enrolled in a PhD<br>and I had thought that I would continue<br>um studying career and perhaps take a<br>more critical perspective on Career but<br>no two things happened um to Change My<br>Mind One was a study with um Shane GCE<br>and Bavon catley now no longer um at<br>aago and it was around about the<br>controversy surrounding the um<br>Announcement by DB to close the Monti<br>Brewery on the west<br>coast there was quite a significant<br>public outcry and a a public boycott of<br>um of monse at the time and we thought<br>that was quite interesting how a company<br>made a decision in an Oakland office and<br>literally they did because we spoke to<br>them about a number of different<br>livelihoods on the west coast with<br>thinking that there would be no<br>repercussions of that um decision but<br>obviously they hadn't spent any time on<br>the west coast because we would know<br>that there would be some pretty big<br>repercussions making a decision like<br>that so we were really interested in how<br>that um that kind of happened and we<br>developed teaching cases um and articles<br>from um understanding that we even had<br>the two leaders of the boycott come and<br>talk to the class one of whom was the<br>infamous photographer Peter Bush so we<br>spent a a fantastic night um talking to<br>him he h quite a well-known photographer<br>of<br>rugby um so that was one thing the<br>second thing um was Diane Ru you got a<br>Diane she's online um and I developed a<br>400 level paper called organizations and<br>the natural environment and I decided to<br>have a guest lecture from Professor<br>Marcus Mo now if any of you remember Mar<br>marus moan and some of you here W Marcus<br>didn't suffer fools lightly so I was<br>going to meet with Marcus and I was like<br>okay really got to know what I'm talking<br>about when I go and meet him so I've got<br>to read his papers and then read out<br>what this topic means so when I go in I<br>don't look like an idiot and what I<br>found was that I actually really enjoyed<br>it um I obviously enjoyed his work and<br>um and enjoyed this notion of<br>sustainability reporting and um and what<br>companies were doing and looking at how<br>they were talking about what they were<br>doing<br>so um this led to um quite a bit of work<br>with Kate Kens who's now at aut and<br>Helen tra who's now at um Holloway and<br>London as well so um we spent quite a<br>bit of time analyzing some of the early<br>reporters um in Al and at that stage<br>things weren't tremendously great as<br>this graph shows we um we evaluated the<br>reports on many different aspects and<br>you can see here that many were putting<br>in the no disclosures so many companies<br>were not really talking that much about<br>what it was um that they were doing we<br>were also quite critical of them as you<br>can see by um the comment I've just put<br>um there around the fact that there was<br>a lot of things missing from the report<br>and in fact indeed sadly I'd probably be<br>quite critical around equity and social<br>justice um to this day about how they're<br>dealt with by many of our organizations<br>particularly in the<br>reporting a couple of things that we<br>also looked at um one was we looked at<br>how they were talking about<br>sustainability and we talked about um<br>this notion of a journey and that's in<br>the paper creating Adventures in<br>Wonderland organizations were talking a<br>lot about the Journey of sustainability<br>but were really talk really talking<br>about what the destination was so we<br>didn't actually really know where they<br>were going so it's all very well to be<br>on a journey but if you have a journey<br>without an endo we don't really know<br>what that is so there's a lot of<br>language being used to diffuse what<br>organizations were actually doing<br>um and the other point there was um that<br>we also Lo decided that organizations<br>were translating sustainability for Eco<br>efficiency so these Core Concepts that<br>we might think about as being related to<br>sustainability what actually just talked<br>about is how to do better with um with<br>less in terms of Eco efficiency so we<br>organizations so when I finished my um<br>pay D I decided that I wanted to embark<br>on an area that was a bit more positive<br>and a way and trying to look at what<br>organizations were doing and and at that<br>time um jodianne Kirkwood who was a<br>colleague who not long finished her PhD<br>and and around um entrepreneurs and we<br>thought it' be interesting there was<br>this um new sort of topic being talked<br>about called ecopreneurs to actually<br>start to think about what this notion of<br>an ecopreneur or an environment<br>entrepreneur was in<br>Al so we found um we did a number of<br>different case studies we did interviews<br>we did a nationwide surveys so we got<br>together quite a bit of data as you can<br>see from this page here so they often<br>our ecopreneurs had quite similar<br>motivations to um more General um<br>entrepreneurs but we found that they had<br>a lower level of financial motivation<br>they talked more about earning a living<br>talked more about lifestyle or providing<br>for their family but they had a really<br>strong commitment to the environment and<br>in our survey we wanted to test that<br>commitment and ask them at what level of<br>um a financial um uh cost would they<br>change their environmental commitment<br>and most of them put they never would so<br>even we went through a th000 10,000 all<br>that they would like no the whole reason<br>for their business was about being green<br>and getting rid of that was like a<br>bottom going against their bottom line<br>so that was kind of quite interesting in<br>some of those initial studies that we<br>did um quite some time ago<br>now I um continued to look at<br>environmental entrepreneurs in um<br>different<br>contexts one of the contexts I I was<br>lucky enough um to be introduced to by<br>Brendan gray was a woman in business in<br>sour and this I guess has started a<br>relationship with sore that I will<br>continue um this year um as well through<br>the National University of sore um we<br>were lucky enough to spend some time in<br>some more and um you can see there that<br>field work was done with with the whole<br>um far now so that that was pretty um<br>pretty uh normal for us all to go and um<br>and visit many different Farms so woman<br>and business um runs over 300 Organic<br>Farms across all of um sore they<br>possibly could be called um family and<br>business rather than just woman because<br>it's extended to be this sort of Faro um<br>unit they do a variety of different<br>things and the pictures I have here<br>around the taper cloth and the fine<br>matte weaving as well as over here these<br>are actually um cocoa beans um it's it's<br>quite a delicacy to suck those cocoa<br>beans um apparently they um very nice<br>but what they are quite well known for<br>is selling their virgin coconut oil um<br>to the body shop and that was one of<br>their really um big contracts when I was<br>there so I spent a number of weeks<br>trying to understand their business<br>model and how they integrated their<br>aspects of culture with um<br>sustainability and um and I produced the<br>um model up the top there to look at<br>them other context in which I'm looking<br>at environmental entrepreneurship is in<br>the circular economy and this is one of<br>the current projects that we have<br>working at the moment so a circular<br>economy as opposed to a more linear one<br>a linear one that moves us through from<br>taking um resources to um waste through<br>the various different use phases to a<br>more circular one that keeps those<br>resources in an action so it's not about<br>creating waste it's about eliminating um<br>waste so through our M art which is a MB<br>funed project out of the University of w<br>been looking at how to bring about<br>systemic change um to create a circular<br>economy for the well-being of<br>Al now I use a really messy model to<br>think about that systemic change and<br>this is it here this is my theory<br>slide um so this is called um the<br>multi-level um<br>perspective and I'm really interested in<br>looking at how our entrepreneurs<br>actually can bring about systemic change<br>because that's what most of them<br>actually want when you talk to um<br>environmental and social entrepreneurs<br>they want they change makers they want<br>to bring about change to the system it's<br>a it's one of the key drivers as well of<br>their organization it's why they're<br>being green it's why they're so<br>passionate um about it now this diagram<br>has three different levels at the bottom<br>we have the niche which is where we have<br>all our Innovations bubbling away this<br>is where I place our entrepreneurial<br>actors in the system um they have<br>different innovations that they're<br>bringing to the system the main part of<br>our system is What's called the regim<br>which is that bit in the middle and this<br>is the way in which we have our policy<br>we have our culture our Market industry<br>science and that's our businesses usual<br>and that's really slow to change and it<br>has to be slow to change because we<br>can't keep changing the way we operate<br>Society every two minutes we' even that<br>would be a bit bit of Anarchy really um<br>so but we need it to change quite<br>quickly at the moment and I'll come to<br>that as we go through it and then at the<br>top we have our big landscape which is<br>our big way that Society likes to um to<br>think and we actually actually need to<br>see those changes at all those levels to<br>shift the way in which we do things and<br>so we've been using that to understand<br>if we want to have circular economy for<br>the well-being of oura then we need to<br>look at all of those different levels<br>and how they're operating my focus at<br>the moment and um my wether works on<br>this with me as well which we've been<br>looking at is is down in that sort of<br>those those Niche and thinking about how<br>it is that the niche interact across<br>those different levels um to bring about<br>um<br>change so a couple of examples um of<br>thinking about change and one is um from<br>my work with um Sid and they're looking<br>at the diagram now I can see them and<br>the other um is is here um an<br>organization that Maru and I visited<br>recently called critical um in Oakland<br>critical um are taking and in the back<br>of that picture you can see sort of a<br>net they're taking taking old fishing<br>nets breaking them down and producing<br>the plastic and you can see the bit of<br>plastic that they produced on there when<br>you go into b&amp;z have a look at their new<br>um new sort of tops their bench tops in<br>um in their countertops they'll be<br>bright a bright blue color they're from<br>um fishing nets as well and they're from<br>critical design so they're managing to<br>take this plastic and it doesn't matter<br>they're not um worried about it being<br>mixed plastic and breaking it down and<br>produce producing new material um from<br>that they're actually taking old Vapes<br>and breaking them down and producing<br>another type of material from from Vapes<br>because we know that some of the<br>disposable Vapes AR pretty good so it<br>was really impressive um to to have a<br>look around that organization again<br>these are our entrepreneurs bubbling<br>bubbling away at the bottom the other um<br>example I have here is from Sid what<br>happens to our bikes when we throw them<br>away and these are really good questions<br>what happens to our goods and um when we<br>throw them away well a number of bikes<br>end up in the denan landfill every year<br>and one of the things that Sid does is<br>to take these bikes and and um most of<br>them well perhaps a number of them<br>anyway we'd want to be hopeful with most<br>of them we can actually fix up and then<br>provide back to um families um for free<br>so to help um people across denen um be<br>able to have a bike some of them are<br>taken apart and used for um to different<br>parts this is kind of taking that waste<br>out of the system but what we really<br>need for a circular economy and what we<br>need when we're thinking about Shifting<br>the system is actually to try and<br>eliminate that waste at the start we<br>need our bicycle manufacturers to think<br>when they're designing a bike how that<br>will be taken apart at the end of its<br>life not being taken at the landfall and<br>um and been wonderfully looked after by<br>Sid but no I'm sorry s of Southern Youth<br>Development formerly malcam I forgot to<br>mention that um but yeah so we need to<br>have that and the design phase um and<br>that's why it's really important for us<br>to take the systemic View look at how<br>that system um is operating and I'm very<br>excited about the work that my PhD<br>student Gavin um will be doing to look<br>at that ecosystem and understand that<br>change okay now that leads me to another<br>Branch um of my study to start was it<br>wider studies to start to understand how<br>organizations um bring about change so<br>in amongst taking the system as approach<br>I also wanted to look at that<br>organizational level and 2013 I joined<br>the energy cultures team led by<br>Professor Janet Stevenson um and I was<br>working on the area of energy cultures<br>um and business this is a really simple<br>yet a really powerful framework to start<br>to understand um Behavior our energy<br>Behavior across individuals across<br>businesses across um countries um and<br>across regions so we can start to break<br>that down by looking at these three<br>different elements<br>and what I say it is really simple but<br>it's incredibly powerful when we start<br>to look at the Dynamics um between these<br>different aspects so this framework over<br>here talks about the energy practices<br>the things that people do talks about<br>the Norms or the ways that people think<br>and the material culture the things that<br>people have and if you think about that<br>those three things help to create your<br>particular um Behavior so if you think<br>about how you heat your house depends on<br>what it is that you have your material<br>culture it depends on your energy<br>practices I teach this a bit with<br>students have heard a lot about the free<br>hour of power kind of things um and um<br>and it depends on the way that you think<br>do expect to be warm in your house so<br>this can be used in lots of different<br>ways and my role of oops I've gone the<br>wrong way and the energy cultures was to<br>try and look at this within businesses<br>so I started looking<br>Ates and trying to understand but at<br>that St stage and about 2013 and 2014<br>smes weren't too worried about energy<br>because the price wasn't much of a<br>concern for them so it was quite<br>difficult to start engaging with them so<br>I turned um and looked at a number of<br>case studies that had already been<br>produced and tried to look at the<br>different ways in which they had um<br>talked about what it is that they had<br>done and developed um energy cultures so<br>I looked at those different ways in<br>which they started to develop<br>capabilities for particular energy eco<br>innovations that they had undertaken um<br>to develop uh what we might call<br>Strategic capabilities in the<br>organization and I had these three um<br>different models here um that came out<br>of that work an important finding from<br>this work was that an understanding to<br>create a strategic um capability was<br>that all three elements actually needed<br>um to be operating so you needed to have<br>the material culture the practices and<br>the Norms operating in a dynamic system<br>to align and create a competitive<br>Advantage so if you're just going to<br>change a technology in a workplace that<br>often didn't result in creating any<br>strategic capabilities for competitive<br>Advantage because people carried on with<br>the same practices and the same way of<br>thinking so really within an<br>organization we needed to shift all<br>three of those um to see that change and<br>to work towards um more um<br>sustainability so the energy cultures<br>framework was a very powerful way um to<br>start to look at how organizations were<br>doing that within um embedded embedding<br>aspects within their<br>organization the energy cultures<br>framework I've got has got has also<br>enabled me to connect my research with<br>teaching and real world problems before<br>the recent legislative changes to rental<br>housing some of the student Flats in<br>North deden were notorious for their<br>poor condition at the time the<br>sustainable cities group at the<br>Wellington School of Medicine had<br>developed a a rental housing warrant of<br>Fitness so I developed an assignment for<br>my 300 level class that involved<br>students doing a warrant of Fitness on<br>their flat measuring temperatures with<br>an eye button for around um we tried to<br>have them for two to three weeks and<br>also analyzing their own um energy<br>culture this um here depicts that energy<br>cultures the key things that we found um<br>from students and probably most of that<br>is not particularly um surprising to you<br>some of the minimum temperatures were a<br>little surprising though um and um some<br>of the failures on the on the warrant of<br>Fitness um were as<br>well this of course was quite topical<br>but I was also really conscious that it<br>wasn't great advertising for the<br>University um and a number of people<br>told me that and while I'm smiling in<br>that<br>picture um I obviously the data is not<br>much to smile about the second article<br>the students not to blame for poor Flats<br>I actually wrote in the airport um in a<br>really bad mood I read the ODT some of<br>lots of my stuff is done because I'll<br>get annoyed I read this ODT article<br>where the OA guy was um had a spray<br>bottle and said students if you've got<br>mold you just need to spray it and get<br>rid of it and I was like what what are<br>you talking about um and uh and so I<br>wrote the students are not just to blame<br>for their um for their poor flats and so<br>you can see they do not blame students<br>for The Moldy state of their flats this<br>is a multistakeholder um situation so I<br>literally went and sent it off and it<br>got um got published and I actually got<br>a bit of a reputation standing up to a<br>few landlords as well um at that point<br>on a more positive note using the um on<br>the energy cultures um I was part of a<br>team conducting a program evaluation um<br>of an Australian aid program which was<br>around um shifting um Lighting in<br>Vanuatu from kerosene um to solar This<br>was um funded by um oade so we spent two<br>weeks um in country and Vanuatu has 84<br>Islands so we tried to travel to a few<br>Islands but not all 84 and we um<br>conducted interviews and focus groups<br>and Villages um across um<br>vanatu the shift from um kerosene to<br>solar had been incredibly rapid um in<br>vanu and everywhere we went people just<br>wanted to buy more solar lamps we did<br>expect that that could be because they<br>were breaking but actually they weren't<br>and the um people in Van were also<br>learning how to fix them themselves um<br>so we found very little lamps in<br>landfall which we were pretty sort of um<br>impressed with but we really wanted to<br>understand why this transition had<br>happened so um so quickly um so rapidly<br>and why because it was easy so not a<br>great answer really to back to<br>Australian age but it was really about<br>the ease of use so when we started to<br>analyze that through the um energy<br>cultures framework we could see that the<br>material culture was really easy to use<br>you just put it outside and charge it up<br>and when you needed it you pressed a<br>button well that had kerosene lights so<br>as you can see here that you didn't just<br>press a button to get your kerosene<br>light um to work it made their everyday<br>practices much easier things like<br>getting up in the middle of the night to<br>into children you could just put on your<br>solar light and off you went student uh<br>children could do their homework at<br>night with a solar light people could<br>continue working um in the evening um as<br>well and doing other chores if they're<br>out in the gardens they can use the<br>solar lights to come back<br>again it also um aligned much easier<br>with some of their Norms in a<br>subsistence economy so constantly having<br>to find money to buy kerosene caused a<br>lot of tension um and amongst family<br>units so made it easier to not have to<br>continuously buy um kerosene as well so<br>again we saw the power of the energy<br>cultures framework to try and look at<br>the different um elements that come<br>together in order to bring about um a<br>rapid transformation and an energy um<br>shift I'm now using the energy cultures<br>framework in a slightly different way to<br>look at climate cultures in the<br>construction um industry this is a<br>project funded by Brands the building<br>research Association New Zealand and<br>I've been working with Andrea Foley um<br>and um kazimir um McGregor on this and<br>again using the um energy cultures<br>framework to start to understand<br>Readiness for climate change in the<br>construction um industry Readiness as a<br>concept and an organization has not<br>often been studied around complex issues<br>it's often studied around Readiness for<br>organizational changes and restructure<br>but not necessarily around an<br>organization getting ready for climate<br>change so the energy cultures frame<br>helps to talk and Pull Apart those<br>different elements that we see across<br>organizations starting to embed climate<br>change um in their<br>organization what is quite interesting<br>about this and I was kind of a little<br>annoyed about it at the time but I'm<br>kind of getting over it now is that it<br>seemed to be the key leverage point to<br>bring about change was in the values and<br>the way that people were thinking but<br>actually that's quite an important<br>finding because the way we think is<br>actually starting to bring about the<br>change into how we change our practices<br>and change our material culture and<br>bring about that Readiness for climate<br>change so it does indicate that we<br>actually need to strongly think about<br>how we create those mindsets and ways of<br>Shifting um people's thinking um in this<br>area and that leads me um to climate<br>change and um and perhaps one of the key<br>focuses of my current research process<br>and it's been a great experience to<br>co-lead and develop heon with associate<br>professor Smith having been involved in<br>um its previous form oet um and I think<br>Colin is here as well somewhere I can't<br>see him right now um where we C<br>ourselves in those early days the<br>zealots but it is was an amazing network<br>of um of people across and it still has<br>an amazing Network and I can see many of<br>you here um across the university and<br>that interdisciplinary of this<br>incredibly complex issue is one of the<br>things that I've really valued from<br>being a member of this um<br>Network in alar we have two Targets or<br>nationally determined<br>contributions one of these is in 2030<br>and that's less than six years away so<br>it's not very long for us to meet the<br>target our single biggest emitters are<br>businesses if they reduce their<br>emissions and become climate aligned a<br>significant decarbonization transition<br>can occur but the issue is how we know<br>if they're actually reducing setting<br>appropriate targets and have integrity<br>in this decarbonization process and this<br>brings me to the work last year that was<br>published in stuff that I worked with<br>aloise Gibson and Rebecca Mills um and a<br>couple of other judges to evaluate what<br>our companies are saying and doing<br>around their um carbon<br>emissions we used and we developed a<br>framework based upon International best<br>practice that looks at impact<br>transparency an alignment of what<br>organizations were saying and then we<br>evaluated about 13 different<br>organizations um this was really well<br>actually well received by business I did<br>wonder that we might have quite a bit of<br>backlash at the time um and got prepared<br>to turn my emails off but um we actually<br>had the opposite we had companies saying<br>we want to be part of your evaluation um<br>in the future um even though many of<br>these weren't um particularly all<br>looking um very green on this report<br>right now Andrea and I have been<br>analyzing to do um the next round um and<br>I've been um looking at developing what<br>I'm calling the climate action tracker<br>alaro that I want to release um shortly<br>um which will start evaluating on an<br>annual basis what our companies um are<br>saying or doing this is just an example<br>from The Net Zero um website that we're<br>using um to base again a similar thing<br>um base ours on this with a traffic<br>light kind of system and a bit of a blur<br>about each um<br>organization and we've um submitted an<br>MB application to try and see if we can<br>get some funding um to do that we really<br>want to do two things with this one is<br>to help companies um and the other is<br>really to hold companies to account for<br>what they're saying and doing um around<br>their<br>emissions in a similar vein um I'm also<br>working on a project led by um Dr<br>Sebastian gica who I think is here<br>somewhere I saw him before and we're<br>focusing on the newly mandated climate<br>risk disclosures um and La the end of<br>last year we interviewed 20 companies to<br>understand how they're making sense of<br>climate risk in relation to um their<br>organizational practices those of you<br>who know my research um analysis process<br>know that it's um very qualitative and<br>it's um full of lots of spider diagrams<br>so I thought well I might as well just<br>put that up there because that's how I<br>operate but this model um well this<br>diagram here is my view very early<br>qualitative um analysis and you can see<br>the word risk as being incredibly<br>Central um there um and there's more um<br>results to come in the area so but as<br>well as researching what's happening in<br>the reporting space I'm part of a group<br>looking at more nature-based solutions<br>with Janice Lord and um and Victoria<br>kahoy and we've had a wonderful um<br>summer student where we've been looking<br>at what a um what a possible<br>biodiversity credit scheme would look<br>like in an agricultural setting this is<br>based upon our previous research um<br>where we interviewed Farmers um we and<br>we saw considerable potential there for<br>the agricultural sector to take<br>advantage of biodiversity that is often<br>currently perceived as not having um<br>great value on a productive um farm so<br>biodiversity credits will offer an<br>Avenue for the agriculture sector to<br>develop rent from good farming practice<br>that we saw coming through in our good<br>um farmer um article and of course we'll<br>form nature-based um solutions for<br>climate change it's also another way to<br>start to resolve some of those issues<br>mentioned and coming through in my PhD<br>across conservation and preservation um<br>conflicts and<br>finally nearly there boys um I just want<br>to finish with us pondering the future<br>much of sustainability and climate<br>change is future oriented yet most of<br>our current systems operate on very<br>short um term orientation we need to<br>create future imaginaries that encourage<br>us to think about plausible futures um<br>so we can plan now um to work towards<br>them and again these future imaginaries<br>help people think about what the world<br>might be like and shift the way that<br>people think um going back to our energy<br>cultures framework so it probably all<br>sounds a little idealistic but we really<br>do need to walk backwards into the<br>future and together with Paula aaine and<br>Diane rufu we've been developing<br>scenarios and we did our best to really<br>share those um in the public domain to<br>initiate conversations on what um the<br>future might hold Co off also offered us<br>the opportunity to think about more<br>flexible working practices working from<br>home and thinking about more outcomes<br>based opportunities um for workers and<br>of course also the opportunity to have a<br>bit of a reset but I actually won't say<br>anything more about that and develop a<br>society and this is really important to<br>me because it's all too easy with the<br>work that I do around climate change in<br>particular to get in a doom and gloom<br>mindset and the topic and these<br>particular topics but I remain<br>optimistic I think that human beings<br>we're quite clever and we can do things<br>um I think we can create a better world<br>obviously it might be uncomfortable<br>getting there but we have to for our<br>to<br>the ocean put so in our veins the

as a professor a mark of<br>Honor from the institution in which you<br>have worked so tirelessly for it is only<br>right that we give her this tou of<br>appreciation and respect from some of<br>those you have guided for decades she<br>has dedicated her work to serving and<br>fighting on behalf of the fina those who<br>have gone before her and those that will<br>come after Sara's Fier advocacy for the<br>environment and those that she works for<br>and with is direct unrelenting and<br>impactful<br>thank<br>you um Sarah actively Works to uplift<br>the voices of Tanga Rah and TOA alike<br>not only has SAR spent her career<br>educating others but she continues to<br>seek development and growth<br>yourself Sarah shows deep empathy and<br>fervent passion in her leadership um of<br>others uh and serves as a pillar of<br>support for those around her uh we hope<br>that this Tonga um serves you and your<br>Foo as a tangible reminder of the<br>significant impact that you have had and<br>will continue to have on others we hope<br>this Tonga will give you strength um<br>courage and certainty that you can face<br>anything that's yet to<br>come um if anyone else wants to um add<br>anything it's all about uh transferring<br>of our Modi our good intention um to<br>this Tonga so that Sara can draw on that<br>later um so if anybody else has anything<br>to add you're welcome<br>too I know it's stressful that's okay<br>a it's been a long time coming and uh<br>sorry<br>um just like to say I know your father<br>would love to been here<br>M Christine thanks for um tuning in from<br>the UK and David as well we were a small<br>family um we're extremely proud of you<br>thank<br>youy<br>you<br>congratulations thank you tell you doing<br>this thank you so proud of you thank<br>that my<br>grand I forgot I had the mic on I had to<br>make<br>light um Nam thank you so much that is<br>um absolutely beautiful um thank you um<br>peder and thank you very much I am lost<br>for words thank<br>you time to sit<br>down<br>much my name is Hugh Campbell I don't I<br>think I only had one instruction from<br>Sarah and that was don't upstage me uh<br>yes I that that was absolutely amazing<br>and uh what a<br>moment um I have just a few words to say<br>to round off this event<br>even in challenging<br>times there are things that happen at<br>universities that are an Ambiguously<br>good<br>things tonight is one of those kinds of<br>occasions an inaugural prophal lecture<br>is many things it's a right of passage a<br>celebration and a moment of learning<br>it's a right of passage for the person<br>involved and Sarah you'll be very glad<br>to have got this<br>done it's a celebration for a community<br>because no successful academic scaled<br>the Heights on their own but it's also a<br>moment of learning a rare opening of the<br>portal when we see the full scope of<br>what our colleagues have been up to and<br>have a chance to learn from their<br>Journey I'm very honored to be invited<br>to deliver the response to your lecture<br>tonight to complete the right of passage<br>to celebrate with this community and to<br>continue learning from this wonderful<br>person<br>a long time ago in a year that both of<br>us uh shall not name a newly minted<br>lecturer in the department of management<br>knocked on my door and asked if I might<br>be available to supervise her PhD it was<br>Miss Sarah<br>Walton this was by the standards of the<br>time an unusual request having a PhD<br>supervisor located somewhere on the<br>Wilder fringes of the social sciences<br>wasn't the normal course of action for<br>Commerce lecturers over 20 years ago<br>possibly still isn't<br>I was Keen to take on what would be my<br>first primary supervision of a PhD<br>student after the first meeting I<br>concluded she seemed sane smart and had<br>already thought about her topic three<br>qualities that are not to be<br>underestimated in a starting PhD<br>student she wanted to conduct research<br>at the interface of social theory<br>environmental sustainability Transitions<br>and the politics of going green in a<br>region dominated by traditional<br>extractive<br>industry I learned a lot from my first<br>PhD student I learned that it is<br>actually possible to have a full-time<br>lecturing job and nail a PhD while also<br>being a multiports athlete and having<br>children I learned that going into those<br>spaces where new environmental concerns<br>meet old well-entrenched Industries is a<br>tough<br>gig those aren't necessarily kind spaces<br>you need to be tough and a little bit<br>stubborn to push into those spaces that<br>gleeful photo of her on on today's<br>poster is perfect those Fallen coins are<br>clearly a symbolic representation of the<br>Share value of West Coast Mining and<br>2000s when that Journey was completed in<br>2008 I remember sitting on stage at the<br>Town Hall and watching Sara get En<br>capped and becoming Dr<br>Walton the key feeling that I distinctly<br>remember was how proud I was of what she<br>had achieved I couldn't have fin that<br>PhD in those circumstances now she was<br>walking across the stage still sane<br>still smart and now launching into a<br>pile of interesting new research at the<br>interface of critical thinking and<br>actually doing sustainability<br>Journeys today's talk has shown us just<br>where that Journey has taken sarra she<br>continued to work on sustainability<br>reporting began to publish on<br>ecopreneurs and took her ideas into<br>dramatic new locations like Samoa banatu<br>and the north denen flatting scene<br>she wrote on theorizing sustainability<br>Transitions and became a key node of the<br>emergence of the energy cultures<br>framework and the network of Scholars<br>who are refining it in different<br>settings and of course she has thrown<br>herself headlong into ways to address<br>the climate crisis his scholarship has<br>always been grounded in strong academic<br>insights but it's also highly applied<br>and directly intended to create actual<br>change in the world it is also as she's<br>reminded us today a scholarly joury<br>Journey that is grounded in<br>optimism reflecting on today's talk I<br>can't escape one important<br>realization as sar's PhD supervisor I<br>was trained in the late 20th century<br>when sharp social theoretical critique<br>and finding a nice scholarly angle on<br>obscure academic problems was probably<br>enough to sustain the average academic<br>career Sara has been the Prototype of a<br>21st century scholar someone who has<br>from the very beginning understood the<br>seriousness and scale of the<br>environmental and social catastrophes<br>that are looming in front of us someone<br>who has been tough resilient smart and<br>Incredibly de dedicated to making actual<br>change happen and she is someone who is<br>a phenomenal role model of the kind of<br>21st century academic we needed this<br>University if we going to play a<br>meaningful role in how we collectively<br>survive the 21st<br>century so for the second time in her<br>career I've been very happy to sit and<br>watch her take the next upward step on<br>the ladder and receive the recognition<br>she deserves once again I can report how<br>proud proud I am of what she has<br>achieved I know that her family her<br>friends her colleagues her students in<br>her University are all proud to see her<br>admitted to the ranks of the full propor<br>we are proud of how she has done it and<br>we
