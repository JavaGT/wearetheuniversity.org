More than 250 years later, alcohol consumption has become well entrenched in New Zealand’s cultural landscape and led to a significant impact on our rates of crime, violence, injuries and accidents.<br><br>In this fascinating public lecture at the University of Waikato on 26 March, Professor Michael Cameron will present insights from his research into some of the societal issues associated with the sale and distribution of alcohol.<br><br>Professor Michael Cameron is an economist in the University’s Waikato Management School, and a Research Associate in Te Ngira – the Institute for Population Research.<br><br>In recent years, his work has focused on research funded by the Health Promotion Agency that seeks to shed light on the complex relationship between the geographic location of alcohol outlets, competition in liquor prices, people’s drinking behaviour, and crime rates.<br><br>Following the government’s reduction of the drink-driving limit in December 2014, on one occasion this research involved hanging outside Hamilton bars at night to breath-test people and survey them to find out how intoxicated they thought they were.<br><br>His findings have informed parliamentary debates in Wellington, and the Law Commission’s review of the Sale of Liquor Act in 2010. He is also a District Licensing Commissioner for Waikato and Waitomo Districts, and on the District Licensing Committees for Waipā and Otorohanga Districts.<br><br>Professor Cameron began his academic career as a tutor in the University’s economics department back in 2002, and was later appointed as a teaching fellow and then lecturer.<br><br>He has always had a keen interest in public health issues, choosing to study the relationship between poverty and HIV/AIDS in rural Thailand for his PhD thesis.<br><br>Since then, his journey has taken him across a wide array of economic landscapes, from studying migration trends and population projections, through to measuring the impacts of poverty on wellbeing, population and agricultural land-use change related to climate, the impacts of the Covid-19 pandemic on higher education students, financial literacy among high school students, and whether social media can predict election results.<br><br>Professor Cameron’s research has seen him conduct fieldwork in many different countries, including China, India, Pakistan, Cambodia, Vietnam, Papua New Guinea, the Solomon Islands, and Timor Leste.<br><br>In addition, Professor Cameron has received six awards for outstanding teaching from the University of Waikato, and he was nominated for a National Tertiary Teaching Excellence Award in 2014.<br><br>It’s fair to say that the impact of his research resonates far beyond the confines of the lecture hall.</p><h2>Transcript</h2><p style="opacity: 0.9; font-size: 0.8em">Transcripts may be automatically generated and may not be 100% accurate.</p><p>tenot C good evening ladies and<br>gentlemen I'm Gary Wilson Deputy Vice<br>Chancellor research here at the<br>University of w and uh tonight we're<br>here to celebrate the achievements of<br>one of our leading academics and their<br>promotion to<br>professor and I have the privilege of<br>introducing them and providing some<br>biographical details before we hear from<br>him so I hope you're comfortable it's a<br>achievements so so tonight I wish to<br>introduce you to someone whose passion<br>for economics and whose dedication to<br>teaching and research is truly<br>inspiring Professor Michael Cameron is a<br>dynamic figure in the University's wado<br>management school he wears many hats<br>including cluding an academic one<br>tonight an economist a research<br>associate at tanira The Institute for<br>population research and is director of<br>teaching and learning for the school of<br>accounting finance and<br>economics he's also the author of<br>somewhat controversially named blog sex<br>drugs and<br>economics I'll let you join the dots<br>Professor Cameron's journey into<br>Academia began humbly as a tutor back in<br>200 to and since then he's ascended the<br>ranks from teaching fellow to senior<br>lecturer to<br>Professor he's highly regarded by a<br>students and peers having received six<br>awards from the University for his<br>outstanding teaching in 2014 he was<br>nominated for a national tery teaching<br>Excellence award a testament to his<br>commitment to<br>education beyond the classroom Professor<br>Cameron's research Ventures are nothing<br>short of fascinating for his PhD thesis<br>he chose to examine the relationships<br>between poverty and HIV AIDS in rural<br>Thailand since then he's explored<br>diverse economic terrains across a<br>breadth of topics from studying<br>migration Trends and population<br>projections through to measuring the<br>impacts of poverty on<br>well-being Professor Cameron's work is<br>always relevant and of international<br>significance for example he's examined<br>the impacts of the covid-19 pandemic on<br>higher education students and<br>investigated whether social media has<br>the power to predict election results<br>I'm interested to find the answer to<br>that in recent years Professor Cameron<br>has sought to shed light on New<br>Zealand's alcohol Culture by<br>investigating the complex relationship<br>between the location of alcohol Outlets<br>liquor prices people's drinking habits<br>and Associated crime rates his<br>intellectual Pursuits have taken him far<br>and wide with his research work based on<br>collaboration ations from Papa New<br>Guinea and Southeast Asia through to<br>India and China he has been a visiting<br>research associate at the national<br>Center for social and economic modeling<br>at the University of canura and in 2015<br>he was a visiting fellow at the program<br>on the global demography of Aging at<br>Harvard<br>University a true leader in his field<br>Professor Cameron holds a number of key<br>positions in Prof professional<br>associations and scholarly journals<br>shaping the disc course on Regional<br>studies and economic surveys he is Vice<br>President of the population Association<br>of New Zealand and vice president New<br>Zealand of the Australia New Zealand<br>Regional science Association<br>International in addition he's managing<br>editor of the austral Asian Journal of<br>Rel of region Regional studies and he<br>was appointed a member of the social<br>sciences panel of the Royal Society New<br>Zealand tarangi Maan fund for 2022 and<br>2024<br>I have no idea how he fits all that in<br>so without further Ado let's extend a<br>warm welcome and a round of applause and<br>welcome Professor Michael Cameron to the<br>stage<br>cor Cameron May Anderson may patteron<br>may Hodson uh<br>toaa good evening welcome to my prophal<br>lecture uh Professor Wilson T AR thank<br>you for that uh lovely introduction I<br>will do my best to live up to it<br>um we'll see how I go um I've been to a<br>number of these uh lectures um in the<br>brief that we're given is uh to talk a<br>little bit about our journey<br>journey um and to talk a little bit<br>about our research and I'm going to try<br>and do both of those things um and so I<br>have been to a number of these lectures<br>before and a lot of people talk talk<br>about their journey by presenting a<br>bunch of photos of of them growing up uh<br>I'm going to do that but I'm only going<br>to rely on on one photo and the reason<br>I'm only going to rely on one photo is<br>because I think it captures uh something<br>important but also I think it's probably<br>my Peak prowess when it comes to uh<br>being photogenic uh because it didn't it<br>didn't get any better than this and<br>uh uh and certainly I've never looked<br>that good since um and when when we look<br>back on our uh photos When We Were Young<br>uh it's tempting to think about you know<br>where did where did the years go I look<br>at this photo and I think where did the<br>hair go<br>um but uh the other thing thinking about<br>uh photos of When We Were Young uh is<br>that it reminds us um of just the the<br>possibilities that we had when we were<br>young and um there were so many things<br>we could do uh there were so many paths<br>we could follow uh there were so many<br>questions to ask uh and to answer and uh<br>maybe a few too many questions um mom<br>will probably attest to that<br>um so there were many things that I<br>could do and I wanted to do many things<br>probably I wanted to do too many things<br>and and uh you've heard a little bit<br>about what I've done but but let's go<br>back to um when I was in sixth form uh<br>for those of a more recent vintage that<br>would be year 12 um and so I had to this<br>was the first time I really got a chance<br>to decide what I want wanted to do got<br>to choose what subjects we would study<br>and so uh in my timetable there was<br>space for seven subjects so I chose<br>seven subjects and uh and went along to<br>uh the uh SE form Dean to get my<br>programmer study signed off uh and the<br>response was no no you can't do that and<br>I was like why I can fit them all in no<br>you can only do six you can't do seven<br>you can't can only do six the seven<br>space is for your study period And so<br>after a little bit of agonizing because<br>I had to somehow get seven down to six I<br>uh I decided which one I would drop so I<br>kept uh seventh form<br>calculus uh and uh English because it<br>was required um that may have been a<br>mistake<br>um uh physics chemistry uh German<br>accounting and the seventh subject that<br>I dropped was<br>economics which kind of ironic given<br>where I ended up<br>um so uh finished uh School uh and like<br>uh any good uh middle class uh citizen<br>headed off to University with literally<br>no idea what I was doing uh no idea what<br>I wanted to do uh possibly too many<br>things that I could have done um and<br>started that first year in University in<br>science uh studying physics and maths<br>and uh it was a complete disaster um I<br>think because I didn't really know what<br>I was doing but also there were so many<br>other things that suddenly caught my<br>attention um and so many other things<br>that I wanted to do with my time and<br>somehow University ended up at the<br>bottom of that list um somehow I managed<br>to scrape through that first year with<br>passing enough subjects that they would<br>let me into the second year um and even<br>better they let me completely pivot in<br>my second year and I Dred physics and uh<br>maths and picked up chemistry and<br>Material Science um and that went even<br>worse for me um because uh I used my<br>student loan as many of my peers did to<br>buy a car um not allowed to do that<br>anymore but at the time student loans<br>were new and they hadn't cottoned on to<br>the fact that we would we would do stuff<br>like buy a car um but that meant that I<br>could do all these other things that I<br>that I hadn't been able to do before and<br>and that just diverted my attention and<br>so uh by Easter of my second year I had<br>dropped out of University effectively um<br>and uh gone off to find myself and<br>usually when people are telling their<br>story about how they went off to find<br>themselves they'll talk about<br>backpacking in usbekistan or something<br>or building schools or health centers in<br>some remote Village in Malawi or<br>something um I made it as far as<br>toonga um and um didn't really go much<br>further than that but I did manage to do<br>a lot of things um after I left<br>University so I worked in Hospitality<br>worked at a<br>bar um worked at McDonald's for a while<br>um started my own business as an<br>internet consultant Because the Internet<br>Was new and nobody else knew that I<br>didn't know anything more than they did<br>um found myself eventually uh working at<br>an accounting firm um and worked my way<br>up until I was managing that firm um and<br>that sounds really grandiose um but the<br>firm had four people so it wasn't it<br>wasn't that big a deal but I was the<br>only one there who didn't have an<br>accounting degree and so I thought you<br>know this this isn't a good look I I<br>need to be a little bit more credible if<br>I'm going to take over this business and<br>buy it off my my boss who was already<br>semi-retired by that stage and so I went<br>to night school at the bay plenty<br>politch intending to study accounting<br>and the first two papers that I did at<br>Polytech were commercial law and that<br>that wasn't great but the second one I<br>did was economics um and uh Kim Watson<br>uh the PO did such a great job I<br>actually realized that this was kind of<br>fun this was something that I'd been<br>kind of missing and it had taken me<br>eight years after six form where I<br>dropped economics and not being able to<br>do it to figure out that actually this<br>was something which would let me answer<br>some questions answer some questions<br>that were interesting and important for<br>me so<br>um so heing started at night school and<br>I was going to do uh the uh New Zealand<br>diploma in business<br>part-time uh I decided that I wanted to<br>go full-time study third second time<br>around I guess at University third third<br>subject Choice um and uh finished my<br>diploma business at the bay politch and<br>then came over here to do my third and<br>fourth year of the Bachelor of<br>management studies uh intending to do<br>economics and Strategic Management uh<br>Strategic Management didn't last the<br>rest of that year and eventually I ended<br>up just just doing economics and um<br>there are certain people to blame for<br>that one sitting in the front row John<br>John Gibson um his third year paper in<br>development economics uh really opened<br>my eyes uh to a lot of the questions<br>that economics could answer uh Steven<br>Lim uh who didn't actually teach me but<br>uh he was uh I was tutoring uh for the<br>papers that he was teaching uh also<br>similarly uh<br>open my eyes to the sorts of questions<br>that economics could answer and actually<br>supervisors so uh never escaped why<br>cutter stayed here uh right through my<br>the r my undergrad through my PhD uh and<br>into uh an academic role eventually<br>getting to uh to be Professor uh last<br>year um<br>but I'm here to talk a little bit about<br>my research so I thought I thought a<br>good way to introduce that would be uh<br>to steal from uh the the university has<br>to go through this research assessment<br>exercise every six years the PBF the<br>performance-based research fund and as<br>part of that uh the academics have to<br>develop evidence portfolios showing what<br>our research Excellence is and part of<br>that portfolio process is to uh develop<br>a contextual summary of uh of what our<br>research is basically uh who we are as a<br>research what we've been doing what our<br>research is about and capsulated it all<br>within 1500 characters so um Professor<br>Wilson is going to avert his eyes and<br>cover his ears right now because I'm<br>going to tell you what my current draft<br>for the contextual summary is it is uh<br>my platform of research is really a<br>bunch of things I thought would be kind<br>of interesting to<br>study<br>um you can see I still haven't really<br>decided you know what I'm doing I'm<br>going to do a bit of everything um but<br>it's not quite that bad I I can actually<br>sort of uh summarize my research into<br>into three coherent themes um the first<br>is uh on population change migration and<br>population aging um the second is on the<br>social impacts of alcohol and realistic<br>policy responses and the third is on<br>economics education and teaching and so<br>thinking about those three things<br>population change you've got sex uh<br>social impacts of alcohol youve Got<br>Drugs uh economics teach you go<br>economics there's my blog named sex<br>drugs and<br>economics all right so uh why am I why<br>am I talking about alcohol today I had<br>to choose one of those three I could<br>have easily done 40 minutes on any of<br>them but alcohol seems to have brought<br>the audience in so it probably was a<br>um alcohol is a bit of a paradoxical<br>product um it's a legal intoxicant but<br>at the same time it's incredibly<br>harmful uh it's fun in low doses but uh<br>but dangerous when taken to<br>excess um and it's a huge contributor to<br>Family Violence and harm within the home<br>and yet at the same time it's intimately<br>linked to family events and and special<br>occasions so alcohol is both positive<br>and negative at the same time um and in<br>fact that's kind of well captured by um<br>this artwork which is uh by William<br>hogar comes from the 1750s uh called<br>beer Street and Jin Lane in beer Street<br>on the left um the inhabitants are happy<br>and healthy and prosperous uh they're<br>drinking uh English Beer Small Beer and<br>Ale um and on the right you've got Jin<br>Lane where the inhabitants are miserable<br>and addicted and poor um and they<br>drinking the foreign imported<br>Spirits um and so we can think about<br>alcohol as always being the sort of uh<br>seen both in a positive and negative<br>light and I could go I could spend a lot<br>of time talking about the history of<br>alcohol and I could spend a lot of time<br>talking about the history of alcohol<br>policy in New Zealand but I want to fast<br>forward to 1989 because that was<br>probably the most consequential change<br>the sale of liquor act uh in<br>1989 uh greatly liberalized alcohol<br>sales in New Zealand uh as a result<br>there was a big increase in the number<br>of licenses uh so for example in Monaco<br>city in South Oakland um between 1990<br>and 2008 uh the number of licenses more<br>than tripled um increased from about 150<br>to nearly<br>500 and so we ended up with a situation<br>that looks like this um so this is uh<br>the W monley uh Shopping Center in<br>otara um if you know otara at all this<br>is just off beards Road uh beards road<br>is the main road that runs from Papo toy<br>over the Southern Motorway and curves<br>curves around into the otata Town Center<br>um so this is about 50 minutes uh 50<br>sorry meters off that road uh just after<br>you cross the uh Southern Motorway um<br>and you can see that there on the left<br>there's a superet which had a liquor<br>license there's also a liquor store<br>right next door which also had a liquor<br>license obviously um but that's not the<br>end of the story uh because on Beard's<br>Road uh if you go out of wle Street turn<br>right and went AC back across the uh<br>Southern Motorway uh just on the right<br>there you'd find another liquor store<br>pretty much opposite the DB Brewery<br>actually that liquor store uh if you<br>turned left onto Beard's Road uh and<br>then uh Drive about 100 meters along<br>turn left again onto Gilbert Road you'd<br>find another liquor store uh and if you<br>drove back out onto beeds Road and into<br>the AAR aara Town Center you'd find<br>three more so in the space of about a<br>kilometer along Beard's Road and just<br>the sort of offshoots from that uh you<br>had six Liquor Stores um and so this<br>this photo was taken in 2008 um there's<br>fewer of those stores now interestingly<br>but but back then uh there were a<br>lot so excuse<br>me so why is this a problem well I can<br>tell you a little bit of theory um to<br>start off with um this theory is what we<br>call availability Theory it comes from<br>alcohol epidemiology and it's a way of<br>theoretically linking uh the number of<br>outlets to to harm and that could be<br>crime it could be uh disorder it could<br>be uh Health harms and so on when you<br>have more outlets in an area that lowers<br>what we call the full cost of alcohol<br>the full cost has two components to it<br>one is the price and the second<br>component of the full cost is what it<br>cost you to get the alcohol so if you<br>have to drive to the store and then<br>drive home that's part of the full cost<br>of obtaining alcohol having more Outlets<br>actually lowers both of those components<br>of the full cost uh because if there's<br>more outlets in an area you don't have<br>to travel as far right so that second<br>component is uh is reduced and if you<br>got more outlets in an area they should<br>compete with each other and one of the<br>ways they compete is by lowering their<br>prices and so you end up with a lower<br>full cost of alcohol in fact we think<br>about competition usually as being a<br>good thing that's why we have the<br>Commerce Commission to ensure<br>competition but actually it's lowering<br>prices and lowering prices of is not<br>necessarily good uh for all products um<br>a lower full cost of alcohol people<br>drink more when people drink more<br>there's more harm so that's essentially<br>a way of linking theoretically more<br>Outlets to more<br>harm and so that's where I picked things<br>up so in 2008 I got some uh funding from<br>the alcohol advisory Council alac uh to<br>look at uh the location of outlets what<br>the outlets were doing and importantly<br>whether there was some link to to to<br>harm and so uh thinking about those<br>sorts of questions where the outlets<br>locate um this is Monaco city um it's<br>not obvious from the map because I've<br>extra extracted it from the rest of the<br>country so um let me give you a little<br>bit of a geog geography lesson uh this<br>is the International Airport just here<br>this is manger uh this is the Monaco<br>Town Center this is manura this is<br>pakara hock buckland's Beach um this is<br>uh if you know the the eastern part of<br>uh Oakland outside of Monaco well this<br>is Woodford here this is uh beachlands<br>this is morai and this big rural area<br>here this all the area around clevedon<br>right this was all the the old Monaco<br>City before it was part of the uh the<br>super City so I'm going to use a map<br>that looks like this a few times so pays<br>to orient<br>yourself<br>um so there's two things on this map one<br>is the different areas are different<br>colors right and the darker the color is<br>the more people are living there the<br>second thing is there's lots of little<br>colored dots each of those colored dots<br>is a alcohol Outlet of of a type and the<br>uh different colors represent different<br>types and one of the things that's<br>obvious to to note here is that the ERS<br>tend to locate where people are right<br>that's that's no real surprise there's a<br>few sort of exceptions uh out here these<br>are Vineyards out by clevedon so um but<br>for the most part uh Outlets are tend to<br>be located where people<br>are um more interestingly though uh is<br>when we look at uh the relationship<br>between Outlets lo location and social<br>deprivation so the darker areas here on<br>this map represent areas that are higher<br>in Social deprivation if you like the<br>other poor areas the lower socioeconomic<br>areas um and now you can start to see a<br>little bit more of a pattern um so<br>there's fewer Outlets out here this is<br>rural as well as being wealthy but even<br>up here there's few um but there is many<br>down here in this Arc that goes from uh<br>mangeri through to<br>manura the lowest socioeconomic part of<br>South<br>Oakland now the question is does it<br>matter right does it matter for harm is<br>there a relationship between where<br>Outlets locate and the harms that they<br>create so um I want to fast forward to a<br>slightly different project which was not<br>focused on South Oakland but looked at<br>uh similar data uh for the whole of the<br>north Ireland and so in this research we<br>found uh that uh bars and nightclubs<br>generate a lot of harm so this is this<br>uh these columns here represent the<br>relationship between Outlets of<br>different types in violence in the north<br>iseland so an additional bar or<br>nightclub in a neighborhood was<br>associated with about five additional uh<br>violent harm uh incidents per year uh<br>significant more than the other Outlet<br>types and yet all of them were<br>associated in some way with more<br>violence similar story if we looked at<br>property damage again bars and<br>nightclubs uh were associated with a lot<br>more property damage about three<br>additional property damage events in in<br>the neighborhood uh per year and that<br>might not sound like a lot but you got<br>to remember how many bars and nightclubs<br>there are in the north Ireland right<br>there are hundreds right so this is<br>representing thousands of ADD additional<br>uh property damage events thousands of<br>additional violence events per<br>year all right now I know there's at<br>least some of my first year students<br>here and they'll be thinking no this is<br>correlation this is not causation and<br>they're right it's not that simple right<br>there's a good reason why um we we<br>can't necessarily uh pin this down as<br>easily as just looking at where's the<br>harm happening where's the outs<br>happening because we're making an assump<br>here which is the assumption that the<br>causality runs from more Outlets to more<br>crime and I've given you a theoretical<br>story as to why that might be from<br>availability Theory but actually things<br>could work in the other direction right<br>we could tell a plausible story about<br>why areas with more crime might have<br>more Outlets because areas that have<br>more crime tend to have lower property<br>rents including lower commercial<br>property rents uh that makes them an<br>attractive location for you to locate if<br>you're trying to set up a retail store<br>cuz going to be cheaper uh in terms of<br>rents uh for you to be there so actually<br>more crime might actually lead to more<br>Outlets or could be something else<br>that's creating more out both more<br>outlets and more crime uh as an example<br>of that uh social cohesion or Social<br>Capital right areas that have more<br>social cohesion more Social Capital<br>they're better able to prevent crime in<br>the location so they tend to have lower<br>crime but they also more likely to uh be<br>able to coordinate and prevent alcohol<br>Outlets from opening in their<br>neighborhood and so we'd end up in a<br>situation where we see more outlets in<br>particular areas and more crime there<br>and it's simply because those areas have<br>cohesion so we can deal with some of<br>these problems uh as to which way is the<br>causality going uh but not others so in<br>terms of social cohesion as a story if<br>we control for deprivation if we control<br>for the demographics of the area and a<br>few other things we can at least try and<br>exclude the mo the main uh problems<br>there uh the one that I want to focus on<br>next is is it more crime leading to more<br>Outlets because if that was if that<br>story was true then we'd see more<br>Outlets not just or we'd see this<br>relationship between crime and Outlets<br>not just for alcohol Outlets but for<br>Outlets of all types so I had a research<br>assistant about 10 years ago um go<br>throughout Hamilton and uh determine the<br>location of all of the bakeries<br>headdresses service stations and takeway<br>food Outlets uh in the city and and this<br>sounds like this should be a really<br>trivial thing to do you just look on the<br>internet but actually it's not that easy<br>and in 2014 it was definitely wasn't<br>that easy she literally had to visit<br>every single business Zone in the city<br>and walk or drive through it noting down<br>where all these locations were um but<br>that was pretty important data because<br>because it allowed me to look at what's<br>the relationship between all of these<br>other Outlet types as well as alcohol<br>Outlet types and uh violent crime for<br>Hamilton um and we actually find that if<br>we do the same sort of um statistical<br>relationship between uh between violence<br>and Outlets of different types actually<br>service stations that are the worst<br>um and bakeries are pretty bad as well<br>off licenses licensed clubs which is<br>sports clubs uh citizens clubs uh rsas<br>and so on<br>um but the reason why I did this is I<br>wanted to work out is it retail density<br>that's really picking this up so so<br>taking this these results extracting how<br>much of the harm we could actually um<br>explain by the location of bakeries<br>hairdresses service stations and takeway<br>food Outlets if we could striple that<br>away there should be no relationship<br>left with the other outlets or very<br>relationship and in fact that wasn't<br>true at all so it's not a story of<br>retail density right that's explaining<br>uh the relationship between alcohol<br>outlets and violence it's actually<br>something else that's going on it's not<br>just a story about where they<br>locate all right but uh the outlets that<br>seem to be the the worst here were the<br>license clubs and the off licenses so<br>we've done a little bit of work over the<br>years looking at what it is that off<br>licenses do uh so we're back to Monaco<br>City now this is uh for many years I've<br>been collecting data on prices and<br>trading hours of alcohol Outlets uh<br>every January uh we try and do a little<br>phone survey of outlets in Hamilton and<br>South Oakland uh we're not very<br>successful with the phone so we end up<br>uh visiting many of them so um over the<br>course of a week I think I visit nearly<br>200 liquor stores and supermarkets uh<br>every January uh collecting what the<br>closing opening and closing times uh and<br>the prices of certain products um and so<br>this is the data from 2012 uh for the<br>old Monaco City area and what you'll<br>notice is that uh the lighter areas are<br>uh where the off license is close<br>earlier uh on Saturday on Friday and<br>Saturday night uh and the areas that are<br>darker they close later and you might<br>remember one of the earlier Maps I<br>showed you um that showed you the socio<br>econom deprivation social deprivation of<br>these areas the areas where the stores<br>open later on Friday and Saturday night<br>tend to be the areas that are more<br>deprived right lower socioeconomic<br>areas uh when we look at pricing though<br>it's not quite that<br>simple<br>um in general prices do tend to be a<br>little bit lower in areas that are uh<br>more deprived but actually it's not<br>quite as straightforward as it is uh for<br>the opening<br>hours and I'll talk a little bit more<br>about pricing uh a little bit<br>later because I want to switch to<br>something else um I like doing field<br>work I like getting out of the office uh<br>most people think about economists<br>sitting in the office sort of tapping<br>away at our computers looking at data on<br>the screens or something nah I'm gonna<br>go out and talk to people so um in<br>2014 uh the government decided deed to<br>change uh the<br>uh limit for drink driving do you<br>remember this so this was back in 2014<br>and at the time I I looked at this<br>change and went you know what that's<br>that's a kind of a it's an interesting<br>change it's one that that we should<br>support but at the same time I bet<br>nobody knows nobody who's drinking knows<br>whether they're over the old limit let<br>alone the new limit um I bet if I took a<br>breathalyzer and I went out breath<br>alized people in the street um and asked<br>them to guess what their breath alcohol<br>content was they would have no idea um<br>and then somebody gave me money to do<br>this uh so I bought a breath elizer uh<br>went out on the street and started<br>surveying people in downtown<br>Hamilton um and we've done this twice<br>now we did it in 2014 we did it again in<br>2019 um in 2014 what we were really<br>interested in was that question of did<br>PE were people able to guess uh their<br>breath alcohol content so each one of<br>the Dots here represents somebody's<br>guess um graphed against what their<br>actual breath alcohol content was uh the<br>solid line going up at 45 degree line if<br>everybody guessed correctly all of those<br>dots would be exactly on that solid line<br>and so you can see that this is looks<br>pretty random people have no idea no<br>idea at all um they're better than<br>completely at random uh because the<br>dashed line is the trend line that goes<br>through all of these dots so at least uh<br>on average uh people who were more more<br>intoxicated tended uh to Guess that they<br>were um and<br>yet people who uh were less intoxicated<br>were more likely to<br>overestimate um and people who were more<br>intoxicated were more likely to<br>underestimate and so um that was kind of<br>interesting but also I think a lot of<br>people and and we were talking to people<br>a lot of people said they w't driving<br>anyway right so it didn't really matter<br>um but I guess if you wanted people to<br>know whether they were safe to drive<br>you'd want to be confident that they<br>could actually evaluate whether they<br>were safe to drive or not and this<br>suggests that actually people can't do<br>that at all and so the safest thing for<br>for most people is to follow the advice<br>that if you're drinking don't drive<br>because you actually have no idea um how<br>drunk you really<br>are um the other thing that this allowed<br>us to to do and I want to fast forward<br>to the 2019 uh field work we did was it<br>allows us to measure how intoxicated are<br>people on the street over the course of<br>the night uh because we were doing these<br>surveys and we started at about 8 or 900<br>p.m. and we went until about 2: a.m. and<br>so we could work out what's the average<br>intoxication level of people we surveyed<br>as we go through the night and so this<br>is what we get when we uh look at that<br>each one of these dots is uh an average<br>within a 10minute period uh the dashed<br>line here is uh averaging over uh 50<br>minutes so just under an hour and what<br>we see is the the dinner crowd uh up<br>until about 10 uh p.m. uh their level<br>there is about 150 uh just for context<br>250 is the new uh limit for driving uh<br>400 was the old limit um then from about<br>10 till about 11 things start to ramp up<br>a little bit people are a bit more<br>intoxicated after that it flattens out<br>but it's still growing so over the<br>course of the night the people that<br>we're seeing on the street are more and<br>more and more intoxicated but most of<br>that change happens by about 11: p.m.<br>right after that it's not getting much<br>worse um but also this allowed us to<br>look at well what is driving this right<br>and one of the key things that we were<br>looking at in this 2019 study uh was<br>what was the role of pre-drinking<br>pre-drinking is people who drink before<br>they go out right and so comparing<br>people who pre-drink with those who<br>don't I don't think think there's any<br>real surprise here um that the pre-<br>drinkers are more intoxicated that those<br>than those who started drinking after<br>they after they came out um but what's<br>surprising is that um the pre-drinks are<br>pretty drunk all the way through the<br>night even even as early as 9:00 p.m.<br>even as early as<br>9:30 um and in fact if we look at the<br>difference the average difference<br>between the people who are pre- jinking<br>the people who are not the average<br>difference is about 250 uh micro gam per<br>leader which is the drink driving limit<br>um so that's the difference between<br>people who are pre-drinking those who<br>not now um I mentioned earlier that what<br>I was interested in was realistic policy<br>um for this and so a lot of people a lot<br>of policy makers jump on this<br>pre-drinking and uh and of course<br>pre-drinking is people buying at off<br>licenses often drinking at home and then<br>going into town so maybe we should do<br>something with the off licenses by m<br>such as making them close earlier so we<br>actually had asked people um who were<br>pre-drinking when did you buy your<br>alcohol that you that you were pre<br>pre-drinking that night and it turns out<br>that most of them buy uh before 7 p.m.<br>2third of them buy before 7 p.m. so if<br>you wanted to use the off-license hour<br>trading hours as a way of restricting<br>pre-drinking you'd have to have<br>supermarkets and off licenses stopping<br>alcohol sales very early in the day<br>right well before 7 p.m. which doesn't<br>seem like a realistic uh thing to<br>do<br>um but one of the things one of the<br>other things we asked about was why do<br>you pre-drink and and again this is<br>something that's unsurprising once you<br>once you think about the results a lot<br>of people talked about social<br>motivations they wanted to get primed<br>for the night get ready feel a little<br>bit buzzed before they go out okay<br>that's why I remember those days too um<br>but the other uh motivation was economic<br>um it was simply way cheaper to buy<br>alcohol from the off licenses from<br>supermarkets than it is to buy from bars<br>and actually that's something that the<br>government had had done because when the<br>sale and supply of alcohol act came in<br>in 2012 one of the things they cracked<br>down on was happy hours and happy hours<br>actually made the differential in<br>pricing between offli es and bars much<br>greater and so rather than people going<br>out early to a bar and drinking during<br>the happy hour they stayed home and<br>drank at home instead right and so uh<br>that's why we've seen a rise in<br>pre-drinking um fast forward a little<br>bit not too far on from from 2019 Co<br>changed everything and that that applies<br>to many things uh but also applies to<br>the way that people buy alcohol uh<br>because while there was alcohol delivery<br>um prior to co uh Co just doubled down<br>on this um so home delivery of alcohol<br>suddenly became something that everybody<br>was doing right rather than being uh a<br>niche uh Service uh the problem with<br>home delivery is that uh controls on<br>alcohol delivery are much laxer than<br>controls on sales and store uh why<br>because if you buy alcohol online um<br>nobody's really checking your ID all you<br>need to do is click the button says I'm<br>18 and over job done um so we were<br>interested though and what happens at<br>the delivery end right at the sales end<br>it's obvious that anybody who's under 18<br>can just click the button and then buy<br>the question is what happens when it's<br>actually delivered to them um so again<br>out in the field uh we uh we bought some<br>alcohol we got it delivered to us and we<br>were checking whether uh firstly we were<br>checking uh what was it in us to do this<br>we were checking how many different<br>places would be willing to uh deliver to<br>us same day and um we were checking<br>would they check ID would they drop<br>things on the doorstep and run without<br>even knowing if somebody was home um<br>because of course these would be uh a<br>real problem and so we did this in<br>Hamilton and South ockland<br>um HED ourselves some airbnbs got some<br>alcohol delivered in fact we ended up<br>with a lot of alcohol um<br>you think this looks like a lot but<br>actually by the time we took this photo<br>we'd already disposed of about half of<br>it so so um and uh my son's room got<br>turned into a sort of an impromptu<br>alcohol Storehouse<br>um what did we find well we could get a<br>lot of alcohol delivered uh we could get<br>it delivered quickly some places would<br>deliver in under an hour um but actually<br>this research may have been the least<br>coste effective research that I've ever<br>done because we had a couple of airbnbs<br>and a couple of locations in Hamilton<br>and then in South Oakland but in each<br>one of those locations we could only get<br>a handful of places to even sell us<br>alcohol and deliver it the same day um<br>so myself and two research assistance in<br>the Airbnb waiting uh a few hours for<br>alcohol to be delivered and we'd only<br>get sort of five or six in a day um so<br>incredibly costly um as far as research<br>goes um<br>and the price was quite High uh and that<br>was what surprised me the most about<br>this I guess because uh we had in mind<br>beforehand that you could get alcohol<br>delivered quickly and cheaply but<br>actually that wasn't the case um and<br>having talked to a few uh store owners<br>subsequent to this uh it's become clear<br>why people are just not willing to pay<br>the high premium that it would cost for<br>fast delivery for the most part and so a<br>lot of stores that dur during Co started<br>doing deliveries then as we came out of<br>lockdown they stopped because nobody was<br>willing to pay them the real cost of<br>having one of their um staff members<br>actually deliver the<br>alcohol um in terms of ID checking um we<br>were also surprised with the results we<br>expected the supermarkets to be fully on<br>top of this turns out the supermarkets<br>were the worst offenders um they were<br>the least likely to check ID and the<br>most likely to drop your delivery on<br>your doorstep and leave before you got a<br>chance to answer the door so they had no<br>idea whether they were selling uh<br>whether they sorry were delivering<br>alcohol to someone who was underage um<br>in contrast we thought the delivery<br>drivers like deliver easy and Uber Eats<br>would be the worst offenders in fact<br>they were the best ones um they always<br>checked ID and they never left Al<br>alcohol<br>unattended um in fact talking to uh one<br>of the UB drivers after we' finished uh<br>This research um they actually have to<br>take a photo of people's ID before<br>they're allowed to leave the alcohol<br>which is a pretty effective uh means of<br>ensuring that they know that the alcohol<br>is being delivered to someone uh who is<br>age okay<br>so um that's a sampling of some of my<br>research uh in alcohol um there are<br>other things I've done as well I<br>evaluated the one-way door policy uh<br>that the bars and fer have and uh uh<br>long story short it didn't have much<br>effect at all sadly um and there's other<br>things as well um but still not done<br>still lots of questions I still have<br>lots of questions I'm going to continue<br>to have lots of questions and I'm going<br>to continue to explore them as you might<br>expect uh given the other things that<br>I've said today um in particular I still<br>don't think we've nailed down this uh<br>causality uh I'm still not happy with it<br>uh maybe it still does go from more<br>crime to more Outlets rather than the<br>other way around um and there's a lot<br>more that we can do in terms of<br>understanding the pricing understanding<br>the trading hours understanding the way<br>the competition affects these things and<br>so I've got a lot of data on this um and<br>uh I've also just been granted access to<br>a pretty um substantial data set on<br>pricing at the store level weekly going<br>back about a decade um so uh there's a<br>lot more that I can do with this<br>all right how are we going for<br>time Perfect all right I need to uh to<br>acknowledge some people before I finish<br>uh I'm going to acknowledge Colleen and<br>Roger uh my parents they started started<br>me on this journey because they uh<br>didn't uh tell me I wasn't allowed to<br>ask questions and so that's where I<br>started um or at least I don't remember<br>them telling me not to ask questions<br>they probably did many times and I just<br>didn't listen um uh my wife Jim um again<br>lets me ask lots of questions gets angry<br>with me because I asked too many<br>questions um but uh nevertheless lets me<br>do so uh Sarah and Ryan who yeah they<br>also get bombarded with questions as<br>well they just don't answer them<br>um the research has been funded uh to<br>Fatu order Health New Zealand's my<br>latest funer but before that it was<br>health promotion agency alcohol advisory<br>Council uh the University of w strategic<br>research fund they were the ones who let<br>me buy the breathalizer um that was kind<br>of Awesome<br>um and then a whole bunch of co-authors<br>that I've worked with over the years<br>this is not an exhaustive list these are<br>the ones I've worked with the most uh<br>many different universities in New<br>Zealand uh in Australia and then a small<br>army of research assistants who have<br>helped with all sorts of things from<br>geocoding the location of of liquor<br>Outlets by hand uh doing field work<br>helping with some of the uh analysis uh<br>on all<br>right<br>so that is Mei<br>much<br>ten my name is Frank scrimger and it's<br>my pleasure to uh bring this evening to<br>a conclusion Michael thank you very much<br>for your address uh it's it was really<br>great to uh hear some something of your<br>life story even if you uh restricted the<br>photos<br>um and it is encouraging to us all to<br>see we're asking<br>questions in our childhood can take us<br>over the long run um I trust that uh we<br>as a community invest more and more in<br>in<br>encouraging our future University<br>years Michael I noticed your<br>acknowledgement of uh Steven Lim and<br>John Gibson and I think uh your talk<br>tonight uh showed how you are a worthy<br>participant in the line of uh successful<br>economics professors and analysts and<br>teachers at this University there's been<br>a long tradition since John Ward one of<br>the four founding professors of the<br>university and it's great to see see uh<br>you joining uh uh the propor um and<br>along with Professor Anna strut in<br>recent<br>times thank you for um opening up to us<br>how economists go about their daily work<br>sometimes uh in the community we hear uh<br>people talk as if<br>they assume that economists know the<br>answer to everything before they've uh<br>done any work but you clearly showed how<br>it is so important to um address<br>competing hypotheses and to explore what<br>is happening and why it's happening and<br>and so it was great also to see your<br>connection with other disciplines<br>whether it be sociology or epidemiology<br>or geography<br>whatever um the world is a complicated<br>place and none of us can um<br>claim uh all the expertise<br>that's is needed to address the issues<br>importance many people these days talk<br>about evidencebased<br>evidence-based policies if we are to<br>have evidencebased<br>policies we need someone doing the duty<br>work to gather the data and to analyze<br>it appropriately thank you for giving us<br>some examples of uh contemporary<br>empirical<br>work I'd like to Echo Professor Wilson's<br>uh words at the start of the night to<br>honor you Michael for your contributions<br>across uh multiple areas of University<br>and community life and I'm sure the<br>audience will appreciate there's a<br>reason why we ask Michael to teach first<br>year economics classes and try and uh<br>attract students to engage seriously<br>with the discipline and potentially<br>I would like to thank everyone for<br>attending<br>tonight visitors to the<br>university<br>colleagues staff members<br>students and I trust that tonight's uh<br>experience encourages you to come back<br>for the next professorial lecture which<br>will soon be announced watch out for<br>that<br>so before I formally close I would like<br>to advise you that uh Michael will stay<br>around in the foyer for a little while<br>afterwards feel free to uh button hole<br>him and uh ask him some questions he has<br>so much fun asking questions for<br>everyone else uh Now's the Time for you<br>to<br>return the favor thank you very much for<br>your attendance good night</p></main><footer style="margin-top: 2rem; background: #0001; padding: 2rem; text-align: center;"><p>We Are The University</p><ul
