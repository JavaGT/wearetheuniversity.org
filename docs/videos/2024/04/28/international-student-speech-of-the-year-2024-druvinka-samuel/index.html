Multicultural island of Sri<br>Lanka dink's journey to studying<br>sociology was deeply influenced by her<br>upbringing<br>she primarily credits her interest in<br>sociology and social policy to her<br>parents whose pioneering efforts and<br>catalyzing socioeconomic change in Sri<br>Lanka have ined inspired<br>her Dinka was one of the many students<br>who began their degree during the<br>covid-19<br>pandemic this meant that her first year<br>of University was online from her home<br>in Sri Lanka and she was then invited to<br>apply to traveled to New Zealand for<br>full-time

to the podium to give the<br>student address Dinka<br>Samuel thank you Dr<br>Sarah uh I used to run track in high<br>school so my experience with nervousness<br>has most often been limited to 100 m<br>races and more recently standing in<br>Immigration lines at the<br>airport so if you see my hand shaking as<br>I deliver this speech today no you did<br>not Chancellor sir Anand satyanand Vice<br>Chancellor Professor Neil Quigley<br>esteemed faculty family friends and my<br>fellow graduates<br>aayu ban Tena Koto good<br>afternoon I'm so unbelievably honored to<br>be the student speaker for this<br>ceremony my name is Dinka Samuel I'm an<br>international student from Sri Lanka<br>with a social sciences degree that's<br>right contrary to what Hollywood might<br>suggest not all South Asian women are<br>women in<br>stem firstly congratulations to everyone<br>graduating today that diploma you are<br>holding right now is quite literally a<br>symbol of your commitment and dedication<br>to not just completing your degree but<br>successfully closing out this chapter in<br>your life<br>congratulations we so often tend to see<br>achievements like this one as something<br>that marks the end of a chapter and the<br>start of another so today I'm not going<br>to talk to you about what it is you and<br>I are going to do once we turn the page<br>but what we have<br>overcome I'd like to talk to you about<br>three things uncertain circumstances<br>your ability to persevere and the<br>community that saw you through<br>it you might be a graduate who is also a<br>parent a grandparent or a returning<br>student perhaps an international student<br>an immigrant a person with a disability<br>or someone who has a loved one battling<br>illness you might be someone who has had<br>to overcome unimaginable socioeconomic<br>hardship just to be here or you may be<br>the first in your family to pursue a<br>higher<br>education I don't know everyone here but<br>what I'd like to honor is what it has<br>taken for you to be graduating today<br>think about it we have had to wear<br>through economic crisis climate<br>disasters and a global<br>pandemic what defines us then is not<br>what we are doing next but our ability<br>to succeed amidst uncertainty our<br>perseverance and the community that<br>fueled our<br>perseverance when I left Sri Lanka in<br>the second year of my degree it was at a<br>time of extraordinary<br>uncertainty my country was experiencing<br>a staggering economic crisis people<br>would spend days in mile long cues for<br>fuel and power Cuts would last as long<br>as 14 hours it was<br>apocalyptic amid all this my father was<br>battling the after effects of a third<br>cancer and was in hospital nearly every<br>other day of the<br>week many of my assignments at this time<br>were written either in the waiting rooms<br>of hospitals or in the darkness of a<br>power cut<br>I had never felt quite as conflicted as<br>I did when my Visa was granted to me<br>here was an out amid<br>uncertainty but how could I possibly<br>find it in myself to leave home my<br>family my country at a time like<br>that I found certainty in my family's<br>unwavering love and support and<br>reassurance in my community's promises<br>to look out for my family while I was<br>away it took a village to get me<br>here one of my favorite writers Dr Aisha<br>Khan writing on the collective<br>experience of difficult emotions says<br>and I quote we can hold almost any<br>difficult emotion so long as we hold it<br>together in community end<br>quote at the University of w I have not<br>just received an education but also<br>experienced what it means to be in an<br>environment where the Arts and social<br>sciences are core to education and not<br>just an<br>add-on the experience of mutual learning<br>surpassed the traditional boundaries of<br>Education to which I was<br>accustomed it felt revolutionary to<br>learn in an environment that is nonh<br>hierarchical with students and lecturers<br>who are so different to me and yet so<br>similar<br>I would like to pause here to thank<br>every single one of the amazing<br>academics on this stage thank you for<br>creating an environment that's so<br>nurturing inclusive and conducive to<br>meaningful growth for everyone<br>graduating<br>today I think I can possibly speak for<br>other International students when I say<br>that nothing quite prepares you for the<br>experience of saying goodbye to your<br>family but despite the pain of being<br>being away from home in aora I found my<br>Foo I would be remiss if I didn't thank<br>my friends who have radicalized my<br>concept of friendship by treating me<br>like<br>family I have had the time of my life on<br>yeah I just watching horror movies<br>during study<br>breaks thank you guys for being my home<br>home for many International students an<br>overseas education is a passport to<br>possibility and failure is a luxury they<br>cannot afford my privilege to have this<br>opportunity single-handedly lies in the<br>sacrifices my parents have made for me<br>so my family is not in the audience<br>right now instead they are watching me<br>Gra graduate from home in Sri<br>Lanka I don't think I could ever<br>comprehend what it takes to let your<br>daughter go to a country that you have<br>never set foot in to give her the<br>opportunities you have never<br>had I'm standing here today for my<br>family and because of my<br>family so many Sentiments of mine can<br>end with that prepositional phrase<br>because of my<br>family my parents have not raised me<br>with the pretense that I can do whatever<br>I want but rather the quiet belief that<br>I can be whoever I want to<br>be they have stood at the finish line of<br>every one of my Racers oblivious to the<br>fact that if it weren't for them I would<br>have never known what it means to<br>run all that I am and all that I ever<br>will be I owe to them<br>Amma thoughts I love you with all my<br>heart lastly to this graduating<br>class I feel honored to be graduating<br>among people who are closing out this<br>chapter with qualifications spanning the<br>Arts social sciences law and<br>psychology in a world that privileges a<br>certain type of education there is<br>resistance in your decision to pursue<br>this one<br>so as you stand at the precipice of<br>change and uncertainty yet again I'd<br>like to remind you that you have been<br>there and done that you are not defined<br>by your<br>circumstances but in how you persevere<br>through them and the person you choose<br>to become after overcoming<br>them I'd like to leave you with a deeply<br>reassuring text post I saw on social<br>media the other day it simply said and I<br>quotee relax you are on your way to your<br>destination<br>and you're in a super cute<br>outfit thank you and congratulations</p></main><footer style="margin-top: 2rem; background:
